OK, I took  liberty w/ this recipe & made a few changes. I let my filets rest for an hour (helps keep the meat tender...if you apply heat to chilled meat it shocks it & causes it to toughen up) before salt & peppering them (used Paula Deen's house seasoning). I also chose to broil mine & then pulled them out to rest again (this allows the juices to distribute evenly) before I started the balsamic mixture. I did not cook the steaks in the balsamic glaze, instead I doubled the amount of balsamic, added a bit of sugar & garlic (per previous reviews), used merlot but did not double it, & reduced it on the stovetop for about 10 minutes until it was kinda thick & syrupy. I topped my steaks w/ small amounts of crumbled gorgonzola cheese ...broiling for just a minute or two to melt the cheese. I plated the steaks & drizzled the balsamic "syrup" over the top. These were out of this world good!  The sweetness of the glaze paired w/ the pungency of the cheese is a taste sensation that my hubby & I really enjoyed!!!!

Here's the trick to make this recipe work: We seasoned the filets with salt and fresh ground pepper and let them rest out of the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes; THEN, we grilled them. In the meantime, we mixed the balsamic vinegar, red wine (used Bordeaux) and a generous pinch of brown sugar. Let it reduce and then served in little sauce cups alongside the filets. My husband LOVED this. I didn't want to take the chance of ruining some great filets by cooking them in the wine/vinegar mixture since a lot of people were turned off by this in their reviews. By allowing it to reduce, it was a little bit thicker (still a bit too thin for me however) and you can merely dunk your bite into the sauce, thereby adjusting how much or little you would like. Will make this again because of the simplicity of the recipe.

This glaze is the best sauce I've ever tasted.  I think it's impossible to mess it up, you could put in any variation of the ingredients and it would still be tasty.  I followed the recipe until the steaks finished, then took them out, and let the glaze cook down for about 3 minutes, adding brown sugar (1 to 2 tbsp.) and butter (1/2 to 1 tbsp).
I forgot to double the recipe like everyone else mentioned, make sure you do! Not only is the sauce fantastic on the meat, but SO good with asparagus, dip bread in it, put it on potatoes.  I'm going to make it over and over again.

This was excellent but I made some changes to help it. First, I salt and peppered the steaks and then placed them in the pan in a little bit of olive oil (1-2 tbsps) and browned them on med-hi for 1 minute both sides. I put the 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar in a sauce pan and 1/4 cup sherry (just because i didn't have red wine on hand today) and added 2 cloves minced garlic and 1 heaping tbsp brown sugar. I let this simmer while the steaks were browing. Then I poured the sauce over the steaks and turned heat to low and covered. I cooked my husband's filet for 4 minutes each side to be medium, but I like my with less red and cooked my 6 minutes each side. The sauce reduced perfectly and it became a glaze and was wonderful. Make sure you don't let it reduce too much or it will be a burnt. I liked it with the sherry so much I don't know if i will bother trying with the red wine or not. It had a wonderful flavor. I would definitely only make with garlic added. PERFECT... we felt like we had just eaten in a steak restaurant!

Happy Valentines Day, Oh my!!!! This was heaven, I sauteed about a cup each of onions & mushrooms in 1 tbsp each butter, olive oil, & 1 clove garlic when tender moved to a bowl, increased heat and placed steak in pan, turning after 1 min each side, did not cover, and turning again after 4 min each side, added the balsamic/red zinfandael after 8 min, after 10 min total I added the mushroom/ onion mixture to the pan for another 4 min turnin the steaks again, aftern 14 min total removed the steaks to a plate and continued to reduce the onion/mushroom mixture for another 4 min while the steak rested, a perfect warm pink center, and a mushroom/onion, balsamic/zinfandel side dish to drool over. Happy Valentines Day

I can't comment on the preparation of the steaks in this recipe, as hubby grilled ours outdoors over charcoal.  I do have to say, however, that I would never simmer the filets in the reduction.  In my view that's a good way to ruin very expensive filets! Having said that, I guess what I'm reviewing here is the balsamic/wine reduction which was just too simple to be that good!  Richly flavorful and syrupy, and to think all you have to do is mix up a GOOD red wine and a GOOD balsamic vinegar and simmer it until it reduces about 75 percent. This was as good as any fancier or difficult glaze or reduction than I've ever made or eaten at fine restaurants. This definitely will be something I'll remember to make again.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  We wanted something other than the same old turkey for Christmas this year.  And...We didn't want Christmas leftovers either.  This was perfect.  I tripled the recipe and served 6.  I served it with roasted red potatoes and green beans.  I also served it with homemade foccatia bread served with olive oil and basalmic vinegar.  Steamed artichokes for appetizer and a great recipe I found for chocolate pudding cake by Emeril Lagasse.  My Brother-in-law commented that in a resaurant that would have been a good $60-80 meal per person!  That is the best complement I've ever gotten for my cooking.  I was surprised that other people didn't find the recipe as outstanding as we did.  The key thing i think is to use good quality ingredients.  This isn't something I could afford to make every week.  The steaks alone cost me $55, not to mention the wine...but the topper is the get the best basalmic that you can afford.  We used one aged 18 years. It was really sweet.  Tasted almost like raisins.  I give this 5 stars!!!

Made this last night for husband's birthday dinner.  We both loved it.  After reading some of the reviews here, I cooked the sauce separately and made some changes. Used 2 5 oz filets wrapped in bacon and rubbed with coarse ground black pepper & Mrs Dash Garlic & Herb seasoning.  Seared the bacon in a hot pan by turning steaks on their sides with tongs before cooking 3 minutes on each side for rare.  Started out with hot pan and gradually reduced heat as steaks cooked.
For the sauce, used red table wine & doubled it along w/the balsamic vinegar called for in the recipe. Added 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp minced garlic.  Reduced sauce by half & used for dipping.

We thought the sauce complimented the meat wonderfully without overpowering it.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Lovely recipe - YUM !  :)
So easy and so good !  I made this for my birthday dinner and my husband and I were so pleased at the results.
I added a few crushed cloves of garlic to the wine/vinegar and let it sit for a while before starting.  I also used a very coarsly ground pepper/salt combination made for meats.  Also, with all steak recipes, you should let the meat reach room temperature before cooking.

Tasted like....vinigar...and I really don't think vinegar and steak should go together. needs more of something, salt maybe, onion seasoning would add a nice touch. The peppercorn could stay, but really, I would try this again if I were cooking on the grill, but this just shouldn't be pan cooked together. as a marinade, I'd do it again, but not exactly like this. I really don't think I'll try this again, I think the measurements are off, with the red wine, not sure, but this wasn't as good as I thought it might be. Also, In my opinion, these reviews here, claiming this recipe to be deliscious or wonderful are just plain OVER RATED!....No one in my family was enthusiastic about this one. I was not impressed, and frankly this may very well be the worst flavor for steak I've ever encountered...Minus some vinigar or wine, cocka!!!

Absolutely delicious!  Our filets were larger than 4 oz., so I did double the sauce ingredients.  Following the suggestions of others, I brushed the filets with olive oil, rubbed them with Paula Deen's House Seasoning (salt, pepper & garlic), and let them sit out of the frig for over ½ hour before cooking.  I then seared/browned the filets on all sides.  After removing them from the pan and covering them on a plate with foil, I added the wine and vinegar to the pan, stirred to loosen browned bits, and reduced the mixture.  One tablespoon of brown sugar and one tablespoon+ of butter was then stirred in.  The filets were returned to the pan, turning to coat in the sauce, covered, and simmered for approximately 5 minutes.  Result:  my husabnad ate his filet as fast as he eats desserts...which means he basically inhaled it because he loved the taste and tenderness so very much.  This is a winner of a recipe, and I will definitely use it again and again.  Thank you!

We loved this!  I used marsala wine instead of red and added some brown sugar.  We grilled the steaks vs. doing them in the pan.  We rubbed the steaks with a little olive oil, fresh minced garlic, a little salt and cracked black pepper. We served the sauce on the side to dip the steaks into.

For those who are afraid to cook the filet in the glaze or insist on grilling them, a little advice. If you properly sear your beef, any cut, on ALL sides, not just the top and bottom, you will seal in the juices. You do not have to worry about the beef drying out or being ruined. Take heed, you must get a nice sear on all sides. My advice, use clarified butter in a heated pan. Sear top and bottom first and then the sides. You can then cook it the rest of the way on the stove top or in an oven, but done right it is much better and way more tender than broiled or grilled. Outstanding recipe.

Thank you Linda for this decadent glaze.  I followed a combination of the original recipe, plus took suggestions from other reviewers and also added more butter (who doesn't love more butter in a recipe).  I sprinkled salt and pepper to taste on both sides of the steak.  Allowed to rest for 30 minutes on the countertop.  Then put 2 T of salted butter in the pan.  Once the pan was really hot, I put in the steaks.  Allowed to sear on each side for one minute.  Then reduced the temperature to med-low.  In a 2 c measuring cup, I combined 1/2 c balsamic vinegar and 1/2 c Cabernet (that's what was open at the time), 2 cloves pressed garlic, 1 T brown sugar and 2 T salted butter.    Mixed well.  Added the sauce to the pan over the steaks.  Cooked covered for 3 minutes on each side.  Removed the steaks, then continued reducing sauce until it was a glaze (about 6 minutes).  My husband who usually adds a sauce to anything, even something that already has a sauce on it, didn't need to put anything else on it.  In fact, I caught him sipping the sauce from a spoon.

This recipe is exceptionally delicious. I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce ingredients, used a T. of brown sugar, and swirled in a T. or so of butter to finish the sauce on high heat AFTER removing the steaks to a platter.  I used a stainless steel fry pan and cranked the heat to super-high; my steaks became crusty and deeply browned.  After browning, I removed them to a plate where I loosely draped foil over them.  With the heat still on high, I added the balsamic, wine, garlic, salt and pepper and SCRAPED THE FROND from the bottom of the pan.  For folks whose sauces remained watery, I suggest that this technique be used in the future.  It is vitally important, as well, to use real aged balsamic, as it is pretty viscous with which to begin and helps create the desired glaze.  The pat of butter added after the sauce was reduced further tightened my sauce to perfection. Don't be skimpy on the salt and pepper, either!  I'm looking forward to making this again and urge others to do the same.

Excellent!  I was looking for an easy way to cook a good filet...this was very easy and tasty!  For the wine I used a bottle of italian red that we received as a gift. Served it with lobster tails and rosemary-roasted potatoes...will definately make again.

The recipe is perfect as is, but the directions are not complete for novice cooks. Always let beef rest for 1/2 - 1 hour before cooking. I season beef at this stage while it is sitting out. I usually rub some olive oil (1 tsp.) on beef cuts at this stage to keep them moist - especially if grilling. As for the glaze, if it is a little thin it just needs to be reduced a little more before pouring over the steaks, so remove the steaks when done to taste and turn up the fire a bit to finish reducing the glaze. It is not a gravy or a sauce, it is a glaze. Perfection!

I have made this recipe repeatedly and it is one of our favorites.  I have made it exactly like the directions with good results.  However, I prefer to cook the steaks and allow them to rest while I make the sauce.  I cook the sauce until it starts to thicken like a syrup and immediately pour it over the steaks and serve.  Wonderful!

I have made this 4 times now and each time has been perfect!  I have never had a problem with the vinegar overpowering the meat, if anything, I go heavier on the wine.   Done correctly, the result will be a tender, MEATY flavored steak.  If you don't like steak on its own, then follow those who have made changes.  We like tender, flavorful steak; left alone, this recipe performs.  Also, I buy our steak when it is "special today" at the market.  My friend who grew up working at a butcher shop taught me that the aging on a steak (the browning of the juices in the package) actually makes it more tender.  Now if it is green, walk away!

This is simple and comes out great! I've made this a few times and never once had a complaint. I followed the recipe as is and wouldn't change anything. But be sure to start with the meat at room temp.

Since everyone else is changing the recipe, I'll throw in my two cents. 
1). Pan sear the steaks to taste in butter& olive oil. (this is the way Ruth's Chris Steakhouse does it. 
2). Deglaze the pan with the wine/balsamic mixture. 
3). Simmer and allow the sauce to reduce by half. 
4). Drizzle over filet to taste. 
This is just a slight variation of a Classic French Sauce.

I followed suggestions already posted - 1/2 cup quality balsamic (I used pomegranate balsamic, it was delicious), 1/4 cup dry sherry, heaping tablespoon brown sugar, and 1 minced garlic clove. I cooked the sauce separately until it was syrupy. Let the filets rest at room temp for 45 mins or so (30-60 mins is good), then seasoned with sea salt and fresh ground black pepper on both sides. Cooked on med/high heat for 1 min on each side, then about 4 mins with the saute pan covered (for medium rare). Added about a tbsp of crumbled blue cheese and broiled for a minute or so. Then, drizzled the sauce on it. Had asparagus and mashed potatoes with it. Absolutely phenomenal.

Very good. At the end after the steaks are removed add a pat of butter (or a little more if you like) to the sauce and swirl it around just until melted then spoon it over the steaks. Even better!

I was looking for a quick, easy filet recipe and decided to give this one a try, with a few changes.  The ratio of wine to vinegar seemed way off and the technique suggested wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  Here's what I did differently: 1) took the meat out of the 'fridge a little over an hour before cooking time 2) seasoned liberally w/ s&p right before putting into into the med-high skillet for 3 mins per side 3) removed the meat and let it rest 4) deglazed the skillet with 1/2 cup red wine (I had bottle of Valpolicella ripasso open, so I used that) until reduced to about half 5) added 1 T balsalmic, 1 clove garlic (chopped), and juices from the resting meat and  simmered for 1-2 mins 6) added 1 T butter & added s&p to taste (mostly just p needed) 7) returned the meat to the skillet and basted it repeatedly for 1-2 minutes 8) plated filets and drizzled with sauce.

After cooking the steaks, I removed them from the pan and set them aside. I reduced the heat to medium low and added 1/3 c. of balsamic, 1/3 c. red wine, sliced mushrooms, and 1/2 tsp. of cumin. I let the sauce reduce for about 15 minutes and then added 1 Tbsp. of butter. I put the steaks back into the pan for a couple of minutes to bring them back up to temperature. Delicious!!!!!!!!!!

I let my filets rest while I prepared all of the other parts of my meal, approximately 1 hour, helps keep the meat tender, like others have said. Then I salt(sea salt) & peppered them. I decided to pan fry them, as called for in the recipe, and they turned out beautiful. (Thank God, since they where Omaha filets) I did not cook the steaks in the balsamic glaze. I listened to the other reviewers, and I'm glad I did. I doubled the amount of balsamic, added a bit of brown sugar & garlic, used merlot and doubleed it, & reduced it on the stovetop for about 10 minutes until it was kinda thick, I started this before putting the filets on at all. After the filets had cooked, a poured the glaze over them, and it was amazing. My better half can't wait for our next anniversary!

Made this recipe last night and loved it. We had to make a few improvisations so I only gave it 4 stars but made as the recipe entails it would probably be just as good. We could not for the life of us find fillet mignon in our regular market so we picked some nice thick boneless steaks. We also added brown sugar and a little bit of garlic to the balsamic reduction. We also removed the steaks when they were done cooking and crumbled some blue cheese on them and stuck them for a few minutes under the broiler. While they broiled and the cheese melted we let the reduction cook down it bit as it was a bit watery. An excellent recipe and so easy! I will make it again!

We really enjoyed this sauce.  I double the sauce and simmered in a pan until it had decreased by half.  I also added a heaping T of brown sugar and two garlic cloves.  I marinated the steaks in some of the sauce before Bbqing, than poured some over the finished steaks, excellent!

...WOW... This was GREAT! The people that said this tasted like vinegar must of use Red wine VINEGAR.  Theirs not even a hint of vinegar it all burn off and leave this AMAZING tasting sweet syrup. (We also cooked it on the side for a lil over ten minuets (Defiantly  double it up because we poured it over our potato's)  I broiled my steak (preference of course)    But i can't imagine anything more complimenting than this sauce. This and "Broiled Red potatoes" (From this site) mixed with some candles and chocolate covered, cream filled strawberries. Made a Great dinner for me and my wife.

This was fantastic.  I will however say that it took longer for the filets to cook than recipe called for but I think it was because they were really thick and I've never cooked them indoors before.  I browned in skillet for a minute or two per side and then added 1/2 cup red wine and 1/2 cup balsamic as I was making 4.  I minced 2 cloves of garlic and added to skillet as well.  I covered and cooked for 12 minutes turning occasionally.  My sauce was reducing too quickly even though I had the heat on medium and I was concerned about this so I put the meat on a baking sheet and finished the meat in the oven.  Added gorgonzola per another reviewer right before they were done.  I then added more red wine to the skillet and cooked that down a bit and added 2-3 tbls of brown sugar and 4 tbls of butter and let it thicken while the filets were resting.  Plated the meat and poured glaze over top.  This was so tender and so delicious.  Restaurant quality for sure.

We had this for dinner tonight and it was FANTASTIC!! I took the advice of others and let the filet rest for an hour before putting under the broiler and after it was done. It was the most tender steak I have ever made! Thank you Imvintage for the advice. Made the balsamic glaze with a little garlic powder and added 1 tsp. worcestershire sauce and turbinado sugar. Reduced the glaze and served over the filet at the table. My husband raved and said this was restaurant quality. Served it with cheesy potatoes, grilled brussel sprouts, and a mix of brown and black rice. Delicious!

Thanks to the good advice to the previous reviewers...

I took a little advice from others, I took the meat out about 30 minutes ahead of time, I grilled the meat on the grill with a little seasoning.  I started the reduction about 30 minutes before the meat would be done, so that it would have plenty of time to reduce.  I added a large pinch of brown sugar, double the balsamic and used a Merlot for the red wine.

Once I pulled the steaks off the grill, I let them rest.  Then, I added Feta cheese to the top, broiled until melted, then drizzled with the reduction.  It was just what I was looking for!

See my pic for the result.

This was very good!  I liberally seasoned with kosher salt, fresh pepper and garlic powder about 1/2 hour before cooking.  I seared the filets in a garlic infused olive oil, took them out, added fresh chopped garlic and 1/2 cup balsamic and 1/4 cup red wine with a little sugar.  Brought to a boil and then lowered heat and added filets.  I also added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce up.  It came out really good.

Not bad, but should have seared and made the glaze seperately.  Cooking meat in the sauce permeates the entire cut of meat, rather than serve as an accent.  Also, I used some butter to sear the steak and the flavor was very good.  Lastly, letting the sauce cool a bit while keeping the steak warm (say in an oven), will make the glaze thicker!

Awesome and simple!  Stayed true to the recipe but made sure my steaks were at room temp. before cooking and while they rested after cooking (under foil) I added a pat of butter to the sauce reduction.  It added a nice gloss and richness to the sauce which I lightly drizzled over the filets!  As good as a 5 star restaurant!

I can only rate the glaze, because I cooked the steak the way I always do (after letting it come to room temp, I sprinkled with salt and pepper and broiled in the oven).  The glaze was really good but not as great as most of the reveiwers thought.  I love the balsamic/red wine combo so I think I was hoping for better. 4 out of 5 stars is pretty good though, which the glaze was- pretty good and something I might make again.  Thank you!

Wow...this was fabulous and made the meat so tender.  I would have thought that the balsamic would have reduced down a little thicker, but it could have been because I was a little short.  I did warm the meat up before I cooked it, I cut down the cooking time a bit because we like med rare, and I let it rest for 10 min.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I made this differently than the recipe stated, but it was amazing!!  First I preheated a cast iron skillet until it was smoking hot.  Meanwhile I seasoned the steaks with salt and pepper.  I wrapped a piece of bacon around the steaks.  Seared them both on all sides (minute or less per side).  Then I popped them a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes or so.  Set the steaks out to rest, and made the glaze in the skillet adding some garlic.  Just so you know, your kitchen will get smoky doing this, but my husband said it was totally worth it.  Best steak I've ever had or made.  Taste your balsamic too before adding sugar as some reviewers suggested.  Mine is sweet on its own, so I had no need for it.  I think it has something to do with quality??  I also check the sales and buy good when I can.

This recipe was amazing exactly as its written.  I don't normally cook meat on the stove, but this has changed my way of thinking.  As others suggested, I doubled the liquid.  My husband has already asked when we are having it again.

This is the first time I'm not happy with the outcome of a recipe on this site!
Even though I'm NOT a chef, I know how to follow directions and I'm always open for suggestions. So far all recipes I tried on this site turned out just fine.
NOT THIS TIME...!
We just finished our meal (supposed to be a romantic candle light dinner!!!), and I feel like I have to express my disappointment in this sauce right away!
I followed all directions (and some of the suggestions), yet my husband and I both agreed that this is definitely NOT a keeper...
Usually a sauce is supposed to UNDERLINE the taste of the meat, NOT to overpower is. Not here! 
We won't make this again. Sorry!

Like others, I prepared the steaks separately from the balsamic glaze. I doubled the glaze, and used a cab/shiraz blend for the wine and a good quality balsamic vinegar.  I reduced it a little further than suggested, as I wanted a really thick sauce.  I spooned it over each steak.  The plating was beautiful and the glaze was five-star quality.

My glaze suggestions for those who aren't impressed: 1) use QUALITY balsamic vinegar; 2) choose a wine you actually enjoy drinking.  If you choose old acidic swill, just to get rid of it, you probably won't care for the same taste in your sauce, either; and 3) try adding garlic to taste and a teaspoon or so of brown sugar.

I liked this so much that I'm not afraid to cook my steaks with the glaze next time.

My glaze wasn't really a glaze at all....Beginner, and not sure why I couldn't get it to thicken but overall the flavor was still there...Will try it again soon!

I am only rating the sauce because I grilled my filets.  This was delicious & SO easy!! I really didn't think a sauce with only 2 ingredients could turn out so good. The last few times I've made this, however I did add 1 tbsp. of brown sugar & 1 tbsp. butter after the sauce had reduced by half. With the modifications it was definitely a "5"!

We tripled this glaze recipe, added 2 table spoons of brown sugar and a little corn starch to thicken it..... and WOW is all I can say. We ended up serving it over some KC strip steaks, red garlic mashed potatoes, and bacon rapped green beans and WOW WOW WOW. One of my favorite meals I have ever made!!!!  I can't wait to make this again!

This is my first time reviewing a recipe.  This was excellent.  A true taste sensation!  I doubled the recipe using a lovely 2007 shiraz.  Reduced it down until it was syrup and added a teaspoon of butter to make it a bit silkier.  Wrapped my filets in bacon and pan seared for 5 minutes each side.  Topped with medallions of herbed chevre and drizzled with the glaze.  Served with oven roasted red potatoes and sauteed spinach in olive oil and garlic.   It was outstanding!  Thanks for the recipe!

Phenomenal!  AMAZING and super wonderful.  Let the meat rest out of the refrigerator (seasoned with the salt and pepper) for at least 30 minutes. Do not overcook. To test filet for doneness do not cut into it...do a touch test with your finger.  It should yield gently to the touch for medium rare steak which is the preferred way to serve filet mignon.    I served these with mashed potatoes, crusty sourdough bread (to sop up this DELICIOUS glaze) and a green salad.

Very good!  I used regular steak, filet mignon probably would have been too expensive for me.  After reading the reviews I did let the meat sit out for about half an hour before cooking it.  I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar and a tablespoon of butter to the red wine/balsamic vinegar sauce, and I cooked the sauce separately.  I used Bully Hill for the wine.  This was so.  Good.  I doubled the sauce and had some on the side for dipping.  I paired it with Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce from this site; obviously with a balsamic base to both they went really well together!  Also served with a cheesy garlic bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was just okay. The cooking suggestion (and warming to room temp suggestions by readers) for the filet itself was good. However, 4 minutes on each side for a 1 inch steak I think would have been closer to medium than medium rare - this was about the right time for our 1.5 inch steaks for medium-rare.  (NOte: if you decide to try a Foreman Grill, time is MUCH shorter, as we found out with one experimental overcooked steak - perhaps a total of 3.5-4 mins for medium. Also would need a marinade so as not to dry out.)

Per other readers suggestions, we did not cook the steaks in the sauce, but deglazed the pan with it afterwards. 
Also per other suggestions, I added a bit of brown sugar and garlic.  However, after reducing the sauce by half to make it syrup, I found it too sweet, so MY suggestion is to NOT add brown sugar if you are using a GOOD red wine and a decent balsamic vinegar in a reduction sauce.  Plenty of sweetness there.

It could have used more garlic as well - I added half a large clove to a doubled recipe of the sauce, and could not discern its flavor.

I think this is generally the type of sauce to go with for filet mignon, as a winey-beefy glaze is ultra yummy - but this recipe needs a bit of tooling.  Will try again another time with modifications.

I'm sorry but I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I was hesitant about panfrying expensive filet mignon.  I thought the sauce sounded too good to be true with only vinegar and wine.  The results were disappointing; tough filet and overpowering flavors of vinegar and wine.

This was simply awful.  What a waste of a filet.  The sauce was too overpowering, and it had a sickening sweet taste to it.  I made this for my husband (who eats everything) and he thoght it was "weird".  Will not make again!

Tried this for a Valentine's Day dinner for my honey - DELICIOUS! I took IMVINTAGE's suggestion (and a few of my own) and it was seriously one of the best meals of our lives. I doubled the balsamic (and not the wine), added brown sugar and minced garlic, and reduced to syrupy consistency. Also topped with Garonzola cheese and broiled just before drizzling the glaze. The real key was in how I cooked the filets.  First allowed the steaks to sit out for about a 1/2 hr to an hour before I salted and peppered them liberally.I then baked the 1 1/2 thick filets FIRST inthe oven @275 degrees until internal temp reached just under 130 degrees (on a broiler rack over a cookie sheet). I next pulled them out (and allowed them to rest for 10 minutes (while heating oven to broil, and skillet to sear). Next I seared the steaks in a skillet with a little canola oil, 1-2 min per side (I did both in the same pan at the same time). Then I topped with cheese and broiled for just a few minutes until the cheese began to melt. Cooking the steak this way resulted in a perfect (and I mean PERFECT) medium rare to medium steak, edge to edge. It was the best steak I've ever eaten and will be cooking this meal for friends as soon as I can just. To have them experience it! Thanks All Recipies community!!!

Those who thought this too vinegar-y did not have quality Balsamic Vinegar. Balsamic Vinegar made by D'Avolio is aged 18 years and is sweet and full bodied; it is so good thatI almost would drink it like a fine wine!

This was our Valentine dinner and it turned out really special.  What made this a 5 star recipe was broiling the goat cheese on top.  Like others suggested, I let the steak rest before and after cooking on the stove top.  While steak was resting I made the glaze using Merlot, balsamic vinegar, garlic and about 1 T. of butter.  Let it reduce to thick and syrupy and then drizzled over the steak.  Thank you, Linda W. for an awesome recipe that I would be proud to serve on any special occasion!

I had to give this three stars bc I think the original recipe was ok.  I followed other reviewers advice and added brown sugar (splenda brand) and light butter to taste.  Without the brown sugar and butter, I think this sauce was too tangy/biitter.  With the changes, it was definitely 4.5 stars!

We grilled our steaks while I prepared the sauce on the stove.  I admit, I was very worried about this sauce being very vinegary because our whole house smelled of vinegar.  I did add in 1T of brown sugar.  Our guests just raved over this sauce.  They couldn't believe the flavor with just a few ingredients.  Paired this with "creamy green beans parmesan" and "garlic angel hair pasta" all from this site.  GREAT DINNER!

Great recipe! I followed other recommendations and doubled the glaze and added a bit of brown sugar and garlic. I also seasoned the filets with a steak seasoning mix and let rest for an hour prior to cooking. I initially reduced the glaze in a separate pot while I seared the steak on all sides to seal in the juices. Then I followed the recipe pretty much as is except I reduced the time to 3 minutes on each side and finished with glaze with a pat of butter once the steaks had been removed. I served over a bed of carmelized onions. Great quick meal that tastes like it took hours to make! Will definitely make again maybe next time with a bit of blue or gorgonzola cheese.

I made this last night for Valentine's dinner- and it was FABULOUS. I did not have wine, but I used beef broth, and I doubled the glaze recipe. I let the steaks rest for an hour, and we used Montreal steak seasoning to season them. I am so impressed at how simple it was, but SO flavorful. Make sure you give the glaze enough time to thicken- it took at least 30 minutes. Will definitely make again!

This glaze was so good, I think this just put the meal over the top. I did like others have suggested and cooked the Filet and the glaze seperately and then I threw it together.  My husband loved this.  He said that it was best he's had in a long time. This will be made again but only on special occasions.

My husband and I like our steaks medium well so it took a little longer than the recipe said but it was still perfect! I doubled the sauce - added garlic and brown sugar and tossed in some onions and mushrooms I had left over from dinner the other night. This will be my go-to steak recipe!

I took the advice of another reviewer and seasoned the steaks, then let them sit out of the fridge for about 20-30 minutes before cooking them.  I also doubled the sauce and added a pinch or two of brown sugar to it so it wasn't so overwhelmingly sour.  I second the idea of serving the sauce in little cups to go alongside each person's steak serving, so they can use as much or at little as they like.  This is a very easy yet delicious recipe.  I will definitely make again and again!  Thanks Linda W!  :)

This was very delicious.  I am normally not into the lean meats but the glaze definitely definitely made the meal.  As per many suggestions, I used the garlic (4 cloves) and the 2 tbsp's of brown sugar to add to the reduction.  The sauce came out really sweet but that was my fault for using port wine.

This is a favorite.  Always turns out fabulous, the wine/balsalmic is a perfect compliment to the meat.  Quick, easy, delicious.  

I always use Trader Joe's 10 year aged balsamic.  I also double the amount of wine & vinegar, and cook down to thicken the "sauce" after meat is cooked. 

I serve filets a top "Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe" http://sidedish.allrecipes.com/az/GrlicMshdPttsScrtRcip.asp with the thickened wine-vinegar "gravy" drizzled over everything.

This is my perfect "having guests over for dinner on a weeknight" meal.  Looks and tastes super impressive and is so simple to prepare.

We really enjoyed this recipe and didn't find the vinegar to be overpowering. We did cook a little longer to get to medium. I would have liked to have more of a sauce though......

This meal made my New Year's!  I had tender center Angus filets and used rich balsamic vinegar and our favorite Lambrusco.  I added a touch of thyme and was rewarded with the juiciest melt-in-your mouth filets.

MUST TRY!  I didn't follow the original recipe, but added garlic and brown sugar per other reviews and OMG this was amazing!  I also browned the steaks in the pan first and finished in the oven (like I always do) and reduced the sauce seperately (also doubled the sauce). Very sexy meal!

I think  1/2 tsp of pepper in the sauce plus the pepper on the steaks (I season mike with salt/pepper AND garlic) overpowers only 2 steaks, plus the sauce had TOO much bite of vinegar and it came out a bit thin the first time. 2nd time tweaks: I reduced the pepper to 1/4 tsp and added 2 TB of sugar to the sauce and it was much better. The sugar took down some of the bite and when it carmelized it make the sauce more like  a glaze and not just a reduction. The rating is for the as written version. For me it is a keeper with the added sugar, and I also serve it topped with a little blue or goat cheese. One poster said there is no need to add sugar if you use GOOD balsamic vinegar.. While that is true.....GOOD balsamic vinegar is also very expensive. I used good red wine (drink the rest with the steak!) but grocery store balsamic....so even the middle of the road stuff (better grocery store balsamic) has some bite to it.So...the 4 is an average.I give it a 3 as written and a 5 half the pepper and adding sugar. It was a big hit here as version two.

The steak was good, but the sauce never really "glazed" properly.  We cooked the steaks for 3 minutes on each side in for our desired doneness.  I also added 1T of brown sugar to the sauce to help it turn into a glaze.  Next time we make this, I will probably let the sauce cook down a bit more after removing the meat.

We made this for Valentines day dinner and it was PERFECT! The sauce is fantastic, we reduced it down to a thicker sauce and added a pinch of brown sugar and mmm good. We followed the time exactly, 1 min sear on each side then 4 mins on low on each side and it was a great medium rare steak.

I wish I had a time machine so that I could undo ruining two beautiful filet mignons. The meat ended up being chewy and tough. The balsamic vinegar and wine was too sweet and took away any flavor of meat. I tried giving this 0 stars but for some reason the rating system won't let me.

EASY and tastes wonderful!   used a 60% 40% wine/vinegar balance instead of 50/50  steak was so tender you probably could have dropped the knife through it. WILL do again

This was DELICIOUS!! I read a lot of the reviews and took a little from each. I doubled the wine and vinegar and reduced in a small saucepan on the side with a little garlic and brown sugar. I had some Zinfandel on hand (not white zin, the dark red kind). I did the filets in a grill pan on the stove. Just seasoned with kosher salt and ground pepper. The sauce tasted horribly vinegary. I didn't like it at all. Soooo THIS IS KEY -- I took the steaks out to rest then poured the sauce into the hot grill pan to deglaze it ... O.M.G.!!!! Absolutely fabulous. We had French bread with our meal and couldn't stop dipping!!! The flavor and texture changes radically when combined with the hot pan drippings. It becomes this rich flavorful slightly sweet incredibly delectible sauce of love.  Best filet EVER, HANDS DOWN!!! I didn't have a lot of extras around so I grilled some onion with a little butter and garlic and had some French's Fried onions left from christmas, so I topped the steaks with the onion stuff mixed together then the glaze. I am going to make this for my father-in-law's birthday next month... if I can wait that long!!

Absolutely delicious! I did follow the advice of a few other reviewers, however. I browned the steaks in a little olive oil, then put them under the broiler. I made the glaze in the pan that where I had browned the steaks, and let it simmer quite a while to thicken. I also added about a half a tablespoon of brown sugar. Everyone loved it!

Add a Little flair; rub steaks with olive oil, sea salt or kosher salt, ground black pepper, fresh garlic and fresh chopped rosemary.  Heat desired pan, put steaks in, add julienne red onions and sliced mushrooms.  Add desired red wine (I used Burgundy) and balsamic vinegar (I used Sotto Voce Spicy Balsamic Vinegar) Flip Steaks, lower heat, reduce sauce, wait until steaks reach 120, finish with butter (optional).  Great!

good glaze, very balsamic!  I added 2 T brown sugar, 1 T margarine, 1 T cornstarch and cooked it in a small sacuepan as we BBQ-ed the filets.  My husband really liked it, I think I'd use more wine and less vinegar next time (1/4 c vinegar 3/4 c wine)

Oh my goodness this was fabulous! I made it for my fiance for Valentines Day and we both loved it. I read other reviews and made a few changes based on them. I started the sauce in a separate pan and doubled the wine and balsamic vinegar. I also added minced garlic and 2 T.  of brown sugar. After cooking the steaks 1 min on each side, I added the sauce and reduced the heat to low. My steaks were pretty thick, so I cooked them longer than 4 min on each side but they were still very tender and could be cut with a butter knife. I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again the next time I make filet mignon!

I was not a big fan of this, partly because I couldn't make the sauce thicker (reducing it separately didn't work). I added garlic and brown sugar as a reviewer suggested, but the sauce was just too sour I think for our taste.

Delicious.  I added a bit of brown sugar and garlic to the glaze as some suggested and it took the tang away and was great.   My filet was very thick so it took double the cook time.

I have made this recipe three times, and it is oustanding. I use a 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar and and 1/2 cup of red wine. After I remove the steaks from the pan, I add 2 tsps. of brown sugar and 1 T of butter and cook the sauce down for three minutes. I serve extra on the side!

I love the taste of this rich glaze.  I make this quite often.  I always double the wine and balsamic b/c of the delicious sauce.  The last time I made it a added a lb. of sauted mushrooms to the sauce then when the beef was cooked to my likeness (very rare) I removed the steaks and cranked up the heat on the glaze for a bit unitl it reduced further and became nice and thick.  I serve the extra glaze in a gravy boat on the side for guests to use as they wish.  So Yummy.

I loved this recipe for its simplicity. I only have one suggestion, use a good red wine. The one I used was too sweet  a chiraz. Thats the only thing I would reccomend. I will try again with a dry red wine.

I was sorely disappointed in this.  I love filet and I love balsamic vinegar, so I thought it would be a match made in heaven.  Not so much...  The balsamic completely overpowered the filet, which is such a heavenly meat, it begs for its own flavors to be showcased.  Very, very disappointing,

Excellent, yet simple recipe.  I've made this dish on a couple of occasions and it turned out great every time.  Instead of filet mignon, I used top sirloin steak and it turned out very good.  If you want your steak well done, it will take more than 4 minutes to cook the steak on each side.  I will definitely make this dish again.

Just got done eating this filet mignon... and I must say... THIS WAS AMAZING!  Definitely mouth watering and delicious!  I followed the advice from previous reviews about adding brown sugar to the balsamic/wine mixture.  I added roughly a tablespoon of it.  I used a different kind of wine though, which was Riunite Lambrusco.  Simply wonderful!  My b/f said it was awesome.  So, its definitely a keeper ;)

This was a great recipe.  I had six oz. filets, so I cooked them for 6 minutes on each side.  I added garlic powder to the salt and pepper that I sprinkled on, and I used beef broth instead of red wine.

Delicious!  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and carmelized onions, garlic and mushrooms.  I doubled the recipe and added some brown sugar.  I also browned the filets in another pan and added to the glaze after browning to finish cooking.  Absolutely divine.  Like eating in a five star restaurant.  Will definitely make again.

This was such an easy recipe and I only made a few changes that really made it wonderful. At the advice of other reviewers I sauteed some onion and two cloves of garlic in a separate pan until slightly browned and then added the balsamic and wine with a pinch of sugar. I simply let this cook down a bit and then served this on the side because I didn't want to take a chance and end up ruining the staek if noone liked it. It turns out everyone decided to just pour it over anyway it was so good. SO easy!

This was delicious!  I was a little nervous about using red wine because I am not a huge fan of it, but mixed with the balsamic vinegar, it was delicious.  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much.

This recipe is wonderful!!! It was fast, flavourful and great with the sides suggested- red potatoes and asparagus.  Don't forget to use fresh bacon to wrap the filets, and any really tender cut will do- I used a NY Striploin cut in half as it was thick, and wrapped them in bacon- 
TRY THIS ONE SOON!!!

Steam plus too long a cook-time ruined a good filet making it too tough  for my taste. I'll stick with smoking over a fire (if we ever get out from under the snow here!) The glaze was ok on the meat, but I drizzled the rest over my salad & that was gooood.

SIMPLY AMAZING! DID double up the sauce recipe..added minced garlic to it too.  Pan seared steaks but did not cook in balsamic reduction.  Oh..I added the steak pan drippings to the balsamic reduction!! 
Topped steaks with small amt crumbled blue cheese, quickly broiled that and drizzled some of that balsamic awesomeness over steak and veggies to serve! 
(I just couldn't bring myself to risk cooking the steaks IN the sauce- was afraid to ruin steaks)  
This was so delicious...my husband said it put the 5 star restaurants to shame! Ha!

Guess I am old school but like plain old Filet Mignon.  This is such a tender steak....sauce too much.  I read the reviews and added butter and brown sugar to the sauce - wrong.   I should have stuck to the original recipe and maybe would have liked better.

the key to any good piece of steak is to always start with your meat at room temperture.  the balsamic glaze is wonderful.

This was amazing!  I followed the advise of other reviewers and added brown sugar and butter to the sauce, prepared in a separate pan, and spooned over meat at serving time.  Hubby says it was restaurant quality!  I used Chianti, as that was the only red wine we had available.  It was delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Very good recipe.  Next time I'll reduce the sauce a little more, I prefer a thicker sauce. DH thought it was a bit too much balsamic though I liked the balsamic amount.

These were to die for.. After letting them set out at room temp for about an hour, I seared the filets in a screaming hot cast iron skillet for abt 1 min per side, I did use a little evoo. covered the skillet , LOOSLY ( too prevent oven splatter) with foil and put in the oven for abt 5 minutes at 425, meanwhile, I made the balsamic glaze using the addition of a little sugar and garlic as suggested by others, melted the gorgonzola under the broiler for just a few seconds..so delicious..

Easy, easy, easy.....great taste.  As long as you purchase good quality meat, you can't go wrong.  I added a little brown sugar to the sauce (just sprinkled it on) based on previous reviews.  It was the BEST.  I live in an area where it is really windy and difficult to barbeque.  No problem...just cook it on the stove.  A great, very easy recipe.  P.S. My boyfriend thinks I am amazing after eating this steak!

I was looking for a nice filet mignon recipe to serve my husband that was not plain and ordinary.  This recipe was perfect!  Quick, tasty, and different!  I added garlic (only because garlic makes everything better, right?) and a little brown sugar to cut the acidity.  The sauce was so tasty I added some to the sauteed mushrooms and onions I made as a side dish.  Awesome!

Use this wonderful glaze all the time now. We seldom would have a steak without having the glaze as a side item for dipping.

Very Good!!!! I had a hard time getting over the "frying" of a steak.  Charcoal grilling is the only way I like steak, but WOW.  Simple & easy, but make sure you sear all the edges to keep juice of meat in like the expert stated. We used sirloin that was very thick & cooked the time suggested & they were cooked more than we'd like.  It wasn't bad though since they were so thick.  I'd cook only 1 - 2 min if normal thickness because we like ours med rare & that should work. I think after taking steak out I'll try to reduce the sauce some before serving, otherwise use half as much since we won't be cooking as long & it made so much.

I was a little nervous at first because I had never cooked a filet on the stovetop but it was the most amazing filet I have had in along time.  I read all the reviews first and took some suggestions.  I double the wine/balsamic mixture.  I added garlic, brown sugar, and butter.  Our cuts of meat were thicker so I had to cook them longer.  The reduction was so good.  I made it for Valentines Day and my boyfriend loved it too.  I made with oven roasted red bliss potatos and green beans.

Made this for Valentine's Day.  I took the other reviewers' suggestions and seared my filet prior to grilling. I used the pan that I had sear the filet in to make the reduction sauce.  I also added about 3 cloves of garlic and doubled the recipe.  My husband had a fit. He asked me if I had more of the sauce to put on his asperagus.  It was well worth the effort and will make this again.

I was skeptical of this recipe, but I tried it anyway because it got so many good reviews. I followed the recipe exactly.  Both the wife and I were very disappointed.  First of all, steaks should not be cooked using this method since it essentially produces a boiled piece of meat void of any complexity or character.  I was expecting some type of synergy from the oversimplified glaze, but no, it hit the palate exactly like vinegar and wine.  I was more satisfied with my sides of asparagus and potatoes, which is pretty sad considering this started out as a promising tenderloin.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I would change is after addibng the balsamic/wine to cover and cook 3 to 3 1/2 Min. per side for medium rare.  At 4 min, mine came out between med rare and medium.  
You could samve steaks in a oven at 200 while the glaze reduces.   Great flavor, you really do not need to do anything else.

EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT!!!! I followed the recipe exactly, it's perfect as is. For a side I tossed spinach in the same skillet (after cooking & removing the steaks) and served the wilted spinach over orzo pasta as my side. No butter or brown sugar needed here. This dish is sweet, savory and saucy!! Thank you Linda

This was good but not great. It was a little too strong on the balsamic for my taste (and I like balsamic). I wish I had used some cheaper meat instead of getting the good stuff. But it was nice to try something different. Thanks!

Anybody that tried this, and didn't like it, and though that it was 'too vinegary' did not use balsamic vinegar. Please don't rate a recipe, if you cannot use the ingredients in the recipe. Is something wrong with you?

This was good, but the steaks were still a little dry and lacked some flavor. I think next time I will try and thicken the sauce and make more of a gravy.

Wow!  These were soo soo good.  I don't like to cook meat in sauce at all so I made the sauce separately (adding a tbsp of brown sugar) boiling it until thickened a bit.  Put with browned onions and mushrooms and served with the sauce for dipping.  AWESOME!!!

I'm very surprised this has such high ratings. With 6 people here, NO one liked it. All we tasted was vinegar and wine. The sauce was sooo overwhelming that I couldn't even finish mine. My husband tried to doctor it up for me but it was just too late at that point. I'm greatful I didn't make this for company.

Wow made this today for my husband's birthday. Agree with many other reviews to double the wine and balsamic also added a good pinch of brown sugar. I let the steaks reach room temp then I seared each steak for 1 min each side (med/high) the lowered the heat and cooked each side for 4 mins covered with a lid, let them sit for about 5 mins so juices could settle. Perfect medium steaks! Then I drizzled the sauce over each steak before serving. I made grilled green beans and blue cheese potatoe pancakes to go with it, excellent. This is a keeper.

1/4c of Balsamic Vinegar was WAY too much.  All I could taste was vinegar.  To even come close to a recipe like this that would make it 100% better would be to just marinate the steak in Italian dressing for 2-4 hours.

I gave this 4 stars and not five because the recipe did not warn people about rectifying the use of a sweet vinaigrette and a sweet wine.  I used what I had on hand and the sweetness of both ingredients proved to be a major player in the success of the sauce.  This caused a potential disaster, but it was fixable (with amazing results).  Luckily, per previous reviews, I chose to make the sauce separate from the steak, and serve for dipping.  Therefore I had the opportunity to balance the sauce and even use steak drippings to do so.  As I said, I had on hand only a very sweet wine and very sweet vinaigrette: an excellent Zin, but very fruity and sweet. , and Costco's staple Balsamic Vinaigrette (which is very sweet also).  So the sauce was overpowering and needed balance.  First, I altered the amount of the Balsamic Vinaigrette per previous reviews...but doubling it seemed too much, so I added 150% of what the recipe called for.   When I reduced it and it was too sweet, I added 1/2 cup of homemade beef stock, 1/4 cup white vinegar (trust me, it needed it), 1 clove crushed garlic (per previous reviews), and pepper to taste.  Reduced again.  I added the steak drippings and even reduced again.  Total reduction was roughly 85%.  The result was incredible and loved by all (I served 4). Thick and flavorful. It was wonderful enough that I'd reproduce in an instant, even with my additions. Thanks for the recipe, and for those of us who only stock sweet wine, it still works.  Thanks!

I have never had a better filet mignon!  I made mine with 6oz slabs and it took more like 20 minutes to get it to the correct level of medium-well that I prefer.  Served with country-style mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus...  omg it's just heaven!

Amazing! I have always been scared of cooking something like this and ruining it, but this recipe was so simple and so good! 4 minutes per side was perfect for my husband's to be medium rare. I cooked mine a little longer and it was perfect for me. Double the sauce for sure or you'll be fighting over it! I also added a tablespoon each of butter and brown sugar as I reduced it as suggested. Thanks to the original recipe and those with the suggestions I tried. I cannot wait to try this one again.

I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts!  Cut the breasts in half and browned the chicken on both sides in half butter/half black truffle oil.  Added 1 clove garlic (minced) and 1tsp or brown sugar to the balsamic and wine.  Very good! Will try again when I get to the store to buy some filets.  SNOWED IN!

Recipe was a nice change.  I added brown sugar as some of the comments recommended, and thought it added a great flavor, reducing the acidic taste of the vinegar.  I used a nice drinking burgundy which I would normally serve with beef.  Will definitely make again!

Very happy to have read many of the reviews before making this dish. I took others advice and added garlic and a bit of brown sugar. I started the sauce in a separate pan to begin the reduction process and once the filets were browned I then added it in. For the size of filets I had, the cooking time was right on target; browned on the outside and a nice layer of pink on the inside. I don't eat red meat so I can't comment on the dish, but for those who do in my family, this recipe was a winner! Thank you Linda!!

We followed the guidelines from "naples". Seasoned the meat before letting it sit for a couple hours while we worked in the garden. Did the steaks on the grill m-rare. Reduced a white balsamic from trader J's with some left over 80's vintage claret. Not the best, best ingredients  is what I'm getting at. But good enough to make a super glaze. This is a keeper! Served with sliced Toms from the garden. salt and pep, oregano and basil, olive oil and wine vin-let sit before serving. Super easy. Thanks you all! wRock & Tanya

I didn't care for the balsamic sauce to much.  It was very vinegary and the meat was so good I didn't want to mask the great flavor.  I served the sauce on the side, and it was barely touched.  The cooking suggestions for the steak made such a yummy tender taste of meat!  I wrapped the filet in bacon and topped it with feta before the last little broil. Very tasty!

Man, I have never cooked a steak before and this turned out great! Thanks to all the reviewers before me who lent their wise words to this recipe. Let the meat rest after marinating it in salt, pepper and a mixture of roasted garlic/red pepper. Also poured some balsamic vinegar over the meat (my cut was round of eye and sandwich steak) to loosen up the meat for a bit. WARNING: If you're marinating overnight, don't pour on the vinegar until several hours before cooking. Since I didn't have any dry red wine (hey, I'm kinda underage), I simply added some brown sugar to the balsamic vinegar when cooking. It turned out delicious! My brother and I served these to our parents (it was their anniversary dinner) with a side of garlic mashed potatoes, broccoli and bruschetta. Yum yum yum. Thank you for such an easy recipe!

Total hit at my last party.  Here's how I do it.  I buy THICK steaks (1 1/2") and toss them on a very hot grill for 2 minutes each side to get some char.  Then I put them in the balsamic mix (1 cup merlot, 1 cup GOOD balsamic for every 2 steaks).  I cook them for about 20-25 minutes in that mixture then take the sauce and further reduce it over high heat for 5 minutes.  While that is happening, I take crumbled gorgonzola (thank you previous reviewer) and put it on top and broil for a minute or two to melt.  Drizzle the sauce over the top and Volia!  Great, medium-cooked steaks.  I pair with creamed spinach (search for "cheesy creamed spinach") and garlic mashed potatoes (search "Garlic mashed potatoes secret recipe").  Always good!

Good flavor, and extremely easy. I tend to like my steaks rare though, and the cooking time made my steaks come out medium, so I might cut it down to 2.5-3 minutes tops next time.

This was quick and easy, but I think the steaks I had were bigger they came out medium rare, which is to my liking not everyones! I am reducing the sauce a big more right now to pour over the other steak and eat as another meal.

Other than adding a tablespoon of brown sugar to the glaze and reducing it after the steak was cooked, I followed this recipe exactly.  I did have reservations about cooking a Filet Mignon on the stovetop but once I took my first bite they were all gone!  It was heavenly (my husband agreed) and I am looking forward to making this again.

This was DELICIOUS and I'm not much of a red meat eater. I eat red meat MAYBE once/month. I did make a couple of changes:   - I used sirloin steak because I couldn't afford filet mignon.  - I did first season the meat with adobo instead of using just salt. - I used Al Jerez (Sherry) Vinegar because I didn't have balsamic vinegar - I used Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon - I mashed one clove of garlic and rubbed it into the meat after seasoning with adobo - I doubled the wine/vinegar mixture and let the steak marinate in it overnight. - I didn't cook the steak in the sauce, I grilled it on my little George Forman grill. - I added 1 teaspoon sugar to the sauce and then let it simmer with sliced portobello mushrooms until it reduced in half - I served it with Smothered Green Beans and Honey Roasted Red Potatoes both found on this site. ABSOLUTELY SUPERB!

If anyone had ever told me that I would cook steak...STEAK...(and filet mignon at that!) covered, I would have laughed and called them lunatics.  But, OH...how delightful this dish is!  I used sherry, merely because I did not wish to open a fresh bottle of red wine.  I added 2 cloves of garlic put through a garlic press, and a scant Tablespoon of brown sugar.  Cooked the filets to medium rare, took them out to rest, reduced the sauce...MAGNIFICENT!  Thanks, from an "old dog" who has just learned a new trick!

Update:  I have now made this several times, once with a 2" rib eye steak.  This recipe is exceptional for consistent results.  It is always amazing!

Really easy and tasty.  I did double the recipe and used it with pan-seared cubes of lamb leg.  I just threw the wine and balsamic in the pan with the meat when it was almost cooked and let it simmer for a bit and then removed the meat.  It took a long time to boil the remaining liquid down to a glaze and I had to remove the excess fat from the lamb that separated out, but the flavor was amazing.  Will try again next time we splurge on good steaks!

I already gave this recpipe a great reveiw, but I forgot to mention that I topped the filets with gorganzola and put them under the broiler just long enough to melt the cheese, then drizzled them with the glaze. It was delicious!

This meal was pretty good. The combination of flavors between the Filet and the Balsamic was good. In my own opinion it was lacking something, or the glaze would have been better over a thinner cut of meat.

Okay, I made a few errors. I broiled it like someone suggested, but I didn't like how dark it looked on the outside, although the taste was still great. Also, I started my glaze way too soon and it came out just so sticky and condensed that it didn't spread well on the meet. All problems that were due to me, and not the recipe. It was my first time really cooking red meat off the grill, and def my first time making a glaze. I learned a lot though and can't wait to try it again.

Holy Moly!  We LOVED this recipe.  I took suggestions from others and added a teaspoon of garlic, two tablespoons of brown sugar, doubled the vinegar and cooked the glaze separately.  It was just out of this world yummy! I do have to agree with another reviewer that it does stink up the entire house while cooking, so beware.  However, it's worth the odor.  Even my teen boys, who had their noses stuffed in their shirts while the glaze was simmering, loved it.  This one's a keeper.  I broiled my meat and served it with caramelized Brussels sprouts (also from this site)  Great meal and surprisingly easy.

Before trying this recipe I thought the only ways to cook beef steaks were boring--grilled, broiled, not much to do to a steak.  This is a great recipe and balsamic is a favorite thing of mine to cook with.  Just for me, I find it hit or miss sometimes as to whether or not a balsamic and liquid mix is going to reduce down right, to the right consistency of glaze.  So sometimes if the filet mignon is done, but the glaze is not yet reduced to what I want it to be, I just pull the meat and let the glaze simmer a bit longer alone in the pan.  Also I always substitute beef broth for the wine and it is still very tasty.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was easy to do and turned out beautifully. I made it for Valentines Day and it was a hit. I took other peoples advice to let the steaks sit for 20 minutes out of the fridge before cooking, but then followed the recipe exactly. Very nice dish.

Oh my goodness.  I tried this recipe on Valentine's Day.  My husband and I were going out the next night and my brother and his wife were in the process of moving across the state and in with us.  She was out of town on their first married Valentine's. I made this and everyone was in awe. My brother is very hard to please and he said it's better than any steak he's ever had (quite a statement from him). My husband and I went to an exclusive winery the next night and this steak was 100% better.  I doubled the glaze and rubbed garlic into the meat.  I, also, rested the meat for about 60 minutes before cooking.

A true winner! I have made this dish twice now and it is so very impressive. I do like to add a touch of brown sugar to the mix, and cook them a little bit longer than the recipe calls for, but the cooking method is right on for a tender, melt-in-your-mouth taste. As others have stated, this is a dish that really makes you look like an expert! Thanks for the recipe.

i used flank steak, quite frankly because its cheaper! i would have like to use filet, maybe next time. i served with sauteed mushrooms and zucchini.  the balsamic glaze is so simple and so good! i also added a couple tablespoons of butter with the sauce, and what a great addition! make extra sauce so you can drizzle it over the steak. i also added it to the mushrooms and zucchini to blend all the flavors. will definitly use this sauce over and over. thanks for the great recipe!

Didn't want to pay for filet mignon, so I purchased New York steaks instead. Didn't really matter - the meat was awesome cooked like this and the glaze - oh my gosh, was it good!!! I have since used that same glaze on chicken and on salmon, with equally yummy results.

I made this using 8 oz filets so I cooked them for 8 minutes on each side, rather than 4.  They came out medium to medium well, which is exactly what I was looking for.  The filets were tasty enough on their own to not need the dipping sauce.  What an easy way to make a very elegant meal!

This recipe was terrible. I followed it to the tee and found that the steak was over cooked. I would not leave it on the oven for more than 30 seconds for each side before putting the vinegar and wine in. It didn't taste very good.

This recipe was good, but I made some minor changes that I think really enhanced it. First, I cut the filets into medallions. I browned the medallions in a little butter then patted off excess fat. I had already started to simmer the wine/viniger mix. I also added a heaping tbsp of brown suger to the mix. I then cooked the medallions on low (and covered) with the sauce. The wine mixture became a wonderful rich glaze and an elegant meal.I used the little excess sause in a dipping bowl for anyone who wanted extra. This was a huge hit.

Just an FYI for those making this recipe...the cooking time is for a medium-rare filet mignon, as that's how I personally feel a filet mignon should be cooked, not well done.  I feel if you want a well done steak, use a different cut of beef.  Filets are best done medium or medium-rare, so they cut "like buttah."  :-)

My husband has always believed that filet mignon should be eaten as is, no fancy sauces or marinades needed. I suggested we try this recipe and surprisingly he was receptive to the idea.   He really liked it and so did our dinner guests.  We will definitely make it again!  Thanks.

This is delicious! Took some tips from comments and after following recipe, removed meat from pan, then added tbsp butter and tbsp brown sugar to wine balsamic mix, let that cook for 5 minutes while topping Gorgonzola on meat and broiling til melted. Served sauce on side for dipping. Amazing!

I made this for a special "Date Night" and my husband said it was better than some of the expensive steak dinners we've had dinning out.  This was the first time I tried to cook filet at home, and it certainly will not be the last.  Thank you for this special recipe.

This was pretty good.  A tiny bit too "vinegary" for my taste, but based on the other reviews that is probably just me.  I'm more the sauteed mushroom kind of guy when it comes to filet mignon.  However, I was very pleased how perfectly cooked the meat turned out in following this recipe.

Delicious, do this exactly as written, down to the glaze with the steak at the same time covered for 4' each side, and you'll be rewarded with med rare perfection.

Very Good. Definitely worth making. I added a few extra things to add more taste such as coffee spice and maple balsamic. Delicious!

I have a pretty picky pallet I cook for and mine is pretty broad for new recipes.  We both love meat dishes, so this was one we wanted to try.  The first thing I heard was "man it smells like vinegar!"  It was the overwhelming flavor of the dish too.  Think I am going to try this again, but cutting the vinegar in half.  The meat was very tender otherwise and when eaten with horseradish it made it taste pretty good as it killed off the heavy vinegar smell and taste.

This was the best.  The only thing that I changed was adding mushrooms and garlic to the sauce.  I also cooked it 8 minutes on one side and 7 on the other. 4 minutes on each side is still pretty rare. I took it out of the pan and covered with gargonzola cheese and broiled it just until the cheese was creamy.  OMG.  My b/f said that it was the best steak that he had ever had.  It is SOOOOOOOOO easy too!

I used ribeye instead of Filet Mignon for this recipe.  I made this as a late Valentine's Day dinner and it was amazing!  For the wine I used a Cabernet Sauvignon and my wife LOVED the glaze.  Instead of the potatoes and asparagus, I made a loaded baked potato and sautéed spinach.  SO SO SO GOOD!!!!!

Easy and great. Sautéed steaks in butter and made the balsamic wine  reduction separately (replaced wine with port) earlier in the evening. Served steaks with Gorgonzola and glaze drizzled over it. Excellent!!'

I made this recipe exactly as it is written because that gives you an honest review.  The flavor is delicious and I will make this again.  I put the balsamic/red wine and brown sugar in a sauce pan and brought it to a gentle boil while my steaks were being browned.  I added the sauce to the meat , covered it and simmered it on low for 4 1/2 minutes. I used thick steaks.  After removing the steak I turned the heat up a little and reduced the liquid until it was lightly thickened.  The flavor was richer than had I not done that.  This was restaurant quality flavor.  The steak was tender and juicy as well.  Thanks for another delicious addition to my recipe box.

Seared our seasoned filets on a scortching hot cast iron skillet with a tablespoon of olive oil for just a few minutes until they developed a nice brown crust. While they were resting we just added the balsamic vinegar & cabernet to the skillet (we'd taken it off the heat) & the residual heat was enough to cause this to reduce to a nice, thick glaze. With the pan drippings incorporated this over the filets was absolute heaven!

Just made it for dinner! It was delicious!! I added 1 tbs of brown sugar, 1 tbs of butter and 1 clove of garlic to the sauce! It tasted really good however the sauce was very thin! Next time I will add creamed mushrooms to this sauce and I believe that will be 5 stars!! My husband loved the flavor but also agreed that the sauce was way too thin! But worth the try and was very easy to make!

The combination made for a unique and very tasty combo.  My boyfriend and I were both impressed and it was the first time I had ever cooked Filet Mignon.  I like my steaks well-done, and it was still tender and juicy, and very good.

I'm not much of a cook, so when my husband came home with Filet Mignon I had to look online to find the best way to cook it. I'm so happy I found this recipe! I made it last night and my husband RAVED about it, saying it was perfect - (he doesn't throw around compliments), and that it tasted JUST like the Filet Mignon he gets at Morton's Steakhouse! I have to agree, it was perfectly medium rare and with a wonderful flavor (looked just like the photo too - and was very easy). Thanks very much for submitting it!

I loved this! It was very easy to do and tasted great. If you enjoy the taste of balsamic (which my boyfriend and I love), this is perfect. I would have marinated it longer if I had the time, I'd love to have that taste soak in the meat more. I will be trying this again, with sides of steamed potatoes and carrots and red wine, this made a great dinner!

This was very good (granted I made a lot of changes). I let the filets sit out for about an hour and seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning while I baked potatoes. I mixed 1/4 cup of bal. vinegar, 1/2 cup merlot, some dried minced onion, fresh rosemary, minced garlic, and brown sugar together. I seared the filets on all sides in the pan and then added the glaze. I cooked 4 minutes on each side (covered) with the glaze, then removed the filets. I turned the heat to high and the glaze thickened pretty quickly. The meat was medium rare. I served with baked potatoes and green beans. I would definitely make this again.

This was my FIRST time to cook filet.  My husband is not a fan of vinegar so I prepared the glaze separately.  I used Marsala wine because I had some already open. I added a little brown sugar to the glaze as did other reviewers. I sprinkled both sides of the steaks with ground pepper and salt and also some peppercorn/garlic rub I had in the cupboard. I allowed the filets to rest on the counter for about 45 minutes (this made me a little nervous as I am a bacteria freak). I cooked the filets (in a touch of olive oil) following exactly the times/settings that are suggested in the recipe. They turned out FABULOUS. My husband even loved the glaze, which after it was reduced didn't have a strong vinegar taste at all. Next time I will try cooking the steaks in the sauce. I was so please with the way they turned out.

Loved the flavor and the steaks came out so tender.  I used the bacon wrapped filets you can buy in a 2 pack at Walmart.  Quick and easy!  Will repeat in the future.

GREAT RECIPE! I listened to many reviewers and  seasoned the filets with salt and fresh ground pepper and let them rest out of the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes.  THEN, I cooked them in a hot pan, except I didn't cook them in the sauce because I have never believed in cooking such a fantastic cut of meat in sauce. For the sauce, I mixed the balsamic vinegar (the better the quality, the better the sauce will turn out), red wine (used Merlot) and a generous pinch of brown sugar. Let it reduce and then served in little sauce cups alongside the filets. By allowing it to reduce, it was a little bit thicker. Will definitely make this again! It was very very easy and my boyfriend LOVED it!

I have been making this for several years now.  I did not change the recipe.  I always sit the meat out and season with pepper.  Salt dries out steak, so I omit it.  I have cooked this for many people, and everyone raves over it.  My fiance' swears it is the best steak you will ever eat.  It goes well with asparagus too.

nice flavorful steaks - didn't spend the money on filget mignon - can use on any piece of red meat, really - I like my steak with bold warm flavors so this fit the bill.  Easy to keep from blackening, too.  one of my favorites.

I have made this several times and have never been disappointed.  When i can't get to the grill this is my go to "winter" recipe for steaks when I have company.  It is always a hit and I am always asked for the recipe.  The steaks cook to the perfect medium rare stage - a no fail ... if you like balsamic do yourself  a favor and try this one!!!!  I normally serve with twice baked potatoes and either roasted asparagus or broccoli.

I don`t know if maybe it was the balsamic vinegar that I`d bought, but the wine was alright... Even so, this glaze definitely overpowers the natural (and wonderful) taste of a perfectly-cooked piece of REAL filet mignon.  If you like things "à l'américain," I'd suggest to double it and use sugar like other people did. If not, prepare the recipe as-is, without unnecessary additives (though cook your steaks separately so you get them cooked to your preference) and you`ll have a great, romantic meal!

After reading some of the other reviews, I added a generous portion of brown sugar and some garlic salt. I also reduced the sauce for about 20 minutes first. It came out absolutely amazing!

It was ok. The color looked great, the consistency looked great (added just a touch of cornstarch), but the flavor wasn't great. I tried all suggestions about letting steaks rest, broiling them and cooking the marinade separate. The wine and b. vinegar do compete. Luckily served it on the side. I prefer A1.

It was good but...  ... such a great cut of meat, I didn't think it needed the additional layer of flavor. My thought was that it may be good for sirlion or a lesser cut of steak. Maybe my balsamic was sub-par...

The sauce didn't work out for me--too watery.  However, cooking the filet on the stovetop was a great idea.  It had a great texture and was very moist.

The balsamic glaze is fabulous.  But if you want it to be super fabulous, use Merlot or Savablonc Red Wines, not a Burgandy or other. and use a 1/4 stick of butter, and sprinkle lightly Wondra Gravy thickener and whisk. Take a tea spoon and check the consistancy of your glaze.  This is a Keeper.

I did follow some suggestiona and added brown sugar and butter to the glaze. I think that may be why the sauce never thickened. The directions to cook this size meat was right on. The steaks were very moist with pink inside. I also made sure to let the steak sit out in room temperature as some advised. My husband loved it. I think my tastebuds are just not that crazy about vinegar, but nonetheless great recipe.

Loved it.  It made an amazing Valentine's Day dinner for my husband and I.  I doubled the recipe as other people has suggested I didn't care for that much sauce.  I did add some butter and brown sugar though and it was great!  A definite must for a fun dinner party.

So good!  We made this earlier tonight for Valentine's Day.  The cook times were spot on for us.  I will definitely make this again, I did add about a tablespoon of brown sugar, like others suggested.. and I think I will start the wine/vinegar a bit earlier next time to let it reduce some.  Very good!

Followed the recipe as written here - but, cooked the steak a little differently - set over to 500 and preheated the pan,  rubbed steaks with olive olive and then put on the salt and pepper, cooked 2 mins each side, put the wine and vinegar in the pain (1/2 cup each) - with 1 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp brown sugar, put back into the stove for 5 mins, and BAM - delicious.  The sauce was a little thinner than I expected, but it was absolutely a delicious Valentines Day treat for my sweetie.  Thank you for this!

Husband loved this but I was slightly disappointed....made the glaze separately as per several other reviews, but even starting it 25 mins before putting on the steaks left me with a very watery sauce. It tasted good but looked more like a very thin gravy than the sweet, syrupy dressing I was expecting.... So - nice flavours, but needs some tweaking! Served with a big helping of curly kale, which helped soak up the sauce.

The cooking instructions for this filet mignon created a perfect, medium done choice cut of meat. Wonderful. The balsamic glaze was nice, though had the propensity to slightly distract from the taste of the meat. Yet, overall, this was a great recipe deserving of 5 stars.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out perfectly.  I did sear it first on the grill before adding to the pan with the liquid.  Made it again for New Years, so simple, yet so tasty.  This was my first time to cook beef tenderloin/filet mignon and now I'm spoiled!

I am a teenage girl who just got really into cooking. i have made this twice, the first time with 4 filets and the 2nd with 1  T-bone. it was great both times and i absolutely love the glaze. After my steaks are done I pour the glaze from the pan into a bowl or cup then lather it on at the table for dinner. i am not very exact about my measuerments , i just pour on some wine and some vinegar and go. and this recipe is so fast! i can make it in less than 10 minutes, with almost no mess. its great! i would recommend it to everyone!

I really do not understand why everyone likes this recipe...I wasted a perfectly good fillet mignon by soaking it in a glaze that made it taste like sauer braten--not impressed.

I enjoyed the flavor. My husband likes his steaks more crisp on the outside. I did sear them early on, but maybe would make sure to do more of that next time before adding the sauce.

After resting the steaks (removing refrigerator chill) for 45 minutes, I followed directions exactly as written.  Not an Oh My Gosh Wow, but definately a nice change up for a different flavor to fillets.

I wraped with bacon  and  grilled my filets. Before putting them on the grill leave out of frig for a least 20 to take the chill off . I made the sauce with 1/2 cup balsamic, 1/3 red wine , 1 tbl brown sugar and 1 clove garlic minced . Let that simmer on low for about an hour . Drizzle over filets .yummmmmm

The Balsamic Glaze as good, but I cooked separately and served on the side.  The best part of this recipe was the cooking method (finished in the oven).  Actually, I think this cooking method is much more consistant than grilling.  I will make again.

I took the advice of many reviewers and grilled the steaks instead of cooking in the pan since I was afraid to mess up expensive filet! I cooked mushrooms and onions in butter in a skillet and then put them on a plate to make the reduction. After I simmered the vinegar and red wine until it was reduced, I added the mushroom/onion mixture back to the pan and topped the steaks with it when they were done. It was insanely yummy according to my husband!

This came out very tender. However, I think we would have liked it better off the grill. Also, I thought I saw on the site that other reviewers had added a bit of brown sugar to offset the strong balsamic taste. My youngest said it was sweet. I really think I would have liked it better without the sugar.

This glaze was excellent! I used a cheaper cut than filet mignon, which made no difference, I'm sure, except to my wallet.  I also subbed red wine for half of the balsamic vinegar to give a little more complexity to the sauce.  Very good!

Dissapointing.  I followed the sauce recipe as instructed, and added half a tablespoon of brown sugar and a tablespoon of butter (as some reviewers recommended).  The steaks cost me $23 so I didn't want to screw them up, we ended up broiling them and adding the sauce later.  This was just "ok".  I'm not going to spend the money to make this again.

I hate it when people change the recipe, but I altered this one, and my husband said it was the best steak he has ever had, we were both raised on cattle ranches, so that is quite a compliment Be sure to use a good quality Filet, don't chince there! I used 1/4 c brown sugar 1/4 c vinegar 1/2 c red wine Reduce over med/hi heat Sear the steak on both sides using a little of the glaze and continue to cook to the doneness you prefer. Slice the steak, but not clear through, and put on the plate and pour the glaze over it.  It is rich and slightly sweet, but still has a little kick from the wine and vinegar.  We will definitely have this again!

My girlfriend and I loved this, though I did make a few changes. First I doubled the recipe and added 2 tbsp. brown sugar and a clove of minced garlic then marinated the steaks for an hour. I then grilled the steaks on the BBQ and used the rest of the sauce to drizzle over the top along with some sauteed mushrooms. Very very good!

If I could give this 10 stars I would! My husband said this is the BEST meal I have ever made, and I consider myself a pretty good cook!  Made these for Valentine's Day and everybody loved them!  I don't ever remember my husband EVER liking any kind of sauce on his steak and he even loved it!  As others suggested I cooked the sauce separately instead of with the steaks.  The brown sugar is a MUST!  I tripled the sauce recipe and added 3 heaping Tbls. of brown sugar.  I seasoned the steaks with Montreal Steak seasoning and browned them in a pan over medium heat with olive oil and butter for approx. 2 minutes per side.  I then dropped them in a 400 degree oven for approx. 8 minutes to finish them off.  HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

I cooked my steaks first.  After removing the steaks from the pan, I made added the listed ingredients and added dried tarragon, garlic, salt and pepper.  I also added sliced mini-portobella mushrooms.  Pretty good.

Wow was this recipe a lifesaver!  Got home late and had to get a special dinner on the table in a half hour.  Followed the filet mignon directions exactly and while I kept an eye on that I threw a bag of "steamed peas" in the micro for 4 min., then cooked a Knoors butter noodle dish for 10 minutes in micro.  I served the filet mignon exactly as direted and it was delicious -would have love to have sauteed mushrooms or done other things with it but this was just great as it was.  Thanks submitter.  P.S. The sauce was delicious - mashed potatoes would have been great to use the sauce with.

Yummy. I read many reviewer's suggestions, but decided to follow the recipe exactly, and I’m glad I did. The only thing I would do differently is double the sauce. It is very good. If you are skeptical about the sauce, don’t be. I used cabernet sauvignon for the red wine. Remember the rule:  “Only cook with wines that you like and that are of the quality you would drink”.

I really loved this recipe. I made it as part of a surf n turf with a lobster tail and he devoured the steak before touching anything else on the plate. I only gave this four stars because I used some suggestions from other reviewers to add a little sugar to the sauce and double the vinegar, top the steaks with gorgonzola and broil. As written it is a good start, with modifications it was incredible with the mix of flavors.

this is great! I didn't have any red wine in the house, so i used some marsala cooking wine instead. i also cooked the steaks for a little longer. The sauce never really became a glaze, but it may be because of the cooking wine. We used the sauce to dip the steaks in because it was so good!

I was very nervous about taking such an expensive tenderloin and cutting it, then cooking stovetop but it was FANTASTIC!  I let the steaks "rest" for 30 minutes, salted, peppered, then followed the directions.  They were PERFECT!  I made it for 10 guests but such an easy recipe (and an indoor one) for 2-20 guests.

This was quite good.  I followed the recipe as written and found it to be wonderfully juicy and the sauce was good.  It did not overpower the meat.  I served this with Roasted Potatoes with Greens and Simple Feta Salad from this site and the flavors really complemented the other dishes.  Used Parmesan Puffs served with marinara sauce as an appetizer and Bananas Foster I for dessert.  Made a lovely Valentine's dinner for my darling hubby and me!

Great recipe! - I made ribeyes (hubby's fave) and doubled the sauce recipe and added two teaspoons of brown sugar.  Whatever you do, use a very DRY wine.  I used a red zin, and it was tart.  Maybe I chose the wrong wine b/c it was tart by itself anyway.  However, it looked amazing - the sauce was so dark and rich.  I simmered the sauce for about 10 minutes before adding it to the steak pan, which caramelized very well, but still had that harsh tang, and was actually burning my eyes a little if I moved over the pan.  Next time I will use a different wine, and maybe add the sauce after the steaks are done - cooking the wine mixture with the steaks also takes away the crispy edges which to me is an essential of a good steak.

I thought it would be sinful to cook a filet mignon in a pan, I prefer grilling outdoors, but hey... my money was not wasted.  This was great!  The only change I made was adding Montreal Steak Seasoning along with the fresh cracked pepper.  I also wrapped bacon around my filets.  It was easy and fast, and perfect for Valentines day.  My picky 12 year old even ate it.

Excellent recipe.  I had an extremely tasty steak dinner on the table before I finished a glass of red wine! Followed the directions exactly. Thanks for a great meal!

Awesome! In a little bit of butter I sauteed a thin slice of tomato.  I put the tomato on top of the cooked filet and sprinkled with parmesan.  I then heated the filet in the oven at 350 to just melt the parmesan. So good!

Made a huge batch for Xmas dinner party and everyone loved it.  Seasoned the steaks w/ salt, pepper and garlic powder and then added a dash of brown sugar to the liquid.  Turned out great, and super easy.

Great basic recipe.  I too made the sauce seperate and added brown sugar, then cooked some sause with the meat a few minutes before it was done.  Also I let the sause boil for a minute to make it thicker.  I served the filet with some green & red bell peppers and chopped onion, as well as the "twice baked potato" recipe, which provided the perfect compliment!  All together a great meal!

This was delicious! I used some organic safflower oil to sear the filet's on all 4 sides until browned,took them out of the pan, sauteed some shallots for a couple minutes. Added the filet back to the saute pan along with the merlot and balsamic vinegar. Thank you!

Excellent and easy way to cook filets! Any novice or beginner can make this at home. Don't be intimidated - it's so easy.  My advice is to make sure to watch it to cook until your desired level of doneness such as rare, medium, etc..

This did not turn out well.  The glaze didn't really turn into a glaze, it was very liquidy, and I felt too strong for the beef.

had high hopes, but tasted way to "vinegary"  - wasted my O&Co products on this one. Cut down on the vinegar increase the wine.

Tasty !! Husband says it's against his religion to cook filet in a pan, but WOW, this was perfect. He couldn't shut up about how great it was. Didn't use quite as much balsamic or wine, 1/8 cup balsamic and filled to a total of 1/3 with a good quality Merlot. Didn't cook the meat as long as we are R / M-R people. Easy glaze that transforms a "piece of meat" into a gourmet meal. Pair this up with  Renaissance Stuffed Mushrooms (see few changes in reviews) from this site and serve them as a side dish rather than an appetizer. Outstanding.

Steak was tender and nicely cooked, but wasn't a big fan of the balsamic/wine taste. Too pungent and strong for my taste.

I'm giving this a four only because my boyfriend really liked this and he's the beef lover and said it deserves a four; I personally didn't care for the wine/balsamic sauce and thought it was too much for an expensive cut of meat. I doubled the sauce as others suggested, but felt that the poor filets were drowning in it. I can understand why some folks would really enjoy this, but for me, I'm going to keep looking.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I do wish I had added garlic, which I will do next time. Garlic should be in almost every recipe in my opinion! I tried to cook the sauce down because it was really liquid when the steaks were done. Perhaps I shouldn't have covered the pan as the recipe instructed. Anyway, I overcooked the sauce. This was my first experience deglazing a pan, so now I know one way not to do it!  :)

Wow! Awesome, quick, delicious recipe!!! I added a little garlic powder to the meat and topped with some minced fresh garlic. Just a reminder though, watch your cooking time. I know someone mentioned theirs was dry. You need to check your meats while they're cooking since there are so many variables that can cause your meal to cook faster or slower each time. I may cook up some shallots and bacon and add to the sauce next time like the tenderloin and shallots recipe here. I love that recipe but this one is ten times faster and almost as good (a very close second.) I will be making this one again and again.

Loved this recipe!  As suggested by others I added 1 clove garlic and a heaping Tablespoon of Brown Sugar to the glaze-very yummy!  I used a Marsala cooking wine which was very good but would like to try a more expensive Pinot Noir or Merlot just to see what the difference is (I'm not very experienced with cooking with wines).  I served this with Parmesean Crusted Asparagas (a recipe I also obtained at this site and was VERY GOOD) and drizzled the glaze over the asparagas....total heaven!! Will definately make this recipe again and definately make it with the asparagas!!

All I can say is WOW!  This was terrific!!!  Mine took more like 8 minutes on each side to cook because I like mine more medium than rare.  I used merlot for my red wine.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Neither I nor my fiancee liked this dish. I followed the instructions exactly and thought the combo of flavors was horrible. I've always heard you should only cook filet with salt and pepper, and now I know why. Very disappointed by this and will not try again.

The dish inspired me, though I did things differently.  First, I used tri-tip -- and the sauce glazed fine with twice the recommended meat (I used a little over one full pound of tri-tip in the skillet).  Second, when I mixed the vinegar and wine ahead of time, I added a tsp or so of brown sugar and 1 crushed garlic clove.  I let the garlic clover mingle in the pan while it cooked, then removed the browned garlic at the end.  If you really like the sauce and want more, mix and reduce in a saucepan by about 1/3 first -- then add it to the skillet after the steaks have begun to brown.

This was OK, but a little too sweet, and uneccesary on a good piece of meat.

Filet stays very tender & cooks to a perfect medium rare, but the sauce dries out the filet & overwhelms the subtle flavor of the tenderloin.  Not worth it when you're dealing with such a premium (and expensive)grade of steak.

I made this for my husband on New Year's Day this year.  Well, don't think kids like the wine taste.  Wouldn't know because we don't have any, but it was very easy to make.  Just two basic ingredients, and...voila!  I made this dinner with the Mouth Watering Stuffed Mushrooms on this site, and he loved it!  I will have to say, I found this recipe a bit on the bland side myself.  I had to salt my meat, and I don't like doing that.  And also, the recipe makes medium-rare steaks, which was not specified on the original recipe.  Cook longer on a little lower heat for a medium-well, or well done steak.  I'll make it again, but play with it a little.

I marinated the steaks for at least 3 hours and they came out amazing!!  I cooked them according to the recipe and they were awesome. I was disappointed in the sauce, it cooked up immediately!  It definitely did not look like the picture.  It had a good flavor.  Next time, I may cook the reduction separate and poor over the steaks instead of in the pan with the steaks.  I will also double the recipe.

Loved it!   Incredibly easy.   But I would never cook a small filet 4 minutes on each side.  I like it more on the rare side.    I'm planning on doing this for a small dinner party and certain it will be a hit.   Also, easy enough for 'cooking-for-one'.

I think some people think the balsamic and red wine are a marinade. Glaze implies that you make a reduction to later pour over the meat. Look up how to make a reduction. It's delicious, especially with balsamic

Thanks to this app, I cook healthy meals for my kids every day.  Rarely do I spend more than 30 minutes on absolutely delicious meals.   My dinner guests think I'm a great cook but I always admit I'm just great at following directions.   I rarely deviate from original ingredients and steps because I always chose recipes that are at least 4.5 stars.  I haven't been disappointed yet.

We gave this a try w/ Francis Coppola Mertlot which gave it a sweeter taste but . . . Oh my gosh! This is an 5 * savory recipie you can tweak to your wine favor desire. A formal looking but simple  and quick meal that will not disappoint. Next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll add mushrooms to the sauce towards the end.

The filets turned out perfect. It was ready so quickly. I will make it again but I want to try a flavored balsamic vinegar. I think that would give it an extra flavor burst!

I made no changes, but wish i had.  Basically the last step of adding the wine and balsamic vinegar to the meat in the pan, then covering the pan, was like watching beef tenderloins boil...not a good thing to view, with the cost of them, the meat was dark brown all the way through, not even appetizing to look at when cutting into it.  Yes, i only cooked for four minutes on each side after searing on all sides.  I wish i had cooked as directed without the liquids, set the meat aside on a plate, then added liquids to the pan and let it reduce to a sauce, then drizzled the sauce over the plated meat.  Next time!

Unbelievably delicious. Easy to make, we took the advice of a previous blogger and did not cook the steak in the glaze but made the glaze separately then added to the steak. We also added the Gorgonzola cheese to the top of the steak which just took it to a different dimension. We followed all the suggestions as far as letting the raw steak get to room temperature & cooking the steak separately from the glaze.

This is a terrific weeknight recipe - fast, delicious, and showstopping!  I love this paired with elderberry or grape meads -- try Elderberry Mead from Hidden Legend Meadery in Montana; Aphrodisia from Superstition Meadery in  Arizona; or Ossiopioja from Sap House Meadery in New Hampshire!

I made this last night and it was amazing! I did add 1 Tbs of brown sugar and doubled the recipe to have some sauce left to dip the meat in. I would definitely make again!

So I want to preface this by saying I'm a pretty horrible cook... I decided to try this tonight based on the recipe above with some suggestions from the reviews :) (I also you tubed Gordon Ramsey "how to pan sear meat" )  .  I'll tell u exactly how I made it-
I salt and peppered my filet , let it sit on room air for 20-30 min. Then I put a little oil in my pan , plopped in my steak for 3 min on each side .. Added 3 cloves fresh smashed garlic .. And a half of a half a stick of butter.  And kinda sauté that for another two min on each side ..   Took out my steaks , and in the pan with a tiny bit of the drippings, I put in a smidge less then 1/2 cup of aged cherry balsamic vinegar from whole foods and a little less than 1/2 cup of Cabernet sav. Wine and 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and a little bit of butter . (Half of a half- whatever that is :) 
The directions said leave it on for 10 min.. And I stirred it a few times and put the lid on as I made
My "Instant mashed potatoes" and heated up my veggies (from whole foods lol) . I think I left my heat up to high bc it was boiling at about 6 min. And I didn't take it off. 

Finally- I put some Gorgonzola cheese on top of my steak and drizzled on the sauce - I thought it was great! The sweetness of the sauce balanced out the cheese and salty steak perfectly. And it was great on my mashed as well!  My neighbor loved it.
My husband didn't care for the cheese but liked the sauce.


Next time: I'll keep my sauce on medium or low for 1

Prepared as per the given recipe. Compared to other sauces one might choose for filet Mignon, this was certainly easier, and though I had my doubts that something this simple could be something worth writing about, I am pleasantly surprised. The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is that I still prefer a different marinade that has been my favorite for decades. Maybe  I will post it on AR someday.

amazing! you can do with any steak instead of using the wine suggested I used a wine from Flicklin Vineyard that was a tenta port. It is more of a desert wine but mixed with the balsamic it was phenomenal.

This was delicious! I added minced garlic and sautéed mushrooms to the sauce and cooked until it was a thick glaze. I agree with never cooking your steak in sauce, this was great when added right at the end.  I will definitely make again.

I will make this again. However, I made several changes. To begin with, I rubbed the salt and pepper in with garlic powder then let it sit for about 30 minutes so it would be room temp before searing the meat. I used strip steaks not filets. After searing the meat on all sides, I sautéd a whole sweet onion in the same pan with a tablespoon of olive oil until nicely browned and caramelized. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic just before the onions were done. Using the same pan, I made the sauce. At first, I followed the directions but found it was way to acidic for my taste. So I added a 1/2 cup Merlot to cut the vinegar and 1/4 cup of light brown sugar. When this began to simmer, I added 8 ounces of baby bella sliced mushrooms. I reduced the mixture until the liquid was about half the original amount then put the steaks back in and cooked until heated thoroughly, about 2 minutes each side. I eat my steaks very rare so you might want to put the steaks in earlier than I did. I made this for a male friend of mine as a romantic meal with garlic mashed cauliflower, baked fennel with parmesan, and roasted Brussels sprouts. It was a huge hit!

I was hesitant to try this, but it was excellent!  You must use good quality balsamic, or the sauce will taste like vinegar.  Be sure to let the sauce simmer so it reduces.  Next time I will try adding a little brown sugar to the sauce.

Made this for hubby's bday tonight. I don't eat red meat, but he said it was so good that I should give it 5 stars! I made the glaze separately, as suggested by others. Thanks so much for the recipe!

The meat turned out pink inside, which was good.  However, did not like the sauce - it was very vinegar tasting.  May substitute beef broth for the vinegar next time.

This had the potential to be amazing, but was too vinegary. I'm not sure if cooking it longer would have helped. It also didn't thinking as others mentioned so I used a touch of flour which made the consistency better. I will try again, cooking the sauce for longer and if that doesn't work I will double the wine but not the vinegar.

Made this for Valentine's dinner.  My Valentine approved & loovvveeed!!!  It was simple.  I followed the directions with the only change adding garlic.  It didn't over power the fantastic filets I picked up at all.  Just a juicy filet with some flair cooked just right using red wine & balsamic vin.  I served with a side of Rosemary potatoes, steamed asparagus & shrimp.

Wonderful!  I did not add the reduction, I kept that on the side. Everything else was spot on!  Very fast, well worth it.

phenomenal!!! I have made this recipe several times and each time it's excellent!! you will not go wrong making filet mignons and don't worry about ruining your steaks ever with this recipe.... this makes the filet medium rare.. if you want it more cooked just cook it longer in the sauce.

This was delicious! I cooked it for a little less time than stated, as I always seem to overcook my meat, didn't want to ruin it for date night. This was a gourmet meal! Served it with Gorgonzola Gnocchi, Yum!

Just tried this recipe....wanted a no butter way to cook the filets. Had never cooked a filet before.  Simple and delicious.  It really showcased the meat. Just be careful cooking it so it doesn't get too well done, but we used thin filets (sliced in half). 

Bon appetit!

This was incredibly easy and out of this world delicious! I always thought a good steak needed to be grilled. Boy, was I wrong. This is a recipe I will make over & over again. The only change I will make is to add some mushrooms next time. Try it- you will not be disappointed. Thank you, Linda W for sharing your fabulous recipe.

The red wine/balsamic vinegar reduction is excellent!  Heading previous reviews, I purchased a quality balsamic vinegar and wine.  We grilled our filets and put the sauce on the side.  We live at 7000 ft, and the reduction took much longer than might at lower altitudes.  Our meat would have been overdone!  We also topped our filets with Gorgonzola crumbles and butter sauteed mushrooms.  Can hardly wait to make it again!

Review based on Making the glaze only. I seared my filets in a cast iron skillet using left over bacon grease. The bacon was used in making the twice baked potato recipe on this site.

Excellent recipe! Added broiled brussel sprouts and DH raved "best ever!!!" Doubled sauce to keep steaks tender (I have a tendency to overcook things). Next time I'll remove steaks and while they "rest" I'll sauteing onions and mushrooms in sauce.  Extra "yum"!

As others did, I let steaks (4 b/t 2-3" thick, about 4 oz, each) stand for 45 minutes, then salted/peppered and cooked the filets separately from the sauce.  seared the steaks 2-3 minutes per side on a med high heat in a bit of olive oil, then covered the pan and cooked for more 4 minutes. transferred to cutting board and foil tented.  while the steaks cooked, in a separate pan, started 1/2 cup balsamic and 1/2 cup wine (cab), simmered for 5 minutes, then transferred to the steak pan (had removed steaks to set on cutting board at this point) to capture the good juices, added 1 tbsp dark brown sugar and 2 minced cloves garlic and turned the heat up to med high, while stirring. My only regret, is that i plated the sauce in a ramekin.  messy to clean, and the sauce was so good, i ended getting an icing spatula for all to scrape out and smear on the steak.  simple and very good.  cooking the sauce down with the garlic and brown sugar, while continually stirring was a key. paired with 2 bottles of quality chateau neuf du pape, and good friends.  would do this every weekend if i could!

Just enjoyed this for Valentine's Day dinner. I did place the meat in a zip-lock bag with olive oil, pepper & garlic for hours before cooking other wise followed the receipe. We liked it very much! This time of year, using the grill is difficult and with only two of us - using the stove top was qucik, easy and tasty!

Made this a couple of times and husband and I both love it for flavor, juiciness and simplicity. Tonite I substituted little loin lambchops for the beef filets.
No changes to anything but on a whim I added a little dried rosemary to the pan when I added the balsamic vinegar and wine. Just as great as the original for lamb lovers!

I'm not sure whose review I followed, but, he was spot on.  Rest and season the steaks as suggested, sear  (all sides) and then follow through. Why add brown sugar? The reduction is already so sweet and who needs the extra calories? You do need buy  a GOOD balsamic. I paid $16 for mine. Go good on the wine. Coppola Claret was my first go around. 

This review is from someone who was frightened to cook steak. I am now empowered. Thanks Linda.

I prefer steaks grilled, so I followed other reviewers and made the sauce separate on the stovetop and used as a dipping sauce. I double the sauce, used Merlot for the wine and also added garlic the second time I made this as others suggested, then let it reduce on the stove about 10 or 15 minutes until it reached desired consistency. The sauce alone tasted strange at first and we thought it would be overpowering, but paired with the steak is FANTASTIC! My boyfriend loved it and next time we will make more and try freezing in ice cube trays for easy reheating. This is too simple to be that good! We will have this every time we cook steak from now on.

My hubby and I loved our filet mignon steaks prepared this way.  Delicious !   A little tweaking by me is needed for "sauce" to turn into glaze consistency since it was very thin.  Nevertheless, the taste was great and I used the excess to pour over the veggies on my plate ! LOL Will prepare this time and time again.

Our filets were very thick so we put them on the grill for a bit before we started the recipe.  We added fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce and rather than pour on top, we put the sauce with the mushrooms into small individual ramekins for dipping.  Delicious!!!!

This is so darn good. I made this for my hubby on Valentine's Day because I rarely cook red meat, so I did it for a treat and now I promise to make it for every special occasion. I doubled the recipe as previously suggested and I used Cabarnet Sauvignon for the dry red wine as suggested by the wine dude at my local grocery store.

I think my steaks were not the best but I can't be certain that the lack of wonderful joyous flavors was entirely due to the steaks, so I'll go with a reasonably enthusiastic 4 stars for now. Thanks for sharing!

I've never been able to cook steak at home to medium rare and tender until this recipe! This is a fantastic way to prepare steak!! Melts in your mouth :) My only tip is to remember, when you take the steak out of the pan, you really have to cook down the liquid to get the sauce right. Ours was really running because I didn't do that (but still tasty!)

This was really, really awesome. I took the advice of some other reviewers and reduced the balsamic glaze until it was thick and syrupy, and added green onions and garlic cloves. I sort of used this as a "base" and did my own thing, but it is definitely a great starting point. Wonderful!

This recipe is delicious!  I actually used a flank steak vs filets and it was AMAZING!  I did take another reviewers suggestion and added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of butter.  Remember to save some of the sauce for dipping!

Followed recipe pretty much with the exception of having to sub for the wine. I also did not actually cook the steaks in the glaze. The recipe as a glaze alone was pretty good. I simply placed it in small containers for others to choose to have it or not.

I was really excited to make this after reading all of the stellar reviews and was very disappointed. The sauce tastes like vinegar and it doesn't go well with the steak.

This was amazing...I browned a minute on each side, then 2 minutes on each side until the steak reached 130 degrees.. I set aside for a few minutes before slicing, it was amazing and so simple.

This is a delicious and very easy recipe for perfection. I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day and then this evening for my son's birthday dinner. Every one raved about it and asked how I cooked it. This is a keeper.

Beautiful. I made a garlic and pepper butter to marinate them in instead of just the spices.

I had no red wine so we used a white chardonnay, mixed with the balsamic and some olive oil. I only put a splash in the pan with the meat after searing each side, and saved the rest for dipping. 

My meat was just a sirloi tip, about half as thick, so I cooked it for only two minutes on each side after the one minute of searing each side. This was cooked perfectly medium.

V'Day hit.  I doubled the bv and wine.  I also seared on all four sides and put in some brown sugar.  Used sweet and spicy green beans and potatos with the meal.  Will have again.  THX.

Amazing! This was fast and easy. I'm not usually a cook but I took dinner into my own hands for valentines day and my sweetie loves it. I even used a cheeper wine and the taste wasnt tampered with at all. I will make this for all my special occassions. Although I did add a bit of garlic peper and brown sugar.

I'm very glad others have enjoyed this recipe.  Unfortunately, for me, I followed the recipe exactly, but my steak came-out rubbery in texture and I didn't care for the balsamic aftertaste.  Oh well.

I thought these were very good! Wish I would've had more for leftovers! My son didnt like it, thats the reason for the 4 stars. He's my tester! I'm not a fan of wine,but mixed with the balsamic vinegar, it was actually good!  I did have to cook the steak longer,we like ours medium well.  And I tenderized the meat beforehand, so I wouldnt know if it was tender because of that, the type of meat or the recipe. We also had this with the greenbeans with breadcrumbs recipe on this site. Complimented the Mignons well.

This is awesome.  Make sure you use good balsamic vinegar, otherwise it will be to sour.  I sauted mushrooms and onions before sauteing the steak, and really loved the depth of flavor.  Will definitely make again!

Sometimes you need to just make a recipe.. as is!! This is one of them.    There is no need to add anything to it or cook it on a grill.  Do exactly what the recipe calls for and you wont be disappointed.  The Hubs and I adored this "new" way of cooking steak versus the overly used marinated grilled steak method.  Delicious!

Made this for New Year's Eve...followed recipe exactly...I LOVED IT.  Steak was so tender...real rich flavor.  Feedback from my Honey...he likes the taste of the beef, glaze was too strong and overpowered it.  Might be better used on a cheap piece of meat to tenderize or use as a marinade for a roast.  Letting the meat sit room temp. is definitely the way to go, also.

This was excellent... I used the suggestion to make the sauce on the side and add a pinch of brown sugar and it was perfect on our filet mignon and also our green beans...

We had high hopes for this recipe but it was just ok.  We didn't anticipate the sauce would taste as sweet as it did.  I don't think I'll make this again, and we'll stick with the smothered filet mignon recipe on this site.

Absolutely delicious. I followed the advise of previous reviews, doubling the ingredients and adding 2 tbs of brown sugar. I also cooked the sauce separate from the steaks since I was not sure how the sauce would turn out. I also used ribeye steak instead of filet mignon.

Followed everyone else with their suggestions for cooking the sauce off to the side, adding brown sugar, and altering the ingredients. Although I added 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1 cup red wine. I also sprinkled in some onion powder and thyme. Even after letting it reduce for about 15 minutes the sauce was not very glaze like, and still had a vinegar taste. It was good though. I thought it went well with the meat. At the very least it was something different. And, just like everyone else, I couldn't help but dip other things in the sauce (potatoes go great). I bet it would make a good salad dressing actually. Everyone else didn't care for it though (too vinegary) and that's why I gave it a 4/5.

I followed others' modifications and doubled the wine and balsamic vinegar to have more sauce. If I make the recipe again, I would double the wine but not the balsamic, simply tasted too vinegar-y. Also, I followed the recipe's original instructions for cooking the meat, and it was overdone. My boyfriend still loved it, but I wasn't especially impressed.

This dish is really sweet & in my opinion over-powers the flavor of the tenderloin. I thickened the sauce with a little corn starch, which helped make it into more of a glaze. Better recipes out there!

Maybe I added too much brown sugar or maybe it was the wine but it was a bit sweet for me.  But I'll take the blame for that because the steak was the most tender steak I've ever made.  And thats not often!  I was very very happy with recipie!

This was a fantastic recipe.  As I read through the reviews I remembered that my husband goes light on the balsamic with most things, so my adjustment was to add more wine.  I used a half cup of wine and a 1/4 cup balsamic.  I went with the half onion and a cup of Shitake mushrooms..and followed the rest of singledadcancook's instructions.  This yielded medium-rare steaks - my favorite!  I will be making this again and again!!

Delicious, great flavor, easy!  The meat came out perfectly, I like my steak very light pink so I just cooked them a little longer and they were still moist and easy to cut.  The sauce was to die for, I did add butter and brown sugar as other reviewers mentioned.

This recipe was excellent and the steaks came out great. I did marinate the steaks in 1/4 c of balsamic the night before so that the flavor could really absorb into the meat.

Made this for our Valentines dinner! Turned out great, very full of flavor, tender and just the right amount of crusty glaze on the edge of steaks!  I did add a little brown sugar to the sauce otherwise I followed the recipe.  My hubby was very impressed!

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was my first time making a reduction sauce and it got too thick because I was so afraid it would be too thin.  I did change it some..carmelized onions and then removed them before cooking the filet. Made the reduction sauce in the pan drippings and removed the sauce and then added some hight end olice oil and then put the meat in and cooked it for 10 minutes on med heat, then put the pan in the oven at 425 degrees for 8 minutes. It was delish. The sauce was too thick but I smeared it on and it still tasted great. My husband even commenting on how tasty it was. I wouldn't be afaid of ruining the filet with this sauce. Will try again but did ok for a beginner.

Im on the fence with this one...In the pan it was to vinigar-y for me so I took it out and finnished off on the grill. It turned out really good, but not the best thing Ive ever cooked.....It was tender but its hard to screw up a filet.

This recipe was the easiest and tastiest steak dish. And all of the past comments about adding brown sugar, doubling sauce and letting meat sit out for a little while before cooking really worked. Thanks all. I can't imagine having steak any other way.

With some necessary changes this is an EXCELLENT recipe.  First, make sure to rest the steak for at least 30 minutes.  Cook for 1 minute each side and then let rest until room temperature.  Then cook for about 3 minutes seach side for medium rare. Make sure to put onto warm plates. For the sauce, I added a pinch of sugar and a clove of garlic which was a great.

It could not be an easier recipe!  I also added a little brown sugar to cut the acidity.  Even my toddler ate it up!

This recipe was really good.  I followed the advice of those before me and used a little brown sugar as well.  The vinegar was still pretty strong and while I enjoyed that, my husband commented that maybe next time I should use less vinegar.  I would say use half the amount of vinegar called for if using a merlot and definitely add a pinch of brown sugar.  Overall, though, restaurant quality!  Great!

No need to double the sauce as recommended in several reviews. Letting the meat rest before and after cooking is key. Also, the thickness of your meat will play into how long you need to cook per side. I finished up the process by placing the meat under the broiler for a minute with crumbled gorgonzola on top.

Was not all that impressed. Tasted VERY sour and sauce was too thin. I will try it one more time with brown sugar and garlic and let it reduce longer to thicken.

So yummy! After reading the reviews I too BBQ and let my meat sit out for 30 mins before cooking my filets and doubled the sauce. I think if I were to cook the filets in the sauce it would have over powered this great cut of meat.  Just a drizzle went a long way. I served it with French Onion Soup Gratinee from this site and a green.  Perfect 5 star dinning! My boyfriend wants this for dinner every night!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it came out wonderfully! I will admit it was slightly tart but next time I'll use a little brown sugar as suggested. Still, it's something I will definitely make again!

I think my problem was with my own preparation.  I cooked the steaks too long before adding sauce then the sauce didn't have time to reduce before the steaks were done so the steaks had a bit of a balsamic flavor.  I may try again and do it right next time.  Had never prepared filet any other way except grilling.

Filet mignon + balsamic vinegar seemed to be a no-brainer, but neither of us thought it was that great.  Will stick to grilling them as usual. BTW, made exactly as written.

This is a fantastic recipe for filet mignon.  I tweaked this a little for convenience sake by making the glaze seperately and serving it on the side.  As recommmended by other reviewers, I added a little brown sugar and garlic to the balsamic and red wine.  I served with carmelized onions and sauted mushrooms over the steaks and we drizzled this on top of all.  Super!  My kids and hubby really enjoyed the meal.  Thank you for the great idea Linda!!!

This was SO delicious!  We too added 2 cloves of minced garlic to a recipe for two.  I accidentally added the pepper to the sauce... but decided to add it to the steak directly as well and it was just fine.  I did sear the steaks on the grill first to get some nice grill marks and charcoal flavor to them.  We just ate these last night and I could totally go for them again right now!

Quick and easy to prepare.  I took the advice of the others and doubled the recipe yet, I added mixed garlic, brown sugar and some butter to the glaze.  Upon first tasting, I could tell that the doubling of the balsamic vinegar was a mistake and also if I would have added more brown sugar, the flavor would have been perfect. Either way, my husband enjoyed it and I WILL make this again!

Made this last night, and added brown sugar as some have suggested (2 tbsp). SO GOOD!!! My bf couldn't stop talking about it, and luckily I have 2 more steaks left, so we WILL be doing this again before Sunday. Would also be great sliced over salad, in a quesadilla, etc. I accidentally forgot the sauce on the stove after removing the steaks, but it was so nice and thick, it worked out perfectly. This one is a keeper!

So easy and so tasty. We had a bottle of wine and a bunch of steaks, so we did this a couple of times last week. This is a super easy way to impress guests for dinner. We did the exact times as listed in the recipe, but doubled the liquid and reduced it for a sauce. Yum!

I too was VERY skeptical of putting a filet in a skillet. It was cooked perfectly!!!  Very tender and juicy.  The sauce was excellent - I had had a similar recipe at an expensive restaurant - it was wonderful to recreate this dish at home.  I also added 1T. brown sugar but followed the recipe as written.  Thanks for a keeper!

This is best when it is grilled (I use the good 'ol fashion charcoal). I made this for my mom for Mother's Day and we loved it! Don't use the cheap Balsamic vinegar because it will taste bad, use the good stuff (come on its filet mignon people!). I used aged 10 yr old balsamic and a good red wine. Again, don't use cooking wines, if you wouldn't drink it, don't cook with it. If the glaze is prepared correctly, you get the great flavor of both the balsamic and the red wine.

This was delicious!  Some changes that I made were to sear the filets in butter and I added a little bit of brown sugar to the balsamic glaze at the end.  I also significantly reduced the balsamic, it wasn't reduced enough in the time alotted.  This recipe is so easy and so good.  Make sure you have candles handy if you are having guests because our house smelled like vinegar for a while.

I was pretty impressed with the simplicity and flavor of this recipe.  I saw that many people added "their own touch" to the recipe, but I think it's best left alone.  I tried to change it, and although the changes were very good too (in a way it's hard to mess this one up), I think adding anything takes away from the tangy punch of the glaze.  I served my filet mignon with rosemary gnocci (bought at the farmer's market) and zuccini sauteed in garlic-flavored olive oil.  The whole meal takes about 10 minutes to cook, and is pretty light and satisfying.

The best steak I have made, I did use rib eye since I am not found of filet mignon. It was awesome. I also added 2 tbs brown sugar, 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tbs minced onion and wrapped the steaks in smoked bacon. I have made this twice and everyone has love it. Also I tripled the sauce recipe for my carrots. I boiled the carrots until almost soft when the steaks were done I added them to the pan to saute in the sauce. PERFECT!!

I should confess that I'm a vegetarian and was excited to make this for my fiance, and it LOOKED easy enough, but for some reason it was sort of a flop. Granted, fault was probably all mine!! I don't think I'll try it again though.. but interesting to make!

I first must say I consider myself a pretty good cook.  That being said, steak is one of my top choices.  I wasn't very impressed with this recipe.  Although, if I were to offer up positive feedback, I would say this brings out the naturally good taste of the filet.  I don't think it added much to to augment any other flavors.  I used a great bottle of red and a very nice balsamic.  I did take the advice of adding in a bit of brown sugar, and a little garlic.  I'd put this at a 3 star because it didn't ruin the taste, and certainly was not acidic like the one review said.   Not a HUGE fan, but it wasn't bad.  Perhaps serving with a side of garlic butter to top?

Fail proof!.  Good idea to double the glaze and use the butter and brown sugar.  If you want to keep the steaks medium rare while the glaze reduces, only cook them 2 minutes on the 2nd side - then cover them with tinfoil on a plate.  The few minutes it takes to reduce the glaze will allow the steaks to cook that bit more under the foil.

I had to double the recipe but in doing that it made way too much sauce.... and I didn't think the cook time for the meat was long enough. The people I was cooking for like their meat well done so it took alot longer than I expected.

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe. I love vinegar, but it was very overpowering. I also found the stovetop cooking method inferior to grilling. I can see where some might enjoy it, but it's not for me.

Just a note that this recipe works great with other cuts of beef! I used this glaze for good ole' London Broil! It was delicious! I marinated it overnight and added chopped fresh garlic and worchestire sauce to the sauce, along with brown sugar. I also added some meat tenderized shortly before cooking. A delicious glaze!

Made this for Valentine's Day--a definite keeper-the aroma while cooking is wonderful and the eating is even better. You don't need to change a thing! Thanks for such an easy and great recipe.

This was a smash success on Valentine's Day!  I used reviewer suggestions and did not cook the meat with the glaze.  While I broiled the filet mignons, I made the sauce.  As also suggested, I put 2 garlic cloves through a press, lightly sauteed in a few drops of olive oil.  I then added the vinegar and wine and let it cook down a bit while the meat cooked.  An absolutely fabulous result with little effort.

I made this last night. The steak was moist and tender, very good. The sauce was not our taste, took over every other flavor. The vinegar was too strong.   Next time I'll just make a beef broth glaze.

This was a little dish of heaven. I did tweek the recipe though. First I sauteed some baby bello mushrooms with some onion in some butter and peanut oil until very soft and then added a teaspoon of concentrated beef stock (not oxo). Then I seared the steaks (I bought a tenderloin roast and cut it into steaks), in a cast iron skillet, on both sides for about a minute and then continued cooking until they were medium rare. Transfered them onto a baking sheet and let them sit while I made the reduction. I used a red zinfindel and a tablespoon of brown sugar ( I doubled the recipe). I topped the steaks with the mushroom mixture and then topped that with mozzarella cheese (Wanted to use brie but the one I had went bad...oops)and some fresh chopped parsley and put them under the broiler for 3 min. until the cheese was slighly browned. Plated and drizzled the reduction over the top.... oh my were these amazing! I will definitely make this again.

Followed recipe with results that were just OK.  Glaze overpowered rather than complimented the steak.  If I try again, will separate sauce and steaks prep and combine only for 2 minutes and as glaze.  Will also increase wine % in glaze.

I use this recipe every time I make filet mignon.  The sauce has great flavor, though it doesn't seem to thicken as much as I would like. I do add some brown sugar, as another reviewer suggested.  It's very easy and there's very little prep. I never have to go to the store to buy ingredients.  I always have them on hand.  And I love cooking them in a pan instead of having to deal with the grill.  One tip for buying your steak...I ALWAYS buy mine at Costco.  It's almost half the price of the grocery store.  I just buy a package and freeze the steaks in Ziplock bags in two's (for my husband and me).  Then I just defrost and cook whenever I feel like having steak.

This recipe was good. I was hesitant on cooking this in a skillet, because I am use to cooking on the grill. The only thing I did differently was added a bit more red wine, because the balsamic was a little more overpowering. I was very happy with this recipe.

I ended up using the suggestions in the reviews. Let the meat rest, broiled, let it rest again, like suggested. I also didn't double the wine, only the vinegar. I added one tablespoon on brown sugar to the mixture. When I started cooking the meat, I threw in 6 dried figs, halved, and let them grill with the meat for 3-4 minutes, and then threw those into the sauce, reducing on the stovetop. It turned my sauce into a wine reduction full of little fig seeds, which made it beautiful, when spread on a plate. The figs were lovely, cut into little pieces to accentuate the meat.

This was a quick and delicious glaze.  I used rib eye steaks, and cooked them on the George Foreman and made the glaze separately.  I doubled the recipe and added a few shakes of garlic powder and sliced crimini mushrooms.  Turned out great.  Will use again.

I made this recipe last night for valentines. It was fabulous! We bought hearty rib eye steaks instead and I did not cook the steaks in the sauce. We grilled them and then just put the sauce in a small bowl on the side. Then we just dipped the steaks in the sauce. I also made mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was a gourmet meal!

This was very good!  I like a nice sauce w/ my steak.  I did saute some mushrooms first and then added the steak tp the pan.  Then the wine mixture and pulled the steaks out when done.  Then reduced sauce while steaks rested.  They were perfect!  My husband loved as our Valentine's dinner.

This recipe was good as a guideline, but to prevent having the balsamic overpower the flavor of the filet, I reduced the amount of vinegar and wine when cooking the steaks - down to just a splash of each. I marinaded the steaks in a little worcestershire, soy, and steak seasoning for about a half hour before cooking, and the end result was outstanding.

Awesome glaze! Like several others, I grilled the filets seperately and used the basalmic vinegar combo as a glaze. I doubled both the basalmic and vinegar, added I teaspoon of minced garlic, and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. It needs to boil to reduce to a syrupy glaze. It will also thicken more as it cools. The clincher is the bluse cheese. The combination of that tart cheese, with the sweet glaze is perfection. My husband asked me to bookmark this sauce while we were stille eating! This one is a keeper.

OMG, you MUST make this recipe!  I made this for my wonderful husband for Valentine's Day dinner.  The filet mignon just melted in your mouth.  (My filet mignon was a bit larger than the 4 oz. steaks mentioned in the recipe, so I had to cook mine a smidge longer to get to medium rare.)  The sauce was to die for!  (I also doubled that to work with the larger steaks.)  This recipe is a keeper and was PERFECT for a romantic dinner. I'd highly recommend this recipe!!

This balsamic glaze is just kicking!!! I use it now to marinate all my meet. I don't cook steaks in it, just brown them for 2-3 min per side, remove them, then add marinade to the skillet to make balsamic-wine reduction. And later I can't stop soaking bread in this thing))

This was a fantastic!  Made it with lobster tail for new years eve and it was a hit -- even with the kids who are very picky eaters.  I also added the brown sugar and garlic to the reduction.  Yum!  This is going into the recipe box.  Thanks!

I made this for my meat-lover husband and he absolutely LOVED it! It was very easy to make. I only made one change: I marinated the filet mignon for about 4 hours. The result was a very savory, buttery-soft, filet mignon that I will sure be making very soon again.

the recipe as is didn't really work.  it seems like a good and pretty basic idea, but if i were to make this again, i would follow the other cooks ratings and suggestions develop a new recipe from there.

I made this the way IMVINTAGE suggested and it was AWESOME!!! It's my husband's favorite. I top with Blue Cheese and broil for about a minute and it's a great combination with the glaze.

This is delicious. It is very good with no changes. Even a finicky, hard to please, friend of ours loves this! It makes an excellent "special occasion" meal that isn't that time consuming or difficult to make. You will like this one!

Fantastic recipe.  Balsamic is one of our favorites to cook with so I couldn't resist trying it, if you love the flavor of Balsamic, you will love this recipe.

Great! Took others advice and simmered the glaze alone until thick. I wanted a syrup so it needed to simmer longer than the steaks. It smelled horrible while cooking, but tasted great. Used a cab-sav and the sweet-tanginess of the wine was a nice balance. Never cooked steaks on the stovetop before and they turned out great. Be sure to let them rest before eating and they'll taste even better.

I followed the recipe completely except I let the steak sit for an hour like others suggested and I wasn't too happy with the results. The steak itself was amazing but the vinegar was just so strong I couldn't stand it. Not sure if or what I did wrong, but the sauce was just too overwhelming.

I got scared by everyone else's suggestions, so I just seared the staek in the pan first (1 min on each side) and then broiled it until it was done...about 3-4 min on each side.  I didn't have brown sugar like I thought, so I put a pinch of regular sugar in with it.  It didn't get syrupy, but was still really good!  Maybe I'll try this the way the recipe says next time!

This was absolutely delicious.  I haven't been able to make a filet at home for a long time because it never cooks up right. I didn't think a pan cooked filet would taste right but it was great!  I will make this again and again.  Also recommend using the recipe "Roasted asparagus with balsalmic vinegar".  We had that on the side.  yum.

Pretty good!  I went with other reviewers and first seared my filets and then broiled them until done.  I added a heaping tbsp of brown sugar to a double batch of glaze (which I cooked in the same pan that I had cooked the meat in, while I let the meat rest on a plate), but I found it to be too sweet.  I'd knock it back to under a tbsp, I think.  I think it would be even better grilled with the sauce on the side for dipping.

This was an AWESOME recipe!!!  Thanks to previous reviewers for the "resting" tip.  Never heard that before.  I also added 1 tsp. of brown sugar which really made the sauce (like suggested). I cooked the steaks in the pan like the recipe said and did add the wine and basalmic to the pan.  Was a bit worried b/c the last two reviews said they didn't but it was phenomenal!! I also added pine nuts & will LOVE to use Gorgonzola once I'm not preggie!!  WONDERFUL Valentine's dinner.  We had it with green beans and roasted red potatoes with rosemary and garlic. DE-LISH!!! Oh!  Also made the Parmesan puffs for an appetizer.

Excellent and super fast to prepare.  Be sure to have all your other side dishes ready, before you begin.  I was doubtful about the cooking method, but the steaks turned out perfect.  We didn't even let them rest after pulling them from the pan.  They looked incredible and we couldn't wait to dive in!!!  I know that's a big cooking sin, but it was late and we were too hungry :)  The only addition we made, which is personal preference, is to add blue cheese to the top, once the steaks were plated.  Really an incredible meal and perfect for a busy night.  Serve with Easy Asparagus and Mandarin Almond Salad from this site and Rutherford's Cab-Sav....heaven.

Very good! I reduced the sauce first, then spooned it over the filet's when they were done. Served some caramelized onions as a condiment...delish and super easy.

I followed the suggestions of the last reviewer - wow! Yummy! Instead of just broiling the filet though, I seared it in olive oil first, then in oven to finish cooking, then melted gorgonzola under the broiler.

I made this for my boyfriend, my roommate and her boyfriend and it turned out great. The only reason i didn't give it a 5 star was because I did take other users suggestion on adding brown sugar to the reduction. I couldn't taste the difference. As other viewers said, I was discouraged by pungent vinegar smell. I was hoping the sauce would have a little more umph to it. I seasoned my filets with fresh ground pepper and garlic pepper grinder from McCormick (a new favorite). I put them on the grill and they turned out fabulous. I served with the red skin roasted garlic mashed potatoes and parmesan crusted asaparagus from this website. Everyone said it was the best filet they had ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

I used filet mignon wrapped in bacon. I seasoned the meat with sea salt, onion powder, and pepper. I cooked the meat as the recipe called for. However, as many reviews state I cooked the sauce seperate: added brown sugar, garlic, and onion powder.  I served it with twice baked potatoes. It was amazing, I felt like a true chef.

This was a quick and easy dish to make.  The Filet melted in your mouth and not in your hands.  I've tried a number o recipies, but this one is the best.  Excellent color and taste.  Highly recommended.  It definitely deserves Two thumbs up.

Cooking time was a bit much.  It was very well done.  I would cook it for 2-3 min on each side.  It was very good and very simple to make.  Would certainly make again!

Delicious and tender.  I didn't have any wine, so I used beef broth.  I also didn't want to go to the store to buy balsalmic vinegar (I've never used it before), but I did have the balsalmic-type salad dressing which I used... still turned out delicious. Took longer to cook than what the recipe stated, but I cooked it on a low temp.

Oh my goodness good.  I actually was worried because I was making this for my husband and I ended up having this on the stove for about 20 mins or so. And I know filet mignon is not good overcooked but I just turned down the stove to very low and let is cook VERY slowly and soak in the juices.  My husband, the cooking connoisure, said that is really the better way to cook it anyway.  I actually did something right.  He loved it and so did I and I am not much for meat cooked below med well.

MMMMM.  Easy to make, doesn't take much time (other than waiting for the glaze to cook down), and oh so good.  Paired it up with Balsamic mushroom caps and sooo awesome.

I used garlic pepper in the ginder and salt.  I did lightly grease my pan.  As others suggestion, I added about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar.  Very Very simple, very tasty!  Will make again for sure!

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for a while and finally decided to try it- great choice!  I served the yummy glaze with pork chops because that's all I had.  I added a touch of chicken stock and a generous portion of brown sugar- YUM!  My husband likes "normal" things and I think even he was a little impressed by it.

I gave it 3, 5 from my husband, so we end up with a 4 star.  It was OK, but the balsamic glaze is such a strong flavour that it took away from the expensive cut of meat. Will probably try it again but make the glaze separately like some others suggested.

So easy!!  I used merlot the 1st time, a lighter red the 2nd time, and finally a port the other day (always with a good balsamic).  They're all great!  I served them w/mashed potatoes w/chive cream (from this sight) and asparagus or broccolini roasted.  Thanks for sharing!! *****Oh yeah, I also made the balsamic roasted potatoes to go with these.

Eeeks, I was thinking this would be good based on the reviews but it was a waste.   The combo of red wine and balsamic vinegar is a very odd taste.  My suggestion would be to make the sauce on the side and drizzle on the steaks.   Also definitely, season the steaks ahead of time.

This was so delicious! I let the meat sit out and get to room temp before cooking it, and used a good balsamic and a nice dry California cabernet for the glaze, and I could not have been happier. A simple, elegant winner! Thanks!

This recipe was OUTSTANDING! In addition to the salt and pepper, I also lighted dusted the filets with some garlic powder and a little ground cumin. The only cooking adjustment I needed to make was to keep the steaks on for an extra 4 minutes (totaling 12 minutes on Med-Low) since they were thick cut. They came out a perfect medium rare and went fantastically with the Roasted Asparagus with Shallots recipe also on this site! I will definitely make this again!!

This came out very well.  I didn't cover it during the 8 minutes of cooking in the sauce and the glaze reduced nicely after about another 10 minutes on medium-low heat after I removed the meat.  I also added garlic as others suggested.  A great, quick meal with very little fuss!

All I changed was to coat meat with Montreal Spice and garlic before cooking.

This was good. I used a port wine instead of a dry red as I didn't have any on hand. The glaze added a rich sweetness without masking the flavour of the steak.

This was pretty good and SO easy to make.  The sauce did thicken a little but not as much as I hoped.  The only alteration I made was to saute some onions in butter/oil olive before adding the steaks.  I cooked them along with the steaks.  That way I topped the steaks with the sauce and the cooked onions.  Would try maybe adding garlic to the onions as well next time.  I served this with fresh steamed carrots and broccoli (a good combination).  I will make this again.

This was an excellent dish! I mixed the wine and balsamic together with 2 cloves of garlic prior to adding it to the pan with the filets. I used 1/2 cup of both wine and vinegar. Also, our filets were thick and we prefer our meat to be medium, so our cooking time was more like 8-9 minutes per side. I will definately make this again!

I didn't really care for this at all.  It was quick and easy to make and had an interesting flavor but I didn't really feel like the sauce complimented the filet.  I added the brown sugar, as was recommended, and cooked the sauce down when the filet was done but, again, I really didn't care for this.

This was absolutely delicious! I made it as a special meal for Valentines day. I grilled the steaks and then served this on the side--my only complaint was that there just wasn't enough for all 4 of us (my mistake I should have doubled the recipe for double the amount of filets!)

very bland, and it maybe somewhat jazzy for a lessor cut of meat but not for filet. Favor masking rather than flavor enhancing.

This was quite good, but I think it needed a little something extra, I might try the sugar or carmelised onions that some other suggested.  It just needs an extra layer maybe of sweetness.

So good!  Was very easy and quick with simple ingredients that are always around.   I made an addition to it; I carmelized onions first, and once the meat was almost done, I added them in with the wine sauce and simmered until the steaks were done.  Delicious!

This was delicious and quick!  I have never made filet mignon before and this was a great way to try making it just right!  The meat came out so tender, even my cats enjoyed it.  I also rubbed some oregano and garlic to the meat before frying in the pan.

I used top sirloin in this recipy and thought it tasted excellent, the combination of balsamic and red wine is fabulous.  I was a little dissapointed in the consistency of the "glaze" though as I found it to be watery.  Bottom line, great taste but would prefer a thicker glaze.

When I doubled this recipe I also doubled the glaze since I hadn't considered the posibility of the tenderloins "floating around" in the glaze - instead of just "glazing" each side of the meat.  oops.  This still turned out okay - but slightly soured the meat.  (All that floating around infused the loins with balsamic and wine.)  I'll try it again soon, turn up the heat a little and keep the centers pure.

This dish was very easy and tasted very good, but it smelled bad when it cooked- extremely pungent odor.

This recipe was expensive to make. I got average reviews on this but I didnt think it tasted worth the effort. I will look for another crab dip in the future.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I cooked the steaks longer than the recipe called for because I like my steak on the medium-well side.  Easy to prepare and tasty.

This was the easiest recipe and turned out fabulous!  I made it for my husband on New Year's Eve & he said it was the best meal of the year...restaurants included!  I can think of no better compliment.  Thanks for sharing!

I bought a wonderful filet mignon the other night. It was beautiful and I did not want to grill it... I wanted it to stay tender. I stumbled upon this recipe, the filet was magnificent. I too used the burgundy. I ended up cooking the filet a little longer since it was very thick (4 inches!!!) But by cooking it longer the glaze was even more carmalized and tasted great. I will never cook my filet mignon any other way after trying this recipe.

I thought this was ok. I too expected more from it. I think for such an expensive piece of meat it wasn't as gourmet as you expect. I would save the meat for the grill. If I make again it will have to be made with a different meat.

I used Australian ribeye steaks and they were very tender.  My husband was very impressed.  This is definately worth serving over and over and keeps my husband from having to stand out in the cold to barbeque the steaks!

Very easy and very good.  I used a hearty burgandy for the wine, which caused a nice sweet glaze.  My husband loved it!

What a special treat! I used another reviewer's suggestion of a spoonful of brown sugar in the sauce; this was a good idea since I think that balsamic can be pretty tart, and because I knew that the sugar would assist in the sauce caramelization process. I also made 2x the sauce, based on review suggestions. That was also a good idea, to make sure there was plenty. I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I pre-heated my stainless steel oven-proof skillet in a 500 degree oven, and also pre-heated the gas burner I was going to use on the stove-top. That way I get a serious sear, and it didn't take much time to reduce the sauce. Followed the recipe with these changes. Great for special occasion (Valentine's Day), as good as a grill house (without the grill :).

I decided not to cook the steak with the sauce because I knew it would ruin it.  Filet should be cooked on its own.  I cooked the "glaze" in a seperate pan.  It was horrible.  It was waay to vinegary even though I added some sugar.  It stayed watery and thin, and never thickened to a  glaze.  This is the first recipe that I have tried off this site that I did not like.  I will never make this again!

These were the most tender   filets I have had in a long time.  I also sprinkled kosher salt on them,  let them alone for 45 min. I Then rinsed off the salt, pat dried, and followed the above recipe. Wow  great taste!

I took "IMVINTAGE" advice and did the glaze very differently and didn't cook the steaks in it.  I was serving 6 steaks so made it with a cup of balsamic and a 1/2 cup merlot and six tablespoons of brown sugar.  It took about 20-25 minutes to reduce from almost two cups to less  than 1/2 cup but it was worth it! The reduction was thick & syrupy and out of this world delicious and pairing it with melted Gorgonzola on the steak  was a HUGE HIT!  Served with roasted veggies that were used to sop up every last drop of the glaze.  I told all my friends and family about this recipe because it was so easy and soooo delicious!  I'll be making the glaze in large quantities next time since it keeps for over a month in the fridge.

It was really good.   I halved the recipe because I didn't want leftovers and didn't know if I was going to like it.   I don't like wine and don't normally cook with it.   This really surprised me and I will definitely be making it again and maybe some adjustments.   Thank you for an awesome recipe.

This was a hit and was so easy.  The only thing I added was mushrooms, which I cooked separately in butter and some white wine first and then added to the main pan in last few minutes.

I  followed the recipe exactly as directed and everyone loved it. My steaks came out medium to medium rare which is exactly how we eat a steak. I highly recommend this for a special company dinner.

Rule number 1.   You must use a quality balsamic.  If you use anything else, you will have a very vinegary flavor.  Spend the money, get the good stuff.  Your tastebuds will thank you.   Rule number 2.  let your steaks get to room temperature.  It makes a huge difference.  The flavor of this recipe was wonderful.   I served with with  Easy Lemon-Garlic Scallops and steamed asparagus.  DELISH!!

I fixed this the other night for my wife and myself, and she loved it!  So did I.  And it's very simple to make.  To round out the meal, I roasted some potatoes and some broccoli.

Meat cooked perfectly but next time I will serve the sauce in a cup on the side.  Finishing the filets in the very dark glaze  turned the filets too  dark and unappealing.  So next time I will prepare the meat and glaze separately then serve sauce in the side.

Made it pretty much as is and it come out perfect.  My only added touch were fresh crimini mushrooms sliced and sauteed in butter and finished with two Tbs of Maggi sauce. Added mushrooms and sauce to balsamic and wine sauce and topped steaks.

Careful when adding the wine and balsamic. The very hot pan causes a lot of spatter, the sauce/glaze then burned to the pan.  
Second try, turned off the heat at first flip-less of a spatter, but noticed the glaze beginning to scorch again.  Added some water to slow the process, which helped.  
Next time I'll thin the glaze a little from the beginning.

We had two prime-cut fillets and the flavors from the balsamic vinegar/red wine glaze was incredible and the steaks practically melted in our mouths. My wife said, "Make it again, please!"

Excellent recipe! I quickly browned the steak in a little high smoke point oil (1-2 minutes each side) which I then poured off and added the balsamic vinegar and the dry red wine. Since I like my steak rare and I was afraid that covering  and cooking it would result in well done meat,  I quickly concentrated the sauce at medium high heat until  it was bubbling and syrupy with the meat in it. Done! Take it off the fire and let the steaks rest 5-10 minutes in the warm skillet. I added two pats of butter during the concentrating of the sauce but that was probably overkill and next time I will try without it. As recommended by others,I doubled the amount of the sauce because it is so good. But PLEASE, PLEASE don't add sugar to the sauce. Balsamic vinegar is rich with natural sugars and once the acetic acid is boiled off you will find it is already quite sweet!

Delicious balsamic glaze! I seasoned filet mignon with salt and pepper on one side and grilled each of the 2 sides for 3-5 minutes on a high temperature grill until desired temps of 120 for rare and 135.

I always read the reviews on recipes prior to making it.  I'm an accomplished cook, but do like to see what others liked, or didn't, in efforts to avoid problems.  And I often agree with others, about rating a recipe when you tweak it here and there, and yet, here I am.  :)   

I used a venison tenderloin, because this time of year, we have a well stocked freezer.  I brought it to room temperature, sprinkled with fresh ground pepper, salt and roasted garlic powder, and let it set for about 40 minutes to so.  Then placed on the grill.  Braising a tenderloin of any kind just toughens the meat.

I sauteed some shallots in a little butter, then removed and added a good quality balsamic vinegar and them hemmed and hawed about a red wine v. Marsala that another reader suggested.  I went with the Marsala, which was a great choice, as the slight sweetness really balanced the vinegar.  For the reader that found the vinegar overwhelming when cooking, yes!  It smells really venaregy (is that even a word?), but, but once the sauce reduces down, it's to die for.

I served the tenderloin with shallots, sauce and a side of steamed green beans and wild rice.  This is a great base recipe that will definitely find it's way to our table again.

I made it in complete darkness when the power was out, but it tasted amazing!  I used 8oz filets, and they tasted/felt medium, so if that isn't for you, you could cook them less.  I coated the entire think with fresh ground peppercorn and it was delicious with a little kick, and also used fresh ground Himalayan salt. The glaze never really "glazed", but rather was still liquid even though I kept this part cooking for a few minutes longer (it was dark so I may have made a mistake)... However, the flavor was spot on.  Served with steamed green beans and red potatoes with sage, rosemary, butter, and sour cream.

This is going to be my go-to filet mignon recipe. My wife loved it, even though it was not as good as it should have been. I doubled the sauce recipe and added the brown sugar, but next time I will not double the balsamic vinegar and I will only add the 1/2 cup of sauce indicated in the recipe to the cooking steak, adding the rest and reducing it while the steaks are resting in the warm oven.

As mentioned by other reviewers, I added a bit of brown sugar and garlic to the red wine and balsamic, letting it simmer for 5 min. I also ended up doing 6 minutes each side. It was so yummy! The steak was so soft and tender we could hav cut it with a butter knife! Can’t wait to make it again!

This is an excellent and simple recipe, provided you sear the steaks (all sides), before you add the glaze to it; be conscious of how much salt and pepper to rub into the steak prior to searing.  It’s very easy to add to little or to much salt and pepper; there is a sweet spot that perfectly complements the glaze.

I also recommend turning the temp to Med and cooking a bit longer than 4mins each side; should help keep the meat tender.

The meat turned out tender and perfectly cooked but next time, I will thicken the sauce to serve with the steak...or maybe BBQ the meat and serve with the thickened sauce. Overall, a simple, quick option for a fancy dinner!

Made this for valentine's day and it was so good! I always manage to over cook the life out of the meat but I followed the instructions and it came out a perfect medium. I'm not super into eating meat but I really enjoyed this and so did my Valentine.

I actually made this recipe for my family. I just doubled the ingredients except the oil. I paired it with simmered red potatoes in a wine sauce and green beans. Quick easy and the meat was very juicy. My family enjoyed this meal a lot. It was a fantastic recipe.

The filet doesn't have enough fat, would use a marbled steak cut instead. The balsamic was wicked good.

I cooked my steak a little longer and it was overcooked.   This was delicious.  Next time, I'll follow the suggestions of the other reviewers, in cooking the sauce separate, adding butter and brown sugar.

I think  this  recipe is definitely a keeper. It is so yummy and easy to make. I made asparagus and mashed potatoes and my guy couldn't stop eating it. He said it's definitely one of his top 2 things to eat. If ever I need to make something quick I definitely recommend this. However I think with the combination of the NASA mic kick I'm going to try pineapples as a garnish I think it will give me an tangy quick which wouldn't be so delicious! I followed this complete recipe.

I had two filets, each were 2" cuts.  I set them out for two hours.  The last forty minutes of resting, I sprinkled Kosher salt, covering all sides.  During this time, I made the reduction, adding iodised sea salt to taste, about two teaspoons of brown sugar and three pats of butter.  Additionally, I took a pound of Baby Bella mushrooms, quartered them, and halved some to make them uniform in size.  I Sea salted and peppered (using fresh-ground, multi-colored pepper corns) the mushrooms and tossed in a bit of Olive oil.  Then coated my heavy cookie sheet with Olive oil, and placed the mushrooms on the pan a single layer, then preheated the oven to 400 degree.  While preheating, I used my garlic press to mince Elephant garlic into amounts equal to 4 regular garlic pices.  I also sliced two Shallots.  I placed the mushrooms in the oven and cooked for ten minutes, removed them and turned them over, returned them to the oven  for ten more minutes and sautéed the garlic and shallots  during this timeframe.  When I removed the mushrooms, I added them to the butter sauce.   I took my LeCreuset frying pan and seasoned it with cocoanut oil, poured it out when it was smoking, thenadded a bit of olive oil and brought the pan back to the appropriate temperature (LeCreusett's appropriate temperature is 5 on the ceramic cooktop).  With tongs, I seared each ateak one minute, turned them over and cooked them 13 minutes, flipped and cooked 9 to 10 minutes and seared all sides.  They were medi

I made this for my husband and we both loved it! With that said, I think a good quality balsamic vinegar (the most  you can afford) is necessary in this dish. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of, removing the steaks from the pan to allow them to rest then I simmered the sauce for a few minutes to allow it to thicken up. Delicious!!

This came out very good.  I didn't have  Filet Mignon, so I used hamburger patties instead just to give it a try.   I doubled the glaze recipe as others suggested, and added 3 TBS brown sugar and let it cook down after the patties were done. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

My whole family loved it. Followed the recipe exactly. Used good quality balsamic vinegar. As I let the steaks rest, I did add the brown sugar and butter as I  continued to reduce the sauce. I will do this again.

I made this exactly as written. It was awesome. My husband thought it was a little vinegar heavy, so next time I will use a little more wine and a little less vinegar in the sauce. Served with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Loved it, and will definitely make it again!

I doubled the sauce and added brown sugar as others have recommended. I added 2 tsp and will add a touch more next time. All in all, I really enjoyed this!

I found it to be way too much balsamic vinegar! Next time i'ii try 1/2 cup red wine, 1/2 cup beef broth and 2 tablespoons balsamic and reduce that combination by1/2.

This was a good technique for cooking the filet mignon.  I wasn't sure how I felt about the glaze.  Someone suggested adding brown sugar and butter to it and topping with Gorgonzola which made this 5 stars for sure.

Flavor overpowering and I use a good balsamic.  My husband liked it but...
Timing left it quite rare which is good for us but may be off-putting to those who want more cooked steak.
I had to add some sugar and salt to soften the flavor.

I made this steak when my sister was visiting because sometimes you just crave a delicious steak, we were not disappointed. I actually tripled the glaze and was so glad I did, but you really have to go all out with the cut of beef you choose. The filets I chose were absolutely fabulous. The next time I want a melt in your mouth, fabulous steak this will be my go to recipe. I would rather "go to" the kitchen and cook a fabulous meal than "go to" a so called steak house, spend a small fortune to experience disappointment.

This was a simple but yet amazing dinner. I took the suggestion of making the glaze separately and that worked out perfectly. I made it with a side of roasted rosemary potatoes and roasted asparagus delicious. This was most definitely a keeper!

I normally make my steaks on a grill and was surprised on how good this turned out.  Cooking the steak in this sauce on a covered skillet really infused the meat with added flavor. Have made this twice now being winter in Michigan (no grilling) and would highly recommend.

This is a simple, delicious, and very flexible recipe. I've changed it up a couple of times now with different wines, spices, and even infused balsamics. It's great to have in your go-to list.

Instead of Asparagus, I steamed broccoli sprinkled with minced garlic. I also mashed potatoes with sour cream, as an additional ingredient. I poured the remainder of the balsamic glaze, over the mashed potatoes.

I have to admit that I did tweak this just a little to fit my taste, but it was SO GOOD! My husband told me to add it to the recipe book! My alterations were: I used a sweet red wine instead of a dry red (I just don't like the flavor of dry wines) and I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the vinegar/wine reduction. This helped thicken it a bit as it cooked down and added a little sweetness. It was so good I would make it again tonight!

I made mine a little different bc my family likes different types of meat.  I seasoned w s and p as directed.  I seared both sides and put on a sheet in an oven @ 375.  My husband likes med well.  I like med rare.  Waited til mine was 120-125 degrees.  My husband 140-145.  I made the glaze in a pan.  Added a tbsp. Brown sugar, and reduced to 1/2.  I doubled the wine and vinegar.  Added drippings from meat to the glaze.  It was amazing!  Oh added tbsp. Butter before serving.  Everyone loved the meal.  Even my children-17, 15, and 8!  Great Valentine's Day dinner.

Preheated cast iron skillet on a grill, and direct-heated each side of the steak 90 seconds (45 seconds then rotate 90 degrees for another 45 seconds for criss-cross grill marks) on the grill before placing in the pan. Balance of the recipe per instructions. Excellent results.

This was delicious. Followed the recipe as is but doubled the reduction and added garlic and brown sugar as others suggested. I drizzled some over the top and served the rest on the side. (Picture does not show this) SO good! Had it with a side of chanterelle mushrooms, and a baguette with goat cheese and thyme. Yum!

Made this last night for Valentines dinner.  I followed the first steps of the recipe but moved the steaks to a different pan finishing them in a 400 degree hot oven for 5 minutes for medium doneness. I then added the wine and balsamic to the pan drippings. That gave me the time to reduce the sauce to a nice thick syrup while the steaks finished cooking. Trick here is to use a good quality balsamic to reduce the risk of a vinegary taste.  I plated the steaks and spooned the sauce over the top. Delicious, will definitely make it again.

The sauce was a nice addition, but I prefer my filet mignon steaks grilled with just salt and pepper.

This was great - I doubled the wine and balsamic as several others recommended, and added a little pepper and cooked it down while the steaks rested for a couple of minutes.  It ended up being delicious - and a great way to cook the steak as well.  I used the recipe for both filet mignon and for a t-bone steak and it was great for both!

This was so easy and a perfect Valentine's dinner.  The steaks were perfectly cooked to a good medium.  Just like I like!  I will try this for company soon, because it's so simple and elegant!  I added some sautéed mushrooms on the side.  The next time I make it, I may add gorgonzola crumbles on the top!

This is the best filet mignon recipe. Tangy and peppery. I served it on Valentine's Day with steamed lobster tails, creamy mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. 
It was a definite hit!

Valentine Dinner at home. Unbelievably good. Had tenderloin pieces much larger that the 4 oz called for in the recipe and still got a perfect medium rare by simmering a bit longer (maybe 8 or so minutes total, but I was judging by the resistance of the meat more than the cook time). I upped the liquids to about 1/3 cup each and used 25 year aged balsamic and cheap Marsala of some indistinguishable age (previously unopened, of course). Borrowed idea of adding minced garlic and brown sugar. It will be totally different though probably excellent dish without those additions.  I usually cook steak in a screaming hot cast-iron skillet so the amount of time it took to sear the meat properly was a surprise to me using the nonstick skillet, but other than that the recipe played out as I had hoped and expected.   I still got a good sear though and consequently had beautifully moist and tender meat.  thanks to all who cooked this before for the excellent suggestions.

I followed IMVINTAGE's suggestions, but with a tweak of my own.  Like her, I broiled the steaks as opposed to pan-frying them. While the steaks were resting, I minced a shallot and three cloves of garlic and sauted them in a little olive oil before deglazing the pan with the balsamic vinegar and merlot (I took her advice and doubled the balsamic vinegar).  Then I added sugar - about a teaspoon - and let the glaze reduce down to a thick syrup.  That's really important.  Cooking it down concentrates the flavors and highlights the sweetness.  You don't have to use really expensive balsamic vinegar, but it needs to be balsamic.  I love the Gorgonzola topping that IMVINTAGE suggests, but some of my family doesn't.  I'm happy to say that the non-Gorgonzola fans loved the steaks topped with only the reduction.

I have always grilled my fillets so was interested to try this recipe.  It was so easy to prepare and tasted out of this world.   I used aged balsamic which gave the glaze a nice thick texture and I also added sliced mushrooms when I added the wine and vinegar.  This recipe is so easy, every my husband could make it.  ??  Follow the timing and your steak will be perfect every time.

Made the recipe as written except I used black cherry balsamic vinegar with the red wine. My husband said it was the best steak he ever had and I agreed. This recipe is very easy and I definitely will be making these steaks again.

The sauce was very tasty, but I felt that it tended to override the wonderful taste of the filet. It might be ok to drizzle it over the steak afterwards, but this way of cooking, it gets infused directly into the meat.

Very good. Too much Balsamic for my liking, so next time I will use less Balsamic. I seared the steak using butter on both sides for about 2 mins each (med. rare -  they weren't very thick)  then moved to a plate. I sauteed some mushrooms in the same pan and when they were almost done I added the balsamic and wine and reduced, scraping up the brown bits. I then returned the steak to the pan until heated. So easy!

I followed the recipe using the red wine and waited until the steaks were almost finished and added bottled balsamic glaze.  Because the bottle product was reduced balsamic vinegar it wasn't "vinegary" and had a rich flavor. I'll make this again.

My fiancé made this for us. It was delicious but I would have liked it cooked a little longer. Than what the recipe called for. We also didn't have  asparagus like it was  suggested, so we improvised with sweet peas and it was to die for.  Recommend it for any type of romantic dinner.

I used sherry cooking wine with the balsamic, and two lovely pieces of filet mignon from the fresh market.  I had to add about two additional minutes cooking time, after the 4 & 4 as the meat was still a little red.  Very tender and tasty and will look at making this again...

My wife loved this! 
Double balsamic and wine sauce we used 16 oz of meat. Reduce sauce whilst meat is covered and resting for five minutes and added a half teaspoon of sugar and one squirt of over the counter balsamic reduction. Roast potatoes on double convection 40 min longer if no convection oven available and add a diced shallot and dash of garlic powder as well. Pour potatoes and leftover oil in to bowl and toss before serving. 
Thanks for the recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly, except my filets were about 6 oz. each.  I increased the wine and balsamic vinegar to 1/3  cup each, which I found wasn't necessary.  The meat turned out tender, moist and was cooked perfectly.  Will make again.

Really good, glaze wasn't much of a glaze but more of a vinaigrette. I also added more spices to the steak because just salt is boring.

This was a huge hit! I paired it with sautéed asparagus with a touch of honey, and jasmine rice.  This was one of the easiest non-grilled winter steak recipies ever. It didn't even make my house smokey.

I was looking for something a little different to serve with a beef tenderloin roast and found this recipe. I didn't cook the roast in the wine/balsamic so I am reviewing the reduction only.  While the roast was resting I added the wine/balsamic to the drippings and reduced to a few tablespoons. Smooth as silk and slightly sweet, amazing flavour. A good red wine and balsamic are a must.

I've made this 3 times now and we love it!  I normally do not fix a steak unless I can grill it on charcoal but this is a keeper!  Tonight I sauteed mushrooms in wine and butter and then removed them and cleaned the pan to fix the steaks.  I added them back in toward the end so they could heat back up.  They were a wonderful addition!  My husband isn't a big steak eater but he loves this!  *note  I used four steaks tonight and doubled the balsamic vinegar and wine.  It did not need to be doubled.  It would have been just fine with the original amount  called for with 2 steaks.

This was a hit for our family on New Year's Eve. I followed the recipe to the letter since it was my first time preparing it. I'll use the suggestion of letting the meat sit for a while longer next time I make it. The sauce is fabulous.

The reduction of red wine and balsamic vinegar alone was awful.... luckily I was with someone who could fix it and make it taste good.

I used a balsamic glaze with Eberle 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon and the balance was perfect. I let my filet rest 1 hour with fresh basil from my Aerogarden, white onions mixed with minced garlic. I like my steak well done on the grill normally but this recipe made me love steak in a pan even more. Will absolutely make again with different red wines. I served with asparagus and baby potatoes.

Made this for Christmas Dinner today and it turned out amazingly good for three people! Didn't have wine with the exception of White Zinc so cooked with extra olive oil, butter, onions and mushrooms. Served with dinner salad and rice. Very very good.

Yummy, this sauce is sooooo good and so easy to make!!  I used a wine that's a red blend, a high quality balsamic vinegar, added a couple teaspoons of granulated sugar and a teaspoon of chopped garlic.  Cooked it in a sauce pan for about 15 min, until it reduced and thickened.  I pan seared my filets to get them brown, for a couple min on each side, then finished them in the oven at 350 degrees.  I spooned the sauce over the filets and it was delicious!!

The steaks came out great!!! My family loved it and definitely wanted to have it again! The only thing I did different was that I reduced the glaze separately and used it to baste the steaks as I cooked them. Them I poured it over the top of the steaks before serving them.

Have made this several times and it always comes out excellent. This time I didn't have enough Balsamic so I just added extra red wine. I did add just a little garlic and onion powder along with some dried tarragon to the sauce. After removing the steaks I added about 2 tablespoons of cold butter to the sauce. The cold butter emulsifies easily and the result is a velvety smooth sauce.  While the steaks rested I added a few thin slices of Brie on top of the steaks.  Whoa!!!!  Over-the top flavor. If you are going to indulge in a meat centered main course this is the one!!

five star recipe but only gave 4 because I made changes. I used serrano honey basalmic and added about 2 Tbsp of brown sugar. I pan seared the steaks and added garlic and oil to the pan to baste. Reduced the sauce and served with roasted red potatoes and asparagus. loved it!

Excellent!  I did make some changes.  I had a rib-eye, cut it two, let it come to room temperature, and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Sliced mushrooms and shallots, and sauteed them in olive oil on medium-high.  Added the steaks, and seared on all sides.  Removed the steaks, and covered with foil.  Added to the pan the red wine and balsamic vinegar.  Cooked with the mushrooms until somewhat reduced, then added in about 1 Tbsp brown sugar and 1 Tbsp butter.  Reduced some more.  Added the steaks back in, and cooked until they were about 135 degrees with the instant-read thermometer, medium rare.  Plated steaks with mushroom sauce poured over ... really YUMMY!.  Served with fresh french bread to soak up the sauce.  I can't add a photo because we ate it up eagerly!

The combination of Balsamic and wine gave it a bitter taste. Next time I'll add beef broth instead of the wine.

This recipe is great! My 20 year old made this for my birthday. I was shopper and sous chef. His first time cooking a dinner. He added his own combination of herbs and spices to season the meat. We had a good quality balsamic vinegar that wasn't too acidic. It and the red wine made a delicious sauce. He followed the recipe times and kept his in longer because he prefers a medium cook. 
The results were amazingly tender and flavorful! Went well with the roasted garlic mashed potatoes.
 I told him that if he makes this for a future girlfriend, she'll be his forever!

So easy and absolutely delicious !  I'd suggest doubling up on balsamic and wine but a lot of bang for time and effort. We look forward to making it again!

Doubled the sauce and added sliced, sauteed mushrooms and a teaspoon of brown sugar. It was delicious.

Very good... Made it for Valentine's Day and the wife loved it. I spent a little more for higher quality meat and vinegar and it paid off. Thanks for the great meal, will be using it again!

I made it for Valentine's day for my wife and we loved it. We made the sauce separately like some others did. We doubled the balsamic and added brown sugar and garlic. The steaks I cooked on a pan. I seared them for 1 minute each side, then turned down the heat to finish cooking. It took longer than 5 minutes per side to finish. Near the end I did drizzle some sauce on them and finished cooking them. We both loved the sauce even though we weren't too sure about it beforehand.
I paired it with one of our favorite sides, roasted red potatoes cooked with cajun seasoning and bell peppers and onions. I usually make them spicier, but this time I put some brown sugar on them as well and drizzled some red wine and balsamic over them. They were still great and went much nicer with this meal.

Excellent base, however I added a tsp of fresh garlic and a tsp of cane sugar.  I grilled our steaks and simply put this glaze in a pan and reduced it while our steaks cooked.  I completed the meal by drizziling the glaze on the steaks before serving.  The glaze was incredible and paired well with the steak, grilled asparagus and crab legs.

My husband, the cattle ranchers son, called this the best steak he's ever had! I left the steaks at room temp for about 45 minutes after salt/pepper just to tenderize. Also, I had a couple of larger (6-7 oz) cuts so I needed to cook about 2 extra minutes on each side. I used a meat thermometer to about 155 degrees. We had a super easy Valentines dinner for two that looked and tasted like a meal at a top notch steakhouse. I want to try this recipe with some other (less expensive) cuts of meat when I have to feed the whole family!

Made this tonight for our Valentine dinner. My husband said it was the best steak he's ever had. I used a Merlot and Militello's Balsamic Vinegar and a tablespoon of crushed garlic. So tender and the glaze was nice and thick. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe as-is, no alterations.  It was delicious and made our Valentine Day dinner perfect!  The meat was tender and the sauce gave sophistication without excessive work.  Thank you for the video; it was very helpful, too.

I gave 4 stars because hubby loved the balsamic glaze.  The steak was perfect, but the glaze was a little strong for me.  Somewhat overpowered the filet.  I will make again though.

I greatly enjoyed this recipe. It really depends on personal taste. If you prefer the taste of red wine over balsamic vinegar, then you need to increase the amount of red wine and decrease the amount of the balsamic vinegar. The same visa versa. I also added garlic and another assorted seasoning or two. I felt it gave the recipe a little more. Overall, I am very pleased with this recipe.

I made the filet mignon and glaze separately as recommended and the filet came out great. Left my filets rest for about 90 min and it kept it so tender. Salted and peppered to taste. Seared top, bottom, and sides to keep the juice in. For medium, cooked the top and bottom for 4 min each. For medium rare, 2-3 min. Made the glaze separately using all ingredients, and added garlic. Reduced for about 15 min, but it was still very thin... The sauce was good but not amazing. The filet was great on it's own.

This glaze has become my husband's favorite. I double the amount and reduce over the stove in a separate pan. I broil the filets wrapped with bacon for about 10 min each side. A definite keeper!

Soooo YUM! Had no brown sugar so added turbinado. While steak rested, added pat of butter & reduced sauce. A HUGE keeper!

I'm more of a vegetable person, but my boyfriend made this for Valentine's Day and it was amazing!!  He added some garlic to the pan and cooked a bit longer than recommended and it was just right.

This is a really great, basic recipe however the key is to let the steaks sit, rest, and become room temp. before cooking.  I cooked two 8 ounce steaks (4 ounces would have been way too small for dinner) on a cast iron skillet.  One min. on each side first, then 4 four mins on each side for medium rare...it was perfect.  I added brown sugar and butter to the sauce however the sauce was too thin as I would have preferred it to be a bit more syrupy.  Also, I plan to reduce the balsamic vinegar in half next time I make this sauce.  I thought it over powered the steaks just a bit.  Paired the steaks with roasted red potatoes and sauteed green beans and mushrooms and it was a wonderful meal.

Delicious! I am a novice cook and this was super easy to make! I followed others' suggestions and added butter and brown sugar to the glaze, and cooked the sauce separately from the meat. I also bought the filet mignon from Whole Foods, which is pricey, but definitely excellent quality. If you're a new cook that is looking to impress, this is a great way to start!

I made the suggestions of other reviewers and this was perfect. I gave it 4 stars since I believe the changes were necessary. 1c balsamic, 1c red wine, 1tbs brown sugar and reduced. I broiled my steak and then put Gorgonzola on top, melted, and spooned the glaze on that.

EASIEST, QUICKEST, TASTIEST way to cook filet mignon! Done in 20 and tastes restaurant fancy! Mmmmm. We used a chocolate dessert wine and topped the filets with sauteed portobello slices. YUM!

I followed some of the suggestions and grilled the beef for 4 minutes per side.  It turned out perfectly.  I added a couple of fresh garlic cloves to the reduction (I doubled the recipe) and served the sauce on the side in ramakins for people to dip their meat into.  It was a big hit with everyone.

I followed this exact recipe and it was delicious! I only had red cooking wine (not a good dry red wine) and it will still so yummy. The steak was so tender. I will make this again and try some of the other reviewers suggestions.

Fantastic! I had the sauce mixture on the side as a dipping sauce (as someone else suggested) but added a squirt of honey and some garlic. It was great and so easy to do.

Wow, what a wonderful dish!  I followed the recipe except I added a little butter and a sprinkle of brown sugar.  I added mushrooms during the 8 minute cooking time.  My filets were about 1 1/2 inches thick.  I think they were overdone.  There was a tiny patch of almost pink right in the center.  I'm more of a medium rare kind of person.  They were still fantastic.  I made them for Valentines Day.  I think I'll make them for Christmas.  Very easy and oh so tasty!

So good!  Wine & balsamic you really can't go wrong.  I also cooked the sauce on the side...cooked with sauted minced garlic & mushrooms & a lil bit of brown sugar. the mushrooms became a pretty burgundy color & were delicous even all by themselves. Used Malbec wine & served with the rest. YUM!

Sauce was good - yes you have to boil up so when it cools down it's thicker.  (I also added brown sugar as well.)  My filets were tender because I let them marinate, however broiling them, they ended up over cooked.

I was searching for something to make for Valentine's Day and came across this recipe, that was featured...needless to say, it was fantastic! My husband and i both loved it. It was quick and easy to make, and tasted like something you would get at a pricier restaurant. My suggestion would be, to double or triple the  balsamic vinegar and wine...after it reduces down, you have extra glaze for the steak, or any side dishes, it's even good on bread!

This was outstanding!!  I made it for a romantic dinner and it turned out so flavorful and delicious - it really enhanced the flavor of the filets!  I didn't use a non-stick pan, so I did sear them in a little bit of olive oil, but other than that, I made these as written.  Easy, quick and delicious!!

This was good but not great.  Based on the other suggestions, I grilled the meat & made the glaze on the stovetop.  I sauteed some minced garlic in olive oil THEN added the vinegar & wine.  After reducing I drizzled it on top of meat.  I'd like to see more depth to the flavor of the sauce.  Next time I'd use some butter instead of Olive Oil.

AWESOME! I broiled the filet and did the glaze separately like other's suggested and it was incredible! My husband couldn't beleive I cooked it, he's used to eating like that from a 5 Star restaurant!

We chose this to go with cheese fondue.  We made this exactly as per the recipe without alterations.  The flavor was fabulous, especially in combination with the flavor of the fondue, but I could not get the vinegar/wine mixture to cook down into a true glaze - it simply evaporated.  Will definitely make this again, and make a few alterations to try to get it do cook down a bit into a true glaze

not complicated. never did become a glaze. don't waste your money on filet mignon. it will taste exactly the same with a much cheaper cut. wrong choice to try for a special meal. this is much more everyday.

The balsamic glaze is what makes this recipe fantastic! Like fellow reviewers I grilled the steaks and made the glaze separately. I also followed the advice of doubling the balsamic, adding a clove of minced garlic and a tablespoon of brown sugar. Definitely a winner!

Quite tasty - I made this for my honey on Valentine's Day.  I used some of the other reviewer's suggestions, such as letting the meat rest and making the sauce on the stovetop.  I don't think I let the sauce reduce quite enough - it was still tasty, though.  I also broiled the filets rather than doing them on the stovetop.  My honey pronounced me "Top Chef" on the spot!  :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was very easy, and good.  Not one of the more exciting recipes for filet.  I did cook some sauteed mushrooms to go with this.  Made a rice pilaf with nuts and currants to go with it, and green beans.  Made a nice dinner.

Followed the suggestions to let the filets rest after searing each side, then again after cooking each side 4 minutes. During the second rest, I let the glaze boil down. . .a bit undercooked for my liking, but perfect if you like it med-rare. Great taste! Will make this again.

Great. This was our Valentine's Day Dinner. Followed to the T.  However, next time I will buy a filet from a nice meat market...the individually packaged ones from my regular grocery store injected with solutions just had a weird texture.  But the sauce was excellent and it was quick and easy. I will do this again.

It just doesn't get any easier than this! Simple & quick when followed to the "T". Many variations are possible. The glaze formed from the balsamic vinegar & red wine is simply outstanding with a slight hint of sweet.

Absolutely delicious!  We also removed the steaks before making the balsamic glaze.  This let the meat rest while the meal was being completed.  Will DEFINITELY make again!!

Looks like I joined a lot of other people and made this for my sweetie for Valentine's. I didn't much care for the glaze either. Too much vinegar, I used a good balsamic. Used a good red wine and drank the rest with the dinner. It did come out a nice medium rare, maybe even a bit more on the rare side. Will try a different glaze.

Love this simple filet recipe!  I followed the advice of others and took the steak out when cooked to my taste and then cooked down the balsamic glaze until it thickened. Yummy!

Wowzahs!!  This was phenomenal.  Of course, I did buy 2 inch tenderloin steaks from a local butcher at about $25 a pound(yikes!).  But it was totally worth it.  The meat was SOOOOOooo tender and yummy.  My husband is more of a "plain beef" kind of guy.  But I really love the tartness that the wine and vinegar impart to the meat.  This is excellent!  We had it for Valentine's Day with some mushroom risotto and an avocado and tomato salad.  What a meal!  :-)

I browned the 4 oz. filet mignon steaks in my George Foreman grill for 1 minute while the sauce was heating in a skillet.  Then, I added the steaks to the skillet, covered and cooked for 4 minutes - perfect medium rare and delicious.

No Need to change a thing about this fab recipe. Why try to perfect what's already excellent? It's simple, fast and easy. DH (dear husband) loved it for his V-day dinner. A must for successful cooking is using quality meat, quality balsamic vinegar and quality dry wine. I used a lovely aged reserve Chianti. Buy only premium products it is worth the difference.

The balsamic glaze was TO DIE FOR.  I browned the steaks, then removed them from the pan to rest for the 5-10 minutes or so that it took to cook the balsamic vinegar and wine down to a syrupy consistency.  I'm not usually a fan of vinegar, so I was a little leary of this recipe.  But either balsamic vinegar is just considerably sweeter and mellower than regular vinegar, or after cooking down to a syrupy consistency the vinegar sweetens and mellows.  I don't know, but this glaze was defintely sweet, smooth, and mellow and not vinegary at all.  Loved it. I ended up drizzling the left-over glaze on my steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes because I loved it so much.  The steak was pretty good too. :)

Delicious recipe - but for me the cooking times were way off and my steaks would've been well done (we like ours more medium rare).  I seared both sides for one minute, added liquid and covered for maybe 1 minute, uncovered and turned and cooked 3 more minutes total and they were perfect.  My husband didn't think you could cook a great steak on the stove before trying this recipe - will make again for sure.

This was what I cooked for my husband for Valentine's Day and it was surprisingly easy.  He really liked it.  I didn't have dry red wine, so I used a sweet red wine and it was delicious.  I went "slighly" under 1/2 cup on the balsamic vinegar and filled it up to 1 cup on the red wine.  I cooked the sauce a bit more after removing the steaks, the poured the sauce over the steaks.  4 minutes wasn't quite enough for us for each side so I cooked them about 5 minutes each side.  He said it was restaurant quality.  It would have been great to have focacio bread to dip in the wine sauce.

My husband and I had this Valentines night and it was way better than going out to eat!  We used to revision as a previous reviewer (1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup merlot, a couple of teaspoons of brown sugar) and glazed over the meat topped with melted gargonza cheese!  AWESOME:)

I heated a cast iron skillet on medium high and seared both sides of the steak for a minute. I reduced the temperature and added the vinegar/red wine (doubled and used a Cab and Stonehouse Balsamic) and cooked each side for three minutes (reduced from four since the cast iron was still pretty hot) while keeping covered.  I had two steaks: one about 7 oz and the other 6 oz.  The 7 oz steak turned out about a medium, the 6 oz a medium-well, which worked out well for us.  Also, the steam was very acidic, and I was worried that the vinegar was going to overpower the steak, but it turned out to be just right.  I'd say 4.5 stars, the boyfriend says 5, so 5 it is.

I was looking forward to serving this with all the great reviews and I really love balsamic vinegar.  I made it as others have recommended, by cooking the steaks separate and making the glaze in a saucepan with the addition of brown sugar. I also had prepared earlier some diced onions and baby portabella mushrooms sauted in olive oil to use with the sauce.  The steaks were wonderful, the onions/mushrooms were wonderful, but the sauce was disappointing.  Too vinegary by far and it really made the house smell bad for my guests.  I have had far better sauces, even from a package "doctored" up.  Luckily the sauce was on the side so no one's steak was ruined.

It is frustrating to read reviews with so many revisions they may as well be a completely different recipe.  We made this as is for a romantic Valentine dinner and it was delicious.  We topped our steaks with fried mushrooms and also made "Perfect Baked Potato" and "Asparagus Parmesan" from this site.  A lovely bottle of wine and a decadent bakery New York cheesecake made this a perfect high end restaraunt quality dinner.

Good thing I doubled the sauce.  After removing the cooked filets from the frying pan, my husband immediately rinsed it out -- along with the sauce! Luckily, I had extra sauce kept warm on the stove.  As for the cooking process, I got the sauce simmering first in a small pot and kept it on the side. I then seared the filets, one minute per side, in a bit of olive oil. Next, I added about half the sauce to the filets and continued cooking them, covered, for 8 minutes. The sauce reduced quickly and was not "too much liquid," as some reviewers feared.   As the recipe title states, the sauce truly becomes a rich, dark glaze.  The meat was so tender. Only change I made was added garlic. This paired well with the "Lobster Tails Steamed in Beer" recipe from this site. The lobster did not conflict with the richness of the filets, because there was no real beer flavor in them.  A Valentine's Day treat for sure! And, we had a bit of leftover filet and sauce this morning to go with eggs.

I may this for my wife & I for a romantic Valentines Day dinner. It turned out great. I decreased the Balsamic slightly & increased the wine by about half again. Once the meat was done I removed it and then reduced the glaze to my desired consistency. It took a little longer as I added mushrooms, which as they cook release liquid. Overall this was a very easy recipe that has a lot more style then your average grilled steak.

Very good! I doubled the recipe, added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and a fully rounded tablespoon of brown sugar and let it reduce. I grilled my seasoned filets separately until internal temp was 160° and made the glaze on the side. Would definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

The steaks came out perfect for our Valentine's Day dinner!  I followed the advice of others and added garlic, (red) onions, mushrooms and a pinch of brown sugar.  I was afraid it might be too vinegary like someone said but it was just right!  I'd just like to point out that heating time will vary depending on how big your steak is... ours came medium-rare following the instructions (but at least that's how we like it!)

My boyfriend gives this a def five star! However, I have to go down to four. I really enjoyed this recipe as it was very close to a restaurant style meal and quite easy. I followed the suggestions of others and added garlic and brown sugar. I also doubled the vinegar per other users suggestions. Do not recommend! Either follow recipe as is or use a lil less (my opinion) vinegar is a bit overpowering. However the problem with this recipe was even though I simmered the sauce it never became a glaze. Even after it sat once cooked. The four stars is simply that it was very thin and runny. The flavor however was very good and the filets turned out great.

I used a good quality wine and vinegar, yet it was totally lacking in any flavor at all.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Liquid was not a glaze at all.

I made this for my husband for valentine's day dinner and he absolutely loved it as did I.  I followed the recipe except I added a large pinch of brown sugar to the glaze.  I also poured the excess glaze in small dipping bowls and it was all gone at the end of the meal!

This is the best and easiest filet ever.  The key is to use an excellant balsamic. I usually dip my bread in the extra sauce - truly 5 star!

Good base recipe.  I think next time I will try this with a little less balsamic vinegar - that seemed to stand out a bit to me.  This was good nonetheless and I'll probably go with the add-ins that some other people suggested for my next try.

My husband really hates marinades or any sauce for meat but not this one. He loved it! We live in Brazil, where barbequing meat is an art. I always try to find different ways to serve Filet Mignon and this is my new favorite. Just let your filets rest about an hour before frying.

This was really good, as per some other reviewers I may a few changes.  I kept the vinegar and wine the same amount, I added crushed garlic and a little white and brown sugar, put it in a saucepan and let it form to a glaze.  Use goat cheese on top of the filet and topped with the glaze.  It was terrific.

I made this for me and hubby and loved it.  I don't know if there is a difference between balsamic vinegar and distilled vinegar, but I used distilled and it still came out great.  It wasn't a glaze...more like a sauce...but it was still yummy.  Would try this recipe again.  :)

I liked this, but i made the sauce on the stove seperate from the steak. I grilled the steak to medium on grill with just olive oil, salt and fresh ground pepper. Sauteed the vinegar, wine, and added a little honey until reduced. It thickened up after sitting for a little while. I enjoyed it with a baked potatoe and a glass of wine.

I really liked this recipe a lot.  We also opted to grill the filets after letting them sit for about an hour with a garlic, salt and pepper rub.  Wthin the final minutes, we added a bleu cheese and butter compound.  While the filet was grilling, I reduced red wine, balsamic vinegar and brown sugar.  My mixture was not quite thick enough, so I added a little corn starch as well, which helped. The gorgonzola mixture was imperative to complement the wine reduction sauce.  The flavors were wonderful!

Altered it based on others reviews.  Seared the meat, then broiled.  I don't know if it's just me, but I had to broil the meat longer than noted since we don't like our meat bleeding...after putting the meat back in for round 2, it turned out great.  The reduction was fabulous...

After reading other members reviews, I reduced the balsamic glaze on the stovetop before pouring it over my steak, rather than cooking the steak in it.  It was wonderful, although I should have reduced it just a little more.  I would definitely recommend this... wonderful flavor!  Next time I will try it as the recipe says, and I am sure that it will turn out just as good!  Thanks!

I made this for Valentine's day for my boyfriend. It was divine. I didn't cook the meat in the sauce but still followed the cooking directions otherwise. I added a generous pinch of brown sugar to the reduction and poured it over the cooked filets. I will definately keep this one for special occasions

I made this for Valentine's dinner. It was great! I did use a petite sirloin instead of filet. Also I sauted mushrooms in butter and added those into the sauce the last few minutes. It has a sweet yet vinegar flavor.

A true winner. The Glaze is Delicious. I used seasonsed salt, instead of plain salt - it probably won't matter either way. I will definitely make this again - it was just two easy.
I served it with buttered green beans and wild rice.
Have fun cooking!

Excellent!  I grilled the meat, but made up the sauce & drizzled it over after grilling.  Amazing flavor!  Drizzle it over rice or potatoes as well.

This recipe came out PERFECTLY (and this is coming from someone who always overcooks the steaks!  I too added a bit of brown suger to the recipe (like other users suggested). It was SO yummy and SO easy, and my hubby wants me to make it again soon! I think this is the only steak recipe I'll use anymore!

Grilled the filets on our George Foreman, then followed other reviewers' suggestions to add a pinch of brown sugar to the glaze then heat until thickened.  Made this for valentine's day and my husband raved.  He even dipped his bread in the sauce he loved it so much.

This was pretty good.  The sauce was a little thin for my taste and I believe next time I will cut down the wine just a bit.  Other than that, not bad.

I don't actually eat red meat, but I made two of these steaks for Valentine's Day and my boyfriend ate them both with abandon :)  He said the balsamic was a little too intense, and in general I'd agree -- probably would cut back on amount of liquid used, especially the strong vinegar.

I almost made the glaze seperately after reading reviews, but decided to follow the recipe, and I am so glad I did! The filets absorbed in some of the glaze and it was Delicious!  Great recipe!

I basically stuck to the recipe except that I did use the recommendation of adding a hint of brown sugar.  I used a grill pan to make some grill marks on the meat, and then moved it to a smaller pan to cook it the rest of the way so that I could cover it more easily.  The thing that really made the recipe for us was that I topped the filets with caramelized onion.  YUM!!  I served it with mashed sweet potatoes.  My husband said this was the best home cooked meal he's ever had.

This was awesome and easy!  Made this for Valentines day along with the Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce, twiced baked potatoes, garlic cheese biscuits and chocolate covered strawberries.  They were a great combination.  Also I had never cooked a steak in a skillet, always on the grill.  This is great for the winter months when it is too cold to cook outside!

Super easy and I liked how simple the ingredients were, as I already had most in my kitchen.  Instead of Filet Mignon, I used a large, thick cut NY Steak and divided it into two portions.  For the wine I used a Cabernet Sauvignon.  As other reviews suggested I added brown sugar and garlic, however I felt doubling the liquid created too much glaze for the amount of meat.  Of course cooking time is going to depend on how well done you like your meat.  I can't wait to try this again.

made this for Valentine's dinner except I too did not cook the steak in the sauce as I was wanted to BBQ the meat.  I don't like pan fried steak!  Doubled the sauce and added a pinch of brown sugar.  I thought it was very rich and could only use a smidgen amount dipped on the very tip of my bite, my husband on the other hand, loved it and dunked his!!  I feel like it needs more depth with maybe a fresh herb like Thyme or something or fresh or roasted garlic but it's quick that's for sure.
Thank you

This was part of a Valentines Day dinner. As another reviwer said, I let the steak rest and come to room temp. I used fresh ground black pepper sprinkled on the meat before browning. I used a 12" pan (I didn't have anything smaller)using 1/4 cup of wine (Merlot) and vinager. I had two fairly good sized filets. Cooked them for about 5 minutes per side, coating meat with the juices several times during this time.
The fillets "were to die for!"
This recipe goes in my cook again file.

This was awesome!  I didn't use red wine though...just used the balsamic vinegar and some olive oil.  Also served with sauteed mushrooms over the top.  Didn't think that a steak on the stove top would be that great, but was incredible.  My husband said it was gourmet!

I want to say that I followed JDVMD's recommendation on the review and  honestly, my wife and I have never had a better steak. I bought the steaks from Costco, follow the review, not the origianl reciepe, grilled the steaks on the BBQ, added the cheese, broiled for five and drizzled their recommended  sauce.... Wow.... BEST steak we have ever done. 

I am not plagerizing here,,, but I followed this....

Reviewed on Feb. 11, 2004 by JDVMD
Here's the trick to make this recipe work: We seasoned the filets with salt and fresh ground pepper and let them rest out of the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes; THEN, we grilled them. In the meantime, we mixed the balsamic vinegar, red wine (used Bordeaux) and a generous pinch of brown sugar. Let it reduce and then served in little sauce cups alongside the filets. My husband LOVED this. I didn't want to take the chance of ruining some great filets by cooking them in the wine/vinegar mixture since a lot of people were turned off by this in their reviews. By allowing it to reduce, it was a little bit thicker (still a bit too thin for me however) and you can merely dunk your bite into the sauce, thereby adjusting how much or little you would like. Will make this again because of the simplicity of the recipe.

This is a really good recipe. I've used it twice now. The first time I didn't cook the steaks in the glaze because I was concerned, as others were, that it would not be to my liking. I just made it seperately and then spooned it over the steaks. It was very good so the second time I cooked it seperately for a few minutes and then added it to the meat. Very good again!! I also added about 1 Tbsp of brown sugar as others have recommended.

I made this for my guy for Valentines day.  The smell of the vinegar/wine cooking down wasn't very romantic, but other than that it was very moist and I loved the sauce-good basic-- I added a tablespoon of brown sugar and already sauteed mushrooms the last few minutes of cooking.

AMAZING!!  I cooked this for my husband on Valentine's Day.  He said it was the best steak he had ever eaten.  I am not a big meat eater and the bite I tried was DELICIOUS!!  Every bite was full of flavor and very juicy.  I took the advice of others and cooked it for about 7 minutes per side.  I used a small skillet which kept the liquid from thinning-out away from the steak while it was cooking.  May be this helped too, I don't know?

This was soo easy to make and cleaning was quick.  I wrapped bacon around the filet mignon and it came out just perfect. My fiance loved it. I made it with roasted potatoes and buttered brocolli. Thanks for the great recipe, I am making it again next week. :o)

This is an awesome recipe. So easy, so classy, and perfect for a romantic evening. My husband and I have had this three times and it has turned out perfect every time. I use a little extra wine and balsamic vinegar so as to have extra sauce. It also goes great with green beans and we always use a red wine that we can also drink.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I Quadrupled the recipe and added four cloves of minced garlic along with 4 tbls. of brown sugar (based on other reviews.)  We did these on the BBQ and they were fabulous!  Thank for the recipe!

I made this a couple nights ago for me and my boyfriend, and it was delicous! I made the balsamic sauce as a gravy, adding a couple tsp of sugar and some cornstarch to thicken it (me and my boyfriend are not the most patient) and although it had a scary pungent smell, it tasted AMAZING!

Oh my goodness - this was sooooo delish! I had to use white wine 'cuz I didn't have any red but you couldn't tell (got that idea from the Balsamic Mushrooms off of this site). Anyway - I ended up using twice as much balsamic in the sauce and did that separately as I had children who don't like vinegar! I then let it reduce quite a bit - a little too much because it became very hard after it cooled - like sticky candy. It was still so good but next time I'll double or triple the sauce just to have extra! I'll be doing this one a lot - it was a wonderful melding of flavors!

This came out pretty good, I did not like the taste of the wine though. i was told you shouldnt cook with wine you wouldnt drink. So im gonna have to find one i will drink. Eventhough i am not a wine drinker. But other than that it was pretty good. Thank You!

Unfortunately I overcooked my steak just a bit. (not used to cooking steak on stovetop) Inspite of the slightly overcooked steak, the flavor was yummy. I'd make this again.

I prepared the sauce using good quality balsamic vinegar & basic table red wine.
The sauce was very tasty.  Unfortunately, I used a lesser quality of meat – which is a poor reflected on me – not this recipe.  The sauce alone is worth giving this recipe a try.

I like the taste of this glaze.  I made two ribeyes and used 1/2 cup each of the wine/vinegar.  Of course it took longer to cook, but that only helped the steaks absorb more of the flavor.  I didn't have to put any of the glaze on top because it was so tender and flavorful.

I had never made filet mignon before and wanted a recipe that seemed easy.  This was so easy and tasted delicious.  It took me much longer than 4 minutes on each side, but I used a meat thermometer to get the meat just right.

This really was awfully nice--and I went into it having real trepidation about messing with two beautiful tenderloins.  I did toss a minced clove of garlic into the wine/vinegar mix, didn't double anything and was rewarded with a lovely, dark and delicious sauce and perfectly seared meat.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was okay. I made the sauce separately since I got prime filets. I didn't want to mask the wonderful flavor of the meat. The sauce was good and was also good over the asparagus we had. I will probably make this again. I added a TBL of brown sugar and a small clove of garlic.

I soo looked forward to this. The meat was tender, but there wasn't much taste other than red wine. I did double the sauce and it wasn't needed. I cooked mine for 15 minutes for well, and 10 for med rare.  I am not sure if I will make this again. It is one of those recipes were it wasn't bad, but wasn't all that good either.

My boyfriend made this for me, so I'm not sure of any alterations he may have made, but the basic flavors were awesome!  I really enjoyed this, though I would have prefered a slightly thicker sauce, I don't know if that was the fault of the recipe or the cook.

Great recipe; tastes just like you'd get in a restaurant.  I followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly medium rare.  I also made a blue cheese sauce to go with but it wasn't necessary; the steak was perfect as is!  Will definitely make again.

Again, I am not a very good cook, but this turned out great!  I used Balsamic Basil Dressing and cooked the steaks a little longer (my husband won't settle for anything less than well done.)  They turned out wonderful and tender! The sauce was almost tangy.  I have a feeling I'll be having a request to make these again this weekend.

WOW!!!  This was one of the best things I have ever ate.  I paired it with mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.  I did however add fresh chopped garlic when I added the meat to the sauce.  My meat loving man was amazed.

I am still on the fence with this one. Filets are such a tender flavorful cut of meat to begin with. I started my glaze a few minutes ahead of time, which I found to be a good idea. I added mushrooms and garlic. which I am glad I did! If this is a meal to impress! Try it ahead of time! you to may find yourself on the fence.

This is fantastic, like others I added garlic, I also added some rosemary. Its a good idea to start your glaze sooner or plan on taking your filet out and resting it while your glaze reduces. I also increased the amount of glaze  I made, served it w/ garlic mashed-- mmmmm

This was incredible!  Even my teenage son, a very picky eater, loved it!  After the cooking time was over, I set the meat aside to rest (so that it could reabsorb the juices.)  While I was waiting, I turned the heat up high and further reduced the glaze.  It turned out great!

INCREADIBLE!!!  Wonderful flavor and just an wonderful dish.  Even my 9 year old liked and and asked when we would be having it again.  Don't be affraid of the vinegar, it sweetens in the glaze and is almost good enough to eat alone!

This recipe was delicious.  I did, however, tweek it just a bit as others suggested.  I added minced garlic and some brown sugar, I also thought some minced onion would go well.  I enjoyed it and I will definatly be making my filets this was from now on.

The steak was very tender & flavorful. I took the advice of others and added the brown sugar, and a clove of garlic.  I also added 2 min of cooking time per side, which made it perfect for us. A bit of extra salt was added for flavor too.

Very good, restaurant quality. Used merlot, added garlic and onion and at serving time sprinkled a little feta on top. Hubby grilled the steaks and we poured this over. Thank you.

Very tasty.  As usual, I doubled the sauce/glaze.  As others suggested, I added brown sugar (2tbls because I doubled) and garlic (2 cloves freshly minced).  I cooked the filets as directed, removed them from the pan and cooked down the glaze.  The filets were perfect... tender and juicy.  I carmelized onions and mushrooms, also as suggested, and served them on the side.  The filets, however, were tasty enough on their own and the onions/mushrooms were overkill.  I would certainly make this again.

Definitely a 5-star recipe!! Had two filets marinating in olive oil and garlic pepper and was undecided on what to do with them when I stumbled upon your recipe. Used a good cab/merlot as the red wine and the glaze on the steaks was heaven!! My hubby said 'forget BBQ-ing filets, from now on this is the way he prefers them!' Many Thanks Linda!

Good Recipe, but kind of bland.  Next time I will add some spices...maybe some rosemary, thyme, and oregano to season the steak.  Other than that, a good base recipe!  Really easy!

I have a nearly identical recipe for ribeye, so feel free to branch out and use other cuts of steak. However, I do not add the wine when I make it--I just pan-fry the steaks quickly in butter/olive oil, remove the steaks, add vinegar and reduce the sauce. It's a sweet sauce that is delicious over the steak and accompanying potatoes!

Delicious!!  I used a different (cheaper) cut of meat and it was still fantastic.  I think cooking it covered keeps it tender.  I will definitely make it again.
