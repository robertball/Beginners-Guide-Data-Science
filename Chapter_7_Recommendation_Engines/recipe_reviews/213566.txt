Needing to make a Holiday dip and NOT wanting to go to the store - I made this with some modifications.  One can of salmon, 8 oz of regular cream cheese, green onions (4).  A squirt of lime juice in plastic lime.  Upped the horseradish to 1T and added liquid smoke (to taste).  YUMM-YUM

Thanks for sharing, Smokey!  I've made this twice with canned salmon, and last weekend I made it with fresh salmon, which I cooked and cooled.  It is excellent both ways! I prefer using cooled salmon fillets (easier than picking out all the bones from the canned variety and the skin kind of puts me off)  Use fresh lemon juice and as much horseradish as you like.  Enjoy!

Good low-carb recipe.. Made with 8 oz. regular cream cheese.. couple of drops of liquid smoke gave it that "smoked salmon" taste.. We ate this on celery and cucumbers.. My husband enjoyed it..Thanks

This recipe is a keeper! Made a few modifications: used the 14 oz can of pink salmon, 1/2 a small tub of good smoked salmon cream cheese, a few drops liquid smoke, 1 tbsp horseradish, lemon juice and 3 finely chopped green onions. Also added some dried dill, a few shakes worchestershire sauce and a few shakes tabasco. Added a tiny amount of salt. The key is letting it sit in the fridge for at least a couple hours to let the flavors marry a bit. Served on Wasa rye crispbread. I will be making this for all my get-together from now on! :)

Yum yum yum! Because I'm pregnant I try to stay away from tuna, and have been trying to find ways to use canned salmon. This is a winner in my book. Next I might try to find a way to make it a salad for a sandwich. Thanks for sharing this!

I love smoked salmon! This is a nice change from traditional smoked salmon with cream cheese on crackers. I also like the fact that this is a much more reasonable way of getting those flavors. Philly makes a salmon cream cheese in a tub. Although not labeled smoked salmon it does contain smoke in it.

Had no salmon cream cheese on hand, but did have regular cream cheese (whipped) and liquid smoke.  I think it would have been delectable had I used less liquid smoke.  It was ok otherwise.  I gave it a 4 stars based on what I think it would have tasted like with the salmon cream cheese...  will update next party opportunity.

Loved it. Had a can of salmon in my cabinet that had been there forever. Didn't really know how to use it, so I tried this. Now if it wasn't for the cost of canned salmon I would be making this all the time. Used two tablespoons of horseradish and regular cream cheese. Omitted the onions and parsley flakes.

Made this for Christmas appetizer.  Used smoked salmon caught up north by a friend.  I used original flavor cream cheese and served with cocktail rye.  Everyone liked it!

It worked really well for a low-carb snack with some deep-fried low carb tortillas used as a chip. It was maybe a little too fishy tasting for me so if I make it again, I'll try it with regular cream cheese.
