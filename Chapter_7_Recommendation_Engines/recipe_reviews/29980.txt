Great flavor and what a combination of vegetables. Next time I will add salt rather than soy sauce so that the color stays bright.

I was making Tandoori Chicken and was looking for an accompaniment. This mix of vegetables looked really interesting and the spices are close to a tandoori mix. I dislike the gooey liquid in canned beans so I drained and rinsed the beans as I always. To replace that I dissolved some flour in chicken stock and added that. I used the Tandoori spices instead of these didn't use soy mixed in the chicken and served on fresh baby spinach. Very nice!

This was ok but there is definitely room for improvement. It would be a lot more colorful if the color wasn't cooked out of the dish so much. Also the liquid from the beans gave the overall dish a murky look. Sorry but I won't be making this one again.

I thought this was bland and the color all cooked out so there wasn't much to recommend it. Probably won't make again.
