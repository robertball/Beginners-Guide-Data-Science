As written the bell pepper is overkill. I ended up only using a red and a green and that was still way too much. After mixing everything together there didn't seem to be enough cheese ratio so I ended up doubling that too. With that being said, these turned out pretty good. I definitely recommend scaling the bell pepper way back and adding more cheese.

I used mozza cheese, 1 orange pepper and half an onion..just based on what I already had in my fridge. They turned out super good, will definitely add to the keep pile.

I had to change a lot only because of what I had on hand. And I'm only reviewing this because it needs reviews.  I first cooked the steak on the grill so it was medium rare. I then added a 1/2  of a large chopped onion and 2 jalapeno peppers from my garden to kick it up a bit and I didn't have bell peppers. I then used rice paper rolls and it didn't work at all because they didn't stay rolled up, floating in the oil.  So, I made the last rolled up in the rice paper and didn't fry them. I liked it and it was much healthier.  I will for sure make this again when my teenage boys are home and use regular egg roll wrappers. I think they will love it.  Thank you!
