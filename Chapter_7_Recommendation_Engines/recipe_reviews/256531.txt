Very good!  I didn't dust with powdered sugar. Instead I poked holes in it and drizzled Kahlua liqueur over it and around the bottom edge. Made all the difference in the world. Kind of like a rum cake.

Nice twist with the orange zest and cinnamon. I might cut the orange zest next time so it's a little more subtle.

The only modification was adding a bit more orange zest and my guests LOVED it.  There was only one slice left for the birthday girl!  Will definitely be making this oh-so-simple-but-delicious recipe again.

I made this as written, and it really is very good. Texture is somewhere between cake and brownie, and flavor is mostly rich chocolate. I will make it again, but without the chocolate chips--there was so much chocolate that the chips weren't noticeable except as an odd texture here and there. And on half, I did as another reviewer suggested; I poured a bit more Kahlua over the top, like a rum cake; that side of the cake got eaten first.

Everybody ranted & raved. I did use the non alcoholic creamer of Baileys instead. Tasted wonderful, plus, pretty darn easy to make!

I've made a similar cake for over a decade, maybe two. This recipe has the addition of the orange zest and it is spectacular! 
Thanks for the fresh ideas. I put whipped cream or devonshire cream on it for those who find it too chocolatey! Wonderful. 
Use only fresh cake mix and pudding mix, don't pull from your pantry on this - they get stale and it will show in this cake.

This cake tastes amazing.  Drizzled chocolate sauce over and put a drop of mousse with it.  It was a winner

This was fantastic!  Very rich, moist, full bodied flavor without being overbearing.  I made a thick paste of the confectioners sugar with Kahula to pour over cake rather than dusting with the sugar alone - was "wow'd" by all!

It was pretty good.  You can't taste the Kahlua that much.

I enjoyed making this. This was so good and moist. I did cut the orange zest in 1/2 And you still could sense it. Instead of the powdered sugar atop I wanted to use this coconut I had laying around. I browned the sweetened coconut in a dry pan and sprinkled on top the cake. What a great flavor combo. However, next time I need to have something (a drizzle of caramel?) that the coconut can adhere to because it didnâ€™t stay on cake very well alone.

I LOVE this cake!   Very rich chocolate, and the orange zest was very strong.  Super easy and worth every calorie!
