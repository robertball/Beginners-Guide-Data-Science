This was great for using up the leftovers that I hate to throw out.  I did make a few changes.  I used fresh carrots, onions, celery and corn.  I added 1/2 cup of milk and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead. If my kids even think a mushroom has been in the same room as their food they run!  lol  I also used the drop biscuit recipe from Bisquick as the topping.  The family loved it and it was quick and easy to make.  Thanks for this great, quick and easy way to use up those leftovers!

Loved it even though I didn't use a pie crust.  I just served it over toast and it was still great!  I can't wait to try the rest in a pie crust.

I didn't have frozen mixed vegetables, so instead I chopped one raw potato and a raw carrot and cooked it in the microwave before adding to filling. Then I added about 1/2 cup of frozen green beans. Fabulous! So comforting and delicious... I felt like Peter Rabbit munching on Turkey pie down in my rabbit hole.

This was terrific. I was making this for a group of 6 so I bought two deep dish pie crusts (which I pre-baked in the oven for 10 mins to get it little crispier), didn’t think about the top. Stores were closed so I had to think fast...I had two Pillsbury Crescent Roll tubes in the fridge. I laid it out and pinched it all closed. I put it over the top of the pies, I then only had to bake them for 20 mins at 375 and the top was golden brown and crispy. I didn’t even have to add the aluminum foil as I brought the Pillsbury dough right over top of the pie shell sides. Needless to say nothing was left.....only the compliments.

I have cooked this recipe twice now. The first time I followed the directions to the T. The second time, instead of adding frozen vegetables, I cut up some fresh carrots and celery to use instead. I had to add an additional cup of water while mixing everything together, but the carrots and celery came out soft, and tasting delicious.

I use a similar recipe but what I do is while making the apple pie for thanksgiving is make up an extra pie crust or two.  Making sure that I actually cook enough extra vegatables and then the next day is making up the turkey pot pies, one for dinner and one or two for the freeze.  These pies really freeze well for emergency dinner solutions.

Yum, Yum, Yum. I now look forward to having left over turkey or chicken. I always use whatever fresh veggies I have in the house. It usually ends up being, carrots, potatoes and sweet potatoes may sound crazy, but it's soooo good). I par boil them and then add them as you would the frozen. Great recipe. Thanks

This recipe is really a great way to use up left overs after the "Huge" Thanksgiving meal.  Very delicious. I used Pilsbuy pie crusts and no 
mushrooms.  Turned out great and very easy to make.

I'm not really a pot pie person but my family really enjoyed this pie. It was a great way to use up some leftover turkey and it was easy enough to make. I do like the gravy as opposed to the cream of chicken soup that some quick pot pies call for. This made a huge pie for us and I would make it again.

This was fantastic! I used 1 tsp poultry seasoning, as I only had thyme (no sage). Instead of using a pie crust for a "lid," I used stuffing. I also added 1/2 c. (about 2-3 stalks) of celery. I only had canned mushrooms, so I just drained those and used them. For me, this recipe made 2, 10" deep dish pies. One box of stuffing covered both pies. Used same oven temp but lowered the time to 35 minutes. Definitely will make again.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled this and ended up with 3 double crusted deep dish pies - I also used 4 cups turkey and 2 cups stuffing to come up with the 6 cups needed when doubling.

This was quick and delicious. I loved that it used gravy versus cream of chicken. I used homemade gravy (about 1 3/4 c.) and I'm glad I added extra, otherwise it would have been dry. Also added poultry seasoning, parsley, and a little cayenne for kick! I would definitely make this again- a great dish when you can't possibly eat another turkey sandwich.

Used sliced criminis and the remaining 2 members of the Holy Trinity (carrots & celery). Forgot to add our leftover shallots and haricot verts, but hey, what a wonderful way to sew up Thanksgiving. Splashed a bit of Pinot Blanc to deglaze the pan early on - Success!

because I was multitasking I didn't add as much gravy as the recipe called for.  The plus side of that is that it didn't boil over.  I'll make this again and only add 1 1/2 cups of gravy.  I'd also rename as this was a turn-off to my step-son.

really liked it. i did modify however with homemade gravy and used fresh carrots, onions, shitake mushrooms and a potato.  i added frozen corn and peas later with the turkey.  used more seasoningthen called for and added poultry seasoning. i used buttermilk biscuit dough and used a rolling pin altho it didnt quite cover the pie plate to be sealed.  i would use a flaky thin pie crust next time.

I ended having to make this in 2 stages.  In reheating the onion, mushroom, butter they did brown.  Not sure if that made the flavor we didn't like.  I will try this again to see.  It is a easy way to use left overs.  I hope to be able to freeze a few of these for easy meals.

One lesson learned, and my only advice: deep dish pie shells are definitely what this recipe calls for. I doubled this recipe (I'm feeding 9!) and subbed veggies according to what I had, and because I used two regular pie shells, there was way more crust than filling, and I had to use a third pie dish to bake off what was remaining. In all honesty, this would probably be even better if there were no bottom crust. However, it was still enjoyable and the entire family, sans the pickiest one, ate it. 
There was a point where I encountered skepticism, as the smells from all the seasonings I'd used in my gravy and the smells that were called for in this dish almost fought each other, but the pot pie was delicious and will be repeated. Thank you for the recipe Linda!

I was wondering what I could make with my leftover turkey, and now I know a great recipe for not only that, but the gravy I usually end up throwing out. My entire family (including four children) loved it. I didn't have refrigerated crust, so made one with a recipe I got on AllRecipes and it turned out great. I doubled this and the crust recipe, and now I don't have to worry about dinner tomorrow night. Thank you!

This was very good.  I used my leftover turkey gravy, leftover green beans, corn and carrots.  I did not add mushrooms - boyfriend doesn't like them.  We thought may next time, we could add a little green bell pepper...  just a thought.

This is a wonderful recipe for left over turkey.  We don't much care for "dark" turkey and always have lots left over.  This dish is very flavorful and no one minds that dark turkey was used in it.

Perfect way to use up leftovers without having another day of turkey sandwiches!  We didn't bother with the frozen veggies, but threw in asparagus and other stuff from the meal and it was divine. I especially love that this is a way to use up the gravy that's left over!

Delicious - we used Penzeys Poultry Seasoning in lieu of the dried sage/dried thyme. Might want to add two pinches of salt as well, as that is a salt-free seasoning, but otherwise delicious flavor with the leftover turkey, mixed veggies, roux base, garlic and onions. Nice way to re-use leftovers from Thanksgiving.

I thought this was a very easy recipe and it yielded great results.  I wanted potato in mine so I diced up one potato and boiled it until it was just barely tender, then added it in with my other veggies (I used frozen peas and carrots).  A very tasty pot pie.  I think you'll be pleased with the results if you try it.

Exceptional recipe - I used evaporated milk to use up what I had left in the fridge.  The family gobbled it up.  Saved the recipe & will surely use it again.

This is one of my favoriteeee recipes I’ve ever got from allrecipes. I’ve made it multiple times.. even made a whole turkey specifically to make left over pot pie. The only thing I do different is leave out the mushrooms bc I’m not a huge fan. This filling is perfect exactttlyyy how you would want pot pie filling to be. Great recipe!!

This was delicious and easy to make. I threw in some chopped celery and carrots with the onion mushroom mixture and cooked those together. I skipped the frozen vegetables and doubled the recipe. To be honest, I didn't measure the turkey or vegetables. I just eye balled it.

Great flavor!  This was a wonderful recipe for using leftover turkey breast.  I had various frozen veggies (carrots, corn and green beans) that I threw in along with some potato.  As others suggested, I boiled the potato prior to cutting it up into pieces.

This recipe has become a family favorite. We use fresh diced carrots and frozen peas instead of the frozen mixed vegetables I just put the carrots in with the butter before the onion. It’s an easy to follow recipe that can be customized to taste.

This turned out better than I thought, I followed the directions except I didn't have frozen veggies so I just added some peas and a few spoonfuls of the carrots and onions that I pan roasted with my turkey.  I also omitted the Thyme. Thyme and Sage taste so much alike to me it's like doubling up on Thyme and I guess I just don't like the flavor.  I left the milk out of this recipe and added about a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of gravy, I had so much gravy leftover from dinner because I made about two quarts.

I made it with 50/50 white and dark meat.  Did not bake it.  Instead, I spooned the meat mixture into a warmed bowl and topped with a puff pastry prebaked crust.

Yummy, very flavorful.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I added celery and carrots. I made my crust from scratchand  I baked at 400 for the alloted time and brushed with egg.  Great base and I will continue to make this with additions.

I made this except I made four little pot pies instead of one big one.  I baked the pies at 475 for about 25 minutes (covering the crust with foil) then turned the heat down to 350, removed the foil around the crust edges and baked them for another 15-20 min or so until the crust looked golden brown.  I wish I took a picture of the insides but we ate these pies all up!  Also, I used left over baby carrots and peas that I made from our Christmas dinner (I did not use frozen mixed veggies like it says to in the recipe).  I diced the baby carrots by hand.  These pies turned out really great.

This is an excellent recipe! My first time making homemade pot pie and it’s so much better than store bought! I sautéed the onions and garlic in 2 tbl. Butter, with fresh carrots and celery, then added frozen peas and corn to the skillet. I added the turkey to the veggies and kept them warm while I made the sauce with turkey gravy, whole milk, and chicken broth in place of water. For the crust I used Pillsbury refrigerated dough. Couldn’t be easier or more delicious!

My husband was so thrilled with this recipe. He wanted 2nds and then for lunch the next day! I literally used all the leftovers from  the turkey I made a few days before. The only change I made was I sauteed everything in butter (even left over green bean casserole) with the gravy then put it in the pie shell. I also rolled out one of the defrosted pie shells to put it on top of the pot pie. It turned out awesome!

I loved the addition of mushrooms in this, and overall this was super easy and great use of leftovers.  I did add a couple of carrots and celery that I sautéed with the rest of the veggies.  I'll be making this every holiday!

Super simple recipe that turned out great! I added a few splashes of extra milk because the mixture seemed too pasty. I also wish I had some leftover gravy made from the turkey drippings, but the jarred kind was fine. Also, if there were cranberries left over, those would make the perfect topper to this recipe.

This was very easy and my family enjoyed it.  I did replace the frozen mixed veg with par boiled carrots and potatos as someone else suggested plus the frozen corn.  I will make again next time we have leftover turkey or chicken.

I made this with wild turkey legs that I had cooked in the slow cooker.  My family LOVED this.  I should have taken a pic before we served, because now all thats left is an empty pan!  The only changes I made were instead of frozen veggies I used fresh beans and carrots from our garden.  And because there was almost 5 cups of meat off the turkey legs, I increased the amount of milk and water to 1 cup each.
Will definately make this again.

First time I have felt the inspiration to leave a review.  I have been cooking for decades and this was the BEST pot pie I have ever made.  I did make the pie crust instead of store bought.  Husband loved it.  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe.

Ohhh myyyyy this was fabulous!! I didn't have thyme or mushrooms on hand so I omitted them. I added carrots, peas & corn to the recipe instead of a frozen veg mix. It came out so amazing! My husband makes the best turkey gravy, EVER so that really rounded off the deliciousness! Planning to make a few of these with Christmas turkey left overs. Holy yum!

This was amazingly wonderful and easy.  The only thing I changed was I used broth from turkey soup I had made for the water.  Very good flavors.  Will definitely make again and again.

I would make more of the gravy than the recipe calls for.  Once it baked, it was a little dry.

I made this today and we loved it. The only adjustments I made were the following : Used my turkey broth instead of water;  chopped fresh carrots instead of mushrooms; added 1/2 cup frozen corn; added 1/2 cup leftover stuffing;  and used an egg wash on top crust.

I doubled this recipe to make 2 pies and added an extra cup of gravy between them which still wasn't enough. No dipping in the gravy here. It wasn't dry, just personal preference. Do use a deep dish crust; I had enough filling to make a third pie. Very tasty though

Advice for those not in the know: find the pre-made pie pastry in the dairy section near the Pillsbury biscuit dough. I wandered around bit dazed. This was very good. Husband v. happy. Added leftover potato I cooked in advance and used slightly smaller package of frozen mixed veg. Put aside my prejudice of store-bought gravy, and it might have been the tastiest part.

What a perfect way to get the last turkey into a delicious different dish. Nothing left in the dish. Didn't change a thing. A keeper for sure.

I love anything wrapped in pastry and this was an excellent way to use up leftover Christmas turkey. I prepared this exactly as directed and it came out delicious. Takes a bit of time in preparation but certainly not difficult to prepare. Saving this to my favorite turkey file. Thanks for posting.

I did not like the flavor of this at all.  My husband and kids did not like it either.  I'm not sure what it was.  It could have been the spices but I will try a new left over turkey recipe next year!  Wish I could give a positive review on it along with all the others.

This turned out amazing, and baking is NOT my strong suit.  But the instructions were easy enough.  Since I couldn't find a pastry crust, I just prepared a simple boxed pie crust and it worked out fine.  The family loved it.  I would definitely make this again!

For pie crust I used the one in Better Homes cookbook. For veggies: fresh grean beans chopped in to 1 inch pieces, mushrooms, 3 whole chopped carrots, and edamame beans. For gravy: 1 can cream of mush soup, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup water. Freaking awesome!! TIP: only use veggies your family will love!

This was a relatively easy recipe to whip up (with three little boys, 2 of whom are teething). I used an "impossible" sourdough biscuit crust to make this even easier (I hate making pie crusts), left out the mushrooms (I love 'em, husband hates 'em), and it was delicious. This is my go-to recipe for white meat pies now.
