This was very good. I got A LOT of compliments on it. I did change it a little. I only used about a 1/4 cup of mayo. 1/2 cup of sour cream and a block of cream cheese. I used Colby/Jack cheese instead of Swiss.

This recipe tastes great, however it is sooooo unbelievably oily/greasy. I will try next time with low fat mayo to see if that helps but if not I probably will not make very often. The oil made it very unappealing and took almost half a roll of paper towels to soak it up.

Spread the leftovers on French bread and baked in the oven like garlic bread.

I'd rate this 4 1/2 stars, 5 with my adjustments... 1/2 cup light mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream, i used Maui Onions, The packaged shredded swiss, and served with sour dough bread rounds and sprinkled with fresh chopped scallions just before serving. Fantabulous!!

I have been making this recipe for years. I use half low fat mayo and half regular to cut down on the oily texture. I add chives, fresh or dried, for a little color. The first time I made this for my husband he complained bitterly about the smell, now I do not tell him it is ready until it has had time to cool, poor thing burns the roof of his mouth EVERY TIME because he just cannot wait.

I have baked this dip numerous times. My family loves it. However, it is pretty oily. I have found that if you use low fat mayo, it's better. If fact, I usually use a combination of low fat mayo and low fat Miracle Whip.

This sounded so good, but sadly it came out of the oven looking like a heart attack waiting to happen. I couldn't believe the amount of oil it produced. I was looking forward to trying this on New Year's Eve..but the oil ruined it.

I loved the flavor, but the presentation just ruins it. It is so oily that you just can not eat it. I used low fat mayo. I am glad I tried the recipe for my Husband and I before company.

Easy to make, and delicious! I should have made two it went so fast. Even I enjoyed this dip and I am not a fan of cooked onions! You must try for your next get together!

Excellent!  They were licking the bowl clean.  I added a bit of paprika on the top for color.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I have been making this for years and sometimes will add a bit of garlic.  In my neck of the woods, we refer to this as "baked fat" and all my bunco babes love it!!!

This was good but needed something. I put 3/4 of a 12oz. jar of Apricot Preserves on top, baked until bubbly and served it with toasted bagette slices. They ran out of bread and got the taco chips out. It was good with them too. They didn't stop until it was gone!

This recipe was just ok.  I liked it but I doubt I will make it again.
