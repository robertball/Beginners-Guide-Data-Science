I did everything wrong when making this recipe and yet, it turned out to be one of the best cakes I've made in a long time. And this isn't self-praise, this is certified by third parties. This recipe is perfectly forgiving. Let's begin:
I used gluten free flour, measuring it first then sifting three times (to keep it light and fluffy, like regular cake flour). As I added it to the batter, I realised it was much more than 3 cups. 
I bought the wrong kind of cheese, so I ended up having to use mascarpone instead. 
Nothing was at room temperature. 
I ran out of sugar halfway through, so only used 2.5 cups having to open little packets of sugar taken from a hotel room that I had rolling around in my purse. 
I realized, at the very last second, that I didn't have any almond extract, so I watered down some marzapane and added that.
I couldn't decide if I wanted this cake or the submitter's other pound cake with chocolate chips, so I made both in one. I added some chocolate chips to each layer of batter.
I ate about 1/3 cup of batter raw-it was really good. The cake was smaller than it should have been, so I didn't cook it for as long as I should have. Then after about 10 minutes I pricked it with a toothpick and it was still doughy inside, turned the oven back on and baked it for another 15 minutes.
I mean, in theory, this cake should have bit the big one. Instead, it was moist and delicious.
This recipe ROCKS! Thank you for sharing it.

I made it this afternoon and it came out moist and full of flavour. I did tweak a bit by replacing about 5 Tbsp of flour with cornflour for a lighter airy texture, reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup, replaced 1 cup white sugar with brown sugar, sifted the flour  3x together with baking powder and salt.
My sister and her husband were impressed and loved the cake. "This recipe is for keeps" ..said my sister. 
Thank You very much for sharing this outrageously splendid recipe !

Love this pound cake. 

NOTE: Next time I will use 1/4 cup less flour to make the cake more moist.

Followed as written, but sifted the dry ingredients before adding. Topped with a thin drizzle of melted chocolate.
Everyone at the family gathering loved it, but some thought it was slightly dry, and that more chocolate drizzle would've helped!

It was a good recipe but a little heavier recipe than I like.
