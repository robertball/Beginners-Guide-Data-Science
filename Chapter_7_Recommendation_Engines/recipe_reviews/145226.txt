If you don't like lots of sauce double the veggies or use 1/2 the sauce.

Made this as a side to last night's dinner and it's definetely a keeper. A delicious mix of flavors. I agree with most - to half the first 5 ingredients for the dressing - but no other changes are necessary. Deserves all 5 stars!

My husband sauteed the asparagus in olive oil with two cloves of garlic and that was fantastic.  I didn't have any feta so my family used shredded cheddar and that worked fine although I can't wait to try it with feta.  And, I hate cilantro so I didn't like the flavor it gave the dish.  So, next time and oh yeah... there will be a next time, I'll leave out the cilantro.

This is good. I ended up using goat cheese instead of feta (the idea of feta in this freaked me out a little and I didn't have any anyway). I almost think the salad would have been best without any cheese at all, but I guess that would defeat the recipe title. It WAS good, thanks! :)

Very good! We agree that the recipe makes too much dressing, so I cut it in half...also we omitted the cilantro, and it was very tasty and healthy with light feta!

Summer salad or not, I made this in the dead of winter and loved it. But I too think the dressing is a bit much so scale it back. I also tossed in a few black olives because I love them. We had it with (indoor grilled) salmon. Made the "minus 40 with windchill" we had last night fade into the background!

This was really good.  There was a little too much dressing for my taste though.  I think next time I will halve the dressing.

Wonderful!!!  Great flavor, easy to make.  Didn't have cilantro on hand so used parsley and it worked just fine.

Made this on Easter Sunday and it was wonderful.  It does make a lot of the vinaigrette but just drain some of that off when serving.  The flavors were fantastic.  I do not like cilantro so I omitted that.  My husband didn't care for it but our guests loved it also and each had 2 servings.  This one will be passed along to friends and family.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this twice now and was impressed both times.  I cut the dressing way back and only made about 1/4 of it for 2 servings of salad, which is still plenty.  I toss it all together except the feta.  I serve it at room temperature and then top it with the feta and toasted pine nuts.  This one's a winner!

Very good! I agree that it makes a bit too much dressing (and i'd even doubled the amount of asparagus/tomatoes) but it was still awesome.  Next time I'll use grape tomatoes b/c I prefer them.

I loved this salad. I don't use raw asparagus often, so when it said use all the asparagus cut into pieces, I did, and that was a mistake. Ditch the bottom thick tough pieces, but the top 3/4 of the stalk was very yummy. I'd probably also add some spinach or romaine so it's not SO dependent on the asparagus. Still, everything else was great!

Loved this salad! Due to other reviews that there was too much dressing..I cut the dressing in halve.  Perfect.  Also had some kalamati olives so tossed them in. Our guests scraped the latter clean!!

Very tasty! Like other reviewers, I thought there was a bit too much dressing, but I can easily adjust that the next time I make this.  Yumm!

Awesomeness, but agree with the other posts -- a bit more dressing than necessary. Dial it back a bit and you're in for a real treat.

We loved this salad! So tasty with the Montana Grilled Trout and Chipolte Grilled Sweet Potatoes recipes from AR. The only change I made was using a basket of grape tomatoes instead of chopped tomato. The grape tomatoes are prettier and hold up better for another day - if the salad lasts that long! Thank you, Locally Grown!

Great salad. I followed other suggestions and sauteed the asparagus, as I like the texture better than boiled. There was a bit too much dressing, in fact I drained some before and during serving it, but overall a good salad.

Just used what I had on hand - grape tomatoes cut in half and fresh parsley.  And I only used 1/2 the dressing.

I love the idea of this salad, but I will use less rice vinegar (and less dressing overall) next time - it was just too vinegary for me, and too much sauce. However, my husband loved it just the way it was!

YES YES YES.  This was paired up with a maple-rum glazed salmon main dish, and was absolutely PERFECT.  The flavors together are super bright and full, and the perfect addition to our plates (plus PRETTY!).

Tried this one this afternoon.  It is quite tasty and refreshing on a hot summer afternoon.  I didn't have cilantro or green onions so I left those out but it was still deliscious!

Really great tasty light recipe- made it a couple times now when having guests over and both times it got rave reviews.  I would have given it a 5 but I made a few adjustments.  Sauteed the asparagus in EVOO, salt, and pepper.  I used halved grape tomatoes, and omitted the cilantro.  Made the dressing as described but only poured a small amount on the salad and left the rest on the side for anyone that wanted extra.  Will definitely be making again.

Lovely light salad, I added quartered cucumbers and chopped yellow peppers. We thought it needed some pepper as well.  Will definitely make again!

Made this for a banquet and it was a huge hit!  Took the advice on the dressing and halved it, roasted the asparagus and left out cilantro.  Will make again and again.

I made this using some leftover asparagus. So much better than trying to reheat the asparagus, which usually over cooks it. I was making a salad for two so I just eyeballed the amounts. I left out the sesame oil since I didn't have any, but it was delicious anyway.

Too much liquid!  But taste was a keeper.  Made it for 30 for a dinner party - should adjust the dressing.

I love this recipe and while several complained of too much dressing, I made my dressing ahead to blend flavors overnight then the next day tossed the amount I wanted and saved the remainder to use on other salads.  Everyone loves this vinegarette dressing on other salads as well.

Delicious, especially if you add a few kalamata olives.  I've also made this with haricot verts with equally great results.

Put twice as much asparagus, half as much salt, my tomato was big.  Otherwise just as stated. Everyone loved it!  And so easy to make!

This is awesome! SO delish. I didn't have large tomatoes to slice, so I used the cherry tomatoes from my garden and used goat cheese. This is a keeper!

Made this for a family gathering and everyone wanted the recipe. It is delicious! I followed advice from reviews and sauted the asparagus with garlic and only made 1/2 the dressing (but I didn't half the sesame oil since I like the taste of it). Also, I only use 1/2 the feta cheese and I more than doubled the tomato and used grape tomatoes cut in quarters. This is now a family favorite!
