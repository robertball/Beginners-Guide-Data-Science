This is so good and really easy to make. I omitted the bacon because I didn't have any and added some garlic powder and red chili flakes. I will definitely make again!

Super, but did make a few changes, 1/2 pound of bacon (can't have too much right?), 1 cup chicken broth and I used olive /grapeseed oil blend instead of the butter and only used about 1/2 cup (eyeballed it).
