Excellent with some simple changes.  Breakfast sausage works very well but make sure to drain it well.  Instead of green peppers use 4 oz diced green chilis.  Omit tomato from the top and serve with salsa on the side. Before pouring over the egg mixture press down on the potatoes to compact them. Use a mexican blend or sharp cheddar cheese on top.  Make sure to use nonstick foil or when you remove it most of the cheese you wanted to brown will be on your foil.

I added some diced onion to the bell pepper and meat mixture while browning.  Also, the grocery store I shop at didnt have the Southwestern potatoes, so I added Cayenne and Cumin to the potatoes before putting them in the pan.  Otherwise, I made it as directed with Italian sausage, offered salsa, and my family loved it.  I think it is more a breakfast meal than dinner.  I am anxious to make it with breakfast sausage next time.  Thank you.

I made this for a large group meeting and several people really raved about it.  I thought it was decent.... felt like the potatoes were a little soft and it could've been cooked longer, perhaps.  But so many people asked for the recipe and it was the only dish that was completely gone at the end of the event, so that's gotta speak for something!  I used beef chorizo, since there was a pork allergy in the group.  I can't imagine using Italian sausage for this and don't know why it's even listed as an alternate... that would completely change the flavor!  The chorizo is what makes it, in my opinion!  I'd make it again.

Not a bad casserole.  I didn't feel like topping with tomato and instead used a Pace picante sauce in the eggs themselves.  Worked well, but this took forever to bake.  However, might have been my fault since I added more eggs.  Otherwise, pretty good--my only thought is that perhaps the potatoes could be fried up beforehand to decrease baking time and to make them crispier.  Otherwise, nice casserole.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe! This tastes AWESOME with chorizo! Never did understand why people change recipes. Don't think italian sausage would taste the same, breakfast saugage... maybe. Add some sour cream, alvacado, and/or salsa on the side..MMMMMM!!!! Absolutely delicous! Also, try adding salsa in the egg mixture if you like a lot of flavor. Spice it up with hot salsa and hot chorizo! Yummy!

I used Sweet Italian sausage and cubed up some potatoes (very small) instead of using hash browns.  Also coating the potatoes in a little olive oil, onion powder, and a little garlic salt gives them a better flavor. Will be adding sauted onions in next time.  Overall a decent meal.  Took a lot longer to cook than the recipe said though!

My entire family loved this!!  The only change I made was that I started browning the hash browns a bit.  The chorizo is crucial!  I would not change the meat.

It was much better than I anticipated. Really easy to make. Baked an extra 10 minutes to pass the clean knife test. Did not have cheddar or jack so used a 4 cheese Mexican mix with included both.

Made it for Christmas Eve brunch and everyone loved it. 
Few changes:
Skipped green pepper and used diced green chiles
Used plain hash browns but added saut√©ed onion and "pre-cooked" the hashed browns with the onion in the oven before assembling the casserole, mostly to thaw them and keep the casserole from being too watery 
Used Mexican blend cheese, would maybe use pepper jack next time
Skipped the tomatoes on top and served with homemade salsa
