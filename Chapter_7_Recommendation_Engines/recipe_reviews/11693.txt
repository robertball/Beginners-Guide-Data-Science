Made this last night and it was unbelievable.  I used a 24 oz. can of crushed tomatoes.  Put a whole can of anchovies (drained), capers, and olives in the mini chopper and added that to sauce.  In just 30 minutes, the sauce was done and the house smelled like an italian restaurant.  My husband couldn't believe I made "homemade" sauce that quickly.  This is truly wonderful.

Ay yo! This is a great puttanesca sauce!!! Took a break from the usual Sunday gravy and made this...loved it! I made a whole pound of macaroni...so I doubled the recipe. I followed it pretty close except I used two 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes and and 8oz can of tomato sauce instead of using the sieve, and I used half kalamotta and half greek olives. Those of you who think there is too much olive oil...that's what puttanesca is supposed to be like. It is not supposed to be tomatoey and sweet like marinara. Puttanesca should be bitter and spicy...and that's just what this is. Thanks for an incredible recipe! This one goes into my rotation. And oh yeah, and thanks for the gut...a pound I ate in two days!

I made this recipe for a dinner party for 9 people.  All of them raved about the sauce.

I did not push the tomatoes through a sieve, but left them chopped coarse.  Added a few chopped sundried tomatoes, which helped to thicken the sauce a  bit.  Made a nice addition, but the sauce would have been fine without them.

I also scaled back the olive oil a bit.  

Overall, a keeper of a recipe.  I can't wait to serve it again!

This recipe has become one of my favorite dishes to serve for any occasion.  I usually can't stand olives or anchovies, but love them in this.  I chop the tomatoes in the food processer rather than pushing them through a seive, and substitute anchovy paste for filets.  The ratio of ingredients is pretty flexible, but I wouldn't recommend leaving any ingredients out completely...I made it without the anchovy for a vegetarian friend and the flavor was completely different (good, but nothing like the original).  Also, keep in mind that the flavors are strong and will be overpowering if you put too much on your pasta (use half as much as you would if it were a marinara sauce).  This may be the reason that so many reviews say that the sauce is too salty or the olive/caper taste is too strong.

Outstanding!  I saw this being made on a cooking show and had to make it since my husband and I LOVE olives, anchovies, and capers.  True, the sauce is a bit salty because of these ingredients, but a little sauce goes a long way in flavor!  **** UPDATE 3/14/08 ***** I made this with sea bass last night and it was delicious.  On foilm I laid down some lemon slices, topped with the fish, then the puttanesca sauce.  Fold the foil up to make a pouch and bake at 400 degrees for 18 minutes.  The puttanesca sauce compliments the fish.  Excellent recipe!

This was delicious!  I cut back just a smidge on the oil, used a ~15oz can of petite diced tomatoes (we like it chunky!) instead of fresh, added an extra clove of garlic, and used regular black olives - presliced from a can since that's what I had on hand.  Otherwise all ingredients and amounts were left as written.  I did add the chopped anchovies to the oil while I sauteed the garlic so they basically "melted" away and just left the flavor.  This was so good, I couldn't stop eating it!  Even my husband commented on how good it was!  (I didn't tell him it had anchovies until after he raved about it. :)  I'm usually very sensitive to saltiness but this was fine - not too salty at all.  I did rinse the anchovies before using them, so maybe that did it.  This will definitely be a regular in our house - thanks so much!

This is as good as it gets, frankly.

This is a WONDERFUL pasta dish to have in the weekly rotation. 

Only made two adjustments: reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup rather than 1/2 cup (but that's just a personal preference) and to make things easier I simply used two cups of canned Imported Italian Crushed Tomatoes.

Oh, and I STRONGLY SUGGEST using a fetucini pasta as it is the perfect size and consistency for absorbing and mopping up this yummy sauce.

I would imagine that this would make an excellent dipping sauce with crostini as well as a nice sauce to pour over fish or chicken.

Don't hesitate to make this one!!!!

This recipe allows you to enjoy a puttanesca that is finer than any we've enjoyed at many top Italian restaurants.  Try it with a good Zinfandel for optimum enjoyment.  For those that are calorie conscience feel free to cut back on the olive oil.  We used 1/8 cup and will use less next time around.  We'll enjoy this dish again and again.

This recipe is very flavorful, quick, easy cleanup, and uses ingredients that I keep onhand.  For those pitting Greek olives, try pitted Kalamata Olives.  I substituted anchovy paste for anchovies - just because I keep the paste onhand, but not anchovies.  We'll enjoy this dish again and again.

Excellent sauce and quite quick and easy.  I used half pitted black olives and half pimento stuffed green ones and added 1/2 cup white wine. 
Great!

This is a wonderful puttanesca! It tastes just like the one my grandma made when I was a child. I wouldn't change a thing and highly recommend!

I made this for the first time yesterday and the sauce got raves.  I used the suggestion of the person who sauteed the anchovies with the garlic to kind of melt the anchovies, as my husband hates the taste of fish, and even he loved the sauce.  Other than that I didn't change a thing. I put the sauce on spaghetti, but I really think it would be even better on large flat noodles pappardele, which I'm going to try next time.

The whole family ate this up! I did eyeball the EVOO (as per reviews stating original recipe was too oily) for somewhere between 1/2 and 1/4 C, as well as putting the 1/2 capers, olives and anchovies in processor for a moment. I added 1/2 capers whole for personal preference :) and probably doubled the amount of capers as well, again personal preference. (love 'em) I did not have fresh tomatoes on hand so used diced caned, drained. Other than that followed recipe, will definitely make again, and again! Thank you Poochie!

I was looking for an easy but different pasta sauce for weeknight meals.  This one was perfect!  It's really spicy, sharp, and idk...complex.  I used canned crushed tomatoes (decent quality).  I used the whole can, but next time may actually measure out 2 cups as it was just a hair too much.  I used canned, sliced black olives.  I added an extra clove of garlic.  I used anchovy paste because it will keep and this is the *only* thing I'll use it for, and I got capers off of the olive bar at the grocery (nearly same price as the bottled stuff and waayyyy better).

I cut back just a hair on the olive oil too, probably used 1/3 cup (good quality).  The only tip I'd offer is, I whisked the sauce to emulsify the oil and tomato sauce.  It didn't take long,

This was excellent, in fact, much better than my husband and I expected. I used the whole can of anchovies and served it over linguini...perfect!! I doubled the recipe but did skim oil off the top before serving. I will not double olive oil next time. I am Italian and have never had this dish before. I usually drown my pasta with sauce, but not this dish. It is much better to "just top it" with the sauce. Excellent!!!

Loved this - really good and spicy, and not hard!  I used Pom chopped tomatoes and didn't bother sieving them, just tossed them in, sauce and all; worked out fine.  Don't be scared of the olive oil.  Makes the finished sauce nice and lush.  Next time, I might try adding the whole can of anchovies, so it doesn't go to waste, but all in all - we'll definitely make this again, thanks so much!

My parents and I loved this dish.  My boyfriend thought it had a strange taste.  If you like anchovies and greek olives then this dish is for you.  But if those things taste strange to you, then you probably won't like it to much.

Can't believe how much of this Mr P managed to gobble down in one sitting...good job it's fairly healthy! Made recipe more or less as is, just upped the amount of capers, olives & anchovy as per personal taste. This is definitely one for the rotation - very quick & simple and very, very tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

Love it! I added chicken by browning the outsides initially then adding it to the sauce and letting it all cook together. Then I only use about half the pasta.

I made this with capellini. It had great flavor, but it was a touch too oily for me; next time, I'll reduce it to 1/3 cup. The puttanesca I used to get at my favorite Italian restaurant, in New Jersey, used kalamata, green, and black olives, so I made it that way, with extra olives. A definite keeper!

I'm not an olive, caper, or anchovy lover, but I love this sauce.  I also love how quick and easy it is to make.  BUT I like it made my way.  I also cut up a half an onion and fry that up, then mince twice the garlic called for and fry that up.  I give a rough chop to the anchovies and olives (kalamata, black, and green) and throw everything in the blender and blend until it is fairly smooth, only slightly chunky.  You can only see real small pieces of olive.  I also cut the olive oil to 1/3 c. and serve it with fettuccini.  The sauce does get thicker in the fridge and then I'll thin it with more olive oil. This is a very flavorful sauce that I'm sure will get many raves!

I love puttanesca and this was terrific.  Like another reviewer, I also add an extra dash of crushed red pepper because I like it hot.

This was very good, I used anchovy paste instead of the fillets and omitted the olives at my husbands request. Next time I will add some chicken because my hubby couldn't believe there was no meat in the dish.

The first time I made this I forgot the tomato paste and my family LOVED it. The next time I added the tomato paste and they didn't like it quite as much. The tomato paste gives it a slightly sweet, marinera-like flavor so now I leave it out. I also don't bother with the sieve--I just blend 4 or 5 tomatoes and use that. It's a regular in our house now. Thanks for sharing this.

This recipe is outstanding!!!  I made 2 changes.....used 2  14 oz cans of crushed tomatoes and only 1/4 cup of olive oil.  The rest of the ingredients I measured exactly.  I put the olives, capers and anchovies in the mini chopper and pulsed a few times so the chunks wouldn't be too big.  It was fabulous!!!  My husband raved.  DEFINITE KEEPER!

What a fantastic, simple recipe.  I added the anchovies (a 2oz can) with the garlic and dissolved it into the oil.  A 15oz can diced tomatoes works just fine.  In 30 min I had it ready and the kitchen cleaned up!  Deliciously salty.  Tastes more complicated than it is.  I've already made it many times!  This is a keeper for sure.

This is just proper.  Have been making putanesca for years using the same ingredients but this recipe has put quantities into perspective eg I was wrong in not using so many olives.  As with every past dish, remove pasta 2-3 minutes before desired doneness and let it boil into the sauce pan to absorb the sauce.

I didn't like it AT ALL and I am Italian and usually love capers, olives, and all things briny. Not this. Calls for WAY TOO MUCH EVOO, use half like 1/4 cup. Also the sauce recipe will leave you with leftovers, so make extra pasta. Tasted fishy :(

I followed previous recommendations and used a can of crushed tomatoes, and only half the olive oil.  It was to die for!  One of the best recipes I've ever run across.

This is delicious! I had to make a few alterations, though. I used diced canned tomatoes, and ketchup (don't laugh) for the tomato paste, omitted the anchovy filets (didn't have any on hand), and had to use black olives (all I had). I also added more garlic and red pepper flakes (personal pref). Very good, easy, and quick. I'll be making this again, thanks Pooche.

Did not follow recipe exactly, but used all ingredients (different proportions). Did not push chopped tomatoes through a sieve, but added them near the end, just to warm through. Really tasty and will make again! It made for a quick, delicious weekday meal!

Loved it!  Doubled the recipe so that we could have left overs the next day.  Used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes. Used the entire can of anchovies because I love the taste and used 3/4 cup olive oil instead of 1 cup.  Perfection!  Will definitely make again.  :-)

Excellent.  I used a little bit more anchovy fillet, garlic, and olives.  Plus a bit of the olive juice.  I also substituted canned chopped tomatoes with great results and a little less work.

This is a really good Puttanesca. I did cut back the olive oil as I made enough for 12 people to use up the tomatoes I had. I also added some lemon juice, as I felt it needed a little acid. This is one of my husbands favorite sauces, thanks for sharing.

This is the classic way to make Puttanesca sauce.  I've always made it without the anchovy fillets and think I still prefer it that way!

With no one else a lover of anchovies, olives and capers, I finally put my foot down, claiming that our meal tonight is whatever you can make yourself. I suppose that's a common scenario for home cooks, letting family whims make dinner choices most of the time. I was very pleased with the result of this puttanesca. I love saying that! It was surprisingly quick to make. I may have used a little less oil after reading that many found the amount high. This sauce clung beautifully and gave great colour to the linguine. The anchovies are not the stand out flavour. They do however, comprise a portion of the overall taste. FYO 1/2 tsp = 1 fillet. Maybe just try 1/2 - 3/4 tsp. to see how this ingredient adds to the sauce. As does fish sauce enhance the flavour of many Asian dishes, anchovy does here. I don't know many who would take a swig of the vile fish sauce on it's own, neither do I know many who would pop an anchovy. As with many simple recipes like this one,  buy the best ingredients that won't break your budget and you are on your way to a delightful meal. Thanks so much Pooche. Fabulous recipe.

I doubled the garlic, tomatoes, anchovies, and pasta.  I used about 30 Kalmatta olives.  I DECREASED the olive oil to about 3 TBSP, the tomato paste to 1.5 TBSP, and the capers to 2 TBSP.  Otherwise, the sauce would've been too heavy with all that tomato paste, and Puttanesca is typically a very light sauce.  My first time eating this dish it was made by someone from Italy, so I'm going to say it's safe to say the lighter way is authentic.

Hello, I'm an Italian who loves this site! As an Italian big fan of cooking I would like to remember a very important thing about pasta in general: make sure that when you drain pasta the sauce is already done, because if you make pasta and, after it, you make the sause, then at the end pasta will be overcooked (yes, also if out of water) and it will be sticky and, as we say, will "seem like glue"!

This recipe is fabulous! In fact, I had it 2 nights in a row it was so good, and I rarely ever eat the same thing 2 days in a row. I did some things that decreased prep time and made a few slight changes. First while the oil was heating up, I put grape tomatoes that I had halved in a chopper and pulsed until almost like a sauce. Sautéed the garlic and red pepper flakes in the oil for 1 minute. Then added the tomatoes and cooked for 2 minutes. While that was cooking, I put the pitted Kalamata olives and capers in chopper and pulsed until it was finely chopped. Then I added 1/4 cup of white wine (Pinot Grigio) to the tomatoes and garlic and I let it reduce. Then added in the anchovy paste, tomato paste, olives and capers and let simmer on low for 10 minutes while I was cooking the pasta. I cooked the pasta for 1 minute less than the package directions. Drained the pasta and added to the sauce to absorb the sauce for 1 minute. Then served. The wine is not necessary but adds another layer of flavor.

Great stuff.  I always use crushed or canned tomatoes and I usually use all the anchovies from a can because that's how I like it.   The portions of ingredients are flexible, but definitively don't skip on any of them(especially the anchovies!) They might sound weird, but everything coming together is what makes this sauce great.

I loved this! I poured myself a glass of wine and felt like I was dining at a fancy Italian restaraunt. I didn't have anchovy fillets so I used anchovy paste (a generous squirt from a tube), cut back on the oil, and added some fresh chopped parsley. Delicious!

Have seen this demo'd on TV and always wanted to try it.  Well, what kept me.  So different and has the WOW factor.  Everyone loved it.  Used anchovy paste, canned chopped tomatoes and green olives.  Quite a versatile dish and fun to serve because of the raves.

Ohmygod... My boyfriend loved it... He is half Italian, and went to culinary school... So he cooks gourmet all the time... he is amazed that I did this myself... He added 8 anchovies instead of 4, and 1/2 teaspoon more red flakes... But he says, that is just his preference.... He loves calamata olives, they eat these as appetizers.... So, this dish we all truly enjoyed... I will definitely make this, at least once a month...

I was very hesitant about this because of the anchovies, which i will not eat. But I was looking for a no meat recipe for lent and this sounded interesting. Well, I was pleasantly surprised...it was delicious. I did use anchovy paste based on other reviews and used extra garlic, capers and some fresh basil. I also agree the oil is too much. I doubled the recipe and used 3/4 c of oil, which I think the 1/2 c in the recipe is enough for 16 oz of pasta. This is definately a keeper!

I also added sun dried tomatoes.  I think I'll use plain olives next time as I thought this tasted a little too much like brine.  Not a hit at all with the kids but the adults enjoyed it.

The sauce had entirely too much olive oil. I had to add more tomatoes to it so that the sauce didn't have an oil slick. The basics for the sauce were good but it lacked true flavor of the puttanesca sauce. Next time I'll add onion to it and Italian seasoning. I used the San Marzano tomatoes and I would keep that and also add more paste to it. I didn't put the tomatoes through a sieve - I crushed them instead. The anchovies and garlic should be sauted in the olive oil first and then add the tomotoes and other ingreadients.

This is one of the simplest and most flavorful versions of a Puttanesca sauce that I've used; the proportions are just right. I did decrease the oil, however, and I used anchovy paste instead of the 2 anchovies that my scaled-down recipe would have used (I made two portions rather than four), but those were the only changes I made.

I hesitated trying this because my husband doesn't like anchovies. However, when I made it without telling him the ingredients he loved it. It is now one of out favorite Italian sauces.

This recipe is wonderful & full of great flavour.  I used anchovie paste & added balsamic vinegar & brown sugar to taste.  Also put some parmesan cheese in it as well as on top.  Terrific!!

Delicious and simple.  I loved the way the sieved tomatoes infused the olive oil with their flavor.  I left out the anchovies to make it vegetarian and it did not suffer at all!

Such a simple, delicious dish! I was literally racking my brain about what I could make for dinner at 6pm tonight.  This dish was done and on the table within 40 minutes.  I used the entire 2oz can (drained) of anchovies which I chopped in a mini food processor with the greek olives (I got a Greek olive medley at Costco which had just been sitting in my fridge).  I didn't have any capers, so unfortunately I had to skip those, but next time I'll definitely add them.  I also used maybe 1/8 cup of olive oil for personal preference.  Really tasty, slightly salty and slightly spicy - all over a dish I'll make again. Thank you :)

absolutely delish! I added some fresh chopped parsley, omitted the tomato paste, and didn't rinse the canned anchovy filets (couldn't find fresh, so bought a tin of it), added some anchovie paste, and didn't chop the olives.  Also, I tossed AND fried the pasta in the saucepan.  I do regret not chopping the olives, tho; they've such a strong flavor, chopping them up would've spread the pungent flavor throughout every bite, rather than tasting all of that wonderful flavor in every other bit, or so. Absolutely fab though.

Worth trying again. I was in a hurry and didn't read the other reviews, big mistake. Two tablespoons of olive oil is plenty unless you are looking for a recipe for Olive Oil Stew.

This pungent, flavorful sauce isn't for the faint-hearted! Put only a small amount on your pasta first to see how much flavor you can stand, and add sauce if you want more punch. It's salty, garlicky, and the punch added by the capers & olives is incredible. Even if you hate anchovies you must include them - you can't taste them by themselves, but they add an important background flavor that's too good to me missed.

I cut olive oil to 1/4 cup, may cut further next time. I used 5 HUGE cloves of home-grown hard-neck garlic (yum!) and 20 Kalamata olives. Instead of fresh tomatoes I used a 28 oz can of Italian Plum tomatoes, diced. And I used a generous heaping tsp of red pepper flakes which gave it a nice amount of heat.  This made a saucepan full of sauce that I can use for several more meals. 

I don't understand the call for 8 oz of pasta... for a 4 person recipe?? Someone is a cheapy-pants!! Or there is an error in these instructions.

Delicious! I made a few small changes to make the dish more to my liking: substituted the tomatoes with a large can of crushed tomatoes, omitted the anchovies and instead added about 1 lb. of shrimp for some protein, took the olive oil down to 1/4 cup (which was plenty), added 1/2 tsp. each of salt, dried oregano, and garlic powder.  Simply delicious dish!

Absolutely wonderful. My grandmother made a simpler version of this when we were growing up and this is the first recipe I've tried that came close to the flavor of hers. DO NOT let the anchovies and number of bold flavors intimidate you. You won't even know the anchovies are in there and as long as you like olives, capers, etc. you will enjoy this. It's amazing how the flavors mellow out and just work together.

Fantastic!  It's great to be able to make such a flavorful sauce without having to stand around a stove all day!  I did not think it was salty as some other reviewers have said.  I loved the taste that resulted from the anchovies, capers and olives!  Will be making this again and again!

used a little less than 1/3 cup EVOO, that was plenty. Made with 1 can stewed tomatoes and 1 cup grape tomatoes. Would be good as a dipping sauce using less liquid.

Excellent!  My husband and I loved this dish and only wished it had a bit more anchovy.  Other than that: Magnifique!  I think I may also try adding some mini meatballs next time, but otherwise an excellent vegetarian dish.  Goes well with Caesar salad.

Cannot go wrong with this recipe. For a variation try it with chopped caper berries (grape size) and blossoms.

Love this recipe. I made some slight variations since these were the ingredients in my pantry:  a can of diced tomatoes (drained) and Spanish olives (with pimiento) and it still turned out wonderful.  The bf also was not a fan of anchovies so I used the food processor and blended the anchovies with half of the capers and olives - making a yummy paste. No one would notice ;) No salt needed and depending on your taste buds, kick the red pepper flakes a notch. Winner!

My wife asked me to make this last night, and I was all for it, as this looked like a southern Italian dish, being spicy, rich and with anchovies :)  Rinsing the anchovies helps lighten the saltiness considerably, so I made sure not skip that step, especially cos  I used a whole jar of imported anchovies.  I also used whole tomatoes, broken up, to make it more hearty.  This was one of the best sauces I've ever had! (the best is my granma's of course).

Very Good!  Wish I had followed the others advice and cut the oil in half though.  Nice dish.  ****UPDATE:  This dish was even better the next day because all the sauce and oil had soaked into the noodles.  I'll definitely make it a day ahead from now on!

I made this recipe for dinner one night, mostly for my mom, and we loved it! It was nice and salty from the olives and anchovies but not too much. My 12 year old sister didn't like it very much but the rest of us finished our plates and hers.

Had good flavor but WAY WAY WAY too much oil.  I debated on using the whole amount but took into account another person's review who said it was the traditional dish.  Most of us couldn't even eat it.  I wasted almost the whole dish.  Quite a disappointment & don't think I'd make it again...if I did I would use half if not less of the oil.

I made this for my husband (I hate olives), as he loves puttanesca. He's very particular about this dish, and he said he wouldn't change a thing! I rinsed the capers and olives so it wouldn't be too salty, and used just 1/4 c high quality olive oil, with a drained 15 oz can of crushed tomatoes. Thanks for saving us $12-15 every time he gets a craving! :-)

Excellent!  I used green and black olives since I had them on hand.  I also used less olive oil and would decrease it more next time.  I used one 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes instead of fresh.  I used my magic bullet blender and processed the tomatoes.  I also chopped the anchovies in it...it eliminated the random bones you get when you cut anchovies.  I loved the recipe especially since it is so adaptable.

This is SO good!  I tossed the anchovies in with the garlic and they broke down quickly!  Also, I was rushed for time, so I added a can of diced tomatoes, which worked just fine.  IMHO, it could use just a touch more red pepper flakes.  Don't worry about the amount of olive oil... it's just fine, especially if you let the whole platter sit for a few minutes after adding the sauce to the pasta.  This is excellent with a nice red wine!  Enjoy!

This is Puttanesca how its meant to be made.  It's very quick and easy.  There are a few shortcuts that I take to eliminate all the prep work for super simple weeknight meals.  First, I use anchovy paste.  I prefer the tomatoes to be chunky so buy diced canned tomatoes and don't bother with the sieve.  Sometimes I even buy the olives that are already chopped in the olive bar of my grocery store.  No matter what, good quality olives are key to this recipe.  I've served the recipe with pasta as suggested and I've also served just the sauce over chicken many times.  Either way, it's delicious.

I took other reviewer's advice and used less oil (1/4 cup and probably could have used a little less), and a little less olives.  Remember - you can always add more if you want!

If this is the main dish however, I think this recipe only serves 2.  But maybe that's because it really is so delicious! I totally agree with others - this came out better than puttanesca sauces I've had in restaurants!

This recipe is great! My husband isn't a big anchovie fan so nstead of adding in the anchovies later, I followed the suggestion of adding them while infusing the oil and garlic and it worked wonderfully.  I will add more olives next time, but that is for personal preferance not because it needs the added flavor.

This recipe comes pretty close to the pasta we use to eat in Sicily. I use anchovie paste instead of the fillets and I also omit the tomato paste for a more authentic taste. Thanks for a great recipe.

Yum! A huge hit with the family. I added about 10 oz. sauteed ground turkey because I'm a meat-lover, half a small onion, and a tbsp+ each of basil and oregano. I also substituted about a tbsp anchovy paste for the anchovies. It was a beautiful, impressive dish, but next time I'll chop the olives finely instead of coarsely. My little brother didn't like the bitter taste the big chunks gave off.

Really flavorful.  Really easy.  For a slighltly more pungent flavor, saute the garlic, olives, and anchovies in the oil before adding the tomatoes.  I used canned diced tomatoes and it was great.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe.  I made a few changes to this...I was using another recipes similar to this one, but the finished product was yummy.   I did not use as much olive oil as the recipe called for and I used a whole (small) jar of capers.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved it, but my boyfriend thought the olive flavor was a bit much.  I'll make it again, but I think I'll use less olives next time.  I used to eat this as a child, but it was made with artichoke hearts in it.  I might give that a try for a different texture.  It's a flavorful dish that you have to be in the right mood for...but it's mmm mmm good.

This recipe has to be one of my all time favourites. I add one red onion and some fresh basil. Packed with taste and so easy to make. Try using pimento stuffed green olives - which don't need to be depitted.

Great sauce!!  Easy to make, spectacular results, but kind of "foreign" for the kids.  It is salty, thanks to the anchovies and olives, but SO GOOD!!

I used to make this when I was newly married.  It seemed so complicated and time consuming.  This morning, I whipped up a batch before breakfast.  Experience is a great teacher!
I added some chopped  bell pepper and used cayenne instead of pepper flakes.  Drain the olives, anchovies, and capers to remove some of the salt but do not rinse or you will lose the flavor.
This is really supposed to be more like a flavored olive oil dressing than a sauce per se, so don't be a slave to the recipe and measurements.  It will come out just fine.  Having said that, put it on anything, salads, toasted french bread, anything you like.  Don't be limited to pasta.   Hot or cold makes no difference.  Delicious and good for you.  This recipe made about 2/3 quart for me.

Quick, easy, and full of flavor! And it just so happens it used things I commonly have in my pantry, minus the anchovies which I left out completely. You can easily adjust this to suit your tastes. I cut back on the oil and used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and didn't bother draining them. I topped it with a little shredded Parmesan cheese before serving. Perfect with warm garlic bread and a glass of wine!

I make this regularly at my house, but I also add chicken broth - then reduce the sauce...and swirl in butter at the last minute before tossing with pasta.  Been making this for years.

This is a new regular in our house! Easy, colorful and full of flavor. I took the advice of others and only used 1/4 cup olive oil. I did not want to try and push my tomatoes through a sieve, so I did chop them into a sieve and kind of raked the seeds and juice down through the sieve. Next time I will just cut them, squeeze out the seeds and cook. Try this yummy, rustic dish! Thanks for sharing Pooche!

Absolutely delicious!  My family loved it - made it twice in one week.  I used two 15 oz cans of petite diced tomatoes, an 8 oz can tomato sauce, green olives stuffed with pimento, black olives, and kalamata olives.  Oh, and I use anchovy paste rather than fillets because it's easier.

Did a little substitution.  Angel Hair pasta cooked in chicken broth, no anchovies, sun dried tomatoes in olive oil, canned diced tomatoes instead of paste and a combo of green and greek olives.  Was excellent!!!

This was delicious.  I was not sure about the anchovies and if it was going to be too strong of a taste, but it wasn't.  Other than using a can of crushed tomatoes instead, I made this exactly as described.  Will definitely make this again, was a hit!!

This recipe was great! I used black olives and Hunts whole peeled tomatoes instead. I cut the tomatoes while they were cooking into bite size chunks and I added oregano, basil, and a little bit of sugar at the end. Cheap, easy, and delicious!!

This was great.  I cut the oil a bit, didn't measure everything just eyeballed it.  Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I added frozen artichoke hearts to add a vegetable.  It worked well!

I have made this recipe about 10 times and continue to tweak it to my liking. I use shrimp instead of anchovies since I can't stand those furry little fish. I also sub in calamata  olives and use fresh tomatoes rather than what is suggested. It just keeps getting better.

Very nice pasta sauce.  I waited to try this when bf was out of the house since he's not a fan of capers or olives.  I used manzanilla olives stuffed with pimentos since I don't have greek olives, and I left out the anchovies since I don't have any.  I added orange bell pepper just to have more veggies--something I'm always striving for.  This is really good!  I love the tomato flavor and the crispness of the olives and capers--I'd actually probably add more olives and capers next time, I liked it so much!  A very hearty meal for lunch, and you don't need much else with it--just a slice of crusty bread to mop it all up.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pasta dish has become a standby in our house.  I usually have all the ingredients on hand, and it's so quick and easy.  The only changes I've made are to cut back on the olive oil, and on occasion use canned tomatoes, or just put the fresh in the food processor.  Add some chicken or shrimp and we are good to go!

This was a smiple recipe to make. I make it more healthy by using organic whole wheat pasta. I also cut my tomatoes then put them in my blender just until coursely cut up. Next time I will try sprinkling feta cheese on top before serving.

OH so good!!  Next time I think I'll cut the olive oil down to 1/3 like some others suggested.  I just used kalamata olives as I didn't have an assortment.  I also used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of putting fresh ones thru a sieve.  My house smelled WONDERFUL!  Why had I never made this before??  I could eat this every night!

Just realized I never reviewed this... Made it for a quick dinner and my BF and I fought for seconds. I didn't use anchovies and I didn't have capers; I also used black olives instead of Greek. Served it over WW pasta. Fantastico!

This has become one of our favourite red sauces. It is loaded with flavour, and you need no meat to accompany this at all - the sauce is totally satisfying!  Like other people, I do not add the full amount of oil, but maybe about half. I add abit more of certain ingredients, as we like lots of flavour in our sauce. I serve this over fat thick noodles, topped with some Parmesan. Tastes ever better the next day. Can't believe it took me so long to discover this amazing dish!

Wow, I'm really sad to say that this just didn't work for us. It was very, very oily and the flavor of the olives was too strong. My kids wouldn't touch it and my husband and I were not pleased with it either.

I made this for lunch and my boyfriend could not stop complimenting this dish! I thought it was pretty good, but he loved it and told me to give it a 5/5. The only thing I changed was to reduce the olives because we do not care for it. I served this with some crusty bread and the garlic chicken recipe from this site and it was a lovely lunch. Ty

The dish was very good - I put a little less than 1/4 C oil in it and it turned out fine. My only gripe is that it is just too salty. Next time I think I'd decrease the olives and maybe the capers as well.

Delicious! I didn't sieve the tomatoes as I too (like many reviewers enjoy a "chunky" sauce) and I added some fresh squeezed lemon, approx 2tsp. It was lovely.  BTW -- Try adding some fresh fish (ie Mahi) to the sauce itself and serve over pasta. Delish!

I have never had puttanesca sauce, but have heard from friends how wonderful it is, so decided to try making it. I did not use whole anchovies, rather used anchovy paste. I did not know the correct measurement (no suggestions on packaging) as to what would equal 1 anchovy. I must have added too much, as the sauce had a touch too much anchovy taste. I will definitely try gain and tone down the anchovies a bit. Served this sauce as well as arabbiatta sauce with a wonderful Caesar salad and garlic bread. Very unique.

Very good sauce.  It was a bit difficult getting the tomato through the sieve, so next time I'll probably use tomato puree.

Great recipe, but quite small. As a main course for 4 I nearly doubled all the ingredients. I use wholegrain pasta which works really well with this sauce. This is so tasty, it has become a real favourite of mine.

It was delicious, even though I messed up on the recipe (I added the red pepper flakes TWICE because I got a phone call while cooking). Needless to say, mine was extra spicy, but not unbearable. I set aside some of the sauce before I added the pepper flakes in for my son (15 months old), and he loved it, too! He loves olives though, so he was totally into this. My husband loved it, even though he hates olives. I'll definitely make this regularly- with the correct amount of red pepper flakes :)

Very good!! I make this weekly- my husband and I love it.  I use a little bit less olive oil and 2 cans diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes and use a can of tomato paste. I leave out the anchovies because I couldn't taste them when they were in there.

OMG!!! This is so good. I did not have anchovies on hand. Next time I will make it with them.  However, this was wonderful. I added a little red wine and used canned crushed tomatoes instead of fresh.  Thank you so much.  I will be adding this to my staple recipes.

I was so worried about making this as I do NOT like anchovies but it was better than I could have hoped for - I LOVE it. I did follow some of the suggestions 1/3 cup olive oil, kalamata olives, 2 cloves garlic (could have used 3 though), 15oz can of diced petite tomatoes drained and rinsed everything (probably could have skipped this too). The only modification I added was to add some quartered artichoke hearts and next time I will also add some sun dried tomatoes. My husband didn't love it he thought there were too many flavors but he liked it enough to have again. I may make it for him without the anchovies and see what he thinks - I think the smell caught him off guard as I didn't tell him the ingredients until later. Didn't feed this to my 3yr old because of the spicy peppers but I think without that he would gobble this up too.

My sister made this for me on a visit. This has to be the best ever Pasta dish I ever had. I fried 1-1/2 LBS of sweet sausage, drained and added it, I used ziti instead of Spaghetti. I wanted to test it for a Bring along dish for a party and it worked great. I made the sauce, sausage and pasta in the morning. then about 1/2 hour before leaving, I heated everything separately then put all together. The oil kept everything from getting fry and it worked great.

My husband and I really enjoyed this, however, it is not kid friendly. They ended with pb&j's. I did sub tuna for the anchovy and used green and black olives in place of the Greek ones. We liked this a lot. An explosion of flavor with each bite. I highly recommend this recipe for adult palates.

A delicious recipe, but too bitter for me.  I followed the advice of some and rinsed the anchovies and capers to reduce the salt and I'm very glad I did.  When I make this again, I think I'll either leave out or try sweeter olives to make it less bitter, and add 2 more anchovy filets - I could barely taste them.  Thanks for a fantastic, fun-to-make recipe!

P.S. The amount of olive oil is perfect!

Wonderful!!! No substitutions, modifications or "spicing up" needed. Make this the way the recipe tells you to and you will not regret it. Everyone I made it for absolutely loved it! I made it after a friend made it. SO easy to make but tastes like a 5star chef made it. This will be my secret recipe when I need to impress (shh!).

WOW!  This was so easy to make and most of the ingredients were already on hand.  Yum!  The sauce was a bit thick for me so I added some white wine which was perfect.  I used canned diced tomatoes (drained) and maybe should have left in some of the liquid.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is fantastic!  I only used 1/4 cup olive oil, added 5 cloves of garlic, two cans of kitchen ready crushed tomatoes, the whole can of anchovies, pre-sliced black olives,  and green olives.  It's the perfect recipe to 'make your own'!  My friends raved about it, and my boyfriend is thrilled when I tell him it's for dinner!  Easy to make, impressive to serve!

Beautiful. Adding the sundried tomatoes is a great idea or you might try simmering the tomatoes until the juice is reduced to about half. I would suggest using good oil cured kalamata olives (yes you have to pit them. Use the best brand of oil packed anchovies you can find and use the anchovy oolive oil for extra anchovy flavor.

This is good I have been making puttanesca forever b/c I love it but never before with greek olives.  I really liked the flavor but I have to be honest, it's not worth having to pit them.  A combo of sliced green and black is what I use to do and I'll go back to it.  DON'T skip the anchovies, it adds depth of flavor and you really need to use it.  I doubled this and doubled the red pepper flakes (I like pain), and served over angel hair.  Fantastico!

I like how all the ingredients in this sauce meld together to create that beautiful, salty, rich flavor. Even the anchovies blend right in and disappear. I also like that you can use fresh tomatoes to make this. However, I'm lazy and I don't mind seeds in my sauce, so instead of pushing the tomatoes through a sieve I just roughly chopped them in the blender and poured them in the pot. I let them boil while I was preparing the other ingredients, and by the time I was done they had thickened up into a nice tomato-y sauce. I accidentally bought a jumbo jar of un-pitted olives and I've been grumbling as I pit them ever since, so I'd recommend buying pitted olives if you can find them! One gripe with the recipe: I think it makes more like 2 servings.

Fabulous sauce!!! It was amazing, I even got our picky friends to eat it and want more! I added only 3 TBSP of oil (for 6 servings) and used petit diced tomatoes. I also used a whole can of tomato paste, but I wanted the sauce to be thick because I put it on pizza crust. One of the best pizzas I've had! Just top with mozzarella (smoked is the best) and you're good to go!! I will def be making this again!

This was quite good! My husband said it had "too many olives". The 1/2 cup of oil sounds like a lot, and intially will look like too much, but, once you toss the pasta with the sauce, it helps the sauce stick to the pasta. I also added onions to the garlic and sauteed the anchovies in the oil so they were sure to dissolve. I also doubled the red pepper flakes to make it a little spicier. I used a lg. can of crushed tomatoes and a whole sm. can of tomato paste. Also, to add protein, I marinated 3 chicken breats (in a store-bought garlic lemon marinade) and grilled them and sliced them, then, tossed w/ the pasta and sauce. As long as you remember to buy the pre-pitted olives, this a fast and easy, however, elegant meal. Thanks!

Fantastic!  Very much like the puttanesca I had in Napoli.  Like other reviewers, I reduced the oil to 2 tblsp., and I added a bit of white wine to make the sauce thinner.  Well named "puttana" (); a very lusty sauce.  Delizioso!

This is the best pasta sauce I have ever made.  I used anchovy paste because I had it on hand.  I also used canned crushed tomatoes, which worked well.  In addition, I threw in some extra olives, just because I love them so much, and I cut them in half to retain the wonderful texture.

Excellent recipe. Husband loves olives so we both loved it. Substituted 1/2 green olives w/kalamata and no anchovies. We're carnivores but with cheesy garlic bread this didn't need meat. Maybe next time will cut the sour with something sweet like italian sausage or fish or fresh mozzarella and tomato salad. AND I was amazed how fast this was. Great recipe. Thanks

I substituted sweet italian sausage for the anchovies and it was delicious.  The hardest, most time consuming part was pitting and chopping the greek olives.

Very good recipe. I used only 1/3 cup evoo, used diced tomatoes I didn't sieve, used all anchovies, & garnished with marinated artichoke hearts. Came out oh so delish. Easy recipe to impress guests. Served with Italian style boneless chicken breast. I love it when a plan comes together!!! Try it...you'll like it!

This was so simple and yummy. Just used a can of diced tomatoes, might use crushed next time. Used anchovie paste instead. The spice was just right for hubby, guests and I, but a bit much for the 1&3 year olds.

NOT TOO SALTY ! Rinse the olives and the capers NOT the anchovies. Put these items and the tomato paste and pepper flakes into the oil before the chopped tomatoes. Brings it up by another 3 points ! ! !

Delicious. Only change I made was I substituted sliced black olives instead of the kalamata Greek olives (my personal preference). Other than that i followed the recipe exactly and my whole family loved it. I've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. This one is definitely a keeper. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! But 
I reduced the olive oil by around half and added lots more red pepper flakes (I couldn't taste any spice whatsoever with a half teaspoon!), reduced olives (to my taste), and added loads more garlic.
I'll definitely be making this many more times!

Absolutely wonderful! I kinda doubled it.. Here's what I did.. 3/4 C EVOO, 5 Cloves of garlic, 1 28oz can of chopped tomatoes, 3t of anchovy paste, 3 T of tomatoe paste, small jar of capers, 2 cans of black olives chopped in mini chopper, and 3/4 t red pepper flakes. Ahmazing! Def think the anchovy paste is needed... but be sure to NOT get any on your hands!!!!! It smells. Lol.. but is needed to give a more complex flavor. We love this dish :)

Love it! I'm usually not a fan of anchovies and I've never had capers, but this dish was fantastic. I used six roma tomatoes that I chopped in my food processor in place of the sieved tomatoes. Made the sauce a little more tomato-y than is probably recommended in the recipe, but it was still delicious. I will make this again!

This is the first time ever making any kind of Puttanesca from scratch. I've only ever had Puttanesca out of a jar from the supermarket and I never liked it before. I think I would make this again, if I was ever in the mood for it. I halved it just because I didn't need to make that much. 

I used regular sliced black olives, a can of diced tomatoes and some green olives (not Greek). I also cut the olive oil to 2 1/2 Tbsp. because it didn't need that much oil. 
It turned out pretty good! The anchovies kind of disintegrated in the cooking process, which I didn't expect. 

I only gave this 4 stars because it wasn't anything super amazing (which might be because of not using Greek olives), but it's worth making or eating more than once.

I am Italian and have been enjoying Puttanesca for years.  I can tell you that this recipe was very good.  I cut back on the anchovies so I think that helped to make it less salty.  I enjoy cooking fresh Italian pasta dishes like this one.  Thanks for sharing..Lou ****

Triple the garlic-garnish with more chili flakes-use good quality fresh Sicilian green olives. I also used Italian whole-wheat linguine.

Very easy recipe! I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of fresh. I only used enough olive oil to saute but that's for our preference. I put everything but the garlic into the food processor to make it easy. I used kalamata olives, but think I will try a milder variety next time. I also added a can of mushrooms b/c I can't have pasta without mushrooms!!

My parents loved this, I thought it was ok, and my 4-year-old didn't care for it. I doubled the garlic, used thai fish sauce in place of the anchovies since I didn't have any anchovies, and left out the tomato paste and capers because I didn't have those either. The flavour of this sauce really depends on the quality of your olives. You need to buy real Italian or Greek olives from the case in the deli area of the grocery store. Canned olives have no flavour whatsoever.

This was good.  I made it with whole wheat linguini and cut down the olive oil to 1/4 cup and instead of fresh tomatoes - I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes - drained.  It wasn't as good as my favorite restaurants - but it was good.  I don't think I could make this weekly as it is pretty salty tasting...maybe once every 4 months or so.  I do love my olives.  :)  Kids wouldn't touch it.

I made the recipe as described, only exchanging Calamata olives for the Greek olives.  It was excellent.  The whole family loved it, including two 4 year-old's and one 6 year-old.  I will definitely double the recipe next time and serve with a loaf of Italian bread.  My east-coast Italian husband was disappointed he didn't have any bread to sop up the extra sauce...

This recipe was wonderful! I unintentionally made some changes to it, because I made it from memory, so I forgot to add the chili flacks, and didn't add tomato paste, but I did add a little diced purple onion to it. I also ended up using a whole can of anchovies, which I melted in the oil, garlic, and onion mixture, because I was worried it might taste to fishy for my fiance if I just added them in with the tomatoes. Wonderful, fast, simple recipe. I will be adding this our regular repertoire of recipes. :)

Clearly if he can figure out what it is solely by his tastebuds, I did something right!   Like one of the other reviews, I didn't put the tomatoes through a sieve and instead had them chunky.   The tastes were intense and delicious!

I love this dish and it is so quick and easy to make.  I have made it at least 5 times now. It doesn't taste super fishy but there is a subtle taste of fish. When it all comes together it is wonderful.  I usually do 1/3 c oil and to save time I don't strain the tomatoes. My 6yr. old daughter loves it.

Very nice change from our typical spaghetti dinner. I doubled the recipe and used two cans of crushed tomatoes. I also cut back to two garlic cloves and used less oil.

This was just ok for me.  Gave it 4 stars because hubby raved about it.  I doubled the recipe and used calamata & green olives.  The recipe calls for WAY too oil.  I cut back by 1/4c and still had this layer of oil over the sauce.  I ended up using paper towels to soak up most of the oil.

DELISH!!! Very different from other Puttanesca sauces I've tried before. My husband does not really eat anchovies-he did not even relaize that the sauce had it. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and it worked just fine. I also used pitted black and green olives. Will be making this for a party I will be having in 3 weeks time. I'm sure my guests will rave about it.

Bravo! I really like this recipe, although I did make some (unintentional) changes. First, I only used about 2 tbsp of oil as others mentioned. Since I did not have fresh tomatoes, I added a canned diced tomatoes, but added a 28oz can of diced tomatoes instead of 14 oz by accident (oops!). I omitted the tomato paste since I already had enough tomatoes. I actually really liked it with that many tomatoes, but next time I'll add some paste since I like the my puttanesca a bit thicker. Thanks for the recipe!

This is probably the version on allrecipes.com that's closest to the traditional recipe.

I made this exactly as described, with the following exceptions: (a) didn't push tomatoes through sieve; and (b) only used about half the olive oil.

Nice!

Very good an easy.  I used 1 15 oz can of Italian diced tomatoes since fresh are out of season now and omitted the anchovies because I don't eat meat.  It was very tangy and flavorful.  A definite permanent addition to my recipe box.

This is a wonderful puttenesca...and so easy! I've made it many times already. I rarely use measurements, but I know that I add more olives & capers than the recipe calls for. I also omit the tomato paste and usually use some diced and some crushed cans. For a delicious variation, use this sauce to make a baked ziti...it's awesome!

Yummm... puttanesca can get overpowering at times but this recipe managed to produce a wonderfully strong flavor without becoming overwhelming.  I agree with all the previous reviewers that cutting the olive oil down to 2T was the way to go.  Also, I couldn't find good fresh tomatoes so a can of diced worked just fine.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent!  I didn't have kalamata so I used 9 black olives and 11 large spanish green olives.  Also added a touch of tabasco and cayenne along with the red pepper flakes for heat.  I used 1/8 c of olive oil and it was plenty! Also took a reviewer's advice and sauteed the olives and anchovies with the garlic.  Thanks Barb!

WONDERFUL!! I made this for Bunco. I tripled the recipe, but used only 1/3 cup oil for all. Thanks for the tip from previous reviewers. Also from a tip, I used canned diced tomatoes. Just open the can and pour, juice and all. It worked very well. And, it took such a short time to prepare! I had many compliments AND was asked for the recipe. What higher praise is there? I appreciate Barb Roose for sharing this recipe. It made my Bunco night!!

Very simple and extremely flavorful.  I would use about half the amount of olive oil and next time I'm going to try crushed tomatoes to make it even more simple.

WOW! This recipe is filled with flavor. My boyfriend gobbled it up so fast that i almost didn't get to eat any. I had to fight him for it. Thank you for this great dish.

Very tasty - but a true puttanesca means no cookng - still it didn't take any time and was very good - and this is comming from a die hard picky Italian cook!!!

This was delicious.  We don't like olives so we omitted them with fabulous results.  I also used crushed tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes and just added an extra tablespoon of tomato paste.  I also only added about 2 tablespoons of oil to sautee the garlic instead of the amount suggested(we're trying to lose a little weight :) ) and it still was great.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is really an excellent puttanesca recipe.  Full of flavor!  My husband wasn't too crazy about the olives, he said it seemed a little overwhelming but that's what this sauce is all about so I just think he's not a fan of puttanesca and don't fault the recipe for it.

and put chicken in with anchovies.  And linguini for pasta.
This is a favorite of ours.

Fantastic  flavours!!  I did add 1 tsp oregano and a finely chopped small onion as suggested by similar recipes. I also used half can of marinara sauce rather than tomato paste. I simmered the onion for a couple mins then added the garlic until it was aromatic before adding the rest of ingredients.  I let it come to a soft boil then turned it right down to low to let the flavours simmer in together for a bit and thicken before serving it with rice vermicelli noodles and parmesan cheese...SO good!

This was fantastic!!  I did cut up 2 boneless chicken breasts into 1" chunks and sauteed separately in the olive oil before I made the sauce. Take chicken out when almost done,  then make the sauce, add back to sauce and let simmer about 15 minutes. I did cut the olive oil back to 1/4 cup. Leave the anchovies in they disappear into the sauce and you don't taste them either, just an added richness to the sauce. I bet shrimp would be excellent in this sauce also.

Made this for the first time today! Turned out great! I made a few changes (most based on other reviewers suggestions). I used less oil 1/3 cup instead of 1/2. I cooked the anchovies in the oil with the garlic to have them “melt away”. Also used fettuccine instead of spaghetti as per another reviewers suggestion. Used two cans of peeled crushed tomatoes instead of going through the whole sieve thing. Also dialed down the capers (2 tablespoons instead of 3). Will make again!

I love this pasta dish but don't like the meaning of the name at all ! Anyway, I have been  making for years following  the exact recipe. for the tomatoes,  I found it easier to cut the tomato in half and grate it all the way to the skin, using the large hole side of the grater. I always make the sauce earlier in the day and, at dinner time heat it while the pasta is cooking.

I made this exactly as directed, except I only had green olives, so I used those (would have preferred black). It didn't matter. This is SO DELICIOUS. Puttanesca, where have you been all my life?! Thanks for an awesome and easy recipe.

I used san marzano tomatoes which I chopped in the food  processor to make just over 2 cups. I threw in a few fresh basil leaves because why not? I had a  lot. Also, I used anchovy paste. This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. Hubby and I had 1/2 of the sauce with pasta for dinner. I saved the rest of the sauce and used it to make one of the best pizzas ever. We make home made dough. Just add cheese and toppings and bake in a very hot oven. yummy.

Followed the recipe exactly although I reduced the amount of olive oil, 1/2 cup just seemed like so much. Having never eaten this dish before I had no idea what to expect. Unfortunately it didn't really go over well in our house. Hubby said it might be one of those dishes that is an 'acquired taste'. We will not be making this again.

I saw this in the allrecipes November magazine issue and it looked so good we had to make it.  We enjoyed this a lot and made it over Fettuccine as one of the reviews in the magazine suggested. Flavor was right there as expected with the capers and Kalamata Olives, the anchovy flavor was very mild and should not be omitted in this dish.  We did find that it used too much EVOO.  I spooned some of during the simmering, I will definitely cut back to at least a 1/4 Cup next time around. Very good overall and easy to make!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I doubled it in order to make enough food for all of the guys in the house but otherwise made it as written.  This is so quick and easy to make and full of flavor. Looking forward to having this again in the near future!

I had some fresh tomatoes that needed to be used. I love Pasta Puttanesca, but had never made it. This recipe is very simple and the results are delicious! It is quite salty, so be careful about salting the water for the pasta.

Nice recipe.  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and omitted the tomato paste.  It was awesome.

I added more capers and garlic, used 24 oz can of whole tomatoes, sautéed 1/2 onion and the garlic and put all of it into the processor and then sautéed it all for about 10 minutes.  OMG - this is just to die for.  And I hate anchovies!  But it is so needed for the taste.  Rinsed capers, anchovies, and olives to lessen the salt.

Loved it! I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and I used a 24 oz. can of crushed tomatoes. Put a whole can of anchovies (drained), capers, and olives ( I used 15 Kalmata olives and 10 castelvetrano olives- these take the bite out a bit) in the mini chopper and added that to sauce. I also occasionally add 1/4-1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  I cooked the sauce for 30mins to 45 mins and it was fabulous!

I make this all the time but do make some changes because my husband will not eat anchovies.  I add extra olives and throw in some green ones to add a little extra flavor that is missing because of the anchovies.  It turns out great.

I have tried it thrice, the first attempt wasn't that perfect but after second and third try I am satisfied! Very easy to prepare, ingredients are surely always available in our fridge and the taste is awesome. This recipe is my life saver whenever I am running out of time and menu.

This is a favorite in my home and have shared with many friends who rave about it! Tried with fresh tomatoes as well as canned diced  and both superb! Simple to make and you will be touted as a great chef with those lucky enough to dine with you!

this is a fantastic recipe.  I have used it so much the edges are greasy and frayed.  Sign of a well used recipe.  Only thing I don't put in is the anchovies. It is one of my family favorites and my grandpa asks for it every time I cook for him.  The tangy kalamata olives make this dish.  Try it!!

For me this is a to-die-for pasta sauce. That said, it may not be to everyone's liking as the flavors are extremely bold. As another reviewer noted, you do not need a large amount of sauce to flavor your pasta. I did use a large can of the San Marzano tomatoes in place of fresh, and used the whole can of anchovies. I will definitely be making this one over and over!

I modified this in a few ways: I used a whole tin of anchovies, doubled the red pepper, and used 4 cloves of garlic. I thought it was really good, but a little oily, and still not spicy enough. I think next time I'll go down to 1/3 cup oil, and up to 1 Tbsp red pepper flakes.

I made this for the first time last night. I LOVE it!!!  Its so easy to make. I did not add the chopped olives because I was already using a Greek EVOO and I don't like an overly strong olive taste on anything I make.

Very tasty sauce.  This is probably the best sauce I'v ever made!  I would cut back on the oil just a little though.  This is excellent with a fresh pasta.

Excellent!! I made this without the anchovies or tomato paste and cut the olive oil down to a few Tbs. Tons of great flavor, will make again and again. To make it a main dish, I'll add chicken next time.

This recipe was perfect! Only thing I did different was leave out the anchovies (fish allergy) and added a bit more red pepper (we like spicy!) It was DELICIOUS!!! Tastes almost identical to Mamma Lombardi's puttanesca.  Which is my favorite italian restaurant.  This will definitely be a regular in our dinner rotation!

I had to look at the recipe to see if maybe I wrote it down wrong, because, somehow, it was a little bland.  I used crushed tomatoes as one user suggested.  Maybe that was my problem, because I'd have thought olives, anchovies, capers et al would be anything but bland.  I will probably try this again exactly as written (well, minus some of that olive oil)because what I ended up with, while decent, just didn't seem right.

I can't imagine a tastier sauce that is this easy to make.  Worthy of fine restaurants.
