I would recommend adding 3 cups of chicken broth or a 2 cups broth and one cup red wine.

This was really good, but I made several changes. I used Italian turkey sausage and browned it before putting it into the crockpot. I used chopped onion instead of the onion powder. I used chicken stock instead of water. I also added some Italian seasoning--when I tasted it, it seemed like it needed a little something extra. And when the soup was nearly done, I added more chicken stock and some barley. In the end, it was very hearty and satisfying. It smelled a little weird while cooking, so I had my doubts, but it was really tasty.

This was a nice hearty dinner.  I used a slightly different method though.  Adding tomatoes to uncooked beans goes against everything I know about cooking beans.  I was afraid that the acid in the tomatoes would prevent the beans from getting soft.  So I added everything but the tomatoes and tomato sauce to the beans with enough broth to cover them well.  Cooked until the beans were tender, stirred in the tomato products and cooked on low.

Instead of water, I added chicken broth. But I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor of this soup. It was simple to make and even my 5 and 7 yr olds loved it! And they are usually very picky.

Even though I thought this might turn out bland, it was very good!  I added 2 chicken buillion cubes, 2 BIG fresh diced Jalepenos (really kicked up the spice nicely). I added quite a bit more garlic, and 2 Tbsp of red wine vinegar.  The last 10 minutes I added some 'quick cook' barley to make it a bit more hearty.  This was much better than other 'multi bean' soups I've tried!

I tried this yesterday and it was excellent. I added andolle sausage and used chicken broth and a cup of red wine. It turned out excellent. T took it to a soup sampling party last night and had rave comments on it.

This was pretty good. Next time I'll make it with spicy Italian sausage to give it the kick I think it needs.

I Made a couple of adjustments based on other reviews by using c-broth and letting rest over night before serving.  used ham instead of sausage.  Didn't get rave reviews but everyone ate it.  I think we prefer my old fashion pinto beans to this.  Probably won't make again.

Substituted 2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup red wine in place of water per other reviewers suggestions. This is a great bean soup recipe, even better the 2nd day.
