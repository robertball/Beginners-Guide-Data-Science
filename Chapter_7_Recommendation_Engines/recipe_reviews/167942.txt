Best Kung Pao recipe I've tried--tastes just like PF Changs.  WARNING:  DO NOT use 16 red chili peppers unless you have dead taste buds.  We used 4 and our mouths were on fire.  2 is a good amount to use.

So I tried this recipe last night.  I omitted the shrimp, peppers and the optional peppercorns, because seriously where do you find them? Anyway I used frozen snap peas and frozen regular peas and cut up some carrots - you could use any veg really. It's more about the sauce/flavor. And The only chiles I could find were the big ones (recipe calls for 16 dried red chile peppers, cut in half) 16? That seemed crazy to me. So I simply cut up a big chile and removed the seeds. This part I will adjust because I like it spicy, and this was on the mild side. I served it with minute Jasmine rice. And it was really good! Can't wait for leftovers :)

This was amazing! The only problem was the shrimp was a little over-cooked. Next time I won't cook the shrimp with the chicken at the beginning, I'll just add it after I put the veggies in the wok.

I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted like soy sauce and the heat from the peppers, which was disappointing. I like spicy food but not if there's no other flavor other than "hot". I'd grind the peppercorns, too. No one liked crunching into them and they were hard to avoid.

Great flavor!   I left out the shrimp and used 2 chicken breasts & doubled the sauce and added veggies I had on hand. (mushrooms, onions, green peppers, celery, shredded carrot, and green beans.)  I added some sweet chili sauce in place of the red chili peppers. 
I have at least 6 servings of this dish (and I was trying to cook for 2.)  I served this over rice and it was a hit!  Looking forward to leftovers.  Thanks !

This is one of the best restaurant style Kung Pao's I've ever had!  It was made even better with fresh peppers from my garden.  I only made one substitution, using peanut oil instead of vegetable oil.

This was very tasty, and you can customize the ingredients.  I used all shrimp instead of chicken, and added celery and eggplant.  I also didn't have peanuts so I used cashews.  I don't know what "rice wine" is so I used rice wine vinegar.  Delicious.

Great and easy recipe!  I think you could cut the oil in half to reduce calories, which I will try next time.  I left the chile peppers out because it was for my kids but it still turned out great without it.  My husband loved it, highly recommended!

Loved it! Had just the right amount of heat to it. We ate it over white rice since it was a quicky lunch. I would proudly serve this to my guest, therefore it rates 5 stars. Thanks for a great recipe. I intent to make again and again.

I only rate after making a recipe to the T per the instructions of the submitter. I gave it 5 stars as is, and the only adjustments I would make are to cut back on the oil just a bit, and thicken the sauce with cornstarch mixed with water, so it coats the meal a bit more. This was delicious over some noodles tossed in sesame oil. I'll be making this again.

I made this using red bell pepper, broccoli, water chestnuts, snow peas, and green onions.  I didn't put the peppercorns in, and I used sriracha in place of the chilis because that's what I had on hand.  I did add some chopped fresh ginger.  I forgot to sprinkle the cornstarch onto the chicken, but I mixed a small amount with some cold water and added it to the sauce as I cooked it.  It came out fantastic- I will definitely make again and again!

Love this recipe!  Mine turned out spectacular!  The 16 dried red chile peppers added just enough spice.
Where it says the garlic will brown in a few seconds, they're not kidding!  Before this step, I would turn my burner down to medium.  Still turned out perfect!  I added zucchini to mine!  Delicious!

This was very good! I used sesame oil in place of vegetable. I also added a touch of grated ginger. I didnt have the dried chilis so I used VERY hot jalapenos from the garden. I added bean sprouts, carrots, onion and cabbage to this so I could use up my veggies. I'll be making again!

Best tasting Kung Pao I have had. Used 16 chinese red chiles and was just right. Hot but not overwhelming. Our friends loved it and went back for 2nds and 3rds. If you add the Szechuan peppercorns it will not seem so hot. I went by the recipe except for dark soy sauce which I have to order from Amazon along with the Szechuan peppercorns.

Excellent recipe, but there should be one change.   The chicken and the shrimp should be marinated and cooked at different times.   If you cook them together, the shrimp will overcook and be rubbery.   The chicken needs to be cooked first until nearly done, then add the shrimp.

Delish!  Only change was that  I used 3/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes instead of whole chilis.  It was just 'zesty' enough for our liking.

Tastes a lot like the kung pao chicken recipe, but easier. I used regular white wine instead of rice wine and used all shrimp. Good!

First, I definitely agree with others that 16 chili peppers is way over the top. I used 9 and my wife couldn't eat it. I actually like a lot of spice so was OK with it. Overall I thought the recipe was pretty good but the flavor wasn't that potent other than the chili. Maybe I did something off but I wouldn't make it again.

DELICIOUS!  Used 5 tsps of Sambal in place of peppers & had perfect amount of heat... it's a keeper.

This was good but not great.  16 chili peppers is the perfect amount.  I added the shrimp for the last 3 minutes of boiling the chicken with the sauce.  Any before that and it would have been overdone.  Cut back on the sesame oil, too.

Delicious! I used coconut oil to fry since I read that is considered healthier (currently) and it was great. I tripled the whole thing. I recommend finding a way to cook the shrimp a bit less than you cook the chicken - it turns out perfectly with just a short time frying and boiling.

I left out the chicken. Would probably use fewer peanuts next time.

Used only a quarter of the hot red chillis, as others had suggested, added celery and mushrooms, and husband said he loved it, so that's a win in my book.

I haven’t even eaten it yet but it smells amazing and I tasted it and it tasted sooooooo good!!!!! I added some orange zest, Maggie sauce, and lemon ponzu, along with some broccoli, carrots, and snap peas instead of bell peppers. Can’t wait to eat in a few!!!!!

My family loves this recipe, we make it at least twice a month.  I always increase the amount of bell peppers and I often decrease the dried chili peppers so it is not too spicy for me.

If you cook chicken and shrimp together , the shrimp will be overcooked!    Added a little water chestnuts and bean sprouts to up the nutritional value.  A very good base recipe, you can do so much with this one.  So let your creativity go wild!  Oh and just for the record I added 20+ dried Thai chilies .....no problem hear!  Also added soy nuts as well, gives a great flavor.  Well done on this recipe!

Great recipe. If you do any amount of spicy Asian style cooking do yourself a favor and purchase some of the sichuan peppers. They really enhance the heat from the red peppers.

I did modify to make lower kcal and carbs (no peanuts and didn't use any oil).  Super yummy.  My husband raves about the dish and actually ate the leftovers!
