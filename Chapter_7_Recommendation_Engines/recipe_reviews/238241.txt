Wanted to like this one, but after giving it a few bites I decided that was more than enough.  I went with my instinct and cut the cayenne in half, but it was quite spicy even halved; I did not find it enjoyable.  Also, there is a faint gritty-ness to the mouth feel of this yogurt recipe, which I'm guessing comes from either the high amount of cinnamon and/or the cocoa powder.  My husband only had a little taste and exclaimed "blech, it's got too much of something." It definitely does NOT taste anything like chocolate cheesecake, as stated in the description.  Sorry, we did not care for this.
