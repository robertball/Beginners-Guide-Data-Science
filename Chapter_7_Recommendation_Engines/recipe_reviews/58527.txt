I made this for a birthday party, as well as my regular tried tested and true spinch dip. The liquid smoke flavor ruined the dip.

Thank you so much for sharing Justine.  I was looking for something to serve at my wine club and this was perfect.  In the picture I adapted it to go into the crockpot for work.  (no changes to the recipe were made, just placed in crockpot instead of oven) I served it on Boss's Day for our spread with as many different kinds of crackers and breads I could find.  2 crockpots full, None Left by mid-afternoon.

I made this as a main dish to toss with pasta. I won't post my low-cal changes because I think that's not fair to the poster. I just wanted to say thank you for posting your recipe which gave me inspiration to make my own version. Props!

This is very good. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have another spinach dip that I like a little better. But it definitely worth making the only thing I changed was that I added a half a cup of alfredo sauce & some pepper. Served it with tortilla chips. Everyone loved it.

I loved how hearty this is compared to other spinach artichoke dips!  The chicken and liquid smoke do GREAT things.

This was an easy, delicious recipe! Made it for guests during a movie night, and the dip got as much attention as the movie! I made it exactly as the recipe indicates, and will make it again. Regularly.

I just made this for work tonight and it tastes AWESOME. I added the water chestnuts and hickory flavor like a reviewer suggested. It tastes fabulous to me. I got scared and only used a capful of smoked flavor and half the water chestnuts. Next time I will use more canned chicken the costco brand is the BEST. Added way to much mayo bc it looked so dry before placing it in the oven. But it's still quite yummy. Excited to share it at work. Hope the like it as much as I do :-)

I stole this recipe from my husbands cousin a couple Christmas' ago, and instead of baking it we just put it in an electric fondue pot so it stay warm all evening, tastes just as good as it does coming out of the oven.
