Wow!! Can I say I LOVED this bread??? It rose super high, so I'm glad I used the foil trick but didn't have it tight enough on one side and the dough spilled over the edge and baked on the side of my pan. I just cut if off when the bread was done and ate it, and it was moist, and really delicious! I made three changes: I used 2T honey instead of the Agave Nectar, I also threw in 1/4 cup unsulphured molasses which gave it a rich and delicious taste, and I upped the Xanthan Gum to 4tsp. I'm pretty sure this recipe would have been rich and delicious without my changes, so don't hesitate to make this one!! AWESOME!

The batter rose above my pan the first time I made it and drooped over the sides so I cut a strip of aluminum foil in half length-wise, oiled the sides (and bottom). of the pan, placed the aluminum just around the sides, extending it above the sides and sprayed oil on the foil (the oil on the pan will hold the foil in place). Worked like a charm! Great bread, my husband loves it.

Super moist and not at all dense or crumbly like so many gluten-free breads turn out. This is a great sandwich bread. (I added 1 Tbsp. of yeast to the mix and didn't use the milk and poppy seeds on top.)

This is a really good bread.  The texture is close to wheat bread and the taste is quite nice.  It holds up well and also makes great toast.  It's hard to find a good GF bread recipe but this one  is.  Thanks for sharing.

Really delicious! I used a foster's beer (12 oz.) and skipped the xantham gum and buckwheat (used 3 c gf all purpose flour) and it still got rave reviews from company. Enjoy!

We made this bread Monday. Best GF homemade bread I ever made and have been trying for over a year! It's soft and pliable and texture nearly exactly like wheat, and is still fresh on counter on Thursday! I made sure to pre heat my oven to 170 and turn it off to let the bread rise in it. Made all the difference! Took an hr to rise, but first time ANY gf bread has come out so well!! Thank 4 the recipe!!
Also we used zevia ginger ale in place of beer!

Wow! I Used half coconut flour instead of the full gluten free dose and xylitol instead of sugar. Stuck it all the the bread maker and off it went. I can safely say,hand of heart, this is the best loaf free from gluten and dairy (optional) that I've had in years.

This is the best gluten free bread I've had to date. I used redbridge gf beer, a TBSP or so of chia seed, and use 1/2 of buckwheat flour and 2 1/2 cups gf flour. It's super moist. I can leave it on the counter loosely wrapped and it doesn't dry out. Keeps for a long time in the fridge. Makes excellent bread crumbs. Another plus, I can make it without a stand mixer. I add the dry ingredients to the wet and when it becomes too thick to mix I add the beer and yeast gradually. It's almost too much for the mixer to handle but it's my only option and the bread comes out beautifully. I mix a bit longer then the recipe calls for to make sure it's blended.

Yes I made it, and will try again. I do not think my flour mix was correct as it was so sticky that I could not keep it from climbing my mixer?

It was a pretty good bread for being gluten free.  It has good flavor and is fairly dense which i like.  I did find that while your chewed it, it seemed a bit grainy but I also couldn't mix it very well to start and maybe all the ingredients weren't well incorporated.

The BEST gluten free bread I’ve ever had. Have made it multiple times now with whatever GF flours I happen to have in the house (I always use some buckwheat though). I up the recipe to 22 servings and bake it in a big round oven safe bowl.  Makes a nice round loaf, rises quite high.  Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe!!

The 4 stars rather than 5 is probably my own fault! When I poured this into my loaf pan, I realized if it raised very much at all, it was going to go all over my oven! Thus, I chose to not let it rise much at all before baking it. It raised while cooking to the perfect size; however, it came out very, very dense (which, again, is most likely my fault lol). 

I think I will try this again and divide it into 2 loaf pans and let it raise properly. The loaves might be a bit smaller than "normal" but that's okay with me :) I'm hoping this will result in a bit lighter, fluffier bread. It does taste good however!

This IS a delicious recipe! I didn't have xanthan gum and opted to skip it. I also didn't have buckwheat flour, so I used garbanzo flour instead. It was extremely thin (which I assume was from omitting the xanthan). I added enough white flour until it was a little more like a traditional bread dough, but not quite. I assumed it would be a complete bust, but it still turned out amazingly! It's delicious in every way and everyone loves it. What a pleasant surprise to what I'd decided would be a baking experiment. I will one day buck up and get the appropriate ingredients (though the xanthan sounds like I would be better off skipping it), but in the meantime, it's 'tweakable' with a great outcome. Gotta love a forgiving bread recipe!

No changes except I used a little almond milk brushed over the top and sprinkled sesame seeds. Slices like a dream and tastes wonderful without toasting it. Yum
