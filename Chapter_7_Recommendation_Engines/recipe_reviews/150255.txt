A very nice autumnal dessert. I had to cook it in the oven for about 55 minutes to get it to firm up. I'm not a big fan of maple syrup so I substituted caramel sauce. Seemed to be a hit.

I am making this recipe for Thanksgiving -- but direction #5 does not indicate if they should be taken from oven and allowed to sit another 30 minutes, or remain in oven?  Maybe turn oven off and let sit another 30 minutes?  Directions aren't clear -- I would think remove from oven and allow to sit??

My husband and I loved this desert and both thought it was a perfect ending to the Thanksgiving meal. I did not want to buy vanilla beans or a bottle of rum so I used 1/2 t of Vanilla extract and 1/4 t of rum extract. I missed the step on covering them so they came out as a firm custard which worked out. I baked them for 45 minutes. The roasted pecans and real maple syrup on top was killer. I would make this again.

Very good. I baked mine about 45 minutes turned the oven off and let them set in there for about 15 minutes then removed them from the oven. Loved the toasted pecans and maple on top. If I made this again I think I would whip up a little bit of whipped cream for the top as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy recipe loaded with sweet smelling spice in the kitchen.  The maple syrup with pecans added nice texture and additional flavor.  Highly recommend!

The recipe was absolutely delicious! It beat out my chocolate pecan pie for Thanksgiving, as voted by my chocolate loving friends!

Very tasty. The mix needs to be blended very thoroughly or the texture is a bit gritty and uneven.
