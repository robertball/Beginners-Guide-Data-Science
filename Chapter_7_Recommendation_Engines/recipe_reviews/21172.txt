Just a comment really, because I've never tried this recipe.  I thought people might be wondering why this is called "brown bread ice cream" when there is no brown bread in it.  Well, brown bread ice cream is an old British treat and certainly did not contain Grape Nuts!  You literally made your own toffee-flavored chunks by combining brown bread crumbs with sugar and caramelizing them in the oven.  Then blend with traditional vanilla base ice cream ingredients for a unique frozen dessert.

Grandpa B's recipe is the best!  We like to use pasturized egg product instead of raw eggs.

I have tried every flavor of ice cream over the years but nothing excited my tastebuds like this.  A truly wonderful find.  I shared this recipe with my family along with a dish of ice cream.  I should have kept this one a secret.

This is incredibly rich... but delicious!! it never looked like more than slushy consistency though. I eventually added the grape nuts anyway and let it rotate another 10-15 minutes and transfered it to an airtight container and put it in the fridge... left it over night and it was perfect ice cream the next day!

That this ice cream is tasty is no debate -- it's really sweet and decadent, but because of the cream and condensed milk, it doesn't harden up very well.  Condense milk, when it freezes, becomes more like a hard caramel.  Interesting, but maybe next time, I will use less to see what happens.  It's very good, but just melts too fast, becoming a kind of sweet soup with bits of cereal mixed it. I have a terrible sweet tooth, so I will eat anything with enough sugar in it, but my party guests were wincing at the sweetness.

This was simple and fun to make. we loved it. the kid's complained a little about the cereal, but they ate it well. Hard to do a bad ice cream. Different and good.

I was drawn to this recipe because my husband is from Maine and his favorite ice cream from his hometown is grapenuts ice cream.   Softening the grapenuts in the milk  gave them the perfect texture! I was afraid of the raw eggs, so, I cooked the brown sugar, sugar, eggs, milk, & half and half until it reached 160 degrees and then chilled in the refrigerator.  After it was chilled I added the sweetened condensed milk and extracts before putting in the ice cream maker. My husband thought the  ice cream was sweet, but, loved the flavors.  I thought it was unbelievably sweet.   I would make it again, but, leave out the sweetened condensed milk next time.  I think it was perfectly sweet using just the brown and white sugars.
