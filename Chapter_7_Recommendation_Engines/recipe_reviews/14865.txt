I have used this recipe before and I put all the
ingredients together and then let cook in my crock pot for 4 hours. Then I serve it in my mini
crock pot in order to keep it warm.

I used 8oz cream cheese instead of mayo.  I made in a crockpot on low and served with party rye bread and triscuits.  It was a HUGE hit at work and at a school function!

What a hit!  I made this for the adults at my son's birthday party, and figured a few people would enjoy it.  What an understatement.  When it came out of the oven, I couldn't get anyone away from this dish!  They all hovered over it until every last bite had been consumed.  I toasted rye bread and cut them into quarters for dipping.  I also used a combination of swiss and mozzarella cheese for the topping, as I knew not everyone was crazy about swiss cheese.  It was fantastic and I know it will be a requested dish in the future.

This dip tastes just like a Reuben sandwich, but unless you keep it hot, the cheese congeals into a gluey, impossible-to-scoop-up mess. Make sure to serve this in a hot chafing dish or keep the baking dish on an electric hot tray.

My mom has been making this for years, so I took pieces of her version and added it to this one.  I skipped the Thousand Island dressing and used 2 cups of mayo with 1 can of drained and rinsed sauerkraut, a pound of shredded corned beef, one pound of shredded Swiss, 8 oz. shredded cheddar and 8 oz. of mozzarella.  I mixed it altogether and baked it in a greased 9x13 for 1/2 hour and it was out of this world. I served it with Triscuits and cocktail rye, which my guests really enjoyed.

Wow, I've never had so many people beg me for more!  It's definitely worth it to cook up a brisket - quality corned beef makes for quality dip.  I spread a small amount of Jack Daniels dijon mustard over the corned beef before putting on the top layer to add a little zest.  For a party, I make it in several small casserole dishes so while people are enjoying the first batch, another one can be warming up in the oven.  Thank you Karen!

Grandpa and I liked this. I made a sample batch using canned corned beef. I can see that you would have to chop and drain the good quality bag or jar kraut you find in the deli or dairy case, in a strainer overnight and also use good deli corned beef shredded for best results.
The dressing/cheese topping is what makes it really yummy so don't skimp, but don't overdo either. I would use REAL mayonnaise and good name brand Thousand Island. NO nonfat stuff, that is what gives it flavor!

I'm not a Reuben lover, so I didn't even get a chance to taste this, however, my Reuben lovin' guests gave this five stars. I ran my kraut thru the food processor to help make it easier to eat and served on party pumpernickel. A nice change from the run of the mill appetizer. Thanks Karen!

Loved this!! The only change I made was using 3/4 c. mayo and 3/4 c. thousand island dressing instead of the 1/2 c. each as the recipe called for. Very yummy and hearty dip. Served with crackers and everyone inhaled! Great recipe for Reuben lovers!! Thanks Karen!

This recipe is excellent and very different from the norm.  I have recieved many requests for the recipe and have been asked to bring the dip to work several times.  We like it best with crackers.  I have also mixed all the ingredients together in a crock pot, so it would keep warm and it is just as good

Stop! Don't rinse the sauerkraut! This was good, but rinsing the sauerkraut made for tasteless cabbage, losing the zing that makes a reuben a reuben. Squeeze, but don't rinse!

This recipe is great.  However, for it to work/taste well, DO NOT skimp on the dressing as far as fat content is concerned.  I've made it twice; once with light thousand island, and one time with regular thousand island. The consistency between the two is unbelievable.  The light dressing gave the dip a funky taste, and it was runny.  Using the regular thous. island made it creamy and not runny.  I also mixed all ingredients together instead of layering to save on time-it all comes out tasting the same!  Last, I served w/halved cocktail ryes and Gardetto's rye crisps (now available in a bag by themselves!).  Was a hit!

I have made this twice.  The first time, I made it exactly as written, and I give it just 3 stars.  The second time, I took into account some of the recommendations of others and combined all of the ingredients, rather than layer them.  My revisions the second time: only 8oz sauerkraut and 1/2 pound (or 4 packages) of Buddig Corned Beef.  Using Buddig beef instead of deli beef eliminated much of the grease.  8oz of sauerkraut was enough for our tastes.  Both times I made it, I used an 8x8 glass dish.  If I were to make it again (not sure), I would probably add a couple green onions for a bit of color/taste.

Loved this! I did a couple things different though. I mixed the beef in with the dressing/mayo mix and I think it turned out better than if I would have just layered it. Also, I used about 12 oz. of meat and it was just right. When I make it again, I won't use any less than that. Served it with rye crisps, rye Triscuits, and Ritz crackers. Personally, I enjoyed it most on the rye crisps and Ritz crackers. Definitely best when hot.

I bought this dip to a Bunko party and it was the biggest hit!  Added extra 1,000 Island and didn't use all of the cheese.  I also baked it as directed then transfered it in to my electric(very larg) fondue pot to keep warm all night.

We thought this was fantastic. I made it in the slow cooker, setting on high for 30 minutes and the turning to low for another hour and eventually just on "keep warm" setting. Since I estimated my crock pot being smaller than 9x13, I used about half of the sauerkraut, but kept everything else the same. It was fabulous and a big hit. I served with Rye bread that I just toasted and cut into pieces. Thank you ~ this is a keeper.

I made this for a family reunion this weekend as a change of pace from the usual dips and dishes.  It was super easy (I heeded the advice of a previous review and combined all the ingredients in a crock pot and then cooked on low for a few hours before serving) and well-received.  I have never eaten a reuben, but I enjoyed the dip.  Served w/pumpernickle bread cubes and wheat crackers.  I will def add this to my appetizer recipe box.

Delicious.  A big hit.  Strain the sauerkraut well in advance.  Squeezing it dry takes a while if it has not drained sufficiently.  I used fat-free dressing and it tasted wonderful.

Heart attack in a pan, but oh so good... used a pound of corned beef, pound of Swiss, and enough mayo and 1000 Island to make it just right.

It was very good.  My boyfriend liked it a lot.  For my particular tastes I thought it needed to be creamier...but I suppose cream cheese could be substituted for mayo.

This was great tasting dip, but as it cooled the cheese hardened.  I wonder if it would work better if it were stirred up instead of layered.  Will try that next time.  Still, it was delicious and there were no leftovers!  served it with rye crackers.

I have tried a couple of Reuben Dip recipies on here, and this one outshines them by far.  I do double up on the kraut, as well as the mayo/dressing mixture.  I think if I didn't bring this dish to all the gatherings I go to, they wouldn't let me in!  It's definitely best with the Deli Rye Triscuit crackers!

I'm not sure I followed the recipe exactly because it didn't specify whether to use canned corned beef or deli, so I opted for the deli and finely chopped up the beef instead of shredding it.  Can someone tell me if canned corned beef works as well?  If you like Rueben sandwiches, bet you'll enjoy this dip too.

This is outstanding!  I bought the flat brisket corned beef and cooked it in the crockpot.  I used a fork to shred it.  Next time, in addition to shredding it, I will cut the shreddings in half or thirds.  Thank you.

MMMMM....  I made this for a friend during the Super Bowl and it was great.  Now that I've tried it, I'll bring it to a party.  It can easily be layered ahead of time and then refrigerated until ready to bake.  But remember to bake it a few minutes longer if it's cold when you put it in the oven!

With all due respect to the original poster and those who liked the recipe, I did not find the mayo and dressing base appealing. Non-dairy bases separate when baked, leaving pools of grease and congealed solids instead of a consistent, creamy dip. The dish was too sweet--I suspect mainly due to the Thousand Island. I plan to experiment with a cream cheese-based Reuben dip in the future.

I used a canned corned beef and as one review said, used cream cheese instead of mayo.  I will have to bake next time as this time I was too impatient... microwave!  Still, it's yummy and a good pita filling!

So easy and a great hit at parties! Even people who normally don't like saurkraut enjoyed it.

I served this at my New Year's Eve party and it disappeared!  Everyone loved it and I got several requests for the recipe.  I did what another reviewer did and substituted mayo for cream cheese, though.  I made two other dips with mayo that night so I didn't want another dip with mayo.  I halved the recipe and made it in a 2 qt crock pot and served it with cocktail rye bread.

The flavor of this is just wonderful. Next time I make it, I'm using 1/2 the recipe and serving it. If more is needed, I'll make the other 1/2. It only needs a few minutes to heat through and it's nice to serve it up fresh. It's definately a 'keeper'.

Based on other reviews, I did not rinse the saurkraut but drained and pressed out the liquid.  I also added one package of cream cheese, low fat thousand island dressing, 1/2 cup sour cream and omitted the mayo.   I used high quality corned beef from the deli and used a touch over a pound.  No issues with grease for me.  I also used half swiss cheese and half mozzarella.   I mixed it all and poured into a crockpot until hot and bubbly.  Served it with cocktail rye bread and Triscuit rye crackers.  This was delicious!  I took it to a super bowl party and everyone commented on how good it was and was quickly gone! Will definitely make again.

Not as good as I hoped. Could be better with twice the corned beef and half of the sauerkraut. Might try again with adjusted recipe.

My extended family all loved this dip, and my hard-to-please husband LOVED IT, and even ate what leftovers there were. Even I liked it, and I had never had a Reuben before. Triscuits seemed to be the best to dip with. I'll be making this one again soon!

I just used the cheap corned beef lunchmeat and cut it into small pieces. I also didn't layer anything, just mixed it all together and then baked it.  Served it with Rye bread, it was great

I made my own Thousand Island dressing that I threw together at the last minute and I used half sour cream/half softened reduced fat cream cheese instead of mayo because there was already mayo in the Thousand Island dressing. Baking this dip was.....wrong. This was just.....not good hot. I let it cool in the fridge and it was better cold, but next time, I'll use this as a cold spread and skip the oven.

Awesome and I don't generally like Reubens. The one thing I will say is that if there are left overs they don't taste the same the second time around. I made it for just me and my husband and saved the rest.

Now a Super Bowl Sunday standard in our home!!  This was EXCELLENT!!  I did mix all ingredients instead of layer and did cook in oven as directed but kept it warm (stirring every now and then) in a electric fondue pot on warm.  WAS SOOO GOOD! I served this with rye cocktail bread that I cut in half to make dipping easier and also Rye Triscuits.  Thank you SO MUCH!!

I thought this dip was excellent!  I omited the mayonaise, seeing as though I don't use mayonaise on a normal reuben sanwich.  It turned out great!  I went to the bakery, and got a whole loaf of unseeded rye bread and cut it into big chunks. I also kept the dip warm by using an non-stick electric fondue pot.  It worked out great! It was so good and my entire family loved it!

This was delicious!!  Will definitely make again.  I will chop the sauerkraut next time though, it's a little hard to put on the cracker/bread.  Also, will add more mayo and thousand island to make it less dry!  Excellent flavor!

Perfect appetizer for those looking to get away from the normal dips. I brought cocktail rye bread and made miniature rueben sandwiches and they were fabulous. Easy to make just like the recipe says.

This is a favorite!  I usually halve the recipe for smaller groups because it's pretty rich.  I use corned beef from the deli and assemble it ahead of time.

This dip needs to be kept hot, would be perfect as a crock pot dip for parties.  Other then getting hard, it did have good flavor, and my husband ask me to make it again sometime.

This is a total keeper and the crock pot is the way to go.  I used 1/2 lb. corned beef shredded by the deli department at the grocery store.  I also used dark rye bread chunks, but I think a rye cracker of some sort would have been better.  Next time I make this, I will definitely try crackers or Triskets instead of rye bread.  Very good recipe.

I made this for the Super Bowl party and it was AWESOME.  I only changed one thing in the reciepe which was extra thousand island dressing.  It has to be a crock pot dip too because as others said once it cools down the cheese gets lumpy.  I have some great ideas with this dip in the future!

Did not care for this at all.  Will stay to  just the normal Ruben sandwiches.  This was just not the same and mind you not cheap to make.  Nearly twenty down the drain (bought good corned beef).  Advise anyone to try another dip.

I have made various versions of this dip by altering the mayo/Thousand Island (and cream cheese) amounts.  ALWAYS a hit no matter what!  The Fritos Scoops disappear first, followed by Triscuits.

This is fantastic.  I did find I needed to use more dressing on top - used 3/4 cup mayo and 3/4 cup thousand island dressing.  I also used 3/4# corned beef.  The amounts called for seemed a little lean for a 9 x 13 pan.

Great dip! However, I prepare mine slightly different. Instead of layering, I mix all the ingredients together with a little bit of the cheese. Then I place the rest of the cheese on top. This way you're sure to get a little bit of everything with each bite.

Yum! Liked this better than recipe w/sour cream in it. Baked it in the crockpot insert then put that in crockpot to keep it warm. Everyone loved this. Served w/triscuit thin crackers.

I have served this dish many times and people love it. I also put a good quality of mustard in a small bowl next to it for a little kick.  It is a nice addition but still tastes great without it.

I was told this was awesome by several people and the recipe was requested by several people.  I did make some changes
1c dressing
6oz cheese
4oz cream cheese
4 bags of the el cheapo bags of corned beef from the lunchmeat area of the store
combined it all in the food processor and threw it in the crock pot.  Gone in 1 hour.

We didn't like this at all. I made this for a party but hardly anyone ate it. The appearance of the finished product was pretty bad too.

Great appetizer...requested by many guests. The only change I would make is to add more corned beef and less cheese.

We tried this recipe at a recent party and it went over like gangbusters.  I did, however, use "doctored up" sauerkraut.  I saute 1/2 c sliced onion in 2 Tbs bacon grease until clear. Then I drain 1 Qt Kraut, saving the juice.  Add the kraut to the pot with the onion and saute 5 minutes. Peel and grate one apple and add it to the pot along with 1 tsp caraway seed and 2 Tbs brown sugar.  Cover with beef stock and reserved kraut juice and cook uncovered 30 minutes. Put in a baking dish, cover and bake at 325 degrees for 30 minutes. Other than that I followed the recipe.  Super.  Thanks

I have made this dip several times and each time it was a hit.  I use fat free mayo and thousand island dressing.  I've also substituted reduced fat mozzerella for half of the swiss cheese.  I mix the ingredients instead of layering.  So far no complaints.

If you like reubens, you'll like this dip!  I used canned corned beef, instead of deli-sliced, and it turned out fine.  I might cut down a little bit on the mayo and dressing next time, however.  I think it would be better if it were a little thicker.  Thanks, Karen!

A hit!  For the corned beef, I used one 12 oz can of corned beef.  I also doubled the sauce, I hate dry dishes. And it only took about 10-15 min to bake in my oven.  Everyone loved it!!

Wow.  Made this for dinner, for two, and it was SOOOOO good.  Men will love this, and so will anyone who loves reubens.  I ran out of swiss cheese and used cheddar for part of it, and that worked great too.  Soo good the night of, but just ok the next day.  We ate it with torn, toasted pieces of rye bread.  We looked for rye crackers, but in the end we wanted something softer.  Thanks!

Excellent and easy. A nice change from the usual
party appetizers! I warmed mine up in the microwave to save time and served with cocktail
pumpernickel bread. Can always cut back on the
dressing so as not so rich. Thx

This recipe was a hit at the office potluck!  I did it in a crockpot and kept it on low from the time I arrived at work until lunch time.  Take care to stir often because the Swiss cheese has a tendency to burn.  Can't go wrong with this if you love Ruebens!

It's a crowd favorite!  I make the recipe exactly how it is written. I serve it with rye Triscuits.  Yes the cheese congeals after a long while but it still is easy to scoop out with the crackers.  You can reheat it in the microwave if need be.  So so good!!!

I was so excited to make this dip. However, everyone was disappointed. Made as directed, it was an oily, bland-tasting mess. Fortunately, I had a few old faithful standbys that went like hotcakes. I think the only one that enjoyed it was the dog.

I don't regularly eat Reuben sandwiches but everything is great as a dip, right?  I did not care for it.  I think my biggest issue was that the Swiss was so overpowering.  Swiss is my favorite cheese but it was too much in this instance.  And I would never bring it for a work potluck as it stunk up my house so bad.   Thanks for the recipe, though!  :)

I thought this was bland - made exactly as recipe calls.  Will make again as I love Reubens.  Next time will take suggestions of reviews and use at least 1 cup (or more) of thousnad Island.

I used this just to make regular rueben sandwiches just because its so much faster.  I did use less mayo and more thousand island dressing and more than 8 oz of corn beef would be preferred.  Just toasted my bread in the toaster and threw this mixture on the sandwiches.  yum!!  sure beat layering each individual sandwich and then toasting...

This was a GIGANTIC hit! Made it for our New Year's Eve get together and everyone went on and on about it. Made me look like a culinary genius. :-) As recommended by another user, I did substitute one 8oz package of cream cheese (softened) for the mayo. Tremendous! Served it with torn up Hawaiian Bread and Rye Crackers.

I made this using a block of low fat cream cheese in place of the mayo and 2 cups thousand island dressing, as suggested in previous reviews. I mixed it all together and put in crock pot for my Bunco night. It tasted fine when i first made it, but as it warmed in the crock pot, it became extremely greasy, I can only assume from the corned beef. It got seperated, dry, and clumpy, and just plain gross. I would not make this again.

Excellent and EASY recipe.  I made this the first time lest evening (12/11/09) for my company Christmas party.  I used them and my "guinea pigs" and they Loved it!!! The only thing I did at all different from the recipe was added about 1/4 cup more of the dressing and mayo.  I used the packaged very thin sliced corned beef and it tasted wonderful.  I usually make mini reubens which is very time consuming, but if you are in a time crunch this a wondeful alternative to the traditional reuben.  I used the mini Jewish rye bread and it tasted fabulous!!

This was a big hit at my nephew's birthday party yesterday. I served with Rye Cocktail Bread and Rye Triscuits. Next time though I think I will add some more Thousand Island Dressing though as it was a little dry.

Served this at a cookout and every party goer asked for the recipe. After cooking it, I scooped it all out and mixed it together in a serving dish with the bread and crackers. Just had to microwave once we got to party. You also need a small serving knife for folks to spread it on their cracker etc. BIG HIT would make again in a heartbeat.

This was really good! I had to improvise and make my own pretend 'Thousand Island' with chili sauce, mayo, and a little dill. I mixed the ingredients together instead of layering and added a little cheese to the top. I halved this recipe to use my leftover corned beef and baked it in 2 gratin dishes for 20 minutes @ 350. Turned out great - and GONE. Thanks!

The flavor of this dish is great.  But I didn't care for the texture...it wasn't really like a dip and was hard to scoop with crackers/chips due to the clumps of beef/sauercraut.  Next time, I will double the sauce and then mix up instead of layering.  I can see how it would be good in the crockpot...but still think it needs a bit more sauce.

I didn't have very good luck with this recipe. I don't know if I layered the ingredients in the wrong order or what, but it just did not come out well at all. Somewhat of an expensive recipe to botch...Maybe will try again later because it sounds so good!

Great dip even my 7 year old son loved it. My father in law is a huge reuben fan so I made this with him in mind. I did cut the recipe in half since I was making so many other dishes. It was half gone and he took the leftovers home to eat later. Really very good. I served it with Toasted rye bread.

I have made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe to a "T". The next time I changed it to my families taste. I used 1/4 cup mayo and 3/4 cup Thousand Island rather than half and half. It gave it more of the Reuben flavor. Also I just mixed everything together rather then layering it. It seemed to make no difference to us and it was a lot faster. To keep it warm I used a heating pack form the pyrex portable (I'm sure a crockpot would work great too). I served it with cocktail rye bread. This is a keeper and everyone always wants the recipe!

My daughter and I are huge Reuben fans and we loved this.  I used 4 oz. cream cheese instead of mayo as suggested by another reviewer and almost a full bottle of Marzetti Thousand Island along with a tsp of caraway seed and 10 oz of deli corned beef then mixed everything together.  I reserved a little of the Swiss cheese to put on the top and baked it in a Pampered Chef round stoneware baking dish until it was bubbly.  It wasn't greasy at all, we will be making this again.

Fantastic Dip! My hubby found it and said, "makes this!" I told him I don't know about that one. Boy am I glad I made it!  The only thing I changed, was I used 16oz velveeta.  I figured it would reheat better. Just perfect!  At first I started eating it with chips, but I found it to be MUCh better with just rye bread!

What a great recipe! I took this to a memorial day party and numerous people asked me for the recipe.  I did alter it some.  I used a larger jar of sauerkraut as well as added more 1000 island dressing.  Although another reviewer warned against using low fat dressing, I used fat free kraft 1000 island and it was fabulous! Very tangy and perfect.  We served this with fresh marbled rye bread.    I definitely recommend this for any summer BBQ or party!

Everyone at my party LOVED this! 
(including myself. Once everyone got a taste of it it was gone in no time!
I was short for time, so I mixed it all together & microwaved it for about 5 minutes & served it in my mini crockpot to keep it warm with a loaf of toasted rye bread cut into chunks for dipping. 
It was a HUGE hit! I will definitely make this one again.

Wow... this is amazing.  I had made one before, combining everything in a crock pot, but I (along with everyone else), LOVED this... it was absolutely delicious.  I layered the kraut, corned beef, dressing and cheese (in that order)in a large (13x9) corning ware dish and baked it.  I used the jarred kraut and everyone commented how moist and sweet it was.  I used Ken's new Russian dressing (2 small bottles) with a little mayo to thin.  My husband and I are fighting over the leftovers!  Definitely a keeper!

This was great! I made mine in a crock pot about 4 hours ahead of time. I probably could have gotten away with only 3 hours. I used double the meat and more dressing to make it creamier. I served it with triscuits and pretzel snaps, it was a total hit! Just like eating the sandwich! There was some left over because our party was small, so I froze leftovers and plan to reheat and add some more dressing for a second go-around! This would be something really easy to prepare and freeze for unexpected guests!

Made this in my crockpot by chopping up the corned beef and mixing everything together in the pot and heating on low for two hours.  I just eyeballed the amounts and it still turned out terrific.  The boyfriend declared it a winner and it disappeared in minutes.  It is great using the sauerkraut with caraway seeds, and you don't have to bother rinsing it.

I served this open-face on pumpernickle and it was a huge hit with my husband who doesn't care for kraut. I used half the cheese called for and a little more meat. It came came out delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

SO GOOD. I didn't use as much cheese as the recipe called for even though I loved cheese, but here's what I did: Pressed hash brown potatoes into the bottom of a 9x9 casserole dish, and baked in 350 oven for 20 minutes to pre-cook. Layered kraut, little bit of cheese, corned beef, little more cheese and then baked again for 15 minutes. Finally, I added the dressing mixture and a little more cheese and baked for 10 more minutes. 

What I ended up with was what I would call heavenly. Reuben BOXTY dip (look up a boxty if you've never heard of it! it's DIVINE)

Very easy and tasty.  Used less cheese and there was still plenty.  Could use half.

Went over well at my party. I thought it was a little bland, but everyone else loved it. Will probably make again, will not rinse the saurkraut next time. I think that rinsed a lot of flavor away.

I made the mistake of using canned corned beef, I do think this recipe would be great if I would have used 'real' corned beef.  Otherwise, everyone in the family thought it was good.

I made this dip for my husband to take to work and it was a big hit with all his co-workers.  Served with cocktail rye bread and kept warm in a small crock pot, there were no ingredients that I would change in this recipe.

I made this for New Years Day. It was very good, everyone loved it. It was a tad greasy, so I soaked up grease with a piece of bread before serving. I mixed mine instead of layering it. Worked great. Served with Party Bread. Will make again.

The taste on this was good, but unless you have a way to keep it warm the cheese gets hard to eat pretty fast.

Yummy appetizer, especially for those of us who LOVE the sandwich.  The only change I make is to layer the mayo/1000 mixture before the swiss cheese.  It's just more visually appealing.

After coming across this recipe, I decided to use this as a filling for an actual sandwich.  Therefore, I doubled the amount of corned beef and decided to cut the amount of cheese in half.  After the mixture was done baking, I decided to stir everything together.  WOW -- it was terrific.  I served it on toasted rye bread.  What a great find!

I made this recipe for a small party.  Everyone loved it and it was the first appitizer to go. One of my guests who DOESN'T like Reubens even like this recipe.  I will definitely make it again!  Make sure you keep it warm if you want to serve it as a dip.  Mine stayed out long enough to be more like Reuben Squares - great none the less.

I am told this recipe was terrific!  I served it at our annual Kentucky Derby party.  It went in a flash!  I am preparing it for our annual neighborhood garden tour.  I will definitely try it this time!  I served it with cocktail rye bread and rye Triscuits.  It was a hit!  I was looking for a substitute for baby reubens, which were somewhat difficult to serve for a huge crowd.

Very good but a little oily! I used 10 oz of cheese and it still almost seemed like too much. I also used 3/4 cup of each mayo and dressing. Next time I will use less cheese and maybe lessen the ratio of mayo to dressing!

This was a tasty dip for anyone with a reuben craving. The flavors blended well and it was really easy to throw together on a friday night! Next time I might add some extra corned beef, as I really would like that to be the star of the dish. But I'll definitely make this again!

I was almost afraid to make this because of some of the negative reviews, but it is wonderful.  I served it with cocktail rye as an appetizer for dinner guests, and we all loved it.  I used 3/4 cup mayo and 3/4 cup 1000 Island as someone suggested, but I think 1/2 cup of each would have been sufficient.  I used deli sliced corned beef; I just think it's more appealing than canned.  I will definitely make this again, but will follow the recipe exactly next time.

This was just OK.  It turned out oily and hardened quick.  It wasn't a big hit for the small gathering that I had but I will try again and maybe alter a little.  I used the bagged corned beef found in the meat section.

This recipe is great!  Served it for our annual New Years Eve party last year.  Everyone requested it again this year.  And I am always asked to make this dip whenever we are invited somewhere.  A real hit with the men especially.  Hubby really likes it and would eat it for dinner if I would let him!  Not a real hit with kids though.  I think the saurkraut throws them off.

Great Ruben Dip!!! There is nothing bad about this recipe.  While it says to rinse the sauerkraut I did not. I just squeezed it since we love the flavor. And we used Finn Crisp, thin rye crispbread crackers....sooooo good. Even my husband was eating it....he never eats Rubens because of the kraut.  Will definitely make this again.

It was disgusting. I love reuben sandwiches, reuben soup, and each and every ingredient individually.  I used very expensive corned beef from the deli, shredded my own swiss from an expensive block. Everything else I made got gobbled up, but I had loads of this left.

Made this for the Super Bowl and it was a huge hit. I used 1/4 cup of mayonnaise and 1/4 cup of cream cheese. I also drained the sauerkraut(without rinsing) and put it in a pan to cook with 2 tbsp.of butter and 1/4 cup of finely chopped onions. Cooked until sauerkraut and onions were tender. I used a package of dried beef and crumbled it along with a 12 oz. can of GOYA corned beef, which I just put in clumps over the sauerkraut. Finished the recipe above and served with triscuit  rye crackers. Yummy. Everyone asked for this recipe.

This dip is delicious! I served it at a football game and for those that are not Sauerkraut haters, loved it. The only thing I will say is that this is probably best served in a crock pot on a warm setting. When this dip cools off, it is a pain to try to eat. The layer of cheese gets to be difficult when eating with chips. Other then that, excellent recipe!

Good. No need to grease the pan, which I was wondering about. Next time I will use 1 c. Thousand island dressing instead of half dressing and half mayo. I served it with little crisp pieces of rye bread.

I'm making this for an appetizer for our Easter Brunch. It's cooking in my crock pot and I've taken a couple taster bites and it's AMAZING! I agree with all the other reviews! I bought 3/4 lb. Vienna Roast Beef from the deli and shred it up. I mixed that with 1 3/4 packages of shredded swiss. I rinsed the sauerkraut and dried it a bit by using my salad spinner.  I mixed this with the other dry ingredients. In a separate small bowl I mixed 1 cup of Mayo (light) and 1 cup of dressing. Once I got a good mix on this, I then mixed it to the other bowl of ingredients. I mixed everything really well and put in my crock pot. I'm gonna warm it on low for a few hours and am looking forward to serving this to my family! It's delicious! Thanks for the recipe! Happy Easter!

It was good, but the salad dressing added too much sweetness.

I wasn't a fan of this.  I used a good quality corned beef and sauerkraut but it still lacked taste.  It needed mustard or something.

Was really excited to try this recipe based on other reviews.  It wasn't a big hit, though.  Had lots left over and yes, group was "reuben lovers."  I followed recipe to a T, but it just seemed to lack something - was kind of bland.

This is a great recipe!  I substituted corned goose breast for the corned beef, my guests didn't know the difference.  Definitely a do again recipe.

This was simply excellent. The only change i made was using one 8 oz bag of shredded swiss. I think the size of dish you use determines how much cheese you should use. You'd want 2 bags if you used a 9x13, but I used a really deep pie/casserole round dish. I thought it make a good cheese to other ingredient ratio to do it that way. I might actually try a different type of cheese next time, or put it not on top becuase after it sits for a little bit the cheese really does turn to a rubber sheet! It didn't matter though, all of the guests at our party were happy to cut through a hunk of the cheese and it still tasted great. We at it with Ritz crackers but a rye cracker would be great too. This is an awesome recipe & I'll be making it again and again.

Very good, to solve the cool and hardening problem that people commented on, I combined everything in a crock pot the day before serving and just kept it warm for the day of serving... worked great!  I also added 5 sliced green onions and served this dip with rye chips and rye Triscuit crackers.  Big hit for my game day party.

AMAZING!!!  Made this for a New Year's day get together - everyone loved this, including my husband who does NOT like sauerkraut.  Thought it was a little to greasy the next day but just poured out the grease.  Still tasted amazing!  The deli person shreded the meat for me so saved alot of time!.  Definitely a keeper.

Not the prettiest looking dip, but still tasty. I used deli sliced corned beef so it was a little greasy. I made my own thousand island dressing from this site and used deli sliced swiss cheese that cut up into really small pieces. I would make this again possibly!

I'm afraid that, although I made the recipe as directed, I ended up discarding most of this dip.  Few tasters like it.  I may try something similar again with a few changes.

Super tasty...only thing I modified to make it healthier was using less cheese, about half, I found 4 cups to be a little excessive...it tasted great with 2!

HUGE hit. Many requests for the recipe. So I must give 5 stars. I thought it could use less fats-mayo/more TI dressing. I may try a lower fat version of mayo and dressing next time. It was still quite yummy! Made it twice-had at least 5 or more recipe requests.

This recipe was really good. The only thing I think is that next time I will maybe put the cheese on top instead. Maybe that will make it look a little more appetizing, but it did taste exactly like a Reuben sandwich. Thanks for posting!

Made this dip over the holidays and it was as advertised, delicious!  Really reminded me of Ruben sandwiches I had in the past.  I just couldn't quit eating it, ate way too much!  It was really good with toasted rye bread.  Next time I will try to make it with healthier low fat alternatives since I know I will eat too much!

This was the BEST DIP!  I'm not really a Reuben fan, only because of the rye bread on which it is usually served.  I served it with the tiny, "cocktail" loaves of rye bread(very mild).  It was a perfect match.  Great for leftover sandwiches too.  A++++

Amazing, amazing, amazing. I make this for every get together I have and any pot luck and people RAVE about it and always ask for the recipe. I don't layer it, I mix it and then bake it. Sometimes, I will put it in a crock pot on low for a few hours but I noticed it gets a little greasy that way. Although, that does not stop people from eating it all!! It is the best served with any rye bread not toasted, people will always make a sandwich out of it!

Made this in a large glass baking pan and it was layered after cooking. It was very delicious! It never turned out to use as "dip" but we cut in squares to fit party rye, and leftovers (only 2 of us) was reheated and larger squares cut and placed on toasted regular rye bread and this was better than the regular type Reuben's. We loved it and will make this all the time now! GREAT!!!

Thought this was great! I mixed the ingredients together and did not layer. I probably didn't use as much cheese either, I eyeballed it.  Everyone raved about it today and I will save this one for sure. I served it with Rye Toast and Crostini's.

i thought i had taken the advice listed here and lowered the amount of kraut used in the recipe, but it was still overpowering - i guess it is just what you are used to.  i also increased the meat and dressing, but if i were to make it again i would halve the kraut AGAIN.

Just like the real thing according to my boyfriend.  First time for me to taste a reuben and it wasn't too bad.  Quite a pickle taste.  I used a 2/3 cup of dressing and slightly less cheese.  I also did not rinse the kraut.  Next time, by request, I will use the kraut with caraway seeds.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a football party this past weekend and ended up with half of it left. I think it needs something to "jazz" it up, maybe a couple teaspoons of spicy mustard or something. Just didn't do it for me and/or apparently my guests. It was okay but too expensive to make (using quality ingredients) to not have anyone rave over it or ask for the recipe. Don't know if I will make again. I did mix it together as others have suggested but don't think that would affect the taste that much.

Served this appetizer at a Super Bowl party.  Everyone, especially the men, really enjoyed it.  A few had eaten it before and they couldn't wait for it to come out of the oven.  I served it with rye and other multigrain crackers and it disappeared. As one of several appetizers served, this recipe was plenty for 10+ adults when serves with other appetizers.  However, the pan could easily hold 1 1/2 times the recipe, if needed for a larger group.   (Note: Cooking saurkraut mellows the flavor and in this dish it is delicious)

My husband loved it. I liked it. Next time I wouldn't rinse the krout since we could hardly taste it at all in the finished product. If I have any left over corned beef I'll probably make it again.

This gets 5 stars for simplicity, convenience and taste!  I served this at my annual St. Patty's Day party and everyone raved and requested the recipe.  Don't be afraid if you don't like sauerkraut.  The taste blends so well with the other ingredients and only leaves you with a little kick at the end!  Even better the next day!Great Recipe!  Thanks!

I made this for New Years and a recent gathering of friends. Everyone really liked it and wanted the recipe. I made it in a pretty pie plate, it was very easy to serve that way with party rye toasted(with a little margarine)surronding the plate.

I tried this recipe for a New Years Party but first I made a small batch for myself.  In the small batch I used Budding sliced meat and combined the ingredients as other suggested.  I used the exact proportions as the recipe suggests and it was wonderful.  I did not have a problem eating it even when it cooled.  Most of the cheese was mixed with the other ingredients then sprinkled some lightly on the top, no issues dipping that way. For the party I'm using a more expensive deli corned beef.  It looks delicious.

Made this over the weekend, and it was a big hit. Did not layer ingredients, just stirred it all together, and baked. Served with toasted rye bread, cut into bite-sized pieces.

This was delish!! I made this for a get together and now Everyone keeps asking me to make this.  I also took the advice of others and used cream cheese.  I double mine every time I make it so I will typically half the mayo & use a full block of cream cheese.  We like these with rye bread & pumpernickel toasted bread squares.  I buy a loaf of each, cut each slice into about 4 squares or whatever u feel is adequate for the size you want. I then place on a baking pan & toast in the oven about 4 min. Per side

Very one loves this one. I buy my corned beef at the deli at
 Wal mart they slice it really thin and I just cut it into small pieces. Many times of the year you can buy small loafs of rye bread that are about 4inches square perfect for this dish. Any cracker will do.

Used corned beef that was cooked in the crock pot. Added a little extra meat to make it meatier (12 ounces) and used 2/3 the amount of cheese so it wasn't too cheesy. Went VERY quick doesn't make a whole lot. Definitely will double the recipe for the next batch.

I made this recipe exactly as written & it was fabulous! I do love a good reuben sandwich so I too served it on appetizer sandwich rye bread. After baking in the oven, I placed it into a small sterno that uses tea light candles to keep it warm.

Served in a crockpot with marbled rye toast squares. Ridiculously easy to make and the guys loved it.  Next time I will use a crockpot liner....it was messy.  Totally worth it.

I didn't have time to cook up corned beef so I used pre-cooked shredded pork instead. It's completely gone! Everyone loved it even though the cheese got hard, they kept eating. Next time I'll keep it in a little crock pot. Served with tiny dill and bread and butter pickles and sweet grapes.  Small triangle pitas.

Delicious! I had tried a friend's recipe for Reuben Dip and I have to confess that it was slightly better than this version, but since I don't have her recipe, this was the next best thing.

I made this yesterday and brought it to a family event.  It is just OK.  There needs to be at least double corned beef and at least half the swiss cheese.  My family thought it was swiss dip...not reuben.  They couldn't taste the meat. Oil was floating everywhere.  I most likely won't try it again.

Just made it for a Superbowl appetizer. Used the rye toast suggestion for a cracker and let me tell you it is delicious.

Will definitely make again.

Made this twice. Every time it was gone in 30 min. My brother ate half of it in one sitting. I serve it with cocktail/party size pieces of rye bread. Love it and will continue to make it!

The only thing I changed is I had to use roast beef instead of corned beef but Next time, I'll find some!

This was a very big hit at a Christmas party we went to last night!  Because it had to sit out on the table, it did cool down and make it difficult to cut.  Next time, I will cut it up and small little portions prior to serving.  That will make it less of a struggle for the guests as the cheese does tend to stick together as it cools.

I made this last night for a friends 90's birthday party.  WOW, What a hit it was.  I followed the recipe as posted except I chopped the sauerkraut up (from a review) .  Can put together the night before.  Served with rye bread.  I could not find party size so I sliced sandwich rye.

This dip was amazing! The reviews are all true. It was a HUGE crowd pleaser. I did make a couple minor tweaks. I didn't put any sauerkraut in because my husband doesn't like it, and I added a little extra sweet pickle relish into the thousand island to compensate for missing the acidic bite of sauerkraut. The dip was great and balanced! In addition, I used Gruyere cheese instead of another type of Swiss because I love the buttery, nuttiness of that cheese and am not a fan of other Swiss cheeses usually. This is a keeper!

This sounded like a great recipe, but I was disappointed with the results, after following the recipe exactly as written. My family and I love Reuben sandwiches but no one cared for this dip and I will not be making it again.

Tasted just like a Reuben, but I highly recommend keeping in a small crock pot or other heated serving tray.  The cheese hardened and turned my dip into a brick within 15 minutes of coming out of the oven.

Oh my gosh! This stuff is GOOD!!! I couldn't even wait to eat it - I was sneaking bites before I even got it into the oven. It's still in the oven and I keep opening it to get bites because I can't wait!  If you like reubens you will LOVE this! I didn't change a thing, other than the fact that I didn't actually measure the ingredients.

I made this for Super Bowl, and it was a huge hit with everyone, especially the men.  By chance, I found rye crackers at the local market, that really made this taste like a Reuben sandwich.  

Thank you for sharing!

I brought this dip to book club and it was devoured. Great for super bowl parties too. The only change I made was to eliminate the mayo and just use the thousand island dressing. I will keep this recipe in my recipe box and pass it on!!

I made this for our New Year's eve party last night for friends that enjoy a good  Reuben sandwich like I do. They really loved it. I toasted cocktail rye squares with butter that I added season salt to and then put in my toaster oven. It was the right accompaniment.This recipe is a bit too greasy for me but I will make it again i think-but add horseradish like one of the other recipes to give it more zing.

I made this recipe in a slow cooker as suggested by others for a work potluck.  It was hardly touched.  The taste was rather bland.

Liked it, didn't love it.  Next time I'll probably just make a sandwich if I'm craving a reuben.

Unfortunately, I didn't care for this dip as the other reviewers. I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was heavy on the saurkraut and too light on the dressing. I served with with cocktail rye.

Very good dip and unique.  Cheeses can get a little oily and runny, which didn't bother me but might put some people off.

As a Reuben lover I thought this was really good. I made using all reduced-fat versions of the ingredients. I served with mini-rye but it gets messy because the bread is soft. Next time I might try toasting the bread first or using some kind of cracker.

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and just made this in my crockpot after mixing it all together.  This made quite alot and since there weren't that many people over there were left overs.  I didn't use the crockpot to reheat it and the dip kind of seperated.  That was easily fixed by stirring it, however it didn't taste quite as good the second day.  I will make this again though I will add a little more thousand island dressing and will make sure I had more than one loaf of rye bread.

I made this for a big crowd for a Super Bowl party.  I doubled the recipe....it went REAL QUICK! I served it with mini rye bread, mini pumpernickel, and wheat thins. I followed the recipe...BUT...I didn't use as much Swiss as it called for...it seemed to be too much. Also...I pushed down the corned beef and cheese layers with a fork, so it would get into the layer of sauerkraut, so there was a little of everthing in each bite. I also kind of pushed down some of the dressing layer into the other layers. It was gone in no time after it was baked...and I was asked for the recipe by several people. This is a keeper!!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe! We served it at my wedding reception and I lost track of how many people commented on how delicious and unique it was. People who don't even like reuben sandwiches (let alone several of the ingredients) were trying it and coming back for seconds. This recipe was definitely a crowd-pleaser! My mother said it reheated much better than she expected and made a great sandwich the next day.

I've made a few variations of this dip, and well, they all pretty much taste the same to me. Still a good recipe, though. I like it best with small pieces of pumpernickel bread.

I made this for a party and it is delicious.  I did add 1 8 oz bottle of Kraft thousand Island drsg so about doubled that.  Serving it with cocktail rye but might pick up some rye triscuits per other reviewer's suggestions.

This was a bit too salty for my guests.  Also not very appealing looking - too flat in the pan.  I would suggest a smaller dish, or double recipe in a large pan so that you can actually DIP into it.

I got lots of compliments on this dish--the gist being "I don't even like sauerkraut, but this is good!" But I love sauerkraut and I thought it was a bit bland (I did not rinse the kraut). Maybe it was the kraut I used, maybe it was the 1000 Island dressing I used. Bottom line: I would make it again.

We all enjoyed this, though I found it a bit on the bland side.  Would make again, but probably play some with it for a bit more zing.

This dip is amazing.  I love reuben's and this is just like them.  I served them at my New Year's Eve party and again last weekend.  My guests wanted the recipe.  Thanks!

This was a hit at the first party I took it to.  Didn't have time to try it ahead of time, so didn't know what I'd end up with.  Everyone LOVED it.  Was hardly any left.  We love reubens, and the leftovers, were used the next day for a light lunch!

I made this for a Super Bowl party yesterday and it was the biggest hit. I served it with an extra sour rye bread just cut unto halves. I didn't do any layering of ingredients, just mixed it all together and it turned out great. Since it is pretty much an artery clogger I think I will limit this one to just couple times a year or for poker nights with the boys but a HUGE hit that I highly recommend.

My neighbor made this a while back so I thought I would give it a try.  I must have done something wrong.  It wasn't that great.  But I layered all of the ingredients.  Maybe I should have mixed them up and them put the mixture on top of the sauerkraut.  I was a bit disappointed, but again it could have been my fault.  I'll ask my neighbor and compare recipes.

I thought this was absolutely delicious.  Used to have another one years ago, but lost it. I thought that that one was the best ever, and nothing could compare, but I was wrong.  This was a big hit!!!  Can't wait to make it again!

Wow, everyone loved this dip! It is so easy to make and I would highly recommed it. It's really great for parties, and is so different from the usual party dips other people bring. This dip is always gone before all the others!
