So i made this and the foil on the crust is optional (it turns out just fine without it). when i made the whipped cream/cream cheese filling i used homemade whipping cream but with the lemon juice it tasted off so i added nutmeg cinnamon and cream of tartar to taste. then i didn't have huckleberries so i chopped up strawberries and used them they worked fine. after putting the berry topping on i felt like it still needed something so i dripped (sparingly) vanilla flavoring then chilled overnight. It came out wonderful and i received many compliments. I gave it four stars because i dont know what it would have been like w/o my adjustments

With a little less topping it was GREAT! It would be 5 stars with 1/2 the topping.

Amazing pie!  We have a place that we travel 50 miles to get to.  They have the best huckleberry pies in a region known for huckleberries.  This pie is better by far.  Perfect balance of cream cheese, just enough to balance the huckleberry filling.  I used 1/4 tsp salt for the crust, didn't see the amount in the recipe.  Next time I might make a little more crust and use 1/2 to 3/4C more huckleberries.
