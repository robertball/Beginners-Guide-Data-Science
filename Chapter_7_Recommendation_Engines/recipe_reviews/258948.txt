Excellent as written.  A great alternative to soy based marinade for those of us on a low sodium diet.

This marinade is very flavorful!  However, I marinaded a pork tenderloin, not chicken, and roasted the pork after leaving it in the marinade for about 4 hours.  I also did not use 6 cloves of garlic, just 2 but they were big ones.  I also had to substitute a tablespoon of a spice medley because I did not have plain dried basil or rosemary.   But  I enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe and was happy to use the ratio of ingredients it listed.
