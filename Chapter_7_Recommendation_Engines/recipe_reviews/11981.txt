I did not care for this one - I liked the variety of meat but the sauce had no flavor...There did not seem to be a reason to cook it for so long either...

Enough to feed a crowd is right!  The recipe is easily halved and that is what I did.  I was a little confused about the sausage, I am not 100% sure what the chef's intentions were since we were dealing two type of sausage and it was never made clear if there was a different processes for them, so I de-cased the Sweet Italian sausage and added that when called for.  I Browned the Pork Sausage links, par cooked them then added them with the meatballs to the sauce.  The Meatballs were flavorful, and the sauce was good, I added more cinnamon than called for and won't be doing that again.  Very good one stop recipe that will please.
