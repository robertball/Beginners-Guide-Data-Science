I did this with brown rice and frozen cauliflower and it came out really nice. With the brown rice you need a bit more water and the cook time is longer.

I used broccoli instead of the cauliflower, and no meat.  The flavors go well together.  To save time, I roasted the broccoli while the rice, onions, and spices were cooking, so I served the broccoli on top of the rice.  This was somewhat colorful.  Now, I can't wait to try it with cauliflower!

Just made this according to the recipe and everyone in the family liked it. I was worried when I did a "taste test" of the water with spices added, thinking it would be too spicy, but when added to the meat, cauliflower, and rice it comes out just fine.  I might even increase the curry powder a little next time.

I was kind of disappointed in this recipe.  After reading reviews, I doubled up most of the spices, but it still tasted bland.  I also needed to add more water, because the rice didn't fully cook and then burned on the bottom of the pan.  It was okay, but not something I would make again.

As written, I'd probably give this recipe 3 stars... I'm not sure. I followed the directions, however I made this change:

I make curries a lot, and the idea of just adding curry powder/spices to water seemed like madness to me. I also wanted to double the spices, so I decided to split the difference. I put half of my spices into the beef/onion mixture when the beef was mostly cooked to fry the spices (the way I'm used to preparing curry spices), and I added half of the spices to the boiling water, as the recipe suggests. Basically I followed the recipe exactly, but fried another batch of the spices with the beef. I also stirred the rice around in the fried curry/onion/beef oils on gentle heat before adding the water. This came out deliciously!

Oh, and be careful to set your heat fairly low during the rice-cooking part of the process (On my stove I set it at about 3.5/10). It will still simmer with lower heat, but if you don't put the heat pretty low and stir occasionally it will probably burn on the bottom.

Overall this recipe was pretty good, I loved being able to combine the cauliflower, beef and rice with a curried flavor.  I halved the recipe and I don't know if that made the difference or not but it lacked the full flavor I was expecting.  I will make this again but I think I will double most of the spices (especially the curry and tumeric!).  I would also like to try this without the meat too - it would make a great vegetarian dish!

I tripled the spices as others indicated. It was perfect. I also used chicken broth instead of water and wild rice instead of white. With the wild rice, it needed to cook about 40 mins. Not aesthetically pleasing but delicious.

Double or triple the spices! It has as much taste as water when you follow the recipe. I used a bag of cauliflower and  a bag of broccoli to make it healthier. Worked fine with brown rice. Not sure I’ll make it again.

Outstanding flavors!  My somewhat picky teen loved this too!  Only change I made was to add fresh corn and top dish with a sprinkle of minced parsley to add color.  Otherwise perfect as is!

As far as easy dinners, this ranks up there.  As suggested by previous reviewers, I doubled the spices and used beef broth instead of water.  Also, recipe doesn't specify so I used Jasmine rice and it only took 22 minutes to cook.

In the future, I will not double the black pepper and cut the rice/liquid amount in half.  It just got to be a huge  amount of food.  We are a family of four with two teenagers and we still had quite a bit left over.  To simplify, I also might par cook the cauliflower in the microwave rather than spending the time to roast it in the oven.

I made a few changes. Reviewers said it was bland, so I doubled the seasonings (except the salt.) I also seasoned the cauliflower with salt and garam marsala. It definitely was not a bland dish!  I also subbed more curry powder for the turmeric and used a mix of black pepper and garam marsala because I ran out of pepper.

I cooked the garlic in with the meat & onion. And drained the meat, although I don't think the recipe said to do that. I also used minute rice, so the time was fine.

I also used brown rice, cooked according to its directions, and no meat for a meatless Monday meal. I also didn't flip it out on to a dish, just scooped from the pot. It makes a ton! We had so much leftovers, it is very filling and flavorful.  I'll make this again, but with half the rice.

Overall a good hearty meal and not spicy. Since I was cooking for 5, I used 2 cauliflower heads and added an extra cup of rice. Everyone ate it up! Next time I think I will roast the cauliflower at 375* to get them cooked a little more as well as add a little more of the spices to boost the flavor, but I will be making this again if my family has anything to say about it!

After reading other reviews about blandness, I TRIPLED the spices (including salt) and used 2 cups beef broth to replace 2 cups of the water. It still came out slightly bland (a little more salt brought out the spice flavors though). Other than that, it's delicious! 

I also began cooking the rice in the boiling water about 5 min before adding it to the beef mixture and at the same time I tossed in some diced carrots I had laying around... yum yum :) Rice, carrots, cauliflower all came out cooked perfectly.

I was looking to use the cauliflower and ground turkey I had on hand and I generally like food that is served in a pile format so I tried this. Since I was using brown rice, I started cooking that first and added the other stuff later. This didn't work very well so I would stick with the instructions on that next time. I cooked the cauliflower in the microwave which was fast, but not very flavorful.

I found it pretty bland overall but it was improved later with aged cheddar, Vege-Sal, and pepper or lemon pepper.

I made this last night with only two changes.  I omitted the tumeric, as I had none, and I prepared the cauliflower as written but cooked it in the microwave instead of the oven to save time (mine cooked it in about 9 minutes).  I agree with other reviewers who say it is a bit bland, but I would still make this again with a few adaptations (and adding the tumeric!).

This was very easy to make, made a lot, and was good.  I wouldn't call it spectacular but ground beef and rice with cauliflower it can only be so good.  It was a little bland but still very flavorful. I think this is something kids could really go for. Sort of comfort food.
