Very good and good for you. I substituted buttermilk for skim (its extrememely low in fat and very rich tasting). I cooked my first one 45 min and it was too long,  made it dry. I cooked the second one approx. 40 min and it made a big difference, I also loosely covered the top with foil the last 10 min.

So maybe I'm jumping the gun a little since I haven't even pulled this loaf out of the oven yet, but the batter/dough tasted so good, it is rising so beautifully (better than any bread I've made recently), and has the most delightful color. I had to substitute 1 T milled flax seed + 3 T water for the egg because I ran out yesterday and haven't been able to get through the snow to the store yet. I also used 1 2/3 c whole wheat flour + 1/3 c unbleached all-purpose flour because I didn't have any pastry flour. I can't wait to taste this!

This recipe is great- I happened to find maple yogurt at Whole Foods, so I used it! This is healthy & low cal. And surprisingly very moist! Reminds me a bit of gingerbread. All my quick bread recipes need to have foil on the top the last half of the baking time to prevent over-browning. No exception here. Thanks for submitting!

This is easy to make, satisfying, and has a good texture.  However, it is just a little shy on taste.  I'd add more maple syrup or cinnamon.  A little cinnamon sugar on top would be perfect.  I used fat free vanilla yogurt for sweetness, two egg whites, and skim milk to cut calories.  FYI, the juice of one lemon is 2 -3 tablespoons.  Thanks for the tip about putting foil on top.  Definitely test the bread before fifty minutes.

Wow I was surprised how amazing this recipe was with whole wheat flour.  I made them into muffins instead of loaf pans.  Kids ate them up!

i love this bread! i ate like half a loaf in a day! i made this even lower calorie than it all ready is: i substituted splenda for the sugar, egg substitute, skim milk, and just a bit of syrup for the taste. this was awesome! so moist, and crusty if you bake it a bit longer.

This recipe does not need any modifications to make it "light" or "low fat". It is already a healthy  bread and if you use sugar free maple syrup..... of course it is going to be bland. The maple syrup is what gives it flavor.

I love how this comes out so moist! especially for a whole wheat bread. the other plus- my kids really like this bread better than a lot of whole grain breads I make. the minuses- a bit shy on taste, and it seems to have a weird smell to it . I'm not sure what gives it that smell- the yogurt? I've tried this a few different times- once like the recipe says and later with different variations to try to get rid of the smell. Once I decreased the milk to 1/4 cup, added 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree and double the cinnamon for more taste, also I've tried using vanilla soymilk in place of the milk. Neither seemed to help. I do LOVE how the consistancy of the bread turns out so I will continue to play with this recipe and find something that works- maybe change out the yogurt for applesauce? not sure. Definately is better with added something like pumpkin, zucchini, carrots, raisins, etc.

I followed all the directions, but I found it bland (despite increasing the spices). I wish I hadn't wasted expensive syrup. I won't make this again.

To skinny down the recipe as much as I can, I used non-fat vanilla yogurt, skim milk and sugerless syrup with maple flavour. It smelt amazing, but tasted bland. I had it in the oven for 35 mins, it was more than enough. 30 mins seems more like it. Oh well, I will smother it maple syrup when I have it for breakfast.

This bread was easy and very delicious!  It was moist and flavorful.  I added 2/3 cup of chopped dates and it was a great tea bread.  I'll make this again!

Not too sweet. Cooked perfectly. Top burnt a bit so I need to remember foil at end. Added pecans. Will try dates or cranberries in future. Great for breakfast.

After reading all the reviews I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.  I made it in a cake pan and baked for 25min.  It is delicious!

Good taste and texture. I substituted 2/3 C. wheat flour and 1/3 C. white all-pourpose flour in addition I added 1T of wheat germ. I didn't have maple syrup so I used molases in equal amount instead. I also didn't have plain yougart so I used vanilla yougart. I used 3 tsp lemon juice instead of fresh.

Absolutely amazing. Moist and flavorful. Delicoius warm. I made a few changes though: 1. Upped the milk to 1/2 a cup  2. Used splenda instead of syrup  3. Baked for 40 minutes, the last 10 foil covered. 4. Doubled the cinnamon, left out the nutmeg. This is some of the best bread I've had in a long time. I'm eating my second slice now.

This bread was just so-so for us.  I read the other reviews that you could barely taste the maple, so I added a tsp. of maple extract in addition to the syrup, and the maple flavoring was still just ok at best.  I think if I had not expected this to be a sweet bread, I would have liked it more, but for some reason the "Maple" in the name led me to imagine a banana bread-like sweet bread, not a plain, hint-of-maple loaf.  I hate to add sugar where it's not called for, but I felt like this bread needed it.  It was still ok, and we still ate it for breakfasts, but I probably won't make it again.  I also only had plain ol' fake syrup (not the real stuff), and imitation maple flavoring, so that might have had something to do with it.

This was a very good, quick and simple recipe.  I omitted the lemon and added about 2 tbsp. extra maple syrup.  I also used vanilla flavored yogurt and used cinnamon plus pumpkin pie seasoning for extra taste.  It was finished cooking about 5 minutes early so be sure to check it before the 50 minutes.  I put a few dollops of butter on top after it came out of the oven and sprinkled with raw sugar.  My company loved it and I will definitely make it again.

This was alright. I used vanilla yogurt and upped the maply syrup by 1/4 cup because I love maple flavor and sweeter breads. The flavor was OK, but the texture was a little dry and crumbly.

This bread was quick and easy to make, and fairly tasty, but not excellent. I used 1/2 low fat vanilla yogurt & 1/2 plain, since that is what I had. I decreased the baking time to 40 minutes and that was plenty. I was expecting it to be sweeter like most quick breads, esp with all that maple syrup, but it was only mildly sweet. Nice texture, however.

This was very good! I agree with another poster that the bake time needs decreasing. I set my timer for 40min and that was too long. Very good and healthy though.

Very good recipe. Made some slight variations as I did not have all the exact ingredients. Used berry oh my yog cup of yogurt. And soy milk. I also added a cinnamon brown sugar swirl and topping and some bittersweet chocolate chips. Baked for about 45 minutes 
Delicious! Just moist enough to add some PB, jelly or both

There was no taste to it. Not sure if i didn't put enough syrup in it or not, but it should've had brown sugar in it. Butter makes it taste it better.

This bread just didn't do it for me; if eaten alone it was too dry and not sweet enough, but when combined with jam it was too sweet.

I made this bread tonight and I am kind of on the fence as to whether I would make it again.  Its very plain and would be great as a breakfast bread with some natural nut butter.  I used almon milk, fat free plain greek yogurt, 2 egg whites, 1/2 cup agave nectar, and I added 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract.  The bread came out pretty dense and very chewy in the center.  Next time I may try experimenting by using pumpkin puree or applesauce.

I don't know. Maybe I did something wrong. the flavor was just ok but it was weird. after it had already risen and was half done in the oven it sprung a leek and started dripping batter all over my oven. it was very weird. when it was finally done the texture was also weird.

Very nice soft textured whole wheat bread.  I substitued 1 cup of Splenda instead of the maple syrup.  For cinnamon raisin bread I increased the cin to 1 tsp and added about a 1/2 c of raisins.  Very good!
