I made this for a party/meeting and they were a hit.  Everyone loved them.  I will definitely make them again. I did make sure to use a cloth-type pastry bag and it worked great.  I had to pinch each one off into the oil as they didn't just break off, which was totally fine.  They did cook pretty fast, so I was getting behind on coating them with the cinnamon/sugar. So, I figured out a quick (and much easier) way to do it. I would scoop them out of the oil with a large flat slotted spoon onto paper towels just long enough to put the next batch into the skillet.  I would then dump the hot churros into a ziploc bag with the cinnamon and sugar, shake it up and then just took them out with my hands and placed them on the serving plate. That worked great and they were perfectly coated.

This is a very good recipe. Hint: Only beat the eggs enough to blend in, otherwise it will make the texture too doughy.

At 7pm my son told me he needed churros for his Spanish class the next day.  Once the recipe was prepared, frying and rolling-in-the cinnamon was quick.  These tasted soooo good.  Lots of raves from his Spanish class and teacher.  I lived in L.A. and I can tell you, these taste great!

I didn't have a pastry cloth or a deep fryer but I made do. Take a ziploc bag and cut a hole in the bottom and squeeze out the dough. For the frying, just use a huge pan and put in a ton of oil. 
My only problems were how quickly they cooked. I had to call into my boyfriend to help me remove the oil and coat them, there was no time for one person!  Also, they looked kinda like big pieces of poo. Mind you they tasted delicious so who cares how they look?

I would not recommend this recipe at all. The dough you end up creating is very plain and the only flavouring at all comes from the cinnamon and sugar.  Really a very tasteless dessert that is not worth the effort

yum yum yum!!! These were great and my kids loved them. They are very easy to make, just make sure the oil is verry hot. When putting the mixture into the oil I used a pair of scissors to cut the right lenght. Also using a ziplock beg is a good idea but make sure they have cooled enough or they will melt the bag.

These were GREAT! I followed the advice to cut down to 2 eggs and added vanilla! Was a huge hit! I doubled the suger and cinnimon and added into a bowl and my 4 year old would coat them while i fried them! I read some review's where it says is alot of work and trouble,I disagree completely. We will be doing this again!

Delicious and so easy to make. Didn't have a pastry bag so I used a ziplock bag and cut a star shape out of the corner. works just as well.

I thought it was too messy for kids to help with, almost too messy for myself. To doughy after cooking. :(

Excellent!  Made these for our Seis de  Mayo party and they were a bit hit!  Used a cake decorating tube with the star tip and they came out thin enough so that they cooked faster without getting greasy.  Cut the eggs down to two, added a tsp. of vanilla to the water and a dash of cinnamon to the flour.  Will definitely make again!

these turned out fantastic! i tried another recipe for churros, and the dough was so thick i couldn't pipe it through a pastry bag. it also ended up still doughy in the center. but this recipe made a great consistency for piping, and the end results were crisp on the outside, but light on the inside. delicious!

These churros are melt in your mouth, unlike the typical heavy and dense churros served in restaurants.  Other recipes refer to these as "Angel Churros". The dough is similiar to the dough used for cream puffs. Be sure that the oil is hot enough but not too hot. If it is not hot enough, your churros will be overly oily; if it is too hot the outsides of the churro will brown far too quickly and before the inside of the churro has completed cooking. I am not sure why the recipe states that it takes 2 hours and 40 minutes for the churros to be completed. When I make them they are completed in no more then an hour.  So it is a quicker recipe then it states. Follow the recipe as stated and you'll have the most heavenly churros. Yummy!!!

These were delicious!  My boys love churros and they said that these were awesome.  I enjoyed them as well.  The only changes I made were using butter and adding 1 tsp of vanilla to the water.  I used a ziploc freezer bag with a star tip.  I accidentally touched the bag to the pan, so it melted a hole in my bag.  I ended up closing up my star tip and using the hole to pipe through.  Worked fine.  My star tip, wilton #30 seemed too small anywaya.  I will probably look for a bigger one and make this again since it was such a hit.  I am so glad I tried this recipe and not the one without eggs.  Thank you for the recipe!

Pretty good recipe. Very easy to make and not messy at all. I only used 2 eggs based off the reviews and suggestions of others that 3 makes the Churros too eggy. My only draw back was that I cut the hole in the bag too big making the Churros way too thick and they didn't cook all the way through. Next time I will do a much smaller hole or make them disk like shapes. We had them with vanilla ice cream and honey.

SOOO GOOD! I have to say, I was afraid and I had very little expectation of this coming out good because Churros are pretty amazing and I didnt think it could be this easy! But it was!! I used butter in place of the margarine and added a little vanilla extract to the batter. I used a disposable pastry bag with a Wilton Star tip #32. Everyone LOVED them. We dont eat fried foods often but Ill definitely make these again!

These were tasty when you coat 'em w/ EXTRA cinnamon sugar mixture.  They are eggy churros-crispy & golden w/ a soft center.  Like a previous reviewer said, these would sugar coat better in a ziploc bag.  Next time I'll add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tblsp in the dough for extra flavor.  Make sure you remove the dough off the heat & let it cool down before you add the eggs or else you'll get scrambled eggs-yikes!  Almost happened to me.  Other than that, these churros are easy to make & very nice with hot chocolate or coffee.

This recipe is an absolute hit! I loved them!! I did add a little touch to mine though. I added about a tbls & 1/2 to the mix along with about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. They turned out wondersully. I also dipped them in a mix of powdered sugar and cinnamon. They were great!

I just put the dough into a ziploc bag and snipped a 1/2" hole on the corner of the bag and these little churros ended up looking like big american donuts...  good anyway.

served this along with a Spanish presentation for my 9 yr old daughter's class, It was an immediate hit. All gone with in a half hour. We took 12 dozen and that wasn't near enough. They are pretty easy to make and it was fun making them together.

Fantastic!!! My family and friends who were visiting couldn't get enough!!! I made 2 changes ( I added 1 t vanilla when boiling the water, and added 1 egg after mixing in the flour), which only added to the flavor!!! I made a single batch first just to make sure my everyone would like them, then ended up making 2 more double batches!!....sheesh!! :)  I would absolutely recommend to not make more than a double batch at a time as the dough completely filled up my Wilton bag and would not have fit a 3rd batch in there........FANTASTIC and YUMMY!!! Thank you for sharing! :)

Made these for the first time.  I don't think I had ever had one before so don't really have a comparison.  GS, who is Mexican, asked me to make them, so I did.  I used a cake-decorating tip & a zip-lock bag...didn't work so just cut off blobs into the hot oil.  He wasn't happy about the shape (everybody is a critic, LOL) but said they tasted great.  SO loved them, too.  Next time, I will add a little vanilla & a pinch of nutmeg to the batter.

Easy recipe. At first, tried a pastry bag (disposable), but it broke. My sister pulled out the "Super Shooter" (used to make spritz cookies). Made it a lot easier to make them. Didn't bother coating with cinnamon and sugar til they were all fried. Seemed to work just fine.

I just baked these, and they turned out pretty well! the only thing I did differently was turn down the heat of the oil and cooked them slower, I found in doing this that they cooked much more evenly instead of being over done on the outside and softer on the inside! good recipe! :)

I thought the flavor was good but the consistency was not the bestthe churros were very doughy and not good at all. I will not be trying this recipe again.

I made these twice because the first time, the churros did not come out right after i fried them. The second time I did a few things different. I made sure to remove the ball of dough into a mixing bowl before I added the eggs. Also, instead of frying them, I maked them at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes each. They came out nice and fluffy. The taste was good, but I couldn't give it a five star since it wasn't 'to die for'.  But overall still a very tasty recipe.

These were fun to make and turned out OK.  I didn't find it too stressful... like another reviewer, I placed my hot, fried churros in a plastic bag with the cinnamon/sugar mixture and just coated them by shaking the bag.  The dough was a bit eggy for my tastes but my husband and boys all enjoyed the recipe.

I had no idea that home-made churros would be so easy! I didn't have a pastry bag or anything, so I decided to just plop some batter into the frying pan - in spoonfuls. They were little nuggets, but fried wonderfully. I used one reviewer's suggestion of putting them in a large plastic bag with the cinnamon/sugar and shake them - it worked perfect. Everyone at my party loved them.

This tastes wonderful and easy item to make with my 12 yr old son. Needed a quicky for geography class(Mexico study). Just as an fyi if you added 1 more egg you have a basic recipe for cream puff pastry!  Who knew??

These were yummy and very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have a pastry bag so I formed the rolls by hand and they still turned out.

This is amazing! So tasty and my sisters loved it so much!! I didn’t really use a piping tool. You can also use a ziplock bag too. They still taste amazing either way! And plus. It’s my first time trying churros and they were delicious!

So easy!  Only used one egg per other reviews, and added in a 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to combat the comments that said the dough was flavourless.   Also- it does not take 2h 40min to masks this.  From prep to sugaring and placing on a cooling rack- it took 30 minutes almost exactly.   Will definitely be making this one again!

I LOVE CHURROS!!!! This recipe is a keeper! It was my first time making them ever, and they came out perfect!!! I'd upload a picture but my camera wasn't working.?? Any way I only added 2 eggs and 2 tsp. of vanilla. And I made bite size churros  so my little sister could eat them ( personally I liked them way more than the average size) my 17year old sister couldn't stop eating them! Every time I turned around they were gone! I think that the bite size are great for the little ones you should give them a try!!!

These were very easy to make and turned out very light.  Almost melted in your mouth.  However, I prefer authentic churros which are denser and chewier.

I made this gluten free using the America's Test Kitchen gluten free flour blend.  Instead of beating the eggs in one at a time, I beat the eggs together and then poured them in in stages because I was afraid that the heat of the pan would cook the egg too quickly because I don't break eggs so fast.  They turned out great even though I just used a ziploc bag with the corner cut off!

This recipe is way better than Rick Bayless'churros recipe that doesn't call for eggs and butter.  It had a big difference with the taste, color, texture, and esp. with time and effort.  This recipe is super easy to make and so easy to pipe - very tasty too. It was very crunchy on the outside and is doughy in the middle which is perfect.  It was a big hit! I used a star tip no.22.  I could use a bigger one next time. You could either sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar right after taking the churros out of the pot or just drain in the paper towel and dip in the melted chocolate later on.
