Great easy dinner.  I was cleaning out the pantry, so I added potatoes and baked them with the Brussel sprouts for the first 15 minutes.  Then I found a red pepper in the fridge, and I added 3 garlic cloves as well for the second 15 minutes with the Kielbasa.  Very good!

This was excellent! This was the perfect meal to prepare after a long day at work. Super simple, not a lot of fuss, and the smoked paprika really came though.

I had to make do with what I had: Italian sausage, plain paprika, brussel sprouts and half an onion; I read the reviews saying they nearly burned their dinner, so I set my oven to 375. Turned the food at 15, then again at 15 and 10 extra minutes, for a total of 40 minutes in the oven. Fa-bu-lous.

So easy and delicious! I added 2 diced potatoes and about 1/2 C diced onions with the brussel sprouts, to make it a one-dish meal.  My husband really liked it - this will be on our regular menu rotation

The only reason I didnâ€™t give 5 stars is because I thought it was better with more stuff!
I added onions when I baked the Brussel sprouts, and then also yellow squash and red and yellow bell peppers for when the sausage was added! Soooo good.
Will make again for sure!

I was really surprised when I the first brussel sprourt.  I don't like them, but my husband loves them so I tried this recipe.  The sprout didn't taste like a sprout anymore.  I will make this recipe again for sure.  It did get really burnt looking but it tasted a bit like a potato....anyway, it is worth cooking again.  Thanks

I made this and really liked it. The only thing I changed was that I added Balsamic vinegar. Made the recipe pop with more flavor.

This is one of my go to recipes. I ended up substituting smoked sausage for the kielbasa. My 7 year old daughter calls this her second favorite meal.

great easy dinner! I used a smoked beef sausage instead of kielbasa (my grocery was out) and I added garlic powder to the Brussels sprouts mix and a few teaspoons of minced garlic to the sausage. I also added more Olive oil on the Brussels sprouts once on the pan and they didnt burn. served over pearls cous cous and it was amazing!

so easy and tasty. like others mentioned, sprouts were done and leaves crispy at 15, so I just covered them with foil but kept them on the sheet while baking the kielbasa. turned out great! served with sauerkraut and sliced steamed carrots (no carb night). in the rotation for sure!

It was good, seemed to be missing something.My sprouts turned out REALLY roasted. By the time I used the full time, they were a little burnt.  Nice to try, but I have a skillet recipe that uses bacon that is better.

The cook time on the Brussels sprouts could be reduced to 10 minutes - mine got charred.  Otherwise, easy to make.

Giving this 5 stars because it is so easy and tasty. Used turkey kielbasa. It was a hit, not even a word about having to eat brussel sprouts.

I would cut the cook time down by 1/2 or 3/4. I would also use less paprika. Other than that it was really easy and tasty.

Such an easy meal to prepare in the Motorhome! I also added onions and garlic because we're those kind of folks. Suggest you use small sprouts.

Nice change with the Brussels sprouts, but the roasting time is way off. Sprouts were perfect in appearance after the first 13 minutes, same with the kielbasa. To keep from burning, I nuked in the microwave for a minute or two once combined. Finally, cut a ton of fat and calories and used turkey kielbasa. Honestly, not impressed. If roasting is the signature aspect of a recipe. I could have easily ended up with a totally burned dinner.

I made this for my daughter and me. The only thing I had trouble with was keeping the brussel sprouts from burning. I had my oven on the right temp that the recipe suggested but it was causing my brussel sprouts to burn so I turn the oven down to 375 degrees when I added the kielbasa and covered the side of the brussels where on. 
Other than that, it was delicious and my daughter loved it; which was a plus!!

This was delicious!  I didn't want to stop eating it!  Hubby loved it, too, teenage girl was so-so.  I did add some cut up red potatoes with the sprouts, as another person mentioned, and some yellow peppers with the sausage.  I did a pan of keilbasa, but also a pan of turkey smoked sausage as a little healthier option for me.  I did have to adjust the amount of seasoning a bit because I was adding a bit more than the recipe called for, and I might have added a tad too much smoked paprika. But hubby thought it was perfect for him.  Flavor was so good and this delicious combo made a complete, and talk about easy, meal!  Will definitely by a regular at my house.  Thank you!

A great meal. Even my children enjoyed it. My husband was skeptical because he only likes brussels sprouts in bacon but I officially converted him into loving them baked! Great meal and so easy to make and clean up. A Winner in our book.

So tasty and simple to make.  I added potatoes because they looked good in the photo. I cut up two red potatoes.  I cooked the sprouts and taters for 20 minutes then added the sausage for another 20 . Crisp and delicious!

Turned the  sprouts when I added the sausage. Turned out great just the right amount of crispiness and seasoning.
My wife loved it

Doubled the sausage, reduced to 1 lb of Brussel sprouts and added boiled former yellow potatoes. Turned out wonderfully. Definitely making this one again.
