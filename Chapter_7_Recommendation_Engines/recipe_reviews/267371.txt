So simple to make! I figured the peanut butter would overwhelm the chocolate and so I elected to use chocolate almond milk. Talk about a sweet treat! It’s peanut butter and chocolate- what’s not to love?! I almost couldn’t find the peanut butter syrup, but I got lucky and bought the last bottle of torani sf peanut butter syrup at a local kitchen store! It really does give it more of a peanut butter flavor!

9.1.18  It’s hard to go wrong with a combination like chocolate and peanut butter.  The peanut butter is the first pop of flavor that you get, then the milk chocolate kicks in, more in the background. I like my smoothies on the thicker side, so I did add more ice.   I had peanut butter powder on hand, but the peanut butter syrup was a tough find in my area, and I had to settle on one that was not sugar free.   I drink a lot of smoothies, and I did give this a drizzle of chocolate syrup just to be a bit indulgent.
