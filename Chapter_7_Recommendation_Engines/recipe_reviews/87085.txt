PLEASE READ this before making this recipe! The good news is that these burgers can be fantastic – possibly the best ever; the bad news is that following the recipe as written won’t get you there. The ingredients are great, but the amounts and methods will probably disappoint. The meat is too highly seasoned and oniony as written (at least for me). Double your ground beef or halve the seasonings and it will be fabulous. The “sauce” doesn’t really work for a burger, especially as written, unless you want to eat soggy bread and meat with a spoon. You will want to reduce the “sauce” WAY  down to a glaze that grabs the veggies and will stay on top of your burger. I also added more mushrooms (since I doubled the meat and made 4 HUGE burgers, I also increased the bacon, fontina and shrooms – plenty of onion already.) These are big, fat burgers that are tricky to get done on the grill. I cooked them for about 5 minutes per side on the grill and then finished them, covered, in a 350 oven (about 10-15 minutes longer). I thought the blue cheese would be overkill, but I ended up adding it on top of my mushrooms anyway and it was awesome. I would encourage anyone to try this combination of ingredients – the recipe submitter has a GREAT idea that she has probably made with success many times and was simply unable to translate it well into writing (I’ve been there). I'm sorry to be giving a low-ish rating for the first review - and I hope people will try this in spite of it. Thanks! :)
