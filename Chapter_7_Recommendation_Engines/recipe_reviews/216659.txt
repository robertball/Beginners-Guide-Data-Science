I made these with semi-sweet chocolate chips and strawberries.  I fried half and baked half.  My son thought the baked were better than fried.  Before I baked them I sprayed both sides with cooking spray.  I put them under the broiler for about a minute on each side.  This is definitely a make again recipe.

My kids are crazy for this recipe. So far I've tried strawberries and banana and both are perfect. Next time, I'm going to try baking instead of frying. I'll let you know. In the meantime thanks for a great snack.

Home run, Ricci!   I used dark choc chips with cherry pie filling, and also just cherry pie filling!  Little bitty, uber awesome bites of cherry loveliness!
Lends itself to a multitude of fillings!

I made this and added a slice of banana with the strawberry. I also tried some of them with semi sweet chocolate chips because my daughter prefers semi sweet over milk chocolate. They were very tasty. We also shaped them like small pouches. We will make these again.

These were so easy and delicious! My husband and I really enjoyed them with raspberries. They were a lot easier to seal that way too.

My GOSH! YUM. sooo delicious. An easy and simple recipe. I found it easier after about the 4th wonton, to chop the remaining strawberries and toss over the chocolate chips. What a versatile recipe for sure. Reese's Butter Chips and chopped strawberries is the BOMB!! Will totally make again and again. Thank you sooo much!

Fabtastic, simple, love them.  We decided the next time to use mini chips because it might make wrapping these easier.  Also want to try with apple & cinnamon or just apple pie filling would probably work ok.

Wow, what a great way to use up leftover wonton wrappers and fruit! I first wet all 4 sides of each wrapper, swiped Nutella in the middle, centered a slice of strawberry and banana plus 3 semi-sweet chocolate chips in the middle before closing each piece and broiling.  Great for breakfast.  I just broiled them again to heat right before serving. Will definitely make them again.  Funny thing is that the original reason I even got the wonton wrappers was for a wonton soup that didn't get as good response from the kids.  Looks like I might be getting wonton wrappers for this recipe instead!  Also would work with other berries/fruit, nuts, spreads, croissant dough!

I made these for a Chinese New Year party a friend was hosting.  One of the guests (who didn't know I had made them) came up to me outside and said, "Did you try those things with the chocolate and strawberries?  They're amazing!"  Best party food compliment ever.  Easy to make and my kids enjoyed helping.  Be careful not to get the oil too hot which will overbrown your wontons.  Acheiving 350 degrees for your oil takes a setting of about 4.0 (medium-low) on my 1.0-9.0 burner. A candy thermometer is helpful if you don't have a "fry-daddy", etc. The flavor is best if they're just lightly browned. The prep time may be under-estimated here, also.  Like other reviewers, I prefer the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  And do serve warm, when the middle is still gooey!  Thanks, Ricci, for sharing this terrific recipe!

I loved how super easy this was to make! Even more, I loved how tasty these turned out! I wasn’t very confident about my wanton-wrapping skills and afraid that the melted chocolate would spill while being fried. What I did was wrap it spring roll style... and they were great! I used milk chocolate chips and fresh peaches, rolled them into the wanton wrappers and fried them as instructed. My mini chocolate spring rolls were polished off in no time.

very good.  made them with strawberries and bittersweet chips.  would love to try them with bananas and even the nutella.  didn't have any powdered sugar and so used a cinnamon/sugar mixture, which was yummy.  will try the spraying and baking method next time for a lighter taste

These are great for Valentine's!  I have fried and baked them - both ways are great.  I've also tried raspberries in place of the strawberries which was delicious.  Excellent served with vanilla ice cream.

I liked these more than my family - but maybe just because I love chocolate so much...... I have to admit I didn't think they were fabulous, but I liked them.....  My family did not care for these *at all*!

I thought these were ok, but my kids went bonkers for them.
