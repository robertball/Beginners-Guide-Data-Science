Simply.... DISGUSTING.... I had my friends over for dinner that night and I thought, hmmm sounds good! but I got a NASTY surprise. It had close to no flavor what-so-ever. I don't advise any one to try this recipe.

This was definately something different to try.  It tasted great which surprised me because I thought the chips might get too soggy while baking up in the over with all the tomatoes on top.  We will definately make this dish again! Oh don't forget to serve this with some sour cream on top!  Can't leave out the sour cream!

This dish is sooo good! I can't imagine how anyone could find this tasteless! I decided to give it a try, since it only got one review. I changed the recipe a bit, using ground sausage for the meat.
I'm pleased to say this turned out perfect, especially with the jalapenos, which add the perfect kick. Like a huge plate of nachos, loaded with flavor. This recipe is extremely versatile, and I'll definitely make this dish again!

This was pretty good! I used ground venison that has sausage in it and didn't have any jalepenos. The flavor was good and it was easy to prepare but it turned out way too salty for our taste.So I guess I will have to experiment with a different tortilla chip and try steak strips next time. And there will be a next time. Thanks!

I made this with a cheaper cut of beef that I sliced paper thin while still a little bit frozen, and I used a combination of Monterey Jack and Mexican cheeses. Turned out pretty good - nothing too fancy, but tasty and filling. Thanks!

My kids loved this.  You need to salt and pepper the steak, though, to give it more flavor.  Optional add ons would be sliced avocado, salsa, sour cream.

I improvised with what I had on hand and it turned out delicious.  I used ground turkey, browned with taco seasoning.  I used canned tomatoes seasoned for chili, and also undrained chili beans.  I served with sour cream and lettuce on top, with a side of cornbread.  This will become part of my recipe rotation list.
