I like Honey Mustard dressing and I loved how easy this one was to prepare...I'm sorry to disagree with the other reviewer who said this wasn't flavorful because I thought it had a lot of  flavor.  Maybe it depends on the mustard you use and the fact that I used celery salt instead of seed. I enjoyed it with salad of iceberg lettuce, shredded carrot and hard boiled egg.  But the "appetizer" of pretzels dipped in the dressing wasn't bad either!

With this dressing, even David is eating salad. Would probably 1/2 the recipe next time - makes too much for 2 people. To use dressing up, poured over spinach ravioli as a sauce then sprinkled with paprika. Delicious!

1 Minute Masterpiece!  I mixed whole milk organic yogurt with country dijon and added honey.  I think the whole milk yogurt did it--whole milk yogurt is delicious because it has more fat (14%DV). I was pleasantly surprised.

I used non-fat plain yogurt, raw honey, yellow mustard and 3/4 tsp. sea salt. It needed the salt. Adding salt does not make it salty.

I think this was good - I will probably add a little more mustard for a better kick - twas a bit too sweet. I LOVE honey mustard for dipping chicken - thought this one would be good and much less fattening using yogurt instead of mayo. The only problem I have is it gets so watery - is it the yogurt I'm using?? Are there any suggestions for a low cal better yogurt to use that doesn't get watery?

This dressing is alright if you add some onion powder, garlic powder and a generous splash of hot sauce. Definitely needs to sit awhile so the flavours meld. I also added a splash of cider vinegar. Not sure I'd make it again though.

I made this dressing with "Chobani" plain yogurt, spicy mustard, raw honey and celery salt. This is my new favorite dressing to put on my salads. It sweet but not to sweet and is a little spicy and makes the perfect mixture.

I love this dressing and make it regularly. I add sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and a splash of brown rice vinegar. It's delicious! Sometimes I even reduce the ratio of mustard for my husband who is not a mustard fan, and it is still a delicious creamy dressing that's healthy and easy enough for a weeknight salad.

This made for a good, but not very flavorful dressing.  I added a little cider vinegar and onion powder and this helped.  I liked it, but my husband said he found it a little too sweet with a bitter after taste.

Thank you for the recipe, Don.  I felt the dressing was a little too sweet for my taste so I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to have some acidic balance.  I didn’t have any celery seed so I used finely chopped celery leaves; about 2 tablespoons, some freshly ground coriander; about ¼ teaspoon, and a pinch of sea salt.  This dressing tasted fantastic on a salad of fresh sprouts!

My doctor told me my triglycerides were so high he could spread me on toast.  Although I want to lose that status, I am phobic of bad taste.  This dressing was on par with any oil dressing out there.  My wife did not like the celery seed but rather than not like she was trying to figure out what to sub for it.

i thought this was good.  I did not have plain yogurt so I used vanilla yogurt and reduced the honey in half.  I omitted celery seed and added poppy seeds.  I used whole grain organic mustard.

The most important thing is to stay on formula.  It is a solid 5 when directions are followed.   Simple, easy, good for you, and absolutely great.   There is a rather apparent correlation with going off of formula and less satisfied ratings with results. DO THIS!  Chobani plain nonfat yogurt which is simply yogurt and nonfat milk.  Clover honey, Grey Poupon Dijon mustard and celery seed.  PERFECT!

Just what I was looking for...a fresh, non-bottled dressing. Perfect for a leafy salad with fruit and feta cheese.

I suppose it definitely depends on the mustard. I tried to use part sweet spicy one part coarse deli and it was still way too sweet. I ended up adding a splash of cider vinegar, several shakes of onion powder, garlic powder, crushed garlic and finally a little yellow mustard and even a good bit of hot sauce before I was satisfied.

this was okay.. but not exactly what i was hoping for.. i cut the recipe in half.. subbed 2% fat greek yogurt for the plain and cut the honey down to 1.5 T.. i felt it was missing something so i added a T of cider vinegar and some salt.. i let this sit for about 3 hours and tried it over some shredded cabbage and carrot.. still missing something.. i squirted some lime.. tried adding some garlic salt (with dried parsley in it).. but finally gave up and added some chopped cilantro.. it gets 3 stars bc bf said he liked it

This is my go-to recipe for honey mustard dressing. The only change I make is using celery salt to taste, instead of celery seed. I use plain Aldi yogurt, rather than Greek, and it turns out great. Delicious as a replacement for mayonnaise on a turkey sandwich piled high with homegrown baby salad greens!

Delicious! Needed a clean recipe and happened to have all the ingredients available. Just make sure to season with salt! Used Plain Greek yogurt,  and we cut the recipe in half since we didn't need too much dressing, added a bit of salt and it turned out great!!

This was very good, but my family preferred a little more mustard and a bit less honey.  We used Grey Poupon, and probably doubled the amount of mustard.

Exactly what I was looking for. Used non-fat Greek yogurt (to get that thick consistency ) Dijon and agave nectar. Amazingly flavorful, and fat free! (Didn't put any celery seed in it) finally a good vinegrette alternative! (Used on leftover BBQ chicken in a salad)

This was good, but I added more honey than it called for because I wanted it a little sweeter.
