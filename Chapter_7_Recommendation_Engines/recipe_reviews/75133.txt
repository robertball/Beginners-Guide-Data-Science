I've made this about 4 times now and love it every time.  I use all three heads of garlic and once out of the oven and soft I add to the melted butter and mash together  really well.  Then I spread it over the bread!  I also toast the underside of each half loaf of Italian bread first, spread on the butter/garlic and sprinkle the parmesan on.  Then I put the loaf under the broiler cheese side up and toast that side.  The whole loaf gets toasted that way.  My friends and family ohh and ahhh about it every time I make it!

We're on a tight budget this week so I only roasted one bulb of garlic with olive oil and I used  two large hoagie rolls that I had in the freezer that I needed to use. I did increase the parmesan and I made a foil tent with the bread inside so it would be nice and moist, not dried out. This was very easy and quite cheap for me to make as it used on hand ingredients and you can sub in something else if you don't have what's asked for.

Turned out great!  Be sure and use all 3 bulbs, not cloves.  I only used 1 bulb, all I had, and the flavor wasn't strong enough.  I wrapped the bulbs in foil first and ended up roasting the garlic for an hour.  Watch the broiling time!  Can easily burn if yours gets extra hot.

This was good.  I only used one head of garlic because I mistakenly thought the recipe called for 3 cloves, and thought I would do extra.... next time I'll do at least 2 heads, maybe 3.  I only used half the amount of butter called for and it was perfect.  Very good!

Thsi recipe is a "smear" of thick, roasted garlic paste. It's sweet & loaded w/ garlic flavor w/out being at all bitter or harsh. It does need a sprinkle of sea salt to help bind the flavors but otherwise it's perfect. I keep roasted garlic in my fridge so I just used about 15 cloves, pushed them through the garlic press & then halved the rest of the recipe for slices of toast since it was just hubby & I. I served it on a thoroughly cleaned & sanitized Texas license plate in keeping w/ the 4th of July theme. Thsi is the best garlic toast I have ever eaten...thanks for the recipe!

Make sure to roast the garlic until it's nice and golden brown.  Don't skimp on the olive oil to make sure it browns well.  Also, way more parmesan cheese is needed, and I just grated it over the top instead of mixing it in the spread.  This is my favorite garlic bread...the butter/garlic powder bread just won't cut it once you've tried this.  Use a toaster oven to simplify roasting the garlic when you're pulling your dinner together.

This garlic bread is awesome!  Don't skimp by using minced, roasting the garlic is worth the effort (although you will have to air out your house afterward!!)  I replaced shredded mozzarella cheese for the parmesan since my kids prefer it and it was cheesy and delicious.  My 8 yr old son probably ate half the loaf!

This is a very good recipe for garlic bread. It tastes very much like the garlic bread that I had in Italy. So I strongly recommed this for if you want truely Italian bread.

This was really good. Next time I think I'll roast the garlic in foil or something, though, because I browned it a little too much, but the flavor was still terrific.

Yummy!  We used less garlic (personal preference) and combined the ingredients in the food processor.   Easy and delicious but it clearly takes more than 20 minutes total prep time because you have to roast the garlic.

This was yummy.  The only change that I made was to bake the bread for 10 minutes in a 400 degree oven to make it crispy all over.  I then broiled it for just a couple of minutes to get the cheese bubbly.  DH loved it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

As much as I hate to admit it, I'm a Cole's frozen garlic bread-aholic!  LOVE the stuff, so I've never bothered to make my own before.  I was hosting my MIL's b-day dinner and decided to give this one a whirl  WOW!  The roasted garlic flavor is SOOOO fabulous.  This bread was so good, I did not eat ONE BITE of my shrimp scampi (saved it for another meal) as all I wanted was this. TY for a great recipe!

Easy to make and very delicious. I discovered that it would have been good to mash the garlic prior to mixing it with the butter. Regardless, it still tasted great. I put a few strips of mozzarella on top of half of the batch and those went first. I took another reviewer's advice and toasted the bottom first.

Replace butter with margarine for fewer calories. I find replacing parsley with oregano adds a little zip.

I love recipes like this one for many reasons. First it's one of those things that requires minimum time yet presents itself as though you really fussed over it!  Second, because it's a "kid helper" recipe...meaning that the youngsters can help you with this one, and really feel that they've contributed to the meal.  I'm always looking for fun fast easy things that kids can help with.  It's a way to help them learn & at the same time they are getting the right impression about baking & cooking...that it isn't a drag...it's fun for everyone in the family.  In this busy "instant" world we're living in today, family time is at a premium. Making the meal together and then partaking of what you made together nourishes the body, the mind and the heart.  Last, but not least, I LOVE roasted garlic!  I make my bread the same way as the recipe, with just one regular addition...pile on the cheeeses!  Parm, Asiago, Mozarella, etc.  There's room for them all! :)

Excellent! This was very easy to make.  I will be making my own garlic bread for now on, no more store brought garlic bread.  This is much better than the store-bought frozen garlic bread that I used to buy, and it’s much cheaper too.   I had all the ingredients on hand, except for the Italian loaf bread, so I used a loaf of French wheat bread because that was what I had.  However, I am garlic lover so the next time I make this, I will be adding more garlic.  Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made them, they burned. The second time, I did bake instead of broil. It cooks a little longer but they don't burn. This is the PERFECT garlic bread recipe though.

Absolutely Fabulous!  I used 1 1/2 elephant size heads of garlic -- as that's what I had on hand, and roasted with just 1 T olive oil, wrapped up in foil.  Since I had a very large loaf of crusty french bread, I used 3/4 c butter, and also added some granulated garlic powder -- as we Love Garlic!  Skipped the cheese (lactose)  ---  turned out Fantastic!  Had enough left to spread on 3 left over buns the next night and was perfect with my leftover spaghetti.  The roasted garlic is to die for -- So Good!  Thanks for a Great Recipe!

This needed salt desperately.  The recipe didn't specify salted or unsalted butter and I use unsalted butter at home unless otherwise specified.  If you do the same, add some salt to the butter mixture before spreading.  Also, I wrapped in foil to cook, I think broiling open faced as the recipe suggested would be the better option.

This was excellent garlic bread. I used 3 chiabatta rolls or 6 halves and cut the other ingredients in half. I thought it said 3 cloves and not bulbs and that was all I roasted. To make matters worse I accidentally peeled them! Luckily, I took them out after 15 minutes. Some of the garlic was still salvageable, but I had to add another clove of fresh garlic to the butter mix to make up for it. I could taste a combo of roasted and fresh. It really made a difference along with using fresh parsley and not dried. I did use the parmesan cheese. I broiled them on a foil lined sheet for 5 minutes on low. Thanks!

I did not care for this recipe. I googled a garlic bread to make for my daughter and figured with so many people giving it 5 stars, I would try it. It tasted like GARLIC. that's it. it burned our mouths and I had to scrape the rest of the paste off the bread. would not ever make again.

I am unsure why this is getting such good reviews. I found it to be extremely tasteless. I didn't add the "optional" ingredients because I wanted simple garlic bread. If I were to make this again, I would sprinkle some garlic powder over the top, and maybe a little salt. But the way the recipe is right now, I would never make it again.

5 stars for the recipe itself, though I did add a lot more cheese, it really brings out more of the garlic flavor. 4 stars for the mess during and afterwards (and of the smell coming out of the garbage bin the next morning) :)

This was great, but then again I love roasted garlic. Be warned that the garlic can need upwards of an hour to roast. I made the spread the night before. I loved the roasted flavor instead of the harsh garlic flavors usually associated with garlic bread.

I'm not sure if it's always like this, but the spread soaked through the top of the bread making the bread taste kind of soggy.  Neither my sister nor I liked that.  I'd be willing to try making it once again, but if I get the same results, I'll search for another recipe.

Loved it when I made it the first time following the recipe exactly. Here are the changes I've made since in the several times I've done it: (1) Made several times w/regular garlic but yesterday did it with 2 heads of elephant garlic. This makes it milder and happily, less messy: instead of roasting in the skins, I peeled and sliced the cloves, then baked, covered. at 350, for about 90 minutes, drizzled with about 1/4 c. of olive oil, which foamed up, until very soft. (2) Omitted the rest of the butter (cholesterol reasons). (3) added about 1 TBS of dried rosemary, more parmesan, and at the end, some cracked sea salt. (4) Toasted about 1/2 c. of pine nuts and blended the whole deal in the food processor. This greatly changes the nature of the final product, adding a nutty taste and some good protein. (5) before broiling, I topped the bread slices with some shaved asiago cheese. This is seriously delicious and I love the way the house smells during and after I bake the garlic! It's been a big hit with visitors as well as my 19-year-old daughter.

This is the perfect recipe. As everyone said don't be afraid of all that garlic. I only had already minced so I roasted that instead.

Made as is, but I popped the bread in the oven at 350 for 5 min to get them toasty. Be sure to watch the bread when broiling - it can burn quick!

This was very good! What wouldn't be good with roasted garlic and butter!! :) I only used 1 very large bulb of garlic, but that was a personal thing.

How can you not love garlic bread! Although I found the roasted garlic bulbs hard to handle once they were out of the oven (hot, slippery little suckers!), I did love the overall result of the bread. Will definitely make again!

So much better than store-bought garlic bread (of course)! Next time, I will roast the garlic a bit longer to make it creamier, though.

This was so good! I followed the directions exactly and it was just great. I made 2 big loaves of bread for a party and it was a big hit. I did use Mozz cheese instead of the parm on top, and it was just very yummy.

My kids like the bread, but we all agreed, the flavor was very mild and light. We all prefer it to be a bit stronger and for it to have a bit of salt to it. Over all it was a decent recipe. But I can see me using some salt in the next round.

The roasting part of this recipe is slightly off; I've found that not covering the garlic turns it hard/crispy,  instead wrap in a foil packet or clay roasting pot.  The bread is awesome tho!!! :)

Oh. My. Goodness. This was *fabulous*!!! I had a whole bunch of pre-peeled garlic cloves from Sam's Club, so I used about 18-20 cloves of garlic, which seemed to work. We spread it on sliced Italian bread with a little shredded mozzarella on top & then broiled it. Amazing!!!!!   I think that we will make up a triple or quadruple batch so we always have some on hand for a quick addition to dinner. I also think that the mashed garlic with butter would be great mixed in mashed potatoes, in soups, etc.

Followed directions with the exception of roasting the garlic.  I roasted it at 400 for 45 minutes in a pan covered tightly with aluminum foil.  I mashed the garlic up with a fork before mixing with the butter which made it much easier to mix.  It came out perfect.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  Not only does this make excellent bread, but it is also great on everything else I have tried.  Grilling Filet Mignon - Topped with this spread.  Pasta for the child, topped with this spread.  So far, nothing has been a miss!  THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!  By the way, 5 stars just isn't enough!

I made this garlic bread for a dinner party. I had never roasted garlic before so I did not know how it changed the flavor of garlic when roasted. I also was not sure everyone at the party would love garlic as much as I do so I cut back a bit. 

Everyone LOVED it and kept telling me how great it was. I made two loafs not knowing how many people would be at the dinner party and soon got scared I made to much when I saw how few people were there...but they finished it all. 

It has been requested to the next dinner party...this time I am making at least 3 loafs and using the total amount of garlic called for...I will ALWAYS make garlic bread this way from now on.

I used 4 heads/bulbs (for personal taste).  I then used the hand-held mixer to pulverize and mix everything to a nice spreadable consistency.  Baked at 350 degrees, while preparing dinner.  Broiled for a couple minutes to finish it.  Spread the mixture on both sides of the bread and it toasts up nicely.  Hubby really liked it.  Thanks for a great recipe.  One more thing, if you're going to bake three bulbs, it's just as easy to fill a pan and bake 10 or so.  I did and now I've got yummy roasted garlic for more bread or other use.

If you like roasted garlic, you’ll love this bread!  I wrapped my garlic in foil and baked for about 35 minutes.   I made up the butter mixture early in the day, which allowed me time for the garlic to cool before I had to handle it.  Much easier than trying to handle it while it’s hot!  Hubs liked this one too, so looks like I’ll be making it again!

ABSOLUTELY HEAVENLY!  We used to buy frozen garlic bread and gobble it up but no more!  This is even better.  My DH made this for our Mother's Day meal and used hot dog buns.  DELISH!

Great and easy recipe! Worth the effort/wait of roasting the garlic, though the garlic takes about 50 to roast and not the 30 stated in the recipe.

Very good!  I roast my garlic by drizzling it with olive oil and then wrap completely in foil.  I bake it for an hour at 350 degrees.  It comes out really melllow and creamy that way. Mine broiled in 3 minutes, it would have burned at 5 minutes so watch the time.

Love, love, love this garlic bread.  It is a big hit at parties.  I never get any to take any leftovers home.  Prep time is much longer then 15 min. as removing the roasted garlic paste is very time consuming.  Alos I bake the garlic for 40-45 minutes and rebrush with garlic as it bakes. Thanks for the recipe.

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this bread! I am a roasted garlic lover, so I knew this would be a hit, and it totally was. I used a french baguette, because that was what I had, and dried parsley instead of fresh. We seriously could not stop eating this bread! This is going into the regular rotation, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Had a potluck tonight and made this recipe. It was a hit and was fun to do something new. I used 4 very large heads of garlic so I used 1 1/2c butter, added about 1 teaspoon of salt, about 3 teaspoons of dried parsley and whipped it up in the food processor. I baked the garlic for 1 hour at 350* and will try 45 minutes at 400* next time as there was a lot of the cloves in the center that just didn't get soft  as some. I didn't add the Parmesan cheese to the mixture but sprinkled it on top after spreading the mixture on the bread. I also cut my bread into slices and broiled the bottom side before spreading the mixture on. Made it a bit more crunchy and not soggy. After the Parmesan melted I added a little mozzarella and melted that on top for a little more flavor. I would have given 5 stars if the directions were better roasting the garlic.

Delicious! I couldn't believe I was putting 3 BULBS of garlic, but it was just perfect.  It's great as is, but I may try reducing the butter next time just to make it a bit healthier.  Thank you for this recipe I would have never thought of it!

Awesome! Roasted the garlic as indicated and it worked perfectly. I only used 1/4 C of butter as the creamy, roasted garlic is really all that is needed to make this delicious, assuming you're not afraid of copious amounts of garlic. Be ready to be sweating it out for days to come!

This is great!  I love fresh out of the oven garlic bread and this is just scrumptious.  I did broil it for longer than five minutes because I like just a tinge of brown to my garlic bread.  So I broiled it for about eight minutes.  So so delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good! I was careful to leave some larger bits of the roasted garlic intact so the bread in the end had yummy bits and pieces of roasted garlic.

Finally! A really good garlic bread. Roasting the whole heads or bulbs of garlic adds the perfect flavour. That's exactly what has been missing from other recipies I tried. Everyone is needing to watch pennies these days, myself included. That being said, spaghetti is a frequent dinner choice for my family. Adding this bread to the menu makes a common meal one that we look forward too. Thanks so much.

I used half a jar of peeled garlic cloves which I drizzled with olive oil and roasted in my toaster oven in a foil packet I made, which left nothing to clean up.  I mashed the garlic in a bowl with a flat, smooth pounder till it was paste.  I then mixed in softened butter and fresh minced Italian parsley.  I spread this on halves of bakery sourdough bread and broiled till golden.  It was the absolute hit of the crab feed and I will never make garlic bread any other way.  Highly recommended but be careful..it's addictive!  Many thanks for the recipe :-)

Like many others, I also had trouble with the "mushing" of the garlic.  I even let it bake for 45 minutes instead minutes.  It was just ok to us.  I don't know if I'll be trying this one again even increasing the time.  I've had better garlic bread from this site.  Sorry!

This is good.  I think I would need to mash the roasted garlic a bit more; would prefer more of a garlic paste in the butter.  And I also would  like more spices, including Italian seasoning.  But very quick, easy and delicious (had leftover roasted garlic from over the weekend).  Thanks for the recipe!

Maybe Ciabatta bread would be better...next time I will toast the bread on both sides, then slather the butter/garlic mixture on, then broil.  The bread is good as is, but w/these modifications it would have been better!  I also dumped the butter, parsley and roasted garlic in the food processor to get a nice, creamy mix, good stuff!

I loved this recipe.  Although, I'm a huge garlic fan, I thought three heads of garlic was a bit much - I ended realizing it gets baked first which sweetens it up a bit.  I didn't have the optional items and didn't miss them at all.

Great garlic bread:  healthier than store-bought and not too much effort to make.  I melted the butter and then stirred in the other ingredients and poured it on the bread.  This made the center nice and soft and buttery and the crust crunchy and crusty.  Yum!  I also just used French bread. I will be making my own garlic bread from now on.

This is great on sliced Ciabatta bread, and a sprinkling of shredded Motzerella or Provalone gives it just a little extra.

I have used a similar method for years and found it to be no-fail.  Instead of roasting the garlic I toss several unpeeled cloves into a small cast iron skillet and shake around to toast, then cut off the stem end and aqueeze the pulp onto the bread and spread.  any comments versus simmering in oil as one reviewer did ....... I too like the idea of the infused oil for dipping.

Extremely delicious! I was skeptical about using 3 bulbs of garlic but after making it I would encourage everyone to not skim on the ingredients.  The taste of the garlic butter was scrumtious, so good that i think that one can use it as a base to create a pasta sauce with it.  We ate the roasted garlic bread with a creamy tomato pasta sauce, also found in allrecipes, and my husband used the leftovers to dip into the sauce as well as using it for egg and bacon sandwiches.  This is a real winner of a recipe.  WILL make again and again!

Delicious! I placed my (peeled) garlic cloves in a small pot of olive oil and let them simmer while I made the rest of my meal. They turned out perfect and I then had garlic flavored olive oil for use another time!

I thought this bread was amazing! Make sure to eat this with the company you'll be spending the night with. && a little bit of the mixture goes a long way on the bread - you won't sacrifice the flavor either.

wow this was good. I made as written and would make a few changes next time.  My garlic needed more than 1/2 hour to roast. 2nd, I would not mix the parm cheese into the butter mixture. I would sprinkle it on top and use much more that stated so it was nice and cheesy on top.

I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't like the taste of the results.  The spread was very thick even after toasting. I had thought the butter would melt down and make the bread more moist, but for some reason the thick spread mixture of garlic, parm and butter stayed thick and the lower bread was dry.  Weird.  Maybe it was the bread I used, an organic denser loaf.  I LOVE garlic and roasted garlic, but just prefer my garlic bread more 'wet buttery'.

This is a very different garlic bread.  The roasted garlic gives this recipe a completly different taste.  

After mixing all the ingrediants for the spread, I found that it was very pasty.  My whole family agreed that it wasn't the greatest garlic bread that we've had.  If you like a thicker garlic spread for the topping and you like roasted garlic, then you will love this recipe.

I just wanted to try the recipe out, but was not happy with the results.  Sorry about the negative feedback.

Darn good garlicky bread. I minced some NON roasted garlic in the butter/olive oil to up the garlic ante. Fresh parsley really helps for some reason. Any bread will do for the most part. Roasting garlic renders it more mild...hence the 3 HEADS. The mild nature of it made me add the fresh garlic too. Real Regg/Parm completes the flavor profile unless you want to add or subtract. It's very garlic dominant...then I like to go out in public

This was so good I couldn't even eat my lasagna- just three pieces of this. It did take about an hour to roast the garlic enough for it to be creamy when mashed. I mixed the softened butter, garlic, and fresh parsley and tasted it and wasn't that happy. The garlic didn't come through the way I expected it too. Then I salted it and WOW- every flavor became pronounced and it was delicious. Salt really does bring out the flavor of whatever you add it too. I toasted the bread first so it would be crispy, then turned it over, smeared it with the butter mixture, topped with the freshly shaved Parmesan (more than called for by far), and broiled it on low until it was bubbly and browning on top. Oh my gosh it was good!!!!!

This is delicious and almost decadent! As others have stated, you will never want store bought garlic bread again! Don’t skimp on the olive oil when roasting the garlic. I also wrap the heads of garlic in foil before roasting for 45 minutes to 1 hour. This keeps the tops from browning too much (a personal preference). And mashing the garlic before adding to the butter makes for a creamier spread. Other reviewers have said this needs salt but I do not think so if you use regular salted butter. I also season the garlic heads with salt & pepper before roasting. So good and so easy! Thank you, Dana.

This was the best garlic bread I ever had and next time it will be better. I roast my garlic differently and it works every time. Cut the tip side off to expose all the cloves. Put the whole head in some aluminum foil and top with EVOO, s&p and wrap completely in foil. Less cleaning this way. Put in the oven at 350 and for this I go 45 minutes so it's super soft. I melted the butter and then put the melted butter, roasted garlic and some Parmesan cheese into my Vitamix to puree. A beautiful spread is made. I do not toast the bottom as I use French baguette which is already kind of hard and I don't like crispy garlic bread. I top my bread with the spread and more Parmesan cheese and put under the broiler. The bread is soft in the middle and browned on top. Next time I will grate some mozzarella and put that in there as well. PERFECT.

This recipe was good but I would like to try another. Perhaps my garlic heads were too small and I should've used salted butter for this, but it didn't taste as garlicky and delicious as I had hoped or as good as store bought. Once the garlic heads were out of the oven they were boiling hot so to try and take the garlic out was a total mess and nightmare, I poured them into a bowl and soaked it in cold water to do it so I wouldn't burn my hands! I had also decided to bake the bread (instead of broil) for 10 minute at 400 degrees (per the video suggestion) because others had mentioned they liked it better that way. However, even though the consistency of the garlic butter paste was thick, it came out soggy...? Not super pleased overall, but it is difficult to mess up garlic + butter on bread so we enjoyed it nonetheless.

Since I usually cook for one, I roast garlic, remove the individual cloves and freeze keeping the cloves separate.  I can then remove a clove or two and make the spread any time.  It works great to spread it on already toasted bread since garlic burns so easily.  A gourmet touch to any meal in a flash and so much better than using garlic powder.

great recipe! I made it a little easier by melting the butter in a sauce pan on medium heat then put the garlic and parsley flakes while the butter is melting. after your done with that, you take a sauce brush and brush the melted butter on your bread and roast it for the given amount of time. It really saves a lot of time and tastes delicious!

This is my favorite recipe! I do recommend that you blend everything together in a blender since that incorporates the garlic more evenly in the spread. Plus, it gets rid of the garlic chunks. Personally, I love it with the chunks but out of consideration for others, I blend it. I also add a teaspoon of oregano and a little bit of sage for depth. I also sprinkle a sharp parmasean cheese on top after. Love it!

I have used this recipe for years.  Easy to make in batches for a large dinner party.  Bake large batches, cut up into serving size pieces, wrap pieces in plastic wrap, freeze in large freezer bag then remove what you need for dinner, bake in 400 degree oven for 10 minutes or thaw and place under broiler.

Liked this recipe,added extra garlic. I normally, puree the garlic by hand, mix into butter that is warmed, add parsley then spread onto french bread and bake, but this is good, will use again.

My husband is the worlds most pickiest eater, it's impossible to get this guy to like anything I cook. He insisted that he only likes one type of garlic bread (his mothers of course) and I shouldn't even bother making it. Well, I made this recipe and he LOVED it. The guy nearly at the entire loaf of bread! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! :)

REALLY tasty; not as good re-heated, so be sure to eat it all up the first go-round. PLENTY of topping for two small demi-loaves of bread.

This was very good.  I only used 3 cloves of garlic (guess didnt read the recipe right), so would use at least a bulb if not two next time.  I didnt want it too strong, but sounds like 3's the charm.  Would make again!

Unbelievably good! Took them to a picnic where several other people brought different versions of garlic bread, and these went first. Excellent flavor, not so garlicky that it's painful, but just pure perfection. Yum!

This was allright. Without a doubt, I prefer JSWHAN"s garlic bread fantastique by a landslide (it's just that good - PERIOD!!!), but am glad I gave this recipe a try if for no reason other than finding a good and *foolproof* way to roast garlic (which btw, I've never done before!!!). I must admit that I tinkered with Dana's instructions a bit, however. Because the meatballs I made for dinner had to bake at 400 degrees, I decided to roast my garlic at that temperature also - and I'm glad I did. I ended up roasting my garlic in a double-thickness of aluminum foil for DOUBLE the amount of time directed with EXCELLENT results (about 40-45 minutes total). This method produced the BEST roasted garlic EVER!!! NOTE: This recipe does not instruct you to soften your butter - and FOR GOOD REASON!!! Even when cool enough to touch, your roasted garlic will still be slightly warm. The heat from the garlic will more than soften your butter. :) If you soften it beforehand, you will end up with a liquid mess! Overall, this offered a nice change of pace from my usual go-to garlic bread recipe, but not enough to sway me away from it. Thanks anyways, Diane! :-)

Burned every time.  No idea why, but when I cooked this the way the recipe intended, the bread burned every time!  To make it a little easier, instead of cutting the bread lengthwise, I instead cut it into "pieces", like you would cut it if you were making a garlic bread sandwich.  Also, to cut time instead of using real garlic, I used garlic seasoning, sprinkle some of that on there and away you go!  If you don't have garlic seasoning, I have also used Ms. Dash on occasion, tastes great!

The process of getting the garlic out of the clove while it was hot was rather difficult. But it was worth the struggle. Tasted amazing.

Good garlic bread. I used all 3 bulbs, make sure to use plenty of olive oil and to not have naked clove touch the backing sheet, and you won't have a problem of over browning. Next time I will put the bread in the baking oven while I mix the roasted garlic into the other ingredients, and use a food processor next time. I will aso add shredded parmesan and mozarella on top of the butter when its close to being finished. Overall, it is a great flavored garlic butter, which can't be matched with garlic salt or powder.

It was amazing! I left out the cheese, and next time I'm going to leave out the parsley. I used 2 bulbs of garlic and it was enough.

This is the best garlic bread I've ever had...including ones I've had in restaurants.  Roasting the garlic takes time but definitely worth the effort.  It is a very nice way to "fancy it up" a bit when you have some extra time.

While I loved the roasted garlic, the recipe as written was still a little bland, though this may be due to using dairy-free butter spread and leaving out the parmesan (these needed to be dairy-free).  I covered the garlic with foil while in the oven and baked it for 40 minutes, after which I squeezed it into a large bowl and mashed it into pulp with a potato masher (if you had lumpy garlic, you probably didn't cook it long enough).  I used a wooden spoon to combine the garlic with the butter-spread and added 1 1/2 tsp. lemon juice, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. salt-free Italian seasoning for flavor.  I spread the mixture on Ener-G tapioca dinner rolls as these also had to be gluten-free and broiled them for 5 minutes as directed.  They were great--the whole family loved, and no one could believe they were gluten- and dairy-free.  Thanks for the great base-recipe!!

Fantastic garlic bread! Used 3 bulbs of garlic. Put bulbs in pan, drizzled olive oil over them, and baked covered for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Used olive oil ciabatta bread. The only thing that went wrong was the edges burned a little. I only broiled for 5 min, but it must have been to hot or too close to the heating element. Nevertheless, it did not have a burnt flavor. It was DELICIOUS! Definitely making this again.

Excellent!  I was in a hurry and inadvertently added the olive oil to the butter mixture (in addition to putting it on the garlic before roasting).  The result was great so I'll continue to make it that way.

Very good!!  I've never made homemade garlic bread before.  Next time I'll be sure to mash up the garlic a little better.  Still, it was great!!

This was a big hit all around.  5 min in the broiler was too long for my oven, so I will check after 3 min in the future.

This was delicious!  My hubby thought it was a little on the strong side, but he's not a huge garlic fan so it didn't surprise me.  I only had 1 bulb of garlic so I just 1/3'ed the recipe and it came out great.  The only thing extra I added was a sprinkle of Oregano.  And I didn't have a loaf of bread so instead I used a good quality sliced sourdough bread.    Just a thought for the folks that said that their garlic burned, I wonder if they were roasting cloves, not bulbs?  It's pretty hard to burn a whole bulb of garlic.  I had mine in for 40 minutes and it was just fine.

This is pretty much how I usually make my garlic bread.  Always always use roasted garlic - most important rule.  To reduce the amount of butter you can always mix it with some olive oil.  Just a hint of dried oregano is good on this too.

Used half butter and half olive oil and dried parsley instead of fresh.  I don't think I will ever be able to make a different garlic bread.  It was to die for.  Just 5 adults and the entire loaf was eaten.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written with the following exceptions: I used about 1 1/2 TBSP. dried parsley flakes instead of fresh.  I baked the bread wrapped in foil at 350 for about 20 minutes, then topped with mozzarella, and broiled open faced until cheese was bubbly and browned.  The extra cheese really added a lot!  I took it to a friends house (who are gourmet cooks themselves) and everyone raved about it!

Very yummy!  I had a hard time blending the cloves with the butter (wouldn't smush up) so I threw the mix in my mini hand blender and blended it, then spread it on the loaves.

The roasted garlic was a great flavor, but it was hard to really get a smooth butter spread from the roasted cloves. I might roast them longer in the future to get them really soft and easy to mush up. However, the pieces of cloves that were left in the spread were a nice change of texture on the bread. It was VERY garlicky - which was wonderful, but I'd say this is the garlic limit before it starts to get overwhelming. I'd say use just as much as it says to use, but don't get tempted to add a little extra - this recipe is made for the garlic lover, so you don't have to add any more than the three heads of garlic it calls for.

Be sure to cover the entire bread surface with the butter - I missed a couple corners and they burned before the buttered part was browned. I broiled it for longer than it said to, but the buttered surface still wasn't crispy. Next time, I might try broiling the bread first before adding the butter, then buttering and broiling again to get a really nice bread that's crispy on top but not like a crouton all the way through. 

The butter was great, though, and I made extra so we could make this again without having to roast more garlic. That's another plus of this recipe: you can make extra butter so the prep time is virtually zero the next time you want to make this!

Very good bread!  We have made it twice now.  The first time exactly as written and we had the same problem many reviewers had with the butter not melting into the bread also, it was a little salty with the parm (used parm-regg).  The second time I melted the butter before mixing with the garlic and omitted the parm and sprinkled mozzeralla cheese over the top and baked it at 400 till cheese was nice and melted instead of broiling.  This time the butter was more absorbed by the bread and it was wonderful!  The second time I really mashed up the garlic which I think helped too.

Delicious!  This is my favourite garlic bread recipe ever.  Never again the powdered garlic, or pre-made stuff!

However, please note: use salted butter.  I made it with unsalted butter the first time and it was very bland.  Also, I used dried parsley and a little thyme as well to give it added kick as well as nutritional value.  

My bread preference: light rye with carroway seeds.

By far the best garlic bread I have ever laid my mitts on.  I used a tuscan loaf and  the chewy texture was an amazing complement to this fantastic recipe.  We have made this 3 times in one week and are fatter because of it but who cares :)

I was looking for a recipe similar to one I had tasted in an Italian restaurant; this one beat that one!  To cut down on prep time, I usually roast several bulbs of garlic at once, then cover them in olive oil, and keep them tightly covered in the refrigerator.  Thanks so much for this great recipe, the flavor was fabulous!!

This recipe was good, but not great but that may be more my fualt than the recipes. I think the problem was the cooking time on roasting the garlic. It says 30 mins or until soft... be sure to check it after about 20 minutes. Mine was over cooked at 30 mins. (I didn't check it at 20) and I think it would have been better had it only roasted about 20 mins. Also, I used more garlic than called for and next time I will use even more. I was expecting a really strong flavor and didn't get that. Agian, maybe because it was over roasted??? It does make a nice spread though. I will try it again and roast it less than 30 mins, but still use more garlic, about 5 or 6 cloves.

I made this for my boyfriend tonight and we both absolutely loved it!

It was my first experience roasting garlic and it was super easy. I only had one bulb and was only feeding 2 so I used the entire bulb and 2 1/2 Tbl butter. It was well worth the extra money I paid for the artisan french bread.

I added a bit of salt and substituted canola oil for the evoo, because that's what he had. I also omitted the optional parmesan cheese and parsley.

I'm thinking the person who had trouble with the butter not melting into the bread must not have used softened butter.

I'd like to try it with real parmesan cheese (I hate the  in the green can).

Oh...the garlic I used was some I got at my local farmers' market before leaving MN :D

I'm visiting him in small town Alaska so I'm a little limited and not always willing to plunk down the needed change for things like olive oil ($9 a bottle) and he's got a pretty limited kitchen.

I peeled the garlic before roasting and they were scorched and useless, so remember not to do that!  Also, be careful with your broiling time.  Mine was done at two or three minutes. Other than that it was so good--much better than frozen stuff!

This was a great recipe!  I used my hand blender to mix up the garlic butter, and it worked perfectly!  I served the bread for a dinner party, and there were no leftovers!  I will be making this again soon!

This did not work for me at all.  I left the garlic in the oven for the suggested 30 minutes and it was burned and unusable.  I was making this for a party, so I decided to use minced garlic instead.  I heated the butter and added the parmesean and it clumped up and was unspreadable.  I ended up having to just use my normal butter spread.  Disapointing.

Made it without changing a thing. It was too much butter for 3 small heads of garlic. Directions don't say what size garlic so I'm assuming 3 large heads is what is required for this recipe. I made it again and this time I used 7 small heads of garlic and it was much better. I even used it with baked French fries. Yummy!

This bread is deliciousl, roasting the garlic first gives it such a beautiful flavor, I used less garlic but I might use more next time.  This is definitely gonna be my staple garlic bread.

Made this on a whim to go w pasta and my goodness was it fantastic! It costs about the same as just purchasing the Gaelic bread but something about creating it yourself :) v yum! I'll be making this again for sure.

This is by far the BEST garlic bread I've bread made in my entire life. I've always loved garlic bread, but I've never found the right recipe for the galic bread that fit to my taste. This was so easy to make, that I made it 5 days in a row! That is how delicious and flavorful this is. One tiny bit change I would make is to use an electric mixer to cut the garlic into tinier pieces because it just doesn't taste good with a chunk of garlic stuck into your teeth. Other than that, this recipe was very simple, delicious, and full with flavor and I will definitely make agin in the future.

This is a really delicious garlic bread! I made according to directions this time, but would change a few things next time. I used unsalted butter, so I would add some salt or garlic salt to the bread (as others have suggested). Additionally, I would make the spread earlier in the day... I spent a lot of time trying to squeeze out ridiculously hot garlic cloves. Might be easier if they had time to cool a little bit.

This is definitely my favorite garlic bread recipe! I've made it twice. The second time I cut the garlic back to two heads and put the roasted cloves in the food processor to to eliminate the large chunks of garlic.

This was delicious. I cheated and put it all in the little ninja, which almost whipped the butter. Yum.

Nom nom nom nom very tasty. I use a blender to make it easier/faster mixing the ingredients.

You can get by with less butter if you are calorie-conscious.

Super great garlic bread.  Since we love garlic, I used  2 extra cloves.  Again, this garlic bread is terrific.

I used the same ingredients except I skipped step 1. Instead, I opted for mixing everything, used less butter, and substituted the cloves for garlic power. That mix was then warmed and applied with a basting brush on lightly toasted french  bread and then put back into the toaster oven to broil for another 2 min or so. Quick and tasty!

This was average at best. My garlic only partially roasted in the time specified. The bread itself didn't have much of a garlic flavour unless you came across a chunk of not roasted garlic which wasn't that nice. Plenty of other garlic bread recipes on here that are better, so I won't make this one again.

Simply the best garlic bread EVER
Made the garlic spread early in the day to avoid roasting time later. Melted the butter and mixed all. Let it solidify and spread on bread just before broiling. Perfect!!!!!
Roasted garlic for an hour and let cool before handling, then mashed thoroughly with a fork. Bon Appetit!

This is a definite keeper.  One of the best new recipes I have tried lately and sooo easy.  We all go to the restaurants and enjoy garlic bread wondering how to make it that good at home.  THIS IS IT! You can add/adjust to your flavor profile.

This is a very hearty topping. Depending on the bread it could be a meal all by itself. 
Delicious. Will start making regularly.
The roasted garlic smelled amazing.
I did put an extra sprinkle of cheese on top of everything before boiling so the crispy brown topping would be more obvious.

This is amazing!  The roasted garlic is the key. I didn't put any cheese on mine, it's just like the New York brand frozen garlic toast ( I think they butter both sides though). I also experimented with  doing  just a few single toasts at a time, they turned out just as great. Next time I think I'll put just a little salt on it.

Holy cow. This is the best garlic bread I've ever had, and I loooooove garlic bread. No changes made other than the addition of a pinch of salt. We gobbled this up like it was going out of style. I cannot wait to make it again!!!

Very good! I only used one bulb of garlic, because the hubby doesn't like a lot of garlic. My only issue was having to watch the bread under the broiler, it was done much faster than the 5 minutes given.

I was plesantly surprised to see this recipe online!  I've been making this garlic bread the exact same way for years!  And everyone loves it!  I don't add salt since there is salt in the butter.  But for those of you who need more salt, I recommend using Garlic Salt instead of plain salt.

This is a pretty good recipe. I loved the robust garlic flavor. I also took the advice another member gave me and toasted both sides of the bread at 400 degrees to get a nice crispy exterior. Overall, great recipe!

If you can find a baguette of ciabatta bread, this is the most perfect bread for this recipe.  It is a denser, chewier bread whose edges crisp up during broiling.  That bread along with this recipe has now become my bread of choice - I've served it at several dinner parties and there is never a scrap left over.  A bread lover's dream.

LOVE!!! My dinner guests raved about this bread. I love roasted garlic so this was right up my alley. I was serving a small group so I only used one bulb of garlic and half of a loaf of bread. Turned out amazingly perfect. I will make this time and time again.

Good recipe, although I thought it had too much butter for my one loaf of french baguette. I only used one head of garlic, and I thought that was sufficient, although I'll definitely increase the amount of parmesan next time. Our broiler's broken, so I baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes, wrapped in a foil tent for about the first 10 minutes, then uncovered for the last 10. Next time, I'll increase the oven temperature; it was nice and soft in the center, but the crust needed a little more crisp.

I forgot to pick up the parsley twice so I used dried flakes & mixed the spread the night before. It was still 5 star wonderful.

My family absolutely loved it! The picky eaters were licking their fingers and asking for more! I didn't have any bulbs just already peeled cloves; about 30 cloves. Very very good and will be making it again!

This was excellent! I have never actually roasted garlic before and it came out perfect. I cut the loaf into slices so that I could try to get the bottom side slightly toasty too but otherwise followed the directions exactly. Even my garlic hating daughter liked it.  This will definitely be my new garlic bread recipe every time I cook Italian.

This is good but time consuming.  I also think it needs some salt.  I salted on my own and it was too much. So, I will play with it again and try less.  I think 1/2 teaspoon of salt would make this 5 stars.

So simple and yet sooooo delicious!!  I love fresh parsley on garlic bread, but sometimes it can be a bit overpowering, not here, cooking it for a little bit keeps it from tasting like dried parsley, and keeps it from dominating the garlic.  This works wonderfully on sourdough as well.  If you have the time, I highly reccomend making your own bread.  There was nothing better than homeade french bread...until I did this to it!   Enjoy!

This was delicious!  My daughter made this as part of her Life Skills (home ec) class assignment to cook the family dinner.  We used all three bulbs of garlic, roasted, and Earth Balance Buttery Stick margarine because I am allergic to dairy.  Slathered it all on split Italian bread and it was delicious!

I made this as described, but did add a little asiago cheese in with the parmesan. Cooked garlic as recipe states and it turned out perfect!. I did have a little difficulty trying to get the bulbs out of the skin while it was still hot. I let it cool for about 5 minutes so it was more bearable. I then used a potato masher to blend and crush the garlic to a "liquid" state. Spread the mixture over the bread and broiled for about 4 minutes. PERFECT!

This is by far the best Garlic bread I have ever had. Only suggestion is chopping the garlic up more so you dont have a huge chunk in each bite.

YUM!  I made this exactly as written (opted out on the parm cheese...oh & I used just dried parsley) and it came out wonderful.  The only thing I would complain about is that the top browned up before the rest of my bread was anywhere near toasted, so next time I will probably toast my bread a little before broiling.  Thank you for sharing!!!  Loved how easy, elegant looking & tasty this bread was!  :)

I thought the garlic would be more mashed, but it was pretty chunky. I'm not sure if I did anything wrong or if that is normal, but it was sooo delicious! I never thought I would enjoy eating chunks of garlic like that!

Ok, so I thought this was going to turn out BAD because after about 45 minutes of roasting the garlic, it still wasn't soft. I had already mixed it in with the butter at that point, so there was no turning back. The garlic just didn't really mash and each clove kind of stayed whole. I had to just go with it, but it wound up tasting great. My husband and I love garlic, so we didn't mind biting into whole cloves and I will probably make it the same way next time. Rather than mixing in the Parmesan, I just sprinkled it on top, along with some garlic pepper seasoning. So bottom line...don't panic if the garlic isn't fully soft. It will still be great!

definately use all the garlic "bulbs" suggested. This is awesome.  I double the recipe, place the extra garlic/butter mixture in the refrigerator and use it to make more bread or on fish with lemon/dill and other recipes. So easy to grab out of the fridge and use.

This was fantastic! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Even a guest that said she didn't like garlic bread had 3 slices. I made it with the optional parm and fresh parsley. As many of the reviewers said it did cook faster, just keep an eye on it. Definately making this again.  Thanks Dana.

HANDS DOWN the best garlic bread I have ever had.  Roasting the garlic makes all the difference.  I served this with a delicious lasagna but everyone was just filling up on the bread.   I can stop looking for the Holy Grail of garlic bread.  I've found it.

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I didn't have fresh garlic, so I used the minced garlic from a jar and sauteed it until golden brown.  Then I mixed it in with the paste, but I used oregano and italian seasoning instead of parsley.  Came out great.  Next time I might try baking the bread in tinfoil to warm the whole thing more completely, prior to broiling the top.

This was great!  The garlic needed to be roasted longer- at least another 10-15 minutes.  For those worried it's too garlic heavy- roasting really cuts down on that. My toddler ate the toppings right off!

Not bad. I love the rasted garlic but I will scale back on the butter. Mash your garlic and only soften the butter dont melt it so you can spread it a little thinner.

Makes a really good garlic bread.  The roasting gives the garlic a nice, mellow flavor.  The verdict from our guests was the bread was too buttery and too soft, so next time I make this I'll try halving the butter and omitting one bulb of garlic.  I'll also toast the bread on one side beforehand as another reviewer suggested.  In case anyone was wondering (as I was), you'll end up with nice chunks of garlic on the bread but don't worry, thanks to the roasting they're not too strong.  Overall the bread was a hit so I'll make it again.

This was really good, if I make it again, I'll use less butter and more garlic, since my bulbs weren't huge. It also really needs to be broiled to crisp up. A really great recipe, just needs to be tweaked to my family's tastes!!

This wasn't bad, but I did mess it up a bit at first.  I had the broiler up too high or just had it in for too long.  Either way, the edges burnt and the underside of the bread was untoasted.  The second time I tried this, I decided to bake it instead of broiling it and toasted nicely on all sides.  Also, I added some motz cheese which was a nice touch.  Will tweak the recipe a bit more for my own tastes, but it is certainly worth a try as it is.

This is amazing - so worth the small amount of effort to make your own garlic bread. I use two bulbs of garlic and add Italian seasoning instead of just parsley. I make a big loaf and cut in in half. I serve half and freeze the other half(before baking)for later.

It was delicious, I added 1/4 tsp of dried oregano, and I didn't have fresh parsley on hand, so I used 1/2 Tbsp of dried parsley. I also melted the butter to combine with the ingrediants better than let it solify back alittle before spreading on bread.

very good. i baked the bread for a few minutes before adding the butter mixture, and it made it easy to spread (i made the butter earlier in the day). i also covered the top of 1/2 the loaf with mozzarella and sprinkled parsley on it for the kids. very good and fragrant.

I did'nt have any fresh garlic but I did have the minced kind in a jar. So I used about three bulbs worth and made the paste by using my immersion blender. It turned out good in spite of the modification. Will try it the right way next time. Oh, I used a lot more parmesan too.

Very good! Easy to make, and much tastier than the store bought, over buttered versions.

This was delicious.  My husband said it was the best garlic bread I've ever made, and he loves my usual recipe.  It might sound like a lot to have 3 bulbs of garlic, but it is actually not overpowering because of the roasting.  I melted the butter and I added a little more parmesan cheese + about 1/2-1 tsp of italian seasoning and it came out delicious.  I had no problem mashing the garlic up, I used a potato masher to really mash it good.  I only broiled for a couple of minutes (because the edges started to turn dark) and then I put it in the oven at 300F for about 5-10 minutes and it firmed up nicely.

I used 4 heads of garlic. Not all the garlic was mushy enough to blend into the butter.  I had to press it through a mesh strainer to get the cloves out and it turned out fine.  I sprinkled the bread with some red pepper flakes. My husband who "doesn't like garlic", ate half the loaf.

DELICIOUS. You must love garlic. The flavor is not overpowering, but you need to make sure your garlic is roasted and soft before using in spread. I could have eaten a billion of these.

I only had one head of garlic on hand, so I had to adjust the ratios of other ingredients accordingly. Also, due to lack of parsley, I subbed a few dashes of Italian seasoning. I roasted my garlic inside a ramekin (covered with foil) for about 50 minutes- and I had no issues mashing the garlic. This was a nice change from your typical garlic bread. I served this with "Bow Ties with Sausage, Tomatoes, and Cream" from this site.

Nothing great for alot of extra work.  Next time I'll leave the garlic in the clove and let the guests squeeze them out to their liking on to crusty bread.

Delicious. Garlic comes in all shapes and sizes, I had a HUGE bulb so it took the full half hour, but I checked on it frequently by poking it with a fork.

For me this recipe was ok. I didnt roast the garlic long enough, so i had big chunks of garlic on the bread which I didnt mind but others at my party were picking it off. I will give this another chance.

Although it was a great recipe, I couldn't help but feel it was lacking something. I'll experiment with the flavors more next time. The paste that is made with the ingredients was easy to spread. Thanks for the recipe.

This garlic bread recipe is phenomenal and foolproof!  I left out the parmesean cheese (as I was making it for some very picky eaters), and it was a huge hit.  Tasted better than any of the pre-made garlic breads I've tried from the grocery store.  I will definitely be making this again soon!

I just wanted to add that you can also do this with "elephant garlic" although its not a real garlic its a mild sweet garlic type of taste, it worked perfectly with this same recipe and perfect for those that don't like a heavy garlic taste(my kids). love the recipe both ways, thanks for sharing!

Great Recipe but for those of us that are still working on boiling water or are always short on time... They sell roasted garlic in jars. This cuts the prep time down to almost nothing.

Thank you for this recipe! I was given many bulbs of beautiful garlic from Gilroy & wanted to roast it, but couldn't find any specific directions - 
temperature, time etc. in the hundreds of cookbooks that I collect. Your recipe gives me the information I needed. I'm sure that we will make & enjoy this garlic bread for many years.

Awesome! My friends said it was the best garlic bread they had ever had! I used all three bulbs and used sourdough bread instead of Itallian; my friends really got a kick out of that.

This was delicious! I didn't follow the directions for preparing the garlic because I already had some on hand from another recipe, so I cannot comment on the roasting method. But the mixture used to top the bread was very tasty.

The flavor of the roasted garlic is great. I spread the garlic/butter mixture on and then sprinkled with parsley and Parmesan. The cons to this was the extra time and the price comparison of garlic heads to some garlic powder.  The flavor turned out great though.

Excellent!  The garlic flavor is so subtle when you use roasted garlic.  This is the best garlic bread I have had.
