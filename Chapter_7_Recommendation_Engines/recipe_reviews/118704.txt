We really enjoyed this recipe. But note two things, the cooking time is way off. It took us 60-75 minutes to cook the meat. 40-45 was not enough the temp of the meat barely reached 140 degrees.  We have a new oven so I know that is not the issue. Also the second thing is the meat cost about $45!! So note this. This is for a special meal.  My family thought the meat was the best they ever had!

Recently served this recipe to a group of 75 people and had several of them ask for the recipe! It was very tender and juicy. Make sure that you fold over the tail end before you cook it so that the whole tenderloin cooks evenly. Make sure that you do not cook it past 135 degrees for maximum flavor and juicyness!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  I made it for a party and it got raves from my guests, plus my boyfriend who is very picky about his beef, LOVES IT.  5 stars in my book!

Totally WONDERFUL! No knife needed! I had a full tenderloin roast at 3 lbs. I cut off all visible fat and stripped it of silverskin. Since it was laying wide open, I filled the interior with the mentioned spices and a full bulb of roasted garlic. Then I tied it up with kitchen string to a vaguely circular shape. After 1/2 hour, the ends registered 145 degrees, so I pulled it out of the oven, whacked the ends off, and turned the oven off, letting the bulk of the roast sit for 10 minutes or so. That way it was ALL medium rare to rare. The middle was at 135 when I pulled it but after resting it got up to 144, close enough for me. I am telling ya, this was easy, and absolutely the most delicious meat we have ever eaten. I have made plenty of tenderloin roasts in the smoker and on the grill...who would think an oven recipe would beat that? BTW, tenderloin roasts are NOT all cut the same...yours MAY take longer or shorter to cook. Mine was exactly 40 minutes at 425 in a brand new oven. All ovens are different...and there is no substitute for an accurate meat thermometer. Check it at 1/2 hour then every ten minutes, and cook sides to be something that can wait...like backed potatoes, salad etc. It's worth any hassle to think ahead!

This was perfect!  Costco's "choice" cut weighed close to four pounds, so I used half again the amount of herbs.  I did not tie it with string.  I tucked the smaller ends under so they wouldn't overcook, and mine was done to perfection in about 45 minutes at 400 (well preheated).  The secret to cooking meat is to season it and bring it to room temperature before putting it in the oven.  We felt that the herbs allowed you to really enjoy the meat!  Very tasty!  I served this with Merlot Dipping Sauce on the side for those who enjoy that yummy taste!

I rub my beef tenderloin with olive oil, then on waxed paper, I put a generous amount of Montreal Steak Spice.  I roll it up into clear wrap and leave overnight if possible, or as many hours as you can leave it.  Use a meat probe in your oven, or do it on the barbeque, getting it hot, and turning off all but one element, and again using a probe.  It will be perfect!

I made this for Christmas dinner and found that for my 4-pound tenderloin it took about 70 minutes to cook.  It was cooked to perfection and very tender, but I would have liked for it to have had a little more flavor.  No one else in my family complained, so made it was just me.

Tender and delicious. Cooking time will depend on thickness of tenderloin and temperature of the meat as you begin to cook, so the thermometer is essential to determine when it is done.  I followed the recipe closely the 1st time and it was a little rare for me at 145.  The 2nd time I tried this, I increased the olive oil to 1/4 cup, after 15 minutes of cooking I added 3 halved onions and 4 halved, peeled potatoes.  I coated them with the oil/drippings from the beef, continued to cook until the thermometer read 155 in the deepest part of the meat... Then I allowed the beef to sit for 15 minutes prior to slicing. This was the best roast ever!

I made this for Christmas Eve for the family.  I had 2 x 4.5# tenderloins so I basically tripled the recipe.  It was a hit!!  Everyone said it was the best one I had made yet!!  Definintely will be using this recipe again!  I did put all the ingredients on and let it marinade in the refridge for about 6 hours prior to cooking.

We had a group of 14 for New Year's Eve.  I purchased a 6 lb tenderloin at BJ's for $7.99 a pound.  It was outstanding.  I followed the directions except for doubling the herbs and olive oil.  I prepared it in the morning and wrapped it in wax paper.  Took it out of the refrig. to come to room temperature before I inserted the probe, setting the temp. for 140. Set the oven temp for 425 deg.  Roasted it in my convection oven which cut off when the tenderloin reached 140 deg. internally (about 50 minutes).  Took it out and let it stand under foil for 15-20 minutes.  I also made the Merlot Dipping Sauce from this site.  Both were delicious.  Everyone raved over the tenderloin.

This was excellent.  I just drizzled olive oil over the meat and then rubbed in the garlic and spices.  I cooked this to rare/medium rare and it was delicious and tender.

This is now a regular in our house. It is yummy and easy to do with what is already in the spice cabinet. Turns out great every time, I do not have to worry about checking it, the time and measurements are right on.

This was simple and great for a group with varied taste.  I used a probe thermometer and took the beef out after reaching 128 degrees, let it sit tented with foil for over 15 minutes, and it was perfectly medium rare.

This recipe is excellent, I change one part I used Italian seasoning instead of Rosemay and use 6 cloves of garlic.  I also put the seasoning together a container and refrigerated it  overnight. I rub it on the meat 2 hours before cooking so it would absorb into the meat. The entire 4lb tenderloin had no chance of leftovers

I'm not a meat eater by choice, but all I had in the freezer was beef tenderloin, so thought why not. This recipe was fabulous! It was very easy to follow and cook up. Hubby was impressed. I will definately make this again. The herbs gave this recipe a nice earthy taste. Very yum-yum-yummy!

Easy to do. I like my beef cooked to 125* and let sit for a few. Herbs added a nice touch of elegance.

Fantastic!  I used smaller individual pieces (3 at just bigger than 1/4 lb each) and they worked just as well.  They only needed about 20 minutes to get to 135, then sat for 10 to get to 155.  My hubby couldn't believe how tasty they were without going on the grill!

It is marvellous, I tried it for the first time and made a very delicious meal. It is so easy.
One remark I want to make, I do not use salt. I just use herbs and black pepper is so perfect to bring out the beef taste.
And I reduce the oven temperature to 400F after 10 mins.

Tried this last night. Instead of baking this, I put it into my crock pot for 8 hours on low, flipping it once and continuously pouring the juices over it. It was so juicy! My boyfriend couldn't help himself and went back for seconds. Will try again. :)

I followed this recipe exactly, but I rubbed all the herbs on the tenderloin and let it sit for a few hours before putting it in the oven. AWESOME flavor!!

This was absolutely perfectly seasoned and cooked,and my dinner guests all enjoyed it.  I was concerned when it was cooking because all I could smell was garlic, but it was fine.

Very disappointed in trusting some others reviews of this where they suggested that the cook time wasn't long enough. I cooked for a little over an hour and it was way over cooked, unless you like your beef overdone. I prefer a medium to medium rare roast. I would definitely try to follow the exact cook time if I make this again.

I doubled the garlic and spices, and blended together.  Patted the meat dry, rubbed with 1 Tbsp oil, and massaged the spice mixture into the meat before tying.  3# took 50 minutes to reach 150 in a v rack over a jellyroll pan.  The drippings made a tasty pan sauce.  Simple, tender, and flavorful!  I'm not surprised, TOH has yet to disappoint me!

This was a simple, delicious way to prepare the tenderloin.  I added more garlic, as that is our preference.  It went perfectly served with the Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake found on this site also.  Thanks for posting!

Perfectly adequate.  Very simple recipe to assemble in under an hour.  The real test of it lies in the tenderloin, but in most cases this is a fine way to dress it up.  I doubled the garlic to my satisfaction, and the salt inducts all the flavor into the meat.

This is a great recipe, very simple, and very tasty.  The only reason it's not a 5 star is that the cooking time and serving size are off.  It took 65 minutes to cook, and NO WAY does it serve 12 adults.  After trimming and cooking that would be two small slices per person, and that's not enough.

This was about the best tenderloin I've had.  Very flavorfull, fork cut tender.  I followed the recipe exactly.   I spread the spice / oil mixture on the beef about 2 hours before putting it on the grill, bringing iy to room temperature.  Seared all sides over high heat in the front of a charcoal Weber, then cooked it for 45 minutes on the charcoal-less back side of the grill.  It was a perfect medium rare after 45 minutes.

I keep making this over and over again.  This is so good! Each time I add more herbs and fresh garlic.  Soooooo good and big winner at the dinner table.
