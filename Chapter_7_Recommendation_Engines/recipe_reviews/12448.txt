The first recipe for French silk pie is incomplete, that is why there is not enough filling for a full pie. After you cream the ingredients listed you are supposed to whip the whites of the two eggs used into a merange type consistancy using 1/4 c sugar to help form stiff peaks.  Then you are supposed to add the chocolate mixture to the egg white mixture which will give you plenty of filling for your pie with a taste that is heavenly and is so light and fluffy. The way French silk pie is supposed to be. This is a great recipe that is fast and easy to prepare and is a crowd pleaser every time.

The trick to getting a silky, not soupy and grainy filling is to beat it on HIGH speed for at least 3 minutes per egg WITH THE WISK ATTACHMENT, NOT THE PADDLE IF YOU USE A STAND MIXER!!! I used the paddle first for the butter etc. and then switched to the wisk.  Beating for any length of time on a lower speed won't work. I used 4 Tablespoons of cocoa powder instead of going through the trouble of melting and cooling chocolate.  Also only used 1/2 cup sugar.  I also added 1/4 cup malt powder to the butter mixture before adding the eggs for a French silk malted pie.  Superb!!!!  Double the recipe and the alterations above for a standard premade oreo crust. Thanks for recipe.

1 inch of filling does not a pie make! I gave the recipe 3 stars. The taste and texture are incredible BUT there isn't enough filling for a standard 9 inch pie shell. The filling needs to be doubled, everything else is perfect, ingredients, method and results are to die for, but the pie looked cheap because the shell wasn't full enough. After it has set overnight, garnish with whipped whipping cream{sweetening it is not necessary with this pie} and chocolate curls

Yes, this pie is "thin" on the filling as one reviewer commented, but because it is dense and very rich, and I always top this with sweetened whipped cream and garnish with chocolate curls which builds it up. Serve in small portions. It is delicious!

"Mom, next Wednesday is pi day and we have to make a pie for math class!" my daughter told me last week.  "My teacher's favorite pie is French Silk and I told him we would make one."  I sadly told her I had never made one before, but we could look up a recipe and try it over the weekend.  This recipe for French Silk Chocolate Pie looked like a winner!  I noticed the recommendations to double the filling, picked up the ingredients, and we began baking.  This was my daughter's first experience at rolling pie dough, and at holding the mixer for the full five minutes after each egg.  Our two trial pies on the weekend turned out delicious!  I took one to share with my fellow teachers, and froze a piece for my son in college.  Then, on Tuesday night, we began to make the pie for pi day at school.  In the middle of the preparations (while waiting for the chocolate to cool), I realized I had only one teaspoon of vanilla, not two!  What to do?  I looked through my cabinets and found almond extract.  I thought with the chocolate, it probably wouldn't even be tasted.  The pie was made and in the refrigerator, ready for the final whipped cream topping in the morning.  I licked off a little filling from my spatula and just rolled my eyes.  That little bit of almond extract was wonderful in that filling!  I wished I had made the first two that way!  Well, the pie was a hit at school; everyone loved it and the pie pan came home empty.

OMG this thing was awesome and OH SO EASY!  If you REALLY do what the recipe says you will have no problems at all.  It was so light, so fluffy and sooooo amazingly simple.  I will never by a pie in a box again.  (Not that I ever did, but if I know someone is about to I'll bring this myself since in my husband's family this is the pie of choice.)  First thing - melt the butter a bit.  It is important that the butter is room temperature, i.e. very soft.  Mine was quite soft and so when I whipped it, it whipped up quickly and easily.  I added the sugar very slowly and you could see the mixture turning white as the recipe said you wanted it to.  If it doesn't turn white you haven't whipped it enough!  Finally, add the eggs one by one.  As each egg was added, it did appear to thicken a bit.  But as the recommended five minutes elapsed it returned to fluffy and then got even fluffier.  Added the next egg and it was the same thing again with an even fluffier result in the end.  Only place I deviated was using a chocolate cookie crumb pie crust.  Added a layer of fresh whipped cream just before serving and we were all absolutely thrilled with this pie!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it went over really well.  The key is to beat each egg for the full five minutes.  I started to worry that it would still be gritty, but after beating each egg the full five minutes it wasn't at all.  No leftovers at all!

AWESOME!! I made this for a church function. By far the youngest lady, my pie had the most compliments. I made my own choc. cookie crust and topped with whipped cream. Next time I'll leave the whipped cream off--it confused the taste. The pie was WAY GOOD without it! I creamed ingred. for a very long time to achieve a very silky, no grit, texture. I also made it kid- and elder-friendly by using pasteurized Egg Beaters egg whites. A cowhand said that it was a little piece of heaven!

Going only on flavor this recipe is a five star pie. But flavor isn't everything. The proportions on this recipe are way off the mark. I doubled the recipe and still came up short. You would want 2.5 times these amounts to fill a 9 inch pie crust. Also, I modified the recipe for sanitary reasons. After adding the raw eggs, I slowly brought the batter to a boil over medium heat, stirring it regularly. After removing it from the heat, I mixed it again at medium speed. This modification gave me peace of mind that I'm not giving anyone food poisoning. The pie set well and had a perfect consistency... in the fridge. After being out for a few minutes it became tasty chocolate soup in a pie shell.  I know some of this is the trade-off for cooking the egg whites, but I seriously doubt the raw egg pie would last two hours on the buffet table either. This pie needs to be kept cold.

This is one of my favorite pies!  Almost all of the reviews for this recipe say to double the filling, but I found that it was not necessary.  One step that was left out of the recipe is to CHILL the mixture.  I chill mine in the freezer for 5-10 minutes after getting the last egg stirred in...maybe 1 minute of whipping, then straight to the freezer.  Once the mixture is chillled, whip it the remaining 4 minutes.  It will really start to fluff up.  A true french silk pie is light brown and fluffy...not deep dark brown.  If you ended up with dark brown filling, you didn't whip it enough, or the mixture was too warm.  When the mixture is warm, it won't fluff up, therefore you won't have enough to fill the pie shell.  Trust me, it works and it is sooooo good!  Now I just have to figure out a way to get rid of some of the fat so I can eat it more often!!

I was very hesitant to try this because the thought of eating something with raw eggs in it makes me sick. But, I figured the FS pie I get from Bakers Square probably has raw eggs in it and that's never stopped me from eating it. So, I tried this. Very glad I did. Tasted great and was surprisingly easy (since I let my Kitchenaid do all the work). I will do this again.

Because I was low on time (and sick as a dog), I made a chocolate cookie crust instead of using a pastry shell. I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and doubled the filling. I'm glad I did, because the pie would have only filled the pie shell just under halfway if I hadn't doubled it. It really was a simple pie and the outcome was a very rich and decadent pie that was almost truffle like in mouth feel. We absolutely loved it, my husband ate two pieces back to back. Excellent pie. I think this could also make a good mousse pie next time if I was to fold in sweetened whipped cream instead of doubling the filling. NOTE: I'm sure if I had waited five minutes between each egg, my filling amount would have been perfect. That being said, I think my oldest son did a bang up job on his own and the results were great for us even if the original filling amount wasn't enough for us. Next time, I'll make this myself and see what the outcome is, then re-review.

So after reading a bunch of the reviews for this recipe, I was thoroughly confused as to which directions I should follow.  To double the recipe for filling…or not? To whip the egg whites into stiff peaks…or just whip the entire egg in as is?  After much consideration, the only changes I made were to the serving size (I changed it to 12, b/c I used a 9 in pan), the crust (I used an oreo cookie crust), and the method of preparation (I used a whisk attachment for the eggs and a paddle attachment for the other ingredients). I whipped each egg for 5 minutes before adding the next one. I ended up with a BEAUTIFUL, silky, heavenly French silk pie! I will DEFINITELY be making this in the future.

This is presented as a dump recipe, with all ingredients dumped together. It is NOT a dump recipe. Take all of the sugar and process in a food processor, or buy ultra fine sugar at the store. 1/4 cup of that sugar keep aside. Use 3 eggs. Separate the eggs, reserve the whites. Heat the chocolate, but don't add it to the butter until everything goes together. Take the egg whites and the reserved sugar and make a meringue. Now add the warm chocolate to the cold butter-mix, mixing well. now fold in the meringue, not mixing, not beating, you want the air to stay in the egg whites.  Chill this quickly, the butter thats in this needs to only be warm enough to work with the whole time for this recipe. If the butter runs, it's ruined. Hope this helps all of you. remember, yolks with the butter, whites with the sugar, this will help keep things as light-textured as possible. enjoy

I put a layer of homemade, sweetened whipped cream on top and garnished with chocolate shavings. The taste and texture was PERFECT. The only problem I have is with the reviewers. I don't understand what the big deal is about the amount yielded in the original recipe if you are using a regular-depth 8 or 9 inch pie dish. I usually read reviews prior to making a recipe and usually find them helpful, but this time I'm disappointed. I doubled the batch of filling due to the amount of complaints I read, and well, I could have piled on all of that filling to the point of an overflow...as another cook did according to a picture posted of this recipe, but why would I? It is already a very rich filling and to put THAT much in?! A "French Silk Pie" is supposed to have a generous layer of whipped cream on top and I'm sure that's what no one is doing (according to a lot of the pictures posted of this recipe). Luckily it was so good that my brother-in-law requested another pie the next day so the second pie did not go to waste. So WARNING: If you want more filling, try doing 1 1/2 of the recipe before you go doubling it.

I would give this ten stars if I could.  So, so smooth, and so, so chocolatey.  I'm making this for my own birthday.  As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the recipe.  I made a couple of other changes, too.  I used UNSALTED butter and Dove Dark Chocolate Promises (23 of them, to be exact--it's worth the time to unwrap them).  I used 1/2 cup of sugar for the double recipe, since I used the Dove dark chocolate.   I also used an Oreo cookie crust.  The filling IS runny at first, but sets up nicely overnight in the fridge.  Did I mention it was delicious?

New name...Chocolate crack pie. Because it's VERY addictive! Beat the snot out of the eggs, at least the 5 minutes per egg that is recommended ON HIGH SPEED. It's the only way to whip the eggs up to the consistency you want for this pie. (I used size Large...medium size eggs won't fill up the pie.)  The recipe should fill an 8 inch store bought Oreo pie crust just fine, with a little room to spread some cool whip or whipped topping over the top, and then drizzle with Hersheys syrup. Amazing recipe. Everyone will go back for more!

Two years ago my son, now 10, and I searched for the perfect chocolate pie recipe.  We tried over ten different recipes, some went to the magpies after the first bite, but this recipe is the one we repeatedly came back to and the only one we use now.  It is so easy and so good, the beating of the eggs for a whole 5 minutes is the key to a fluffy pie.**We have made a few changes to this recipe.  We add another 1/3 to the pie ingredients.  We make a chocolate graham crust and top it off with whipped cream that has had powered sugar and cocoa added to it.

Was really good and liked the richness of the flavor. I dont know why but I should have gone with my gut and used confectioners sugar instead of the regular, but I thought....hmm... i guess I could go half and half...should have done confectioners as I still could taste some of the sugar granules. But good overall!

I gave this a 5 star because the taste and consistency was perfect.  I did have to do a few adjustments.  The first pie I made I doubled the recipe and separated the eggs beating the whites until firm and then folded them in.  The total time of beating for this pie was 50 minutes (I beat the heck out of it at each step).  The finished product was a perfect consistency pie with a very grainy taste.  So, I did it again only this time, instead of using the 3/4 cup of sugar, I used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar (actually I used 3 cups since I doubled the recipe the second time as well).  The end result?  A perfect, delicious, smooth pie.

This is a really good pie especially when you have a nice dollop of whipped cream on each slice.  Very smooth and silky in texture.  Sort of like a chocolate cream pie without the meringue.  This is sure to soothe the chocoholic beast in you.  Thanks Ruth.

I followed the directions exactly and got a runny pie that never set. It seemed like it was missing ingredients.

I have made this pie for over 40 years and have  come back to it time and again because everyone loves it.  The trick is to use only an 8 inch pie shell and beat after each egg the full 5 minutes.  Then it is creamy as "silk".

I was torn whether to try this or not based on the reviews about it coming out grainy. Because I have a KitchenAid i decided to give it a shot. I did double the recipe, cut the sugar to 1 cup total.
This is the most heavenly pie ever, I topped it with a dollop of home made whip cream and slivered almonds and just a pinch of coco. For those who have had problems i feel certain its because its not been blended long enough. I felt like a princess all I had to do was stand there and add an egg every 5 minutes...this will be made many times to come in my home. Thanks

Mine didn't set- I chilled it overnight, but it still turned out very, very runny. Any hints?

This recipe is the bomb! I followed the recipe to a T, including the beating of one egg at a time for 5 min each. I used pasteurized egg in a carton since the raw egg thing made me a little nervous. But if you are a fan of french silk pie, you will love this recipe.

Here are a few tips that will cook your eggs and fix the grainy texture of this recipe.  Double ingredients, reduce sugar to 2/3 cup + 1TBS.  Replace unsweetned chocolate with 5 oz milk chocolate. DIRECTIONS: 1)In a double boiler, melt your chocolate until smooth.  Remove and allow to COMPLETELY COOL! 2)In a grease free bowl add the egg whites and the 2/3 cup of granulated sugar.  Mix well.  Take a wet pastry brush and brush down the sugar that have set on the sides of the bowl.  Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water and whisk occasionally until it reaches 160 degrees. 3)If you notice chunks of cooked egg or crystallized sugar in the meringue mix, take a mesh strainer and pour the mixture through. 4)  whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form and the egg whites are cool to the touch... about 15- 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a double boiler whisk the egg yolks,1 TBS heavy cream and 1 TBS sugar until well blended.  Whisk constantly over low heat until it registers 160. 5)When meringue has formed stiff peaks and is cool, take a rubber spatula and GENTLEY FOLD your COOLED chocolate to the meringue until blended. 6)In a separate bowl, cream the butter for about 3 minutes.  Add the vanilla. Add egg yolks until well blended.  FOLD into the chocolate meringue until well blended. 7) Spoon filling into a prepared COOL pie shell.  Put into the fridge and let set overnight.  After 2 hours in the fridge cover with plastic wrap.  HOPE THIS HELPS!!

Fabulous! For Thanksgiving, I cheated and bought the pies this year at a local well known Bakery/Resturant.  One of the pies I bought was a French Silk Pie. Everyone loved it. A few days later was my son's birthday.  He really like the pie, and asked for it for his birthday. I decided to try to make it.  He and the rest of the family said this was even better. That doesn't happen very often where I beat out a bakery. 
I did as other said and doubled the recipe and I cut down on the sugar by about 1/3 cup. I also cheated and bought a graham cracker crust(10")and it fit perfectly.  Since I doubled it, I had to mix (on High)a total of 20 min. (5 min per egg) You have to mix it like it says or it will be grainy.  I sort of tried it after each egg, and by the fourth, no more "grainy" feel to it. This was as the name says, Pure Silk.  Be warned everyone.  This is a very intense pie, and a little goes a long way. Keep your portions smaller. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving this year and everyone LOVED it!  I topped it with real whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  It went before all the other pies, even a french silk from Perkins.  You really need to follow the directions and beat long enough so it's smooth.

This pie is great, but you must follow instructions and beat it for 5-minutes after each egg is added for it to come out smooth and to set properly. I substituted 6 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa and 2 tablespoons solid shortening for the 2 squares (2 ounces) of unsweetened chocolate (I didn't have those on hand.) This recipe is a keeper.

I was able to get plenty of the french silk for my pie because I waited more than 5 minutes between eggs. My problem was that the sugar stayed very grainy and it was inedible.

I think this recipe is absolutely perfect as is. I have read other reviews saying that the filling is not enough, or that you are also supposed to fold in the whipped egg whites, etc...  Honestly, I can't see why you would. If you follow the recipe exactly, you get a very rich, super smooth and 'silky' chocolate filling. Sure, the filling isn't thick, per se, but it's so rich that I think it would be a waste. I have made this pie several times, with regular pie crust, which a chocolate cookie crumb crust and in individual tartlet shells, and it always comes out perfectly. And I ALWAYS get asked for the recipe. It's fantastic!

This was the first french silk pie I ever made, and with tips from other reviewers, it turned out fantastic!  Since i used a deep dish 9" pie pan, I increased the recipe by half except for the sugar which I only used 1 cup and it was plenty sweet. I used medium high speed and whipped 5 minutes after each egg, and by the time I was done, all the graininess from the sugar was gone. So just keep on beating until the graininess goes away. It did turn soupy, but after 15 minutes in the freezer, as another reviewer suggested, it whipped up immediately and enough to fill my deep dish pie pan to the very  top.  I prebaked a regular store bought refrigerated pie shell and I think it was a good idea instead of a chocolate crust which may have been too chocolately or graham cracker crust which may have been too sweet.  I pressed in some ground pecans in the crust before baking, but be careful not to burn.  I did have my first taste after 2 hrs in the fridge, but definilely needs to be overnight as it was good, but way too  soft.  Overnite, it was so perfectly firm and cuts and plates beautifully.  I topped mine with cool whip because I had it, but next time, homemade whipped cream will be my choice, to do this wonderful pie justice.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good pie with some tweaking.  The chocolate was mildly grainy.  The flavor was excellent but I recommend doubling the recipe and splitting the sugar like this:  1 cup of powdered sugar with the ingredients (add 1/2 tsp also) and separate the eggs, and use the egg yolks in the chocolate mixture.  Whip the egg whites with 1/2 cup white sugar to stiff peaks.  fold into the chocolate mixture and spoon (or pipe) into your preferred prepared crust.    all-in-all a very good pie, that I would make again with the updated instructions.

Everyone is right there is not enough filling for one pie.  You need to double the filling to make a true french silk pie.  I also strongly agree with other reviewers that you need to whip the egg whites and sugar to a thick consistancey then add that to your chocolate mixture.  This is a great recipe.  It was fast and easy to make.  I will use this again.

Chocolate becomes grainy when overheated, causing the pie to be grainy. Do not go for the quick or easy with chocolate. It does not take much heat to melt chocolate. I use a double boiler. If you do not have one, use a bowl over very warm but not boiling water in a sauce pan.

Perfect!  Very rich and delicious.  Followed the directions exactly - you MUST beat the eggs into the mixture for the 5 minutes each in order to get the volume needed.

Came out perfect by just following the recipe.  Some may have used larger pie plates and it wouldn't be enough then.  My husband is the French Silk pie lover and he said it tasted like the real thing.  Just was upset I didn't have the chocolate curls on it.

Great recipe. But there are some things to consider. If you are going to ad a layer of whip cream doubling the recipe may not be necessary. If you do double it only add 1 cup of sugar total other wise it is way too sweet. It is not necessary to double the butter however leave that at 1/2 cup.
I also had the problem of the pie tasting granular. And just when I was about to toss it out and start over with powdered sugar the granules went away. The key is to beat it on high not medium for 5 minutes each egg. I didn't use real eggs either I used the stuff in the box. Turned out great. If you don't have a stand mixer I would say to use powdered sugar off of the bat. If you do have a stand mixer make it!! It is a great pie but beat the living daylights out of it so its not grainy!!

This did not set up at all. It had the consistency and taste of melted chocolate ice cream in a pie shell. Don't go through all the trouble of making this when you can get the same results by melting ice cream...I followed the recipe, beat the eggs for as long as it said and it still didn't work. And I agree it didn't make all that much either.

In all my years of baking I have never made a French Silk Pie.  My new DH loves them, so of course I had to make one for him.  Look no further.  This is the one to use.  I did not change a thing.  Excellent!

I doubled the recipe as others suggested and it fit perfectly in the graham cracker pie crust.  I'm not sure if this was supposed to happen, but the filling ended up having chunks---it looked like I had crushed oreo cookies in it.  I noticed this started forming when I put the 3rd egg in.  In the end, it tasted smooth with the occasional chocolate chunks which tasted just fine to me and the guests.  Yes, I will make this again!

It's very good but I'm going to cut the chocolate down an oz next time I think. The only reason it would be grainy is because of not beating it enough. Taste it, if it's grainy keep beating. The runnyness & low volume is because something was too warm & the butter got too soft. My kitchen was about 80 degrees so mine started to get too runny after the 3rd egg. I put a bowl of ice & water under the mixing bowl & kept beating. You will see it firm up & the volume will increase. I made a 9 1/2" & it was almost to the top.

I did some altering on this to make it into bars for a work thing. Did a graham cracker crust, and tripled all the ingredients. Used an 11x13 bar pan, and boy was it a hit!

This filling was fantastic coming right out of the mixing bowl, but after chilling, it was dense and crumbly. The flavor is great, the texture is just lacking. It was smooth- no grit like others had- and right from the mixer, it was fluffy and really outstanding. I did have to make a double batch to fill a standard pie, so be sure to double it. I think next time I make it (I think there will be a next time- it's good enough to warrant some tweaking) I will either serve it shortly after mixing it, or I'll whip some cream to fold in to soften it up some.

SO good!! I doubled the recipe to *generously* fill a deep dish pie crust. I used egg beaters and used 1 1/4 C sugar instead of 1 1/2 Cups since many reviewers complained of it being overly sweet. I made this the night before and let it chill in the refrigerator about 24 hours before garnishing it with whipped cream & chocolate curls and finally serving it. As long as you beat the butter sugar mixture well initially and try to keep all the ingredients as close to the same temp as possible...you shouldn't end up with a grainy texture because mine was *silky* smooth!

This was my first attempt at French Silk pie and it came out fantastic.  I used a 9" Marie Calender's frozen pie crust and there was plenty of filling for it--just the right amount in fact.  Any more would've been too much.  I served it with store bought whipped topping.  Delicious as it is, I have to admit I can only handle this pie in small servings as it's quite rich.

I just made this on Sunday...I followed the directions exactly and it turned out PERFECT!  My partner loved it and wants me to make it again.  A question:  has anyone made this with Splenda (for a low carb) desert??

A wonderful recipe....!

This pie is fabulous! This was my first attempt at a french silk pie, and it turned out perfect. I love that it's a lighter dessert and I don't feel like I'm gaining weight with every bite. My husband loved it also. It's definitely worth the effort to beat the eggs for the length of time that the recipe states. This one is a keeper! Thanks Ruth.

Excellent! I accidentally used semisweet chocolate, but cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. The consistency was perfect right off the bat and just got better with the five minute beatings. I used 3 oz of chocolate, 3 eggs, and 3/4 c. butter since I had a 9 inch deep dish pie shell. I should have doubled the recipe. The only reason I can see that some didn't come out right was either the chocolate wasn't completely cooled, or they didn't follow the 5 minute between egg rule. I finished with whipped, sweetened bakers cream and grated chocolate on top. Everyone loved it. Thank you!  (In case someone sees they've read this review before, it's because I accidentally posted it on a different silk pie recipe.  Oops!)

I use a similar recipe, however I use powdered sugar to avoid the grainy texture.  I also use 5 eggs, whipping with the whisk attachment for 5 minutes between each egg.  It has been a no fail for years, with PLENTY of filling !

Good recipe. Found it too sweet though. I would only use half a cup of sugar, using half of it for the egg white meringue. I would also make sure to thoroughly mix the sugar into the butter mixture so that there is no grainy texture.

The first time I ever tried French Silk Pie was at my favorite eatery, and since that has gone out of business, I have been craving this delicious pie. It takes a long time to make the filling, but let me tell you that it is worth every second you put into it. I did do a few things to speed up the process. After melting the chocolate, I put it in the refrigerator so it would cool completely, and a little bit faster. In my opinion, it didn't change a thing. I also doubled the recipe, which personally, I didn't think was necessary. If you put in the time and effort, the filling is naturally fluffy, and expands to fit in a pie pan. Doubling the recipe did give me an extra pie, which I am very grateful for because it allowed me to taste test it before I show it off tomorrow, at Thanksgiving Dinner.  I will be putting on whipped cream once I get to the dinner, and garnishing with chocolate chips, as I have no chocolate shavings. Pictures to come, if I can manage to take them before my family devours it. This is definitely a repeat recipe.

Delicious! When I follow the directions, this comes out great. I don't recommend doubling the butter, which I accidentally did the last time I made this pie. The flavor is still good, but the consistency is quite firm. My husband still ate it, of course - but I prefer it with the amount of butter actually indicated in the recipe. :0) I like to make fresh whipped cream and spread over the entire pie, then top with chocolate shavings.

Awesome recipe. As is mentioned by Barb, it's missing a few steps. So here's what I did:

I separated the eggs (make absolutely sure there is no yolk in the whites, a single speck of yellow will ruin your whites. Also, if you use 3-4 day old eggs the whites will be thicker than that of fresh eggs), then I beat the whites until they formed soft peaks and slowly added 1/4 cup of the sugar to them and continued to beat until they formed stiff peaks. I only have one stand mixer, so I moved the whites into a separate container and then creamed the butter, vanilla, and the rest of the sugar together. I added the eggs and chocolate and beat for about 2-3 mins before folding in the egg whites and beat for about another minute. I used a store bought chocolate pie crust and it filled it up perfectly. There was even a little too much filling, so I just ate that and it was wonderful.

I will definitely make this again, it's a major hit at family gatherings and it's really not a lot of work. Next time I will double the recipe, but only so that I can bring two pies with me.

This was a big hit in my household.  Husband and son both enjoyed this pie.  I did make more filling since I was filling a 9" shell.  I used 1 1/2 sticks butter 1 cup sugar, 3 eggs and 3 squares of unsweetened baking chocolate.  This is absolutely to die for chocolate pie!

This is a very yummy pie! I followed another reviewer's suggestions, and made a meringue from sugar and egg whites, and then folded that into the chocolate mixture. It makes the perfect amount of filling.

Excellent! Use a deep dish pie crust, make 1 1/2 recipes, use good quality dark choc and top with real whipped cream. I would recommend a stand mixer too!

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because further directions were needed. This was my first time to make a chocolate silk pie, so i was not sure what to expect. First, doubling is necessary. Second, I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet baking chocolate bars(the entire 4oz bar). I expected the grittyness to disappear once it had been whisked on high for 15 minutes, but it was not. The grittyness does not go away until you have added and whipped all your eggs into the mix for each 5minute period. Dont give up it will go away! (Also scrape the sides of the bowl in-between eggs to insure all sugar is in the mixture).I used a pastry shell and did not use graham cracker crust, as this pie is so decadent it really calls for a buttery flaky crust. If you use the semi sweet chocolate you can cut back on the sugar some as it can get very sweet. The pie set nicely in the fridge as hoped. Garnish with whip topping piped around the edges and a sprinkle of chocolate shaving for a pie that looks as good as it tastes!

A few secrets. Use only real butter, some margarines work but its hit and miss. Second, if you have a stand mixer, set it to cream the butter and sugar and walk away, seriously. I have fallen asleep waiting before...LOL. It will be very very soft, but the granuals in the sugar will be completely broken and smooth. Scrap the beaters and put the bowl in the fridge to reset the butter and when it is cold and firm again contiue the recipe as follows. Also do not replace chocolate squares with cocoa powder it will not set right every time. It will be smooth as silk and set every time. We have been making this pie for every celebration for 50 years and running. LOL. Die hard chocolaholics...LOL

This pie was excellent. But I have learned to pay attention to feed back. Some feedback seems to be personal preference, but some times it can really be helpful. I choose 3 changes that I think made a big difference. 1) Double recipe for a 9" pie plate. 2)use 1C powdered sugar in chocolate mix. 3) Add egg yokes to chocolate mix, and beat egg whites until stiff, then slowly add 1/2C granulated sugar to the whipped egg whites. After mixing chocolate, fold in egg whites. I used 2oz unsweet chocolate and 2oz bitter sweet. It turned out excellent. I also used (Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust)

Yum, ate more of this than I should have.  I made sure to beat for the full five minutes after each egg and the filling was as smooth as could be.

This is a suprisingly good and easy filling. I was aprehensive because of the reviews that state there wasn't enough filling. The first time I made this with a regular pre-baked pie shell, following the recipe exactly, and I had plenty of filling. The second time I made this pie with a chocolate graham craker crust, a layer of chocolate chips and then the filling, and it was amazing.

Taste and texture was excellent!!  Very rich and heavy though so be sure to cut tiny pieces!

After reading other reviews I doubled the recipe and ended up with enough filling for two pies!  I think if you whip for five minutes after each egg addition as instructed (I used a KitchenAid mixer) you will end up with enough filling especially if you plan to top the pie with whipped cream.  I did "frost" it with whipped cream but made sure to avoid too much confectioner's sugar in my whipped cream.  The pie is sweet enough even with a little less sugar.  This pie tasted superb--just like a store-bought French Silk.  I was worried about texture because of the granulated sugar I used but it really did turn out smooth because of the whipping.  After a night in the fridge though it became more fudge-like so I'd advise consuming it the same day you make it.

This recipe was delicious, like other reviewers I doubled the batch to fill out a 9in. deep dish pie crust. I used heavy whipping cream as well with some powdered sugar until the sweetness was desired. My fiance ate a whole pie by himself!! I made 4 of them for Christmas and they were a huge hit!! A family member could of sworen it was a "Bakers Square" pie due to the flavor. This is one of my favorites and will remain a number 1 on my list.

This is sooo easy. Do NOT over beat it if you are using a stand mixer. It will be dry. But done right it is really good. I used 1/2 cup less sugar, we like it a little less sweet.

I used the pie filling to make ice cream sandwiches.  I just put the fluff between two gram crackers and dunked the sides in grated chocolate.  Then i froze them.  My BF who loves french silk pie gobbled them up.

Awesome!  Others are correct, that there is not much filling for a regular sized pie crust.  I bought a tub of whipped topping and put that on top with some shaved chocolate.

This works.  For those who are getting a gritty texture, you are just not beating long or hard enough.  It really does take five minutes after each egg to make that silky texture.  I thought I was going to end up with a gritty mess at one stage, but it was perfect!  I got a lot of compliments on this one, and will definitely make again.  The only thing I wasn't keen on was the texture of piecrust pastry with the silky pie - it kinda spoiled the effect!  A friend suggested that it might work with a cookie-crumb base, like you would make for a cheesecake; I might try that next time.

I have a recipe very similar to this.  The only differences in the ingredients are the amount of chocolate (3 ounces rather than 2 ounces) and vanilla (1.5 teaspons rather than just 1 teaspoon) and unsalted butter rather than regular butter. But my method is a lot more beating.  I beat the sugar and butter for 5 minutes at high speed before adding the eggs.  I add both eggs at the same time and beat for another 4 minutes.  I then add the melted, cooled chocolate and vanilla and beat for another 8 minutes (6 minutes if using superfine sugar).  I also serve with whipped cream and use a cookie crust (made with Nabisco Famous Wafers).  I have made it this way several times and it has never come up gritty.  And it is delicious!

I read the reviews multiple times before starting. I whipped my egg whites separately as one reviewer suggested until they formed stiff peaks  & then whisked  them in equal amounts with each yolk for the suggested 5 min each time.  I also doubled the ingredients as many suggested. The pie was full in a 9 " pan, the flavor was nice, but could've been less sweet, but my greatest disappointment was the texture. No matter how much whisking I did in a stand mixer, it was entirely too grainy.  With all the prep I put into it, I just expected more.

This pie was really easy to make! But it came out way too sweet because I doubled the recipe like many of the reviews suggested. My suggestion - if you don't want to be eating granules and crunching on every bite of your 'silk' pie, leave the sugar to about one cup. Other than that, it would have been perfect.

This pie is fantastic as I've made it probably close to a dozen times for gatherings and there's never any leftovers. Honestly, I've never made it with real eggs as I've always substituted with Egg Beaters until today. We'll see how it goes with the real eggs.

I only gave it 4 stars because like a lot of other reviewers, this recipe does not make enough filling for an entire pie. I highly recommend doubling the ingredients and if you have leftovers, I usually put it in a bowl and eat it later.

I don't recommend using whip cream as it melts too quickly and you can make your own homemade whip cream fairly easily for about the same price as store bought. All you need is 1 cup heavy whipping cream, 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. You mix all three together and beat it with an electric mixer on medium to medium high until you form stiff peaks. You will then have a great tasting homemade whipped topping that won't melt.

Wonderful!!! Make sure to beat after each egg the full 5 min. I also doubled the recipe, but I think 1 1/2 would have been enough. So easy and delicious! 
Also, I added some confectoner's sugar at the end to sweeten it up a bit.

Taking the recommendations of other reviewers, I doubled the recipe. I attempted to rid the pie of its grainy texture by separately beating the egg whites; sadly this didn't work for me, but because of this pie's great flavor and richness, it is still five stars to me! I used a 9-in pastry shell. I let the pie chill for four hours in the fridge, then decorated it with cool whip, two squares of Ghirardelli dark chocolate, and cocoa powder. yummy :)

I make this every Thanksgiving and would be in a lot of trouble from my family if I didn't.  I do half vanilla, half almond and the result is just plain awesome.  

You do need to DOUBLE this recipe for one pie, the first year I did not and had to use whipped topping for the top half of the pie. (Was still good) Be SURE to beat with the whisk attachment on your mixer for 5 minutes between eggs.  I set a timer.  This ensures a smooth filling with no grainy texture.

This makes an extremely rich pie and most people are fine with a tiny slice.  But it is always the first one devoured!

Absolutely delicious!  I changed the servings to 12 (per another rater) and the filling fit perfectly in a 9 inch premade chocolate crust.  This pie received rave reviews from my guests.  I served it with Reddi Whip and it just melted in our mouths.  Will make again and again!

Fantastic!  This pie was the hit of our Thanksgiving.  I changed it to 12 servings for a 9.5-inch pie plate and used egg beaters.  Topped it with some homemade whipping cream - YUM!  THANK YOU for a new family favorite!

Looking for a better recipe, but this one did the trick for Thanksgiving.  :)  We tossed in a little whipping cream, which made the filling quite creamy and frothy.  :)

So easy to make!  My husband and I love it!  Made as is, I did have to beat the butter and sugar for a long time to avoid the grainy texture.    Definitly a keeper!

ok, i made this pie many times, add your favorite liquor instead of vanilla, extra fine granulated sugar other than regular gran sug. eggs are not all alike if they aren`t pastureized you can(not necessary) giv`em a few seconds in boiling water or even wash them to loose that pasture, yuck lol

I read the reviews for this pie and then made it following the instructions.  I really cannot understand the problems some people were having.  I used the paddle on my mixer to do the first four ingredients and then changed over to the whisk for the eggs.  I beat the filling a little longer than 5 minutes after adding each egg.  My filling turned out perfectly - not gritty or liquid-y.  The filling did not fill the crust completely to the top, but that is perfect for adding a layer of whipped cream over the top of the entire pie.   If you used more filling, the pie would be way too rich to eat more than a tiny slice.  I did decide that the filling didn't have enough chocolate flavor when I got done, so I melted another 1 oz square and added that.  I will definitely make this pie again with 3 oz of unsweetened chocolate.

Great pie!  There seem to be a lot of complaints about the texture being grainy but I don't think anyone has suggested using "baker's sugar".  Worked for me!

OK OK.... so I have now made this 3 times and felt confused by all of the ideas and advice everyone was giving. I have tried a ton of things and have it figured out.... I make a batch and 1/2 of the filling and it is a perfect amount of filling. Also, after trying many different techniques for ingredients and what to add first I went back to the original recipe and it worked just as good as all the other ways everyone was recommending. Finally I whipped each egg 7 minutes and no grain- be patient- it’s worth it! Try not to make this a bigger deal that it is! It just comes down to needing a bit more filling and a lot of time in the mixer. But all is good! And the pie is wonderful! Crowd pleaser!

This pie was so easy to make!  Granted, my hand electric mixer had its job cut for it after using it for 10 minutes straight during the egg adding part, but it was well worth it!  The chocolate mixture came out so smooth!  I only had milk chocolate morsels that i melted in a double boiler.  For the pie crust I used a homemade pie crust recipe from this site.  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!

Wonderful!!!  My mom has been making this recipe for years and I've always loved it.  I make 1.5 recipes for a 9 inch pie crust.  I'm pregnant and was worried about the raw eggs.  I made it a few days ago with pasteurized eggs "egg beaters" and it never set up so I threw it out.  I tried again today with egg beaters and it set up perfectly.  I think the key is making sure the butter is room temperature.  If the butter is too cold, it will be a grainy texture an never fully set up no matter how long you beat it.

Pretty good. I thought the filling was a little heavy -- and there wasn't enough to fill the pie shell. I made a whipped cream topping to fill it out.  Next time I might try whipping the egg whites and folding them into the mixture to give it more volume and lightness.

as others suggested - I doubled everything EXCEPT the chocolate. Use the paddle for butter and sugar. It will still be a bit grainy even after 10 minutes of mixing, but it works out after you add the eggs. I also switched to wisk attachment for the eggs and beat for several minutes after each egg...just like Popping Fresh French Silk! MMMmmm

Fantastic recipe!  I have had trouble with this pie turning out grainy.  Yuck!  Thanks to this recipe and the tips of reviewers it turned out fabulous!!  The key is to use the whisk attachment when adding the eggs and watching the clock.  Three minutes after each egg was perfect.  I used whole (in the shell) pasteurized eggs I found at Safeway.  They are pricey, but worth the cost to know you won't send anyone home with food poisoning!  Thank you so much for the great tips.  I love this pie!

This pie cured my craving for Baker's Square many times over! I tried a similar recipe on Pillsbury's website that advised beating only 2 min. after each egg, and the pie came out smooth (not grainy) but very dense. With this recipe the filling was light. I gave it 4 instead of 5 b/c I like it a little sweeter, so I subbed half of unsweetened chocolate with semisweet chocolate. Also, I think whipped cream is a must with this pie. I used Easy Whipped Cream with extra powdered sugar. Overall, super yummy!

This was a great recipe. I made 2 pies. The first was good, but a little gritty, the sugar wouldn't desolve. But the second was great. I took out a little sugar. I also whipped up the egg yolks into a meringue using 1/4 c sugar. This resulted in a fluffier, lighter pie! Everyone loved it, escpecially my chocolate-crazed aunt! I will definetly make this again!

Mine was not grainy in the slightest. For those that are having problems, mix mix mix mix mix. I mixed the butter and sugar mixture for a good 15 minutes. Then I mixed 3 to 5 minutes with each egg. At the end i let it mix for another 5 minutes or so. Smooth as silk. I doubled the filling as others suggested and had enough for two pies. I used a standard Pillsbury pre-made pie crust. So if you are using a deep dish, double the filling.  If you are using a standard pie crust, you don't need to. Also, I used cocoa powder in place of the cooled chocolate.

This was time consuming but it is worth mixing for the time allowed. I doubled everything except the eggs (only used two). I do agree that it was a bit grainy, but everyone ate it so fast that I doubt they even noticed. I will make this again.

I was trying out my new stand mixer and picked this to make.  I doubled the recipe based on other feedback, and I used bittersweet chocolate since I had some on hand.  A generic pie shell went well with it.  It made a nice 9-inch pie.  I beat the thing f-o-r-e-v-e-r, but it was still very gritty with the sugar not dissolving.  It tastes good, but who wants a gritty pie (full of raw eggs, which scares me a little)?  I'll not give it one star just in case it was something I did wrong, but I won't be making it again.

This was really good! I doubled it as suggested and was going to lessen the sugar as well, but my boyfriend was doing that pie while I was making another pie for Christmas and he forgot to cut the sugar. I was a little too much, but tuned out wonderful! Everyone loved it.  thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  I made a few minor changes, using egg beaters instead of eggs since I have issues with eating/serving raw eggs. I also used super fine baking sugar and put that in with the butter in my kitchen aide for 5 minutes, then adding the vanilla to make sure everything was well mixed. I wound up serving in martini glasses as a "mousse" since I forgot my pie crust was in the oven. I think I will tuck a sugar cookie into the "pie" when I serve it for the crust portion.

Delicious and really easy to make. *Make sure to mix for the full 5 minutes after each egg.* This was incredibly rich and chocolatey. I probably won't make it for a while because it was too sweet for my sweetheart, but I loved it.

I made this pie today and I can already tell from the leftover amount that has chilled for an hour and a half that I did something wrong. The texture is grainy from all the sugar. I doubled the recipe because of what other reviewers said about it not being enough to fill a pie crust. It tastes good -- just has a grainy texture. Anyone know why?

Wonderful.  This is just what I was looking for.  I like to eat it like a mousse though and so I just serve it in goblets as opposed to in a pie crust.  I agree with the other post that says that this won't fill a whole pie crust.  I think that doubling it would do that though.  Wonderful taste and texture.  Thank you.

This pie was delicious!  Rich and creamy.  Beating the eggs for the full 5 minutes really does the trick.  My first attempt at a French silk, and I'll never need to look for another recipe!  Thank you!

WOW! This came out so good I was honestly very surprised. I know alot of people are uncomfortable using raw eggs now I haven't tried this out but I know that you can buy pasteurized eggs in a carton at the supermarket it might be worth a try for those of us who are less adventurous!

I made this for Valentine's day because my husband is a chocoholic.  It was wonderful.  I used a chocolate pie shell and topped it with whipped cream.  Thanks!

We love this recipe!  I was looking for a chocolate pie that used the ingredients I had on hand and this was it.  I've made it several times and it turns out each time.  I use cocoa powder and oil to substitute for the melted chocolate.  To make sure I beat it for the full amount of time, I set a timer.  I've never had a problem with it setting up or with the texture being gritty, it turns out perfectly each time.  I've used almond extract when I ran out of vanilla, and I've covered the pie with a layer of Cool Whip, then added grated chocolate for a lovely pie.  This is my husband's favorite pie now.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The pie did not set.  It was chilled in the refrigerator for more than 4 hours.  The taste was good and was not gritty, but it was mush.

My mom made this recipe for Easter and it turned out terrible.  I've never known of a recipe that calls for eggs and you don't bake it.  It didn't set up at all and tasted "gritty".  Good thing I made a dessert or we wouldn't have had one that was edible.  I would definately NOT recommend this recipe..its a disastor!

Man, this recipe is AWESOME. This is the easiest and best recipe for a pie I have ever had. I can't believe how great it is. I made it for a Thanksgiving party for those non-pumpkin fans and it was a hit, Thanks for this recipe! I'm glad I didn't choose something else!

This is an excellent chocolate pie. It's rich, creamy, and decadent. 
Here are some tips to help you get it right.

1. Use a stand mixer if you have one. If not an electric hand mixer will work, it just takes more time and effort.
2. Beat the butter and sugar until it's light and fluffy, then beat it some more, and some more.
3. Add the eggs as described, and beat it, and beat it, and beat it some more.
4. Add the chocolate and beat it, and beat it, and beat it.
5. Chill the mixture.
6. When it's chilled through beat it, and beat it, and, well you get the idea.
7. Keep checking as you go to see if the sugar is still grainy. If it is just keep beating it, it'll eventually get smooth, creamy, and fluffy.

For an 8 in pan use the quantities as listed and it'll be just about right. For a 9 inch pan a one and a half recipe fills it nicely.

If you whip the eggs for the length of time recommended (I did a full 5-7 minutes for each egg addition), it becomes a light fluffy filling.  No need to double recipe.  Make sure you use the wire whisk.

I substitute the sugar for the same amount of Baker's Sugar (NOT Confectioner's Sugar) for a lighter and smoother pie filling.

This is a good pie if you are familiar with French silk and love the airy consistency along with the verrrrry sweet taste. This was too sweet for the adults although the kids gobbled it up. I would decrease the sugar or perhaps stick to a mousse  which I prefer for depth of flavor and texture. But like I said if this is a classic silk pie then it's spot on and I agree to whip eggs 5 min each with wire whisk. Used Oreo pie crust and whipped cream.

This is a wonderful recipe, just double the ingredients and you'll be fine. I've never,  repeat never, had a problem with this recipe and I've made it many times.  Doubling the recipe and yes, beating five minutes ( okay, four) between each egg will make enough filling to mound up in the 9 inch pie shell. I top with whipped cream from a piping bag and sprinkle the top with chocolate sprinkles and toasted sliced almonds. 

The whole secret to this pie filling is the beating between each egg. Makes it truly live up to its silky name!

I've tried to make this twice. I whipped those eggs forever but once I added in the chocolate mix the mixture was fluffed again and STILL was only enough for half a pie. Double the recipe so you have enough filling for a standard pie crust. I was very disappointed!!!

I had plenty enough filling for what the recipe called for an 8 inch pie crust. If you try to use a deep dish pie crust you will have to double the recipe that's what a deep dish pie crust does it's common sense.

Oh my! It was so so soooo wonderful!!!  I read some previous reviews, so I added less sugar, and did mixed faster after adding each egg, and also mixed a couple of minutes after all eggs were added.  
The filling turned out to be silky smooth, and tasted rich chocolate!!  I understand some reviewers experienced gritty texture in the filling. I also did when I was mixing butter and sugar, and I started doubting a little about the recipe. But keep mixing until butter and sugar get lighter and after adding eggs.  Actually, when I started mixing with eggs, the grit texture was gone, and the filling becomes so smooth!!!  To get a little more filling, you will need to mix (or beat) the filling after adding each egg quite well (faster!). If you have a stand mixer, it will help you! Please try again!

I just made this pie and the taste is GREAT! I had a quart of heavy whipping cream to use up and so I decided to use this pie to help "get rid of it". So I doubled this recipe for two pies - which worked out well. For adding the eggs I did 3 minutes for the first 2 eggs and 5 minutes on medium high speed for the last two eggs (using the stand mixer). YUM! Then it turns out that the whipped cream is clumpy. So... I have 2 French Silk pies...what a problem to have! Yes it is "thin" but the flavor is good.

Thanks to Ruth for posting such a delicious and easy to make recipe.  After reading other reviews, I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup on the second batch.  After adding some raspberries, fresh whipped cream, and cocoa powder, the family inhaled the mini-pies.

I made this recipe, and the flavor was good, but the filling was very dense after sitting in the refrigerator.  Any idea why?  Perhaps I over beat the eggs?

I followed this recipe exactly with one exception.  I beat the ingredients on 3 because my speed 2 does not work on my hand mixer.  I used a metal bowl and mixed until my butter and sugar were almost white.  I beat the eggs for the full 5 minutes each.  Because I like to put things away as I go, I also added the vanilla to the chocolate before it was completely cooled and it bubbled and made the chocolate thicken up. (not sure I would do this again, but it didn't seem to matter)  I am making chocolate cream puffs with this instead of a pie.  From the amount of filling I have, I can't imagine that this would not be more than enough for a 9 inch pan.  Most mistakes that are made with baking are not taking the time to beat things as long as the recipe states or not doing things in the correct order.

This turned out fantastic.  We doubled the recipe to fit into a deep dish pie crust (about 2 inches).  We made it following the instructions exactly and it fit into the pie crust perfectly.  I would highly recommend letting this set in the fridge overnight.  Make sure to wait 5 minutes in between eggs, we had to be extra patient waiting 20 minutes.  As far as the raw eggs, I'm not an expert, but as far as I understand it, Salmonella is extremely rare these days and even if a batch of eggs is infected it is quickly pulled from the shelves once anything is reported.  As long as you don't fit into one of the at risk categories you have very little to worry about.   For example, we didn't allow our 1 or 3 year old to have any of the pie.  Thats just my two cents, do your own research.

When I made a lot of changes to this recipe it came out great. I did what Barb suggested, whipping in two more egg whites and 1/4 a cup of sugar. Also, I used cocoa powder and some melted chocolate to make a greater chocolate taste. Came out great :3 

I can't give this a 5 stars because the recipe itself was not completed.

Seriously decadent!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I made 1.5x the filling.  It ended up filling the crust to normal pie depth. However, my dinner guests thought it too rich to eat a regular sized slice (1/8 of pie).  Next time I will either cut pie into 16ths or use original filling amount and use whip cream to bring filling to crust height.  Or maybe I will make these as little tartlets.

I was so hoping for better...not as chocolate-y as I expected and a little grainy from the sugar and I followed directions exactely and even watched the video for this. I was impressed though how mixing for 5 minutes per egg really made this mixture rich and creamy. Just a little disappointed bout flavor and texture here. I also think it may have been too sweet, maybe less sugar and maybe instead of granulated sugar, confectioners?? Oh well, I tried but probably wont try again with this recipe. I used Oreo cookies and made Chocolate Wafer Crust from this site for this pie. Thanks.

Made this for my chocolate pie loving dad on Father's Day ~ it was inhaled with paroxysms of joy.  I'm now making it for Thanksgiving with a few alterations: I used eggbeaters for safety's sake, so I beat for 5 minutes after each 1/4 of a cup of the eggbeaters, until I reached 3/4 cup (equivalent 3 eggs).  No need to double the recipe if you do this! I used a pre-made graham cracker crust for a time-saver, and it was delicious.  Finally, I put in 3/4 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of almond extract.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

once it all comes together the flavor is so good. looking at the ingredients singly it looks like nothing special but after adding the final ingredient the filling is phenomenal. Two years ago was my first time making or tasting a homemade french silk and i was blown away. I top mine with real whipped cream and some chocholate curls (aka chunks lol) and everyone really enjoys it. I do try and use farm fresh eggs when I can making this pie but if i cant get my hands on them I buy organic and just grab the one with the furthest experation date....because of the raw eggs it just seems like the fresher the better. I do whip for a few minutes after each addition too, and after you leave the pie in the fridge a few hours it sets beautifully (because of all that butter :P )

I never, never write reviews, but had to take the time in this one!  I read through a bunch of the reviews, and couldn't decide if I should double it or not.  In the end, I decided to follow the recipe.  It turned put sooo creamy and rich!  It was amazing.  I read one review that talked about the mixture needing to be cold, and that is what made all the difference.  I live in Spain, and it's in the 110's...impossibly hot.  Even with air-conditioning, it's not like the states where you can get your house cool.  I had whipped this thing for all the time required...followed the directions like it said, but it was still soupy.  I decided to try to put it in the feezer for 10-15 minutes.  The edges had just begun to freeze, and I beat it again for the 5 min, and this time it thickened right up and changed from that dark color to the light brown color it's supposed to have.  It was decadent.  It is so rich, though, it really does need the layer of whipped cream (like a normal French silk has) to balance out the richness.  But, either way, without doubling the recipe, I had enough filling for a 9 in. pie... The key was to make sure the mixture was cold, cold, cold!  Unbelievably delicious!

I've made this pie several times now--most recently with a chocolate graham cracker crust--Yum!  As some reviewers have said, the recipe doesn't make a ton of filling--but it's so rich!  I top it with fresh whipped cream and to me, it's the perfect chocolate pie. If the mix doesn't fluff up enough--as happened to me once in a very hot kitchen--try putting the bowl in the refrigerator for a little while and then beat some more.  Worked great for me. Thanks for this delicious recipe!

Good flavor, but I must have done something wrong; mine did not set well, and I ended up having to freeze it--no one complained; French Silk Ice Cream Pie was a hit.

I was having Mom in for Christmas Dinner & she said she wanted Chocolate Pie. I had never made one & came across this recipe. It seemed easy enough & the reviews were great. 

I followed the recipe exactly & it came out perfect. I used an Oreo ready made pie crust. It could have been higher to fill the shell, but in my opinion that wasn't necessary. With the shell filled this amount the sizes were perfect. 

Mom loved it & said it was "Better than Perkins" Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Good the first time I made it! Thought, out of the two pies I made, one ended up in the deep freezer for over three months...It was even more delicious then! Wonderful recipe, will do this again!

I'm in love! I always make the chocolate pie for our (large) Thanksgiving family gathering, and I know this will be a huge hit this year! I appreciate the suggestions to increase the amounts of the ingredients for a more fully filled pie. I trebled the recipe to fill two 8 inch chocolate cookie crumb crusts. I use an organic granulated sugar, which is a little on the course side, and so at first I was concerned that the grainy texture would not smooth out, but by the addition of the two final eggs (obediently beating in for 5 minutes after each egg - thank goodness for my KitchenAid!) I could see that the texture was smoothing out. Indeed the result is a wonderfully silky, smooth and rich chocolate decadence! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Mmm, mmm.  Really easy to make, and dense, but mine did not get even a third of the height of the slice pictured.  The consistency was perfect though, and I think that you could easily double or triple it in a spring-form pan with cookie crust for the effect pictured.  I've served it in a coconut crust and a shortbread crust, both of which are yummy combinations.  Using really good chocolate makes a difference in overall taste.  It doesn't really even need whipped cream, it is just that rich.

My family loved this.  Made an oreo cookie crust using 1-1/2 cups crushed oreos & 3 Tlbs. melted butter.  Mix the butter & crushed oreos together and press into you pie pan, Bake @ 350 for 10 - 15 minutes. Let the crust cool and then fill with the filling (make sure that you whip the filling really well).  Enjoy!

This recipe turned out grainy and not good. I followed the recipe as written and beat the mixture on high speed for longer than listed and it still didn't turn out. It's edible but I wouldn't recommend it.

This is a great recipe and very similar to mine but I substitute the melted baking chocolate for 3T baking cocoa and 1 T. vegetable oil. I think it gives it a better flavor. I also double the recipe for more filling. My family and friends all rave about it. :)

Very Rich but I love rich :) I can see how it may be overpowering for the weaker ones. I didn't have any problems with it being grainy but I do have a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and let the eggs whisk up for 5 mins a piece. Giving it only 4 stars because the wife thought it was too rich.

So I was paranoid after reading all the reviews, and doubled the recipe for my first attempt. It was way too much. The pie was filled to the top in the [premade] Oreo crust, plus leftovers! Weird thing though...we never got around to eating it that day, and the next day it was hard and didn't taste good. It had tasted so good in the bowl, so I dunno what happened overnight to kill it. 

Anyway, I made it again last week exactly as written (no beating the egg whites or any fancy tricks!), and I had plenty of filling! Use a good quality mixer and give each egg the whole five minutes and you'll be all right. Mine was the color of chocolate milk, it set up nicely, and everyone LOVED it. I got all conceited and started bragging, hahaha. 

From now on, I won't use the store-bought crusts, they're never that good, they don't do the pie justice. So just mix up two dozen Oreos with a few tablespoons of butter.

This pie was DELICIOUS!!!  I did make some variations like many others.  I doubled the recipe with the exceptionof only 1 cup of sugar.  Probably after the 3rd minute into the 3rd egg is when the grittiness of the sugar really started to go away.  I used a frozen pie crust baked in the oven, lite cool whip and half a Hershey cholocate bar for garnish on the top!  My husband told me the pie was better then Baker's Square!  Thank you!

I used bakers sugar to ensure a non gritty texture and I doubled the vanilla as I do in every recipe that calls for vanilla. I used Ruth's grandma's pie crust and the results were- Not a piece was left! It is super light and fluffy but very rich and scrumptious

If you feel you don't have enough filling, just add another egg.  That is all it takes.  I have always put 3 eggs in my French Silk Pie for years and it makes the perfect amount.

This pie is very eazy and really good, I was looking for more of an ice box pie, so the textur wasn't what I wanted me off. It is what it says "Silk" pie. Everyone really enjoyed it.

Delicious! I adjusted the servings to 18, so I would have more filling for the Oreo pie crust. With this adjustment, I added 5 eggs, beating 5 minutes after each addition. After the third egg, it was light and fluffy;  it deflated after the 4th egg. Next time I may just use three eggs. Or if I do add all five eggs, maybe I'll add 2, 2 and then 1 beating 5 minutes after each addition.

I cooked the eggs over a double boiler since I'm to scared to eat raw egg. The pie came out a bit gritty from the sugar. Next time I'll try putting the sugar in the egg over the double boiler to melt the sugar.

contrary to other reviews, if you make this right you do not have to double the recipe. i doubled the recipe and filled a deep dish pie shell and still had enough left over to fill a regular pie shell. i made sure i whipped the eggs after each addition 7 minutes just to make sure i had it whipped enough. if you refrigerate this after making i would suggest  taking it out of the fridge before serving to let it warm back up so it does not have a thick consistency. this pie is worth the time it takes to make it.

My family really liked this! I didn't have any vanilla, so I just didn't use any, and it still tasted great. I doubled the chocolate and sugar and used 3 eggs, and it fit really nicely into the pie pastry. Rich and delicious!

This is the firs time I've attempted a French silk pie.  It tasted great and my kids loved it, but it is very 'soft'.  I had to scoop it out of the pan and it was just runny and sloppy.  I don't know what I did wrong. I made 1-1/2 of the recipe, so used 3 eggs.  The consistency seemed better after only 2 eggs.  I beat 5 minutes per egg as directed.  I really want to make it again- any sugggestions? Nobody else seems to have this problem- texture was smooth and silky, just runny.  Help!

I have made this 3 times and each time it comes out better.  My parents enjoy it very much.  The key is to beat the eggs for the full 5 minutes each.  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust and topped it with whipped cream.

I was disappointed in this pie.  Part of it was because I evidently perfer cream pies.  I had never made or eaten French Silk Pie before.  I think it tastes more like a cake icing than a pie filling.  Also, no matter how long I beat the mixture with the eggs, it was still gritty/grainy.  The sugar would not incorporate into a smooth mixture.  I was going to take this to a dinner party tonight as dessert, but it is just too gritty.  I would be embarressed.  Into the trash it goes - off to figure out what else I can make in a short time.

What a delicious Pie this is... You must...and I repeat must mix for a FULL five minutes on medium speed after EACH egg addition for this recipe. If you don't - it WILL be grainy from the sugar. Besides that I doubled EVERYTHING in the recipe - I cut back on sugar (used only 1 cup) because I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate instead of the unsweetened... LOVE IT... GREAT recipe!!!!

This was the best chocolate pie ever!   I used a grahmcracker crust and my mom used real whipping cream for the topping.  I didn't mention the raw eggs, I didn't want anyone to worry anyone for no reason.  The pie disappeared so fast at my family Thanksgiving.   I didn't change the recipe.  I just took my time with my stand mixer and let everything get nice and fluffy.

Followed the recipe as written, and it tasted great, despite being a bit dense.  (Should have read the reviews first!)  Next time, I will follow the advice to whip the egg whites seperately before folding into the chocolate mixture-- will certainly do the trick!

yummy and rich! doubled filling for one 9-inch crust. added egg yolk to heated chocolate to kind of "cook" it a little bit. Whipped for very long time in kitchen aid so there would be no grainy-ness

UPDATE: MY (NOW) FIANCE'S PARENTS FROZE LEFTOVERS. WHILE I WAS VISITING THIS WKEND., I HAD A SLICE. NOW THE TEXTURE IS JUST PLAIN W-I-E-R-D!!! Great pie! Made 2 pies last night - this pie & a coconut cream pie. I brought both to my parents & bf's parents dad's day get-2gethers. I pretty much followed Ruth's direct. to the ltr. EXCEPT for dbl. the ingred. in order to fill a 9 in. pre-baked pie shell. Dbl. everything worked perfectly!!!  After carefully reading the many reviews here, I have a few suggest. 1st, BE SURE your butter & eggs are RM. TEMP. (esp. the butter - it creams much easier this way). 2nd, BEAT THOROUGHLY after the add. of EA. egg!!!! I used my KitchenAid for this. As Gloria Lee directed, I 1st used the paddle attachment to cream my butter/sugar/choc. (it is also VERY impt. to allow your choc. to cool COMPLETELY - I melted my baking sq. in a dbl. boiler, then refilled the bottom pan w/ cold H2O & a few ice cubes), then removed the paddle, replaced it w/ the whisk attachment & beat EACH egg on HIGH speed for 5 min. The end result was perfectly whipped filling w/ no gritty text.! B4 serving (I covered everything w/ plastic wrap & refrigerated overnight), I generously topped my pie w/ Reddi-whip, choc. curls & a lt. sprinkling of baker's cocoa. My bf really liked this (he didn't touch the coconut pie lol!). Altough he prefers a less "rich" pie, he thinks this is worthy of making again. Thx. for sharing Ruth :)

Absolutely delicious!  I made the recipe exactly according to directions using my standing mixer with the whisk attachment for the eggs and it perfectly filled my 8-inch pie crust and wasn't the least bit grainy.

This recipe is fantastic but I found it a little light in taste so I added 1/4 cup of a very rich cocoa powder(right after the sugar!).  Also, I used organic cane sugar in the filling and it gave it a very nice texture.   The recipe I used for the crust was: Graham Cracker Crust I. With a few minor alterations so the taste of the crust married well with the filling: Sub sugar with Organic Cane sugar Sub 1/2 cup of the graham crumbs for 1/2 cup chocolate cookie crumbs Added tablespoon of cocoa powder Added the optional cinnimon but used a full teaspoon added an extra 1/4 tbsp of butter to make up for a little of the extra dry ingredients

My first attempt at a chocolate pie. It was very rich. I also learned that the recipe isn't kidding when it says you will end up mixing for a minimum of twenty minutes. My sugar didn't mix well, but that was my fault not the recipe.

Amazingly delicious! Used a double broiler for the chocolate, waited till it was almost melted and stirred in the rest of the chunks so it didn't get over heated. Put that in the freezer to cool fast (I am impatient). While that was cooling I creamed the other ingredients, including the 2 egg yolks, made sure everything was nice and fluffy before adding the yolks. Put that in the fridge to keep it cool. Fluffed the egg whites with a 1/4 a cup of the sugar for 5 minutes. Hand stirred the chocolate mixture into the egg whites. Easily delicious.

I've never had Chocolate silk pie before so I have nothing to compare it to but it was very good.  It wasn't soupy or grainy at all and it was more than enough for 8 individual pie shells.  I followed a previous reviewers advice and iced the sides of the bowl while beating in the eggs and it was nice and fluffy and plenty voluminous enough to fill an entire pie shell all the way up.

Really great recipe!! What I did to fill up the extra space [it really isn't enough filling and I didn't think of doubling the mix until I read the reviews] was make a batch of whipped cream and just piped that in and then sprinkeld chocolate over the whole thing.

My sister's and I have been making this pie for years, especially when we wanted to fulfill a chocolate craving. Which was pretty much every week! I also use a pre-made crust, dollop with whipped cream and top with toasted almonds. Excellent!

This pie was great!  I doubled the filling recipe, per the suggestions, and it turned out great!  My husband doesn't like cream based pies and this was a great alternative to that.  I let the mixer run with after I had added all the eggs and it turned out divine.  Thank you!

I don't know what happened, but mine never thickened up. I beat for a full five minutes after each egg, but it remained soupy. I had to add cool whip to give it some body. :(

Delicious and simple to make. I topped it with coffee flavored whipped cream. Also, the reason the reviewer with 3 stars didn't have enough filling is due to not reading the recipe. It makes an 8 inch pie not a 9 inch.

Per other reviewers, I doubled the filling (used 3 eggs) which filled a 9 inch deep dish pie crust to the top. I thought the pie was very sugary, so next time I plan to use 1/2 white sugar 1/2 powdered sugar.  I topped mine with homemade whipped cream.

I have been making this since I found it on this site 2 years ago. It is amazing! I have never had a problem with it not filling a pie crust. Follow the directions exactly and use the right size crust. It has been such a hit I have to make two for every holiday.

this is delicious.  everyone loved it!  you really have to whip the mixture for 5 minutes after each egg, so a stand mixer is a MUST for this recipe (especially when you double the filling to make a nice thick pie, or perhaps i am not patient enough to whip the mixture for 20 minutes by hand) after it is whipped for 20 minutes, the sugar is no longer grainy, just nice and smooth.  loved it! thanks.

This pie did not work for me. I followed the directions exactly with the addition of "Barb's" advice of whipping the egg whites and 1/4C sugar to stiff peaks and folding it in. I chose not to double the recipe and see how it did with the stiff whites/meringue. I beat it for 10 minutes and the sugar never dissolved, end product was lacking taste and very grainy. It's so rare that I throw a dessert out... but this one goes in the trash.

i used powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar to ensure a smooth and silky end product (sift it 2-3 times until very fine) and i used dark chocolate instead of the unsweetened kind (i decreased the amount of sugar as well). and yes, as many have noted, double the recipe for a 9" pie. this was completely delightful.

When I made this the first time it was grainy and lacked flavor which I sort of expected from reading the recipe. Also, the recipe did not make enough to spread in the pan. I tried the recipe over again tripling it this time. I used powdered sugar and added 3 tsp of instant coffee and 3 tsp of vanilla extract. Then it came out fantastic with a very light texture. I had to make too many alterations to give it a 5 star.

This was a very good recipe, rich and delicious..so chocolaty. Yes, you do have to make sure you beat the mixture well enough so that the sugar dissolves completely; that took a while. I've never had French Silk pie without whipped cream, not as an extra topping, but as part of the pie, so I covered the entire pie with it. I agree that it would look skimpy with the filling only; but I've NEVER seen French Silk pie served without whipped cream as a component. Everyone enjoyed it immensely.

I just made this for Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe except made it double to fill a 9" pie crust. I beat the eggs 5 minutes after adding each one but was disappointed in the texture. It was very grainy, like we were eating crunchy sugar. The pie looked great and the taste was good but couldn't get past the crunch.

great recipe. tastes just like chocolate ice cream, but in a pie! i made double the filling, as others raters suggested, which was a little much. 1 1/2 would have been good. i refrigerated overnight as others suggested.

Five stars for ease and taste! I've made this several times because, well, everyone loves chocolate and with so few ingredients it's so easy to make. Be sure to beat for the full time alloted, otherwise it will end up grainy. Thank you!

Great recipe, easy to follow and be sure to beat 5 minutes after each egg!
Also, note that it calls for an 8" pie crust.  I used a 9" (wasn't paying attention, apparently) and it seemed skimpy.

A little grainy but delicious none-the-less.  Great, quick, easy recipe for when i get a chocolate craving! also i substituted almond extract for some of the vanilla, either 1/2 tsp or 1 tsp, i can't remember.

great recipe for a stand mixer. I didn't actually make a pie, just poured into custard cups, for an ultra rich dessert. One question though, if you thoroughly cool the chocolate, wont it be hard again?

My pie was good but not perfect.  I was expecting a more fluffy pie but it turned out a little gooey and didn't set all the way.  The pie was very, very sweet.  I was worried about it being gritty but the sugar really smoothed out after the last egg was added with the last five minutes of beating.  I put the pie in the freezer and it is good frozen.

Made this for Mothers Day and it was a huge success. I added extra chocolate but it was sweetened so only used 1/4 cup of sugar with the butter. I beat the eggs for about 7 mins between each one. The pie was not gritty at all. Served with fresh raspberries and cream. Yum!

This is a great recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I used 3/4 cup butter instead of the 1/2 cup, and I used 3 eggs instead of 2, just to make it fluffier.  I also used a cup of melted chocoloate chips instead of the squares.  I am a chocoholic, and there is no such thing as "to sweet" when it comes to chocolate pie.  Very Tasty!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The pie turns out smooth and creamy.  Thank you to Ruth for putting in "beating 5 minutes after each addition", because other recipes don't put that in, and if it isn't beaten that long, it turns out grainy.

NO GRIT for me.  I love this recipe.  You will too if you like chocolate and sugar :).  I doubled the recipe and substituted cocoa and oil for the chocolate.  Mixed it all for about 15-20 minutes ( ~ 5 per egg added) and it was awesome.  I had no idea that French Silk was so easy to make.  Now I'm hooked.  It's a breeze with a KitchenAid.  Just be sure to scrape the bowl occasionally.

not bad.  To be honest I mistakenly put semi sweet chocolate in instead of unsweet, but I cut the sugar.  The texture was great but I did not think it was choclatey eanough. Next time I will add an ounce more chocolate and maybe add a ganache layer

Wonderful French Silk Pie!!  Turned out light and fluffy and was a hit at our dinner party.  Easy to make especially with a stand mixer.  Lower rating on "kid friendly" due to raw eggs in recipe.

I think it was because I used cheapo sugar, but this pie had a gritty feel to it, and I couldn't get passed that, and the fact that I was eating RAW eggs!  Ehhhh!  Hehe..  But I think I liked the taste pretty well.

I lost my copy of this and used another recipe.  It was very dissapointing compared
to this version.  This is the BEST French Silk recipe I have ever used.  I have
had problems with filling either not setting up, or setting up too hard, but
NEVER a problem with this version!!!  Thank you Ruth!

Delicious!  Made for Thanksgiving & everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe, as suggested by others, to fill the pie shell & topped with whipped cream/dark chocolate shavings.  This is my new favorite chocolate pie recipe.

It was super grainy and you tasted sugar more than you did chocolate. There were also a lot of raw eggs that did not feel good after eating it.

The pie tasted great but I should have read reviews before. There just wasn’t enough filling. Fine for when I make it for just us 2 but for 4-5 people NO. Double the ingredients and you will love it.

This pie is very disappointing - I am an award winning Food Blogger and have cooked since I was 12 or younger! The recipe did not work for several reasons. The worst of which the sugar was grainy! Even after completely chilling and completely meeting the eggs individually for 5 minutes. It was way dense and not a light and fluffy recipe. I will take the lady's advice to whip the egg whites and fold in but honestly, I will not attempt this again. I wish I had made my classic chocolate pudding recipe for Chocolate Cream Pie! Also, the All Recipes site is running me off because it constantly put me on an at&t add and cheesy advertising. I couldn't even upload and read through he recipe without at least 10 uploads. Sad. Couldn't eat it. :(

Doesn't  make enough to fill pie shell. Also instructions are not very detailed. Should eggs be room temp? Why doesn't  this firm up? Made this twice and poured  mix into pie shell. Used hand mixer 1st time and Kitchen aid mixer 2nd time and let it run 6 mins after each egg addition. Please any help appreciated. .

Outstanding.  I used an oreo cookie crust.  Followed another reviewers suggestion to separate eggs and whip up egg whites separately, then add them.  So rich and decadent, very creamy.
A smaller pie crust may be better but it's not necessary to fill a whole pie plate because it's so rich.

My son made this pie and declared it "amazing."  I thought it was delicious, but a tiny bit gritty from the sugar and VERY rich. We might try it again, folding in the whipped egg whites as another reviewer suggested.

This is my go to pie recipe. Made it many times. This past Thanksgiving, the kitchen was so warm that it turned liquid before I got all the eggs in. (Doubling the recipe) I thought it was ruined, but then remembered that it's mostly butter, it'd probably be ok if I stuck it in the fridge for a bit. Not only was it ok, it fluffed up so much that I probably didn't need to double it. I think this is why everyone is needing to double jt. It just gets too warm to fluff. Now, I mix in the eggs as usual, but then cool it back down for an hour before a final mix. Works perfectly.

I made this pie with crushed Social Tea cookies as a base.  It couldn't have been easier or more delicious.  I was able to throw it together for a last minute Valentine's Day dessert with things I had in my pantry.  A little time consuming (beating for 12+ minutes *phew*!) but well worth the effort!  I also made it in 3 mini springform pans and there was tons of filling.

I made this as specified with the only exceptions of beating each egg for 4-5 minutes rather than 2 minutes. I also put if in a pre-made graham cracker crust and topped it with fresh whipped cream. It was light and fluffy and delicious!

This was a great pie recipe and would of probably been even better if I didn't make an oopsie while making it.  I had to reheat everything over a double boiler since I didn't get all the chocolate mixed in thoroughly in the beginning.  Overall the flavor was great. but I do recommend more chocolate, double or triple the amount stated, or use an extra dark chocolate plus some cocoa powder, because it needed more of a chocolate flavor for us.  I did beat the whole 5 minutes after each egg, totaling 10 minutes, and it whipped up to volume nicely and filled the pie crust all the way to the top.  I loved the texture of the filling and it was a nice, silky, smooth texture..  Topped the pie off with whipped cream and chocolate curls and we had a great dessert.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was good but not great. Flavorful, but personally, I would rather have made it with dark chocolate for a richer flavor and would have added 1 oz more of chocolate and one more egg - the pie shell wasn't very full.

The consistency was terrible...the sugar was very grainy and I followed the recipe carefully and even set my timer so I beat the mixture long enough.  I used granulated sugar so maybe I should have used powdered.  Someone mentioned it would be better the next day...nope, still terrible so I threw the entire pie away.  What a disappointment especially since my homemade pie crust was amazing.

Perfect.  This pie was unbelievably good.  I followed the recipe exactly (although concerned that it wouldn't fill a whole pie) but it did and wow, flavor, texture, volume, was perfect.  I'm not sure why others had problems with this, whipping the eggs for 5 minutes each created a lovely voluminous pie.  Served with whipped cream topping. Will make this again and again now that I know it's so VERY EASY. Yum

Made this since I was a teen about 40 years ago.   I am now using grass fed butter to make it healthier and half the sugar  with the other half erythritol.   it measures exactly the same and is a healthy sugar substitute.    Try it!!!

This recipe seems easy enough but, must have been operator error. I read about the use of raw eggs and since I knew the grandkids would be eating it I tried meringue powder in its place. Epic fail. So then I tried it with the eggs. It was better however more like a thick pudding instead of light and airy. Not sure what I did wrong. Will have to continue to perfect this one! I still gave this a 4 star because the flavor was good.

I agree with others on doubling the filling. The difference in color is the amount of baking chocolate used, if you would like a darker color, add more baking chocolate. I bought chocolate curled shavings to top it off, and remember the whipped cream!

Just made this for the first time, and as other reviewers suggested, I doubled the recipe. I also made an 8" pie shell, and the filling amount was perfect! It stood about 2 inches high and made a nice presentation. Follow the directions exactly and you can't go wrong, this will not disappoint. Very rich and filling, you only need a small piece, but you won't be able to stop!

This turned out perfectly - rich, yet also light. Very delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. As some people point out, it's CRITICAL to whip everything enough to ensure that the filling is "big" enough for the crust. Whip the butter and sugar until it's as pale as possible. Whip each egg at least 5 minutes each. After I did all that I scraped the bowl with a spatula to make sure I got everything off the bottom of the bowl, then I whipped for about another minute. Once the pie was assembled I whipped a cup of cream and a couple tablespoons powdered sugar and put that on top with some grated chocolate. Wonderful.

For me, this perfectly filled my 9-in pie shell, but if I was making a bigger pie I might increase the recipe by 1/3 (add another 1/2 stick butter, 1/4 c + 2 tbs sugar, 1 oz chocolate, 1 egg) to make sure I had enough filling. 

One note: This pie sort of needs to stay in the fridge - it softens up very quickly at room temp. Probably not the best for a hot summer bbq!

I tripled the recipe and put it in 3 store bought chocolate cookie crusts.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and whipped the egg whites separately.  I also melted the butter and baking chocolate together in a glass bowl on low before mixing in the rest of the ingredients.  After chilling I topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  Delicious, rich, and super easy to make.

The flavor was good but it was very gritty.Also  even though I followed the advice of others and made a meringue with the egg whites there was not nearly enough filling.

This is a great recipe as long as you don't follow the directions. First of all, that thing about "thoroughly cooled" baker's chocolate? You'll wind up with a zillion lumps of undisolved chocolate if you do that. Keep it at least warm. After throwing out my first attempt, I opted for Hershey's unsweetened cocoa substitute. Second, and this is the biggest faux pas: DON'T toss the eggs in as instructed. Just put in the yokes and put the whites in a separate bowl with some of the sugar. Whip the whites and add the thoroughly blended rest of it TO the whites and blend. Finally, I substituted confectioner's sugar for the granulated for an even smoother texture. On-line conversion ran from 1 cup sugar to 1 1/3 to 1 3/4 cups powdered. I opted for 1 1/2 to make the math easier (3/4 recipe cups sugar =  1 1/8 cups powdered). I mixed the butter with 3/4 cups powdered and put 3/8 in with the egg whites. Top with whiped cream and viola! spectacular, creamy smooth French Silk Chocolate Pie.

I make this pie every year for Thanksgiving. The one thing I do different is  fold in a 12 container of Coolwhip to the chocolate before putting it into the pie pan. It taste incredible and fills the whole pie pan. 
Then I decorate it with the Coolwhip and chocolate curls.

I had to double the recipe to fill the pie shell. The color produced from the recipe was not dark, rich looking and high like the picture it was a light colored mocha. I would not make this again.

I read a lot of the reviews before I made this so I doubled all the ingredients except for the sugar which I kept to around 3/4c if I'm remembering it right, but that's because I don't have a very sweet tooth. I also used a chocolate cookie crust. The main thing I noticed was that after adding the first 2 eggs and beating for 5 mins, from there on in the extra eggs didn't really add much more volume, and it really wasn't very chocolatey to me even with 72% choc in it. I'm still giving it 4 stars because the texture is amazing, especially if you cut it and leave it to warm up a little before you eat it

AMAAAZING!! I followed the recipe exactly except I replaced the baker's chocolate w/the powder kind, using the directions on the can for the right substitute measurements (I think it's 3T powdered chocolate and 1T oil is equal to 1 oz. unsweetened baker's chocolate). Anyway---it's phenomenal. My husband isn't big on desserts and he loved it. He liked the slight "coffee flavor" as he called it but it's really just the bitterness of the chocolate.  So light and fluffy! So delicious and EASY EASY EASY! This is a go-to dessert for get togethers bc it has my 3 favorite qualities---fast, easy and a crowd pleaser!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Tastes almost like a Baker's Square pie!  So easy to make but you must take the time to mix the filling as directed or else you'll end up with a half-filled pie with no texture.

This was excellent!   I cheated and used a 'store bought' chocolate cookie crumb crust from the baking aisle and I used my ISI to whip up some cream - what a treat!  For so little effort.

Be VERY careful if you want to try almond extract. I read a review to try it and added a tiny bit. Three out of five people tried it for pi day didn't like it and thought it was too strong. Also use real vanilla if you can, it makes much of the flavor. Other than that, a fantastic pie! I beat it well for the full time and it was silky and fluffy. It filled a smallish homemade oreo crust well. topped with chocolate shavings, served with whipped cream on the side but I think it's great without. I also used 4 tbsp. dutch process cocoa powder like one reviewer said, mixed well and it turned out great (except for the fact that I spilled cocoa all over the table, chair and floor when trying to move my mixing to appease movie watchers nearby). Very tasty, will try again.

Good texture, but overly sweet.  I followed Barb's suggestion to add two egg whites whipped with 1/4 cup sugar to the original recipe.  The resulting pie had a lovely light texture (though my husband maintains that a real French silk pie should be denser), but it was too sweet, verging on cloying.  I served it with whipped cream in a chocolate crust made from crushed wafers.

I made the pie exactly as the recipe required for Valentine's Day. 
Unlike others, I had no issues with the filling. I had just enough for a nine inch crust. I held faithful to the beating time, and I think that's what gives the filling it's volume. I was scared I wouldn't have enough but I did. 
I made this with a chocolate crust, but it was waaaaay too sweet, so I will not be trying that again! But that's only my fault.
The taste of the actual pie filling was wonderful, HOWEVER, I had the pie in the fridge for twice the recommended time and it totally fell apart. Thank goodness it was just my immediate family and not my sweetheart or a larger group of people because I would have been devastated. 
I will make this again but not without letting it sit much longer, maybe even overnight, because it barely set beyond the top layer.

This was incredibly delicious!!! The first time I made this, I didn't have a pie pan or pre-made pie crust so I got creative and took 1 side of an oreo and put it in the bottom of a cupcake wrapper and then put the filling on top with cool whip over it and chocolate shredding over that. The 2nd time I bought oreo pie crusts and made 2 big ones! As long as you blend it for the full 5 minutes you will have plenty of filling especially if you plan on adding whipped topping! (I did, however, add 2 oz of extra melted chocolate because I like it rich!)

I have now made this about a dozen times. Everyone always loves it and constantly ask for more (and for me to make them their own to take home). For those that rate this below a 5, perhaps they either didn't follow instructions OR just don't really like French silk pie to begin with...

I have now also found that by crunching the oreos into bits and adding a bit of melted butter and baking it for a few minutes (and then cooling it before adding the pie mix) followed by adding whip cream and a few shards of Ghirardelli dark chocolate, it adds a scrumptious taste that will leave you craving more!

Super simple and delicious!  If you use a regular pie shell (not deep dish) and actually whip the mixture after each egg for 5 minutes it does make enough to make fill the shell.  I have a Kitcheaid stand mixer and switched from the paddle to the wisk when I added the eggs.  I added one egg, whipped for 5 minutes, added the second egg, whipped for 5 minutes, and it turned out fluffy and wonderful!

The pie was delicious! However, my filling came out very light  brown compare to the picture. Does anyone have a clue why? I used 4 ounces of chocolate since I double the recipe. Was that accurate or did I made a mistake there and that's the reason why?

The taste and consistency was just right, however, the sugar never dissolved completely so it was grainy. Also, it did not fill an 8" pre made oreo pie crust. I added a lot of whipped cream on top.

I made this pie for fathers day and it turned out really good. It is super simple to make and doesn't require a whole lot of ingredients. It might of only made about a little over an inch of filling for a 9 inch pie crushed, but after garnishing with cool whip and chocolate chips it looked completely fine.It tastes just like a french silk pie should and everyone who tried it said it was good and that they really like it.

It is indeed a delicious treat! As an earlier review noted, the eggs should be separated, the yolks beaten one at a time into the creamed butter/sugar mixture, and then the whites beaten with sugar and folded into the chocolate mixture.
I've made this using eggs pasteurized at home (warmed to room temperature, then held for 3 minutes in ample 145 degree water, then cooled) and it works well. The meringue may not have quite the volume as when made from raw egg white, but it's plenty light to make a delicious, ample filling for an 8-inch shell.

I almost only used 1 egg because it was already so light and fluffy.  It was ever so slightly grainy---I think if I had beat it a little longer before I added the eggs it would've been completely smooth.  I used regular sugar.  Flavor was delish.  Definitely beat 5 minutes after each egg.  Enjoy!!

This is tasty, but I feel guilty eating it!  First off, I doubled the filling or else it would have been puny.  Next time I'll cut the sugar to about 1 - 1.25 cups because it seems a bit sweet.  I also only used 3 squares chocolate when doubling.  You might even get by with less than that.  I think it would be way too rich with the original recipe.  With these modifications I think I can enjoy this fully, sacrifice little on taste and not feel guilty!

YUMMY YUMMY!  I was a lil worried about making this after reading some of the reviews saying there was not enough filling but decided to just try it and followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect....and actually I have a 10 inch pie pan and it was fine. I'm guessing some folks didn't whip the eggs in long enough because mine whipped up just fine in my kitchenaid stand mixer with the whip attachment. I let each egg whip the 5 full min each and had no issues. Also some folks thought it was gritty but I didn't have that issue either. DELISH!!!

I am not a novice baker/cook. I bake and cook everything in my home from scratch. I typically make a chocolate pudding-type pie and thought I would try something new. As-is, this recipe is mediocre at best. With the changes people have mentioned (whisk attachment, beat on high, double the filling), it is better, but mine is still a tad grainy from the sugar, and was no where near chocolatey enough, I added 2 TBS cocoa and wish I had added more. The main picture is especially deceptive, as the texture is no where near what is depicted. If you make the changes, you'll have a decent chocolate silk pie. As for me, I'm sticking with my dark chocolate pudding pie from now on.

Very good! You really have to beat it for the full 5 minutes after each egg or it is gritty and of weird texture, I like to double the recipe to make the pie fuller.

This was my first time making a chocolate pie of any kind.  I was worried because it came out soupy and not thick like the video shows.  So it was only one inch worth in a 6oz chocolate cookie crust. I served it with whipped cream and chocolate shavings and I must say it was delicious!  I would definitely make this again.  The chocolate cookie crust made it worth it. Very smooth and not grainy at all.

A tiny bit gritty.  I needed to mix longer I'm guessing.  Other than that, came out great!!  Nice and smooth and a wonderful present for a very good friend of mine who said his favorite was French Silk.  Will try again!!  Thanks for sharing!

This turned out great considering it was my first french silk pie. It was on the rich side and just a tad gritty from the sugar, but it didn't bother me. I followed the recipe exactly and found that the mixture filled the pie crust perfectly since we were topping it with whipped cream; however, if you are not planning on topping it with whipped cream you might increase the amount of the filling.

Followed the instructions to the letter including using an 8" pie pan and we had no problems.  Was just the right amount of filling and I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours and it set perfectly.  I slapped some whipped topping on before serving and everyone raved.  It only took us two days to finish the first one between two people and the next day my husband asked if I could make another!  He said it was his new favorite dessert.  Granny would be proud.

The recipe was VERY easy to follow. It provides just enough filling which is fine by me, but I found the dessert too sweet. I probably won't make it again. And yes, if you beat each egg for 5 minutes, the filing becomes fluffy like its supposed to.

Made this for my husbands birthday. I added a layer of peanut-butter beat with whipped cream and confectioner's sugar and topped it with more whipped cream. I could never get the white sugar in the chocolate portion of the pie to dissolve, but the flavor was nice. He loved it.

This recipe is GREAT.  You do NOT need to double it though.  That was my only mistake.  I had a 9" deep dish pie crust and figured I'd have to double it based on the reviews, and I ended up with twice as much filling as I needed.  As long as you blend the ingredients for the recommended amount of time (3-5 mins PER EGG) your filling will fill up your pie.
I had SO much fun licking the mixer whisks after I made this :-)

I have made this several times and it is a BIG hit; follow all the directions especially the time it takes to beat in each egg!  I always double the filling and have at times considered tripling it.  If you only made a single batch of filling you would have a mighty small pie.  I also top mine with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  It is beautiful and delicious.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit - everyone loved it.  It was a little thick after it set up, kind of like fudge.  So the next time right before I poured it into the pie crust, I folded in 1/4 container of coolwhip and that helped a ton.  My ultra picky husband even liked it!  Still plenty chocolatey and super yummy.  And the recipe doesn't need to be doubled with the cool whip.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Simply amazing! Velvety smooth, delightfully sinful taste and texture. Very easy to make. 

I used a 9" pie plate, doubled the recipe, it filled it  perfectly. I also used a chocolate cookie crumb crust.

The promise of one of these pies inspired my hubby to buy me a beautiful new Kitchenaid Mixer, how cool is THAT! He got his pie and I got the mixer that I've wanted for about 30 years! Thank you!

I didn't read the review until just now telling to whip the egg whites then fold the rest of the mixture into them... hmm.. will have to try that next time.

This was a good starter filling.  Very smooth and creamy.  Would have liked more chocolate taste so I would probably add another square or two of chocolate.  Perhaps bittersweet or semi so no more sugar is needed and it won't get bitter.

Tasted wonderful!  I think next time I would scale the recipe to 12 so it fills my 8" pie crust more.

I love using this recipe! I have used it a couple times and loved it. Instead of using real eggs, I used egg beaters so everybody can enjoy it.

Super easy and delicious.  I pasteurized my eggs before adding them.  Put them in a pot of water and bring the water to 140F.  Once it reaches that temp, keep them as close to 140 as possible-I had to remove the pot from the burner a few times.  Remove and use.  I ended up letting them cool a bit before using them, but I'm not sure if this is necessary or not.  I doubled the filling as well and ended up having way more than needed for my 9 inch crust.

You need to double the recipe: 1 cup sugar, 1 cup butter, 4 oz chocolate, 2 tsp vanilla and 4 eggs and this is PERFECT.  The texture and taste is perfect.

I took other reviewer's advise.  I  separated the eggs, and beet the whites to stiff peaks.  Meanwhile I mixed the rest of the ingredients for a loooong time (30-40 min)in order to dissolve all of the sugar I could.  I carefully folded in the whipped egg whites, filled the pie crust, covered the pie plate, and chilled it.  It came out GREAT!  One tip would be to take the pie out of the fridge a few minutes before serving.  Cold it is a bit dense, but close to room temp it gets silky smooth.

After making this recipe three times I have some things to say.  Just.....don't make it.  No matter what you do it will taste grainy, there is so much sugar that it is impossible to not taste the tiny grains, no matter how slow you add it or how long you whip it.  I'd make another type of pie.

This is really yummy! I made 2 8-inch pies, so I used 3 x the original recipe. I also used shortening with 1tsp of butter flavour instead of butter. I was expecting the pie to look as dark as in the photo, but mine was more the colour of chocolate milk. Definitely recommended!

MUST follow the recipe tips of whipping together butter and sugar and then each egg with mega whipping of 3-5 minutes... I also beat in only the egg yolks and had whipped to stiff peaks, the whites, then added those later.

The texture of this pie is fantastic, particularly with the extra beating time (required to fully incorporate the sugar and remove the grainy texture). I am giving this 4 stars because it is so sweet- too sweet. If I ever made it again, I would make it into small tarts because a piece of this pie is too rich and sweet to fully enjoy, for my taste.  It is, however, a very authentic French Silk Pie. Thanks!

I've made this countless times and everyone I've served has always loved it. The only imperfection in the recipe is that you absolutely must make at least a recipe and a half to fill a pie. 

My favorite variation is the addition of hazelnut extract but my husband prefers a generous garnish of peanut butter pie filling piped onto the top. Adding some grated dark chocolate to garnish the top tastes great and looks like it came from a high-end bakery. I generally make two at a time for family gatherings and everyone waits for it to arrive.

THis is the best chocolate dessert I have ever made - bar none. I made it this morning for fathers day as my husband loves chocolate pie. it was simple and came out perfectly. I made it exactly as written (used bakers sugar as it creams better than regular granulated), and used a premade 'oreo' crust. The amount it made might have been a little bit shy, but i wish i had a smaller crust - not more filling. next time I will use a small springform pan and make my own chocolate crust. I dont like chocloate pie myself, but I loved this pie. I cannot say enough about it...cut small slices though - it is super rich!!!!

This pie was sooo yummy and rich. I got a ton of raves about it. Even my husband loved it and he hardly ever eats pie. I did change the serving to 12 which gave me the perfect about of filling. I had no problem with the sugar not mixing like other people had mentioned. I put cool whip on top and stuck in the fridge until we were ready to eat it. Will definitely make this again.

This pie is wonderful!  I just made it for my nephew who was craving french silk pie.  I did as others did and started off with the paddle attachment to blend the 1st four ingredients, then switched to the whisk to add in the eggs.  I also changed the serving size to 12 since I had a 9 inch pie crust; it made the perfect amount of filling.  I topped it with cool whip and some shaved chocolate, it tastes just like Baker's Square pie.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a friend's birthday and got rave reviews. Very, very easy. I read the other reviews and made sure to beat for 5 minutes after the addition of each egg - the amount of filling was perfect. The texture was light but it was very rich. I'm already planning to make another!

Great recipe, but not enough for a standard 9-inch crust. I double it, then top it with 2 1/2 cups of whipped cream, and that makes an attractive pie. As previously stated, beating the filling is crucial. If done correctly, this makes a great filling.

This was great. I have had chocolate pie before but never French silk...it was so nice I did double the recipe except the sugar I only used 1 cup I also used a 9 inch crust, my husband near ate the whole thing himself, we will certainly try this again. I left off the whipped cream as it is high enough in calories but may try it next time around as wanted to taste the pie without any other additions.  It was not gritty, but I used my food processor to beat each egg for 5 mins. For those having a problem with grittiness just keep beating the mixture it will sort itself out.

This definitely doesn't fill up a whole pie crust so double the recipe. It's also super sweet, somewhat sickly sweet, so make sure to serve in very small slices.

This was my first attempt at french silk pie and it turned out well!  I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the filling, which worked out well.  I also added freshly whipped cream on top.  This was pretty easy to make.  I was happy to have my kitchenaid stand mixer instead of having to use a hand mixer for 20 minutes to beat in 4 eggs!

tried this once with Splenda, and it came out tasting salty, which was odd... figured out it was the coco and the splenda not working out right together.  made it a second time with real sugar and it was spectacular!!  I definitely recommend making it with real sugar, it's well worth the calories.

This pie was WONDERFUL!! I did double the ingredients because that was suggested so often.  Also, I used my 20 year old hand held mixer and beat the mixture for 6 minutes after adding each egg, just to satisfy myself that I follwed the directions exactly.  I covered w/ saran wrap and refrigerated it for about 16 hours, because that's when i was ready to serve it.  It was NOT gritty at all but in fact, super yummy-smooth!  One review said it did not make 8 servings, I disagree...this is the richest chocolate pie I've ever had and a little goes a LONG way!  Perfect for anyone who is an insane chocho-holic!!  My dad LOVED it and he's as picky as they come.  I will definately use this for ALL my special occassions.  Thanks, Ruth!  I just gotta go out and get an automatic mixer now cuz my mixin' arm is killin' me :)

I was worried about this being gritty, but if you keep mixing, after the eggs are added, it's smooth. Easy to make too!

This is my 2nd time making this. First time I had a bit of trouble, but this time it was as simple as any recipe can be.
First time I used cocoa powder. This time I actually used the baking chocolate.
This recipe could not be any easier.
It should be made clearer to WHIP the mixture. This will definitely help with the texture and adding in enough air to fill an 8 inch pie.
I added one extra tsp of vanilla, and used a chocolate cookie pie crust.
Whipped up everything for longer and kept tasting until there was no grittiness. Took about 20mins with a handheld electric mixer  to get to that silky smooth texture.
Super yummy!

This is a really delicious pie, that got a seal of approval from my husband with a fairly discerning palate.   I doubled the recipe as some reviewers suggested, and used two bars of Ghirardelli 60% dark chocolate. This gave me a delicious, very rich and velvety result, but not "heavy."   I think when I revisit this recipe, I will try to do what Barb said in her review, and beat the egg whites with sugar to a meringue before adding, to get a "fluffier" result. The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because the instructions are a little unclear on this matter. It's really delicious, though, especially with a chocolate cookie crust and home-made whipped cream!

Like, wowwwwwwwwwwwww. So good and so simple, I made it in less than 15 minutes since I popped it into the freezer.   I followed what someone else said and whipped the egg whites into meringue before folding it in, made sense to me. I used cocoa powder since the choc. chips I had on hand just wouldn't melt for some reason...  Had to add 2 tbsp hot water to smooth the end out since the cocoa powder made it a paste but afterwards, everything went smooth and ended up being super awesome. Will use lesser butter/sugar/cocoa powder the next time though  P.S: Didn't use a pie crust since I was too lazy to make one, didn't need one anyways since you can just scoop this into a bowl and make it like a fancy pudding

I was excited to try this recipe and sorely disappointed. I did my best to follow the recipe to the letter. It tasted ok but the texture was really gritty from the sugar. Also, my husband refused to eat it with the raw egg in it.

This turned out really great. I did double the recipe and made a the healthier graham cracker crust from this site. I also used light butter and beat for 5 minutes in my stand mixer after adding each egg. Very Very rich but so Good!

Mmmm... delicious for this chocoholic like me. I followed the recipe except for the chocolate, I just melted some chocolate chips. Also before I put it in the crust I added some cool whip to the mixture to make the pie fuller. Was delicious and will definately be a regular!!

Not enough filling to fill up pie so I doubled but then when it did not really set up too well but remained mostly chocolate soup. It could have been me but I probably wouldn't try again.

YUMMY!  This was easy and a hit with the kids.  I used a graham cracker crust instead of the pastry crust.  I use fresh eggs from my chickens and I always think that makes a difference from processed store-bought eggs.  They whip up better and make a much more fluffy consistency.  I will make this again!

Well, I am only giving it 3 stars because of the adjustments that have to be made to make it good. You absolutely have to use powdered sugar or fine baker's sugar to avoid the graininess. It is extremely grainy made as the recipe suggests--extremely. I did follow other raters suggestion to beat the mixture for about 20 minutes--the consistency ended up being fine. I think this recipe--as written--is over-rated. Definitely read the suggestions for changing it before proceeding.

This is my husband's favorite. We make it for his Birthday and Thanksgiving every year now. I usually make a whipped topping for the top using heavy cream and sugar, beating it until peaks form.

This turned out amazing and certainly didn't last long once I served it to my friends.  I don't have an electric mixer so it was all done by hand.  The butter and sugar was a bit hard to mix so I melted the butter, added the sugar and cooled the mix.  Once it had solidified I took a wooden spoon to it.  It came out like the recipe needed it to be.  The pie was smooth and had a very rich chocolate taste that was also sweet.  I topped it with toffee bits.

absolutely AMAZING !!! I followed the advise & made just a few changes: 1) I did not have fine sugar-I just put it my Cuisinart and did the trick. 2) Double the recipe 3)Using my Kitchen Aid, used the paddle for the butter, chocolate & vanilla. Then CHANGED to the whipping one, for the eggs Topped with whip cream

This pie was amazing. I was unsure at the beginning because it looked so grainy, however, the longer it beat, the smoother it became. I topped it off with homemade whipped cream and it was simply to die for. There were no left overs...and only three diners!

I loved this pie!! I did double the chocolate and eyed the sugar so I am not sure how much sugar I put in, but it turned into a wonderful dark chocolate pie which I put in a graham cracker crust and top it with cool whip and sprinkled some cocoa on top. My family just loved it. They ate the whole pie in one sitting!

My 4 stars is only because I did not have enough filling for a 9 inch pie. However, I did notice the recipe does say for an 8 inch pie. The texture and taste is to die for. It taste just like my favorite french silk pie from a pie pantry that went out of business in my town. But now I can make my own, and I never knew it could be so easy. You definitely have to beat each egg for 5 minutes or it will be gritty. Next time I will double the recipe. Excellent!!

I have been looking for a French Silk pie recipe for a long time and have been pretty consistently disappointed - but not with this one!  I did double all of the ingredients (except the sugar, I only used 1 cup) and it turned out perfectly.  Not grainy, not soupy - just perfect and it was a hit (FINALLY!!) at Thanksgiving.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is awesome!  I was a little overwhelmed at first with the thought of making this but it turned out to be pretty easy.  Since I had purchased 2 pie crusts I ended up making 2 back to back.  I took one to work and kept the other at home.  Everyone loved it.  You definitely need to mix each egg for the full 5 minutes to get the right consistency.  I will be making this again.

So good! Wow! So rich and smooth. My did not turn out grainy at all, it was perfect texture. I just beat each addition of egg for literally five min on med speed, and it turned out wonderful! I dont know if I would want more filling like others suggested, it is sooooo rich but so good. I just layered it with a nice thick layer of coolwhip and each slice tastes better and better. I followed the recipe exactly and i plan on doing that next time as well.

This pie was delicious.  The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars from me is because of the richness.  We could barely finish our slices.

This is extremely rich.  I served this at a family event and nobody finished their piece as they considered it to rich.  I tired it and it was very rich so I only hate half myself.  I love rich stuff but this was too much.

This was fantastic!  so smooth and creamy.  Dont give up on it, it will become smooth and not gritty if you follow a past review that said to beat at really high speed for quite a while. I will be making this time and time again.

While this pie was both tasty and smooth, it is very, very heavy. My friends and I could barely each finish one slice. It would be better if it was lighter and fluffier, instead of heavy-as-cheesecake.

It was really good, but i'm afraid if i use a 9inch pan the filling would be rather inadiquate...also i think if you whip in some whipped cream, it would improve the texture to a smoother wonderfullness. In all I think i'll keep this one forever and for always...

This is an excellent recipe!!!! But you do have to make a double batch, one batch is just not enough for a good pie like this. I made it for my neighbor's family and they LOVED it.

Great Base recipe! Just added an additional 1 t of Almond extract and an additional 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to go along with the 3/4 cup of plain sugar. Also tossed in 3 t of instant Folgers Roasted coffee and there you have it! a perfect French (Mocha) Silk Chocolate Pie! The flavor is outrageous! I like to decorate it with whipped topping around the edges and a sprig of something green in the middle. Looks just as good as it tastes!

This was DELISH!!! Everyone in the family wanted a slice so I had to cut it into 16th's. It just wasn't enough. They all devoured this in no time. I'm making two for the next get together.

After finding out my husband's family were big fans of French Silk Pie, I decided to put aside my fears and give it a try.  I doubled the recipe and used a 9in pie crust, other then followed the directions, it turned out smooth and perfect.  You need to follow the directions when it comes to how long to use electric mixer.

I made this pie for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner...it was such a big hit! Everyone went back for seconds! I didn't have an electric mixer so mixed everything by hand. The texture was probably not as smooth as it should have been, but it was close enough where no one even noticed. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the ingredients for 1 pie which was the perfect amount to fill a premade pie crust. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! Sweet and rich with a mousse like texture. I made this for Thanksgiving and doubled the recipe.  I used an Oreo pie crust and topped it with chocolate shavings and whipped cream.  For the 1st time in thirty years my mom went without eating pumpkin pie!

This recipe is exceptionally good.  I used a "ready" crust and baked it accordingly before adding the filling.  It was the perfect amount of filling for this type of crust.  To ensure proper fluffiness of the filling, make sure the butter is creamed and the chocolate is approx room temp before adding it to the mixture.  Also, although a total of 10 minute mixing time seems like a lot, you achieve the best results if you tough it through and follow the mixing directions exactly.  I added whipped cream and chocolate chips after the pie cooled in the fridge for two hours.

This is a very easy recipe.  I did have a little problem using raw eggs but got over it when I tasted it.  You truly have to do the extra mixing or it will be grainy.  For a deep dish pie crust double the recipe.  It looks very impressive.

As the reviewer below me correctly states, this is not enough filling.  However, doubling the recipe is too much filling (N.B. the recipe for "french silk chocolate pie II" is a doubled version of this recipe).  When I make it I increase the ingredients by 50% except for the chocolate, which I double.  I prefer the more intense flavor this gives.  Use high-quality baking chocolate for this pie, as well as unsalted butter.

I made this pie today.  The texture was good, but it was way too sweet.  I doubled the recipe and maybe I added too much sugar.  It may not be the recipes fault, but I will be looking for another recipe.

Simply amazing! I always loved French silk pie but had no idea how to make it. I've paid $5 a slice at a local restaurant for many years. I made a whole pie for a little under $10 and it tastes even better! This is a excellent recipe except I took others advice and doubled the ingredients. It was perfect and just enough (I agree that the pie would've only filled half of the crust if you follow the recipe). Also, I don't have a electric mixer so I mixed everything with a spoon by hand. Again, it turned out perfect and extremely smooth. Kudos to whoever shared the recipe.

I have been making this exact recipe for years except my recipe calls for a little more of each ingredient:  I use a 9" crust, 3/4 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, 3 squares unsweetened chocolate melted and cooled, 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla, and 3 eggs, beaten at med. speed for 5 mins. after each addition.  Sometimes I double the filling and use a deep dish crust.  There is usually extra filling left over so I buy mini graham cracker shells and fill those.  Be sure the pie chills for at least 2 hrs. before serving.  Top with defrosted whipped topping and chocolate shavings.  My husband prefers this for his birthday instead of a cake!  Enjoy!!

This recipe was such a hit! Nobody could believe that I made this pie all by myself. My husband who is very picky and said he didn't even want to try the pie, loved it and said I hit a new level in my cooking. Thanks so much for this recipe I will be making this all the time.

This pie turned out well, I followed the recipe exactly.  It looked very nice and tasted delicious, but it was very difficult to slice.  I tried everything even dipping the knife in warm water but it still turned out a little messy.

It's sooo good...but really rich.  I guess I'm going to try and find a lighter recipe if that's possible!

I made this pie for Christmas, and it turned out perfect.  The entire pie was eaten that day (and I don't have a big family!) I thought it was very easy.  I've emailed it to several of my friends.

I did not care for this recipe. I creamed the ingredients for a long time and it still came out tasting gritty. It tasted better with whipped topping but still not that great.

I had trouble creaming the amount of sugar into the amount of butter, so I ended up adding more butter and then more chocolate than the original recipe.  My sibling raved over the pie and gobbled it up, even those who do not like buttery things found this pie delicious.

I served this pie at a barbecue.  It was very simple to make and everyone really loved it.
