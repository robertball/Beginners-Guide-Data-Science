This recipe has been waiting for a picture since 2004 and only had one review.  These were pretty darned good. A problem with the recipe though is that is calls for the potato patties to be coated in bread crumbs but the recipe does not call for bread crumbs.  I used panko crumbs and it gave them a nice crispy exterior.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

These are delicious! I was looking for something to make that used few potatoes (because that’s all I had left). I had all the rest of the ingredients. This recipe is carb-heavy. My family loved it. Even with the jalepenos and cayenne pepper in it, it wasn’t overly spicy. I would definitely make this again!
