This was the best chocolate pie I've ever had!  My whole family loved it.  The only thing I did differently is use a double boiler to melt the marshmallows, chocolate, and cream.  I had to let the mixture cool a little before adding it to the whipped cream.  I will definitely make this again!

The easiest pie I've ever made. I added two things to this recipe, 1/2 t. vanilla to the filling- then topped with whipped cream. It was a hit with people whom don't normally eat chocolate pie! Very light but delicious, great to have for a quick guest dessert.

This pie was fantastic. I use all recipes a lot and let me tell you this pie was a hit. It was really rich though. Too rich for my taste so then I made it again and only used 4 hersheys chocolate bar and 7 to 8 marshmellows. I did not have any carmal bars so I just used chocolate bars. If really rich flavors is something that is too much for you then the recipes changes I made are perfect for you. Overall, I love this pie.

This was delicious.  I used regular hershey bars and caramello bars.  I also made extra whipped cream for the top which was also yummy.  I found this tasted much better the next day so i would definately make it the day before I needed it.

Nice and easy.  I think I'd use more marshmallows next time to keep it a bit lighter.  I didn't have any candy bars on hand, so used chocolate chips--bittersweet and semi-sweet.

OMGosh!  I Searched AllRecipes for the "Best Rated Pie" and this is what I found..  Super Seriously ..  Look NO Further for the simplest most amazing "CHOCOLATE"  pie ever !!!  It took me a little longer than 15 minutes to make it ..  but that's ok!  Get creative with the crust by blending any bag of your favorite cookies and mix with melted butter until the perfect consistancy for pressing into a pie dish..  bake for 8 minutes give or take.  I used Rolos and Hershey Bars along with the other ingrediants for the filling..  It's the Best Chocolate Mousse with out any of the trouble!

Wonderful pie - hubby who is not much of a sweets eater loves this pie and requests it often - I did put the new coolwhip icing on top - chocolate is wonderful and the cream cheese takes it over the top.  Also just use the chocolate bars since carmel is not a favorte in our house - can't go wrong with this pie.

Delicious and easy to make. I only had mini marshmallows, so I used 5 handfuls of them. We don't have Aero bars here, so I used Hershey's bars and Godiva chocolate caramel bars. So good!
