Holy BLC! Or should I say BTC? Whatever the case these are really good! But then again just about anything with bacon is bound to be delicious! My husband thinks bacon should be a food group so when I saw this recipe I had to try it. I lightly toasted the bread first so it would be nice an crispy then layered everything and put it back into the broiler. I sliced the onion very, very thin. Next time, I would leave it off altogether. I made some with swiss cheese and some with cheddar - man were these tasty! Try adding a little bleu cheese for a nice twist. Watch these carefully in the broiler you definitely don't want to burn these....

Surely these are BTCs, not BLCs? Anyway, I simply microwaved the bacon for a couple of mins, assembled the sandwich with as much bacon/tomato/onion and cheese as we wanted, then broiled til the bacon was crispy. Husband said he'd prefer it without onion. Thanks!

I had some leftover cooked bacon in the fridge and immediately thought of a BLT for lunch today. After realizing that I had no lettuce (typical), lol, I stumbled upon this recipe and thought I'd give it a go (I have to admit, the name did throw me off for a minute, until I realized it must be a mistake, lol). I used italian sliced bread (all I had) that I lightly toasted. Also, before assembling the sandwich, I spread a light layer of mayo, just because I like it and was in the mood for it. I eyeballed everything to my liking, as well. This was such a nice surprise of a sandwich! I really enjoyed all of the flavors together (I used sweet onion). This really hit the spot and made me glad that I didn't have any lettuce today...This really did make a wonderful lunch and I will surely be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yes I overdid my bacon so really be sure you only cook it until soft.  Still a great little sandwich though!  Thanks!
