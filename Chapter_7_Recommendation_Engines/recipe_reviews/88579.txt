A great dish, I know from past experience that this is always best baked in a metal dish than in ceramic.

THIS WAS SO SIMPLE AND DELICIOUS!  I made my version of the recipe due to what was on hand.  So I'm not sure it was quite authentic, but still yummy nonetheless.  Anyway, I used Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage(cut into slices). I also added some cooked onion to the sausage and oil.  To the pudding mixture I added some garlic powder along with the salt/pepper. Was crusty and delicious when done ~ I served this with a simple mustard(my family not keen on the onion gravy).  Was very simple and a casual meal keeper.  Thanks so much!!!!

Its pretty good, but it awesome if you add a bit of mustard power and Worcestershire sauce to the mix (Mum's secret ingredients). It just gives it that extra bit of flavour to the batter.

What a blast from the past. My mom used to always make this dish when I was a kid. I used this version and added a dry premix of lemon dill to add an amazing tangy flavour.

Very good very easy recipe, when scaling to 6 servings, add a bit of extra milk, perhaps 1/2 cup at the most.

Very yummy!  I added garlic powder to the batter and some chopped onion to the sausage.  We used Jimmy Dean breakfast links.  My kids loved it and all had seconds.I made it with the onion gravy and served it with a fresh fruit salad.

My husband and I both thought this was delicious. I used 4 big pieces of sweet Italian sausage instead of sausage links. I added creole seasoning (because I love it on everything), garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper to the batter, and it gave it a very nice flavor. I did have to bake it longer too. Instead of the 35 minutes I cooked it 50. I will definitely be making this again.

I'm guessing that I went wrong somewhere along the way, because this turned out very bland and dry for me. I don't know what I did wrong, but perhaps I will try again one day.

I'm from the US and have never had toad in the hole before. Perhaps I just don't have the taste buds for this, but thought the Yorkshire pudding was bitter and that the dish turned out greasy.

Tried this recipe this past weekend, and loved it. I really enjoy pub food but it's kind of hard to get where I live. My boyfriend and I gabbled it up very quickly. Will make again. Might not be a staple in our diets (due to the fat content) but will make again!!

I was disappointed by how heavy the "breading" came out.  I'm used to that part being a lot lighter/ fluffier.

Not really my kind of breakfast food.  It was ok.  I added about 1tsp of allspice and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Some other I see added onion and galic powder, but that just wasn't tempting my tastebuds.  The extra spices helped, but it was still kinda bland.  Also it would have been nice knowing what kind of pan to use.  Is the batter supposed to climb way up the sides?  My husband gave me a funny look when I set the dish on the table.  We both agreed it was ok, but the hubby said he would rather have my homemade waffles instead.  :)  I just don't think I'm a toad in the hole kinda girl!  Sorry!

Tasted better than the name suggests. 2 things - I used 10 breakfast sausages - might suggest that you use as many as necessary to cover the bottom of the pan. I left the dish to cook for 35 min without checking - a mistake as they were probably in 5 min longer than they should have been, (kind of hard). Next time I'll check at the 25-30 min mark. Just used a canned hamburger steak sauce with a whole mess of sauteed onions thrown in - Loved it!

We tried this last evening, and the pudding was really good.  However, I think it would have benefitted from larger sausages or from patties as opposed to the breakfast links available to us.  The gravy is necessary and not just an option, as the dish is somewhat dry.

My kids asked me to make just the Yorkshire pudding part and serve the sausages separately.  This is way easier than making popovers so I will definately repeat it-- at least the Yorkshire pudding part.

It was really easy and my family and friends enjoyed it. A friend liked it so much he had me make it for our celebration Sunday at church. We do it the last Sunday of the month and I didn't have much to bring back home.

This was a total waste of 4 eggs!  8 sausages surrounded by a dry breadlike substance.  I don't get what's supposed to be so good about this recipe.  It was not the least bit flavorful and, who needs that much breading around sausages?  Are you sure an ingredient wasn't left out? I know I won't be making it again.

I've been making this recipe fr years and everyone always loves it. I make it for a Christmas Day brunch and my family and guests wipe it out! 
Through the years I've amped it up with different things but the basic recipe is always the same. I've wrapped the bangers in bacon or added different spices to the batter. Different gravies too.
I don't know why anyone would say it's oily unless they are using very greasy sausage and more oil than necessary.

I used a beef hotlink in place of the pork sausages, more meat, less fat and sodium.

This was not bad but my mother always added crispy bacon. It's a great starter recipe.

I am not sure what I did wrong but I would guess that it may be the pan I used. It didn't specify what size pan so I used an 8X8.  I will try this again as I feel that the error was all mine. I will either half the recipe and use the same pan or use a 9X13 next time.

Hey a good advice for this recipe is to add some baking powder to the mixture so you can make a panchito's cake !!!!

Tried this tonight, too much flour too much like a cake.  Maybe less flour, I remember mom yorkshire fluffy not like a cake.  Will try again with half the flour
