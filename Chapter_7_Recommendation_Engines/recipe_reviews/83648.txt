Great recipe!  Loved the flavor of the middle eastern spices.  I didn't have pistachios or apricots so left them out.  Used no sugar added peaches, so I added a touch of brown sugar and some cinnamon.  It was wonderful.  I did think an hour was a little long for the chicken, usually 30 min is enough for chicken at 375.

Really good and really easy!!  I didn't use the curry powder (my choice, simply don't like it...I know, my loss!) Can't wait to make again!

I loved the pistachios with the indian spices but the sauce did not thicken! If you want plain chicken with baked fruit and some syrupy fruit juice than you'll love this recipe. The flavors were there but it definitely needs some works!

Tender chicken and lovely baked fruit, but I agree with other reviewers that the sauce needs work.  I thickened it with cornstarch, and it needs a bit of salt.  I liked it, and the family did, too.  Thanks for the recipe.
