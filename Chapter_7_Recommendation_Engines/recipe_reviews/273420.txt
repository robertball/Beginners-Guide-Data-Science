I hope I never find myself in a situation where I am needing to cook for 50 people. With that  being said, I scaled this recipe down to 20 servings. I am not familiar with brown onions and used a yellow onion instead and I used the dried cilantro instead of the epazote as the recipe submitter suggested. I wasn't thrilled about adding the cinnamon but it was actually the cardamon that overpowered the dish. I recommend scaling that way back. These were okay but not something I would make again...sorry.
