This chowder is really really good!  It's the closest thing to Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco that I've found.  You don't need to change anything in the recipes at all.

I don't like potatoes in soups/chowders, so I sub'd in rice.  I don't like celery, so I sub'd in carrots.  Not  a clam fan, so I sub'd in beef.  Thought it might be too thick, so I used a beef broth.

You know what? I think I just made beef stew.

Seriously, I did sub the rice.  It was good.Don't put too much Thyme though.

This was good! I did reduce the butter and cornstarch by 1/2, as it seemed a bit too much for me, and that worked fine. It was the perfect thickness for us. This had a subtle, but nice flavor. This is not gonna replace our favorite clam chowder, but we all enjoyed it, and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was delicious! I made it for the second week in a row, this time cutting up the bacon, not removing it to put on top, so delish! Didn't put the red wine vinegar on top either time, it seemed strange and we loved it anyway! Thanks for the recipe, I like the method of saut√©ing the veggies!

Absolutely delicious! I did a few less clams and a few more veggies by mistake... But it still worked. I also probably could have stood to do just a smidge less of corn starch.
