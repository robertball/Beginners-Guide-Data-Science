I believe this recipe is inaccurate. I've never made this type of pie, so I followed the recipe exactly. First the ingredients call for 9" crust, but directions say 8" - I used 8". The recipe states 1/2 cup butter - this turned out to be too much! You use just as much butter as strawberries. Needless to say, it did not turn out right. It cooked fine, looked beautiful on the outside, but very little taste on the inside. I also used fresh rhubarb, cut up, and 10 minutes was too long to cook it for.

Easy recipe.  Just watch your cook time - more ripe equals less stove cook time for your Rhubarb.  Flavor was great.

This was just like  grandma used to make.  Now living in Kentucky, I can't grow rhubarb- too warm- have to wait if it comes into the stores.  I like to substitute 1/2 of white sugar with Splenda, so I added 1 t flour to the cooking mixture.  Everything else the same except I used homemade crust.  Smelled Good, crunch crust, smooth taste and nice mix sweet/sour.  When other recipes complained of too much filling, could have been 3 eggs instead of 2 and too much sugar like 1 1/2 cups.  This was well balanced even for my change of less sugar.

This recipe is far too sweet.  I had to add the juice of a full lemon, lemon rind, and an extra cup of rhubarb to temper the sugar.  I also used frozen rhubarb and it only took about 2 minutes to get soft.  I appreciate the basic ingredients list (I made my own pie crust though), but there's a lot of tweaks necessary.

The pie can sometimes be messy, but is still good! Also, it is better to add a little more strawberries and rhubarb.
