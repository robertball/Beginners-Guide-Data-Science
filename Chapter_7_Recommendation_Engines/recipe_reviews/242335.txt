I had a hard time getting the dough to stick together.  It seemed rather dry and crumbly, and I had to press it together to get the dough to stick to itself.  I couldn't roll it out, or roll it into balls, so I shaped small walnut-sized balls as best I could, rolled in sugar, then flattened on the baking sheet.  Other than that, tastes like I expected it would: buttery with the flavor of green tea.

This is so good. I will surely make it again. I have added my leftover white chocolate chips and slivered almonds coz we love nuts and the kids love chocolate however I reduced the sugar since the chocolate is sweet enough. The kids loved it. So simple to make for a novice baker like me. Thanks for sharing this recipes.

These were much tastier than I expected and very easy to make. I was surprised how soft the dough ended up being. It had the same consistency of kinetic sand. That made rolling it a small challenge, but not impossible. The first tray I made, I forgot to add the sprinkle of sugar on top, but now having tasted it both with and without the extra sugar, it isn’t much different. I’m glad I found this recipe. It’s a perfect treat for Spring with its bright green color and light refreshing taste.

Was very easy to make. Buttery and not overwhelmingly sweet. I had to add /14 teaspoon of green tea. I used high grade culinary matcha green tea. The color and the taste was perfect.
