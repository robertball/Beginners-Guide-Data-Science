This is one of my favorites dips! and it can be made in the crockpot too. Just layer the ingredients (cream cheese, then chili, then cheddar) turn on low and heat for 1 -3 hours depending on how cold your cream cheese is. Stir and serve. I usually use 3 cans of chili. Anyone who normally is turned off by using 
canned chili shouldn't be. It's excellant with tortilla chips! This is the same recipe as "Chili Cheese Dip V" on this site.

One of my kids all time favorite dips! I like to flavor my cream cheese by mixing in garlic and onion powders, chili powder, a bit of cumin and a couple of cans of green chili's. A combination of cheddar and pepper jack gives it a nice little kick. Thanks so much!

I've been making this for my friends for a long time, but "college-style" Cut the ingredients in half (everybody seems to prefer Hormel "no bean" chili), prepare it the same way in a microwave-safe dish, and put it in the microwave for two minutes instead of the oven. It turns out the exact same and it's a quick and easy dip to make during a commercial break

Huge hit. HUGE. I cut this in half and used my own homemade chili, fat free cream cheese and 2% shredded sharp cheddar. Half of this was perfect in an 8x8 baking pan. And you know, half an hour with my boys and it was gone, baby, gone. Great for a weekend "boy" day.

Made with dairy-free cream cheese, chili, a little leftover taco meat, and 4oz green chilies over the chili. Served @ hubster's poker game and everyone loved it!  Will def. make again since it was so easy! Thanks, GLHood!

We love this dip!!!  I've been making it for a long time.  I love how easy it is.  If we have unexpected guests over I usually whip this out for them to munch on.  A few times I've been out of cheddar cheese and even without it the dip is great!  :)

Super easy.  I found this rather bland though even with the spicy canned chili.  Will spice it up next time I make it.

Quick, easy and delicious!  Made exactly as written except made only one-half recipe; it fit nicely in a 9" pie plate.

Hubby said this was totally a man dip, he went to town on a huge huge bowl and filled his belly to the brim. The ease of this recipe was very nice. And totally should have made half the recipe because it really made alot. The steps however, can be easily altered to just mix all three ingredients together and microwave it until cheese is melted and heated all the way through thoroughly. But all in all it was a simple delish of a dish. Thanks

This dip isn't bad, and it's a good idea, I just cant get passed the flavor of canned chili. I think it would be really good if it was made with homemade chili rather than canned. I think I will try that next time.

I just make 1/2 of this recipe (of course depends on how many you are serving)...1 package of cream cheese and 1 can of chili - with or without beans (I like Armour brand). I add a can of diced chili's too and sprinkle across the chili and then add Mexcian cheese. Yep heavy appetizer and men love it!

Edited: I originally gave this two stars because it did not look attractive and didn't taste as good as I hoped although the males in the house DID like it. I felt bad leaving a low review and the men wanted me to make it again. This time I used full-fat cream cheese (I used fat-free before). Don't use the fat-free for this one. Fat-free is flavor-free IMO. I used the Hormel chili WITH beans this time and a better quality shredded cheese on top. I think the cheaper cheese I used the first time left a "greasy look" on top. This was definately better the second time around. Yes, I will be making this again. Thanks!

I've made this for years but w/o the grated cheese on top and I always microwaved it.  It was good this way with the cheese addition and baking it in the oven...definitely hard to stop eating!  I would say that, if you're going to use canned chili, splurge on one of the more expensive brands.  But it's at its best with leftover homemade chili on top:)

This is my husband's favorite!  I make my own chili (simple turkey chili from this site- with some veggies added in an attempt at healthiness). Thanks for the recipe :)

So simple to make and oh so yummy! I cut the recipe in 1/2 but ended up still using 2 packages of cream cheese because 1 package wasn't spreading over the bottom of the dish very well. I added garlic salt and paprika to the cream cheese. I used 1 can of no bean 15oz chili and add 1 bunch of green onions. I also used half Mexican blend cheese and sharp cheddar because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make again!

This was OK - not bad, just not great. It was kind of bland.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, Hormel chili w/no beans (one spicy and one mild) and sharp cheddar.  Took it to a large gathering (with plenty of men present), served with Fritos corn chips, and hardly anyone ate it.  If I do decide to make this again for some reason, I will definitely add taco seasoning and jalapenos or something to give it some flavor.

I made four pans of this dip for two different get-togethers over the holiday season and everybody loved it. Needless to say, there were no leftovers! The only thing I did differently was to add a layer of salsa over the chilli layer. I will make this again for sure!

I wasn't very impressed with this dip. My biggest complaint...WAY too mch cheese! It would have been fine with half as much. Also, the chili I chose didn't taste all that great so buy a brand you know is good when making this. Will try this again in the future with a few changes.

Delicious!  My husband had to run to the grocery store for more chips and plans on making a second run for more Man dip ingredients later this week.  I think this is a new staple in our house.

Made this with homemade taco chili (from this site).  It was good, but I think it needed to have time for the flavors to blend because it didn't have a lot of flavor even though I added additional taco powder, garlic powder and chopped onion.  Tomorrow I'm sure it will be better.

I have never used canned chili in my life so I was leary....but to my surprise....delicious! Used low fat cream cheese, a can of Hormel chili w/o beans and the shredded cheddar. I also halved the recipe and this fit nicely in a small metal pie pan. Served with tortilla chips... party guest approved!

A hit! I loved eating this with pita bread and chips. This is defintely a good guy's meal. My boyfriend loved it. I am a newbie when it comes to cooking and this was very easy. Add a nice amount of cheddar cheese on the top. Don't be scared to vary the ingredients a little. I wil luse a hot, hot pepper next time to spice things up!

Added garlic, onion, and chili powders and a can of green chilies. Still bland. Maybe homemade chili?

Better than I imagined it would be.  They inhaled it.  For the chili I used the Cincinnati Chili recipe from this website.  This is a keeper for our family!

This was crazy good!  I added a few things but just for personal preference.  I halved the recipe and used a can of chili with no beans.  I had leftover taco meat and added that in too with a few drops of Tabasco and ground chipotle peppers.  So good.

It was a good party dip, I used turkey chili, next time I'll use homemade chili only because anything from a can urks me. Too much cheese! next time I'll use less.

I've always called this Chili Cha Cha Dip.  I layer the cream cheese and then the chili, but then I layer some chopped onion and chopped black olives and then cover with a Mexican blend cheese

Good dip. Used one can of chili instead of two in a 7x11 glass dish for 25 mins. Needed more time to slightly brown the cheese.

Very tasty. Very easy to make with ingredients I often have on hand. Made this for a small group. Leftovers heated up nicely in the microwave and my husband and I polished it off day 2 as a snack. This dip is thick and my standard tortilla chips broke too easily in it. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll get the scoop-type chips for dipping since they're a bit sturdier for this rich cheesy manly dip.

GLHood, You and are are in the same boat.  I go through the same thing.  My husband and his three brothers get together, I end up making 2-9x13 pans.  I only get to clean the pans.

Huge hit at our OSU party. I don't eat pork or beef, so I made with a can of spicy organic vegan chili. I also cut the recipe in half, added 1 tsp of chili powder and 1 tsp of paprika. Left it in pot to marinate overnight and served warm the next day. I should have made the whole amount - it was gone in less than 2 hours and people wanted more! =]

I've been making this for years without a recipe.  I always cut in half and put in a pie plate and always use Monterey Jack cheese.  It's amazing how good this recipe is, yet so simple.  I use vegetarian chili.

This was delicious but I had to make a few changes. I added some garlic powder and onion powder to the cream cheese. I also diced up some jalapenos and added them to the chili. I used the spicy beanless chili because I hate beans. It turned out super yummy. My kids absolutely love it!

Very good and addictive. I gave it only 4 stars because I jazzed it up a bit per the suggestions of others. I added some onion and garlic powder and chopped jalapenos. Then I topped it with green onions. This is a big party favorite.

I did a smaller version of this, using 1 pkg cream cheese, 1 can all meat, steak chili and 8 oz cheese. It took more like 25 minutes to get bubbly. Served with tortilla chips. Everyone really loved it!

This is a good recipe. I like to add about a 1/2 to 1 cup of salsa to the cream cheese. It gives it a nice kick. Then I serve it with natchos or tortilla chips. Oh, and one last thing. I skip the oven completely and just pop it in the microwave.

Have been making this recipe since the 1980's and it is SO easy and SO good.  Have had numerous requests for the recipe.  And, I second the opinion that it is just as good with beans or without in the chili.
