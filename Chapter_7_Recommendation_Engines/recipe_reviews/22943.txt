This was really great.  I made some modifications based on what I had in the cupboard, as well as other reviewer's comments.  I used 2% milk instead of cream, which worked out fine.  I sauteed 1 clove of garlic, minced, and about 1/4 cup chopped white onion with the carrots.  I reduced the dried seasoning amount to 1 Tbsp, even though I doubled the rest of the sauce ingredients, and I used Italian Seasoning in place of the basil and parsley.  The flavor was really intense!  I served it with plain mashed potatoes (because I added garlic to the sauce) and a good fresh baked bread.  I liked it a lot, and my husband did too. Thanks for the recipe!

I browned the medallions in butter and chopped garlic, then added 1/2 cup chicken broth (mix in the flour here) to the hot pan. I used fresh basil and parsley, carrots, spinach and mushrooms. Served it with roasted garlic smashed potatoes as suggested, but this is great with pasta too. Yummy

I made this twice because I wasn't satisfied with it the first time. This is one of those recipes that everyone needs to tweak to their own liking. The second time I made it, I doubled the sauce, added garlic, a pinch of sugar  and capers and used alot less basil.  The basil tends to overpower the flavor of the meat and sauce.  Next time, I will add some mushrooms.

Very nice. It gives a nice flavour to the meat, and it remains very tender. I've added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic while frying the carrots for extra flavour. Quick and easy recipe, Great.

YUM! I changed a few things to accomodate what I had on hand...I used milk with a little bit of sour cream, chicken stock and fresh lemon juice for the sauce (doubled it of course) and added chopped onion and garlic with the carrots.  The sauce was delish over our smashed potatoes.  I will be making this again soon!

This recipe is easy to prepare and tasty.  I use fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and add mushrooms.  Next time I may add some onions as well.  Best made d on a cold day, since it is rich and can be a bit heavy.

This was fantastic and so easy.  It tasted like it took forever to make.  I did double the sauce part of the recipe and then poured it over the red potatoes I fixed.  Yummy!!

I've made this twice now.  Very easy and simple, yet elegant and has a wonderful taste.  The sauce is a little thin so I doubled the flour and that did the trick for me. I also used half and half which worked out fine. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband adores this recipe.  I used milk instead of cream (didn't have cream) and it still turned out very nicely!  The sauce really compliments the pork!

This is my family's favorite recipe using pork tenderloin from now on.  In fact, it just might be my family's favorite recipe overall!  Next time I think I'll try adding a little broth to make more sauce, though.  Mushrooms might be a nice addition as well.  Either way, this dish was delicious and easy to make.  I'm planning on serving it the next time we have company.

This was great. I added dijon mustard to the mix, about 1TBS. I love the extra tang it gives. We love mustard though. Doubled the sauce and served with red potatoes. I did not add carrots. It didn't sound like it fit. Frankly it was a week night and I did not feel like chopping. Turned out wonderful! -- Also did this with a whole loin 2 lb. Browned it, poured sauce over it, covered cooked at 325 for 1.5/2 hours took top off top, cranked the heat to 400 got a little crust and reduced sauce.. Yum!!

Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this recipe, because I did change the recipe quite a bit.  I doubled the sauce, added onions and garlic and used 2 lbs of pork tenderloin.  I used milk in place of the cream and used fresh herbs (right at the end) in place of the dried.  I also forgot to add the beef bouillon.  The end result was ok - my hubs liked it better than I did.  I just found that there was not a lot of big flavor and the sauce kind of separated during the final 20 minute cooking time.

Wow...this is SO yummy.  I took other reviewers' suggestion and cut the amount of basil in half.  I also added fresh garlic and onions to the carrot mixture for extra flavor.  Instead of using light cream, I used fat free sour cream.  It gave it a creamy mixture with a bit more flavor.  The pork was so tender you didn't even need a knife!

I wish I could give this more stars!  We loved this, it was so delicious!! I used advise from different reviews and modified the seasoning - I used 1tsp basil, 1tsp Italian seasoning, and everything else the same as the recipe is written. Oops I also added garlic & onion (I usually add these to almost everything I make unless it would clash too much.) We also tried making more 'sauce' as many suggested - I used 1c cream and 1/2c wine. We did have leftover sauce because I was the only one who wanted it over my potatoes but the flavor was scrumpteous!!

Delicious and easy!  I used evaporated milk instead of light cream and didn't have any dried parsley, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Served with yukon gold mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again!

Used 1% milk (no need to use cream, really), doubled the sauce, used italian seasoning and added minced onions & garlic as per one other reviewer. AWESOME!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is one of the best recipes I've ever tried from AR, and at this point I've eaten over 300 of them!  It's a company-worthy dish that is very easy to prepare.  I planned to make it exactly as written, but in the middle of preparation I discovered I had no basil (HOW did that happen???) and I substituted Italian Seasoning.  I liked the result so well I will probably go that route in the future.  I served it over penne, and next time I would definitely double the sauce.  This is outstanding, and I highly recommend it.

This turned out pretty good, but something seemed like it was missing flavor-wise. It was eaten by kids ages 2-19, so that's a plus! I doubled the gravy to make sure there was enough to pour over the rice.

This is one of my husband's favorite meals. We eliminated the carrots and added mushrooms, garlic, and onions. We used only 1 ts of basil and doubled the flour, cream and wine and served it all over oregano garlic mashed potatoes.

This was SO EASY AND DELICIOUS! This took a total of 40 minutes start to table. And that was cutting the tenderloin, into medallions,too. I followed exactly. Whole family gave five star. Served with fresh mushrooms (cooked in the sauce) It did separate the sauce but I was going for an all-in-one-pan meal,not for company;so that was okay. Also, added fresh snow pea pods the last 2 minutes. Quick, healthy, low-carb and delicious one pan meal! I want to try it with fresh herbs next time to give it a little "fresher flavor".  Great recipe, Carrie!

Great base recipe. I used Chervil (same ancestry as Parsley) instead of Parsley and a tbsp of Pesto without Pine nuts instead of dried Basil. I also added fennel since Chervil has an anise flavor. Excellent. I bet you could even add a little dijion mustard for some bite. Might try that next time. Meat turned out really tender and the sauce would be great over pasta.

This was very good.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and half and half (couldn't find light cream, but figured this was close).  This was easy to make but tasted like it took a long time!

Yum! I had fresh basil & parsley which, in my opinion, really enhanced the flavor. Instead of serving with mashed potatoes, I served it over fettuccine & garnished with a little extra fresh basil & fresh diced tomatoes. Delizioso!

Very Good!!  My husband and I enjoyed this very much!  Only thing I did different was add capers as someone else had suggested, but I only added them because I happened to have some to use up!  Thanks for sharing this easy dinner recipe!

yum, I use the sauce for roasts, chicken, pork chops, and I use fresh basil!  Just change the beef bouillon to chicken and use accordingly!

Outstanding, I did add 1/2 an onion and 1 tsp of minced garlic when I sauteed the carrots. I also doubled the liquids and cut the basil to 1 tsp. My son thanked me for making this. So easy and so good. Thanks for the recipe.

This right here is some tasty eats!  I used fresh parsley (more of it), white pepper (which gave it a little zing) and I sliced the carrots instead of mincing them and finagled it on the grill...because it is a bit warm outside..turned out awesome!!  Thank you so much Carrie, I will be using this again.

Delicious with these changes: sauteed pork in olive oil, grated carrots added 4 cloves of garlic and 1/2 onion chopped, and replaced beef granules with chicken stock.

I can't tell you how many times I have made this recipe. It's WONDERFUL!!!  I do substitute 3/4 Cup of Beef Broth instead of the bouillon granultes.  Very easy recipe and the taste is Great, even my 8 year old loves it!  Thanks for the recipe, this is a keeper in our house.

Pretty good!  I subbed Herbs de Provence for basil and parsley.  I also used 1% milk and 1/4 cup of sour cream in place of light cream.  I bought a smithfield boneless tenderloin and sliced it - sliced beautifully and cooked following directions and it was perfect.

This was amazing! I absolutely loved it. My husband had trouble with it being tenderloin being used in this (he is a snob, feels sauces should be used for lesser cuts of meat), so I will be using this recipe with other cuts of meat. I did subsitute the white wine with chicken stock, and I used heavy cream because that is what I had in my fridge.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! Simple, readily available ingredients, and so delicious. I used Half and Half instead of cream, and I added minced garlic to the sauce. Husband agrees that adding cashews would add a delightful texture to this dish; although only when we are splurging as it would add quite a bit of calories and fat. My three year old son ate it up and wanted more. I made extra sauce, although I'm not sure it was necessary; I used the sauce to flavor my steamed asparagus; yum! I added the ingredients by sight, instead of measuring and it still turned out wonderful. I paired the pork with roasted rosemary red potatoes and will do that again. This is a simple recipe that I will use when I am cooking for company.

Really love the concept of this dish. Because I can't help myself.....these are my changes. I added my homemade basil pesto, fresh picked Chantrell mushrooms, red pepper flakes, Spanish sweet paprika, chunks of Provolone cheese and Old Bay Seasoning. Big bold flavour in a creamy sauce. Love it.

Blah. Neither my fiance or I were fans of this. I was expecting a very flavorful dish, but to my disappointment, this was anything but.... I even added 1/4 cup chopped onion and a couple (large) minced garlic cloves to my carrot mixture during the sauteeing step. Because I couldn't find a 3/4 lb. pork tenderloin (I halved this recipe, but kept the sauce equivalents as is to ensure enough to cover our potatoes), I purchased a package of brown & serve pork chops that were approximately 1/2 - 3/4 inch thick. I pounded each a bit to give the appearance of a cutlet. One positive (I'm searching here...) is that my sauce thickened nicely. It seems that many had a problem with this (?). My sauce was a tad thin after having covered my chops (i.e. water condenses on lid and then drips into the sauce, diluting it), but I was able to fix the problem by bringing to a quick boil and stirring frequently for a minute or so. I think it would be wise to simmer everything UNCOVERED to prevent this. Served wtih garlic mashed potatoes (we LOVE garlic!), peas and breadsticks, this was a filling meal nonetheless. Thanks for sharing anyways!

It was a little bland (needs a bit more pepper) and added 1 tsp of minced garlic. Also the 20 minutes cooking time is a little low, actually cooked for 35 mins, until no longer pink inside.  Good basic recipe and sauce adds visual appeal.

My husband and I aren't huge fans of meals based around pork - but this sounded like a winner - and indeed it was!  Will make again!  Like other reviewers I added more liquid / seasonings to create more sauce.

This was delicious!  I cooked a few cloves of garlic in the pan before browning the tenderloins, and skipped the carrots (I put them in the salad!)  I also substituted chicken broth and some sugar for the wine.  It was so good, and so easy!

Great recipe - I also modified somewhat; I eliminated the carrots and used mushrooms instead; I also sauteed 1 shallot and 2 lg garlic cloves.  I used fresh parsley ~ just because I had it on hand. And, I doubled the wet ingredients and added 2 tsp of pork gravy mix along w/the flour (based on other reviews)to thicken the sauce...very tasty!  Easy to make and it can be dressed up or down :)

If I could give this 20 stars I would!!!  The meat was so tender and tasty!  I used FF milk and a bit of butter, because I had no light cream.  I also added minced onion with the other herbs.  I served it over whole wheat egg noodles.  I can't wait to make again!!!

I'm not a fan of pork, but found this recipe to be the best I have ever tried. Great flavor. I used half the amount of basil and a whole can of beef stock instead of the bouillon. I also used cooking sherry instead of the wine. I will be sending this recipe to my father who loves Pork.

Quick and easy. Used a can of whole baby carrots instead of fresh carrots. Added some garlic powder and salt as well as some additional fresh basil at the end of cooking (also used the dried at the beginning). Used heavy whipping cream and used additional amounts. It was great tasty and served with plain couscous. Kids all ate it and really liked everything about the dish. Not to herby and definately not water. Will make again.

Really yummy!  The most elegant recipe for pork I've tried.  I'd probably add more carrots next time since we love them and 1/2 cup isn't that much.  A definite keeper.

This was a great recipe. I did change it up a bit by using diced onions instead of carrots. I thought it had great flavor. I did use fresh herbs at the end as one reader had suggested. I did not double the sauce but just added a bit more milk instead of cream. It did as another reader also commented as the sauce separated towards the end but I just whisked it a bit and it blended somewhat. (could be because I added a splash of milk?) It did not change the great flavor.  Will be making this again for sure. Thanks for sharing!

This is  so yummy. The sauce is outstanding.I am not sure what the reason for  the minced carrots wereThey took too long to cook and by the time  I added the pork the carrots were too browned so I scraped them out and was still  great. I  found the sauce to be too thick so i did need to add some milk to thin it. This is a keeper for sure

I made this for a dinner I had for 20 people.  I used italian seasoning lightly sprinkled over the chops as they were browning.  Once the chops were browned I simmered my carrots in the drippings and then cooked a double batch of the cream sauce.  I prepped everything the night before and then cooked in my nesco roaster  for like an hour at 300 degrees and served with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh corn.  I had rave reviews from my guests.

I got a thinner pork tenderloin so I had smaller medallions. I'll repeat if I catch a thicker batch. It has a creamy and simple taste. I paired it with garbanzo tomato soup and it was dee-lish!

Found this recipe while looking to make a birthday dinner for my uncle who has a gluten allergy.  Based on other reviews I used 2 lbs. of tenderloin and doubled the sauce, but did NOT double the parsley and basil.  I substituted corn starch for the flour (for Uncle Gene) and used mushrooms in place of the carrots (not a carrot fan).  It turned out great and I'm making it again tonight! Thanks for the recipe!!

My family enjoyed this.  I didn't have carrots, so I skipped that part.  I browned pounded medallions, seasoned with a bit of black pepper.  Based on other reviews, I doubled the sauce ingredients. I didn't have bouillon granules, so I softened two bouillon cubes with a touch of boiling water.  I substituted 2 T of homemade Italian seasoning for the basil and parsley.  (I don't care for the taste of dried parsley.)  If I had fresh basil and parsley, I might have used them instead.  I was tempted to add dried rosemary and minced garlic, but these flavors were already in the Italian mix.  I used 4 tsp flour and 1 tsp black pepper with the herbs.  I stirred in my bouillon mixture and 1/4 c wine (wasn't sure if we would care for it doubled).  This made a thick mixture which I added to the warmed 1 1/3 c cream.  Actually, I only had about 1/2 cup cream and used 1% milk for the rest.  I added the pork back in and simmered for about 15 minutes.  I would definitely recommend doubling the sauce ingredients to the quantities I used.  I actually added in a touch more milk as the sauce got a little too thick.

It sounds like I made a lot of changes, but really I just had to accommodate what I had on hand.  This was easy to make - even the first time.  I would definitely make it again for my family.  I think there is plenty of opportunity to adjust the sauce flavors if you want.  I would have loved a touch of Dijon, but my daughter would not have eaten it.

This dish was nice and easy but still had a fancy look to it.  Made for Valentine's day dinner and it was a hit! I did follow some of the other reviewer's advice and doubled the sauce which was good since I wanted to serve it over potatoes.

Very rich.  I served it on egg noodles.  I added onion and garlic, reduced and grated the carrot, sweat all the veggies in a tbsp of butter, doubled the wine, and added enough broth to cover meat as it simmered.  Turned out like a pork stroganoff.  Next time I may use bacon instead of butter to upp the pork ante.

This is an excellent base recipe.  I added diced onion and minced garlic with the carrots, and sliced mushrooms with the basil/parsley.  I used fresh basil since I have a ton of it growing outside.  I didn't have light cream, but I did have heavy cream and nonfat milk, so I used about 1 part heavy cream and the rest nonfat milk.  Everyone loved this, and I will definitely make it again!  Thanks!

A really great dish!  I used milk instead of cream and fresh parsley instead of dry.  I doubt that would make much of a difference but it turned out really well.  Even my 8yr old LOVES it!

I made this as directed, and there were too many herbs, not enough liquid.  I added wine to try and thin the sauce, and while the pork was very tender, my family didn't like it.  Some reviewers recommended doubling the sauce, I would recommend doubling the cream and wine, but not the spices.  That would have improved the recipe.

This is a good basic recipe.  I made a few changes to it so I can't base my rating on the original recipe.  I added garlic and chopped onions to the carrots, used half heavy cream and half water because I didn't have light cream, and I doubled the gravy/sauce part of the recipe.  Next time I make this I will add mushrooms.  My very picky family loved the flavors and have requested that I make this recipe again.  Thank you for a good recipe!

This was delicious.  I doubled the sauce ingredients, but not the spices and it was plenty herby enough.  This is one recipe that we are sure to make over and over.

I like cream sauces so I thought this recipe was good.  I did tweak it a bit:  sautéd onions and garlic instead of carrots, used milk and a bit of sugar instead of cream and then added a bit more flour to thicken, 1 tsp. basil instead of 1 Tbsp.  Added a bit of salt too.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have cream, so I used milk. I didn't have wine, so I used chicken broth.  I doubled both of those for more sauce.  I also served it over a bed of rice.  So good!

Very tasty!  Loved the spices, but was a bit sweet.  So the next time I make it, I'll leave out the carrots and add onion, garlic and mushrooms instead.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  My husband loved it!

I did not care for the taste of the white wine and carrot combo...for me, it did not work well with the pork.  I was truly hoping for a more traditional cream sauce.

After a few modifications this was phenomenal!  I doubled the sauce based on other reviewers suggestion, but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't love a ton of sauce (I do love a lot, but I still had approx. 3/4 cup leftover).  I sauteed 1/2 of a minced yellow onion and 2 cloves minced garlic with the carrots.  I also used about 1/4 cup fresh minced parsley which I added right after adding the cream.  (I did NOT double the dried basil, just added a pinch more).  Served with  garlic redskin mashed potatoes but next time I might try egg noodles.

This is the only way I cook pork tenderloin from now on.  I use this creamy sauce for other recipes too like chicken or pasta.  I love it with loads of taragon.  Yummy

This was just OK. It really doesn't bring out the flavor of the pork, but instead hides it in a heavy sauce. Pork tenderloin is sooo tender, it doesn't need a heavy sauce. Thanks, but I'll stick to my Emeril Lagasse recipe for tenderloin.

I made this recipe with two modifications, I used extra broth instead of the wine, and at the end I added two big squirts of Dijon mustard, this added great flavor.  I had tasted it at the end for seasonings and probably because I left out the wine it was lacking in flavor, but the Dijon Mustard did the trick this recipe was rated a keeper by my family of 6.

I used Napa Valley Vineyards Chardonnay for the sauce. Simmering time was less than 20 minutes on low. I turned the heat off in 10 minutes and let the residual heat finish cooking the pork. I added salt to taste. The pork came out tender, and the sauce was delicious over a bed of yolk-free egg noodles. The dish looked delicious, tasted wonderful, and took less than 30 minutes to complete (a big plus for me). Thank you.

Made this recipe for dinner last night and used some left over tenderloin. 2 of the kids liked it, 2 didn't care for it too much because of the amount of basil and parsley. I used half and half to make the sauce and ended up adding more milk to make it more "saucy". I served over white rice. I enjoyed it, but will have to do a little "tweaking" next time to please the palates of the kiddos! thanks for sharing!

This was very flavorful.  Be careful how long you simmer these, the thickness of your medallions will determine the length of time. I cut mine about 1/2 inch thick and 20 minutes was too long, they were a bit dry.  I will watch that closer next time.  My family likes highly seasoned food so I will also add some salt and pepper as well.

Results are quite good with the modifications others had suggested such as onion, garlic added with the carrots, which I more than doubled.  Still sauce was a little bland, so I added half teaspoon of low sodium chicken stock granules, did the trick.  Super easy and quick to prepare. Served with mashed potatoes, and steamed broc and cauliflower. Everyone enjoyed it. Thanks.

I'm not a big pork eater but had tenderloin and had to do something with it so I tried this. I doubled the gravy per previous reviews, using milk and just beef broth. I added green onions and mushrooms to the carrots to increase the veg content. Overall it was good but I didn't think the meat had much flavor tho the gravy made up for that for the most part. I'd make it again.

This recipe has a pleasant flavor but nothing outstanding.  I did have to make more sauce for my gravy-loving husband, though.

Really good and relatively easy.  Used thin cut pork chops and heavy cream because that's what I had availabe.  A keeper.

This was unbelievable!!  The minced carrots gave kicked up the presentation so it looked pro!!  My entire family absolutely loved it.  I over 2 pounds of pork so I doubled the sauce which was great because we used it as a sauce on our broccoli!  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing!

I made this last night and was it ever good.  However I did not have pork only turkey tenderloin.  It was excellent with the turkey.  I did add the onion and garlic also.  My family loved it so next time I will try pork as I am sure it is just as tasty.

I've made this twice now and my husband and I just love it!  I use chicken bouillion instead of beef (just cause that's what I have on hand) and add a little more wine than the recipe calls for.  :) One of our favorite meals, by far! The sauce is exquisite!

This dish wasn't stellar. Even though I added minced garlic and onions, and mushrooms, and rosemary, to the browning pork medallions, it never transcended "blah." I would also advise cutting down the final simmering time. Everyone else at dinner declared it to be either "fine" or "good." Without higher praise, this warrants three stars. You can find more flavourful uses for your pork tenderloin.

I dont give 5's out very often but this was excellent. I skipped the carrots and added 'shrooms instead. Served it with garlic mashed 'taters and a spinach salad. EXCELLENT. Even my son ate it and said it was a keeper. Thanks!

I made this recipe using boneless center cut pork chops and mushrooms, onions and garlic in the sauce instead of carrots.  It blew us away! It was sooooooo Yummy!  I am going to make this for a church dinner that is coming up soon.  Thanks!

OK, but a little heavy for my taste.  I also added onion and garlic to the sautee as others had suggested and partially cooked the tenderloin in the oven to ensure thoroughly done. The sauce was good, but maybe better with chicken tenderloin instead?

With the huge amount of spices in this recipe you would think it would have a strong bold flavor.  However, this pork smelled and tasted blah.  Maybe it would have been better with a little garlic or parmesan cheese, but we did not enjoy it at all.  Also, maybe this recipe would be better if fresh spices were used instead of dried, and less amounts of them. sorry!

I made this recipe as is. EXCEPT I doubled the ingredients in the sauce except the herbs. I used heavy whipping cream and used a little bit of milk as I didn't have quit enough whipping cream to completely double the recipe. I also cooked the pork-I used strips which were a little bit thick-almost until it was done. I was afraid the pork wouldn't be cooked enough with just 5 minutes of browning. I served this over mashed potatoes and it was simply divine. Everyone just LOVED this recipe. Don't listen to the other picky reviewers and make this recipe!!!

This was absolutely delicious. I used a whole Tenderloin and sliced it. I could have bathed in the herb cream sauce...it was divine!! Thanks for sharing this - it will soon become a personal classic of mine.

This was very good.  My family loved it!  I used milk  and a bit of sugar in place of the cream and sherry instead of wine. I needed to up the milk  to 1 1/4 because the sherry  was a bit overpowering for my taste.  I added some garlic to the recipe and served it with menestra (orzo) and gren beans.

I am giving this 5 stars.  Carrots in the sauce was a bit odd to me at first, but I figured it was a way to sneak in added veggies to the menu!  I used fresh basil rather than dried, and this with the carrots made for a colorful appetizing "gravy" that(I think) would be good over mashed potatoes.  Next time, I think I will add cut spinach & mushrooms to sauce also.  Great recipe..& a great way to cook pork.  Thanks Carrie...!

This was easy and delicious.  I used the sirloin pork chops instead of tenderloin and it was very tender.  While browning the pork, I did sprinkle it with seasoning and salt and garlic pepper to add to the taste.  The entire family loved it!

This was wonderful. Used boneless sirloin pork and per previous reviews doubled the sauce recipe. I didn't have any wine in the house so added a splash of white wine vinegar. Served with noodles. Just great, a real keeper.

I did add more carrots to the sauce instead of a half cup and the grocery store didn't have any medallions.  I used boneless butterfly chops instead, but the recipe still had great flavor.  A little extra zing.  :)  I've already made it again since I loved it so much.  The sauce really helps in making the pork a little more tender.

We've made this several times and everybody who has tried it has loved it.
If you're not concerned about fat content, it's even better with heavy cream
instead of light.

It works nicely with red meat too if you substitue red wine for the white!

An easy and delicious recipe. I substituted whole milk instead of cream and used italian seasoning instead of parsley. I doubled the sauce and it was great served over rice. My 3 year old and 17 month old loved it too.

I omitted the flour and beef bouillon, added 1 tsp salt, and replaced the cream with scd legal yogurt to make it comply with special dietary needs.  Turned out great.  Maybe next time only 3/4 tsp though.

Like others I made tweaks and both DH and I really enjoyed it.
TWEAKS Double the sauce, used milk vs cream. 1/2 the basil of the original recipe, sautéed 1/2small onion and 1 clove garlic with the carrots, added sautéed mushrooms to the sauce as dish was simmering. 
Served with steamed broccoli and buttered noodles.  Like another reviewer noted, the sauce did separate but not a huge issue and would definitely make this again.

This was really good! I served the sauce on baked squash as a side, and that was nice. I wonder if you could get away with dealcoholized wine, or even white grape juice in this? I'll try it next time.

I've looked for ages for a pork tenderloin recipe that keeps it moist and tasty.  I've finally found one in this recipe.  I've made it several times and we always love it.  It makes great leftovers as well.

I used a beef boullion cube instead of the granules because that's what I had.  It was easy and delicious.  this recipe could also be used with chicken or veal.

Would give it 5 stars with these changes: Cook mushrooms in margarine and then add chopped onions. Cook onions until soft. Add 3 cloves grated garlic to pan along with pork. After browning pork and removing from pan, add flour and beef granules, then deglaze with wine. Next add cream and fresh herbs. Stirred until smooth and returned pork to pan. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.

I made this entree for 50 people. Turned out great! I did add a little more wine and some beef broth to thin the sauce. Served with egg noodles and roasted veggies.

Would definitely make this again.  Like others, I made some modifications:  diced same amount of onions and carrots and added 2 minced garlic cloves (cooked at the beginning), used 1% milk and chicken granuales (didn't have beef), and doubled the sauce part of the recipe.   Served with steamed potatoes.....sauce was awesome in the potatoes.

Delicious! I did make a few substitutions based on what I had available - 2 percent milk instead of cream, white wine vinegar instead of wine, and also doubled the sauce recipe. Added minced garlic and chopped onions while sauteing the carrots, as suggested by another reviewer and it added great flavor to the sauce. Definitely a keeper!

Followed the suggestions to double the sauce and added onion and celery to the carrot. I also used milk instead of cream and didn't have any dried herbs but used a beef bullion and mushroom bullion cube. This was dynamite and my boyfriend told me it was a huge win.

Really good.  I cooked it different than how the recipe calls for because I wanted it off the stovetop and in the oven instead.  I salt/peppered/floured the patted-dry loin and the seared in a pan on the stove until browned.  Then I added some white wine and chicken broth along with all of the spices (excluding flour and cream), the carrots and a chopped onion in the pan and cooked that for a bit.  Then poured that down over the pork in a casserole dish and baked it at 350 for 45 minutes covered in foil. Then I removed the liquid and veggies and added some cream and corn starch to thicken.  Was really good gravy on both the pork and mashed potatoes.

I'm rating this for the sauce (which was great), because I roasted my pork tenderloin.  I added some of the pan juices and some seasoning (salt, pepper, granulated garlic) because I found it to be a little bland as written, perhaps because I used skim milk rather than cream.  Also added mushrooms.  It was really good, thanks!

It was okay.  I made it as directed w/o changes.  I thought it was rather bland and will probably try it again with some of the additions others recommended.

My whole family really liked this very tender dish with great flavor. I used vegetable base instead of beef bouillon, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream, cut a few sprigs of fresh basil and parsley, and halved the carrots, adding that 1/2 amount of Macintosh apple bits on top for the simmer.  I would serve this to my mother in law!

Simple and delicious.  Can be adapted to your own tastes.  First time I made it, I made it with fried onions & peppers in place of the carrots, doubled the sauce ingredients, & made a huge mistake as SOMEONE removed the dried parsley from my container and substituted hot peppers dried from the garden.  Thank goodness I noticed before I shook in 1 tablespoon of hot pepper, but it was still great. Have also made with 1/2 heavy cream & 1/2 of half 'n half for a richer sauce to go with pasta.  Awesome.  Great recipe...easy to tweak.

I make this a single serving meal that only requires rice, no salad or other vegetable.  I had a 7.2 ounce pork tenderloin which I cut up into 9 medallions about 1/2 inch thick each and I used my 10 inch cast iron skillet.  Set the initial left rear (large) electric stove burner to 4.5 and put in about 1 to 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil.  When hot (not smoking) put in 1/4 cup of diced carrots and cook for about 5 minutes watching to make sure the carrots brown a little but don’t burn.  Add the pork medallions and brown on both sides.  After the medallions are initally flipped add 1/6 red and 1/6 yellow diced pepper, 3 diced garlic cloves, 1/3 large diced jalapeno pepper and 1 slice of a large diced onion.  When browned on both sides, remove the pork (keep warm) and add flour, basil, parsley, Italian seasoning and black pepper.  Stir in cream (I used about 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream, a 4 second blast of 5 calorie no fat whipping cream) and 3 medium sized diced white mushrooms.  When thickened add about 1/2 cup white wine (Pinot Grigio), turn the stove to ‘low’, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes.  Make sure the cream sauce remains a runny thick and doesn’t burn.  Add more wine if necessary.  I serve over basmati rice.  This is really about 2 servings or one very, very large serving and is absolutely creamy delicious!

This sauce was delicious, but my pork was a little overcooked.  Next time I will have to watch it a little closer and/or turn it all the way down.  Also, I added onions & garlic to the carrots, did not have a good white wine so substituted with chicken base/bouillon in water with a little splash of marsala.  Additionally, would recommend making double the sauce & serving with rice.

This was very good, We used pork chops instead of pork loin. I toned down the spices and seasoned the pork with Lawrys seasoning salt. My husband and I are not big pork chop lovers and this was really no exception, But it is probally of the better pork chop recipes we have tried.

This is EXCELLENT. Used half & half as I had that on hand - I also kept the amount of sauce the same, but only fixed enough pork to serve 2-3.  That way I had plenty of sauce to enhance the couscous I used on the side along with  steamed broccoli.

I needed a sauce for some leftover pork loin from last night so I tried this one and was not disappointed. I made a few changes. I sauteed the carrots with garlic and minced onion. I added a can of mushrooms and I also used half and half since it's what i had. I also had bouillon cubes and not granules so I added a 1 cube. I sliced the pork and reheated it in the sauce. It gave the meat a great flavor and we had a whole new meal with left over pork. Served with white rice but I bet it would go great with potatoes or pasta too.

A great sauce to tinker around with.  As did others, I added garlic and used half&half instead of light cream.  It tasted the best with mashed potatoes; a forkful with pork, potatoes, and the sauce was excellent!

This was a pretty good base to start with and alter to your liking.  Per other reviews I added some onion and fresh garlic and only had 2% milk on hand.  To me the basil was a little overpowering and I like the stuff.  So, next time I will alter the spices a little and probably try the cream although using the milk turned out good too.

My teenager, who hates when I try new recipes, actually liked this. Hurray! It really took only 45 minutes from start to sit-down as the recipe states. I didn't add wine (didn't have any) and used skim milk instead of cream because it's all I had. I used fresh basil and parsley instead of dried. The sauce, though thin as you would expect, was delicious! The fresh herbs were very flavourful and the carrot base is so great. Thank you for a quick, easy, and tasty tenderloin recipe! I'll definitely make this again.

I'm so happy this recipe has such good reviews because I would hate my three star rating to affect that. Personally, I had to jump thru hoops in order to make this sauce flavorful. As written it was quite bland, so I added garlic and onion powders, chives, like "Ruth," dijon mustard and finally I decided to throw in a bit of fortified wine to offset the milky taste. I must say the end result was very good and my family truly enjoyed it. Thank you for a good starting point!

While the flavor of the sauce was excellent, for our tastes, it was a little heavy for such a tender, delicate cut of meat.  We liked the sauce so much that we have since used it on bonless chicken and the meal was fantastic.  Nothing wrong with the recipe just our tastes..  Thanks.

Although I followed previous reviewers suggestions of adding onion and garlic the recipe still lacked in taste. I ended up adding a tablespoon of dijon mustard to the sauce.

Very tasty. At others suggestions I doubled the sauce, & added a touch of garlic. Used reg milk as well and added mushrooms, but used the amount of basil & parsley that the original recipe called for. Will make this again & serve over egg noodles!

thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe - my family loved it!!  I felt the spices might be too much for my 8 year old but she ate her whole plate and asked for seconds.  I am going to add mushrooms, artichokes, etc the next time!

Made this for dinner with the Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe.  Had some leftover Pork Tenderloin, so I cut down the cooking time and added celery to the sliced carrots.  It turned out to be an excellent dinner - will add this to my repetoire.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made the original recipe many many times. Delish! The only thing different I now do is add Tastefully Simple's Spinach and Herb dip mix instead of the basil. Very simple and easy to make. Makes a nice tasty gravy.

This recipe was good - my son loved it but my husband thought it was just ok. Like many others, I doubled the sauce to serve over egg noodles.  Did not use the carrots, did not see them as necessary.  Will make this again, but with little tweeks to please the hubs!  Passing along to my Mom too!

Rave reviews on this dish.  It was a snow store and I was tired of the regular cooking so I went through the freezer and went to this site to find dinner.  It was AMAZING!  It is a regular dish for us now.  I add garlic and make the sauce double or triple so there is enough for rice or mashed potatoes.

I didn't have time to marinate the tenderloin and this recipe didn't call for that.  Although I did not have carrots, I improvised with garlic and onion and it came out very good.  My family all enjoyed it, including my picky 4 year old.  This was a very easy recipe and came out very tasty.  I paired it with smashed potatoes and green beans.

I made this for company and served it with mashed potatoes. The sauce is very nice on the potatoes and is creamy without being heavy. My sauce curdled though, but it still tasted great. I will be more careful when heating after adding the cream next time.

I did not get good reviews from my family they gave it 3 out of 5 stars. I did not find this dish to be very flavorful. I did add chopped onions and 2 cloves of garlic to it and it still didn't help. This recipe is not a keeper.

I love this recipe.  I've tried it with pork chops as well as the tenderloin medallions and it's just as tasty.  I usually double the sauce fixings though, it's good over garlic mashed potatoes.

This is one of those recipes where when you start making it, you think to yourself "what the heck am i making" ...but then it turns out great! I made this with regular boneless pork chops, and it gets a thumbs up. I forgot to grab carrots at the store, but it didn't seem like i was missing anything. Served over wild rice and with steamed broccoli. It was a nice change of pace from the normal breaded pork chops i usually make.

Tasted fine and looked nice but wasn't really worth the extra effort - a nice teryaki grilled tenderloin would have suited me better.

This recipe was very easy to make and not so easy to mess-up! As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the sauce. The only ingredient I changed was fresh parsley instead of dried. I also used rotini pasta. It still came out tasting great and may have helped with the "intense" flavor of the sauce that others commented on when using dried herbs only. The pork comes out very tender and flavorful. I also like that this recipe is very flexible in terms of the ingredients that can be added or included. Next time I'm going to try mushrooms and chopped frozen spinach in the sauce.

For the non-dairy non-gluten folks, use 2 teaspoons of tapioca or arrowroot starch instead of flour, and 2/3 cups of coconut milk instead of cream.  I also added diced red peppers to the sauce, and more spices than called for.  Delicious!

delicious!  my husband raved about the creamy sauce.  i thought it was a little strong, but still quite tasty!  next time i think i'll cut the herbs down and use a teaspoon for each instead of a tablespoon.  quick and easy for sure!  great paired with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh steamed veggies!

Very tasty recipe.  Be sure to get a good tenderloin cut, and don't overcook the meat.  Also, don't omit the carrots--they really add a nice sweetness and texture to this dish.

This was ok, although my sister and husband seemed to really enjoy it.  I thought it was a little herby for my taste so next time I'd probably cut back on the basil and parsley.  I didn't use carrots, but I did saute a chopped onion and garlic in the oil, then browned the medallions on both sides.  I used a Chardonnay for the wine, used fat free half and half. and I did have to double the sauce for the mashed potatoes (just served regular).  Like I said, it was a big hit with my husband and sister, but I would give this another chance and cut back on the herbs a bit.

This turned out really great and wasn't to hard to make.  I was happy to see everyone liked it, hard to do with three kids.  i used some of the modifications i read in the reviews, like milk instead of cream and changed the amount of herbs used.  I will be making this again for sure.

I used 2 lbs. meat.  It was good but we didn't freak out over it.  I should have doubled the sauce, it would have been good over the rice and extra for dipping the meat.  Used chicken broth for the wine and added 1 cloves garlic. Used 3/4 tbsp. of the parsley and basil.

This is pretty good but will try to add in the mushrooms and garlic like others suggested.  I would also probably like it over rice rather than mashed potatos.

I added one garlic glove and onions and decreased the quantities of parsley and basil as I read in some reviews and the result was average, lacking some taste and the texture was a little lacking.  I did substitute milk for the cream so that may be the reason.

This recipe was good.  Even the picky kids liked it.  We used basil instead of sage in the sauce though because of the kids.

I was looking for a pork tenderloin recipe that was not an oriental flair.  I thought this was the one.  It was quick, and easy.  My husband gives me an 'A' for trying new recipes.  However, this one was 'just ok'. It was not flavorful.

This was really good!  I used leftover (already cooked) pork tenderloin and added it for the last 20 minutes of cooking.  And I also used fresh herbs which can really make a huge difference.  Will add this to "the rotation"!

This was really good and easy to make. My husband really liked it alot-he called it a keeper. I would use less pepper next time...it was a bit spicy...and I used fresh sage and basil and dry thyme and rosemary, added garlic and onions. Awesome!

I modified this recipe slightly to use what I had on hand (thyme and oregano instead of basil), and I doubled it to feed our lsrge family and have leftovers for my husband's lunch the next day. My preschool-aged children enjoyed it (my four year old cleared his plate - a rarity!). I loved that it was easy to prepare and it looked so pretty on the plate. I have only made pork tenderloin in the oven so it was fun to try something new. I do think care should be taken when choosing side dishes - I served mashed potatoes and broccoli, and it was kind of blah. I wish I had at least added fresh garlic to the potatoes.

I gave 4 instead of 5 because while I liked it, I wasn't jumping up and down over it. My husband said it was "good" but wasn't oohing and aahing over it like he does when he really loves something. I will most likely make it again, though.

***

After trying this again, I'm upping my rating to 5 stars (from 4). YUMMY! I think I used a better quality of pork the second time around. It was incredible - tender, extremely flavorful, and it reheated really well too!

*** Four years later, this recipe is still in my regular rotation. I have made it for friends when they were sick or just had a baby and they all loved it! I sometimes cook the carrots on the side because my husband will eat them but he doesn't care for them; they are just as good when chopped, steamed, and added later for those who like them. Thank you CARRIEKWF for this recipe that has stood the test of time

The sauce for this was delicious!  I loved the minced carrots in there, it provided a lot of flavor that was undetectable to my family.  I plan to sneak minced carrots into a lot of foods now!  Great recipe!
Thanks!

Used canned carrots, didn’t add until later in the recipe. Doubled the sauce mixture for 2 servings (added ¾ tsp. bacon grease) but not the spices just milk & flour (used half & half in place of light cream). Fiancé felt it could had been less bland. Maybe next time I’ll try some garlic powder/salt or just minced garlic & some onion powder.

Excellent recipe, almost tasted like pesto because of the parsley.  Eat it with mashed potatoes and use the sauce on them as well.  Will definitely make this again.

This was a good recipe. But like others I felt that it needed something. I substituted olive oil and italian seasoning for like items in recipe. Added portabella mushrooms and some celery. Would have liked to have given it a slightly smoky taste with some prosciutto but had none on hand. Served over rice. Sauce was a nice addition to the rice. Was really simple to prepare and is a nice meal change from our normal rotation. Will make again.

This was excellent, simple, and relatively quick.  I misread the quantity for flour and used tablespoons instead of teaspoons, but thinned it with more dry white wine, which gave it excellent flavor.  Followed other suggestions by adding fresh crushed garlic and minced onion to the carrots, and then added sliced baby portobello mushrooms along with the pork.  I used half-and-half  rather than full cream and thought the fat level was not overwhelming.  Definitely put in my "to repeat" box.

This was pretty good.  The sauce had a nice flavor.  We did double the amount of cream and wine as it didn't make very much sauce for our potatoes.

Followed recipe exactly.  Nice appearance but I can think of better things to do with pork tenderloin.  Probably better with fresh herbs.

Carrie, this was delicious.  I didn't have carrots, so I used diced apple with onion and garlic.  I also substituted Cream of Mushroom soup for the cream (diluted it with milk and added the boullion to it). It was very good.  This is my first review after experimenting with a few recipes.  Thanks for a good basic recipe.

Excellent!  Used turkey tenderloin from Jennie-O. I doubled the sauce, and used grated carrot, a 1/2 onion, and 1 clove of pressed garlic. Then I didn't have any parsley, but had some pesto, so I added that. I used part cream, but then I added some plain yogurt.

This was very good...I also added onions and garlic with the carrots.  The sauce it made was great over mashed potatoes.  I will double the recipe next time because we went through the gravey it made really quick!

Yummy!  Hubby and I just finished this for dinner, and both thought it was delicious!  I don't know what's up with some of the other reviews.  How can this dish be bland with all of these herbs?  Anyway, I made it exactly as called for.  It was delicious.  Next time I think I will add onions, garlic, and mushrooms in with the carrots as well.  But, even as is, it is great!  Thank you!

This was the most delicious dish!  I did make a couple of changes...  I added onions and garlic to the carrots...  I also used 1" thick pork tenderloins.  They were so tender and moist!  Served with garlic mashed potatoes.  It was a big hit with my family - daughters included!

Used broth vs. bouillon, added mushrooms, garlic, onion, broccoli and cauliflower along with carrots...used nonfat sour cream instead of the light cream.  Dish was okay but not stellar. Probably wouldn't make again.

Absolutely fantastic dish! It had a great cream taste. I added a small chopped onion and a clove of garlic while cooking the carrots. I will definitely make this dish again!

This was so easy to make and the pork was so tender.  I didn't have any dry white wine so I used a table white wine and it worked well.  All of my guests loved this recipe.

very good, will definately make again.  I had no milk or cream, so I used sour cream.  I needed to "cook off" the alcohol from the wine, and only used afew spoons of sour cream, so not much gravy, but was wonderful any ways.

This was a great dish, although I would recommend adding more white wine and some pepper to the sauce. I have added it to my regular menu rotation and serve it with steamed spinach and rice.

I thought this recipe was just o.k. but the rest of my family seemed to like it a lot, including my picking 11 yr. old, who had 2 helpings!  I thought there was too much basil and the cream sauce didn't go far enough.  It was kind of dry.  I would take previous reviewers' recommendations and use beef broth in place of the beef granules.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

I used less basil than called for and beef stock instead of granules.  Too "herby" and needed lots of salt.  I could have used a can of creamy soup and added fresh herbs for a better result.  The pork was nothing special and depended on the sauce.  I ended up ordering a pizza.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The whole family loved it including my three young girls.  It was easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand, except the light cream, so I used 2% milk and it turned out fine.  We will defintely have this again.

This is a GREAT RECIPE! I had leftover t.loin that I sliced in to medallions and that made it even quicker. I didn't use carrot,used sweet onion instead and substituted 1 cup of water and a chicken bouillon cube for the beef bou. and wine. It thickens very quickly and the water realy helps to make a thinner sauce. I also cut the basil down to 1 teaspoon. The sauce could be used for chicken and fresh steamed vegetables too!

Everyone enjoyed this recipe.  I used 2% milk instead of creme and didn't miss the creme at all!  I think I'll try the sauce on chicken next.  I wasn't sure what to do with the carrots so I diced them and it worked well but will julienne them next time.  Very good!

AWESOME!!  I loved it.  I made boiled potatoes and sauted them in garlic and butter.  Perfect with the herb sauce.

I made this dish for my parents one night, they both loved it.  My mom is quite the gourmet cook, so if she was impressed, I know it was good.  The only thing I'd do differently is thin the sauce out a little - it was pretty thick.  And maybe make a little more.  But the flavor is wonderful!

A pretty tasty recipe.  I think you should premix the flour with water to avoid clumping before adding to pan, but other than that very nice.
