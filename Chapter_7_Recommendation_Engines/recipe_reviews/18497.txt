Five stars of course!--Heck, it's my recipe.
Allrecipes printed my recipe almost to the letter, so I am posting the few minor differences in my original recipe.  I use light olive oil or safflower oil as opposed to the corn oil. When I make the croutons, after the 30 minutes in the 275 oven, I turn off the oven, and let the croutons stay in, until completely cool.  F.Y.I., the baguette should be approximately 1/3 pounds worth.
One last tip---of late, I've substitued the 1/4 tsp. dry mustard, with 2 tsps. of dijon mustard. The dressing comes out creamier, and I really dig the flavor.
Cheers all,
Jeff

OK Jeff, I consider myself an expert on Caesar Salads.  I have always enjoyed the traditional style caesar salad.  The receipe you submited is without doubt the best caesar salad I have ever tasted! The receipe makes for a most robust tasting salad.  Nothing tame about this one.  I have made it a half dozen times for my family and guests, and everyone agrees it the best they have ever had!  Thanks for the posting.  You have done a great justice.

I'm not a salad person but wanted to serve salad to my family.  This was delicious.  My 5-yr old even enjoyed it.  I only added 1/4 Worcestershire to the croutons and it was great.  I used 1 tbsp minced garlic instead of crushed cloves.  And I used 1/4 cup of pasterized egg instead because coddling an egg doesn't kill any present bacteria and will actually increase bacteria activity.  Anyway, try this recipe.  I will make this over and over again.  Thanks, Jeff.

This caesar dressing was fantastic. We did find that it needed a little modification, we added two tablespoons of lemon juice and an extra teaspoon of worcestershire sauce.  It was the hit of the dinner!  Thanks

This recipe is SO good!  It's incredibly flavorful and spicy which was a welcomed change of pace for Caesar salad.  I made this for my family for my Mom's birthday, and it was a huge hit.  The croutons were also a smash hit, everyone loved them.
The only thing I'd change is omitting the salt in the recipe - as the anchovies more than make up for it.  I also didn't use the whole can of anchovies, more like 3/4 of the can.  I'm thinking of using paste next time.

Awesome recipe!!

Very good recipe.  Omitted the anchovies because frankly...didn't have any.  Tastes just like you would get in a bottle or restaurant...and better. Thanks for the post.

This recipe is really easy to whip up - I kind of messed up the coddled egg - I think I didn't leave it in the hot water for long enough.  But I microwaved it a tiny bit and it was fine.  Yummy!

This was very good ceasar salad. The next time I would decrease the salt a little, other than that it was great!

Excellent recipe Jeff!  I booted up the garlic and to make the dressing creamy, I added all the parm to the oil mixture and used a bit more to garnish the salad. Salads don't get much better than this. Thanks so much!

I used this recipe with only three alterations and it turned out fantastic! First, i left out the anchovies as neither my wife nor i like them.  Also, I substituted prepared Dijon mustard for the dry mustard and I used 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise in place of the coddled egg.  This produced a more creamy and less salty dressing that had the perfect Caesar flavor!

Loved it!  Substituted olive oil for the safflower oil because I didn't have any on hand, and omitted the anchovies.  Not sure if I coddled the egg right, but the result was still one of the best Caesar salads we've ever eaten.  Thanks for the recipe.

Ok Jeff, you're my new hero.  This was absolutely "as" delicious as any dressing you would get in a restaurant.  The only change I made is I used the Dijon mustard as recommended by others,left out the anchovy fillets, and just used an egg yolk.  I also double this recipe for one head of lettuce as I prefer a lot of dressing.  This is a keeper.

Okay, I was skeptical.  I've been making Caesar Salad since the 1960's, and I never lacked for compliments.  Actually, I had quit using a recipe 30 years or so ago, and made it by feel, but there is little difference between the way I did it and this recipe.    I had never added Cayenne Pepper, and I don't know that it helped, but it didn't hurt.    HOWEVER, I must admit that your croutons beat mine all to pieces.  I made croutons in a skillet, with olive oil, for years, but had become lazy and had been using (don't tell anyone!) packaged croutons for the past few years.  Well, I have mended my ways.  I know your croutons are better than "bought," and I don't remember my skillet ones being any better, so I'm a believer in your method.    It's hard for an OLD woman (who will be eligible for Medicare in mere months!) to admit she's been bested, or at the very least EQUALED, and on something she loves like Caesar Salad, but Chef Jeff, YOU THE MAN!

This caesar dressing was fantastic.  It is great for anyone looking for a caesar dressing that is not creamy.  One modification I made was I left out the anchovies (I'm not a fan of them) and add a little more salt.  This worked out great.

This was a little too thin; and instead of garlicky it tasted too much of the Worcestershire.

Good, but not great. Loved the croutons. The dressing was a bit strong, but good. If I make it again I'll use less anchovy.

Jeff - you have absolutely outdone yourself.  This was absolutely awesome!!  I told my wife that we wouldn't go out for our "Traditional Friday Night Dinner" - that I would take care of dinner.  I can tell you that she loves me a little more today .... (BEWARE... depending of the brand or archovies you might have to ommit the salt)

Holy mother, the fishy taste from the anchovies was powerful. I had to increase the recipe just to tone it down a bit.  I followed the recipe to a T... but then had to start guessing with ingredients to tone down the fish. (added an extra egg and LOTS of extra lemon juice to offset the taste). Once I did all this it was actually pretty darn tasty!  Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly but add in a few filets at a time instead of the whole contents of the tin.

I didn't think it tasted like a caesar dressing at all!  In fact, I think the coddled egg made me sick and nauseous all night!  The croutons were good though.  I'll be looking for something else...

Yummy! I really enjoyed your version of this salad. I used dijon mustard and a spoon of plain yogurt for creaminess. Otherwise it was outstanding. Way to go Jeff!

Jeff you did your homework well!  Great recipe for the dressing (you've gotta like anchovies to enjoy this one).  I think I'll try the garlic crouton recipe from this website next time though as the croutons were just o.k., but nonetheless, I'm giving this five stars because this will be the recipe I use from now on for the dressing.

This is the BEST !!! I serve this for lunch when I'm having guests. Normally I grill a chicken breast marinated in honey mustard and serve on top. People just go ape over it. A friend asked that I make him a bag of croutons and he took them to his parents house and they ate them watching tv !!
THANKS MUCH !!!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly then I made it again and omitted the egg and anchovies and added I tablespoon of low fat mayo and it was just as good. This made it a lot easier and faster to whip up.

Great Recipe..I did make some changes...my company loved it.  I added light mayonnaise instead of 'raw' egg. Healthier all around. and I use olive oil and about 3 inches of anchovy paste. Alway have that in the house and easier to use ie. no left over chovies.  If is it too thick after the addtion of the mayo add some milk. I used my Magic Bullet too. I love that thing for dressings

Needed a few tweaks - substitued 2 tbs sour cream for egg.  This recipe is far better than most bottled dressings.  Also for my Caesar salads I always add chopped avocado and chopped basil.  It adds a refreshing unique taste.

This was as close to tableside preparation taste as you'll get. Although, I will say that the Worcestershire may be a bit strong for most people's taste. Maybe a little less. 1tsp should suffice.

I was looking for a recipe for Caesar Salad dressing and found this one.  The ingredients were consistent with what I was looking for, so I gave it a try.  Very good - I made it for a crowd and received lots of compliments.  A few things I did differently:  First, I made a paste of the crushed garlic and kosher salt by mashing the garlic and salt together with the back of a spoon.  Secondly, I omitted the cayenne (not a fan of hot) and anchovies (wasn't sure about the tastes of the crowd, so thought I'd play it safe) and substituted a bit of anchovy paste instead.  Will add more next time, because I personally like the anchovy flavor.  Thirdly, I put all the ingredients (minus the egg) in a small food processor to blend before whisking it into the egg.  Last, I added 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese to the dressing.  I also substituted shredded parmesan for the grated Parmigiano Reggiano.  I like the texture of the shredded cheese with the romaine rather than grated.  I used dijon mustard and light olive oil, as suggested.  I really enjoyed it and will definitely make again.  Thanks Jeff!

An amazing dressing with intense flavors!  I love this dressing because you don't have to use much to get a great caesar taste.  I make this whenever I start feeling blah about eating one more salad...works like a charm!  Thanks so much Jeff, great work!

I used a couple slices of wheat sandwich bread for the croutons and they were AWESOME.  Much better consistency than store bought.  Thanks.

Awesome, Jeff! Perfect proportions. This dressing will be my go-to recipe from now on. It's perfect, and I didn't even use anchovies .(I know they make it even better, but can't stand to touch the creepy little things.)

I am usually a caesar salad in a bag gal, but I swear unless I am super pressed for time, I will never go back.  I didn't use anchovies, and I was a little skeptical about coddling an egg, but it all worked out.  Please don't let that disuade (sp?) from trying this recipe.  I used olive oil instead of safflower oil, did not use anchovies because i couldn't find them, I used lemon juice from a bottle, and I cannot believe the results.  I normally always use more garlice than called for, but in this situation I wouldn't .... Jeff must already love garlic and his measurements are spot on!!!  Thanks Jeff...fabulous...whoever put 1 star did something terribly wrong!

OMG!!! I’ve been making this recipe for a few months now & it’s AMAZING!!!  The 1st time I followed the directions to the letter & I thought it was good.  The 2nd time I made a few changes; I used light olive oil instead of safflower oil, ½ the lemon juice & omitted the salt.  I cracked the egg into a small bowl, pierced the yolk with a fork & micro waved about 10-20 sec to take off the chill.  It mixes better with the oil when it’s warm.  For me these changes made this recipe GREAT!!!  The croutons are also good by themselves.  Another reviewer was right:  if you’re looking for low-fat or low-cal this is not for you.  This one is all about taste!

I made this last night because my husband & I both love Caesar salad.  I substituted anchovy paste for the actual fish, because neither of us like strong anchovy flavor.  It was missing something,& the problem was probably that I needed to add more anchovy paste, which I will do next time I make it.  The recipe is definitely a keeper!

I read the other reviews but still decided to make it exactly as written with no changes.  WOW it was salty!  Other than the salt, I had wished the dressing was a bit thicker so that it would cling a bit more to the lettuce.  I am going to try to make it again tonight and cut the salt back and perhaps add some mayo to make the dressing creamier.  The croutons were great though!

This is the bomb.  So tasty and a lot of kick to it.  I added a 4 drops of red wine vinegar and a little Dijon mustard.  Wow!  Best Caesar salad I have ever had.  It is on the spicy side but so delicious!!  My ex-husbands family used to have a Caesar salad contest every Christmas and they could prepare some great salads.  So thrilled I found this one!

I found the dressing very salty.  I even increased the amounts of everything else to counteract it, but still was salty!  won't make it again.  I double checked my measurements and I  followed the recipe exactly.

awsome, even with the substitutions because of lack of some ingredients, e.g.worchestershire sauce, I usually do not use/eat. Can't wait to try it exactly..this may be my new "girl's christmas sleepover dinner" contribution,beating out my famous Goan Potato soup with spiced pea samosas

A great start for a great Caesar salad.   My advice: put all the dressing ingredients into a food processor and blend until a smooth consistency. If you don't, you end up with chunks of anchovies which isn't my cup of tea!  Also, omit the salt. There is no reason to add extra salt when you are using anchovies. Thirdly, I used the oil that the anchovies came in to give it a little bit more flavor. I also substitute whichever oil I have on hand instead of safflower oil.   The last suggestion I have is to refrigerate the dressing before serving. If it is served at true room temperature it has a slightly strange flaor.

Top notch recipe .....great blend of tart and creamy. I'v e been cooking a long time and have to say I'd never coddled an egg which was easy...interesting touch. I've always used a raw egg.  I didn't have any safflower oil so I made this batch with extra virgin olive oil..the only change I made was the oil and I used 4 garlic cloves since I like garlic a lot. But I probably will use 3 cloves next time 4 over powers the dressing somewhat. I also cut the salt back after reading several reviews and since I use the flat anchovies and the oil in the can(not the paste); it worked great. It was also a first to use the mustard power instead of dijon. it was

Since the other posters though the written 3/4 tsp of salt on top of the anchovies, parm and Worst. sauce was too salty I used 1/2 tsp....that seemed good/would not want more. I did not have any trouble getting it to be "not runny" cooking the egg as directed and whisking it up mine was not watery. In fact the first time I made it I left the egg in too long/is was more cooked and my dtr. complained it was TOO thick (more like creamy Caesar) after beating. Real Caesar does not have mayo or sour cream in it...beating the egg and oil creates a mayo-ish base though if done right. Since mine came out too thick for my taste with overdoing the egg a bit though...those wanting it thick could do that on purpose. Lacking French bread I used bagel cubes for the croutons and that worked very well for a hearty bread cube.

I made this as part of our New Year's Eve dinner and I love Caesar Salad and this ranks up at the top with a few changes that I made. I made this twice...once as directed and again with a few minor changes that makes this FANTASTIC! After reading all of the reviews, I decided to add tiny bacon bits that I made from frying up bacon. I also used the recommended Parmesano Regiano freshly grated cheese...which was fantastic! I initially used anchovy paste and after making the first batch I thought it was way too salty. I omitted the salt altogether and just added VERY LITTLE anchovy paste and it was just enough to give it an authentic flavor. I also threw all of the ingredients in our vitamix to mix it together and added the olive oil a little at a time using mayo instead of egg. I would recommend this to eveyone I know...with these few changes. Everyone loved it! I will use this again and again.

Loved it! The croutons turned out amazing and the dressing was great! the only thing i had problems with is that it didnt specifically state how long to keep the egg in the boiled water so i had to google coddling eggs but besides that it was great ! :D Thanks Jeff ^_^

I love this recipe but had issues with my family refusing to eat a caesar because of the " RAW" egg despite my coddling it...SOOO I found a solution that gives a creamy eggy touch.  I soft boil an egg, cut into half...take the moist yolk out and mash it and put that into the rest of the ingredients.  It helps with the taste and emulsification of the oil with the rest of the ingredients.  My family is no long afraid to eat caesar salad and it is safer with the cooked yolk if your dressing other veggies with it for a pot luck dinner and might not be able to keep it cold.  Haven't killed anyone yet with that extra step.  Also if I want to make ahead of time for event 2-3 days ahead I mix it all up with raw egg...then pour dressing into a bottle and seal it then place it in a pan with hot water to the top and let it sit simmering for 10 mins.  That takes can of "cooking" the egg and is safer to use for preparing large amount for a pot luck salad.

This dressing tastes fantastic, very classic and true. I did add a squirt of mayo, maybe about 1/2 Tbl, to make it a bit creamier. I also made it in a small food processor to blend it up and make it more frothy since I found that it was a bit runny. Overall it was great!

Excellent recipe. Made it exactly as stated and added grilled chicken to it to make it a main dish salad. I would recommend doubling the dressing for a 4 person serving as this only made 3 servings and had to be stretched.

This was SO good! I was looking for a great Caesar recipe and this hit the nail on the head. Pungent, garlicky and delicious. I blended the dressing before adding in the egg so that I wouldn't have chunks of anchovy, and I'm glad I did. I used a mix of mustard powder and dijon, as suggested. I STRONGLY reccommend using Reggiano Parmigano... it's quite expensive, but once you taste it, you'll see why. I really enjoyed the homemade croutons as well. So much better than bottled Caesar dressing and boxed croutons!

I really liked this recipe. The dressing did taste better the next day. I made exactly as is with the exception of baking the croutons 15 more minutes because it wasn't the right texture.

This was excellent. I tried the original recipe for a dinner party, as I was supposed to bring the salad. The croutons were great, and the dressing was fabulous, if not a bit spicy.   My next attempt, I toned down the spice, adding only a quarter of the cayenne, and that went down better when I made it for my wife and mother-in-law. They had salad, while I varied it a bit, using some of the dressing to marinade some chicken breast in for a few hours before bbq'ing. Instead of croutons, I buttered and Italian seasoned some fresh, white Vienna bread and fried it, making a lovely chicken Caesar salad sandwich with extra dressing, red onions and bacon.  Definitely one of the most flavourful meals I've ever had, and that's saying something.

Really enjoyed the recipe and it was easy to make, I had never coddled an egg before but it was very easy! If you use anchovy- I used the paste- I would omit the salt-but other than that it was great. A note to a previous review : Because coddled eggs are not boiled, some people may be concerned of the risk of salmonella and other bacteria. According to the US Dept of Health, cooking at temperature of 72°C/160°F or more is sufficient to kill salmonella, but children, the elderly and persons with compromised immune systems are advised against eating lightly-cooked eggs because of possible under-cooking-found that on 2 websites :)

I thought this was good.  I loved the strong flavors.  Although I prefer a creamier caesar salad, so I'll probably hunt for a new recipe.  The croutons were okay, but I prefer making them on the stovetop with oil, salt, and garlic.  Also, for my kids and mom who don't like strong flavors, I added a healthy amount of mayo and parm cheese.

Awesome recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using grated parm. instead of parm. reg. and dijon mustard instead of mustard powder.  The dressing was not too heavy, just right, and the croutons were TDF!

Fabulous!  I had to make 2 changes: I used Olive Oil (and therefore cut back the amount by 1 tbsp) as I had no Safflower oil on hand, and I used 1oz of Anchovy Paste instead of filets...I just can't handle those little suckers!  After mixing in the coddled egg, I took my immersion blender to the mix and it came out nice and creamy.  Then I took it to the next level and cut up some warmed up leftover grilled chicken and tossed it with the salad...Too yummy for words! This tasted just like the Ceasar Salad I get from my favourite authentic Italian Restaurant!  Thanks Jeff!!

I don't like giving bad reviews, but this is terrible...  Made it last night and we choked it down, but it's bitter and salty.  Gonna try to fix what's left, because I love anchovies, but I will probably end up throwing it out.  Yes, I followed the recipe, and yes, I have had Caesar salad in some really great restaurants.

This was really good. It was time consuming, but the results were very tasty. I will say that the anchovy taste was a bit overpowering. The croutons were the best part! I could eat those all day =). Good salad!

Fantastic.  I made this for my boyfriend for a special occasion, and now it is requested on a regular basis.  The only change I made was using only 3/4 or so of the anchovies, and it was plenty strong.  This is one of the easiest salad dressing recipes I use, and definately my favorite.

Oh ... My ... God ... this was delicious.  I've never made a caesar salad dressing (or any dressing) from scratch before, but the ingredients for this recipe looked pretty accurate in terms of resembling the great Caesar salads I've had in restaurants.  I used 4 tbsp instead of 6 tbsp of oil (I was hoping to make it slightly lower in calories) and omitted the anchovies (GF is a vegetarian, so I left them out but sprinkled some chopped anchovies on my salad instead because I love them!).  Other than that, I followed the recipe (though I'm not sure I coddled the egg properly!!)  The dressing was super-easy to make.  Putting it in a jar and shaking it makes it so much easier than a lot of other recipes (which involve whisking or blenderizing).  It instantly took on the perfect texture after shaking it for a few moments!  Very thick and decadent!  We actually only ended up using half the dressing and refrigerated the rest, and I just looked in the refrigerator and saw that it still maintained its thick texture hours later-- it hasn't separated at all!  I really loved the salad and will definitely make it (or maybe just the dressing) over and over.  If I make it again, I might use a bit more garlic and mash it up like other posters have suggested for even more garlic flavor.  I think it might also be good to use pasturized egg protein for safety (plus the coddling is kind of a pain).  Excellent recipe!

This recipe was very good, although you may want to use less lemon than suggested, or taste as you go since mine came out a little too lemony.  I also added very very finely fresh grated parmesan cheese to the dressing and used and electric mixer to blend it in; this added a little extra flavor and thickened it a bit, for those who like thicker dressings.  Overall it was a pretty good recipe and definitely one I will use again.

Yum! This was a very good Caesar salad. I don't like Caesar dressings containing mayonnaise, it adds a strange flavor. This is how Caesar dressing is supposed to taste! Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent. We're not big anchovy lovers, but it's essential to the recipe, so we cut it in half. Also, like many dressings it is best used sparingly since it is so flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.

Didn’t add salt and I like a tangy Caesar, so I used 5T lemon juice and 3T oil, used 1.5t dry mustard in lieu of .5t.

I’ve been making this salad for over 40 years with a similar recipe my mom got out of a newspaper in Hawaii.  One of my favorite recipes!  My home made croutons are the best, so didn’t use the recipe on this site.

Best Caesar salad ive ever had/made ... note:   don't let the idea of  cayenne pepper scare you ....    i don' t like anything spicy ...  this does not add any spice at this amount ... just some kind of zesty kick ...   luv it !

Loved it.  My whole family thought it was as good as any CAESAR salad they had eaten.  Updated with using 2 Tabl. To replace the eggs.  Also used Dijon mustard.  I also doubled the recipe for 8 people.

This should be called PERFECT Caesar salad!  This was absolutely spectacular, the only change was to use anchovy paste instead of anchovies (had on hand).  It's not something you're going to have everyday, so don't worry about the calories & fat.........just enjoy!

Finally!  This is the recipe you have been looking for.  The dressing is right on target and being able to just shake it in a jar makes it easier.  I have also made it with anchovy paste and used raw egg for shortcut and it is great.  Thanks so much.

With all of the good reviews, I was very excited to try this recipe.  However, I was disappointed.  It was VERY salty tasting.  I followed the recipe exactly, even the croutons, with the only change being that I used anchovy paste, and I mean only a drop of it for flavor.  I won't be making this again.  :(

Awesome dressing!!  I omitted the anchovies as I didn't have any, and used fresh mayo instead of an egg - turned out fabulous!  Thank you Chef Jeff!

Excellent!  I've had Caesar's at some of the finest restaurants (Ruth Chris, Del Frisco's etc...) and this rates right up there with them.  I added grilled chicken and it was a nice meal.  The amount of lemon juice in this recipe is perfect and adds a nice tartness.  I used store bought crutons and it worked this time, but I will be making them next time.  Thanks -this will be a keeper.

Best Caesar Salad I've ever made. Only change I made was to saute anchovies and garlic for 2 minutes before adding to dressing.

I used this as I could not find my own dressing recipe (it had been a while since I used it).  No need to find my recipe!  Yum was the word from my husband and friends. Made a great addition to our new years eve meal. I had to skip the anchovies for our friends, but will make it again and go for it. Thanks for sharing - you really helped me out when I was in a pinch!

I'm a big caesar dressing fan, and some how this didn't work out too well for me.  Yes, i was a little squeamish about the anchovies, but still, to me it didn't taste right.  i did use a little less cayenne, because i was also making this for my toddler who loves salad, but other than that i followed it to a T and to me, it didn't even taste like caeser dressing.  I even mixed it with a small bowl of lettuce and still, "ick"!!  off to find another recipe.
