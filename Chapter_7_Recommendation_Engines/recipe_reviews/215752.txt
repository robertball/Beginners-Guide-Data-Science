Delish!  I LOVE portobello mushrooms so this was right up my alley.  I used baby portobellos vs. slicing a mushroom cap and sauteed them with a bit of minced garlic.  I also subbed egg beaters for the egg whites and left out the water. I upped the pesta just a bit and added some shredded romano cheese along with the low-fat mozzarella.  This was so good, especially when paired with some whole grain toast.

Just what I needed this morning for breakfast. I was looking through the new recipes and I found this gem! I used about a 1/2 cup of chopped baby bella mushrooms because I didn't have one large cap. I did increase the pesto to one tablespoon but that's only because I really like pesto. I did also add 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flake. Super flavorful and filling without adding a ton of fat. Thanks, Alisan. NOTE: I used Classico brand pesto.

Delicious. We grilled the large portobellos in a grill pan rather than sauteing in oil. That worked really well. We used whole eggs rather than white, and left out the onion. We were very happy.

This was a great omelet.  I used more pesto than the recipe called for!

This was very tasty, but next time I'm going to make it like a scramble instead of an omelette. I just enjoy that more. I'm sure as a scramble I would have given it 5 stars.

I loved this! I used havarti cheese instead and also lacked mushrooms, so I put in about 1/4 cup of chopped red bell peppers with the onions. I love that it's healthy and tasty and could be appropriate for breakfast or dinner and I could see this going into a breakfast burrito or taco even. Well done!

Great meal. I used whole eggs and feta cheese will make again. Great meal with a salad and crusty bread

filling. definitely needed to cook a little longer than prescribed. I am not fan of runny eggs. Good without the pesto sauce, too! And nothing is ever bad with a little bit of sriracha!

This really hit the spot. The flavors worked really well together, and it was a snap to put together. I opted for swiss instead of mozzarella, but it was still delicious!
