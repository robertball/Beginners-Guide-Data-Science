I used apple pie spice instead of cinnamon--I made no other changes. Not a bad apple butter, I liked the flavor that the maple syrup gave to the apple butter, I just think it could be a little better. I'd make this again but I'd play with the recipe a bit.

Didn't need to heat it quite as much as it said. Very basic recipe. Will definitely make again, will variate.

I had high hopes this recipe would work because it was so simple, but it was just a mess!  Didn't turn out, had to throw away.

Good, quick, easy, and tasty recipe.  I don't really have the time to sit there and slow cook for 12 hours so this recipe worked great.  However, I did not use the microwave.  Just boiled the ingredients for 30 mins, threw it in the blender, than boiled for another 30 mins.  I call it apple jutter, because its more like jelly than butter.

This worked great in a pinch thank you! I was making a muffin recipe and I needed 1/4 cup of apple butter. I didn't want to run out to the store or spend $6 dollars on a jar, for such a small amount. I did a search and found this recipe. I wish I could say I followed this recipe exactly, but saw other reviewers had trouble that did. I only needed 1/4 cup, so I changed the serving size to 2. I didn't feel like spending 15 minutes at the microwave so I just started with applesauce. I used Motts Healthy Harvest granny smith apples applesauce. It took almost 1 of the serving sized cups, that can be purchased at the grocery store in the packs. I mixed the maple syrup in after measuring out the apple sauce. Then, when I went to add the cinnamon, I thought apple pie spice just seemed closer to what I know would be in apple butter. I even accidentally doubled the amount and it worked fine. I would even suggest that. I heated it in a small glass bowl, covered with plastic wrap, and I started out with 1 1/2 minutes on high in a small microwave and it seemed thick enough to me. I let it cool and used it in the muffin recipe. Saved me time and money today.

This was awesome!!  Perfect consistency and great taste!  I didn't use the microwave, though.  I put everything in a pot, cooked it for 30 minutes, transferred it to the blender and blended and finally put it back in the pot and let it simmer for about 5 more minutes.  It came out beautifully!  Goes great with Popeye's biscuits!

Had really high hopes for this recipe as we love apple butter.  Unfortunately the maple taste combined with the cinnamon threw off the taste buds--it didn't do anything for us.
