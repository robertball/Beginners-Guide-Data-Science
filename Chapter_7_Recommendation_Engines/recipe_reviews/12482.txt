CHILL THE CRUST BEFORE ADDING THE FIRST LAYER.AFTER YOU HAVE ADDED THE FIRST LAYER, CHILL AGAIN BEFORE ADDING THE SECOND. THIS HELPS THE PIE TO SET AND WILL HELP AVOID MIXING OF THE LAYERS AS MENTIONED IN OTHER REVIEWS.

{12/2007:An update to my review: I have simplified this for me (and hopefully you!) I use half and half for the 1T and 1 Cup (instead of milk) AND, here's the kicker ...instead of having the three spices (cinnamon, ginger and cloves on hand) and the solid pumpkin...I use instead PUMPKIN PIE MIX and am done faster to boot! I was out of the size of pudding this recipe calls for and only had the larger vanilla pudding size (I think it's the six cup version...I used the whole version of that, and it turned out fabulous!!! This pie is so rich and creamy.  YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!}   I had this recipe before (from another source) and it got lost, so glad it was here to be found!  This recipe is so user friendly...a no-bake pie..what could be easier! The flavors are so rich and distinct. Cheesecake meets pumpkin and they hit it off wonderfully.  IF you like the layers to be very defined, I recommend putting the cream cheese layered part in the refridge right away and while you mix the pumpkin/top layer.  This pie has even won over some in our family that weren't pumpkin pie fans to begin with!  Yep, it's that yummy!  Enjoy and Happy Thanksgiving to YOU! :)

This is a great recipe - a much lighter version of a pumpkin pie.

The instructions may be a tad confusing. The instructions for the 1st layer just say to mix the cream cheese with the milk, but they should specify to mix with the 1 tbl milk.  When the pumpkin layer is mixed with the pudding mix, then the full cup of milk is added.   Perhaps this is why some people had trouble with this layer being runny??

Overall a great recipe.  I've found the following tweaks help it to set-up more firmly, more quickly.  This solved any runniness for me.
1. To the cream cheese/whipped topping add 1 TBS chilled evaporated milk.
2. With the pudding/pumpkin, use 1 cup CHILLED evaporated milk in place of plain milk.
3. After pouring the cream cheese/whipped topping mixture into the crust, put in freezer while you make the pumpkin topping.
4. Thaw the whipped topping before using by putting in refrig overnight.  This helps keep it firm without it being runny as can happen when thawing in a microwave.

this is my all time favorite. My husband hates pumpkin pie, but will only eat this pie I make for him. I've been making this pie for any occasion for the past 2 years and it never gets old. I do use a little more cream cheese to help thicken the bottom. I also put it on the bottom of the crust than store it in the freezer for about 10 mins. I don't use a cup of milk for the pumpkin layer. I only use about 3/4 of a cup because I find that it makes it runny. I do use a mixer to blend it till it is thicker, than I place the mixture in the fridge for about 10 mins. Than place the pumpkin on the top. The longer you chill it the better it is in holding its form.

Very good! This is also a going to be a permanent fixture at the holidays! The cream cheese layer was light and fluffy, and the pumpkin was delish. If you're in a hurry, I reccomend popping it in the freezer after you've put the cream cheese in the pie crust so it hardens and it's easier to put the pumpkin on.

I have come across this recipe many times and decided to give it a try.  I love pumpkin pie the old fashioned way and was dissapointed when my "double layer" attempt backfired on me.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my bottom layer never set...so they both just kind of smushed together.  I definitely don't discourage anyone from trying this...quite the contrary...this recipe has received many good reviews!!  I'm sure I messed up somewhere along the way, but good luck to the rest of you.

I really love this and have lots of requests for it. The only thing I do different is substitute half and half for the milk. It really makes a difference.

Very good! I didn't use a crust at all because my husband, son and my mother are all diabetic. I just prepared the first layer as directed using low fat ingredients and spread it in a dish. For the second layer, I used 1% milk and sugar free butterscotch pudding. Everyone loved it!

I have made this several times after coming across this recipe years ago! It's great! Chilling the crust and layers, as suggested, does work a lot better as other reviewers mentioned.

I got this same recipe from my mother in law a few years ago.  This is my kids' favorite pie.   This recipe is exactly the same as the one from my mother in law except for one step.  Instead of mixing the milk, pudding, pumpkin and spices together all at once my version calls for mixing the milk and pudding together first.  Beat with wire wisk for 2 minutes.  Then let it stand for 3 minutes.  Now add the pumkin and spices, mixing well.  I've never had a problem with my pie being runny as some other reviewers complained about.  Changing this step may solve that problem.

I give this a 4 as written, but I give my version a 5.  have made it the regular way, using 3/4 c. of milk and it's perfect.  I use a large graham cracker crust and sprinkle finely cut, toasted pecans over the crust.    For the spices I use cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg - no ginger.  I also add in about 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract to the pumpkin mixture.  Now.... I have also made this almost sugar free.  I use a graham cracker crust, sprinkle finely cut, toasted pecans over the crust.  I use SF pudding, SF whipped topping, and 4 pkgs. of sweetner in place of the sugar.  Excellent!

Ok LOVE this pie. The modifications are 8oz of cream cheese and 2 Tb sugar with no milk (along w the whipped topping). Freeze it after first layer for about 10 min. Put 3/4 cup cold evaporated milk. and 1 and 2/3 packages of vanilla pudding mix. Then mix it together until smooth. Then put 3/4 of the 15 oz can of pumpkin in it(not cup the can). Put 1/4-1/2 t pumpkin pie spice. and 1/4-1/2 t cinnamon. Do this and your pie will be perfect. Not runny or too sweet, not too much filling and will taste pretty much like pumpkin pie. For the rest of the pudding mix and canned pumpkin you probably could make a mouse out of it but haven't tried it. Just saying.

For an even spicier festive flavor, try using the seasonal pumpkin spice pudding mix (and add a tsp of vanilla extract) instead of vanilla pudding flavor.

Oh my goodness this pie is FANTASTIC!!  I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie, but this is incredible. My husband said that it is the best pumpkin pie he has ever had and It didn't last too long in this house.  It is way past Thanksgiving and I STILL crave it.  Luckily, I still have a can of pumpkin in the cupboard and may have to make it for Christmas.  Thank you so much for this excellent recipe that I will definitely use over and over again.

GET 2 PIE CRUSTS! NOT ONE! I have one HEAPING pie in my fridge right now and figured I'd let others know who might be making this for Thanksgiving that it will mix up enough for TWO normal 9 inch pies. If you are concerned, get 2 8 inch pies. I piled in as much as I could and still had like 2 or 3 scoops of each mix and the pie is like 2 1/2 inches above the crust! Lol! Tasted AWESOME from the tastes everyone snuck!

It is so easy to make and taste great! I chilled each layer separately and use 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, a whole tub of whipped topping, 2 large pudding mix boxes and the large can of libby's pumpkin pie mix, saves money and already comes with the spices. It makes enough for 2 pies, one for our extended family's thankgiving gathering and kept one for my family. Everyone loves this pie!

My 17 year old son told me I was a pie making magician when he tasted this!  Make sure you read some of the other modifications from other reviewers... I used 1 tbsp of chilled evaporated milk in addition to the 1 tbsp of half and half (instead of the called for milk) in the bottom layer to make it more solid.  I also substituted half and half for the called for regular milk in the top pumpkin layer.  Next time I'll probably use a little evaporated milk in the top layer, too, to make it a bit more dense.  I also made my own graham cracker crust - which I think is much tastier than the store bought. This pie will be a new favorite at holiday dinners... we loved it!!

I read all the reviews and there were alot of mixed reviews.  I did all the things people said to do, to make the pie better.  I froze the pie in between layers, used less milk, and after 8 hours in the fridge, the pumkin layer was still runny!! I don't know how you keep it from this, but I will not be using this recipe again.

I give this recipe two stars because of taste which was ok, however the pumpkin mixture was kind of lumpy and it definitely needs to be refrigerated for at least 48 hours in order to serve a slice of pie otherwise you end up with a pile of pie.

I am not aloud to enter my family's house on Thanksgiving without 2 of these in tow!LOL! I do however use "French Vanilla" instant Pudding in place of plain vanilla & I also add a bit of "nutmeg" along with the other spices...both add a little bit extra flavoring to this easy to make & already delicious recipe!! YUM!! :o)

Great pumpkin pie recipe. I used one package or vanilla pudding and one package of pumpkin pudding thats always in the stores this time of year. I think I will try reducing the milk to 3/4 cup so it sets firmer. I also took the 4 oz of cream cheese and beat it together with 1/2 C confect sugar then in another bowl I beat 1/2 cup heavy cream to  a whipped cream consistency. Then folded that into the cream cheese mixture . spread it into the pie shell and chilled it first before adding the pumpkin filling mixture.

I made pumpkin pies for a dinner and a had a little bit of pie mixture left over.  So I made a regular baked pumpkin pie that was lacking in fullness and when it was cooled I topped it with the cream cheese mixture.  It was delicious and loved by everyone in the family.

This recipe is fool-proof and so easy!!! I made a pie yesterday just to make sure we would like it before I made it for Thanksgiving. It was great!!!! Nobody could fail at this recipe.  I did use 1 and a half teaspoon of pumkin pie spice instead of having to buy individual spices.  I also added a little whip cream (about 2 tablespoons) to the pumpkin pie mixture.  I did take the advice of chilling the cream cheese mixture before adding the pumkin pie mixture.  Awsome!!!!!!!!

This was excellent!  Light and fluffy.  It was hard to let it sit overnight in order to eat it.  Just make sure you let the center cook long enough or it gets a little liquidy.  Great mousse-like cheesecake!

I'm another one who made this a few years ago, and lost the recipe.  Everyone loved it and always asks me when I'll make it again, so I decided to search the internet to see if I could find it.  (Found within two minutes.....ya gotta love the internet!)  I'll be making this for thanksgiving this year.....I love making things that don't actually need to be "made"!

I made this last November for Thanksgiving, and it was really, really good.  I think I accidentally added either too much whipped topping or too much cream cheese, but it still turned out really good.  I will definitely be making this again next year.  Besides that mistake, the only thing I did differently was making my own graham cracker crust because it's so easy (you just melt some butter, mix it with graham cracker crumbs, and bake for a few minutes), and I find that most of the premade crusts taste like cardboard.

My family, who "does not like pumpkin pie", LOVES this recipe.  I just made a couple of changes...I used a full 8oz bar of 1/3 fat cream cheese.  I added about a tsp of Vanilla and a little extra sugar to the cream cheese/cool whip mixture.  I used all spice and ginger for the spices in the pumpkin mixture.  Additionally, I added 2 "globs" of cool whip to the pumpkin mixture.  It makes it alot fluffier and a little sweeter.

Kids said this was the best pumpkin pie ever. Must be the combination of the pumpkin and cream cheese layer.  I went through two pies in the blink of an eye.

This is my family's favorite pumpkin pie recipe!  I have made it for 10 years. My 2 teenage boys ask for it every holiday season. I can not bake anything, but this pie is so easy to make.  It is a twist on the traditional baked pie.  I only use 1/2 cup of milk on the pumpkin/pudding layer. I use allspice instead of the suggested spices (just add to your liking).  Like other reviewers, I also recomend mixing the milk with the pudding first and then add in the pumpkin.  I like the pie served cold out of the refridgerator.

This was soo good. Everyone loved it. I bought 2 pie crust since other reviewers said it makes enough for 2. I disagree. I think it makes enough for one stacked pie. I also put the pumpkin layer on the bottom then the cool whip mixture. I also used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. Will def. make again and again. Very easy considering there is no baking involved.

Loved this pie!  There are a couple changes that I would make.  First You need to specify that the 1tbsp is for the cream cheese mixture.  Its obvious to some but after reading other reviews maybe not.  Also I believe the amount is off on the cream cheese.  8oz worked much better mixed with 2tbsp sugar and 2tbsp milk.  Also Mix in about 1/2 of the pumpkin mixture into the cream cheese to give it a pumpkin flavor instead of just a sweetend cream cheese flavor. Tasted much better this way.

This was great!  For the pudding, I used one instant vanilla and one instant pumpkin pie pudding packets.  This way, I didn't have to add extra cinammon, cloves, etc.  It was perfect!  And I did chill each layer before the next one.  Thanks for sharing!

The recipe seems to make a lot of extra pie filling, but otherwise the recipe is fantastic!  My whole family loved it.  We changed a lot of the ingredients to low fat or low sugar for my mom who does Weight Watchers, and it still turned out great!

Wonderful taste!  A nice change from the standard pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving.  Save a little of the whipped topping to spread on top and then sprinkle with sliced almonds.

I would like to note that this was created long ago in some test kitchen.  I have been making this pie since I was 10 years old (1990).  My mom and I found the recipe in a Family Circle.  It is a hit though and everyone loves it.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It was really, really sweet. I expected it to taste more like a traditional pumpkin pie, but it was more like a very sweet pumpkin and whipped cream pudding.   I did refridgerate the bottom layer before adding the top layer and the layers stayed perfectly separated.

My mother has been making this for years and handed the recipe off to me. After years of making "runny" pies I have finally perfected it. The secret to making it not runny is to use regular cream cheese and whipped cream. Using fat free or reduced makes the pies runny....probably because of the less fat. So my word of advice is use the regular stuff and skip the reduced/non-fat items. Using the regular items I no longer have to chill the 1st layer. Good luck to all!!!

extremely easy and fast to make and was delicious,a major hit at Thanksgiving this year. Anorher plus, you can make it the night before, anything that can be done ahead of time is always a plus. I barely got a piece of it! I sprinkled a little pumpkin pie spice in batter also. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

This recipe was very easy to make and the pie looks very pretty, but I guess I can't get used to the idea of a no-bake pumpkin pie.  The cloves were way too strong for the pumpkin layer, and the pumpkin layer also just tasted way too 'raw' for me (although I did like the bottom cream cheese layer).

I had printed out this recipe & my husband found this exact recipe in a cooking magazine I had and asked me to make it. The pumpkin topping was a bit runny. This pie got lost in all of the pies we made and wasn't the best. Thanks for letting me try something different for our holiday table.

This pie was AMAZING! Thanks for listing this recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving. I wanted to make something a little different insteading of the plain ol' traditional pumpkin pie. This turned out great. I should have made two pies instead of one, it went that fast!

Excellent!  Very tasty, not too filling!  The only change I made was I used a NILLA pie crust because we are not big graham cracker crust fans - and we personally thought it was absolutely fantastic!

I made a recipe like this Many years ago, but the layers were the opposite; with the pumpkin on the bottom, you probably would not find it so hard to set. Also, your topping is already there.

I make these occasionally, and everyone loves them.  I learned by making these pies that the solid pack pumpkin tastes much better than pumpkin pie mix, because you add your own spices and it has a better flavor.  This recipe is great for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Last year I prepared this recipe using pumpkin pie spice and either sugar-free or low/no fat ingredients when possible.  My friends loved the "bars."  I prepared in bar form to make serving easier for a large group and froze the leftovers. As I am the only pumpkin fan in my family, I had a little my own pie for a month!

My sister-in-law hates pumpkin pies, but she loves this recipe! I like it because there's nothing to bake, which is good because I'm not much of a cook to begin with. I would recommend this to anyone.

This is now going to be my holiday tradition.  Such a great way to have the pumpkin taste but much less rich and heavy than a pastry crust and pumpkin custard.  Love it!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it.  No one could believe it was a "no bake" recipe.  I shopped at the last minute, and the store was out of instant vanilla pudding mix.  I used what my sister had at home, 1 box of regular instant and 1 box of suger free instant - 2 different brands.  One box was a little small, so I didn't have enough according to the recipe, but I made it anyway.  I compensated by adding a little more suger and cream cheese.  They were counting on pumpkin pie, and they were not disappointed. It still turned out great, so I think it's hard to mess this one up.  I didn't notice any aftertaste from the pudding mix like other reviews noted.  Next time I'm going to experiment with a regular pie crust.  The graham crackers with the pumpkin was the only thing I wasn't too crazy about, but I STILL had 2 pieces!!  A++

This was really good and really easy.  I used the "cook and serve" pudding instead of the instant because instant pudding has a funny aftertaste.  it took a little longer, but it worked fine.  you could just make the pudding ahead of time so it's cool by the time you want to assemble the pie.  i also put the cream cheese layer on top instead of on the bottom.  i dunno, it just seemed more logical that way.

Not a bad recipe to try as a change up from the traditional baked pumpkin pie I usually eat during the holidays.  Since I usually drown my traditional pumpkin pie with whipped cream, this recipe hits the mark for me.   I like the fact that it is not baked.  Easy to make too.

When I made this I ended up going to an oversized regular pie crust. I also put a layer of almond paste between (for a triple layer pie) and a pretty design of slivered almonds on top.

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit based on other reviewers comments.  I used 8 oz cream cheese,2 tbsp sugar, the topping as listed, and no milk.  Chilled the store bought crust, then put the first layer in then put the pie in the freezer while fixing the second layer.  The second layer I started with half of the pumpkin and half and half - not milk, then played to get a good texture.... ended up with 3/4 can pumpkin, the 2 packages of vanilla pudding, 1 tsp vanilla, a 1/2 to 2/3 cup of half and half, 2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2-3/4 tsp nutmeg, plus a couple of globs of whipped cream topping.  This made a nice spreadable but thick layer with a spicy pumpkin taste.  Brought it to the office, told folks it was in the fridge, and I have been stopped repeatedly with compliments.  I have been told I have to make it again for Christmas... :)  Not really cheesecake, not pudding, I called it pumpkin cream pie.

so creamy and not too sweet. I used fresh pumpkin that I had roasted the day before. The small pumpkin yielded enough to make 3 pies. I'll be making this one again.

Have been using this recipe for many, many years!   Agree that once the cream cheese and whipping cream base is mixed that you refrigerate it for at least an hour prior to adding the pumpkin layer.  Also will add -- 3.25% homogenized milk  and 1 3/4 cups of pumpkin filling works well in this recipe which will give you more than enough  if using a pre-made 9" graham cracker pie shell.  As you will have excess filling left over use it to  make at least ten to twelve small pastry tarts.  
Tarts:  Bake first and let cool.  As you will need extra cream cheese filling; cut ingredients in half and prepare the same way as you did for the pie.    Line baked tarts with the mixture and refrigerate.  Add excess pumpkin layer on top.  Refrigerate as well until use.

This recipe is perfect the way it is. Just make sure you chill the crust and then chill each layer. My younger cousin has requested me to make this as her birthday cake as she loved it so much. HUGE hit with everyone.

I made this for my son who is allergic to eggs and nuts. The whole family raved about it. Even better than the apple pie for Thanksgiving dessert! I made it two weekends later, and it received the same reviews. Very creamy and tasty.

I made this pie for dessert on Thanksgiving. It turned out really well and tasted good. Everyone who had a slice thought it was good. Very easy to make. I did take the advice of the other reviewer and put it in the freezer to firm up the bottom layer.

I made this for our family Thanksgiving.  I decided that instead of a traditional graham cracker crust I was going to use Snickerdoodles in a blender and add some additional spices.  Everyone RAVED about the pie.  SO simple I will definitely make it again!  Thank you!

I make this pie every Thanksgiving and everyone loves it. I've never had to chill each layer separately for it to turn out delicious. The only thing I change is the cloves. I use nutmeg instead. Be sure to use a 9oz crust because the pie is thick and you get more slices.

This is an amazing recipe! I am 14 years old and love cooking. This is easy for younger children to make and help make. My entire family enjoys this each thanksgiving and my aunts wishes I'd make it on Christmas too. It very simple to memorize, and fun.

I made this for my family last night and it got rave reviews.  It is so easy to make, and everyone thought I slaved over the stove.  I will make this again and again, it was just delicious.   I did chill before each layer, and had no problems with the layers staying separate. It looked as good as it tasted!

Tried this before putting in the company newletter, easy and wonderful! After reading the reviews I used evaporated milk and  I put the pie with just the cream cheese in the fridge to chill and left the pumpkin filling in a bowl to chill for an hour before I put it on. I had no problem with the layers mixing, and it was set up and ready to eat in 2 1/2 hours.

Good, easy no-bake pumpkin pie.  Next time, I would recommend putting the pumpkin on the BOTTOM and the cream layer on the top, as this would be much easier to keep the layers from mixing.  Pumpkin layer is thick, so it's tough to spread on top, even if you chill the crust and cream layer first, as I did.  For those that thought the cloves were too strong, maybe substituting pumpkin pie seasoning for the other seasonings would suit you better?    I still liked this recipe!

I really liked the bottom layer but thought the top had too many spices. Next time I think I will just double the bottom and add a cherry topping.

I was really excited about this recipe because it LOOKS so good. I followed the recipe exactly and it was the least touched pie on the table.  The bottom cream cheese filling is good, but the pumpkin part wasn't.  Maybe if you used a more traditional pumpkin pie filling it would be better.

I found this to be a nice change from the traditional pumpkin pie. However, I felt that the flavor of the cloves was almost too strong in the pumpkin layer and will omit this ingredient next time. I just don't think that the flavor of cloves is for everyone.

This recipe is always a hit - a perfect substitute for traditional pumpkin pie.  I can't give it 5 stars, though, because the pumpkin layer tends to be runny and slides off of the cream cheese layer once the pie has been cut.

The taste was wonderful! My husband likes pumpkin pie, but he likes this even better. After trying it he asked me "You DO still have this recipe saved somewhere don't you?". 

I just put the bottom layer in the fridge while i made the top layer and then top it back out to put the top layer on. The bottom layer turned out fine, there was no bleeding of flavors. The bottom layer, however was more like a pudding and would not hold form. 

Thanks for posting the recipe! I will reduce the milk slightly and make it for Christmas!

This was absolutely delicious!  And so easy to make.  I love that the cream cheese layer mellows the pumpkin taste.  I followed one reviewer's tip of chilling in between layers.  For the pumpkin layer, I placed all the pumpkin mixture in the center of the cream cheese and spread out toward the edges.  Much easier this way.  Will definitely make again, maybe next time will try to make my own crust.  Thank you for this recipe.

I'm not a pumpkin pie fan, but I found myself doing some double-tasting as I was making it! 1 thing: I added vanilla to the bottom layer and I really liked that! There was a bit too much pumpkin and I used 2oz. less of the pudding, so I am going to just use less of the pumpkin next time. also, I didn't use cloves b/c they are really expensive to buy for just one pie! I will def make this again :)

I just made this and let me tell you I couldn't even put it together because I kept nibbling at it. Well it now together and setting in the fridge, but just from the filling alone I can tell this is going to be amazing!! If you love cheesecake and pumpkin pie this is a great combo!! Excellent recipe so far I will have to let you know about the finalized product.

My husband is a huge fan of pumpkin pie, but he thought this was just okay.  I did use pumpkin pie spice and the cloves, and I think this is what made it just okay for us. The ombo of the cloves and the allspice in the PPS made it a little overpowering.  I may try this again, but I would not use the PPS.  Also, I think the cream cheese layer needed a little more sweetness to it.. maybe some vanilla?

Very good. The two layers balance each other out very well to make a tasty combination.

Very yummy!  But my advice is to ALSO make or buy a traditional pumpkin pie if you're making this for a holiday meal.  I liked this a lot, but several of us really missed that standard pumpkin pie, and this is different.

I made according to the directions and it just never quite became as firm asa I would have liked.  Also, not the prettiest pie in town, but good enough in the taste department.

I read step 3 of the directions wrong it said to refrigerate 4 hours, or until set.  For some reason I put the pie in the freezer for 4 hours.  None the less, the pie was great!  My husband doesn't even like pumpkin pie and he has eaten three slices already.  The pie was cold, thick, creamy, rich, and plain delightful.  I will make this Pumpkin Pie again and again.  I think I will eat a slice right now!  Thank you for sharing.

This was good.  I used "cook and serve" because that's what I had.  And added a cup of half & half, because one cup of milk just didn't seem right.  I then added the pumpkin (fresh puree) to it after the pudding cooked, cooked it another 2 minutes.  I assembled it while the pumpkin was still warm and it set up totally fine.  I still like pumpkin pie better, but this was good too.

I have been making this pumpkin pie recipe for about 8 years, ever since finding it on the lid of a cool whip container.

As someone else noted, the bottom layer only uses 1tbs. of milk.  The remaining milk is the pumpkinpudding layer.

I lost the recipe this year and found it again on this site.

I usually never bake, but I made two of these pies for thanksgiving for two groups of people. Everyone loved it - even my sister who normally doesn't like pumpkin pie.
I only used 3/4 cups of milk, and 80% of the suggested amount of cream cheese and whipped cream (low fat for both kinds)and pumpkin puree. It was just the right amount to fill the pie crust and the sweetness was just right. Refrigerate the first layer for atleast 1 hour before putting the second layer over it.

This was excellant - I brought one to work and people loved it...tastes like a traditional pumpkin pie but with a nice suprise from the cream cheese and whipped topping as the base layer. Will definately make this again.

Unique...no bake pumpkin seemed a bit strange to me, but it was quite good. I accidentally used double the amount of cream cheese, so I topped the whole pie with extra cool whip and it still tastes good.

I actually came across this recipe years ago.  My husband and I aren't fans of regular pumpkin pie and so this was a great find.  Every time I make it, people go crazy for it.  The only change I make is to add a smidge more spices than the recipe calls for.  Note: The filling is enough to actually to fill a Keebler Extra Serving pie crust.   Also, the pumpkin cream layer can be made a day in advance in order to allow the flavors some time to meld.

I have been making this at Thanksgiving for over 10 years now.  Everyone looks forward to it, wouldn't be Thanksgiving without it.  It's embarrassingly easy to make, no baking which is a plus around the holidays.  I make it exactly as the recipe says.

Very good pie - the family really liked it. Light, fluffy texture.  I used a gingersnap crust which is good with pumpkin.  The second time I made it I used cream instead of milk in the pumpkin layer and that made it a little denser than I like so I won't be doing that again.  I'll stick withe the original recipe.

I made this recipe and the flavor is fabulous.  I changed only one thing- I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  So if you plan on doing the same, there's one thing you need to know.  Fresh pumpkin has much more liquid in it than canned.  Which will make the second layer of this pie not firm up.  You'll have pumpkin soup instead of pie.  So it's easy enough to buy a couple slightly larger boxes of instant pudding.  Opt for the 5 ounce size instead of the 3 ounce one.

next time I may add a little more cream cheese, a little less whipped topping, and a little more stevia for my preference of sweetness and consistency.  Everyone liked it,  no left overs.

I have no idea how all this is supposed to fit in a 9 inch pie crust. The first time I made it, I followed the instructions and ended up with a bunch of leftover filling. This time I did not add 1 1/2 cups of whipped topping to the cream cheese mixture. Instead I only mixed the cream cheese, sugar, and milk together, placed it in the crust, and spread a thin layer of whipped topping over that. I put that in the freezer for a few hours, then mixed the pumpkin with the remaining ingredients and spread it over all. I refrigerated that until time to eat, and then added the whipped topping on the individual slices.  It worked much better this way.

It turned out really good! I tweaked the recipe a bit: I used 8 oz of cream cheese, fresh ginger instead of powdered, and refrigerated between the cream cheese filling and the pumkin filling. People loved it. Some of my friends who typically don't like pumpkin pie, loved this one! I am so happy with this recipe, and will be using it again every year!

I have made this pie for 15+ years.  I don't even remember where I found the recipe.  I found that taking the time to make my own whipped cream, instead of using Cool Whip or other prepared cream, makes it the best.  I've never had a problem with the layers mixing - the worst that happens is that sometimes the milk is TOO cold and it makes it hard to whisk the lumps out of the pudding.  Also don't cut corners on softening the cream cheese, and whipped cream cheese won't work.

I have made this pie for  over 20 years because my family doesn't believe the holidays would be able to go on without it.  It is simple and delicious.  Perfect for the person who doesn't normally like pumpkin pie.  I have never had anyone dislike this pie.

I was looking for something more exciting than plain old heavy, dense pumpkin pie. This was perfect, and so easy! I sprinkled  some chopped pecans with cinnamon & sugar and toasted them in the oven for 15 min at 325,  then sprinkled some on top of crust before adding cream cheese layer. Then I chilled that for 30 min before adding pumpkin layer, and sprinkled more pecans on top. Refrigerated overnight and it was totally awesome!!

To make this 5 stars and the layers not blend together, I got one small box of the vanilla cook and serve pudding and made as directed and then mixed in my canned pumpkin with 2 Tbsp of powdered sugar and the called for spices and set aside. For the whipped cream and cheese layer, I omitted the milk and added 1-2 tbsp powder sugar to it. Then layer and chill. You don't have to chill it as long this way either. Loved it!

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  The best comment was "I normally don't really like pumpkin pie, but I love this pie!" What makes this recipe different is how light and creamy it is.  I also substituted ginger snaps for the crust.

I've made this pie for about the past 10 years. My family likes it and it's an easy alternative to traditional pumpkin pie. The best tip I have is to use the larger graham cracker crust (Keebler 2 Extra Servings) because the amount of filling spills over the 9 inch crust.

I made this pie today and it was great!  I used a shortbread crum pie shell instead of the graham and it made it taste even lighter. I used whipping cream from a carton and only used but a teaspoon of sugar When mix it. I have to watch my sugar in take and this was light and wonderful.

Other tips were extremely helpful....  time well spent to review them.    Modifications were nutmeg for ginger sub, and 3/4 c. milk sub.   Using ten inch pie crust will give you normal, bottom layer but thin tip layer, but still very good.  Chill overnight to give sufficient structure.    Tough to please father-in-law said I could almost quite my day job.    That sealed the deal for me.

Pretty easy and straight forward to make, even with making my own graham cracker crust.  My only thing I found was that was quite sweet.. so I'd increase the cream cheese and reduce the whipped topping for the bottom layer.

I was looking for a cream cheese/pumpkin pie and was thrilled to find this. I brought it in for a pot luck and it was a hit. I used french vanilla instant pudding though. My husband loves it and I am sure I will be making it again. The fact that is is a no bake pie and can be made in advance with no worries, even better. I did bake the crust for 8 minutes just to firm it up. I have had them crumble and fall apart in the past.

I have been making this recipe for at least 15 years! It's always such a hit! I usually have to make 2 pies since 1 is never enough, they always want more! Great tips on here in the reviews....my tip is that I use "french Vanilla" flavored pudding, adds a little extra yumminess to it & I also always get the graham cracker crust that says "2 extra servings", it gives the pie fillings a little extra room to settle into! I also add a little nutmeg to the spices, but shhh, don't tell anyone!!;)

Made the recipe exactly the way it was written. It turned out really good! 2nd time around I tweaked the recipe. First I doubled the recipe. I used sweat potatoe pie filling instead of pumpkin. By using sweat potatoe pie filling I didn't need to add the rest of the spices because it was already in there. Instead of boring old graham crackers for the crust I used a whole pack of sandies cookies ( shortbread) and crushed it then added half stick of butter and firmly pressed it on a 9x13 pan. I will be making this again!

My mom first came across this recipe when I was little, either in a magazine or an insert in a graham cracker crust(it was so long ago that I can't remember which). It has become a Thanksgiving staple in my family. It's the ABSOLUTE BEST PUMPKIN PIE RECIPE.

Delicious! The filling can easily yield two pies. I make it every Thanksgiving and never have any left over.

Such a hit. I made small ones for Family Thanksgiving and made a big one for Friends Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. It's a nice contrast to have a pumpkin pie that's not so dense and with a little extra fluff on the bottom.

This was a nice, quick recipe to take to Thanksgiving dinner. I found it made a LOT of filling, I threw away probably a third of the cream cheese and the pumpkin mixture each, which makes me think I could have filled 2 pie shells rather than just one (just made smaller pies).

I first came across this recipe 4 years ago! It was a HIT and I make it EVERY YEAR!! I added a lil something special to the crust and I do agree with the suggestion to cool the crust before you layer the rest on....but it's a MUST HAVE!

This was a really nice twist on pumpkin pie.  I don't even like pumpkin pie, OR whipped cream, but I ate most of it myself! It was nice to have something that tasted a lot like pumpkin pie without having to bake it.  I'll make it again I'm sure.

I am not a fan of regular pie crust or pumpkin pies.  This is the only pumpkin pie that I will eat.  My fiance is the same way.  This recipe is perfect.  I have had trouble with the filling being runny, however, I have learned to use more pudding mix than the recipe calls for, this helps the mixture to set better.  I also use,instead of solid pumpkin and adding the spices to it , I use the easy pumpkin pie mix made by Libbys, It already has the spices added to it. This saves a little time and also tastes great.  Those of you that have had trouble with this recipe being runny and not setting properly, do not give up this is a great pie.  Keep trying, it will be well worth it in the end.

I did not have a problem with it setting but found the pumpkin layer to spicy. I gave it a 3 because my family did enjoy it for Thanksgiving.

The pumpkin layer in this was not bad, especially after doubling up on the spices.  Unfortunately, I had the same problem a lot of others did in that my layers just wanted to melt.  I even followed another reviewer's advice and chilled the crust first, and then each layer as it was added, but I still got the melding of layers.  Overall, I think it was a nice change from traditional pumpkin pie, but it was much too pudding-like for me.

This recipe was surprisingly good.  I was a little hesitant when I saw the jello.  I thought it was a bit odd.  However, I tried it and my whole family loved it.  I didn't change anything in the recipe.  I followed directions to the tee and it was just simply delicious.  I don't eat many pumpkin pies so I can't say I've had the best pumpkin pie in the world, but this one was very good.  Also, it's very easy and very hard to mess up.  I've tried a cheesecake pumpkin pie which was harder to make and not as delicious as this one.  Try it!  You'll be pleasantly surprised.

I just found this recipe too rich for mine and my family's taste. So personally wouldn't make it again, but I still give 4 *s cause its a great recipe, I did chill the first layer before adding the pumpkin and it turned out perfect.

This is the best no bake recipe for pumpkin pie I have yet to see. It is super easy. Make sure you chill in between layers and keep the crust chilled before you start. This is simple and so light and will make a lover out of any pumpkin pie hater!! Must try this recipe! Quick and easy and you can't burn it!!!

Very good, but not amazing. I used one whole pumpkin, cut and steamed in the microwave in portions and pushed it through a sieve to get all the stringy pieces out. That part worked out really well. But I felt like the cream cheese layer was not solid enough to hold the weight of the pumpkin layer. Perhaps because I didn't use the canned pumpkin? Anyway, it still got great reviews for Thanksgiving.

I had a large group for Thanksgiving this year, and about half of my guests thought this lacked spice and flavor. I loved the creamy texture. I don't think I will make it again though.

Very easy, and very yummy!!  I also used Choc pudding one time.  Quick and easy - Great for a potluck.  One time I put pecans and carmel on the very bottom, then the layers, and topped it with the cool whip, and more pecans and carmel.  I called it Turtle Layer Pie!!!  YUMMY - I used both the shortbread crust and the graham crust, both are great.  I do prefer the shortbread crust with the choc pudding.

Have been doing this pie for years. It's a family favorite. I sometimes I'll add a thin layer for finely chopped Pecans on top of the cream cheese layer after it sets & then drizzle caramel on the top after slicing.

For Thanksgiving I made this pie and we had a guest over that had never had dinner with us, he took one bite and told us that "it's no good".  Of course where we are from that means don't touch it...the rest is mine.  By accident I didn't get enough pudding mix.  Instead of the big boxes mine were 1 oz. and I added some spices (ginger and pumpkin pie spice) to the white layer.  It held firm and was awesome!

I have never made "homemade" pies before.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was DECADENT!  The only thing I did differently was I used a chocolate cookie crumb crust.  Everyone raved over it!  Problem was, I had no leftovers to enjoy.  Now I have to turn in and make another one.  Thanks for sharing.

Update 11/19/11:  Added 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans to my home made graham cracker crust..The crust was almost as good as the pie! Remember to only use 3/4 cup of milk (I use half and half or cream) or it will be too soupy. 
Update:  11/11/10 Made a sugar-free version. Used sf vanilla pudding, sf cool whip, and splenda for sugar.  Added a couple of extra splenda packets to pumpkin mix.  Got rave reviews!  Tried again and this time only used 3/4 cup of half and half. Excellent results-not runny at all! Made my own pie crust though-used the recipe on the back of the Honey Maid Graham cracker crumbs box and used a smaller pie pan like an old Bakers Square tin.  If you have left over pumpking filling, it can be served and eaten as a "pumpkin mousse".  Five people asked me for the recipe and one said it was the best pumpkin pie she ever had!

We love this pumpkin pie. It is a family Thanksgiving tradition! It is lighter than a typical pumpkin but is very satisfying~

I made this pie for our family holidays because my daughter is allergic to eggs.  It was a hit with her and my husband.  I personally found the pumpkin layer to be a bit heavy and strong-tasting, but maybe this is because I am such a big fan of custard-style pumpkin pies.  We also made the crust homemade with graham cracker crumbs which is sooooo easy and tastes soooo much better than store bought.  All in all, for an egg-free dessert is was great!

Sooo good! I didn't pay attention to pie crust size, so my pan floweth over a bit. If I'd had a bigger pan, i could have had more of the cheesecake-y bottom than I did. I will def. use again!

I followed suggestion of freezing bottom layer before putting pumpkin on top. I had no problems with the recipe being runny, in fact it was very think, very hard to get it out of piepan.  It was very rich.  Didn't love it but thought it was a nice addition to our dinner.

The cream cheese layer is great, the pumpkin layer not so much. I regret having made this for Thanksgiving without having tried it first.

This was an incredibly simple recipe that tastes better than any store-bought pumpkin pie, so if you're thinking about buying a pie, just whip up this one.  The purchased graham cracker pie crust didn't really do it for me, so I think the next time I will bake my own crust.  I also had leftover pie filling and usually prefer not to have that happen.

This pie was really good.  Substituting mostly sugar free ingredients still made a great pie.  The two layers were a wonderful combination and I will definitely be making this again!

I couldn't find the recipe I normally use, to make this pie every Thanksgiving.  This recipe seemed identical and is always a favorite.  Now I have it saved in my recipe box and will always be able to locate the recipe when I need it.

I didn't wait long enough for the bottom layer to set before pouring in the pumpkin mix :/, so my pie didn't look anything like the picture. But the pie did taste fantastic, regardless of what it looked like.  Lots of compliments from everyone at Thanksgiving dinner.  They appreciated the change from the traditional pie.

This was just okay. It doesn't set up firm like a pie. The pumpkin layer has the consistency of pudding. I'll be sticking with the old traditional pumpkin pie.

This pie looked so great I had to try and make it. It was pretty easy (big mess though haha I can't 'whisk' very well and I got pumpkin all over the table). I'll have to see how it tastes tomorrow at Thanksgiving dinner!

Although I like regular baked pumpkin pie better, this recipe wasn't bad at all.  I didn't realize that it was a "no bake" recipe until I started preparing the first layer of the pie.  I was surprised on what a great pie it came out to be.  Everyone who had a piece, enjoyed it.  This is the perfect recipe if you're in a hurry, and you have no time to bake a regular pumpkin pie.

I've made this several times after finding it on AllRecipes.com two years ago, and everyone in the family loves it.  I use 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice in place of the spices listed which makes it a little more convenient.  Tastes just like a lighter and airy pumpkin pie without the baking!

This was ok but a bit too pumpkinny for some - though the whipped topping layer helps to temper it.  I'll stick with baking pumpkin pie.

This was not good at all!  Based on the reviews, I was expecting something great.  When I was reading the recipe, it didn't seem like there was a lot of sugar in the cream cheese but I followed it anyway.  It was definetly not sweet enough!!!  I would add at least a cup of sugar.

If you're tired of the same old pumpkin pie and want something with a little extra zip, then try this one!!!  Absolutely delicious!  I sprinkled just a little extra cinnamon on top.

The cheese/whipped cream bottom layer rose up over the pumpkin layer so I spread it all over the top - the result: "triple layer" divinity!

This was an unbelievably easy recipe.  It has a wonderful taste without being overbearing.  My kids (both 4) don't like pumpkin, so if your kids aren't big fans of pumpkin pie, they may not like it.  All the adults thought it was great!

I saw this recipe on the back of some food item years ago and fell in love. I lost it and am so glad I found. I let my 5 year old son and his friends make this in class for their Thanksgiving Feast. It was a hit.

My husband liked this pie, but he said there was a bit of an aftertaste. I think this was due to the pudding mix. Next time I will try adding more milk. This recipe is actually enough for 2 pies. Thumbs up!
