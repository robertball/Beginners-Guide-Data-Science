We have reviewed this recipe for errors, and it should actually call for only 1 package of onion soup mix. We apologize for the inconvenience!

I have finally found a wonderful homemade sauce!! This recipe was PERFECT, I would not change a thing.  At first I thought I wouldn't have enough sauce for a whole box of pasta, but as it turned out there was some leftover.  YUM.... will definitely make this again.  Very diet friendly for my weight watchers core plan too!!

I am a novice cook and this dish was delicious and
SO easy to make. I cut down on the onion mix
packets and just used 3 packets and will know better next time to go easier on the salt. I also added some red bell peppers to the sauce and it turned out thick and flavorful - will definitely make it again. Since I live alone I froze the rest but I'm looking forward to finally being able to invite friends over for dinner! I cooked it with a slow cooker, too, and it was delicious!

Very tasty sauce.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms and a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic because of other reviews that said the sauce needed to  be more tomato-ey.  Also a little wine to boost the flavor and some additional oregano & basil because of the extra tomatoes.  I would suggest simmering for longer than "until heated" - about 20-30 minutes - to avoid any crunchiness from the dry onions.

Made this sauce with meatballs instead. 3/4 package of Onion soup mix and a little more water.  This sauce is Stupid Good!!! The whole family loved it!!!! The 12 year old thought it was great!! I would use the entire 1oz package of soup mix if I used the ground beef.  THANK YOU!

I use the same ingredients except I chop fresh onions and bell peppers instead of the onion soup mix, I use 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of one, I add a can of stewed tomatoes and I use dried Italian Seasoning instead of the Oregano (I do add additional dried Basil as the recipe suggests).  It only takes an additional 5-7 minutes of prep time, but it makes all the difference in the world.  Another secret of mine is to use Worcestershire Sauce while browning the ground beef and I sweat the onions and bell peppers in 2 tablespoons of Olive Oil before adding the meat to brown.  This makes the meat so much more flavorful.  Oh, and I would omit the water and add a teaspoon of sugar to cut the acidity.

With the changed recipe(adding only one onoin soup mix) the results turned out fantastic for a base sauce. I like a few more things in mine(more garlic, mushrooms and veggies,diced tomatoes, wine or beer or both...)

This sauce was way too salty even for me and I love salt. I had only put in 3 packs of onion mix also so I could not imagine what a 4th would have tasted like. I ended up adding about 3/4 c of brown sugar to compensate for all the salt. Once I did that it was pretty good but still a little on the salty side...perhaps cut down the onion mix to 2 packets and no need to add any salt after that.

Easy recipe and great except for the Oregano--too overpowering.  I always use Marjoram; a milder herb which doesn't rob the flavors of the other ingredients.

This was pretty darn good...much better than my usual "buy it in a jar" method! I will definately add this to my recipe box. Next time I may add some mushrooms or other veggies - nice solid recipe!

I halved the recipe and added a can of crushed tomatoes.  I think next time I will half the recipe and use only 1 package of onion soup mix.  It was a little bit too much onion with two packages.  thanks for offering!  Its great in a pinch.

I've done so many things with this recipe1 I've never used the soup mix, just real onion. The first couple times I made it more or less exact, and this last time I changed the whole thing and put in chicken instead of beef (an interesting choice, I know, but I didn't have anmy beef), added tons of veggies, put in two whole cans of tomato paste and some extra water. You just can't mess it up!

I didn't add any salt and used only one package of the soup mix and also added chopped onions that I browned with the hamburger. I thought it was a bit sour, so I'll add a teaspoon or two of brown sugar next time and maybe a little red wine as others have suggested.

I have never made pasta sauce before and used this recipe to use for a homemade lasagna that I was also trying for the first time. Making this sauce really added the special kick to the lasagna. This is a GREAT recipe!!! Thank you!

I'm so sorry to say this but after making this recipe I found it terribly salty for my liking. I'm not saying it wasn't a good recipe but I found the onion soup leaves quite a powerful flavour and leaves it quite salty. I'm going to add double of everything else to the pot and see if that helps.

This sauce was way to salty for my taste. I think that it has the potential to be a great sauce but I would omit the salt and substitute fresh onions for the onion soup mix. I also added some italian seasoning and paprika to it for a little extra flavor.

Pretty good and quick to make.  We like the Best Marinara Sauce recipe better, but this one is nice because it doesn't require wine.   If I have to buy one bottle of wine... I have to buy two.  I just can't make it out of the wine store without at least two bottles.

I only used about 3/4 of the envelope of onion soup and that was still too much for me. This sauce was pretty tasty, though I can't say it is better than some of the jar sauces.

I have been making a sauce similar to this for many years, but this was excellent. I added one thing, 3 or 4 oz. of hard salami chopped very fine, it adds an interesting flavor to an already very good sauce.

I made this like the recipe using one onion soup mix like the staff said and found it very tomato-y tasting and bland. I added some Italian seasoning and more garlic which made the flavor much better. However, my kids did not care for the tons of tiny onion slivers from the onion soup mix.

This sauce is awesome! My family LOVED it. The only change I made was that added more garlic and added a can of sliced mushrooms.

I have been making the same recipe for years now but without the onion soup.  Instead I sautee onions and green peppers in olive oil, the same as Melody aka Dumpling.  I do not add the salami, though, but it does sound good.  This is a basic recipe and once you have all of this made as the recipe calls for, you can add different ingredients to it.  I love the easy, quick way this cooks up and it looks and tastes out of this world.  And I thought I made it up!  I guess others make it the same way I do.

I have been looking for a good basic meat sauce recipe and this is the one!  I made two changes in ingredients.  I didn't add the salt because the onion soup mix had enough, and I added mushrooms just because I like them in meat sauce.  I also ended up simmering the sauce for about an hour.  Next time I will double the recipe because we like extra sauce and leftovers.  This is a good sauce to add on-hand items.  My husband wants to try it with some red pepper flakes next time for some spice.  I think adding other veggies, wine, sausage might be good too, but it was still great per recipe.

This was good and easy but I thought it needed more Italian spices. Next time I would add a  packet of  Italian dressing seasoning and some crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.

AMAZING!!! We doubled the recipe to make more.....so we doubled everything and it was amazing!!! We added a bit more garlic (garlic fans), added 1 pound of Italian sausage (so I pound ground beef and 1 pound ground sausage), and we added fresh basil. Simply put....the best sauce ever. Kids loved it too!!!

So I tried this recipe as written and it was not great...kind of bland. I then added onion, more garlic, red pepper flakes, and zucchini. After simmering for approximately 1 hour it was much better. In future I would only add 1 can of tomato paste. I would consider this just a base for sauce that needs a lot of adjustments.

i did not have the tomato paste, but found the recipe was wonderful the way it was.  I used the lipton beefy onion soup mix as well (since I had it available).  We had left over sautéed onion, garlic, peppers red and green, that I tossed in with ground beef and pasta, viola!  second dinner.

I make this usually when I need a quick meal. It's great! However I'm kinda  healthy person, basically I just like real..healthy food. Nothing hard core. So I try to avoid "seasoning mix" type stuff. 

So instead of the onion soup mix I add a TBS of onion flakes, salt pepper, basil, oregano. I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes because we like "chunky" sauce. Works great.

Easy recipe to make, but I was not impressed with the taste. I was not a fan of the onion soup mix (yes, I only used one packet). I also think the tomato paste overpowered the tomato sauce. If I make this again, I will definitely be changing some things around.

We love this sauce. I thought the four packages of onion soup mix was going to overpower the taste, but I was happily wrong. We really enjoyed this easy sauce. Thanks Sister!
