Didn't follow exactly, but because there is only 1 review at the moment I thought this might be helpful.

First time (based on what I had on hand): Substituted walnuts for pecans, chia seeds for flax, milk for almond milk.  Cook time double.

My family did not care for the texture.  The flavor was good though, and I liked the healthy ingredients, so decided to give it a second try.

Second time, to make it less chunky: Substituted peanut butter for pecans, 1 additional cup apple sauce for apples and raisins, milk for almond milk.   Cook time double.

It went over a bit better with everyone, but still wasn't a hit.  That said, I kept eating them, so there was certainly something appealing about it.  I think it may be that we don't care for the texture of baked oatmeal--we usually eat regular oatmeal or overnight oats.  I'm pretty confident even if we had followed the recipe perfectly, it wouldn't have been better received because of the texture.  That's why I took off a star.  However, 4 stars for a good flavor, for being healthy, and for enjoying them myself.  I thought they were best fully cooled and the next day--didn't last past that :-)  I would say it's worth a try if the ingredients look good to you.  Thanks for sharing!

OMG- I think I found my baking twin.  I have made many different muffins, and usually had to substitute some ingredients for healthier option.  This recipe; I followed exactly.  These muffins are so moist and so delicious  that I can't wait to share them!

I did not care for them too much, but I am trying to eat more healthy so it is a process.  I made a half batch and made mini muffins so I got 24, approx. 50 calorie muffins.  Cooked for 13 minutes and as others did I did substitute walnuts as that is what I had on hand.  I may try with double apple and double spices if I make them again.

I used walnuts instead of pecans because thatâ€™s what I had. I also substituted apple butter for 1/2 the applesauce and 3 Tbls. of blue agave syrup for the brown sugar. Also I baked in a 11 x 7 pan for 30 minutes and cut into 12 squares and froze in individual servings to warm up later. I really liked it but I gave it 4 stars because I feel is still needs something.
