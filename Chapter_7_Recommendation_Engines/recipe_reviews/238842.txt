Best way ever to cook corn! Not mentioned was to shuck husk after cooking you cut about 1" off the stock end and then you can squeeze the cob out of the husk like toothpaste. Holding the husk this way removes 99.9% of the silk. I found 3 mins on an 1100 microwave is enough as any longer seems to pucker the kernels.

This recipe works well and is extremely easy. Variations to try is to open the husk and add butter to the ear of corn, reclose the husk and
microwave as directed. I think that cooking the corn in the husk adds even more flavor to the corn. Also, if you are using already husked corn on the cob, all you have to do is to wrap the ears of corn individually with dampened paper towels and microwave as directed. With my microwave, 1 large ear of corn only needs to cook 3 minutes. When first starting to cook the corn this way, start with a shortened cooking time and then cook longer if need be. You can always  cook it a little longer if needed but I haven't figured yet how to UNCOOK anything.

Like other similar recipes this works great.  3 minutes was just right.  Wrapping in a paper towel isn't really necessary.  Make sure to use hot pads or towel, the corn is really hot.  I love that there is virtually no silk left behind.

I've done this for years , if corn is at room temperature it will cook even faster. I also do it with husked corn (it's nice to leave the husks in the grocery store), just wrap each ear in waxed paper & micro as you would unhusked corn. If I do more than a few ears I do in small batches for even cooking.

I've been cooking ears of corn this way for over a year or so since seeing a post on Facebook. It will be very hot so you need a towel or something similar to shuck it when done; I use two Ov GlovesÂ®. Microwave ovens vary and, to cook two ears, I have to leave them in for approximately 6-7 minutes. Let them sit for a couple minutes before attacking them. Easy way to quickly prepare corn cobs ??and best of all... No Silk.

This method has not failed us.  Three and a half minutes per ear seems best.  We nuked 4 ears for fourteen minutes this weekend.  We let is rest a bit.   We then cut off the stalk end about an inch up.  Using a dish towel or oven mitts, pinched the ears out.  It was hot and perfectly cooked.  Butter, salt and pepper up and you're good to go.

This is much better than thr removal of the husk and use a damp paper towel!
I simply soak the corn in the husk foe a few minuets and them microwave. You need the flavor of the husk to add to the corn!

Absolutely the best! Only way to cook corn and retain the flavor. I cut my ends off before covering with a casserole dish. Slicing down the length afterwards is a snap. The husk just rolls off and ready to eat.

After microwaving let cool about 5 minutes. Cut the base off including the bottom 2 rows of kernels. Then grasp the opposite end (the pointed end) and squeeze and shake until cob falls out. This will also remove the silk.

My husband always makes his corn this way. We soak several ears in cold water before cooking. Wrap your ear in several paper towels and cook for 3-3.5 minutes. Cut the bottom off about an inch and the silk  just falls off. Can't wait for this years harvest. Delicious!

Easiest way to cook cobs EVER! My only suggestion is to let them sit in the Nuke Box (without opening the door) for 5 min when they're done.

This is an absolutely no fail way to make an ear of corn in the husks.  Look no further and follow directions exactly as the corn comes out perfectly.   I cannot comment on multiple ears.  I have a one year old microwave and 5 minutes was just right!
