Good recipe!  Per other reviewers, I did the following:  replaced the shortening with butter/margarine, used 1/2 tsp baking soda + 1/2 tsp baking powder, used skim milk in place of half-and-half  for the glaze, and I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the glaze.  I spooned the glaze into a ziplock bag and chilled it in the fridge for 15min while I let the cookies cool.  After the cookies were completely cool, I cut a corner snip off the ziplock bag containing the glaze and squeezed it to pipe lovely designs onto the cookies.

I made these last week. Oh my GOSH, these are SOOO good. My hubby and I both loved them! I used margarine rather than shortening as margarine tends to help keep cookies from spreading out too thin. I also grated my apple (used 1 large Granny Smith), and squeezed most of the juice out. Lastly, to keep the cookies from spreading out due to the extra moisture in apples, I added about a half cup of rolled oats. The glaze is perfect with milk and a hint of cinnamon, and these cookies are to die for! I cooked them on 375 for 10-11 minutes. Oh, a secret to a good cookie is to use parchment paper rather than greasing your cookie sheets. This will be a new fall staple in our household! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great tasting soft cookie, cakelike rather than crispy.  They remained soft even after leaving them out awhile to let the cookies cool before glazing.  The cookies also stayed out on the racks to let the glaze harden so I could pack them safely in a container to give to friends (I kept a few for myself, just for scientific purposes), and the cookies still remained soft.  I always enjoy reading member feedback, and went with the following suggestions:
used equal parts shortening and butter, coursely grated one Granny Smith apple, and reduced oven temp to 350 adding a couple of extra minutes for baking.  I don't eat much salt, so I went with a scant 1/2 tsp, used pecans I had on hand instead of walnuts, and used golden raisins instead of regular raisins.  I liked the idea of a decorative glaze, but really the cookies are sweet enough without it.  I made a thick glaze, put it in a small ziploc bag, and snipped off a tiny corner at the bottom of the bag. Starting at the center of each cookie, I squeezed out a spiral design.  The cookies look nice and it minimizes the amount of glaze so it doesn't overpower the cookie.  I made the amount of glaze per the original recipe, and only used about half of the glaze.  Thanks for sharing a very good cookie recipe that stands out in the crowd.  It's nice to find a recipe that uses fresh apples!

For those of you who appreciate a review of the recipe as it's written, here you go: THESE ARE FABULOUS! I used shortening, even though I usually use butter. I didn't increase any spices, as I normally would. I baked at the time/temp specified and it worked well! Bake just until they lose their sheen...they will look like they are darkening, but it's the spices, trust me. 
I also normally use a cookie scooper for a perfectly round cookie, but liked the rustic look of the chopped nuts and apples.
I orginally wasn't going to frost them because they are SUPER tasty without it... but decided to do it just to follow the recipe... WOWZA! A very light layer of frosting/glaze knocks them out of the park!
5 stars for a GREAT recipe!

Absolutely amazing. For once I did not change a thing except to bake at 375 for 8-9 minutes (first batch had to be thrown out at 400 degrees and 10 minutes the bottoms were black). The only think I may do in the future is add 1 extra cup of apples. These are incredible. Soft, chewy and full of flavour.

Like a couple others, I used unsalted butter instead of shortening; I also left out the nuts (since a lot of people can't eat them) and the raisins (I don't like them) and added cinnamon chips instead.  I had to make a second batch of icing because the recipe just didn't make enough to cover all the cookies.  They were excellent, though, and everyone who tried them came back for seconds and thirds!

WOW--I've made these for the last 2 years during apple season. BIG HIT, everyone loves them.  Only thing I changed was that I used milk instead of half and half for the frosting and I put the frosting in a cake decorated bottle and drew lines on the cookies.  Easier because these cookies are so moist they're hard to frost.

These are yummy cookies.  The edges are crispy and inside is fluffy, almost like a muffin. I omitted the raisins and replaced with extra apples.  Also added a tad bit of vanilla to the mix.

These were so yummy!!!!  My 11 month old was crazy about these.  I am always looking for a way to sneak in some healthy items into our cookies and this was a great and tasty way to make them.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I can certainly understand how you've never met anyone who didn't love these cookies. They're absolutely irresistible!! 

Substituted 1/2 tsp soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder for the 1 tsp soda. Gives a lighter texture. Also, added an extra egg for a rich crumb. Added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the glaze for color and flavor.

These are moist, perfectly spiced and wonderfully aromatic. The kind of recipe that makes your reputation as a baker. Thank you for sharing this with us all.

Great tasting cookie! I used granny smith apples which I grated. I used all butter, added in chopped walnuts and both regular and golden raisins. I added ½ tsp. of baking powder and ½ tsp. of baking soda in place of the 1 teaspoon of baking soda. I mixed the dough and dropped a Tablespoon onto the cookie sheet then placed it into the oven. The first batch of cookies turned dark brown on the edges and underneath the cookies while it was still baking, so I lowered the temperature to 375 and baked for 10 minutes. The rest of the cookies came out fine baking a round shape. I baked 39 cookies. There was a wonderful scent of apples, raisins and cinnamon filling up my house! I made the glaze and chilled it while all the cookies cooled.  I couldn’t wait for the cookie to cool so I ate one while it was still warm. The cookie was soft and chewy with a “slight” crispy edge. In each mouthful I could taste the apples, the plump sweet raisins and walnuts, which gave the cookies a nice texture. The apples, walnuts raisins with the combination of spices all made for a wonderful cookie!  I did notice that when I ate another cookie with the glaze that it had “softened” and was no longer crispy on the edges. It was still soft, chewy and great tasting! The cookie has a "muffin-like" texture. The glaze is not overly sweet and adds a nice touch to the cookies. Overall this is a lovely, nicely spiced soft, moist and chewy cookie.

There is a reason this recipe is so highly reviewed and that's because these cake-cookie hybrids are stupid tasty.  I did half butter half shortening, used 1 cup whole wheat flour and no raisins/walnuts.  My boyfriend said "I hope I can eat all of these right now" when he took his first bite.  I would say frosting the cookies when they have cooled is probably better than while still warm, as it instructs, since the glaze melts into the cookies - tastes great either way, but if you want the "look" then let them cool.  I also followed the reviewers' instructions to bake at 375 vs 400, although I would be interested to try the higher heat with the batter that I had.  I don't write too many reviews, but this one is worth it!

Very yummy and now one of my staple fall deserts!  I left out the nuts, as I have a child under 2 at home, but added another small handful of golden raisins to the mix.  Everyone in the house loved them!

These were fantastic!  I didn't have any raisins, so I added an extra cup of apples.  I also skipped the frosting after tasting how fabulous they were plain.  I used a larger cookie scoop for the second batch, and chilled the dough for 30 min. before baking.  The cookies came out bigger and puffier - delicious!  I'll be making these again next weekend!

This recipe is amazing!  Thank you so much for making it available on this website.  I made my first batch exactly as instructed, and it was shockingly delicious.  There is something about the glaze that pushes these right over the edge beyond all other apple cookies I have made.  Then I made a double batch with just apples (no raisins or nuts).  I used 2 cups total apples per recipe instead of 1 cup apples, 1 cup raisins, and 1 cup nuts.  They were just as incredible.  I now have requests for more of these cookies, so I had better get back to baking!

K, so I made these cookies for Christmas and they were GONE in 3 days!  I had to make a second batch to put in my gift baskets as we ATE them ALL!!  They are like little delicious apple cakes! I made them just as written,  the little chunks of apple cook in there beautifully, I would definitely NOT shred the apple as it would then disappear, I used Granny Smith, but I think any hard apple would be good.  I glazed most of them but was heavy handed with it and ran out so a few just had powdered sugar, which was good as well!

Very tasty cookies.  I had some Gala apples that were at the end of their lives (kinda soft) so I made these cookies.  My kids and my friends (and their kids) liked them.  I left the peels on the apples (I was feeling lazy!), I omitted the ground cloves (didn't have it) and left out the nuts.  Delicious, quick & healthy snack.  I definitely think this is a keeper recipe!

Absolutely lovely!  They're more cake-like than chewy.  Craisins are a nice addition, and the spices are the perfect blend.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

I'm going to give these a five even though I thought they were a bit too sweet with the frosting.  Only changes I made was to use 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter, pecans instead of walnuts, and for the icing, I used maple extract.  A good cookie.

This is a really nice Fall cookie.  The apple I used was exceptionally sweet so I reduced the sugar to 1 & 1/8 cups, used butter, reduced the cloves and add some vanilla. I was careful not to over-mix and the cookies were nicely mounded.  The icing would have made them more attractive but after tasting one decided it would have made them too sweet.  Thank you for sharing.

Do yourself a favor and make a double batch of these right off the bat. AMAZING!

I doubled the apples and omitted the nuts. Next time, I might add some oats, just to crisp them up a bit, because although mighty tasty, they fell apart very easily. 

These are a keeper. You'll agree, I promise.

Lovely soft/light/somewhat delicate cookie. I followed many of the suggestions; butter for shortening, 1/2 WW flour, squeezed my apples and added vanilla. I dbl the recipe and did three batches: just apples,apples and soaked sultana raisins, and finally apples, raisins and roasted almond slivers.Absolutely loved the apple and raisin. Next time I will not squeeze my apples and add more apple to the mix. Am anxious to try with cinnamon chips(buying was out). Will not glaze if chips added.Regarding glaze... loved it added1/4 tap cinnamon, held 1/2 cup icing sugar and added 4 tbsp of maple syrup and a tbsp of flour. Loved this, will add to Thanksgiving and Christmas baking. Perfect with a 3pm cuppa or as my 7 year old said " a cold glass of milk, please"

Yumba! I followed the letter to a T with the exception of substituting margarine for shortening. I made 6 dozen of these for a cookie swap and folks are going to LOVE them.

I baked up a storm today and these were part of the menu. Not sure what I did wrong? They were definitely flat, even with the baking powder/soda changes.    I ended up making them into mini muffins because the cookies were so flat.  I'll try again because the flavor was good.

excellent cookies. 375 degrees for 9 min gave me the best results, and I also used a ziploc bag to put on the glaze. used cinnamon instead of nutmeg (which I don't keep in the house regularly). Boyfriend loved them too, as did his family

These are delicious and cake-y. I used half butter/half shortening and left out the raisins. I forgot the milk in the batter; I drizzled some in for the very last tray. The ones without milk taste the same, but they didn't rise at all. The ones with milk look exactly like the photo! I also made my glaze fairly runny so I could just dollop it on instead of spreading. I'd definitely make them again.

These are delicious!  The only thing I changed was to use 1/4c shortening and 1/4c butter to get the benefit of taste along with the benefit of texture :) My son really loved these too, DH liked them a lot but he's not a cookie fan usually.  I piped the icing on from a baggie with the corner cut, I found that to be an easy way to ice these. We'll have these again!

I just finished making these cookies, and they are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, but used butter instead of shortening(personal preference). They turned out great! I don't understand why people go and change the recipe, when there is no need to do so. Great recipe, as is, and I will be making them again.

These are really good, but not quite as flavorful as I expected (and I used 1 /12 cups of chopped apple instead of just one cup and I also used the raisins, nuts, etc. that the original recipe calls for). I didn't plan to do the glaze, but I found that they really needed it or else they just wouldn't have had much taste as I prefer. So I'll make these again, but next time, I'll add some vanilla to the batter and use at least 2 cups of chopped apples. Oh, also -- I put mine on the cookie sheet in balls about 2" round and my cookies didn't flatten and didn't look so nice with the glaze. So if you're planning to glaze these and take them somewhere and are concerned about presentation, I'd definitely keep the dough in small, tablespoon-size balls (like the recipe says to do, anyways) so that they do flatten out a bit. But the consistency of mine still turned out really good. A great cookie for Autumn! :)

First of all, these are delicious! The only change I might make is I would try it as a bar cookie next time. They are so moist that they didn't come off the cooking mat very easily, but I may have used too much apple. And the next day they are still very moist. But they are VERY yummy! I also used the 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda. I might try adding oatmeal next time to see if they hold together better, as others suggested. I left out the nuts & raisins, too. Regardless of how they fall apart, they will be a favorite in our household!

I made these cookies as given (except I used real butter in place of the shortening and 2% milk in the glaze instead of the half-and-half) and they turned out perfectly. I also added cinnamon chips to the batter (because I had them on hand). This is a wonderful recipe! I agree with those who said to let them get almost all the way cool before frosting. I wouldn't let them cool completely, however, because the frosting doesn't 'glaze as well. Don't leave out the nuts!

This cookie is just right.  The only problem I had was that when I stored them in a container they became really soft and cake like.  I think they are best left on the counter and eaten with in a day or so.

Mmm Spicy. These are very flavorful soft cookies. I did not want raisins so I did not add them. I used pecans because that's the nut I had on hand.  I also made my glade thinner. Easy recipe. Will make these cookies again and again.

Ah. Mah. Zing. Only made tiny adjustments- used unsalted butter, left out raisins and nuts, used whatever milk i had in fridge instead of half and half for glaze. Fabulous. more cake like than crispy cookie, which i love.

This recipe is definitely a keeper even with the two changes I made. I used one stick of sweet cream butter rather than the 1/2 c. shortening, and I used 1c whole wheat flour with 1c white flour.You talk about good! My husband fell in love wih them, and the group I'm making them for probably will do the same. Thank you, Sandy, for a great recipe!

Yum!  My husband just exclaimed "I love fall!"  I used apples from my parents' tree in these yummy cookies.  I followed the recipe as written and they turned out thin and chewy.  Just perfect.  I did bake them at 375 instead of 400 for 10 minutes.  As another reviewer suggested, I added some cinnamon to the glaze and then just drizzled it over the cookies.  These will become a fall tradition.

Wow!  Tasted so good and made the house smell amazing...  Perfect recipe for a cool fall morning.  I used 1 /2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  I didn't add raisins because my kids begged me not to :) I made the glaze and really loved it, but I didn't use it for all the cookies, as they didn't really need it.

Used 1 Honey Crisp apple and chopped it fine.  It was more than a cup but it worked out great.   Like others, I used butter instead of shortening.   I forgot to add the 1/4 c. milk and I guess the additional apples made up for that.  I added chopped dried cherries instead of raisins.  I'm not a raisin lover.  Delicious cookie!  Used maple syrup instead of cream for the glaze and had to make additional glaze.  Added a tablespoon or so of milk to thin it a bit.  We loved these cookies.

These cookies have an excellent flavor! I used regular 2% milk for the glaze and it turned out great. I grated the apples like other reviewers suggested, but next time I'm going to dice them...I didn't think these was quite enough apple flavor. I'll probably also add a little more apple. All in all delicious and i will definitely be making them again!

.I took them these to a book club meeting, and they were a huge hit -- I've even had several requests for more since then! The other members are not giant sweets fans, so I left off the glaze, but the cookies were still sweet enough for me and my sweet tooth. I took a few of the suggestions in the other comments (e.g. I used half shortening, half butter) and I added the vanilla directly to the batter. They turned out great. I highly recommend these!

Soft and Delicious! Although i substituted 1/2 cup of unsalted butter for the shortening, and soy milk for the cream in the glaze. I also added about a 1/8 cup of apple cider because the mix was a little dry in the beginning. Maybe i did something wrong, but the cider worked out in the end. Good stuff!

400 degrees for 10 minutes left me with burned, back bottoms. This definetely needs more apple as well. Cook at 375 for 8 minutes.

I thought these were really great cookies. They are very moist. I don't like a hard cookie. I left out the nuts and the raisins. I don't really like nutty cookies unless its macadamia and the husband and I hate raisins so I don't stock them in the pantry. We had just gone to the apple orchard and wanted something to make that wasn't pie and I found these. I subbed smart balance for the shortening, and once I got down to adding the last dry ingredients it seemed already more moist than most cookie batters so I left out the milk completely. I was too lazy to dig all the spices out of the cabinet and allspice was right in front so I used a tsp of that with a tsp of cinnamon. I decreased the temp to 375 per some reviewers but that increased the time to about 13-15 minutes. I used a maple glaze instead of the one that was written because I had just made the maple-drizzled apple muffins from this site and really like the maple glaze so I used that and it was really good with the spicy apple flavor of the cookies. for the glaze it was: 1 cup powdered sugar, 4 tablespoons maple syrup and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. These are a hit with me and when my husband gets home we'll see how he likes them. It's an nice break from chocolate chip cookies I usually make :)

These are very tasty, moist cookies. I have made them twice and everyone in the family liked them.  The first time I made these cookies I added more spice but I thought it was too much; the second time,  I made them exactly as the recipe was written except I soaked the raisins in some warm water to plump them up before adding to the batter.  This is one of my family's favorite cookies.

Delicious for fall! I baked cookies on 375 for 10 minutes and it was perfect. I used one granny smith that ended up being about 1 1/2 cups of apple. I used a zip bag for adding the glaze when the cookies had cooled down a little and it worked out great. I'll be making these again!

Mmmm!  Moist and delicious; the frosting was a perfect finish.  I had some kitchen problems which led to a few changes... I realized midway that our refrigerator was broken, and the eggs had probably gone bad, so I used 2 Tbsp. soy flour and 1/4 cup water instead - weird, but the cookies ended up delicious so I guess it worked :)  I also used butter and pecans, and I baked these as bars in a jelly roll pan for about 30 minutes.  I bet the original recipe would make great cookies too - I will try it again when things are less crazy in the kitchen.  Thank you!

I found these to be a wonderful change of pace.  I am all about soft cookies and this one is just that.  I did however, realize after I put a tray in the oven, that I forgot to add the baking soda.  I added it (minus a bit to compensate for the amount of dough already in the oven)to the rest of the batter but found these cookies came out rather flat.  They both tasted great and stayed soft, but I think I like the appearance of the fluffier version/no baking soda (like in the recipe picture)...I suppose it may have been a fluke, so I will try it again as the recipe states to see if they come out flat...if so, I'll ditch the baking soda completely!

They taste great, but I think I must have under-baked them, because they're way too soft. I also didn't glaze them because I have frosting of all kinds. They're very well spiced, warm and tasty.

My family liked these. Dicing the apples is tedious, next time I would grate them and perhaps increase the amount slightly.  Substituted trans-fat free marg. for shortening.  Am I the only one who thought the oven temp was too high?  I reduced it to 350 after the 1st sheet.

These are really excellent cookies for fall.  I did use only half the shortening and substituted butter for the other half.  I used an extra 1/2 cup apples and 1/2 cup raisins in place of the nuts.  Will definitely make these again!

Added half tsp baking powder and baking soda to dry ingredients. Added 2 tsp vanilla to wet ingredients.  Also added 1/2 cupish oatmeal. Baked 11 min. Doubled batch and got 4 dozen. Add more Apple next time or grate it.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious. I found that they bake quickly and  were done to perfection when the bottoms were brown but the tops did not look quite done. A little orange color to the glaze would add a nice touch for fall.

I substituted coconut oil for shortening since I'm feeding this to a bunch of toddlers. One of them has a dairy allergy so I used coconut milk instead and crossed my fingers. The cookies taste great and I didn't make the glaze. For Halloween I'm going to make them into a pumpkin shape and use the raisins for the face.

I will give this recipe a 4 for flavor, but the texture was more soft and chewy than cake like. Followed the directions to a T. This was a very soft moist cookie dough, after the first batch spread ALOT, I put the cookie dough in the refrig. for about 1 hr.it did help.

Great flavor! And like another reviewer said, they're more cake-like than cookie-like. They're soft and springy... I actually added a touch more flour, and they were still very, very soft. I didn't realize I was out of confectioner's sugar when I made them, so I didn't make the icing, but they were delicious enough without. My 17-year-old kid brother was practically eating them three at a time! I put the best of the batch in a gift for my Mother, and needless to say her diet hasn't been going so well! Just mixing in the cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg into the flour made my day feel so christmas-ey!

These cookies are so good!  I get requests for them from family and co-workers all the time since I found this here a few months ago. Very moist cake-like cookies.  I do not use a lot of glaze, I half the glaze recipe and just drizzle a little on  top or sometimes I skip the glaze because these cookies are fantastic without it.

These are delicious cookies that were a hit with everyone. Lightly spiced, just a little crispy outside, with soft chewy centers. I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't try the frosting as I was out of butter - I used "gingerbread frosting for cookies" from this site instead which was a great match. Watch these carefully if you bake them at the suggested 400 degrees. Or, line your cookie sheet with parchment paper to prevent the bottoms from overbrowning. The only thing I would change next time I make these would be to use pecans instead of the walnuts.

Excellent, soft, cake like cookie.  Using apples from the backyard.  Used butter instead of shortening b/c I had it on hand.. not sure if it makes a difference or not.  Could reduce salt to 1/4 t, and I reduced the raisins to 3/4 c.  I didn't realize icing was so easy to make.  I'll be making all my icing from scratch from now on.   I had a couple of them but they are too tempting to so I took them to work and they were gone within the hour.  Thank you for a nice recipe using fresh apples.

These are delicious. I made them with a Granny Smith apple and the flavor is perfect.
I didn't have enough brown sugar on hand, but I used the rest (about half what was needed) and supplemented it with a granulated sugar/honey mixture and it worked out quite well. I was also out of nutmeg and substituted allspice. Very impressed with the flexibility of this recipe.

Loved them, I made the first batch with raisins & chopped walnuts and the second batch I made with chopped marishino cherries & pecans, they were both yummy. I used 1% milk instead of half & half.

BIG hit. Will cook for a minute or 2 longer next time. Used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and pumpkin spice creamer for the icing. Top also with a bit of cinnamon-sugar. Makes a very pretty cookie and great with a morning cup of coffee.

I wasn't sure when I got these cookies out of the oven, I don't always love the soft cookies, and when I tried one after it had cooled, I didn't think they had much flavor and I wasn't crazy about the texture. I ended up only making half the batch. I put them in a covered pan and left them out on my counter. The next day I tried one and it was SO GOOD! Moist with lots of flavor. I will definitely make them again, definitely a crowd pleaser, my family gobbled them up!  Changes I made: butter for shortening, I add 1/3 cup of applesauce and still used the 1 cup of apples. I omitted the walnuts. I increased the cinnamin/nutmeg alittle, and I was out of cloves. To the frosting I added cinnamin, and I used less milk/cream and more powdered sugar, I also added some flour to it because i wanted it alittle thicker consistency. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Great tasting cookie.  Mine turned out a little flat, even though I used 1/2 tsp of powder.  I did change it a bit to make it healthier.  Used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup oat bran.  Soaked the raisons too.  Some of these changes could have resulted in my flat cookie.  Anyway, they were a hit with my kids.

Delicious!  Nice and soft.  The only thing I did different was use butter instead of shortening.

I made three batches of these cookies!!  They were great tasting and fairly easy to make!  The second time around, I didn't chop the apples as fine.  When you bit into the cookie you had the raisins and chunks of apple! Yum!

Very good, I used 2 large granny smith apples coarsley grated, margarine instead of shortening and used whole wheat flour and about 1/2 cup quick oats to make it healthier, the icing is nice but I just did a thin drizzle to keep the sweetness down.

These are delicious! I followed some suggestions of other reviewers & the substitutions I made were: replace shortening with butter, bake at 375 for 9-10 minutes, and used pecans instead of walnuts. I've also tried it with almonds which is delicious. I mainly used my food processor, first to chop the nuts, and then for most of the mixing. I move it to the bowl & mix by hand when it's time to incorporate the 2nd half of the dry ingredients. These were a real crowd pleaser and perfect for the fall season! Thank you so much for a wonderful and easy recipe!

I made the following changes and they came out VERY good. Thick, cakey (in a good way) and delicious! I used 1 cup of chopped prunes instead of raisins. (No one notices when you use them, but prunes are more moist and flavorful in baked goods.) I used only 7 tablespoons of butter in the cookie batter and only 1 cup of packed brown sugar, as they are plenty sweet and moist already. I used 1.5 tablespoons butter in the icing and used 2% milk instead of cream. I omitted the nuts and used 2 cups of diced apples. I dropped the cookies on the baking sheet and chilled them in the freezer for 5 minutes before baking, so I did not have any problem with spreading or flat cookies. I baked them for 13 minutes at 360 degrees and they were perfectly done through without darkened bottoms. I piped the glaze in a spiral shape on the cookies using a ziploc bag with the corner cut off.

Make these cookies! My boyfriend and his friends loved them--they called them "muffin cookies." One of the guys even asked for the recipe!

First, my changes:

Butter instead of shortening.  Always.

It's best to use a good cooking apple, like Bramley or Granny Smith.  I grated a Bramley & squeezed out the excess juice before adding it to the dough because, as previous reviewers suggested, the dough is VERY wet.  I also omitted the milk for this reason.

With those changes, they held their shape beautifully & didn't spread too much.  

My only complaint is that the cookies were a bit bland, even with the glaze.  The spice taste came through nicely, but I wanted a stronger apple taste.

I just made these, and like many reviewers I changed a few things. I used 2 apples, which was about 1 1/4 c. I used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 c. regular flour. Added approx. 1/4 c. oatmeal. Only 1 c. brown sugar and they are plenty sweet. I also used 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 tsp. baking powder. I have yet to glaze them, but wow are they good. I only gave them a four because I changed the recipe so much I don't know who they would turn out otherwise. But they smell delicious baking and are light and moist.

A very ssweet/spicy cookie that will be perfect for holiday get togethers!  I left out the walnuts and thought they were just perfect with the apples and raisins.  I took another reviewer's advice and put the icing in a baggie and applied it in a spiral pattern.  The cookies are VERY sweet, I can't imagine covering the whole tops with icing!

I have to admit, I wasn't sure eighteen 6 and 7 year-olds were going to eat a cookie w/ apples and raisins!  

I made these for my son's 1st grade class and not one child passed them up.  They were gone quickly and everyone asked for seconds.  

Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

I love these cookies.  They are very soft and moist and I'm always in favor of making treats for my kids with healthy ingredients.  I hate shortening, so I substituted an equal amount of butter and it worked out great.  A new fall favorite!

This recipe makes lovely soft cookies.I had already peeled and cored 2 apples and grated they made 2 cups, so I decided to use the extra  apple. Cookies still baked up nicely. I glazed them as per the recipe but wished I had not as they are great the way the came out of the oven. The glaze makes them too sweet for my tastes. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made these cookies yesterday and they ARE delicious. The only substitutes I made were using a heart healthy margarine instead of shortening and butter, skim milk instead of milk and cream and I used chopped pecans because that is what I had on hand. Will be a new favorite in this house!

a real winner - easy enough to make, and it's a treat to have fresh fruit in a cookie. icing is super-sweet, so you might consider saving a few without frosting, for those less inclined to sugary things.

These cookies are Sooo good...I used butter instead of butter and did put them in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before baking them so they would not spread too much. They are so light..If you want a taste of autumn, you need to make these cookies...You owe it to yourself to try them! Thanks for a wonderful recipe..Next time I would drizzle the frosting over the top of the cookies to make it less sweet...

I always try to follow the recipe exactly the first time around. But I ran out of all-purpose flour, so I had to substitute whole wheat white flour.  The recipe was delicious!  The first batch came out really dark on the bottom, even though I had them on the top rack, so I took other reviewer's advice and turned the oven down to 350 degrees for the remainder.

The frosting was delicious.  I put it in a freezer bag and cut the corner and drizzled it on the cookies.  I did feel like there was enough glaze.  Then, I happened to have some leftover homemade caramel sauce, so I drizzled that on, too!  These were over the top delicious and our guests went crazy for them!  This recipe is absolutely a keeper!

I had to modify the recipe due to a lack of ingredients but they turned out amazing! I did not have brown sugar so I used white sugar with 2tbsp molasses. I also replaced the nuts for a handful of chocolate chips. I also used frozen apples slices and squeezed the water out. The slices did have the peel on but it did not change the cookies. I baked them at 350 for 13min and they are Devine!

Followed recipe except did not use raisins and increased apples to 1.5 cups. These were Excellent! A couple of notes: If you ice the cookies immediately after they come out of the oven, you will have just enough icing; however, if you wait and ice the cookies after they cool, you might want to double the icing. Icing immediately after they come out of the oven is best because (1) the cookies are so soft they would be hard to frost if cooled (2) a little icing goes a long way, and (3) the melted icing almost spreads itself. Check the cookies after 8 minutes and then again at 9 minutes. At 400 degrees, they baked quickly. I will definitely make these again but will read the other reviewer's comments and see if anyone mentioned making changes so the cookies were not so much like a cake. They were EXCELLENT, but if left a room temperature, they were a little too soft...but I maybe the extra apples caused this ....?

Used butter in place of shortening and 1/2 tsp each baking soda & powder instead of 1 tsp soda. Extra apples which I chopped in food processor and left out the walnuts.  Piped the icing over top.  These were cake-like and did have good flavor but just not outstanding.  We did end up finishing them all which shows me that they are definitely good but with al the outstanding cookies out there I'm just not sure these are worth making again.  If someone really just like apple cake-y type cookies then maybe.  I added up all numbers at the end and I got a total of 44 cookies for 3 WW points each.

After reading the other reviews, I substituted butter for the shortening and baked at 375 for 10 - 11 minutes.  I also waited to glaze until the cookie had cooled a bit.  I think they are good and they passed the Hubby test!  I said I'd make them again and he said he'd eat them again!

Delicious cookies that were a huge hit!  I found that the "Vidalia Chop Wizard" did a great job dicing the apples - I hated to grate them as some did, as I thought they would disappear.  I will make these often.

WOW!  I made these for my Fourth of July BBQ and they were a huge hit.  In fact, a guest who took some home sent me a text the next day that read "I am having a love affair with these cookies".  Very easy.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe and they were perfect.  They will definitely be on my list of things to bring to a pot luck or as a hostess gift as they are visually impressive and the taste backs it up.  Enjoy!

This recipe yielded 50 delicious cookies!  I didn't add the walnuts.  For the 1 cup apples, I chopped 1 apple, and used unsweetened apple sauce to make the remainder of the cup.  I baked them at 380 degrees for about 8 1/2 minutes.  They disappeared quickly!

WOW!   This recipe just made it into my own "Book of Awesome".   Leaving out the nuts and raisins was my only change to this recipe.   Otherwise I followed it exactly.    Funny how many reviewers describe them cake-like and others said they were flat.   Mine were flat and spread out very thin on the sheet.  I will add a touch more flour next time and maybe bake them a couple minutes longer.   When I opened the oven after 10 minutes, I panicked at the dark color and yanked them out.   It wasn't that the cookies were over browning, the spices just make for a darker cookie.   So test them carefully because mine were definitely not done at 10 minutes.    Don't skip the glaze.   Just the thinnest layer melted on the still warm cookies is perfect.   These cookies remind me of apple fritters only in bite size portions.   SUPERB!   Even better refrigerated.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. Although they are pretty tasty, I ended up scraping the first batch of burnt cookies off the tray. I kept the oven at 400 for the second batch but cut the baking time by 2 minutes. They are really sensitive cookies!

Absolutely LOVED these cookies. My family isn't big on raisins and nuts, so I doubled the apples to about 2 cups (3 medium sized apples) and they turned out great. I also left a few unglazed and I actually preferred them that way.

These are DELICIOUS! I had no problem with them being flat or difficult to transport! They are so moist and the icing is the perfect finishing touch! The only thing I did different was omitt the walnuts and raisins since my family doesn't care for them. I doubled the diced apple to make up for the missing raisins. Next time I plan to double the whole recipe because they went so fast!

Delicious. You could pour this into a shallow sheet pan and serve it as cake squares. I shredded the apples and soaked the raisins in apple juice i boiled with a splash of Rum. 
I only used 1 cup of turbinado sugar and still think it's too sweet. I DID not add the extra 1/4 milk bc soaking the raisins made it super moist. Also, I don't have shortening so used a stick of butter instead. Baked at 375. My oven at 400 would be way too hot. 

Very good.

I would have written to praise this wonderful cookie but, I was too busy baking additional batches. The office staff couldn't get enough. Only change (for the holidays) was use eggnog in the icing. A delicious addition.

I made these for a different Thanksgiving dessert and I tell you...everyone ignored all other desserts and left with baggies full of these cookies. They are SO fantastic! They do have a fluffy consistency..definately not a hard cookie which is fabulous in my book! These are wonderful!

These are quite good. I found them to a bit too sweet. I am going to cut back on the amount of glaze I use on top of the cookie next time. I think only a small squiggle of glaze squeezed out from the end of a pastry (or zip bag) would be adequate. I had other people try them too, they agreed they were a tad too sweet. Also I think Granny Smith apples work great in these! All in all...a nice spicy cookie w/ tons of flavor!

These were so amazing! I'm not a huge fan of baked apples but these cookies cured that! I made a few changes that were suggested by others. I grated 2 medium apples, used milk instead of half & half for the glaze and added cinnamon to the glaze. Half of the batch I left out the nuts and raisins and the other half I added walnuts. I baked them at 375 for 7-9 minutes then let them cool before I iced them. I took one reviewers advice about freezing the glaze for 15 minutes and my oh my did that works slick! I will be making these cookies very often!

I wouldn't bother.  These were ONLY good for about three hours out of the oven.  After they cooled, I plated them to bring to a party and covere loosely with plastic wrap.  A few hours later they were mush and not edible.

Amazing! I changed it up a bit; sub'd butter for shortening, shredded the apple, cut baking soda in 1/2 & added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder, omitted the clove, walnuts & raisins (don't care for those items in cookies) & added1/2 cup cinnamon chips. I also up'd the temp to 375 and baked for 8 minutes.
These are great! super moist, and have a fabulous fall taste. Thanks you so much for the recipes, it's a keeper!

I needed to bake cookies for a funeral and had apples to use, so I chose this recipe.  After reading a few other reviews, I lowered the baking temp to 375 (400 seemed high to me too), and did a shortening/butter combo.  I was really impressed with the intensity of the flavors as these came out of the oven, and as they needed to be packed and sent for the funeral, I opted to not glaze at all.  This is a great "apple season" recipe that I will make again when our family can enjoy the whole batch!

The taste is delicious. Very yummy, not overly spicy, not overly sweet. They are super soft and moist. I didn't use nuts, I tossed in dried cranberries and cinnamon chips. I think the cinnamon chips are a huge factor in their yummy taste!! My only problem was that they went quite flat and didn't hold shape very well, they fall apart really easily. I just now read advice to make teaspoon sized cookies, mine were tablespoon-plus -- maybe that would've helped. Refrigerating the dough in between also helped my later batches.

I know it's not really apple season right now, but I was in the mood for some cinnamon and spice, and I love pretty much anything with apples in it.  These did not disappoint.  I used a combination of fuji and granny smith because that is what I had.  The glaze is a must.   It takes these cookies to the next level with that buttery vanilla flavor.  Great cookie and a recipe that I will keep on hand when I have so many apples to use up this fall.

These cookies were amazing!  The apple I chose made well over 1 cup when diced, so I just added all the apple (including skin) and skipped the raisins.  I undercooked them by a minute or two which made the cookies extra soft and moist...almost like a muffin!  I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose.  Also, I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the icing (which was to-die-for).  My house smelled great for hours!  I will definitely be making these again!

These cookies are SO GOOD!!  I used white whole wheat flour & left out the nuts.  The cookies would be great without the glaze if you wanted to cut some sugar but after trying a cookie before I glazed them & then another after, the glaze really made the cookies!  AWESOME recipe!  I am taking some to family tonight.

I made these for my daughter's class apple tasting event. I left out the nuts and used butter (I avoid working with shortening if I can). I shredded the apples so I could squeeze the ever living daylights out of them so the dough didn't end up too watery. I don't know what size cookies these are supposed to be that it only makes 18, but I got 3 normal sized cookies short of 5 dozen. They're good. Definately sweet enough without the icing.

I didn't change a thing other than not having icing sugar on hand, so I skipped the icing.  They were great and "tasted just like fall".  They kept a long time in a sealed container as well.

I made these cookies for a Thanksgiving potluck at my daughter's school. They were all eaten and the kids loved them. I did not put the glaze on and it was not missed.

de-lish-ous! i, too, swapped out the shortening for softened butter & omitted the frosting! fabulous cookies but don't be fooled that they're healthy just because they contain apples; there is more sugar than apples in this recipe!  i would make them again!

As written, these cookies are excellent....With tweaks they're even better! As a shameless junk food junkie, I left out the walnuts and raisins and added in butterscotch chips. They were terrific! I took the advice of other reviewers and grated the apples instead of chopping them. Be careful not to make the cookies too big, or they'll collapse and get really flat. And the glaze is kind of over-the-top sweet even for me, so I usually thin it a little and drizzle it on instead of spreading a full layer on top. These cookies are a hit every time I make them, and they stay good and moist for a long time, too.

These were delicious, although it was not quite what I was looking for in an apple cookie. Still, I brought them to a friend's house and they disappeared! They have just the right amount of spice. Remember to chop the apples VERY finely, even chunks will stick out unattractively.

I use tons of recipes off this site.  I actually take the time to review only a select few that I think are just downright fantastic.  This one is.  It is right up there with Aunt Teen's Creamy Fudge and Grandma Ople's Apple pie.  A fantastic and different cookie that is soft in the center and crunchy on the edges. Scrumptious.  I omitted the raisins and nuts and added an extra cup of apples. Also, used whole wheat flour for 1/3 of what the recipe called for and tossed in some ground flax.  Just tweaks for personal preference.  Great recipe.  Thank you.

Made a few changes due to what I had or didn't have on hand.  Used 1 cup apple sauce as too lazy to cut, peel, and whatever the apples. Didn't have cloves so used pumpkin pie spice 1 1/2 t.in place of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Threw in a small pkg. of sliced almonds.  For half and half used caramel apple coffee creamer.  

YUM!!! These were delicious.  Raisins would have made them that much better but was out.  Wonderfully soft cookies.

These cookies did not last long in my house!  I cooked two batches, one at 400 degrees and the other at 350 degrees.  The 350 degree cookies came out much softer and chewier (my preference).  I just drizzled the glaze in a pretty pattern over the cookies rather than drop a big spoonful on them.  They will be made again!  Soon!

Great recipe! I forgot to add the milk the first time that I made these, but they turned out great, so now I leave it out on purpose. I have also made these substituting half of the butter with applesauce, and you could barely tell the difference...but they were a little healthier that way!

These were very yummy, and made healthier (but just as soft) with whole wheat flour. Lots of compliments, however they were best the same day. (I'm not sure how to store them properly.)  THANKS for a wonderful fall cookie.

I was hoping these would've had more apple flavor.  The only thing I changed was adding vanilla and decreased the temp. to 375.  Also, I alternated the flour with the milk until all were added then mixed in the apples, raisins and nuts.

Really good. As others say, they are more like "mini-cakes" than cookies, but still really good. The glaze doesn't help their calories and fat content... but makes them really special. Ever time I made these cookies they are met with rave reviews because they really are moist and very delicious.

Wow!  I made these following the recipe and they are GREAT!! My husband loved them!  I made the glaze thicker as suggested and used Butter Flavored Crisco---Also omitted the nuts-not a big fan.  I dropped them in heaping tablespoons and baked 6 on a sheet for 10 minutes-let them sit on it for 1 min once out of the oven and then glazed them.  The next time I make these I will do the same however, I am going to add about 1/4-1/2c. Oatmeal...  But - don't get me wrong - these are perfect as they are!  Mmm Mmm Good!!

Delicious! However, these cookies are so moist that they almost fall apart when you pick them up. I might bake them for a few extra minutes the next time. The glaze was so thick, I had to add a few tablespoons of milk. Otherwise, these cookies were fabulous.

This has to be one of the best cookie recipes out there. The texture is very moist, the icing is just enough, and the spices are a wonderful blend that compliments the apples. These store well, and are a great match with cup of coffee. I have a new  fall favorite!

Delicious. Tastes more like a muffin than a cookie but tastes wonderful. Very soft and moist. I used about 1 and half cups of apples, 1 cup didnt seem like enough and we have lots of apples from our trees. The other thing i changed was that i used butter instead of shortening. I dont know why they would want you to use shortening. Butter worked out just fine. These are so delicious i will make them often. Icing was delicious also.

Yummy! A bit cake-like, similar to a denser muffin, but the flavor was great and everyone enjoyed them!

As good as everyone says - be sure not to overcook. Coarsely chopped walnuts worked well for me to add a crunch.

I also forgot to add the milk, used butter instead of shortening (Crisco doesn't exist in Belgium) and only used 2 cups of apples (as I had no nuts or raisons on hand!) but these turned out great! I lowered the oven temp. and drizzled the glaze over them using a plastic bag. They looked so pretty and everyone loved them! The only complaint I has was that I didn't make enough! Thanks for the recipe!

Soooo Good!! I gave them a 4 because I used butter instead of shortening and baked at about 375 10-12 minutes based on other reviews.  The glaze is a little thin but I don't think i let them cool enough so it ran all over.  I will definitely make these again and double or triple the recipe!

I have discovered the mother of all cookie recipes. Eating this cookie is like eating a little slice of apple pie, and the smell they make while cooking - I am swooning. If there ever was the perfect fall cookie, this is it. Little pieces of warm apple, with Cinnamon and nutmeg and warm glaze- OH MY GOSH. They are so easy to make, so pretty and taste like heaven!

Yum!  I used margarine, but next time will use shortening.  Great flavor.  Followed other suggestions and piped a zig-zag of icing on when the cookies were barely warm.  Layered them on sheets of wax paper in an airtight container.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I forgot to add the milk to the batter when I made these cookies, but as much as they spread while baking, I'm glad I didn't.  I'd like to try making muffins or bread out of this recipe.  My cookies totally didn't hold together and had to be eaten with a fork.  I also though that the apples (I shredded them) looked kinda weird in the finished cookies.  Still, they were pretty good, especially with cinnamon added to the frosting.

These cookies are really good.  Next time I'd cut down on the brown sugar though because they seemed a bit too sweet for me.  Also, since the batter is thin compared to some other types of cookie batter, make sure that when you drop tablespoonfuls of batter onto the cookie sheets that the drops have some height to them so that when they cook and flatten out (and they flatten out lots), they aren't too too flat - because the cookies end up cake-like, having them too thin and flat caused them to break apart when I made them.  Besides that, these are great!  I used pecans instead of walnuts and next time, I think I'll add more nuts and apple but less raisins.  I'm tough at rating so that's why I only gave them a 3 - but I think that's more of a personal preference thing. I'd definitely make these for someone into the spicy tastes of autumn. A great alternative to PB and chocolate chip cookies!

I used a Granny Smith apple, butter rather than shortening, & pecans rather than walnuts.  The glaze was a bit runny to be able to store these in a cookie jar, so I added a bit of corn syrup & upped the powdered sugar quite a lot.  These were very good and just what I wanted for my husband who loves this type of cookie.  Thank you so much, Sandy!

These cookies are awesome.  My 9 year old son chopped the apples, dropped them on the baking sheet, and iced them.  This is definitely a keeper!  I wouldn't recommend any changes.

Did everything exactly as written and was absolutely not disappointed.  This is an excellent and somewhat healthier than other cookies receipe for the apples we picked at the orchard.

I actually made this recipe 10 years ago in the county fair and won reserve grand champion.  But I ommitted the cloves and replaced them with more cinnamon and did not add nuts. In the auction I recieved $2,500.00 dollars.  They are amazing and addicting so double the recipe!!!!

they fell apart easily, but they tasted great.  I doubled the apples b/c it seemed silly to have the same amount of rasins and apples and call it apple cookes.  That could've contributed to the easy breakage of them though.  I wasnt able to make the glaze b/c several family members are watching their sugar intake.  However they all really liked the flavor of them.

These cookies were wonderful!  Moist in the middle, just a hint of crisp on the edges, and perfectly spicy!  The icing is also the best I've tasted.  What a treat!  Thank you so much for sharing.

I was looking for a fugi  persimmon  cookie recipe, to no avail.  So I decided to use this apple cookie recipe,  substituuteing  my persimmons for the apples and adding pecans and craisins for raisins.  Absolutely yummy!  My husband says, these are his new favorite cookies! Merry Christmas  everyone!

Nice cookies! I followed some of the suggestions of the top reviewer:  replaced shortening with butter, used 1/2 tsp baking soda & 1/2 tsp baking powder. I added the apples and raisins but not the walnuts. I'm gifting most of these, so you never know about nuts with people. Another time, I'd definitely add them. After they were baked, I realized that I forgot to add the 1/4 cup milk, and they still came out good! I followed the idea of adding cinnamon to the glaze and doing the plastic bag cut-out for piping. The next time I'd just do a thinner glaze. I also lowered the oven temp to 375degF and baked for 8-9 min, per another reviewer. Great fall cookie that I'll surely make again!

I have made these 3 times in the last week, including for a cookie exchange, and they get nothing but rave reviews. My changes are used real butter, no nuts, regular milk, and baked at 375 for 12 mins on AirBake pans. I made simple icing of milk, powdered sugar, and a splash of vanilla and just drizzled over the cooled cookies on the cooling racks. I used one large granny smith apple, which is more than a cup but helps to keep the bulk of the cookie since I didn't use nuts. I also soaked the raisins in hot water for a few minutes while I chopped the apple. I get about 32 cookies from a batch. My son is to the point of guarding these like gold and giving me the side-eye when I give them to anyone. Thank you for an amazing cookie.

My mother made these cookies  every year starting in th 50's or60's.  Not sure where they originated. My sister and I have continued the tradition.  One year we decided to make them with butter instead of Crisco shortening. Never again. There is something about using the shortening makes them taste better. This recipe here is like the one Mom had.  Everyone likes them

3 stars as written. I accidentally forgot the milk on the first batch and I actually thought those cookies were better than the ones with the milk added to the batter. I think next time I would use 2 tablespoons of milk and not a quarter cup. Also thought the baking temp was a little high. I baked at 375 for 10 to 11 minutes. Also thought there was way too much glaze. I only used half and piped it on in swirls. If I would’ve used all of the glaze it would’ve been way too sweet.

Made them with heavy whipping cream instead of milk and added the walnuts for some crunch.  Turned out beautifully.  10/10 will bake again and can testify that they are wonderful with or without the glaze!  Fabulous for fall.

5 stars!  These cookies are reminiscent of the ones my mother used to make us, and she always made the best.  I made a couple of changes based on what other reviewers suggested: 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening, 1/2 baking powder & 1/2 baking soda, added 1/2 t. vanilla, added cinnamon to the icing also.  I love the spicy, appley flavor...they just speak "Fall".  I had to put them into the refrigerator for a few minutes to set the icing.  I will make these cookies again.

I will make this again, especially since the cookie was a big hit with my son - who is not a huge sweets eater.  I used butter instead of shortening, but otherwise, followed the recipe as given.

I followed the advice of the first review and used half a teaspoon of baking powder and half a teaspoon of baking soda. I used half whole wheat flour and added half a cup of oats.  The cookies were soft and delicious.

This cookie puts me in mind of an old fashioned cookie, like Grandma would serve.
Spicy, moist from apples, nuts, and a sweet ending with a frosting. 
I did refrigerate the batter before baking to slightly stiffen. YUM

Incredibly delicious!  Fat, moist, chewy and flavorful.  I planned to ice them with a cream cheese frosting, but they don't need anything.  They are delicious  by them selves.  One of the best new cookie recipes I have tried in quite a while.  I made them for a hurricane "Irma" party this past week end, and everyone raved about them!  Will keep this recipe handy!

I made these exactly as the recipe says, except I didn't add walnuts or pecans. Easy to make and my "official taste-testers" loved them. Only things I would change would be to use less of the confectioners' glaze. A drizzle over each cookie instead of coating the entire cookie is all that it needs. I also think I'll try decreasing the amount of spices. I liked the flavor, but it could be overwhelming. Great recipe, thank you for sharing!

I loved the flavor and chewy consistency. The combination of the apples and the nuts with the spices - I did sub some oatmeal for flour and enjoyed the resulting texture.

I'm not much of a fan of soft cookies--and these are on the far side of the soft cookie spectrum... even with a longer baking time and adding oats, and baking powder and baking soda, they fall apart when you pick them up. It's almost like eating a very moist muffin that comes in a very flat disc--they just never firm up. What a waste.

So, I've made these twice now, and keep running into the same problem. The flavor is amazing, but the texture/consistency is awful. The cookies just fall apart upon being handled. Even ones that are a little burned on the bottom from being left in a little longer still just crumble apart in the center. Trying to figure out how to solve this, because everyone seems to really love the flavor so I don't want to give up on the recipe. I've tried using butter an shortening, with the same result. Might try throwing in an extra egg white next time.....

I made this recipe as written (except no raisins and I subbed maple flavoring for the vanilla in the icing). I read it over and over again to make sure I had it right. The batter ratios didn't seem quite right to me, but I thought that cooking the apple would fix it. It didn't. I found this recipe to be too sweet and very sticky. Too much sugar--or was it caramelizing juice from the apple? The maple was an excellent substitution for the vanilla in this context. I liked the spice, I LOVED the apple and walnut flavors...but the cookie as a whole wasn't very good. Very disappointing recipe. I won't make it again without changes.

Armed with 11 lbs of apples from a day of apple picking with the family... I found myself looking for a recipe that wasn't for apple pie. I happened along this recipe and the cookie lover in me had to try it. I did make this recipe with some of the suggested changes in the reviews. I used butter instead of shortening, half baking powder and half baking soda, 2 cup fresh grated apples and I baked them at 375° for 11 minutes. They were absolutely perfect. The glaze really added the sweetness that was need. This recipe puts everything you love about fall into a delicious cookie. My picky 7 year old loved them!

I do agree that I would call these muffin tops rather than cookies, because that was the consistency.  I coarsely grated some Granny Smith apples and pressed the excess juice out of them.  I also doubled the spices (for the taste of the recipient) and skipped the glaze.  They were well received.

Holy cow, these were so good! The glaze really is the magic handshake that brings out the best in these cookies. Next time I bake these, I'll try a couple of other spices in the glaze that compliments the cookies.

The texture was cakey, but so soft, and it looks like the bottoms were just a little "extra cooked" so I'd advise using a greased baking sheet (like they do in the recipe).

Too much spice, I'd cut back the nutmeg and cloves by at least half.

One of my favorite fall cookies. Amazing flavors and super moist. Everyone who has ever tried them have loved them.

These were very good. My family really liked them.  I used butter and shortening and they spread so next time I will try margarine.  But I will definitely make them again

Not as successful as others.  Used 1/2 cup combined butter/shortening, baked at lower heat.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  They taste good, but, do not look like the picture.  They were lumpy looking.  Very soft to form.  Second batch, I put in fridge for a little while... still soft... added more flour.  They still looked lumpy, not as shown in picture.  Taste OK.

Made this gluten free by using Namaste GF flour blend without any other substitutions, turned out quite well.  As the GF group knows, moist almost always equals chewy; however, this was not the case, though I recommend baking at the longer end and waiting until they cool to eat them.  Also, for those of you have not used a glaze before , it is important to put the frosting on the cookie while warm, a dollop right on top and the heat will melt it right on the cookie.  If you wait to frost the cookies when they are cool then a glaze is not your best option.

Great taste. I was having trouble with the cookies coming out flat, even with the butter baking soda/power switch as other recommend. Chilling the batter and lowering the oven to 375 helped. Convention also seemed to help cook the centers faster.

Baking is relatively new to me.  It's my "therapy" these days.  My new motto is "If you can read, you can cook/bake."  I use this site primarily to choose (mostly cookies) recipes.  These cookies are delicious.  They almost taste like glazed apple hermits. I baked them for 8-9 minutes so that I did not over bake them.  My first batch (at 10 minutes) had blackish bottoms.  Maybe from the greased cookie sheet?  I think that I might use butter instead of shortning next time and maybe I won't grease the cookie sheet.  Anyway, they were delicious!  My boyfriend is my honest critic and gave them 4.5 stars.  I am a bit more critical and rated them 3.5 stars.  I did not use nuts this time, but plan to next time.

I made these GLUTEN and DAIRY-FREE! AND they were AMAZING. I just substituted Arrowhead Mills all-purpose gluten free flour (we find the garbanzo bean taste of the Bob Mills gluten free flour to be distasteful in baked goods),used Lou Ana coconut oil to replace the butter, and Thai brand coconut milk to replace the milk. I did find that I needed a lot more milk than the recipe called for to make it moist enough to mix. With just the 1/4 cup, it was literally still powdery (that may be due to the substitutions?). Also left out the raisins because I didn't have any. I even made the glaze with the coconut oil and Thai coconut milk, and it was GREAT. Can't imagine they could be better with real butter and milk! A note on substituting coconut oil and milk for those of us who are dairy-free: the brand is important. Lou Ana coconut oil and Thai coconut milk do not make your dishes taste like coconut. I have even made Southern style sausage gravy with this milk, and my Texan husband raved that it was better than his mom's! In other words, these did not taste like apple coconut cookies at all. The oil makes baked goods incredibly moist and the milk is thick and rich, and is wonderful to bake with :)

Mmmmm, yummy stuff!  The end result was more muffin or cake-like than cookie, though.  I found it's best to cook them on wax paper to avoid sticking to the pan.  Took these to work and they were very well received.

rated this recipe prematurely.  Still tastes great, but after a couple of hours really sticky and soft.  I have to downgrade this to a 3 star, and it is unliekly I will make it again because of this sogginess factor.

What a wonderful recipe! These cookies are fantastic and a huge hit with everyone I've made them for! The only change I've made has been using margarine instead of shortening because that is what I had at home. I will continue to make these every fall!

These cookies were delicious! I was rushed, so I only chopped up one apple, and used about 1/2 cup of applesauce to compensate. These were a big hit, and I will definitely be making them again! I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on top of the icing, and it made the cookies very pretty, as well as being incredibly delicious!

We always give our cookies to friends but my boyfriend gave me the dirtiest look when i packed a few up to give to my sister.  They were much easier to make than i thought they were going to be and I loved the icing.

I a made these tonight, OMG!!! the flavor is supurb.  I followed another suggestion and used 1/2tsp baking power and 1/2 tsp baking soda also used un-salted butter in place of the shortening.  I used 1/2C raisins and 1/2C nuts instead of the whole, I did grate my apples and squeezed out the extra juice as another had said end result remarkable. For the frosting I thought of cream cheese so I added some creamcheese into the frosting mixture using 1/2% milk and drizzled it on top of the cookies.  You'll never taste a cookie like it!!!!

Great cookie recipe. However,  I didn't get the chance to glaze them.  It seemed my children were eating them as they were coming out of the oven.  The best part is my son who is very picky and usually doesn't like fruit cooked, absolutely loved them.  I followed the recipe as it was written except I baked them at 350 and they turned out great. Next time, I will try the glaze.  Thanks for posting!

These were YUMMY!!! I didn't add any of the nuts & I didn't have the powdered sugar for glaze. I thinned out the store bought icing I had on hand & it worked perfectly. Oh - and I used margarine NOT shortening. My hubby LOVES them!!! He said they have to be the best cookie I have ever made him....Thank you for the recipe!!!!

I used butter instead of shortening, and only 3/4 c sugar (I used rapadura). I also just used a dash each of nutmeg and clove. I skipped the glaze - these were really good!

A batch of these didn't last 2 days for 4 people. I made them as directed written but without frosting. Texture and taste just like muffins.

Used half butter, added tsp. vanilla, used 2 cups apples, cut back a tad on the cloves. No raisins (my grandson has braces and has trouble with them) otherwise, I think they would have been a good addition.  I like this recipe because you could vary it a bit according to taste--maybe add some pumpkin, or change the nut.  We est. the carbs per cookie would be 25 with the additional apples.

These weren't my favorite ever, but I made them for a bake sale and I thought I was going to get mobbed for them people loved them so much.  As a side note, I ran out of shortening and subbed butter - I won't do that again.  Still tasted fine, but the butter made them go flat as crepes and I ended up with one big sheet of cookie that fell apart.

I made these just like it said. The only thing I did different was just a plain glaze with milk and powdered sugar for the drizzle. They were wonderful! I hope they freeze well cause I'm gonna make some more without the icing to freeze. Have lots of apples this year. Thanx for a GREAT recipe!

Very good cookie.  We doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of Paula Red apples.  Really good cookies.  They are so soft and chewy.  We didn't even make the glaze since they don't really need it.  They taste like Christmas in a cookie!

These are great!  I left out the walnuts, and used butter instead of shortening, and I wasn't totally impressed with them fresh, but the next day they were FABULOUS.  Today is day 3, and they rock. Soft and chewy and spicy and totally yum.

Phenomenal!  Cookies are moist and  spicy.  I did change the oven temp to 350 degrees and baked longer,  made only 1/2 of the icing and put in a snack bag, cutting out corner of bag and drizzled icing over in a back and forth pattern.  Next time I'll make smiley faces on them for my special grandsons!  a keeper recipe :)  I can't wait to try them out on my family!

I definitely just fell in love with this cookie!  But I also need to admit the changes I made.
First off, I used a chopped up peach, not an apple.
Added an egg yolk.
Added 1/2 tsp of baking powder.
Added 2 TBS softened butter. (But did use shortening b/c I thought it might give stability).
Added 1/4 cup of oats.
As for glaze...powdered sugar, cinnamon, skim milk (b/c that was all I had), 1/4 tsp of salt, and a pinch of instant espresso powder.  Sounds crazy, but it worked for me.

These are really good.  I used butter (personal preference) and spelt flour to make them healthier.  I didn't add raisins because my family does not like them.  Next time I'll double the apples and chill the dough.  I did not add the glaze either, they were really good with out it.

These were pretty good!  I added a bit more flour 1 tbsp. so that they would not spread quite as much.  I also cooked the raisins in a little water first to reconstitute them and I think that made them nicer in the cookie... a little plump.  Will make them again.

These cookies tastes great! The only thing I would do is wait a little longer to glaze them.  I also used butter instead of shortening and I ran out of brown sugar, so I used 1 cup of brown and 1/3 white sugar. But it was all still good!

i substituted butter for shortening and omitted the nuts- put in 1/2 more cup of apple instead. put the oven on 360 and baked for about 10-12 minutes. turned out pretty well! i put the glaze on some cookies but i prefer them without... i'm not a fan of super sweet stuff myself.

Cake-like and sweet, nice and spicy.  I used butter instead of shortening and baked for 14 minutes at 350F.  I might make more without icing next time, as the cookies are sweet enough without it.

I really wanted to love these cookies. My hubby loves apple desserts so I gave it a try. I mostly followed the recipe but for replacing all milk with apple cider, doubling the apples and adding 1 tsp vanilla. Lots of people said they were muffin-like and I have to agree. But I'm not getting a lot of apple flavor at all.I'm wondering though if the flavor is going to improve as they sit (sort of like banana bread tastes better the next day). Right now though, they're only getting 2 stars. If they taste better tomorrow, I'll update my review. 
*UPDATE* - these cookies definitely got better as they sat. Still not "apple-y" enough, but good. I made another glaze with just powdered sugar and apple cider and think that was better.

I doubled this recipe using the allrecipes calculator and these cookies baked up wonderfully. They are very tasty and moist. My co-workers simply raved and they were gone by lunch time. I highly recommend trying this recipe!

not sure i liked these cookies - they tasted pretty good, but seemed almost to moist and seemed to get "wetter" the longer they sat - not sure what i did wrong. I am glad i tried them but don't think i will put these into regular rotation

Well, I was not sure as this mixed together, but once cooked, WOW!  Very good.  I did sub flaxmeal for 1/2 the butter and used some 10 grain flour instead of all white, baked at 350 for 15min. Before the last sheet was cool I had started another batch!  They are that good.  I did use 2 cups apples and added vanilla.  With the second batch I also added oatmeal.  Very good.  I will make these often in the fall.  Oh, did not use glaze, they were sweet enough without it.

I would have rated them a 3 but my husband says these are the best cookies i have made and wants more! So he would have rated them a 5 so i put 4 stars.  I felt they really stuck together once cooled, i felt like i couldnt put them away because they became a mess.  They did have a great taste.  I didnt have any raisens on hand so i used dried cranberries which turned out great, they were yummy, not my favorite, but obviously my husbands :)

My family absolutely LOVED these cookies!! The cookies remained soft and chewy...just perfect!!! I didn't put the glaze on top since I thought it would distract from the healthy benefits of the cookie.  The cookie was so delicious, the glaze wasn't even needed!

These are heavenly!  I can't believe I've never had them.  They will be made very often from now on.  Added more apples like the one review said and actually left out raisins and walnuts.  Can't say how good they are!

The flavor of these cookies was really good, but they spread out flat and don't stay soft and cake-like. Obviously you can just add additional flour, or maybe cook down the apples some to keep them from watering down the dough? I tossed all of the cookies I made because I won't eat flat cookies but I may try them a second time for someone who likes apples.

OH SO YUMMO!!!  I decreased milk to 1/8 cup, reduced temp. to 350 as suggested by others and baked convection for 7 minutes.  I refrigerated dough before baking for 30 minutes in the hope that the dough wouldn't flatten too much during baking (they didn't).  One of the trays of cookies didn't bake as well, so make sure your cookies are 100% browned on top, makes a big difference in flavor and they hold together well if cooked till browned.

These were very good. The texture was super soft. I brought 2 dozen into my work and they were all gone by the end of my shift! 

I think next time I will swap out the shortening for butter and try 1/2 splenda to make it a bit healthier.

Read this Friday before leaving work and it sounded so easy and good.  I made them Sunday and they were a big hit.  I did do the 2 cups of apples as some suggested. I also added more confection sugar to make a thicker glaze.  One suggestion is glazing while still warm put a piece of parchment paper under the cookie rack to catch the dripping, easy clean up.  Thanks again this one is a keeper.

Aside from using Craisins instead of raisins and baking at 350 for 12 minutes, I baked these cookies as instructed. They are really good. A nice cookie for Fall. My kids loved that they had "frosting."

These cookies are awesome!!!  I was looking for something different to do with the apples that we had picked.  I omitted the walnuts--son has a peanut allergy and the raisins--don't like; and they still were outrageous.  Will be making again real soon.

I made these for my family and they were not impressed with them at all! :o( I wasn't able to try them due to my current diet restrictions, but I ask them to rate them and 2 gave them 3 stars and one 2 stars. I was disappointed. I thought they would be a big hit on a rainy day. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of leaving the nuts out of half the batch. Otherwise, no changes. Thanks anyway!!

I'll be honest... I wasnt expecting these to be that great, but they were FANTASTIC! I added the walnuts and used crasins instead of raisins. I used 1/4c. butter and 1/4c. shortening. I also cooked them at 375 for about 11 minutes. I wrote this recipe on a napkin thinking I wouldnt use it again, but its gettign re-written and going in my recipe book!

My husband LOVES cookies like this.  These are wonderful.  A real "comfort" food.  Kinda "old-fashioned" type cookie.  YUM! YUM!  Will make for gift baskets come Christmas.  Great with hot tea or coffee.  Starts the day off feeling warm and cuddly.

These cookies are terrific!!  I was looking for a good fall cookie recipe and gave these a try for a church dinner.  I heard raves about the recipe and lots of people asked me to share it. 
I think I've found my new favorite cookie!  (I omitted the raisins because I'm not a big raisin fan.)

I made these cookies for a large party... they were a huge hit.  I gave the recipe to 5 different people and I have been asked to make more for a church gathering.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!
