This came out quite good! I made minimal changes. I couldn't find an organic frozen veggie blend at my supermarket, so I threw in some frozen peas and corn and edamame and then I sliced up some baby carrots. I also was short on potatoes (only had three small ones, the equilent of just over one normal-sized potato). I didn't peel my potatoes because that's where all the nutrients are! This is the kind of recipe you can make with what's on hand and it turns out well.I added about an extra 1/8 cup of broth to my dumpling dough and after mixing with the fork I gave up and kneaded with my hands. I've never made dumplings before and don't know if that was wrong, but they came out yummy. I cut the dumplings with tiny cookie cutters in star and flower shapes and the soup came out so pretty! It's nice and thick and stewy. Next time I'll cook it another hour before adding the dumplings (I cooked 4.5 hours, added dumplings, cooked another 1.25 hours) just because I'd like the carrots and potatoes even softer. But no complaints. My toddler is usually a good eater but has been picky lately. She seems to really like this though.

I used fresh carrots, fresh celery, fresh potatoes, pearl onions, diced canned tomatoes, canned sweet potatoes and frozen corn instead of frozen mixed vegetables. I replaced the broth with Lipton onion soup mix and omitted the barley (I hate barley. Grandma always made dumplings when I was around, sorry mom!) The sweet potatoes and pretty dumplings went into the slow cooker for the last hour. The sweet potatoes were there in the cupboard and just happened. Great!

Really like this soup! In addition to the canned tomato, onion, garlic, potatoes and barley, I used 1 bag frozen broccoli, and half a bag each of frozen corn and peas. I also added 3 carrots, 3 stalks of celery, fresh mushrooms, a can of white beans, and 8 cups of chicken broth. I kept the herbs the same. For the dumplings, I used butter instead of shortening and just scooped some broth from the soup to make them. Perfect for cold weather days!

Used less mixed vege, added carrot, bit more garlic and spices, added 200 grams of stewing steak, added one cup of water. The fat from the meat make a high difference. This is my second attempt and I reckon it's better than the first which followed the recipe

This was a nice easy soup. My family liked the dumplings. I didn't have barley so I used quinoa. It came out delicious.

Wasnt bad, but I agree with the gummy feeling/taste review of Carlin A. Wont make again but if you prefer a brothy soup, this is more of a stewy feel.

I modified it a bit, but basic ingredients and liquids the same.  I added some chopped left-over roast beef to make it a meal.  Very good and very easy.

I added about 24 more ounces of veggie broth and one more can of tomatoes. I'll run it on high for several hours and then turn it to low for the last couple of hours. I'll do pasta noodles instead of the dumplings- lack of time. Thanks for the recipe!

We love this soup! I add thin soup noodles instead of dumplings, and cook them separately so they don't soak up all the broth. Wonderful flavor and so easy to prepare! I made it once with tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes (didn't have any), and I've been making it that way ever since. Such a great recipe!!

Basically, I just cleaned out the vegetable drawer instead of the frozen veggies and followed the recipe with the spices. I left out the barley because I didn't have any. I started this around 1 pm so I cooked on high instead of low. I put the dumplings on around 5 pm. Unfortunately, at 7 pm the potatoes still weren't close to being done, along with the rest of the veggies. We finally ate at 10 pm, but it was delicious! I would recommend this recipe but cook time needs to be adjusted maybe?

Smells delicious, so I hope it tastes delicious!!

 I changed up the ingredients quite a bit though, starting with 6 cups of chicken broth instead of veggie. I used all fresh vegetables instead of frozen, which included 3 carrots, 4 celery stalks, 1 big handful of yellow wax beans, 6 mushrooms, half an onion, and 3 non-peeled russet potatoes. I kept the spices the same, and also used a can of diced tomatoes. Topped it off by adding 12 small boneless/skinless chicken thighs.

Time to prep the dumpling ingredients; still have a few hours before the slow cooker is done.
just the waiting game now to see how this turns out! I will re-evaluate there after

My 3 boys loved this soup! I was considering making it without the dumplings but I'm glad I ended up putting them in because it was a hit. The frozen vegetables had carrots, peas and corn, and we added potatoes, onions, garlic and broccoli to the tomatoes and barley. It was perfect :)

I made this without the dumplings as I also just wanted a basic vegetable soup.  This was very good.  I will make again.

I cooked this on high for over 5 hours and the potatoes were still not softened. Also, the barley gave the soup a gummy consistency and we thought the whole thing had a strange sour flavor. Liked the dumplings though! Next time I'll try them in a different soup.

I would not make this again. The flavor was lacking, and the potatoes did not cook. For a crockpot recipe, I expected it to taste yummy. Quite disappointing.

I did not add the barley or dumplings. Too much starch. But what made me give it only three stars was the broth. The spices made it very savory, which I like, but there was something lacking in the undertones. I understand that this soup is vegetarian, but the vegetable broth was just not as robust as I had hoped. Maybe a stronger tomato flavor would help.

I made this soup, it very tasty, but I added some pepper sauce to the mix to spice it up for myself, and I left the dumplings out (this time) and put it over brown rice.  I will try it with dumplings next time.

Excellent soup!! Used beef broth instead of vegetable. Added extra package of mixed vegetables. Used 3 billion cubes instead of salt. The best vegetable soup I ever tasted!! Didn't use barley.
