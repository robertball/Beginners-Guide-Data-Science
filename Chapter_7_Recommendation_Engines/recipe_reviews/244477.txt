What a treat!!  I used one of my frozen bananas, you know the ones when they get too ripe to eat but are perfect to freeze.  Anyway, I used just regular whole milk and still used the 4 ice cubes.  Absolutely perfect.  I was sure I'd have to put a sweetner in it but, alas, it was perfect just as written.  I'll be making this a lot this summer for a perfect "milkshake".

I had a very ripe banana, super sweet and flavorful, and this turned out very well.  Breakfast today, but this would be a great mid-afternoon snack, as well.

I love how simple and delicious this recipe is! My son couldn't get enough. I used whole milk instead of almond milk but that's the only change I made. Can't wait to make it again!

I usually hate when people change the recipe and then rate it Bc technically it's a different recipe but I followed it all exactly (even the amount of ice) but all I had was chocolate almond milk. But it turned out amazing. It has the consistency of an actual drink instead of a thick  smoothie or something (which is what I usually like) but surprisingly like this better.  So if you're a review reader like I am, two thumbs up for this one. Make it. Lol

Yummmmm.  I added almost 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and just a dash of nutmeg to add more flavor.

So refreshing and good. I used 2 tbsp of yogurt as well and a little less milk, like 2/3 cup instead of 3/4, as well as Pumpkin pie seasoning instead of cinnamon. Literally took me less than 5 minutes to make it.

This is a very simple recipe that seems like no recipe is needed. But it inspired me to make a treat for myself and it truly does fill the craving for a high-calorie alternative. It is healthy, couldn't be easier, and anyone can add whatever in the way of natural flavors or fruit. The only change I made was to freeze my banana pieces before blending. Delish and feels so good in hot weather!

Delicious!  I used 1% milk this time, next time I want to try almond milk. It was perfectly smooth and I liked that it wasnâ€™t too thick. I will make this often!

This is good. I used a frozen banana and still used the ice. I liked the cinnamon flavor, but I probably used at least 1/4 teaspoon and about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.

I added spinach and orange juice. It is a good beverage for breakfast, but I would have to add more ingredients to supplement this for a meal. It taste ok.

A very tasty alternative to ice cream.  I used 2% milk and I think it would be good no matter what you use.

This was a very nice drink, and my family loved it. The only thing I didn't like about it though was that it couldn't be refrigerated.

I made this right away. I had some very ripe bananas and thought I would try it. Very easy to make and very delicious. I will make this again. Next time I am going to put some pineapple Juice with it and some more ice.

Yum!! I've made this a couple times now. I added some Turmeric this time. And my dashes of vanilla and cinnamon may have been more than "dashes".
