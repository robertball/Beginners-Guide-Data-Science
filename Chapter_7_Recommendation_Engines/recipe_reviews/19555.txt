This recipe is TERRIFIC! My hubby doesn't like coconut, so I just left it out, this is a wonderful sub for the plain sweet potatoes with marshmallows, we have been using this recipe for years, and would never go back to the plain sweet potatoes. Thanks, CINDY!!!

These were incredible!!  Ever since going to Outback and having the mashed sweet potatos that taste almost like a dessert, I've wanted to re-create them at home.  This was every bit as good!!  I doubled the vanilla, and added a little extra sugar because I had more than 3 cups of sweet potatoes.  My kids had 3 helpings!!!  The crunchy toasted coconut topping was simply wonderful.

I have made this recipe a few times and everytime I do my brother that HATES sweet potatoes says it's the best sweet potatoes he's ever had! I have added a little bit of cinnamon to this as well. I always make more than 3 cups of mashed sweet potatoes too and keep everything else the same.

Sweet Potatoes never had it so good.  This tops any of the marshmallow varieties! However, without the marshmallows no one realized it was a s.p. casserole.
There is a terrible downside to this dish.  I made for a large dinner but had to use two pans.  One went to our found family Thanksgiving in town.  The other traveled approx. 500 miles to the inlaws TG dinner.  I have been informed that this dish must attend all family dinners in the future. 
Never ever take this comfort casserole outside your comfort zone.

Really good. I like that it is not too sweet but still very tasty. I made one version with the coconut topping and one with marshmallows since my husband requested it.

Served this at Thanksgiving and it was the new family favorite.  I didn't have any coconut, so substituted finely chopped walnuts because it is what I had on hand.  I personally would have liked it to be not quite so sweet, but I was alone on that !

This is idential to my recipe that I've been usingi since 1986.  Those who don't care for sweet potatoes like this dish.  In addition to the coconut I add 1/2 cup crushed pecans for the topping.

I love sweet potatoes but my family does not. I still insist on serving them though. I made this recipe instead of my usual one. It tasted the same as what I normally serve but something about the presentation - my family ate it! Now I have to make and bring the sweet potatoes to Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners!

This is the best Sweet Potato Casserole I've made! I used a 40 oz. (2 lb) can of sweet potatoes (drained) and this couldn't have been simpler!!!  I will also use this as a dessert for any time of the year!  Thanks for the FANTASTIC, EASY, and QUICK recipe!!!

Oh, my word! This was so good! I would have given the recipe five stars had I not had to tweak it somewhat. I felt it would have been too bland as written, so I added 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg, a pinch of salt, and about 1/4 C. vanilla yogurt with 1/4 C half and half instead of the milk. Also, I buttered the casserole dish and sprinkled it with raw sugar before pouring in the potatoes. In addition, I used only one egg since I had only 2 cups sweet potatoes. The baking time stayed the same.

The topping is what stands out here--inspired! This dish will be a permanent part of the rotation now as hubby loves sweet potatoes.

I like my sweet potato casserole a little sweeter so I had to add some additional brown sugar, as well as, some cinnamon and marshmallows.  Pecans also make it a little bit better.

I have tried many sweet potato recipes but this will be my one and only from now on.  The coconut makes all the difference!  I did cut back on the brown sugar.

Very excellent!! I like the usual marshmallow candied yams, but this is a fantastic alternative. I was hesitant about using the coconut, but it came out great. This was the hit at Christmas dinner with friends, everyone was raving about it, they all wanted the recipe.
