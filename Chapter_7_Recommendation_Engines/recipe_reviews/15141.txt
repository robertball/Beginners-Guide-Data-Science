This dip is always gone when I make it! I do change a few things though. You MUST drain and rinse the artichoke hearts,it gets rid of that slightly odd flavor. I also use the whole block of cream cheese. Instead of romano cheese I use about a cup of mozzarella and about half a cup of grated parm. cheese on top. I love garlic so i usually add about a teaspoon of minced garlic. Throw the artichokes, cream cheese and spinach in the blender to make it less lumpy. I serve this with chips or with carrot and celery sticks. Enjoy!

I will be honest, I haven't made this *exact* recipe but I make one that's very close so I thought I'd share my suggestions. I use equal parts mayo (light is fine) and sour cream, no cream cheese. Also, a little fresh lemon juice and some extra garlic help give it some flavor. And finally...I think for any restaurant-quality spinach artichoke dip, monterrey jack cheese is a MUST! I use about 1 cup - half mixed into the dip and the other half baked on top (cover with foil while baking to prevent rubbery cheese). Oh, and I always serve with blue corn tortilla chips and a side of salsa and sour cream. All in all, this is a great and easy recipe to have on hand!

I made this two nights ago and it was AWESOME!!! I did tweak it a bit: I used 1 cup sour cream, 1 whole package cream cheese, 1/2 cup Romano cheese and 1 full tsp. garlic. It was very creamy this way, just the way I like it. My bro and his GF gobbled it up. They said it was just like eating it at a restaurant.

Very disappointed. I can't believe this didn't turn out good with all the rave reviews it has.  I followed the recipe to a tee and it still turned out horrible.  It was very dry & hard - we were trying to use it for a dip for chips.  The chips broke off in it.  Maybe it is more meant for breads, but we were expecting a creamy dip for chips (like in nice restaurants).  Instead we ended up with a hard spread-type dish.  We will not be trying this again unless we come up with a way to make it creamy.  Sorry!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe, I'm so happy I've found it.  There are so many things you can add to it depending on what you like too.  Everytime I make it with a few extra ingredients and it's always delicious.  
You can also throw it on a pizza dough and bake it up for a great spinach artichoke pizza.

Excellent party food!  I doubled everything (to use up all the spinach) except for the artichoke hearts (only had 2- 6oz. jars)and cream cheese (I used the whole 8 oz. block), and used grated Parmesean (from a bag, not the can).  I also threw in about 1/2 c. grated Monterrey Jack cheese.  I had to bake it longer--around 40 min.  I also used a stoneware baking dish.

This recipe was okay... I think the problem was that I expected it to taste like the appetizer from TJI Friday's and it didn't.  It lacked something and was too creamy.  I think it had too much sour cream and not enough romano or even monterey jack cheese.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and served it right out of the oven.  I thought it tasted best hot and when it cooled down it actually didn't taste too good.  I served this dip at a party and had a ton of leftovers, so it didn't go over too well with my guests... I'm going to keep on looking for that TJI Friday's look alike!

I love, love, LOVE this dip! I'd searched everywhere for a recipe for Spinach & Artichoke dip that was close to restaurant style, and this is the best so far! I made a huge batch for a small get together I was hosting (a whole 9x13 in pan!) and it was GONE in no time flat!

I did make one big change to the recipe; I cut out the Romano cheese, and added about 1- 1.5 cups of Monterey Jack instead, because I really wanted this dip to have that cheesy texture, and the Monterey Jack is mild enough and has enough moisture to be, in my opinion, the perfect 'dip' addition.

I also took the liberty of adding a bit more garlic, but that's a personal preference. 

Great recipe- thanks!

Delicious and easy with just the right quantity of ingredients.  I make this dip but before cooking it, I slather it onto a refrigerated pizza crust, (rectangular), snip a fringe up ech side and then crisscross the ends over the center.  Bake at 375 for 30minutes.  It comes out looking like a very complicated braided stuffed bread roll, and of course, it's much easier to handle as an appetizer since you just cut a slice and the dip is already inside.  Thanks for the great filling recipe!

I enjoyed this dip very much.  Not a huge hit at my party, but overall well liked.  I added extra cream cheese as some of the other reveiws suggested.  I didn't care for it with the extra cream cheese.  Good as is!

Eh, it was okay.  I followed the recipe to the T, and it didn't have tons of flavor.  It wasn't awful, but really just seemed to be missing something.  It came out very bland. If i try to make this again I will add way more cheese, and maybe some Parmesan cheese as well.

I've been enjoying this recipe for a few months now and decided to take it a step further...I took a Boboli pizza shell and topped it with shredded mozzarella, then I spread 1/2 the baked dip over the cheese.  Then I placed sliced roma tomatoes on top and baked according to the directions on the Boboli package.  I sprinkled the pizza with a little romano cheese and served.  It was out of this world!  A truly gourmet pizza using this wonderful dip.

Wow this was great! My only complaint is that the recipe states that it serves 24 and it barely served 15!  Next time I'll at least double it.

Delish! I did use the whole box of frozen spinach which I think made this dip more dry. Next time I think I will double the cream cheese, sour cream and mayo for a creamier dip...or just cut back on the spinach they way the recipe intended. I also used marinated artichoke hearts, drained, for that extra tang.. I am also going to add shredded mozzarella next time. Served with blue tortilla chips....this dip was gone. Excellent flavor!

I don't know . . . I made this last week. It wasn't very good. I doubled the vegetables because I wanted it really spinachy. Maybe that was too much. It also just tasted too pickley for me - because of the canned artichoke hearts. I didn't like it very much.

Substituted fat free for the mayo, sour cream, cream cheese but not the romano cheese.  Used the real thing freshly grated at my favorite deli.  So worth the splurge.  Used a little extra and sprinkled on top so it browned and had a little stronger cheese flavor.  Great recipe...

I have made this dish for years. I substitute cream cheese for the mayo and it is much richer. I also add dry vegetable soup mix. I have even use broccoli for spinach and cheddar cheese for the italian cheese mix. Delicious!

This is yummy.  I've made it as is but usually I modified it a little.  I put the artichoke hearts in the food processor, a couple of jalepeno slices, and add a couple tsp of garlic in with it. I don't use mayo since I don't like how it tastes.  I use an entire 10 oz package of spinach, entire box of fat free cream cheese, 2 heaping TB of light sour cream, fat free mozarella cheese.  I make sure to rinse the artichoke hearts and wring out the spinach to get the moisture out. Really important to bake COVERED this is how it stays creamy and doesnt dry out like others have complained about.

This was fast and easy.  Bell peppers made it pretty.  I added mozz cheese and pumped up the garlic to two cloves.  Cut a whole in a bread bowl and it had a beautiful presentation.

This recipe is SO good! It really does take like a restaurant-version of this dip. The only thing is that the recipe doesn't make much. I actually tripled the recipe to get the right amount. I think the key is in the romano cheese--buy the expensive stuff!

This was a hit! Here are my changes... I kept the same amount of spinach and artichokes, but doubled everything else. It made a lot more dip and was creamy like we like it. I think next time I will back down on the mayo as that was one of the main things I tasted during my first bite. Otherwise- it was GREAT!! (Even better the next day.)

This was amazing!  Since this was for a party, I doubled the recipe, only leaving out the extra 1/4 cup mayonnaise.  The guests just raved about it and we couldn't stop eating it!  Fantastic served with pitas cut into little triangles as well as nacho/tortilla chips.  One guest commented that it would also be great with leeks, which I might try next time, just to be adventurous.

This dip was absolutely delicious after a few minor alterations.  I added 3/4 cup cream cheese instead of 1/4 cup and doubled the amount of Romano cheese.  Tasted just like a "Cheesecake" restaurant's dip!

I made this recipe twice this holiday season - it was great.  I added a little more cream cheese (4 oz total) and about 2/3 of the package of frozen spinach.  The dip was great topped with Monterey Jack cheese.

Having the cream cheese, sour cream, and mayo together really made this! I doubled the recipe as others did, so as to use the full spinach package. Turned out to be very good-will use again!

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and friends always ask for the recipe.  The only change I made was using creamed spinach instead of regular.  However only certain stores carry it.  Also, be sure to drain the spinach & artichoke hearts before using.

Served this for an appetizer party.  The guests said it was good, but no one asked for the recipe.  I did was some other reviewers said and put everything into the food processor.  I thought the consistency was good (not stringy like some dips can get) but it was very "artichokey"... If  I used this recipe again I'll probably use more spinach.  I served it hot with bread, which I'd do again.

I took this to a potluck dinner party and it disappeared.  I did add 1-2 ozs more cream cheese & served with scoop tortilla chips. I used lowfat sour cream, lowfat mayo and 1/3 fat cream cheese--every bite was eaten! I will definitely make this again and will likely double it next time. Thanks for sharing this healthy and tasty hors d'oeuvre.

This was my least favorite recipe for Artichoke Dip.  To me, it lacked the substance and flavors of the traditional Artichoke dip.  What I ended up with was something like Knorrs Vegetable Spinach Dip (which I love) without the Knorrs Seasoning (blah).  Just Spinach and Artichoke floating in sour cream and mayo.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I followed some of the suggestions. I used a whole block of 1/3 Light Cream Cheese, used Marinated Artichoke Hearts, and also topped it with Mozzarella.  It turned out excellent.

This was fabulous.  I am one of the health freaks so I used ff sour cream, ff mayo, light cream cheese spread (in tub) and parmesan plus instead of romano and the flavor was marvelous.  I read one of the reviews that said that the flavors meld better if you wait to eat it, so I let it cool then reheated and it was awesome.  FYI - I noticed was that it didn't bubble, I believe that is due to the limited fat content. Also, I took some, spread it on a baguette, topped it with just a smidgen of mozzarella and toasted it.....to die for!

This is my favorite spinach artichoke dip recipe out there!! I add salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and extra garlic, and substitute the romano cheese for parmesan, and it comes out absolutely irresistible. I've found that when doubling the recipe, you can use the same amount of artichoke as the single recipe without compromising the flavor at all (just in case you didn't prepare well, like me!)
I'd recommend this to everyone. It's definitely a hit with family and friends on Thanksgiving!!

This is a really great easy breezy party dip.  I always double the recipe.  I do use light mayo and sour cream.  I also change the cream cheese to neuchatel to save a few fat calories.  Noone can eat just one serving of this.  I also bake uncovered with some extra romano or parmesan cheese on top, I like a bit of crunch on top.  Crowd pleaser!

This is SO good. I use a whole package of cream cheese, 1cup of sour cream, 1/3cup of mayo & an Italian blend shredded cheese. I use about 3/4cup of cheese in the dip & sprinkle the rest on top. We dip tortilla chips or multigrain Townhouse Toppers in it!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, as I brought several dishes to a friend's house for dinner. This is pretty amazing! I doubled the recipe, but only used about 3/4 of the artichoke and the spinach, as I like it to be a bit cheesier. Definitely drain the spinach, a LOT before adding it. I had read someone else's review, and was prepared--I had to press it between paper towels at least 5 times. I added tons more cheese--About twice as much Romano, along with about a handful of Mozzarella. Delicious!   I baked mine in a casserole dish (I would say probably about 45-50 minutes (remember, I doubled it), and about the last 4 minutes or so, I turned it on broil, so the top would brown. I LOVED! I served with fresh bread as well as crackers.   I will say, once it's cooled down a bit, it is a bit difficult to spread. I had to re-heat it several times. But yeah, I will definitely be making this again, probably in smaller portions, just for myself!

This dip was a HUGE hit when I made it this past weekend for the 4th of July.  I did make some changes though - I used an entire block of cream cheese, and I pulverized the artichokes to make the dip a little less chunky (the spinach maintains the texture).  Also I sprinkled a layer of additional romano cheese on top and baked uncovered for 25 minutes, giving the dip this golden brown cheesy crust.  The dip was literally gobbled up in about 40 minutes!  It was so delicious that I actually made another batch when I got home, divided it into smaller portions and froze it, so I can make some for a snack as needed.  Yum!

I followed some previous reviewers, and used 8oz of cream cheese and 8 oz of sour cream (no mayo)....i added some mozz cheeses, and used Parm. instead of Rom.   Very very good. Everyone loved it at our get together. Will save and make again..... (also i cooked mine longer because i had made it earlier in the day)

So yummy!  I made this as written and at first thought there wouldn't be enough but it was just right for 8 adults.  Everyone loved it and I served it with white corn tortilla chips.  For the last 5 minutes in the oven, I uncovered the dish, sprinkled monterey jack/cheddar blend over the top and let it get bubbly.  Just perfect!

Thanks for the great recipe!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used the blender to mix the artichokes, spinach, and cream cheese-nice tip. I also increased the garlic and added about 1 T. of lemon juice. i used pepper jack as the only kind of cheese. This was wonderful- I will be making this again!!

This recipe was great. I used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano and added about a cup of mozzerella cheese. (We like cheese!!). It turned out to be a big hit at my party.

This was good, but not amazing.  It was definitely lacking zing.  I think I will make this again because it has potential, but I'll add a LOT more garlic, some scallions, more cheese, and perhaps some herbs?  Also...although this was nice and creamy when it was hot, it turned crumbly and dry when cool.

Simple recipe. Flavor was good. Required a bit more time in the oven than the recipe calls for (10-15 min).  Recipe would benefit greatly from more cheese. Lots more cheese.

SO GOOD, so quick and easy! I make this all the time with all the low fat ingredients and it makes no difference in taste. My family and friends love it. Served with any type of cracker, bread or  even veggies. I make a meal out of this on those days when you don't want a lot for dinner.

The first time I made this, I followed the directions exactly and ended up with little chunks of cream cheese throughout. The second time, I thawed the cream cheese, melted it a bit in the microwave, and then used an electric mixer to combine it with the mayo and sour cream. No chunks this time, and everything blended together much better.  Tasted okay, but not quite what I wanted.

This was very good.  Next time I will take the advice of others though and add additional cream cheese.  It's very thick otherwise -- not bad, but I think it would be better if it was a bit creamier.  Great flavor though and very easy to make.

Always a hit- with a few adjustments.  To make it a bit more creamy I add another 1/4 of a cup of cream cheese and an extra 1/4 of a cup of sour cream. I also add 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and ½ a teaspoon of salt to give it a little kick. Everyone always wants the recipe!

This is a great recipe. I followed it exactly, but I probably used more garlic than 1/4 tsp. I used 2 small cloves. Next time I will add more cheese (maybe 1/2 cup of Romano plus something else... maybe jack.) I made this for 7 people watching football and it was gone in 15 minutes!

I've made this on many occasions now, and this is always popular and finished off quickly.  I up the cream cheese to an 8oz brick, and use a 9oz bag of fresh baby spinach leaves, microwaved and cut up coarsely with scissors.  I've also added roasted red peppers, a little more garlic, some coarsely ground pepper, and I prefer to use marinated and seasoned artichokes.  The jack cheese is nice, but you won't miss it. I use a mini crockpot pot, and in a few hours it's hot and bubbly.  Just be sure to stir it well every hour or so.  It's great with blue corn tortilla chips.

I loved the recipe, however made a few changes. I bought and used an entire 8 oz. brick of cream cheese, used a full cup of sour cream and instead of the romano cheese, I used a full cup of a combination of coursely grated romano, parmesan and asiago cheeses. I put all the ingredients into my food processor and whirl until chopped and blended. I like the consistency of the mixture when put into the food processor. Everyone loves this recipe and I am asked to make it for almost every occasion!

WOW! This is not only the best spinach dip ever, this is THE best dip ever, period! I could not help but swoon over this one! I made it for an appetizer and we ended up eating the whole thing instead of dinner! It was so good I literally finished eating it and made another one with the rest of the spinach! It was my father-in-laws birthday that day, so we took it over to thier house! I got lots of crazy looks, because they don't like artichokes, but after ONE taste they were sold! They at the entire thing too! (This was only two people eating it!) I was immediately given a recipe card to write the recipe down! I credited this AMAZING site. I used light sour cream, light cream cheese and light mayo. Make sure that the artichokes are FINELY chopped, this makes it a more creamy smooth dip.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I've brought it to a couple of get togethers and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  Be careful not to cook it too long or it tends to get dry.

This is a warm and fuzzy recipe for winter parties.  I ommitted the cream cheese, increased the amount of sour cream and added dried vegetable soup mix for flavour.  You can use any type of cheese as long as there's lots of it. I used parmesan and cheddar b/c that's what I had in the house. It's a fool-proof recipe!

I recently made the low fat version of this recipe for my Christmas party, and it was so good. I used low fat mayo, fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream. I also could not find Romano cheese so I used Krafts Romano, Parmesan and Asiago grated cheese that you buy in the shaker. Guest raved about it! I baked it in the oven as indicated and then placed it in a small crockpot at the buffet to stay warm. For the small crockpot, I had to make twice as much to fill the pot.

The final product was dry and not that flavorful.  I actually followed the recommendation of the "most helpful review" and added a full block of cream cheese and more garlic.  I won't be trying this again.

I made two mistakes and I want to tell you what they were.  I really didn't drain the spinach as well as I could / should have....trying to hurry.  Number Two.....I tried to cheat on the oven time by using the microwave.  It still came out great.

After reading many, many reviews...I made these adjustments: In a food processor add one block of cream cheese, 1/2c sour cream, 1/4c mayo, 1c mozzarella cheese, 1/4c parmesan cheese, 1T minced garlic, 1t garlic salt, half a package of frozen spinach (thawed and drained), and 1 14oz can of artichoke hearts (rinsed). Blend an cook for 25 minutes. Delicious!

This was awesome!  I swapped out the Romano for 1 cup of shredded white cheddar, and I used a whole bag of spinach.  I left uncovered while baking to get a little brown on top.  Delicious!

Easy and quick to make.  I made it with parm instead of romano and topped with more parm and mozzarella.  The inlaws loved it for thanksgiving!  Note:  It's much better served hot instead of luke warm.

Awesome!  This recipe always gets eaten up right away--it's way better than the restaurant! :)  The only thing I would add is mozzarella cheese!  I like using fresh minced garlic instead of jarred or dried--so much better!  Thanks for this great recipe!

So creamy it's a sin! I did make a few substitutions since I couldn't get to the store and had a few things to use up in the fridge but it turned out so much better than any other spinach artichoke dip I've ever made. I used 1/4c ricotta instead of cream cheese, 1/4c of parmesan and 1/4c of shredded mozzerella instead of the romano and I added a whole teaspoon of minced garlic. So yummy I'll be making this again soon.

I love this recipe and so does everyone that I have made it for!  I have tweaked it a little...I prefer to use fresh spinach instead---10 oz. package chopped.  When I have used the frozen spinach, I usually thaw and squeeze it dry & it is much less watery.  I also add some Parm to the romano and up the amt of garlic slightly...gives it a little more flavor.  Just add to taste. =)

Luscious is right! This was just the right amount of spinach to artichoke and extra creamy (I think I made mine creamier than the recipe called for). I also sprinkled some extra mozzarella and Romano cheese on top to give it a nice cheesy layer to dig into. This dip is great with pita chips, tortilla chips and slices of a baguette. Great recipe!!

This was good and everyone liked it but I thought it was missing something.  I think next time I will add a bit more garlic and maybe some white pepper or a dash of hot sauce.

I changed this recipe to make it non-dairy for my family members  with milk allergies.  I didn't use mayo and instead used more IMO (non-dairy sour cream) and soy cream cheese. I sub. the cheese for soy monterey jack.  I also threw everything in the blender to give it a creamy consistency.   Then I added a few chunky pieces of artichoke hearts for texture.  Everyone LOVED it and even the dairy eaters couldn't tell the difference.

this was pretty good - though I made some modifications.  I added more garlic (3 large cloves), more spinach, some lemon extract, dashes of red and black pepper and some monterrey jack (1 cup) and parmesan cheeses (1/4 cup).  it was a big hit at my New Year's Eve party...

Love this recipe!  Maybe an obvious observation, but after thawing the spinach you have to make sure all of the water is drained in order for the dip to be really creamy.  I always have people asking for the recipe!

Everybody who has tasted this has loved it, I've tried many recipes for spin art dip and art dip and this one is the best.  I add a little less spinach and a little more sour cream/cream cheese so that the spinach doesn't over power and it is creamier.  I also add more cheese; you can also substitute parm but it's not as good in my opinion.

I've made this dish for so many parties and people can't get enough of it.  No substitutions needed, it's the best spinach artichoke dip recipe I've tried to date.  If you microwave the dip to warm it up a little before you put it in the oven, you can significantly reduce your baking time.  It's ready when the top starts to brown.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times I've been asked for the recipe. It's really a great dip!

Changes I made:
I used 8 oz of sour cream and 8 oz cream cheese
I used 3 whole garlic gloves, minced
I used a dash or two of lemon juice
I always sprinkle romano, parmesan, and a touch of mozzarella on top

Excellent dip but MUST be kept warm or it will still be left over at the end of your party!  I find that I have good luck setting out a double batch in my small crockpot, set on Keep Warm.  Pita chips or tortilla chips are what most folks want with this!

Delicious!  I added a full package of spinach and didn't measure the other ingredients at all.  I added more cream cheese (reduced fat) to compensate for the additional spinach.  Like other reviewers, I added a bit more garlic, some cajun spice mix as well.  I also used additional cheese and added sliced almonds on the top too.  This was part of a Xmas eve buffet and I was going for "festive." It tasted especially good with red pepper strips. And while the dip did thicken when at room temp, it was still tasty.  Next time, I'll change the spices and add feta.

We (teenage daughters, especially) love this recipe, but we TRIPLE the amount of spinach. Everything else the same.  One time I didn't have romano, used cheddar, just as good. Pita chips for dipping.  Thanks Youri.

This was pretty good, maybe tasted a little healthy compared to what you might eat at a restaurant. I used parmesan cheese and added a couple of tablespoons of extra mixed cheese shreds. I was grateful for a healthful recipe that contained spinach, and that my husband (who will not eat spinach) enjoyed.

I have been making this recipe for years, withought changing a thing, really. It is always a hit at parties. I do use the flavored artichokes that are marinated in italian dressing, and that seems to give it extra oomph...Great baked in a dish, or transfered to small crock pot...

I made this for a potluck, it was gone in no time, and got multiple requests for the recipe.  I used an entire block of cream cheese, as some other reviewers did, and I used light sour cream and mayo (in my experience, the more light ingredients you use, the less creamy it is, particularly if you reheat).  I also used the jars of marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped.  Added monterey jack cheese on top and served with blue corn tortilla chips.

MMMMM, VERY YUMMY!  My husband said it's worthy enough to be from a restaurant!  I was very surprised!  The only modification that I made was I put a whole block of cream cheese in.  I will be making this for holidays!  Very good with toasted french bread.

this was delicious!  there was another one very similar to this on the same site that also sounded good so I incorporated what I liked from that one and created this one.  I doubled the entire amount added more garlic and put in two cups of mozzerella cheese and a little more than a whole brick of cream cheese. baked for about 45 minutes.  took to a New Years Eve party and got huge Kudos!! will make this again for parties for sure!

This recipie is wonderful!  I made this for an appitizer last Thanksgiving and everyone wants me to make this again for the hollidays.  The only thing I do differently is I add parmesean cheese instead of the Romano simply because I usually have parmesean on hand.   This is so awesome with tostitos!

This is just like my favorite at a local restaurant that recently closed. I'd been searching for one with cream cheese in it like theirs. This is so close! The only thing I thought this was missing was a bit of salt. I'm not a fan of salt either...but when I tasted it..it just seemed a little bland so a pinch of salt helped. I also topped it with fresh grated parmesan cheese and let it melt and stirred it in and served with sliced sourdough baguettes. YUM! I'll make this often.

This is a good recipe to start with, but I decided to "tinker" just a bit.  I used 2 6oz jars of marinated artichoke hearts as I could not find a 14 oz can. I omitted the cream cheese and used equal parts mayo and sour cream as suggested by another reviewer.  For the cheese, I had on hand a bag of Kraft 4 Cheese Italiano blend.  I used 2 french onion soup bowls to bake it (and still have enough left over for a third bowl).  In one, I baked it as is.  In the other, I stirred in some crab meat and topped it with Pepper Jack Cheese.  Both went over very well at home.  I will be making this again for sure!!

Made this two nights ago to heat and serve last night.  Mixture was very tasty, but I was not happy with the consistency after 10 minutes out of the oven.  Started out smooth and creamy but hardened and become lumpy quickly after.  I was expecting a lot of positive feedback based on other reviews, but I heard 'this is good' only once....

I made this recipe for a new Years Day party and everyone just raved about it. This is going to be the only Spinach Dip I ever make, it was absolutely wonderful. I did make a few changes, according to what others said. I used creamed spinach, 1/2 a cup of cream cheese, and a ton of cheese. I used Romano, parmesan, and Monterey Jack. Several people told me it was better then what they get in restaurants. I severed it with toasted pita bread and blue corn chips.

Very good. I used parmesan instead of romano cheese and added a bit of fresh ground pepper and salt as well.

My family always requests this for our family gatherings. It's the best spinach artichoke dip I've found yet! Just make sure you don't drain or squeeze the spinach--I did this by mistake once and it wasn't nearly as creamy as the other times I made it.

this is a great basic recipe, but to get it to be restaurant style you need to double or triple the cheeses depending on how creamy you like it to be. as is it is more of a spread than a dip.

I started using this recipe a year ago. It has been to several parties with me, and specifically requested to be brought again this holiday season. It's been passed on to family and friends. As my cousin said she made it for a party and never even got to have any! her girlfriend has nicknamed it "Supremo Yum" I lost the recipe, tried others and they were all missing something. I finally hunted it down through my cousin and many people are gratefull
Thank you Youri

This dip is delicious.  I substituted marinated artichokes to give it some zing and eliminated the cream cheese (upping the mayo to 1/2 cup).  I make this a couple of days ahead to let the flavor blend (before baking)...it makes a difference in the dip's final taste.

Although this recipe is easy to make it just did not taste good. It's hard to put into words but the cream cheese didn't help and literally the second it cooled (which is going to happen as people dip) it changed it's flavour yet again.  I will not be making this recipe again.

I love this recipe!!!  I use fat-free ingredients and add parmesan cheese to the recipe.  The dip tastes good on triscuit crackers, town house crackers, and toasted sour dough bread.

This was ok.  The basics were there but I found it pretty bland when made exactly as the recipe stated.  I made a double batch of this for a party. I used a full pkg spinach, 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c plain yogourt and 1/2 c cream cheese. Used 3-4 tbsp light mayo.   Added at least 1 1/2 tbsp of minced garlic and some of the artichoke marinade for flavour.  Next time I will use onions and salt also.

Hooray I can finally make spinach-artichoke dip like the restaurants! I made this for the first time today for my bridesmaid luncheon, and we loved it! I doubled the recipe, and even though there were only 5 of us and a ton of this stuff, almost all of it got scarfed! Yum yum yummy!

I made this yesterday for my daughters bday party. I was disappointed in it. The top never browned even after leaving it in for an extra 20 min at 400 degrees. It didn't have the creamy consistently I would have liked and I thought it was bland. I followed the directions exactly. I should have read the reviews before heading to the store...maybe Monterey Jack of something would have helped it out. I honestly don't know why this recipe has 4.5 stars.

Loved it!  Recently went to a chain restaurant and their spinach artichoke dip was very tasteless.  Not so here... I used 1 can of artichokes, which I cut up to one whole box of spinach to double the recipe.  Note- even doubling it, it is not a huge amount.  Was very tasty!

This is really good, and went over very well at a party.  I did modify according to taste - fresh baby spinach, herb and garlic cream cheese, a pizza cheese blend, and a bit of cayenne - but the basis of the recipe is a keeper.   Making ahead of time allows to flavour to set up.

This was delicious. I followed other reviewers and put the whole block of cream cheese in. I also added more parmesan to give it a little more flavor. It was a HUGE hit.

Delicious. Used parmesan instead of romano and added mozza; put all the cheese on top.

Made this last night for a party. Everyone loved!!! I read other reviews and it definitely needs more of the mayo, cream cheese, and sour cream.  I just eyeballed everything but I would say I was fairly true to others estimates...about a cup of sour cream, 1/2 cup cream cheese , etc. Also cooked about 40 minutes because it needed it. I also added mixed cheese to the mix and on top for extra creaminess. YUM!! Will definitely make again!!

Made this dip exactly as instructed except added a layer of cheese on top after putting it in baking dish. Turned out excellent and didn't last long. Should have doubled the recipe :) Fed about 12 people in appetizer portions. Served with squares of sourdough bread for dipping.

This was just OK. Made as directed, I would not call this luscious. I thought it needed more cheese to balance the artichoke taste, and to make it more creamy. Thanks!

A pretty good recipe. I hate mayonnaise, so I omitted it and it still came out very creamy and delicious. I also didn't have any garlic, so I omitted it too and it turned out great!

I have made this recipe numerous times. It has been requested by both family and friends to any function. All I do different is use sour cream instead of mayo and I mix in the mozzarella cheese instead of put it on top. I have never had a complaint about this dip and it's absolutely fantastic!!

I made this as an appetizer in a bread bowl and everyone loved it.  It was gone so fast that people asked me to make seconds that night.  I added a pinch of paprika and black pepper for a little kick.

I made this for my sister in law's baby shower and it was just a hit!!!!!!!!! I actually added some mozzarella cheese and Parmesan I grated. You can add more cheese if your like me and LOVE cheese :) other wise as is is still delicious! It was super easy and just delicious. I served it with a fresh baguette and tortilla chips.  I actually just went to a restaurant and had something similar to this but they added pepperoni so next time I make this I may add a little to see how it comes out! :)

I LOVE this dip, I've been making it for years since I begged the recipe off a cousin at a party he brought it to. I eliminate the mayo all together and add a whole block of cream cheese and some fresh ground black pepper. It comes out creamy, I add a lot of cheese on top and that bakes up nicely, but you need to stir it all together while its hot to get that top layer of cheese mixed back in. This is always a huge hit everytime I serve it.. and now I'm 4 months pregnant and making it for myself!!!

My husband made this dip last night and it was amazing!!! Unlike most spin dips, this one was actually hearty and not runny like most queso-based dips. It was very simple to make and being very particular about my Spinach Artichoke dips myself, I was highly impressed. I would recommend this dip to anyone. It's great for parties, etc.

I used a whole pack of cream cheese, 3/4 cup of mozzarella cheese and most of the spinach.  I cut half of the artichokes up and left the other half in chunks.  We thought it could have had more artichoke flavor.  Maybe not as much cream cheese?

Very good dip! It was a success at my party last night. I made double the quantity in an 8" x 8" dish and my 15 guests gobbled up almost the whole thing, and there was lots of other food. My customizing included using alfredo sauce instead of mayo (just because I'm not a fan of mayo), and next time I would add more Parmesan cheese or maybe some Mozzarella. Overall very tasty and easy to make. Don't forget to drain the spinach!

I bought the ingredients without actually having a recipe to follow, and then found this one. It was easy to make and was gobbled up at a party. I used fresh spinach because the store was out of frozen, so that was a pain, but still yummy. I also used the entire block of cream cheese like others did, and fresh minced garlic. I like it to be a bit cheesier, so I threw in a cup of pre-shredded Italian blend cheese, and fresh grated parmesan on top.

Excellent dip! My girlfriend and I couldn't stop eating it. If you use frozen spinach, make sure you dry it well and if the spinach is leaf then make sure you chop it a bit.

Thish was awesome!  I used lowfat ingredients, but added 2% colby jack into the mix itself...it was wonderful!  Thanks. This is a recipe I've been searching for!

I just discovered this recipe recently. I loved it from the start,, My favorite is the lobster,shrimp & cheese dip.  Of course this includes the artichoke & spinach, plus 3 different cheeses @ Red Lobster Restaurants. This recipe with the seafood added makes sure I've gotta try it!!

I made this recipe as written, but we felt that it was missing something because it tasted so bland.  It would definitely benefit from more garlic, more cheese, and perhaps more sauce.  The predominant flavor was of spinach rather than being a blend of flavors.  I'll definitely try other recipes on this site rather than returning to this one.

Great recipe, I use slightly less of the artichokes/spinach, use fontina cheese, add a dash of red pepper, salt and pepper and it's wonderful.

This recipe received mixed reviews.  I added a lot of garlic and thought it was still quite bland.  Others loved it.  I probably won't make this again

I added more cream cheese and 1/2 cup more cheese to it, as well. I baked it the night before a party for work, and it was wonderful even after it had cooled down the next day (in a bread bowl of course!).

i made a few changes on this recipe and it was a big hit.  my boyfriend doesn't like artichokes, so i left them out completely.  i added a bit more garlic and parmesan, just b/c of our tastes, and i put them in mini phyllo shells before i baked them.  they were gone as quickly as i put them out there!  really tasty, and presents very well in the phyllo shells!!

Thought it was wonderful, and our guests really enjoyed it. We love garlic, so I added 1/2 tsp. instead of 1/4. I also added one cup of mozzarella, taking suggesstions from others who also love cheese.

Everyone loved it but me.  I think that the mayo was kinda funky.  Alfredo sauce would probably be better.  I served it at a fight party, and I was embarressed about the flavor, but hubby said I was being silly...so I'll give it a 3.

This is pretty good.  I tried it after my sister called me the day before Thanksgiving and asked me if I planned to make the spinach artichoke dip I'd mentioned.  I didn't remember mentioning it, but I decided to find a recipe and give it a shot.

Everyone that has tried this dip has asked me for the recipe! I did make a minor change..I added 1/2 cup of shredded monterey jack cheese into the dip and another 1/2 on top. I chopped a red pepper and sprinkled it on top when I served it. I have learned to double this recipe since it disappears so quickly!

It's not like you can go wrong with anything w/ the basic spinach artichoke dip. I didn't have Romano cheese on hand, subsititue with the Parm. I used 1 full cup of that. Added a few dashes of Tabasco for some kicks. Chopped up some waterchest nuts for some texture variation. It's fantastic! BTW I only eyeball all the quantity. Still tastes really darn good. I got tons of request to make it on company potluck or gatherings!

I didn't eat any of this (I don't like spinach or artichokes) but my guests told me that it was excellent. I put in too many artichokes for some people's tastes, but my husband (a huge choke fan) says he'll gladly polish it off. I was working from a huge Costco sized jar of the artichokes, so it was bound to happen. :) This was a winner, though, and I'll serve it again at Christmas!

Good, I didn't have regular cream cheese, so I used Veggie cream cheese, and I used parmesan cheese and mozzerela instead of romano.  Still yummy!!!  My Husband Loved it!!

This was very good, but had a slightly odd flavour, almost like it had something smoked in it. I did add more cheese as someone suggested, but used all romano, so maybe that was the reason. I made a few other changes too, so next time I'd like to try the recipe exactly as written.

I made this for a holiday party in December. There were leftovers at the end of the night, which is a sure sign it wasn't a complete hit, especially since everything else was gone by the middle of the festivities.

Very good!  The pan was scraped clean at the end of a recent party I made this for.  I added a small can of green chiles and a squirt of lemon juice.

good, but i thought the amount of sour cream needed to be lowered 1/4 cup, and replaced it with 1/4 cup romano. It made the dip too sour creamy with 1/2 cup.

Delicious everytime.  Even my husband who claims to NOT like spinach, artichokes, cream cheese, OR sour cream can eat almost the whole dish!!  I use tortilla chips to dip with.

I tried this out on friends at our New Year's Eve party.  Rather than eat with chips or crackers, we fried bowtie pasta.  This was our favorite dish at Trapani's Eatery in Bay St. Louis, MS.  Trapani's was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, but we can still have our favorite appetizer.  It is very easy and delicious.

This was better than "ok" but not nearly as good as what I've had in a restaurant.  We added a whole brick of cream cheese, and we also added more romano/parmesan cheese.  I thought that the broccoli was the first thing I tasted and seemed to be a strong flavor in it.  I think if I make it again I'll use a bit less.  Guess I'll still look for that "restaurant style" dip recipe.

I took this to a potluck and it disappeared.  The dish was actually scraped clean.  I used parmesean instead of romano. I also added a little monterey jack (1/2 cup) into the mix. I used crushed crotons as topping.  It was delicious!

Made this recipe for 2 parties we had last night and was a super hit at both...and am back on my computer printing it off right now for someone else to make it today!  Fantastic...couple modifications - I blended the artichokes, used 1 pkg spinach, doubled the sour cream and mayo, used a whole block of cream cheese and used a "mozza, cheddar, monterey jack with jalapeno" mixture for the cheese.  Also topped it off with some cheese.  Highly recommended to EVERYone!!

I prepared this recipe to compliment a late summer dinner and was delighted with the results.  Instead of serving with tortilla chips, I opted for sliced organic garlic tortillas.  There were leftovers, and the following day I spread the slightly warmed dip onto a toasted wheat flatbread.  The flavor of the dip seemed to intensify the second day; this could be attributed to the flavors being able to marinate overnight which could lend a deepened flavor.  But, I also prefer the dip to be at a slightly cooler temperature, as the flavors are able to better rest on the palate.  I ascertained that plain or lightly flavored bread enables a better appreciation of this recipe; strongly embellished bread detracts from the flavor.

This was an excellent dip.  It made a huge bowl and was one of the only things devoured at a recent party.  The only change I made was adding parmesan reggiano instead of romano cheese.  Awesome!

Really good.  I tasted it when it was hot, and was disappointed bc I found it lacking something.  But once it cooled down to room temperature, all the flavors came together, and it was great.  I did put extra garlic and monterey jack cheese.  But this will be my default dip recipe for sure!  Oh - and it was so easy to make.

I made this for the first time for a party I went to and everybody loved it. Perhaps the only complaint is how unhealthy it was after they saw the ingredients in the recipe. It may be worthwhile to substitute low fat ingredients. But personally, if it's party food, it's got to be rich in flavour, so I wouldn't change anything in this recipe.

This recipe is 5 stars to me with a few changes. I like more spinach than artichoke so I used 1 whole package of frozen spinach which I cooked for 4 min in micro and only one jar of artichokes. I added monterey jack like others suggested and onion powder. I almost doubled the cheese sour cream mix to make it creamier. Took it to a party and got many compliments. It really did taste like a restarant-style dip.

I prepared this in my mini-crockpot and plugged it in right when the first guest arrived.  Over half of it was gone before it totally warmed through!  I didn't alter the recipe except for substituting grated parmesan for the romano (it was all we had in the house).  What a great recipe!  Garlic lovers will need to add more garlic....and I would probably add romano in addition to the parm next time I serve this.  Thanks!!

This is a good dip. My husband loved it. It is very rich and goes a long way. I would recommend having it with crisp baguette slices because the flavor goes nicely. Impressive for friends....

Two enthusiastic yums up!  I made with lite mayo and  fat free sour cream and added a little more crushed garlic.  I made it as an appetizer at a dinner party.  The bowl was scraped clean.  Delish!

Very good flavor.  I might add a little more cheese and mayonaise next time to make it a little thinner.

When making this recipe for the first time, I decided to use fresh chopped spinach and added 5 oz. Following that, it seemed a bit dry so I added 1/3 cup more of cream cheese, mayo, Parmesan cheese and 1/2 c. mozzarella. I also increased the garlic to 1 tsp. It was fabulous!

I have made this recipe twice within 2 weeks for gatherings and it has been a hit! I added some chopped onion and cheese on top for extra flavor.  Just have to keep warming it up periodically.

Wow!  This was SO easy and SO delicious.  I tried it because so many of you liked it.  More folks asked me for the recipe for this than anything else I served at my neighborhood Halloween party.  Doubling the recipe yielded enough to fill two nice-sized circular pumpernickel loaves.

I loved this dip. I added crabmeat and extra garlic salt for more flavor. I would reccomend using slightly less spinach.

This recipe is awesome! I doubled it like the other reviews said and added a brick of cream cheese. I served it at my five year old's birthday party and by the time I was done serving drinks to the guests the double batch was gone! The only little bit I got to try was when I was checking to see if it was heated through. I served it in a hollowed out bread round and it was perfect! Thanks!

This recipe turned out terrific. All my party guests loved it. In order to get a thicker consistency, I had to add more cheese and cook longer, but it tasted great!

I've made it three times for parties I've been to.  The first time I used fresh grated romano.  The next two I just used a container of powdered parmesian.  Great either way.  I double the recipe and keep some at home :)

I read a lot of reviews first. And if you like a creamier dip, use the entire block of cream cheese. I also added 2 tsp of garlic instead of 1/2, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1 tsp of onion powder. Was amazing with these modifications. Salt and pepper to taste.

I prepared the dish according the to recipe. The flavors were decent, but a bit too runny for my taste. This is my first time making any type of artichoke dip, but I think it would be better if there was more cheese baked into it to give it more of a pull away thickness instead of the runny texture.

I added more cream cheese and more garlic plus garlic powder, and a splash of salt. Ended up using a three-cheese Italian blend, then topped with some Parmesan shreds. Baked uncovered the last five minutes. It was good!

Used 1 cup of sour cream, the whole block of cream cheese, half a cup of Romano, and half a cup of shredded Monterey Jack then after I mixed that w the garlic and spinach and mayo I sprinkled more Monterrey jack on top before putting it in the oven. It was a family favorite, I will for sure make it again!

I made this for a party; it must have been good because it was gone before I could make a plate. I only used half the can of artichokes drained and rinsed. I guess I’ll be making this again.

First, I don’t think you should give it  5 stars and then show how to improve it. I was influenced by reviewers to change the original recipe by adding more cream cheese however this  is a bad idea as it drowns out the flavor of the spinach and artichoke.

This dip is absolutely delicious. The only deviation I did was to add more cheese (pretty much doubled it) while adding some on top before baking. We made it three times in one week!

This is a party hit for sure! it's rich and creamy. I topped it off with the reccomend cheese as well as cheddar. I baked it with foil on until the last 7 minutes or so, which kept the cheese from hardening.

As written, it came out very thick - not creamy at all. We joked it was a artichoke spinach casserole rather than dip. But taste was good. Just need to make again with an attempt to make it creamer by increasing one of the more liquidy ingredients. Also I used only romano cheese adding a layer of cheese on the top but that turned into a firm layer that wasn't easy to scoop either so note to self to not use that cheese on top again. Maybe try mozzarella as others have suggested.

This is a great dish for parties or just for an everyday snack.  I’ve made it for holiday parties and get togethers with friends and family.  Everyone always loves it.  I add a little more Romano cheese and fresh garli

I only gave it a three as written.  I thought it was a little bland.  I think it could be a five star with the addition of a little lemon juice and Monterrey jack cheese.

yes. This was very good. The only change I made was I added a little salt and pepper and used a blend of shredded cheeses; Romano, parmesan, asiago and added extra cheese on top.

Added some salt and pepper to taste, as well as some red pepper flakes and a dash of onion powder. Also substituted garlic cloves for garlic powder (and went a little heavy with it). Also substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream. Tastes great!

I made a few revisions based on what I had in the pantry. I used fresh artichoke hearts from a dish I made the day before, canned spinach, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup in place of cream cheese. It's delicious!

Easy to make and absolutely delicious. I used fresh Parmesan cheese instead of Romano because that is what I had in the fridge and sprinkled bread crumbs on top. Amazing.

I really liked this, but after reading some of the reviews also made some modifications.  The spinach and artichoke to white sauce ingredients didn't seem right, so I also doubled the creme cheese, mayo, and sour cream..  It also seemed too stiff, so added some milk to make it creamier.  Lastly, I also doubled up on the cheese and garlic.  It was really good and my guests loved it!

This is such a good recipe to start from when making spinach dip. Every time I’m I go to a restaurant, I love ordering it and wanted to make some of my own. I followed most of the directions except I added more Romano cheese to it (half the block) and sprinkled mozarella cheese on top. I am a cheese fan as you can tell...lol Anyway, my guests loved this recipe and I’m adding it to my side dishes.

With a bag of fresh spinach not frozen, a little more garlic and a dab of Baby Rays Honey Hot Sauce. Oh, 1/2 the amount mayo and sour cream and replaced other 1/2 with Greek Yogurt. Soooo delicious!!

I diced up the red bell pepper in a food processor and a added it to the mixture rather than a garnish. Next time I will add more cream cheese and sour cream. It tasted great. Was a hit at the party. I prefer it creamier.

It was soooooo dry.  I'm not sure if it was my fault, thus the neutral rating.  I will try a different recipe next time.  Oh, my friends said it was good, but they had been drinking.

We really enjoyed this one. I used whatever I had in the fridge in place of a few things, but turned out well. I think maybe a little less mayonnaise would be the only thing I'd change. 

Variations:
1/2 lb (before cooked) steamed spinach in place of frozen
1/4 cup shreaded  Italian cheese blend instead of Romano
1/8-1/4 cup shreaded mozzarella sprinkled on top

Round tortilla chips for dipping

I doubled the cream cheese and it ended up being way too rich. Still not too bad though.

Perfect dip for a medium sized group (8-10 people). I doubled the cream cheese and garlic to balance a bit of added spinach. I also added 4oz of Monterey Jack cheese in the mix with another 4oz on top. Topped with fresh jalapenos and after cooking time, removed aluminum foil cover and cranked the oven on to low broil for 5 minutes to allow the cheese and jalapenos to brown slightly.

My family loved this! I used a whole container of sour cream and Parmesan cheese, two jars of artichokes,  the whole spinach, and the entire brick of cream cheese. I cooked it on low in a slow cooker for about four hours because we were away and I wanted it ready when we got back. So easy!

I made this for my New Year's eve party. I did follow suggestions from other reviewers however. I added an additional 4 oz. of cream cheese, a teaspoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of garlic powder. It came out really good but I will double all the cheeses next time. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic! Baked it in my smaller round Pampered Chef pan and it stayed toasty warm just long enough for us to gobble it up New Year's Eve with blue nacho chips and thinly sliced baguette. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made it for a work party and got lots of compliments.   Used a full block of cream cheese and squeezed a splash of lemon, otherwise followed the rest of the directions and turned out nice and creamy.

This was a huge hit!!! Here are my changes (everything else the same):
Used an entire 10-oz. bag of spinach (MAKE SURE YOU SQUEEZE TO DRAIN FIRST!!!)
SQUEEZE TO DRAIN ARTICHOKES, TOO, after rinsing thoroughly!
Used an 8 oz. tub of sour cream
Used an 8 oz. packet of cream cheese
Two heaping tablespoons of olive-oil based mayo
3 Cloves of Garlic
1/2 Cup grated Romano Cheese
Generous salt and pepper (I know, the cheese is salty, but you'd be surprised how much more salt it needs)
Sprinkled about 1/2 cup mozzarella on top
Baked for 30 minutes on convection, 375 degrees
IT WAS PERFECT!

This recipe is always requested when I go to family events. I typically make it as written, but I have changed up the amounts of cream cheese, sour cream, and mayo depending what I have on hand. All of the combinations turn out great! I also add a ton of extra mozzarella cheese on top for super stringy-ness.

Best spinach artichoke dip ever!!! Better than the restaurant we would order from! I had 3 pre cooked fresh artichokes no one wanted to eat. I looked for a recipe. Had a bit of fresh steamed left over spinach. Added a bit more frozen I had in the freezer. Chopped the artichoke hearts and seasoned with olive oil, cider vinegar, salt and pepper. Seasoned the spinach a little w s/p. Has 1/3 cup left over freshly grated Gruyere cheese. It gave it a special touch. Added all other ingredients from recipe. Oven. Delicious!!!! Thank you!

My family loved it. It was AMAZING!  Nobody could get enough of it. I didn't put in any mayo, but put in a little extra cream cheese and sour cream. I used shredded cheddar and Monterey Jack instead of Romano  (couldn't find any in this small town). This recipe made lots, and I am DEFINITELY making this again!

Wow.  I am rarely moved to submit reviews but this was such a hit I had no choice.  AMAZING. I microwaved the mix until it was melted and then transferred to a small crock pot.  SO DELICIOUS!!!! Will absolutely make this again.

This dip has a good texture and was popular at the party to which I took it.  I did double the amount of spinach (I like spinach,  and the dip looked like it could use a little extra).

We ate it all, (on baguette) and it wasn't bad; my husband gives it 4 stars, but I would have liked it better with a layer of cheese melted on top, a longer baking time (I actually baked it a little longer than suggested), and removing the foil cover toward the end so it browns a little.  Also, it tasted mostly of artichoke hearts and sour cream.  I did add 1\2 teaspoon of salt and sprinkled some pepper, which it needed.  I want to find a similar recipe but with a cheese layer on top, more spices, and I'll use the smallest jar of artichoke hearts so maybe the flavor won't be quite so dominant.

I truly LOVED this dip. I have to make a double batch to keep up with the demand. However, I do use a mixture of Romano and Parmesan for the cheese. And for a double batch, only one and a half cans of artichoke hearts.

Luscious indeed! As suggested here,I did use the whole 8 oz. package of cream cheese, and subbed broccoli for the spinach as that's what I had on hand. Topped with a little mozzarella cheese and chopped red peppers and fresh parsley for that holiday look. Baked covered until the last five minutes, and it took a little longer to cook than the recipe indicated. Served with scooping style tortilla chips.

Made this a per the recipe but didn't care for the strong taste of garlic. I will definitely leave out the clove of garlic next time. Otherwise it was very tasty.

I made a few changes because I am not a fan of mayo. Some spinach or artichoke dips taste too much like warm mayo!  I used 4oz of cream cheese and 3/4 cup of sour cream.  I also added a few shakes of Tabasco for a little extra flavor.  It's not spicy.  My 8yr old would eat the entire bowl if I'd let her!

This was first time ever making spinach dip ... I doubled the veggies and quadrupled the mayo, sour cream, romano, garlic and mayo.  I also added mozzarella  cheese.  It was  creamy and a huge hit!  will definitely make again.

Fantastic and easy recipe. I did 1 cup sour cream instead of 1/2 and forewent the mayo. Might have been enhanced with some shredded aged cheddar, but I was not left wanting. Will make again!

Absolutely delicious! I just mixed some mozzarella cheese in with the rest of ingredients. I used light mayo, light sour cream, and Neufchâtel cheese, and added more garlic. It came out great even using light ingredients!!

I always use this exact recipe. It's perfect just the way it is. I do agree with squeezing most of the water out of the spinach and rinsing the artichokes though but  I wouldn't change anything except the servings. This would never last 24 servings in my house!

This was okay.  I followed the recipe and the mayo flavor was too strong.  We also didn't really like the flavor of Romano cheese.  Next time I'll add less mayo and Parmesan cheese instead of Romano or find a different recipe.

I used to use a different recipe off here and could not find it, so I used this one.  I made this last night for a party.  It was all gone by the end of the party, but I thought it lacked something like dill or lime juice.  Maybe rinsing the artichokes took the flavor away that I was looking for.  I baked it in a pie dish so it would cook all the way through but it was slightly runny as well in the middle.   I cooked it an additional 10 mins as well.  It was best right out of the oven.  I will continue to look for the other recipe that I like.

I am terribly disappointed.  I love spinach artichoke dip, but this was a thick, blah mess.  Even not rinsing the artichokes (unlike many of you, I like the acidity of the canned artichoke), it lacked flavor and was somehow dry and not creamy, despite all the sour cream, mayo, and cream cheese.  I will not make this again.

I used a whole package of frozen spinach, the regular size can of artichoke hearts (8.5 oz), about a half of block of cream cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup of parm cheese, and some parm cheese sprinkled on top. Everyone loved it. Next time I will add a whole block of cream cheese just to make it a little creamier. Good, quick, and easy recipe! It was gone before I could add a picture!!

Awesome recipe!! I could eat it straight out of the pan. I used the entire 8 oz of cream cheese , used garlic Alfredo and a little bit of garlic powder and added a couple tablespoons of rotel for an extra kick. It was fantastic!

Very good recipe. Definitely rinse artichokes to mild their flavor. I didn't rinse them enough the first time I made this, and it was really artichokey.

This was an easy to make recipe.  I used vegonaise instead of mayonnaise; "sour supreme" instead of sour cream and "better than cream cheese" instead of cream cheese both by "tofutti" and it turned out delicious!

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and my boys ate it all.  They loved it! Really simple to make.  Serve warm with tortilla chips or french bread.  It is wonderful.

Made this as written and it was just ok. Tasted ok while still warm but lacked flavour. Brought this to  a party and had over half left over. Not a good sign. Sorry will not make this again

Like others I did alter a bit. I used 8oz cream cheese, 1 cup of mayo, 8 oz shredded italian style parmesan cheese, fresh lemon juice, 2 cloves of garlic and added jalepenos. I used a hand mixer to get everything blended and creamy. The flavors blend beautifully. This was amazing even before it went in the oven!

Made this for a potluck and it was all gone :) I would've liked a tad more spinach in it though because I was eating a lot of artichoke, but still really tasty and easy to make!

Made as written and pretty bland. Needs something but not quite sure what. It was very thick. So maybe more mayo and/or sour cream? The lemon jiuce and extra garlic suggested by others would probably help. More cheese too.

I really liked the final product, a little tangy and just the right consistency. I used fresh, unfrozen spinach chopped up.  I packed the 10 oz into my measuring cup to get the most possible.  I used about a third as many artichoke hearts as what the recipe called for, because I like my dip more spinachy.  I used parmesan cheese instead of romano and heated it up in a slow cooker on low for about 2 hours.  I served it with chopped up red onions and tortilla chips.  Very yummy!

What is wrong with this to me is the Romano cheese. Taste tested all the way through, adding the cheese last.  It was great until the cheese.  Ended up double the recipe adding parm cheese instead to save it as not to waste all those other ingredients.  It worked.  Next time, NO ROMANO.

those who liked artichokes loved this.  I only had fresh spinach on hand, and used that instead with great results.  The whole thing was eaten quickly, mostly by one person.

YUMMY!!! I bring this to all pot lucks or get togethers becuase it is demanded of me becuase it is that good. Some tips: I use fat free / reduced fat everything (mayo, cream cheese, sour cream) becuase it can tend to be to rich if you dont (also makes it a little healthier). My boyfriend loves when I mix a little mozzarella cheese in the mix before baking (adds more depth). I serve it with a thinly sliced baguette. I also like to add chopped tomato on top and sprinkle on mozzarella cheese for the last few minutes of baking. Also, throughly rinsing and washing of the artichoke hearts and spinach is a must, if you dont, sometimes you can get a bit of a canned taste. And for leftovers (if you have any) make an omelette and put this on top. Happy cooking :)

Made this for a family get together over last Memorial Weekend.  Was so easy to make and everyone - from the oldest to the youngest - gobbled it up.  I added some Sharp Cheddar Cheese and Swiss Cheese - shredded kind of both - to top at end of cooking time - until it melted. Served with crackers and we had to run to the store to get some more crackers.  Will definitely make again.

Terrific recipe!  I used a whole block of cream cheese and fresh spinach that I steamed with a little lemon & garlic, then chopped.  I use fresh grated parmesan on the top for a nice texture.  1/2 a cup of sundried tomatoes adds a nice color (the red & green was great around the holidays.) I use reduced fat whenever possible, but I tried using fat free cc & sc and it just didn't bubble and the flavors didn't mesh the same. I toss the leftovers in with some pasta and my kids devour it.

Super easy and turned out perfect.  Just be sure to drain the spinach and the artichokes well and make sure they are both chopped finely.  I rounded up a bit on the sour cream and mayo (maybe a tablespoon on each) to make sure it had a good consistency for a dip.

Used it last night for an appetizer at a New Years Eve Party.  I used fresh organic spinach that I chopped and lightly sauteed in olive oil, and it worked out great.  I think I like a cold spinach artichoke dip better, though to be honest!

This is a great dip recipe.  I didn't have any artichoke hearts so I used just spinach and it was just fine. I added a cup of shredded mozzerella and increased the garlic as well - yum!  Some suggestions -squeeze all the liquid out of the spinach, be sure that the cream cheese is softened and (if you use artichoke hearts) use the canned ones, not the marinated jar ones. Rinse them and chop them up really well first. Throw everything in a mixing bowl and mix well with your electric mixer. Don't overbake this.

Loved this! Used an entire 10 oz. package of spinach, because what in the world would I do with that other half package, and it was perfect. When cold it does firm up, but served hot or warm on baguette slices it was awesome. Not oooey-gooey like the chain restaurants, but then again, those rarely have any discernible spinach or artichoke in them, and this had both. I used reduced-fat sour cream, olive oil mayo and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Thanks, will make again!

Made it for Thansgiving and it disappeard in minutes. Did follow recipe to the letter and I think I will add more cream cheese, Romano and garlic next time mainly due to the fact that those are my 3 fave ingredients. I will start bringing this to many get togethers.

Made it for a Thanksgiving Appetizer to bring, left it accidentally and my friend told me: "Your dip is the gift that keeps on giving". Success despite not finding a "14 oz can of artichoke dip, but used 2-8 oz cans instead, just added 1 cup sour cream and 1 & a half blocks of cream cheese to make up the difference. Turned out great, will absolutely make it again.

I agree with GDENISEG- this recipe was very disappointing.  I also followed the recipe to a T and it was very dry and was overpowering with spinach. (Yes, I realize this is a spinach dip, but I felt like I was eating straight spinach) If you have to change the ingredients in order to make the dip taste good, then the recipe should not get 5 stars.  Instead, please post your delicious recipe for me to try instead.

This was great. I roasted two large cloves of garlic instead of using minced garlic. I used a half of cup each of reduced fat mayo, light sour crean and 1/3 less fat cream cheese to try to make it a little healthier. I also added about a cup of monterey jack cheese and used grated parmesan instead of romano as that is what I had. I used the entire package of spinach because I hated to waste it and similar recipes on this site used the whole package. This was a hit at a party last  night and I will be adding it to my list of party take alongs.

I make this recipe to a T, except I  add some marble cheese ontop, and broil it for a few mins to get a nice bubbled effect on top, It tastes AMAZING, and ive gotten plenty of compliments on it.

This came out awesome; followed the directions like the recipe called for. I didnt use minced garlic I used garlic powder. I  doubled the ingredients b/c I wanted to make it for a party. I didn't use Romano cheese, I didn't have it so I  used parmesean. I  also got a Kings Hawaiian loaf cut a bowl shape out of the middle, broke all the left over bread from the cut out into bite size pieces and toasted the breadand pieces on a pan until it was toasty and warm not too cruncy though. I put the dip in the bowl part of the bread. ( the dip was still warm, if it is not heat it a lil in themicrowave.) I served and every one was hogging lol Thanks for a great recipie!

I just made a double batch of this and was disappointed.  I used a little extra cream cheese and parmesan instead of romano.  I thought it was bland and dry.  I wish I'd doubled the cream sauce and added salt, pepper, and onion powder.  It might help to top with diced tomatoes.

I altered mine a little. I cut out the cream cheese completely to avoid the extra calories/fat, substituted the sour cream with plain yogurt, doubled the garlic, and used about 1/2 cup of three cheese (parmesan, asiago, romano) blend in the dip. I also sprinkled just a little extra along the top once it was in the dish. I found that just throwing everything in the blender for a quick spin worked really well and made this dip super easy to make... but I'm sure following the recipe would yield good results, too.

Anyway, this turned out delicious and I will certainly make this again!

I have used this recipe many times, and the result is always great!  I do make a couple of modifications - I use the whole package of spinache (just for convenience), and I also add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  If I had it, I throw on some shredded cheese on top before baking.  This is without fail a party hit!

Delicious!!! We haven't baked this yet, it's sitting in the fridge for a party tomorow, but I seriously had a hard time stopping eating it direct from the bowl! The only changes I made were sour cream instead of mayo and I added a third of a thai chili for some heat. I can't wait for tomorrow! ;-)

Brought this to work and everyone LOVED it! I used a lot more garlic (always do - I'm a garlic pig). I think next time I'd use a little more cream cheese and/or sour cream tho. YUMMY!

Always a hit!  Definitely use fresh garlic, that makes all the difference.  I make mine with reduced fat mayo, sour cream, and cream cheese (not that it makes this healthy!) and you don't notice any difference.

Just thought I'd throw this out there, but a great way to serve Spinach or Spinach-Artichoke dip is to hollow out a pumpernickle round or loaf, and make a bread bowl out of it. :) My aunt serves it this way, with the dip cold, and I can't get enough!

So easy, and SO good! I make this for the superbowl and it didn't last long! Served it with toasted sliced crusty bread. I added fresh ground pepper, used garlic salt and fresh parmesan cheese in and on top. I will certainly make this again! I also used Costcos marinated artichoke hearts which added great flavor to the dish!

Great recipe! I added some roasted red peppers or extra flavor, then combined all ingredients in the food processor. I opted to cook for a couple hours in the crockpot instead of the oven and had a great result. I will make this one again!

I have been making this recipe for the past couple of years, and it is always my go to recipe. People absolutely love it and it disappears quickly at any function! Also, it serves as a great base recipe to add anything else you desire. I have added red peppers, different kinds of cheeses, mushrooms, diced tomatoes, etc. Always yummy every time!!

I thought it turned out great! I made it for my new year's eve party and most of it was gone by the end of the night. The one thing I didn't like - it seemed a little soupy. Maybe that's because the spinach was too wet? Or I didn't drain the artichokes well enough? Not sure. Either way, I'm definitely making it again!

Yum, I could not stop eating this! Even my husband tried it and said it was good, and he hates spinach. My 14 month old loved it also. I used the whole package of spinach (didn't want the rest of it just sitting in the fridge), so I added a little extra sour cream, mayo and cream cheese. I mixed in about 3/4 a cup of monterey jack cheese, and then topped it with some before baking. Just thinking about it has me drooling!

This dish/dip came out great.  Love the fact that doesn't take much of any of the ingredients.  Will make again.

Very good. I just should have cut up the spinach before adding it. Would make again.

Very good. I only changed one thing. I steamed 2 artichokes, scraped the flesh from petals and chopped the hearts instead of using canned artichokes. We really enjoyed this and will make again.

This recipe is absolutely delicious, but it definitely does not serve 24 people, more like 6-10. Maybe that's just because we loved it so much!

I made it for my Boyfriends family and they were floored. I added extra garlic and a little parmesan cheese to kick the saltiness up a bit. I also used the entire packet of frozen spinach. As a bit of a bonus I tried adding some buttered panko bread crumbs to the top which was pretty but did nothing for the flavor. Nobody believed that this was the first time I made it.

My husband loves different dips. This is on his list of favorites, though. I have had other artichoke dips before that kind of put a bad taste in my mouth. However, this dip is scrumptious!

I have made this recipe numerous times over the last few years. My husband loves it, and sometimes we eat it as our meal by itself. He thinks it is better than most restaurant versions. I usually put in an entire box of spinach, and whatever grated cheese I have on hand which is generally Parmasean or an Italian mix. I also don't measure out the garlic, just mince an entire clove (or two!). This recipe is definitely a permanent one in my collection.

My family & friends love this dip! I drained the artichoke and marinated them for a couple hours in a little Zesty Italian dressing. I used 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup mozzarella.
I sometimes will add one chopped green onion along with the fresh chopped garlic  clove for added flavor.

This wasn't the best dip I've had, but it wasn't too bad. 

Unless you make a double batch or have the ingredients on hand, its kind of a pain to need such small amounts of the ingredients.  

Next time I think I'd leave out the spinach or try a new recipe. Edible and tasty, but not great!

This recipe has been a staple in my family for a few years now. I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas!  My family and I think it is better than any restaurant style, by far. I do add Parmesan cheese, along with more Romano than suggested, as I love cheese! This dip is really good with 'Chicken in a Bisket'(sp) crackers!

A delicious, simple recipe for spinach artichoke dip. I used artichokes in water, not oil, frozen spinach and reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream. I had fresh Parmesan on hand, and substituted that for Romano. I might add more garlic next time, because I like a lot of garlic.

I don't know what I did wrong because this recipe certainly got rave reviews. Per suggestions, I added onions and red pepper as well as lots of cheese. I thought the taste was extremely bland, and I've had other recipes I liked much better. Won't try it again.

This recipe was easy enough, and the flavor wasn't bad.  But I prefer a cheesier dip, so next time I'll try a recipe with shredded cheese.

Was very tastey.  I topped off the dip with extra fresh parmasain and shredded swiss.  Was a hit.  Baked until golden brown on top.

Very yummy! I opted out of baking it and put it in a small crock pot designed for dips and it was really good! I think next time I may heat it before putting it in the crock pot since it took a while to heat up that way.

This was a restaurant quality dip. My guests at my party loved it. I added in shredded monterey jack cheese and sprinked the rest on top to melt as it baked. I also served it with corn tortilla scoops. Very good.

Love it!! I made it for a party last month and it was gone in minuets. Now I find it a must to have all the ingredients at home for when I’m craving some more. Plus it was really easy to make.

Very nice! Made at request of hostess of a bachelorette party. Could be baked longer, wasn't very warm, probably should have used a more shallow dish. Nice flavor.

This was good but not great. Good be because I used low-fat sour cream.  Use the full fat for the full flavor.

Won't rate this on my screw up.  I didn't pay attention and used the whole box of spinach.  I also added some shredded Monterey and Parmesan cheeses.
Was very good.

Even with low or no fat ingredients wherever we could, these were a big hit. We did use parmesano- reggiano cheese instead of that horrible Kraft stuff, though!

Everyone stayed around it till it was gone! They loved it so much they made me make it for them again the next day! I made some changes as recommended, 1/4 mayo, 1 whole pk cream cheese, a cup of mixed asiago/romano/parm cheese and sprinkle more on top. Used the marinated artichokes and much more garlic. I didn't really bled though, just stirred it well. I think the rest I kept the same. Fabulous!

Definitely a crowd pleaser.  Several people requested the recipe.  Not the healthiest treat in the world, but great for gatherings.  This one is a keeper.

This recipe was excellent!  But I do agree it was a little bland.  Next time I make it (which will be soon!) I'll increase the cream cheese, add some garlic and fresh ground pepper.  And to get my kids to eat it, I'll put the artichoke hearts in the blender to get a finer texture.  This one is aces!

Bizarrely, this turned out very liquidy for me, despite other reviews to the contrary.  It may have been my fault, though, for using a little extra spinach and ricotta instead of cream cheese.

Yum! I garnished with monterey jack cheese and served it to my family with toasted pita bread, delicious! I thought it lacked just a little flavor...perhaps more garlic next time? But my mom loved it, so that's all that matters! Great recipe, I used light sour cream and it still came out yummy =) Thanks Youri!

This was a HUGE hit at our lake party this weekend.  I doubled the recipe and it still was gone in no time.  
Used marinated artichokes and canned spinach.  I put the last 5 ingredients in the food processor and then mixed with the artichoke and spinach.  AMAZING!

WOW! What a hit! Fast and easy to prepare! Best Spinach Artichoke dip we have ever had. I can not wait to make it again!The only thing I changed was the amount of spinach used, I used about half of what the recipe called for. This is a wonderful creamy dish. I served it with warm french bread cubes and tortilla chips! Like I said, I can not wait to fix this again!

This is Applebee's recipie so really you can't go wrong. One thing that can help the consistancy is switching light cream cheese for the regular. That will make it stay creamier longer.

I made the dip and served in a bread bowl with toasted bread sticks, the guests at my dinner party LOVED this stuff! I was very pleased with the overall taste, not too bland, all the flavors mixed very well. Much better than any restaurant stuff because I know exactly what goes in it!

This really is a rich dip - you can really taste the spinach and artichoke in this one.  Mine turned out very thick and not as creamy as I imagined it would be.  Very good though.

This recipe is a hit every time I make it!  I usually have to double the recipe just so it last for more than a couple of minutes at a party.  I add a couple of tablespoons of diced pimentos for added color.  This is by far the most delicious spinach dip I've ever had!

Very good! I will definately be bringing this to the next family gathering.  Thanks for the recipe.

Here is an update:  I am now unable to go to a family funtion without it!  The only restaurant that can compare is the Cheese Cake Factory.  My family members say this recipe is better!

This is good but not my favorite.  We really like the Spinach and Artichoke dip by Simmi from this site.  I add garlic to that recipe too.  The cream cheese and sour cream just are'nt needed.  I just wanted to try something different.  Now I know I'll stick to the other recipe.

I always come home with an empty bowl when I bring this to parties and family gatherings. I try to use low for fat free versions of ingredients and it turns out great. I also add extra garlic and sometimes serve it with pita chips.

This is a great appetizer!  I received many compliments on this, alot of people liked this spinach & artichoke dip better than others because it wasn't too creamy.  I'll be using this recipe again!

V. tasty and easy to make.  I've sent it to a few parties with my boyfriend including a superbowl party and it has always gotten amazing reviews.  Everyone asks me to bring it to parties when I come.

Instead of the sour cream, mayonnaise and cream cheese, I substituted ranch dressing. Lowers the fat content by half and gives it a good subtle flavor.

I thought that this recipe was just 'okay'. I thought it would be creamier, like in the restaurants. Didn't think that it would dry out like it did, I left it in the oven for about 10 mins. longer with the oven turned off till guests arrived, but when I took it out, it was a bit dry. More spreadable w/ a knife or spoon. I don't know if this made a difference. Also, I used UNMARINATED artichoke hearts, so I don't know if the recipe should use MARINATED ones. The flavor was a bit bland. Might try Marinated next time for added flavor.

I just made this dip and can't stay away from it. I'm not a cheese eater, so the dip had the perfect amount of cheese in it for me. Thanks for an easy to make, delicious recipe!

Very, very good. I was told it's the best ever, though I thought it seemed to be missing something. It was delicious anyway, and it was all eaten very quickly. This will probably be my default recipe, though I may tinker with it. Thanks!

Really good. If you've had this at Milestone's, this one's even better. I used light miracle whip for mayo, and fat free sour cream. Nobody would ever have been able to tell. i also melted monterey jack cheese on it. next time it will be jalopeno jack cheese!

TIP: If you're using fresh spinach, like I did, don't use more then 5-7 ounces, as with 10 ounces it's very runny.

Excellent! It was very easy to make. I used all fat-free products (except for the Romano cheese, of course) and it turned out delicious. I topped it with some shredded white cheddar near the end & let it melt. It was a nice final touch. I served it with fat-free Tostito corn chips & viola! I had a yummy, virtually fat-free appetizer.

This was just what I had hoped it would be- just like I've had in restaurants! I made it for a cooking club I'm in and I almost stayed home to eat it all myself. Everyone loved it, one person even joked she would like to lick the bowl. It was so easy to make too, I will definitely make this again and again! I did add about a cup of shredded monterey jack cheese to the mixture before baking however, and it was perfection! And only one bowl to clean up when you are done! I served it with chips and sourdough bread, delish!

Delicious! I made it for a pot luck/christmas party. Trippled the recipe (25 people) and there was nothing left. The only change I made was I didn't have Romanoo cheese to I used Parmigiano, I also forgot to chop the artichoke hearts. Came out nicely chunky and creamy.

This was very bland.  It needs some spices or something to liven it up.  It was very creamy though.  I think next time I'd use a flavoring combination from other recipes and use this as a base.

Finally, I found a dip I like. this was pretty good. I don't think there was enough spinach. I also added a little extra cream cheese and romano cheese., next time I will use more spinach.

The flavor was good...whatever I use sour cream in, it separates and looks nasty, but it tasted ok. I used fresh spinach (less salty)and freshly grated Parmesan cheese..and more cheese, and more cheese. I served with Hawaiian bread, to kind of contrast flavors..good choice. Doesn't make a whole lot..double or triple recipe. I didn't use cream cheese, because it would have been too thick. Equal parts mayo and sour cream. A cream soup might be good in it too..theres always a soup for something!

I had great expectations for this recipe, but I ended up a bit disappointed.  It just didn't taste like the restaurant versions that I'm used to.  I may have tinkered with the measurements too much though.  As other reviewers suggested, I added more cream cheese to make it creamier.  I should have adjusted the sour cream accordingly, because I think the cream cheese was too overpowering.  It just didn't seem creamy enough when I was mixing it up, but it was once the cheese began to melt.  My guests still ate it though, and they seemed to like it.  Next time I'll try sticking to the directions!

This is a delicious dip for parties.  Somehow it was a bit too tangy at first, maybe 
from the mayo or sour cream, so I added another 1/8 cup cream cheese and 1/8 cup
Parmesan cheese and it was delicious.  I also added probably double the garlic.

There was something that was off when I made this last night.  I'm not sure if it was too garlicky or too Romano cheese flavored.  Whatever it was, it didn't go over too well and I followed the recipe exactly.

Everyone at my husband's birthday dinner party enjoyed this!  I served it with chunks of King's Hawaiian bread.  You can also hollow out the bread & fill with dip, served with torn pieces of the bread.  Delicious!

A little sour but that could be because of the artichokes I used.  Don't skimp on the garlic & salt.  Friends devoured this!

I accidentally used the whole spinach package instead of half, no problem, it only made the dip "chunkier".  Still good with sour cream and salsa, as all the restaurants serve it that way.  I will add more sour cream, I like mine creamier that way.

Oh my- this is one of THE BEST appetizers I have ever had.  I used to order spinach/artichoke dip when we were out at restaurants but this one is better than one I've ever had out!  I served this at Christmas AND every gathering we've had since then.  I am planning on taking it to my Women's group meeting on Friday and I'm printing out the recipie BEFORE I go - since they are sure to ask for it.  Oh yeah, and I always double it.

I doubled the batch and it wasn't enough!  I used plain old chopped spinach like the recipe (not creamed like all the reviews say)  I thought it was perfect.  I added a little red onion and extra cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This is the best recipe I have found for Artichoke Spinach Dip. Most recipes don't have the cream cheese element & it makes the dish!
I made it for a family get together & it was loved by all!

I tried this recipe a few weeks ago for a party I threw and everyone loved it!  I used the creamed spinached, doubled the recipe and baked for 45 minutes.  I've given the recipe to three of my friends since then and plan to make it again for a gathering I'm going to tomorrow.  Now a definite must for me.

I made this dip for a barbecue and it got rave reviews.  I doubled the batch, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  Of course next time I may add or tweek ingredience.  A guy at the party suggested to add salsa, but I think he's crazy.  TRY IT! It was so rich, so good, and gone so fast!

Add one finely chopped, seeded jalapeno pepper for added zip.  I have served this cold on sliced baguette and crackers.  It really does not need to be baked to be good.

This is similar to some restaurant versions. And my kids love it, and it's easy. I like to dress it up with a few chopped tomatoes and a dollop of sour cream.
