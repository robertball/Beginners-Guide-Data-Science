This was very good.  My cake was moist and perfect.  I made the following changes though:  I didn't have enough sugar, so I subbed 2 c Splenda and 1 c brown sugar.  Also, the cake was done in 1 hr, 15 min.  Adding 15 more minutes to the cake would have made it too dry I think-- just watch in your oven the first time.  I frosted it with some melted chocolate chips that I thinned with a bit of evaporated milk.

Next time, I think I will stir the cocoa in with the flour-- it might be a bit easier to combine with the batter then stirring it in the last minute.  Might try some differant extract flavors instead of the vanilla-- orange, raspberry, or almond would all be good.

I used this recipe to make a friend's wedding cake, and it was a hit!! A delicious moist cake with just the right density. I left out the cocoa and added lemon extract to make a white layer as well, and have been asked to supply one for a party! Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful chocolate pound cake, my family really enjoyed it in a bundt cake form with chocolate frosting drizzled over it. The cake was moist and delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the closest recipe I have ever found to my husband's grandmothers! He said it taste just like hers, which is a huge compliment! I've been trying to get her to teach me how to make it before the recipe is lost forever, but she's one of those cooks who doesn't measure anything, so it is really hard to pin down the actual measurements. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe. I tried mixing together the powdered sugar, cocoa and heavy cream like someone suggested and it turned into whipped cream instead. (I guess I stirred it a little too much!) But this cake does not need anything!! Thanks again!

I had a recipe similar to this years ago and misplaced it.  I am glad I stumbled upon this one.  It is one of the only ones I found that does not call for the addition of coffee.  (call me crazy) I do not enjoy the flavor of chocolate and coffee.  This is a moist cake (careful do not overbake) with a nice texture.  I do make a chocolate glaze and pour over the top, very chocolatey.

This recipe was wonderful, I made it on Valentine's Day, added some fresh strawberries and chocolate sauce on the plate and the kids and husband loved it!
I iced it with a mixture of cocoa powder, confectioner's sugar, and heavy cream while it was still warm and let it soak into the cake.  YUM!

I thought the recipe was pretty bad.  For a pound cake you always expect a rich, moist cake.
This was neither.

Well, here it is, 23 July 2008, hurricane Dolly is headed for our Texas coast.  Thank goodness we are not getting the direct hit.  My sixteen year old wants a chocolate pound cake, I made this one and it was wonderful comfort food in our time of need

This was a very good pound cake.  I think it tasted better the second day.  I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze to frost it.  Next time, I will add miniature chocolate chips to the cake batter for more texture.

This cake was a hit at our house during the Valentine's Day.  I did add  1/2 cup more of unsweetened cocoa powder.  I also substituted buttermilk for the 1 1/8 cup of milk.  I finished with a fudge frosting and topped with strawberries.

I didn't like this cake.  I actually threw it away.  It was very heavy and not super moist.  Perhaps I did something wrong.

Delicioius, moist cake, not quite as dense as I am  accustomed to. Everybody liked it. One problem; the recipe was enough for two bundt cake pans! End result I had two cakes - both are gone!

If you love pound cake, you'll love this!  Someone had reviewed that this cake was dense and heavy.  Well, yeah - it's a pound cake! I had to cook the cake a full 15 minutes longer than the recipie states, maybe it was my oven, but it was still batter in the middle until I left it for a bit longer.  Super delicious!

This is a great recipe to customize. I used evaporated milk instead of whole milk, this gave it richness. I also added dark chocolate mint morsels, this gave the cake a wonderful mint taste and fudgey texture.

Extremely easy!  I've made this twice and it was perfect both times.  Very moist with the perfect crust.  I shared some with my mom last week and she insisted I had used her old family recipe.   It was hard convincing her I had not.  This cake will become a staple in my family.

After reading one of the reviews I too doubled the cocoa and since I only had buttermilk I used it instead of regular milk.  This turned out very moist.  While I am a huge fan of pound cakes I think I prefer them more traditional where you taste the Vanilla and butter.  It just seemed even heavier than most, but very good overall.

Very Disappointed in this recipe! I should have read the reviews before I printed it out & made this recipe. This is the worst chocolate pound cake recipe I've ever baked & I have made several over the 40 years I've been cooking. Can barely taste any chocolate flavor. And while it is moist, it's far from the consistency of a pound cake. I took a 1" slice, ate half of it & threw the rest of the cake out. What a waste of ingredients! I would be so embarrassed to present a slice of this cake to anyone.

Have to figure out what went wrong, this cake was very dry, I went by the direction, maybe cocoa powder was bad,couldn't find an expiration date. The cakes surface was so hard I couldn't insert toothpick, not good at all, might try adding chocolate pudding next time. Family still ate it,I wouldn't have felt bad if they had not eaten it.

This chocolate cake was OK, but I won't make it again.  I was looking for a more "chocolatey" cake.  I'll stick with one of my tried-and-true.  For the cost of ingredients and the time - not worth it.  Sorry.....

I made this last night, it had a good chocolate taste, however, it was very very sweet. I feel too sweet for a chocolate pound cake. And that was with out an icing, I served with whipped cream on top.

I love cakes.  I make them all the time.  I have to say this has to be THE worst chocolate cake I have ever had.  It didn't have the consistency of regular pound cake.  Also the taste was off.  In my opinion it does not have enough sugar.  I won't eat the rest of the cake, and I sure will never make it again.

Very good, got absolutely no complaints from anyone. I was expecting it to be a bit more chocolatey and not quite as dense though. Tastes pretty good with ice cream :)

This is the 2nd best chocolate cake that I have ever made. I will admit that it came out with more of a brownie consistancy, but that is probably my fault. I should have let it bake a little longer. 
I will make this again.
Thanks for sharing.

Moist, tender, sweetness-just right.Excellant recipe! Doesn't need an icing!
I made it with five major brands of all purpose flour bleached and unbleached with consistancy, even with whole wheat flour(iced to hide the whole wheat flavor) and have received nothing but compliments. Easy to make and consistant. I've been lining the pan with parchment paper!

Great recipe! I used it to make a sheet cake, a round cake, and a small loaf pan so it only took 30-40min to bake. Works great for cutting shapes! Note is it definitely dense (it IS a pound cake after all) and shrinks in the pan a little. It is not dry though, very moist. Definitely would recommend!

This is a great all around chocolate pound cake.  Although it was not as heavy as some pounds that I made, it was delicious.  I used 1 1/2 cups butter instead of butter and shortening, 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 3 cups instead of 3 1/2 cups flour and used buttermilk instead of milk.  I experimented and found I could sprinkle regular chocolate chips on top and they would stay.  I also mixed regular chocolate chips into the batter just before I put it in the pan and they stayed spread throughout the cake.  I put shaved chocolate in the batter and got a really moist a delicious brownie texture.  I tried raspberry and orange flavoring without that taste coming through very well.  Vanilla seemed to work best.  I love the versatility of this recipe and it is now a definite go-to.

The recipe was ok, it was very dense and was more of a brownie recipe but it was still good. I won't make it again as I was looking for a lighter cake.

Made recipe exactly as directed.  Cooked in 1 hour 15 minutes (probably should have taken out of oven at 1 hour 10 minutes).  Cake was good but a bit light on chocolate flavor and not quite as dense as I like Pound Cakes (I tend to like pound cakes very dense).  Next time I make I will try substituting 2-3 ounces of cream cheese for the butter to help density.  I did finish the cake  by drizzling Ganache which I would recommend (Chocolate Ganache by INGRIDEVOGEL on All Recipes)

The cake came out out dense but moist as expected of a pound cake. Although, it wasn't "chocolatey"  enough for my tastes. I guess I was expecting something more akin to Devil's Food. Still it was very good. I may try substituting some of the vanilla extract with Rum extract for a Chocolate Rum Pound cake. When I do, I'll post the results.

I halved this recipe and it made a generous 9x5 loaf that was dense and moist with a nice, gentle flavor. I'll definitely be making this again, but perhaps with some chocolate chips to make an even richer chocolatey treat. :)

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. It was moist enough, but not nearly chocolatey enough, and I wasn't compelled enough by it to make my own adjustments to make it work.

Excellent cake- moist yet tender. Better after it cools. Just as good alone as it is with a thin chocolate glaze.

This is a good cake, but I really expected a deeper chocolate flavor. I did check the cake after 1 hour and 15 minutes, but it did not test done. It needed the full baking time. I have an oven thermometer, and know that my oven temperature is within 5 degrees. So it seems the baking time is correct, at least at this elevation.

An good easy recipe that produces a dense cake. It pays to use good chocolate and I thought a chocolate glaze was absolutely necessary. Just not intense enough without it but I also think more chocolate is always better.
