Had a bumper crop of tomatoes, so I used this recipe in all of them, put portions in baggies and froze them for use later in the fall for chile, etc...

I have been canning and freezing tomatoes prepared this way all my life(82) years.  Just didn't know it had a fancy name.  We never liked the abundance of seeds in dishes I made from home preserved tomatoes.  This is the way!!!

So easy it was crazy.  Skins slide right off the tomato. Great tip! Easy to do and easy to clean up! Thanks so much for the tip!
