I got tons of compliments on this recipe, and it was a lot easier to make than it looks. It really is a perfect summer dessert. Next time I'll leave the almonds out, and maybe substitute a little bit of ammaretto in the pastry creme to add the almond flavor; the pieces of chopped nut combined with the seeded berries made me think I was getting enormous blackberry seeds in my teeth!

This was absolutely delicious, but the custard was a bit runny. Next time I will probably add a little cornstarch to thicken it.
