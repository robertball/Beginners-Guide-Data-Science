Very much like Chicken Parmesan only easier! I didn't alter this recipe too much, adding a bit of milk and pepper to the eggs, I used Italian style bread crumbs, olive oil for frying and Mozzarella cheese instead of Monterey Jack which was all I had but would like to try the stronger tasting cheese next time. I pounded the chicken breasts before coating and covered the baking dish with foil for the first 20 minutes than removed the foil and continued baking while my pasta cooked. Very tasty thanks!

Was simple and fairly quick to make.  Whole family loved it!!!  Substituted mozzarella for jack and added garlic powder to the bread crumb cheese coating.

My seven year old daughter helped me make it. I did not fry the chicken, I baked it for 40 minutes instead. So much healthier. I also used whole grain pasta and made my own sauce. But the chicken was amazing.

My family and I liked this dish very much. I only made alterations according to what I had in the kitchen (didn't feel like taking a trip to the grocery). For instance, I used flavored croutons, crushed fine and since I didn't have enough of those I added some left over oyster crackers, also crushed finely, to stretch it, which I seasoned with garlic powder and parmeasan cheese. I seasoned my chicken breasts with seasonings my family and I like and used shredded mozzerella cheese instead of monterey jack slickes (again that's what I already had on hand). It was a smash hit at home and I will def make again.

I made this for my husband a few days back and he loved it.  I used Roma and Sun-Dried Tomatoes Pasta Sauce and generic italian style bread crumbs.

I thought this recipe was good. My only complaint is that the chicken was a little bland without the sauce. Next time I would add some seasonings in with the bread crumb/ Parmesan mixture. Other than that it was good. My hubby liked it too- he's not one for Italian.

Very easy recipe. I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and added parmesan cheese like you said. I sprinkled a little salt and pepper on the chicken before dipping into egg and breadcrumbs. I didn't have vegetable oil so I used melted butter. I used marble cheese slices because that is all I had. The chicken turned out delicious. I love this recipe and even though I didn't have the exact ingredients, they were easy to substitute with ingredients you have at home. Thank you, my family loved it.
