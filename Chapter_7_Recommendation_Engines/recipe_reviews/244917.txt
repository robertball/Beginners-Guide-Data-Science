This is good, but was way too sweet for me. I would cut the sugar at least in half next time. Some may really like it this sweet though. I didn't use instant coffee--I used strong brewed coffee in place of all the water. I made half a batch and put it in a pitcher. I then put a scoop of ice cream in each cup and poured in the coffee mixture.
