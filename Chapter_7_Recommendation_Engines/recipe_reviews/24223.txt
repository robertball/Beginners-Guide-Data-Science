If you love Dr. Pepper cola, you will love this drink. It is a big hit at the bar I go to. Be warned though.... It is not for the light drinker.

This is a good recipe, but my version uses rootbeer schnapps instead of amaretto.  Be careful, they are powerful.  If you want to remember the party don't drink more than two!!

Very good. Surprizing that this actually works together. I wouldn't drink them all the time, but for shock value.....it was worth it.

A long time favorite!  Excellent flavor as opposed to some people who like using Root Beer schnapps or other silly concoctions.  BLOW OUT THE FLAME BEFORE DRINKING!  We've all seen the silly kid on the internet video!

This is one of my favorite drinks to make and show off with my friends!  LOL  I have one friend who doesn't like any of the ingredients individually, but loves this drink.  Yummy!

Awesome! Lighting the shot in a darker spot lets you see the flame a lot better. Such a fun drink! If you have a narrow glass, you can do less beer if you like as long as the beer is deep enough to cover the shot. Thans for the recipe! Can't wait to show this off to friends.

These are AWESOME!  I think they taste more like Dr. Pepper if you use root beer schnapps instead of the amaretto.  Be careful of these.  They go down so easily that you'll get drunk QUICK LOL!

Hubby did not like this at all. He said all he could taste was amaretto, and to him, it didn't taste like Dr. Pepper.  Thanks for sharing. :)

I love these shots!  So fun and tastes delicious.  Don't drink too many at once though, they hit you pretty fast!!
