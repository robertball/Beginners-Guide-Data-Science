Used a mixture of rhubarb, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries and cherries instead of the all rhubarb (didn’t have enough of any of the fruits so used a combination), and used cherry pie filling instead of blueberry. This turned out amazingly wonderful!!! No one has been able to keep their lips off of it and I’m making another batch just one week later! This is reminiscent of the ‘fruiti di bosco’ jam we fell in love with while stationed in Italy. Update: Running low on Rhubarb I added some frozen cranberries to make up for the tartness - wonderful!

I first made this last year  and it went so fast that this year I did all by shopping at cash and carry so I could buy in bulk and I did up 48 pints hoping it would last all year, NOT! my family puts it on everything and I maen everything. It's my husbands favorite and he tries to hide it from the kids. Who ever thought this up, Thank you from the bottom of my heart, it cans with a hot water bath great

My family loved this recipe.  Its a keeper for me.  I followed another reveiw and cut the rhubarb in smaller chunks.  I cooked for a couple minutes longer than it said.  I will be making this again in the near future.

I'm always adapting recipes to meet my personal taste.  I added a couple more cups of fresh rhubarb and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Then I processed by waterbath for 10 minutes.  With these minor changes, it made twelve 1/2 pints of this scrumptious jam.  Everyone I've given it to as a gift has raved how great it is!  Not too sweet nor too tart.   Plus I really like the blend of flavors with the three berries and the rhubarb.  Great Recipe!!!!  :-)

DEFINATELY WORTH MORE THAN 5 STARS!  This is an AWESOME jam recipe!  I made my 1st batch for my daughters' school staff.  (I used 1/2 cup less sugar than called for + add 1 cup strawberries) I only had 1/2 a jar that I was able to keep for myself.  I basically ate it all out of the jar that 1st night.   The following week I decided to make another batch, this time with cherry pie filling & forgot to reduce the sugar to 2-1/2 cups.  I really liked this too, but not as much as the blueberry.   To sum up:   --Blueberry better than Cherry (but, can't go wrong with either!!!) --3 cups sugar IS a bit too sweet, 2-1/2 cups is PERFECT! --add strawberries for that extra umpf of YUMMINESS! --fast & very easy to make/use up rhubarb (P.S.: Teachers begged that I make it again next year for teachers' gifts.)

This jam was very easy to make. I froze it instead of canning it because I don't have a pot large enough for canning. Everyone who has tried it has loved it.

This recipe was SUPER EASY to do.  And it tastes wonderful.  I chopped the rhubarb alot finer than it calls for, but that is just a preference. I would like to figure out how to make it a little runnier too so that it could be made a syrup for pancakes.   GREAT RECIPE!!!

I had some already-chopped rhubarb in the freezer from our still-producing crop of rhubarb that I need to find ways to use.  This is the easiest, quickest jam I have ever made!  With sugar in the blueberry pie filling, and in the strawberry & raspberry Jello, I reduced the amount of sugar from 3c to 2.5c.  This was just right.  This yielded 4.5 pints of jam which I will be freezing.  It is delicious!  Thank you, Karen!

I didn't like the addition of the jello, it added a slightly artificial taste that did nothing for me.  I think for someone who likes sugar it would be good, but I can't give this particular jam away.  If I had to do it over, I would omit the jello in favour of something not chemically flavoured.

This is SO good!  I like that it's not overly sweet, as so many of the jams are.  My husband can't make toast fast enough to use this on.  Wish it was a little thicker though.  Has anyone tried using more jello?

I wasn't a rhubarb fan but this is really good. I made it exactly as stated and the flavor was great. I made my own blueberry pie filling since I had a lot of frozen blueberries. Mine is runnier than you'd buy at the store for jam but who knows about the water content in either my rhubarb or blueberries. I did thaw the blueberries before making the pie filling. If you've got more rhubarb try the  "Struesel Rhubarb Bread" on this site. It is moist & fabulous.

Great sutff.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 1/2 cups sugar.  Added two cups of fresh strawberries.  Next time I will try using Stevia.

This is wonderful Jam.  I made it with strawberry jello instead.    Do NOT double the batch.  It makes it come out runny.  Still edible but not the jam texture that you would like.

The first time I made this jam I used one cup of splenda instead of sugar.  Still sweet.  The last time I made it I eliminated Splenda and just added the pie filling.  Plenty sweet.

Wow! This is so easy to make and tastes really good. This is really a wonderful recipe. I made one batch and knew right away that I needed another batch. I shared with some family and they liked it very much also. Yum! 
**I would like to add that we prefer it with 1 big box of raspberry jello because I don't care for the strawberry jello flavor. I have changed it up using different flavors of jello and different pie fillings.

This is soooo good!  And it’s very easy to make.  I gave my Mother a jar and she loved it, she wants to have the recipe to make her own.  We are getting my Aunt to try it out I’m guessing she is going to want the recipe also.  I’ve never had rhubarb jam before and I’m glad I did.  If you have never made jam before this is a good recipe to try, it’s easy, fast and very good.

AWESOME! I used sugar free jello and only 2.5 sugar followed everything else to the letter.  There seem to be plenty of people thought the original version was too sweet so I made these modifications and turned out great.

This jam is extremely simple!  Being my first time making jam I wanted a smaller batch, so I halved it by usine 2 cups of fresh rhubarb and 2 cups of fresh strawberries, 1/2 can of blueberry pie filling, 1-1/2 cups of sugar and 1 pkg. of strawberry jello, it made 5 - 8oz. jelly jars!  This recipe is very easy and delicious, this will be my "go to" for jam!  I can't wait to try different fruits!

I also cut sugar back to 2 1/2 c., also used all Raspberry Jello and zest of one lemon.  
I make a ton of rhubarb jams and find the ones with Jello work great.  I can them and they keep for a long time .   Always give as gifts and everyone loves.  Oh I also used my immersion blender to make a bit less chunky.   Worked great .  First time I ever did that.

As written this is a terrific jam.  I have been making it for years and everyone I have shared it with loved it and asked for the recipe.  Don't understand why it would be called three berry jam when only adding flavored jello, but to each his own.  It has always been called rhubarb/blueberry jam as far back as I know.  Enjoy!! No need to can, keeps in the refrig. indefinitely.

This jam is AWESOME!! I am a first time jam maker and it was very easy. I did let it boil closer to 15 minutes so there wouldn't be big chunks of rhubarb and it turned out perfect. Will definately be making more!

I haven't made jam in years and was craving something a little "different" and this hit the spot!!!  As other's have said- this is super easy to throw together in a pot.  I did not have fresh rhubarb so I had to use store bought, frozen bags.  A one pound bag was just a little less than 4 cups and I used 2 of them.  Not sure if it was the added moisture from being frozen or if it was the scant measuring I did, but it was a little runnier than I had hoped.  After reviewing what others have done I will try supplementing some other fruit like strawberries next time to make up to the 8 cups total.  I did use only the 2 1/2 cups of sugar like others suggested and used regular jellos. Has a wonderful taste and will certainly be making this again!

Just made this jam today.It is great!! It didn't take no time to make. Just watch out when it is boiling because it does splatter. (I let it boil a little longer,I like the rhubarb cooked up.)It smelled so good in the house,that My son who is 25 and my boyfriend had to tried it while it was warm.THEY LOVED IT TOO.This is a good recipe for new comers at making jam.The only thing that takes time is cutting the rhubarb. And i also cut it up small. Thanks for the recipe,I will be making more.Laurie

This is one of the best and easiest jams I have ever made. Maybe a tad on the sweet side so next time I may add about 1/2 cup less sugar otherwise it is perfect!

This jam was SO EASY to make. I used the rhubarb, sugar and fresh raspberries instead of a blueberry pie filing as we had so many raspberries in the garden and adding the jello is a touch of magic. Not only do we have a jam that everyone loves, the smell it left in the house is wonderful. I live in The UK and have been using this site to make so many wonderful things. Thank you for the ideas.

Best jam I ever made! Absolutely delicious. I did use 5 cups rhubarb and 3 cups chopped strawberries and decreased sugar to 2.5 cups. I boiled it more like 15-20 minutes. Has a great consistency and tastes soooo good! Was super easy to make too. Highly recommend!!

I made several substitutions to suit what I had on hand but the basic idea and flavors were still there. Instead of pie filling I used frozen blueberries. I had a handful (or two) of frozen raspberries and threw those in also. Cut the sugar almost by half because I love the rhubarb tartness. As for Jello, I had a box each of raspberry and black cherry. The color of the jam is just beautiful!! I water bath canned half pint jars for 10min. The jam is just SO delicious I'm glad it's still rhubarb season!!

This recipe was super easy! Really wonderful and a beautiful color when finished. The only thing I might do differently next time (there will definitely be a next time) is use a little less sugar! Thank you for posting!

Making my second batch with cherry pie filling, cherry & berry Jello and two cups of mixed frozen berries.  Followed the advise of others and used less sugar.  First batch was with blueberry pie filling, raspberry & berry jello, some mixed frozen berries and less sugar.  It is SO easy and great tasting--sweet with a hint of tartness.

I was so skeptical of this recipe when I found it here, but there were not a lot of options for rhubarb jam that didn't require strawberries or oranges and I was in desperate need of using up all the rhubarb overflowing in my kitchen, plus I happened to have all the ingredients on hand. It has been in my freezer for a few months now and each time I would pass it by and opt for our raspberry jam, but today I decided to try it. When I opened the jar, it still didn't look too appetizing, but looks can be deceiving. I thought this jam tasted great! It is sweet with a tiny hint of tartness. I will be keeping this treasure in my recipe box for the next rhubarb season.

Didn't have quite enough rubarb so I added some strawberries to make up the difference, otherwise followed the recipe.  We really liked this, and so did those who we shared it with.  I used as dessert topping over brownies and ice cream..YUM.  Thanks.

Absolutely delicious!  Everyone loved it. The only change I made was using all raspberry gelatin, since that's what I had on hand. I did the hot water bath so that it would last longer...I underestimated how popular it would be, though. It was gone almost as quickly as it was made, with several requests for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Oh my goodness, I love rhubarb, and was looking for something different to make with it besides a cake or pie.  This hit the spot.  It was SO easy to make, and it takes wonderful.  I forgot to add a box of the strawberry gelatin, and only added the raspberry gelatin.  It still turned out wonderful.  I'm ready to make this recipe again.  Five stars all the way

I made this twice. The first time followed the recipe and loved it but got comments like, it's too sweet and I can't taste the rhubarb. When I made the next batch I used (shockingly) rhubarb from our garden that we had frozen. I increased the rhubarb by two cups and decreased the sugar by a full cup. It turned out even better. It had a perfect tartness that the first batch was missing. I did water bath the jam both times just to be on safe side. Someone also gave me an idea of what to do with the jam that I am dying to try. Make a chocolate cake and use the jam between the two layers and ice with lemon cream cheese icing. I definitely I have to make more jam!

Did not have enough rhubarb for the full 8 cups so I made up the 1 to 1 1/2 cup deficit with cut-up strawberries. I cut the rhubarb in small pieces so the jam is not chunky except for the strawberries so I am glad they were in there. Good taste, texture is different due to the rhubarb which I like but my family is not yet convinced! Next time I would try adding some strawberries and fresh blueberries.

My daughter and I made several different jams last Saturday and this is our favorite so far.  This is so easy, the only thing to watch is to make sure the gelatin is fully dissolved before pouring into your containers for storing.

I am just finishing making this wonderful jam up now.  I have only had a few spoon fulls  but it is absolutely delicious!  When it says it is 64 servings I am assuming that they mean 1 ounce is a serving since I have jarred about 9-8 oz. jars.  I didn't change a thing to the recipe!  Yum, Yum!

This is officially the best jam I have ever made.  Like the others,I ate it out of the jar for a treat and when given away, I was immediately asked for more.  Thank you for such a delicious and easy recipe!!  Note: I did use some additional fresh fruit.

I've made this jam according to recipe for the past several years.  My family loves it.  I made some again this morning and decided to make another batch this afternoon....changed it up a little this time.  I used cherry rather than blueberry pie filling sinc that is what I had on hand, and used strawberry and raspberry jello for the same reason.  Both are excellent.  I'll definitely be making this again next year.

Absolutely delicious.  My neighbors now ask for it on a regular basis.  I have 3 different neighbors that give me rhubarb now.  I use splenda instead of sugar and it is perfect!!

This is exceptional.  I bought fresh rhubarb and chopped it and put it in freezer bags until I had time to make this.  It's hard to find in this area so you get it when you can.  It is so good! My guess is that you could use several careful combinations of fruit and gelatin with the rhubarb.

I saw pomegranate/blueberry jello and used 1pkg along with 1pkg of strawberry. It is very good. I also cut sugar to 2.5 cups.  Will be making another batch tomorrow (I have lots of rhubarb) for neighbors.

This jam is fantastic. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and only added 2 1/2C of sugar. It gave it a sweet tart flavor which I like. I also cooked it for 15-20 minutes.  I have made 3 batches of this jam. The 3rd batch I used a 3 berry pie filling which I really like. I will be making this again.

Very good taste!  I had a partial bag of frozen blueberries and mixed berries that I added to the pot.  I got 6 pints of jam!  YUM!
Got 7 pints  second batch.  Used frozen rhubarb, mulberries and strawberries.

I personally didn't care for the boxed jello flavor either but every single per that tasted it loved it. Was super easy and you can use some variations on the fruit. Last time I used some canned chopped peaches, rhubarb and the pie filling. Also I used less sugar, like 2 1/2 cups.

O.M.G.!  We just made this with 4 cups rhubarb, 4 cups blueberries, strawberry pie filling, and because I had a random pomegranate in the fridge threw that in as well. 2 1/2 cups sugar,and raspberry jello. Such a bright flavor tart and slightly sweet. I can't wait for my grandkids to have this. Thanks for sharing this recipe

This was so good. I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar. I used 32oz of strawberries, 5 stalks of rhubarb along with the blueberry filling. I added cinnamon, vanilla flavoring. I made this 2 weeks ago and is all gone. My husband and 3 children are requesting more.

Best jam I'm ever had! Everyone I've shared this with raves about it! Only thing I do different from original recipe is use 6-7 cups rhubarb and add 1 lb fresh strawberries. I also place the jam in sterile jelly jars and process in a water bath for 10-13 minutes so I can have jam any time I want and also give as gifts. Frozen rhubarb works great too. I have a lot of extra rhubarb at the end of the summer and love to freeze it and make jam in the winter.
