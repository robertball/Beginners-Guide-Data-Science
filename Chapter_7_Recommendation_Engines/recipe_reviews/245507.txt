It's missing celery, in  my opinion.  I added two finely chopped stalks.  I was only interested in GF mushroom soup, not the vegan ~ so I used chicken stock for the liquid.  It's sooo yummy, I could eat it as is, but I need it for a recipe on Easter Sunday. :)  Oh, and since the "canned soup" needed for the recipe is creamier, I ran it thru my blender to make it less chunky.

Love this soup!  I added a shallot and used only one can of coconut milk to have a thicker soup base for another recipe.  I also used chicken stock and used a full 8 ounce package of brown mushrooms.  A bit of smoked cheddar cheese garnish hits the spot.

I love this vegan soup! I followed the recipe except I substituted 1 cup of coconut milk with coconut cream,  not sure if it made any difference. It was quick, flavorful and easy. I will be making this on thanksgiving.

This was really yummy.  I had one can of coconut milk, so included that and substituted the rest with almond milk.  I also took someone else's advice and included celery with the onions and thyme.  I ate one bowl and, while I really liked it, I am planning to puree the rest and eat it with some sort of fresh herb, like cilantro.

This is Okay, needs a few more seasoning's I added some  garlic  to mine.  Still could use something else I'm just not sure what. Otherwise a great base recipe that you can add the flavor you want to.
