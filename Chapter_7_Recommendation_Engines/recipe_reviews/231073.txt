Cute idea. The right kind of sorghum is important here. Out of two tablespoons I ended up with only about 1/3 fully popped. I left out the sugar and the oil and just sprinkled it with cinnamon and enjoyed it. Certainly a good treat for those who can't eat popcorn. Thank you Ali Shircliff for your recipe.

This was a surprisingly tasty afternoon snack! Popped sorghum looks like mini popcorn! Update: I made this again for a party, and tried just cinnamon. Delicious!
