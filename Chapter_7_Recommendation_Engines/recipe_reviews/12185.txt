An AWFUL pie.  The measurements are incorrect.  12 apples is enough to make two pies.  8 TBS of cinnamon is incorrect - should it be 8 TSP?  The topping needs something else - perhaps some butter.  It doesn't combine with the pie - just burns on top.

I would rate it minus 1 but there isn't one. This measurements are totally off on this pie. You have enought here for almost 2-9" pies. Your mouth burns using this much cinammon. Not recommended at all; don't waste your time.

Okay, where to begin. First, perhaps it was because I was not using small apples, but I can't figure out how you would even get 12 apples into one pie shell. I have 1/2 of the apple mixture sitting in my refrigerator right now. I did reduce the amount of cinnamon. 2 tablespoons in the apple mixture, and 2 for the topping. Still though, the topping did not do what I imagined it would. I am not going to go to the trouble of making another crust, but I think I may go ahead and make up another batch of topping for the other half of apples sitting in my fridge, but add some margarine to it, and sprinkle it on top in a casserole and see what it does. My father-in-law, who loves apple pie never asked for seconds, or to keep some leftovers.

You can only fit about 6 apples into an apple pie, as for the rest of the ingredients in the pie... ugh!! It was like soup after it had finished and was so overwhelmed with cinnamon that you couldn't taste any other ingerdients.

CAUTION!! Don't make this! The ingredients and recipe make no sence. You only use between 2 and 6 apples for a regular or a mile high apple pie. Theres no way 12! apples could fit and You can NOt make an open face apple pie! It doesn't work, and 8 tb of cinnamon and a cup of brown sugar on top!

Just made it and eating it now. Not bad at all with ice cream. Kind of resembles a Cinnabon. Maybe 1/2 of the cinnamon next time (?). It had to bake almost an hour instead of the 25-30 minutes it said in the recipe.
