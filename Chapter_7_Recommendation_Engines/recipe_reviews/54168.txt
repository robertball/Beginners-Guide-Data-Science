A smoked salmon plate is often found on restaurant breakfast menus and is traditionally served with a bagel, cream cheese, thinly sliced tomato and onion, finely chopped hard-boiled egg and...capers, which add just a little piquant tanginess. So the addition of capers in this spread is a natural, as is the dill. However, 2 T. of dill is just way too much. I used 1 T. and it was still too artificially green and "dilly." I used fresh chives and would have preferred fresh dill too (the market didn't have any that day). All in all, the spread was good, but not great. The final word is, definitely include the capers, use fresh chives, fresh dill and a lot less of it, and this spread will be much improved, both in taste and appearance.

I made this for a BBQ and it was a hit. The only alterations I made to the recipe was omitting the capers. I found that the saltiness of the capers and salmon can be a bit much. Otherwise, great quick and easy recipe. I'll definately make it again.

I found like a previous reviewer that it was a bit salty, as well as a bit thick.  Salved both problems with the addition of a 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt.  EXCELLENT.

This was an awesome spread. I had some leftover grilled salmon and was looking for a different way to use it.  I did make some changes after reading the other reviews. I used fresh dill and fresh garlic chives. I also added 2 heaping Tablespoons of Sour Cream and let marinate overnight. Served it with fresh lemon wedges and toasted mini bagels and baguettes. Was a huge hit. I may add some chopped green onions next time I make this. Thanks for sharing!

Lots of compliments on this spread - didn't have dried chives but it still tasted great.

I did not have any smoked salmon on hand so used canned salmon instead.  Turned out wonderful!  I loved it on Ritz crackers but I also used it in celery sticks which was fabulous!  Thanks so much for a new (and well-loved already) snack.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and again for a party a few weeks ago.  It has always dissappeared quickly!  Even people who don't typically like fish end up loving this dish.  I definitely recommend making this the day before; the flavors set in wonderfully overnight.

This was good- pretty tangy at first, but it was a huge hit w/ the in-laws and friends:) We always buy Albertson's Salmon dip, so I am excited to have a cheaper/healthier recipe of my own. I think you could probably adapt this recipe pretty easily. I think I will alter it from extremely dill-y to a bit peppery. Great just the way the recipe says though!!!

I love dill but 2 tablespoons is overkill.

Pretty good recipe.  I took the advice of another viewer and used fresh dill and chives.  I will probably make this again.

This is really good. I didn't change a thing, but next time I might decrease the capers just a little bit. I know I'll be making it again.

I cold smoked some salmon this weekend in my Kamado Joe  and made this recipe with some of it. Let me start off by saying I made this recipe as written but added 3/4 cup of sour cream to it and subbed green onions for the scallions in the recipe cause that's what I had on hand.

I let the recipe sit overnight in the fridge and it was awesome!
