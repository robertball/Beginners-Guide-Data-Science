Surprisingly delicious for such a simple, easy preparation. I made it exactly as described, and we ate it as an appetizer. It’s good as is or with dip.

I added fresh tomatoes and about a pound of sliced mushrooms.  The family loved it. Served with some feta for added protein.

Delish! Along with the other reviews I too added garlic and I didn’t have any basil so added teaspoon of oregano and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds.5 minutes before finishing I added canned chick peas and some baby spinach. Definitely make this again.

This was delicious! I added two heaping tablespoons of minced garlic to the oil and spices and baked the dish for 45 minutes instead of 30 because I like it more browned. I also added Parmesan cheese over the whole thing at about 37 minutes. My husband and I both loved it and I will be making it again.

Turned out great. Used Mexican oregano instead of basil and about a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt. Chopped one large cloves of garlic to add some additional flavor.
