Hi everyone, I didn't realized my recipe made it here.  Just a note: You can store the green pepper mixture in a tupperware in the fridge for up to 3 weeks and use it whenever sofrito or onion etc is needed.  In place of achiote you can use saffron or azafaron.  These are cuban spices.

This dish was EXCELLENT. NOTE: I DID NOT USE A PRESSURE COOKER. I just don't have one, but I think it was better because I could simmer it for 1 1/2-2 hrs and let the meat get tender some steam escape,and the mmmm... Gravy form. My husband (Mexican) loved it, ALTHOUGH, he insists its actually a Mexican Dish..;)LOL. Anyhow, my kitchen never smelled so good. Thanks so much for the Recipe. Its a Keeper!!!!!

Excellent Cuban recipe.  The only change to make it authentic is not to blend the vegetables.  Leave them in 1" strips.  Also, you'll want to add frozen peas.  One tip: serve in the sauce.  Do not drain it.  Allow everyone to serve themselves so they can get as much sauce as they want.

This recipe is pretty spot on. I've been making this forever. When you grow up Cuban it is mandatory to know this recipe. I just wanted to let everyone know that achiote is just yellow coloring. The spice in it won't make or break your recipe. Follow this recipe (plus or minus the water amount - you'll only know after the first try) and add the yellow food coloring last. Add 5-7 drops. Like mom said 'al ojo' which means eyeball it. Additionally, if you do find that your recipe is too watery then add about a teaspoon of cornstarch. My mom has also thickened it by grating about 1/8 of a potato. Again, not an accurate measurement. Apparently when she grew up measuring spoons and cups were just a new fad they never thought would catch on.

This worked well using my slow cooker while I was gone for the day.  We opened the door to a lovely aroma!

This was very tasty  and fairly easy to make.  I served it over steamed rice and my husband really liked it.  The Oriental/Filipino market in our area has the Achiote powder.  It's called Mama Sita's Annatto All-Natural Food Color.  I read the other reviews and cut the water down to two cups and I added the potatoes towards the end and cooked it another 5 minutes in the pressure cooker.  It still had a lot of liquid left so I think next time I'll cut it down to 1 1/2 cups water instead of 4.

The broth for this dish is EXCELLENT.  I will use it for many other types of stew.  Let me say, however, that I did not use a pressure cooker (don't have one), and I did not add achiote powder (have no idea what that is).  We had unexpected company for dinner just as the dish was done, and everyone -- all 8 of them -- LOVED it.  They loved the broth the most.  (I used venison rather than beef, and about 6 potatoes rather than 2.)  I served it with a side of freshly baked sourdough bread, and apple dumplings(recipe found here)for dessert.

I loooove my Cuban Mother-in-Law's Carne con Papas, but, Darn it, she will not make them on-demand....
This came sooooo close to my Mother-in-Law's, that the first time I made it my husband thought I had frozen some of his mom's Carne con Papas and defrosted it for dinner.  
I have made mine many times in the slow cooker, High setting 5 hours. For those of you that find this bland, you have to realize that cuban food is not meant to be spicy like mexican food. Otherwise, there is plenty of flavor here.

Very good recipie and done the traditional way.  If you are in a spanish community, you can use "Cooking Wine" instead of white.  You can also make this in a dutch oven and just cook about an hour or two.  It pretty much like beef stew.  Like in any other culture, there is usually very few measurements in cooking Cuban food, we ususally eyeball it.  Also, if you like, you can add green olives and bay leaves.

We really looked forward to this one. There are so few pressure cooker recipes on this resource.The reviews made us yearn. Sadly we could not have been more disappointed.Achiote not found, we used Annato,(search engine says it is same(?).We used red sangria wine as were out of white.Recipe divides salt but does not use 2nd half (we tossed it in). No way that all the liquid (5 cups) would fit in the 3/4 safety zone of pressure cooker. We cut back to 3 cups water(still was too much).We used powdered bouillon instead of cubes. Our opinion Color=EXC. Taste=Bland  Texture=Too thin and a little oily, (We thickened with flour to little avail). We used 3 cubed potatos and they were terribly overcooked after the 40 min. at 15 lbs pressure.The blended trinity of bell pepper, garlic & onion was exciting and we will utilize that method in further stew/chili/soup concoctions.We just need to find a better flavor spice base and will keep trying. If the stuff had worked we were gonna call it Guantanamo Stew.

This recipe won me over with its authenticity to a Cuban dish.  Very good stuff, however, I did make some changes because some things were strange to me and I can see how one person thought the potatoes came out overdone. Ok, first of all...cannot find achiote powder? Why not try this.  Skip the salt and use Sazon Goya (Cuban seasoning packets) that include Azafran (food coloring).  If your local supermarket carries it, you will find it in the ethnic isle.  I halved the recipe and used about 1/4 of the packet, given it can carry a kick. Feel free to add more or less to suit your taste.  Use food coloring when all else fails.  Ok, now here are the changes.  1. The pressure cooker time given here and in my instruction booklet I felt was too much so I put in the water, meat and bullion cubes (given that bullion cubes are different, make sure to use as much as it indicates for the water you put in)into the pressure cooker for 20 min. and it was already cooked throughout.  You can always add more water and put it back on if its not done.  2. While the meat was cooking, I diced the bell pepper and onion and sauted in a small frying pan with the olive oil until it was soft.  I put on simmer and added the tomato sauce, minced garlic (I use pre-minced garlic in a jar) and the spices.  3. When the meat was done, I added in the cooking white wine and potatoes that I cut up in small chunks so that they are ready quickly. Now its a 5/5!

I have to admit, that as a Cuban from Miami, I had low expectations. I was so pleasantly surprised! This had great flavor and texture and was pretty easy to make. I got rave reviews from 9 people at dinner, and everybody (from the 10-month-old baby to the picky 9- and 11-year-olds to the grandparents) loved this! This will definitely be in my go-to recipe file!!! I made the recipe exactly as stated, and don't think I'd change a thing when making it again!

Excellent recipe.  We're Colombian so this kind of meal reminds us of home because it's similar to our dishes.  For anyone who cannot find achiote, just go to the Latino or Mexican section of your grocery store and buy the achiote packets from Goya, they're usually in an orange box and some even say "achiote & cilantro".  Anyway, that's what I used, 1 packet = 1 tablespoon.  I added two more russet potatoes because just two is not enough.  Also, the amount of water is just right, you want this to be a little soupy because it's not supposed to be a thick stew but more of a "sancocho" which is watery/soupy.

This was great although next time I will use only 4 cups of water for 12 servings instead of 8. I also added the potatoes at the end and cooked till soft.

This was delicious!  I cut down the water to 2 cups, added about 2 tablespoons of corn starch to a little bit of cold water and mixed it into the sauce before cooking, and put everything into the slow cooker for the day, as I do not have a pressure cooker.  The meat was so tender!  Next time I'll add some frozen peas, too!

I've made carne con papa before and never has it been this delicious!  The only thing I did different was that I added a little bit of fresh culantro to the green pepper mixture and I used Goya seasoning packets that have achiote. A must have recipe for my collection.

This dish was good, if a little too tomato-ey. I would substitute a fresh tomato, and fresh beef stock.

wow! This was delicious... i made a few changes.. first, when i tried to blend the "sofrito" ingredients it didn't work out so well so it was semi chunky when i started the sautee process. I did not have a pressure cooker so I cooked this on the stove top for an hour and 15 mins or so. I only used 5 bouillon cubes and reduced the water by half a cup... still way too much liquid, I think next time I will reduce it to 2 1/2 cups of water. I thickened it towards the end with some flour just enough. Served this over white rice (can't be beat) and made plantains on the side (fried) My husband and 4 year old really enjoyed it.. and my four year old never eats rice, but this was gone!! thanks for the recipe!!

Growing up my mom made this recipe as well.  She also blended the pepper, onion, and garlic.  The only difference is that she used paprika, olives, capers instead of cumin and achiote

This is a wonderful recipe. The reviews were helpful. We used half the water and just let it simmer covered in a pot for a few hours vs a pressure cooker. Also we used 5 potatoes vs two. It was served with rice. Needless to say there were no left overs. Will make this again and again.

This was good. I had everything on hand. I added green beans. I served it over rice. It reminded me of a beef stew. I will make again sometime.

We used turmeric instead of achiote and it was still fantastic!

This is a very good recipe with easy to understand directions.  The potatoes however should be added near the end of the cooking time.

Tastes really good, but would like to perhaps marinate beef next time so that the flavors infuse more fully.  Also, I think something is missing, but not sure what.  Maybe some added heat would help.

This was the best dinner I've ever made! I used the exact ingredients as the recipe stated - wasn't spicy, but full of flavor. I don't have a pressure cooker, so I just cooked it in a stock pot on low to med low heat for 1.5 hrs. I served it with white rice and black beans. Will def make again - super easy!

I love this recipe although I do think it is way too much water and too many beef bouillons... makes it very salty... I use alot let water and about 2 bouillons, maybe 3... other than that it is delicious and i love soft potatoes with my carne con papas...

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly, even making a trip to the store just to get the achiote powder which i found with no problem in the latin/mexican food section.This was very soupy but thickened up nicely after 2.5 hrs of simmering. Cooked in a regular pot with no problem as i do not have a pressure cooker. The only thing i would do different next time is to add a jalepeno to the pepper/onion mixture. I thought it desperatley needed some heat. I will keep this recipe handy. We really liked it :)

A good old meat and potatoes stew.  Taste was excellent, but I did cut the water out almost completely.  Served over rice.  The local Asian grocery store had the achiote, although I had to grind the seeds myself.  Its sold in a yellow package under the brand name "D&D Gold Products Corp." Santa Ana, California.

This meal was great!  I used a stock pot as I didn't have a pressure cooker and simmered for 1 hr 45 min.  The beef was so tender and so flavorful!  I added some alcaparrado (olives) to the mixture and made flavored rice with sofrito and beans.  It was excellent, I am an a picky picky eater.  My Puerto Rican husband also loved it!!

This recipe was tasty, but it came out like soup and I had to simmer it for an additional 60 minutes to get it to more of a meat and sauce kind of consistency.  Unfortunately, by that time, the meat was more of a thickening agent than a recognizable component.

I used a pressure cooker and left out the anciote and bullion (I didn't have any) and it turned out well. It's just not one of my favorites.

Oh my, this was so GOOD.  We all really loved it, including my 3-year-old.  I doubled the safrito and froze half for next time.  I had Achiote, which really does add more than coloring!  It has a very mild but distinctive addition to dishes in my opinion.  Thank you for posting!  I followed this to the letter and it was perfect for a pressure cooker-the old fashioned kind, not an insta-pot.  Instapot users may need to adjust the liquid.  This would probably work well in a crockpot, but something about the old fashioned pressure cooker really melds the flavors together so well.

This is a delicious dinner I ate while growing up in Miami. We made it for the first time here in Texas. We used ribeye and ny strip stew meat cut by our butcher at Sam’s and the meat fell apart. We eliminated the tomato sauce this time but on the next batch we’ll include it. Don’t think it can taste any better but we’ll see. To be continued....

I made it! And it was just amazing the taste was perfect just how I remember it when I was a kid. My husband wanted carrots so I added carrots but other than that just as the recipe went minus the pressure cooker took about and hour in a half.

This was super easy to make. Already had homeade sofrito on hand so used that in place of pepper/garlic. The rest is pretty standard. Also threw in a packet of Sazon. Served over jasmine rice with a Caesar salad and fried plantains (platanos maduros) and that was a meal! Will make again

This was fantastic. It was a hit with the entire family, even the picky ones. I didn't have achiote powder so I substituted it with Sazon Goya seasoning which I shockingly found in my spice drawer.  I also only had one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce so I used an 8 oz. can of diced tomatoes in place of the second can. I used around 2 cups of water based on other suggestions and it came out perfect. My only issue with the recipe is it calls for 2 potatoes but doesn't say how to prepare them so I just chopped them into small cubes.  Served it over rice. Will definitely make again.

This is absolutely delicious. I took another person's advice and used venison instead of beef. However, I cut the recipe in half, cooked all ingredients on the stove top until done and then added a quart jar of home-canned venison at the end and gently turned into the sauce. The only other change was that I sprinkled some saffron into the mix since I did not have achiote. Will definitely make this again! Thank you!

This Carne con Papas was easy to make and delicious! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and only used 1 1/2 cups of water and it was the perfect soupy consistency to pour over a nice bowl of rice. Other than the water, there is nothing I would change. My family loved it and we will be making it again!

Great Recipe!  I made two changes... (1) more potatoes!  How can you call it carne con PAPAS if you use only two potatoes.  (2) Cut back on the achiote and cumin... half the amount called for in this recipe did just fine!   Thanks!!!

Delicious flavor. Used to live all over Florida, now live in San Diego which has pretty much no Cuban food :( every bite brought back different memories of my time in Florida. I do think that this had WAY too much water so I will cut it to maybe a cup or cup and half. I also didn't use a pressure cooker. I browned the meat and then boiled it in the sofrito and seasoning/sauces for an hour and half. I will for sure cook this again!

I didn't use a pressure cooker. I just let it simmer for 3 hours and it smelled amazing. It was delicious. The beef was so soft and just fell apart. Used all the ingredient listed. I really like blending the vegetables so the "picky" eaters don't see them. I had some leftovers and you know it ALWAYS taste better the next day.

Love this recipe I've made it several times without a pressure cooker and I've used pork chops instead of beef; just let  it simmer until the meat is tender; also great substituting the potatoes with butternut squash or sweet potatoes

I fixed this in an electric pressure cooker (Instant Pot  IP-DO60). I set it for 45 minutes. If your wanting to eat this over rice its way to think. The consistency is almost like thick soup. If you want to pour it over rice i probably would reduce the water by at least a cup (if not more). That being said the taste was fantastic (and is why i'm giving it 5 stars). My wife actually preferred it like this. I offered to thicken up the left overs but she preferred it soupier. So we just at are rice as a side. The only small change i made was to use red potatoes rather than white because i prefer my potatoes whole and not falling apart. The red potatoes were almost falling apart by that point.

This recipe was amazing. My picky 7 year old gobbled it up without complaining! I made it last year and it was too watery, but yesterday I made it again (3 servings). The recipe said 2 cups of water and I only used half a cup because the wine is liquid also. Everything else in followed exactly, except the achiote powder which I didn't have and read it wasn't necessary. Also did it on the stove because I don't have a pressure cooker. It took 1.5-2 hours for potatoes to soften. Next time I will add some corn at the end. Yummmm
Oh.... I didn't divide the salt because I doesn't tell you what to do with the 2nd half lol. 
Excellent recipe, excellent taste

Pressure cooker is the way to go. Next time I will use less water. Very delicious over white rice with strips of red peppers on the rice.

I'm in the process of making this recipe right now, and so far, I'm really liking it!  I don't have a pressure cooker, so have it cooking on the stove.  The blended bell pepper and onion mixture was awesome!  I'll definitely use it in other recipes.  I couldn't find Achiote powder, but did find dried Achiote in the same section of the grocery store that I find dried corn husks and other El Guapo products.  I took the dried Achiote and ground it in my spice grinder.  So, now it's all simmering on the stove.  I haven't added the potatoes yet but will add them during the last 1/2 hour or so.  I'll be adding 4 instead of 2.  I've tasted the sauce, and it's amazing!  I'm sure when it's done it will be an awesome dish, and I will make it again.  Is this dish typically served on rice?  I don't think I will be doing that, but am curious about that.  I'll be serving it with some nice crusty bread.

very delicious! I am hispanic so this dish is a staple in our culture. It was my first time making it and I followed the recipe, except I did not have the bouillons, but it still tasted delicious. I will definitely be making this again and next time add the bouillons and see how that goes!
