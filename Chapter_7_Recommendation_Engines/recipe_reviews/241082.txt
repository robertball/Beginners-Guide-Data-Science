This was an excellent recipe- and a great use for some of the apple butter I made last month.  I made it exactly as written and it doesn't need any changes. Ours wasn't too sweet at all, the only problem I had was my starch slurry didn't set in time to serve and I ended up using package pork gravy thinned and mixed with some of the "bits" from the crockpot. I served with mashed potatoes and brussels gratin. Yum, this is definitely a keeper!

A super simple meal which made according to the recipe which produced a very moist roast and a good amount of gravy.  Thank you, Helen Dubo!  

I will make it again but with a few adjustments. They are:  browning the roast first after seasoning with salt & pepper, doubling the onion, garlic and thyme, eliminating the rosemary entirely and reducing the broth by at least a third. Also, rather than using a corn starch slurry to thicken the gravy, I will use a blend of soft butter & flour and add to juices after roast has been removed for carving. Will need to cook the gravy a bit longer on high to thicken and to eliminate any raw flour taste. This can also be done in a separate saucepan if desired.

I really really enjoyed this! I used a Smithfield® Pork Sirloin roast that was only about 2 lbs. I kept all of the other ingredients the same, but cooked it in a 225 degree oven for about 5 hours. I did as the submitter suggested and added a cornstarch slurry to make a gravy with the sauce. I served this with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. My husband and kids thought it was too sweet (from the apple butter), but I loved it, and seeing as I am the one that cooked it and I am the one reviewing it, I give it 5 stars!

I made this for a work potluck where the theme was "Apple Festival."  This was the main meat dish. I work night shift so I set it up (which was supper easy), throwing all the ingredients in the slow cooker, and turned it on low the morning before the potluck. By the time we came back that evening it had cooked 11 hours. By the time we actually were able to eat it, it had cooked 14 hours. Some of the outer edges were a little tough (over cooked, I guess), but the inner part was still very moist and lovely.  Despite the apple butter, rosemary and thyme, it wasn't as fragrant as I would have expected. I'm thinking about adding extra cinnamon (in addition to the cinnamon that is already in the Apple butter) next time. But the dish was very well received by my coworkers and it was all gone by the time I went to clean my slow cooker in the morning.

Pork was very tender but it did not have much flavor.  Too bland.

I thought it would be more flavoured than it was. My hubby didn't care for it and he loves meat. I did add garlic as well but still pretty bland.

My pork loin was slightly smaller than what was called for. The taste was good, but the cooking time was far too long. Came out very dry. May try again,  but will definitely adjust the cooking time.

Got a great deal on a 2 1/2 lb pork loin.  Made this in my Instant Pot pressure cooker pretty much as written. I did add potatoes on the side and cut up an apple to cook on top of roast. Cooked 35 minutes at high pressure. Came out just lovely with a nice apple taste that was light & not sweet. So easy & good. Nice flavor of thyme & rosemary.

What a wonderful dish. I even made baked cinnamon apples to serve with the pork loin. The whole family loved it.

Browned the pork loin first, and it came out delicious. My family loved it.

This is really good.  I did brown the pork loin first and then put everything over top. I baked it in the oven for about 2 hours at 350°. It was perfect!  Will definitely be making again.

It was t awful but it was odd. People suggested a pan gravy. It was terrible. I played with the gravy a little and made it edible but I doubt I will be making this again.

I didn't read the note about the slurry but would certainly do that next time.  The "gravy" needed to be thicker.  I would remove the rosemary before serving.  Although I think it added flavor, there were too many pieces of rosemary "floating" in the sauce and you just can't eat that.  Shredded and served with mash potatoes.  Easy and good.  It wasn't overly sweet so I liked it - wouldn't say that it was too "plain".

I have made this dish several times. I have found the addition of mushrooms in the last 30 min or so, is a quite tasty addition. I also like a good amount of sauce with my meat, so I always use the whole jar of the apple butter. It ends up being about 1 Cup in total. I found this recipe to be successful, and very tasty, the way it is; but also very versatile. Thank you for sharing!

Meat cooked much faster than recommended slow cooking time. Dry and chewy.
