Wow!  This is not only good, but good for you.  I love finding new ways to use wheat germ and this was perfect. I wouldn't have found this recipe if it wasn't for Pam-3BoysMama's Blog "Formerly Faceless Recipes". I toasted the walnuts (toasted nuts always seems to taste better) and other than adding a bit of cinnamon this recipe makes a great breakfast - and a really filling one at that!

Awesome! tasty and good for you! I used steel cut oatmeals, 2T brown sugar and toasted the walnuts. Instead of orange juice concentrate I used the juice from the mandarin oranges. I loved the sweetness of the mandarin oranges, as its not too sweet or acidity. I really liked the slight "tang" from the dried sweetened cranberries. The walnuts? They added a nice texture to the oatmeal - "crunch" factor. Toasting the walnuts helped to bring out their flavors. The sweet mandarin oranges, cranberries, and walnuts all worked well together in this breakfast. Delicious, hearty and wonderfully satisfying!

A nice change from plain oatmeal & yogurt that I usually eat. I omitted the oranges since I didn't want to open a can just for this (I made this single-serving). Easy to throw together since I had everything on hand. I stirred in some plain yogurt to make it creamier and found it didn't need the brown sugar then. Also toasted the nuts in the microwave while this cooked. --The orange flavor is definitely understated, but I actually prefer that.

This is so good! I thought the orange flavor would overpower the oatmeal, but it did not. These flavors work well together. I toasted my walnuts before adding to the oatmeal. I will definitely be making this again!

Great base recipe! I skipped the can of mandarins since I didn't have any on hand. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, a healthy dash of cinnamon, and used 3 teaspoons of brown sugar. Turned out delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I love oatmeal and it's one of my usual breakfast cereal, and this recipe is delicious and brings a new flavor to it. I modified the recipe as follows:
- used quick oats, put it in a bowl, added some of the juice from the canned mandarins and water, and microwaved for 1 min;
- added walnuts, raisins and some of the mandarins;
- served to hubby (who doesn't really like oatmeal), and he asked for it the following day too.
Great recipe, thanks Jenni Oyler.

Halved the recipe. Used lemon juice instead of the orange concentrate, extra brown sugar, skipped the nuts, used toasted semi-ground flax instead of the bran and added 1/2 teaspoon of a pie spice blend. My little one and I liked it.

Wow! I am so glad they featured this as one of the recipes of the day! This oatmeal is absolutley delicious. I followed the recipes exactly, except only made 1 serving and used sliced almonds instead of walnuts because it's all I had in the cupboard. Great recipe, will make often, thanks for sharing!

Used toasted pecans instead of walnuts. Used the juice from the mandarin oranges , added a bit of vanilla extract, and reduced the sugar.

I was very pleasantly suprised with this recipe.  Because I don't usually care for canned mandarin oranges, I wasn't sure how I would like this, but they really work in this recipe.  The sweet oranges, tangy cranberries, and chewy oats are perfect together.  I have already made this several times and will continue to make it.  Thanks!

I made this for my boys this morning and it was a HUGE hit. My boys had a little warmed homemade maple syrup on top and a little fat free half-n-half. I had a bite and thought it was excellent. NOTE: I did omit the brown sugar and I added about a half teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.
