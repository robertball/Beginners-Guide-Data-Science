I've made this several times (even prior to Chef John posting it).  This is one of my "go-to" recipes.  

Here are the two simple KEYS to this recipe turning out well:  

1)  DO NOT overcook your potatoes; they should be cooked until just tender, yet they should still be slightly firm.  If you overcook them, they'll fall apart. You aren't making mashed potatoes!   2)  DO NOT press down (or "pound") on the potatoes too heavily.  If the recipe doesn't turn out as expected, your technique was wrong.  Try, try again!

Smashing the potatoes was so much fun, that it's easy to get all the kids to help and keep distracted. I recommend adding sage to the butter if you have any. It was a hit for thanksgiving dinner.

My husband found this recipe on YouTube and made enough yummy noises that I decided to give it a try. I substituted a pinch of dried herbs for the fresh and cut back a bit of the salt. They were easy enough to make any time and we will definitely add these to our regular meal rotation!

Not sure I'd make this again. Despite following the directions, every potato fell apart when pounded and transferred to the baking sheet. They did taste good, however, even though they looked less than appetizing.

They didn’t come out as good as Chef John’s did but boy did they taste amazing. I think I need to smash them thinner next time.
