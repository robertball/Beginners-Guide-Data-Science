I made muffins instead of a loaf, and ended up with 12 delicious muffins baked at 350ºF for about 23 minutes.  I did add a splash of OJ to the batter and replaced some of the water in the glaze with OJ which boosted the orange flavor and resulted in a really nice glaze.  The muffins were plenty moist, firm but not dense, and had layer upon layer of interesting  flavors.  A couple of comments on the instructions for a novice baker.  Be sure your sticks of spread are at room temperature for ease of mixing/creaming.  I’d also recommend adding the cranberries & orange peel to the banana mixture, then mix all of your dry ingredients together before adding to the banana mixture to be sure you get good distribution of ingredients in the batter.  These muffins made me think of Fall and the upcoming Holidays.  Would make again.

I did make some changes (dreaded words, I know). I substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour and used only 1 1/2 cup of white. I used 2 sticks of butter, not the butter spread. Other ingredients I followed the instructions, but I would recommend rehydrating the dried cranberries in boiling water for 5 minutes and then draining. Also, cream your butter, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl, combine dry ingredients in a small bowl. I alternated dry ingredients and mashed bananas into the sugar mixture then added cranberries and zest last. I have not tried the orange glaze, but it sounds yummy! Labor intensive, yes, but this bread smells DELICIOUS baking, and is very moist and tasty. Worth a try! Great Fall bread.

I really enjoyed this bread! So many layers of flavor. I did soak my dried cranberries in boiling water for about 5 minutes, drained and then folded them in at the end. I also used OJ in place of the water in the glaze. The glaze really adds a lot of flavor, so I would not recommend skipping it!

I like all the flavors that were used in the bread, but, together they seemed a little off to me.  I think for me that the pumpkin pie spice seemed to fight the flavor of the bananas.    My husband liked it, but, did say he preferred my regular banana bread.   That being said, the bread was perfectly moist and cooked in the exact time the recipe stated.   I did add orange juice instead of water to the glaze and thought it gave it a nice orange flavor.

Yes, I’ve made this cranberry orange Pumpkin spice Banana bread, possibly 10 times maybe more. It’s the best yummy bread ever!!! We all just love it so much and I’m asked to make it for parties. It’s easy to make, and looks so delicious on the serving dish. Great reviews every time I’ve made it...

Its not sweet enough for me. The second time i added an extra 1 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and it was way better. I also doubled on the pumpkin spice.

I used some of the juice from the orange in the glaze instead of the melted spread resulting in a great orange glaze!

This is definitely a keeper! My family loved it! Will keep making for the holidays. I just added a little lemon extract on the batter and on the glaze.

I found the pumpkin pie spice to be overwhelming, I think 1 tsp would be better. The glaze made the bread. I used orange juice in place of the water.
