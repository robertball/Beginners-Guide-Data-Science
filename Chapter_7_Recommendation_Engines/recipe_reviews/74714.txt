These were wonderful. My only complaint is that cooking/mashing the squash left the batter too moist (because the squash takes on water, which only gets worse if you boil it too long!), and that in turn made the puffs greasier. My suggestion would be to either add more flour/cornmeal, OR only puree the *raw* squash and use that instead of the cook/mashed squash (use 2 cups of puree just like 2 c. of the mash). I've tried this with zucchini and it worked wonderful. Also, if you want to use something in place of Jiffy cornbread mix: 2 T. of sugar, an extra tsp. of baking powder (3 tsp. total), up the salt by 1/4 tsp. (1 tsp. total), and use 2/3 c. cornmeal (or a cornmeal/white flour mix if that is too "corny" for you).

Oh my goodness. Made these last night and my boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating them as they came out of the frying pan. I chopped my onion and boiled it with the squash for 10 minutes. Used self-rising flour so I left out the salt and baking powder. These were to die for and I'm already trying to decide what I can do next time to give them a little "kick." You will not be disappointed with this recipe.

This is really good!  When I made this, I kept all the ingredients exactly the same, but changed a bit of the way they were used.  Instead of simmering and mashing the squash, I grated it just like the onion, and then instead of deep frying, just sauteing, with 2 tablespoons of butter. Somewhat like a  pancake, loosely speaking.  While it isn't puffy like a deep-fried fritter, it was quite good and with a little less in the fat calorie column.  The fat content is the only reason I didn't give a full five stars, but that is just a personal thing.  Thanks for a great idea!

My family loved this recipe! I modified it by using sauteed PictSweet Seasoning Blend in the place of the onion. I also found that the squash peel did not soften adequately after cooking, so I picked as much of it out as I could before adding the dry ingredients. Next time, I will remove the peel before mashing. These puffs were like hushpuppies, leading us to refer to them as "squashpuppies." Delicious!

If I could give this 10 stars I would. I only had dried chopped onions, so I cooked them with the squash and pureed them all together. I took others' advice and added a little garlic powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I had planned on taking these to a potluck, so I tried them out on the crew of college age house painters working on my house first. They loved them, so I took them to the potluck. I let my son and his friend each try one in the car and they took a "vote" to eat all the puffs in the car and not even take them in to share. This from a boy who gags on cooked summer squash! I over-rode their vote and got several requests for the recipe! Thanks!

I've tried many Summer squash recipes from this site and this one is a keeper.  Fattening I'm sure, but very tasty we thought.  I followed another reviewers advice and added garlic powder and 1 c. shredded cheddar cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were absolutely delicious!  I didn't have corn muffin mix, so I used plain corn meal and it was fine.  I also added fresh garlic.  Be careful to make them smaller though...they tend to be wet inside if they're too big.

I didn't have enough oil to deep fry this time, so they weren't as puffy and light as I expected, but the flavor was very good. Next time I'll use the deep fryer.

These were fabulous! Even the kids loved the "Squash Puppies." A nice departure from roasted and sauted squash.

If you like hushpuppies, you will love these! They were awesome! We have an abundance of squash and was a bit sick of grilled and sauteed. This was just what I wanted. I followed the directions except used self-rising instead of all-purpose and cut the salt by at least half. Added a bit of garlic powder and omitted the onion because I didn't have one. We will make these again this weekend for a party. Can't wait!

These were excellent! Didn't change anything except I sauted them instead of deep frying and used egg whites insted of whole eggs. Thank you for sharing this winning recipe!

Ever since moving to "the south" 12 years ago, I have been trying to find a good recipe for hush puppies. I've tried at least two dozen recipes, and haven't found a keeper. Last night, I decided to try this recipe, since we have an over-abundance of summer squash. When my husband tried one, he said "Oh my god, these are the BEST hushpuppies I've ever had. You HAVE to keep this recipe." That is when I told him they were not actually hush puppies but summer squash puffs. They were soooo good, we couldn't stop eating them. My husband even went back to get more after dinner to have as his "dessert". I made this recipe exactly as written, except I used a whole box of Jiffy cornbread mix, rather than just 2/3 of a cup. I will definitely be making these all summer!

OMGOODNESS!!! This was so tasty. I made a double batch of these. I added 1/2 tsp of garlic and 2 cups of cheddar cheese. With the last 10 puffs, I added 1/2 cup of corn. The taste was good but I didn't like picking deep-fried corn kernels out of my teeth.

I made a few changes based on what ingredients I had on hand. First, I used butternut, rather than summer squash. Second, I left out the onion. Also I substituted garlic salt in place of the regular and corn meal for muffin mix.   The biggest change I made was to pan fry rather than deep fry, to cut out some of the calories. Simply sprayed my skillet with a little Pam and dropped by teaspoon fulls. Flattened a bit and flipped. Since I cooked them this way, they were more like Squash Pancakes than puffs (think potato pancake texture).   Either way, they were fantastic! I made a half batch, and using about a tsp for each, I made 30 puff/pancakes.

These were great.  The kids loved them.  I will definitely make them again.  I did "mash" the squash in my food processor.  It made quick work of the skins which didn't want to mash like everything else.  These would be great with cheese, too.

I added the suggested garlic, also a bit of seasoning salt and extra flower.  I only used half the batch the first day and found out that the batter worked much better on day 2!  So let the batter sit several hours.  I made them small but they were still wet inside.  Next time I will remove the liquid after steaming the squash/zucchini & onions. They were actually quite lovely though - crispy outside & fluffy inside, like little clouds that melt on your tongue!

These were very good.  My husband normally does not like squash but he ate these.  It probably helped that they were fried!  My dough was a bit runnier than I expected, so they were more like little blobs instead of rounded puffs.  I might use more flour or muffin mix next time so the dough is firmer and hopefully keeps a nice shape.

I knew what I was getting into when the ingredient list begins with 1 quart of oil.  But these little puffs did tend to soak a lot of it up (even with very hot oil), thereby making it a far cry from a healthy snack.  That said, I am sure that is not the intent of this recipe.  After frying the first batch using the recommended tablespoon, I switched to teaspoons.  The recipe yields way too many for a family of two, and I thought smaller ones would make a nicer treat to take to work and share with others.  Next time, I would probably up the dry ingredients a bit, as the batter was more like pancake than puff.  I gave four stars because they are a guilty but scrumptious pleasure.

Yum! Instead of cooking the squash I ended up just microwaving them for a few minutes and then puree in the food processor. I then let it sit in a fine mesh strainer to drain. I strained out about 1 cup of liquid! When I mixed it all together it was perfectly moist and held together well while frying. I added cheese like other suggested and only used corn meal and sugar in place of corn bread mix (didn't have any). Very yummy!

Delicious! I added 2/3cup sharp cheddar and sauted my onion before adding it. Will add garlic next time. I like to have mine for breakfast with cheese grits. This will be my staple squash recipe.

My family loved these. They are light, fluffy and very tasty. I've made them twice and the second time I diced a fresh jalapeno and added it to the batter.  Very nice kick without being overly spicy.  I am going to try it with zucchini next time. Thanks for a great change of pace recipe for squash.

I did it for a potluck but this dish needs to be served fresh from the fryer, if not it will become real greasy. Other than that, it was a great hit for the potluck and everyone's asking me about the recipe! More cheddar cheese is needed!

good way to use extras squash - a bit mushy in the middle though perhaps more flour and cornmeal next time

I know they aren't healthy... but they are yummy!!  A little bit bland---I'm thinking of adding jalepenos next time!  Still a good flavor and a big hit with my family.  My oldest daughter has already set some aside to have in her lunch tomorrow.

My kids love this recipe!  It's a great way to use the squash fresh from the garden (which they refuse to eat, if cooked).  I added 3/4 cup of grated cheese.  I also sauteed onions and garlic before adding it to the mixture.  Wonderful!  I could not cook these up fast enough for my family.

This reminds me of flat hushpuppies... I used the food processor to grate the onions and mash the cut up  cooked squashes which was less work. I used the recipe for half the batch...the other half..i added garlic powder and italian seasoning. next time i'll try it with cheese or corn and panko crumbs to make it crispier. It's prettier to serve it with sour cream,salsa, chopped bacon and green onions on top.  Thanks for the idea~

These were fantastic!  My zucchini hating son LOVED them!  I did not boil the zucchini first, just used the food processor to grate them and the onion.  Also, I fried them in an inch or so of oil and they were perfect.  This one is a keeper.

A great way to use up squash from my garden.  I used a few suggestions from the other reviewers.  I shredded my squash and used it without precooking and pan fried the fritters in a little bit of olive oil.  Very tasty!

Oh my gosh!  I've been mad at my husband when he brings in more squash from the garden.  I'd about given up trying new ways to prepare it.  This was wonderful.  We loved it these little fritters.  I followed the recipe exactly and then refrigerate the batter for a short time before frying them.  We'll have these again.

These were enjoyed by the whole family,  even the kids.  I pureed the cooked squash in my blender, which took care of tough skin problem as well as great measuring cup.  I had some left over bacon from breakfast that I chopped up and added in.  Only used 1/2 the batter first time I served, then made up the rest next night.  I think the dough worked even better after being refrigerated 24 hrs.  I also only used tsp. sized portions as suggested by others and they cooked great.  Second night I dusted them with parmesan cheese, which was extra yummy!  Looking forward to playing with other suggested variations in the future.

This is wonderful! Mine started off a little watery so I added more of the dry items and some Panko (jap. bread crumps) the Panko seemed to make the puffs even lighter. We made a few the first night and saved the batter for the next day in frig.  We took it to work and deep fried them in Peanut oil and served with bacon, sour cream and salsa on top WOW!!! what a hit, everyone wants the recipe!

I had the same issue as another reviewer had with my squash being a little too watery even after draining it well, but I added a little more of the other dry ingredients. My family loved these!  They're a cross between a hush puppy and fritter. I'm going to play around with the veggies and spices to see what fabulous combinations I can come up with. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was fantastic! I did change a few things. I didn't have any squash so I used zucchini. I used coconut oil and added a little garlic salt and cayenne pepper. I also added  some white cheddar cheese. Oh yeah, and I added about a tsp of chipotle pepper sauce. YUMMY My 4yr old love them dipped in honey mustard. Will make again!

Made this recipe as described with the exception that I pan fried them; as a result they came out more like a fritter. They were easy to make and tasted great, even cold the next day. Will make again.

this is good. I don't personally like the sweet in the cornmeal mix so I use regular cornmeal and flour. add a packet of dry ranch mix for a kick.

We absolutely loved this recipe!! I made a few changes. No one in our house likes summer squash so I have to really hide it.  I shredded the squash and since I needed some liquid I added about a half cup of water.  Batter turned out perfect.  I also used Jiffy corn muffin mix and hubby said I could make these anytime:)

Great way to use all that summer squash I ground up in the food processor and put in the freezer...I cooked ground squash in a pan with the onion until the liquid was cooked out...then I added it to the eggs and cornmeal and flour...great with deep fried fish...we dipped ours in ketchup and horseradish sauce...

These were fabulous.   I used summer squash and one small zucchini, because that's what I had.  My son loved these.  He usually only eats zucchini in bread and doesn't eat summer squash, our any squash, at all.  He asked me to make these again.  Amazing!

These were awesome! I made these last summer when the squash was pouring in from the garden!
I added 1 tsp garlic powder to the mix, and salt and pepper when they came out of the fryer...YUM! I think next time I'll add some cayenne pepper to make it a little spicy.

Planning these as an appetizer- squeezed the moisture out of the processed squash in a new nubby facecloth but I'm sure you could use cheesecloth.Skipped the cooking of the squash & just sliced it & put each in a mini precessor. Loved the dusting of parmesan on the finished mini cakes- husband said they were too bland without. Now he wants me to buy pancetta to chop into batter next time.Rather than garlic salt, I used bacon salt(but will need more in tomorrow's batch- batter is in the fridge. Did do finely grated cheddar: did saute onion & garlic. The only drawback to this recipe is I thought it a little messy to prepare but worth the cleanup involved.

This was excellent!  It reminds me of how my mom makes her left over mashed potatoes into potatoe cakes.  Excellent flavor and texture.

These were good, but a little to greasy to eat all the time. We will include these in our summer/fall seasonal dishes.

Tried these over the weekend and they were wonderful! The only thing I did differenly was cook my onions with the squash (I didn't want crunchy onion pieces in the finished puffs) and added about a half cup or so of a 6 Italian Blend Cheese. Made them with a small cookie scoop (from Pampered Chef) in our Fry Daddy. They were perfect! Hubby raved about how good they were. (And both my mom and mom-in-law asked for the recipe! SCORE!) Will definitely be making these again!

Awesome Recipe!  I used a small cookie scoop to make the "fritter"-perfect size! Also, I used garlic salt instead of regular salt, and added some shredded cheese.

I wouldn't change a thing! Except this could be a great way to sneak any vegetable in on picky kids, so I might try substitute another veggie for the squash at a later date.  Right now, we're lovin' it just like it is.

I was torn on the rating for this recipe but gave it a four because my daughter, who normally doesn't care for squash, liked it.  (She thought it tasted like pancakes.)  However, the recipe didn't do anything for the rest of my family.  I normally like squash, but I found it too sweet with the addition of the corn muffin mix.

The flavor was good, I added a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning.   I used 3 squash instead of the 4 and I ended up putting twice the amount of corn muffing mix in the batter as they appeared to be to wet to me.       We made ours in the deep fryer.    They appeared to be more fritter like then the puffs that are described.

okay-recipe as is = GREAT !!  I cooked the squash sort of like smothered.  I took squash,  onions, red peppers and one jalepeno and smothered down (cooked in butter with salt, garlic powder and onion powder).  then i pulsed it in my food processor and it make 4 cups of squash so i double the flour, corn meal mix, salt and baking soda.  i cooked in a deep fryer and as soon as they hit the oil they puff up.  i made about 30 like this.  Then, i added shredded cheese to the mixture and cook another 15 or so and then i added about 3 tablespoons of chopped pickled jalepenos to the last batch.  All of them were great.  My daughter said it reminder her of a crab cake.  I may add some bay seasoning next time to make it even more "crabby".  My husband raved about them.  He said maybe mke a sweet puff with apples or peaches and dust with powder sugar.  I will probably do that this week.  btw mine were not flat they puffed up round.

These were divine! I followed advice from the other reviewer who put cheese in, and that was a brilliant idea. It needed some sharp cheddar for sure. I added more spices too, which I think it needs even more so I'll do that. I put in one garlic clove but I'll put in more next time. It was a little too greasy, so not sure what to do about that. What a tasty amazing meal. Paired it with Grilled catfish and salad.

I made these up to see if it were possible to hide the veg. I steamed my summer squash and allowed to drain itself while halved and cut side down. Hand mashed only. A handful of seasoned panko, dashes of cayenne, half the sugar,  and bottom scallions in place of onion and about a cup grated cheddar. I also baked these vs deep fried. End result was tasty and fluffy and may be a repeat if done with the mods made.

Meh.  These were just OK to us.  I used fresh squash from the local farm market.  Interesting to fix  squash a different way.  I did add garlic powder and followed the rest of the recipe.  I fried half of them and baked the other half at 350.  The baked ones were actually better, puffed up really nice.  If I tried them again, I would add cheese.  Cheese makes everything better!

These were fantastic!!! My husband loved them & even my daughter loved them & she is a picky eater. The only thing I changed is I added the whole box of Jiffy corn muffin mix. The reason why is after I mix in the dry ingredients with the squash mixture is still looked too wet to me,so I added the rest of the muffin mix. I will make these again.Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

These were great! I took the advice of previous reviewers and puréed the raw squash instead of boiling/draining. Also, on that advice, added some garlic. I made way too many, since the 2 teenagers ended up not eating with the family, but the leftovers crisped up nicely in the oven. Next time, I'll probably add more spices or some herbes de Provence, but these are definitely getting made again! They were even worth the nasty burn on my index fell finger  when the grease splattered as I  ladled in one of the fritters.

Will definitely be making these again. It was a great way to use my overflowing supply of squash. I did use the food processor to purée the onion and squash. I didn't have problem with sogginess but I did drain the chunks really well. I just regret they are fried. I wonder how they would bake?  Good stuff.

The first time I made these they were great! Then I  had a craving for them but didn't have all the ingredients in hand,  so I guess I made up my own recipe with this one as a base. I only had one summer squash on hand so I halved the recipe.  I used stone ground yellow corn meal instead of corn muffin mix, and a 1/4 golden zucchini instead of onion. Also I cubed the squash and zucchini as small as I could and microwaved for 3 minutes, let it cool then mixed in with the other ingredients. I doubled the salt. These came out so fluffy and great that I think I will make them this way on purpose next time! Regardless, thank you original submitter for the great recipe. These are great dipped into a mayo-ketchup sauce.

They taste like homemade hush puppies. Definitely need more dry ingredients so I would recommend adding to desired consistency. If batter's not thick, then it tends to absorb more oil. Def add garlic salt. I can see why people added cheddar cheese.  I prob won't make again because I'm realizing fried food just isn't for me. But nice recipe thank you!

Really good stuff. First time I made it exactly as the recipe calls for. Pretty good. Next time I added a bit of Cajun seasoning. Even better! Third time I sautéed squash, onion and a bit of bacon together and used that. Very good as well. I think it's a very good starting point recipe. You can do many different things with it. Once I thought the squash was to "mushy" and I added a bit of potato flakes to it to dry it out a bit. Was delicious as well.

Love!  Planned to make these as a compliment to the main entree of Calico Beans.  Didn't realize the difference between summer and winter squash at first; what I had on hand was a small sized butternut squash.  Once I realized the difference, I decided to take the chance anyway and prepared the butternut squash the same way I would for any other dish:  I halved the  squash and cooked in oven at 350 with each half open side facing down in a shallow water bath - steams the inside.  When done I scooped out squash and followed recipe.

These were good.  Even my son who hates squash thought these were decent.  They were a little on the bland side, but I did not add cheese like others had suggested.  I found it a little sweet, but still good.  I will make these again but try some tweaks.

These were quite yummy!  I had let a couple yellow squash get too big on the vine but didn't want to waste them and this recipe looked like just the thing!  I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and used finely grated squash instead of boiled and mashed.  It worked out really well and is a good way to use less than tender squash.   I will definitely use this recipe again.

I didn't have any corn muffin mix so I took advice from another comment and just used cornmeal, salt, and baking powder. I also added green and red peppers for color and texture and instead of boiling squash i put it in the blender with a little water. Also a little salt, black pepper, and garlic powder and they were delicious light and fluffy. The kids loved them and I look forward to making these again. I would really love some type of dipping sauce to go with these.

I used frozen squash slices from last years garden in this recipe, it seemed to work just fine.  I had to boil them a little longer but the puffs were a hit with the family! Even the picky daughter loved them!

Loved it. The only thing I did different was that I used squash that got away from me (easy enough to do it you don't pick them every hour, lol) and got too big so I had to seed and peel them. But that wasn't much work and it was an easy way to use up the big ones. Since the larger squash tend to be stringier, the finish puffs had some funny shapes, kind of looked like fried critters with legs and all, was fun making up names for all the shapes. One tip I will give. I didn't have muffin mix, but went on line and found copycat recipes for jiffy muffin mix and followed that, adding the other ingredents of the puff recipe along with it as I mixed. Worked great even though I was adding more muffin mix than called for. Everyone is right in that you do have to fry as the recipe calls for, small tablespoons, or else the center is not cooked.  The only other thing I will add is that it should be called squash puppies, seems more fitting.

Skipped cooking the squash - just puréed it. Added the garlic salt and cheddar that another reviewer suggested. Also added chopped jalapeño.  Also...Made mine using my Gluten free flour blend (rice, tapioca & potato flours) plus Pamela's GF corn muffin mix (we have a celiac in the family). Not the healthiest but supper tasty and my boys (8 and 10) loved them!

This blew us off our lawn chairs. That said, the reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5 was because I changed it into hushpuppies for our fish fry. Here's what I did: I grated the squash and just steam-sauteed it about 3 minutes. Then used all cornbread mix (it's what I use to bread my catfish before frying) and added a couple tablespoons of dry milk powder and an obscene amount of Creole seasoning. Also added very thinly sliced green onions instead of the grated onion.  If you're doing a fish fry, fry the hushpuppies after the fish so you get the flavor. The extra flavor is perfect!

I loved the concept of this dish. My daughter picked it, so I went ahead with it. I made a couple of modifications. Instead of corn muffin mix, I used farina. Since there was a little bit of water left over from when the squash cooked, I added 2/3 cup of bread crumbs just to make sure the water was soaked up. I also added 2 tsp of Mrs. Dash salt-free seasoning just to make sure there was some flavor in the puffs. My whole family enjoyed them very much. My husband eats them with ketchup as a dipping sauce, but loves them as is as well.

In lieu of cornmeal mix, I used 2/3 c. cornmeal, 2 tbsp of sugar, 1 tsp. of baking powder (in addition to the 2 tsp.), 1/4 tsp salt (in addition).

Instead of regular flour, I used whole wheat flour.

I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, too.

This was so delicious!

Was surprised when they came out like hush puppies. My first batch came out a little too bland. Added some spices & about 1/3 cup sugar and it made them sweet to my liking. I also tried some with berries & some with chopped fruit. I did a few of mine with sugar and fruit, but you could probably get desired sweetness with just fruit.

These are good and pretty easy to make. I think next time I will try them without mashing the squash. I felt like it would be better to have small pieces of the squash in there rather than just mashed and mixed.

I made these for a BBQ at our house and they got eaten as fast as I could make them!  I followed advice from other reviewers and added 1 cup cheddar cheese to the squash mixture and 1/2 tsp garlic salt to the flour mixture.  I used a TBSP measuring spoon for dropping into the oil and had no problems cooking all the way through even though I boiled my squash first.  This was a great way to use my yellow squash that had grown too large on the vine.

I just made these. They are very good. I made the first batch just as the recipe says, then I srarted to have fun. I made a second batch and added different things. I did not peel the squash. I did some with cheddar cheese, red peppers, monteryray jack, very old smoked gouda, and hot peppers. All turned out delious. I then froze some and then let them thaw and heated in the toaster oven. This also turned out good. You can put almost anything in them. My husband wants horesradish in them the next time. These will be on my list for things to make for Christmas entertaining.

These had a good flavor, but I have never made anything in my life that absorbs this much grease. They were like sponges! I did add cheddar and pureed the squash while raw, not sure if that made a difference.

My first review, but I had to say thanks for this awesome recipe!  I have a ridiculous amount of squash growing in the garden and was determined to do something with them that all 3 of my kids would eat.  These were fantastic and I didn't change a thing:)

Wonderful recipe!  We used baking mix instead of flour and baking powder.  It was easy!  The kids absolutely had no idea there was squash in these!  I grated the squash to hide it!  We have made these at least 5 times already!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a bit of garlic and some grated cheddar cheese. Delicious! At this time of year, our garden has us up to our ears in squash. We will be making this recipe again and again!

I grew a lot of squash last summer and was looking for recipes to use it up in. I had my doubts about this recipe, but as many people commented favorably, I tried it. I would add more onions and cheese next time and maybe some fresh garlic. The puffs turned out great and I sent some to my neighbors. Normally I do not eat fried foods, but will make an exception for this recipe.

These were so good they kinda reminded me of a Hush Puppy, the only thing I would change the next time I make them would be not to put my onion in the food processer and to chop my onion so I would have the crunch of the onion next time but they were good If you don't want the crunch of the onion.

Just had these for dinner and was a big hit. Very easy to make. I did not change anything with this recipe. It makes a lot, so I may cut in half next time. Depends on how the leftovers reheat.

I absolutely loved these squash puffs.  I cooked half of them as is and added some cheese to the rest of the batter.  Great either way.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I added the garlic and cheese to this like other reviewers suggested, but I didn't like them and neither did my children.

These were so good! I didn't even think I liked squash--a friend gave me a few so I went to the site and found this recipe. Now I may have to get some more squash because these puffs are addictive!
