These were really good.  I found if you crinkle the foil, there is no need to flip!

Excellent!  Really spicy and delicious. The only thing I did differently was to use Charlotte potatoes (lower GI) and cut them into wedges.  Then I boiled them for about 10 minutes BEFORE baking them.  They were crisp outside and creamy inside.  YUM!  If you don't like really hot stuff, you might cut the cayenne in half.

if you  bake them on stoneware they get crispy. it still takes  a little extra time, but no broiling is needed. if you haven't tried stoneware yet you should. definately my best kitchen investment.

Wow! These are "Totally Tangy" and absolutely delicious baked french fries with a Southwestern flair! This is a really nice combination of flavors and a great way to perk up french fries so if you like things spicy with a bit of a kick then this recipe is for you. I upped the oven temp. to 425 and lined a baking sheet with Reynolds non-stick foil. Just bake until nice and crispy then enjoy!

These were wicked spicy.  I would probably make these again with a little less cayene.  They also need to be cooked way long or at a higher temp.

These were really good.  They are spicy so if you don't like it spicy reduce the cayenne pepper to half.  My family loved them.  I kept the peeling on because we like them better that way.  Used cooking spray (not a part of the recipe) on the potatoe slices before coating them, but after looking up the true calories and fat in cooking spray and all the other horrible stuff that in it, next time will not use.  Google how much fat is in cooking spray, and you will stay clear of it.  They can get away with how much fat and calories is really in cooking spray by making the serving size 1/3 of a second spray which is less than a gram and incrediably unrealistic, so they can say zero calories and fat. Has about the same fat content as olive oil, which is healthier with Omega 3's and doesn't have all the chemicals thats in cooking spray.  Was a real enlightening bit of info for me.  Hope this helps others who really care about what goes into their bodies.  Anyways thanks you amanda1432 for a great recipe.

My husband and I really liked these.  I put in a whole tsp of the red pepper flakes and almost 2 tsp of chili powder.  I didn't have any brown spicy mustard so I just added 1 T of regular yellow mustard.  They turned out really yummy, and spicy.  We dipped ours in ranch dressing and they were great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good recipe.  I used frozen steak fries and brushed the oil and spices on before baking. Nice "tangy" flavor.

These are very good.  Have a nice tangy bite to them. Almost too spicy for me, actually, so I may cut some of the cayenne next time.  I didn't really measure, just tossed the ingredients in.  They don't end up crisp in the times written--probably need longer in the oven in order to crisp up.  I used red potatoes, so my fries were smaller, and I left the skins on.  Thanks for sharing--great base spicy fry recipe.

These were way too spicey for our taste.I will probably make again, BUT if I do, I will definitely cut the spices in half.

These were really tasty!  After reading some suggestions I cut the cayenne by half because my 6 year old son was eating them with us.  I also used garlic powder instead of minced cloves.  After about 25 minutes in the over I flipped them over and put them back in for 5 more minutes.  I then switched the broiler on for about 5 more minutes.  I WILL be making these again!  5 STARS!!

These fries were good. I guess I was expecting more because of all the 5 stars. It was an easy recipe to make, the flavour was pretty good, but not anything "great". Some of the topping got a bit burnt even following the directions to a "T". When I make these again, I will precook the wedges in the microwave a bit, then toss them with the topping, then bake them to get the crispy texture. Hopefully that will make them more 5 star-worthy.

These were excellent! I did increase the cayenne and chili powder as suggested by the recipe submitter because we do like spicy. We LOVED the mustard flavor in these. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I can't believe how wonderful these fries were!  Omitted the crushed red pepper because I have little ones and used Dijan as that was all that I had. Tasted the sauce prior to tossing potatoes and I was horrified as it tasted like salty vinegar but after they came out of the oven I fell in love with these potatoes

We really like the zip these have. Line baking sheet with crumpled foil, parchment or Silpat. Soak cut taters in water to remove starch for crisper baked fries.

EDIT: Another reviewer suggested baking on stoneware. I will try my new pizza stone this time.

Great. Just great. I only had one piece but the family ate up the whole batch in no time flat. I used about.....two and a half pounds red potatoes and used a hot stone ground mustard. Super simple, but it did need to bake another almost ten minutes on top of the 20 that the recipe stated. My kids even liked these! I served this with Scotdog's ranch dressing mix made with nonfat sour cream, nonfat yogurt and lowfat mayo. With the Bacon Jack Chicken Sandwiches, this was a happy meal for all my boys.

Very good! Didn't have lime juice on hand, so I subbed lemon juice.  Also took a reviewer's suggestion to cook on a stoneware pizza circle.

These were incredible.  We used a jalepeno mustard which gave it just the right kick and left out the chili powder. Also used a little vinegar instead of the lime juice (took someone elses advice on this) Will use this recipe alot!

This is one of many potato recipes I have tried, and this was a hit! My husband and I absolutely loved it. It's great that this is baked instead of fried.  I omitted the pepper flakes, and it still retained the spiciness.  I also substitued vinegar for the juice.  It was great...props to you, Amanda!

These were very greasy and never became crispy, even after cooking longer.  I eventually had to fry them, which is what I was trying to avoid.  I gave it 2 stars because I think the spice mix is tasty, but do recommend reducing the oil.

Fast, easy and delicious for baked fries.  I have made this three times since discovering it from the daily pictures from one of the girls on the Recipe Exchange.  The flavors are perfect and you're able to control the heat to your liking.  The spicy mustard adds the perfect zing.  This is a definite keeper in my family.  Thanks for the recipe!

Mine never got crispy, so I put them under the broiler for a few minutes before serving. I wouldn't describe these as tangy as much as I would spicy (hot wise), but I enjoyed the flavor regardless.

These fries were really tasty and spicy.  If I make them again I will use two 13x9 pans to bake them in.  There were too many fries to make a single layer in one 13x9 pan.  Or I may only use two potatoes instead of four.  As other reviewers wrote, I needed to bake these twice as long to get them golden brown the way our family likes them. Can't say these were anyone's favorite but we enjoyed them none the less.

I did not have garlic cloves on hand, so used garlic powder, also used onion powder. Pretty much – then I followed directions. Even though my husband does not like 'skins' he had more than one serving . . . so next time I'll cut these in a way he can have 'skinless' and I'll eat the strips with skins! I did soak the potatoes in water about 45 minutes to break down starches. My husband likes traditional yellow mustard SO that is what I used. It seems a little more lime juice would be my preference. Next time I will boil potatoes a little before coating in sauce. I put the ingredients in a plastic bag then coated the potatoes in the bag . . . Hmmmmmm - boiling these I'll have to let them cool before coating in a bag. It seems baking took a little longer, but I did have one big potato, enough for two people!

Very yummy and very spicy - need to eat with ranch to cool them down a bit.  We sometimes make these using greek seasoning instead of the chilli powder and cayenne and I like those even better!

Made these for dinner tonight---the fries vanished, but the compliments were abundant!  Thanks for a great new alternative to "plain old fries".  I made the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect.  I can handle a handle a little spice, but nothing too hot, so I was really making them for my husband who is of "the spicier the better" philosophy".  I found them to be flavorful with just the right amount of spice and my teenage children kept telling me they "Loved, loved, loved them". I probably could have upped the cayenne and red pepper in a batch for my husband, but he said these had a great flavor as is.  Definitely a keeper.

The fries were okay.  I didn't think they were very flavorful.  I don't know if I didn't get the spices distributed evenly or if I just needed to add more spices.  I guess I'll have to try the recipe again to see where the problem lies.

They turned out ok, but I didn't like the taste of the sauce very much. I baked them for 10 more minutes.

All the adults really enjoyed these, although MUCH too spicy for the kids.  I didn't add any red pepper flakes, so I'm surprised how spicy these were (and I like to think we have a pretty high spice tolerance)...  All in all, I will definitely make again, but cut down even more on the the spicy stuff so my kids can also enjoy.  Yum!  I liked 'em dipped in mustard.

I took the idea of these and made them very different. I baked the whole potatoes in the microwave this morning and then stored them in the fridge all day. Cut them into fries and then covered with the marinade I invented: 3 T olive oil, 2T balsamic, 2T dijon, 4 cloves garlic, 1 t seasoning salt, 1/4 t pepper. Baked at 425* for 20 minutes. Could have been longer, they weren't crispy. But tasted very nice.

I loved the flavor of these fries!  I used sweet potatoes and they were wonderful!  However, as many others said, they did not get crispy.  That was the one disappointment.  I will definitely make these again!

These so-called fries were not cooked all the way through, even though I added more time to the recipe, and the seasonings were anything but "tangy".  I was so excited to try this recipe - what a let-down!

These were good but I didn't get any "wows" from my guests. I followed the recipe exactly except that I let the potatoes marinate in the sauce overnight. I sprinkled salt when they came out of the oven to bring out the flavor, which was not very strong in my opinion. My guests and I didn't find them very high in spice/flavor so we dipped them in a spicy BBQ sauce which was fine. I will try a different recipe next time.

Made EXACTLY as recipe stated.  Loved the baking method, the texture.  However, the fries were way too hot (spicy) for me.  I will use this recipe again and omit the red pepper flakes and use just a touch of the cayenne.  (I don't think children could handle eating these - my mouth is still burning.  It isn't just the cayenne.  Red Pepper Flakes are HOT!)

The flavor was really good.  My son of said he could taste the lime.  I followed the recipe exactly and when the time was up they were still wet and soft.  I raised the oven to 450 and baked them for another 15 minutes.  They were better but still soft.  I probably will not try again.  If I do, I'll make my own adjustments. maybe too much oil with the mustard and lime juice.  Debbie

Excellent recipe. Instead of the lime juice I substituted with Apple cider vinegar. I also let the fries marinate for about 30 minutes before cooking. I will definitely make this again.

These have very good flavor and we loved them with our dinner tonight. I followed the recipe other than I baked them on a rack over a sheet pan which eliminated needing to flip them which makes them even easier. My kids love oven baked wedges and this will be on of our regulars.

This recipe was surprisingly great! I soaked my cut potatoes in water for about an hour before I dressed them with the sauce. The water helps to break down the starches and they cook faster and easier. I too cut back on the cayenne, and also added garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley leaves. I cooked it for the given time for the first round, before flipping, and they were not coming along well.

I made these and my family loved them they are perfect I have some little ones so I left out the red peper flakes and cut the cayanne in half and they were just right had a just a little kick.  I used Yukon golds and cut the reciepe in half it is best to cook them at 425 and cut smaller they still were a little under done after 30 minutes so just had to add a little more time.  Will definatly make again.

Very good, but a little too spicy- less cayenne next time, but will prepare again.

These were tasty but not sure if they are worth all the prep work and getting out all the ingredients. I used dijon mustard because that's all that I had. The kids to my surprise at them, but I didn't add the crushed red pepper flakes in case they wanted some.

Unexpected!  Pretty good.  I used tasbasco as well if you really like spicy.  Maybe 1 teaspoon.  I will make this again to spice up the burget and fries combo.

Any recipe that ll five people in my household rave over deserves 5 stars (probably more).  Made these as a side to Turkey Quinoa Meatloaf instead of the usual mashed potatoes, and they were eaten very quickly.  We also made some chipotle/may dipping sauce that sent them over the top spicy.  Thanks for a useful recipe that we will enjoy over and over.

The only change I made was using 1 russet potato, some small new potatoes (skin on) and part of a yam/sweet potato. The best results were on the russet. They were both tangy and spicy. The other varieties were really just spicy and no tang.

Not totally tangy but pretty good. I actually think I would double the coating next time, parcooking the potato slices in the microwave first to cut down on the baking time, ensuring the coating doesn't burn. I liked the flavor - there just wasn't quite enough 'wow factor'.

SERIOUSLY SPICY!! Holy cow! I used a little less than 1/4 tsp of cayenne & just a quick shake of red pepper flakes & I couldn't eat them(nor my kiddos). My husband loved them, tho, hence 4 stars.

EXCELLENT! I did double the sauce to ensure spicy, tangy goodness, and they were great! I used 2 tablespoons of spicy brown mustard and 2 tablespoons yellow mustard. I was so happy with the taste of these and I already can't wait to make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good but for some reason didnt get a whole lot of flavor like i had expected. Maybe basting while baking would have helped?I still really enjoyed these fries and will use this again. Just dredge them in the mixture next time ;)

Very good! Loved the blend of spices. The fries would not get good and crispy, though, even under the broiler for several minutes. If you are familiar with county fair french fries, the 'doneness' of these fries is like that, some are crispy, some are soft. I would definitely make these again.

Great---just the right amount of fantastic flavor!  I used Dijon mustard and microwaved the potatoes first so that they’d require less time in the oven.  Don’t be afraid of the word “tangy” in this recipe—it adds wonderful and surprising flavor to the dish!

This was delicious and a nice departure from our normal oven fries!  I ended up adding about 1/2 teaspoon sugar to the sauce, which really brought out the natural flavor of the limes!  Thank you, we really enjoyed this!

We love this recipe so much that is a regular in our house (though we leave out the cayenne).  We dice the potatoes, cook covered in the microwave for 10 minutes, stir, cook another 10 minutes, and they're perfect....cuts the cooking time by more than half!

Pretty good! The tanginess wasn't quite there and the spiciness could actually be upped a few notches for me. I had to leave them in for a few extra minutes to make sure they were crispy. Better with melted cheese on it, especially pepper jack. I will make these again.

OMG Good!! I talked hubby into letting me do the oven fries and he said I'll do them this way from now on.  We cut steak fries & followed the recipe except I did use garlic powder instead of fresh, and added grill seasoning instead of s/p.  Wonderful with our Tangy Pork Sandwiches!

I like spicy and these were really spicy. I always prefer to make the dish as per the recipe directions at least the first time, then make any changes if neccesary. These fries were just a little too spicy for me, so next time I make them I will cut down on the hot spice. I will make them again.

I used red potatos sliced into steak-fries with the skins left on (use an onion-blossom slicer for super-quick steak fries) decreased the oil until just barely enough to get to seasoning to stick, and baked on stoneware on 450-degrees for 15 minutes each side. Many reviewers had problems with the cook time listed not giving them the texture they wanted.  I found my steak-fries were crispy on the outside, soft in the center at 450 and 15 min each side.  I served with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkling of cilantro.

I made these and they are very good. I would cut down on the caynene pepper next time. Personal prefernce. Perfect for my husband. I had some sause left over because I made it for just one. Put on chicken breasts and put in foil and baked along with the fries. Great very good dinner. Thank you!

These potatoes were very tasty with a nice zippy flavor.  Good combination of tang/heat. I opmitted the cayene pepper for the rest of my families perference. Also used it on grilled pork chops that I was preparing at the same time and that was also excellent.

These were alright. They had SPICE to them, but I didn't really think there was a lot of TASTE to them. The family thought they were good, but I didn't think they were very special.

These were great.  I cooked them a little longer than suggested and it worked out wonderfully.  They were a big hit and my brother called me the next week for the recipe.

I cut the spices in half because we are spice wusses, but it was still fantastic.  The lime is the best part.

Pretty good, although mine never really got crispy.  They were still good though.  A little spicy, and I cut way back on the cayenne and pepper flakes.  I enjoyed mine dipped into blue cheese dressing.  Too spicy for my kids, my two year old said "Too hot!"

The flavoring was so overpowering on these you couldn't taste the potatoes.  And mine were still not cooked after the recommended time. I had to throw them under the broiler for an additional 5 minutes to crisp them up.  I used one tablespoon of olive oil instead of three.

I omitted the red pepper flakes as I was making them for me, and I am a wimp when it comes to spice... Although I agree with the previous reviewer that they didn't get very crispy, they were extremely tasty. Thanks!

These fries were pretty good and definitely had a nice little kick to them. I had to cook mine way more (about an hour more) than the recommended time.

I THOUGHT THESE WERE GOOD. I DIDNT HAVE CAYENNE OR RED PEPPER FLAKES SO I ADDED A LITTLE BIT OF HOT SAUCE TO THE MIXTURE. I ALSO JUST USED REGULAR MUSTARD. I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE BAKED(LOWER IN FAT)

Good recipe. Quite tangy. I loved all the spices and condiments except the lime juice. However, my husband liked the lime flavor. I may try and add vinager in place of the lime juice to the marinade next time.

Honestly can say that these were some of the  BEST homemade fries I have ever made!  They were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and great for dipping! (I went with hot sauce and blue cheese.)  ABSOLUTELY recommend this recipe to anyone :)

Great recipe. I parboiled the potatoes based on other reviews. I also skipped the cayenne and only put half the chili powder, still had bite. Also, I only had Dijon mustard, so that's what I used. My husband was really impressed. I will make these again. Thank you for the recipe.

Very good!  It's easy to adjust the heat level depending on what you like (we like mild heat).  Excellent as lunch the next day, too!  As another person did, we used Ranch dressing as a dip.

Super YUM! ESPECIALLY for those of us that have to watch our salt intake... The only change I made was to use only 1 tablespoon of brown mustard. These were even good after they got cold. And the others were right, you don't need ketchup!

Absolutely awesome-  I added a side of sour cream with a few onions cut up into it and it helped even out the hotness of the fries.
