I work as a baker in a very busy cafe and this has become our most popular cookie. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!I always get a nice thick chewy cookie with consistent results everytime. I don't care for raisins, so i have never used them, but always add toffee bits instead for wonderful results. I am not understanding why some of you are getting a flat cookie, but what i do is just make sure i always use butter, make sure it is not too warm, and i never measure it out because 1 lb is 2 cups..no need to measure. I also always make sure to use a shiny aluminum sheet pan (which almost always gives the best results for cookie spreading),and i top it with parchment paper instead of greasing the sheet. I typically use a #40 scoop for reg size, or #20 for jumbo cookies. I Bake them just until set, and they are the perfect size and texture. HUGE seller. Good luck!

Okay, so I know this is my own recipe, but that makes me entitled to a review, right???  I had a friend who made these for Bunco one night, and she said she makes a batch of the dough, rolls it in saran and freezes it.  Just slice and bake.  There was absolutely no difference in flavor (I have had these so many times I'm definitely and expert...) and the texture was perfect.  As another reviewer said, these cookies ROCK!  I normally make them with heaping tablespoonfulls, so the cookies are very large, but if you want to freeze them, you can make the rolls of dough to be whatever size you want.

Saw the recipe yesterday and made them this morning - GREAT COOKIES!  I actually got 7 doz. cookies using a medium-sized cookie scoop that's probably equal to about 2 Tbsp.  Will definitely make these often!

Outstanding cookie!  Just be sure to heavily grease the cookie sheets. I lightly greased one cookie sheet and the cookies stuck, so I heavily greased the other cookie sheets with much better results.

OH MY!! This is one of the very best cookies I've ever tasted! I did use dried cranberries instead of raisins and 1/2 butter - 1/2 shortening and old fashioned oats. YUMMY!!! A+++++

As someone who has made tens of thousands of this cookie(chef at WPL for four years), I would like to point out that the original recipe calls for old-fashioned oats, not quick cooking.  It gives a chewier, more robust cookie.  We used to fly-in Beaver loads of oats each summer from Anchorage.  One of the best cookies in my repetoire.  Thanks to Judy for creating it.

I made half a recipe which yielded about 3 dozen cookies.  They are so good.

This is a very good cookie, not a great cookie. It is basically the recipe on the oats box doubled with an extra cup of white sugar, coconut, nuts and chips added. I found them greasy, too heavy with butter. I made them huge--3.5 oz of dough rolled into balls. They were even better when I put the extra dough in the fridge and cooked them a day later without letting them come up to room temp. They set up thicker this way looked and tasted much better. I do this with cc cookies too--cook them after 24 to 36 hrs in the fridge, makes a world of diff in the cookie.

These cookies are the BEST!  Don't be fooled by the amount of cookies the recipe makes, they just seem to fly out of the cookie tins.  I made the original using a cookie scoop. Love that you can also make a fridge rolls; make one day then bake when you need.  This one is a wonderful keeper!

Very good crunchy cookie.  Has all the ingredients of my favorite cookies so who wouldn't love them.  Followed the directions exactly and they came out perfect.  Will be sure to make again.

These cookies are absolutely the BEST!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I halved everything and the cookies are perfect.  I did plump the raisins in hot water for about 15 minutes while I was assembling the other ingredients but otherwise did nothing else different.  Baked them for 11 minutes and they are beautifully soft and chewy!  Will definitely make again!

So you know where I am coming from, I bake once a year, at Christmas. These cookies came out perfectly. They were well-mannered in the oven: They did not flatten any more than they should. Each cookie was a rounded tablespoon, say 1.5-ish T. Baked, each cookie was 2 ¼ to 2 3/4 inches in diameter and about ¾ inch thick in the middle.

I omitted raisins (ick). I made two half-batches, one with pecans and the other with walnuts. The pecan half-batch made 47 cookies. The walnut half-batch made 61.

Our oven temps are way off, so I had to play with the time a bit. The cookies finished as crunchy (not hard) on the outside and chewy in the middle. I was afraid the oats would overwhelm, but they do not. Deelish and yum-o.

Great cookies, Kim! Made them for our club members and everyone raved about them. A few went home with the recipe and promises to bring them to the next meeting. Thank you for sharing and tell your Alaska friends that the flyfishers of Washington State loved these!

Superb cookie!! definitely one of my favourite cookie recipes. Everyone absolutely loves them :)  I half the recipe and it still makes nearly three dozen. I omit the raisins (not a fan), use pecans instead of walnuts, and I increase the choc chips to 1.5 cups (for half recipe).

These were very good.  I was out of vanilla extract, so I used coconut extract.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I used a medium cookie scoop and got 28 cookies (I cut the recipe to 15 for serving size).  I did have to flatten them slightly.  I don't understand the reviews that people said they came out flat.  They were chewy and really good!  I would make these again!

These are scrumptious!!!  I love them!  I cut up a milk chocolate Cadbury bar instead of using chocolate chips.  I used half whole-wheat pastry flour.  I don't like raisins, so I substituted white chocolate chips.  Make sure you toast the walnuts, it adds great flavor!  Love the subtle coconut flavor too.  I cut the recipe in half.  I've made two dozen so far, and still have lots of dough left over in the fridge to make more cookies later.  I will make these often.

I'll have to disagree with most of the reviews for this cookie.  It's not awesome...it's outstanding!  Definitely worth the extra ingredients above and beyond the average chocolate chip cookie.  I omitted the nuts due to an alergy in our family.  Didn't even miss them.  Like another reviewer, I halved the butter and added butter flavored shortening.  The appearance and taste of the cookie was that of an upscale bakery without the outrageous price.  Kudos to the Wilderness Place Lodge and Kim for submitting this wonderful recipe.

I followed recipe exactly (besides cutting in half) and these were delicious! I did make bigger ones at first and they flattened out so the rest I made a bit smaller. SO good!

The flavor of these cookies is fantastic.  I greased the pan for the first couple of batches, then used non-stick tinfoil for the last few.  NON-STICK TINFOIL PREVENTS FLAT COOKIES.  The cookies on the greased pans flattened out, but the ones on the tinfoil remained nice and plump.  I halved the recipe, left out the raisins and walnuts, and added 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips.

The best cookies i have ever made!!! i brought them to a party and everyone loved them too. the name is pretty cool too. I have to say when i was making them i was surprised at how huge the batter was. i froze about half of it and we got 4 dozen baked. And this was an accident: i thought one stick of butter was one cup (but it's really only half a cup) so i only made it with one cup of butter and they were still amazing! thanks so much for sharing my new favorite cookie of all time :)

Taste great, but I prefer the texture of the Urban Legend cookie recipe.  The 2 recipes are very similiar...only a few adjustments.  I also prefer using old-fashioned oats.

these cookies are perfect--They taste very  chewy & crispy -I love them!!  I reduced the amount of recipe  to 1/4 the  amount for  two of us and it made 16  big cookies  and no trouble to  do that ---I used dried cranberries instead of rasins. I  baked 12 min and let rest on the pan for 3 minutes and removed to rack to  cool. I  will be making these again  for sure, as we love them -thanks for sharing your recipe!

Pretty good, but not my favorite.  I like that they have lots of oatmeal in them - that offered just the right amount of "chewiness".

Really good cookies.  I used Hersey's Dark Chocolate morsels for the chocolate chips and excluded the walnuts due to a food allergy.  Easy to make too.  I cut the recipe in half and still wound up with almost 5 dozen cookies, but they're tasty, so I've just been sending them home with visitors.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great cookie! I used milk chocolate chips and the recipe was a big hit with my boys. I made half a batch yesterday and they are just about gone. Be sure to grease the cookie sheet well as they do tend to stick. I'll be making these again and again!

I was intrigued by the description of this recipe and was disappointed after I made it.  Don't get me wrong, it was a decent enough cookie but, it's an oatmeal cookie with chocolate chips.

Made these cookies Sunday morning to take to a Punaweb beach day in Hilo. They were fantastic!! and nobody didn't eat at least one. I took 3 dozen of the 5 that the recipe made and ALL were gone when I came home. Did I mention there was only 17 people there??!! I didn't make any changes and WILL make more. Next time I think I'll add some coconut extract to enhance the flavor of the shredded coconut. It was lost a bit in the rest of the other flavors. I used a scale to make the cookies. Weighed the total dough in grams and divided by 60 and just rolled out loose balls of 48 grams. They all baked evenly at 14 minutes.

Would have given it a 5 but I subbed the choco chips and raisins for butterscotch chips. Great base recipe though.

These cookies are awesome! I was looking for something different, and these fit the bill. I took one reviewers tip and omited the raisins, and added toffee bits.

Great cookie!  I did make a number of adjustments with nuts, flour, fruit to make these a little healthier or just use what I had on hand, but the base recipe was tasty.  I did have issues with sticking to the pan that others had, and mine did not flatten out, but in fairness it could be because I did make changes (including adding hempseed).  Thanks for sharing, I'll be making these again!!

Yummy cookies! I made both w/ and w/o coconut, couldn't really taste the coconut, liked them better w/o. I will add 1/4 cup of flour next time to make up for the coconut, and also they were a little thin and chewy - I like my cookies thicker! Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Deliciously tasty cookie!  I made a quarter of the recipe, which yielded 2 dozen cookies.  In half of my batch, I subbed Craisins for the raisins. In the other half, I subbed toffee bits for the raisins.  It seems I couldn't go wrong either way with my substitutions.  They were GREAT!  The cookies were crispy, yet chewy. The coconut added to the crispy texture. Although I used a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, they did bake a little flat (even after refrigeration).  However, this doesn't affect the taste of this cookie.  I will make this recipe again, and again, and again!

Agree with previous reviewers that these cookies are great. I made as per the recipe but know I can substitute different nuts, dried fruit, chocolate and essence for a different flavor. Halving the ingredients made over 4 dozen normal sized cookies using a scoop that holds 2 Tbs.

AWESOME!!!! These are so good!! I made the recipe exactly as written and got several dozen chewy, yummy cookies. I almost did not have a big enough bowl to mix these in and had to finish mixing with my hands. So make sure you have an extra oversized bowl, or half the recipe. Thank you for such a perfect cookie recipe, it is now in my tried and true favorites file, and will make these for Christmas (and anytime the mood strikes) for years to come.

These cookies rock! For me, they have become the ultimate cookie to add different stuff to (toffee, nuts, dried fruits, the list is endless!) 

They also freeze really well and so when I make them, I tend to make like double or triple the amount and am always excited when I remember those hidden gems of frozen cookie goodness.

These cookies are truly amazing!  They really do have a taste like no other cookie - it has all of my family's favorite ingredients, yet you can't taste one single ingredient too much.  And they certainly are hearty!  The only problem I see with them, is that they are so good, I can't eat just one!

Great stuff! The dough was thick, heavy and hard to work with, but the cookies were so amazing it made it all worth it for me. I probably won't make them often, but I am very glad I chose to make them tonight. Thanks for sharing!

I was very disappointed.  Granted I didn't use nuts (forget them I suppose...), I most disappointed with the consistency.  Every batch in the oven came out flat and crumbly.  I changed up the size of the cookie, the temperature, and time and I still could barely manage to keep them together out of the oven.  Taste is great, but not extraordinary, or what I would hope for a Five Star recipe.  Thanks anyway! :)

These are great cookies!  My suggestion: instead of 2 cups butter, I added 1 cup butter and 1 cup butter flavored shortening.  The cookies hold their shape this way - no over flattening or burning.  Makes for a great looking - and tasting - cookie!  Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies were wonderful!  I got about 7 dozen, 2" cookies out of this recipe.  Definitely better than just oatmeal cookies!  I ended up using a stock pot to do the mixing.  My bowl wasn't large enough.  I need a bigger bowl so I can make these again, and I will!

I made these cookies today, and boy, are they good.
I read other reviews and I disagree that some think they taste just like oatmeal cookies. They have a unique flavor- a mix betwen chocolate chip and oatmeal but they are not too sweet. This recipe makes ALOT of cookies.I made 2- 9x12 trays and 1 gift bag full.My kids love them and I bake alot.
I will make these again. THANKS!

Excellent cookie recipe and very versatile for ones personal tastes. For sure you need a large bread mixing bowl and a lot of muscle power mixing everything, but it's worth the effort. I got raves from the batch we made. I left out the coconut and raisins and added 1cup each of chopped dried apricots, dried apples, cranraisins, (plumped them first) semi sweet chocolate chips and toasted pecans. I also cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup each. Baked on parchment paper, no sticking problems. Kids loved them. A great nourishing snack with a glass of milk. Plus they keep well frozen.

These cookies were a hit. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and substituted half the butter with (butter flavored) shortning. I added 1/2 c. chopped dried cranberries and increased the amount of coconut to 3/4 c., i then baked the cookies for exactly 10 minutes and they came out perfectly moist and chewy.

I absolutely found this one of the best cookie recipes ever. When ever I make them they disappear rather rapidly. I rarely add the coconut unless I am in the mood for it. The dough does get a bit hard to mix after you add all of the ingredients to it, other than that I can't complain.

Very tasty. I agree that half of a recipe is making well enough cookies. The good thing as suggested by an other reviewer is that you can roll the dough, freeze it, and use it afterwards. You don't even need to thaw, just cut and put it straight it the oven! I made this recipe quite a few times, they are really good, but mine are always flat unlike mentionned by some other reviewers. I should say that they have a golden color, not a brownish appearance like in the picture submitted by mitch103.

This cookies are SO good. They are just perfect. Don't cook more than 12 mn. They will still be soft when out of the oven, but will become harder when cooling down.
They don't spread a lot, so you can bake a lot at once.

This is an awesome cookie.  I halved the recipe and it still made 50 'normal-sized' cookies.  I followed the recipe as is with the exception of throwing in half again as many chocolate chips (a compromise for my husband who wanted plain chocolate chip cookies).  I used a stone baking pan and cooked for 12 mins.  Every cookie came out perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It will definitely be a staple in my cookie repetoire.

I found that using 1 c. Crisco and 1 c. butter worked better.  The
second time I made these, I froze an 8" square pan of the dough for
later use.  It made some wonderful, chewy 'brownies'.  Be sure to
toast the walnuts.

We originally wanted to half the recipe, but made a mistake and ended up doing the whole thing! We got exactly 60 cookies. We were horrified at the amount of oats used, but it came out relatively well. Be sure to press the cookies flat because unlike other cookie dough, these will not spread and flatten by themselves. The taste is comparable to those we can buy at the market, but nothing spectacular. They aren't that good cold, so it's a good idea to undercook a minute or two so that you can put it in the oven and toast on the lowest setting just before serving. Also, they are so filling that one cookie is enough to make you not hungry for a few hours!

Yum.  I also used half butter-flavored Crisco and half butter.  Toasted the walnuts until they started to smell soooo good.  Used old fashioned oats because I like them better.  Otherwise used the recipe exactly as is, and the cookies are DELICIOUS.  I'm not a huge fan of plain chocolate chip cookies, so these will now be my standard cookies!

These cookies turned out perfectly. It definetly makes more than 60 cookies stated in the recipe! I got 80 cookies, and that was using a large cookie scoop that holds 2 Tbsp. of this cookie dough! I'm not complaining though, 'cause these are delish! There is plenty to share with others! Thanks Kim! :0)

A+++++ wow!!! These are amazing! Followed the recipe to a tee, and made sure to toast walnuts in a pan (dry) med heat for 2-3 minutes (cool completely), also let raisins sit in warm water for 5 minutes, then drained (to plump). I was generous on chocolate chips,walnuts, and coconut.Placed on very well greased pan in tablespoons and cooked for about 15-17 minutes.The best cookie I have had in a long time! Definitely worth trying!Make sure to half the recipe by typing in 30 servings at the bottom of page. It made about 4 dozen 3 inch cookies.

These cookies were really good!  I cut the recipe in half and left out the raisins since I didn't have any. I made the cookies fairly big and still came up with at least 3 dozen.

My family thought these were the best cookies I have ever made, which is saying something considering I bake three or four times a week. I used milk chocolate chips and added extra coconut.  I also halved the recipe and ended up with an enormous batch of cookies.

Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect just as is or change or omit the last four ingredients. I have tried with chopped peanuts,chopped dates,butterscotch chips and plain oatmeal. I also lightly grease my cookie  sheets with butter flavored Crisco to crisp the edges. Great recipe !!!!!!

I made this cookie using a little less walnuts and adding sunflower and flax seeds (and toasting them all b4 making the cookies) to the recipe.  As well I forgot the coconut! I almost didn't go with the raisins b/c i was skeptical about the raisin/chocolate chip combo but I'm so glad i did! 
I didnt find that my cookies came out flat but it could be b/c i used whole wheat flour instead of regular white (added fibre is always good!).
These cookies were amazing, hugely filling, nutritious and fruity, chewy, crunchy, nutty all in one! I'm sure glad i halved the recipe, I ran out of room to cool the cookies!
I have a feeling these will be a standby for get togethers and school lunches.

MMMMM - these are so good!  I cut the recipe in half and it made a lot of cookies!  Keeping in mind some of the reviews saying that the cookies spread, I used 2 cups of flour instead of 1 1/2.  They didn't spread any more than my other cookies usually do and still taste awesome!  Thanks Kim!

These are good oatmeal cookies.  I like the idea of coconut in them like my mom used to do; wouldn't mind even a little more of that taste in them.  I used pecans rather than walnuts; toasting them is a nice touch.  The dough spreads as they bake making a thin cookie and they are crispy.  I tried baking some for 10 minutes and some for 12-13; wasn't really any difference that I noticed.  Beth's Spicy Oatmeal Cookies are my ultimate faves.  Thanks for sharing this, Kim.

Even my kids, who tend to prefer plain old chocolate chip cookies, LOVED these cookies.   I used pecans,  and tried both semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips.  We preferred the milk chocolate.  What a great recipe!   Thank you!

Good cookies!  I made some with coconut and some without coconut (my husband hates coconut) and couldn't really tell the difference.  I used a big scoop and made large 3-4 in. cookies and still got more than 5 dozen. Great to take along for a snack.

These cookies are so good!!!  I thought I needed a double batch  but 1 recipe produced all the cookies I needed for today. I can see me making these and freezing and pulling a few out at a time. Here are a few changes I made: Only used 5 cups of oatmeal. It was plenty to make hardy cookies. Substituted chopped dates for the raisins. This recipe is a keeper for sure!!

I made half of the recipe, and my family liked the cookies, which tasted very similar to the oatmeal cookies I make.  If I make them again I would definitely add cinnamon. That would make this a five star recipe.

There’s a lot going on in these cookies. I made them a bit larger, but kept the normal cooking time for a chewy cookie.
I run a large fly fishing shop and guide service,  and pack these in my river lunches. They got rave reviews from all out clients! My new go-to!

These are awesome cookies! I substituted raisins and used diced dates instead. They paired well with the toasted walnut flavour. Be sure to take out of the oven approx. 1-1 1/2, minutes before you think they are done as they truly do set up and turn a bit bown while they're cooling on the cookie sheet. 
Makes approx 7 dozen.

I used about 2/3 of the sugar and used organic unsweetened coconut.  The cookies are delicious!  I must have used smaller heaping tablespoons because I ended up with just over 100 cookies!

These are the only cookies, my family requests by name! Since we live in Idaho, we call them Wilderness Ranch Cookies, after a mountainous community near Boise. :)

Love them!

Loved these cookies!  They are super chewy and delicious.  Beware, it makes a lot of cookies.  Once I realized how much I had I decided to split the recipe.  After adding the oatmeal and prior to adding any chocolate chips or nuts I divided it into 2 bowls.  One bowl I made following the recipe as is but for 1/2 the amount.  The other bowl I added cranberris, white chocolate chips, and nuts.  They were both great!

I made these following the recipe completely. I made them for my husband, but shared them also.  Feedback was unanimous!  Delicious! 
I made the full amount, was able to bake some, and still had plenty of dough to freeze.  This is an ideal recipe for large get-togethers. I will make these again...many times I am sure.!

Used half Splenda half white sugar, Splenda brown sugar, ( diabetic Hubby) dried cranberries instead of raisins. Made them a bit smaller. A good chewy cookie. Did a half recipe and still got 50 cookies. Oh, yeah, threw in some Heath chips. Not a very dietetic baker, am I. I'll do better next time, promise.

I followed this recipe to the letter (also using the tips- room temp butter and eggs and boiling the raisins before using). These turned out great! Crispy, yet still chewy. I think the flavor is great as is, so I don't see any reason to monkey with the recipe though I may try Craisins and White Chocolate chips in the future just for fun. I used teaspoon sized drops and I got about 10 dozen cookies! Awesome recipe if you needs lots for an event/bake sale etc. All my kids ages 3-15 loved these, as well as my husband who is not normally a coconut lover. A+

These are my new favorite cookie!  Be sure not to over bake them and keep them in an airtight container or they will dry out.  The perfect blend of crispy and chewy.  I cut the recipe in half - because we didn't need so many.  Next time I will make the large batch and freeze half for later.  A wonderful cookie!  Thank you!
PS:  I put craisins in instead of raisins.  It added a nice "tang".

First I'm going to confess that I didn't do it exactly, but hybridized the recipe on the oatmeal container with this one. Still, I used the chocolate chips, raisins, coconut and, not walnuts, but pecans. Just before baking, I sprinkled a bit of Demerara sugar on each. Mine came out mostly crisp and somewhat chewy--just delightful. Thank you for sharing this.

These cookies are extremely yummy and filling.  Other than cutting the recipe in half, I made them exactly as written.  I used a large cookie scoop getting almost 3 dozen large cookies that had a nice chewy texture with a slightly crispy exterior.  The toasted walnuts give a great flavor so take the time to toast them - it's not the same cookie without them.  Thanks for a fantastic addition to my cookie collection!!

I'd give them a 4.5. Good taste; quite sugary and not as oatmeal-y as I like my oatmeal cookies, but a good cookie nonetheless. Next time I'll try cutting down white & brown sugar, and use old fashioned oats if I can find a small quantity. I made a 1/2 recipe, very easy to follow recipe.

:::::: I'd add instructions for baking- I had issues trying to bake 2 trays at once in my oven (burning, and gooey centers); I'd recommend baking 1 tray at a time: ~3-5 mins on the lowest rack to set them. Then 7-9 mins on a higher rack to cook them thoroughly through. This will produce a smaller & thicker cookie; you can bake on the higher rack first to produce a thinner & bigger cookie. I rotated each tray 3-4 times during baking.

:::::Thanks for the recipe!

This is my go to recipe for oatmeal cookies. I've add cranberries instead of raisins, subbed pecans for walnuts, and added a tsp of cinnamon, but our favorite is chocolate chips and pecan.  I love chewy cookies, but my husband loves crispy cookies, and this recipe satifies both of us. A friend of my husband loves these no matter what I add, I've seen him eat a couple dozen in a few hours time. I usually halve the recipe, fill the cookie jar and the rest goes in the freezer.  When thawed, they taste just as good as fresh baked. This is a very underated recipe, in my opinion. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

These cookies are awesome.. Very easy and filling. I did roll them into walnut size balls and flattened with a fork dipped in sugar for a more round cookie. I do not use metal cookie sheets. I use preheated stoneware cookie sheet which creates a more bakery style cookie.

I made these exactly as written and they're perfect to me. Crunchy exterior and chewy inside. Next time I will make half batches as it over flowed my mixer. Used a cookie scoop and wound up with 10 dozen nice sized cookies, no issues with sticking to the pan, used the butter wrappers to grease the pan on first trip to the oven and that was it. They're my favorite, thanks so much Kim for sharing the recipe.

This is the best cookie I have ever had.

I think next time I will do equal parts raisins and chocolate chips.

Halved the recipe = 4 dozen.

These turned out delicious, I made a few changes, I halved the recipe and used 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 unbleached white flour, did not use coconut (I had none in the house) and used dried cranberries instead of choc chips. I did use butter, tho'--I made them for company!

I halved the recipe as well - what a great cookie! I brought them to a meeting and every last morsel was eaten! I used Pecan Pieces too, which was a bit more money but gave a really nice taste.

These are excellent. I halved the recipe (leaving out the raisins) and ended up with 42 large, puffed-up cookies. I baked them one tray at at a time for 11 minutes. Also, I used margarine - butter probably tastes even better but not for my family.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good cookies!  I halved the recipe and still got over 60 cookies (using "heaping teaspoonfuls" of dough per cookie, as recipe states.) Thanks for the recipe!

These were good, but not thick like I had hoped. I did use 1/2 crisco and 1/2 butter. Next time I might try all Crisco.

Great cookies!  The only changes I made were to used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and I used Toll House peanut butter/milk chocolate chips.  I also followed others suggestion to half the recipe.

The best!  Omitted the walnuts and baked them on parchment for more like 13 minutes then let them cool on the cookie sheets about 5 minutes before sliding them off.  Highly recommended!

This recipe was VERY good.  It has a lot of texture & the taste is so yummy! I highly recommend this recipe if you have a "gourmet tongue" who likes to try different things.  I added milk chocolate chips to the recipes for a yummier cookie.

I only make half a recipe at a time, and I leave out the nuts and raisins, but these are very good and I've already made them twice.  Something about the combination of chocolate, coconut, and oatmeal is unusually good.

These tasted great, excpect they weren't as thick as I expected.  They were kind of flat and really stuck to the greased cookie sheet.  Still, I got great reviews from tasters! I like the crispy/chewy texture.

I made only one change to the recipe, using 1 cup of slivered almonds in place of the 2 cups of walnuts. I ended up having so much I had to mix it in my roasting pan.  I made the cookie a heaping teaspoon as instructed, and it made 10 dozen 3" cookies!!!  The cookies were good, but I expected them to be more like ranger cookies  ....they are just a fancy oatmeal cookie.  I would just as soon make the old fashioned oatmeal cookies.
