This was a great summer meal.  I sliced the basil up a little more than was stated and added the juice from one fresh lemon.  Yum!

This was the deal! I really liked the couscous and I used a marinated filet that was delicious. Yum!

Superb! I added a little lemon juice to the couscous and it was excellent. Will make this dish over and over. I like a little more flavor on my steaks so I marinate in worchestershire then sprinkle both sides with Montreal steak seasoning before grilling. Yum!

I made the salad with couscous and doubled the recipe to accomodate four filets.  My husband loved it and it was quick and easy.

Fresh, healthy, light, and especially delicious with a juicy, tender filet.  I used a vegetable peeler to shave the parmesan.  Don't skimp on the pine nuts or parmesan.  The basil could be sliced thinner for better distribution.  Mix in a generous squeeze of lemon.  Be sure to get a little of every ingredient in each bite!  Another plus is this is by Top Chef contestant and all-star, Fabio.

Was very good!  This recipe would be good with chicken as well, probably not quite as good, but still good.  I didn't put the lemon juice, because I wanted to follow recipe for the first time.  Next time I will use lemon juice and 3X the amount of chopped basil.  I also just shredded parmesan very fine.  So, so good can't wait to make again!
