So simple and tastes great! You can really do a lot with this. I added a can of tomato paste and thickened it a little quicker (probably totally illegal!) and added a bit more sugar and some salt and pepper. Very good and fast - loved it!

This recipe was yummy!  I've never made homemade spaghetti sauce before, but I was in a pinch for something quick and easy to fix for supper.  I stumbled upon this recipe and found I had most of the ingredients it called for and it only took 30 minutes to prepare!  The only variations I made were using minced garlic & a little garlic powder, a whole yellow onion (since I did not have any green onions), and I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce & salt to taste.  I was impressed!  I'll definitely make this again!!

SUBSTITUTIONS:  Stevia for sugar
ADDITIONS:  1 lb. hamburger.
I thought the sauce needed to be a bit "thicker" so I added a can of tomato paste.  Turned out nicely and will definitely make again (with above mentioned modifications).

this was a great base recipe that you can do all kinds of things with. i used my home grown tomatoes, basil, and oregano in it instead of canned tomatoes and store bought spices; and put it in my crock pot to cook. i doubled it and will freeze the rest. thanks!
i gave it 4 stars because i too cut the oregano, so i didn't do it exactly as written.

Great spaghetti sauce!  I was in a rush to make tonights dinner so I used 14 oz of petite diced tomatoes (my kids are not a fan of tomatoes so I used only 1/2 of the 28oz can, then I used 1 29oz can of tomato sauce, 1 6 oz tomato paste, 2 tablespoons minced onion, 1/4 tsp minced garlic, 3 tsp basil, 3 tsp oregano and 2 tsp italian seasoning.  I will probably use 2 tsp basil, 2 tsp oregano and 1 tsp italian seasoning which some of the reviewers suggested, but still a great sauce.  Thanks again!

People who rate a recipe they haven't tried simply because they don't like the ingredients are rude! There are millions of recipes on the Internet, if you don't like one for whatever reason, move on! I think this is a good basic sauce and cooks should add/remove any ingredients based on personal preference.

My son is allergic to dairy and it's very hard to find jarred/canned sauces he can eat and most sauces take too long to cook.  This sauce was perfect - and everyone enjoyed it!

Now this is a simple sauce.  And, it's good!  I added frozen meatballs and used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because it was what I had.  Excellent!  I added the frozen meatballs after the sauce started simmering and simmered for 25 minutes.  I don't measure very precisely so I think I ended up with 3/4 of a large onion instead of what it called for.  End result - very tasty and easy sauce.

I usually make a quick meat sauce by using a jar of store bought spaghetti sauce and adding additional seasoning to suit our taste. I was out of store bought and we wanted spaghetti tonight so I began browsing allrecipes for ideas when I came upon this one.


This is a really great basic recipe. Don't ever be afraid to make adjustments for your family. I took a few short cuts and modified it to work with the ingredients I had on hand and adjusted the spices for our taste. These are the changes I made: placed chopped onion (had no green onion) in the same pan I just cooked the 8 minute spaghetti, with 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb hot Italian sausage. Minced 4 garlic cloves and sprinkled them with a pinch of salt and set aside.


I pureed 2 (14.5 oz) cans of Italian style diced tomatoes and added them to the browned meat mixture with the garlic. I added 1- 8 oz can of tomato sauce, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp crushed red peppers, 1 Tbsp sugar, pinch of kosher salt to taste, and rubbed 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning and 1 tsp basil between my hands into the sauce, stirred, and simmered for 20 minutes adding the cooked spaghetti about 1/2 way through. The noodles get to finish cooking and soak up all the great flavors from the sauce. Very yummy and very little clean up!

Tried this recipe with pasta and meatballs.  I think it could use more tomatoes and/or tomato sauce and much less oregano.  The oregano dominated the flavor of the dish even though there were bold flavored meatballs in the dish.  I won't likely make this sauce again, sorry.

Omg, just made this recipe, i usually never write reviews, just read them! But this one deserve a 5 stars... I kinda feel rediculious for using pre made spaghetti sauce, since this was so simple and full of flavor! thanks...

My husband said it tasted like spaghetti in an Italian restaurant! These are the adjustments I made: no green onions, 2 tsp. sugar, 2 tsp. italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper, 1/4-1/2 c. ketchup and 1 lb. browned hamburger. Will definitely make again!

Growing up we called this "Quick Sauce" as opposed to our Sunday "Gravy". It's always been my favorite. Just a few suggesions; when using canned tomatoes, always use San Marzano imported for an over the top authentic flair. Also, fresh basil is a must, the dried does not do justice to Italian recipes. I grow it in the summer and at the end of the season, pick the remaining leaves and put in a food processor with extra virgin olive oil and garlic freeze in a well oiled ice cube tray so I always have a fresh version of basil on hand. Lastly, instead of sugar or sugar substitute, you may want to shave off peeled carrots with a veggie peeler to give a natural sweetness. Otherwise, great recipe!

I gave this a 4-star instead of a 5 because while it's a very good sauce, it could be improved by using whole canned tomatoes instead. It just lends to a more robust sauce.I pour them into a large measuring cup or bowl and squeeze them with my hand before adding to the pan. Letting the sauce cook for awhile will thicken it up if you don't have tomato paste on hand. I also don't add the green onions because they don't add anything to the sauce in my opinion. Once you see how easy it is to make your own sauce, you'll never buy jarred sauce again.

Great quick sauce to just 'throw together'.  I put a chopped bell pepper in with the onions & 1# of lean ground beef. I made this pretty true to recipe, except the green onions (I didn't have any).  I have fresh herbs and added a bit more to my taste and used my own home canned tomatoes, along with a small can of tomato paste (some added for thickening). Picture posted.  I'd give 4.5-5 stars!

Very happy with the sauce.  Very forgiving.  I made it once with diced tomatoes and cut the spices to 3 tbsp.  Very good, a little chunky but that's what I like.  I've also made it with tomato sauce and a can of paste.  The kids like their marinara smooth and it was very tasty.

This ish is the bomb. I added some red onions, and it gave it a very pretty color along with fresh Basil. I also added a ton of crushed garlic and a can of tomato paste. Do yourself a favor- and make it this way.

This was a good recipe to use for a quick sauce.  I ran out of ready made and used this instead of running to the store.  I did use the emulsion blender to make it a smoother sauce rather than a chunky one.

The flavor was good, but I used 1/2 the amount of seasoning called for.  It also could have used some tomato paste to thicken it up.

This sauce was REALLY easy and you probably have all the ingredients in your house already. I will say however that you HAVE TO cut the Oregano in HALF... it is way too much. I also added paste as the sauce otherwise was not as thick as I like it.

Very good basic recipe. Instead of 1 (28 oz) can diced tomatoes, I put 1 can (15 oz) diced tomatoes and 1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce and I have also added some roasted garlic with peppers. In a separate pan, I browned 1 lb ground beef with 1 small can of mushrooms and added it to the tomato mixture.

Perfect! Green onions are essential, they give the sauce it's own special flavor. Since I love the flavor of olive oil, I add a bit more than called for.

I have to admit I tweaked this one a little bit, just for experimentation. I used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes, 3 teaspoons of both dried basil and dried oregano and 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning (oregano, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, basil and sage). I also added a pound of cooked Italian sausage after the first 20 minutes and let it simmer for about 20 more. This sauce was super easy and really, really good. I had begun the day thinking I would make a really complicated recipe for bolognese but ended up with thawed sausage and a late start to the dinner preparations. I am so glad I stumbled upon this recipe at the last minute. Definitely a keeper!! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe doesn't work out at all for us. With so much dried basil and oregano, they never become part of the sauce itself, and it is not appetizing to be eating dried leaves all the time.

This very close to the James Beard recipe that I have used for nearly 40 years. His version doesn't use oregano or green onion, adds fresh garlic and reduces the tomatoes before adding the spices.  If you omit the "Italian" spices and use chili powder and cumin, adding a can of diced green chili peppers to the tomatoes, you will also have a good red sauce for Mexican dishes.

This was so simple and we liked the flavor on this. I cut this in half and used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of diced, a small can of tomato paste and 3 cans of water, and then ended up adding another can of tomato sauce (15 oz.) as this cooked down and I needed to stretch it out. I added a lb. of cooked seasoned ground beef at my husband's request. I let this simmer for 1.5 hours before serving. The next time I will add a pinch of cayenne pepper and double the sugar. Great starting point and good like it is, but this would be easy to add in favorites.

Big hit with my family! I made some modifications, added 1 can tomato soup and 1 small can tomato paste, along with about half pound of cooked ground beef. I used 1 tbsp. brown sugar, and a pinch of salt and pepper as well. I usually use store bought sauce but I'll be doing this from now on!

Used fresh green onions, oregano and basil, chopped fresh from my garden then popped into the sauce. Delicious and much lighter than most sauces that include canned tomato paste and sauce. Once my tomatoes get going, I will have fresh tomatoes, too!

The bones of this sauce are terrific.  I didn't measure the sugar exactly so I think that I used a little more.  BUT, when done, it was the consistency of salsa.  Perhaps I didn't do enough chopping!  I used a submersible blender to make it into a true sauce.  We ate it with meatballs and it was delicious.

This was really quick and easy!  Here were my modifications, and it came out very tasty!  I only had one 14.5 oz can of tomatoes (and they were whole, peeled tomatoes but I just diced them up), so I used that (including the juice in the can) plus one 6 oz can of tomato paste and one 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  I was too lazy to see if I had scallions still growing outside, so I just used up 1/4 of a medium onion and minced two really large cloves of garlic (because I didn't see that they were supposed to be crushed).  While the sauce was simmering, I cooked up 1/2 lb of ground spicy sausage meat and added it to the simmering sauce after about 10 minutes.  Then, I let the sauce simmer some more for 10 minutes to do the total 20 minutes.  We like a lot of sauce on our pasta, so this made about 3 servings.

When my husband was diagnosed with high blood pressure, I really started paying attention to sodium content. I couldn’t believe how much was in jarred spaghetti sauce!! I loved this sauce. However the first time I made it, the oregano was overpowering. The second time I reduced it to 1 tsp, and it was perfect! I also squeezed in some fresh basil paste, which i prefer to

Great sauce.  Simple to make, takes only minutes to put together.    My go-to sauce for all things that look for a marinara sauce.  
You can do so many things to dress this sauce up - add meatballs, or mushrooms,  throw a drop or two of hot sauce in it. 
My family really likes this simple sauce.

My take: I didn't have canned diced  tomatoes so I blanched one and diced it myself. Followed steps and when added tomatoes I also added a can of tomato sauce, and a teaspoon garlic power ( I LOVE garlic).  Added a packet of Sazon with coriander, a pinch of salt and let it simmer. I added some italian sausage and meatballs and it turned out terrific - YUMMY!

If I may suggest,  instead of using a can of diced tomatoes,  Ilike to use a can of minced tomatoes.  Put the minced tomatoes into a food processor to give it a puree. The flavor from the stewed tomatoes make a huge difference.

I've been making my sauce this way for years. The only things I do differently is omit the sugar, use spaghetti seasoning and add roasted italian sausage: brush 4 links (2 sweet and 2 hot) with olive oil and spaghetti seasoning. Roast on a rack at 350 for 20-30 minutes. Mince in a food processor and add to sauce.

This sauce freezes well. I make 4-6 batches at a time and freeze it freezer bags lying flat (4-6 cups of sauce in each bag). It thaws in 10-15 minutes in the sink with room temperature water.

Works really well with those no-cook lasagna noodles for a quick, effortless supper.

Loved it!  I added 1/4 orange bell pepper, a handful of mushrooms, and used fresh basil and oregano.  Every one seems seems to conquere on adding tomato paste.  That probably would have made it a 5.

I started making spaghetti in a hurry one evening before i realized that we had no sauce to go on it. I found this recipe and was pleasantly surprised that it was so flavorful. Since my husband needs meat, I added some cooked ground beef and mushrooms to the sauce. My picky kids devoured their spaghetti, and my husband couldn't say enough about it.  I have to admit that it doesn't look at all like the spaghetti sauces that I'm used to or have made in the past. It looks like it will taste bland with the lack of tomato paste or sauce. My husband said that I should start making it all of the time instead of using the stuff in the jar. Will make again!

I loved this recipe. I changed it up a little bit though.
1 TB olive oil
1 1/2 small onions diced
2 cloves garlic mashed
1 TB dried chives
1 14.5 oz plain hunts petite diced tomatoes
1 10 oz can RoTel original diced tomatoes and green chilis
2 tsp dried basil leaves
2 tsp dried oregano leaves
2 tsp sugar
2 TB ketchup
a dash of salt and a dash of pepper.

after sautéing the onions etc and added the tomatoes, I measured out 3/4 of the mixture and pureed it.. made it thicken up nicely.

I had some homemade meatballs in the freezer so I added those to the pan, covered and simmered for 45 min so the meatballs would heat thoroughly (they were frozen)

I have never made my own spaghetti sauce. This was a really good base recipe. I did not modify the ingredients, but close to the end of the simmer time (once all ingredients were added), I threw the mixture in a blender, giving it more of a saucy consistency.  Mine was cooking up to be more of a chopped tomato consistency and I wanted a sauce. Otherwise, great recipe and VERY simple! I am NOT a cook by any means and this looked the easiest. I will definitely make this again!

My husband and picky kids loved this sauce.  I added mushrooms, bell peppers, a teaspoon of salt, and some red pepper flakes and served it over Stuffed Shells IV.  Although I prefer marinara sauce, my husband and kids thought it would be delicious over actual spaghetti.

4 stars only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Instead of 1 28 ounce can of tomatoes I used 2 14.5 ounce cans of tomatoes with basil and oregano (because of that I also did not add the basil and oregano - and I pureed the tomatoes as I don't like cooked tomato chunks). I also used 1 teaspoon of brown sugar instead of white, as white sweetens it too much for my taste, and I added a pound of hamburger. I had read one review that said tomato paste was added to thicken it...I don't know how thin/thick it is on its own...I sort of "over"-cooked it...burned a couple places actually, but it's a recipe I will follow again, with my adjustments, minus the burning (I hope:-))

Very good base recipe. Made a few additions to suit my families taste. Tomato paste and butter. Then because it was a bit too thick with the tomato paste, I added some beef broth. I won't be buying store bought anymore.  Thanks.

This sauce turned out amazing. Husband and kid approved!  We will definitely be making it again and again since Spaghetti is a favorite in our home!

This is not good.  Way too much oregano and basil.  I would cut those ingredients in half, but I still don't think this particular sauce would be good.  It was significantly overseasoned, but still incredibly bland.

This was a great base recipe. I used scallions instead of onions and two cloves of garlic. The can I used had basil and garlic included in them. I also used tomato sauce and hot Italian sausage. Instead of sugar I used truvia.

This sauce was so easy to make. Once you make this, you will wonder why you buy sauce. I did make a few changes to it, however. I cut the oregano back to 2 tsp because I didn't want it to be so strong. Next time, I think I will also back off on the basil slightly. With just a couple slight modifications, you will have an amazing sauce!

This delicious sauce was a hit with my 4 kids. I made 2 batches, one meatless for a vegetarian version, and another with ground turkey. I'm using the leftovers for homemade pizza sauce tonight so none will go to waste.

I used whole tomatoes instead of canned ones to eliminate unnecessary sodium, skipped the sugar altogether, and reduced the oregano and basil by 1 tsp. to make it tomatoier. The color was a little funky and it needed some body, so I put in some tomato paste.  Ended up being okay, but not great.

It's alright- this sauce is a fine base from which to create your own.  It's just a basic spaghetti sauce.  I added one small can of tomato paste to thicken it.  Then I threw in probably another teaspoon or two of basil, a pinch or two garlic powder, a dash of both salt and pepper, and a small handful of personally shredded Romano (do it yourself for smaller shreds!).  exnay on the oregano. I don't like it at all. Also, make it with the meatball recipe I put on this site. Serve it with any kind of pasta and TA DA... a great meal!

This is a great recipe to use when you have very little time and a near empty pantry.  Its nothing like my normal "cook all day" ingredient loaded sauce but for a meal in a snap this is really good.  My kids love it.

Sauce turned brown. I don't know what happened. I followed the recipe to the tee. Maybe 20 minutes is too long to cook? Don't know? Anyway, I think I will just stick to Ragu.

Easy to make if you don't have any sauce on hand.  I didn't have 28 oz can of peeled diced tomatoes on hand, so I made this with a 14 oz can of tomato sauce and a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and it gave me a very nice marinara.

I wanted spaghetti - was out of the jarred stuff so I made this. I didn't have diced tomatoes so I got a few cans of stewed and pureed them. I did what the other user did and added italian seasoning. I did 2 tsp basil, 2 tsp oregano and 1 tsp of italian seasoning. I also added some meatballs. I left the rest of the recipe the same and it came out excellent. Thanks for helping me figure out how to make sauce last minute!

I used this recipe along with others and I have yet to be disappointed.  Just as a foot note: if you get to an ingredient you don't have and you've already started, Substitute and get as close to it as possible.  You won't be disappointed.

I was just trying to use the tomatos from my garden so they didn’t go to waste and I stumbled on this awesome site. My first time making sauce, It was a huge hit with my fam?? They made me promise I would always make the sauce from now on. My kids put the leftover sauce on the chicken pasta the next night.

Sauce is good. I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes and added one can of tomato paste. I only added 1/2 t of sugar. It turned out very good. Thank you for the recipe.

I used the tomato paste as some others suggested, but I'm not going  to next time. It was a bit too thick. But the flavor was good, and I will make it again, especially now that tomatoes are coming on and I can use fresh instead of canned.

As stated in the bio, this is an excellent outline for tomatoe sauce. We are a family of 7 and no one ever seems to like the same thing. This was a winner for my family. Quick, easy, and I always have the ingredients. I did ad tomatoe paste to thicken it up and a little extra sugar to sweeten it just a tad for my kids. I will be using this many times over, different variations now we have tried the original. Perfect base to throw some meat or veggies in!!

I have made this a few times now that I'm not going back to canned sauce. I don't add the sugar, I forgot the first time and found it wasn't necessary for the flavor. I also add some tomato paste to thicken it up. You can add mushrooms, peppers, or other vegetables to add to the flavor, too.  I don't add any meat, but feel free to add ground beef, sausage, or meatballs.

I loved this recipe it was so simple. It can be made quicker than running to the store and buying a jar of spaghetti sauce. 
I didn't add the sugar. I don't like sweet sauce, so I added a little more salt and it was perfect.

My Mom used to make this when we were kids because we are Catholic and couldn't eat meat on Fridays.  So, to us it is known as Friday Spaghetti.  We adapt to our taste and what's available in the house.  Love using fresh tomatoes but when not available canned are great too.  I love great meals in restaurants, but sometimes I think this is as good as anything I can get out.

I loved cooking  spaghetti sauce from scratch! It is on my menu now to make again! I think I will try cooking it longer and adding a can of tomato sauce to make it more saucy! The spices were delicious and so enjoyable  for the aroma!

Fabulous.  I modified a bit.  Added small can paste, small can sauce and added cayenne pepper. My husband and son couldn't believe I made it

This is a great base for your homemade spaghetti sauce. I changed it up a bit, but it was still great. Instead of a big can of diced tomatoes I used a 14.5 oz can and added two 8 oz cans of tomato sauce. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat. I went a little heavier on the garlic and added salt and a ton of pepper (I like pepper). Great recipe! Definitely recommend it. Especially when you're in a pinch and need to whip up a sauce (my wife forgot to get the Ragu at the store).

I used half a green bell pepper, a can of paste and 6 tsp of sugar instead of one since I'm not fond of acidic sauce.

I used this recipe to go along with homemade chicken parm. I added about a tablespoon of garlic salt and sprinkled Parmesan over the top of it and mixed it in then simmered it for an hour instead of 20 mins and came out great! For my own pleasure I would chop up the onions very finely next time just chopped was too thick for me.

I liked the basic recipe, though I will always and forevermore skip the green onions and blend my sauce after cooking for a bit to give it a smoother texture.  In addition, I will sometimes add pizza seasoning and use it for homemade pizza sauce.  Love it for that!

I will make again. Did make some adjustments. I used crushed tomatoes with basil, reduced basil and oregano to 3 tsp.  Increased sugar to 3 tsp, it breaks down acidity. Added about 1 tsp of salt and pepper. Was tasty and quick!

Nice and simple (and tasty) just like the title says! Perfect for first time 'gravy' maker! I did squeeze in about 1/2 a tube of Trader Joe's tomato paste just because I had it in the fridge and up-scaled the recipe to use the 102 ounce container of diced tomatoes from Costco.

Sautéed 1/2 green pepper along with the onions and garlic.

Added 1/8 cup of dry sherry to sautéed vegetables and reduced until almost dry before adding tomato.

Added 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon salt.

Used 8 teaspoons of Italian Seasoning instead of the 4 teaspoons basil and 4 teaspoons oregano.

I've made this sauce twice and it came out perfect each time.    The key is use ORGANIC crushed tomatoes.  No need for the sugar   You'll taste the difference right away.  The 2nd time I added green peppers and mushrooms for a cacciatore.  Again wonderful.  Now that we are empty nesters, this is the perfect amount for 2 and leftovers the next day for lunch.

I love this recipe! I modified it because I decided to add ground beef to it so I added a can of tomato paste to thicken it. I also used tomatoes from the garden that I had bottled from the spring. It was delicious and it served 8 adults when I doubled the recipe.

I used this recipe as a jumping off place. Made the following delicious modifications because I either felt like it or I didn't have an ingredient:    I used a 16 ounce jar of home grown and canned diced tomatoes, added diced carrots to the sautéed onions and garlic portion, added a squirt of ketchup because I didn't have tomato paste. Added a little vodka, just because. Added home made hot sauce just because. Used brown sugar because that is all I had. Added 1/2 cup fresh basil, replaced the oregano with cilantro because I didn't have the oregano. Added sausage because sausage is delicious! My family loves the sauce. Happy cooking all!

Yum! Served with pasta and meatballs. I left out the onions (personal preference) and increased the amount of tomatoes so I had enough for the meatballs, but otherwise kept as is. Quick and easy recipe, thanks.

I doubled this recipe with one can of diced tomatoes, drained and 1 can of crushed tomatoes. I did about 2 TBSP of Italian Seasoning so I wouldn't have to measure the individual spices out and because my husband is allergic to onions,  I swapped them out for green bell peppers.  Kosher salt, course cracked black pepper along with the garlic and sugar recommended rounded it out.

Since I was making Baked Ziti (from this site too Baked Ziti 1 I believe), I too added about 1 lb of ground beef and 2 lbs of Italian sausage to the sauce and have added mini pepperoni before as well.

This was a wonderful basic recipe that you can add to subtract from to suit your taste.

Good recipe, I added a can of tomato paste to thicken it. I also added a bit of salt, pepper, and a lot more sugar than it called for. Other than that I followed the recipe and the flavor was really good. Overall, very good recipe.   :)

Good, basic recipe for a beginner like myself.  I added yellow, sweet peppers during the saute stage. I used tomato paste as suggested by another reviewer, and, due to a lack of dry or fresh basil, I used an Italian Seasoning blend instead.  To smooth it out for my family members sensitive to texture, I used an immersion blender.  I added mushrooms in after blending for the mushroom lovers.  I found the result to need a little more sugar and some salt. I also added grated Parmesan cheese. The result was a sauce everyone enjoyed!!!

Its really simple and it came out pretty awesome! This is a pretty good base recipe for you to tweak how you like. I added some chopped bell peppers and mushrooms, and added a little bit of tomato paste to make it a little bit thicker--but that's just for me. I'm definitely going to share this recipe with the fam!

What a wonderful recipe,  I did use my fresh canned tomatoes and fresh basil.  I also used a little more sugar and a can of tomato paste.  I realy love this recipe thanks so much for posting it!!  If your sauce is to acid tasting add 1 and a half teaspoon baking soda until it stops bubbling.  It realy works!

This isn't the best spaghetti recipe out there, but for what it is, it is great. I like it because it is my go-to recipe when I need dinner quickly and don't have food in the house. It's one of the few sauce recipes that doesn't take an hour but also uses things that I always have in my pantry. (Sometimes I use different tomato products, depending on what I have on hand and although it changes the consistency, every variant has been good.)

We were out of spaghetti sauce, so I tried this out with a can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  I also added my few touches, like salt, garlic powder, onion powder, etc.  It turned out great!

Delicious! Just looked for a recipe for tonight and this popped up. I did exactly as written,  except I added a pound and a half of ground beef. It was a huge hit with my picky daughters and their friends!

Way to much herbs. I think if you cut back on the amount of Basil,and Oregano by at least a teaspoon each, it would be perfect. I think I will make it again but cut the dried herbs in half.

very easy and simple. I pureed some fresh veggies (carrots, red, yellow, and orange bell peppers) to add more flavor and hide the veggies from my granddaughters. I used italian seasonings and added hamburger and italian sausage.

I used a can of tomato paste and 3 cans water because my husband doesn't like lumps of tomato.  Yummy results from slow cooking for 4 hours.

I cut dried herbs by half (personal preference) and since I didn't have green onions, increased diced onion a bit to compensate.  Also added 1 large grated carrot to the sauteing onion.  Adding the carrot not only helped to thicken the sauce later, but it got some extra nutrients happening.  You can't even tell the carrot is there!  Due to my changes, I rate this sauce a solid 4.

This a great basic recipe that can be altered to personal preference.  I omitted the green onion and sugar. Added 1 packet of "SPLENDA"  I also used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomato. Added 1 can tomato paste, mushrooms, shredded carrot, and zucchini.  I also decreased seasonings, as I do not like an over bearing  basil and oregano taste.

All I could taste was the basil and oregano.  Added more sauce, sugar , and additional spices to make it edible.  Family wasn't impressed at all, and my husband said it smelled funny.  It was all the oregano and basil.

Have made this twice already and love it. We have been adding a pound of hot deer sausage after the onions and garlic. I've also added 2 tablespoons of red wine with the meat and then 2 tablespoons of butter at the very end. The tomato paste idea is a also really good. Anyway, thanks so much for the recipe. Hooked on this:)

Uh...guys, this is awful.  4 teaspoons each of basil and oregano? This was just thick chunky mush and the flavor will not leave my mouth.

This was very good.  I made a few changes to use what I already had.  I used one can italian stewed tomatoes and one can tomato sauce.  I also used dried onions and one splenda packet.  I was very good!  I wanted something easy and it was very easy!

I should have questioned the 4 tsp each of oregano and basil - overload of those two.  Next time I will cut those each in 1/2 - I used my Cuisinart quick prep hand blender and pureed a lot of the tomatoes to make a thicker sauce.

This sauce was good..my picky daughter even loved it..I did alter it, however to suit our taste; I used a 6 oz can of tomato sauce and 1/2 chopped and peeled fresh tomato instead of the canned tomatoes.  I also didn't have any green onion which I didn't taste it missing. I used all the other ingredients in the recipe and it came out just delicious!  Has a slightly sweet flavor ..tasted gourmet..Yum!

I think this recipe was absolutely AMAZING! I made  a few substitutions to my liking as well ( i can't help making a recipe my own!) I added a green bell pepper, used about 2 1/2 teaspoons of garlic, and added more oregano. I will use this recipe all the time, I love it and so does my family!

I was looking for a simple basic sauce and this was perfect!  I substituted a can of tomatoe sauce for one of the cans of tomatoes to help thicken plus I added italian sausage and mushrooms.  I simmered it for about 2 hours and the flavor was wonderful. Tastes great and very easy to make. I will make this again and again.

I was so distraught at having forgot to pick - up a bottle of spaghettti sauce, until I realized I could look up recipe and try making it.  I'm glad I did! I'm not a buying another bottle now that I discovered how easy and enjoyable this sauce is :)

I didnt have any garlic so i tried only using garlic powder, that didnt help AT ALL. I have no complaints about the recipe besides the oregano being VERY over powering, next time i will do 2 tsp. however, this could be because of the lack in garlic.

My granddaughter and I made this sauce…  We did not have fresh or peeled tomatoes, so I used a 28-oz can crushed tomatoes…. Sauce came out semi-chucky…Will try fresh herbs instead of dried...they didn't seem to soften...but didn't matter...simmered for 2 hours...on low... Sauce had perfect flavor! We love it…she even ate two helpings of noodles! No more store bought sauce!

This is a keeper! Why buy bottled sauce, when you can easily follow this recipe and create something wonderful?

My husband made this for our pizza dinner tonight because we ran out of my homemade sauce after the first pizza.  It was quick and tasted really good considering the ease of it.  Plus, you don't need all of the ingredients on hand if you don't have them - the sauce still came out great.  For example, I know he used butter to saute the onion and garlic and he didn't use green onions because we didn't have them.  Also, he couldn't find the basil and oregano in the spice cabinet (go figure!) so he skipped it and added a pinch of crushed red peppers and subbed brown sugar for the white.  All in all it was great.

This was very easy to make. But in my opinion it was too sweet.

Very Easy and Versatile! I doubled the recipe (will freeze half), didn't use any green onions, and added a small diced zucchini.  I hate jarred sauce (it's got this weird sweet tangy flavor) so I was looking for something to put in various pasta dishes, perhaps as a pizza sauce.  This turned out just right- not too sweet, not too salty.

This is incredibly easy, but it tastes great.  When in a pinch, I used dried minced onion and it tasted just fine like that too.

I just made this & it tastes great.I made a smaller amount & had to omit the onions because they cause me to have headaches.It still tastes good & thickened enough just by simmering.Thanks to Courtney.

If my husband had anything to say about this rating system, I would give this recipe 10 stars.  I was really truly impressed at how great this tasted.  I made a bigger batch of this by adding 14 ounces of crushed tomatoes and adjusting the listed spices accordingly.  I also used Splenda in place of the regular sugar.  It was soooooo good that the next day, my husband insisted that I cook more pasta so that he can use the leftover sauce (which was plenty and is freezable).  Courtney, thank you soooo much for such an awesome-tasting and quick/easy recipe.  This is one of those recipes that will be used every week and I'll make sure to teach my kids how to make this once they're a little older.  :o)

I thought this recipe was pretty bad honestly. I was in a hurry, I had these things on hand so I was happy. When it was time to serve it no one wanted it. I would have done better buying a can of Ragu.

This was excellent!  I made it for some friends, it didn't last long.  The only adaptations were that i added a green bell pepper, and used 3 cans of diced tomatoes, i pureed the sauce after it had cooled down to room temperature the night before.  I then reheated it the following night for friends.  Great served with parmesan cheese!

I loved this spaghetti sauce! I added only yellow and white onions, like 1/2 teaspoon more sugar, regular diced tomatoes and tomato paste! It was great and my entire family adored it!

I love how easy this is and that it is a perfect base to do whatever you wish. Next time, I will add a lot more spice (salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, more basil, more garlic, more oregano) and will include tomato paste to make it a bit thicker. Flavor was good - just not enough for me. :)

Really easy and also a breeze to adjust to your taste. I did 14oz. Tomatoes and 14oz. Tomato sauce. I also didn’t have green onion so omitted those. I added 1lb. Seasoned beef to the sauce and it was really thick so I added 1/2 cup water to thin it out and added some salt and pepper. Tasted great!

I don't know what happened...it was okay. I followed all the instructions except used crushed tomatoes. Maybe I'm just used to store spaghetti sauce. I expected it to be really delicious but it wasn't.

I made it and really wanted it to taste good since it was so easy. Nope, didn't happen! If I ever make it again, I will sauté the garlic with the onions in the beginning, and add less oregano (probably half of what recipe calls for). 

Probably won't make it again. I'm a little disappointed!

I have made this many times. It is a quick, easy and tasty meal. I typically add a pinch of cyan and serve it with zucchini noodles.

Was not a huge hit with everyone, but i think it's good for a basic sauce.

Quick, easy and delicious! I used crushed tomatoes instead and it turned out great! Used this for Chef John's chicken parmesan recipe, and it worked out perfectly!

I thought there was way too much basil and oregano in this sauce and using diced tomatoes wasn't the best choice.

With a few tweaks we loved this.  Added one can tomato sauce and probably 1/4 cup tomato paste, added sliced olives, Italian seasoning  salt and pepper.  Tripled the sugar (maybe more sugar than thatneven)and added garlic powder, just tasted and adjusted as I cooked.  The whole family wanted more.  Quick recipe and a lot better than jar sauce.

Sorry but as is we did not think this recipe was very tasty.  Had to add a ton of other spices to doctor it up.  Will keep looking
