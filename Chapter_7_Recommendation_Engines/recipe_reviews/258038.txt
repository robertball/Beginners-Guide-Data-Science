A Marinara sauce that kicks nicely, would be good with black mussels or other seafood as well.

What can I say? Chef John did it again! The extended cooking method made the most tender calamari I ever had. Local grocer didn't have serrano pepper so I substituted with jalapeno,  which is just not as hot. Excellent recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  We live in the PNW and can get fresh squid...I didn't use the clam juice, as I like my sauce a bit drier.  The anchovy filet gives such a nice taste to this dish!  We lived in Italy for 4 years with the military, and I felt transported back to that time when I ate this sauce!

It made a spectacular sauce and meal.  I substituted half tablespoon of black pepper and left out the anchovie to reduce the salt content.

Very nice bite to it.  Wil do again.
