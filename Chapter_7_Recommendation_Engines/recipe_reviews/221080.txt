I was looking for something different to do with my chicken breasts and this recipe was on the front page including a video on how to prepare.  So easy and tasty and a big hit with the family!  Didn't have to run to the grocery store because I had everything on hand.  *I lied -  except for the chipotle seasoning!  I did a web search and found I could use a paprika, red pepper with a dash of chili powder as a substitute.  About 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/8 red pepper and a dash of chili powder.  Will look for chipotle seasoning for the next time I make this!

This was awesome and super easy! The only change I made was to scale this to 6 servings and used vegetable broth instead of chicken.

This is an amazing recipe! Easy and so very flavorful. I've made it several times and it's always perfect. I read a review about this being bland, that couldn't be further from the truth.  You are the boss of your own seasoning.

YUMMY! This is definitely a must try for anyone, very easy to make.  I doubled the entire recipe (except the butter, because that adds too much fat) I used 25% less sodium chicken broth and just 1-2 tablespoons of LIGHT butter. Instead of the chipotle seasoning, I used what another person had commented (1/2tsp paprika, 1/8tsp crushed red pepper and a dash of chilli powder and it worked out great. A little heat but not too much.) There was no left overs and I will be making this again! Save the calories/salt/fat where you can! =)

I could not find chipotle chile powder so I used cajun seasoning.  Put a bit on the chicken too.  Gravy was so good.  Watch the video if you are not a gravy expert and you will master it!!  I also shredded the leftover chicken and mixed it with the gravy for lunch the next day.  Gravy is awesome

2.5 stars.  While this recipe was very simple and quick to make, it lacked depth and complexity of flavor.  Wasn't really spicy, wasn't really anything.  We found it bland and unexciting.  It wasn't bad (or gross) it was just nothing we'd ever make or eat again (based on how many other amazing recipes there are out there).  Guess it wasn't for me.

As I have begun to learn to cook in order to reduce my monthly expenses while still eating well, I found this recipe more than anything else really helped me grasp the process of cooking in a pan, keeping the oil and gravy from evaporating, etc. I think the author is correct about it being an excellent entry level recipe. It tastes quite good too.

Yeah, this was good!  Browning the chicken really added to it.  I liked dark meat, and left the bone in.  O, and I replaced the chipotle powder with chipotle in adobo sauce, minced.  awesome!

Made this today for my family and all I can say is FABULOUS!!! I made double the gravy and found a Mrs. Dash southwestern chipotle seasoning that was delicious! Steamed brown rice seasoned with chicken bouillon on the side and BON APETITE!!!

This is a great recipe!  I've made it several times and haven't had to change a thing about it for it to be delicious.  The chicken breasts are always moist and tender - not something I can say about every recipe I've tried using chicken breasts.  The gravy is so easy and it's never failed me either.  A seriously good, easy recipe!

This was utterly FABULOUS! I wasn't sure about the "gravy", I'd call it a sauce, but was it ever good! There wasn't a single bit left and my husband and son are requesting I add it to the regular rotation. Ridiculously easy recipe, tastes like you slaved all day in the kitchen. I am a new fan of Chef John's recipes!

Used boneless pork chops and followed almost to the "T" except I added a splash of sherry towards the end and some chopped fresh parsley. Very good and simple recipe.  Served with roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts.

seriously yummy stuff - I had a little bit before I left for a meeting and was hoping to have more when I got home, but the rest of the family finished it off ... that rarely happens, especially with gravy

Thank you chef John!  I'm always looking for new chicken recipes on All Recipes this was by far the family favorite! So delicious!  Had most of the ingredients but had to run to Walmart for the chipotle chili powder which they did not have.  I decided to substitute it with "Grill Mates" Chipotle Pepper seasoning (was the closest thing I could find) and it turned out AMAZING!! 5 stars all the way and added to my favorites!

This was a very good recipe.  However I used less than 1/4 of the recommended chipotle chili powder and it was fine.  I suggest that unless you like your food thermonuclear, you consider cutting the amount of chipotle chili powder.

This is a good gateway recipe to get you to experiment with pan sauces.   I personally didn't care for the chipotle flavor in this sauce, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good recipe that can't be easily modified for any other seasonings you might want to try.

This is one delicious and easy recipe! I served it with angel hair pasta and broccoli and my hubby and I both loved it. I tripled the recipe to make 4 servings, and used 3x everything except the butter. It is soooo good with the pasta. For those who found this bland, the recipe needs more salt in addition to seasoning the chicken. Try adding salt to the sauce to bring out more flavour. I thought the sauce was bland, too, until I added salt and cooked a few more minutes. Also, I would recommend getting chipotle pepper and not substituting. It has a smokiness that I can't see in the combination of paprika, chilli and red pepper. 5 stars and thanks for sharing! Will be making this again and again.

EXCELLENT recipe!  Easy and the end result is wonderful!  Very popular with our guests and served over buttered linguini, fantastic.  *Remember,  chipotle chile powder can be quite spicy if you are not used to it.  I use McCormick Smoked Chipotle chile powder for a smoky kind of rustic taste.  Yum!

This is a great recipe for chicken. I used a Jaccard meat tenderizer to flatten the chicken prior to seasoning with salt and pepper. I, also, had a hard time finding the Chipotle Chile Powder so I bought Crushed Chipotle Chile and reduced it to powder with my mortar and pestle. The alternative was to buy it online in a quantity that would have lasted 20 years if it only survived that long; according to the herb site, when this spice turns color, about 6 months, it's time to toss it and buy more. I think I will keep crushing to powder my Crushed Chipotle Chili in the bottle..... 

Great Recipe though John and very tasty. Serving this with Chipotle seasoned jasmine rice and steamed broccoli.

This was really easy and pretty darn good!  I would have added a bit of the seasoning to the actual chicken before searing it because it was a little lacking in flavor to me.  The gravy was fantastic tasting, I was just left wanting the actual chicken to taste more like that.

I thought this was really good and the pan gravy was easy to make.  It was my first time doing it and it came out wonderfully!  I did add more chipotle because my boyfriend and I like a lot of heat.

I substituted smoked paprika for the chipotle. My son said “this is exactly the flavor I think of when I want something savory.” Definitely a keeper!

This had some heat! I doubled the recipe and served mine over creamy mashed potatoes to balance the spice. We were sniffly and tingly by the end of the meal, but grinning ear to ear too.  I'd happily make this again.

This was so quick and easy! Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I made it as recipe states, except I used a few dashes of  Chipotle sauce instead of Chipotle Chili Powder.It could be yummy with some mushrooms and/or capers, which I will try next time.

I made this according to the recipe with 2 exceptions.  I added a little bit of garlic powder.  When I tasted the sauce before serving it was too spicy for me so I added one heaping tablespoon of sour cream in hope of "cooling" it down some.  That didn't work.  It was still too spicy for me to even eat.  I should note that I didn't even use the full amount of chipotle powder.  That said, my husband LOVED this recipe.  He said that it was very spicy, but he like spicy.  He said if he could up the rating to SIX stars, he would.  I will make it again for certain, but just for him.  He said it's the absolute best of all of the recipes I've tried from Allrecipes.  I am a wuss when it comes to spicy food.

The meal came out real good the only thing is that you need to be careful when adding the Chipotle. Because it would be real easy to make the dish too spicy.

This has really nice taste, and has great instruction on how to make a pan gravy.  I grew up with homemade pan gravies.  and make my own.  but followed the instructions here to see how it would go.  turned out great with nice flavor.  Thank you Chef John for helping the Gravy challenged to make a nice pan gravy.  I will make this again, the chipotle gives the gravy a nice heat.

This is a very tasty new way for me to cook yet another chicken. Thank you Chef John. For those of you trying to find the Chipotle, try the ethnic section in your supermarket, Badia makes a great and inexpensive one. In fact, to save money I always check out their spices before paying the crazy high prices in the regular spice isle.

One of the best and easiest recipes to make. Its delicious. I didn't have chipotle pepper on hand so used combination of paprika and chilli powder. The gravy is so easy to make and the video helps a lot.

Made this for dinner last night and it was fabulous!  Like another reviewer, my husband is not a gravy fan and he was practically licking the plate to get every drop!  I also like another reviewer was out of chipotle powder so used cajun seasoning.  This will be a frequent at our house.  We served it over wild rice.

I really like this simple delicious recipe.  I've made it a few times each time trying something a little different.  Just an idea that was good for me substitute the chipotle with curry powder. 

Again a simple yet good recipe that lends itself to experimentation.

I’ve been making this for years! My family loves this recipe and I’m just now reviewing it because my husband specifically asked for it this week. Go for it and make with sour cream mashed potatoes and a simple vegetable. The only change I made was- as others suggest- sprinkle chipotle powder on the chicken for more depth of flavor. It is absolutely delicious. Thanks Chef John!

Yummy. I could not find chipotle powder so I ended up using 2 chipotle Chiles with sauce, into the gravy!  It was so good. It’s a definite keeper

I Increase the ingredients for the gravy, otherwise, I felt it was a little dry. Also, used guajillo chile (3 tsp) for a little milder but fuller chile flavor.

So good! I love this cooking method for chicken. I'm only giving four stars because I used boxed gravy rather than make my own, and skipped the onions and chipotle. I will absolutely make again, and next time I will probably add some sliced onions, minced garlic, and some red pepper flakes.

I really liked this recipe. Followed it exactly except I doubled the sauce as we like extra sauce.  It went together fast , looked nice and tasted good.  My husband usually isn't too enthusiastic about chicken but the sauce carried the day!  Will definitely make it again.

It was good. The chicken came out juicy and crispy. The gravy was pretty bland for us, but my fiance really liked it over all. We served with mash potatoes. I always add cayenne to my flour when i bread chicken and this added another layer of flavor. I didn't cook the flour first that was my mistake.

This recipe has become a staple for my family. The chicken is so tender. I like to add some sliced sweet onions and crimini mushrooms to the gravy too.  I'm on a Keto diet and this work well if I use cornstarch in place of flour.

Made exactly as directed except I perhaps could have pounded the breasts a little more aggressively.  This was excellent! Not too complicated, served with simple mash potatoes and broccoli, Sunday dinner was fabulous.  And Monday lunch wasn't bad either.  Thanks Chef John. Another one to the regular rotation.

3 Stars.  Although I would maybe rate it a little higher due to the ease of the recipe.  It was tasty and quick.  We had everything on hand.  However, it didn't stand out so next time I will try a different chipotle chicken recipe.

Made more gravy (more flour and more chicken stock).
Sprinkled with cheese and topped with sour cream. Served with cilantro lime rice.  So quick and easy!
Chipotle powder is great.  Can get spicy for those that don't care for too much spice.

I used pork loin chops instead of chicken since they were on sale at my grocery store this week. They were thin enough that I didn't have to pound I didn't have chipotle chili powder so I used 1/4 tsp of regular chili powder, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and a dash of cumin. The gravy turned out wonderful and my husband and son raved about it. The best part was it was so fast and easy to make. A definite keeper!

I actually used this on cubed steak instead of on chicken so I probably shouldn't be reviewing it at all, but it is SO GOOD!  I coated the steaks with a little salt, pepper, and flour before I browned them and I used beef broth instead of chicken.  I served this with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.  Very good.

Chef John, this was a fantastic chicken dish.  I served it with Brazilian rice and my boyfriend licked the plate clean!  I followed your instructions to a "T" and the chicken (and GRAVY) came out perfect!  Will DEFINITELY be saving this recipe!

I made just one change to accommodate my low sodium diet.  Rather than seasoning chicken with salt and pepper I used a spicy pepper blend rub.  I then used that rub in place of the chipoltle powder.  But the idea here was all Chef John and I thank you.

I have to say I doubt I have ever followed a recipe exactly but I used it as the basis for the Chipotle Chicken I made last night for dinner.  I made more than the recipe calls for since I wanted leftovers for  tonite.  Changes I made (I do not measure) is I used an onion instead of green onion and put them in the chicken after browning it to cook.  I did cut the three large chicken breasts I had into chunks.  I added extra chicken stock and added an 8 oz package of cream cheese because I wanted a creamy sauce.  I kept tasting for seasoning and added more chipotle powder to taste and added garlic powder as well.   I wanted it spicy but not too spicey.  Served it over noodles. It was delicious and I really liked that the main seasoning was the chipotle.  Usually I use it with other mexican spices so it doesn't usually stand out.  It was very fast to prepare.  I used cornstarch mixed with chicken stock at the end to thicken it a bit.  I added some lime juice at the end to brighten it up.  It was delicious and I can't wait for leftovers.  I am sure chef John's original recipe is very delicious, but like I said I use recipes for ideas and my own variations.

Great! Easy!Everyone loved it!! I used a smoked sweet paprika instead of the chipotle only because that's what I had on hand. I also used 3/4 cold stock plus 1/4 white wine. I should have added a wee bit more flour as it was more saucy than gravy, but that's not a bad thing. Served over linguini.

We were looking for something different when I came across this recipe... it was delicious! I rubbed the chicken with seasoned salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper and some "Mrs Dash" extra spicy seasoning mix. Just cooking the chicken smelled great! I used canned chipotle peppers in abodo sauce; 2 peppers and 2 tsp of sauce. It was very, very spicy! When I make it next time, I'll use the same amount of peppers and sauce but double the amount of base gravy. Everyone loved it,  the only complaint was there wasn't enough sauce! I served it over egg noodles with some broccoli, smothered the whole plate in sauce.

I used chicken thighs, and as a result, there was no need for pounding the meat with a mallet (as it was already thin enough), so using thighs instead of breasts is a good option, if you are looking to eliminate that step. The flavor was excellent, the chipotle chili powder and green onions were the staples that made the whole thing come together. It did have a nice kick, but not an unreasonable amount of spice.

Best chicken and gravy I have ever had!  Hubby rated it 10 stars.  Preparation was easy and quick. Served with steamed broccoli , mashed potatoes and a fresh loaf of Italian bread.  Would be perfect for serving to guests.  This goes into the rotation.

Husband and son liked this one--nice, flavorful gravy.  No, for those who are looking for a punch between the eyes, this sauce won't do it--it's a tad more subtle than that, and yet, a bit different.  It was not complicated to make and could be considered a "30-minute meal", which I appreciate on a busy work night.  This is a keeper for us!

This was so good! I did make one error - I used a chicken bouillon base which had a  lot of flavor, but also lot of salt in it, and then I also added the salt in the recipe which made it a bit too salty, but not overly so, and it was so delicious and easy to make that I think it will be one of my top 10 recipes!  No kidding!  thanks once again, Chef John.  You're a wonder of nature!

My boyfriend and I love this recipe and have made it several times. I make the chicken stock out of bullion and add some diced onion for texture. We don't change anything else, but recommend making more of the sauce as it is super delicious over rice.

Oh, if you have an electric stove take the pan off the burner for a minute or two and let the burner cool to the recommended setting before making the sauce. I wasn't smart enough to do this the first time and just turned down the heat and started making it. The rue burned right away and I had to remake it.

This chicken is so good. So easy and quick yet tastes like I've spent hours making it. I love that it uses ingredients that are always on hand. I made this as written with the exception of doubling the gravy. Another winner Chef John, thanks. June 22.17 Update. I made this again but was out of chipotle so I subbed cajun and liked it better.

Chicken slightly overcooked.  Perhaps oil too hot.  Cooked for 4 min on each side.  Maybe 3min would be good.  Sauce amounts were enough for only one piece.  Make 4x the amount of sauce for 4 people.

Substituted garlic powder for chipotle. Results were a delicious, moist garlicky chicken with a smooth, shiny sauce. Easy and quick. Excellent comfort food.

Excellent!   I cut/shred the chicken afterwards, double the gravy, triple the chipotle and add a carton of sour cream, and pour it all over penne.

Amazing!
I did add a bit of salt and pepper to gravy (to taste) since that's just how I've always made gravy. I added creole seasoning to the chicken before cooking, because I use it in everything.  I needed a bit more chicken broth to get the gravy to the consistency I like, especially since the chicken sits in it a minute or so-thickens up quick.

I loved this meal. I recommend using a little more oil o keep the chicken moist, and making the gravy and the chicken at the same time rather than one at a time.

I did everything except the chipotle and green onions.  I added chili powder and cayenne pepper and about 5 mins before serving I added fresh basil leaves (cut up).  I also cooked the chicken in the sauce longer than the recipe said.  It turned out fantastic!!! It was nice and spicy.  My husband cleaned his plate and went back for seconds, plus he's taking for lunch tomorrow!! Safe to say, this recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is freaking delicious. I made this today for Thanksgiving dinner and omg it was so perfect. This is the second time I made it and I want more each time, but I have to restrain myself because it is very heavy with the mashed potatoes I make with it (and it is too yummy).

I don't change anything for this recipe. But I always triple this recipe because I love gravy. And I only put about 3 to 4 shakes of the chipotle powder in because the taste is very distinct and not a lot is needed for that flavor. 

Delicious! I will make it again and again :D Thank you for this recipe.

I only made the sauce and used prepared frozen chicken breasts.  The sauce really made the meal feel completely homemade!  It was delicious:  tangy, flavorful, smooth and a lovely color.  It was also quick to make.  I will definitely make this again and most likely for company!

I thought my husband was going to pick up his plate and lick off the gravy....which is funny but to me it meant it was phenomenal because he doesn't normally do gravies/dipping sauces.  So easy to make.

Essy, quick, and very tasty - I added salt as the recipe says, and didn't have reduced sodium broth. Not being a salt user at all, it was very salty for me. My extremely picky daughter LOVED it.  I will definitely make this again and again - without adding salt.

All I can say is WOW!   We prefer dark meat so I actually used legs and thighs.  With bones and skin on, it make more greese after frying so I used more flour and chicken broth.  I also probably used at least a tablespoon of the Chipolte Chile Pepper.  What an incredible taste.  My husband said he loved it.  I have never tasted anything that chef John has done and been dissapointed.

This has a permanent place in my meal planner. I've made this recipe many times and always turns out great. I've even done it with steak or porkchops. It changes the gravy to suit the meal. Have fun and try different meats and broths. Yum yum!!

This was EXCELLENT. I didn't use all of the chile powder since my husband doesn't like his food too spicy, and it was still great. I do highly recommend doubling the sauce, as I did so and don't think there would've been enough otherwise. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very simple to make BUT we found it very bland. I followed the recipe to the letter but if I did it again I would need to add a lot more chilli.

This was super delicious! The Hubster really liked this as well! It's quick, simple, and savory! I served this with corn and potatoes and I will definitely be making it again. Someone said this was bland, and we completely disagree. It had the perfect amount of spice. It's on my list of tasty meals!

Really great recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for (other than doubling the servings). The whole family loved it. Thanks Chef John.

This was amazing! I cooked 3 chicken breasts and doubled the gravy to serve over rice. My daughter, who usually doesn't care for rice, had a second helping just so she could have more gravy!

So good! I didn't have chipotle powder and didn't feel like running to the store in the snowstorm, so I used 1/4 t smoked paprika with a pinch of cayenne and a pinch of chili powder. The hubby, mister I-don't-like-chicken even liked it! That's saying a lot!

This recipe was great!  I don't understand how some say it didn't have much flavor. You control that and he tells you that. We loved it!

I love Chef John's recipes. I love the cooking tips and cooking info. I add sweet onions and brown then I add the flour and brown and follow the rest of the recipe. This makes a nice southern brown gravy or I use the recipe as is if I want a lighter gravy. Chef John is indeed a PRO

I doubled the sauce.
Liked this, can't say it was bland because the pepper makes it spicy, but I bet it could have a more interesting taste to it with something sweet in it like pineapple chunks,  as in a sweet and sour sauce.
Next time will try it that way!
Served this over couscous.
So easy!

I made more gravy due to the love of it over mashed potato's and a salad.  I think it need a little more kick, will experiment, but it is a great base, thank-you chef John!!

This was delicious.  Like a previous rater, I had to improvise on the chipoltle seasoning.  Since I had smoked paprika I used that mixed with chilli powder and cayenne.  Very easy, very tasty.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks Chef John!

A simple recipe that tastes like it took a lot more effort than it did. Instead of 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder, I used 3/8 tsp regular chili powder and 1/8 tsp ground red pepper. The extra gravy tasted excellent over rice.

I loved this recipe.  I made it for the first time for company and everyone loved it.  My husband said it was restaurant quality. (Good restaurant that is.). The gravy was so flavorful and the chicken was moist and tasty.  It was very easy to make.  Other than doubling the recipe, I followed it exactly.  This has made me want to start cooking again.

I loved this dish.  I usually do not eat chicken breasts, and would have substituted for thighs if the store had not of run out of them, because I find breast meat so dry and tasteless.  
But the breasts were very tender, didn't even need a knife, and I LOVED the Gravy.  Whole family loved it. No changes or additions needed if you can avoid it (except for how much you want to make.)  A keeper!!  Will make again, for sure!!!

Yum!!  Even after I finished my chicken, the subtle heat and flavors that lingered in my mouth had me saying "Yum".  This was so easy and delicious that I e-mailed my whole family to share it with them.  Thanks!

This was a sure hit.  Usually I make the simple meals and my better half makes the gourmet style meals.  This one was both simple and impressive.  I will make it again.

Tried this recipe for a quick dinner four months ago.  It was a hit we make it once a month now.  We love to spice and the gravy.

This was such a hit with my husband that after I made it he asked me to make more.  The first time I made it I used vegetable broth because that's what I had on hand.  I use a southwest chipotle mix of spices.  This is super easy to make and absolutely delicious.

This recipe was so delicious my husband licked his plate and had seconds! I didn't have "chipotle"chili powder so I substituted it with Cajun spice which contained chili powder. You could add different spices to experiment with different flavors. I think I will do next time. Impossible to be boring!

I made this meal for my family, and it was a hit! If you are looking for a meal that is fast to prepare with little ingredients, don't pass this recipe up. I dropped the chipotle chili powder and minced green onions to fit my kids taste, but it still turned out well, and my family is asking me to make it again.

My family LOVED the gravy.  The video sure did help this not-so-great cook.  I couldn't find chipotle powder so I used a dash of red pepper flakes, a teaspoon of paprika and a dash of creole seasoning.  It was a hit!
