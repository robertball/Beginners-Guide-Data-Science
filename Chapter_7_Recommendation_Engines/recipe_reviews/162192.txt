I love Tajin! It's basically the same as the Italian frtitta-- chicken/meat, veggies, and cheese all held together by a cheese and eggs= tons of flavor! This recipe looks pretty authentic. You can also take out the chicken/meat and add more vegetables (broccoli, carrots, peas, eggplant etc..) and make it vegetarian. You can sneak in the veggies by pureeing them, picky eaters (for example, some little ones) won't know the difference. After you bake it, cut it into squares. The left-over squares can be reheated or eaten cold right out of the fridge. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

this was very good.  I did add 1/2 tsp. more of the ras el hanout.  I didn't taste the spinach, although it did add nice color and is healthy.  I think next time I would add parsley instead for more flavor.  I cheated and used the pre-packaged hash browns and it worked nicely.  You could also substitute lamb for the chicken.  Reminds me of my sister-in-law's cooking and my wonderful visits to Tunisia.  thanks for the great recipe; hubby loved it. Had bought carrots and peas so used that instead; pretty color.

I live in Tunisia, and my husband is Tunisian. This recipe is spot on and hubby complimented my Tajin skills! I used parsley instead of spinach and omitted the peas. What else.. oh yeah, I'm making it again tonight with dinner!

Pretty tasty!  I feel like the meat could be seasoned a bit more and perhaps the potatoes, before its all combined.  Otherwise, great dish for a family meal night.

THIS WAS AWESOME! We're always tight on time in the morning, and I was looking for a hearty breakfast that I could make in advance and quickly reheat. This recipe really fit the bill! I made some changes to the spices given what I had on hand-- using parsley, oregano, and cumin instead. I am sure it would have been even better if I used the more authentic spices,  and will definitely make this recipe to specifications in the future.

I  learned how to make this 5 yrs ago when I married my husband who is from Tunisia. It is a very easy recipe to do. I love it and goes best with chicken I must agree. I make it quite often along with tunisian dish called bric. Make it every night during Ramadon. Try it and guarantee it will be a favorite for you too.

Tajin has always been one of my favourite Tunisian foods and I've watched many friends make it. I would give my finished tajin a 5 star rating, but I didn't exactly follow this recipe. I used this concoction as a base and then took ideas from time in my Tunisian friends' kitchens. What I made was LOVED by many different families of Tunisian friends -- "oh Allyssa, benina y'sr, bilhuq!" ("Oh Allyssa, very delicious, really!") Here's what I changed: 
- about 2.5 tsp ras el hanout,
- added about 0.5 tsp tumeric,
- put in no harissa, 
- no water
- no tomato sauce, 
- no peas, 
- added about 1.5 times the spinach
- added more than a pinch of salt. 
I followed the direction as given, but ended up mixing the potatoes back into the chicken and spinach mixture. It was all nice and moist. This is where I tasted and added some more salt and ras el hanout. 
Just before baking, I added a few table wedges of "laughing cow" style cheese, as I'd seen friend do in the past. 
I will definitely make this modified version again!
