I will make it again.  It was delicious.  I used canned green beans instead of fresh carrots instead of sweet potatoes.  My husband does not like sweet potatoes.  I will definitely make it again.

I did not add onion as they upset my son's tummy. The rest of the recipe as printed. It was just OK. Way too long for the chicken, I did  recognized this, so cooked for shorter time. Some crockpots cook faster too, so that needs to be taken into consideration.  I was surprised how very mild the flavors were considering the amount of spices, the coconut  cream/milk really mellowed it down. For our family of different  ages it was not a hit but thank you for taking the time to post it

This is a really great meal that lends itself to the ingredients you have on hand too! I only had low fat coconut milk, and peanut butter in place of cashew butter to use--so that's what I did, and it worked out great! I probably added 2-3x more peanut butter (because I have a slight addiction) just for personal taste preference, and since my coconut milk was lower in fat too. I also used chili powder in place of the cayenne. I really enjoyed the ease of making this, the fact that it makes enough for leftovers, it's nutritious, and it's delicious! Will definitely make this again! Thank you so much for the recipe!

I cooked it all exactly according to the recipe.
My son said it was restaurant quality and devoured it. We ate this with rice. Delicious.
