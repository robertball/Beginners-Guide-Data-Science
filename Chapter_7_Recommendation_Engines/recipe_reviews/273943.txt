This is a fantastic recipe. I took more than 5 minutes to prep. But this turned out so good. My second instant pot  meal. Hubby said to add this to his make it again list.

Excellent.  The whole family raved about it.  However, I didn't make it in my Instant Pot.  I cooked my in a dutch oven.  I removed the cooked bacon but didn't remove the chicken as directed.  I just added everything in the pot (except the spinach).  I also added a chopped onion and let it all simmer for 15 minutes.  I cooked the spinach in a separate pan and added it at the end.  It was yummy.

My family LOVED this. Like others I needed to add more chicken, I used 2 lbs of thighs and 8 slices of bacon.  I also used broccoli instead of spinach. Major win with the kids.

Oh my word! This was great. I left out the spinach just because I didn't have any and next time I may throw in some onion. Delicious!

This was a great meal! I added a few extra strips of bacon and used 2 Tbs of the ranch dressing (1 pouch) it gave it a little extra ranch flavor. The family requested that this goes on the make again list. This is as good of a complement that you could wish for.

The recipe is amazing as written! The only thing I have done differently is doubling the chicken stock to make a thinner sauce so I can serve it over rice.

Iâ€™m new to the instant pot and the directions were easy to follow.   I will definitely make this again.

Besides the Instant Pot malfunction, this recipe was delicious! I added extra chicken and extra bacon, and used broccoli instead of spinach. Thanks!

Stuck to the recipe with the sole exception being bone-in thighs. Absolutely delicious! And loved by the whole family.  A must keep!

It was amazing!  I'll be honest, I have used Allrecipes for years, but never written a review.. I made it just as written, and everyone gave it 5 stars.  So good!

This was a good recipe. I had quite a bit of sauce left over and not enough chicken. Next time I'll use 2-2.5lbs of boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Didn't have spinach on hand so served with broccoli. My kids loved it!
