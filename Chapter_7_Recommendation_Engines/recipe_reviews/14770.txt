Replying to a request for suggestions to make this more tasty, try seasoning the chops and browning them until dark brown and then continuing.  One could also try putting the potatoe layer at the bottom so it cooks quicker and seasoning each layer with salt, pepper, garlic, etc.  I would also try frying onions in the browned drippings with salt and a tbsp of water.  And frozen beans would be more fresh tasting than canned ones...  bon apetite!

Oh my gosh!  I have never tasted such tender pork chops.  I didn't even know it was possible for them to get that tender!! First, I browned the meat in butter and seasoning salt, and then I sprayed the dish with nonstick oil. I layered the potatoes with a few pats of butter, chops, green beans, and the soup mixture.  Each layer I spiced with onion powder, garlic powder, and salt and pepper.  My boyfriend loved it, even though he normally hates casseroles!!

We actually cut the recipe in half (except the potatoes) because it is just my husband and I. Reading other reviews about lack of taste I made the following adjustments; Used Campbell's Cream of Chicken with Herbs, onion powder in place of onions (husband dislikes onions) and used FRESH GROUND pepper. I also layered the potatoes on the bottom. Next time I would add a tbsp or two of butter with the potatoes. WE WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN.

I should add a review here, since I gave this recipe 5 stars the first time I made it (I've since made it another 3 or 4 times).  It is very quick and simple to make, which is something I value greatly when I am short on time or ideas; 15 minutes of preparation time, and then I can just pop it in the oven for an hour and go on with whatever else I have to do.  My entire family and I just love these pileups.  Well done!

I was a little leary of tossing all this together, but it was excellent. Good comfort food, and easy. Having a mandoline to slice the potatoes was a real plus

This is fast and my husband rated this at a four.  I rate it at a five because ist is so easy. I did brown and season my pork chops first, but that is the only change and they came out perfect,I used a mandolyn to slice the potatoes and baked for one hour everything was done to perfection.

Terrific and easy! Have made this twice now.  After reading the reviews, I made sure to cut the potatoes thin (scalloped-like), and I also made the chops thin to ensure they would cook.  I added more potatoes, too, to make sure it would stretch for many adults.  The final touch for us was sprinkling Club House's "Parmesan and Herbs" on top when it is served for that extra little something.  Mmmmm!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, quick recipe!  I thought it was good the way it was, however noticed previous reviews complaining about it being bland...a suggestion is to add the French's Onions in place of onions.

This was VERY good!! I didn't have the cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken instead and just added a small can of mushrooms (drained). I also used two cans of greenbeans and about 4 or 5 average size red potatoes (unpeeled).  We really liked this, the pork chops were very tender.  I will make this again!

I thought this was wonderful, and my family loved it.  I had 4 huge chops which pretty much filled the 9 x 12 pan.  I had to use 1 can mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery since that was all I had.  I also browned the chops first before putting them in the baking pan.  I baked mine 1 hr 20 min, testing with a thermometer since they were thick chops.  When I took off the foil I covered the whole thing with french fried onions and slid it back in the oven for 5 more min.  (Just like green bean casserole on top!!)

I thought this came out great!  My chops were a little thin, but that has nothing to do with the recipe.  I would probably recommed using at least 1/2 to 3/4 inch chops and make sure you slice your potatoes thin because that's what everyone seems to have a problem with.  I sliced mine very thin (scalloped sized), and they were wonderful.  The green beans add a zip to the recipe that's wonderful!  I might add some corn next time as well, just to experiment.

I made a few Changes, I cooked the Pork Chopes seasoned with Salt and pepper in a skillet first until brown. Then placed at the bottem of a casserole dish.I poured Cream of Muschroom soup over it that had been diluted with Milk. I then poured Frozen (not canned) green beans on the soup and topped with Crunchy Fried Onions. Covered and Baked for 20 minutes.   My husband scarffed this up and he hates pork chops!

This was outstanding...but I made a couple of minor changes.  I was just cooking for two, so I used two pork chops, 1/2 onion, 4 oz fresh mushrooms, 2 cans beans (didn't have any potatos), and 1 can of 98FF Cream of Mushroom soup with 1/4 cup milk.  It was so good, and the mushroom sauce would make great gravy for bread or mashed potatos.  I will definitely be making this a lot!

I'm not a huge fan of pork chops but my husband is.  We both enjoyed this dish.  I didn't have any trouble with the potatos, but I sliced them very thin.

My family was split about their opinion of this meal.  My husband and son loved it.  I found it to be bland as other reviewers have also said.  I did layer salt & pepper throughtout and chopped about 4 cloves of garlic.  However, I still thought it was bland but edible.  Because my husband & son enjoyed it so much, I will make this again but it won't be a frequent family meal.

My husband loved this!! I overseasoned, listening to other people and it worked out very well. I also pre-boiled the potatoes so they weren't too hard-thanks!

This was fantastic! It was comfort food that tasted like I worked all day on it. I made it twice, once with bone-in chops(added 10-12mins cook time with foil off and sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top), once with boneless chops. I never know when a recipe doesn't specify. I also make sure to do the recipe exactly as written first before making personal changes. It was wonderful. The second time I had to substitute with what I had on hand: 2 15oz cans of sliced potatoes (drained), 1 15 oz can of canned asparagus(drained), and one can of cream of chicken with one can cream of mushroom. I also sprinkled Mrs. Dash(regular) on the chops before I put the vegetables on top. Nice subtle flavor enhancer. 5 stars to a recipe that works exactly as written! Thank you Alberta!

WOW!  I upsized this to 8 pork chops and I used green onion instead of regular onion; water instead of milk; and tomato soup instead of mushroom (I don't like mushroom) and it was amazing!  I cooked for just over an hour, and had cut the potatos very thin, and it was juicy and delicious!  Even the teens liked this one, and it had green beans it!:)

Great dish.  I cooked loin chops separately as I didn't want them to be too dry.  I was in a hurry & cooked it in the microwave for 30 minutes in a 2 qt round cassrole.  Worked like a charm.  Super leftovers, too!  I will cook this one again soon as a side dish.

Quick, easy and awesome!  I did season the chops with onion powder (left out the onion since we don't like them), salt and pepper and also added a can of corn.  We also sprinkled a little shredded cheese on the potatoes once they were on our plates!  I've made a recipe similiar to this using ground beef that was just as good too!  Will make again!

It turned out good in the end, but I made a few changes. I did the potaotes on the bottom, but I used 2 cans of soup with the same amount of milk. I heated them together in the microwave to a low boil and added 1/2 cup of shredded old cheddar and stirred to melt. I also added 1 tbsp of Worsc. and a dash of paprika then poured the whole thing over the bean, chops and potatoes. I baked it for the first 25 minutes at 400 and that kept the timing to an hour. Will make again for sure.

I made this recipe with a few changes (meaning I used what was on hand). I used cream of asparagus soup, sauteed onions,sliced carrots and browned the pork chops.  Layered the potatoes and carrots on the bottom, next the brown pork chops, sauteed onions, poured on the soup (with 1/4 C milk added), green beans, covered and cooked for 1 hour at 350, hubs declared it a keeper.

This recipe was pretty good not the best in the world but sure was different. It took almost 3 hours to make bake though, I am starting to wonder if the reason being is that i covered it with foil, I also added 5 more potatoes and sprinkled garlic powder over the chops to flavor it a bit, and going by what another person who made this before me I put the potatoes on the bottom of the pan. All in all it was pretty good, nice to fix a one pan meal with the meat veggies and starch all in one =) i will make again and try uncovered along with one more onion they were awesome!!

I knew my husband and I would prefer more seasoning to this dish but I liked the idea of cooking the whole meal in one dish so I just added an envelope of Lipton's Dry Onion Soup to the soup and it came out very tasty.  I did cook this about 20 minutes longer.

It's edible, not my husband's favorite. I might not make it again. I do think it's a creative recipe, just not for us.

Really good!  To make the potatoes cook in an hour I sliced them as thin as I could with a big chef's knife, then placed them in two layers on the bottom of the pan with ground pepper, some onion, and two slices of american cheese for each layer.  I also used seasoned salt on both sides of the chops.

It was ok.  I think you should season with each layer you do. Mine was really bland, and I had to cook it about an hour and 15 minutes.  My potatoes were still hard after 30 minutes.  It's a good cold day meal though.

These were good, but I forgot to put the aluminum foil over the pan - VERY important -they took forever to get done and then when I finally DID remember --- the beans, etc. were pretty crusty.  Live and learn.

Please, listen to others who rated this a low score. IT IS VERY BLAND. You have been warned. And if anyone knows of a way to add some flavor to this dish please give some suggestions. Because this recipe is so easy, it will be nice if there is a way. I put so many spices, added vegetables, and it was still bland.

I browned the chops but they still came out dry. I used fresh green beans which I steamed for 5 minutes first. The sauce seemed that it would be tasteless so I added some curry for flavor. I had to cook it for 1.5hrs as the potatoes were not cooked after 1 hour even though I sliced them thin. For me it was way to much sauce, definetly need some rolls to soak it all up! I may not make this recipe again. The only thing that made it tasty was the curry i added.

Followed the recipe although I only used 4 boneless pork chops and I used red potatoes sliced thin. Meat was nice & tender. I also put French's onions on top.  Will absolutely make again!  Made garlic cheese bread on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was just okay. Followed to a T, very fattening. My husband loved it...but he eats anything. I definitely have a more discerning palate! Probably won't make again, I'm sure I can find a better "one-dish-meal."

Made this for dinner last night, was simple and easy to make.  Had to cook an extra 45 minutes and end results was just ok.  I think the recipe needs some more pizzaz, will make again but doctor it up some.

Easy to put together. Used onion powder instead of onions and used one can of Crm of Mushroom and one can of Crm of Celery. Cam out pretty good. Would probably bake for another 10-15 minutes to make sure all potatoes were cooked through.

Very good and easy recipe. I substituted cr. of chicken for the cr. of mushroom. It did take almost 2 hrs. to cook. it may have taken so long because of the thickness of my chops. Overall a great recipe I will make again.

I made this for my boyfriend and myself and we loved it. I used 3 pork cutlets instead, browned them up and then layered the potatoes, onions, green beans and added a small can of mushrooms, then the soup. DELICIOUS!! Served with crusty bread, it was a cold night dinner dream.

I thought this was just ok. I did have trouble with the potatoes not being done, even though I sliced them very thin in the food processor. I ended up keeping the chops warm while zapping the potatoes.  My family did like the flavor though.  Not too much leftover, so that's a good sign!

This was very easy, convenient and pretty good. I have to give it 4 stars because it was so easy to put together and also made a nice one-dish dinner served with biscuits or bread. I thought it was alright, not great. My husband said he thought it was good but didn't rave over it. I may make it again sometime. Thanks.

Don't you just love the name of this recipe?  They were fabulous!!  I scaled the recipe down to make two very thick boneless pork chops.  Because the meal includes potatoes and green beans, there was no need to serve anything else - - a true one dish meal.  You gotta love that!

I made this the other night, the only change was that I halved it for my husband and I.  It turned out pretty good and my husband said he really liked it.  I will make it again.  I wonder if this would work well in the crockpot?

I was not wild about this at all.  I would have done better if I had  grilled the pork chops and made the green bean casserole for a side dish.  I was not impressed and my boyfriend had wished I had made something else for dinner.

I LOVED this recipe.  I altered the recipe a little and used smoked pork chops and 1 can of canned potatoes and it was just to delicious to pass up.

Really nice. Everyone seemed to like it. I added my own little twist of crushed Sweet Petal Onion chips (which I use in place of onion dish soup because that's not gluten free. Also added real mushrooms, and one of cream of mushrooms I substituted for cream of celery. Overall, great flavor, and nice presentation.

I wanted to try this because it seemed simply and omg it is delicious. I put the potatoes on bottom as others suggested and also browned my pork chops a few minutes on each side. I then mixed cream of mushroom and cream of celery plus the milk in with the onion I browned in the chops pan. Added garlic , salt and pepper in between each layer and yum. Sooooo good

Pretty good. I didn't have string beans or cream of mushroom so i substituted snap peas and cream of chicken. Also seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, season salt and chopped garlic. ALSO I sprinkled chopped garlicon the top.

instead of cream of mushroom i used cream of celery soup.  i didn't have green beans so i used some sugar peas i had.  i also browned the pork in some butter first and threw in some kale to cook with it. i added this to the casserole when i put the pork chops over top of the potatoes.  i layered the sides with mushrooms.

I actualy added celery and carrots to this recipe too. I browned the meat, and put the potatos under the chops just to make sure that they would get done. It was amazing! My boyfriend, who greatly dislikes casseroles, LOVED it too. I highly suggest it. Just make it your own like I did, add what you like!!!

I seasoned the pork chops quite a bit and overall the dish was really bland. It has potential, but needs something, maybe some onion soup mix would do the trick. Cooking time was perfect, but I did preboil the potatoes for about 10 minutes.

This was very good.  my hubby LOVED it.  even my 3 year old ate some meat.  i did not have crm of shroom, but I did have crm of chicken w/ shroom.  i made 1/2 recipe.  i added just a tiny bit of onion powder, garlic salt and blk pepper and sprinkled the chops with them before layering. also used frozen green beans as i despise canned veggies.  very good.  will make again but with crm of asparagus soup and frozen or fresh asparagus.  next time, i will slice my chops thinner as it took a little too long to cook.

It was edible. I used med-sized chops, but they still came out dry. Next time I will try this using Cream of Celery. Flavors didn't meld together.

Delicious, but I would recommend precooking the potatoes slightly before baking...mine were really thin and small and were not cooked all the way when the meat was done.

Very tasty.  I had problems with the potatoes getting done.  I only used 1 can of cream mushroom soup with a little milk.  The pork chops were very tender.

This is a wonderful recipe and so quick and easy to prepare.  I did use the canned sliced potatos as someone suggested.  I think I'm going to add a few extra veg's next time to experiment.  ie:  sliced carrots, corn. And I may try this with chicken too and see how that comes out.

This dish had no flavor--it was very bland.  I had to cook an extra 30 minutes because the potatoes weren't cooked.  The only good thing is that the meat was very tender.

This was very quick and easy but it was nothing to rave about and the potatos were still crispy even after baking for an hour.  My husband thought it was okay but would not request it again.
