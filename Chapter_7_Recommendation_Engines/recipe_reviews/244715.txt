This was fabulous! Here are some tips to make the most out of this meal:
1) I used 2 green and 2 yellow squash. I did this for flavor, nutrition and color. In my opinion, using only 2 will not be enough. 
2) I cooked the garlic and onions alone first for 5 min on medium-low to enhance the garlic flavor and the onions would be soft. 
3) I then added the zoodles and cooked for only 2 min. Squash has a high water content and cooking for 5 min.  will make them sweat and get mushy. I really just wanted to blend the flavor together because I knew they would be added back to pan later with the shrimp. 
4) Off to the side, i marinated the shrimp in the garlic, lemon, salt, crushed pepper and a little EVOO in advance while I prepped and cooked everything else (like 15-20 min). I think this makes a world of a difference rather than seasoning straight in the pan. 
Hubby and I licked our plates clean! Also an alternative for those who don't have a spiralizer is to use a julienne peeler. It's more time consuming, yet it's something most of us have handy so you don't have to run to the store and buy another gadget.

Used my spiralizer for the first time on this recipe. Everyone loved it! Added a touch of parmesian on my dish just to try it, tasted great. On another section of the dish I tried a light sprinkle of Old Bay. Brings a whole new meaning to the dish.  Just tryng different things since I'm starting a whole new adventure in cooking.

This recipe appeared in my inbox today and I had almost all of the ingredients.  Stopped off at Bed Bath and Beyond to pick up a spiral veggie cutter.   I reduced the red pepper in half and the black pepper as well, it can always be added to taste later. It still had a little too much heat.  I would suggest using a whole bag of fresh spinach as it wilts to practically nothing.  I also used cooked shrimp and reduced the cooking time accordingly.  I even used a yellow squash I had on hand. It was my first dish made with zucchini noodles and a big hit.  This could be a weekly dish, it was so good.  I am going to try it with cubed chicken breast and like others mentioned, some asparagus.  We are trying to cut some carbs,  having zucchini noodles is an easy way to go.

Made this for dinner tonight. Absolutely delicious. I did omit the red pepper flakes, as no one likes them here. Did add some Old Bay seasoning. Adult child living at home who does not like shrimp--loved it. Brought some to my mother in law next door, she said it deserved a gold medal!  Then got a call from my sister in law, who wanted the recipe (she had a taste of what i gave my MIL). Hubby love it too! will be making a lot with the warm weather coming.  Thank you bgardiner2

So easy and very good. I made ½ with the shrimp and ½ with a piece of salmon (for the boy). The 2 of us ate it all! Had to use my apple corer since I don't have a spiralizer, so the zoodles were not quite perfect. But it was a healthy, easy meal and full of flavor.

Great! My first recipe after getting a veggie spiralizer this week. I spiralized the onion too which made it twirl nicely with the zucchini. Four star as I want to play with this and add something more to kick up to 5-star perfection. Maybe some herbs. Will happily make again.

I love how the noodles have their own flavors added separate from the shrimp.  This turned out SO GREAT!!    Added some chopped asparagus too, so many green things on my plate lol!  Delicious :)

This was so good. My husband is not a pasta fan but he really liked the Zoodles. Score one for me! I took the hint from one of the reviewers and sautéed the shrimp and  spinach part first. When I cooked the zoodles, I left out the water. The zoodles cooked out enough water anyway. When I put the shrimp and spinach back into the pan with the zoodles I drained the juice off but then I tasted it and oh my it was so good I put it in the mixture. Next time I will be sure to have some hot crusty bread to sop up all that goodness. This is a keeper!

This was delicious!  Yummy. I only had one small zucchini and a half lb of shrimp so I changed the servings to 2 and supplemented using super greens pasta. I just chopped the zucchini but next time I want to make the zoodles. It was the perfect amount for my husband and I. I can't wait to make this next time we have company!!

I frequently have zoodles or sauteed spinach but never both together, and it was a good combo. I had it as a one-bowl dinner, using a small zucchini and a half a 6-oz bag of spinach. I sauteed the zoodles for only 2-3 min (from experience, mine get mushy cooking longer); they cooked more when I added the spinach for another few min. The shrimp (mine were thawed/cooked) was a different addition. I went very light on the pepper flakes because I knew the amount stated would have been too much for me. I enjoyed this.

Made this for the second time.  This time I added some roasted tomatoes and threw in some leftover frozen peas I had in the frig.  I used four medium sized zucchini vs just two.  Sauteed the onions and garlic till soft then added the zucchini spirals and tossed only for a few minutes to heat through.  Removed to a bowl.  Then sauteed the garlic and shrimp with the red pepper flakes,  added about 10 oz of baby spinach and when the spinach wilted I added the zucchini.  Tossed and served in big bowls topped with shredded parm cheese.  Soooo yummy!   Its also great for leftovers.

Made this when I used my Zoodle maker for the first time. It was a little spicy for my wife and I will probably use a little less pepper flakes next time but if you like it spicy this recipe is great.

Excellent!  My husband and I both give this dish two thumbs up!  We will definitely be cooking this dish again. 

I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used a bit of cayenne.  I liked another reviewer's idea of using Old Bay and might try that the next time.

This was great! Used pre-zoodled zucchini from the store (2 packages). I didn't change anything except I used a smaller amount of pepper flakes. The cooked zucchini put off quite a bit of liquid and I could have been more diligent to squeeze more of that out before adding back to the shrimp to make it a little less sloppy; but got raving reviews regardless. Will make again!

Simply  yummy.  I reduced this recipe because there is only my husband and I.  So sorry I did.  Next time it will be for the full  recipe, because we were looking for more.  I did not change anything in the  recipe.  Can't wait to make it again and would not hesitate to make it for family and friends.  This one was a winner and a keeper. .  Thanks to whoever submitted this one.

I did not use the red pepper because I am sensitive to spicy food. I was excited to add a little cheese to this because I am a cheese lover.

My husband and I really liked this. I precooked the shrimp in Old Bay seasoning because they were large and I had to peel them after being cooked. I didn't have just spinach, but used instead a 50/50 mix of spinach and spring salad, that you buy in the store. It worked really well and didn't overpower the dish. If you think using salad is unusual,  it isn't. British have a wilted greens salad. Topped this dish with a bit of grated Pecorino/Romano cheese, sans the pepper bits.

This worked perfectly for our low carb diet.  The only change I made was to grate some fresh turmeric  over the shrimp with all the other ingredients used for the shrimp part of the recipe and let that marinate while I prepped the other veggies.  That created a pretty and very tasty sauce that we HAD to drink up like soup broth!  This could easily be adapted to numerous proteins too.  We may well live on it!

LOVE how healthy and delicious this is!!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written with the exception of having bought the zoodles already made in the produce section of Publix!  Yay  Publix!!    It also had about a dozen cherry tomatoes that came with it.  Nice color touch.  I will make this again, and again, and again!

This was the first recipe that I used zoodles in and I picked a good one!  I made it as written, except reduced the butter a little bit when cooking the shrimp.  My whole family loves it.

I made this yesterday for dinner and it was a HUUUGGGE success in my household. I followed the recipe verbatim, especially since I had all the ingredients except for the spinach. Wife and I were thinking of other ways to create this meal utilizing salmon or scallops, or chicken. Excellent recipe and it doesn't take long to prepare!

We really love this and it was really very healthy. we really love this and it was really very healthy.The only changes we made were to use lime, fresh squeezed, instead of the lemon because we didn’t have any lemon and weird company that with a couple tablespoons of my homemade sour mix to get the lemon. We also have some really nice little tomatoes on hand so we added slices of those. We really believe that this added to the dish, creating a nice sauce, that we both ended up drinking like milk from a cereal bowl.

Great dish. Absolutely loved it. We paired it with garlic redskin potatoes and asparagus. Really good meal. They don't mention it, but zucchini gives off a lot of water and you really need to drain it after cooking. Same with the shrimp. Other than that, great recipe and I will definitely make it again.

I added butternut squash and zucchini noodles which added some more healthy flavors. As I served the dish for my husband and myself,  he noticed a jar of cocktail sauce in the refrigerator. He added some of the cocktail sauce to his portion (just a spoonful) and stirred it in. I scoffed at that and then decided to do that to my portion. It was delicious! The cocktail sauce added a spicy touch and went well with the shrimp. I left off the red pepper flakes called for in the recipe and maybe the cocktail sauce was nice touch! Delicious will make again!

Everyone loved this!  This time, I made this dairy-free and omitted the black and red pepper to accommodate food allergies.  It was just as good as the original recipe, which I made last summer.

We plant extra zucchini so we can have enough zoodles to make great recipes like this!!!!!  Thank you for sharing.

I make changes because of a food allergy.  Even though I omitted the garlic and onion because of my allergy, it was an awesome dish. Personal preference  I added tomatoes  and capers. This works well over zoodles or regular pasta. I have made both ways. Very tasty.

This is a really quick, easy, and healthy meal for dinner.  I did a couple changes to the recipe.  I added some ingredients to add some flavor.  I added some mushrooms, tomatoes and capers.  The capers were added so I didnt have to add salt to the recipe.  It turned out really good and is a really healthy dish.  I will definitely make this again.

This is amazing!!!  I think this dinner will be in our weekly rotation.  I substituted ghee for butter because we are doing the Whole30 program.  I also omitted red pepper flakes because we are not fans, and I added Old Bay seasoning to the shrimp as another review suggested.  This recipe was delicious!!

Some of my family members are on the Keto diet. I saw this recipe and had to try it. It was absolutely delicious and easy to make. It was the first time that I tried to make my own zoodles and  they turned out great.The only change that I made was to add extra garlic because they all love garlic. It is definitely a keeper.

This was delicious and I loved skipping the pasta!   I don't like overly spicy so I used half the red pepper and half the black pepper - it had a great flavor with just a hint of a kick.  I added asparagus as some suggested.  This was only 2 servings for us!  Next time I'll use double the zucchini and about 3/4 lb. of shrimp for our 2 servings.

A delicious recipe that lends itself to individualizing for your family preferences.  I used the Old Bay seasoning and Parmesan cheese as suggested.  I also added cherry tomatoes to the shrimp/spinach mixture.  My husband, who does not like veggies as much as I do, said he would definitely enjoy having it again!

Will definitely make this again!!  I think the only thing I did differently is I added the zoodles and spinach last. The zoodles were hot and still had a bit of crunch in it. 
Two thumbs up????

I almost shouldn't review this, because I made a number of changes -- however, this turned out so well, and I think it is a versatile base, so here is my review including what I did differently. I  made my zoodles and placed them in a paper-towel lined bowl in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes to help dry them out. I sauteed a shallot (didn't have any onion on hand) and garlic in oil and butter until just starting to turn golden, then added the zoodles and quickly stirred to coat them. I covered the pan and cooked them for maybe 2 minutes. I then transferred them to a bowl and covered them to keep warm. In the same pan, I added a package of chopped tempeh (in place of shrimp, don't judge - I like it and it's nutritious) and another glug of oil. Cooked and stirred to brown them up. I added finely chopped kale in place of spinach (what I had on hand) and a splash of rose wine to deglaze the bottom on the pan. I added the lemon juice, salt, pepper, some garlic powder (because I did not want to chop additional fresh garlic and there was plenty in the zoodles already), and an unmeasured amount of red pepper flakes (prolly not enough, since I added more at the table). Cooked and stirred until kale looked done. Now, here's the part I recommend. Instead of stirring the perfectly cooked zoodles (meaning perfectly undercooked and NOT limp an soggy) into the HOT kale mixture, I plated the zoodles and topped with the kale. Served with shaved parmesan and red pepper at the table. Wow.

Easy to make, but lacks flavor.  I'm a beginner when it comes to cooking, but it needs more lemon juice and less onion (probably just a quarter not half). I made this with the full amount of zucchini  (2) and half the shrimp (since I'm cooking for one and wanted leftovers). I thought that the amount of zucchini was just perfect, if making the pound of shrimp you might want to double up on the zucchini. Overall, great ingredients, but needs tweaking a but more flavor.

I opted to use more zucchini to make this into a meal rather than just a side.  This was a very light dish, but I think next time I'll add grated parmesan cheese!

Absolutely loved this recipe! It was so fast and easy and full of delicious ingredients. I did add white wine with the butter to cook the shrimp, cajun seasoning to the shrimp, cherry tomatoes at the same time as the spinach and some grated parmesan cheese to the final product. I served over cauliflower rice since I only had a small zucchini in the fridge. My husband said it was a "repeater". It definitely is!

I made this recipe as written, with the exception of using shirataki noodles (miracle pasta) instead the zoodles. It was very good, albeit a little spicy. I'll make it again.

Made this using fresh caught shrimp for the first time & the flavor was AMAZING! I'll never cook with frozen shrimp again.  Also, I used regular noodles & added sliced zucchini instead of making the zoodles.  This is becoming a regular in our house!

I sauteed the onion and garlic before adding the zoodles, otherwise they get  overcooked/too soft.  As I'm not a huge fan of cooked spinach, I've made it with and without. I prefer without.

I love this dish!!  I substituted spaghetti squash for zoodles and broccoli for spinach.  I also added Old Bay seasoning and sprinkled it with Parmesan cheese... amazing!!

I followed Humama's method mostly without changing the squash, used 3 zucchini.  This was really good and hubby, who scoffed at first glance, finished his plate saying "that was unexpectedly delicious!".  Will be repeating this as I am diabetic and low carb is my life these days. But it's not a problem with recipes as good as this one. Very easy and quick as well.

Is there a 10 stars rating? I had to double the recipe because it does make small portions. I added 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms to the zoodles when sautéing. As suggested in one of the reviews, I sprinkled Parmesan/Romano cheese on top. I served steamed asparagus and a salad of cottage cheese and fruit along with the Shrimp Florentine. It was a beautiful plate and tasted so good. This goes on my list to serve company.  Now, I just need to find a way to post the picture I took.

This turned out very very good.  Hubby said it's one of his new favorite shrimp "pasta" dishes that I have made. I followed the ingredients to a T but did change the cooking method slightly.  First off I put all the garlic in at once with the zucchini and onion.  I like to sear my shrimp over high heat and if you add the garlic with the shrimp the garlic is burn and get bitter.  I don't think the serving size is correct as this made 4 very small servings.  I will for sure make this often as it was very good.

Very good! I skipped the butter in the zucchini saute, and used about 1.5 tbsp in the shrimp saute, just to cut back on the fat a little.

Delicious! At first I thought it had way too much red pepper flake.. (and I like spicy).. but it ended up being ok! Good kick. Also, it's even better when it sits in the fridge overnight. Thank you! Will make again!

I made this exactly as directed.  It was a delicious dish.  The only thing I would change next time is to cut back a little on the red pepper flakes.  I like spice but it drowned out the other flavors.

Will make again. Loved it. Only change I made was in cooking the zoodles.  Cut them , salted them to help remove water, then steamed for about 3 min.  Added to finished dish.

My family loves this. My son was n a low carb diet, so I decided to give it a try, and it was delicious!! We had family over from out of town and I made this dish; everyone asked for the recipe. I didn't need to make any changes at all, it is perfectly seasoned as directed in the recipe. Love it!!

Too many zoodles !  The shrimp was lost in all the zoodles.  
And as careful as I was with not overcooking the zucchini, it still turned out pretty watery.

I cooked everything in coconut oil for a little extra island flare. I also set atop rice noodles for the hungry husband--even my toddler demanded more and more til it was gone! Yum! So healthy AND tasty.

Oh yummy!!!  I made it exactly as the recipe is.  I had to hand "noodle" the Zuchs (left the skins on of course) and what was left over I cut into small chunks and added them too.  My hubby wants to eat this once a week - he said this was one of the best meals he ever had!!  This has a lot of heat but does not last long however I would not feed to little kids and maybe, maybe next time I may cut down to 1/2 teaspoon on the red pepper flakes - depends on hubby's tummy today!!  Oh and maybe add just a touch more fresh lemon juice.

This recipe was very good! I doubled it for company we had. I halved the red pepper flakes, since I wasn't sure how spicy they would like. It was warm, but not hot. I also put some white wine in with the spinach as it was reducing. For some reason, I ended up with a lot of extra liquid/sauce that had great flavor with a fair amount of shrimp left over, too. One of our dinner guests suggested I use some rice noodles, add more spinach and maybe throw in some mushrooms to make a soup! I will try that!

I made this recipe for a get together and it was really tastey. I added mushrooms to the mix to make it a little more hearty and it was delicious!

Really easy and very flavorful! Best advice: Don't overcook the delicate ingredients (zucchini, spinach, shrimp, garlic). I sauteed the onions, then added some broccoli before adding the zucchini and garlic in the first part. I doubled the lemon juice.  I also served it topped with a little shaved Parmesan cheese.

Run to the store right this minute for the ingredients to this dish. The only change I would make is to possibly cook the shrimp separately from the spinach as I was afraid the shrimp would be overcooked. Add some fresh Parmesan cheese and some Texas toast and you will be the a hero!

Easy, tasty, healthy.  I followed the recipe exactly; next time I will sauté onions & garlic first then add in zoodles.  They did release quite a bit of water so I poured some out when I transferred the zoodles to a plate.  The amount of red pepper was ok for me but too strong for my kids.

Words cannot describe how delicious this was!  The only changes I made were to slightly increase some of the ingredients because I used 24oz of colossal shrimp so I wanted to make sure it had enough flavor. I thought my husband was gonna faint he loved it so much. Definitely making this again and again!

This is definitely something I will be cooking often. I tweaked it with my own spices and topped it off with parmesan cheese. It was so good. It's a healthy substitute for shrimp fettuccine.

Will be making this again, all enjoyed it. Simple to make and just the taste of simple ingredients, very good. Only change was that I ran the onion through the spiralizer and gave that a rough chop with a knife; and I finished the dish with Parmesan.

Will definitely make this dish again.  Loved the julienned zucchini which made for a healthier dish.   
Will try it with chicken next time and also use it as a side dish without any meat.  Excellent flavor and I did increase the red pepper flakes to give it a bit more spice!

Pretty much stuck to the original recipe and I thought it was quite tasty......so did my dinner guest. We polished it off with a nice crisp green salad. I would surely try it again and switch out the protein however shrimp is my fav. I recommend you give it a try. Easy  and healthy, too.

I have made this dish twice in the last week.  The first time I did not have any spinach so I made it without.  It was delicious!  I made it again last night with the spinach and it was even more delicious!  Ver y simple, one pan meal that is healthy and tasty. Will be making this again and again!

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The only thing I did that was different than the recipe was I only added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I figured I could always add more if need be; but it wasn't necessary and still had a little kick.  The sauce was so buttery and flavorful.  Oh and don't let me forget to mention that from the time I took my spiralizer from the box (just bought it) and finished eating only about an hour had passed, that's how easy this is to make.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Delicious, very flavorfull and easy to make.  I made the zoodles with a potato peeler.  I also took the tails off the shrimp so it is easier to eat.  Served with crusty Italian bread and white vino.  Yum~

Three of five eating this meal are really watching the calories and fat. This was a HUGE hit with everyone.  Delicious and no guilt.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 lb shrimp and 1 lb bay scallops.  Coated them both in Old Bay seasoning before tossing them into the pan to cook.  No other changes needed.  Will definitely make many more times.

It was a decent change, but the spinach and other stuff overpowered the flavor of the shrinp.  When/if I make it again, I'll use less veggies and more shrimp.  While using angel hair pasta would up the carbs and calories, it would also lower the "clash" over the delicate flavor of the shrimp.

Loved this dish and will make again.  I used 12 oz package of spinach. Next time, I will increase the zucchini to 3. I also cooked this in my Wok, so there was no stove to clean.

Really love this.  My changes:  I cook my shrimp separately in peanut oil,  on high heat for as little time as possible, and stir them in.  I also use a whole chile, seeded, and split.  Remove it before serving.  Easy recipe with a great results!!!

Very good and full of flavor.   The leftovers were still the next day.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made this for my husband and 94 year old mother. My mother never takes a second helping, but she did this time. I don't have a spiralizer, so I just cut the zucchini into strips. I left out the red pepper flakes as my mom and I have acid reflux. But it still tasted great. I plan to make this dish again.

I thought this had excellent flavor and how nice to find a recipe for just one person!  I live alone and will be making this again.  I loved the zoodles and found them really easy to cut with my French fry cutter.  My daughter loves zucchini so I'm anxious to try this out on her.  Update on the previous wording.  I made half a recipe and it was doable for one person with just a little left over.

This is an excellent, healthy recipe. It really doesn't take long to make the zucchini noodles with a spiralizer. My husband loves the spiciness. I use 3 large zucchinis so my husband gets enough of this delicious dish!

We liked it, but found it too spicy and too salty.  Will make it again, but leave out the red pepper, cut the regular pepper and salt in half.  Also we all sprinkled parmesan on our servings and really liked that.

After reading others' reviews, I added a sprinkling of Old Bay seasoning while sautéing the shrimp, and then a little parmesan when serving it.  I also spiralized the onion, after reading that someone else did.  We really liked it.

I made this recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing!!!  My husband and I really loved it.  As someone always on a diet, it's rare to find something so delicious and so healthy!  I have been using All recipes for years and have really enjoyed many recipes.  This is the first time I felt like I wanted to review something!!

I don't even like veggies! Delicious. I had been told zucchini could replace pasta but never believed it. This flavorful dish was amazing. Will be making it again  and again.

Made this tonight and it was really good.  4 stars  is because I felt 1 tsp of Red Pepper Flakes was excessive, overwhelming the flavors of the other ingredients.  Would advise adding flakes to taste...perhaps 1/2 tsp next time I make it, and I will make it again.   Thanks for the recipe.

It was great. Used about half the garlic and red pepper flakes and still pretty spicy.....but good. Also added some grape tomatoes  at the end. Next time some Parmesan will be added also.

Excellent.  I used 3 zucchini due to size of zucchini.  We added tortilla chips for some crunch.  Will make again.

Very Good recipe!  I made it just the way the recipe said, and it was delicious.  The only thing I'm going to do next time is cut the Zoodles ahead of time and let them drain with a little salt added for a while.  Even though I stained these several times during the process, it came out quite soggy.  Great recipe though!

This was delicious!  Knowing my family, I doubled the shrimp.  Next time I make it, I'll double the spinach as well since it's typically sold in 12 oz. bags and it was a great addition.

Easy to make, healthy and delicious!  I left out the onion (allergies)  and added Parmesan as suggested.  Served with a slice of pan fried polenta.  Yum!!  Will make again for sure!

Added a little Parmesan cheese before serving and cut back on the garlic and onions by half. Still FABULOUS! One of my favs so far
