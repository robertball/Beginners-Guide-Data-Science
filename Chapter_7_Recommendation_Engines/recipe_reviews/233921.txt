I was looking for a quick sauce to go with pork chops and this was perfect. I made a few changes because of what I had at home. I used real brown sugar. I didn't have jalape√±o but did have a can of diced green chiles so used those instead. I also didn't have onion. My family loved it. A little sweet and a little spicy. My daughter put some on a Graham cracker for dessert and that was tasty too. Enjoy!
