Absoultely Fabulous!!!  Didn't change a thing except cheated & used my Foreman grill ;)  Thanks Blake for an EASY but Delicious recipe!! Too many recipes call for an absurd amount of ingredients that overkill the food itself-this is simplicity at its finest!

There is a reason this recipe is called Blakes "Best" Steak - it is wonderful! I prepared the steaks exactly as listed in the recipe - they were delicious! My son sometimes melts butter on steaks (ala Ruth Chris) - there was no butter needed on these steaks - and they were just as good (or even better) than what you get in a restaurant!

My husband and I LOVED it!!!  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh. The only problems was my kids wanted the "dirt" off the steak, haha.  Cant please everyone!

I made this recipe for my in-laws (7 people) and they LOVED it! I am a vegetarian so I didn't try it but the aroma left around the house was great. I love using rosemary so this dish was perfect. It was a definite success.

I was looking for a non-marinating recipe to use on a really good cut of beef. I thought this sounded perfect, but it really didn't add much to the steak than if I had grilled it as is. I didn't get much rosemary flavour, even though I used 2 fresh springs on each steak. It's probably my grilling technique...

Great flavor especially after adding a pat of butter to each piece of steak. My rosemary sprigs caught on fire which in turn made the steak a little well done, so next time I'll keep a closer eye on things! Made a great meal along with some fresh made french bread. Check out the Fabulous French bread recipe! Thanks again~

I didn't think the steak would get much flavor by the way the recipe sounded, and true to form--I was right. Placing the rosemary sprigs on top of the steak might be ok for aesthetics---but for flavor? No. Nothing was accomplished here but wasting a sprig of rosemary and a light, almost imperceptible garlic flavor. Wow. Some of these so-called "recipes" slay me. This isn't even a "recipe." It's a steak rubbed with some garlic and placed on the grill. Please, people. Try a bit harder next time!

So glad to see steak treated simply.  The rosemary is a lovely idea and I have had lots of fresh this year.   We do like to taste our meat rather than overpower it.  Thanks for submitting

This was very good.  I let them sit in the fridge for about an hour (with rosemary on top) after seasoning them.  I also added the zest of a lemon to the ingredients.

We did NY strips with this recipe and while they were very good, there wasn't much rosemary flavor.  Like a couple others we melted butter on top. Goes great with a baked potato.

YUM! It was our first time grilling and I think we left them on too long but the flavor was great. The rosemary was a perfect touch - not too overpowering but definitely there. Good combination of flavors and so easy to put together.

This recipe was quick and easy but still gave a lot of flavor to the steak.  I will definitely be using this again.

Great recipe!  I used larger ribeye steaks with bone-in.  Followed recipe exactly except that I used a little bit of crushed rosemary as well as fresh rosemary.  I grilled it for 30 seconds on one side with all burners on, flipped them and grilled 4 min. indirect heat, flipped again and grilled 2 1/2 min. with indirect heat.  They were medium rare and delicious!

My husband and I LOVED this!  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried along with a sprinkle of herbes de provence.  Also added a few drops of sesame oil along with regular canola oil to rub on the steak. And a sprinkle of garlic salt along with the salt and pepper.
My husband commented that it tasted like a $35 steak from a restaurant.

I think it's important to get a quality piece of steak and not to overcook or it'll get tough.  This was delicious!

NOT a good recipe relative to logical home cooking... I don't get it... Steak TOO small. Cooking time TOO long. Flavor TOO lacking. For the same time you could add much more flavor with the same ingredients to at least a 10oz. Steak.

fantastic! seasoned with a bit of salt as well and modified the rosemary. Chopped the rosemary, & pressed half of it into the steak and sprinkled the other half over the top of the steak while cooking. Turned out beautifully!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get some Blake

The steak I had was really four stars, but I didn't have any fresh rosemary, so I will assume that it would be better as written.

Excellent recipe.  I followed it as written the first time.  The second time, I put some rosemary and chopped garlic in olive oil for a few hours before I used it to brush the steak.  superb!

Just OK.  I wanted a simple steak recipe that would let the steak flavor come through, but even after using more garlic than called for and more rosemary, it still didn't have much flavor.  I followed the prep. directions exactly, and my neighbor who's a chef said he cooks steaks like this too.  He suggested I throw a sprig of rosemary on the back of the grill so it will 'smoke' the meat.  Like another reviewer said it almost tasted like you grilled the steak plain.  I might try this again with something other than rib eye.

This recipe wasn't my favorite, though I did make it in the oven rather than on a grill, and I used dried rosemary. I might try it again with fresh rosemary.

Seriously, this was excellent.  Followed the recipe to the letter, cooked them to just under medium rare, let them sit under tented foil for a few...sooo good.  The simplest ingredients so often produce stellar food!!

Very tasty! You can't beat steak with garlic, and I love the fact that this can be made at the last minute without marinating.

Extremely novice-friendly recipe and the taste is excellent. I'd recommend it with chived mashed potatoes and grilled  asparagus.

This was a good.  A very simple & quick solution when you are in a crunch.  If you like rosemary, you'll like this.

I made this for one of my guests, but adjusted it due to time constraints. I only rubbed it down with olive oil then put on some garlic powder and put a rosemary twig in a part of the steak I sliced open. She said it was great and nothing needed to be changed. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I hadn't tasted it too.

This was very good.  I sautéed onions and mushrooms and just put a pile on top of each steak.  It made a great presentation.

The whole point of letting the meat sit for 15 minutes is to bring the meat to room temp before grilling. Returning to the fridge is exactly what you should NOT do. PS- if your steak is too small don't blame the recipe! LOL!!

I made this once before for my husband and me on our anniversary.  We don't eat steak very often, but hubby was craving one, so I went to store and hand selected the best cuts with good marbeling (this is the key to a juicy steak).  Once again, it was a hit!  So delicious!  Perfectly seared on the outside and juicy on the inside!  I didn't have fresh rosemary but I used dried and it was still just as good.  I also add a lot more garlic and Montreal steak seasoning.  Simple food = simply delicious.

Oh boy Blake you have a winner here!  
I made mine on my Foreman grill since nobody was here to light the outdoor one.
Used T-bone steak because that's all I had... husband loved it, then when son took his first bite, he said, "mmmmmmmmm" with a huge smile on his face... just perfect.

Great steak! I have NEVER had success trying to cook a steak other than grilling outdoors. This was the exception! I used a cast iron grill on top of the stove burners and the steak turned out absolutely perfect. I did not have fresh rosemary, but like others, I used a very small amount of dried. The only other change I made was after grilling the steak (bone-in ribeye) 4 minutes on each side, I transferred it to a skillet and basted it with melted butter for about a minute on each side. Perfection! Steak was tender and the seasoning was just right without being overpowering. This is the way I will cook steaks during bad weather from now on. Try it---you'll like it!

I'm not the best at cooking steaks and needed a recipe that used what was in the kitchen.  Came across this one, very minimal ingredients so I was a little skeptical but I do know sometimes simple is good.  I read A LOT of the reviews, only saw one negative one so let's go for it.  I followed it to a T and it turned out great.  ( of course this is someone who never thought to brush steaks with olive oil before, always wondered why they would stick to the pan!) probably wouldn't cook quite as long next time but that's a personal preference and I think my stove was pretty hot. I liked this recipe because I learned something new and it came out great.  All in all, simple ingredients made a delicious and very tasty steak. I highly recommend.

BORING & UNINSPIRED. 

In addtion to following the recipe exactly, I added rosemary and garlic  to the oil and let it sit 6 hours. I also put a large cutting of rosemary onto the grill to assist in giving the steak a smoked rosemary flavor. 

All your left with is a great cut of streak, grilled to perfection with a very LIGHT seasoning and nothing special at all. Very middle of the road IMO.

This simple recipe really will give you the best steak! My husband was pleasantly surprised at how tasty his steak was without much seasoning. I followed this recipe using fresh pressed garlic, fresh ground pepper and of course the fresh rosemary! Don’t skimp on the fresh!

Fantastic! Definitely prefer lightly seasoned so the steak can actually be tasted. Actually cooked the steaks in a sauté pan, used butter instead of olive oil, and dried garlic and rosemary instead of fresh. I would have preferred fresh garlic and rosemary, but those weren't on hand. It was still amazing!

I thought this was a great way to cook a steak, but I really didn't get as much of the rosemary flavor as I would have liked.  The butter and garlic were delicious of course, it's the best pairing for a steak :)  YUM!

Simple recipe, yet very exquisite flavor. The only thing I did different is added a pat of butter to the steaks once I took them off the grill. Also, the cook time was a little long for the size steaks I had, but I knew that when I started so i was able to adjust. The only way to know how long to cook your steaks for the doneness you like, based on thickness and temperature, is experience! Happy grilling!

This really didn't have the flavor we were hoping for.  Not the best steak recipe for this family.

This was mentioned on the Buzz by Godzilla that it was a hit so I thought I’d give it a whirl.  It was a hit in our house too.  I used my cast iron skillet instead of the grill with fabulous results.  Thanks for sharing.

I have now found the perfect way to prepare steaks!  I have tried many methods, marinades, but this is the one!  And also, I had to use a little dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh.  And I let my steaks rest probably 25 - 30 minutes.  It created a very tasty crust on the steak once done. Those were my only changes.  I just can't tell you enough how good these were!  Hubs raved about them!  Wow! Thanks Blake for my new way of preparing steak :)

Simple and sublime, perfect, husband cooks meat in foil on the grill, worked out great.
