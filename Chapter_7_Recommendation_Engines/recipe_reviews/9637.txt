These bars are rather nondescript. They did not have enough chocolate or applesauce to take on either flavor. They also were rather cakey. I prefer chewier bars.

Very moist, not chewy, didn't have a defining flavor. Meaning, you could taste something but it wasn't either applesauce or chocolate. As weird as this might sound, needs to be sweeter or it was missing something. Mine were falling apart around the walnuts. Not crumbly just not holding shape very well when pulling out of the pan in bar form. Not sure if I'd make again however, at most for me, they were just okay.

We had enjoyed the applesauce walnut bars. We would suggest to add more walnuts.

I was trying for a lower sugar brownie and this worked with 3 oz of chocolate, 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2c regular flour with 1/2t baking powder. I baked in a 9x9 pan for 25-30 minutes. They were so good hot out of the oven. Could add chocolate chips for more chocolate punch.
