Loved the result, but I altered the recipe. I used 3 large bananas, 1/4 c oil and 1 cup applesauce (unsweetened) in place of the margarine.  I used 4 rounded T of instant cofee disolved in just a litte more that 1 T water, only 1 cup of sugar, and 1/4 cup egg beaters in place of the egg. I made the large muffins and baked them for about 35 minutes, then left them in the oven to cool with the door open.  They turned out very moist, and the flavor was wonderful...and low-fat!

I was looking for a recipe to make banana muffins with the over ripe bananas I had. I found the best recipe ever!!!! I read all the reviews for this recipe and did make a few changes that were suggested. I used 1/4c marg and 3/4c applesauce instead of the full cup of Marg., I used half white and half brown sugar but only used 1 cup total, 3 tbsp coffee in 2 tbsp water,1 1/2 c whole wheat & 3/4 c white flours and I added 2 tsp ground flax seed. They turned out very yummy!! Will definitely make again.

These are really good.  I followed the advice of others and added extra coffee - a good choice.  Instead of adding the full 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter, I added 3/4 of a cup and used the rest of the cup to sprinkle on top along with chopped walnuts.  This made for quite a presentation.  Next time I might use less chocolate chips in the batter as the muffins were a bit sweet.  Overall a great muffin recipe.  Thanks Shelley.

I used high quality ingredients in this recipe and it still didn't measure up to some of the other reviews. My Husband tried one and said it tasted like hay!  My Mom and Grandma both said they wouldn't make them again.  As someone who loves to bake and loves banana chocolate combo, I had high hopes for this one, no such luck.

Delicious!!!  I'm not even a big coffee fan but, the coffee flavor really enhances the taste of the chocolate chips.  Definitely increase to 3 tbsp's of coffee dissolbed in 3tbsp's of water for best flavor.

Wonderful muffin recipe!!  It is very unique and rich with the combination of chocolate, coffee and bananas.  I always have bananas on hand in the freezer for baking and these are great to whip up on cool Autumn mornings!  As other reviewers have done, I increased the coffee for a little added punch.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I took these to a Church meeting and the comments were all favourable.  The muffins are moist and the coffee gives them that little extra "oomph" that makes them memorable.  My thanks to Shelly and Allrecipes.  Gwen - Calgary, Alberta, Canada

The muffins turned out a bit too soft and was very difficult to remove from the muffin tins without it falling apart.  Maybe I had to wait a little longer for it to cool, but stil.  A bit too sugary - I would add less sugar next time and perhaps add a half less banana.  Also, could hardly taste the mocha.  Overall, it was very good.

These are the best muffins I've ever made!!  So moist...everyone LOVED these muffins.  Easy recipe.  Instead of using instant coffee, I just put in 3 TB of regular coffee I had already brewed.  It turned out perfect!  Will be making this again and again...

A friend made these and gave me a taste. I did not like them--a little dry and the flavor combo did "work" for me.

Made these for my husband, he gives them five out of five stars.  To cut down on fat & calories I made a few changes to the recipe:  I used 1/4 cup of margarine and 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I used 3/4 cup sugar and used splenda to substitute for 1/2 cup of sugar.  In place of the water I used some unsweetened soy milk I had leftover to use up.  This batch almost made 2 pans of mini muffins.  I have a convection oven and baked them @ 350 for 15 min. 

Update Sept-2014:  I make this recipe all the time and I find it's very versatile.  I usually substitute with 1 cup of applesauce and 2 tablespoons of margarine or oil.  Also, I find you can easily sneak in 1/2 cup of cooked pureed carrots/peas - if you do that, just add a little bit more flour.  Also, this recipe works nicely using white whole wheat flour in place of regular flour.

I made these a little "lighter" for my family. I used whole wheat white flour, used butter instead of margerine (I don't keep margerine on hand often)and added an extra half-cup of mashed banana in place of some of the butter and I cut the sugar down to a scant 1/3 cup. These turned out very well, quite moist actually though they aren't one of our favorites. It's not because of the adjustments made--it's just the combination of the banana, chocolate and coffee. My kids and I just didn't care for it. My husband enjoyed these though, eating four in one sitting.

This is a really yummy way to use up those ripe bananas instead of your usual banana bread, ESPECIALLY for us coffee lovers! I used 3.5 tablespoons of the instant coffee granules,  added chopped pecans, and made with half white sugar and half dark brown sugar. This is like a STarbucks mocha in muffin form! So good with coffee. Everyone wanted the recipe!! I also used once in mini loaf pans. It made 5 little loaves. Just increase your bake time about 15 min or so.

I had my initial doubts, but this looked interesting. I made six HUGE muffins instead of the 15 or so the recipe called for (increase the time to 65 minutes and cover with foil for the last half to avoid burning tops). Flavor is excellent; they seem like fancy bakery/artisan muffins and would make an impressive brunch offering, hostess or Christmas gift. I did not have coffee granules, so I threw in about 1/3 cup of strong strong coffee and it seemed totally fine to me...gave it that certain something you can't put your finger on but you really like.

I am SO pleased with this recipe.
The only changes I made were:
I used 4 bananas because that is what I had and I used 1T. instant vanilla coffee because, once again, that is what I had. I also used mini semi sweet chips with good results.
The clincher for me was the fact that my 10 year old can't get enough of these and with coffee in them I was worried about that.
You must try these!

Yummy!  I took several reviews into account and customized....First I only used 2 egg whites, split the sugar 1/2 powered sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, and I used 3 tablespoons of liquid coffee, with 1 tablespoon of water finally I like a little more vanilla flavor so I added 1/2 teaspoon.  Browned on the outside, soft and moist on the inside.

Good change up of Banana Muffins by adding the chocolate!  I ended up using 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce just to help out a little on the saturated fat!  They still turned out extremely moist and full of flavor.  I also added some walnuts - which is just our preference!  Good receipe.

I was initially skeptical of this recipe - I mean mix muffins in a food processor for 2 minutes and still get a tender muffin???  These are both tender and fluffy.

FANTASTIC! I made these exactly as written with the exception of only using 1 cup of sugar (that's all I had), using mini chocolate chips instead of regular and topping them with extra mini chips before baking. I got 23 beautifully baked muffins out of this recipe. These are so good that my little guy already ate 2...and so did I, lol. I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

YUM!  we inhaled these!   We did tweak it a bit:  a) Upped it to 6 tsp of coffee in 6 tsp of water. I was a bit worried it'd ruin the texture but it was fine. And you could actually taste the coffee.  b) Added in almost an entire packet of chocolate chips-they melted just so for a perfect yummy-ness.   And just as a warning they do come out very brown (i mean c'mon, it's 6 tsp of coffee here!) They're not ugly but they don't look like the picture. More like chocolate cupcakes.
I usually give 4 stars if I make a drastic change but these are so amazing I can't bring myself to it. I practically will my bananas to get yucky so I can make these; they've become my go-to muffins, I make them ALL the time.

This recipe is a nice change from the same old banana muffin recipes. I did make some slight changes: substituted 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup butter for the 1 cup margarine; reduced 1 1/4 cups white sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup brown sugar; and used instant espresso coffee. I baked these in 2 mini muffin pans and baked for about 15 minutes. They came out moist and delicious. These are my new favorite mini muffins. Thanks for the recipe. I will make this again for sure.

Very tasty! I used slightly less chocholate chips and bitter chocholate instead of semisweet. Next time I try with white chocholate! I also substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar and used more coffee as some reviewers suggested. I sprinkled chopped walnuts and chocholate on the top of the muffins - makes really nice presentation!

I found this recipe quite tasty, but it didn't earn rave reviews from four others who tasted it.  Although I doubled the amount of coffee, I found that the coffee flavor diminished over time while the banana flavor increased.  The muffins were best straight from the oven.

This muffins are very good. My book group loves to eat the with tea or coffee. Also I often make a delightful chocolate spread to top the with. They are great for the coffee drinker but they are not terribly kid friendly.

I rate only 4 star because its too sweet for me even i only use 3/4 cup of white sugar. Maybe its the banana already tastes sweet. I use 3/4 cup of canola oil instead of butter. I found it turns out great even without baking powder cos i didn't hav it. I use 2tbsp of espresso powder dissolved with 2tbsp water. Overall it taste good. Definitely will bake this again by reducing the sugar and use less choc chips. Thanks anyway

Kids loved these. Disappeared fast (muffins, not kids). I substituted applesauce for 1/2 the butter,  added 1/4 cup flax meal and used just 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, to make them a bit healthier. Also, I used a heaping tablespoon of espresso powder dissolved in small amount of water. The coffee flavor made them special and unique. Thanks so much for a great breakfast treat.

Not much "mocha" flavor.  I doubled the amount of instant coffee - used 2 Tbsp of instant coffee and equal amount of water.  The muffin itself was delicious.  VERY moist.  I would definately make these again.

I made this with some of the changes-white/wheat flour, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce 1/2 cup butter. I must say, I was skeptical, as I totally love banana bread. I made 12 muffins and one mini loaf. Very moist, good flavor and low points for weight watchers(5).

These were pretty good. Didn't quite get the coffee flavor I was expecting and I even increased the amount to 2 Tbsp in 2 Tbsp water. I used 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup applesauce to cut down on the fat and subbed about half whole wheat flour for white. Also used half brown sugar and half white

These are absolutely delicious!  My husband is a chocolate fanatic.  I decided to make several things with chocolate in them for his birthday.  We started the morning with these.  I don't keep instant coffee on hand so I just used a couple of Tbsp. of our strong brewed morning coffee.

Excellent recipe! Thank you for sharing! just because I love the taste of mocha I am adding more coffee and used butter or coconut oil( just because we don't buy margarine) but nothing needs to be changed! All my family loves this recipe!

I made these today with 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of 2 1/4 white flour. I doubled the coffee but next time will triple it, as well as cut down on the sugar. They were really good and moist and we'll definately make them again with more coffee and less sugar :-)

i made this recipe exactly as written with one exception: i used 3T of instant coffee in 3T of water, like another reviewer suggested. frankly, i think that's the right amount of coffee to use for the best flavour; any less wouldn't have given it such a nice flavour. and i have to say, these are quite possibly the best muffins i have ever made! my daughter loves them, too, though they're a little too coffee-ish for my boys... which really just means all the more for me! this will now be one of my two "go-to" muffin recipes. thanks so much!!!

Made this as directed by OP, except used 1 1/2 T coffee.  I cooked each batch 24 minutes, turning the pan after 12 minutes.  Oh, man, are these good.  Slightly crusty on the outside, moist on the inside.  My 9 year old son loved them.

I love these muffins!  But my kids didn't, so these are a great thing to take to the office, or some other 'grown up' function.  Also, do not use margarine... BLECK!! Butter or even oil is better.  I used margarine once when at my mom's house, because she didn't have anything else around, and it was awful!  I mean, it was edible, but a lot of things are edible that you don't want to write home about.

Great flavor, albeit just a tad on the dry side.  Still, worth making again as the kids LOVED them & with modifications they're a healthy snack.  I followed suggestions of using 1/4 c butter + 3/4 c applesauce, & cut sugar to 3/4 c using half white & brown.  I used all whole wheat flour & dark choc chips.  I'd  check them at 20 min.

Yummmmmmy. Prepared just as the recipe said.  Perfecto!  Took longer than 10 minutes for me to do, but I'm not an expert.  Also only took about 15-20 minutes to bake and made about 18 muffins.  Sprayed the pans with pam rather than using the cups since I didnt have any.  Still an excellent recipe, sent copies to all my friends.  All I can say is Yum Yum.

I did make some changes per other reviewer's recommendations including use of oil & applesauce vs. margarine, subbed part of the flour for whole wheat pastry flour and I upped the instant coffee & water. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips. I melted about 1/4 of them with the coffee & water mixture and used the remaining chips in the batter as the recipe states. My whole family loved these, even the kids! I do like the way you can make your personal preferences to the recipe to make it your own. Thank you, I will use this recipe again.

VERY yummy right out of the oven! IF any survive until tomorrow, I'll have to update how they are a day old.  I did have to pour the batter into a bowl before adding the flour, salt, soda, and powder because my food processor was too small, but the consistency of the muffins was still absolutely lovely!  I made two changes for family preference - I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of 1 cup of all purpose white flour and I added chopped pecans.  I LOVED using the food processor to mix the first 7 ingredients because I could use cold butter and it still made excellent batter.  I think this is my favorite muffin recipe because it is so easy!  Well done, Shelley!

These are yummy!  I did not have instant coffee, so i just made a very strong tablespoon of french press coffee.  I did not taste the coffee flavor at all, but they made delicious chocolate chip banana muffins.  I also only used 2 bananas, and the banana flavor is plenty strong.  Because I live at a very high altitude (12,000 ft), I added 1/4 cup flour and an extra egg for a fluffier consistency.

WOW!  I honestly was not expecting to like these since I don't like coffee, but these are one of my new favorite muffins.  I replaced 1/2 cup butter with banana yogurt.  I also put 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips in the batter and then melted some chocolate chips with brewed coffee to drizzle over the top.  My daughter who doesn't like banana had 2 of these!  Great muffins!

Great recipe - have made many times and people always love them.  I love chocolate but amazingly I agree with the other reviewers that the chocolate can be overwhelming; milk chocolate chips or 3/4 c mini-semisweet chips have been ideal. Super easy because it's all made in food processor.

Very good. I only used 1/2 cup butter and maybe a Tbsp of canola oil. One cup of fat seems like a lot. I used one Starbucks via without dissolving it and added about a half cup of unsweetened coconut. I made 12 reg muffins and 30 mini muffins. I also just mixed wet first, whisked dry together separately, then combined and added chips and coconut last. I highly recommend this recipe, with less butter.

Oh, my goodness, these are THE BOMB.  Followed one suggestion and used 3/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar, used semi-sweet mini-chips and two large bananas because that's all I had on hand, and they still turned out fantastic - and very much DH approved.  He asked me to make them again soon so that he can take them to work for his co-workers, and I don't remember him ever asking me that.  Thanks for sharing!

Good muffins. Pretty sweet. Like other reviewers, I added less sugar-about a cup, upped the coffee a bit, and made them with half butter, half oil. I wanted the flavor from the butter and the moisture from the oil (they were not dry at all this way). The butter kind of makes them taste like chocolate chip cookies in a muffin. They rose beautifully and are very attractive. I was out of brown sugar so I used all white, but I think brown in combo with the butter and mini chips would make them even more like chocolate chip cookies. The only thing I'm not sure about is the combination of the three flavors. I love coffee and chocolate, and I love banana and chocolate. I'm just not sure that the three together are not a little too distracting for my taste. I wonder if subbing cocoa for the coffee would solve this problem for me.

Great flavor with subtle mocha flavor!  This is  a nice recipe instead of using my overripe bananas for banana bread all the time.  I did follow suggestions of decreasing margarine to 1/4c, used 1/2c each of white sugar and brown sugar instead of all white, added 3/4c applesauce, 4T finely ground coffee, used 3/4c all purpose flour and 1 1/4c whole wheat flour instead of all white flour, plus I added 2T flax seed.  Yum!!

This is the best banana recipe I ever had.  It's a keeper.  I make it without the coffee. I put them in large cupcake wrappers. My kids and husband LOVE these muffins. They're moist and delicious.

I loved these muffins!  I did make some changes.  Nothing wrong with the original, I just like certain things (smile).  I put i cup of packed brown sugar and 2/3 cup of splenda.  Used egg beaters in place of egg.  I also used 3 tbsp of instant coffee & instead of mixing with water, I mixed it with 3 tbsp of coffee.  I also added 1 more banana.  Very moist!  Mmmmm, LOVE THEM!  Thanks for posting :)

I read the reviews and used unsweetened apple sauce and little bit of oil, used half whole wheat and half white flour, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, used 3 Tb of coffee in 2 Tb. of water, and put them in the muffin liners. I made these for my husband's work and our landscapers and everyone raves about them. These are moist, full of flavor, and we think these are the best banana muffins ever!

I would agree that you need more instant coffee to bring out the espresso flavour. When the muffins came out of the oven, I made a small slit on top and slid in a round chocolate medallion half way in.

This recipe turned out delicious muffins that my most picky of eaters devoured.  The only change I made to the recipe was that I substituted 1 1/2 cups of the flour with Whole wheat flour. Did not seem to affect the outcome of the recipe on bit.

Very moist and yummy muffin.  I used 3/4 cup Splenda - 1/2 cup brown sugar to lower the sugar content for a friend.  Still delicious.  A bit too sweet for me either way.....so I might cut the sugar down next time and see what happens.  The coffee adds a subtle change to your typical banana muffin - with added mini chips - it's just a scrumpcious snack/dessert muffin!

I just took the first batch out of the oven, and they are fantastic!  I don't know if you need the coffee...but a little coffee heightens the flavour of chocolate.  I followed the recipe exactly, but only cooked it for 20 minutes.  I oiled and floured the pan instead of muffin cups, and they are fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband said these are to die for - possibly the best muffins he has had. I followed the advice of some others and increased the instant coffee to 2 tbsp. and 2 tbsp. water. Also used 1/2 c. margarine and 1/2 c. applesauce rather than 1 c. margarine. Used approx. 3/4 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar.

Yummy! These are really good. I used 3 really big bananas. I used mini chocolate chips, and instead of water I used coffee to dissolve the instant coffee in. Mine only took 16 minutes to cook through so keep an eye on them. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe turned out great.  I read a couple of reviews and made minor adjustments.  I used 1/2 cup of margarine and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the 1 cup margarine.  I also dissolved 3 T of instant coffee in 3 T of water.  Dusted the chips with 1 T flour, too and they distributed nicely throughout the muffins.  Muffins were moist and tasty!

These are AMAZING!!! This will definitely be one of my go-to recipes when I need to use up ripe bananas! Changes I made: Replaced margarine with applesauce, used 1/4 egg beaters in place of the egg, 1.5 cups whole wheat flour & 3/4 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup light brown sugar, increased coffee to 3 tbsp dissolved in just over 2 tbsp water, and 1/2 chocolate chips &1/2 cinnamon chips. Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe!

Excellent muffins; not at all dry. I followed as instructed; with one exception only; I used 2 tbsp of coffee in 2 tbsp of water. I used butter not margarine. These are delicious.

My daughter and friend made these muffins following the recipe exact-except for 1 TB extra coffee granules and butter replaced margarine.  I couldn't imagine them with any less coffee. Thanks for prior reviews.  The taste was nice, not overly sweet-just like a "muffin" should be. Super sweet is for cupcakes!  These muffins were also moist and tender.  We had to decrease cook time though.  We pulled them after about 17 minutes for 18 muffins.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe! I've been making it for years! I make it as is and it's delicious; If I don't have instant coffee on hand or any strong coffee already made I've been known to add a tablespoon of Bailey's or Kahlua :)

AWESOME!! I just made my first (double) batch of these and they are FANTASTIC! I used some of the previous suggestions and used 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup sugar. I also made 12 large muffins instead of more smaller ones. I also use whole wheat flour as I feel it adds more depth, flavor and nutrition to a recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this, I will be making it again!!

Excellent: The only change I made was that I reduced the fat content by substituting 1/2 cup of canola oil and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesause for the cup of margarine...They came out great.... Yummy

"This was my first time trying out a muffin recipe and was amazed and how easy it was. The muffins turned out really nicely and they were really nice and moist. Although I would add more coffee to it for more of a mocha taste.

These muffins were awesome and so moist!  Next time I think I'd add more coffee because you couldn't really taste the mocha.

I think these are delicious!  The only way that I altered them was that I substituted 1/4 cup Ghirardeli's hot coco mocha dry mix instead of the instant coffee.  Next time I will add 1/2 cup though, because the coffee flavor did not come through.  I, also, used mini chocolate chips and added 1/2 cup to the batter and sprinkled 1/2 cup on top.  Other than the lack of coffee flavor (my own fault), these muffins are very yummy and moist!
P.S. 3 bananas equaled 2 cups for me, and this recipe made 24 muffins.

Yummeee!!! is all I can say. I made a few substitutions just like the others. Used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of canola oil instead of margarine. Also used 1 1/2 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup all purpose flour. Definitley use 3 large bananas and the 3 TBS of coffee.  I also topped off a few with chopped walnuts. Fabulous! Hubby liked them and so did my 15 month old. Definite keeper. Thanx. Think I will try with dark chocolate morsels instead of semisweet next time.

Used more coffee as others suggested.  Cut oil to 1/2 c. and added an extra banana.  Cut sugar to 1/2 cup and used half whole wheat flour.  My granddaughter wanted peanut butter chips instead of chocolate - great idea!  I know this is almost a different recipe, but thanks to Shelley for the basic idea.  The PB chips were very tasty with the banana and coffee flavor.

These are ok. Lovely and moist, I will admit that, but flavour wise, very "meh". I will stick to my TNT banana-chocolate muffin recipe, even as a coffee/mocha lover, these wern't what I was hoping for.

Seriously, these are the BEST muffins ever!!! I used an extra banana and through in some pecan chips as well. They turned out moist and delicious as ever. Such a good recipe because it has a nice hint of banana as well as a hint of coffee without an overpowering flavours.

These were so good and so easy.  I  used 1/2 cup butter, the other half was applesauce and oil.  I used half dark brown and half light brown sugar.  I also used mini chips that I floured first.  These were incredible!  THanks for sharing.

I thought this recipe was great! I did make some adjustments based on what previous reviews said. Instead of margarine and so much white sugar I used: ¾ cup Unsweetened applesauce, ¼ cup butter, ½ cup white sugar, ½ cup brown sugar. I am also a coffee lover so I up'd the coffee to three tablespoons (it was still just a hint of flavor).  I also added a tsp of cinnamon and 2 tsp of flax seed. Everyone loved them! Enjoy!

Delicious!  Fluffy, moist muffins, even with some modifications to make them a bit more health-friendly.  Used 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 butter.  Also cut sugar back by 1/4 c, then used both white and brown sugar.  I upped the instant coffee by 1/2T; also used half whole wheat and half white flour.  I ended up with 12 regular sized muffins, 12 mini muffins, and a mini loaf pan besides!

I've made plenty of banana muffin recipes, but this one is by far the most moist.  It's not entirely accurate to rate it a 5 when I didn't use the recipe as is, but I used the following modifications and these were gobbled up by my husband, who despises coffee: doubled the recipe with 4 bananas, 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of applesauce, 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown, and all else simply doubled and unchanged.  DELICIOUS.

I made this muffin every morning for 5 years at my Bed and Breakfast.  I even won a baking contest at Hildene with them.  I had to use their muffin pans and the muffins actually fell in and the taste alone won me second place.  Awesome recipe. I am making them right now to give to customers at my restaurant.

I followed the review that used 1 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil. Seemed thick, so I added about 1/4 c. milk. After I baked them and we had fallen in love, I realized that I forgot to add sugar!!! As in, I added NO SUGAR!!! I guess the applesauce and choc. chips were sweet enough.  The best muffins I've had in ages.

Delicious, but FOLLOW OTHER REVIEWS!!  I did as recommended using only 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup applesauce and 1/4 c. of oil instead of margarine as well as using 4 tbsp. of coffee instead of one.  Turned out wonderfully moist and not too sweet.  I can see why some would be disappointed with this recipe as is.

These really are wonderful.  The flavor is complex and delicious.  They freeze well.  Nuke two frozen muffins for a minute and they taste oven fresh.

I didn't have any instant coffee so skipped the 'mocha' flavor in this recipe.  LOVED the ch'late chip banana muffins this produced.  Like others, increased the bananas and used a combination of brown / white sugars.  A co-worker said it was all he could do to restrain himself from eating each and every one of them!  I used semi-sweet chips & chunks but this would also be heavenly with milk chips.

This is my favourite muffin recipe of all times. I use it all the time. I have made more batches of these than I could ever remember. 

I substitute the instant coffee with espresso (fresh). I substitute the all-purpose flour for whole wheat. I make them all organic and they are to die for!!

Followed some of the suggestions by the other reviewers. 

Less butter, used white and brown sugarand added nuts and more coffee.
 
Definitiely a keeper, even my husband who doesn't like chocolate chips liked this one.
 
Made 12 at 3pm, only 5 left at 6pm!!
 
Next time though I'll add even more coffee

I also chose to do a lower fat version by substituting 1 cup applesauce 
+ 1/4 cup of oil.  i only used 1 cup of sugar.  Also for added fiber, i used 1/2 cup ground oatmeal, 1 cup wheat flour, and only 3/4 cup all purpose white flour.  The results were definitly satisfactory, but i think i may add all the sugar next time . . .

Yummy!  I used 1/2 cup oil instead of 1 cup margarine, 1/2 cup Splenda instead of sugar, 2 Tbs. instant coffee, sugar-free chocolate chips, and whole wheat flour.  Also I filled my 12 muffin cups fuller (instead of making 15-18)...worked fine!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe. - Becky

Well these turned out very moist and not dry at all! I did use 1/2 cup of olive oil in place of the butter,much healthier this way! I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup and this made them not too sweet just perfect! Not a strong coffee flavour. I will try espresso next time. I did use fresh brewed as to the instant. We dont use that so I didnt have it anyway!Otherwise a great muffin. I also added some pecans, great! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Excellent muffins if you decrease the butter/margarine by half, and only use 3/4 c. sugar.  I also only used 2 bananas and they were perfect!  My kids LOVE them!

Just made these muffins. I only had two bananas and they were perfect, but I can imagine that three would make theme even moister and more yummy. Followed recipe tothe letter otherwise. My son came home from work as I was putting the warm mini-muffins on a rack to cool. He started popping them in his mouth and couldn't stop! I had to stop him though as I made these to take to work tomorrow. I made six large muffins to keep at home, then  made three trays of mini's to take to work. The mini's took about 11-12 minutes to cook. I have those singles packets of Tasters Choice instant coffee and it was the perfect amount. EXCELLENT muffins!

I have made these muffins for the second time in  5 days! They are wonderful. The second time I increased the amount of coffee since I couldn't really taste it the first time.  I love the chocolate chips combined with the banana flavor. I took them to work and everybody was wild about them and wanted the recipe.  Try it...you'll love them.

Overall these were pretty good.  The coffee flavor was not nearly as strong as I expected.  I also imagine cutting back on sugar would work, so I may try that next time.  25 minutes was too long for my oven, they probably only needed 20-22 minutes.

So good! I am sure these were great without my changes but I did try to make them healthier for me. Here is what I did...1/2 cup margarine, 1/2 cup unsweetned applesauce instead of just margarine, 2 eggs whites instead of 1 egg, 3 Tbsps of instant esspresso + 3 Tbsps water (verses instant coffee, I love the taste of coffee!) I omitted the white sugar all together and added 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup slenda (12 pkgs) 
THESE WERE SO GOOD!!! WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!

No doubt about it, these muffins were good, but not anything out of the ordinary.

I didn't have enough butter (and don't ever have margarine in the house) so I used 2 sticks of salted butter, and a 1/2 cup natural applesauce.

We are coffee buffs in this house and instant coffee is never on hand.  So I used 3 tablespoons of our freshly brewed coffee.

Again, they were good.  Just nothing out of the ordinary.  :)

Made this exactly as described minus 1/4 cup of the sugar.  I was a little leary about combining all the ingredients in the food processor, but it woroked out perfectly fine...except when I was trying to scrape and scoop out the dough.  The flavor is great, but like other reviewers I could have used a little more coffee flavor.  And to my surprise I got exactly 18 muffins...I almost never get the exact serving the recipe states.  I did use an ice-cream style scoop to drop my batter.

These are awesome!!! Only changes I did make was using unsweetened applesauce in place of the margarine- used mini choc. chips(what I had on hand) and used the mini muffin tin (we just prefer the mini's over the large muffins). A keeper! Such a great way to use those old brown bananas instead of making boring old banana bread!! Thanks for sharing!

I changed a few things
- 1 cup brewed coffee instead of instant
- substituted whole wheat flour
- 8 tbsp. butter instead of 1 cup margarine
- 2 bananas instead of 3
- added 1/2 c walnuts. 

Only two bananas was plenty, because the taste of banana is pretty strong. The coffee still isn't that strong, but I didn't want to add too much because I wasn't sure where to cut out all the liquid. End result was light, fluffy, and a little healthier. :)

I doubled the coffee and kept everything else the same.   They turned out moist and delicious.  I got major compliments.  My only issue was they looked horrible (not appetizing) due to the coffee color and the bananas I used were almost brown.  Next time, I think I will try to make a lower fat version with applesauce and oil instead of margarine.

Changes and sustitutions like so many others suggested: 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup butter for the margarine, also reduced sugar to 1 cup. Increased the instant coffee to 2 tbl, disolved in 1 tbl leftover coffee from breakfast. Replaced one cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour.  Loved the muffins as they are not to heavy on the banana flavor.  Great recipe for using up ripe bananas, thanks!

I love all kinds of banana bread recipes. I just baked this one... and some of the other reviews were right - its texture is bad and tastes like hay. The first few bites are good, but then you realize the uniqueness is not a good thing.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I modified the recipe. These came out with great flavor and they disappeared with friends asking for the recipe. I just made changes to make them healthier, such as using whole wheat flour, oil and flaxseed instead of butter, and cutting some of the sugar. =)

These were very good.  Changes that I made based on other reviews were to use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and instead of the margarine I used 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup veg. oil.

Easy and turned out great. I made several changes, based on what I had on hand and diet choices. I used half the margarine called for. I only had one banana. I doubled the instant coffee. I used only 3/4 cup choc chips and also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. It is still plenty sweet and I'll cut more sugar next time. I used 1c whole wheat flour. Should have stopped at 1c reg flour. Needed to add 1Tbs half/half after adding that last 1/4 c flour. I added 2Tbs flax seed meal and 1Tb wheatgerm. Looking forward to trying with more banana. They were a bit crumbly, but perfect with a glass of milk! I'm an amateur anyway!! Hope this helps!

I LOVE this recipe.  I double the chocolate chips and use mini ones because I like the extra chocolate.  I also have started baking them like drop cookies to make a cookie/muffin top.  So delicious!

Until today I have always made these with either strong brewed espresso or strong coffee instead of using the instant coffee granules.  Using just coffee, these muffins make an awesome banana chocolate chip muffin, no hint of a mocha taste (we usually use a cream cheese filling - similiar to black bottom cup cakes!).  Bought the instant espresso granules at Wal Mart, of all places, and used those tonight.  The muffin had a good mocha taste.  Not sure which I like better, both ways are really good!

I loved these! I had a ton of frozen bananas taking up space and needed to use some. I used 4 medium sized bananas and they have great banana flavor. I also subbed applesauce for 1/2 the butter and used half whole wheat flour. A little healthy to counter the sugar and yummy chocolate! The espresso gives these such an interesting flavor I loved it and will DEFINITELY make again!

These were very flavorful and moist. The only change I made was I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate as when I went to make them realized my husband had polished off the chocolate ones as a snack. He claims they are more delicious with butterscotch than chocolate would be... (he may just be saying that though to avoid me scolding him further haha)

I didn't care for these, even though my family members and a co-worker enjoyed them.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added 3 tbsp. instant coffee.  I also added extra mini chocolate chips because I love chocolate.  I do enjoy banana bread and I thought the coffee taste overpowered the banana.  (This may just be my personal preference...I'm not a regular coffee drinker...maybe those people who are would like these muffins more than I do.)  If I make these again, I will definitely limit the coffee to no more than 2 tbsp.  I baked 12 regular size muffins and one loaf pan.  I baked the loaf pan for 30 minutes, but I would suggest longer because it wasn't quite done in the middle and it fell.  (I was a little worried about overcooking the loaf because I thought that the muffins were a little too brown.)

I just made these muffins - and they are very good! I will definately make them again.  The only change I made to the recipe was used a heaping tablespoon of the  coffee granules, and about 2 tablespoons of water.  They have a nice "mocha" flavor, which is not too overpowering.  I also used mini chocolate chips, which I think disperse better in muffin recipes than the larger chips.  I got 12 regular size muffins, as well as 24 mini muffins out of the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE (1/27/16): I've made these numerous times, and my kids love them. It's my new "go to" recipe when I have over-ripe bananas to use up. Today I scaled the recipe down to 12 servings and it was the perfect amount for 12 muffins. Bakes for 23 minutes, and they were perfect. These are SO moist, it's hard to stop at just one.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  After reading the reviews and all the changes that other reviewers had made, I was a little befuddled...so decided to go ahead and make the recipe as written and judge for myself (with the exception of doubling the coffee and water as most reviewers agreed on this).  I made these into mini muffins as they get eaten better at our house that way.  Baked them at 400 degrees for 10 minutes...perfect!  I was a little skeptical adding the choc. chips so only added them to half of the first batch, but found out that the choc. flavor really adds to the muffin and ended up covering the ones without chips with a choc. glaze.  These muffins came out moist and flavorful...thanks for the new recipe!

These are the best muffins I have ever made!  They have a nice crisp outter edge with a buttery soft inside.  The texture is heavenly!  I have made these several times now a played around with the recipe, using applesauce instead of butter adding ground flax seed, replacing egg with ground flax seed....no matter how I make it, it turns out great!  But my favorite way is the original way, but using brown sugar instead of white.  I made these for my family when I was visiting my parent's house and they did not last very long!  Everyone loved them!

I made these muffins for the first time today and they are just wonderful! I added a lot more coffee (I don't know how much more I didn't measure) and some more sugar and I baked them for 27 minutes and they turned out perfect!

YUMMY! Didn't have any instant coffee, so I left that out. I also used whole wheat flour, and cut back the sugar to 3/4 c. Next time I will add another banana or 2 because I wished they were more banana-y. Thanks for the recipe!

I guess you can't mess up making these..I used a hodge-podge of ingredients upon the suggestions of others in place of the margarine, including part pumpkin puree from the freezer and part applesauce amounting to almost 1 c in addition to 1/4 c oil. Also used 3 bananas from the freezer (you know how they look awful after awhile, all brown and syrupy)--I was glad for the coffee ingredient (which I tripled) just for the sake of appearance. It really dominated the final product so you'd better like mocha. I'm generally not a fan of coffee (dunno what I was expecting) so I think I might try just plain cocoa powder instead next time.  I did NOT taste the banana, which I missed. Otherwise, I was very pleased with the results after 22 min in the oven-17 good-sized, moist, decadent, teddybear-brown muffins.  P.S. I've not been thrilled with silicone bakeware in the past, but for muffins you can't beat it: no muffin papers, easy to clean, cools quickly so you can almost remove the muffins with bare hands. Try it!

Fabulous taste.  I used mini chocolate chips and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract with 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  To make the recipe a little more healthiere I used 1/2 cup applesauce to replace one of the sticks of margarine.  Also added 2 teaspoons of ground flax seed, which doesn't effect the flavor on way or the other.  This will now be my favorite banana muffin recipe.  Can't wait to pass it on to others.

FANTASTIC MUFFINS!  They were an instant hit!!  I did take some of the other reviews advice.  I replaced half the butter with applesauce, used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup unpacked light brown sugar.  I also used 3 tablespoons of instant coffe dissolved in 2 tablespoons of water for more mocha flavour. These are one of the best muffins ever!

I added extra coffee and you still couldn't really taste it in the muffins.  Good muffins overall, but if there is such a thing as coffee extract/flavouring (?) they could definately benefit from it's addition.

These have a really nice muffin texture. I did cut down the butter and sugar and used 6 tbsp of espresso because I really like to have alot of coffee flavour. These turned out great eventhough I was looking for a mocha chocolate chip muffin recipe. Next time, I will substitute the bananas with apple sauce since bananas are so over powering in taste and flavour.

This recipe was fantastic.  I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers and added 3 Tbsp of instant coffee.  The coffee flavor was subtle, but the overall taste was outrageously good.  Everyone who tried them loved them!  I will definitely make these again!  P.S.:  The smell in the house while these were baking was divine.

Loved it! I wanted to use the other viewers adjustments but only had a half cup of applesauce (1 individual cup of Motts) So I used that with 1/2 cup of canola oil. They were perfect! I also didn't have instant coffee but I used 4T of the old coffee I had brewed from that morning. Worked out great.

These are very good muffins but have to only give them 4 stars because as the ingredients stand, the mocha or coffee flavor cannot be tasted. I doubled the amount of coffee and still couldn't taste it, nor could my husband. I combined suggestions from two different other reviews. This is what I did. I used 1/4 c. veg. oil and 1 c. unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter/margaine. I decreased the amount of sugar (good thing) to 1 c. but used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. dark brown. I used 3 med. bananas because that is what I had and put in 2 T. instant coffee in 2 T. of water. And I added 2 tsp. of flax seeds. Those are the only changes I made. The rest was the same. They are very chocolatey so I may even decrease the choc. chips to 3/4 c. But they are very moist. They do have flavor just not the mocha flavor that the title of the recipe states. I had the idea of using mocha chips next time. I think I have to order those online. I made some big muffins and some mini muffins (baked for 11 minutes) .I will make these again.

These are some of the best muffins I've ever had.  I also swap out the margarine with 1/4c olive oil and 3/4 C fruit puree and some flax seed.  Turns out better and more moist than with using the oil IMO.

These muffins are the best I've ever made!  The bananas and chocolate chips are a great combo but the coffee really makes it extra special.  Looking forward to making and eating more of these delicious muffins!  (I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup and used 1 cup white flour and 1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour).  I don't have a food processor, so I mixed all the dry ingredients in 1 bowl.  I combined the wet ingredients in another bowl.  Mashed the bananas separately and then mixed in with wet ingredients.  Finally, stirred the wet into the dry.  Be sure not to overmix.  Turned out great.

Best banana chocolate chip muffins I ever made or ate! Adjustments: I put half the amount of sugar so 1/4 cup of brown and 1/4 cup of white. I put 1 tsp extra of vanilla (never hurts), more coffee as suggested by many other (3tbsp), only 1/4 cup of margarine and 3/4 cup of applesauce. I would add more chocolate chip next time, maybe by a 1/2 cup. LOVED THEM! They were moist and looked fantastic with a couple of chocolate chip and crushed walnuts on top of each muffin. Do not look elsewhere for a banana chocolate chip recipe! THIS ONE IS IT!

I followed a few suggestions of a reviewer from Jan 2, 2004: I used 4 med bananas, 1/4 c oil and 1 cup applesauce (unsweetened) in place of the margarine. I used 1 rounded T of instant espresso (Medalglia D'oro) dissolved in just a little more that 1 T water, and only 1 cup of sugar.   I live in Denver so I added an additional 1/2cup flour, filled the papers just about all the way full, and baked them at 370 for about 22-23 min.

These muffins are the muffins for coffee lovers! I saw that some people added extra coffee, so I added 4 TBSP disolved in 3TBSP water, definitely too much. I also reduced sugar to 1 cup and used a little less chocolate chips then called for. The chocolate chip and banana already has a nice strong flavor, the extra coffee made the muffins a little too bitter and almost sour. Next time I make them I will follow the recipe exactly.

Fantastic recipe!  Don't have instant coffee, so ended up with chocolate chip banana muffins.  Healthy substitutions: 4 bananas, 1 cup applesauce, 1/4 oil, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 cup WW flour, 1-1/4 cup AP flour, 2/3 cup semisweet choc chips, 1/3 cup dark choc chips; everything else the as written.  Makes 17 medium YUMMY muffins.  Next time, will try subbing 1/4 cup ground flax seed for a nuttier flavour!

WOW! They were amazing! Just loved these babies! Very flavourful, it was almost like eating a cupcake!!! The only complaint I had was the method of mixing - it's the first time I have used my food processor to mix up muffin batter and it wasn't bad until I went to mix in the chocolate chips with a spoon and to spoon the batter out into the muffin cups - I found it a little awkward. Other than that, it was all great!

My family loves these.  I make them as tiny muffins for my kids' snacks and because of the coffee flavor they're also a unique treat for the grown-ups.

Made these muffins last week and they went down great. All my family loved them! only critism is that i couldn`t really taste the coffee in them, maybe i didnt put enough in but i dont think i would bother with it next time. Also i used chocolate chunks instead of chips. Yummy recipe though thanks for sharing!

I altered the recipe like so many reviews said to do: I used 1 cup applesauce instead of margarine, 3/4 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and I don't buy instant coffee so I brewed 1 cup of coffee and put it all in the muffins. Since the muffins were so watery (due to the coffee) I increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups (half whole wheat and half white flour.) The muffins were delicious but since I used brewed coffee, I couldn't taste the coffee, also, the muffins came out too soft. But to be fair, that wasn't the recipe's fault, it was just my error in judgment. I will definitely make them again, but next time with instant coffee. Great recipe! The muffins were delicious!

These were great!  Used less sugar and chocolate chips and substituted yogurt and oil for the 1 cup butter.  Two medium bananas were enough.

These are fantastic!  I used 2 tbsp Maxwell House Orange Capuccino Instant Coffee & 2 tbsp Kahula instead of regular instant coffee and water.  Adds an extra zip to these already delicious muffins!  My husband says they have a real kick to them!

W-O-W!!! Awesome recipe, delicious taste and a great texture (slight crust on the outside, soft and moist inside).  I made this after reading other reviews and followed others' suggestions of using half margarine half applesauce, and 1/2 cup Splenda with 1/2 cup brown sugar (total of 1 cup was definately sweet enough).  Being a huge coffee lover, to intensify the coffee taste I added a whole 1/4 cup of cold brewed coffee (had to add a tiny bit more flour so the batter wouldn't be too liquid).  I also don't own a food processor so was doing the 1st step by hand, and wasn't able to get all the chunks out of the mashed bananas, however I thought this really added to the finished product.  I will definately make these again!! I think next time I might try adding some flaked coconut.

Thank you Shelley! This is the most delicious muffin recipe I've made but with a few changes; 1&1/4 c unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 c milk, 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 c brown&white sugar(1cup total), 1/4 c mini choco chips, and 3tbps coffee in 2tbps hot water. The coffee really enhances the chocolate with a slight hint of banana.

I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 vegetable oil, but otherwise followed the recipe. Like other reviewers, I did not taste the coffee, and found the flavour to be quite bland. Focusing on either the banana or coffee flavour would result in a tastier muffin.

I can not really rate this recipe as I subbed so much to try to go healthy.  I used 1 cup applesauce instead of butter, splenda instead of sugar, and my bananas were probably not ripe enough.  I also didn't have any instant coffee, so I used regular strong brewed coffee (1/8cup).  They are baking right now...we'll see what happens.  Everything is an experiment now that we are trying to be healthy.  I gave it 5 stars though because the idea of mocha with the banana and chocolate is divine!  Great idea.

This is the same recipe that I've been making for years from an old fundraiser cookbook.  When my kids ask me to make muffins, these are the muffins they're talking about.  If I make any other kind, they won't eat them. 

Over the years, I've altered the recipe by adding more coffee, an extra banana, substituting a bit of whole-wheat flour, substituting butter-flavored crisco.  It doesn't matter what I do, they always taste great!

These are so good.  I have made them twice already.  The first time I got the last step of adding the chips and didn't have any!!  So I improvised and added a few spoonfuls of cocoa powder.  I made them as mini muffins (400 degrees for 9 minutes) and they were wonderful!  We loved them so much that I made them the same way again but this time as regular size.  Just as good.  The texture is so soft moist.  They are not dense at all.  We inhale these so quickly!  I am sure they would be wonderful with chocolate chips too!

This recipe is delicious! The muffins turned out to be very moist.  I did make some alterations and followed some of the things that others suggested.  I used 3 tablespoons of coffee in 2 tablespoons water; I used 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup margarine instead of the full cup; and I substituted the egg with 2 tablespoons plain, fat free yogurt.  

I will definitely make these again!

I played around a bit with the coffee. I added three times the amount, taking advice from some of the other reviews. The flavor was great, but it resulted in very moist muffins, so they were a bit hard to eat.

This recipe is ROCK!!! I just made it last night. They come out perfect, delicious. I add more coffee as other reviews recommend. I put 2 tbs of instant coffee and 2 tbs of water. My husband like it so much. I am so in love with this website. I don't need to buy more baking books, and can save the money to buy more ingredients. Thank you all for sharing recipes and comments.

Delicious Muffins.  I reduced the recipe for 12 muffins and added walnuts to the mix. I added a little more chocolate chips, we really like chocolate at my house!  This recipe is going to replace one I have been using for years.  Thank you!

Very tasty and great texture....used butter instead of margarine.  The chocolate really makes these rich and not too sweet.   Great warm and better with coffee! Will definitely make these again!

WOW, super recipe--so easy using the food processor...I used butter and omitted the coffee (don't use instant, so didn't have any in the house) and it's one of our new favs!

When I make these with coffee, the texture of the muffin is a little odd--kind of cardboardy on the outside, yet still moist inside. The banana flavour is lost, yet at the same time, the coffee flavour is not strong enough. I think they just cancel each other out, because all I can taste is the chocolate. When I make this without the coffee, however, the texture and flavour are great--very chocolatey and banana-y.

This is the best muffin recipe I have tried in a long time!  I use special dark chocolate chips in mine...Yum! I do have to agree though that you cant really taste the mocha as the recipe is written.

Yummy.  I added fresh brewed coffee instead of instant, decreased sugar and butter, and used mini choc. chips.   The flavor is extremely subtle.  These are the best muffins I have made.  They would be great w/o the chocolate chips.  This is now the only recipe I will be using!

Yum!!  I followed other reviewers advice and used 4 bananas, 3 tbs of coffee granules and only 1/2 cup butter.  I made 1/2 the mixture as muffins and the other 1/2 as mini loaves.  The muffins were delicious, very moist and great flavor.  The coffee is not really a flavor, more of a flavor enhancer, I think.  As delicious as the muffins were, the loaves were incredible.  Took them to work and they were gone sooo fast.  Will definately make this again.

I made these this morning and they are incredible!  So moist and fine textured with a hint of mocha.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful!  They were also very quick and easy to make.  I used my hand mixer instead of the food processor and they turned out just fine.  I will definitely make this one again!

Excellent recipe. The title should omit the mocha part; the coffee works in it, but is not a strong flavor at all (I used 1 shot of Starbucks espresso). I also used a 9x13 pan instead of muffin cups, and it worked; the bread had a beautiful top and was perfect after 25-27 minutes. I used 1c. butter, the original amount of sugar, and added some extra chocolate chips (less than 1/4 cup) and sprinkled some on top, which made for a very nice mix of flavors. NOTE: If you do not have a large food processor, use a hand mixer, not a blender. Just make sure to process the bananas well first (in a small food processor or with the mixer; I used very ripe, pretty brown peeled bananas, which mashed well) and use soft butter, and you'll be fine - just make sure you get all the lumps out at the end. Check this one out, even if you don't like bananas normally!

I made these for my family, and they absolutely love them.  I didn't have any instant coffee and tried substituting some really strong brewed coffee, but I ended up not tasting it in the muffins.  Regardless, they're really moist and absolutely delicious!

Just made a batch of these, followed the recipe exactly (I always do that the first time) and they are very good.  I will reduce the sugar, and increase the coffee next time, but they are great as is.

I followed the recipe exactly except used the smaller muffin tins and cooked for 14 minutes. I did used the mini chocolate chips.  I think using the food processor makes the texture just right. These are wonderful!  Thanks for sharing.

These are by far the best muffins I have ever tried. I am about to make them for the 2nd time in a couple weeks. I substituted the margarine for 1 cup applesauce and used 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of 1 1/4 cups white sugar. I also used real coffee as I don't have instant coffee on hand. They turned out awesome! Thanks so much for sharing Shelley!! :)

i didn't have instant coffee, so tried using really strong espresso shots.  I used 2 shots and could barely taste the coffee flavor.  they were still delicious, but i bet the coffee taste is more prominent with the instant coffee.

This recipe is a staple in my college household. We love these muffins, but they are a treat/dessert, not a meal muffin. We also triple the coffee so that we can taste the mocha.

These were really yummy but a bit heavy on the banana for my taste.  I think if I make them again I would cut it down to 2 bananas.  I think I would also try using a substitute for the butter to make them a little lighter.

These muffins are soooo good!  The first time i made them I couldnt really taste the coffee so i suggest doubling the amount as i do now.  I have also made them without the chocolate chips to make them a bit healthier and i love them that way as well (although i do realize they arent really "mocha" anymore).  These are excellent!

These are very yummy!  And they're even better with a steaming cup of coffee!  I didn't have margarine on hand, so I used 1/4 cup of oil and 1 cup of applesauce.  Also, all I had are the small, sweet African bananas, so I used 6 of them.  I would like to note that you should only use muffin liners with these.  They stick to the pan pretty badly.  The first time I made them I was not able to get them out, but paper muffin liners help with that problem.  My friends all love them when we have brunch.  Quite yummy for any and every coffee lover!

Good, but I couldn't taste the mocha flavor at all.  Will use more instant coffee next time for sure!

I really loved these muffins. After reading many of the reviews, I made a few changes to make them a little healthier. I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup of canola oil in place of the margerine, upped the coffee to 2.5 tbs dissolved in the same amount of water, used only 1 cup of sugar and used whole wheat pastry flour (that was all I had). They turned out very, very moist with a strong mocha flavour and kind of a background banana flavour. Will definitely be making these again soon.

These muffins are AMAZING!  My younger brother said that these should have six stars. ;)  I did take the advice of some of the other cooks and added about double the coffee.  I also reduced the butter by 4-6 T. or so and added some milk as it was pretty thick.  I did about 1/3 wheat flour and cut back the sugar (3/4 white and 1/4 brown). I also put some sliced almonds on top, which added a nice touch.  They are great.  So dessert-like that they're almost too sweet for a breakfast.  They would be great for a brunch.

My family enjoyed these muffins. Like some of the other reviewers, I made a few substitutions to make them a bit healthier. I used 1/2 cup butter,and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of the 1 cup margarine, I used egg substitute and instead of all of that sugar, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup Splenda.  I also substituted  instant expresso for instant coffee. The muffins were moist but were still too sweet for our tastes, I will cut back more on the sugar/sweetener next time!  I think they can use a little more texture, I might add some oatmeal next time!!

A hit with even my picky eaters who don't usually eat breads and cookies. I did add a bit extra coffee flavor as the others had suggested. Very good.

I made these with the help of my daycare children and during the fiasco, I managed to accidentally leave the butter in the microwave.  As I was getting out the first batch, I realized this and was very bummed.  But guess what?  These still turned out marvelous without all that fat!  I used 2 Tb coffee with 2Tb water.  Next time I make this, I will use some butter, but def not as much as was called for.  Yummmm

These were by far the best muffins I have ever tasted.  Even my friend who is a total food snob loved them.  We fought over them in our house.  The texture was great.  I did double the coffee.  Great recipe!

I thought these were good, but my husband really liked them so I gave this five stars. I only put in a cup of sugar, which was good, and actually almost forgot it. So that was put in last. And, only had 2 bananas so thats what I used. My husband took them to a football party and they loved them. Oh, and my coffee mixture was 2 tblsp coffee, 1 tbsp water. I didn't want to give my kids a caffeine high. The batter was pretty thick, so I added a couple tbsp of water to it. Obviously this is a recipe that would be hard to mess up. thanks!

Great taste and texture.  It was a little light on the mocha flavour but regardless they didn't stay around for long.

Not enough coffee flavor to truly refer to these as mocha. We still enjoyed them, and I will make them again. Next time though, I'll be adding more coffee than what the recipe calls.

I am always looking for great muffin recipes,  I found one!!  FANTASTIC...  as others have tried I did use 3 tbsp instant coffee.  I also used 1/2c butter with 1/2c applesause.  1/2c white with 1/2c brown sugar.  For my own twist, as I like to do,  I did add 1/2 tsp almond extract, cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg for some extra flavor.  i also used whole wheat pastry flour. I love these muffins!!  Thanks for the idea!!!

I doubled the recipe, used 7 bananas, 1 c. brown sugar, 1 cup white, added around 1/4 c. ground flax seed.  Looked in the microwave afterwards and found forgotten melted margarine! Accidentally only put in about 3/4 c. Margarine in for a double recipe! They were still fabulous. ALso, I had run out of choc. chips and shockingly my kids still wolfed them down.  So did I. Now I can always reduce the margarine!

I used  1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white. (Plenty sweet enough.) I used 1/2 the amount of butter. (Plenty moist enough.) I used 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. (Plenty chocolate enough.) I used whole wheat flour instead of regular white flour. I used the suggested amount of instant coffee dissolved in brewed coffee. (Not nearly enough coffee flavor for me.) Good overall flavor but nothing over the top for me. Doubt I would make again.

Really great recipe! I followed some of the changes made throughout the different reviews. I've put 3 tbsp of instant coffee in 2 tbsp of hot water. I've replaced ½ cup of white sugar for brown sugar, and ½ cup of margarine for apple sauce. I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I've used 4 squares of Baker's Secret semi-sweet chocolate. These muffins are so good that I really have to hide them if I want to keep a few! :P

I split this recipe into two parts and baked them both in bread pans because I didn't have a muffin pan. I cooked each for about 27 minutes. It turned out surprisingly well. Basically a very muffin-y bread. Soo gooey. Awesome.
I also added 4 tbsps of instant coffee, didn't do any harm. Could probably even add more.

These turned out great! :) They rose beautifully and are so soft! Used 1/2 cup butter, 2 tbsp instant coffee granules, 1 cup sugar and about 5 small bananas. My only little complaint is that I can't really taste the bananas...might try this again without the coffee or use another type of banana...

My roommates and I love banana bread and muffins. I found this recipe and thought that it would be a nice twist. I only used one cup of sugar, replaced half of the butter with applesauce, used egg beaters in place of an egg, and cut back (only a little) on the chocolate chips. I used hershey's dark chocolate chips. You had a nice little bit of chocolate in each bite. They were delicious and a big hit with my household.

I used half canola oil and half u/s butter for the margarine.  I subbed the instant coffee granules for instant expresso powder and added 1 tsp. Kahlua to try and intensive the mocha flavor, others reported as not being dominant enough.  I like my muffins on the small side so I made 18 regular size and 24 mini.  The mini baked at 375 for 12 minutes.  I baked the regular ones for 26 min. Overall, good flavor, the hint of banana was nice and the surprise of chocolate a big hit with my friends.

These are fantastic! I used half applesauce and half margarine and you would never know the difference! i also used half a cup more chocolate chips! They could definatly use more coffee though as you can't really taste it. 3 tablespoons would be great:) MMMMMMMMM sooo good! will make these many more times:)

These are great muffins. I will put more batter in each cup next time as I thought they didn't puff up enough. I used butter and extra chocolate chips and they turned out really good. Will definately make these again.

Very moist and flavorful, but even after using 4 T instant coffee dissolved in 2 T water, I still couldn't taste it! The banana/chocolate chip flavors were wonderful, though!

Excellent muffins. Really soft and moist. I upped the salt by a quarter tsp. and added an extra two tablespoons of coffee granuales. You could really taste the moch then :) I made 12 regular sized muffins, 12 mini muffins, and 2 gigantic muffin tops from one batch!

I dislike chocolate so I omitted the chips. I also made this in a loaf pan instead of muffins. It was really, really good. I'll definitely make this often, it's a great weekend breakfast item.

Simply amazing!  I did what some of the suggestions said - used 4 teaspoons of instant coffee instead of 3, and I used only three fourths of the butter suggested.  YUMMMY!

Very good. The inclusion of the coffee gives the muffins a lovely colour. I added the amount of coffee---one T. didn't give it enough flavour.

EXCELLENT! Easy to make and very moist. I think the moistness of these muffins is what makes the recipe a favourite of mine. I agree with other reviewers that the coffee must be doubled if you want a truly mocha flavour. I ran out of paper liners mid-way through baking a double batch. The muffins popped out of a sprayed pan with ease. Definitely a keeper!

I like to consider myself a muffin master, but these are the best I've ever made. I bake 2 batches a week- some to mail to friends and the rest for my family. Instant espresso creates an especially delicious mocha flavor!!!

Awesome.  There were delicious and moist.  They disappeared so quickly.  I read the other reviews and then made the following changes: 1/2 the butter, 3/4 cup of sugar (into which I subbed a little brown sugar) and doubled the amount of instant coffee.  The mocha was subtle but you could taste it.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half regular.  I thought these were just right.  Best muffin recipe I've found - they are my "go to" now.

The only reason I did not give these delicious muffins five stars is because I thought they needed more coffee flavor. I halfed the butter and used walnuts instead of chocolate  chips and they were amazing.

Mmmm... very nice. I added 3 tablespoons of coffee instead of 1, which gave it a nice subtle coffee flavor. Instead of three bananas, I used two, which turned out to be perfect. I also greatly reduced the sugar. The day after, I stuck it in the microwave on HIGH for 20 seconds which melted the chocolate chips and made it taste like it just came out of the oven. I brought it to my friends who absolutely ADORED them. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! it is very good, little sweetish, i added only 2 bananas and 1/4 cup of mini chocolate morsels and sprinkled walnuts on the top. I baked them in loaf pan and it took longer time to cook, next time will bake them in muffin pans, will surely try it again, but will reduce the sugar.

The last time I made them, they disappeared.  Instantly.  Now I pray for my bananas to go soft so I can make a double or triple batch and save some aside to toss in the freezer for a quick breakfast when I'm running late.

Excellent!!! Very moist! I left out the coffee and decreased the butter by 25%. I made 48 mini-muffins and baked them for about 11 minutes. Also, just used a hand mixer instead of processor and it worked fine.

This is as good as it gets. The texture is light and fluffy, the taste is rich (I love bananas) and it was easy to make. I reduced the chocolate chips to about 3/4 cup because I didn't want it to overpower the banana flavour. I also omitted the coffee, and replaced it with a tbsp of water (just to thin the batter). I definitely recommend this recipe.

I wanted just a plain banana and chocolate chip muffin recipe and I thought this was ideal.  I made it without the instant coffee and it was just fabulous!!!!!!!  Very moist and exactly what I wanted.  I added the whole 12 oz package of chocolate chips.

Loved this recipe! It was good and so easy with the food processor.  I did do a few of the changes mentioned in the reviews. I used 4 bananas and only 1/2 cup butter, and 3 tablespoons of instant coffee granules.  Good for something different in the morning.

Excellent.  I took the advice of others and used 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup apple sauce to reduce the amount of fat.  I also used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar totally 1 cup altogether.  It didn't need the other 1/4 cup sugar.  It was very moist and sweet.  The chocolate chips added a nice taste.  My husband was crazy about them.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Before making these muffins, I read all of the other reviews.  After following the recipe to a tea, I added two more tablespoons to the coffee directions and dissolved it in three tablespoons of hot water, then added in to the mix.  This did make the batter a little thin,  but in the end,  they were great.  The only thing that I would do differently is fill the miffin cups almost to the top.  After filling the cups about 3/4 full, once they were baked, they  didn't have a good round top, next time I will fill the muffin cups more.  The muffins didn't rise as much as I thought they would.  Everything else remained the same.
This is a great after-school snack.

I was looking for a recipe to use my new texas size muffin tins. and I love chocolate chocolate chip muffins I also love coffee so i thought this recipe would be great! I followed some of the other reviews and used 1/4 c oil and 1 c applesauce instead of the margarine. I only used 1 cup of sugar.  I also used 5 Tablespoons of instant coffee in 1 tablespoon of water. I love chocolate so i added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder and used  the whole cup of chocolate chips. In my big muffin tins the recipe made 9 all together without adding anything extra. I brought the muffins to my Ladies Bible Study and they were a big hit.  A day later they were still moist and yummy!  the applesauce and banana's add a nice fruity taste to the muffins. they are so good!! this is the best recipe all the ladies at my bible study wanted the recipe!

These muffins were AWESOME!  They turned out fluffy and light, absolutely delicious.  They would also be great without the chocolate chips.  My daughter and husband also liked them.  I ate three right out of the oven with a tall glass of cold milk, yum, yum!

Made it subbing applesauce for the butter to make it low-fat....fantastic!!!  They are so moist and very delicious.  Will also try using egg substitute next time.

Oh my Gosh, soo good! I changed it up a bit. I used 1 cup of oat flour ( I grounded old fashioned oats in the blender ), 1cup of all Purpose flour, & 1/4 cup of spelt flour. I used 1/2 cup of coconut sugar, 1/2 of organic sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of maple flavoring extract, & instead of margarine, I used 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil ( make it healthier). I also followed everyone’s suggestions to add 3 tablespoons of instant coffee with warmed 5 tablespoons of filtered water. I will make this again for sure! Awesome recipe! Btw, it woke me up because of the coffee in it!

These were really good. I've made them five or six times now as they are much in demand! The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of a few less chocolate chips (I used about 3/4 cup). They were really good as written, but the following times I also used a white sugar/brown sugar  mix and increased the coffee to 2 tbsp. which I think made them even better. My suggestion is to follow the recipe the first time and then adjust to your taste, but a really good recipe.

I followed the ingredients exactly.  I greased and floured the muffin tins b/c I didn't have any liners.  But the muffins came right out w/out any problems.  I got 16 muffins out of this batch.  My son and I really like these muffins.  I couldn't taste the coffee at all, and I had to tell my son that it was in there b/c he couldn't taste it either.  That didn't bother us any b/c I wouldn't want any flavor overpowering another.  It all just blended really well.  I wonder if the reviews that say the muffins fell apart were b/c they over mixed the recipe?  Oh, and the temp and time was right on for me.

These were excellent using the original recipe, except increasing the coffee and using butter rather than margarine.  They are moist and tasty.  The mocha, banana , chocolate chip flavirs are very complementary. I put this one in my recipe box!

Wow!  These muffins are WAY to sweet!  Ripe bananas are sweet on their own, combining them with over a cup of sugar is way to much!

This is very good recipe, I love the texture it is moist and enjoyable. I followed the recipe exactly but I used 1/2 cup semi sweetened chocolate and 1/2 cup white chocolate. it turn out successful. the recipe produced about 18 muffins and lasted about 4 days in my home ( kept it outside) and it stayed fresh like anything. 

Thanks and definitely this recipe is going to go in my recipe copybook for future !!

A great recipe for delicious muffins! 

Just one thing I did differently though: my blender was unable to mix the flour in, so I used a wooden spoon instead. But it mixed in well and the muffins were just perfect.

Very delicious muffins! The only thing I changed was the coffee and the margarine. I doubled the coffee and used Country Crock tub because I didn't have any margarine in the house. But needless to say, they were yummy! Even my husband who does NOT eat sweets, loved these. I liked them because it was a very light sweetness to them (not super sugary). The recipe worked really well with mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. My co-workers have definitely NOT complained about me bringing these goodies in 2 day in a row!

Excellent.  Made a loaf instead of muffins and added time to cook. I left out the coffee so my toddler could eat them and it tastes great.

This was DELICIOUS!   I was trying to make a chocolate chip muffin with flavors that my children would enjoy, so I was worried about adding the coffee but it was not dominant.  I probably added a bit more vanilla, and I was leery about all the butter, so I cut it in half and didn't replace it with anything because the batter looked moist enough.  I used half brown sugar, half white sugar.  The taste?  Nearly identical to a Nestle tollhouse cookie!  YUM!

Fantastic recipe.......I followed JMICHELLE's advice.  Turned out superb!  I was concerned the mixture was a little moist, I might add some quick oats next time but that is all.  My kids LOVED these!

Great recipe!  I had to use instant mocha, but other than that followed recipe to the "T".   I made into muffin tops instead of traditional muffins.

These fantastic muffins disappear as fast as I can make them.  I double the amount of coffee to give a more mocha-flavour, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  Love it!

They are delicious, but lose a star because they don't taste like coffee at all.  If you are expecting mocha, you'll need to increase the amount of coffee in the recipe.

Yum! Really good recipe. Increased the coffee as per the suggestions from other reviewers and still couldn't taste the coffee. I do, however, feel the coffee added flavour, just not a coffee flavour.

Great recipe! I made the dough, refrigerated overnight, and baked the next morning. I also tripled the coffee granules (but still used 1 Tbsp water). A tip for mashing bananas: just mush them while they're still in their skin -- no extra dirty dishes :) The peel might split a little, but you can keep on mushing them up.

I dont have a food processor so just used my bowl and wooden spoon to whip these up and they turned out great.  they were super moist, so much so they seemed to not want to leave the tray so i would suggest lining the cups. I forgot to add vanilla and will remember not to add it next time b/c i dont want to change a thing from what i ate today.  They werent very muffin-like to me, it was almost something between a cup cake and a cookie.  The muffin tops were crisp and they didnt bloon out as i had expected.

Very good!  Only used half a cup of butter instead of a full cup and was still delicious and moist.  I would suggest adding a little milk to make up for the absence of butter though.  Also, it's the holiday season so I wanted these to be a little more festive... instead of using chocolate chips, I used green and red dark chocolate m&m's (aand I put in about a cup and a half of them)... sooo good!

I'm not a huge fan of banana muffins/bread, so I'm probably not a good reviewer for these, but everyone else liked them a lot.  They were pretty good.

Only thing i did differently was to add an extra TB of instant coffee, even with that change the mocha flavor was subtle.  It is a delicious muffin.

This is an amazing recipe. My bananas must've been small as my batter was a bit dry, so I had to add 1/4 cup of milk for it to come together (didn't have a 4th banana to mash up). I will definitely make it again! Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I just followed all the instructions except for 1, I placed it in a 8 inch round cake pan since i don't have muffin pans at home. It turned out great! It's really big hit!

These are so good!  I left out the instant coffee because I didn't have any and used whole wheat flour and 1/2 Splenda 1/2 sugar to make them a little healthier and my husband couldn't stop eating them!  Also, I don't recommend baking these as a loaf, stick to the muffins as recommended!

I made these muffins for work and everyone enjoyed them.  They don't have a real strong mocha flavor (maybe need to add more coffee), but they were very delicious.  Will definately make them again, and so easy to make in the food processor.  Thanks for sharing Shelley

Well this was fun!! lol.  I started making these and realized a.  I had no eggs and b. I had no paper muffin cups, so what does one do in this situation...to the store you say, however that would have been the simple thing to do.  I used mayonaisse as an egg replacement and decided to not use paper cups.  3 TBSP of mayonaisse worked great however I'd suggest having paper cups, I ended up using tinfoil when I realized this was indeed a resipe that needed more then a greased pan.  

Now to the actual muffins themselves, for the majority I didn't put in any of the coffee as my partner hates anything coffee flavoured (loves coffee though), but they taste great with or without the coffee, we loved them, very tasy, taste a bit rich after a couple though.  Thanks for this great recipe, I will definately be making these again!!!

I followed the advice given by those who tried the recipe earlier by using 1/4c grapeseed oil+1c applesauce instead of butter or margarine. Grapeseed oil is odorless and can withstand higher cooking temperature compared to olive oil so it is better for baking. Added walnuts for extra crunch.The bitterness of walnuts helped to counteract on the sweetness of semi-sweet choc chips. And a dash of cinnanmon for frangrance. I only used 1 1/2 tbsp of coffee granules with 1tbsp of water so the coffee frangrance and taste wasn't overpowering. However, I sense there is something still missing in terms of ingreditent to add that extra oomp. Maybe I shoulded have used 1 to 1.5 tsp of cinnamon to bring out the frangrance. Just haven't quite found out what it is yet. Set the oven at 180degrees for about 25-30min in a fanforced oven with heating element working both the top and bottom of the oven. If heat is only kept at the top element, then the top of the muffins will turn cardboardy in texture and worst get burnt before the muffin is cooked in the inside. Great recipe regardless, and I will use it again.

Scrummy! My children do not drink coffee and I asked them to guess the 'magic ingredients'  My son said banana. I told him coffee was in the muffins too. He was quite impressed.A recipe catering to adult and children alike. 
I did add slightly more coffee and replaced 1/8 of butter with applesauce.

Superb! I 3x the coffee and it darkens the muffins,but you can really taste the coffee. I split the sugar & used 3/4c white and 1/2c brown. I used mini chips and made mini muffins and easily got over 36. Very moist and yummy. Thanks for sharing!

I also doubled the coffee granules, just because so many had done so, and I enjoyed the flavour. When I tried them warm from the oven they didn't taste nearly as good as the next day. Easy, reasonably quick.

These are great - very moist and tasty.  The only thing was there was NO mocha taste whatsoever.  I even used the 3 T instant coffee disolved in 2 T water, but still there was no coffee flavor at all.  I gave it a 4 star though, because the muffins were still very tasty.

followed the advice of others and reduced butter to 1/2 cup and sugar to 3/4 cup. i also did the 3 tbsp instant coffee but wasn't satisfied still with the coffee taste. maybe 4-4 1/2 tbsp would do the trick. careful not to overbake!

Awesome.  I did use 3 TBSP of coffee as recommended.  Next time I will cut the amount of margarine in half not because they weren't great with full fat but I try to cut it where I can!  Thanks...my other banana muffin recipes are in the trash!

These are very yummy -- I used oil instead of butter and only used 1/2 cup, also cut back on the sugar.  I used instant espresso powder and got a nice coffee flavor.  My kids (and I) love these!

The muffins tasted very good and were easy to make.  Hardly any mocha flavor though and I double the amount listed in the recipe per other reviews.  That was a disappointment.  Otherwise, lowered the butter and sugar a bit per other reviews as well and they were still very moist and tasty.  Good muffins, just don't get excited about the "mocha" listed in the title.

I liked this a lot. i cut down a little on the butter and sugar and trippled the amount of coffee powder. also I added chopped walnuts instead of the chocolate chips which was very tasty and made them less sweet.

I loved this recipe!  I used this recipe to make 54 muffins for a charity bake sale.  If you really like mocha you will have to increase the coffee accordingly.  The mocha taste is subtle if made according to recipe instructions.

Great muffins, although a little bit too chocolatey. (I used a good quality dark chocolate, chopped)
Next time I will omit the chocolate and increase the coffee, for more coffee flavour.
I think coffee/banana will be fine.

I only had 2 over-ripe bananas and they turned out so good! I think I'll always only use 2 because I'm not a huge fan of banana flavored anything. 2 was just right.
I used an electric hand mixer for 2 minutes and then stirred the dry ingredients and chocolate chips in by hand. I also filled the cups right up to the top of the paper edge and made 12 nicely rised muffins.
Like others have mentioned with cutting the butter and sugar down....  I used 3/4 c butter and 1 c sugar and added extra flour due to my altitude. They are delish! I'm going to double the coffee granules next time just for kix.
Thanks!

These are so delicious!  I took a few of the readers' advice and halfed the margarine and cut the sugar to one cup.  They were very moist and plenty sweet.
I didn't have any instant coffee granules on hand, so I used 1 tbsp brewed, cold decaf.  I could have used more to add more coffee flavor.
My kids loved them, too.  Thanks for the great recipe Shelley!

Very good, but a little too buttery.  I doubled the coffee; it cleverly replaces what would have been a butter aftertaste with a coffee aftertaste.

These muffins are fantastic! I made a few changes: halved the butter, used only 1/2 cup sugar, and 3/4 cup chocolate chips. I upped the coffee to 3 tablespoons (still couldn't really taste it, though). Everyone loved these!

These muffins are SOO good. Everytime I make them they're gone in less than 24 hours, and there are no kids in our house! I usually add 1/4 cup white chocolate chips and it tends to cut down on the banana flavor, which I think is great. It's also good if you try adding peanut butter chips, but it wasn't as good as the white chocolate chips.

I am a vegetarian and DO NOT eat eggs.  In place of eggs, I substitute 1 heaping tablespoon of plain yoghurt for each egg.  Even with the subsitituion, these turned out great. Like others, I did not use the coffee. The recipie and is easy, and when properly stored, the muffins will keep for a long time.  I took the chance and made these the night prior to my family's airline flight the next day - to take on board.  They were great and east to travel with.  Thank you for sharing a great recipie.

I too left out the coffee (just don't like coffee-flavored anything) and thought they were fabulous. 

Everyone at my work loved them!  Definitely moist and delicious.  It's a keeper!

This recipe was amazingly easy! I followed the other reviews and cut back to 1c. sugar and increased the coffee to 2T. The muffins were so moist, and whatever leftovers I had I brought to work and was asked for the recipe threefold. Thanks.

Absolutely fantastic! 

Instead of butter or margarine, I used 1 cup of apple sauce (home made by boiling 5 chopped medium sized apples in 3 Tsp of water and mashing it), and 4 level tsps of instant Nescafe coffee, dissolved in 3 tsp water, 3/4 cup of sugar.  Didn't have choco chips, so left it out. Kept in my bread bin in the fridge overnight so that it wouldn't stick to the paper cups. The 23 cakes vanished in less than 2 days. I could fainlty smell coffee (in spite of 4 tsp added) but the taste didn't stand out. 

The second time, I used 6 medium sized bananas for more moisture, in the first batch, mixed the choco chips, but it melted in the mixture, didn't spoil the taste though. In the second batch, I sprinkled the chips on top. Oh yes, added 5 tsp of coffee this time for a stronger coffee taste.

DELICIOUS.....

This is a wonderful recipe! My boys gobbled them up!  After reading the other reviews, I used 2 tbs of the instant coffee, and half sugar and half Splenda.  I only had 1/2 cup of choc chips so I used half peanut butter chips and threw in some walnuts!  Next time will try less sugar and more Splenda, and add some wheat germ and/or flaxseed to make it a tad healthier.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  Im always looking for a good way to use up bananas!  I used mini chocolate chips and made mini muffins, baked for about 13 minutes.  I like a little more "coffee" flavor, so next time I will use 2Tbs. of instant coffee.  All and all a great recipe for something a little different!!

Very good.  Did add more (3T) of coffee granules than called for, but still couldn't taste it as much as I'd like-banana kinda overpowers it.  So next time I'll just use more coffee or leave the  bananas out. Coffee dissolves just fine if you use very hot water.  Also I followed others' advice and only used 1 cup of sugar and for fat only used 1/4 cup margarine and 3/4 cup applesauce-worked great and they were plenty sweet.

What a great recipe! We've made these at least a dozen times. They are a real hit with company! I haven't tried it with margarine, but 1 cup butter was too much for us - 1/2 cup works fine. Also, we have had better luck with foil muffin cups.

Thanks!

These were a success! The best result I've had from a muffin recipe. Very moist and tasty.  Will make it again and try more coffee (as couldn't taste any) and 1/2 less banana and maybe some cocoa powder to make them look more chocolatey as they are quite light in colour.

delicious muffins, and you really can't detect the mocha or the banana either.
the recipe turns out to perfection: you can also glaze them with anything you like.
definitely a keeper.

I love making these muffins.  I alway use 2-3 Tbsp of coffee for a stronger mocha taste - I think it needs it.  They are so full of chocolate chips and are great to eat next day when they are completely cool. Mmmmmmm.

These were disappointing. After all of the reviews you would expect something a little better. I would not make these again as I found them lacking any definative taste except for chocolate. If that is your taste then I guess you would like them.

This recipe was great. I followed previous reviews and used a fourth cup instant coffee, a fourth cup oil, a cup applesause, three fourths cup chocolate chips, and walnuts. I was a bit worried because in the batter you could clearly taste the mocha, but it faded during cooking. Next time I will use more bananas (mine were on the small side) and less chocolate.

Could not taste the coffee at all. Will add more next time. Taste just like boring banana bread that doesn't have spices, smells just like it too! But you gotta use the BEST chocolate chips with this recipe! (I used Guittard). Who doesn't love chocolate with banana?? I recommend drizzling melted chocolate on these--heck, smother them with it!!!

These muffins were awesome, and I didn't even have chocolate chips!!  Instead I cut up dark chocolate with almond "Nuggets".  I really suggest adding nuts to these.  Will definately make again, so easy to mix up in food processor!  I ate all 18 muffins myself over a week and a half period!  YUMMY!

They're still warm from the oven and I want to eat them all by myself! I know I'll be making these often. I used only 1 cup sugar. They are still pretty sweet to me. Also I used one cup white flour and one cup mixture of spelt, gram, and whole wheat flours. Gives them a nutty taste and great texture. They're still light and moist. I took the advice of another person and sprinkled the tops with chopped pecans and chopped up chocolate chips. They not only taste out of this world but are very pleasing to the eye. I added more coffee grandules than was called for(1 & 1/2 T.) but I can't say I can really taste any 'mocha' flavor. I think I'll add 2 T. next time. And there will be a next time...SOON!

We liked these a lot.  Didn't  taste the coffee but it may have complimented the chocolate chips.  Instread of 1 c butter I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce and also reduced the sugar to 1 c.  They were still plenty sweet.  Made 18 muffins.

I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup vanilla greek yogurt in place of margarine and decreased the sugar to 1 cup. The muffins were very light and moist. My family loved them. I will definitely make them again!

These are by far the best banana muffins I’ve had. Eating as I type. As others have noted, I’d make them again with a bit more of the instant coffee. I don’t know if certain brands make a difference but I used the Timmies instant coffee. I also made them as jumbo muffins....yum!!

Followed the recipe as written.  They were moist and good.  However, we discovered we don’t like the chocolate chip-banana combination.  Weird, since we like both flavors a lot, just not together.

These were delicious.  Only issue was that they didn't rise well.  It could be that I used an electric beater, and may have mixed too much after adding the flour.  Or, it could be my altitude of 5,000 Ft.  The batter was much thicker than a normal muffin batter.  Will definitely try it again, though.

Last minute discovery yielded that I was a banana short, and a quarter cup of choc. chips short. Well, darn. I used a kidlet tub of applesauce (say 1/2 C) and made the diff in chips up with cinnamon chips. It was fantastic, one for the books for sure.

I enjoyed this recipe. The kids loved it. Next time I will try it with vegetable oil instead of butter and less sugar. These don’t have an overpowering coffee flavor, it’s just adds a depth of flavor.

These were probably the best muffins I’ve ever made. I used butter instead of margarine and I only had 2 large bananas so I added a bit of milk to compensate for the missing moisture. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

My mistake to use leftover French Press coffee rather than instant. I also had to use a "No Salt" substitute which I think made a difference. We both found it bland. Will try again though as I love the idea.

Probably the best muffins I have ever had. I loved them. Not sure about the review that says they tasted like hay. I even added some protein powder (vanilla, plant based) into mine and they were still the best thing ever. I have serious cravings for these muffins and like to freeze them, for when those cravings hit.

At the risk of being scolded by those who don't like it when we made changes, I made a few change to these and they came out perfect. I think they would have been a 5 star without the changes, but here's what I did:
1.  Reduced butter to 1 stick (never use margarine)
2.  Used 3/4 cups of granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  
3.  Upped the amount of vanilla to 1 tbsp
4.  Added 1/2 cup sour cream in place of the second stick of butter 
5.  Added 1 cup of finely chopped pecans
6.  Instead of instant coffee, used 1 tbsp expresso granules.  No water needed, just added to the batter.

I did the normal creaming of the fats with the sugars, then used a whisk to combine flour and other dry ingredients to get some air into this mix.  Used a mixer instead of a food processor.  Then made 60 mini muffins.

they were good the first date, but try to wait for them to cool completely.  The next day they are super moist and just can't stop eating them.

for those on weight watchers, my modified recipe is 3 points per muffin.

A family favorite. I add about 3.5 tablespoon of the instant coffee because only 1 tablespoon doesn't add enough mocha flavor for our tastes. Definitely recommend!!!

Very tasty muffins. The only change I make is tripling the instant coffee.

-1 star because these muffins are quite dry the next day - if they last that long!

I loved this recipe, but I didn't follow it exactly.  I substituted 1/4cup oat bran for 1/4 cup of the flour to give it a little more body texture and flavor.  I put a little oat bran in many of my baked goods with great results and this recipe was no exception.  Yum!

Love this recipe. Make it exactly as written except with Bobs Red Mill Gluten Free baking flour. Delicious!  This is my go-to old banana recipe. I make mini muffins and bake for 9 minutes. Makes 48. I freeze what we don't eat and thaw them as needed.

I love this recipe! I make them all the time! Instead of instant coffee granules though, I use a coffee liqueur and use about 3 tablespoons.

My husband, son and parents all raved about how moist and tasty these are!  I followed the directions exactly and loved the ease of mixing them up in the food processor.  I started with cold butter and it still worked perfectly.  I will likely try adding a couple tablespoons more of coffee next time as no one mentioned the mocha flavor -- just the banana/chocolate.  Also, I used an ice cream scoop to fill my lined muffin tin and got a full 1 1/2 dozen from this recipe.  One of my tins is dark coated, so I reduced the temperature in the over by 25 degrees.  Those came out a little lighter in color than the others, which were a bit dark for my liking.  That being said, no one complained!  I'll definitely watch them more closely next time I bake them.  Can't wait to try them myself!  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were totally outrageous!  I used Angellee74's modifications and my girlfriend and I ate the entire batch on a recent road trip.  Given my muffin tins, I was able to make 15 regular muffins and 12 mini-muffins.  Cooked the mini-muffins for 15 minutes, the regular for ad additional 10.  Perfect!

I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and added a banana.  People give me their bad bananas to make this recipe.  My niece asked for it also!  This recipe is a winner!

This recipe is delicious. I did use 1/2  the sugar and some cinnamon and it was still very sweet. Very good and they came right out of the silicone backing cups.

Just ok. Nothing special and would not make again. I even increased the coffee to 4T and still did not feel that the  coffee flavor came through that well.

Some of the alterations I made are: I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of sweetened applesauce, 1 Tbs of regular and 1Tbs of decaf instant coffee dissolved in 1.5 Tbs water, 1 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I added a small handful of slivered almonds. Before I added the chocolate chips and almonds, I stirred them in a little flour so they wouldn't fall to the bottom of the muffins. I used a blender for the first part but the flour wasn't mixing in it, so I poured the liquid into the flour and stirred the rest by hand. I made 18 regular sized muffins and took them out after 22-23 minutes. They are so moist and I really like the flavor. I will make these again.

I scaled to 30 servings because I had 5 bananas to use up. I halved the margarine and sugar. Doubled the coffee granules and dissolved it in hot espresso. I changed the leavening to 1 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp baking soda to each cup of flour used. I used Robing Hood Whole Wheat and Flax Omega 3 flour for the all purpose.  I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to make it more like a cappuccino banana muffin, used dark chocolate chips as well. My #50 scoop made 30 muffins, which baked in 25 minutes at 375 degrees. Nice change from regular banana muffins, but even with doubling the coffee flavour is not at all evident.

These are by far my favorite muffins and so easy to make. I make them in mini muffin pans. I alter the recipe a little by reducing the sugar by about a half cup because the choco chips are so sweet.

Loved these!  I used one packet of Starbucks Via Instant Coffee (not quite a tablespoon, but plenty strong).  Kids loved them too.  My husband does not like coffee and I didn't tell him they were "mocha" muffins...and he didn't even notice ;-)  Will definitely make again.  The only changes made were the Starbucks instant and I used butter in place of margarine.

Super moist, loved this recipe.  I started another review, but it disappeared before I finished it. 
The only thing I changed, was the instant coffee. We don't buy instant. So, I took 1 tablespoon of our morning coffee already brewed and added.  
L*O*V*E this recipe. Thank you!!!

These were great! I did make some changes, though. As per other reviewers' suggestions, I tripled the amount of coffee, and I'm glad I did, as it tastes just right and probably wouldn't have been strong enough otherwise. I also decreased the sugar to 1 cup and used brown instead of white, and added a couple spoonfuls of ground flax seed to the flour. I used coconut oil instead of margarine (and only half the amount), plus I added a couple extra bananas. The batter was so stiff it was hard to stir (like the consistency of cookie dough), so I might try adding a little milk or more water next time.

Wow. These are great! I took the advice of some others to make them a bit healthier - substituting apple sauce for half of the butter,  wheat flour for half of the flour  and adding some flax seed - and increasing to 4T of instant coffee. The flavor was deep and complex and they were very moist. I will definitely make these again!!

My daughter was looking to make a really good banana chocolate chip muffin. This recipe fit the bill. We omitted the ground coffee, but kept the water so as not to change the amount of liquid. The muffins were so moist. Definitely making these again. (Maybe with the coffee next time for her mocha-loving mom)

1 cup unsweetened applesauce

They are moist enough but need more flavor. Next time add more coffee!

These were delicious!  So moist and easy. 
I got 22 muffins out of the recipe; perfect.
I used 1 tbsp of regular coffee because I didn't have instant.
I sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking.
I will definitely make them again, and instant family favorite!

I followed the recipe and they turned out great.  I was relieved since I had messed up and mixed the sugar in with the flour instead of including it with the butter for the first two minutes.  I did mix them in the food processor so I processed the flour mixture longer.  If you make these, fill cups 1/2-2/3 full for a full size muffin and a little more for bigger tops.  I ended up with 18 good sized muffins.  I will make these again!

Good recipe, but far too sweet for me, even though I only used 1 cup of sugar, and less chocolate chips. I did double the coffee/water as per suggestions, but just not to my taste.  Also added a few chopped pecans on the top. Very moist though. My husband thinks they're great.

Followed recipe but cut back sugar to 3/4 of a cup and chocolate chips 3/4 cup as well.  Didn't do the coffee.   This recipe made 12 muffins for me.  Soft moist, good flavour.  Saved and will make again probably  tweaking a bit more ?.

I had this recipe many years ago. I originally got it from either Family Circle Or Woman's Day magazine. It was one of my "go-to" recipes when I had over-ripe bananas. I am so happy to have it back!

My friend and I have made this review many times, always with success. The only change I make is to slightly reduce the amount of chocolate chips to about 3/4 c. Otherwise, these are perfect. My teen boys love them so much, I usually have to make at least a double batch so they are on hand on the freezer for them. They never last long.

These are THE BEST!  I use a heaping Tbsp (or two) of instant espresso powder and 1/4 c of  butter plus 3/4 c of applesauce.

These are really good. I didn't have any margarine or butter so I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. I increased the instant coffee to 1/4 of a cup and mixed it with 3 Tbsp. of water. I also added 2 tsp. of cocoa powder to the flour.

They tasted great, although they were almost too moist.  I did use a gluten free flour blend because my daughter has celiac disease and that may be why.  I did use the oil/apple sauce combo instead of margarine and used 3 tbsp of coffee.  I may tweak the recipe next time by using less apple sauce or different flour blend.  I will definitely try again, my daughter loved them.

It was really good.. But while it was baking the inside didn't bake as normal muffins did.. Maybe I did something wrong but they didn't bake until they were brown on the top.. But they were delicious.. I added some peanut butter for some taste ??

Followed the recipe
as written except used Heath toffee bits in place of chocolate chips and topped with both pecans and toffee. Doubled the coffee, too, and though we couldn't detect the coffee taste they were excellent!

Fantastic!  Followed this recipe to the tee (I'm a believer that you shouldn't rate a recipe if you didn't follow the recipe as written).  These were super moist and flavorful. I'm a coffee lover, so I think the only change I would make next time is to follow other reviewers' suggestion to use more coffee.  (Also, I always use my Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer for baking and see no need to use a food processor for this recipe.  Just mix together margarine, sugar, and vanilla before adding in other "liquid" ingredients.)

I loved this recipe. The coffee just adds that perfect depth. In fact, my husband hates banana bread with a passion and he liked this one so much he asked for seconds!  I used a mixture of chopped bitter-sweet chocolate, milk chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also baked it in a brownie pan and just allowed it to bake for 45 mins or so. Came out amazing!

I tried a variation based on another review and put a few chocolate chips on the top before baking but they got a little too messy to eat.  The chopped walnuts on top suggestion was good, they gave it the crunch I like.  My husband and I loved these.

And I quote "Wow. (Nomnomnom) Wow. Um, this is reeeeeaaaaly goooood. (Nomnomnom)" Yeah. Thank you for giving my failed chocolate banana popsicles another go before I trashed them!  Aside from the chocolate in the bananas, and reducing the sugar a little, I followed to a T. Thank you! And her mom!

Good recipe. loved by many. I used 1 cup of sugar instead of the 1.25 cups called for and that was wise because it would have been too sweet otherwise. the coffee was simple genius as it enhances the chocolate taste without giving any 'coffee' taste.
Those of you who would like to have a richer coffee/mocha taste would need to add more coffee to the recipe.

Really good recipe. They turned out really moist and yet fluffy on the inside, and tastes so much better than the ones we get from bakeries!  Amount of bananas is just right but I find it a little too sweet for my family's liking. I reduced the sugar to only 170g and it was great. Halfed the amount of chocolate (used bittersweet instead) and for the other half, I substituted with pecans instead. Just make sure not to overmix as it will render the muffins too dense. I mixed everything using a non-electric hand whisk instead as I feel I can control the amount of mixing better. Just make sure to stop mixing when everything just combines. This is definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe. I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cuop brown sugar and 3 tbsp of decaf coffee to 1 tbsp water, as per suggestions from other users. The whole family loves these. I make them as regular size muffins and mini-muffins (baked for 13 - 15 minutes, instead of the full 25 min. for the reg. size muffins).

Love these!  Nice moist crumb and a little firm on the outside.  I used about 1 T + 2 tsp coffee in about 1 1/2 T water.   Also used a slightly rounded 3/4 c sugar. Perfect!

The flavor of these is good - used the tip of 1/4 cup oil and 1 cup applesauce; 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white; 3 tablespoons of coffee granules in 1 tablespoon water; 1/2 cup mini semi sweet chips and 1 cup dark chips.  Removed banana mix from processor and stirred in the flour mix and chips by hand gently.  However, these stuck to the paper liners - I always spray my liners with cooking spray but did not this time as no one mentioned an issue of sticking.  Next time, will spray the liners so we can enjoy the whole muffin. . .

Delicious! I made 36 muffins and used 1 cup of butter, 8 large bananas, 1.5 pkgs of chocolate chips & used pastry flour instead of all-purpose. The muffins turned out very moist and incredibly tasting. Unfortunately, I didn't have instant coffee so I skipped out on that one.

I made a few adjustments only because of some of the other reviews I read and what I had on hand. I used the full cup of margarine (cause I had it which is rare), up'd the instant coffee to 3T and 3t of water, used only 1 cup of sugar (white) and used 4 bananas instead of 3 cause what was I going to do with the last banana all by itself! Anyway, this recipe generated 24 mini muffins (cooked for 15 minutes at 350 = perfect) and 12 regular size muffins (cooked for the 25 min at 350 that the recipe called for). Yummy and moist while they are hot and I am assuming they will be just as good once they cool down!

Really good!  Soft, moist and very flavorful.  I thought the 1 tablespoon of instant coffee was just right.  Will make again.

Very good.  I left out the coffee as my family really doesn't like it and they tasted great.  I increased the recipe as I wanted to make 24 but ended up having way too much batter.  If you want 24 I think this recipe for 18 servings would be enough.  Cooking time is dead on at 25 minutes.

I followed the recipe using butter instead of margarine and used my stand mixer rather than putting all ingredients in a food processor (not sure the reason for that). They turned out great...moist and delicious! Next time I would add more coffee though as that flavor wasn't very pronounced.

As someone who doesn't like coffee, I hesitate many times making this recipe.  But whenever I searched for banana muffin recipes, this one was at the top of the list.  And now I know why!!!  These are possible THE best muffins I've ever tasted.  And I'm no scientist, but I'm sure it's because of the processor!  Not only does that make them super easy, but they are also super awesome.  Try them today with your brown spotty bananas!

I feel like I'm being a little generous by giving this recipe four stars..The muffin tastes exactly like banana bread, which I guess is to be a little expected, but I honestly could have found a better banana bread recipe. I didn't even get a hint of coffee and I put about 5 tbsps of already-brewed coffee in it. The muffin itself is attractive, but that wasn't really what I cared about. I took other peoples advice and did a combo of white and brown sugar; also I used only butter. ALSO (this was a big deal breaker for me) the dough was SO thick! My food processor was too small for all the ingredients so at the point of adding flour and such I started mixing by hand; before adding flour, the butter was nasty looking (which I guess could be my fault) and it was such a turn off. After adding all the ingredients I decided to let it sit in the fridge for a few hours, however I became occupied and I ended up baking them the next day. The dough didn't get any less thick but they did bake well. I won't be making these again, which saddens me for I had high hopes for this recipe.

Out of this world.  I'm not a big fan of banana/chocolate, but I tried these because my husband enjoys banana/chocolate chip muffins.  There's something about the coffee... it's subtle, but it really "joins" the banana and chocolate.  It tones down the tangy banana and enhances the chocolate.  I'm definitely making these again, perhaps adding more coffee.  And I used mini chocolate chips (as I often do in baking) to distribute the chocolate better.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Baking the muffins went by really fast and it was really fun. I never baked muffins before so it was a first experience for me. The things that went well was making the lab plan and following it. The procedure was really clear and easy to follow. The outcome of the muffin was really similar to the pictures on recipe.com. The thing we forgot to do was read the materials because we ended up needing a food processor but didn't have one so we had to improvise and use a different mixer. Something I would do differently is change the amount of bananas because using two made it taste like straight up banana. The final product looked like an actual muffin, and it mushroomed up. I would recommend this to anybody who wants to try new things or likes bananas because this fits right in, and it is really fun to make and watch it bloom in the oven.

Wonderful muffin recipe. This recipe is really good and easy to follow. If I will do it again I will change the banana to strawberry or any other fruits that fit in. according to the recipe it should end up in 10 muffins but it end up with 12 muffins in total. We did not use the food processor but the muffin still look good and taste great.Try not to put too much banana it will ruin the muffin.  I will recommend thin muffin to any person especially for those know how to bake it. Not only is this recipe easy to follow but the muffin taste great too.

Really good muffins.  I (roughly) tripled the batch and used part butternut squash puree and part banana.  I could really cut back on the butter this way because the squash keeps the muffins super moist and tasty.  Used whole wheat flour and couldn't taste the coffee, but it didn't really matter too much as they were still delicious.  I never completely follow a muffin recipe (usually because they're such an easy thing to "healthify" and throw some extra nutrition into), but this one turned out superb and my TRIPLE batch was gone in three days.  Can't keep up with my four boys....

These muffins turned out really flavorful and moist for me.  I used 6 Starbucks Via Blonde in 3T water (probably about 1 too many), which is why they turned out so dark in color. Also, I substituted all of the sugar with Splenda, used half the chocolate chips, and added chopped walnuts.  The Splenda package says cooking times may be shortened.  Baked them in paper-lined foil cups for about 15 minutes max.

Delicious!  I made this, substituted non sweetened applesauce for the butter, one cup of sugar instead of one and a quarter cup. Didn't have granulated coffee, put two tablespoons of brewed, couldn't taste the coffee, but my family loved them. Very moist.  Easy to put together, this recipe is a keeper.

Fantastic recipe! Perfect amount of banana (i used 3 large bananas), perfect amount of chocolate chips and very nice and moist! I would reduce the sugar by just a bit (maybe by a 1/4 cup) and add more coffee (I did 3 table spoons of regular coffee - will up that to 5). Even though I think it needs a couple modifications I will keep this rating at 5 star because they are still really good as is and I just want to tweek it to suit my taste buds.

This recipe was perfect to whip up when I had free time and made exactly 18 muffins for me! I followed the recipe but added about 2.5 T coffee with water, that's about all I had. I can't taste it much though, unfortunately. I only used 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. I also used about 1/2 tsp more vanilla as well. Overall, they turned out great but next time I think I'll use applesauce in place of some of the margarine for something different.

I have to start by saying that I hate coffee and all things coffee flavoured, so I have not personally eaten any of these muffins. That said, there were 19 of them when I made them this afternoon, and I am down to 10. I think that speaks for itself, and I plan on making another batch tomorrow!

I do not think it's fair to rate this recipe as written because I followed the advice of other reviewers and changed the recipe a bit.  I reduced the sugar and used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown, substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup of margarine and used 1/2 c. butter instead of margarine.  I also used 3 Tbls of fresh-brewed strong coffee as I do not have any instant.  Just before baking, I added a mix of chocolate chips and crushed pecans to the top of the muffins.  They were delicious! Moist and tasty.  The coffee flavor was mild, to say the least, but still a tasty recipe.  Again, I cannot comment on the recipe as written, but with the suggestions mentioned, this recipe is a keeper!

Ok, so I wasn't brave enough to make with the coffee, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written and these are to die for!! This will be my new go to muffin recipe.  This was the most velvety batter I ever worked with!  So good, I should have made two batches.

These are delicious!  I did make a minor adjustment though,  I only put 1 cup of sugar (after reading the too sweet reviews) and I used just over 1 cup of mushed bananas (is that 3 bananas?).  Next time I might up the coffee a little to make the mocha flavour a little more obvious.  Thanks for sharing!!

These are some of the best muffins I have ever made!  I cut the recipe down to 12 and made 6 jumbo muffins which i baked a few minutes longer than the normal size.  I usd butter instead of margarine becuase I didn't have the margarine and instant espresso instead of coffee. I would recommend these to anyone rather they like coffee or not as the coffee adds richness not so much bitterness that often is associated with it.  Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy.  I followed what other reviewers suggested: used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 butter instead of margarine; used only 1 cup of sugar, and 3 tablespoon of coffee in 2 tablespoon of water.  My only regret is that 3 tablespoons of coffee kind of over-powers the banana.  Will definitely make again, but with 2 tablespoon of coffee.

Would have given 5 stars but I had to make some adjustments as the previous reviewers suggested. I reduced the amount of sugar down a little bit and used half white half brown sugar. The second time I left bananas out and I think I liked them better. I added in 1 shot of brewed espresso instead of using instant coffee. My best friend had two muffins in one go and took another two more home LOL.

They even have a good flavor and texture (albeit chewier) without the banana.

Just made these, but i only had 1 cup of all purpose flour, so i substituted with an extra 1 1/4 cup of cake and pastry flour, and used a little less of the baking powder and soda. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. It turned out AMAZINGG! The only thing was that it was a tad bit too sweet for me, so i might reduce it to 1 cup of sugar next time.

I love them! I used 3 tbsp coffee in 2 tbsp water. I also used 1/2 cup oil instead of 1 cup margarine. I used Hershey's dark chocolate chips. They came out super moist and irresistable!

One of the BEST muffin recipes ever! I stuck a Nestle chocolate melt ontop of each to give them an extra chocolate hit ;) Will try adding more coffee next time.

These muffins were real easy to make and very moist and delicious.  I had read some reviews before making it so I doubled the amount of instant coffee to 2 TBS but felt that still wasn't enough.  I couldn't tast the coffee flavor at all so next time I make these I might increase to 4 TBS.  They still tasted like very yummy banana muffins just not enough coffee flavor if you follow the recipe to the tee.

These are good banana muffins, great texture and flavor.  I was disappointed that I couldn't really taste the coffee.  Like another reviewer did, I used Kaluha (mocha flavor) instead of the water.  If I make these again, I think I will increase the coffee to 2 Tbsp. and use the Kaluha.  My husband took these to his office and they were a huge hit!

Good recipe. It's just that I am not too crazy with the Chocolate chips. It makes them way too sweet. I think it will taste better without that.

I added in extra coffee per other reviews. I didn't have any chocolate, but I think they are needed. Great muffins, but my lack of sweets in the pantry made a difference. Next time chocolate or nuts will be added.

These are really yummy chocolate-banana muffins but don't let the 'mocha' part get you too excited. There was no coffee flavor in these moist treats. These are really yummy despite the misleading title. Give them a try!

Good, but not spectacular, it's hard to taste the banana when it's all ground. I would certainly reduce the oil to half a cup and use 1/4 - 1/2 cup less sugar. More is just not necessary.

Funtastic and me-proof! It was a sleepy after-going-out morning and I managed to make all the possible mistakes with the recipe and still it was very tasty! I used 3 Tbsp coffee dissolved in 2 Tbsp water which for a change wasn't a mistake.

Fantastic! I mostly work from home, but go to the office occasionally to stay in touch with the folks there. Made these muffins this morning and took them along - they were a huge hit and gone within minutes (my boss ate three!! - smile). Suddenly, all was quiet and the only sound I could hear was mmmmmm... mmmmmmm... mmmmmm... Seriously! :-)
Thanks for sharing! PS I did use only half the butter and 20% less sugar.

I made this for my kids and they loved them.  I left out the coffee so it'd be more kid friendly.  I have also made it using applesauce in place of 1/2 of the margarine.  I use 1/2 whole wheat flour and add 1 T wheat germ for added nutrition.

I made the muffins exactly as instructed. I did puree the banana, egg, and vanilla first before adding to the other dry ingredients, which I then handmixed. They looked great in the oven, rose nicely. But, as soon as we took them out, they fell! Im thinking that next time I will reduce the amount of butter, and possibly add a touch more flour. The taste, however, was incredible! We used milk chocolate also, which was even more creamy!!

I rated these before with 5 stars but after eating a few I decided I would really like these better without the coffee and the chocolate chips.  The muffins are really moist so they make a wonderful recipe for banana nut muffins.  They don't rise very much so I'd also fill up the cups more next time to make them more jumbo size.

Very good but not the best. We prefer different flavours of muffins, but I think I will make it again.

I just had to try the recipe after all the great reviews... glad I did.  I followed someone's suggestion about using a 9"x13" pan.  Worked really well, just had to bake a few minutes longer.  I also added a handful of chips on top of the mix before I baked.  This was unbelieveably moist.  Didn't even add the coffee.

It so moist and yummy! My sister and boyfriend love it! I did decrease the amount of butter by a little and it's still too wet. I will try to cut down on the butter next time. Will definitely do it again!

WOW! After reading other reviews I made this recipe with some healthy substitutions. To cut the fat, I used 4 Tbs Margarine and 3/4 cup apple sauce. Instead of white flour, I used whole wheat. Additionally I substituted the sugar with 1 cup of splenda for baking. The muffins came out moist and very sweet. Probably too much splenda, however my sweet tooth enjoyed! Best when hot out of the oven. Thanks for a great recipe!

I would've given this a 5 star, but you can't really taste the coffee.  I was hoping for a stronger flavor.  And I used 3 T. of fresh brewed, strong coffee, which was more than the recipe called for.  Still, a yummy muffin.  I also sub'ed 1/2 splenda for 1/2 the sugar, and also did 1/2 white and dark choc chips.  Very yummy!

I made this in a 9x13 inch cake pan.  It turned out great, only like some others said, the coffee taste was over-powered by banana.   It still tastes good though and my family is not crazy about coffee anyway.  I did add 1 cup of chopped walnuts for a little crunch :-)

These were very tasty, I followed some others' advice and added 3 T. coffee granules. Still not very mocha-flavored, but delicious and moist.

I can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe! These muffins are the best we have ever tasted! I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and I also cut the margarine by 1/2. I use the mini chocolate chips and 4 very ripe bananas and I made 18 nice sized muffins. I gave this recipe to my sister in law, who is a fabulous cook and never gets excited about any recipe I give her -- until now!Try these and they will become your favorite also!

This was a great recipe.  Even though I changed the instant coffee to Espresso I still couldn't really taste the Mocha in it but that was okay.  Made 16 nice breakfast muffins which my husbands employees loved!! Thanks you so much for passing this great recipe on..anymore you want to share?

These were excellent!  I didn't have instant coffee on hand, so I poured in about an ounce of espresso coffee instead, which worked out well.  I made mini-muffins, so I only baked them for 18 minutes (convection oven) and they turned out moist and delicious.  Will definitely make these again and again.

Surprisingly light muffins. Delicious! I think I might try them with mini chocolate chips next time as I made my muffins smaller and got 2 dozen out of the recipe. These were amazing though!

You won't need another banana chocolate chip muffin recipe.  Don't know if they're the best muffins ever, but these are good.  Made by hand; mixed the first batch of ingredients with a fork and then stirred in the flour batch.  (Mashed the bananas first, of course.)  Only complaint is that I got a chunk of coffee flavour here and there, maybe dissolve the granules in a bit more water.  Used 3/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 peanut butter chips - peanut butter and banana - mmm.  Butter instead of margarine due to what was on hand.

This was a great recipe! So simple to make and the muffins were moist and delicious. I always reduce the sugar on recipes, though -- and I found 3/4 cup of sugar with the bananas and chocolate chips quite sweet enough.

These are fantastic!!! If you don't have a food processor DON'T use a blender like I did. What a mess; it doesn't work. Use an electric mixer. I used 1 cup sugar like others suggested. You won't miss the extra 1/4 cup. I also added an extra tablespoon of coffee like others suggested.
Thanks for such a fantastic recipe. This is a real keeper.

I was so excited to make these because I love banana bread and chocolate chips but I thought they were just okay.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup, and the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup (with a few sprinkled on top).  I also doubled the coffee but still couldn't taste it.  They were moist but I don't think the flavor is that great.

These muffins were so delicious!
The coffee flavouring adds so much to this moist muffin!  The only problem is trying to stop eating them!!!

These were really good.  I used a Tbs. of coffee, half whole wheat flour and a repaced half the margerine with applesauce.  I still really couldn't taste the mocha, but my husband said he could.

The flavour combination of coffee/chocolate/banana was fantastic but the muffins were a little dry.
