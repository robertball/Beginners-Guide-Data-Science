I had searched for a recipe for chicken croquettes. I remember Them from my childhood. This was pretty close tastewise.  Made the white sauce thick , added the minced cooked chicken and some of  the spices. No cayenne. Rolled into cylinders, bread crumbs and fried up.  Served with  mashed potatoes and homemade chicken gravy with homemade peasant bread. That will do.

OK, I did make a couple changes to this.  I didn't add the nutmeg or cayenne and added 2 cups of milk instead of 2.5.  I silly enough didn't take his advice on the food processor...I DID use one for the chicken and while it made it SOOOO much easier, I should've gone for the  chopped chicken.  Regardless of what I did to the recipe, everyone LOVED it!  I will be making it again and probably will keep changing it as I go but, this is a great base recipe.

More time and work that you'd think, but they are impressive. I fried in an inch or so of oil in a pot, using an infrared thermometer to make sure the temp was right. They are just as good put in the fridge and fried the next day. It makes enough for 4 people, so 1/2 the batch are getting frozen. Chef John's 'real aoili' was great with these, but super difficult to make. See his recipe for Crispy Pork Cutlets for some breading tips that could apply to this recipe.

Gave them a four because I haven't tried them yet.
They look great!
I'm going to try them in the air-fryer.
I think they would be better this way, creamy instead of dry.
It is better to have more gravy in chicken pie than have it dry, so why not the same with croquettes?

I had never heard of these before, let alone made or ate them.  They are delicious!  I did reduce the butter to 6T and  1 2/3 milk (buttermilk) as Chef John suggested.
