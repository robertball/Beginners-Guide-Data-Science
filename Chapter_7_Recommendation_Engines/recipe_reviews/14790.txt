My husband really liked this recipe.  One thing to note is the cooking time is WAY off.  You are cooking it in a pan - no way will it take 55 minutes.  I think I cooked it for 20-25 because I was trying to follow the recipe, but even that was a bit too long.  That was his one complaint.  I also kept checking the internal temp and it never reached 160, but it was definitely still cooked!

I would give this a 5+ if I could - this was delicious and so very tender (and EASY!!), and went over VERY well for dinner! I used pork tenderloin, and tripled the recipe (but really should have only doubled it.) I would have used garlic salt instead of regular salt next time for a little more of a garlic flavor. I used minced garlic to rub into the pork. The flavor was absolutely wonderful! I served this with garlic mashed potatoes, rolls, salad and 2 kinds of vegetables. I also thickened the sauce to use as gravy for serving. Thank you for the recipe!

The pork came out soooooooo tender!!! I only used a 1/2 cup of the wine, maybe that was a mistake.  It was missing something for our tastes. Not sure how, but I am going to play around with this recipe next time I make it.

I used red wine, as i had it on hand and prefer it, and the dish turned out beautifully. I removed the roast after fully cooked, and reduced the "liquids" down with a little cornstarch and made a delicious gravy to serve with mashed red potatoes. A little fresh ground pepper, and it was wonderful (and i do not even like pork :)

I sliced my pork tenderloin into medallions, and marinated it in minced fresh garlic and a little olive oil for about 6 hours. It turned out super tender, and the flavor was pretty good, but if I were to make it again I would add some fresh oregano and/or thyme. Served it with asparagus and baby red potatoes. Good stuff. Thanks, Pietra!

I loved the flavor and I had the butcher tenderize the pork so they were very tender the only problem was that they seemed a little dry.  I donlt know whether I over cooked them.  I will definitely make this again but I would like to figure out what I did wrong.

We cooked it on the BBQ on low heat and it was extremely tender and delicious.

This was allright but it was lacking that "wow" factor. I used a pork tenderloin, I cut lots of little slits that I inserted slivers of garlic in (in addition to rubbing the minced garlic over the outside of the pork), added lots of thyme & some cilantro. The wine I used was a good pinot grigio. Not sure why thsi was a little boring ... the pork was juicy & not dry though. Served it w/ smashed potatoes & a fresh salad.

Not bad.  Going to try it in the slow cooker next time, I think it will come out better.

Used pork tenderloin. Followed recipe as-is until the actual cooking. Make sure the pan is SUPER hot when you drop the meat in. It WILL smoke so open windows and be prepared for the fire alarm to go off. Cooked for exactly 22 minutes, took the meat out of the liquids and let it rest for 10 minutes. Spooned cooking liquids onto the meat when served and it was truly delicious. If you want more garlic flavor, slice up an additional clove of garlic and add it with the wine and chicken stock. We served with roasted red potatoes and asparagus. So good!!

I took the advice of one reviewer above and added garlic salt as my "salt to taste" and this is superb!  The method of cooking keeps it moist and cooks perfectly.  I think we only went about 45 minutes also!  This is a keeper! Thanks

Was looking for a pork tapas recipe, so cut and pounded boneless chops into small cutlets. Sauteed in oil & butter with sliced garlic, simmered in liquid about 25 minutes. Added about a Tbs. of flour to remaining liquid for a delicious gravy. Overall was a bit salty, though I think that may have been me over-seasoning the cutlets in the beginning. Definately will make again!

We liked this one so much I've made it several times now. It's a simple recipe but don't let that fool you. While it is easy, it's flavorful. I used thin pork chops, making 50-55 minutes is too long.

This was pretty good - the pork turned out nice and tender. Good recipe!
