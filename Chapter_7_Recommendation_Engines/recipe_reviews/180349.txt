Let me start by saying part of what makes this salad delicious is using a brie or camabert pair with the apples.  It is I great combination.  I realize it a little difficult to work with but so worth it.  What I do is to cut the wheel into quarters and the just pinch small pieces of cheese with your fingers and drop it onto the salad.  That way your not getting any of the rind, which can be tough or bitter, and you are not trying to battle with a knife & soft cheese.  Whew, I feel better now.  This is definitely a five star.  I used Sesame Ginger dressing (newmans) and it paired great with the ingredients.  Thanks for the post!

What a treat. And it is so pretty on the table. I have never used Brie cheese so that was an adventure. I found it very similar to cream cheese. I'm not sure I like the gooey-ness of the Brie on the salad. The rest of the salad was a sure hit with the family. It was light, not over powering and just very enjoyable. I used Blasamic Vinegrette Spritzer dressing. I made the salad a second time later in the week and with the few changes I made, it goes to the head of my recipe bos. I used fresh Mozzarella cheese slices and toasted pecans and macadamian nuts. I especially like the lightness of the dressing. This will show up at our table often and I would have no problem at all serving it to guests. I highly recommend this salad.

This salad was enjoyable and a nice switch up from the norm. I tossed my apples in a bit of lemon to keep them from getting brown. Next time I will probably use a little less vinegar, since my greens were sort of swimming in it.  While toasting the walnuts I added a few tsps of sugar and really enjoyed the sweet taste with the tang of the vinegar and tartness of the apples.   Also added a few more walnuts than the recipe called for and didn't use all of the apples, but that is just personal taste.  For sure a salad that I  would serve to guests.

This simple salad compares favorably with a similar one I had at an upscale steakhouse.  The ingredients are well-balanced, and each of them brings something unique to the party.  I splurged and used some cherry balsamic vinegarette that I had been saving.  It was well worth it!  I would definitely serve this salad to guests.

I gave it 4 stars as is, but the second time I made it I used a maple vinagrette, and added some crisp bacon crumbled.  I could have eaten the whole salad with a loaf of fresh crusty bread! That was a 5 star upgrade!

Easy and lovely salad! I changed the amount of balsamic vinaigrette, as I found  1/2 cup too much, so I added only 1/4 cup and it was just the right amount for our taste. Instead I added more brie and toasted walnuts. I recommend it to everyone!

What a wonderful fall salad! I made this with dried cranberries in it as well, and it was equally delicious! It's a wonderful salad to serve when impressing company for dinner! :)

Awesome salad! I tossed my apples with a little lemon (brown apples are not pretty). I also made my own balsamic vinaigrette. I prefer to cut the rind off brie whenever I use it in a salad. I love this and will be making again.

Definitely worth trying, changing proportions to suit personal taste. A visually pleasing salad, the taste was very much dependent on the vinaigrette used. I chose the All Recipes' sweet & tangy Honey~Balsamic Vinaigrette (adding only 4 extra tsp. of oil to that). Because the dressing asked for was double the needed quantity, I can only give this salad 3 stars, as written; a small puddle of dressing remained even after halving it. I sliced thinly only 1 Gala apple, cutting the slices in thirds for ease of eating; proportionately, that was enough for the 5 c. baby lettuces used. The quantities of Brie (1/2 c.) & toasted walnuts (1/3 c.) remained the same as recipe called for; these provided a nice taste & texture contrast in the salad.

Yummy! I do not like salad that is coated with dressing so I did not coat the apples and then the greens with the vinaigrette, but that is a personal preference. I used the balsamic vinaigrette spritzer dressing. I also did as another reviewer and toasted the nuts with a little bit of sugar. I used pecans because I have a ton of them. Very tasty salad and I would probably serve to guests. Thanks.

This was a good salad. I used pear infused white balsamic vinegar, added some olive oil and a little splenda.

This was a good salad. I threw the brie in the freezer for a bit before chopping it, as some of the other reviews warned that it is a bit hard to handle when warmer. Left the rind on as well. Used green apples and spring mix and it turned out nicely. A salad is only as good as the dressing, in many cases though, so make sure you use a vinigrette you know and love. I was in a pinch so used Wishbone, but I like my homemade version much better. Might even recommend just using a nice syrupy aged balsamic with a splash of olive oil.

I thought the brie in this was way overpowering. A different cheese selection may be ok. I purchased an "Emeril's" bottle of balsamic vinaigrette which was great. Surprisingly, I found that this salad actually tasted better the next day... I think over time, the vinaigrette mellowed out the cheese. Served the second day with grilled shrimp and veggies on top, it actually wasn't too bad.

I give this a 3 star rating, but possibly because I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used the brie, roasted walnuts and apples, which went wonderfully together and paired it with a store bought balsamie vinaigrette. I think the dressing was awful with this combination. Next time I will use a different dressing and will toss the apples and everything in the dressing before putting them on the salad bed. I loved everything about this recipe but poor choice, in my opinion, on the dressing. My husband did not even finish his dinner- which is not a good sign :(

I really enjoyed the appearance of this salad.  I used pecans instead of walnuts (allergy,) and Kraft Light Balsamic Vinaigrette which I eyeballed instead of measured.  I probably used only 1/8 of a cup.  I had only had Brie a couple of times one from a French teacher, and once at the Louvre in France, so I'm not exactly an expert on it, I didn't like working with it as a cheese on a salad, it was difficult to "slice" and got gooey the more you worked with it.  I think fresh mozzarella would be better.  This was an easy quick salad to make, and I might make variations of it later.

I cut back on  the apple using only 1 small one and added a handful of  dried cranberries.  First time I used Brie and the next time I used Feta.  We liked the feta better as the brie kind of got lost in the salad.  I also used the  Honey Balsamic vinaigrette recipe on here with this salad.  Delicious!!

This is a classic brie salad recipe, but unfortunately I was very disappointed in it. The amount of vinegar required in the recipe is way too much and it becomes overpowering in the salad and colours the apples brown. The actual ingredients are great and if not for the vinegar, this would make a great salad. The only problem is that it isn't very easy to take with and is better prepared for eating soon.

Very nice.  I would try it with a nice poppy seed dressing as well.  I think that would pair well with the other ingredients.

This salad was a hit!.. I ate more of this than the other courses... Since you have a dressing option here, I picked another dressing from a recipe on this site and it was WONDERFUL (Deliciously Sweet Salad with Maple, nuts, etc..)  I used about 4 string mozzarella sticks instead of the brie and it was great!.. I will make this often!..
