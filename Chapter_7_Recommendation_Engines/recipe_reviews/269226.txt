Very nice recipe - ingredients are easy to substitute if needed. I love the pasta! I hadn’t ever made it before.

Great basic recipe.  Easy to adapt to your taste preferences.  I used Polish sausage because that's what I had, and used light cream cheese, along with subbing evaporated milk for the half and half.  If you don't like mushrooms it's easy to use another veg such as chopped bell peppers, broccoli, etc.  This is a keeper.

On 5/23/19 I made this again.  This time I added some sliced zucchini and yellow squash that I kept firm since we prefer veggies that way.  I also cut some calories by using 2% milk.  With all the cheese, olive oil and butter, it still tasted rich.  It was excellent and since I like having one pot meals, this will remain a keeper.  Next time I might try with some shrimp.

This is change of pace. I used the pappardelle pasta, but believe fettuccine or linguine could be used with good outcomes. It’s easy enough to put together, but I don’t think extra salt is needed (especially if pesto is used). I used the turkey smoked sausage and fat free half & half to lighten it up. tasty recipe!

This was AWESOME. I was very iffy on giving it to my kids but both asked for seconds. The pesto and sausage added great flavor to an otherwise normal creamy pasta dish. Paired with the garlic and basil, it was delicious. I omitted the mushrooms as I'm the only one who would eat them. I was asked to please incorporate this into our monthly dinner rotations!

This was really very yummy---and rich!  It will make a nice dish to go with a garden salad.  I didn't have the fresh basil, but it was really delicious even with a sprinkling of dried basil.  I would definitely advise you to keep some of the pasta water because the sauce does get quite thick.  Our bellies are very happy tonight!  We loved the smoked sausage!  Thanks, Hillshire Farms!

This is such an easy and delicious dish. I've always been wary of making my own alfredo sauce as I can never quite seem to get it right.  This alfredo sauce, though, was incredibly easy, fast and is absolutely amazing. I followed the directions mostly, however I had to sub 1/4 cup of half and half with milk (I ran out), and I used minced garlic instead of fresh. I also used some of the reserved pasta water to thin the sauce slightly. This sauce recipe will be my go-to sauce for alfredo in the future. It made plenty for my family of four, and I will definitely be making this again!

I made it as is. Perfectly fine and tasty. Perhaps doubling the sauce. Maybe 1/4 teaspoon pepper instead of 1/2 teaspoon. Otherwise. Delicious.

Way too rich!! Used 1/4 of the pesto the recipe called for. Didn’t make sense to cook the pasta first as it made it difficult to mix it all together afterwards.

This seemed bland to me.  My guest liked it (or they were just being nice).  I added zucchini and squash but not the pesto.

Definitely a keeper. Be prepared to thin the sauce. The ingredients are so rich I decided not to use pesto like the other reviews. And it was a good call. No need for pesto, and probably even a little less basil. Delicious!

Tasted very salty the night I made it and it seemed like too many flavors overall with the pesto. The leftovers I committed to pack in my lunch the next few days were delicious- no pesto on the leftovers and the smokey, not salty  taste of the sausage was delicious. Cream sauce really held up to microwave reheating.

My family enjoyed this.  I did not add the pesto because I thought it would be too much basil taste but otherwise followed the recipe.  Will make again.

I used linguine noodles instead of pappardelle  and I used baby bella mushrooms instead of cremini. However, it turned out  very well. My children absolutely loved it and asked me to make it again the next day.

Pasta dishes are yummy comfort food and this one scores! I used linguini and didn’t add the pasta to the sauce choosing to spoon it over the pasta instead. Since I’m cooking for one, doing that is better if you have leftovers.

I’m not a big sausage lover but this was delicious!  I’m going to experiment with Italian sausage next time.  Also want to use the base sauce for a chicken version.

I followed the recipe except I only used one clove of garlic.  It was delicious  my family loved it. I will make it again only next time I will use sweet Italian sausage in lieu of the smoked sausage.

Easy, I didn’t have a pesto so just topped with parm and fresh basil. Really good fast supper.
