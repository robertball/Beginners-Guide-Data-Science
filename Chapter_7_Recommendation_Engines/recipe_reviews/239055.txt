I really enjoyed this recipe. Maple and salmon, it's like a match made in heaven.  I made it exactly as written. I did, however, cut and individually wrap the salmon pieces. I grilled them over medium heat for 5 mins per side, then I moved them over to indirect heat for the remaining 5 mins - total of 15 mins.  Next time I will only grill for 10-12 mins. While there is nothing "smokey" about this recipe, it is very tasty and I will definitely make it again.  One pound of salmon for 2 people makes VERY generous servings. I prefer to cut a pound into 3-4 pieces. Also, no need to oil grate (!?) since the salmon is not directly on grate. Thank you, wendi!

This was so delicious!!!! I made it as close to the instructions as possible, but did not have the ingredients for the creole seasoning, so I used Old Bay seasoning instead, nor did I combine the seasoning with the syrup, instead I put the seasoning on the salmon then drizzled the syrup (which was butter flavored) on along with some hickory smoked liquid, then put less on than a tablespoon of butter for both cuts, wrapped in foil and cooked it on my electric BBQ for 20 minutes in between 350-375! It was perfect!!! Made broccoli cheddar rice and green beans! Will defiantly keep this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

The whole family loved it. Even my wife liked it and she doesn't like salmon. I was concerned it would be too spicy for my daughter, but it wasn't. Next time I would add more creole seasoning to increase the kick.

Totally pleased all. Meat and potato guys as well as  lighter fare ladies in our house. Served it with some Bosc pears w cinnamon, croissants and asparagus. My first review because I never get all three volunteering enthusiastic compliments. So quick & easy to make and clean up after! Entering regular rotation.

Really good and very simple.  Not only will I make it again, but I will try it with things other than salmon such as chicken and pork chops.
