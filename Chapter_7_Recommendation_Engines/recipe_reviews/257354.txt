I liked them, We ( my mom and I) baked them in the conventional oven and they turned out pretty good.  I would make them again.

This recipe is fantastic! My husband isn't a big fan of sweet potato fries, but the sweet and spicy flavor of this recipe was amazing! He ate all of it and wanted more!

These were very tasty. I baked them for an extra five minutes. They still werenâ€™t crispy but they were a good texture.

This is an easy healthy lunch, dinner or snack. I cut them into rounds or chips rather than fries cuz i 
Have more control over their thickness but thats the only thing i do differently. Really good recipie!!

I would bake these longer the next time. I liked the flavor, but not the texture - too soft.  Also, I didn't have paprika so substituted Cayenne powder though not as much. Gave it a kick!

These were great. We hate sweet seasonings on sweet potatoes but these savory spiced ones were great. Most of mine were floppy so next time I'll bake them on a cookie rack in the sheet pan so they can maybe do less steaming. I did a regular potato with these and its texture was crisp so I think sweet potatoes must be wetter inside. These were a hit, my 4yo ate 3 fries and that's amazing considering how much she hates potatoes! Thanks!

We need a new rating system because these need 10 stars!! OMG these are so good. I ate all of them. Myself. I cut them with a spiralizer and cooked them in an airfryer. I used Franks wing sauce for the hot sauce on one potato and Sriracha on the second, cooking in two separate batches. Both were amazingly good. I served them with McCormick's Utah Fry Sauce. Yum! Thank you magpie005 You Rock!
