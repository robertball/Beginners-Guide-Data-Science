This dish had a nice flavor -- I liked the citrus with a kick of spice. I added mushrooms and snow peas. Next time, I will thicken the sauce a little to help it cling to the noodles.

This is an extremely flavorful and delicious dish.  I found it simple to prepare and all of the ingredients are easy to find. I loved the mandarin oranges, which add just the right zest to make this special.  It's a keeper!

I thought it was quite tasty. It was a little strange with the warm mandarin oranges, but I like the orange flavor. I omitted the red pepper, however, because I don't like spicy foods that much. The sauce was rather watery. Maybe a little cornstarch would help?
