Delicious! I used Fire Roasted Rotel. I think next time we will try the spicier one. We also used Turkey Bacon just because I prefer it.

Had fun making these with the grandkids. I used two sun-dried tomato basil tortillas and cutout the top one in the shape of a jack-o'-lantern for the fall season. The grands loved the spiciness of the tomatoes and the bacon was the perfect compliment.

This was a good, simple and tasty quick dinner.  I thought the proportions were spot on.  I did not have fresh basil, so used a sprinkle of dried.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

My sons love this and so do I! I cook the bacon first and then cook the quesadillas in the bacon grease. Obviously, this adds some calories, but it's very tasty. I'm a slow cook and even I can make these quickly.

This is a great, simple recipe!  My children loved it and it is a quick "go to" when you are in a hurry.  Just about any meat will be great with this recipe.
