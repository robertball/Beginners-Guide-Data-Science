My kids loved these but I did make some minor adjustments. I "baked" my potatoes in the microwave instead of the oven. Once scooped I sprayed the potato skins with cooking spray so they would crisp a little when later baking. I needed to add more milk than what was called for to get a creamy and fluffy consistency.  I just added milk  a little at a time until the consistency was correct. I also salted to taste.

These were SO good!  I was licking the bowl and couldn't stop snacking on the filling.  I baked 4 potatoes, took out the filling of all 4, but only used 2 potatoes to fill back up (so that the filling would be nice and thick, piled up high!)  I also threw in a small handful of sharp cheddar cheese after mixing it together.  Oh, I completely forgot to add the butter...it doesn't even need it!  It's so rich from the cream cheese you won't miss it!
You could add additional toppings like bacon and sour cream if you want to go the extra mile, but again, it doesn't even need it!  Tasty!

I made these substituting heavy cream for milk (I had some leftover that I needed to use) and Mascarpone cheese for cream cheeese (again, it's what I had on hand). Simple, easy to make, and absolutely delicious. I love that you don't need a lot of ingredients to make something to incredibly good.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of a sprinkling of about a tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese on top of each.  Sure the filling is creamy, but the taste is about the same as if you added all of those ingredients to a once-baked potato.  I'm not sure it's worth the extra effort.

This was a fantastic recipe for baked potatoes!! I had already used all my cream cheese to make cheesecake so I had to add more milk to make it creamy, about 1/2 cup total. Also for some extreme flavor I added 1 1/2 tbsp of minced garlic, 1 tbsp of parsley. I baked 4 potatoes so I can have really full potato skins, but I was still able to have enough remaining over to use as a side for next day dinner menu. Added some shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream and scallions to the top with some steak gravy. Delicious!!

I believe these were the best twice baked potatoes I've ever had.  I did modify them slightly by adding two cups of shredded cheddar (I made four potatoes though) and I used the entire thing of cream cheese (8oz) instead of the 6oz that it would be for doubling the recipe.  I also know I used more than two Tbsp of milk, probably more like four.  I then topped the potatoes with some shredded cheddar and baked.  They were so amazing!  We have tried so many twice baked potato recipes and this one is the winner!!!

I made these tonight for supper. Had my daughter and grand daughter (2 years old) over for dinner and thought that I'd make these. I added some real bacon bits to the potato mixture before putting them into the oven.....I was told that these were excellent. I'd make this again, for sure.

These were delicious!  I only made two, so I microwaved them and followed the recipe exactly after that.  It seems that the serving size is off...one nice size baking potato is good for two people.
Thanks for the great recipe!

The potatoes were good, but a bit on the bland side.  Next time I would like to add some bacon and cheddar cheese on top.  It seemed like potatoes stuffed with regular mashed potatoes.  It is a perfect recipe for people that like their food bland.

These were very good and very simple to make.   My only change was to use cream cheese with chive spread in place of the cream cheese and I used more milk until it reached my desired consistency.

These are fantastic! Easy and tasty! I used my stand mixer to mix everything together. I was pleasantly surprised that the only cheese in them was cream cheese. This is definitely a new favorite with my family! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This recipe was easy and delicious. I added fresh chives and finely chopped fresh broccoli into the blended mixture and twice baked the potatoes this way. This recipe was such a great way to have a potato side dish with just about any dinner.

Delicious.  Added a tad more milk to help get a creamier texture.  Topped them bacon bits and cheddar cheese before baking them the second time.  Garnished with green onions/scallions prior to serving. They were a big hit and everyone loved them.

Great recipe.  Only thing I did differently was add a few finely chopped green onion and then only the onion close to the chives.  There was just a hint of the flavor.  Was afraid someone might not like the onion part.

This is the best twice baked potato recipe I have ever tried.  The one thing I changed was added more cream cheese.  Fabulous.
