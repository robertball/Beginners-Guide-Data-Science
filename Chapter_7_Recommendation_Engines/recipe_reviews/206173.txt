Substituted applesauce for oil. 3/4 cup of applesauce instead of 1cup of oil. This changes the bake time to 80 minutes. Bread came out moist not wet. I used fresh apples it makes all the difference.

I had excess dried apples so this sounded perect......I just didn't like the taste and when brought in to the office only a few slices were taken which is usually not the case of baked good I bring in. Sorry hopefully it will work for others:)

with the few changes that other reviewers made like 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar as well as 2 teaspoon of vanilla and extra cinnamon which is my family's personal preference it was delicious. I used honey crisp apples which really cook up well.

After I made this the first time it was so well liked that I made it again the next day and then again for my husband to take to work. I ran out of oil so I substituted a stick of butter (melted) and half a cup of sour cream. It turned out perfectly!

Made it as written and then used half brown sugar half white. Preferred the half brown sugar cake. I used a bundt pan and it was cooked to perfection in 90 mins at 300. When I bake thick batter cakes I find the out crust can be too dark. 300 was perfectly baked. Will definitely make again.

This turned out to be a nice moist apple bread. I loved the burst of flavor as you re eating this from the dried apples.
