I've been looking for a great shrimp bisque and I've certainly found it. Yes, it's time consuming but worth the effort. I scaled the recipe to eight, however, I did use a whole pound of shrimp. The scaled down version asked for 3/4 of a cup of butter to make the roux. I felt that this was a little too much fat so I halved the amount of butter and flour and it was fine. Instead of fish stock, I used the shrimp broth from previous shrimp cocktail appetizers that I had frozen and saved for this occasion. To cut down on the fat even further, I boiled my shrimp instead of sauteeing and I used fat free half and half in lieu of heavy cream. I suggest straining the soup before you add your cream. Delicious!  My whole family enjoyed this very much. Thanks!

This was very good. It is a little troublesom to make, but if you like Bisque soup it is well worth it. We used it over linguini noodles and found it to be very good as a sauce also(just make it a bit thicker with the roo)

I would have given this a 5, but it is different each time you make it.  I have found that using clarified butter is important.  Lots of work, but usually worth the effort.

My whole family loved this.  It was a bit time consuming, but what good food isn't?  I made it exactly as the recipe laid out.  Next time I will cut back on the brandy some.  I think I will also wait on adding the shrimp until just before serving.

Sorry but this just did not do it for me.  Overpowering brandy/sherry taste and lacking basic seasoning i.e. salt and pepper.  Thanks for posting your recipe though.

I felt that the addition of heavy cream to a already thick roux-based sauce was too much. 
Additionally the fish stock replaced rather added to the shrimp flavour. I liked the use of Brandy.
