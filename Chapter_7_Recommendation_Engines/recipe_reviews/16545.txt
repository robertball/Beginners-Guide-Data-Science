Loved it!  Served it at a party for 20 adults - a big hit!  I used halved grape tomatoes and next time will put in more pepperoni (maybe thicker sliced and quartered - they wanted to stick together) and fresh mushrooms instead of jar.  I used mini penne and it was really pretty.  I served it well chilled (4 hours in fridge), but enjoyed it much more later on at the party when it was lukewarm.  I don't think I'll make it ahead next time.  But will definitely be making it again (and again, and again)

Good and easy pasta salad for any occassion...even dinner! I used fresh mushrooms and ommitted the olives and tomatoes (none available). Also, I added ALMOST 1/4c of the dressing to the salad while refrigerating to keep the noodles from clumping together, which I think enhanced the flavor. When it came time to serve, added the remaining dressing and per the suggestion of a friend that was over, I mixed in 1 TBLS of white sugar, which added a very subtle touch of sweetness!

i'm the one in the family that picks all the peppers out of supreme pizzas when we order them, but with this recipe i really enjoyed all the flavors! i enjoyed it without the dressing mixed in, but either way is good. i added in some chopped salami for another flavor. i also warmed some boboli bread in the oven, and we had a complete meal. very versatile to meet your own preferences. easy and quick to put together. delicious!

It is great cold but my son's girlfriend put hers in the micro and nuked it for about four min. stirring halfway and said it was great hot too...she didn't want to eat a cold Pizza salad...so works both ways.

Even my picky husband loved this!  I used spiral pasta and I omitted the oregano (husband doesn't like it) and it turned out excellent.  Will definitely be using this recipe again. 
I also used 2 cups of mozzerella cheese and I used a Safeway Select brand of Italian dressing called Parmesan & Herb. 
Was fantastic!  Highly recommended!

I made this with a few alterations for a potluck at my work.  I added yellow bell pepper to the green and red, added a cucumber, used a red onion rather than green onions, added green olives to the black olives, omitted the mushrooms and mozzarella, and probably used more than 2 tbsp of parmesan cheese.  Everyone at work raved over this salad - there were no leftovers. I'm sure that I'll be asked to bring it again.

HUGE hit at our family meetup get-together tonight. I made just a couple small substitutions: I used elbow macaroni, one yellow pepper, two tomatoes and part of a red onion. One of the kids had three helpings! I am SO making this again.

Really good recipe to take for pot lucks! We took this to our neice's graduation party & it was devoured! Only 3 changes I would suggest for anyone making this and what I'll do next time I do--#1use a homemade (or buy a packet of the Good Seasons Italian dressing) & use instead of bottled, BUT decrease the oil, as written it's just too oily on your lips when eating. Next time I'll be using the "less oil" recipe on the back of the package, #2 add basil (we used fresh, but dried would work too) & finally use fresh mushrooms--canned just aren't good (in my opinion) unless used in a cooked dish--go for the fresh & you'll love this salad even more. Delicious, no-mayo salad that really has a great taste.

I used fresh mushrooms, added salami, used way more pepperoni, cubed the mozzerella and added cubed monterey jack cheese.  Used a flavored Italian dressing instead of just the plain or zesty.  Took this to a teacher's luncheon...the first thing to go and the most requested recipe!  When you take the lid off, it smells just like pizza!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was a real hit with my guests at a recent salad/dessert buffet I hosted. Forgot to shop for mushrooms and mozzarella, so made do with finely grated asiago and no mushrooms. Pre-dressed and allowed to meld for 4 hours before party. Yummy, thanks Tony.

I cannot say enough about this wonderful salad.  It is both adult and child friendly.  I took it to my granddaughter's granduation 
party and came home with an empty dish.  Everyone asked for the recipe and I fortunately had it with me.  I'm sure any 
favorite pizza topping would lend itself quite well to the original recipe by adding, replacing or omitting ingredients to your 
taste.  I will definately be taking this salad to other cookouts!

This was pretty good, I used penne pasta as that's all I had. However, it does not take the place of a baked pizza in our house!

It does not taste like pizza, it tastes like your average pasta salad. But, it was well received at the 4th of July BBQ I brought it too, so I would make it again.

I upped the amount of dressing and added a handful of "salad supreme" seasoning.  I also added in 4 oz. of diced salami, fresh mushrooms and chunky pieces of provolone, parmesan and feta cheeses.  Makes a great "meal" salad with focaccia bread on the side.    Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was a hit.  I changed it to my tastes - left out mushrooms, added artichoke hearts, used sharp cheddar instead of mozz cheese.  I used Wishbone Italian dressing.  I also added a little McCormick pasta salad seasoning.  As others suggested, I bought a stick of pepperoni, sliced thick pieces, and quartered them rather than using the thin pre-sliced stuff.  Very good.. will make many more times in the future!

This recipe was phenominal! I brought it to work, and everyone raved. The only adjustment I made was I omitted the mushrooms, as I don't care for them. I'm sure I'll be making this again soon! Thanks Tony.

My family really enjoyed this warm alongside a Ceasar salad.  I didn't have a green pepper on hand, but instead used a large sweet onion which I first sauteed with 8oz. of fresh mushrooms instead of using the canned.  I also added in some salami.  We used a creamy, Tuscany Italian and it was divine!

This is a great pasta salad!  So refreshing from the mayo based types -which are often greasy feeling and heavy.   Changes made -first I opted to use tri-colour rotini, used fresh mushrooms, left out the tomato and green onions.  Instead of using shredded mozzarella cheese, I used the string cheese style, and sliced them into 1/4" slices.  The type of dressing used will either make this salad good, or great.  I used a roasted red pepper Italian w/ parmesan viniagrette...and wow talk about a burst of flavour on the palate...yummy!

Salad that would be great for a pot luck dinner or something along that line.  It was simple to make, all ingredients were in my pantry already, so I didn't have to make any substitutions. I wish I had paid a little more attention...I will be eating this pasta salad all week.  What especially makes it good is that you don't put the dressing and mozzarrelo cheese on it until serving.  Very unique taste.

Yum!  This was a big hit with us!!  I used turkey pepperoni and Light Done Right dressing to cut down on the fat content.  This is a great salad to take to a picnic or pot luck dinner.  Thanks!

I made this recipe for my Bunko group, and they all loved it!  Instead of shell pasta, I used colored bow-tie pasta.  It really added to the already colorful presentation.  It was very cool for this hot summer weather.  I served it with garlic french bread and fresh cantalope.  It was wonderful!

Decent.  I thought there wasn't a balance between the pasta and the other ingredients(too much pasta).  I even used 5 oz of pepperoni and next time I will use less pasta and up a few of the other ingredients.  Nothing spectacular but good flavors!

I can't believe all the great compliments I received on this dish!  I've been cooking for a long, long time and this one is right up there with my other "bests".  I upped some of the quantities but that was it:  Used 10 green onions, 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms, 8 oz. pepperoni, 15 oz. black olives, 2 T. garlic powder, 3/4 t. pepper, 16 oz. bottle Zesty Italian dressing (or Robusto Italian), 2 c. Mozzarella and 1/2 c. Parmesan.  I had people asking to take some home for work the next day.  Raves, raves, raves!  (If our daughter wasn't coming to dinner, I would've used spicy pepperoni but I knew she would've just picked them all out).  Thanks for a true keeper!

We loved this salad. Left out the mushrooms, cause I don't care for them and  I did add more pepperoni and more cheese as someone suggested.  I also added some regular pizza sauce - 1/2 to 1 cup. Gave it a little extra zing.  Will definitely make it again.

Good recipe!  You can alter this pretty easily, using whatever vegetables you have on hand.  I've tried it with small brocolli pieces or cauliflower.  This is a great receipe for a potluck, everyone who tries enjoys it.  Thanks again!

I made this recipe using pepperoni, cheddar cheese, bacon, ham, sausage, bell peppers, banana peppers, onions, and black olives and it tasted very much like a pizza salad + pasta and was good.

I am giving this 5 stars because I think the flavor would have really popped if I would NOT have used TURKEY PEPPERONI which has much less flavor.  Also, FYI, this make a BUNCH of salad.  If you only have a few couples eating, you may want to halve this recipe.  I served it with meatball subs and it was well received.

I used the suggestion of adding pasta sauce to the dressing, used turkey pepperoni cut in fours and added spinach for more color.  I left out olives and mushrooms. I tried it heated up too.  Enjoyed

I had to bring a salad for my boyfriend's Grandma's 80th birthday party... and this one fit the bill, it was really really easy to make and I got lots of requests for the recipe and positive feedback.  I substituted turkey pepperoni and used 100% whole wheat Flax Omega 3 Rotini for the shells to make it a bit healthier.  It was great!

Loved this salad.  Served it with "Great Garlic Bread" from this site.  Together they made a tasty summer "supper".

This is great! I made this last night. I just measured the meat and veggies by sight, and made the dressing with Good Seasons dry mix, and added it last night. I omitted the salt, and added the cheeses today. Highly would recommend this as a twist on pasta salad. My whole family enjoys it!

I served this warm with the mozarella cheese melted. It was delicious! It really did taste like a supreme pizza. Not as good the next day though.

Good...I put the dressing on each individual serving, that way the pasta remaining in the main bowl didn't absorb the moisture and become dry.

This is the best pasta salad I have ever eaten! I left out the mushrooms because I don't care for them and I cubed the mozzarella cheese. I used 5 or 6 oz of pepperoni and fat free cheese and garlic Italian dressing. I brought it to a potluck and it was all gone!

It was actually a little bland.  I expected more flavor to it, and I did use spicy italian dressing.  We still enjoyed it and I will make it again.  I will probably try a different italian dressing next time.

After reading the reviews, I was excited about making this salad.  I was unimpressed.  It tasted just like any other pasta salad.  After all that preperation, I expected something a ittle different from the same old thing.  
I won't make this again.

This was pretty good - not as good as expected given all the ratings, but part of this might've been my fault.  The green onions were large and very strong - I think next time I wont use as many.  Also, not enough pepperoni - the recipe calls for 2-1/2 oz. - I added 4 oz. and there still wasnt' enough in my mind or my husband's.  I'll definitely try it again and make those small changes - see how it comes out.  Oh, and I didn't add quite the full 8 oz. of dressing - didn't think it needed so much!

Yummy salad. Went great with the Baked Ravioli recipe. Used sundried tomatoes instead of fresh and left out the green peppers. Used Trader Joe's Italian Balsamic dressing and it was perfect.

I didn't change a thing and it was perfect.  I don't enjoy the peppers, but some do and said it added the right flavor they needed.  I, of course, had to have mayo and cheese on mine.  It was great.  Even my 3 year old and 7 year old loved it.

Very good. I omited peppers and used swiss cheese instead of mozarella (personal preferences) and it turned out great. Thanks
