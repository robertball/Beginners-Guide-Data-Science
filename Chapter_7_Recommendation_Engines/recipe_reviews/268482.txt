Tasted delicious, but the recipe had some problems. The dough was almost impossible to shape, especially once I added the raspberries. My recommendations:

- grate and chill the butter ahead of time. I think my scones spread out rather than up because the butter wasn't cold enough

- cut the raspberries into halves or quarters. The raspberry chunks were a bit too big

- bake slightly longer than directed - I think 17 minutes was about right for me
