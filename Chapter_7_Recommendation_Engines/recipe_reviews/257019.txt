Definitely will make it again. However, I misread the cheese amounts and used 2/3rds the amount of cheese and it still came out terrific.. I did top the mixture with some coarsely crushed, famous brand, buttery crackers. Next time I plan on addding some "OLD BAY" seasoning to zip it up a little (for my taste.)
