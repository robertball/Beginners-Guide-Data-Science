Just what you want from garlic bread - golden and toasty with good, fresh garlic flavor and not bogged down with lots of cheese, herbs or mayonnaise.  I used butter, not margarine, mixed the freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano right in with the butter and added some chopped parsley for freshness and color.

This makes a delicious garlic spread.  I have made 2 batches already.  I double it each time and leave it in the refrigerator  and it is there when I need it.  I add 1 tablespoon olive oil and I only had Italian seasonings, so used it instead of oregano.  One batch I left out the parmesan cheese and was just as delicious.  At other times I bake it until it starts to brown around the edges and then put a slice of provolone or mozzarella cheese on it and continue baking until it is melted. This is a keeper!

Delicious!  I used one whole tsp. of oregano.  This is good with or without the parmesan cheese.  I baked my bread at 425 for 10-12 minutes until it got brown vs. using the broiler.

Very good! I took some previous reviewers' suggestions and added some olive oil , as well as plenty of Italian herbs. I also used this recipe--without the cheese--for croutons and they were superb.

I used garlic powder (about 2 teaspoons)because I was out of fresh.  This was stilll the best garlic bread I've ever had.  Not too powerful, didn't leave the salty aftertaste behind... wonderful!  Thank you for the great idea, this will be a favorite next to my homemade spaghetti!

Easy to prepare, topped with some finely shredded mozzerella and a little cheddar before putting under the broiler. Everyone loved it.

I used Texas Toast bread for this. It came out really good and not too garlicky. I cut this down to only 4 servings but still used lots of Parmesan. Thanks it had a great flavor from the toasted cheese.

I loved this garlic bread and I wouldn't change a thing.  Fresh garlic and dried oregano are the perfect mix.  I love fresh  garlic so much I am beginning to think it should be it's own food group. Garlic powder just doesn't compare to the fresh stuff.  Watch broiling carefully.  I broiled it for 3 minutes and the edges turned black.  I made this again and broiled for exactly 2 minutes and the bread was perfectly browned.  This is my new garlic bread recipe. Thank you!

I made this when I had little time, but needed a bread to go along with dinner.  I did sub Italian seasoning for the oregano and was very pleased with the flavor.  This was quick, easy and yummy!

OH MY!  This is wonderful!  Didn't change a thing.  Was a little leary about the fresh garlic but it was perfect.  I even used freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  10 times better than the frozen store bought stuff.

I loved the flavor the oregano gave the bread. I used fresh and also mixed the parm right into the butter. I used more parm than called for and the bread came out nice and golden on top. Thanks Gina!

The best garlic bread recipe. once I tweeked it.  The garlicy taste didn't stand out at all so I made another loaf with these adjustments.  I used 6 large cloves.  I boiled the cloves and crushed it with a pestal (quite quick because it's so soft).  Followed the 1/4 tsp of dried oregano, 1/2 cup butter, crushed and mixed it all up with the pestal, then spread it on semolina bread which I cut down the middle.  Next, I sprinkled some garlic powder (not much, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to sprinkle on both halves [1/2 tsp each]) and instead of 3 tbs of Parmesan, I used 2 tablespoon of Pecorino Romano to sprinkle on both halves for a sharper kick.  I generously grated mozzarella on the cut halves, set my little oven to Broil and cooked for 3 mins.  Once done, I changed the setting on my oven to Toast and toasted it on the preprogrammed middle setting so the bread could be slightly crispy.  INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!!!!!!  The tweeked recipe on the 2nd loaf was a huge hit for my get-together.  It went incredibly fast and because it's pretty quick to make, I just pulled out another loaf and whipped up another upon request.  :)

This was a super quick and fast garlic bread that basically took minutes to make.  I used some fresh oregano and a little dill from my garden. And some leftover buns I had.  I also had some leftover butter mixture so I just froze it to use another time.  The butter would also be good on veggies.

this one had mixed reviews with the family although there was no bread left.
A little more oregano and a smidge of marjoram did wonders if you like the flavor of these herbs. but over all very good.

If you have left over spread and bread you can just make it up , put it in the freezer and use when required .  Or you can make the spread do extra and then just keep it in airtight container in the fridgeand when required just add a little more fresh garlic.

This was pretty good. I followed the directions and did not change anything but I did use freshly grated parmesan.

Even though I did slightly, oops, overcook these (I always forget about stuff when its in the broiler), they were very good!  Instead of sprinkling the parm over the butter mixture, i just mixed it in with the butter and spread it on.  Next time I'll try not to overcook these.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful garlic bread!  Used butter, and gently boiled it with the minced garlic prior to spreading it on the bread.  Used shredded mozzarella cheese on top.  Yum!!

This was an easy, fun way to spice up a regular loaf of french bread.  I added a little paprika to give it a pretty color.  I also put in a little parsley.  Watch the time when broiling! My oven had been on for a while toasting pine nuts before I put the bread in, and by one and a half minutes the edges of the bread were starting to burn.

We liked this - we didn't need to alter the recipe to enjoy it but did have to fuss to get it as crunchy as we wanted. We took it to a potluck after trying it out ourselves. :)

This was really good, although I might want to play with it a few more times to get it JUST RIGHT.  I made it twice so far.  I used grated cheese AND shredded cheese, both Parmasan, and I used a little more than the recipe called for....just really went my instinct.  I like a lot of cheese and a lot of garlic!!!  It was great when I made it using the smaller fatter Italian bread.  The first time I made it, I used a delicious, long dough-y Italian bread but it was almost too dense and chewy for garlic bread. That bread was perfect on its own with butter.  The second time was better. Also, it was better to burn it a little bit or at least make it browner.  I used minced garlic from the jar, and I used more than the recipe called for.  Also added a bit more parsley, and I think the second time I used a little oregano, too. VERY yummmmy.  First time I made it for my boyfriend and he really liked it.  Second time I made it for my parents and they LOVED it.  Like I said, the second time I made it was better.  Might experiment with more seasonings next time.  Also might experiment with different types of cheese, either as substitutes or as combinations.  I make a lot of Italien food, so there is plenty of opportunity to make a good cheesy garlic bread to go with our meals!!  Yummmmmmm!!!

This is great to keep around.  I just mix everything together, including the cheese, and put the leftovers in a sealed container in the fridge.  The butter re-hardens, but can easily be used at a later time when toasting bread.  We always sprinkle some mozzarella cheese on our bread...it's great stuff.

I made this for a party a few days ago and then made it again the following day!  It was THAT delicious!  The first time I used 4 large cloves of garlic and it was almost too much.  I cut it to 3 the next time and it was perfect.  Its a keeper!

My son thought this was the best bread he'd ever eaten!!!  It was a change from the version I usually made, and I was ready for something new.  This was very good and simple.  Careful with the oregano...it is strong and will be the dominating flavor if you use too much.

I'm so glad I found a quick simple recipe for garlic bread.  The garlic bread we used to make would always turn out to be dry but THIS one was just perfect.  I spinkled cheddar cheese on one half and mozzarella on the other.  You can really use any type of bread, I used round buns.

Really good!  I added more garlic, but it was too much.  I should have stuck with the recipe.  I will make again!

This recipe couldn't have been easier or faster.  It was a nice compliment to the spaghetti tonight.

Excellent.  I didn't have fresh garlic on hand so I just used 1 tsp. garlic powder.

Fabulous!  Easily the best garlic bread I've ever made, and it's so simple!  I've used both french and sour dough and they were both awesome.  I didn't change a thing!
