My family gobbled these up very quickly, these are the best waffles I've served them so far (I make them often). I'm sticking with this recipe!
Thank you for sharing it!!
By the way, I did alter a little by adding a bit more milk to get the batter to the consistency that I wanted, the original recipe was to thick to be poured into the waffle iron

02-20-16 ~ My son was home from TN and wanted homemade waffles for breakfast.  I didn't have whole milk, but I did have buttermilk and 1% - so I used a combination of those to make 1 1/4 cups.  These cooked up exactly as the submitter states "crispy on the outside, tender on the inside".   A delicious waffle that will be made again!

Excellent, used coconut oil vs butter, skim milk vs whole,  due to dietary reasons.  This recipe was one of the best tasting & light waffles we have had.  Served it to our guests and we all agreed this is a keeper, thank you!

delicious. Light, fluffy and flavorful. I followed the recipe except for letting the batter sit, I can't imagine that it would be that much better if I had.

Made it just the way it was written up. My husband thought it had too much vanilla but was generally pleased with the results. I thought it was great just the way it was.  Thank you.

These were the best waffles I’ve ever had! No need to substitute anything or look elsewhere for another recipe. Just fantastic!

Perfect waffle!  Crunchy outside with soft tender center.  I made mine in a Belgium waffle maker.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.

I make it exactly as written, although I always have to triple or even quadruple the recipe since we love it so much! It’s always light and fluffy, so moist and flavourful. Keeps well in the fridge if you do have leftovers

I have made these waffles multiple times and keep coming back to this recipe for more. Definitely let the batter sit as per instructions, they get much better.

These waffles are delicious!  I made exactly as the recipe stated, except I only had 2% milk on hand.  This is now my go-to recipe.  We gobbled them up and can't wait to make more!
