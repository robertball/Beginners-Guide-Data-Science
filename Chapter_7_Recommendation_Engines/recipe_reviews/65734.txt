This was very good. Even my kids liked it! The only thing I did differently was cover it with foil the last 30 minutes so that it stayed juicy. Delicious!

This was pretty good. I liked the flavor of the marinade on the chicken, but didn't care for how the potatoes came out. If I use this recipe again in the future, I would skip the potatoes, stuff the onion inside the chicken's cavity, and just baste the bird with the marinade.

I cooked this for my boyfriend's family for Christmas dinner. I made a minor adjustment by taking the potatoes away from the recipe, since I was already making mash potatoes. I also used the remaining soy sauce mixture and onions to make the gravy which was absolutely scrumptious!

This was super easy and smelled wonderful while roasting.  Only mistake I made is I forgot to stir the potatoes and onions for the first hour, but remeberd for the last 30 minutes and they turned out perfect.  Will be making again for sure.

This was SO good! It tasted similar to a rotisserie chicken. I made it for a Mother's Day dinner and everyone loved it!! I didn't change a thing about the recipe, except I made mashed potatoes on the side instead. The drippings from this would make an excellent gravy. You could even use the marinade on chicken pieces- like boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Great recipe!

A Very good recipe with lots of flavors abounding.  I added carrots and asparugus pieces (the asparagus a little later).  I marinated the vegetables separately in zip lock bags for about 0ne hour before cooking.  Additionally I cooked the chicken by itself for 10 minutes at 450' to seal the surface, brown and crisp the skin and enable the balance of the cooking to be at 350', adding the vegetables after the 10 minutes at 450' and the asparagus after 20 minutes.  Everything else was as specified in the recipe.  A delicious and very moist bird.

Very good.  Made the recipe w/o the potatoes and onions because my family prefers baked potatoes.  The chicken was very tender and juicy, and the marinade was delicious.  Will Definitely make again.  Took another poster's suggestion and covered the chicken with foil for the last 30 minutes.  perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this!  We ate it all week!  I made it with chicken pieces and new potatoes, and I doubled the marinade.  I used apple cider vinegar, and it was so good!  I filled two 9x13 baking dishes.  I kept them lightly tented with foil and basted often during baking.  After dinner, I separated the leftover chicken, potatoes, and the sauce.  I took out all of the fat from the sauce.  The next day, I cooked up some angel hair pasta, poured the sauce over it, and let it sit in the frige.  I also deboned the chicken.  For supper, I put a little olive oil in a pan and tossed the pasta and chicken until it was heated through.  It was wonderful, especially with a little garlic pepper and a little extra soy sauce.  (I used low sodium soy sauce.)  This is a keeper!!

Easy to make and comes out moist and delicious.  Used a 4 lb bird - free range, vegetarian chicken.  Used 6 potatoes.  Just add a vegetable and dinner is done.  Will make again.

Yummy.  I added carrots to the potato/onion mixture.  The dish ended up being pretty large, and needed to cook for a little more than 2 hours (I covered it with foil for the last 30 minutes), but it was worth waiting for.  I'll definitely make this again.

The chicken was excellent.  I basted it in the marinade then let it hang out in the fridge for about an hour, then brought it out on the counter and basted it twice more while I cut up my veggies.  I used potatoes, carrots, zucchini, onions & garlic.  I doubled the marinade as some other suggested so I'd be able to use it over the veggies.  All in all the flavor was great, but I found the soy sauce to be pretty overpowering on the veggies.  The chicken flavor was great, next time I will probably let it marinade in the fridge longer so the flavor really soaks in, and perhaps make a separate recipe of the marinade with less soy sauce for the veggies.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe as written and covered for last 1/2 hr as per another's suggestion - although I don't think it needed it.  The chicken was very moist and flavourful.  I don't normally like roasted potatoes but these were superb.  This is the first time I've pulled something out of the oven that my husband has said it looked so good that it should be in a magazine.  Thanks for sharing this.  Will definitely make again!

I didn't have the oregano or rosemary so I used an Italian herb medley.  My chicken took almost 2 hours to cook and I had to turn the heat down or else the bird would have burned.  I ended up flipping the bird over the last 30 minutes of cooking.  Taste was good for the chicken, the potatoes were ok.  The kids didn't like them though the adults did.  Next time I'll cut down on the soy sauce and increase the garlic.

I love this marinade. I've made it many times as written, but last night I used the marinade on barbecued chicken and it was awesome. I quartered the bird, brushed the pieces with marinade & threw them on the grill. I brushed each time I flipped the meat & the results were amazing. The skin crisped up really nicely and it was juicy and delicious. Highly recommend this recipe!

Excellent. Added frozen tart cherries and smaller new potatoes half way through (larger potatoes already in the roaster). No soy sauce, no olive oil. Two organic chickens stuffed into a covered roaster. Coated chickens and potatoes with herb mixture. Didn't stir while cooking. Perfect.
I'm wheat and corn intollerant. Looked at two soy sauces, but each had one or both. So skipped the soy sauce. Herbs really made a statement. Didn't feel a chicken needed more oil.

I left a chicken thawing on the counter and sent my husband this recipe then went to work. I came home to a delicious smelling home, a clean kitchen and a proud husband. The recipe was simple enough for a not-so-experienced cook to follow, and was yummy the first time around then again for leftovers. My only complaint is that it's very salty (due to the soy sauce), so I wouldn't make it too frequently. Oh, and hubby replaced wine vinegar (which I'd thought we had, but didn't) with cooking sherry and balsamic vinegar.

Love the Chicken and the potatoes are awesome. Make sure to make a good batch of potatoes. I usually use 6 Big ones. Make sure to also stir them often (usually every 30 min).

Couldn't have been MORE surprised by how this turned out.  Only dry plates were left in this house.  I did add mushrooms to my potatoes and 1/4 onion in the cavity of the chicken (which I do no matter what the recipe is).  Mmmmmmmmmm.  This has been in our regular rotation since the first time I made it!

I have made this dish a number of times and everyone just loves it. I load extra veggies like brocoli and carrots around the chicken and increase the sauce by 50% as we like to drizzle a bit of the sauce over the plates when serving.

Absolutely great and easy.  I used white wine vineger seasoned with tarragon because I had no red wine vineger in the house.  I accidentally poured all of the sauce on the chicken instead of basting it with it and it came out perfect.  The potatoes were perfect too.  Thanks!

I see alot of people lost the potatoes in this recipe and made mashed instead... to me, that was the best part of the recipe. Chicken was unremarkable to say the least. Probably won't try again, but on the other hand... Kikkoman has some great recipes out there, so thank you guys!

I butterflied the chicken and laid it down on the bottom of the roasting pan and then filled in around it with the potato and onion mixture.  This made the chicken skin get crisp and golden and easier to cut up to serve.  My husband who doesn't like vinegar found this dish to be excellent.   This is a keeper for those wanting a tasty and easy roast chicken recipe.  I think the next time I prepare it I will cut the onions into thicker slices; I rather like a sweet onion slice.

this recipe is amazing. instead of turkey this past thanksgiving i made this roasted herb chicken and i got such compliments on my cooking skills. its so easy to do and the drippings makes one of the best gravy i had ever had. the only difference i made to this is that i added carrots, celery and onion with the potatoes. the vegetables turn out so delicious and soft. i am so glad i ran across this recipe.

My family really enjoyed this roasted chicken. I used balsamic vinegar because I did not have red wine, so it came out a little dark but tasted great. I used little red bliss potatoes and they were cooked perfectly in the time it took to cook the chicken. I will definitely make this again, my husband said it "was restaurant good." Thank you!

Delicious taste and aroma from surprisingly simple ingredients. I misread the recipe and dumped all the ingredients on top of the potatoes- before realizing only one TB of the soy sauce mixture needed to be put on the potatoes. No matter- just drained some of the soy sauce mixture out of the pan and brushed it onto and inside the chicken.  The only change I made - aside from my mistake - was to leave the garlic out of the sauce, and instead tossed garlic and carrots with the potatoes, and slipped some sliced garlic under the skin of the chicken.  Tasty and simple- will definitely make again.

This was surprisingly REALLY good and very moist!  I did change the recipe a bit....instead of oregano/rosemary, I just added 4 tsp. italian seasoning and instead of red wine vinegar, I used the juice from two whole lemons, and put the leftover lemon skin inside the cavity of the chicken, along with half an onion and 4 cloves of garlic.  I also used 4 tblspoons olive oil and added 2 tsp. garlic powder. It was delicious! Bake it for 450 for the first 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 and cover with foil for last 30 minutes. Delicious and so easy!

I thought the chicken tasted pretty good and was near fall off the bone tender. However, it was rather greasy especially the potatoes. I baked the chicken on a jelly roll pan well covered in thick foil. I decided to cut the chicken in half for ease. I put the potatoes and onions to either side. The only change I made was ruducing the black pepper. After it was done, I tried to make the potatoes seem a little less greasy by mixing some spinach seasoned with garlic salt. It helped some, but overall the chicken and potatoes was still too oily for me. I am still on the hunt for the perfect roasted chicken.

I made this for dinner last night and it was delicious and so easy to make! I followed the directions exactly and added sweet potatoes with red potatoes.  My family loved it! I just finished eating a Chicken Salad Sandwich with the leftover chicken and it was so good! I used the Fruited Curry Chicken Salad recipe from this site. Enjoy! :)

So good!  The chicken was super juicy and flavorful.  I added more (1tsp) rosemary, (2 tbl) oil and (1/2 tsp) garlic powder when I mixed the potatoes.  I had to cook it an extra 10 minutes than the recipe called for and tented the pan the last half hour.

Incredible!  The soy sauce gives it an amazing flavor.  I used Apple Cider Vinegar in lieu of the red wine vinegar.  Came out amazing.  BTW - I also used this sauce plus 1/2 c water in the crockpot with chicken thighs.  YUMMY! **I also use Apple Cider Vinegar in lieu of red wine vinegar.

The only thing I did different was to add carrots to the roasting pan.  This was excellent!  My son kept asking for more.  The potatoes took longer to cook than stated but wasn't a problem...just took the chicken out and let the veggies remain in the oven for another 15 minutes.  Would definitely do again!

This was the easiest, best chicken recipe I have found.  The only change I made was apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar(didn't have any on hand), and it still turned out wonderful! My husband is picky and my 5 boys were picking the bones by the end of the meal! Even all the potatoes were gone-they usually prefer mashed, but kept going back for more and more! Thank you so much-it is now a staple in our menu planning!

Good flavour!  My chicken was smaller, but I still made the same amount of sauce.  And if you love potatoes, like my family, add more.  I used 4 large potatoes.....next time it'll be six.

Okay so I make a lot of chicken and this is the BEST chicken recipe I have used in forever! I did not use potatoes but I thin-sliced half a red onion to place underneath the chicken but that was the only deviation and it was AWESOME. My boyfriend used the leftover juice and made the best gravy I've had in ages as well. I also followed the sage advice of those wise cooks who covered their chicken for the last 30 minutes and because I used a 5 lb chicken I had to add 15 minutes to my cook time. Wow. Wow. Wow! Will make this again real soon thanks so much for sharing! :)

Pretty good - Used chicken thighs and halved recipe.  Used sweet potatoes and italian seasoning.  Next time just use chicken - no veggies.

This has become our families favorite way to roast chicken. The only change I make is fresh rosemary(because I don't buy dried) and I cook it in a covered dutch oven. We don't always do the potatoes but they are very good. The flavor is wonderful and we always drench our meat in the sauce from the pan.

This was an absolutely fabulous, easy recipe!!!  My husband couldn't wait for dinner because it smelled amazing when cooking!!!  And my kids, ages 7 & 4, who NEVER eat roasted potatoes unless there is bacon and a ton of cheese involved, both had thirds!!  We had NO leftovers!!

This is the best recipe I've tried for roast chicken. Instead of the the potatoes and onion, I stuffed the chicken with homemade stuffing.  Everything was moist and delicious. A hit with the family!

this is fabulous! I used bone in skin on chicken breasts and swapped the soy sauce (sorry Kikkoman) for lemon juice, added 2 tsp of sea salt (to make up for the lack of soy sauce) and fresh oregano and rosemary. I wanted a light lemony herb roasted chicken for summer. The chicken was extremely moist and juicy and crispy on the outside. I cooked the breasts at 325 for an hour, then broiled for 8 minutes to crisp the outside. I will be using this recipe ALL the time!

Fantastic and easy recipe.  As others have said, I used the pan drippings to make some of the move amazing gravy I have ever had.  I used a hand blender to mash the potatoes and onions for fantastic  mashed potatoes as well.  The only thing I did differently was to add a bit of red wine to the pan to keep everything moist.  Will most certainly make it again!

Followed the recipe exactly, (although putting the onion inside the cavity, dusting the top of the chicken with paprika, and cooking for an extra 15mins until finished- never covered) and the chicken turned out beautiful, moist and flavorful. Next time I'd like to try adding baby carrots or brussel sprouts to the potatoes to round out the meal.

This is the fourth roasred chicken dish I have tried from All Recipes and by far...the best one. I loosened the skin from the breast and added some of the mixture inside. Also placed some orange wedges in the chicken cavity. 

Awesome...the chicken picked up the flavors...not just the skin. Way to go Kikkoman!

Easy, delicious,the whole family loved it.  While it was baking I was in the backyard talking to a neighbor who was raving about how good it smelled all the way out back!  I used white balsamic vinegar because I couldn't find the red wine and it was still amazing.

This recipes produced a crisp, wonderfully browned skin, & the potatoes & onions were excellent. However, although the meat was juicy, it had very little flavor.

Wow, double wow! If you tried this recipe and didn't rate it 5 stars, you either didn't make it right or your taste buds need to be examined. Folks, I've roasted a lot of chickens in my day, but this one was the absolute best. Oh, and the potatoes - the crispy outside,  moist inside, oniony flavor was to die for. Make this for yourself, make it for company - don't change a thing, this recipe is perfect as is.

Average or below.  Skin kept moist and flavor did not penetrate down to the meat.  Meat was moist.  Flavor or spices and condiments was not bad; potatoes and onion were good.

Absolutely terrific!  I've always had bland results when roasting chicken but not this time.  I did let the basted bird sit in the fridge for about an hour before baking which might have helped the flavors seep in a little, but the sauce is really flavorful.  And I agree with another reviewer, it makes the best gravy I've ever had (this from someone who loves gravy -- I make it every chance I get).  I did skip the potatoes and used instant mashed instead for that yummy gravy since I didn't have baking potatoes on hand.  I will use this as my standard roast chicken recipe from now on!

Amazingly moist!!! I followed everything according to directions except I didn't add potatoes (the family wanted mashed potatoes, not roasted).  Turned out delicious! This was the first chicken ever that I roasted and wasn't dryish... This recipe is now my go to for roasted chicken!  This was so yummy! Thank you Kikkoman!!!! :)

I used red wine instead of rw vinegar. and garlic powder instead of fresh garlic since I was out of those ingredients. It was a big hit last night. I will definitely make it again. Very juicy. Great flavor for not having salt on the list of ingredients.

Great flavor. Needs more veggies. I added sliced zucchini. Next time I will also add sliced carrots.

this was very good, I followed it almost exactly but doubled the mixture, and it came out juicy and flavorful.  I have made a few times now.  I once stuffed the bird with onions which was very good, and another time I stuffed it with lemon slices which was our favorite!  I give this five stars because it was easy and versatile.

Tastes JUST like the Rotisserie at our local grocery store. SOOO Yummy!!  The ONLY things i changed were... I Doubled the Recipe, (i had 2 chickens i needed to cook) and i did Not add the Potatoes, I also covered the chicken the ENTIRE time, i did this because thats what you od ANY time  you cook meat in the oven. other wise it'll dry your meat out.  (oh i also forgot to baste it the entire time, i basted it afterwards and it was STILL UBER JUICY! Next time ill remember to baste it.) an Hour and 15 min later it was done. i let it sit for 10 min, and FELL IN LOVE! I will be using the Recipe ANY time i want Baked Chicken.

I was not as impressed as many of the other reviews.  I found the outside of the roast moist, but the flavor did not penetrate the skin/meat.  If I made this again, I would bast up under the skin prior to roasting.

I will add carrots next time!  This recipe was really good.  I would suggest rubbing salted, herbed butter under the skin to give the meat a little more flavor but the soy sauce marinade was yummy (I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar) and the potatoes came out delicious!

This is phenomenal! I doubled the marinade, and ended up making a second round of just veggies the next day to go with the leftover chicken. I added baby bella mushrooms and sweet potatoes to the onion and potato - AMAZING!

This was easy and excellent!  As far as the potatoes, I used what I had on hand: half red potatoes and half sweet potatoes.  It was delicious - especially the onions.  I covered it toward the end.  I had it in the oven for 2 hours. I poured the juices into a pitcher that separates fat and then poured the juices over the potatoes and chicken on my plate.  The house smelled so good!

made it tonight just as written, it was excellent. I think next time I will make more marinade to keep the potatoes wet during the cooking, they were a little dry, or try covering the last 30min as others have suggested.

This was my first whole chicken, It took a lot longer then 1 hour and 15 minutes. My boyfriend got off work and was hungry, but we both had to wait almost another hour, the potatoes were not soft! Disappointing to say the least seeing as I followed the recipe to a T.

The sauce is fantastic.  I used 4 lbs of bone-in breasts instead of a whole chicken and added some baby carrots and a little red Cabernet for some extra sauce.  I'll definitely do this one again.

This was delicious and I will make again for sure.  Tender, and very tasty. The only change I man was using Balsamic Vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar (only because I didn't have any) and it gave it a great flavor..It smelled so good while roasting, I couldn't wait to dig in..this one is a keeper.

Absolutely delicious. The only change I made was in the choice of the type of potato. I had fingerling potatoes. They baked the same length of time and they tasted devine!

Great recipe!  I followed the suggestions of others and made the following additions: Diced carrots and extra garlic. I also used sliced red potatoes instead of baking potatoes.  Unlike others, I did not put aluminum foil on the bird - I like a nice, crispy skin and this came out perfectly - crisp skin, juicy meat!  The combination of flavors was wonderful.  My children even ate it!  Definitely a keeper.

This chicken is fabulous, but our supper bombed because the potatoes (and carrots, which I added as well as the advice of reviewers) were still hard and tasted raw after nearly two hours of cooking. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but if I make this again, it will either be plain or with rice beneath it.

This is the best roasted chicken ever. What's funny is I'm not crazy about soy sauce. But the marinade is fantastic!   I doubled the marinade and added carrots. Yummy!  It came out so juicy and the flavor was awesome !!  In my regular rotation. Thanks for this recipe!

Wow, this was soooo good. Moist n' delicious chicken. We served the potatoes with ketchup.  Perhaps we could sprinkle a dry herb mix on the potatoes halfway through the cook time.

This is my favorite recipe above all others. The only thing I do different is omit the pepper and use chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. Words don't do this justice, I start drooling just waiting on it!

Very good! I had roasted potatoes from the night before so just put them in the oven 20 minutes before done and heated them. I did cook at 450 for the first 10 minutes to seal. The chicken was cooked in a stoneware baking Dutch oven so took a litte longer. I put the onions in with the chicken and they were great. I covered the chicken the last 30 minutes with the lid. It made the meat very moist and tender. This was a great dish and we will cook it again

I made as directed, but also added in two big carrots chunked up. 
I made this in my infrared oven and started breast side down, turning half way through the cooking time and stirring the veggies. The meat was juicy and flavorful and everything was roasted to perfection. A great, easy meal for a lazy Sunday lunch.

Just WOW!!!!  I marinated my chicken over night since I like lots of flavor I followed the recipe but did skip on the potatoes since I made mashed instead. Stuffed the cavity with an onion and let the oven do the rest. Did take other viewers suggestions and covered it for the last 30 minutes. Definitely will be making this again!!

This was a big hit with my family of picky eaters!  I basted quite often but it was well worth it. The chicken comes out so moist and tender. I did add some salt to the potatoes. Great recipe!

DELICIOUS marinade! My mom, dad, and I made this recipe for dinner tonight. I roasted a separate serving of redskin potatoes, onions, and asparagus in the marinade (no chicken). We used fresh rosemary. It was so good!! Definitely some of the best roasted veggies I've ever had. This one's a keeper!

This recipe was so easy and tasted great! Marinated the chicken overnight and cooked for about 1 hr 45 on 200 degrees C and the chicken came out very succulent. My mother thought it was duck!! Would def recommend and will def make this again.

Very good but potatoes needed another 35 minutes on 425. They were rock hard for the 75 minutes chicken was in oven at 375. Other than that the Chicken was perfect at that temp

Delicious, juicy & tender! The whole family loved it. I did not have potatoes so I added onions, celery, carrots & garlic around the roasting pan. I also added two garlic cloves & celery into the cavity.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

The best recipe on this site according to my family. I have been making this for two years I believe. My entire family requests it. Making it exactly as stated is scrumptious! I do have a few tips also that I have discovered over the years. At one point I had a wonky stove so I made this in a plug in roaster. It was even better. Also, I have found that it generally takes longer than stated to cook. Now, I throw the chicken in the roaster first and let it start cooking while I prep everything else. I double the sauce. (Even have been known to triple if needed).I do this because we like to drizzle it over the chicken. I also do this because I basically double the potatoes AND add carrots. I cut the veggies up and stir them around in the marinade before adding them to the pan. I also run my hand under the skin of the chicken so I can pour the marinade directly on the meat but leave the skin intact. Don't forget to stir the veggies occasionally. I think leaving the potatoes out of this as many have done is a travesty. They are amazing. I use regular soy sauce and nobody has ever found it too salty. It reheats in the microwave amazingly! Especially if you sliced

I didn't have any rosemary so I substituted thyme and will probably do that again since it tasted perfect!  The smell in our house while the chicken baked was absolutely awesome.  Once the turkey was finished it was beautiful and tasted perfect!

I had to cook my chicken for about 1 1/2 hrs on 375 then 1/2 hr more at 400, but I think I had about a 7 lb. chicken.  This was fantastic though!!!  I have to say the best tasting whole chicken I've ever made!  I threw in some baby carrots with the potatoes and onions.  Delicious!!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  My first time making this recipe I followed the recipe.  I will use this recipe again, but I think next time I might use alittle less soy sauce.  For our taste it was a bit too salty.

I made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe! The whole chicken was moist and tender. I took the chicken out of the oven when it was temping 170 degrees.

Absolutely delicious despite the fact that I screwed up!  Instead of basting with the reserved sauce every 30 minutes as per the recipe's instructions, I mistakenly threw the entire sauce into the roasting pan with the chicken.  After I discovered my mistake I simply basted the chicken with the juices every 30 minutes and it turned out awesome anyway.  The aroma in the house was amazing and the chicken came out a beautiful golden brown colour.  A definte repeat but next time I'll try it the right way!  LOL
PS:  I omitted rosemary and removed chicken skin before roasting.

My husband and I loved it. The flavor was wonderful and the chicken was so juicy. I really liked how the sauce got into the potatoes and carmalized the onions.

This is my first review and I have tried many recipes on this site.  
A couple of months ago I made this recipe and my b/f who is italian, an obvious cook, loved it.
I was making Turkey dinner for Thanksgiving, and thought, why not try this recipe on it? I made the stuffing etc. as usual, did not add potatoes etc., and let me tell you, this made for the best gravy I have ever had! It required little or no seasoning, I did just add a bit of pepper.
Thank you!

I didn't have any rosemary, so I omitted it - I will need to try this recipe again and add it.  Without the rosemary - the chicken just didn't have an intensive enough flavour.

This was DELICIOUS, and very easy. I followed the recipe closely, basting the chicken every half-hour (inside and out) and tossing the potatoes at that time to ensure they didn't dry out. My chicken was 5+ pounds, so took 2.5 hours. I covered the dish for the last 45 minutes. My husband LOVES soy sauce, but he didn't recognize that was the marinade base, so I don't think it's overpowering.

This turned out absolutely perfect as written, just took longer in the oven.  Loved it, very moist and tender chicken and the potatoes were great with it.

i followed the recipe in it's entirety (which i usually don't do) with the exception of a onion up the bird's cavity. since i had a 8-9lb bird, i doubled the servings to 12. it just about doubled the cooking time, too. for the last 30 mins i got a little impatient and turned the oven up to 400° (from 375°). as long as the bird gets to at least 170° internal temp, you'll be fine. also, i did baste it religiously every 30 mins but i forgot to stir the potatoes but they turned out anyway. resting the bird for 35-30 mins is an important step to allow the juices to get throughout. carving too early results in the juice on the cutting board and not in the meat. will make this again!

Very tender and juicy.  I was hoping it would have more flavor, but maybe if I let it sit longer with the marinade next time it will be.   I used red potatoes instead of the baking kind, they were perfect!

I loved this chicken.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it came out perfect. I think the rosemary makes the difference. I would make this for guests and be proud! Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good flavor (although I didn't like the smell when it was roasting).  I think I'd prefer something with less liquid - it was more steamed than roasted to my mind.

Excellent recipe!  I opted for a side of potatoes as with others.  Also tried some white wine & herbs inside the chicken.  A little for the chicken and a little for me!

My family really liked it....I used a large family roasting chicken and it took about 2 hour to bake. My kids gave it 8 out of 10 ~ and that's one kid who hates spices and one who would rather have chicken fried :)   They liked the potatoes too ~ my husband loved it! I loved it and will add carrots and more onion next time (I only had some frozen onion from a stir fry mix in the freezer) but it was still wonderful :) thanks for sharing!

This is a fantastic and easy recipe. I didn't have any oregano or rosemary but DID have some Herbes de Provence which I substituted and I also added carrots and ALL of the vegetables were very flavorful and the sauce that it made was wonderful - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Easy, tasty and super moist! I roasted a small fryer chicken with this recipe, I only had regular soy sauce and I used balsamic vinegar, it still turned out great!   I loved the potatoes and onions, they had such a nice flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I used leg quarters and my NuWave oven.  I added the potatoes later since my chicken was frozen.  I thought I had soy, but had to use Teriyaki instead, and I forgot to add the onions.  This tasted great and made the kitchen smell really good.

I tried this at the last minute, and though  the sauce made the potatoes and onions taste great(I will used this mixture for roasting potatoes now!), it didn't really help the chicken. I don't know what those restaurants do to make their chicken taste so great but this didn't really work for me.

We all loved the smell of this while cooking. It tasted great and the family really enjoyed it. The potatoes were a bit underdone and I cooked for 1 hr 30 min. I also chopped my potatoes really small. The juices of the chicken and the flavor of the marinate was soaked up by the potatoes and gave them a nice flavor.

The chicken was moist, flavors good. Next time I would cut back on the soy sauce and some of the pepper.  A bit too salty for me.

Really tasty recipe!  Only change I made was to add carrots. Our chicken was huge - 6 pounds, so it took 1.5 hours to cook.  (Veggies came out at 1 hour.) Also tented chicken with foil.

This was great, and I would make it again. I made several  minor changes based on my taste and what I had on hand:
-I added about a pound of carrots to the veggies. (The carrots, which were peeled and cut into 2-inch sections, were the best part of the meal!)
-I used redskin potatoes instead of baking potatoes - scrubbed and quartered. (They were good-size potatoes)
-I used herbs de provence since I did not have oregano or rosemary handy
-I used red wine instead of red wine vinegar.
-Based on another review, I put the chicken on a rack and let the veggies rest under the rack (rack is a v shape).

Delicious. Added sweet peppers,celery,carrots to potato’s and onions mix. Stuffed cavity with onions and shallots.  Put 1/2 stick butter on top.  Removed most veggies after cooking. Added some chicken broth to the left over liquid and made a delicious gravy

Wow. This was some of the best chicken I’ve ever eaten. My bird was just under five pounds, and it was cooked in about an hour and 45 minutes. I followed the recipe as is except for not cooking potatoes, and even though my chicken was larger there was still plenty of the sauce for basting. I had already planned fingerling potatoes for the meal, but the next time I make this I will absolutely make a gravy with the drippings and have it over mashed potatoes. Since there was more than enough liquid, I might cut back on the soy sauce to reduce the sodium. I did use the reduced sodium soy sauce. As a bonus, the chicken was beautiful.

Easy prep, smelled great while cooking and in no time, a juicy and tasty chicken with potatoes is ready.  Next time I'll add a few carrots as well.  Family liked it!  It's a keeper.
(I left out the red wine and it was still delicious.)

It was a tasty dish. Always looking for new chicken recipes. This one came out perfectly cooked. Red wine and soy sauce mix was a hit.

My favorite recipe for a whole roasted chicken. 
I would suggest a small change in the instructions, from 'mix the next 7 ingredients' to 'mix the next 7 ingredients in a bowl'.

I made this for dinner tonight with veggies on the side and I'm the only one with leftovers(only because I made too big of a plate lol)!!!! Love the soy sauce mixture and can't wait to try it as a marinade for other types of meat!!!! Oh and I also covered it the last 15 min or so.

I added carrots with the potatoes and I should have cut the carrots  into smaller chunks because they were still quite crunchy, while the potatoes were cooked.

Best roasted chicken ever & potatoes were to die for!  I made a few substitutions based on what I had in the pantry: Soyaki sauce from Trader Joe's instead of soy sauce and mirin sushi vinegar instead of wine vinegar.  I tented with foil about halfway through to keep it from burning.  Hubby loved it so will definitely make again.  Only change I might make next time is to add carrots.

cook the potatoes separately, soy sauce marinade on them was a bit much for me.  Also, I added 4 pats of butter under the breast skin.  Otherwise chicken was good.

This ended up being quite good, though the drippings made for a rather acidic gravy. Will make again but might find a substitute for the red wine vinegar.

I made this dish but added fresh green beans, substituted basil for rosemary (because I didn't have any),  and used only 1/2 of an onion. I also used apple cider vinegar in lieu of red wine vinegar -- again because I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand.

Turned out delicious! I seasoned the chicken with a salt/pepper rub and also added an additional 20 mins to the cook time to make sure the chicken was cooked through all of the way. My mother loved it and I had yummy leftovers for the next day.

My family loved it. The only modifications I made was adding some onion and lemon slices to the inside of the bird, and I added some fresh herbs like Rosemary and Tyme. I also added green beans around the roast chicken towards the end of baking.

The chicken was amazingly juicy and tasted like rotisserie. The potatoes were just potatoes and needed salt.

Excellent flavor blend.  My dinner guest raved about this and soaked up as much of the sauce as possible.  I added carrots and used little potatoes as I needed to use them up and they did not require cutting.  If I made it again I would use a lower sodium soy sauce as I felt the regular made it a bit too salty for my taste.

My husband and I loved this chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 5.5 lb bird so it took longer to roast.  I basted it every 30 minutes and kept checking with a meat thermometer.  The chicken turned out juicy and tender with a nice brown skin.  I did not tent the chicken with aluminum foil, I roasted it uncovered the entire time.  I took the pan juices and made a gravy with about 1/4 cup of flour mixed with warm water.  My gravy always turns out lumpy so I used a hand blender to smooth it out.  This is one of my favorite recipes from this site and it made a very nice Sunday dinner.

I didn't add as many potatoes as I should have because other reviews suggested not too and that was a big mistake. The onions were sweet little juicy bundles of goodness as were the potatoes! The chicken was moist with crispy skin. I didn't cover it. The only other thing I did was to make sure I got some marinade under the skin and put half an onion in the cavity. Delicious! (It may be on the salty side for those sensitive to salt, but it tastes great to me...)

I thought this recipe was just ok... the chicken was definitely moist and tender, however, I felt it needed more flavor. If I make this again, I'll definitely add a little garlic or onion powder to the mix.

I thought this was tasty and the chicken had very nice color due to the soy sauce. I did brine the chicken over night then followed the directions to the letter. I basted every 30 min cooked the bird for over two hr. It was almost a 6 pound bird and the brine may have added to the cooking time. This was the best roast chicken I have made to date. Hubbies folks were here for dinner and I got raved reviews from them.

Very easy and yummy. The only changes made were that I added chicken stock to the pan to make more gravy. I also added potato and mushrooms in the last 40 minutes of cooking time. Definitely making it again.

Just finished making it, aroma and flavor is very good. Did not add potatoes as others said it wasn't the best part, I assume because of the soy sauce/potato combo. Made roasted potatoes separately.

I added sliced carrots to the potato and onion. Also used a bunch of fresh herbs on hand so I added basil, sage and parsley in addition to the rosemary and oregano. I added a little stock and red wine to the drippings to make a gravy. Chicken was SUPER juicy and the veggies were perfect. Everything was very tasty.  Making this again tonight!

This is a great receipt. But I pulled it out of the oven at just over 160 degrees, at 180 it would have been to dry. It was perfect, especially with the cubed bread, celery stuffing inside the bird.

Wasn't able to baste during roasting but still turned out great. Kids loved the flavor of the potatoes especially!

I will give this recipe 5 stars!  This was amazing!  Followed the directions exactly and the chicken was crispy on the outside and meat was juicy and very flavourful.  It also made delicious gravy.  I made mashed potatoes and used some of the drained potato water to extend the amount if the gravy!  Yum!

This was super good and will be on my go-to list. I followed the recipe exactly and got raves!  (I did use basil rather than rosemary only because I had no rosemary.)  I look forward to using Mrs. Snowflake's suggestion to  cook with chicken pieces and use the lefties with pasta as well as EKStattler's suggestion to cook on the grill with the marinade as a grill sauce.  Both sound great.  As others have mentioned, I think that any vinegar that you have on hand could be substitued for the red wine vinegar.  I love balsamic and may try that next time.  Or apple cider.......or white wine!   All that being said, no substitutions needed. This is great as written!

Wow, okay so my husband and I both love to cook and are not impressed by a lot of chicken recipes, this one however has GREAT flavor!  I used a 6lb+ chicken and used 6 carrots, 6 potatoes.  I also used the convection roast setting on the oven.  It was done in just 1hr and 20 mins.  I also forgot to stir the veggies during the cooking process and instead did it when I took it out.  This came out so good my husband saved the juices, 'cause the food was gone!  Will definitely make again.

We lov d the flavor,,, I used assorted baby potatoes rather than baking which I believe were better to absorb the liquid. Next time I will lift the skin to pour some marinade under, add chunks of a urn ip, carrot , celery and onion and have a complete one pot dinner.

This was a super fast and easy recipe. The chicken came out tender, with white meat not terribly dry as often happens with roasted/baked chicken. The veggies were divine over brown rice!  I added celery and extra onion. Next time I will also add leeks!

The chicken was perfect--alone, I would rate it 5 stars. But the soy sauce overwhelmed the potatoes and they did roast wonderfully with the chicken. I'm trying something else next time.

Made this for my family for Sunday dinner and it was a hit!  Really liked the flavor of the chicken and potatoes.  I did cover the chicken with foil the last 20 minutes as it was already brown enough.  Served it with broccoli/cauliflower side dish and strawberry parfaits for dessert.  Will definitely make this one again.  I also used the carcass to make a lovely chicken stock for later...

Made this tonight and the whole family loved it!!!!  Very simple to make and the chicken was very moist and delicious.  I added carrots and sweet potato to the potatoes and onion.  I also didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used 1tbs of Sherry and 1tbs of regular vinegar and it worked fine.  Like in other reviews, I covered the chicken with foil during the last 30 minutes of cooking.

This was really good and really easy.  Has so much flavor.  The potatoes soak up the marinade and have a wonderful taste.  I made it using 1/2 chicken, but will use whole chicken next time.  I can see adding baby carrots too.  Leftovers will be nice!

hands down one of my all time fave roasted chicken recipes; sooo very easy and it smells divine while cooking...I often omit the potatoes in lieu of another side dish.

So easy to prepare!  An excellent blend of flavors!!  I mixed 50-50 soy and teriyaki sauces, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Great Sunday dinner!!
