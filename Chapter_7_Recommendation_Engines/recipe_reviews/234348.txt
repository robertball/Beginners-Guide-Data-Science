Ultra Easy Pineapple Chicken Kabobs Made these even better...  instead of Chicken I just used Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage. Cooked them just through and completed as the direction say in the AR recipe. Served on a bed of Rice and Connie said, "This, we need to do again!"   #JvilleKitchens,  #6IngredientsOrLess with #JohnsonvilleSausage #AllstarsJville

VERY GOOD!  I used fresh pineapple in stead of chunks as I felt they would stay on the skewers better.  I was hesitant to use barbecue sauce as I felt teriyaki sauce would go better with the  pineapple.  I brush the barbecue sauce over the entire kabob looking for that sticky taste.   The flavor was good and I will make these again but I will use teriyaki sauce.  Thank you csiebe for sharing your recipe!

So simple but what a fantastic flavor combination!  I marinated the chicken and used fresh pineapple.  Fresh pineapple is amazingly easy to cut if you get some type of pineapple cutter.  I got mine through AVON, believe it or not--it takes about 60 seconds to use.

We doubled the chicken and the bell pepper, using several colors of bell pepper because that's what we had and using fresh pineapple.  Delicious.  We'll definitely make this again.  I'll try it with additional vegetables as suggested by one reviewer, and with various meats as suggested by a second reviewer.

Very good! Made as written...the flavors all went together nicely. I wasn't sure about brushing the bbq sauce on before cooking them, but it worked great and made a nice glaze on the kabobs. Served w/ rice and salad. I would def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Nice! Loved that I could make a tasty meal so easily and so quickly. I didn't have peppers, but didn't miss it. Used lots of pineapple with my chicken. Pineapple was delicious grilled with BBQ! I used sweet baby rays barbecue sauce but added a heafty shake of garlic powder. I put garlic in some form in most things! Served with grilled baked potatoes, which went well. Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent. My husband, who is a red meat kind of guy, really enjoyed this. I made a couple of minor changes. I marinated the chicken in pineapple juice for a couple of hours and substituted red for green pepper.  I will definitely make again.

Just made this yesterday -- lovely. Had quite a bit left over. decided to combine leftovers with gravy and serve over rice. THIS IS THE NEW DISCOVERY: Took a packet of chicken gravy and instead of mixing with a cup of water ... used a 1/2 cup of (leftover) pineapple juice and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. OK, and maybe a splash of Chardonnay. Absolutely outstanding. Will do this at the beginning from now on. Believe I will try this kabob recipe with smoked sausage next.

This was great!  I didn't have any bbq sauce so I used a ginger vinaigrette I had in the cupboard.  Next time I will be sure to try it with bbq sauce.

My sticks burned on the grill.  I think I read somewhere to soak them in water for 30 minutes before adding the meat and veggies.  Not sure if it works or not but will try that next time too.

So tasty and super easy to prepare & cook.  All the flavors went perfectly together.  The whole family gave this recipe rave reviews (even my super "picky eater" son).  Even though I did have to triple the recipe because there are four of us, there wasn't any leftovers.  We all agreed, however, that there could have been more chicken and onion in the mix.  So next time I will adjust accordingly.  This is a great weeknight dinner because of the ease of preparation, but it would also be wonderful for when company is over because of the flavors.

These were scrumptious.  Taking the advice of another reviewer,  I marinated the chicken in the BBQ sauce for about eight hours.  When it was time to assemble the kabobs I quartered a large onion, separated the petals and sweated them in EVOO so they'd be tender.  I threaded marinated chicken, fresh pineapple, onion petals and chunks of nectarine on the skewers, brushed them with more BBQ and gave them to my husband to grill.  Did they ever stick to the grate, even after oiling it well!  He cooked the kabobs five minutes per side, just the right length of time for the chicken, but they were a mess to turn.  Next time we will not brush additional sauce on until after they've been turned, maybe even serve more sauce at the table.  But this combo of flavors is exceptionally tasty and we'll definitely make it again!

This was great, but like others used teriyaki instead of BBQ sauce. Marinated chicken and peppers and pineapple for a 4 hrs first.

Absolutely loved this recipe! Even my picky son liked them. I used the drained juice from the pineapple, and a little soy sauce to soak the chicken in while I soaked my skuers. Delicious!

I did this with the ingredients suggested. But used chicken thighs cut into bite sized portions. All else was the same and did about 17 skewer on just a chicken thigh, an onion, a red pepper and some canned pineapples. Used the canned pineapple's juice mixed with barbecue sauce,  some Italian herbs, chilly sesame oil and a dash of pepper. This was indeed very good value for money. My partner loved it. So this has me as a fan.

I didn't make any changes just added on a couple of things. Not only did I have chicken I had shrimp and to spice it up a little more I jerked the chicken and shrimp, also following the recipe. I would have to say you must try it was delicious. "Definitely making this again. "

I served this at a small gathering this evening & it was a BIG hit! I made about 25-27 skewers. First I marinated in soy sauce for about an hour after assembling. I also wrapped the chicken on bacon. Who doesn't love bacon! 
Then I coated each skewer with a modified barbecue sauce  then baked in the oven until the bacon was crispy. 
My guests LOVED them!! So I'm thrilled with the results. Came out better than I expected. Will definitely prepare again.

I used thighs instead of breast, a whole onion instead of a half, and as it's winter, I cooked them in the frypan. I combined a bit of hot sauce to a smokey bbq sauce.  We loved them and they are now an addition to my repertoire.

A-MAZ-ING! So yummy!! I am not a fan of bell peppers or onions, especially in big chunks but I ate the bell peppers and onions up before the chicken and pineapple surprisingly. I will be making this again and very often!

I like to baste it with teriyaki sauce with a touch of low sodium soy sauce blended into the teriyaki instead of BBQ sauce. Some of the pineapple juice is also good blended into the baste (about 1 to 2 Tbsp.) Good served over stir-fried or just regular rice.

Simple recipe great flavours I prefer myself thigh fillet instead of breast it is more tender and juicier also better flavour  also if using wooden skewers soak them for an hour or two ahead of time in water. This will help prevent them burning on your bbq

This was a big hit at my house! I made some changes. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I seasoned the chicken & veggies with minced onion, Mrs. Dash, lemon pepper. I also added zucchini, yellow squash, red, orange & yellow bell peppers, onion, red potatoes. I used Sweet D's bbq sauce.

The only thing that was changed was I baked the kabobs in the oven at 400°.  Next time I make these it will be on a bbq.

This was super easy to fix and we loved it!  This will be made again several times through the summer grilling season.

I made this last night! I bought a whole pineapple and sliced it myself. Everything else I did like the directions. It turned out delicious! Even my picky kids liked it!

Solidly good!  Great summer comfort food.  I had a bottle of sweet baby ray's hawaiian bbq that needed to be used up and this was perfect.

Cooking 7 minutes per side was too long. The chicken was tough. Lower heat probably would help.

Quick, easy and delish.  We sprinkled with a little Johnnie's Dock and brushed with Sweet Baby Ray's Original BB'Q sauce.

I like this recipe but the longer you brine the chicken better the results are.

My family loved this recipe!  It was easy to make and very tasty.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sweetness of the pineapple tasted wonderful with the onion and pepper.  I have made these twice now, once for a barbecue with friends and family and they were a hit!
