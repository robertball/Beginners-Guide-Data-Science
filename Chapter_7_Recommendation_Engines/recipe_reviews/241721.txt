Better than my local French Bakery! 

I followed the directions as listed, except for using unsweetened cocoa powder to dust the top.  

I also brewed a strong pot of coffee,  allowed it to cool completely,  then added 2-3 shots of Kahlua. I then soaked Italian cookies in my coffee and rum mix and created layers with the Tiramisu Dip. 

It was less work than a traditional tiramisu,  but just as delicious.  soaking the cookies and layering added very little extra work.

Love this recipe! Delicious! I did not enjoy it with lady fingers but prefer it with vanilla wafers, cinnamon sugar pita chips, or grahams.

Made this for an office luncheon. Everyone loved it. Had to make a substitute for Marscapon cheese that I found online, as our grocery store was out. Served with some original biscotti chopped in half, and Pepperidge Farms  Bordeaux cookies. Yummy! Thanks!

I loved this. I recommend letting the mascarpone soften a bit before mixing.  I used semi sweet mini chocolate chips to garnish. Served with vanilla wafers.  On another occasion, I added some almond extract to give it a little amaretto flavor. 
I also plan on using this to frost a cake in the future.

I added two tablespoons of light rum and some cocoa powder. And eliminated the chocolate chips. I used it as a filling for chocolate cupcakes. Amazing!

Oh. My. Word. This just couldn't be any easier and is sooooo delicious. Made a double batch for our New Years Eve party, and our guests gobbled it up. Served with graham sticks and vanilla wafers. I personally think it could use a bit more coffee, but as the recipe is written, it has a subtle coffee flavor that is both adult and kid-friendly. Will be making this again soon!!

Used whipped cream instead of whipping cream and it worked out great!  It is light (not too sugary) and it tastes like tiramisu!  We used lady fingers to dip into it.

YUM!!!  Added a splash of Baileys Irish Cream for good measure and served in individual bowls over coffee/baileys soaked lady fingers.  Tastes like the real thing!

I am a Tiramisu fiend and love all tiramisu flavored things. 
 Loving the flavor, definitely better after it's chilled. I used decaf instant coffee and dusted with cocoa powder.

So easy and delicious. I made it and served it with fresh strawberries as they are in season. Tastes wonderful, like I worked really hard and it only took about 5 minutes to throw everything together.

Super fast and easy to make, and tastes great!  I dusted mine with cocoa powder instead of chocolate shavings.  We tried both vanilla wafers and graham sticks, but preferred the graham.

Easy and quick Tiramis√π. This is a nice way to serve a creamy, coffee flavoured dessert. It's also nice to make in small individual portions with some cookies on the side for a treat at a birthday party! It was perfect for our party where there were multiple guests who needed gluten free versions. Each with their own dish, no contaminating and no need to make two. Thank you for the recipe TracyR!
