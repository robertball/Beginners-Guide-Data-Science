I've been using the recipe for years. In the blender, use 1 can limeade, fill can with tequila and pour that in, a 'pour' of triple sec, if you have it, fill to top with ice and blend. Top glass with a squeeze of fresh lime juice.  You won't know when to stop!!!

My husband and I really liked these. For those who aren't sure; a jigger is a shot. These are a bit on the strong side so beware!

My husband has been using this recipe for years, however he substitutes the ice cubes for frozen strawberries that were fresh out of our garden.  Awesome!

what makes this recipe a five star is adding a can of beer to the mix at the end.  this cuts the sweetness of the limeaide and really kicks it up another notch.  try it , you'll like it !!!

We use 6 oz. Tequilla, 2 oz. Triple Sec and toss in 1 - 2 oz. Orange Juice to take out the 'bite'.  This is the BEST margarita recipe out there!

When I'm looking for a change.. this is how I make my Margaritas!  Try adding a tsp. of sugar and some fresh lime juice in the blender too.  These are also good on the rocks.. 1/2 shot of both alcohols and Sauza Margarita Mix.. Awesome!

Delish!  Hooray for no sweet & sour and minimal triple sec.  Just how I like it!
