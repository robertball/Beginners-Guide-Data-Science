I made this for a pizza party & a Christmas party and everyone loved it. I didn't have herb & garlic soup so I used my own similar seasonings. Served it with Townhouse parmesan cheese & garlic pita chips  & garlic toasted bagel chips. Delicious.

I used herb and garlic salad dressing packet because I couldn't find herb and garlic soup mix at the store.  Only used half of the packet.  This dip was a huge hit at our Xmas party!  Cheesy and delicious.
