Delish!!!  I followed this recipe to the T, the first few times I made it and the smoothies tasted great!  I definitely don't taste the spinach.  My only problem was I had to fight w/ my blender just to to get it to blend everything together.  I could eventually get it done, but it just took forever.  My sister finally told me that my problem was that I didn't have any liquid to help the blender process the ingredients.  So I've started adding 3/4 cups of pineapple juice to the recipe and voila!  No more fighting with my blender and the pineapple juice makes the smoothie even tastier!  Thanks for a great recipe, Janet.

I wrote this recipe.  I got the idea from all the raw food blogswhen trying to cure my asthma.  Spinach blends easier when frozen that is why I reccommended that.  I have a vitamix so I don't have to add liquid.  I do love this smoothie with pineapple juice as a few people have figured out.  I wouldn't say you need to measure anything just try variations and find what you love.  These are so healthy it feels good to drink them.  I never thought of adding yogurt or milk, but I'm glad people like it that way too.  For me the greener the better.  Plus my husband and son were both forced at first to try them and now they love them.  Thanks everyone.

These are a great, quick and easy green smoothie. I don't add any ice as long as the strawberries are frozen. I don't always add a banana either, but a little orange juice is great in there.

I love this recipe! I weight train 6 days a week and have this post workout with protein powder. I also substitute vanilla yogurt for nonfat plain yogurt. Delicious and easy I sometimes substitute different fruit, but always use the spinach.

Mmm, this was really good. Sounds odd with the spinach but you really can't taste it. I  use either frozen Kiwi (for a really green smoothie) or frozen peach in place of the banana.

I really loved this smoothie Janet! Seriously, if you closed your eyes so you had no clue what color this drink was, you would swear it was a pretty shade of pink! You can't taste the spinach at all and it was absolutely delicious! Yup, the color might put some people off, but it packs a punch of nutrition and tastes great so what's to complain about? I found that the banana I used was quite sweet so I didn't even need to use the honey.  Next time I'll be adding blueberries to the mix along with some flax seed. Thank you so much Janet!

This is a fantastic recipe!  Really pleased how it came out.  Skipped the honey, but used some fresh orange juice & a bit of water to get it going in the blender.  The spinach is barely noticeable - next time I'll add in a little more.

If you are expecting a milkshake, then you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for a great, sweet treat that makes you feel healthier just by drinking it, then you will love this.

This will become a regular for me!

Really great basic smoothie recipe!  I omitted the water and added 1/4 cup of plain greek yogurt and then about 1/2 cup of non-fat milk.  You can add more depending on the consistency you want.   I add the yogurt and milk to make it more filling and to hold me over til lunch.  I love this recipe because Im always so hungry in the morning and I usually gravitate towards heavy foods like pancakes or eggs and bacon.  If you drink this you immediately feel better about yourself,its filling so your not hungry two hours later, and it makes you more cautious about the food you continue to eat throughout the day. And btw, the honey kills the spinach taste so dont be nervous or put off!

As other reviewers pointed out, this recipe needs about 1/2 cup (or more, depending upon desired consistency) of water. I also didn't need the ice, because the berries were frozen (I would add ice if using fresh berries). I subbed frozen raspberries because that was all I had in the freezer and subbed agave nectar instead of honey. SUPER YUMMY and a great way to eat your spinach :)

Fantastic way to get the greens in! I didn't have any frozen strawberries, so I used frozen raspberries instead, and I used agave instead of honey. I needed some liquid to get it to blend, so I added a bit of soy milk. Also added a few tablespoons of flax oil for some added omega-3s. YUMMY!

I froze my spinach for an hour as the recipe said, but because I don't own a Vitamix, I knew I needed a little liquid for this to even blend.  I began with 1/2 cup pineapple juice and added the banana.  Then I added 1 cup of the spinach and blended and then added the other cup and blended. I added 1 cup of frozen strawberries and knew that there was no way I would be able to add more frozen berries, so I just added another cup of cold strawberries from my frig.  This was plenty thick, so I didn't need the ice.  Since I am not fond of honey, I didn't add it either and was satisfied with the sweetness. My only complaint is the ugly almost pale chocolate color.  Not green at all.

Ok...May sound crazy but here goes...I first blended dry uncooked rolled oats (about 1/2 cup) in blender until fine. then added the spinach, one carrot, kewi, peach and pineapple. I also added a few frozen cherries with the ice (i like it cold). To avoid having the fix-ins just "sit" in the blender and not move while on, I added a bit of orange juice. REALLY GOOD!

I use this for the base of my smoothie recipes. I love it because it really fills you up! Started out with the original recipe (still 5 stars) and catered it to what I usually have on hand. I use 1/2 frozen banana, 1 - 1 1/2 cups spinach, 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, 4 frozen strawberries, 1/2 cup milk and a bunch of ice. Whiz it up and drink it all for breakfast

This smoothie is FABULOUS!  I make it for me and my almost 3 year old daughter for breakfast - we both love it!  NO ALTERATIONS. FOLLOWED EXACTLY.  I have a Vitamix which blends it fantastically.  I also made one with kale.  It's good too, but the spinach one is better.

Love this!  I originally tried this for St. Patrick's Day, but the strawberry/spinach combo made brown (even with extra green food coloring).  So the color isn't truly green, but it got my 3 & 5 year olds to eat spinach, so it's a keeper!  I lowered the honey to a little over 1 Tbsp & added protein powder.   Will be making again & again!

Accidentally added two bananas; they had both been frozen. Did not add ice - almost everything was frozen anyway! I added a little over a cup of apple cider to help it blend. Only added one TBS honey. With the apple cider, not sure if any sweetener is needed.

Both my girls (5 & 8) asked me to add more spinach next time; that in itself makes this a 5 star recipe :)
I used a few splashes of apple juice to help blend everything together. Could not taste the spinach at all! Even my picky husband drank it and said tasted like strawberry/banana smoothie. Ours came out more brown than green. Next time I'll add extra spinach and half the strawberry. Do not think the honey is needed so will skip that too!

I didn't use have any bananas and I used a vanilla EAS low carb protein shake to add some liquid and it was still quite tasty. I've always been skeptical of drinking my veggies but this has won me over!

Awesome idea/recipe!
Solution to weak blenders: add ~1cup dairy (milk/yogurt) or juice

Also, throw in 1/2 cup oats for a great run-out-the-door breakfast drink (you will hardly taste it).
Mwahaha, those kids will never know they drank some mighty healthy stuff :)

I love this recipe I have been making these for about 6 months and just saw the recipe online today! I don't use ice or honey but I do add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup white grape or apple juice to it instead. The apple juice tastes a little bit better, since it is sweeter.  Sometimes I'll add flax.  It really depends how you like it, mine is thinner than most smoothies.

This was very very good.  I thought I would try this since I had some leftover spinach that I wanted to use up.  I was a little skeptical, but my little kids(3 and 2) are even asking for more myself included.  I will be adding this to my recipe box.  The original recipe was perfect.  I just added an orange since I have an abundance of oranges.  That was great also.  Thank you Janet!!

You can actually taste the spinach in this one in comparison to other recipes I've tried, but it's more of a fresh than a gross taste. Also, it really needs some liquid, and the spinach doesn't have to be frozen. You could add water, milk, "Green" juice, apple juice, etc. Also, the honey was a bit much. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent smoothie! Since I used frozen fruit, I added a little soy milk to make it easier in the blender. I also added 1/2 scoop of protein powder. The kids loved it.

Not enough liquid to make a smoothie. It only worked after adding a cup of liquid. I don't understand by people don't rate the actual recipe.

Knowing that this was going to be rather thick  I ditched the ice since the strawberries were frozen and added 6 oz. pineapple juice and about 1/2 cup orange juice (didn't measure) I used my vitamix and this was blended to a smooth consistency within a minute. I will make this again. A cool refreshing treat that helped satisfy my sweet tooth tonight. Thank you janetk.

I make this but have used a variety of different things. I use a pear, banana and spinach, with some milk or yogurt. Tastes like a pear.  I have also used the mixed berries and it tastes like the McDonalds version and a little bit purple. Great smoothie and so good for you, also fills you up and keeps you full.

WARNING: This is very difficult to blend with a regular blender.  Put the banana and ice chips (and I added a bit of water) in first, then the spinach, and the strawberries in last, adding just a few at a time.

The only difference I made was sub regular sugar for the honey because I was out. I used about 1 tablespoon sugar. This was what was for dinner last night with a sclice of homemade banana bread. The kids liked it a lot. I love the idea of drinking fresh, raw spinach and not even tasting it! Heres yet another great way to add raw green veggies to our diets on this site! Thanks

This is great!  Can't taste the spinach at all.  I did add some orange crystal light to help it blend more smoothly.  Forgot to add in the honey, but it was still great!  Another variation if you want it more creamy, would be to add about 1/2 cup of yogurt (vanilla would be my choice). This will be my new favorite smoothie!

I just made this for my kids.  Didn't have frozen strawberries so used a combo of frozen cranberries, raspberries, and blueberries.  Also used a frozen (vs. non-frozen) banana.  Cut the ice back to 1/2 cup and added about 1 to 1 1/2 cups water.  The color was a deep purple (rather than green) and the kids loved it.  Great way to get spinach in their diet!

I was so pleasantly surprised by this recipe!!  I have been looking for a smoothie recipe with some healthy greens added and yet still tasted like a smoothie "should" (yummy of course!) and without a bunch of added calories from sugar or juice.  I made this smoothie after a run and added a scoop of protein powder.  I added a little extra ice and about a 1/4-1/2 cup of water to offset the powder, and it turned out awesome!  I also didn't freeze the spinach, but did have a frozen banana (for this such occasion!).  I have a vitamixer and it blended up great!!  I will definitely make again for my kids to try!!

This was good.  Really thick, even after adding milk.  I told my kids it was ice cream and they ate it up.  Probably would try another smoothie recipe instead of this one again.

Creative way to make use of spinach and tastes good.   When I made it looked very green and didn't need as much honey, the fruit contributed a lot to the sweetness imho.

Our turned out much greener than the picture, but my husband isn't one for measuring. All three kids thought it looked gross, one refused to even try it. Amazingly enough he relented and the smoothie was GREAT! I am making this again for sure.

Yum! First try with this smoothie, and it was so delicious! But instead of honey, I used agave. I had no problem blending, but that might just be because I was using a vitamix. You can't taste the spinach at all, and the banana makes the smoothie nice and creamy. Again, especially nice using a vitamix because it liquified the seeds. Great idea for the kids, my daughter loved it!

Great base recipe! No need to freeze the spinach - I used fresh and it was great. I didn't add any ice because the frozen strawberries made it cold and slushy enough on their own and I wanted a more intense fruity flavor. Definitely add pineapple juice (1/3-1/2 cup) to help the smoothie blend and to add a little more sweetness.

Very good - I used agave instead of honey (I'm out of honey).  Only had frozen bananas, so added a bit of water to make it blend properly (a fair amount, about a cup).  Skipped the ice altogether, it didn't need it.

i'm severely anemic throughout this pregnancy and my doc suggested that i eat more spinach and iron rich foods - this smoothie is just what i was needing with a splash of OJ to absorb the iron into my system :) you really can't taste the spinach. and since i don't have to cook the spinach i feel i'm drinking 100% of its nutrients!! thanks for the recipe janet ;)

Wow is this green.  I had some leftover thawed spinach (about 3/4 cup) and made this smoothie.  It was not my favorite of all that I made, but in all fairness I will try again with fresh spinach.

YUM!!!! I just bought a blendtec blender and the order in which you put the ingredients in matters! Putting the banana and spinach in first helps it blend... I also used water instead of ice and added the strawberries last. The first time I made this, I used honey, the second time, I used agave and it tasted the same both times. Thanks for this great recipe!

YUMMY!  Made for my husband and daughters.  They loved it, as did I.  I used fresh spinach from my garden and instead of all strawberries, I used half strawberries and half rasberries.  I also used a splash of pineapple juice to thin it and followed the rest of receipe.  Now I have another way to use all the spinach that is coming up!  Thanks so much for a great smoothie~~~~

Made the recipe as stands.  It was tasty, but I think next time I will cut it with ice to make it a bit more watery.  The texture was very yogurty which I'm not a fan of.  However, the hubs practically licked his glass clean.

Delicious.  I didn't have time to freeze the strawberries and spinach, but it turned out great anyway.  I added a Tbsp. maraschino cherry juice and a half cup frozen vanilla yogurt to make it creamier.  My 8 year old loved it so much he's taking the recipe to school for show and tell.

I love this smoothie recipe. For a protein-packed adult  version, blend:  cup of yogurt or organic non fat milk 1/3 cup or less of egg beaters or similar splash of vanilla powder or extract (powder the best) handful of fresh spinach 3 - 4 fresh strawberries 1 fresh banana 1 scoop organic cold milled flax  Enjoy!

The recipe itself gets four stars.  You really need some liquid to blend the ingredients together, or you will burn out the motor on your blender!  But the idea and the blend of fruit and honey gets five stars!  What a great way to get some fantastic nutrients into your diet!  My husband and I loved this!  My two year old hardly touched it, but I think that's because she was having trouble sipping it through a straw and refused to drink it any other way.  I added quite a bit of orange juice so I could blend it, but it was still too thick.  I think next time I will reduce the amount of strawberries and spinach to a cup and a half each and use fresh strawberries rather than frozen to see if I can get it to a consistency that can be sipped through a straw.  I'm also thinking of trying some vanilla frozen yogurt or vanilla yogurt and vanilla soy milk rather than juice to make it more like a milk shake so I can more easily tempt my picky toddler with it.  Thanks for a great idea!  I will have fun experimenting with this one!

I was looking for a quick recipe in the am due to my horrible habit of not eating breakfast and being famished by 11am!  This is wonderful.  I did add yogurt for the protein and to make it more filling.  IMO you do not need the honey - its sweet enough as is.  I also didn't use ice as I froze the banana and spinach together.  You cannot taste the spinach.  It really is a wonderful, quick breakfast or snack!

I've been trying to add more potassium to my diet so I was looking for recipes with spinach. Not only could I not taste the spinach in this it tasted so great that my husband, daughter, and myself LOVE it, and my daughter and I are picky eaters. I did add pineapple juice for liquid and left out the ice. I think next time I will use Splenda in place of honey to cut calories and carbs. But I just wanted to say THANK YOU for the wonderful recipe!

This was very good and I like the fact that I didn’t need yogurt.  I didn’t have a banana so I used an orange instead.  It was really thick and looked just like the name implied but it was oh so yummy and nutritious that I will definitely make again.

Made this exactly as written....it was way too thick. I had to add a cup of OJ to get it to smoothie consistency. Also, the color of the smoothie was less than appealing (it came out a weird brown with green specks), but otherwise, loved it and was truly surprised that it had 2 cups of spinach...which I didn't taste at all. Can't wait to make it again and have my 3 year old try it. Have my fingers crossed that he will like it! Nothing better than sneaking veggies in when your child hates almost every veggie there is.

I ended up with a brown sorbet. I added some orange juice.  It needed some type of liquid. Tasted great but unfortunately the color and texture scared off my kids from trying it.   I will try it again and hopefully end up with that recipe picture.

Really liked the flavor. I had to add about 1/2 cup of water because the consistency was similar to a very thick salsa. After the water was added it was like a milkshake that had to be eaten with a spoon. The color was brown, not green. Next time I won't freeze the spinach to see if it is less thick. I used the Ninja 1500 watt blender. Easy to make. I would definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Not an appetizing color for a smoothie, flavor was o.k. though. I'm sure adding more spinach and less strawberries would improve the color, but would change the taste considerably. I also had to thin. Not my favorite sorry.

Tasty! You have to drink it fairly soon after making it. I made the mistake of making a lot and storing the leftover to drink later and it was not good. Follow the directions and serve immediately like it states and it is wonderful!

I would have given this 5 stars except that I too needed to add orange juice otherwise it wouldn't mix (although that could have been bc of my blender as well, it's just a basic one).  Tastes FABULOUS!! I will be adding more spinach next time but this was the perfect amt for my first time trying a smoothie!

So I made this after I made a horrible creation of my own. I made this with a blender assuming everyone tries w a blender (silly me) and like another person said had the hardest time blending nonetheless it was good but 1 serving only got me like 4 ounces... that's like the very bottom of the blender); hope to try again maybe w pineapple juice.

This was my first try at a "green" smoothie and this recipe looked easy enough.  I used fewer strawberries and threw in a couple of clementines and only half a banana.  I left out the sweetener because I wanted to taste it first, and for me the spinach was a little strong but some agave nectar toned it down. I did add the ice but no other liquid and the consistency was perfect in the Vitamix. What a great way to get your greens! I will be making this often.

I just made this for my breakfast.  It is delicious, and thank you for sharing.  I needed to add water and prod it with a spoon a bit before it would blend.  I used frozen chopped spinach from the frozen veggie isle of the supermarket - big time saver.  Then I also added a handful of powdered milk.  Taste = 5 stars! 4 stars because it doesn't blend as is.

I love this this recipe and even better my kids (5, 3 and 1) love it too! 

I've never had to add liquids to it, but I do let it blend in my food processor for about 10 minutes before I serve.  

It's loud and 10 minutes may seem a lot for a smoothie, but I just put it in then go upstairs and wake my kids up and get them dressed. When we come downstais it's ready to go.

Yummy, I added yogurt and milk to help with the consistency. It definitely looked like green slime, though unfortunately my girl didn't like it after trying it. She said it tasted like strawberries and spinach. Ha. But I enjoyed it.

Great recipe!  I added mango and OJ to make it tropical and added applesauce instead of honey.  I also added in some flax.  My 2 year old loved it!!!  Great way to sneak in some veggies.

I also found that I can substitute kale and chard in this recipe for all or some of the spinach.  It is a good way to use up my extra garden produce.  I didn't freeze it, but I have a champ blender and it is no problem blending it.  I use frozen whatever I have in the freezer at the time and add different protein powders.  I don't find I need a sweetener with the banana.   I want to cut back on carbs with higher glycemic index.  This is a great way to hide all kinds of good things and eat and run.

Delicious! Mine turned out a darker pink color with specks of green, not "slime green" colored as in the picture. I added 6 oz (3/4 cup) pineapple juice as one recommendation suggested. All other ingredients were the same-- 2 cups each of frozen spinach & frozen strawberries, 1 banana, 2 tbsp honey and 1/2 cup ice.

This is a good and nutritious smoothie, but it definitely did have a little spinach-y aftertaste. (And I didn't use quite as much spinach as it called for.) For me, I didn't mind at all, but I had to add in some extra banana and some strawberry yogurt for my husband.  The color was a little off-putting for him, but I thought it was yummy and will make this again.  Definitely needs a little liquid in order to blend well if, like me, you don't have a top of the line blender.  I used a little strawberry banana juice which was a nice addition.

I love the idea of adding such a nutritious green leaf veggie to the smoothies.  I try to make all kinds of different combinations,but the one fruit I always put in all of them is chopped pineapple.  I cut it up and freeze in little bags so they are ready when I make my smoothies.  It adds such a good flavor to any smoothie. Bananas are good when you want extra sweetness without adding much sugar.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST - so easy to make this green smoothie.  I didn't use the honey though I'm sure that would be excellent.

This smoothie tasted great but my smoothie did not come out as green but more brownish so I couldn't really call it Green Slime Smoothie.  I forgot to freeze the spinach so maybe that had something to do with it.  It was very hard to get my blender going in the beginning as one of the readers mentioned so I added a little bit of lemonade and that did the trick.  Anyway, great tasting smoothie but if your tasters are vegetable haters, don't tell them about the spinach or they will not even try it!  You can't taste it anyway.  Great way to get your servings of vegetables.  :)

Strawberries+bananas+spinach= amazing combination. I use the ingredients listed here though I tend to vary the quantities however I feel like it- I've already made 3! And I omit the honey- ripened bananas do the trick for sweetness. Really genius, I feel so healthy drinking it. I've also added blackberries and grapes!

Yummy! My husband hates spinach, so I gave it to him without him knowing what's in it. He liked it! Yay! I bought a bag of fresh Spinach wondering what to do with it.. so now I will drink my spinach! My blender doesn't like to blend stuff with no liquid, so I added a little of apple juice, and soy milk.

I halved the spinach and the honey and it tasted very good.  Next time I will add a little more spinach and honey and gradually work my way up to the 2 cups.  2 cups of spinach seemed like too much, but it would probably be fine with more than just the 1 cup I put in.
