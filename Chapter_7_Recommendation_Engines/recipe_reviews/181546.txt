This is a great idea!  I experimented with chocolate cake and raspberry flavored gelatin.  It was not as visually striking because we couldn't really see the raspberry, but it tasted great.  Next time, I'll try a vanilla or white cake with strawberry or raspberry jello. : )

I use sugar free jello and light cool whip and I have to keep my hubby from eating the whole thing.  He asks for it on his birthday every year.  Absolutely wonderful with all kinds of flavors.

I LOVE this recipe! I like it with lemon cake mix and orange jello. It's great for summer! I've also done lemon raspberry and it's so fabulous. This cake is moist and fresh. Delish.

I made this when my best friend and her 2 girls came for a visit on Spring Break.  Used yellow cake (made per directions on the box), and added strawberry gelatin b/c strawberries were more in season here.  Everyone loved it - much to my surprise the biggest fan was my husband.  Very cool, moist, and refreshing from the usual cake routine.  Great idea as an alternative to chocolate for those who don't like/can't have it too.  EASY!  And EASY and tasty are the best combination  with kids.

Super simple and easy to make for guests.  It's a nice, light finish to a meal.  I used strawberry jello and fresh strawberry slices on top instead of raspberry.

This recipe is extremely easy, and our 4 year old daughter loves to help "poke" the cake before we pour the gelatin on the top. I use real whipping cream with vanilla, instead of the frozen kind in the tub because I like the taste better, there is no added sugar, and our daughter loves to lick the beaters after we whip the cream. My husband loves to eat this cake, and even went so far as to call it "refreshing."

My mother-in-law eat this cake as a child, and it brought back a lot of memories! I dont know why it calls for 3 egg whites? But the cake was really good, and VERY easy to make! I used strawberry gelatin, and fresh strawberrys instead of the raspberrys because they werent in season where I am.  I really enjoyed this cake Thank you!

This cake is easy and refreshing. I love that it's extra moist because of the jello.
