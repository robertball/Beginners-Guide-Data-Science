WOW! I've never ground my own beef for burgers, but with it being such a beautiful day today (finally!), I wanted to try something special. These were simple enough to make and you could really taste the difference in the meat. We loved the sauce and just everything about this burger was an absolute hit! I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe tastes good, but I feel it misses the point; a delicious blend of tasty beef.  Be simple.  When I make this blend, I toast the buns and spread mayo on the bottom half of each bun followed by some fresh ground pepper.  Two minutes before grilling the burgers, sprinkle 1/4 tsp. salt on each one then place salt side down on the grill.  Salt again 2 minutes before turning.  When the hot burger is placed on the bottom half of the bun, the mayo and pepper combine to make a complementing sauce. That's it.  Place bun tops on and enjoy a great beef burger. If  you must put something else on, a little fresh lettuce tomato and onion on top of the patty wont kill it.  Also, I have found that a 5 oz. patty is a perfect amount of beef for this blend.  It's a burger for the gods.
