I'm not diabetic, but I need a low-fat diet.  This feels like an indulgence, but it's actually good for you, especially with the fruit!

I agree with the first reviewer I used real eggs and cream. I not sure I would do it all the time but every once in a while you gotta live a little.

It's a neat idea.  I did make some changes though.  First off, I dropped the cottage cheese and increased the ricotta to 1/2 cup.  I also used real eggs instead of the substitute.  Then, after I spread the cheese mixture into the bread pockets, I spread about a tsp of seedless raspberry jam inside the pockets and cooked as directed.  I served it with a little drizzle of real maple syrup.  It's really good but HEAVY.  Hubby (who loves french toast) made it through one, I couldn't finish mine.

It's a nice treat but not an every weekend kind of dish.

It is not very often that I make French toast. 
Especially stuffed.
I decided to try this one for a Sunday Brunch.
Everyone loved it! It's very heavy. I actually made mine with less ricotta cheese and added more cream cheese for a cream cake taste. I used a sweetner instead of sugar and low fat milk. 
This lessened the calories, but still gave it plenty of flavor.

My family loves this recipe!!!!  I make a double or triple batch and freeze what we don't eat.  They warm up well in the oven.  I can't remember what I warm them up on, but try 350 for about 7 min. Watch them because I would hate to have you burn them because I couldn't remember.

We thought it was pretty good, my very picky 12 yr. old liked it a lot.  I used 2 eggs and a little low-fat milk in place of the egg substitute, which is quite expensive.  3 cups would be a lot wasted.  I also sprinkled a little cinnamon in with the egg/milk mixture.

If you are looking for a delicious breakfast to serve to your overnight guests, you may want to try this.  I thought it was one of the best breakfast recipes I have tried.  I used real eggs and 1% milk, and gave it plenty of time to soak into the bread.   After it started to brown, I used a cover on the pan to make sure it was cooked throughout.   Itâ€™s very pretty sprinkled with powder sugar and served with sliced fruit and real maple syrup.

This was FANTASTIC. I used Challah bread instead of french bread, and half and half instead of the evaporated milk. Served with fresh raspberries, this is better than most anything you could get at a restaurant. Perfecto! :)

Delicious...it could be messy if you are not careful, but just make sure the slices are thick enough and you'll be fine.  I loved this.  Added some cinnamon to the egg mixture and sprinkled powdered sugar on top. I had mine with real maple sugar and the fiancee had hers with caramel syrup.

This recipe is awsome!!! Even if you dont like breakfast like me try it you'll love it. But I do have to agree with others that have reviewed this recipe instead of eggs and a heavy cream substitute.

This recipe was great!  I couldn't find french bread or any other thick kind, so I ended up using two slices of plain bread to contain the filling.  As for the filling, I didn't spend much time mixing it so it came out pretty chunky... but that worked pretty well too.  After frying them I warmed them in the oven to melt the cheeses.  Topped with butter, confectioner's sugar and blackberries, and everybody loved them.

Nice flavor but i found it difficult to stuff them. I used homemade bread, making the slices thick, with the thought being that it would be easier to make the pocket. Not the case. I couldn't seem to make a nice pocket and ended up making a mess. The end product tasted good, even though some of the surprise was on the outside!

I used ricotta cheese and cream cheese, as I have no cottage cheese on hand. I have made French Toast before using either one of the cheeses, but had not tried both together - it was WONDERFUL!
Instead of cutting and stuffing the bread, I simply made sandwiches with the bread and cheese mixture - that worked great, too!

I used real eggs and regular milk. I also added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla extract to the cheese and the egg/milk mixtures.

EXCELLENT! A definite keeper!

Awesome recipe! Definitly give the bread time to soak a bit in the egg mixture, they will cook so much better. I double the filling every time, i just love the filling too much lol.
