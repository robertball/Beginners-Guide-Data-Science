I made this cheesecake for the first time today and it is a very good recipe but I will make some changes for the next time I make it.  *First- make sure to "underbake" the yellow cake layer.  I baked mine as per the recipe but I found it came out too dry and the bottom was too brown & was very crumbly.  I had to slice off the bottoms for each slice as i served it.  *Second- make sure to "underbake" your cheesecake layer.  I shut off the oven ten minutes before the timer was supposed to go off and let the cake sit in the oven till the oven cooled down.  The cake had puffed up and then sank in the middle.  Which is what you want it to do (for this recipe, anyway)  It created a nice "well" for the chocolate frosting.  It made for a nice presentation.  Mine didn't look anything like the picture.  *Third- I had to add another tablespoon of butter and milk to the frosting to get it to a spreadable consistency. *Fourth- you definitely have to refrigerate the cake to let it set- but pull the cake out out of the fridge 30 minutes before you serve it.  Otherwise the cake will be too firm and the cheesecake and the chocolate layers will separate when cutting into it.  Wait till the cake is more pliable to handle.  This cake tasted very good!  (who doesn't like cake AND cheesecake AND chocolate?)  and like I said, this was a good recipe but I think with some minor changes it could be a 5 star recipe.

This cheesecake makes you look like a professional chef, and it really is a simple process.  I made a regular sized box cake mix and just poured 1/2 into the springform pan - then made the rest into cupcakes.  I baked for about 20 minutes.  I let this cool completely, like 8 hours.  Then made the cream cheese filling as stated and baked for almost an hour.  I let this cool and then chilled in the refrigerator overnight.  The next morning I made the chocolate glaze, spread it onto the cake and returned to the refrigerator.  I was taking this to a potluck and I removed it from the refrigerator about 1/2 hour before leaving.  It softened just enough to be creamy and the chocolate wasn't hardened at all.  It went over very well and tasted great!

I made this recipe for Christmas and it was fabulous!  The only problem that I had was that I bought a normal sized box of cake mix, and after filling the 9" springform pan with the batter, the pan was full to the top.  I reread the directions and it calls for a 9 oz box of cake mix, not a normal size 18 oz box.  (I don't know where you would buy a 9 oz box of mix as I have never seen one).  So, luckily I had a couple of bigger springform pans, so I dumped the batter into the biggest one I had (which might be 11").  I was afraid of overbaking the cake before the cheesecake layer went in the oven, but it turned out great!  I will make this again in the future (in the bigger springform pan, of course!).

My personal favorite! I've made this several times with the Jiffy 9oz cake mix (it is on the dry side) but found just making a whole batch of the regular 18 oz (and using 1/2) yellow cake mix is moister. I waaay undercook the cake at first...just enough so the cake supports the cheesecake mixture. It is really, really moist this way. It is a little wasteful, unless you are like me and will bake the remaining cake mix and snack on that while your cheescake sets!!

Very good stuff! I am a HUGE fan of boston cream pie AND cheesecake and the only place that I have found that sells this is the Cheesecake Factory. I was thrilled to see I can make it myself! I made this over the holidays and as another reviewer discovered, a regular box of cake mix is too much! I still proceeded to make the recipe with the entire cake mix. The problem I ran into......the cake was undercooked when I placed the cream cheese filling in so it became a HUGE mess. When it was all said and done, it all baked and tasted great, it just was not at all worthy of a picture! I will surely make this again and use only half the cake batter!

I followed the recipe exactly, the cake was so dry, Boston Cream is one of my favorites, this one just didn't work for me.

I didn't have my spring form pan since it was at the cottage, so I used my 9 x 13. I think it turns out better because the cake doesn't get over baked. I lined the pan with foil, baked the cake layer for 10 minutes, then baked the cheesecake layer for 30 minutes. Let cool overnight in the fridge, then lifted out on a platter and frosted. A big hit!

Made this for an Easter dessert, and everyone loved it. Not too sweet but very rich and creamy. Big thanks to Cher for the Jiffy cake tip!

Made this for my mom's birthday.  Everyone seemed to enjoyed it.  I think if I make it again I will use a 10 in. springform pan.  I started with a 9 in. and used half of the cake mix, but if I had added the cheesecake mix, it would have overflowed, so used the second half of the cake mix in a 10 in. pan.  Also will bake longer than 45 min., the cheesecake was not firm in the middle.  Can't decide if I am crazy about the cake/cheesecake combo, but may give it another chance.

I loved it! I made this and took it to school with me and it was a HUGE hit with the teachers, too. I didn't change anything except I only had a regular sized vanilla cake and I made it according to directions, and then only used half of it. The other half my kids enjoyed!

Super easy recipe! turned out marvelously! I have tried variations of using a chocolate cake base and adding chocolate to the cheesecake filling - also scrumptious!  

A definite must for cheesecake (and Boston Cream pie) lovers!

This is my first review.  I read all the reviews before making this cake.  I made it for the first time for our Day before Thanksgiving dinner.  It was absolutely amazing.  Only thing is that everything was really not set in the center.  No one cared, but once we cut into it, it looked more like a cream cake (or pie) than a firm cake with a firm cheesecake layer above (maybe that's why it's called Boston CREAM).  I guess I would cook everything a little longer next time.  I would absolutely make this again.  It was beautiful and not too hard at all.  I took one reviewer's excellent advice and cooled every layer before starting the next one.  Each layer is easy to create.  I cooked cake for 15 mins (will go for 25 next time), and both layers for 45 (will probably do an hour next time).  Also, note, the chocolate layer WILL SLIDE, even after being in the fridge for 6 hours or so.  Thank you so much for posting this!!  A total keeper.

This cheesecake is amazing. It is the perfect balance of cake, cheesecake and chocolate but it is very rich. I used half a regular cake mix for the bottom layer and baked it until it was just barely solid (maybe 15 min?). I used light cream cheese, fat-free sour cream and 2 eggs and 1 egg worth of egg beaters to make the cheesecake portion a little healthier (I bet you could use applesauce in the cake but I didn't think about it until after). I let everything cool completely before I put the icing on. It was delicious and everyone loved it! Thanks!

This was really good. I didn't like after it was refridgerated the chocolate topping got really hard and broke off from the cheesecake and the center was a little soggy, that might have been my fault. I followed everything exactly.

This would be 5 stars except that I did not like the chocolate topping, it had a bitter tang to it. Also, I do not recommend underbaking the cheesecake, unless you want to risk getting food poisoning.

Very good! I wish the cake portion was more moist. I wish I could give it 4 and a half stars. 5, I consider unbelievable. I would make this again. I am a sucker for cheesecake. And this one is a keeper in my book.

Delicious even though I ended up making a couple of changes (didn't have all the ingredients).  I used half the box of pineapple cake mix and used 2 packages cream cheese + 8 oz. ricotta.  Despite these substitutions, this was still really really good!  I will make this again except I will make sure I have all the ingredients on hand first:)

This recipe was excellent exactly as written and made a beautiful cake! I couldn't find a jiffy cake mix, so I just used half a regular box of yellow cake mix. The chocolate topping was especially good and was easy to spread. My cheesecake and chocolate topping stayed soft enough that they were easy to cut straight from the refrigerator.
