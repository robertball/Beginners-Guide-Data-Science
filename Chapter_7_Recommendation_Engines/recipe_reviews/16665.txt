Try This!  Use 3 heaping tablespoons of mayo, 1 heaping tablespoon of mustard (any type), omit onion, maybe add pickle, and save paprika for sprinkling on the sandwich when serving.  I like it served on toast.  Not a bad recipe when modified a little.  I was so glad to find a ratio of eggs to other ingredients here.  It sure beats just trying to work magic at the kitchen counter!

I hate mayo so I was looking for a flavorful egg salad without a lot of mayo.  I used sour cream instead of the mayo.  I used 2 chopped spring onions instead of the regular onion and it was perfect!

This is a good egg salad recipe as is if you're looking for a recipe that isn't too wet. I prefer mine with a little more mayo so I made some alternations. I added more onion and used white instead of red because it is what I had, chopped 2 ribs of celery for a little more crunch, and added a few more tablespoons of mayo. I cut the eggs in large chunks and then squished it with a fork some, still chunky. I don't care if it is pink from the paprika, this salad is wonderful!  Thank you for sharing.

Excellent recipe.  Do double the mayo, and add celery, and do remember that red onions come in various sizes so keep that in mind while preparing this.  For this I used probably just under 1/4 cup and used an equal amount of celery.  I used honey dijon and fresh dill.....yummy.  Excellent on whole wheat bread with a nice piece of romaine lettuce.  The teens even ate this for breakfast before school!  Thanks Margret!

I made this 2 ways one your way without the onions and my husband really liked it. The second way I added 3 tablespoons mayo and 1 celery stalk chopped up very fine,4 gherkin pickles chopped fine, 1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard and 1 teaspoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon dillweed, 1/2 teaspoon yellow mustard, a couple pinches of onion salt, a pinch of garlic salt, and a sprinkle of lawrys with black pepper. My husband loved it and my kids loved it as well. I mixed it in with bow tie pasta for the little ones.

A half of an onion is WAY too much,  the first time i made it i  followed the recipe exactly and all you could taste is onion, so i tossed it and did it again with 2 tbsp. of mayo and about a quarter of a red onion and it was much better :)

Very tasty! I replaced the onion with celery for spice-sensitive kids, and cut down the mustard. To keep it lower fat, I also left out a couple of the egg yolks, but to maintain the creaminess I added a little plain yogurt. Just great.

No matter how you slice it, a tablespoon of mayonnaise just won't be enough for eight eggs...unless you're talking robin eggs!  Certainly add the mayonnaise to taste - what's not enough for one person might be more than enough for another -but not one tablespoon. Other than that this isn't bad for a basic egg salad - the dill and Dijon are very nice additions.  However, I didn't use the paprika.  I tried that once in another recipe and didn't like it; it gave the egg salad an unbecoming color.  I coarsely chopped rather than mashed the eggs, as the idea of mashed eggs didn't appeal to me.  For a little less bite and a lot more color I added chopped green onion rather than the red.  I also mellowed out the tang of the mayonnaise (I did use considerably more than the amount directed) by adding a dollop of sour cream.  Last but not least, I tossed in some celery, as in my mind no egg salad is complete without it.

This recipe is perfect the way it is.  I'm not sure why people "review" a recipe, but only say how they changed it completely.  If you made up your own, put it on the website!  This egg salad though was great, perfect for summer.

Really thought this is a great recipe for taste.  I did a few things differently.  I added a bit more mustard and mayo than it said because it looked dry for my taste.  Also, I would recommend FRESH dill weed.  Since I used a spice jar it didn't seem to have as much flavor as I think it could have as if it were fresh.  Otherwise, I love having onions in it!

I just made this recipe for lunch and I love it. It is very light but has enough kick to it. I added just a hint of olive oil to mine. Well done!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Unfortunately, I ended up throwing it all in the garbage. First of all, 10 min. was not long enough to let the eggs set covered in the hot water. The yolks were not cooked thoroughly. With 1 tsp. of dill weed and a half of a red onion, the taste was entirely too strong. I had an onion taste in my mouth for the rest of the day. Definitely not recommended. The reddish color was unappealing as well.

This is a good basic Egg Salad recipe.  You can do many different things.  I used Spicy Brown Mustard, chopped up a dill pickle and omitted the dill herb.  It is wonderful!  I will be having this for lunch tomorrow and it won't be the last time I make it.

I thought this egg salad was awesome!  Because my husband does not like egg salad, I scaled the recipe down-I used 4 eggs, 1 1/2 T mayonnaise, 1T Honey mustard, 1/2tsp dried dill weed, and chopped up some red onion (eye balled it) and mixed it all together.  I am having this for lunch right now on top of my salad, and it's great.  The dill weed really makes the egg salad!!  Thank you Margaret for a great recipe--will be my standard egg salad from now on!

Too much mustard and not enough mayo. Added more mayo so it wouldnt be so dry and unspreadable. Also the paprike did make it a funny color. Egg salad should be yellow and not pinkish red. In the end it looked unedible and was only mediocre after making changes.

This recipe is devine!  If you like deviled eggs, you'll love this.  It's basically like eating chopped up devilled eggs.  Tweak it to suit your tastes - it's awesome!  Thanks Margret!

I like mustard, but it's way too much in this recipe. 1 tbsp of mustard to 3 mayo worked well. Also cut red onion by at least half.  Great idea, just needs some tweaking:)

This is a very simple egg salad to make with the added bonus of it having a pleasingly unique blend of flavors.  I especially like the dill flavor, and since there isn't a lot of mayonnaise in it, the salad doesn't have mayo overload.  My husband didn't care for the onion, but did suggest maybe a Vidalia onion might be more tasty. I found the onion to add zest.  I would definitely make this again!

A nice, elegant egg salad (or as elegant as egg salad can be). I doubled the mayo and left out the onion because my family doesn't like raw onion. Sprinkle the paprika on top to avoid pink salad.

My kids are on this whole egg salad kick lately. I used a little of the red onion I had leftover from making salsa, increased the mayonnaise a bit, added a bit of chopped celery and added a little Frank's Hot Sauce. They loved it. Thanks.

Any egg salad is a great springboard.  I added pimentos & decreased the amount of onion.  I like the fact it only calls for a tablespoon of mayo because it's more than enough for this particular recipe.  If you prefer MORE mayo I suggest adding boiled potatoes too.  It's great.

Too much spice - I still ate it but my kids would not.  Next time I'd add half the amount of paprika and dill, and much less onion.  I did like the fact that it had less mayo though.

This recipe was not to my liking.  Ended up using less mustard, more mayo and no dill because I didn't have any on hand.  Dill or no dill, the base recipe was very dry for me.  No matter, thank you for the submission!

good stuff... the red onion and dill give it a unique taste that works well. I also like that it doesn't use a ton of mayonaise

I am a novice when it comes to cooking and rely on the internet for all my recipes.  This however is the worst egg salad I have ever eaten.  A total waste of ingredients.  Threw it out.  Awful.

This was very good! I had to make a few changes due to what I had on hand. I used sweet onion instead of red and spicy brown mustard instead of dijon. I added a little more mayo because we like it creamier. Loved the addition of the dill. It went very well with the eggs. All in all, a nice change from regular egg salad. I will use this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This egg salad recipe was tasty ...but it needed just a bit more mayonnaise to balance out the mustard.

It was okay.  I like that it had so little mayo, but needs more crunch to suit my tastes.  I added celery, green pepper and chopped dill pickles.

Yum! I like the incorporation of paprika in this version of egg salad. I had to use dried onion flakes, as that's what I had on hand, and as with all recipes I try out, I didn't add the salt. Well done, thanks!

Made this for an evening picnic yesterday. The flavor was very good - my husband thought it was some of the best egg salad he's had. I just chopped the eggs instead of mashing and I did add about 1 TBL additional mayo - maybe the eggs I used were extra large, but there wasn't quite enough dressing to hold everything together. Even with the additional mayonaise, it was not bland or at all mushy. The mustard, red onion, and dill give it a great flavor. I have always made egg salad with dill relish and regular mustard and mayo, but I am a convert to this recipe and will continue to use it. Thanks!

Yay for egg salad with little to no mayo!  I hate mayonnaise, and so I was only able to stomach about 1 tsp of the stuff.  I substituted with sour cream for the rest.  I did think that the paprika was a bit much, so I tried to cut it by adding another tsp of sour cream and a little bit of diced cucumber.  Overall, very good!

This egg salad was delicious and I will make it again.  I thought I'd miss the mayonnaise, but I didn't at all.  I personally thought the onion was a little strong, so will reduce the amount of onion in subsequent preparations.  Thank you, Margret!

This is an issue of personal taste, but I found the onions and amount of mustard completely overwhelming.  If you are looking for a "traditional" egg salad, keep looking.

I tried this with the dijon mustard and didn't really care for the taste. I made this recipe a second time and used yellow mustard and it tasted much better.

What a great recipe. I needed a last minute - quick - appetizer for egg salad. Made exactly as stated. Served as sandwiches, cubed, on whole wheat bread.  They were gone within minutes!!   Will use again and again :)

Great recipe - I added a couple of tablespoons of sweet pickles and mayo.  Also used a Tablespoon of dried shallots instead of the onion - It added crunch and flavor.

Put the servings down to 2 since it was just the husband and me. Had to add a little bit more mayonnaise for personal preference (something you can eyeball). Overall, this was great!

I cheated a little and only used the items I had on hand, therefore no onion and no paprika. Made it for a picnic/potluck and it was a hit! Was hoping to have leftovers, but it was cleaned out! I guess that's good and bad.

Use half the onion, or just use onion powder! Way too oniony! I will tweak this and post improvements later.

I tried the user recommended 3 tablespoons of mayo, (i used smart balance for a healthier version) 1 tablespoon of mustard (any type), omit onion, add pickle (i chopped up half of a small pickle for a 3 serving recipe) and omitted the paprika. I also used fresh ground pepper and sea salt to taste. Not bad! I'll probably use a little less dill next time.

Way too much red onion (and we like onions in our house).  Half of the recommended amount would be plenty.  Too much dill as well.  This recipe is average at best.  I doubt I'll make it again.

I used half the amount of dried dill and even though I love dill, I just didn't care for it in this salad.  I used 1/4 c. of red onion and 1/4 c. of chopped celery for a little more crunch.  I used 1 Tbsp. of dijon and added more mayo.  I also used half the amount of paprika.  I usually just sprinkle a bit on before serving.  I don't think I'll make this one again.

This is by far and away my favorite egg salad recipe.  I have made this probably 20 times now, without any changes.  I LOVE it!  It has some kick to it, and tastes awesome.  If I had one complaint, it would be that egg salad sandwiches from stores and restaurants no longer cut it.. it's just not nearly as good as this.  I sincerely don't think I will ever, ever use another egg salad recipe.  This is it, and it's great!  Thanks for a great recipe! (made it again tonight :))

Very tasty egg salad!  However, I did have to increase the mayo as the filling was not the consistancy that I wanted after making as written. All in all, a good variation of egg salad.

I used the method I usually do for eggs to boil; put in cold water on med/heat and bring to a boil; boil 5 minutes turn off heat and leave in water for 15 minutes.  They don't get the ugly grey color that way.  This recipe has lots of mustard and onion; I onlly used 1T onion and  added a bit more mayonnaise... :)

Great recipe! I tweaked it a bit for my liking. I only used about 2 tablespoons of chopped onion, cut the spices in half, added 1 teaspoon of tarragon and 1/2 cup of diced cucumber.
Oh,I also did half Miracle Whip and half real mayo.
Fantastic!

I often reference recipes, but never follow them exactly. 
This prep had all the basics, but I added minced celery and onion for some crunch, dry Wasabi mustard, and some sweet pickle relish. Delicious.

I made this for my boyfriend and he ate it 3 times in a row which is amazing for him.  It must have been pretty good and it's low carb if you eat it with low carb bread.

I was looking for a low-cal recipe for egg salad. I'm not crazy about mustard, but tried this one anyway.I used 2tbsp of mayo and 2tbsp of Jack Daniels Honey mustard. No onion.I added a small sprinkle of celery salt and only sprinkled in the paprika.I couldn't even taste the mustard and the recipe is delicious. Thanks alot for the help.

I used this recipe as a guide because I have never made egg salad.I didn't have dill so I used dill relish.I also left out the paprika because my husband doesn't really like it.It was very good,althogh I think it should have more mayo than mustard.

This is really great egg salad!  I've always been a fan of the regular, heavy on the mayo egg salad, but after trying this recipe, I've realized you REALLY don't need all that mayo.  It holds together just fine and not one flavor over powers the other.  I like to serve this over greens with a touch of Newman's Light Italian Dressing.  Fabulous  :-)

Great base recipe for egg salad. Thanks for posting it. I tripled the mayo so it makes for a better sandwich spread and also added cayenne pepper. Turned out great.

Great recipe, but I had to double the amount of mayo and mustard because it was too dry to spread on bread. Also added a little bit of cayanne pepper.

Simple, zesty egg salad recipe.  I added some finely chopped garlic for flavor and used white onion because I didn't have any red onion on hand.  Excellent variation on traditional egg salad.  Will definitely make again.

Just made this for a quick lunch and hubby loved it.  I added finely diced celery and used low fat mayo--deelish.  The dill and paprika did not overpower the egg.  Will definitely make this again!

I liked the dijon flavour of it. I added garlic salt and onion powder for that extra something, and I think it made it better. The only reason I didn't rate it five stars is because I'm usually not all that crazy about egg salad sandwich to begin with.

Very good, but it calls for too much onion. Also, be sure to chop the onion very small. The dill is a nice addition.

I have made this egg salad several times now, it is a new staple recipe around my house.  I love the fact that this egg salad is so light on the mayonnaise!  

The use of dill weed instead of pickle relish was also a plus in my opionion, making for a less runny egg salad with a better texture.  I also can't imagine making this without the paprika, which gives it a unique flavor.

The only change I have made is to use coarsly chopped scallions in the place of red onions.  They have a more subtle flavor, and add a little crunch to the salad.

I agree with a previous reviewer in that I felt that something was lacking from this egg salad. I added diced pimentos as well as some garlic powder, however it was still so-so. I may try yellow mustard instead of Dijon next time.

I think it was the dill weed that made the flavor too strong for me. I added celery to give it some crunch, and that worked out well. I might try it again with less dill weed or maybe without any.

This is a great recipe! I added about 3 teaspoons of mayo and added some avocado too and it turned out really great!

I tried this a few times, something was missing at the beginning. Wound up cutting the recipe in half for trials, during which I discovered using 4 eggs, half a teaspoon of paprika, half a teaspoon of dill, 1 heaping tbs of regular mustard, a quarter of a yellow medium onion (more flavor), salt and pepper to taste, a splash of garlic powder, a generous splash of red pepper flakes, a touch of cyan pepper, and using a heaping tbs of sour cream instead of mayo (preference here), worked/ tasted better than any of the previous! It was an absolute delight! Thanks for the base to work from love! Another tip, try half of a avocado purred instead of sour cream or mayo, its absolutely wonderful.

I needed a quick egg salad recipe and that I had all the ingrediants on hand, so when I came across this recipe I had to try it. Actually this is my first ever making egg salad and it turned out like I wanted it, the only thing I added to it was a capful of vingear and instead of 1 tbsp of mayo I did 3 tbsp but should have did 2 tbsp, but either way the egg salad was delicious! Saving this one for the next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Good--would use a little less mustard. Still like my own recipe, so might alternate between them.

I've been making egg salad my entire life, but never strayed far from my original mayo/classic mustard recipe. Boy am I glad I did this time! It's so good I just licked the mixing bowl clean. ;) Thanks for sharing this recipe! I'll definitely be sharing it with friends and family!

Great! I used chicken instead of eggs, Italian Seasoning because I didn't have any dill, left out the Dijon and the onion because we don't like it, and a lot more mayonnaise because we like mayonnaise so much more than mustard!

I just love this recipe!

Sorry folks, but this is not good old egg salad. 1 tablespoon mayo? That's hardly enough to make 8 eggs a creamy spread.  The red onion is nice, but way too much dill, and not enough mayo.

I didn't think there was gonna be enough mayo or mustard, but it was the perfect amount! Also, I skipped the onions, cuz I don't like them, and just threw in some onion salt. It still tastes amazing! This is my new favorite egg salad recipe!

I found this recipe to have so much dill that it overpowered everything else, including the red onions. It should be called Dill Salad, not Egg salad. There should be a balance of flavors, I even added celery which you couldn't taste over the dill. Needs more than 1TB of mayo too or it doesn't hold together.

This was just okay. We had a lot leftover (made only 2 sandwiches) and nobody wanted to make any more... Didn't really like the Dill aspect of it and other than that it was kind of blah... maybe add some celery/onions to make it more crunchy? Give it more flavor?

I doubled the mayo, halved the Dijon mustard, and omitted the onion and salt. It was delicious! I served it on toasted honey wheat bread as an open faced sandwich. I'll definitely make this again.

Kind of a faux paus but I use Smart Beat instead of Mayo, cut the calories you know. And I used whole grain dijon, it adds a really nice texture to the egg salad without losing taste.  I used onion powder because I don't like the texture of onions in this kinda thing, used a little more paprika, and added.. peas! Peas are an awesome texture in egg salad. Doesn't derive from the taste adds somethin else to munch on. Obviously I'm big on texture.

I added about a handful of chopped celery for some crunch and it was good. What I didn't like was that the mustard and the onion was overpowering. Other than that, it was good.

I'm not a big fan of dijon, and this was way too much.  Next time I am going to try it with yellow mustard.  Besides my personal preference on mustard I think this recipe is pretty spot on - though I did add a little more mayo to get to the consistency I prefer.

Added finely chopped green and red pepper to this to add some color and some texture.  I used 6 eggs, 2.5T of mayo with olive oil, 1T yellow mustard, 1T of dill relish. I omitted the onion.  We just don't like raw onion. Yummy.

This egg salad was really tasty.  I wasn't planning on making it, so I was lacking a few ingredients.  I used yellow mustard instead of dijon, and I had to leave out the onions so the kids would eat it.  I also added a little garlic powder and left out the paprika.  The kids loved it!  My kids are really picky, so I was happy to be able to add something new to our lunch menu.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used stone ground mustard, light mayo and, instead of the onion, I diced up tiny pieces of celery to add a little texture. It is by far the best egg salad I've ever made - or have ever had, for that matter!

The best egg salad!  Sometimes I reduce the amount of onion and substitute celery for crunch.  I had a happy accident one day when I ran out of paprika and used 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder instead.  Try it for an extra kick.

As written this recipe is O.K. I liked the paprika, dill, mustard, and onion flavors. I used 2 green onions, chopped, instead of the red. I did feel it was missing something, however, and it was too dry. I doubled the mayo and dijon, then I added 2 Tbls. yellow mustard. Tweeked just a little it suited my taste better. Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe if you don't like too much mayo.  I didn't have dill weed or onions on hand, so I improvised and added some sweet relish.  Tasted great.

This turned out great! I omitted the mustard and onions. I used 3 tablespoons of mayo and no salt. It definitely didn't need any. I also let it chill in the frig over night.

Way too much onion.  I also prefer more dressing on my salad so I added more mayo and mustard.  5 stars with less onion and more dressing.  The ingredients are great, just not the amounts.

This was awesome! I did however take out half the yolks b/c im trying to watch calories and fat. I also took out the onion and used onion powder ( i dont like raw onion) and added a little less than a tablespoon of light mayo and a little more of the mustard. And i used wheat toast and not regular. It was AMAZING.

I liked it but thought it was too much mustard and too little mayo. Also a little too pink... not bad, just strange in egg salad. I did it the 2nd time with more mayo and added onnion powder intead of the onions and liked it better.

I love this recipe, because I hate mayo, but this recipes is excellent.  I found it doesn't keep well...it gets dry, but still yummy.  Mine was very sweet, because I used the Jack Daniel's Honey Dijon.

Great recipe! I toned mine down for my 5 year old, and followed Bea's suggestion: 3 tblspns of mayo, 1 tblspn of mustard, lots of diced pickles, and a teaspoon of Lawry's seasonings (didn't have any dill). Next time I will add dill. This is a keeper!

I substituted the onion with celery and added more mayo to get the consistency that we prefer.  We really enjoyed this recipe and will use it often.

Probably won't make this again. I prefer a more traditional egg salad. I thought it needed much more mustard and mayo (would prefer regular mustard instead of dijon). Way too much onion. Would probably decrease the amount of paprika and dill as well. With some tweaking, it could be alright, but just not my style.

I think that it was too dry and the onions were overwelming. I had to add more eggs to hide the onion.  The paprika gave it a weird color.  Used fresh dill instead of dried.

I used non-fat mayo so added a little more than it called for-and when I asked my husbancd to try it he said "It's perfect!"-he didn't even know it was non-fat mayo.  He usually asks me to add something, not this time.  It is great.  thanks!

This tasted good, but I didn't care for the appearance.  Once the dijon and paprika were mixed in, it looked brownish.

Sorry, but I can't see all the fuss over this recipe. I think the dill was too much. I also used yellow mustard like one of the other reviews suggested and the taste of it was overwhelming as well. Maybe with less dill and mustard it might taste better.

Excellent egg salad without all the mayo--didn't miss it a bit.  I followed the recipe as written, except I had no paprika, and then added about a Tbsp. of minced capers and a splash of the caper juice.  Served it on toasted olive bread with lettuce, YUM!--thanks for sharing the recipe.

I liked this recipe.  I added some chopped Bread & Butter pickles and pickle juice to give the salad a sweeter taste.  I used Vidalia onion, and I used a little more mayonnaise and a little less yellow mustard.  The onion and dill were yummy additions that aren't a usual part of my own Egg Salad recipe.

This was a very good base egg salad recipe for me to follow! I changed it a lot because I like things bland. I cut down on the paprika, dill, and onion, but I added some miracle whip at the end to make it creamier. YUM. Can't wait to eat more.

My 6-year-old has been begging me for egg salad (which I have never liked).  So, I tried this recipe and was VERY surprised!!  I left out the onions (kid thing) and used yellow mustard instead of dijon.  It was a perfect blend of ingredients and didn't have an overbearing taste.  Thank you for sharing!

I really liked this recipe. I used dill mustard in place of the dried dill and regular mustard. I didn't have any onions, so I put in some sweet pickle relish. I won't be doing that again! But I certainly plan to make it again (with the dill mustard) and have an onion on hand.

I altered it just a little I added regular mustard and added white onion instead of red. I also added bell pepper for a little crunch.

Great easy egg salad recipe. As others have stated cut down on the onion or omit altogether. Next time I make this I'm going to try adding just a dash of dried minced onion instead. I added an extra tblsp of May and I also added a little honey mustard with the Dijon mustard. Came out great now I just need to cut the onion portion even more, it's a bit overpowering.

I thought the dill overpowered the sandwich. I added two small honey crisp apples to the recipe to give it some sweetness. That was the only thing that made this edible.

My first time making an egg salad. Not my type of egg salad. Too much taste of mustard, Paprika does not go well, the color of paprika gives the egg salad an undesirable look.

I (like many on here) don't like this as made by the recipe. Way to little mayo and a little to much onion (and I love onion). The onion kinda drowned out the rest of the stuff and it tasted kinda dry.

I did however add 3 more table spoons of mayo to it and it turned out ok. i will however skip this recipe next time. :)

My hubby loved this egg salad. This was a good way to use up those Easter eggs my kiddos have dyed. I did use a spicy brown mustard instead of dijon since I had none left and decreased to about 1 tblspn. A nice creamy salad with a lot of flavor from the mustard, dill and red onion. Thanks!

There's no way 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise will be enough for 8 eggs. I like a dry egg salad myself but you do need a bit more.

I love this recipe! I think for some who is conscious about their calorie intake this is a great one. I feel like the mayo is just enough but i did take out yolk in two eggs. I was out of paprika and i added celery too..

I didn't really care for this egg salad.  We did eat it though, it wasn't so bad we had to throw it away.  Maybe it was the dill in it.  Although I like dill in other recipes.  I used more mayo then the recipe called for.  The paprika mixed in does not give it a very appealing color either.

We LOVE this egg salad.  Don't let the lower-mayo fool you...it's VERY creamy and good.  We've made this dozens of times and it's great for sandwiches, salads, and appetizers.

Yum!  I made this, pretty much as called for and it was delicious.  The red onion adds something quite nice.  I only use 1/2 the yolks to save on some fat and calories.  But the flavor is rich and tasty.  I made it on a sunday and had sandwiches for lunch on Monday and Tuesday.

This was a very helpful recipe. But I didn't have dill or paprika so I used some Italian seasoning instead. I added just a teaspoon more of mustard and a tablespoon more of mayo, just because it was my hubby's preference. Then again, I also added an extra egg. Also with the bread, I toasted it with a tiny bit of butter and cheddar cheese. It was amazing! Hubby always refused to eat anyone else's egg salad beside his own mothers, now he won't even eat hers and will only have mine! Be aware ladies, this tweak on the egg salad will most likely come with a jealous mother in law! lol

This is a good solid recipe. I don't like raw onions so I substituted pickles to give the salad crunch. I used fresh dill and added some garlic powder. Will definitely make again.

This was a little dry for my taste, added another tablespoon of mayo and a tablespoon of dill relish. I like it that way better, but next time I will also remove one tablespoon of mustard. All in all, very good egg salad. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best ever.  Did add a little celery, but is good without it.  Next time I am going to use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 Kraft miracle whip.  That is what I do when I make chicken salad and it has a great flavor.

This is really, really good!  It uses very little high fat mayo but is still extremely flavorful (and colorful, too!).  I didn't add onions because I didn't have any on hand, but I imagine a bit of red onion would be a nice addition. I put this on a Thomas Bagel Thin and had a delicious, high-protein, low calorie lunch!  Thanks for the recipe!

I added more mayo. because I knew I'd want a moister salad. I also added some celery. This is really good and is even better a day or two later. Thank you for the recipe, I'll definitely use it again.

Quick, easy, not bad, but strangle I had no dill or dill pickles, almost messed up and used Sweet pickle relish. I'll get Dill later, but its all done and chilling. I made it with 4 eggs, used more 'salad dressing' than what the 4 egg version called for.

Pretty darn good.  I didn't have dill so i used fresh parsley instead.  Don't get hung up on the 1/2 an onion thing like some seem to be - just go with what feels right for your taste.  Definitely add peas and/or celery.

Delicious!  My family loved it!  I made a few changes though.  I don't care for dill and so  dropped it and the red onion in lieu of 1 bunch of green onions finely chopped.  Also instead of salt I used a couple of dashes of garlic salt with the pepper.  YUMMY!

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 3 heaping Tbsp. of mayo and 1 heaping Tbsp. of regular mustard because I think the dijon is just too much. I may cut the dill weed just a tiny bit next time because  it is a little powerful but all around a good recipe!

Great recipe!  I made this and it turned out fab!  Instead of the 2 tbsp of dijon mustard I used 1 tbsp of dijon and 1 tbsp of regular mustard since my Mother isn't a dijon mustard fan.  I also added an additional tbsp on mayo and it turned out great.

Bring the water to a boil with the eggs in it, then remove from heat and let stand for 10-12 minutes = eggs over easy. not a bad recipe other than that, but the only way these directions get hard boiled eggs is if you found robins eggs

I enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe. I improvised a little by using white onion instead of red because that is all I had. I also used yellow mustard and added a very small amount of pickle relish. Easy and delicious recipe.

YUM!  I ran out of onions so I hydrated the dehydrated ones.  For a low carb snack, I wrapped the egg salad in a wheat tortilla... filling and tasty!  To spice it up, add come cayenne pepper... mmmmmm

..This IS good egg salad!! After reading RedRobynNAU (GO LUMBERJACKS!) review I had to try it...I have always made my egg salad with LOTS of mayo and sweet pickle relish.  The only thing I did different was sub Morton Nature's Seasons (Can't eat a tomato with out it) for the salt and chased with a few peperoncini...good stuff.

a good basic egg salad that should please most egg salad lovers. I'm sure everyone could tweak this to his/her own taste. Myself I added a sprinkle of Lowry's season salt and black pepper.

Delicious! My husband said it was the best he'd ever had. Did have to add extra mustard and mayo to get a correct consistency. Also, I used spicy mustard not dijon.

Not enough mayo, too much mustard, too much dill. Yellow, sweet onions chopped fine are more suitable to me than red.

I think the rating of this recipe depends on how you like your sandwiches. I personally like mine with a lot of sauce. So that is why I only gave it three stars. I had to double the mayo and mustard. I only had yellow onions on hand so I used 1/4 of one. Not bad, but I'll use a red one next time. The dill gave it great flavor, and yes the paprika gave it a funny color. The mustard can be overpowering, though, depending on the mustard brand used. With a high quality spicy brown mustard, the mustard overpowers everything else. This recipe is too finicky for me, so I'll be looking for a better one with less mustard.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I use green onions instead of red and half and number of eggs per serving.  It's tempting to sneak a spoonful when I'm done!

This was not my favorite.  We thought it was way too dry.  Had to add a lot more mayo to get the creaminess assoicated with egg salad.  Will keep looking.  Sorry

This was very very delicious but I thought it was too little mayonaise when I first read the recipe and then when I made it I was right! LOL I added about 4-5 tablespoons; we like our egg salad on the moist side. this just got rave reviews at lunch. thank you Margaret.

This was my first time making egg salad and I thought it was great.  I love the onion it goes great with the dill.  My fiance made fun of me becasue the paprika made it orange and egg salad is suppose to be yellow, but it still tasted just as good. I had to add a lot more mayo.  Will make it again.

Yum!  This was my first time making egg salad. I loved the flavor of this.  DH loved it too.

I used white onion, as I didn't have red, although I'm sure that would be even better.  I also added a little celery, as I'm always trying to get more veggies in where I can.

This is a great low-cost healthy recipe.  Love that it has only a little mayo.  Next time I make it I'm going to try it with Light Mayo and see if its as good.

I added even more dill, since I love it so. I like how light this recipe is on the mayonnaise; the egg/mustard/dill taste combo is so melodious that the mayonnaise isn't even missed! I didn't have paprika on hand so I used a sprinkle ground red pepper instead, to give it some heat. Mmm.

I would make it again, though I thought the paprika gave it an unappealing color. Personally, I like much more mayonnaise, and just a bit of mustard. I’d also add some celery for extra crunch.

Pretty good stuff.  After making it as written, I decided to add an additional TB of mayonnaise. It didn't change the flavor much, but made it a bit less dry.

This recipe can be a springboard for you. It gave me the idea to use fresh dill, but I didn't really follow the rest of the ingredients. I used chives instead of onions, sliced the eggs in an egg slicer instead of mashing, and of course added more mayo. I didn't have dijon mustard so substituted a deli-style mustard. IMO, the dill is what makes this a great salad. The rest of the ingredients are to your taste.

I was disappointed in this recipe. The only thing I did differently was add one more tablespoon of mayo, because eight eggs needed more than one. I also threw in some celery. Unlike others who thought the onion made it too strong, mine was the opposite. I found this recipe really lacking flavor. Maybe it will help if next time I only use one tablespoon of mayo and add an extra tablespoon of mustard. I’m not sure what else to do

It needs more mayo and something else to top it off plus the color was not what it is showing it to be due to paprika.

Love all the ingredients in this but needed to adjust the amounts to my taste. A little more mayo and a little less mustard than called for. I didn't measure the dill, just eyeballed what I thought would be good. Overall I'm happy with this recipe.

Excellent recipe - as with some of the other reviewers, more mayonnaise was needed.  

I needed only enough for 2 sandwiches, so I halved the recipe; turned out to be enough for 3 sandwiches.  

Paprika was fine - others thought it better to put on after the sandwich was made.  

I used only a tiny bit of onion so as not to overwhelm...and also added a few small stalks of organic celery (and the eggs and mayo were also organic!).

Yum recipe:)

I made this exactly the way the recipe is written and it was okay. If I make it again, I would change all the proportions. More mayo, less mustard, less dill, less onion (or skip the onion), and either less paprika or skip it.  With the full teaspoon of dill, my husband and I thought the dill flavor was overpowering and just way too much. I ended up adding a bunch more mayo to try to dull down the dill a bit, but it didn't help much.

suggestion, I use the pickle relish in a jar, and for a bit of a kick to the salad add in 1-2 chopped jalapenos, and bacon bits. yummy.

Definitely omit the onions or just lessen the amount, and add celery for the same crunch.  Also get creative with the spices and season to taste! Despite some minor altercations, for my preferences, it was delicious!

Didn't have dill on hand so omitted that.  Flavor with little mayo & Dijon with red onion was excellent!

Delicious!  I sliced some red onions and put them on the sandwich instead of mincing and adding to eggs.  I skipped the paprika just because I didn't have it.  I added peppercinis to the sandwich.  So yummy.
