Was leery about trying it.  No reviews.
However, I LOVE Crumpets! Sooo...I waited for my crumpet rings to arrive.  Well, let me tell you,
Super simple and absolutely delicious.  Just have to let rise 40 mins. then 30 min.  I made them exactly as  the recipe stated.  I think I overfilled a couple of rings could have been made smaller....I made 6 out of the recipe, probably could get 8 less fat ones. :-)  will be a staple around here!

Great recipe! Heres for Instant pot proofing! From : https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-bake-proof-bread-in-an-instant-pot/

"To proof bread:

Place the bread on parchment paper.
Put the steamer rack into the inner pot the normal way.
Secure the lid.
Turn the valve to Venting.
Use the Yogurt button in Low mode to keep the dough just warm enough to rise.

This process took my Instant Pot 24 minutes to fully double my yeast dough. When it's done, it will look bubbly and sticky. That's natural. Knead the dough and either re-rise it according to the recipe or transfer it to your cooking pan for baking in the oven. "

These were ALMOST as perfect as the real ones I've been missing from Australia! I will make them again. I wish there was a recipe for these using the Instant Pot.
