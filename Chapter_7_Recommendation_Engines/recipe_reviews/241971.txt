I've made this many times and it has always been delicious! I change up the type of pasta depending on who will be eating the meal.

The recipe itself has a few flaws. It says 1 1/2 lemon zest...tbsp or tsp? Way to much pasta. I only added just 1/2 the box and it was quite ample.  I used lemon rosemary spice blend to cook chicken in. I just used olive oil to cook it, spraying both sides w/ olive oil seems unnecessary.  step 2 is confusing as there is no listing for "lemon pepper" in the ingredients.  While the end flavor is fine, this recipe is just confusing.

Very quick to make. I'd say season to your taste, I did. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! I added my own sauce rather then pre-made. My family loved the lemon, very flavorfully! Easy to make. 
I'll be serving this again.

Glad I looked at the reviews - made the recommended changes (less pasta and no oil spray).  I actually forgot the lemon (!) and I used the AR 'Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce' recipe (which was both!) and enjoyed!  If you are a little creative this is a very good base recipe.

This is by far my favorite chicken alfredo recipe! Flavorful, easy and always a hit. Definitely going to make this often!

This was pretty good. Very lemony I think I will cut down on the lemon juice the next time I make it. Also way too many noodles I only put half of them in in. But in general pretty tasty.

Lemon made all the difference. I use lemon pepper and my husband said it was the best I've ever made!
