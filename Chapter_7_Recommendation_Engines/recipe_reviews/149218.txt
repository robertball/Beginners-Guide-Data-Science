This was a no-brainer. Really worked out fabulously with almost no effort at all. Ten times better than anything bought in the store, too. My kids will tolerate the store bought organic, but they LOVED this. It's just like eating the inside of an apple pie. I upped the quantity of the pumpkin pie spice to a full tsp. and I also added the spice and the brown sugar to the crockpot during the cooking process. Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing.

EDITED 06/17/08: I made this today
with half pear and half apples. This 
is a great way to use your excess crops
or fruit that just didn't get eaten 
fast enough. My kids just can't get enough of this sauce!

A REAL KEEPER. 

Last night, I added water to my Crockpot, cut up my apples (a combination of Granny Smith's and Gala's), used Apple Pie Spice (a combination of Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Allspice)(a generous "sprinkling"), tossed in the Brown Sugar (what I would call a "handful"), added a handful of raisins and "short sprinkle" (perhaps 8-10) of "Hot Dots", and turned the appliance on (LOW).

This morning, I made our Oatmeal (a regular occurrence in our household -- except that no one really likes it; sometimes it's Cream of Wheat -- which is better received, but not loved) and topped each bowl with a GENEROUS/HEFTY spoonful of this Applesauce (which had been cooking for no less than 10 hours).

Not only did no one (1 DH and 3 adult "children") complain, but my DH and BOTH of my sons (aged 20+) actually refilled their Oatmeal bowls so that they could have more of the "topping".

Better than this it rarely gets.

This smells soooooo good while cooking!  My crock pot is a "beast" and cooks super hot and fast, so this was done on low in 4 hours.  I used the "pumpkin pie spice II" recipe on this site and am very happy with the results.  Thanks for sharing your yummy recipe!

This was an excellent way to end dinner!  I poured the cooked apples and spices into a pan, sprinkled a yellow cake mix (just the box) on top, and drizzled with 1 stick butter.  Cook for 45 min. at 350 and it was like apple cobbler.

I cannot believe I have made it to 50 years old and have never thot to make applesauce, but I recently had oral surgery and could not eat anything chewy, meaty or crunchy...what to do? Go to AllRecipes! This applesauce was incredible. I used all the different apples in the pantry (I had 11 of them!) including Gala, Fuji, Grannysmith and Honeycrisp. Threw 'em in the 6 qt. slowcooker on low with a cup of water...they were done enough for me at 5 hours. I added a cup of raisins (o glorious plump and juicy raisin, how I worship thee!), a half-cup of brown sugar (the apples would have been fine without it, but I was jonesin' for some sweetness), threw in 1 teaspoon of cinammon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a pinch of allspice, mace and cardamom...and the house smells wonderful. 1/2 hour later I was eating applesauce for dinner! 
Big sloppy kisses to ASG for this wunnerful recipe, that was perfect for my sore lil mouth after surgery, but I will be making again when I feed the firemen next month, and have potlucks in the future. Otherwise, I know me...I will make this pile of yumminess and eat it all myself! I can just imagine what this would be like over vanilla ice cream....sigh.

This recipe was very good. I used gala and golden delicious apples, therefore I only added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and the pumpkin pie spice II that another reviwer suggested. I substituted allspice for the cloves since I don't like the bitterness of cloves. I used 1 to 1-1/2 teaspoons of the spioce mixture  in the applesauce and it turned out quite well. I will definitely make this again.

I REALLY wanted to like this and I made it exactly the way it was written; but, sadly there was just waaaaaaaay too much sugar in it and it was just a little too watery.  I really wish I had read some of the reviews before making this.  I do plan to make this again; however, I will reduce the water slightly and reduce the sugare to 1/4 cup.

Very good!My kid's love it! I only put 1 tbls of brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon.*Tip* Lay a clean tea/hand towel over your crock and then place then lid on it.This will help keep the water from dripping back inside your applesauce.Making it less runny and a thicker consistency.I also do not mash up all my apple becuase we like it a little chunky.I have used apple juice in place of the water & it taste even better & you need no sugar or at the very least a lower amount depending on your taste.I am on my 3rd crock this week!My kid's just can not get enough of this applesauce!My mom even asked why she did it the old fashioned way when i was a child cuz this taste just as great and very easy to do,lol.I also keep my crock on the "warm" setting as it cook's very very hot and it is done within 3-4 hrs!If i am in a hurry & home from work i then use the low setting & it is done within 1-2 hrs(depending on how thick you slice/chop your apples).Thanks again for a AWESOME RECIPE :))

Really 10 stars for this ....super yum! I inherited 8 large red delicious apples which I personally don't care for as an "eating" apple ........and I usually make homemade applesauce in the fall....but I decided not to waste these. Reduced the brown sugar to 1/4c which was plenty sweet and used 1/2tblspn of cinnamon and 1/2tsp of nutmeg and kept the water measurement the same. Love the crockpot method for cooking applesauce. Easy and amazingly delicious.  Healthy because you can control the sugar content. Easily freezable and always yummy as a substitute for oil in baked goods. Honestly I think the best pot if applesauce I have ever made. Thanks!

I had a bunch of apples I had to do something with quickly, so this was a great way to use them up before they went bad.  I personally could barely smell it while it was cooking, only could smell it a bit at the end, but nevertheless turned out very well.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and put some of it on plain oatmeal as a topping - delicious!!!  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so incredibly easy and delicious. The only downside is the effort involved in peeling the apples, which is quite time consuming considering how much apples cook down. To give you an idea of how much this recipe yields, a 3 lb bag of apples will make ~2 - 2.5 cups of applesauce, so definitely buy a ton of apples so you can make a big batch. This stuff won't last long once you make it... so yummy.

Delicious! I ended up quadrupling the recipe (that's what happens when u have an apple tree :-)), but still minimizing the brown sugar by at least half. It may be our late season apples, but I could tell the full amount of brown sugar would be way too sweet! Still delicious, though. It tastes like apple pie in bowl! I'd even suggest warming it up and adding ice cream or whipped cream! Yummers!

I made this applesauce to go with our Christmas ham.  Everyone raved about how good it was.  I put the brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice in at the beginning.  I used Granny Smith apples and the amount of sugar was just right.  Will definitely make this again.

This was an ok recipe.  It was way too sweet for my taste, but it could be because my apples were small.  My daughter loved it and has asked for it again.

Soooo easy!  Mine took less than 6 hours and I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I used a combination of golden delicious, red delicious and fiji apples.  Pureed some in the food processor and my 6 mo.old grandniece loves it!

Aside from peeling the apples, this recipe was super-easy and wonderfully tasty. My husband raved about the applesauce on his pork tenderloin. I made 1.5 batches and had to start the cooking in a larger pot, then once the apples reduced was able to transfer into a standard size crockpot.  I think 6 hours of cooking is the upper limit needed, but that may depend on the cooking temp of the crockpot.  I used granny smiths, jazz, and honey crisp apples.

MMMMM, so very yummy!  I had to cut this recipe in half as I only had 4 apples to use up (2 royal gala and 2 mac's).  I upped the pumpkin pie spice a bit (even though I cut the recipe down) and I reduced the sugar to about 1/4 cup.  Cooked on low for about 6 hours and the result, oh so good!  I will for sure make this super easy recipe again, the hardest part is peeling and coring all the apples!

OMG this was dynamite! Everyone raved over this dish at Thanksgiving. I used a 5 lb bag of Gala apples and cut the sugar to a half of a cup (packed). It was the perfect amount of sweetness for me (and for the 11 others at the table). So easy to put together and 1000 times better than the bottled stuff. I will be making this again and again!

This was yummy!  I never made homemade applesauce before, but it was great.  I cut the apples and water in half (fed 4 people), eyeballed the brown sugar (prob. about 1/4 cup), added a splash of cinnamon, and used just under 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  Threw it all in my 1.5 qt. crock pot on low for about 4.5 hours, and everyone loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.

I enjoyed this very much, it reminds me of apple pie without the crust, I didn’t use as much sugar, I think it will depend on the apples and I had a mixture some sweet and tart, and I don’t like thing real sweet! And it makes the house smell good! I had a little fresh squeezed orange juice so I added water to make ½ cup and it was fine!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was really good.  I used granny smith apples, and served it with pork city chicken.  Definitely something I'll make again.  I use applesauce in my granola bars and I can't wait to try using this instead of the store bought stuff.

This is delicious! I apologize I'm not rating on exact recipe, I'm sure it's great too. I used apple cider instead of water, and didn't need to add any sugar! Amazing. I think this needs to be a Christmas tradition!

Very good! Great idea. Served this over warm baked oatmeal with cranberries. I did add cinnamon. Cooked apples over night. Great with warmed milk. Will make this often on Sundays over the winter.

Waaaaay too much sugar! And that's even after I used several more apples than were called for. Using the crockpot was definitely great, but I suggest adding spices/sugar slowly and tasting as you go for the right balance.

I made this today with just a couple of changes. Instead of water I used apple sider but used 3/4 cup instead of 1/2. also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Added the brown sugar and spices after it cooked for about 5 hours.  This applesause is the greatest!!!  Hubby is still raving about it.  Will definately make again and again.

I used apple pie spice instead of the pumpkin.  Also, I used dark brown sugar and only used 1/4 cup of water.  I added the spice and 1/2 the sugar at the beginning of the cook cycle.  After the apples had softened considerably, I tasted the sauce and added in the remaining sugar.  The sauce, made with apple pie spices, taste the same as southern fried apples without the extra calories from the butter, and they are a wonderful addition to an old fashioned breakfast of sausage or ham, eggs, grits, and toast.

This was really good. Another kicked up applesauce is using 8 to 10 apples, semi peeled, cored and chunked. 3/4 cup red hot cinnamon candies, 1/2 cup apple juice (or cranberry juice) 1/2 cup sugar (if desired). Put all ingredients in a crock pot and let cook for 4 to 6 hours on low (until consistency is like applesauce). This smells wonderful and kids love it!!! I also add a little more cinnamon to the recipe as we love cinnamon! Its not spicy...just very different and it comes out looking red!!

I am excited about this recipe!  I am just starting to discover the joys of crockpot cooking, and right in time to work with the remaining apples from my tree.  NOTE: I am experimenting with adding 1/4 cup bourbon and 1/3 cup water, instead of 1/2 cup water.  My apples sizes vary too; I think I have about 3 pounds to work with.  Looking forward to the yummy kitchen smells!

Delicious!  Super easy.  Made some for our grilled pork chops and freezing the rest for Thanksgiving.  We were short on time so we cooked it on high for 3 hours and then added the sugar and spice.  Continued to cook on high for another hour or so.

An easy to put together applesauce. I used Macintosh apples (so good this season). When cooked the applesauce was a little watery. I'll try again with less water added. I did not add all the brown sugar - way too sweet for me. It might be a good idea to taste adding to your own level of sweetness. Thanks A.S.G. I will make a few more batches this year.

This was excellent! I used Gala applees because I had them. I also used splenda instead of granulated sugar becaise pf doabetes. My husband found it and began eating it with rice and oatmeal for a couple or mornings, and then there was only a tiny bit left and I had to grab it if I wanted any. I'm going to buy a big bag of apples just to cook this when we shop tomorrow, and I'm going to try freezing it, if I can get enough to do that before DH and Son get their hands on it! 20 stars, if I could. Thanks bunches

I think this is a great starting recipe, but we made a few changes for personal preference.  Used golden delicious apples, and cut them into small chunks instead of slices.  I think the consistency and texture was perfect - I cooked on low overnight with a timer for 6 hours, and after that it kept on the "keep warm" setting.  I like the brown sugar but don't think the pumpkin pie spice was quite right - I think just some cinnamon would have been better. When warm it tastes like apple pie filling, not applesauce.  Thanks for a good starting point!

Not only is this really easy, you can also do it with pears or make a mix of apples and pears. Quantities aren't that crucial - just match to the size of your slow cooker and make sure you put in enough if doing for a long cooking period. We've had so much fruit this autumn. We usually do this just before bed and wake up to yummy apple asuce which we have with our breakfast in some guise. Our apples have very red skins so we get a pink apples sauce! Use a potato masher if there are any lumps left and you don't want them but by morning there usually aren't any.

This recipe is pretty much like apple butter.  I wouldn't recommend eating this plain because there is just way too much sugar in it.  I suggest using it in oatmeal as another reviewer suggested. I make about 50 quarts of applesauce a year and found that sugar never needs to be added if you use sweet apples to begin with and a cinnamon stick per quart is sufficient enough for spice. Sweet apples: gala and fuji

Although I found the brown color off-putting, my five and three year old sons LOVED this homemade apple sauce. I did have to make my own pumpkin pie spice because I had all the ingredients but not the jarred mixture labeled "pumpkin pie spice." This may be why my turned out so brown, all the spices were ground fresh before mixing. But, as I said, my kids loved it and the taste I had (watching my sugar,so I didn't have a whole serving) was pretty awesome.

This is actually the best applesauce I've ever had. I didn't have "pumpkin pie spice" so I used a combination of spices one might find in a pumpkin pie (nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.) I also substituted one or two apples with pears. Delicious!

I love slow cooker recipes.  This one is used every year in the fall when I get a pile of apples for cheap from the farmer's market.  I typically use Jonathan apples, although JoniGold's were lovely and allowed me to reduce the sugar a little. I would recommend finding your own spice combination preference.  This turned out a bit strong for me.  Perhaps use a spice combo from an apple pie recipe that you like.  It's a great recipe and I think the spices are very "personal" -- each person needs to find their own exact combo.  (See "All Day Applebutter" for a similar recipe)

Loved this recipe!  I had no idea how simple and easy it was to make applesauce.  I used apple cider instead of water and only a sprinkle of brown sugar.  Loved this and plan on making it again and again!

Fantastic! I used 2 granny smiths, 4 fuji and 2 gala apples with the recipe and it was perfect. I will be making this more often. Perfect for autumn.

I made this just the other day from a slightly different recipe and it was so good.  Used some too soft apples we had from apple picking.  Just like the inside of an apple pie.  (also awesome over vanilla ice cream).  I used cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice, about 1/3-1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of white sugar (because thats what we had).  Cooked on low about 6-8 hours.  So good.

Really good applesauce!  Great recipe for having just gone apple picking.  I used both red and golden apples.  Did not add any sugar as it already tasted sweet.  Added apple pie spice instead of pumpkin.  Nice flavor and texture.

This was fabulous! I omitted the spice and used cinnomon instead, just because I am not a pumpkin kind of girl.  I also used the food procesor which made it nice and smooth.  The aroma in the house was amazing.  Will save and use over and over.

So low maintenance, I loved it! Just slice the apples and put them in the slow cooker and forget about it for 6 hours. Definitely adjust the amount of sugar according to your apples. I had Golden Delicious apples, which were sweet, so I only used 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Instead of the pumpkin pie spice, I just used 1 t. cinnamon.

This is the best applesauce I have ever had!!  I normally do not care for applesauce but can't stop eating this!  My husband who likes applesauce loves it too!  We have a golden delicious apple tree so I only put in 2 tbs. of brown sugar since they are sweeter apples and it was the perfect sweetness.  It tasted like dessert.  We both liked it better than pie so I will be making tons of it to freeze with our apples.

my 15 month old just ate three bowls of this mixed with his baby cereal -- a great way to hide all that iron!  i used only 1/2 c. sugar and increased the spice to 1 tsp.  threw in the vitamix and pulsed a few times to get to saucy consistency.  will reduce sugar again next time.  and will definitely make again -- easy, fresh and smelled great.  UPDATE:  this time i left skins on (since i puree anyway), skipped all sugar and used 1/2 c. fresh OJ (one large orange) instead of water.

This recipe is awesome!  I added vanilla bean and cinnamon stick while it cooked.  I also used 10-12 apples and just adjusted the brown sugar according to taste.  This was my first attempt at apple sauce and I would definitely do it in the crock pot again.

I just made this for the first time, and it's really good.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used the recipe that I found for the spice blend here.  Mine did come out a little too sweet, probably because I used red delicious apples.  So, unless you are using a tart apple, you might want to reduce the amount of brown suger.

Worked out very well, I reduced the sugar to half a cup.....and that was sweet enough! My family liked applesauce with vanilla sauce or a dollop whipped cream as a  nice desert. This recipe was super easy to make - a no-brainer as Sarah Jo stated...

My first time making applesauce! I have a ton of apples, so I doubled evrything except I left the brown sugar at 2/3 cup. It was still quite sweet. So delicious! Everyone loves and I made 3 times so far (apple picking season).

This recipe is phenomenal and easy to follow.  I used Pumpkin Pie Spice I recipe from this site and it was perfect.  We served hot over vanilla ice cream and it tased just like Ben and Jerry's   Apple Pie Ice Cream.

This is perfection!  I just put all of the ingredients in the crockpot at the same time, cooked on high for a couple of hours, and used a potato masher to chunk it up a bit.  It's even easier if you have an apple peeler/corer/slicer machine- it took me like 5 minutes to get everything into the crockpot.  You can leave out the sugar, depending on the type of apples used, too.

A very good applesauce recipe - I followed the directions exactly, using the Pumpkin Spice I recipe found here on Allrecipes.  To prepare my apples I peeled and cored them, cut them in half, and then sliced from stem to bottom making thin (half a cm) slices before piling them into the slow cooker.  This took awhile (I'm VERY slow at peeling/cutting fruits and veggies) but I think it helped make the apples fall apart more to better copy the traditional texture you'd get in store-bought applesauce.  The taste is delicious - reminds me of apple pie.  One thing I would warn against is that it is INCREDIBLY sweet as written.  For somebody like me who is used to unsweetened applesauce, the brown sugar is a little overwhelming.  I would suggest toning down the sugar or even eliminating it all together if you prefer a fruitier taste.

Very yummy!  Worked better in my older crock pot, since it didn't get as brown in there.  Left out the water by accident, and didn't miss it.  Next time, just used one or two tbsp of water, and that was fine to stop excess browning.  Also, cut the sugar a little, and that was good too.  Used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, dash cloves, and dash nutmeg in place of pumpkin pie spice.

Did this with 4 large granny smith and 4 large Fuji apples and cut back a little on the brown sugar (NO WHITE!) for a more natural flavor.  LOVE IT WILL MAKE IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!!

This is very easy to make and delicious!  The only thing is that apples cook down to almost nothing, and there is no way that 8 apples will ever make 8 servings!  I just made this and got 3 snack portioned servings out of the 8 apples I used.  Next time I will triple the batch and keep extras in the fridge for healthy delicious snacks.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  When it was done I left just a little in the slow cooker, and then made my slow cooker hot cereal in there.  I use part oatmeal, part wheatina, and part cream of rice (or whatever hot cereal I have).  I add brown sugar and cinnamon, and the little bit of applesauce left in the bottom of the cooker gave it a great new twist.

I love the use of brown sugar in this recipe! I used our homegrown gala apples that weren't good enough for eating whole or giving to friends/neighbors. I filled my old Rival Crockpot to the very top and then used the other ingredients as listed.

Yummy!  I used 5 gold delicious and 5 red delicious apples since that's what I had on hand and wanted to use up.  I sliced very thin using my mandolin. Added 3/4 cup water and cooked on low for six hours. I added 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and dash of nutmeg at the end, stirred and heated through for another 30 mins.  Wonderful. I honestly don't see how one could mess this up since it tasted perfect without adding anything. Enjoy!

Added more apples (maybe 25-20 but, i'm cooking for a big family) so I also increased the sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Less water and also added 1 tablespoon cinnamon.

I upped the pumpkin pie spice to just about a tsp. It is amazing in steel cut oatmeal or in vanilla yogurt with granola on top. Scrumptious!!

I wanted to make something special for my applesauce-loving overnight guests, and this recipe was just delightful. My "pumpkin pie spice" (I didn't have anything pre-mixed on hand) was 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp. cloves. The only change I made to the recipe was to add about 1 1/2 tsp. fresh-squeezed lemon juice for a slight tartness and to keep it fresh longer.  Next time I plan to add a bit of vanilla extract to fill out the flavor even more. I'll let you know how it goes. =) This is, without question, a five star recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it!

Instead of cooking the apples in plain water, I cooked them in Pumpkin Chai Tea from DAVIDsTEA, making it both caffeinated AND delicious! Actually, the amount of caffeine incorporated into the recipe is negligible, so it's still great to serve to kids or caffeine-sensitive people.

This is just as good to smell cooking as it is to eat!  I only used 1/4 cup sugar, otherwise it would have been way too sweet.

If use Fuji, gala, and honey crisp, you don't need the extra sugar. That's if you are looking to minimize your sugar intake from your diet. It's already sweet as candy.

Fantastic recipe!  I used granny smiths & a couple of braeburn apples.  The pumpkin pie spice was a great change from the norm.  This will be our go-to applesauce recipe!

This was delicious. I gave 4 stars because I modified slightly--I cut the brown sugar to 1/4c after reading all the reviews; I found this was perfectly sweet. I also made pumpkin pie spice (using Pumpkin Pie Spice II recipe from this site). Really easy and yummy.

This recipe is amazing. Getting an apple peeler helps if you make a double batch. I would suggest putting in a lot less brown sugar and adding some cinnamon

After reading the reviews I decided to make this twice- once as written, and once modified.  The way it's written (as others have said) is WAY too sweet, even for me and I love sugar lol.  It was also too watery.  So, I cut the water and sugar to 1/4c each and used Tara's suggestion to put the tea cloth under the lid (reduces recycled moisture) and this came out PERFECT!

This is a great recipe and so much better than any store bought stuff! I took the tip one reviewer wrote about placing a towel between the lid and the crock pot. I used apple cider on both batches but will still probably reduce the qty of liquid at the start. I also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon because I love it. I will be making many more batches and canning them for later.

I never knew it was this easy to make applesauce. I made this for my 15 month old daughter so left out the sugar, used only cinnamon, and added one pear along with the apples. This tasted like apple pie filling!

I love that it works in the slow cooker, so I can tend to other things.

I would do a much larcher batch, and OMIT the sugar(maybe a touch of raw honey). That is an awefull lot of sugar as apple are naturally quite sweet!

The only problem I had was that the crockpot overflowed a little as it was cooking.  Perhaps because it didn't cook down fast enough to make room for the bubbling?  next time I will make it when I am able to check on it more often.  Best applesauce I have had.

great way to use up all those apples in my crisper.  Next time, I think I'll cut back a little on the brown sugar. It was a tad sweet for my taste, otherwise the sauce was perfect.  I ran  the sauce through the blender for a smoother consistency.

I think this is my all time FAVORITE applesauce!  it turned out totally delicious!  I used 5-6 different varieties of apples both tart and sweet  and bc of this I think I will leave out a little bit of the brown sugar (maybe only use 1/2 cup vs 3/4 cup)but this will most definitely become my go to recipe for apple sauce!

This was perfect, and already all gone (made it yesterday). I didn't have pumpkin pie spice on hand (thought I did), but used allspice instead. My husband wanted raisins in his, so when I took it out of the crock I divided and put raisins in his half. I questioned that move, but it was really good.

We picked a peck of Fuji apples and used them for this recipe.  The applesauce is excellent!  Using brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice, I seasoned to taste, making sure not to make it too sweet.  I served it hot over ice cream -- we loved it.

I made this as the recipe read,  I cannot believe how good this was - I did run it thru the Foley foodmill like I would for any applesauce to make it smooth, and lo and behold I got the most delish apple butter you could ask for....  I spread it on toast and it is awesome.. It is the pumplin pie spice that makes it an apple butter.  Love it and thanks ASG for the easy apple butter recipe...

This was simple and easy.  It's been years since I made homemade applesauce and this way help it to turn out wonderfully.  My family and I love cinnamon so I added that along with the pumpkin pie spice.

I tried this out to inaugurate my new Crock Pot and was not disappointed.  The pumpkin pie spice makes it taste like a delicious marriage between applesauce and Indian pudding.  Serve nice and hot!

I have made this recipe numerous times since I first found it a couple years ago. It goes over well every time. After making it so much I've definitely made adjustments. Depending on the type of apple I adjust the amount of brown sugar - there's really no need for that much. Apples are naturally quite sweet and the sweeter the apple - the sweeter the sauce. I use a couple whole cinnamon sticks in addition to the spices. It also freezes really well so we have apple sauce long after picking season is over!

Absolutely delicious! I added the spices at the very beginning and then added the brown sugar at the end. Just like apple pie filling!

Holy cow!  I almost ate the whole batch in one sitting.  My kids and husband loved this.  My batch was a little too sweet for me, so next time I will use green apples instead of red, but definitely a keeper.  I can't wait to make this into a pie filling!

I found this to be too sweet for my taste, but it was a great alternative to making applesauce on the stovetop.  Next time I will try it with about 1/4 cup of sugar or less.

i don't personally like applesauce, i made this for my 2 year old, who absolutely gobbled it up! so i'm assuming it was 5 star taste! this was so easy, i just peeled and cored my apples (3lbs worth) and put them in the crockpot without further cutting because i was planning on using my food processor after cooking which worked out great! i didn't measure the water, i just put in enough so apples were floating (way more than what recipe called for) and added about 2 handfuls of brown sugar, 2 cap fulls of lemon juice and vanilla, generous amounts of ground cloves, ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon to the crockpot before cooking. cooked on low about 6hrs, drained apples over a stock pot, put apples in the food processor and made apple cider with all that leftover spiced water by adding apple juice, orange juice, and apple peach passionfruit mixed juice i had on hand. it was awesome!! can't wait to make again! and will definitely do the extra water to make apple cider again!

Yummy!  I made the the recipe the same except I used apple pie spice and put it all together instead of just the water and apples first.  Could have used less brown sugar, but 1/2 of my apples were a bit sweeter to begin with.  Daughter is eating it as I write this.

I have been making applesauce for a few months now because I have a now 1 year old that I was sick of buying baby food for when I could just make it.  Her favorite it chicken noodle soup and applesauce. I made this yesterday and she loved it hot. She is now eating some with toast for breakfast. The only thing I changed is I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so I just looked what was in it and kind of made my own. I used granny smith apples because that is what I had. Next time I make this I would love to try some pears as suggested and toss in some strawberry's.

I LOVE THIS!  I have made it 3x in the last month, and I can't get enough of it.  It tastes like apple pie filling, and it is so good!  I've used a mixture each time, using Jonagold, Golden Delicious, and Cameo.  It made for a great treat straight from the crock pot after playing outside in the snow.  YUMMY!

This is really good!  We are actually living in Mexico for the winter and you can't buy applesauce here.  Fortunately, I do have a slow cooker and apples are readily available.  It smells wonderful while it's cooking.  Thanks for submitting!

This recipe is great. I was trying to find a replacement of my mom's applesauce, and it came pretty darn close. I used red delicious & Macintosh apples. I also put in about a teaspoon of vanilla and a couple sprinkles of cinnamon with the apples and water when starting cooking. Definitely great, I will make this quite often!

This was yummy!  My 4 year old helped me peel the apples, so it was a fun project together.  Woke up this morning...applesauce!  I did run it through the food processor so it would be more smooth, but that is just our preference.  I followed the recipe as is, and it was good!  Great oatmeal topping!

A great change of pace from traditional white sugar and cinnamon applesauce. So easy to do it in the slow cooker! I cut up the apples the night before, cooked it on slow all night and it was ready for breakfast in the morning!

Woah! Really delish but more of a dessert than a side dish with all that sugar. If you're using this as a side for pork chops, halve the sugar. If you're using it as a base for a scoop of vanilla ice cream and crumbled graham crackers (YUM), make as is.

Love it! Yummy with oatmeal in the morning.  During the last half hour I turn it up to high and mix cornstarch in cold water and then add it to the slow cooker to thicken the sauce.

Wow, I loved this and my hubby too. The hardest part was the prep work of the apples. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice or allspice so I did the cinnamon, nutmeg and clove mix. This will now be a part of my Thanksgiving meals!

It was very tasty. I used Pumpkin Pie Spice II from this site for the pumpkin pie spice, and next time I will probably cut back on the cloves as it just isn't a flavor I enjoy in applesauce. This recipe worked out very well with Gala apples that had gone mealy or "soft" on me, but I added more water than the recipe said to. I won't do that again--it didn't need extra water! I used less sugar--maybe half to 2/3 less sugar than it called for (because Galas are a very sweet apple, and you can always add more at the end, but once you add it you can't take it back!) and it was fine for us.

Too much spice for me. I don't know what it was, maybe the nutmeg in the pumpkin pie spice? But it was way too strong. Next time I think I'll add my own individual spices. The texture was good, though.

Absolutely delicious! I used pink lady apples and still used all the sugar called for in the recipe, so mine was pretty sweet--but that was how I wanted it. I put this in apple bread and it came out *amazing*...I'm convinced it was because of this applesauce. The one change that I made was that I cut the apples into smallish chunks instead of slices, since I wanted little bits of apple to be distinguishable in the bread. I took the advice of some other reviewers here and used the Pumpkin Pie Spice II recipe from this site, which worked out wonderfully. Overall, this recipe was easy, cheap, and *very* tasty. Thanks for sharing, A.S.G.!

This recipe is a good base, but it could use some 'tweaking.' I've been making applesauce on the stove & apple butter in my crockpot for years & I always add apple cider or juice, rather than water. For the sauce, I core Jonathan apples (best for baking & cooking), but I leave the peel on, cut them into chunks & saute them in butter before adding brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg & cider (all ingredients are based on the number of apples I use & taste preference), then boil them down until the apples are tender & the juice is 'syrupy.' For apple butter, I peel Jonathan apples, cut them into chunks, add brown sugar, spices & cider or juice & cook on low for at least 8-10 hours. Wonderful!!

Yum! This was so good and easy! I used 4 cortland apples and 4 golden delicious; when it came time to add the sugar, the applesauce only needed about two teaspoons because the apples were so sweet! My family loved it, and ate the whole pot in one meal! Thanks for the recipe; I will be making it often!

I did not add any water, apples have enough moisture that it would have been too watered down. Instead I squeezed one lemon into the crockpot and cinnamon and freshly greater nutmeg and only 4 tablespoons brown sugar, even that was more than enough sweetness! Turned it on and went to bed, in the morning ran the immersion blender and had freshly made applesauce for breakfast. Thanks for jogging my memory, so much better than jarred applesauce.

I loved this! I cooked the apples (Granny Smith) in crock pot with all ingredients (substituted pumpkin pie seasoning to just cinnamon and nutmeg) on high 2 hours and then lowered temp to low for another hour. Then blended the mixture in a blender!! It was delicious!

Great recipe. I added more cinnamon, but I love cinnamon and am not super into nutmeg so that's more personal preference than recipe quality.

I printed this recipe way back in 2010 and finally got around to making it yesterday!  Anyway, I don't know if I will make it again--will search for other applesauce recipes before coming back to this one.  I love the use of a crock pot and if I had to rate it on simplicity alone, I would give it 5 stars.  

My first issue is with the quantity of apples--it states 8 apples but what size?  Why  not simply say how many cups of sliced apples; 8 large apples will give a different quantity compared to 8 small apples.  I used 9 apples since two were "small" (in my opinion).  I have a standard size Rival crock pot that dates back to the 70s (I think it's a 3-qt size) which still works just fine.  The sliced apples nearly filled the crock pot.  The amount of water seemed like it might not be sufficient considering the number of apples but I followed the recipe.  I set the crock on low and 4-5 hours later when I checked, the apples didn't appear to have cooked down at all.  After 8 hours, things hadn't changed much.  I left the crock on low all night.  When I checked around 7:00 a.m. today, the apple slices still hadn't cooked down much.  Frustrated, I turned the crock pot on high.  I was gone all a.m. and when I got home around 1:00 p.m., the apples had finally cooked down so it was a somewhat chunky sauce.   So, it took almost 24 hours for this to be done and it likely  wouldn't have been done in that time if I had left it on low.  I ended up with slightly less than one qt of apples

Yum. This time around,  I doubled the number of apples and added 6 pears. I also made some additions - with ~ 1 TBSP vanilla in the first cook and added nutmeg and allspice, and extra cinnamon with the brown sugar. It's just a little bit spicy and delicious. We ate the first bit of it hot over vanilla ice cream.

I followed the recipe and it did come out watery.  I did read reviews prior to making this.  Next time I will use less water and less brown sugar.  Otherwise , it was very easy to make.

Delicious and smells even better! I left the apple skins on, and agree it really didn't need the water (and I only added 1/4 cup). I used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar. I will definitely be making this again!

I have always made applesauce on the stove-top, but I had to use the slow cooker for this year's Thanksgiving dinner. I used a combo of Gala, Honeycrisp, Jona Gold and Grannysmith.I don't care for pumpkin pie spice, so I just added a cinnamon stick. It came out really good, although as another reviewer mentioned, the color was a bit dark. For those complaining that it was too sweet or too watery, I have a suggestion; from years of trial and error, I make it a habit to taste the apples before adding any amount of sugar or water. I have used apples that were so sweet and juicy, they barely needed anything added and I have used apples that were dry and not very sweet and had to add more sugar and water than called for. If you can find them, try Jazz apples. I discovered these gems last summer in a grocery store. They were sold in a 3 pound bag. They make the absolute best applesauce. I had to keep the fridge stocked with it for months per DH's request. They are not always available here, but when they are, I stock up and make batches to freeze.

Great recipe. Nice and easy. Helpful hint: Apples have varying levels of sweetness/tartness. If you're using an apple like a Gala you probably want to reduce the sugar. I just taste mine before adding the sugar and decide how much, if any at all, to put in. Pretty simple really.

I've been making it this way for years........  I don't add any water as I like it thick and in fact, I take the lid off at the end so it will thicken up.  I also don't add any sugar  - if you use sweet apples, you don't need it!

Used 2# Golden Delicious and 1# Granny Smith. Peeled and diced the apples, used 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, some cinnamon and nutmeg - added all the above at the beginning.  Crockpot on high for 1 hour - low for 2 1/2 hours, mashed lightly at the end.  Perfect for our taste.

After reading reviews of how good this was, I had to try it.  OMG, how YUMMY!!  Most difficult part of this was sitting on the couch watching TV while peeling and slicing the apples.  :o)    Had to be careful not to cut myself.  After reading other reviews, I opted to add a little lemon juice, just a bit of brown sugar and a touch more cinnamon, in addition to the pumpkin pie seasoning.  I did cut back on the water and oh so glad I put the towel under the lid.  PERFECT consistency.  Thank you for making me a change woman, never again will I buy applesauce.

I was looking for a way to use up more apples from my apple tree in my yard... and this is the PERFECT way.  This was wayyy delicious, so much better than store bought!  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice though so I used nutmeg, cinnamon & cloves.  I don't think I used as much sugar as it calls for either, didn't need it.

Awesome. Spicy and delish. I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar and (due to laziness) didn't peel the apples. I just chopped them up and threw them in. Even the baby loved it!

Nothing makes your house smell better!  I too reduced the sugar (after trying it once as written) to 1/2 cup and upped the spice to 1 tsp, and used the pumpkin pie spice II recipe from here.  My DD can't get enough of it.  If you're making it when your littles are around, be sure to slice up an apple for them, or they'll be stealing them as you slice them for the crockpot!

Couldn't get any easier than this!  A lot like pie filling!  I used about 1/2 the sugar w/ Fuji apples.

I've made this a couple times. I liked it better the first time I made it, when I didn't have pumpkin pie spice or nutmeg and looked up what was in apple pie spice. That time I used cloves and cinnamon. I made it by the recipe this time, and I didn't like it as well until I added a little cloves in as well. It is still pretty good based on the recipe, though.

I made this for the first time and it was delicious.  It made the house smell so good and it tasted great.  Even my picky 17 year old thought is was really good.

I do something similar but add cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice. My friends think I'm crazy (until they taste it), but I also add 2 tbsp of butter. I just throw everything in the crockpot all at once in the beginning.

The best applesauce I've ever made!  Easy!  The only change I made was I added the sugar and spices at the beginning of cooking and shortened the cooking time to 5 hours.  Delicious!!

Followed the recipe exactly and it didn't disappoint! My toddler LOVES it too! I am off to the store to get more apples to can multiple batches. I put mine in a food processor after it was finished to make it super smooth just like my grandma makes it. :0)

This is by far the best applesauce I have ever had. I used a mixture of different apples after going apple picking. I used 3 Tbsp of Splenda brown sugar and about 3 generous dashes of pumpkin pie spice. Let it cook in the slow cooker on high for about 4 hours and there was no need to mash the apples it did it on its own. Going to make another batch in a day or two and try using less brown sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This is not good at all!! Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it's hard to do a slow cooker the wrong way. I peeled and thinly sliced 5 apples and put them in at 10 this morning - it's now 11:30pm and they're still not done!! I've put in some lemon juice to speed up the 'mushing' process... I'm hoping it works so I can go to bed :P Sorry... maybe I'm just a noob, the recipe really does sound delicious but I think I'll try it on the stove top next time.

10 Stars! This was amazing! I used 3 different kinds of sweet apples, so I left out the sugar entirely. I mixed cinnamon and nutmeg into a 1/4 cup of water and threw that in right at the beginning. Woke up this morning to the smell of warm apple pie... I put a few spoonfuls over my oatmeal at breakfast and it was heaven!

Excellent. I was so excited to make this recipe and it did not disappoint. It was delicious. I thought it was just a tad tart because I used Early Gold apples, some of the first of the season. May use half gala and half tart apples like another reviewer. Thanks!

I used very soft and very very tart freshly picked apples from a local orchard... AMAZING RECIPE!! Agree with other reviewers re: sugar -- but I used MORE because I used tart apples..... I also cut into cubes to give it a chunky appearance.... Used just cinnamon and used a LOT of it because that is the way we like it.... DEFINATELY A KEEPER!! Have NEVER made applesauce in slow-cooker... this is the way to go, easy, simple, no fuss and smells DELICIOUS!  Thank you so much for this delightful recipe!

Since the recipe did not specify which apples to use I tried a variety (about 4 flavors; 2 apples of each). That way if some were too sweet others would balance them out. I added no water and yet 7 hours later I had made apple soup. Far, far too watery to be applesauce. Also, the end result was too sweet to be edible. I tried again later with a different set of apples, less sugar, and more spice and got the same result: too sweet and watery.

Love this recipe.  Using sweet apples such as Fuji's and Jonagolds, we found we didn't need much brown sugar...1 Tablespoon was plenty.  The kids happily eat this any day of the week.  The smell in the kitchen while cooking is amazing.

This was very good. I used a variety of apples and they werew not too sweet. I used about 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I added everything in when I began to cook it. Very easy and delish! :) Will make again!

Very, very easy. I did increase the spice to 1 tsp as suggested in earlier reviews. Next time I will just use 1/2 tsp of spice and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I added the spice and brown sugar at the beginning of cooking. Next time I will use 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead but still add them and the spices at the beginning of cooking.

This is a very good recipe.  After cooking it all night in the slow cooker, I served it for breakfast the next morning over hot buttered biscuits. I did have to mash the apples because they just didn't "mush up" on their own.  It may have been because I used Gala apples.  It really was very good and we'll definitely use this recipe again.

This is wonderful! Used 1/2 the brown sugar called for as my apples were already pretty sweet. So easy and so good served warm. We will be making this again and again. Thanks for such a great recipe.

Tasted very good.  I left the skins on the apples and my boyfriend said he liked that even better.  Also, a friend at work said I should bottle it and give for presents.

I, too, had too many apples in my fridge. What a better way to use them up. I used gala, fuji and granny smith apples. I reduced the brown sugar to about 2/3 cup. I think the water was a bit too much. Next time I think I will use only 1/3 c. But over-all. This was very good. I prepared this late in the evening to be ready for dinner the next day. I just put it in the fridge when I got up in the morning. Delicious.

Really, really good. I used Northern Spies, one Granny Smith and one Honeycrisp. I added the juice of one lemon and reduced the sugar by 1/4 c. The end result was tart but delicious. I will make this again, maybe even this week while I still have lots of apples on hand!

This was the best applesauce I've ever had.  I did make a few modifications though, I used Jonagold apples (8), the apples were sweet enough, therefore  I omitted the brown sugar.  After only 7 hours of cooking, it was great.  A definate keeper.

This was super easy and really easy.  I made it a week ago according to the directions, a bit sweet, making it again tonight reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup and upping the pumpkin pie spice to 1 teaspoon. This is wonderful mixed with granola

Admittedly I followed other users and reduced the sugar and water, but this was fantastic!

I made this after we had too many apples from a family apple picking trip. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup because we had sweet gala apples. It was perfect !

This was my first time making this recipe! Super easy and delicious! My husband who doesn't like applesauce put it over his vanilla bean ice cream and said it was awesome! I did make a double batch and only used 1 cup of brown sugar and used 1 tsp. Of cinnamon and 1 tsp. Of pumpkin pie spice. Will make again! I used a combination of "Jonathan" Apple's and "king" Apple's from our trees.

EXCELLENT! We like ours a bit less sweet so I cut back on the brown sugar and used 1/4 cup.

I made 2 batches. First batch, following the recipe, was WAAAY too sweet—too much brown sugar; it tasted like apple pie filling.  Sooo, I cut back a little on the sugar in the second batch, added 2 more apples and 2 pears. I combined the 2 batches—much better

Absolute favorite! I love this recipe. It's so simple which is probably why it is so good. I love honey crisp apples, but any apple works well when cooked slowly.

Excellent! I had about 2 pounds of apples already cut up, left over from another recipe and they had the skins still on. It helped with keeping the apple sauce a little thicker if you like it that way.

Have not made yet but, after looking at many reviews, I will modify it a bit.  Something I noticed was that so many make this for just a small amount.  When we make applesauce, we make enough to can in pints (or freeze), rather than relying on the fridge to keep it long enough without molding.  So many reviewers said they hated peeling the apples.  There's a great variety of apple peelers, at affordable prices, which make it much easier and faster to peel.  If made very often, it will easily pay for itself.  Quite a few mentioned it being too watery.  It needs to be cooked down to be thicker if too much water was used, especially.  Our apples are quite sweet with a bit of tartness.  Because we have our own tree (which totally overproduced this year), my husband hadn't sprayed them at all this year, therefore, they are organic, also.  Unfortunately, organic often means "ugly" since they aren't sprayed for pests or disease.  My granddaughters have always loved the plain applesauce with nothing added, so some batches are made for them.  My husband wants something more added to it, so will do that for him.  Plan to use the plain as a replacement for oil in some recipes.  People who have their own trees, that produce a lot, could also make fruit leather using thicker applesauce, make apple butter, or simply slice and dry in a dehydrator or oven.  Many wonderful apple recipes out there!

I just used brown sugar  and cinnamon . The smell in the house was heavenly and reminded me of  growing up during the fall. It's simple , easy to make and tastes heavenly. I added a dollop of cool whip on top. Delicious !  Will definitely satisfy  that sweet tooth This is now in my rotation of desserts or snack.

I had no idea how to make applesauce so I started with this recipe but read the reviews. I made it today and used 9 gala apples, 1/2 cup of water, 1 tsp of apple pie spice and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. The rest of the directions I followed and after it was done in the crock pot, I let it cool. It was not too sweet, it was not too watery... it was delicious. Will make over and over again.

So easy. I made some modifications based on what I had available: 3 big gala apples and 2 small pears, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and 1 star anise (for licorice flavor to make it less sour). Put everything in the crock pot for 8 hours overnight on low. Probably could have been less time if I was watching it during the day. Excellent recipe for using up my fall fruits. Will definitely make again!

Tastes exactly like how I would think fall tastes like. Wonderful! I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it still turned out great. :) Instead of water I used some Trader Joe's spiced apple cider that I had in the fridge.

not bad.  You don't need ANY sugar, depending on what kind of apples you use.  I never put sugar in mine, and add a piece of a cinnamon stick!  Always turns out great!

In my book, all applesauce is great. But why not eliminate sugar altogether and add at end, if necessary? Some said this was too watery...just leave lid off and “cook down”.  Mix and match apples and leave skins ON! Then at very end, run thru a colander. Healthier and you’ll get a nice color.

Awesome recipe!
Followed what a lot of others noted in reviews/comments and cut brown sugar back to 1/2 cup. That was plenty sweet (more would have been too much). Made a great warm fall dessert!
Didn't realize how little it would make. Will likely be doubling next time.

Excellent. Next time I will add half of the amount of water, it was too watery for my tastes. Also I added cinnamon instead of pumpkin spice (didn't have any) and added a little lemon juice to keep the apples from turning too quickly but it nicely balanced the sugar.

Really like this recipe because it is easy and tasty!
Was really lazy once and tried it without peeling the apples - but that's a necessary step - won't skip that one again!  :)

This is amazing but the sugar needs to be adjusted. After the first 6 hours, when it is time to add the sugar and spice, do a taste test for sweetness. I only needed to add a pinch of sugar and I love a sweet applesauce. Adjust for taste. 

I felt like the amount of spice was perfect. 

I suggest using a combination of gala and golden delicious apples. They are the sweetest apples that are readily available. Using more than one type of apple adds a more complex flavor. 

If you use those sweet varieties of apples, you might not need to add sugar at all! That makes for a great option for people who need to limit their sugar. 

Instead of water, add some apple juice. This also contributes to a natural sweetness. I use an organic pure gala apple juice with no sugar added though any apple juice should work fine. 

My family likes this so much, they request it as gifts!

I did make one addition.  I used apple pie spice and pumpkin pie spice in mine.  This is the second time I made this and it is a big hit for thanksgiving.  One of these days I'm going to double it and can it for later use in the winter.

OMG it was so yummy.  For the cook time I actually cooked the apples on high for about 4 hours  and I used 4 granny Smith apples and 4 gala apples. for now on I'm going to make my applesauce instead of buying it.  thank you for sharing the recipe.

As written, this is a good applesauce recipe.  I used it as a starting off point to make a perfect batch of applesauce.  

First, I don't use 8 apples.  I buy several packages of not-quite-perfect apples at a discount and use them to fill my slow cooker (peeled, cored, and sliced).  Instead of water, I use apple juice or cider.  I cut the brown sugar back to 2 or 3 tablespoons and sometimes use just cinnamon.  We like it a little chunky and served warm.  Perfect for topping oatmeal or just eating as-is.  Can be canned to make a nice gift or for longer storage.

plusses- will not scorch, doesn't need attention.  Yummy.

Minor minus- if you are doing a LOT- for canning, say-  the batch size is dictated by the size of the crock and may slow you down overall.  Not a thing wrong with the finished product.

I loved it! It was easy to make but I did make a few changes, I added a little less sugar and used cinnamon instead of pumpkin spice. I made this on a Sunday so I cut up the apples threw them in the slow cooker, came home from church put in the spices and sugar and it was basically done! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

In my opinion, it called for a little too much water and a little too much brown sugar. If I remade it I would only use 1/2 cup brown sugar and add water as needed. I felt like I couldn't taste the apple over the sugar. I didn't have pumpkin spice so I used cinnamon, dash of clove & nutmeg.  I might try it again next time with these modifications but it is still a pretty easy recipe to execute.

I've now made my 6th batch of this recipe and love it even more each time.  I used homemade pie spice recipe and love this batch even more!  For chunkier applesauce, cook it 6 hours not 8.  I use less water when I'm going for smoother applesauce, otherwise it turns out too watery.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

This was fantastic.  I changed the spices to 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp fresh grated nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cloves.  I cooked on low for 4h ours and then high form 1 hour.  I also put in  2 tablespoons butter it was done cooking and stirred to melt.

Delicious.  We ate it warm with ice cream.  I used apple cider instead of water and I just eye-balled the amount.  I reduced the amound of brown sugar to 1/4 cup and it was great but the bf thought it could be sweeter.  When I mentioned that it would probably taste like pie filling if I used more sugar, he gave me the "what's wrong with that?" face, so....

This recipe is much like mine.  But I made it without sugar and used good, flavorful apples, mostly gala.  It did not need sugar!  Also, you can use only cinnamon generously to taste, but I'm going to try the mixed spices too.

I loved this recipe! I have never made applesauce, and now I can never go back to store bought! The only change I made was to go down to 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I used gala, fuji, and Granny Smith apples. I don't know if my crockpot is particularly slow, and I could see that this was not cooking down very well on the low setting, so I cooked it mostly on high. It was fabulous, and even better the next day! Can't wait to make this again, and my grandchildren agree - they gobbled it up!

My favorite way to make applesauce! I always make it on New Year's Day to go with our pork and sauerkraut.  The brown sugar makes it taste very rich.  I have substituted apple pie spice or cinnamon for the pumpkin pie spice - and all three ways are delicious!  You can use an immersion blender if you want to purée it a little more when finished cooking as well.

This was very good! I had gala apples so I used them. I only had one fourth cup of brown sugar, and I'm glad I didn't put any more. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I added nutmeg. I didn't have eight hours so I put it on medium for four hours and it was perfect! Will definitely make it again.

Followed the recipe to the T. The Granny Smith apples I used were super tart so the amount of sugar called for was perfect. And I had no problems with amount of water either. No watery applesauce here. Will be making it again!

This applesauce was delicious!!! So much better than store bought. I took advice from other reviewers and added only 1/8 cup of brown sugar for a doubled recipe.  I still thought that was too sweet so when I made it again, I just sprinkled about 3-4 tablespoons of brown sugar on the apples and left it at that. It came out perfect for my taste. Thumbs up from neighbors who tried the first batch I made. Basically, just adjust the brown sugar to the degree of sweetness you like and leave everything else in the recipe as it is.

Delish!  The only change I made was to use mainly cinnamon, which a few shakes of pumpkin pie spice - just personal preference as I don't like ginger.  I think one could easily reduce the sugar depending on if you're using a sweeter Apple, or a more tart variety.  I used a potato masher to smush up the apples at the end.  Smells and tastes like fall in a mug!

My sister is sensitive to uncooked apples so store bought applesause is hit and miss.  This is always good to her and the whole family loves it.  I tend to add less water so it's not so soupy but other than that it is perfect.

I have a Squeezo food mill, so I used that to puree my whole apples after I had steamed them in an electric roaster with the water.  A big investment worth every penny, as you can make gallons of applesauce in one afternoon.  Once I had my puree, I added the other ingredients and then let it simmer.  Yum!  Delicious!  Loved the brown sugar and the apple pie spice.

This is a great recipe, I will definitely be making it again! Next batch will have more apples, a little less sugar and up the spice to 1 teaspoon.  I prefer to add more apples instead of less water, my family and I like our sauce chunky.

Try adding 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of bourbon. We call it drunken apples and it's a favorite. You might want to make 2 batches -- one with 100 proof and one without if you have children :)

Delicious.  Ended up subbing apple cider for the water and doubling the pumpkin pie spice.   There was extra water leftover, but that made an amazing apple cider/syrup.

I read the reviews first. Here's what I changed based on what I read:

1. 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2.
2. I waited until after the apples had cooked and tasted. I used tart apples, so I did 1/2 cup of brown sugar.
3. 1 heaping tsp of pumpkin spice 
4. A dash of nutmeg and cinnamon

Turned out AMAZING and just the right consistency for us.

So good! I decreased the brown sugar down to 1/2c because I used honey crisp apples. Next time I will double or even triple the recipe, since 8 apples cooked down to nothing, and the two of us will be finishing it all in one day!

Delicious!  And as easy as a recipe that involves peeling a lot of apples can be.  I ended up reducing the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and using apple pie spice and cinnamon since I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice.  I put it in the crockpot before I went to bed and added the sugar/spices when a woke up.  Worked perfectly.

Overall, a pretty decent recipe!  The pumpkin spice was a nice touch I wouldn't have thought of myself.  However, I found the sauce to be quite watery so next time I'll cut the water in half.  And too much sugar!  Definitely cutting the brown sugar down to probably 1/3 of a cup.  I'd give it an 8/10 :-)

Very good recipe!  My husband and I both love it.  I will make it again.  I really liked the spice.  I used McIntosh apples that were a bit tart so the recommended amount of sugar was fine.  You could easily reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe if you are concerned about sugar intake. I left the peels on the apples and cut them into 1/2" or so cubes (I used an apple corer which sped up the prep time).

We let the shell on, the kids like the extra oomph, and I usually mix my own fall spice for everything apple and pumpkin. 1/4 cup cinnamon (I like the less bite kind) with that as your base add small amounts of your fav spice. Use clove and or allspice sparingly. We love nutmeg that is usually my second ingredient, then a touch of cloves and allspice. Sometimes I add ginger too. Apple pie is awesome this way. And it meets your family likes, I mix in a plastic boul and shake and pass it around for everyone to sniff :-)

My mom makes this, except she makes it on the stove in a large stock pot.  I don't have a pot or kettle large enough to make a big batch of applesauce, so I started looking for other ways to do it.  Cooking it in a crock pot is such an awesome idea.  When I told my mom about it, she couldn't believe she'd never thought of it herself.  I used about half water and half cranberry juice for the liquid, to give it a bit more flavor, and, per a family tradition, I also add in a handful or two of cinnamon red-hot candies.  This gives it a nice cinnamon kick and makes the sauce a beautiful rose color.

I used Granny Smith apples and a mixture of cinnamon and nutmeg.  No need for the sugar--sweet enough.  I did not skin the apples but put it through a food mill when completed.  Excellent recipe!

This was really good, but I cut way back on the sugar to almost none. I gave it 4 stars because of the sugar. It would be entirely too sweet with the amount it calls for in the recipe. It was very easy. I was in a hurry to get it cooked for supper, so I put it on high instead of low and kept my eye on it and stirred it once in a while to make sure it didn't stick or anything.  My whole family really liked it!

I heeded the suggestion by other reviewers to use sweet apples and omit the sugar.  The apples sauce was plenty sweet.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so used a homemade mixture of nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves that I mixed in before cooking.  I also left the peals on. It took much longer (10 hrs.)to properly cook. It tasted good, but wasn't anything overly special. I'm sure I'll make it again, but will probably play some with the spices.

Hmmmm, it was too sweet for us but I may have done something wrong.
