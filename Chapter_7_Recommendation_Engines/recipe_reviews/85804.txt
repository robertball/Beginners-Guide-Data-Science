I made these as a request for a family member for Christmas Dinner.  It received RAVE reviews....  I did adjust the garlic powder down by 1/2 and added more of the cheeses to accomodate some of the guests at the dinner...wouldn't this be excellent with broccoli layered in along with the celery????

I served this with lamb shanks and it was a hit.  The flavors combine nicely and the cheese topping creates a crust that looks good and tastes good.  The only change I made was to use unpeeled scrubbed potatoes.

The dish was great. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and whole family loved it. I did make some changes as I increased the size. I used about 10 potatoes, 2 cans of soup, 3 real garlic cloves, and 2 real onions. Because of these changes the dish took about 3 hours to bake. I believe the changes made it worth it. Thanks

I didn't like it, it had too much garlic for my taste. My Mom didn't like it either.

Made for Easter. A little too "garlicy" for me. I might try to reduce garlic powder to 1 tbs.

My first shot at scalloped potatoes and they were great!  My toddlers even at them up!  Love the celery in it... always looking for a way to sneak in the veggies!  Thanks!

This was a good recipe but a little runny.  I will reduce the liquids by 1/4 - 1/2 cups next time.

I did make some changes. I left out all of the garlic, the celery, and used fresh chopped onion. I also used about 1/2 of the mustard powder. My family loved it!
