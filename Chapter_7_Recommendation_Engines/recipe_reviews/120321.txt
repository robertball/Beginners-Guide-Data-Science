I used brown rice & cooked it with 2 cloves of garlic on the stove top for 30 minutes before adding the spinach.  I also used all chicken stock instead of using the water. Otherwise I followed the recipe & it turned out great.

Yum, this was good. Because of the complaints of blandness, I threw in two cloves of garlic with the onion and used all chicken broth instead of chicken broth and water. I also uncovered the casserole for the last few minutes so the cheese would get browned. I'll be making this again!

I thought this was pretty good, but I think the cooking time is too long.  I used basmati rice and boiled it for 10 minutes.  I added the spinach and covered it, letting it sit for a few minutes for the spinach to wilt enough for me to stir it together, I dont think its necessary to cook it any longer.  The I baked it for 10 minutes, removed the cover and turned the broiler on to brown the cheese.  I used 2% swiss cheese and it was great!  Nice change from plain rice!

I actually used a 9x13 baking pan and left it uncovered in my oven so the cheese would be browned and there was more surface area for more cheese -- yummers!  I cooked it at 375 for just under 20 minutes.  I love this recipe, will definitely be making it again.  Leaves you satisfied without leaving a mark around your waist...

I did like some of the other folks and added about 4 cloves of garlic. I also put in a can of drained petit diced tomatoes. Everything else was as written and it turned out great!

I have made his twice, exactly as written and it is a great little side dish. I just wanted to say that I think this dish is just as good even before putting it in the oven. Just take it straight out of the pan onto your plate and sprinkle some cheese on it. Thank you for the recipe!

This was quite a nice addition to a weekday evening meal -nothing spectacular, but a quick and easy rice bake that was simple enough that it would be good along a variety of dishes. Everyone liked it and it was another great way to add some spinach to the children's menu.  Just enough for my husband to have some for his lunch the next day at work.

5 stars, but added the following: 1/4 t each Oregeno, red pepper flakes, garlic & onion powder; dash of salt and pepper. 1/2 c each sauteed cubed zucchini & fresh sliced mushrooms; 3/4 c cooked chicken breast in cubes, I omit the water but added 1 can cream of chicken soup. We used rustic rice mix (not long grain, but took same amount of time to cook).  Added 1/2 c each of shredded colby/Jack and sharp cheddar. 1/4 c shred Parmesan cheese. Mixed all together in large bowl, pored into casserole and baked with Parmesan sprinkled on top for about 15 minutes until warm. Yummy!!!!

Very nice, simple, and nutritious recipe. A great way to use up the abundance of spinach in my garden! I added 3 cloves of garlic with the onions and used all chicken broth instead of half water thanks to the advice of previous reviewers. I added less liquid than called for--just a little over 3 cups because I was afraid the rice would get mushy. When I transferred the rice to the casserole dish, I added cut-up pieces of leftover chicken and a tablespoon of lemon juice to give it a little kick of extra flavour. With the addition of the chicken it is a main dish meal! I agree with another reviewer, who felt that less cooking time is needed. I kept in the oven just until the cheese began to brown a bit--about 10 minutes.

This seemed like a great base recipe for a Greek Spinach Rice Casserole I used to make.  I made several changes to incorporate the two recipes for ease of cooking, lower the fat and sodium from my original and to perk up the taste a bit.  I will create another recipe with my changes.  Applause goes to Mathilda for a great base recipe that you can make your own.

I substituted chicken stock for the water and added diced chicken to make a casserole. Written as is, I think it would be a little bland. I added fresh garlic with the onion and seasoned the chicken for additional flavor. With the small changes I made my family enjoyed and asked for it again.

Not bad! I followed others' instructions by adding garlic and using all broth instead of broth and water. I also sauteed half a cup each of chopped zucchini and onion, and added 1/4 cup each of Parmesan and extra-sharp cheddar. I think it could probably use a teeny bit more salt but other than that...it works! Thanks.

Very bland, no taste at all.  I used all chicken broth (3-1/2 cups) and no water, and also added chicken.  Just nothing tasty at all.  Sorry Mathilda!

I took other reviewers' suggestions and used only 3 cups chicken broth. I also added 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg  (next time I will use more) along with the salt and pepper. Also next time I will add chopped or minced garlic to the onion saute and will add fresh mushrooms as well.

Wonderful recipe!! I needed to use up some baby spinach that I had in the refrigerator and so I made this along with Lemon-Garlic Tilapia from this website and it was sooo yummy - perfect combination! My husband absolutely LOVED it as well. Said he really didn't deserve such a good meal! lol. Great way to get spinach into him too haha!

I added garlic and nutmeg to spice things up a bit and used pecorino roman instead of parmesan.  I got rave reviews.  Almost risotto like.

We all enjoyed this.  I used 4 cups chicken broth instead of the half water/half chicken broth and added garlic powder.  I used frozen spinach and just thawed it and squeezed out all the excess water.  I also used basmati rice.  This had loads of flavor!! Will make again for sure!!

My husband enjoyed this.  That may sound pedestrian, but trust me, I don't get that often  -- usually polite non-commentary.  I browned two chicken breasts with the onion and substituted a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup for part of the water (because of the previous reviewers "bland" comment).  The spinach flavor came through quite strongly.

I found this to be a very flavorful and hearty side dish.  I used all chicken broth and added 2 garlic cloves when I added in the brown rice.  I decided to simmer the rice for 30 mins, and it still needed about 40 mins in the oven.  I'm sure it was due to using brown rice rather than white.  I will make this again.

This is my FAVORITE recipe on the entire site so far!! I have made this more than twice, and each time it is mouthwatering!  I don't change much, I just use brown rice instead of white and add marinated chicken breasts on top...YUM. (Although the first couple of times I ended up with crunchy rice because I couldn't figure out how much more water to add to compensate for the brown rice haha.)

Bland, but adding oregano, basil, garlic and cut up chicken really adds to it.

I stuck to the recipe with the exception of adding some mature cheddar but I found it rather bland.  Maybe it needed some chili flakes.

REALLY GOOD! I followed others' suggestions and used all chicken broth and added 2 cloves of garlic. Instead of just using onions I had this red, yellow, green pepper mix and sauteed that with the minced garlic. Instead of using fresh spinach, I used frozen and nuked it while the rice was steaming. After it steamed, I added in the spinach and just combined it together. Didn't add in the cheese (cause I didn't have any) and put a pat of butter on top. Didn't need to bake it in the oven, but if I had cheese, I might've baked it, but only for 10 minutes or so. Very good! Will definitely make again. =]

My husband and I both liked this. I used all chicken broth and added garlic powder. I halved the recipe for just the two of us. I also grated some white cheddar on top. I will make again and would serve to company.

Hugely successful!! Husband, toddler and myself all loved it! Used basmati rice, 4 cups reduced sodium chicken broth, and added garlic. Very tasty. Doesn't taste great as leftovers the next day though. Next time I'll make just enough for the meal.

I used jasmine brown rice, and increased the stovetop cooking time to 30 minutes. This came out a little soupy for me and not sure if it is supposed to be that way. It had great flavor though. I added some , garlic, red pepper flakes and oregano. And I did increase the cheese to half cup.

Yummy! I tried this recipe one night when I had a rice craving and I was not disappointed. The only problem is the cooking time is a bit long.

This is what I did: I sauteed 1/4 red onion in some olive oil, and added a clove of minced fresh garlic. I added one bag of Trader Joe's frozen brown rice. Tossed about 1/2 C. of frozen corn into the pan. Added some chopped fresh broccoli and some frozen spinach. Sauteed till just about done. Poured all of that into a sprayed baking dish. Put one layer of cooked chicken on top. Added two shredded carrots on top of mixture. Added 1/3 C. of grated Munster Cheese, and 1/4 C. of Parm. cheese. Then I added a mixture of: 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 C. of plain yogurt mixed in. (Next time I wold use Cream of chicken soup mixed with a bit of milk instead of cream of the cream of mushroom/yogurt mixture). I baked it at 375, covered for 25 minutes.   Very good, warm, filling dinner.

I added garlic and extra cheese and this still was bland.  Maybe cutting back on the rice would help?!

I thought this recipe was great.  I added a little garlic and used         more broth than water and it turned out awesome.  My 17 month old loves it.  She's eating spinach!!

I prepared this as written, with the exception of adding the onion. I did add some onion and garlic powder though. I felt like this was very bland, and my rice was pretty mushy. If I make this again, I'll definitely add way more seasonings, and I'll cook the rice according to the package directions.

This was very good.  I used a box of Near East Rice Pilaf - followed directions on box using half water 1/2 chicken broth  I figured that would add more flavor with out too much salt as there is plenty of salt in the spice packet that comes in the rice as well as the parmesan cheese.  Also, I added 1 cloved of garlic to the rice while it was cooking.  I omitted the salt the recipe called for and I used parmigiano-reggiano.  With these changed it wasn't bland at all and pretty darn good!

I was looking for a quick, easy recipe to use a whole mess of fresh spinach from a neighbor's garden.  This recipe did the trick.  I probably added more spinach than was called for since I had a lot on hand.  I also used brown rice since that's what I have in my pantry.  I did not find it bland at all but I don't usually measure salt and pepper when cooking - I just go according to taste.  My husband loved it, I was able to whip it up for dinner in no time, I had all the ingredients on hand  - a clear winner in my book.  I will use this over and over again.

This was a nice weekday side dish.  I added about 1tsp Better Than Bouillon (chicken) due to some reviewers' comments on the blandness of the dish; also mixed in about 1/4c shredded parmesan, in addition to extra parmesan topping which I broiled for a few minutes until it was bubbly and slightly browned.  Thanks for the recipe, Mathilda!

This was rather bland.  Reading the ingredients, I kind of expected that it would be but I thought maybe the flavors would magically combine to create something really tasty.  Nope.  It wasn't terrible, but I ended up putting a lot of hot sauce on top.  This is a good base recipe to create a vegetable/rice/cheese casserole but I would definitely suggest dressing it up a bit more.
