This soup is very tasty!  The only changes I made were the following:  I sauteed the beef with the onion and garlic before adding them to the soup.  Instead of the ramen and the spice packets (because of the fat content of the ramen), I used the soft Asian noodles found near  won ton wrappers in the store, and used beef broth instead of water and I doubled the amount.  I also cut the soy sauce in half since the beef broth had salt.

I make this soup often, it's delicious.  For a change, I use 3 boneless chicken breasts cut up, change the Ramen to chicken flavor, and add cut up mushrooms.  It's a keeper!

Wow! This is really delicious! I can't get over just how quick and easy this is! I only have one suggestion, and that is to crush the ramen noodles in their package prior to adding to the pot. I didn't and ended up having to deal with long, long strings of noodles that made eating this soup quite comical! This is gonna be a favorite this winter I can tell. I always keep frozen containers of browned meat, onion and garlic - this will be a snap to prepare!

What a great, quick recipe! I added some crushed red pepper to give it some zing.  You could also add some more veggies.  Perfect as a side dish or main entree.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

I modified this a lot to be healthier and fresher. First, I didn't use ramen - I used udon noodles (cooked first, then added to finished broth at the end). I made the broth by using chicken stock, fresh minced garlic AND ginger, soy sauce, oyster sauce and stirfrying the onion in sesame oil. I used leftover cooked ground turkey I had on hand. I also added mushrooms. After dishing up the broth and noodles I added the bok choy (it just wilts a bit, doesn't cook to death), and garnished with some chopped green onion, cilantro and lime. Add sriracha or other hot sauce for added effect. It was simple, pretty easy and still a great dinner!

This was quick and easy with items on hand.  I used onion powder and ginger powder and, instead of bok choy I used romaine. It came out more of a noodle dish then a soup.  It was great.

Not a low cal dish.  Those noodles come pre-fried.

I should have known this wouldn't be good based on the ingredients, but I wanted to use up some Bok Choy I had on hand.  It didn't have much flavor and wasn't worth the sodium overload.

We loved the recipe! I didn't "drain off fat, and rinse meat using a colander," however, as I only buy 93% fat-free hamburg, and there was virtually no fat to even drain off.

Fantastic! I followed directions and it came out great. I didn't have minced garlic, but one large garlic clove works just as well. The photo doesn't show the bok choy leaves, but I cut the hole thing up and put it all in. Wonderful dish!

Nice way to use Bok Choy, I also added Tatsoi since it came in my CSA this week.  Used 8oz of regular Chinese noodles instead of the ramen - could use less noddles.  Since I didn't have a seasoning packet I seasoned the beef with salt and pepper and then used garlic powder plus beef bouillon when I added the veggies.

Yummy.   I added mushrooms, shredded carrots and used reduced sodium beef broth.  But I doubled the broth using 1/2 H20 and 1/2 broth (adjusted seasonings accordingly).  I also added a couple T of sweet chili sauce.  Then at the end I garnished with cilantro, green onions and red pepper flakes.  I think this might also be good with stew meat done all day on low in the crock pot on low.  Then you could just finish off on high an hour or so before serving.

This recipe was a Good start but I had to add an additional teaspoon of ginger and a tablespoon of brown sugar to get a some real flavor other than just salt.  I also used beef boullion and rice noodles instead of ramen noodles and their soup packets (rice noodles are much lower in fat). I also loaded up with different veggies.  This is a great basic recipe though!

I make this when the rest of the family is having burgers since I don't like burgers lol! I have also made a variation by adding a handful of frozen veggies in or cooked fresh ones. Also I add garbanzo beans (chick peas) or mushrooms, water chestnuts and so on. It's endless what you can add to this to make it your own. Good dish!

It was really good.  I was nervous to put the ginger in it, because I don't like ginger, but I didn't even taste it.  I also added celantro.  Next time I am going to add some bean sprouts and shredded carrots.

We loved this but made some  changes for flavor and out of necessity.  First I stirfried the onion and garlic and one carrot  in a generous teaspoon of sesame oil and a little butter.  The sesame oil added a great flavor. Normally I use fresh ginger but I didn't have any so I use the freeze dried ginger and it was excellent in that soup. I didn't have bok choy so we used broccoli crowns that we threw in for the last three minutes and it was perfect.  And I had just bought a big bag of rice Ramen noodles from Costco and not those little packets, which turned out great. I didn't need the seasoning packet because we added the sesame oil and salt and pepper and I did the noodles in chicken broth.  The last change we did instead of ground beef we had teriyaki meatballs from Costco and we cut up five of those and threw it in! Super tasty !!

I made half of the recipe since its just my husband and me. In addition to bok choy, I also added carrots and mushrooms. I cooked the garlic and ginger w/ the ground beef and used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I thought it was good and super quick. If I make this again, I will omit the oil.

This was an excellent base recipe on which you can make this soup your very own and adjust ingredients to your own taste. I made the following adjustments to my soup. I used ground chicken instead of beef and chicken ramen (broken up). I only used one of the seasoning packets but added a heaping tbsp of chicken bouillion powder. I used grated fresh ginger instead of powdered and I replaced the veggie oil with sesame oil. I doubled the amount of water and added diced mushrooms, celery and carrots along with the bok choy. I always keep chopped veggies in ready to go freezer bags in the freezer. This made making this soup even quicker. This is one that I will make again.

YUM!!!! I didn't have any bok choy but I did add a small can of mushrooms to this and even my picky 8 yr old ate it up! This was very easy, economical and it was nice to be able to whip something up with pretty much most things I have on hand. Will definately try it with the bok choy the next time but this is a keeper for sure! I used 1 pkg of chicken ramen and 1 pkg of spicy chicken ramen and it was so yummy!!! :) Thanks for sharing!!!

I thought this was a great recipe for a very quick dinner idea.  It is very versatile.  I made mide with shrimp and lemon-lime flavored ramen noodles.  I added a few dashes of Thai fish sauce and a little bit more soy sauce.  I also added an extra 1 1/2 cups of water.  My kids (age 3 and 2) loved it.  They called the ramen noodles worms and the bok choy grass.  This will now be called "Worms and Grass" Soup in my household.  It is going into my recipe file because it was on the table in 20 minutes.

Super easy when you want a little spin on your ground beef and ramen. I added green peppers and used coconut aminos instead of soy. Also a teaspoon of fish sauce and rice vinegar, with a teaspoon of sugar.

The recipe definitely needs some adjustment  - too much ramen noodles - more water and broth needed but it is very tasty.Bok choy should be cut in smaller pieces and put
in the soup at the very end of the cooking, not the
beginning, gets too soggy - would probably make again with
the corrections  Maxine

This sounds like a quick & easy lunch! I just really wanted to say that I am SICK of hearing about sodium this an sodium that! To those too ignorant to know; "Sodium" is a metallic element that bursts into flame when exposed to water.
Another thing I'm sick of: "Organic" foods; this is "organic,  that is organic"...  Listen, Stupid People; if it was not "organic", it would be a rock or something similar to a rock and therefore Not Edible! On the other hand, Wood Is organic because it is or was a living organism;  But, you Still don't want to Eat it!!  It just drives me up the Wall;  listening to people who are too stupid to realize that they have No Clue What They Are Talking About!  I don't like going to the "Whole Foods Market" because Everyone who works Or Shops there are former flower children still having flashbacks from the '60's or are having inherited acid flashbacks from their parents (from the '60's) !!  People, PLEASE!!   Retire the word "organic"!! No one knows what it really means anyway!!

I used ground turkey and then substituted chicken broth for the water so focus was poultry instead of beef. Also used stir fry veggies because I didn't have bok choy. My son said it was the best idea yet and gave it two thumbs up. Will definitely make this again since it was so easy.

I didn't have high expectations for this but was really surprised with the great flavours! Only changes that I made were that I used chicken stock rather than water, and I used cut up pieces of beef steak rather than ground beef.

This recipe was so yummy. My hard to please kids and hubby ate it and loved it as well. The only thing I changed was to use Romain lettuce instead of the bok choy. I think the bok choy would make it even better. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was quick and easy, but the textures just didn't mix for me.  Mostly, I think it was because the ramen noodles were too soft.  My husband and I both ate it, and thought it was okay though.  Maybe next time I'll try a different pasta.  Or perhaps rice.

Wonderful combination of flavors. Quick and easy and family friendly. We omitted the onion (hubby hates onion) and added an extra package of noodles for the kids. It was a popular and very easy dinner!

My family loves this, though I altered the recipe to drop the salty noodle and spice stuff.  Shifted everything to fresh spices and vegetables as well as tasty Udon noodles.

Well worth the effort no matter what ingredients you use!

Quick, easy and tasty!
Added some sliced mushrooms and used fresh grated ginger.
In addition,  added low sodium beef broth and substituted smaller portion of sesame oil for vegetable oil.  
Second time also added some shredded carrots had on hand.  If you like sesame oil, suggest a drop or so for garnish when serving. (Hot Chili sesame oil is especially good garnish)
(Breaking up ramen noodles before hand was a good tip.  May also try it with low carb noodles instead of ramen noodles.)

We liked this recipe. I did not use the Ramen noodles as we don't like all the preservatives in the packets so we used the pre-made noodles from Costco.  It turned out very good and I would make it again. The only thing I will look for is a Asian seasoning to add for more flavor.

Not a bad start. I like more flavor and spice. I added some Red Pepper flakes for heat. I also sauteed the meat with the onion and garlic to incorporate flavor. We added more veggies in to. Like I said not bad but not great.

I added the ground beef fat in the soup. It adds extra flavor. Instead of using the ramen noodels, i used chinese  Vermiceli noodles instead but still used the flavor packes of the ramen. If the noodles soaked too much of the water, i added a cup and a half extra of water. And the results were amazing! It taste EXACTLY like Pho.

I made the recipe as it is presented, less the ramen flavoring, but added some mushrooms.  The flavor is very good, but this soup needs to be eaten same day, as the ramen absorbs the broth and turns mushy.  I may try to do this one again, but  add the broth/meat/bok choy to some fresh Asian noodles at time of eating.

This was a delicious and easy soup. I didn't have bok choy in the house so I used romaine lettuce. It worked well. I also added sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I made this change as another reviewer suggested. Thanks for this recipe it was exactly what I was looking for.

I used Italian sausage instead of the ground beef and left out the garlic.  I also used 2 baby bok choy heads, since that is what I had on hand.  I thought the flavor was wonderfull, but next time I think I'll use 3 baby bok choys and only 3/4lb of sausage.  Thanks!

Good, quick recipe.  I used a large head of bok choy and substituted 100g soba noodles and 4 bouillon cubes for the ramen.  I also added another tsp or two of grated fresh ginger, doubled the garlic and threw in a cup of chopped cilantro.  Just realizing I skipped the soy sauce and oil.. might try toasted sesame oil next time.  Great recipe, thanks Linda!

Excellent.  This has been a big hit.  There's just one alteration I made, and that was to replace the ramen noodles with beef broth and egg noodles.  The result is quite tasty and still very flavorful.

Wow! So easy and yet so good!! I have made this twice now and everybody loves it! Next time I'd like to add mushrooms and maybe some sesame oil to it, but it's great as written!

This was really good. I used rice noodles instead of ramen and I mad the broth from scratch. I also added sliced ginger root and sliced carrots. I served with soy sauce, fried tofu and steamed rice.

this was great- i'm used to just playing it by ear, so all i did was take a good look at the ingredients, gathered up what i'd need, and winged it, not bothering to measure.  it turned out great.  i cooked the noodles separately so each person could add their own and they wouldn't get soggy.  my family and my brother's bandmates loved it and are already asking me to make it again soon.  oh, and it tastes even better the next day!

Wow!  This was really good and easy.  I'm glad I did an ingredient search for ground beef & bok choy because I'll be making this again but I think I'll increase the ginger. I'll try some of the variations suggested by other reviewers - the shrimp with lemon-lime sounds great!

This was quick and easy.  Tasty for the effort involved.  Not as much fluid as I had expected, but more would have probably been too many servings.

What a time saver...I used lean ground veal and it was perfect..added a few green onions at the end and a sprinkle of minced coriander leaves...what a treat.
