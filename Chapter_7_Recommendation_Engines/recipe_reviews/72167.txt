My husband and I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit, though the next time I make it (and we agreed that it was definitely tasty enough to ensure there will be a next time - with a few modifications). The only real changes I made this time was adding some orange zest & roasted garlic & onion powders to the sauce as well as the breading mix. 

For a side dish I just made rice, but I used chicken broth instead of water for the rice and added a tablespoon (or so) of orange zest. It came out wonderfully.

When I make this next time, I'll reduce the oil in the sauce (use less than the 1/4 suggested), it was overpoweringly oily tasting some bites.  I'll use frozen concentrated OJ instead of fresh next time to add more orange flavor (and add a bit more to make up for the less oil). I also don't think I reduced the sauce as much as I should have (I did reduce it to half the original but it never seemed to coalesce), so I’ll try and be patient.  One other odd thing was that the orange slices seemed to soak up a lot of the alcohol in the dish, so each bite of the orange itself was a bit overwhelming.  

I believe the prep timing is off on this recipe (it says 15 minutes but it took that long just to slice and soak the chicken, not to mention the breading & frying), I don’t think the reduction is taken into account. I was reducing for more than 20 minutes before I got impatient and decided to move things along.

While I thought this was a very nice dish and would happily recommend it to others, I do have a recipe for a Grand Marnier Chicken that I like better.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, along with the S&P called for.  I could not bring myself to fry this in an entire cup of olive oil, so just put a touch of EVOO in the pan, sauteed/browned the chicken and it worked fine. Used a pat of butter, in place of the missing olive oil, for the wine, broth, OJ reduction.  If I make it again, I think I'd like to do what reviewer EagleA suggested and use OJ concentrate, rather than OJ, for more intense orange flavor.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Nurse24HR!

I was actually looking for a recipe to finish the turkey portion I "overbought" the day before and I had a taste for orange.  This recipe turned out to be the perfect solution.  I tried it again with chicken and I can confirm that it is indeed the BEST chicken recipe ever! This mix of parmesan, orange and chicken just seem like it was meant to fit together.  Try it out, you won't regret! Thanks for this great recipe!

***** Great *****
Will Do again - No Question about it.

The Best Chicken Breast recipe that I have found.

(Try using "Tenders")

The Reducing takes some time, and should be figured into the Time alotments.

Excellent recipe.  Thank you so much.  Made it for a dinner party with a  trained chef.  She loved it.  As did everyone else.  My husband was a little aprehensive about the orange juice and wine but said it was really tasty.  Plenty of breading mix for the number of chicken breasts.  Will definitely make it again and again.

YUM!  This was delicious.  I used four chicken breasts (I didn't cut them up into smaller tenders) and I browned them in 3 tablespoons of olive oil.  A full cup seemed like way too much.

This has become a staple in my house since I discovered it a year or so ago - but I just realized that I had never rated it. Over time I have adapted it to make the breading a little easier, and realized that thesauce is even better with southern comfort. Thanks!

This recipe is a HUGE hit and very easy to prep.  

Reduction sauce time can be cut down a little by using frozen concentrate OJ instead of regular Orange Juice.  

Recipe is easily prepared ahead of time and can be covered and left in fridge 1-2 days.  Transports easily, keeping Grand Marnier off until last minute.

I prepare this at home in my kitchen with my utensils, then take it to my husband's firehouse to bake.  They love it!

Excellent chicken.  I was trying to find something really good to make for my daughters wedding reception.   I made it twice.  The second time I substituted orange juice concentrate for the orange juice.  it gave it a little more orange flavor.  I bought a cheaper brand of the orange flavored brandy.  I bought a less expensive version of Grand Marnier, instead of $35 a bottle it cost me $21.

There are so many ways to tweak this recipe to make it your own. Change gran marnier to triple sec to save money. Change gran marnier to Chambord a raspberry flavored liquor. Use reduction time to prep side dishes. I have served this several times and everyone loves it.

This is one of my go-to meals for holiday's and other times when I have to feed a lot of people.  For Easter I tripled the chicken and doubled the sauce, using oj concentrate instead of juice, and it got raves.  I make it a day in advance, adding the Grand Marnier right before putting in the oven and it's a great entertaining meal.  The sauce is great not only on the chicken but with rice on the side and it's even better as leftovers.  Great recipe!!1

This was touted as the "best chicken I've ever had" by two people at my dinner party. Definitely use the concentrate- it's a perfect sauce when you do that. It takes A LOT more time to do than allotted in the recipe (more like 3 hours). Also, it's delicious with saffron rice and Beth's crunchy Romaine Salad (also on Allrecipes). We'll definitely have it again.

This is a keeper. I didn't have any Grand Marnier so I used Triple Sec. I also have issues with dairy so I omitted the parmesan cheese and it was excellent without it.

Others have said they will switch to orange juice concentrate for more orange flavor. I disagree... the light orange flavor was superb.

Served with potatoes roasted in olive oil, garlic and a hint of tarragon. Absolute perfection!

Word of caution: The 15 minutes prep time is way too low. I reduced my liquid on a medium heat and ended up turning up the burner to medium high after about 25 minutes.

Not sure what I did wrong on this one.  The sauce was okay, but had a touch of bitterness. Perhaps I cooked it too long.  I tried the orange concentrate rather than orange juice as others had suggested. Perhaps that was the problem.  I had way too much of the bread crumb topping leftover.  I would suggest cutting the crumbs and parmesan to 1/2 cup each.  That would've been plenty to dredge the chicken in.  I would also skip the orange slices.  Although pretty, I think they made the chicken a bit soggy.  All in all, the recipe was pretty good.  I will give it another try and hope for better results next time.

It would be helpful to know how long it takes to reduce the sauce. It took forever. Everything else was fine.

Very very good!  I also used the frozen concentrate and all of the orange rind I could grate from the oranges I sliced.  I then served it over brown rice.  Excellent flavor!

Okay tasting, sauce is a little strong.  Actually makes too much for a family of 3 1/2.  Chicken is fine, but should halve the breadcrumb/cheese coating and halve the sauce ingredients... *if* I make again.  I would rather just have the crunchy chicken.

I love this recipe and will make it again and again.  I made the mistake of using a 9x9 baking dish, so my chicken was swimming in sauce, but it was still so great.  Can't wait to make again for company.  I served it with baked rosemary potato wedges and grilled zucchini.

This is a great recipe.  I sprinkled some of the leftover breading on top of the chicken once it was in the baking dish since there is so much of it.  I still have about half of it left and am going to use it to bread some pork chops tomorrow.  I didn't do anything else different and it was perfect.  Thanks!

Wow, this is really great.  I made it alone just to try it and was very pleased.  Now, I'm trying a recipe to go with it that includes sw. potatoes, wh. potatoes and carrots.  a great company dinner.
