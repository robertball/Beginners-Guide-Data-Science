I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I had to "doctor" the recipe, as most of the previous reviews did as well. First, add more milk. The recipe calls for 2/3 cup, but 1 1/4 cup is about right. At least double the coconut flakes to 1/2 cup (I put in a whole cup) as well as double or triple the coconut extract. Finally, use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil for the muffins & the streusel topping. It imparts a wonderful flavor and is MUCH healthier (major source of MCT's, body recognizes them as an energy source first rather than store as fat) for you than vegetable oil, plus it goes with the whole coconut theme. It comes in a solid form, but melts at a fairly low temperature, so just microwave/warm it until it starts to liquefy then go nuts! Oh yes, reduce the amount of baking powder from 3 tsp to 2 tsp - this will help keep them from "overgrowing". Good luck and have fun!

These were amazing, although I did make some changed..
I used 1 cup of fresh coconut in the muffins
I also used coconut oil, and coconut milk instead of regular milk. The batter seemed a little thick (I may have just measured the flour wrong) so I added an extra egg and an extra bit of milk.. But with those modifications, these were the best muffins I've ever made!

I doubled the recipe and this made 18 muffins that rose A LOT (take a look at the amount of baking soda!). This made a really thick batter, so thick I checked my measurements again thinking for sure I had left out something! The muffins turned out really dense and cake like, not what I was looking for at all. It was almost like I made a biscuit recipe and put coconut extract in it, and not enough of it at that. The topping looked great, until I added the warm butter to the mix, then it was a blob of sugar. Leave the butter out, and sprinkle it on top instead of deal with a wet sugary mess! I'll keep looking for a coconut muffin recipe.

Confession #1: I despise it when people review recipes they've completely changed. Confession #2: I had to take a few liberties with this based on what I had handy, so I guess I'm one of those people.
I read the reviews before starting, and most of them complained about dryness. Despite this, I proceeded with the liquid/dry ration as written. I used w/w flour, and halved the baking powder (3 tsps seemed like an awful lot to me). For the milk I used vanilla almond milk, as that was what I had. I otherwise stuck with the recipe except that my daughter dumped in quite a bit more than 1/4 cup of coconut - she ended up adding maybe 1 cup. Even with that, the batter didn't seem any thicker to me than many other recipes I've done (like, say, morning glories). I got 10 standard sized muffins out of this, and baked them at 350 for 15 minutes and they were perfect. Fluffy, tender and very coconutty! Thank you for sharing your recipe :-)

AMAZING MUFFINS. I made suggested changes, adding 1/2 cup coconut, and strawberries. I added 2/3 cup unsweetened coconut cream and unsweetened flaked coconut. They came out SUPER FLUFFY and just PERFECT. Even though the topping was a bit to sweet for me, everyone absolutely LOVED them.

Very thick batter almost as thick as cookie dough. The end result was a very flour-y tasting muffin with dense consistency more like a scone. The only change I made was making these in a mini-muffin pan. I'm sorry but, I really didn't care for these at all. :-(

These muffins turned out very moist and fluffy. The consistency was perfect. I followed the directions exactly other than adding 1/2 Cup of Coco Lopez(cream of coconut) instead of coconut extract and using soymilk instead of milk. The topping is delicious also. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This is great base for coconut muffins, something I have never eaten before.  As I love all things cocount, I thought I'd give this a try and I'm glad I did.  Needs more though....definately more coconut and coconut extract.  The 'strusal' topping baked off my muffins and ended up all over the muffin tin...but the texture was awesome.  Very fluffy.  I would definately recommend that you give this a try!!

These were really good! I added more coconut and skipped the butter in the topping. Nice way to use up some extra coconut with ingredients I had around the house!

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars for the minor alterations I had to make in the recipe.  The recipe seems good as is; I ran out of coconut extract, so I used vanilla instead.  But I did happen to have coconut milk and used it instead of regular, and my batter was very dry.  I ended up using nearly a whole 15 oz. can of coconut milk to get the batter to a decent consistency.  I don't think had I used a 2/3 cup of regular milk it would have been sufficient in making the batter moist.  Outside of that I skipped using cinnamon, I added some oats and toasted the coconut to make the topping , and I diced some fresh strawberries and folded them into the batter.  They were very tasty and my kids loved them.  I had to bake them a tad longer than 20 minutes for them to be fully done.

Yummy!  And coconut is so good for you.  I bake this using coconut oil, coconut milk instead of milk (altho it's good that way, too), 1 tsp. vanilla instead of coconut extract, rapadura for sugar, and half unlbeached flour and half whole grain spelt flour.  I double the recipe and thaw as needed for the kids' breakfasts.

I modified this recipe a bit to make it healthier and to suit our tastes. I used 3/4 cup ap flour, 1 cup ww flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ, used 1/2 cup plain greek yogart in place of the oil, increased the coconut extract to 1 tsp, and doubled the flaked coconut. I aslo just sprinked some flaked coconut on top of the muffins instead of making the topping. Like so many others stated this is some thick batter, and I got 12 muffins from it. We really enjoyed these muffins and will definetly be making them again. Thanks for the recipe:)

I LOVE coconut and was so excited to try this recipe. After reading all the other reviews i am now SHOCKED that no one mentions how really, super wrong something in this recipe is. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH LIQUID AT ALL! If i followed this recipe exact, (which i did to start out), the muffin mix was more of a dough! EW! So i had to add way more milk and then i added a little more coconut extract thinking the milk may have taken away some of the coconut flavor. These muffins were just still SO DRIED OUT! I baked them only 12 minutes and they were done. I was really dissapointed. Something is just not right with this recipe.....?

These are delicious, fabulous, beautiful muffins.  Didn't change a thing, and they turned out even better than I hoped.  Although hard to get a good photograph because of the lack of color in the muffins.  The coconut toasts on top along with the sugar, which gives the top a nice crunch.  Try these, if you like coconut, you will love these.

I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the amount of coconut and milk, replaced the extract with vanilla at a double amount, and I used half baking powder, half baking soda. The muffins looked very beautiful, plump, and round, but are pretty flavorless and a bit dry. I think next time I may add in some coconut yogurt, use vanilla flavored soymilk, and honey for part of the sugar.

I made these this morning and they were really good!  We are actually spending the winter in Mexico and the coconut that is available at the market is awesome and most of the other ingredients are readily available - the exception being coconut extract - I used vanilla.  I did add more coconut, a heaping 1/2 cup.  They didn't raise a LOT as was indicated in a previous review, that may have something to do with the sea level here.  Thank you for a great recipe that I will be using a lot, especially this winter!

This was amazing!... I used 1/2 cup of coconut and 1 tsp coconut extract as some had suggested... I also added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips b/c I LOVE chocolate and coconut together...MMMM... I was actually able to make 12 muffins w/ the additions and the streusel topping was enough for the extra... I had no problems with the topping running off... wonderful recipe!

Too sweet, and a bit bland at the same time.  I added dried cherries, and they helped a little but not enough.  Maybe they just weren't to my taste though.

I modified the muffins recipe as other reviewers suggested and even then it wasn't modified enough to have a good coconut taste.
I added 1 1/ cup of soy milk and 3/4 cup of sweetened shredded coconut. The milk proportion in the batter was perfect this way but not the ratio of coconut. Next time, I will add either 1 1/4 cup or 1 1/2 cup of shredded coconut.

they baked great but I find them to be boring and plain even though I added chocolate chips and marachino cherries to some. I like the topping and will use it again.maybe adding another ingredient would make them more interesting

Made these this morning. Used more than double the coconut and a lot more milk.....not sure exactly how much but added per instructions and mixed but had to keep adding more until it was a batter consistency. Muffins were light and fluffy but the coconut taste was very faint even with the addition I put in.

subbed out coconut milk for the milk and coconut oil for the oil. my milk was cold and oil was thick so it took some mixing with a whisk on the damp ingredients to get the clumps out. increased flaked coconut to 1/3 cup by accident and added 1 T coconut powder to dry ingredients. added a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips at the last minute and skipped the topping since the reviews seemed  marginal. my husband loved these and he's a pretty ambivalent character in general. gotta go cause he's asking for some hot coffee to go with the muffins...

I did a recipe and a half, which made 18 nice sized muffins.  I added chocolate chips to 1/2 of the batter and fresh cut up strawberries to the other 1/2.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used coconut milk instead of milk, which added a nice light coconut flavor to the batter, and omitted the coconut extract.  These muffins taste great.  I had no problem with the topping as others have commented.  I added a picture to show how nice they came out.

This morning Imade this muffin and the smell of it in the oven was enough to make my stomach snarl, yes not a cute growl but a full blown harley davidson growl. It was satisfying but not number one in the book (you made 2nd though!), I think I baked it to long or was it that I only used brown suger but they came out looking a little oven light tanned (because I did not burn them!). I used half a cup of milk more+an extra egg and it turned a little cakey. But to my personal recipe I morphed it with a nother recipe with banana and chocolate chips and it turned out alright you can just see it in the picture.

I made these this morning.  The only thing I changed was applesauce instead of vegetable oil and no butter in the topping.  The taste was fine, though a little more coconut extract wouldn't hurt.  I was not impressed with the biscuit like muffin.  I like my muffins airy.  The topping was a great idea however, and I will use that if I ever find a recipe for lighter muffins.

This recipe was super easy and the muffins turned out great! I did make some substitutions- I used whole wheat flour for half the flour, applesauce instead of oil, Splenda instead of sugar, and eggbeaters instead of the egg. I also used 1/2 cup coconut for more flavor. The recipe made 12 good-sized muffins and they were perfectly done at 18 minutes. The muffins smelled amazing and tasted great too!

Really tasty!  I followed the advise of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup of coconut in the batter instead of 1/4 cup and they were perfect!

I didn't have coconut extract so I used almond and I think it would have been a lot nicer with coconut. Still yummy though, soft in the middle with a toasted outside- just how I like them! I will leave the extra sugar off the top next time as I don't think it needed it.
