Super easy... made to take to church. I line the pan with foil to lift the whole thing out to cut into bars... made it a little easier to get nice clean cuts

Very yummy. I made it with parchment paper lining and added about an extra half teaspoon of vanilla. Also, I recommend adding some salt (half teaspoon?) as it seems it could us it. I also had to bake it way longer than 30 minutes as it just wasnâ€™t getting baked all the way through. I baked it about 40-50 minutes. And let it rest in the baking dish at least 10 minutes before trying to remove it to a cooling rack otherwise it falls apart. Very delicious.

I lined with parchment paper and pressed the oatmeal base up the side of the pan about a half inch to contain the filling. Even using semi-sweet chocolate I found the chocolate filling a bit too sweet and a bit too soft. If I were to do it again I would probably try reducing the condensed milk by 1/4 C to see if that's more to my liking. My roommate thought it was perfect though!

OMG!  My husband said this was dope, it was so decadent and delicious.  Like one of the other reviewers, I used dark brown sugar and it was fine.  I also liked the suggestion to line the pan with foil.  I made it two weeks ago and hubs just asked me to make more.  This is not good for my calorie intake.  ;-D

Delicious! Taste similar to a chocolate novak. I used dark brown sugar and they turned out ooey-gooey in the center with a nice chewy base.
