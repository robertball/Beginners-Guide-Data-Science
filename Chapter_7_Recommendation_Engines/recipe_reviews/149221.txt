This made great cajun spice. I used this to make cajun-mayo for cajun spiced burgers and made some cajun shrimp. I only used half the salt. I used the crushed red pepper flakes and we didn't consider this too hot at all. This made enough for both dishes and there is plenty left for a couple more dishes. Thanks for sharing Diamondlil, this is better than the store bought blends and I can control the salt!

Super, Bobbie Jean.  Prezactly what I  wanted.  And thanks to reviewers who cautioned about salt.  I agree, this mix does not require that much salt.  I may play with this a bit to suit my taste,   but, I don't know that I can improve  it.  Just a great mix that can be used  as a rub, or used after cooking.  Try it.

this cajun spice is great!  i used 1 tsp of salt instead of 2.  i've made thisa few times now, its easy to mixup the ingredients with different spices i just keep the recipe amount of garlic powder, black pepper, onion powder, cayenne and red pepper flakes. it's great on potatoes, eggs, popcorn and tofu! i will always keep this spice mix of some variation on hand!

Great cajun seasoning! However, I too cut the salt in half, and used Italian seasoning instead of oregano (because I didn't have plain oregano). I used this for the Hudson's Baked Tilapia with Dill Sauce recipe from this site (I reviewed that, too).  I didn't add the red pepper flakes but I wish I had once I made it! It would have added the perfect amount of heat -- don't hesitate to use it if you like spicier cajun seasoning! I will be using this recipe a lot in the future! One of the best simple recipe I've found in a while. I'm going to end up using it on everything ;D

Yum! This recipe was easy to mix up using ingredients I already had on hand. This was my first time cooking with Cajun spice and I really liked it. I used it to make red beans and rice didn't think it was too salty, but I used all non-salt ingredients for the rest of the recipe. Next time I'd probably cut down on the salt per other reviews, because I don't think I'd miss it and it's healthier. I used the red pepper flakes and thought it was the perfect level of heat. I will definitely hang on to this recipe.

Very nice flavor!  I put some on chicken wings and baked them until they were sticky.  Really good stuff!  I liked the fact that the ingredients were things that you would normally keep on hand; nothing fancy.  Will use this spice mix alot from now on.  Thank you so much!!

I mixed this up today and sprinkled a good amount on Ore-Ida's tater tots, to go with the Ruby Drive Sloppy Joes we were having for dinner. Good stuff! I served it with my homemade ranch dip, it went well together.

A great mix of spices except like others, I'll be cutting the salt in half.  My boyfriend mixed it with plain breadcrumbs and coated chicken breasts in it and they were delicious except for the salt factor.  We didn't add the red pepper flakes but I think we might next time for a little extra kick.

Thanks for the recipe! I ran out of Cajun seasoning and didn't want to wait until I could buy it at the store, and this was excellent in the "Blackened Chicken Breasts with Creole Mustard Sauce" recipe on this site. I used less than half a teaspoon of salt, and I think next time I'll just skip it altogether since I do try to minimize my salt intake and I didn't think it was necessary in this mix. I think the heat level was great for me (I used about 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes) - a good solid kick of spice without setting your lips aflame.

Excellent! Like others, I did cut the amount of sal in half. I left out the optional red pepper flakes as I felt the heat from the cayenne would be enough for our tastes.  This was perfect for "Kickin' Chicken  Salad with BBQ Ranch Dressing" from this site. Thanks for a great recipe Bobbie Jean.

This is a welcome mix. My wife finds the commercial Cajun blends far too hot. This blend is the perfect level of heat for her and I like the flavor!

This is great! I needed Cajun Spice, but didn't have any. I was happy to see I had all ingredients but Thyme in my pantry. (What the heck happened to my thyme,? lol)  I did increase the cayenne pepper to about 1 3/4 teaspoon, but only because some spilled over. (That's what I get for measuring over the bowl... I know better!) regardless, it came out the "perfect spicy" for us, with a great kick, but not so much we couldn't taste the flavor.

So i'm finally going to rate this one... I think i've used it 30 times... I now make a sandwich bag full of it to keep on hand. I do cut the salt in half because my family and I have never been too big on salt. Anyways, this recipe its awesome for those nights when you forget to plan ahead! I use this rubbed on chicken or fish. But our favorite is cajun chicken on top of salad with blue cheese dressing! Sometimes I'll also rub it on the chicken then slather with some bbq sauce for extra spicy bbq chicken. Yum. Fyi, just go ahead and quadruple this recipe, it comes in handy!

I am only 13 and I am pretty proud of myself. I went with a more simple dish, I just mixed the seasoning with flour and fried chicken breasts. goes GREAT with sweet baby rays barbeque sauce! although I have to admit, it turned out pretty salty so for future references..USE 1 TEASPOON!

First and foremost, I recommend using less salt.  And instead of table salt, use sea salt.  This is a standard cajun seasoning mix, and it is normal to go heavy on the salt, but unless you only use a very small amount, I find that the salt becomes pretty dominating pretty quickly.

While this is a good and fairly standard cajun seasoning mix, I frequently experiment with my own mix.  I usually add some chili powder, or sometimes chipolte, habanro or even ghost pepper chili powder and also frequently add more cayenne and garlic and about 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.  Sometimes I skip thyme, rosemary and red pepper flakes.  Lately, in addition to thyme and oregano, I have been adding Rosemary as well which gives it a wonderful flavor! In the future, I will add Marjoram and/or Parsley but I don't currently have any to try right now.

Love having a spice mix recipe readily available for when a recipe calls for something I don't have! Used this for a last minute decision to make Cajun Chicken Pasta and it saved the day. We like the heat! Thanks for the great recipe! :)

perfect spice mix - not too hot and it is very versatile. I keep it handy for whenever I want a different spice flavoring with a slight kisk. Have used it on fish, chicken and beef, depending on where I want to go! Very good!

Excellent, used it in jambalaya and as a rub for grilled meats. We like it spicy so the red pepper flakes were a must for us. I double it and keep it in a small jar so I have it on hand.

Love it! I buy alot of my spices in bulk, so it is great to make "specialty" mixes on my own. This seasoning is great....I've never used a Cajun mix and it was great to try on a budget. My only complaint is I used it too fast! :) Thank you!

Great recipe, just cut back on the salt by half and substitute Hickory Smoked Salt instead. Thanks for sharing this one Bobbie Jean, and all the help from the other posters' suggestions.

The oregano overpowered the other flavors. I'd half the oregano and thyme next time. Was much to herb-y!

This is a great mix.  Like other reviews, I cut the salt in half.  It was enough.  I used smoked paprika which gave it the edge.  It is alway in arms reach of my grill.... Beef, Pork, Chicken or Fish... It does not matter.  Excellent with everything.  Thank you..

I call it very hot. I mixed it with lime juice and oil and marinated shrimp in it. It was a little too hot for me but great flavor. I'll just tone it down a little bit next time.

Excellent!  I had everything on hand.  I have to watch how much I use because my hubby doesn't like anything hot so I cut back just a little on the cayenne and omitted the red pepper flakes.   I used it in a pasta dish that called for cajun spice.  It was terrific!

Nice blend. I used some in another recipe and put the rest in my spice rack. I only used half the salt, and next time I may omit the salt altogether. Usually salt is already in/on what I'm making.  No need to double up. Thank you!

This is one of my favorite spice blends.  I can't believe I have reviewed it yet because I have been making this for well over 2 years.  I use it in cooking and to add a different flavor to popcorn, and I spice roasted chickpeas with it.  Thanks Bobbie Jean, this is a winner.

Fabulous! I used the optional red pepper flakes and add 1/2 t. tumeric; then keep it in a ziploc bag. I have already used it in two other recipes on this website and they were fantastic.

Wanting to make cajun potatoes on day my daughter realized we were out of the commercial jar of Cajun seasoning we had on hand. Not to be defeated by my lack of stock, I searched this sight for a spice mix. Lo and behold, this is the one for us. We had all the ingredients in the cupboard. I  give it five stars just because the recipe is so easy to put together. My daughter who is learning the joy of putting ingredients together to make something better than take away was very impressed with the ease and the taste  as well.  Thank you, Bobbie Jean.

DELICIOUS and so easy to mix up! I omitted the pepper flakes, b/c I didn't want it too spicy, and it was perfect for us. I will be using this again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Nice essence to pan fry fish in a mix of butter and EVOO (extra virgin olive oil).  Try marinating a nice piece of salmon for about an hour in the fridge and then throw it on the outdoor grill on a grilling pan or cedar plank for 20 to 25 minutes.

I just made this to use in a Jambalaya recipe and it worked great! I made it as written except I didn't add the red pepper flakes...the cayenne was enough spice for me! This was perfect...the Jambalaya had just the right amount of heat with this spice mix! Not too spicy!

I love this spice mix. My dad is on a diet so we pretty much eliminated the salt from it but it's still great. I used italian seasoning instead of just oregano and thyme and did add the red pepper flakes. We used it every day. I have to make more because I miss having it around.

Excellent spice mix! I needed cajun seasoning in a recipe and didn't have any, so I made this. I didn't love that dish, but did love this blend. It's great when mixed with mayo or sour cream and then used as a dip.

This is EXCELLENT. I used this in 'Cindy's Jambalaya' also from this site. The only thing I did different was I did not add the salt. I think it is PERFECT with out salt. I rarely use salt while cooking I wait and put it on the table... cuts down on the sodium and I personally like the flavors of the seasonings not a spoon/fork full of salt.

Excellent! Went a little light on the salt because the recipe I intended to use this mix in called for some salt. I would rather have not enough salt and add some than to have too much. Wonderful mix! It's a keeper. Thanks Bobbie Jean.

This is a great, easy-to-make mix, and I LOVE that it's ingredients most folks already have on hand!  I add it to flour/breading mixes for pan-fried fish or chicken, sprinkle it on french fries, and mix it with butter or mayo for awesome spreads.  Deeee-lish!

I made this last night to use in Maple Cajun Mahi Mahi and while I wasn't thrilled with how the fish came out, I was sold on this spice mix. I make all my own mixes and had everything needed for this. It has such bold flavors, we loved it. I did use a heavy hand with the cayenne and red pepper flakes, but we like heat. I'm planning to use it later this week in the egg wash for Crispy Fried Fish, also on this site. I can think of so many uses for this blend. It's a keeper, thanks!

This is a very good spice mix.  The only changes I made were to only add 1 tsp of salt and cut down the amount of cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp.  I used this in Jambalaya, but I think it would be yummy on grilled steaks.

Good mix. We doctored it only slightly (added more salt and didn't have cayenne so we used a Turkish seasonings blend) We added the red flakes since we both like a kick. Reminds me of crawfish, so I think that's a good thing.

Just the right amount of spice in this Cajun Spice Mix.  I originally made it to use on Butternut Squash Cajun Fries from this site, but have since used it on/in many items.  It is great on meats, sprinkled over potatoes and used in soups.  Most of these spices can be found in your cabinet which makes this very inexpensive to make and handy to have on hand.  Thanks Bobbie Jean for sharing your blend.

I doubled it to have some for later.  Used it on burgers, and they were awesome.  Marinading some ball tips for tomorrow with the seasoning just rubbed in.

Very good! A lot cheaper than buying a cajun seasoning too! I had everything but onion powder... so I omitted that. I also added a teaspoon on red pepper (what can I say.... we like it hot)... yum yum yum!

Perfect!  This is my go-to cajun seasoning.  I tried this recipe when I could not find a salt free version in the grocery store.  I make this recipe without salt, so that I can control the amount of salt in my cajun recipes!  It's great!

Great mix for Chicken Fajitas. I cut down the salt by half and sprinkled the mix into the chicken while cooking. Much better than any packet bought Fajita mix.

Made this exactly as printed.  Since I had everything in stock, I didn't have to make any changes.  When I make it again, I may substitute smoked paprika since I had to buy it for another recipe and haven't had much use for it since.

I make this recipe in bulk, as is, and keep it in my spice cabinet to make Blackened Tilapia and Blackened Ribeye.  I have friends who don't like fish who ask me to make my Tilapia when they come over for dinner.  Thanks!!!

This was really good. I used it to make cajun chicken pasta from this site (which is also really good by the way). Like others, I only used half the salt, but I will probably cut it down even more next time. I didn't use the red pepper flakes and found it had just the perfect amount of heat.

Lifesaver!  I was making a recipe from this site that required Cajun seasoning and I was out.  Rather than run to the store I used this recipe and it worked perfectly.  Like other reviewers I did cut the salt in half.  Thank you!!

Awesome! Didn't have the thyme and still awesome flavors. The family loved it so much they used it up within one day. Used this for the Cajun chicken pasta. Then made chicken fajitas with it and those were delicious. Only found this recipe a week and a half ago and already had to make a 4th container of this stuff.

Hmmm... I was under the impression adding Oregano made it a Creole seasoning. (check history of...) Very basic recipe, but a good start to find what you may like best. Personally, I suggest some granulated sugar  to aid in the browning effect and to balance the cayenne (HOT stuff) or chili powder you use... not to actually sweeten the mix. Remember 'flakes' may clog your shaker, if used.  Easy on the salt, especially if you brine meats.
 I am still testing & researching to find the authentic Cajun blend. Happy cooking!

It's a decent seasoning blend, I tried it out of sheer curiosity, but it doesn't have the punchI've found in Cajun blends. Working from the ingredient list above, loose the herbs, cut the paprika in half, add a teaspoon white pepper , add 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and increase the onion by half, NOW you're seasoning the Cajun way!!

Great Cajun spice! Followed many reviewers recommendations and used only 1 tsp. of salt.  I also did not have any thyme so I substituted it with basil and it was still great.  The addition of 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes added just the right amount of heat in addition to the cayenne pepper. I used it in a recipe found on this site - Linguine pasta with Shrimp and Tomatoes! Was excellent!

This "Cajun Spice Mix" is good. Even with the hot pepper flakes, I didn't find it especially spicy relative to the spicy food that my husband and I typically eat. Thank you Bobbie Jean for sharing your recipe

Pretty awesome considering I already had all the spices! I may pull back on the garlic a bit, and I substituted my homegrown dragon cayenne at 1/2 tsp instead of standard store-bought cayenne. I like more of a kick than most. I tossed it into my Mortar and ground it down to a finer powder, to get a more even flavor. Much appreciated!

Right tasty! I used it to season a bag roasted turkey, along with onions, celery, carrots and southern in bird stuffing. I believe my lady skinned the whole bird to get at all the flavor from this fine blend ( i added cumin and chili--tsp each).

I found a recipe for Cajun Chicken Skillet dinner on the internet and the recipe called for McCormick's Cajun spices. Not wanting to waste time and money driving to the store to buy a bottle I searched Allrecipes and found this recipe. It worked beautifully in the recipe. Nice and spicy but not blazing hot and I included the optional crushed red peppers. Like everyone else I cut the salt back to 1 tsp otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks so much for a great spice blend recipe. It saved both time and money today. I will always keep a bottle of this spice mix in my cabinet.

This one is a keeper! The only thing I changed was the salt content.....I used 1 tsp..... I found that adding olive oil and heating it up made a great sauce for shrimp and I saved leftovers in the fridge and used it for a baste for my BBQ steaks! Mmm mmm. Company said they were the best steaks they ever had

I've used this recipe twice. Once on country spare ribs and the second time on skirt steak. Wow! The meat was so juicy and succulent I couldn't stop eating. I'm saving this recipe. I used the red pepper in the mixture and even though it gives an extra little kick, it's not too much at all.

This blend is perfect!  I use this to make my own dirty rice, and have found in the past that certain recipes for cajun that I've tried have been too spicy for my family.  This one however is not at all, though I did cut the cayenne in half.  Loved the flavor and have saved this recipe to my files!  Thanks!

My son used this recipe to season some homemade french fries.  We all enjoyed it and would use it again.  Nice balance of flavor - would add more cayenne or use hot paprika for the next batch as we like things hot.  Very nice mix - made a large batch to keep on hand.

This is great and flavorful. Easy to assemble and gives the right amount of kick. I use Cajun spice rarely but I have the ingredients for it on-hand. I will never buy a jar of Cajun spice again.

I live where these kinds of spice mixes are unavailable so I was glad to find this recipe. I made it just like it says and my creamy cajun chicken was delicious. The heat of it was just right for me (I don't like very much heat in my food) including the red pepper flakes. Salt was fine for me.

this was beyond awesome. i didn't make any modifications which is rare for us. used almost the entire amount on a whole chicken that we grilled. the taste is amazing. we didn't feel it had too much salt but we tend to like salty, bold flavors. ty so much for the recipe. can't wait to try it on other foods.

A good basic spice mix that feels versatile. Definitely add the red pepper flakes! I didn't think it made it too hot at all and I think it needs that spicy kick.

Used approximately 1/2 teaspoon of salt and this stuff is great, Fairly spicy with cayenne and red pepper flakes, but that is the way I like it.

I made this on a whim. I'm not super Cajun-savvy. It was FANTASTIC! I added a bit of smoked hot paprika, and a bit of garlic powder. I used this mix with a bit of olive oil to sous vide some chicken breasts. My family gobbled it down in a flash! I will certainly make again! YUM!!!!

I have a whole jar that I made of this seasoning and I absolutely love it! I did add some store bought Tony's Creole seasoning and I also add more garlic powder as well simply because everyone I cook for loves garlic. I've always gotten compliments on the Cajun pasta I make with my seasoning too!

I omit the salt entirely. I'm trying to reduce salt in my diet and had to stop buying Cajun seasoning because it's so full of salt! With homemade, I can control my sodium and still enjoy the flavor! I use this in Red Beans and Rice, jambalaya, on popcorn and corn on the cob!

The only charges I made were less salt, 1 tsp. And I added garlic powder.  I will never buy the prepackaged again.  Easy and wonderful.

It was basic, so I added celery seed and dried minced onions to copy part of the holy trinity. I like to emphasize the flavors of what I am going to be making in the dry mix. IE, I include dried mustard in my bbq rub because I add mustard to my liquid bbq sauce. And I never add salt to my rubs. I have high blood pressure and carefully regulate my salt. Also, it is so flavorful that you only need a small amount to balance the flavors on your tongue.

I used the spice mix to flavour croutons. Added olive oil to the spice mix and tossed the bread in the infused oil. The croutons were very moorish. I will definitely use this mix for a lot of other recipes.

I cut the salt in half but kept the rest exactly the same and it was great on a pork tenderloin. The heat from the cayenne pepper was perfect and no other ingredient overpowered the mix. Awesome!

The seasoning was absolutely amazing! I covered my chicken in it and even mixed it into an alfredo sauce I made for dinner. However, I did add a little bit too much Cayenne because I was careless and moving too quickly so I might cut that back a little bit next time. We both like really spicy food, and it was a gradual build-up of heat but as we can ate dinner it got hotter and hotter, which is fine, but we weren't expecting it. But I will definitely be making this again!

Simple and delicious!  I halved the salt because I like to use the spice mix in a jambalaya recipe that already has some salty sausage in it.  As a rub alone, the full amount of salt would be fine.  Great recipe!

I make this in big batches, jar it, and use it on everything. Cajun chicken pasta? Bomb. Cajun catfish? To die for. Sprinkled on top of cottage cheese? My favorite! It's so flavorful and made with stuff you probably have in your pantry already. Highly recommend!!!

I'm glad that I cane across this recipe when I ran out of Cajun seasoning. I did follow the good advice of reviewers and added only 1 tsp of salt. I used this on a blackened tuna steak, and it was great. I will use this is many other dishes, as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it just the way it called for with two exceptions;
1) I used crushed garlic cloves, and
2) I used finely diced red onions.

This recipe makes a good amount of cajun seasoning. It's not too spicy which is nice. I love making some and keeping it in the pantry to throw on chicken for a fast meal.

Nice blend. I replaced the salt with No Salt and used the blend to season lean ground turkey in place of Andouille sausage in Jambalaya.  Really worked out well.

Made a mason jar full of it! Added a bit of super finely ground espresso beans just because I love that flavor in foods with heat, gives it some extra depth mmm making some jambalaya with it tonight.

This was good but not quite as hot or spicy as I prefer so the 2nd time I increased the cayenne and added cumin. That made it just right for me.

I cut the cayenne pepper a bit as well as the red pepper flakes and it was still a little spicy for us.  Something seems to be missing for our tastes - perhaps a bit of chili powder (like in the brand of Cajun seasoning blend we purchase).  We are very sensitive to salt and I cut that to about a half of a teaspoon.  We'll see how this tastes on shrimp in a few days.  Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe.

AMAZING.  I was making shrimp & sausage with summer vegetables in foil packets.  The recipe called for Cajun spice mix.  I did not want to buy pre made, and I tried this one.  Simply fabulous.  We all loved it.  I'll use it again very soon on salmon.

The recipe I was making called for Cajun seasoning which I did it have and found this recipe. Excellent!! Just the right amount of heat but one can always add more cayenne to make it spicier. I made this with out using the red pepper flakes because children were eating the dish.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Great Cajun spice. I omitted the salt for the health preferences of my husband. I add Himalayan pink salt to my personal dish when using this recipe.

Have used in my gumbo for years & keep on hand as a rub. Store bought varieties tend to add sugars or additives unnecessarily. We cut the salt for heart health and love that we can dial up or down the heat with the pepper flakes depending on what we're making and who we're making it for. Thanks for years of flavour!

This is a great spice blend. I didn't have any garlic powder so I just pulsed some dried minced garlic in my grinder with some dried oregano and thyme from our garden. I used it to season Cajun-style beans and rice with chicken sausage and it was perfect! Some have stated that they found it too spicy, and depending how you use it it could be, but in a dish that absorbs a lot of flavor I think you could actually turn up the heat a bit more....If you like spicy food, which I do :)

The spice mix came out good and seemed to be consistent with other recipes for cajun spice. I omitted the red pepper flakes, but next time will include it. Scaled recipe down to 3 since I only needed about 1 tbsp. Left the salt measurement as is because the other recipe I was making did not call for salt. Easily modifiable if you feel it needs more heat, garlic, onion, etc. Used this to make Maple Cajun Mahi Mahi. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I had a recipe that called for Cajon seasoning and I didn't have any.  I made this up reducing the salt by half as one person already said and it was perfect.   
This would be nice to have in a small jar as  staple in the kitchen.

I thought it was great as written and did not add the pepper flakes. I was making another recipe that called for cajun seasoning and I thought I had some but I didn't. I mixed this up and surely the other recipe was better for it! Just enough heat for us but not too much. I'll make it again instead of buying it for sure!

I used this on shrimp (and I'm not a huge fan of shrimp but the bf loves them so....) I followed this recipe to the tee and it was AMAZING. Just enough spice, not too salty... I thought I lost this recipe and scoured the internet to find this exact one again so I can make it tonight. Thanks for sharing.

This is a good Cajun spice - not too hot but it's got a bit of a kick to it to make things interesting. My husband doesn't like things too hot and he didn't complain about the heat and said it had nice flavor. I will definitely save this recipe and use it again.

My Mom and I are on a very low sodium diet, so I make this with zero salt. It is excellent. When I use it on pulled pork as a part of the dry rub it's great, when I use it with seafood it's also great. Nice bend of flavors that suits my family very well.

I doubled everything except the salt, 2.5x red pepper, & left out the onion as I was sautéing onion into my recipe- was awesome... I tossed my meat in it prior and seared with it and mixed the remainder with a small container of fage Greek yogurt... protein pasta + seared beef, turkey sausage, & shrimp with bell pepper and onion- mixed with the yogurt sauce made one awesome creamy pasta with a kick!!

Good recipe, but it looks a LOT like Emeril Lagasse's  essence blend, with the exception of the optional red pepper flake.
I've made this with both table and kosher salt. The larger grains of the kosher salt seem to make it less salty than table salt, when using measured amounts. Otherwise I "salt to taste".
Frequently I have found that some recipes omit the kosher label and using table salt as prescribed becomes too much.
This blend is suitable for my kids without red pepper. The cayenne doesn't seem to bother them. It amazes guests when they're passing the Frank's Red Hot Sauce to each other. They just don't like red pepper flakes. Go figure.

Not bad for a starter. Needed more heat for my liking. Even used 50/50 hot smoked and sweet smoked paprika. Also followed others advice and cut salt in half. Will double the cayenne and add some white pepper next time.

Made it exactly as stated except halved the Cayenne Pepper as we didn't want that much heat. We then used this spice on the Salted and Blackened Tilapia Receipe (found on this site) and it was perfect. Will definitely be making use of this blend again.

I'm allergic to garlic, so I have make just about all spice mixes, dressings, marinades, etc. myself. I just added a little more onion powder. It was just what I was looking for! Very excellent! I've made shrimp jambalaya with it and it was fab. Instead of rice I've been using cauliflower rice. Good and healthy, too.

Saved me money as I had all the spices already in the cupboard. Found it a bit peppery but will add more herbs to counteract. I guess you have to play about a bit until you find the mix but this was great for basic ratios. Thank you =)

I made this exactly as written, including the red pepper flakes, and it added great flavor to my red beans and rice, though it could have had a little more heat (but that's easy to fix).  I'm not sure what type of paprika the author used, but I used smoked paprika in mine and we liked that flavor.

I took off one star because I felt like the biggest flavor was salt.  To me, cajun spice should be all the flavors and not nearly as much salt.

I'm really glad I read the reviews before making this! If I hadn't used half the salt as a few people recommended, it would have been WAY too salty. I switched out the dried thyme for ground and used only 1 tsp. I also switched out the crushed red pepper for dried red pepper and used 3/4 tsp because I was looking for a lot of heat in this spice blend. It is PERFECT!

A very good and versatile mix. Made this as described, minus the pepper flakes, and stored it in an empty spice container for easy dispensing. Just used it tonight in a jambalaya recipe and it added a nice depth.

I was making fish tacos tonight, and the recipe called for cajun seasoning.  But I forgot to pick any up.  So I mixed this up and put it on the fish.  Fantastic!  I left out the red pepper flakes, because my husband doesn't like anything too hot, but it still had a nice kick to it.  It was perfect on the fish.

This mixture worked well for a popular Jambalaya recipe on this site. I only wanted enough for the recipe and so I adjusted the amount to serve 3. This was almost the right amount.

Love this spice mix.  I rub it on fish and my husband loves it.  It is hot, so take that into account while adding it to meat or fish.

A little too salty.  I added an additional tsp. of Paprika, Chili powder, Basil, Coriander, 2 tsp. Oregano, 2 tsp. Thyme.  It's VERY SPICEY. Use a light touch at first to determine how much you prefer to use.

We like it extra spicy, so I always add 3 or 4 extra tsp of chilli flakes. Otherwise a perfect blend of spices.

This was really good! I used it on a boston butt roast. I cut the roast into chunks and seasoned all pieces generously. Then I brown them in butter in a frying pan, and then into the crockpot for pulled pork sandwiches. Delicious!!!

Made this on New Years Day and have made it several times since. We love it!  Not sure when the water chestnuts were suppose to be added - but I added them when adding the peas. Also, instead of the ham hock, I used diced ham. Good stuff!

I love this recipe.  I use it to dry rub everything!  We cut down the cayenne pepper to 1/8 tsp for the kids. (Can always add more!)  I like to can pork when it's on sale.  I'll cube it and use this dry rub and some liquid smoke and bake in a covered pan.  Then I pressure can it.  It comes out just like pulled pork!  You can do the same thing with this recipe by putting this dry rub on cubed pork with a little liquid smoke in a slow cooker all day.  Awesome faux pulled pork!

Perfect substitute! I just made a recipe of Cajun Sausage Pasta tonight which called for Cajun Seasoning (which I don't have) and I used this recipe and the dish was delicious!!! I didn't add the red pepper flakes because my kids probably wouldn't eat it and I did slightly less cayenne for the same reason and it had JUST enough bite for us. Thank you!

Very good and easy. I left out the onion powder because I'm out, and substituted ground chipotle pepper for cayenne. Added an extra "smokey" taste I was looking for. I'll make it again, and add the onion powder next time!

LOVE this recipe exactly as written. I just whipped this up for the Tex-Mex Burger with Cajun Mayo on allrecipes. I was in a hurry and forgot to read the other reviews so was worried mixture was going to be oversalty. It is perfect! But as others mentioned, this is great to be able to control how much salt you want. Every ingredient is a perfect compliment to the others. Thanks for sharing!

Used it several times and it is perfect as is! I have to make my own spice mixes because the ones available at the grocery store almost always have MSG and other seasonings that cause allergic reactions. No such problems with this mixture!

I love to have my own homemade Cajun seasoning so I can leave out the salt.
This one comes out perfect!

If you're really concerned about salt content, I recommend starting with Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy, and adding black pepper and additional paprika.  Play with it!

I only used half the amount of oregano that is called for and subbed cumin for the other half.  I made a batch of this and another cajun seasoning recipe from this site at the same time and although this was good, we preferred the other one.

Thank you!  I used a half portion of these on the Cabbage Jambalaya recipe from this site and it made it delicious (it would have been very bland without).  I look forward to trying this on different items - hashbrowns do sound yummy.

This is a great recipe - it is tasty and easy to prepare with commonly found ingredients.  I rubbed the tuna steaks with xvoo and then rubbed on this spice mix.  I grilled them for about 5 min on each side and they were delicious.

This is great!!  I am kind of a whimp for spicy food so I used just 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne and skipped the red pepper flakes.  Also, used only 1 teaspoon of salt.  I used this in another recipe that called for cajun spice, and it was perfect. This will be my go-to recipe for whenever I need an all purpose cajun spice mix.

I found this spice mix to be perfect for my tastes, only cutting back the salt to 1 tsp.  Granted, this is not very hot/spicy, which is why I like it.  I will continue to use this recipe.

This is the one! I will not buy Cajun spice in a bottle anymore. I cut the salt in half and did not use the red pepper flakes. Next time will try half black pepper and half white pepper.

Perfect blend of seasoning.  I only used 1/2 the salt but everything else tasted great.  I use it to pan sear some Tilapia and topped with Ponchartrain Sauce.  Great with anything Cajun!

I just made this to use in a jalapeño burger recipe. It came out great. I could use this every day.
