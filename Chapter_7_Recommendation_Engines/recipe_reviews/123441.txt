This dish is not gourmet, but it is surprisingly tasty, quick, and economical, as promised. I halved the recipe and got two dinners and a lunch, equally yummy each time. Like another reviewer, I used onion soup instead of bouillon, which still worked out well. The whole peeled tomatoes could probably use a little mashing before putting them in the pot, because they don't really get a chance (when whole) to cook enough in the 15 minutes or so they simmer. I might try canned stewed tomatoes instead, next time.

Something with vegetables that my husband asks for!  I use whole wheat pasta, double the bullion and add pepper.

This was just okay. It really needed a lot of doctoring so it wasn't bland. We added dried parsley, butter, worcestshire sauce, and salt. I liked the concept but it fell short.

This is an awesome, tasty, quick meal!  I did change a couple things, tho... Instead of the garbanzo beans I used beans in tomato sauce & added 1-14oz can of carrots sliced small. Even our toddler ate it! :)

I didn't have the bouillon, so I added one packet of onion soup mix instead. My toddler loved this and she's pretty picky. This recipe makes a lot and really is even better the next day. Loved it!

This is simmering on the stove as I write, and I am so excited for dinner!  We are trying to cook as frugal as possible, and beans are a great frugal food (but I've had a hard time finding main course dishes that aren't chilis or beans and rice...).  I used dried beans (even more frugal than canned) and soaked them overnight, then simmered them all afternoon.   I used a mix of black beans, kidney beans, and pinto beans.  I drained them off and proceeded with the recipe as written, though instead of adding the pasta when it says to, I put the beans back in and am letting it all simmer without any pasta.  Frankly, it might not even need the pasta!  I had a 28oz can of whole tomatoes (unseasoned) so I mashed them with a potato masher, and added salt, pepper, and was quite liberal with the Italian Seasoning.  I also used three cups of water and three bouillon cubes.  I look forward to making this again, and canning it to put back in the pantry!

I really love this dish.  I make it without the kidney beans and then sprinkle garlic powder and onion salt over the top.  YUMMY!!!! My kids like it because they can pick out what they don't like (one likes green beans the other likes the garbonzo beans).  I like it because it's very easy.  Usually serve with a bowl of fruit and garlic bread.

This recipe was very good and very easy to make.  I skipped the green beans because my skillet was too small to add anymore.

I used ground turkey. I don't keep noodles on hand other than angel hair but I just happened to have a box of Near East Roasted Garlic & Olive Oil pasta (which uses Vemicelli but I broke them into smaller pieces) -- and added the garlic packet that came with it so it won't be quite like the original recipe but boy it smells & tastes delicious!
