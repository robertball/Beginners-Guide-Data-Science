Excellent and easy. I think salt was left out of the list of ingredients - I used about 1 tsp.

I couldn't find the frozen scalloped potatoes either, so I substituted a 30-oz. package of shredded hash browns and everyone at work loved it!  I also added some garlic powder and I sprinkled the top with Italian seasoning for extra color and flavor.

This is the best breakfast cassorole receipe I have found.  My family and friends always request I make this delicious cassorole. 
I could not find the frozen potatoes but the box mix worked perfectly.

Since most people's reviews stated that they couldn't find the potatoes - I went on to the Stouffer's website and this recipe is there.  What it actually calls for is 1 pkg. (11 oz.) Potatoes Au Gratin, defrosted.  I am not sure who put this recipe up here, but is seems it either changed or they made a mistake.  Hopefully that will help everyone.  I haven't made this yet, but it sounds really good.

I also used a bag of hash browns as suggested (b/c I couldn't find the potatoes that were called for).  Worked out fine.  I wanted to make this creamier and add some spice so I did the following: 8 eggs, some milk, cubed Velveeta, 1 Tbsp. crushed red pepper,chopped jalapenos and chopped red pepper.  Serve with hot sauce - YUM!

My family loved this recipe.  Needed something quick and easy when company was over and this was a hit.  Couldn't find the frozen AuGratin potatoes so used boxed instead.  You don't even have to cook them first.  Just add them to the sausage, egg, and cheese mixture.  Will be making again this weekend!!

I have made this several times and it has been a hit every time.  I too used hashbrowns as was suggested by others.  I also added 2 extra eggs the second time I made it and lowered the temp to 350 and cooked it covered.  splitting the biscuits so they are not doughy helped also.  It freezes great too.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  I brought it into work and there were no leftovers!  I could not find the Stouffers frozen potatoes in the store, so I made them from a mix.  Thanks again!

This was excellent!  I couldn't find *any* Stouffer's frozen potatoes at my grocery store, so I used two bags (approx 11oz total) of Betty Crockers Potatoes Au Gratin.  It was delicious.  My only recommendation is to cover it with foil (during the 2nd phase -- when cooking with the biscuits) until the last few minutes because my biscuit tops started browning but the insides were not done yet!  Anyway, it was yummy.

After reading some of the other reviews I decided to tweak the recipe a little as well. I used 2 boxes of cheddar and bacon scalloped potatos; 1 large cooked onion; 1lb. cheddar cheese; 1 1/4lb. sausage and 12 eggs. Let me tell you... it was FABULOUS! I will be making this for all of my brunches from now on!

I couldn't find the Stouffers' potatoes, so I used frozen hash browns instead. Casserole was a little dry because of this. I may use the recipe again, but I will need to modify it somewhat.

This recipe definately has potential.  I read through this recipe and a few others before making it and this one sounded the best.  I didn't want to use scalloped potatoes, so I used ORE IDA FROZEN POTATOES(They were pre cut into diced squares) only cost $2.00 for a 32 oz bag.  They just sat on the counter to thaw a little for about an hour, then they were ready to use.  The reason I only give this recipe 3 stars is I really thought it would taste better than it did.  It was very DRY and definately needed MORE CHEESE.  But instead of adding more cheese, I decided the next morning(we had it for dinner) to make up a batch of simple country gravy and added to what was left and let me tell you, it was EXCELLENT!!!!  I will keep this recipe and remember I need to add the gravy!!!

Was very good. I just got two boxes of Scallop potatoes
(11oz) and made those up first to add to the recipe.
Also I made it the night before up to were you put the biscuits on top. In the morning when you cook it I would cook it alitte first without the biscuits first otherwise the biscuits are done but the middle is still a little cold.

This is a great recipe!  The Stouffer people won't like hearing this, but I couldn't find their brand of frozen scalloped potatoes, so I had to use the Safeway brand (which worked just fine).  I also added a couple of more eggs and a little more cheese too.  I brought this dish to work and people ate it up and begged for more.  I had so many people asking for the recipe.  TRY THIS - YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!

Good, hearty & filling!  I left the sausage out, added 2 eggs & used 30 oz. of frozen hashbrown mix instead of the frozen potatoes listed.  VERY good!!

Wonderful!  I made this for Mother's Day and got rave reviews.
Some changes:  I used 7 eggs rather than 5; 2 packages of scalloped potates (not frozen); assembled everything except the biscuits on Saturday and baked it for 20 minutes, then refrigerated it overnight.  In the morning all I had to do was top it with the biscuits and cheese (I used Bisquick, rolled out to form a top crust) and bake for 25 minutes at 350.  I served it with cream gravy, heavy on the pepper.  It was GREAT!

I love this recipe. It is a real crowd pleaser. I often use it with the following alterations for brunches: I use bacon instead of sausage, I omit onion powder, and I use Ore Ida Frozen Potatoes Hash Browns Southern Style instead of STOUFFER'S® Family Style Favorites Scalloped Potatoes

Great Christmas morning breakfast. I assembled it the night before with Betty Crocker AuGratin Potatoes from a box (cooked in the microwave) and frozen biscuits. I kept it in the fridge overnight and popped it in in the morning.  It was quite tasty with hot sausage.  Easy! Easy! Easy!  Which is especially good because I am a sleepyhead in the morning.

I made this for brunch & it was okay.  It was a bit bland, there were not enough eggs, & the baking time before you add the biscuits is too long.  It needs some adjustments before it will be a good recipe.  Next time I may add some green chiles & more eggs.  I added ketchup to my serving & my husband & brother-in-law added hot sauce to theirs.  This recipe is just "okay".

This recipe is excellent. I add a little chopped green pepper in when cooking the sausage for extra flavor and I just use regular hashbrown potatoes.

I know lots of people couldn't find the right potatoes and used substitutions. . . I also couldn't find those exact kind, but Stouffer's makes a smaller box of "Cheesy Potato Bake" or something similar.  It is a PERFECT substitution because it is a lot more moist than most of the other potato substitutes. . .more cheese, and has some bacon in it too for flavor.  I did have to buy about 5 boxes to get the 40 oz. worth, though. . . but it definately works out very well in the end.  . .

I tried to make a lower fat version of this casserole and I wouldn't recommend it.  It was ok - I'm sure it's fantastic following the recipe exactly.

I used Ore Ida Potatoes O'Brien with peppers and onion instead of the Stouffers potatoes which I too could not find!  This was the first time I made it and I think it was a little too dry.  Next time I am going to try to add a package of country gravy to the potato, sausage, egg mixture.  If you use the potatoes o'brien, be sure to fry them for about 5-8 minutes before you use them.

This recipe is a little bland and needed more eggs.  Recipe should call for salt to help flavor it and used an chopped onion instead of the powder.  Not sure if will make again.

Yummy! 
I too, could not find these frozen potatoes. I used Idahoan scalloped potatoes, from a pouch and made them instead. I also used sage breakfast sausage. 
Everything was delicious!!! :)

I always cook the sausage and potatoes the night before so it takes less prep time.  I also serve it with Bob Evens sausage gravy on the side.  I like to have it when we have overnight guest and it's always a big hit.

I made this with boxed scalloped potatoes and used 8 eggs.  Next time I will use more.  The cooking time was exactly what it took, even with the extra eggs.  It went over very well at the potluck. Katie

I wasn't able to find any 40oz box of Stoufers.  Please change the recipe to show a substitute.  I haven't made it yet but plan to use, as another read did, 2 5-serving boxes of dry scalloped potatoes.

This was FANTASTIC! I made it up on Christmas Eve and then baked it Christmas morning for 25 minutes, then added the biscuits and cheese and finished baking it for 14 min. The entire family loved it and my husband requested that I make this every year! CHANGES: I used one box of scalloped potatoes that I prepared in the microwave. I used beef Polska Kielbasa cut into small cubes and I added one small sauteed onion. It came out PERFECT! Also added about 2 1/2 cups of cheese instead of 2 cups. Very delicious!

Absolutely wonderful-- wish I had read the reviews first-- two grocery stores later could not find the potatoes either!!  Used 2 boxes that I pre-cooked and that worked fine. No leftovers on this one on Christmas morning-- really does serve 10 hungry people.  Ketchup is also a nice touch for those who like it with breakfast foods.  Would consider the additional eggs that others have suggested next time, but is fine as is.
