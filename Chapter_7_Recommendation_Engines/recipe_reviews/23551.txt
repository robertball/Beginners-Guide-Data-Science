Loved this, followed the recipe exactly.  A great summer drink and will make this again.  I'm on a roll with freezing fruit juice in ice trays, so next time I'm using my cranberry and/or orange juice cubes for another variety.  Thanks Andrea!

This drink is not just for summer!  I wanted to give it more of an autumn feel.  Made with a nice Lodi Zinfadel, which is a little darker than a standard white zin, and added fresh mandarine orange slices.  Tasty!
