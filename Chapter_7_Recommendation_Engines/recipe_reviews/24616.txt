Roasting the tomatillos results in a much thicker salsa with the added flavor from roasting.

This is a great fresh salsa. Those who want to mellow the pepper taste could blanch the peppers with the tomatillos. I would recommend letting it sit for several hours at room temperature before eating. Also, it freezes quite well. YUM!

I tried this poured over chicken with melted monteray jack and yellow rice on the side and it was yummy.  This salsa has some kick!

This makes wonderful salsa.  I had never cooked with tomatillos before, but wanted a fresh green salsa to go with enchiladas I was making (Chicken Enchiladas II from this site).  I used 2 jalapeños, seeded and ribs removed as we don’t like food very hot.  I used less water, just enough to cover the tomatillos in the pan, and 2 garlic cloves.  I have never tasted better green salsa.  And, a tip I learned for selecting tomatillos, choose the smaller ones as they can get bitter if they get too big.

I've always included fresh Mexican oregano and cumin when I make tomatillo salsa and was interested in the comparison without.  While I did like this, I found it just a little dull for my tastes, so now I know I do prefer tomatillo salsa enhanced with the additions of cumin and oregano.

This was a good start but needs more jalapenos. Mine did not even have a little heat using just the two peppers.  I will use 4 seeded fresh ones next time.  I layered grilled chicken, flour tortillas, monterrey jack cheese and this sauce and baked covered for 30 minutes.

Oh yum! I added 1/4 C. more cilantro and 1/4 fresh parsley. I also added one large red bell pepper (chopped) to tone down some of the fieriness of the salsa for my non-spice lovers. It makes a combo of a little sweet with a spicy bite :)

This was so good, and incredibly easy!  We had it on both tacos and chili rellanos.  The tomatillos give it a wonderful fresh citrus taste taste.  Much lighter and fresher tasting than the commercial tomato-based salsas.  Low cal / low fat, too!  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome sauce! I decided to make chilaquiles with this recipe. I made some changes though. SAUCE: I used 3 large serrano peppers for spice and 7 dried chiles de arbol (no stems) instead of the jalapenos. I boiled the tomatillos, chiles and garlic cloves until the tomatillos changed color. I dont like to leave them too long because it gives the sauce a bitter taste. So I dont let them burst. After boiling everything for a few minutes, I put the following into the food processor: Tomatillos, chiles, garlic cloves,  a handful of cilantro leaves (no stems), 1/4 onion and a tsp of knorr bouillon (moms secret ingredient). CHILAQUILES: After the sauce is done I put a tbsp of oil in a pan and throw the sauce in. After the sauce begins to simmer a bit I turn the heat down and add tortilla chips. Restaurant style chips w/salt are great for this recipe. I dont mix anything at that point. I just make sure the sauce covers the chips untill the chips begin to soften. The trick is to not the the chips get too mushy but not too hard. After that simmers a little you can add rotisserie chicken on top and serve with cheese and sour cream. I personally like a fried egg on top. You can also do this with any leftover sauce. Enjoy!

I used roasted jalapeno peppers, which I find tones down the heat.  I had leftover tomatillos from my CSA delivery in the summer, so I froze some and didn't need to boil them since they were soft after they thawed.  This is great for dipping and I also used it in Andy's Spicy Green Chile Pork on this site as well.

YUM, nice & spicy, well at least with the pepper that I used (I didn't de-seed it).  Yum, I used this in "Amy's cilantro cream sauce" (from this site) and it was great in that as well.  Thank you Sandy!

My wife loves "Salsa Verde" as we call in in the Southwest, so, I made this recently in part because I thought she'd like it, and I was curious about tomatillos.  My wife LOVED it, and said it was the best she ever had!  For me personally, I would add some more peppers to it, maybe more jalapenos and a serrano or two.  Even though mild for my tastes, I did enjoy it and would recommend to others.  This really is easy to make!

Thanks, Sandy, this is a great basic recipe. My husband and teenage kids love it. It is excellent with enchiladas, and I can't wait to try it with fish as another reviewer mentioned. It would also be great with pork loin or chops. I even want to try it on burgers. We love enchiladas verdes made with this salsa and it also is great with tortilla chips as a dip. I had bushels of tomatillos from my garden, and I sure used up a lot of them making this salsa for my family to eat with their chips. I do tweak it a little now, I add only one jalapeno (my kids don't want it too spicy) and I also add 1/4 teaspoon of ground coriander (cilantro seeds) and the juice of one lime. Once when I didn't have enough cilantro I added fresh parsley from the garden, which worked out very well, but I still like all cilantro better. I use the smallest onion I have, because the raw onion flavor can overpower it sometimes. Instead of yellow onion, next time I will use a sweet vidalia onion and see if that makes a difference. Also the jalapenos should be green. I used ripe red jalapenos from the garden once, and not only are they hotter but they don't have that fresh green 'grassy' flavor, which adds a lot to the salsa. Looking forward to trying it with nachos, too! Muy bueno y delicioso!

Thank you, Sandy!  Added alot more garlic and jalapenos and used it to make enchiladas.  My family raved over dinner.  The only downfall was that I didn't make enough to eat the next day  with chips! Thanks again for sharing!!!

This is so good, and better than anything you can buy in a jar. I followed the recipe to a tee other than adding a 1/2 tsp. cumin. We used it as a dip with tortilla chips. 5 stars and highly recommended!

This sauce is wonderful and unbelievably EASY!  I made a couple of adjustments, but the recipe still deserves 5 stars.  I added extra cilantro because I love the taste.  I also didn't have jalapeno peppers on hand, so I used 2 Tbsp of canned chopped mild green chiles.  I ate this sauce with my tortilla chips, and I used it in the Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada recipe by Brenda on this site.  It tasted exactly like my favorite enchiladas!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I gave this three stars, because I'm not sure if maybe I just don't like tomatillos.  But I didn't like the recipe at all as a dip for chips.  A bit on the sour side, and not a lot of flavor.  Maybe adding more garlic, onion, and cilantro would help.

This recipe was pretty much what I was looking for but was surprised that it didn't have lime juice...so I added some. It was delish and definitely think the lime juice is a must.

This was surprisingly delicious! (I say "surprisingly" because I had never used tomatillos in cooking before.) I had no jalapeños on hand, so I substituted with crushed red pepper and some chili powder. I also added a little sugar to balance out the tartness of the tomatillos. Overall, I really enjoyed it!

This recipe is great. But it is not 5 stars because I had to adjust it a little. I doubled the amount of jalapenos and garlic to 4 each. I took out all the seeds and veins from the peppers. I added a few splashes of fresh lime juice (about the juice of 1/4 lime). I added more cilantro. (We love it at my house.) Lastly, I left mine a little bit chunkier then in the pictures because we ate it with chips. It was really, really good! It tasted great right away and even better after it sat out for about a half hour.

Great recipe.  Here's my additions and observations:
Two things that always jazz up my salsa recipes and work well for this one too... add 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon sugar - depending on taste, and a squirt or two of lime juice.
Without this recipe I would not have ever thought about cooking the tomatillos first, I have always used them raw.  This gives a distinctly different flavor - better I think - but if in a hurry, chopped raw works well, too.
I am a cilantro addict!  1/4 cup would NEVER be enough for me.
Also, I like things hot, so I would PERSONALLY add more jalapenos, but most of the people I serve at home are not in my category.  Be careful in serving things to spicy to those who cannot handle them well.

So absolutely sad that I didn't have this wonderful recipe for the past 30 years. Now I am old with hardly anyone to appreciate it but myself. LOL. I used fresh ingredients except for the cilantro leaves (ground some coriander seed with the old trusty mortar and pestle), and used between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp. I shook in a touch of garlic powder since I had only used three garlic cloves and that wasn't quite enough. I may add a little lime juice after it refrigerates for a few hours. BEST green salsa I've ever had; will definitely make it a staple.  Thanks much.

Excellent, and extremely easy. To those saying it's too hot, make sure to clean the seeds out of the jalapeno before using it--if you do that, they should have very little heat at all.

This salsa was easy to make and delicious!  However, the recipe calls for 2 jalapeno peppers.  I used ONE and it was TOO HOT!  I am pretty weak when it comes to hot food, but even my husband who likes hot food said it was a little too hot for him.  In the future, I will use half a jalapeno or none at all.

I loved this. I hand cut/minced the onions. Next time I will use a food processor, I think they need to be a little more refined. I always wondered what tomatillos were used for. Thanks for the great recipe and instructions!!
P.S. I had left over roast. I cut it up and cooked it with the salsa and made a great burrito. Yum! Yum! Next time, I will try making this 1st, with more jalepenos and pouring over a roast in the crock pot.

Very easy to make. I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out great! This is not a particularly spicy recipe but it is very good. We make this a lot during the summer and never seem to tire of it.

I made this pretty much as the recipe instructed.  I tweaked it a little adding more jalapenos and garlic for some added flavor and heat.  Delicious and easy!!

Wow!! This was awesome in flavor, texture and sight.  I added a medium sized white onion instead of small and added a serrano chili to one jalapeno chili.

Since this was my first time to grow them, I had no idea what to do with my beautiful tomatillo's until I tried this recipe!  It is very easy and tastes wonderful, just the heat that I love, with the lemony flavor of the little green fruit remaining.

Pretty good for my first time making green salsa! If you are short on time like I was and want to cool it off quickly, try putting the finished salsa in the freezer for about a half hour. I used the salsa as a topping for tacos but am planning to use the leftovers to make enchiladas. I am curious to compare to a recipe where the ingredients are roasted so I will probably try that next and see which one stays in my recipe box.

I love green salsa.  My hispanic neighbors came over a few times to help me get everything right.  One thing they mentioned: add one avocado.  WOW!  It went from a 3.5 to a 5 star after I added the avocado.  So delicious!

Great recipe! I work in the restaurant industry and my chef let me take home a bunch of tomatillos, so I thought I try my hand at salsa. I wasn't sure about this recipe but decided to give it a try, I'm glad I did. I can't wait to try this over some shredded chicken enchiladas...

Absolutely wonderful receipe; but for "Baja style" (our favorite) add the juice of 1/2 of a fresh lime when using 6 tomatillos and the juice of a whole fresh lime if using 10 tomatillos.

The best tomatillo salsa I've ever had.  We got fresh ingredients from our local farmers market and I believe that makes all the difference.  I did add the juice of one small lime for a little bit of kick.  Also added just a few drops of hot sauce.  This sauce makes great chilaquiles as well as enchiladas.  A must try (again and again)!  Thanks for sharing, Sandy!

This was incredibly easy to make, and I can see how versatile this sauce can be on a variety of items.  I did not have the jalepeno peppers so I made it without, and still  loved it.  I am thinking it is on the sweeter side side versus spicier.  Thanks.

Wonderful, We used it on grilled chicken, fried eggs, and in the nachos you mentioned. This is a basic recipe, and should be that way! Adding anything else will degrade the salsa. Thank you for the additional recipe using Salsa de Tomatillo.

This was excellent! I didn't change a thing. If you desire more heat then you can add more jalapeno peppers, but do so in small amounts - don't want it too hot! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I like my salsa chunky so I just mashed the tomatillos instead of putting in the food processor.  Since it's just me I made a half recipe.  So yummy.

I threw everything except the chicken broth in the blender to chop it into tiny pieces then put the chicken broth into a pot, added the blended vegetables and cooked it to my desired thickness. Fast, easy, delicious!  (No garlic in mine as we are intolerant. If I were to use garlic I would chop and sauté it before adding the rest of the ingredients. ). This was a great green sauce for my chicken enchiladas.  Also delicious as a tortilla chip dip.

The lady that runs the deli at work makes a killer green sauce for the breakfast tacos.  She told me what she put in it, but not the quantities.  This recipe seemed to match hers.  My salsa looked like the one in the picture, but it didn't look like hers.  It was way, way more bitter than I would like.  Reading the reviews, some say to not boil the tomatillos too long or else they'll be bitter, and others say to boil them for at least 10 minutes because if they're not cooked enough they'll be bitter.  I boiled them only for 5, and they had not split yet.

The other thing was that the cilantro was overpowering.  I'll cut back on that for the next attempt.

Having said all that, I need to confess that I'm not certain that the veggies I got were the best quality.  We made a quick stop into a Sprouts, which was on our way home.  This Sprouts does not have a lot of traffic, and you have to always check the expiration dates.  The tomatillos seemed okay, but this was the first time I had ever purchased tomatillos, so I didn't know what to look for.  The peppers (1 jalapeno and 1 serrano) were not very firm.  The garlic, onion, lime, and cilantro seemed fine.

Delicious and for my family we liked some cumin in it as well (1/2 tsp). Took the advice of others and roasted garlic, tomatillos, and jalapenos. Added 1 tsp salt for our liking. We used it for tortilla chips only and it was GREAT!

Absolutely hands down my favorite salsa. I did add a tsp of lime juice, but other than that followed the recipe to a T. Muy bueno!

This is absolutely awesome...just like my favorite Mexican Restaurant serves on their salsa bar. Delicious with chips. You can make it hotter if you want to by adding more jalapeno chilies.

I made this last night and it was very good, I didn't measure anything just kind of eyeballed it and it still came out great!  Salsa verde is my favorite on tacos, nachos, burritos and now I can make my own.  I used mine on salmon and tilapia tacos and it was lovely.  Thank you for such a simple a delicious recipe.  Will be making all the time!

Super easy and adjustable. I got a pound of tomatillas in my CSA box and a bunch of cilantro so I used the search to find a recipe that used both. I landed on this one and guessed on measure because some of the tomatillas were twice the size as others and I only had 9.

Wish the recipe included directions for the prepping before simmering the tomatillas as I'd never worked with them before. I husked them and washed them with LemonBrite (I wash almost all my produce) and then put them to cook.

Took it to a party with some authentic tortilla chips and made it mild by seeding & ribbing the jalepenos.

This is actually, the exact same way my mom makes salsa de tomatillo, it is fabulous indeed, although no matter what, mine is never as good as hers. :D  
besides the cilantro you can add chopped scallions. depending on what you are going to do with it you can increase the amount of jalapeños to make it hotter, for example two jalapeños are fine when you are going to make enchiladas or chilaquiles, but if you are going to serve this with tacos or chips you may want to add a couple more jalapeños. you can also add a can of tomato puree.

Wow! Incredibly delcious! I added a Poblano pepper to this, and used three canned jalapenos because the store was completly out of fresh! I was surprised. Nonetheless, this turned out great.

Didn't work for our family, we apparently aren't cilantro lovers.  It was way too overpowering.  I will continue searching for green hot sauce recipes.  If I make it again, I will use dried cilantro, very little of it.

This recipe lacks something.  It just doesn't have that "salsa" flavor.  I ended up adding some canned regular salsa to it, just to give it some flavor.  I wouldn't try it again.

I used a small onion, and it still tasted a little too oniony for me. I also used 3 jalapenos to make it a little more picante.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe.

I had 30 tomatillos so I tripled this recipe. I cooked the tomatillos in the air fryer. I think softening in the oven or air fryer retains all of the juice. In any case, it worked well. it tastes delicious and was real simple to throw together. Gets better overnight in the fridge.

I grilled an onion and Serrano peppers (I like hot) and added that, which gave it a very smoky taste.  It was still a little soupy for my taste so I put it in a saucepan over low heat to get rid of some the fluid.  Husband loved it.

This is deluxe, and easy. too.
i used one jalepeno pepper and one 1/2 serrano pepper, just the right heat for us. Use a little ore garlic. too.
Can freeze in smaller batches for ready sauce anytime.

Use the bbq grill to make the tomatillos a little chard. Jalapenos can be replaced by Chipotle chillies which will enhance the flavor significantly.

Quick, easy and has excellent flavor. This recipe is very versatile.  As others noted you can add an ingredient or two (cumin,  lime) or roast the tomatillos, but it's great as written, too.

This was super easy to make, and very tasty.  It was my first time making homemade salsa of any kind, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much better it was than canned or bottled.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except added a diced yellow bell pepper and some cumin to the mix.  I used this as a sauce for enchiladas.  It worked perfectly, and there was enough salsa left over to use as a dipping sauce for chips.

This salsa is really good fresh but doesn't store well in the refrigerator.  I like cooked green salsa better for keeping on hand all week.

fantastic!  I didn't have jalapeños available at the time but had some fire roasted hot hatch green chiles.  I added these and it was frickin fantastic!  So flavorful, roasty, and just a bit of pow.

So yummy! It starts out kind of bland but after "setting" in the fridge for several hours (overnight for best results) the flavor really pops! I did add an extra pepper (serrano or jalapeno work well) because I like mine to have a bit more kick to it. Brought it to an outing with my friends and there was nothing left to bring home! Everybody raved about it.

Great recipe! If you find that the tomatillos are a little acidic add a pinch of baking soda to the mix. Less than 1/4 of a tsp. It'll neutralize the acid.

I thought this was a great salsa. Did everything exactly the same except instead of 2 jalapeno's I used 1 Serrano and 1 jalapeno being that it's difficult to find hot jalapeno's sometimes.

i made this with canned Tomatillos, since that is the only thing that we have here in Sweden, and believe me, it was a journey finding and getting them.  It was pretty good, but something was missing.  I might try another recipe only to find the right combination that my mother use to make.

VERY good! I LOVE Tomatillo sauce, but this was my first time actually making it and I am hooked.  I used a little more garlic and used a serrano pepper with all of the seeds, instead of a jalapeno. Thanks for sharing your recipe! My fiance loves it as well. This will be going on our "menu"...

I thought this recipe was quite good, but after I made a few alterations to it.  I initially made the recipe as directed, but found it a bit too tart.  (Yes, I know tomatillos are generally more tart, but this was even more so.)  So we added about half a lime's worth of juice and a 1/2 teaspoon sugar.  This cut the bitterness nice and made it a very good tomatillo salsa!

This was a really good salsa. I gave it four stars because I still felt the need to add some smoked Tabasco to the finished product, even after leaving it in the fridge for a few hours. We used the recommendation of the author and mixed it with shredded chicken, poured over tortilla chips, topped with cheese and popped it under the broiler for a few minutes. It was delicious.

I tried this and it is wonderful. I followed the directions exactly like the recipe called for.  My Friends from Mexico who love authentic Mexican food thought it was great and ate what I gave them in a few miutes with their supper. We ate it on chicken tacos.  I'll make this again!!

I liked this recipe, but it good mixed reviews at the party I took it to.  The less "Foody" people wouldn't try it.  Those who did thought it tasted like pickles.  However, my friend who is a Chef and his food-oriented vegetarian wife loved it.  I guess it depends on the crowd.

I used between 10-12 tomatillos when I made this, it was the amount we got from the farmer. I toned it down a bit by only using one jalapeno and it still had a kick to it, IMO. We eat it with tortilla chips as a snack. It's a wonderful and easy recipe.

Out of this world ! I made it to go with "Amy's cilantro cream sauce" recipe from this site, since you cant find  green salsa here too often.  This was just  so so so GOOD! I added more cilanro then called for because I wanted to use it up, and it was FANTASTIC!
