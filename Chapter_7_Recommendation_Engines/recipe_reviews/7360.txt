This was an amazingly moist cake.  For sour milk I used an old family method:  2 tbsp vinegar and enough milk to make 1 cup (I only used 3/4 C like the recipe calls though).  I frosted it with a little homemade chocolate icing and sprinkled it with chopped walnuts.  This cake was a real nice treat and great to take to work if made in a 13x9 size.

This was the best banana cake I have ever had.  It is so moist, light and fluffy.  I did add 1/2 TBS of cinnamon and instead of using sour milk I used 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup milk.  This was so good plain I didn't even bother frosting it.  Thanks for the recipe.

With all the banana cake recipes listed here, I didn't know which one to make.  But don't look any further--this is the recipe you want! 
:-)
I made this (in a 9x13 pan) for my husband's birthday, even though he's not real big on bananas.  He loved it, and so did everyone else!  (I accidently poured in the whole cup of sour milk that I had prepared, and it still turned out to be perfect!)  
I added chocolate chips (as others suggested), and I topped it with the "Banana Cream Frosting" (another "allrecipes.com" recipe; see my review for that too).  It tasted absolutely delicious this way!!  Very moist and filling!  Thanks Carol!

This recipes is the best!!! I am 14 and I bake this for my parents.  THey love them.  THey take them to work, and they don't even have a chance to try them because they disappear so fast! I bake them as cupcakes.  It makes 24.  For the butter/margarine, I would use one stick of butter/margarine and 1/4 cup applesauce.  It cuts back a little on the calories and you can't taste the difference.  THis is the best banana cake/cupcake recipes ever!!!

Wonderful cake! I made this into cupcakes and it made 24 perfect, moist and spongy cakes. I added 2 tsp. cinnamon and frosted it with a double batch of "Quick and Almost-Professional Buttercream Icing" from this site. I would have liked to have made a cream cheese icing for this cake, but didn't have any cream cheese. I get the best results when making homeade cake by making sure to really beat the butter and sugar well (medium speed for at least 2 minutes). I then added the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Then I added the bananas. Add the milk and flour mixture alternately just until incorporated. I baked them for about 23 minutes. To make the sour milk, I put 3/4 Tbsp. vinegar in a measuring cup and added milk to make 3/4 cup. I highly recommend this recipe!

Wonderful, light cake.  I added 2/3cup of miniature chocolate chips and topped with a Chocolate Streusel.  Delicious!  Chocolate Streusel:  1cup brown sugar, 1/4cup unsweetened cocoa, 6Tbs. butter, 1/2cup flour--pulse in food processor.

Make no mistake, this is banana CAKE, not banana BREAD.  It is light, fluffy and, for some reason I don’t understand, looks like a yellow cake rather than the darker, banana flecked cake I would have expected.  It’s pleasantly sweet, buttery rich and moist. I prepared the recipe as written save for substituting buttermilk for the sour milk. This recipe was just perfect for the cupcakes I used it for, frosted with Texas Chocolate Frosting, also from this site.

Very quick, very moist, very good.  Added milk to 3/4 Tablespoon of lemon juice to make 3/4 cup to sour it.  I put chocolate frosting on my portion (my husband can't have chocolate, so I didn't frost the whole thing)--yummy!

Yummy!!!!!  Rather than layering this cake I made two smaller cakes.  This banana cake is moist and tasty and lasts well in the fridge.

EXCELLENT!!  Nice and moist with a tender crumb.  It was probably even better the next day.  I made the recipe as written.  I didn't have cream cheese on hand to make frosting (although I LOVE cream cheese frosting) so I did a boiled brown sugar topping that my grandmother always put on her apple cake: Mix 1 cup brown sugar, 6 TB butter and 1/4 cup milk in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook at a good rolling boil for 3 minutes.  Pour hot mixture slowly onto warm/hot-out-of-the-oven cake (can even poke holes first if you like but not necessary).  Let cake cool to room temperature before serving. I love the caramelized brown sugar with the banana.  Next I'll try Ina Garten's peanut butter cream cheese frosting on it.  This recipe is definitely going in my recipe binder!!  Everyone loves it!

I think I know the problem some of you may be having with this recipe.  You must cream the butter and sugar together BEFORE adding the eggs and vanilla.  If you try to mix them all together at once, the butter will not incorporate into the batter.  I experienced this because I was in a hurry and made it exactly as directed.  It was impossible to correct this even with my heavy-duty mixer.

This was so good! I always try to make recipes a little healthier for my family and here is what I did...  Used 3 ripe bananas.  Instead of 3/4 cup of butter, I used 6 TBL butter softened and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce(next time I will use 4 TBL butter softened and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar, instead of 1 1/2 cups.  I used 2 cups whole white wheat flour and 1/2 cup AP flour, instead of 2 1/2 cups AP flour.  Then just used buttermilk instead of sour milk.  This cake came out so light, fluffy, moist and delicious!  It was sweet enough with the reduced sugar and then the icing added sweetness aswell.  I baked this cake in a 9x13 pan at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  I used half of the white chocolate cream cheese icing from this site by BAKERAMA: Carrot Cupcakes with White Chocolate Cream Cheese Icing.

I have made dozens of recipes from this site to take to parties without trying them first and have always had rave reviews.  But wow was I embarrased with this one.  This cake for so heavy and dry and gallon of milk wouldn't have helped. It was 8 months ago I made this to take to some friends house and we still talk and laugh about it.

I made exactly as stated, it was the best moist banana cake.  I did not frost the cake, I didn't think it needed it.  For the sour milk I used 1tbsp of lemon juice and then added the milk to equal the 3/4 cup. 
I will be making this again!

I am SO GLAD I didn't listen to the few reviews that were negative! I made this cake because I wanted to do something different with my ripe bananas besides making them into bread. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II for the frosting, and it worked beautifully with this cake. The other reviewers that rated it so poorly clearly were doing something wrong. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautiful. Thanks Carol!

Love this recipe, I have made about 20 cakes so far for bake sales, friends and family, everyone adores it.  The only thing is the sour milk was not working out for me, it left the cake puddingy in the middle, so I start using regular fresh milk and it comes out perfect everytime.

Made 1/2 of this recipe in mini muffin pan. Baked for 15 minutes. They came out great. Made the other 1/2 in a 9X9 pan and it took so long to bake in the center that it came out dry at the edges. My advise is not to make this in a small pan. I had this recipe a long time back from a neighbor, was glad to find it again.

This is a good cake. I baked in a Bundt pan for 45 minutes and I added 1 cup of chopped toasted walnuts, 2 tsps. of Cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of Nutmeg. I used Buttermilk instead of sour milk. It was delicious, no frosting needed. Could sift on some powdered sugar for presentation.

This cake was really, very good.  Better than what I was anticipating.  I had one banana to use up and it equaled 1/2 cup.  Perfect amount to make half a cake (9x9 pan).  This was very moist and full of flavor.  I had some 'Grocery Store Frosting' from AR in the freezer and that is what I frosted it with.  It was a very nice dessert after dinner.  I will be using this recipe again.

the batter tasted really good, was a bit thicker than a from-mix cake. added 1/2 tsp more vanilla. I baked in 2x 9 inch rounds, the cakes rose ok, not over the edge of the pans, but I think that might have more to do with my oven than the recipe. they smell really good, tomorrow I will frost with peanut butter frosting. after I cut it I will know if its a 5 star recipe ;-)

My 4 year old asked for banana cake for his birthday and I wanted a recipe that didn't taste like banana bread.  This was great the day I made it, but I must say it tasted superb the next day when it had been in the fridge! I put a cream cheese frosting on it, but I would have preferred it with nothing at all.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added some finely chopped walnuts. My husband took 1 bite and said it was the best banana cake he ever had. EXCELLENT RECIPE! And it was really quick to make.  I had to bake it for about 50 minutes in a heart shaped springform insert (would have been equiv of 2-9" rounds).

I looked hard on this website trying to find a banana cake that wasn't the consistency of banana bread... I do believe I found it.  The texture was just wonderful and the flavor delish.
Just due to the amount of bananas I wanted use I ended up doing 1.5x ingredients.  So I chose to bake it in an 11x15 dish.  Instead of sour milk I used yogurt.  I also added just a touch of fresh ground nutmeg.

This recipe is very good - BUT - the timing is all wrong for cooking it.  If you're making the layer cake as I did, cook for 35-40 minutes, it is not done in 17-20 minutes.  I assume the 9x13 cake will cook in 17-20 minutes.

Love this recipe!  My kids can't get enough!  I don't make the frosting because it's wonderful all on it's own.  Mine has never come out dry, always real moist and yummy!  I do use 2 cups of mashed bananas so maybe that helps.
Thanks!

This is so good!  I did a few small tweaks to make it lighter and it didn't taste at all like it was a 'diet' recipe to me.  I used 3/4 cup of applesauce to replace the butter, egg whites in place of the eggs, and did the milk trick that everyone is talking about in the reviews (put 1 1/2 TBSP of vinegar into the 3/4 cup, then fill the rest with milk to sour it).  I also used closer to 2 cups of mashed bananas (about four large, ripe bananas).  This cake was very moist and tender and a big hit with my husband.  This teacher gives it an A+!!!

We have just two pieces left of this yummy banana cake.  I followed the recipe exactly - had intended to add cinnamon as others suggested, but forgot.  I baked the cake in a bundt pan and set timer for 45 minutes; left it in for an additional 2.  I felt that it still could have cooked for another couple of minutes but my sweetheart said it was perfect as it was.  I was going to drizzle frosting on it but we decided to have it plain.  He's English so put cream over his; I tasted it and, well, what's not to like.  I like it perfectly well plain.  It's very moist and as one reviewer said, "has a tender crumb."  There's good banana flavor but yet you don't feel as though you are eating banana bread. I will make this again, definitely.  Thank you for great recipe.

This cake is pretty good. I mainly chose to make it because I had 3 small/med. over ripe bananas I needed to use. When mashed they made exactly 1c. I baked it in a 9x13 pan, and it was done in 30 min. I used all the butter I had in the cake and didn't have any to make frosting. I sprinkled chocolate chips all over the top, a few minutes before it was done, to melt and spread in lieu of frosting. I guess we like it, because there are only 3 of us AND only 3 little pieces left a mere 5 hours later!

Made this cake today using 1c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar. Everything else I used was as the recipe stated. I find the cake to be rather bland and dry. I topped it with a coconut cream cheese frosting, which make it eatable, but I won't be making this again.

This cake came out great.  Fluffy, light, and moist.  Filled a 9x13 pan almost to the top when baked.  I did the sour cream milk mixture suggested by another reviewer and added mini chocolate chips.  It did not need frosting at all.  Super delicious all by itself!

This cake turned out wonderfully.  I made a 9 X 13 sheet cake with it and I used sour cream and milk instead of the sour milk as one other reviewer did.  I added a little guanabana nectar as well (just a touch).

It tastes great!  I didn't frost it either.  I doesn't need it.

This is delicious.  We used milk with lemon juice b/c we didn't have sour milk.  We also frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Yum!  We're not even huge banana fans but needed to use the brown ones up!

I'm guilty of changing things slightly because I couldn't find the baking soda, so replaced that amount with the baking powder.  I am also guilty of not measuring the bananas, just threw in 3 very ripe medium sized ones.  The cake was amazing and a new family favourite.  Thank you.

This is one of the lightest, fluffiest cakes I have ever tried. I whipped the sugar and butter until fluffy, then added vanilla, the eggs one at a time, then the bananas. Alternated the dry with the milk. I added some dark chocolate slivers. I don't even think I'll ice it (I LOVE icing) this cake is that good without it. Thank you!!!

I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9" pan for about 30 minutes.  Since I couldn't halve an egg, I used just one egg and a little more mashed banana.  I ended up using two bananas for 3/4 cup.  The cake is very moist.  I topped it with a basic cream cheese frosting.  The cake has great banana flavor.

I just made this for the second time and it turned out perfect.  I like it much better than banana bread, it's less dense and fantastic with cream cheese icing or as is.  I used sour cream instead of sour milk, 1/2 cup butter + 1/4 applesauce, only 1 cup sugar, I also added a little cinnamon & nutmeg.  Baked for 35 minutes.  The browner the bananas the better!

Make this just as written and you won't be disappointed. But be sure to use real buttermilk. The substitute may 'work' but it will not yield quite the same results. This cake is fluffy, moist and full of flavor. I frosted it with "Banana Nut Frosting" from this site and what a wonderful combination it made!

This recipe turned out great!  I added 2/3 cup mini chocolate chips and baked donuts in my donuts pan; iced with a thin chocolate glaze...they turned out perfect!  My kids, and all of their friends, ate them as fast as I could make them!  Thank you for the great recipe...I know that I will be making these again!  I think that I will try applesauce in place of the banana and add cinnamon; dust with cinnamon and confectioners sugar too. Yum!

I don't know how anyone can be unhappy with this recipe.  I had a little more than a cup of banana only because 2 wasn't quite a cup and 3 was more than a cup.  Other than that, followed the recipe to a T (it did take a LITTLE longer in the oven because of the extra banana I assume).  It was moist and VERY flavorful.  I topped with a cream cheese frosting as suggested and it was perfection.  DEFINITELY adding this one to my 'must do again' recipe list.

I browned the butter and used sour cream in place of the milk. Topped with a glaze of 2 tbsp browned butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 3 tbsp milk. Really good.

LOVE IT!  So light and fluffy. Used other reviewer tip for sour milk (1 cup milk to 2 tbs vinegar, but only still use 3/4 cup) and added choco chips to have my batch (I made cupcakes -20 min, mini cupcakes 15 min) Chocolate chips won! So great.

Not sure what happened, but mine came out dense, much more bread-like than cake-like. I wanted to make a cake for my son's birthday, so I was dissapointed in the result. The flavor was good, not great, so I'm not sure if I'd make it again.

Amazing cake! This was my first go at banana cake and it couldn't have turned out better! I used the suggestion of 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup milk for sour milk. I used a "frosting" made of peanut butter, powdered sugar, and water to a thin consistency- great combination! I will definitely be making this cake again! My husband even went back for seconds!!!!

The kids helped make this one with brown frozen bananas. It was delicious. This is definitely cake not bread and was super moist. It was eaten very quickly. Thanks!!

I have made this recipe a few times now, both as a cake and as muffins.  FABULOUS!!  I added 1/2 tsp Cinnamon (could likely add more) to it, and instead of sour milk I just threw in a splash of lemon juice to my milk and let it sit for a bit.  I especially enjoyed this recipe as a muffin recipe.  I added 1 cup of milk chocolate chips to the batter.  I made 20 very large muffins.  On 10 of them I put some chocolate chips on top of the muffin before baking (made for nice finished presentation) and the other 10 I put on some cream cheese icing.....WOW....that was a winner.  Would make for great birthday cake "cupcakes" for kids (my nephew's couldn't get enough).

Banana cake has been a favorite for my husband's birthday for 19 years.  The recipe I used in the past used a box cake.  I am living in Tanzania now and don't have access to box cake mixes very often.  This recipe was great and better than the box version.  Thanks for making Tanzania more like home.

I made this in two pans and frosted in between and on top with cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla.  I also cut strawberries and put them in between and on the top layer and sprinkles with walnuts.  Not only was the appearance beautiful, the cake was terrific!!!  Rave reviews from co workers.  I will keep and make this again and again.  Oh and I used 4 bananas that were going bad.  :D

the best banana cake i ever made, just make sure you don't overbake it or else the cake loses its amazingly fluffy and moist texture. Also instead of 3/4 cup butter i used oil for half the amount and butter for the other half and it still tasted amazing. thanks for the wonderful, delicious recipe!

I used brown rice flour to make it gluten free.  Didn't alter the measurements and it worked really well. Definitely will make again. I made one layer cake, and 12 cupcakes. Next time I'll play with adding cinnamon and nutmeg. Am about to make a goat cheese icing, which should be good.  EDIT: I made this again, and it is such a good recipe. I used soy egg nog for the milk, and added nutmeg and cinnamon. Made a butter cream icing. This recipe is a keeper! My new favourite way to use old bananas!

Three people have already asked me for the recipe. I used the cream cheese frosting 1 recipe with a banana added. You have to add more powdered sugar to compensate for the banana, but it is excellent.

The flavor was great, but adding the banana to the frosting made it really runny, never did set up like cream cheese frosting usually does. Will make again, but leave the bananas to the cake batter only.

This recipe produced a rich, moist cake with strong banana flavor.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I was hoping for a slightly lighter cake texture.  Hard to do with so much banana in the batter - but that's what gave it such great flavor!  Frosted with Coconut-Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.  Together it's a winning combination that's close to perfect.

This cake is amazing!  I made the recipe just as it was written.  I used a little vinegar in milk to make the sour milk.  It was delicious with and without frosting.  This is definitely one I will keep!

I made this for my boyfriend and i. I followed a few other's suggestions and added 1 tbl cinnamon. And used half cup sour cream with 1/4 cup milk. And two tsp vanilla instead.  I used store bought cream cheese frosting and added banana too it. Yes it got more runny but I added cornstarch.  We both love this recipe and its light & fluffy not heavy.  Thank you.

It had a very good taste but is very dense and did not raise as I had expected.  Maybe my milk was not room temp I will try this again - the taste is worth the second try.  I did everything as written.   I also used a persons suggestion for the banana cream frosting (from this site) - that I did not like.  This will be much better with a regular frosting.

I adore baking and when i made this recipe I made a banana cream by taking some mashed bananas and adding whipping cream in my blender. So Delicous! I think sometimes frosting can be too sweet, but with banana cream it's light and fluffy real crowd pleaser.

Well, good flavour but a little more dense than I was expecting, given the reviews. There was a thin layer of under-baked cake on the bottom. Also, it certainly doesn't need 1 1/2 cups sugar! The over ripe bananas make it sweet enough - I used 3/4 cup sugar.

The only reason I'm rating this cake a 4 is I didn't find the banana flavour very intense.  I used just over 1 cup (3 bananas) but I think I will add a 4th banana next time.  The texture of the cake was exactly what I was looking for though.  A fluffy cake!  not a dense solid banana bread that most of the cakes I have tried on here have turned out to be. For some extra flavour I also took 1 cup of batter and added 5 tbsp cinnamon to it.  I then spread that on top of the cake in the pan and used a knife to swirl it through.  Not necessary by any means, but just something we like the taste of.   Yes ladies and gentleman, this really is a Banana CAKE!  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

I always make a recipe as is the first time I make it.  I have made this one twice.  Delicious! Best banana cake recipe around. Light, and like a cake and not like bread.

first off,i used shortening instead of butter, and buttermilk in place of the sour milk. then I only had two bananas so it didn't make quite a whole cup, so I filled the rest of the measuring cup with more buttermilk. and I made two nine inch rounds, but it took thirty minutes not twenty, though it might be twenty minutes if youre using dark or coated pans as this speeds the baking process. it looks very good and came up high. well see tomorrow how it tastes.

My mother-in-law has been having me make her this cake about once a week. She and her husband really like it. I like it also. This last week I decide to try half brown sugar half white sugar and that made a nice top on it. I used about 3 bananas well browned. This is a keeper.

Just made this recipe into cupcakes! Followed ingredients exactly, just measured into paper-lined muffin tin, filling cups almost to the top of the paper. Baked for 25 minutes at 350. They stayed pretty flat, didn't rise up too high. Torn between making a caramel frosting or a peanut butter frosting! I did just try one plain, and they are really really good! Very soft and sweet. Thanks!

This was amazing! Light & fluffy and not overwhelmingly banana. Added some cinnamon & used plain yogurt instead of the sour milk. Didn't bother with the frosting. It's great on it's own!

I was looking for something other than banana bread to make with the over ripe bananas.  I only had 2 medium and they made one cup exactly. This cake is very good.  It's  light and moist. Good without the frosting.  I will make this one again.

This is a cake with a lovely, light texture.  A wonderful, delicious, cake! (I don't like banana bread).  It took 45 minutes to bake in a 13 x 9 pan, perhaps because I live near 6,000 ft altitude.  I reduced the baking soda a pinchful for that reason--maybe it helped--or not--the cake rose beautifully, in any case.  I squeezed half of a lemon on the mashed bananas to brighten the flavor a bit, but that was due solely to my preference.  I made a cream cheese frosting, applying it when the cake was still somewhat warm so that it was more like a glaze.  My husband and I both had to have seconds!  YUMMY!  I won't even try other versions: If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

I loved this cake. I hate recipes that are complicated with weird directions and ingredients because it's making up for a flaw somewhere else in the cake. This one was PERFECT. Simple. I made 2 9" rounds and they came out beautiful. Did cook for about 25 minutes. Frosted with a simple cream cheese frosting and topped with walnuts. Beautiful, simple and so yummy. Some of the other cakes on here are complicated for unknown reasons. Can't go wrong here. (used about 4 ripe bananas also.. so yummy).

This was amazing!! I will never make banana bread again, this was so moist. I used recommendation on a review to make sour milk with vinegar and I used self rising flour omitting the salt and baking powder but added the soda. Made a basic cream cheese frosting. This was better chilled the next day I just couldn't quit eating it Mmmm

This was very good! Perfect just the way it was written. My whole family loved it. I used the Banana Cream Frosting from allrecipes.com and it was fabulous. Thank you for a great recipe. A great way to use up ripe bananas. I'll be making this one again!

This is the best banana cake recipe I've found!  My only criticism is that the baking time is always much longer than called for.  I often make this in two 8"x8" pans in order to reduce the baking time.

This cake was amazingly delicious.  It was light and fluffy, definitely cake, not the bread-like texture many other reviewers (and I) expected.  Obviously you should make sure that you use very ripe bananas or it will be very starchy, not sweet enough, and will not have the banana flavor you are looking for.  I received rave reviews from everyone who had some.

I made this cake for an event at my son's school and it was a big hit. I took the advice of a couple of other reviewers and frosted it with simple chocolate frosting. I found the texture to be light and not heavy at all - I did make sure to thoroughly cream the butter, sugar, and eggs in my kitchenaide mixer. I think this is the key to ending up with a light cake. Yummy. Highly Recommend.

This cake was too dense for me (several of my guests agreed).  We thought it tasted a little "flour-y" as well.  I frosted it with "Banana Cream Frosting" from this site.  Fortunately, that is a light whipped topping.  If I had used something heavy (like a cream cheese-based frosting), it would have been way too heavy on the tongue..

I made this cake just for fun and i had always wondered what a banana cake tasted like! I was very good i made it as cupcakes and used half of the recipe. I changed a few things though. I had just baked something before this and used the last eggs so i used buttermilk i also subsituted buttermilk for sour milk. And i used 1/3 of the amount of sugar as brown sugar. I would use this recipe again :)

Absolutely delicious! I am always looking to reduce the fat in my baked goods so I replaced 1/2 cup of the butter with apple sauce. I only had an apple-mango sauce (normally in my kids' lunches) so it became "apple mango banana cake". So moist! I used a chocolate frosting. A keeper - thanks for the recipe!

I made this cake yesterday and the center sunk. I followed the recipe except, as read in other reviews, used 1/2c sour cream and 1/4c milk instead of sour milk. 

I creamed the sugar and butter together first for at least 2 minutes, then added one egg at a time, then the vanilla, mixing between all that. I greased and floured the pan. I checked it at 20 minutes, but it was obvious that it wasn't done. At 33 minutes I thought it was done. The edges were quite brown and pulled away from the pan, the cake was golden, domed, and springy to the touch in the center. Toothpick came out clean. I took it out of the oven and onto a rack, and a few minutes later, the center had sunk. There were spots that it was not cooked well enough in the center, but something else went wrong for sure. I don't know what though. Others have had the same problem in their reviews. 

The cake was edible along the edges, but my husband said he could barely taste the banana. A lot of work for major disappointment. 
Looking for another banana cake recipe. :(

Absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of making cupcakes rather than a cake.  I made them big, filling the cups almost full.  Baked for 18 minutes @ 350 and they were moist and wonderful.

LOVE IT!!! I made this recipe today and it was amazing! I didn't have sour milk on hand so I did what another reader did and used 1/2 a cup sour cream and 1/4 a cup milk. And it turned out so moist and delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

I totally agree with the other reviewers. This cake was moist, soft, delicious.   I mixed the sugar and butter, before adding other ingredients, as has been suggested by other reviewers. I followed almost the entire recipe. The only substitution I made was using buttermilk instead of sour milk (but that was because I didn't know what sour milk exactly meant.) Buttermilk can be homemade with full-fat milk and some lemon juice added, so I guess it must have the same effect as sour milk. Anyway, the muffins came out great!  I made exactly 21 muffins with this recipe. I had to put them in the oven for 25 minutes.

Great super light, moist and fluffy cake NOT a banana bread which is exactly what I was looking for.  I made this recipe into cupcakes w/a chocolate fudge frosting for a friends birthday, fantastic!  Will definitely make them again.

This has become my go-to banana cake recipe! Lovely, light and moist. It's a real crowd pleaser!  I frost it with cream cheese frosting (simply cream cheese and powdered sugar, to taste).

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out so thick and dense that we can't eat it.  The flavor is great, but the texture is awful.  I don't know what went wrong because so many other posts say is light and cake-like.  I'd be very open to your opinions because I'm really not much in the kitchen!! :)

Delicious and moist cake. I used 3 very over ripe bananas and baked in a 9 x 13 pan. It took about 45 min. I will definitely make again.

Given to my husband to take to work, the fluffy cake was wolfed down quickly with many compliments. I ensured the butter, eggs and sugar were beaten well for several minutes to make it light. In a 9x13 inch pan it took just over 30 minutes. Before baking I sprinkled some raw sugar on top to give it a sweeter crisp crust, so I would not need to frost it.

This cake was very easy to make and came out perfect.  Tasted like banana pound cake.     We made ours in a cake pan that allows you to fill a cake  - we filled ours with a banana creme (made with confectioners sugar, banana mash, a dash of vanilla and crisco, like an angel creme donut with banana) and frosted it with a milk chocolate frosting.  It was FABULOUS.  We actually finished the cake (we usually throw cake away around here).      We used the vinegar in the milk trick for making sour milk and it worked well.  I tasted it to be sure. Yuck!    We also had to cook our layers for five minutes longer than the longest time suggested -so be sure to test with a toothpick.  However, because of the banana, the cake was still very moist and not at all overdone.      Try this recipe!! Better than banana bread and better than cake!!

Very good - I added a little more banana than it caled for just to use up my overripe bananas. Also subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for that amount of butter. Chopped up a couple chocolate bars and stirred them in, too.

I make this almost weekly, exactly as written. Great way to use those ripe bananas and super if you want a cake instead of a quick bread. A big hit at the office and those who stop by. A keeper.

This CAKE rocks! I like it bc it's not "bready," it definitely has the consistency of a cake. I cooked mine in a bundt pan for around 40 mins @ 350 degrees! Came out absolutely beautiful and oh so yummy! Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, as I am a cook, and not much of a baker (this was only my second attempt at a cake).  The result was a dense but delicious cake that everyone enjoyed.  Even my girlfriend, who doesn't normally like cake, ate a second piece.

This cake was wonderful! It's very moist and was a breeze to make. It has a great texture that's nothing like bread. I would recommend not using an extremely sweet icing because the taste of the cake is so good and the sweet will mask it too much. I'll be making this again for sure.

Delicious! Very moist and cake-like, which is exactly what I was looking for. I also had a little bit of melted chocolate from another recipe (melted semi sweet choc chips) and I swirled it into the batter at the last minute. Yum!!! Like others suggested, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site and it's great!

I loved this recipe and cake. I was beautiful and tasted wonderful. I put a creamy butter cream frosting on it and it was to die for. My husband had two piece right after I put the frosting on. This is a true thumbs up.

This is a wonderful cake, so smooth and velvety when you eat it.

My only change was that I used 2 eggs instead of 3, i discovered only after beating the sugar and butter together that i only had 2 eggs.

The kids and my husband love it, I made it last night and there is not enough of it left to make frosting it worth while.....

I really beat the batter, it actually looked lighter after I finished beating it.  I am wondering if the people who found that this was heavy beat the batter enough

My husband gave the 4 stars. He likes it.
I add some ingredients to the original recipe:
1 tablespoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 3 tablespoon coconut rum mixed with smashed bananas. Instead of sour cream, yogurt.
And the temperature change after 25 minutes. From 350 degrees F to 325 degrees F for 10 more minutes.
For me was excellent.

This was stellar I made a 2 layer version with cream cheese frosting.  Only thing I changed was instead of "sour milk"  I used 1/2 c light sour cream and 1/4 c milk mixed together.  This was so good my girlfriends mom who hates anything with cooked bananas asked for the recipe!

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted banana cake, not banana bread, and this recipe delivered.  I creamed the sugar and butter really well first, then added the eggs and vanilla and creamed until it was a frosting-like consistency.  For sour milk I used 2 tblsp. lemon juice plus enough milk to make a cup, letting it sit until the milk thickened and then measuring 3/4 cup.  The recipe made a perfect 2 dozen cupcakes, baked for 17 minutes.  I frosted with cream cheese frosting and YUM!

I Love this recipe. I wanted to make something for some people i know at an assistant living home. So i made them these into muffins and they love their frosting so i went with a lighter frosting rather than a cream cheese i used cool whipped frosting from this site and i used half applesauce for the oil and a little bit of cinn. and nutmeg, they loved them! real good cake muffins! very moist

I forgot to add the milk after getting it all mixed(of all things), anyways dumped it in with some vinegar and mixed lightly. Only 1 cup raw sugar for us, as bananas have a lot of sugar to begin with. Wow was it light & fluffy. I made muffins added white and dark chips to some. Iced it with cream cheese and topped some with coconut and others with walnuts..yum.

Very good.  The recipe uses the basics that most of us have in the cupboard.  Made if for my daughter's first birthday...cream cheese filling and buttercream frosting for the big one and just buttercream for hers'.  Turned out great.

This is the first recipe I've tried on allrecipes ... and I'm a fan already. Fluffy and moist. Didn't frost but it goes great with vanilla ice cream (while it's warm). I added lemon and orange zest and a large handful of dried cranberries. Cracked on top but probably because my baking tin was too small (made 2 small cakes) but I'm definitely all fired up to bake more now.

Pretty good. Only slightly lighter in texture than banana bread. I baked mine as 9" layers, which took 28 minutes to cook. I used cream cheese frosting, without the added banana. I would make it again.

I made this for a church dinner and it seemed to go over very well.  I liked it a lot.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour milk and it turned out fine.  I frosted it with a simple frosting (2tbs each butter and crisco, a little vanilla, milk and enough powdered sugar to make it spread easy) and  sprinkled with chopped walnuts.  I am enjoying a second piece right now!

The cake was ok.  It just seemed like it needed something else - not much flavor.  I also added a banana to the frosting and it made it very runny. I topped the cake and frosting with coconut which seemed to give it some extra flavor.

I made this recipe for our daycare center's christmas party.  It received rave reviews.  It was very easy to make.  I followed the advice of a previous review and added 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix.  Yum!

It was doughy and heavy and too much like a wet quickbread. It needed more time than it said to cook. Overall, it was very bland. I would not make it again.

I am undecided on this recipe.  It is just missing something.  I made it twice thinking that the first time I made an error.  I really don't think I will try it a third time.  The Cake is dry and doesn't have much flavor.

I made this for some friends with 3 kids who came over for a bbq.  Kids ages 8, 5, 3.  They loved it as welll as the adults.  I used cream cheese frosting, but for a lighter dessert could use whipped cream.  This is the moistest, lightest cake!

I love this recipe! It was quick and easy and sooo good! I frosted it with a butter frosting because I didn't have any cream cheese, but that was to sweet. Now that I have cream cheese, I plan on making this the right way! I bet that plain cool whip would be good on this cake also. Thanks for an excellent recipe!!!!

Great as cupcakes without icing for toddlers.   Used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce.  Substituted milk with sour cream.  Makes a very good moist cupcake topped with whipped cream for a toddler smash cake.  Moist enough for a one year old with bananas!

When cake was fully baked it was fantastic, the best and lightest banana cake I have ever made. However it took nearly 30 minutes to completely bake.  That might explain the complaints about being flat and heavy.

I made this wonderful cake many many times. This time I made muffins with the  recipe. I made cream cheese frosting with  1 mashed banana. The main thing is to put from oven to freezer, makes this even more moist.

Made this 3/19/19 and followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk  as I had nearly a quart that had soured.  I had four very dark bananas.  The recipe is easy to make.  I made cupcakes which took about 22 minutes in the oven.  I sampled a couple without frosting and they were good--mild banana flavor.  I decided to frost with a chocolate frosting and used a recipe I had tried before (from a cookbook:  cocoa powder, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla) which is a nice, fudgy frosting.  The rich chocolate flavor of the frosting overpowered the cupcakes.  If I make this recipe again, I will frost with a cream cheese or vanilla frosting.

I don’t often review, but I give this an Oh-My-Gosh. This banana cake recipe was so easy to make and soooo good. I used a cream cheese frosting on the top and between the layers (although it doesn’t have to be a layer cake.) It made a wonderful breakfast/brunch cake, but also is a perfect dessert for anytime of the day.

This cake is absolutely wonderful! I had some very ripe bananas that I had frozen that I used in this and made it just the way the recipe says to, except I baked it in a bundt pan. I just adjusted the amount of bake time, but it got rave reviews from my family as well as our dinner guests! I also used the boiled brown sugar glaze that another reviewer recommended. Wow! Just made it that much better! Will definitely be making this one again!

I've made this recipe several times now.  Hubby loves it.  I don't even have to frost it, and it never sits for long before I find it all gone.  Love adding little nuts or tiny chippits in it some times for a bit of an extra treat

The cake was moist, light and everyone enjoyed it.  Cut back a little on the sugar and it was fine.  Made a cream cheese with banana frosting.  Again not too sweet.

Excellent cake. I’ve made so many times and after 1st them following recipe I’ve tweeted this. Use very ripe almost all brown bananas no 1. No 2 cut the fat I half and use parts butter/applesauce to equal the original recipe total for butter 3/4cup. No 3 cut the sugar down to 1 cup not 1 and 1/2 cups and add extra half cup of the over ripe bananas. I purée up the bananas in the nutri bullet to make for an even consistency. Bake at 350 for about 30 mins. It is excellent. And I use the cream cheese frosting no 2. I use half the recipe for 1 9x13 cake, I like icing but it can be too sweet.

wow! followed directions as is, Well except for the sour milk, I made it with vinegar.  this cake turned out amazing! I used a regular frosting recipe that was my mom's with butter and powdered sugar, made the cake taste even better. I don't know why I don't make more things from scratch because it's so easy and taste so much better.

Just made this cake this afternoon, in a 13 x 9 pan. Easy to make, and yummy served plain. I might add a topping to 'fancy it up' for company, but otherwise, we're loving it as-is! Will make this cake again.

I made this cake as instructed. My version of sour milk was an 1/4 of an 8oz container of sour cream with enough milk to equal 3/4 cup. This cake turned out amazing! I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting made from a recipe on AR. Just FYI... 2 ripe bananas equal 1 cup of mashed banana. Make this cake! Then give some to your neighbors.... they will love you!

I love banana bread but when I want banana cake, I want a receipe that is light, moist and tastes like banana. This is exactly what I have been looking for.  Easy to put together, I added 1/2 t. banana extract (I really love banana flavor) and baked 24 generous muffins with this recipe. I will frost these with a cream cheese or buttercream frosting but, honestly, they need no adornment.

Very tasty but I used the 9 x 13 pan.  Came out rather compressed rather than light and fluffy.  Used the sour milk method as well but did everything else according to the recipe.  Would look for a lighter, fluffier recipe next time.

This cake is kind of dry but not bad.  I think I'll add a little Greek yogurt or sour cream if I make this one again.  An extra banana maybe.

This is an easy banana cake recipe.  I love baking and this is a simple recipe. The butter and sugar are always creamed first in all recipes I bake. This is the way I was taught as a young girl.  Then add the eggs one at at a time and mix each one. Continue with the wet ingredients.   Sift dry ingredients together. Then mix wet and dry ingredients. I mix in dry  ingredients a little at a time. Bake and enjoy.

I ended up with a dense, heavy cake. I reviewed the recipe and can't figure out what went wrong. Butter was soft and completely  mixed with sugar.  Eggs and vanilla fully incorporated.  Flour was sifted with other dry ingredients.  Very odd. Flavor is decent but I wish I had made banana bread.

I loved the smell and the look of this cake initially but somehow the cake didn't rise. Only half of it did and the rest was doughy. It tasted heavenly but I don't know where I went wrong..

This was really delicious. I made it ahead of a hurricane last night so we'd have breakfast. I didn't frost. Excellent.

I made this as directed.  At the end I added 3/4 cup of cranisins.   Just because we like them.   My husband had a piece while hot,  then give it time to cool and had another.   I made a glaze out of  a whipped banana and powered sugar, for the top.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled the recipe so I'd have plenty to share.  I substituted 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of the required amount of sour milk and only used a little over the half of the sugar the recipe calls for.  The ripe bananas have a very high sugar content already so I felt it would have been overkill.

Extremely  ripe bananas ,  1 Cup of chopped Pecans.
This cake is so moist and the taste just gets better each day after yes, it does stay so moist. Love it.  
This cake tastes like my grandmothers banana cake that she made all the time.  I wish I could get her burnt butter frosting right.

I had 2 super ripe bananas I had to use up and I wanted to bake something light and fluffy and airy. I found this recipe and it was exactly what I had hoped. It was light and soft and fluffy and moist and so delicous. I used a tip that someone else mentioned for sour milk, which was 2 Tbsp of vinegar and adding whole milk in till it reached 1 C and then used 3/4 cup for the recipe. I also added a tsp of cinnamon.

Must. Keep. This! Wow, moist, not so sweet...just absolutely perfect. I substituted sour milk with buttermilk. I added half recipe of frosting I found from other recipe (White Texas Sheet Cake). I had only 1/3 cup of chopped pecans on hand which I added.  This is going to be hard to eat just ONE piece.  I baked in clear glass 9x13 pan which I reduced the oven temperature to 325 for 40 minutes to prevent excessive browning on bottom.

Great simple recipe.  This Banana Cake 11 is moist and light  ... and not like  Banana Bread.   I made the sour milk  ( 2tbsp vinegar  and milk to make one cup)   I followed the recipe except when mixing I alternated the dry ingredients with the milk, then added the ( 3 very ripe) bananas.  Also, I baked in a 9 x 13 pan  at 325 for  50 min.  I made cream cheese frosting... 8 oz room temp cream cheese and 4 tbsp of butter, add 3 1/2 c powdered sugar and 1 tbsp of milk.  Thank you!

I followed this recipe and it was awesome. the only changes  I made was using  butter and oil together. Additionally, I used 15ml of vinegar to sour my 1 cup of fresh milk. I ended up  with a very delicious moist cake.

The cake I produces was delicious. Here are the modifications I made. 
1. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup
2.  I split two layers into four thinner layers
3. I filled between each layer with a less sugar crushed pineapple cream cheese frosting, and sprinkled  chopped toasted pecan over each layer and over the top.
4. The top and sides frosting had no pineapple, just the nut sprinkle.

I added chopped pecans and chopped candied papaya, and with a bit of extra banana this cake is super moist!  You can partly substitute brown or yellow sugar for a sweeter flavour, and add cinnamon or nutmeg for extra spice.  I made a cream cheese maple frosting, but a coconut frosting would be great too.

LOVE this recipe!! When our bananas start to turn brown and no one wants to eat it, I'll use this recipe so they don't go to waste! I also use 1 tsp of vinegar and 1 cup of milk as an alternative to the sour milk. =D

I'm a 15 year old that cooks for a family of ten. And I saw this recipe and decided to try it cause we had an excess of bananas getting rotten. Instead of using a frosting I used a can of sweetened condensed milk and drizzled it over the cake. Then put it in the fridge for a couple hours to chill it. It makes it very moist and very delicious!!

I have tried many recipes to make cakes from scratch. Most are disappointing being dry or tastless. This recipe turned out extremely moist and delicious.  It was a definite success and is one of my favorites.

Gotta say... Perfect for 1/2 sheet cake pan.  A little goes a long way with this recipe. Thick batter, which is tricky with a hand mixer, but what a fabulous recipe!  I'd lost mine, but this was just what I needed to find. My friends will be happy! Thank you :)

This was a delicious cake! We made a chocolate glaze to go on top. Right after cooling it was very fluffy and light and then once refrigerated it was a bit more dense and we loved it both ways!

I love this recipe, as is as well as with small tweaks! For the sour milk, I use 1 cup milk and one teaspoon lemon juice, let sit for ten minutes @ room temp. Last time I made it I substituted with half caramel flavoring and half vanilla, the batter was tasty without the bananas and down right yummy after the bananas are added! My entire family loves this cake. We rarely even put icing on, that way it's also good for breakfast. I have decided to make a caramel buttercream to ice it with next time I make this.

I'm definitely NOT a baker and was pretty nervous when I decided to bake this cake. I creamed the butter n sugar first and ulternated between milk n flour. I added the bananas last. The batter was very thick and it seemed doomed to failure. But the end result had me shocked. So light and airy and very moist. Gonna save this recipe. The only thing I'll change is the amount of sugar. The cake in my opinion is too sweet to add frosting and I love frosting

This cake was moist and delicious, and tasted exactly like a banana cake should taste.  I used buttermilk instead of sour cream because our refrigerator is broken (after three years -- don't buy Samsung refrigerators, BTW) and I was trying to use stuff up.  Also, a cup of mashed banana is a lot more than one, it's at least three.  You could even add some cinnamon, nutmeg and clove to make this as a delicious banana spice cake.  Great recipe, can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is fantastic. For the sour milk I added a couple TBLSP of lemon juice to 3/4c milk. Tastes great ! I am high altitude in Denver so I had to cook this cake several more minutes than the two round layer pan time says. Instead of 17 minutes it was more like 25-30minutes. But you can tell when it's really the right time to take it out. For the frosting I made cream cheese frosting with 1/2 ripe banana added in. WONDERFUL. Frosting (1/2c powdered sugar, 1/4c butter, 1tsp vanilla, 1/2 ripe banana, 8oz cream cheese). I was able to put a thin layer between cakes and a thin but full layer of frosting over the entire layered cake. I then sprinkled with a little oatmeal for decoration. YUM.

I've just tried this recipe for the first time and my family loves it. I also added 1 tbsp Cinnamon, but I am lactose intolerant and so is my little girl, so we switched the sour milk for coconut milk and it still has amazing flavor.  The cake was light, fluffy and moist. I frosted it with a banana-whipped frosting,(Duncan Hines Whipped Frosting w/ banana extract).. I cheated.. DELICIOUS! Thanks for the recipe. Instant Family favorite!

This was delicious.  Like a sponge cake!  Mixed the butter and sugar first, then added the other ingredients as per the recipe. Cooked for 35 minutes with parchment.  Frosting was a Cream Cheese Frosting with a overripe banana added.

Came out great.  Be careful not to overbeat it.  Some reviewers said it was dense, more like a banana bread, but mine was perfect.  Maybe they overmixed it.  Also, make sure the eggs are room temperature.

We messed up when making this recipe. My friend threw all of the ingredients into a bowl at once and attacked it with a hand mixer until it resembled batter, then baked it... And it came out PERFECT. Moist and sweet (but not overly sweet), even though the bananas we used probably weren't as ripe as they should have been. Covered it in Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting (also from this site), and everyone who tried it loved it.

I made this last night and everyone (myself included) loved the taste. I'm wondering what I did wrong for it to turn out a bit dense and more like bread than cake. Recipe says to "beat well" but I was afraid the batter could've turned out like glue.  How long do I beat the batter for? Or what else could I do different?  Thanks in advance!

so fluffy and nice to have a CAKE not a bread recipe.  I have tried many MANY recipes to put my spin on and I don't have to really change a thing with this! I love it... I think the type of frosting used will change the flavor of the cake.  I used both cream cheese and a whipped and it gave two completely different delicious outcomes!

I tried this recipe, followed the directions exactly. Mine didn't turn out like cake at all, it didn't rise much and was quite dense. The flavor was terrific but definitely not the texture of a cake. I'm wondering if I did something wrong. Any hints?

This recipe turned out very well. It made 24 standard cupcakes (took about 17 minutes to bake so I question whether or not a round pan would bake that quickly as described).  I paired it with a peanut butter buttercream frosting and the whole family loved it.  

My only complaint is that I was hoping they would turn out a bit fluffier than they did. But then again, bananas are a heavy fruit so I doubt you can get any banana cake made with real bananas to be as light and fluffy as a regular cake. 

All in all a great recipe.

This cake was delicious.  I took it to work and not one crumb was left.  At Alex - your cake was flat.  Check the expiration dates on your baking powder and baking soda.  If it is near expiration or past, you need to throw it away and buy new.  Your cakes will not raise unless these two items are "good".

This cake is really delicious and a great alternative to dense banana bread.  I make it all the time for company.  I never do the freezer part and it always turns out moist.  If I make it the day before, I make the icing but keep it separate and put the icing right before I want to serve it.  That way I can keep the cake out of the fridge, which keeps it soft and moist.  Once it has the icing you should refrigerate it, and the cake gets harder after that, definitely not as good.  I also sprinkle it with chopped pecans.  If you have friends who don't like icing, sprinkle chopped walnuts on the batter before baking and they will bake right into the top, then sprinkle with some powdered sugar.

Absolutely melt in your mouth cake! So rich and delicious! I used milk and plain yogurt since I did not have sour milk on hand. And used 2 tsp vanilla essence since I didn't have extract. Baked it in 2 loaf tins. Best banana cake I've tasted and made!

I used half and half with lemon juice I didn't have buttermilk. Also used KA cake flour and 3 ripe bananas. Best banana anything I've had.Didn't frost it, I ate 2 big pieces as soon as it cooled. Cut a piece for my wife and gave rest to my daughter,or it wouldn't have stood a chance of lasting 8 hrs. around me.It's going to be my go too cake. 6 stars.

Just bake this today and how should I put this. This cake is an almost perfect banana cake! It's dense yet so moist. But I substitute half of 3/4 butter with canola oil and it turned out perfect! I'm satisfied with it ;) thank you for the recipe! I would recommend this recipe to anyone :)

very tasty, like another reviewer I too had a problem with it rising so it was a little dense rather then a fluffy cake but it still was very tasty.  I believe the reason mine did not rise is it was the first thing I made with my new KitchenAid and I think I over mixed it too easy to do with new gagets.  I will definately make this again. Thanx for the recipe.

I am laughing because other reviews said this cake was light.  I must have done something wrong because, although the cake was moist, it was quite dense.  The joke is, my son and daughter-in-law loved it because it was dense!.  They have a favorite (expensive) bakery that makes very dense  cakes and that is why they like it so well. Now, if I make it again, they will be disappointed if it turns out light.  Lol.  In any case, they want me to keep making this cake.  I did make sour milk with vinegar.  Maybe that had something to do with the problem or sucess.  I guess I will find out when I make it again.  The flavor was excellent.

I am a pretty novice baker, but gave this recipe my best shot, and my goodness, did it ever work out well.  Very moist, but not the same consistency as banana bread, which I was very pleased about.  Made the same substitutions as another reviewer, subbing in sour cream and milk for the sour milk.  Amazing! Don't be thrown off when you mix the dry with most of the wet ingredients - it will be very thick like a dough -   and make sure not to over mix - once you add the mashed bananas and remaining liquids, it turns into a nice cake batter.  Brought the cake to an evening class and people were taking seconds they liked it so much!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very delicious.  I used half white whole wheat flour & half regular flour.  I poked holes with a fork and then poured a powdered sugar and water icing over the cake...it made it very moist.

Absolutely PERFECT! I've tried another recipe that called for almost a cup more sugar and it was waaaaay to sweet. Started looking for another recipe that called for less sugar and found this one. I made it as per directed and also took your advice on making the frosting with a banana. IT WAS PERFECT! The best banana cake hands down. Thank you so much, this recipe is a keeper!

I love the texture of this cake.  It is moist and light with a subtle banana flavor.  I used cake flour in place of the all-purpose and buttermilk for the sour milk.  Really delicious.  We enjoyed it without the frosting.

This cake turned out fabulous! Make sure your bananas are nice and soft and I even added a bit more the second time I made it.  To  make it a totally different cake out of one recipe I added a cup of coconut to the recipe and then made Cream cheese frosting with Coconut added! YUMMY..this is a very versatile cake.  I bake a lot and this one works!

This cake rocks!  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup unsweetend applesauce, and 3/4 cup of nonfat buttermilk instead of sour milk(it's the same thing).  Topped with a light whipped cream cheese frosting.  The banana is not too overpowering just right!

This was a very moist cake.  My husband really liked it, especially how moist it was. Our two young grandchildren said 'Delicious'. Our grandson wanted to take it home with him when his mom came to pick him and his sister up. My daughter tried it and said it was good and she does not like banana cake. I reduced both the salt and soda amounts and used chocolate frosting on top as I did not have cream cheese. This is definitely a keeper!

Wow. I thought this was a very moist cake. I used the vinegar tip to make the sour milk and opps and put it all in, instea of just a 3/4 cup. I was a bit shy on the banana so I added some homemade cinnamon applesauce and I put about a spoonfull extra to help with the sour milk. It turned out great. All the boys in hubbies shop loved it.

Very moist and flavorful cake. I don't care for banana flavoring but I loved this cake. Did not need any icing but am going to try it with a fuit compote that I made tonight. I think any warm fruit would be nice with this. Thanks for the recipe!

I used this as a base for a "Banana Pudding" cake I made. It turned out great. I did separate my eggs and folded my whipped egg whites last though

I have made this 3 times now.  I've never measured the bananas, just always use 3 very ripe large ones.  It is amazing.  We don't even bother frosting it.

Unbelievable.....mine looked just like the foto light fluffy cake, there was more than enough frosting from the "cream cheese frosting 11" after I halved the recipe. I also added walnut pieces to top the cake. Yummy yummy!!

What a delicious cake! It seemed as though it had a cake mix base.. it was so moist and soft! I am going to make this again! I added chocolate chips and made a glaze by thinning out some leftover readymade cream cheese frosting and poured it over the warm cake. Yummm!!

This cake was amazing. I baked two 9 inch pans, which took A LOT longer than the recommended time, but that was no big deal, since I just gauged the doneness by toothpick. It tasted similar to banana bread, only bit sweeter and with a fluffier texture. :) Great recipe!

This moist cake was awesome..I took it to my nephews for after supper dessert. He called me the next day and asked me if he paid me, would I make him one. Of course I took him that I would make him one anytime he wanted me too and he wouldn't pay me. Had to chuckle a bit...I made no chnges in the recipe.

I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup chopped walnuts to this banana cake recipe. I also used sour cream instead of the sour milk called for in the original recipe. Decorated it with Cream Cheese frosting to which I added 3/4 cup melted chocolate chips. It was a very light and fluffy cake.

Just made this for a birthday request. Good cake overall. I used 1 c milk, and only 1 cup of sugar, half being brown sugar to add more flavor. I feel like the cake was a little less fluffy than I wouldve liked, maybe add 1 1/4 c milk next time? Or skip sifting the flour? Either way, made a cream cheese frosting with 1 container cream cheese, 1 tbsp vanilla bean paste, 1/2 c powdered sugar and 1 c heavy cream. very delicious! Topped it all with coconut shredded and pecan pieces.

Kind of reminded me of banana bread.  Not so cakey.  I might try cake flour next time.  The flavor was great though.  I used cream chesse frosting with it.  I think next time it will be good with a vanilla frosting or glaze.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I love the cake but give it 4.5 stars. Texture was between banana bread and cake. (maybe 4 bananas were too much for the texture). I also cooked it in a 9x13 inch for about 35-40 min (still wondering if it was properly cooked). Just love the cake.

These turned out pretty well.  The taste was great.  The texture was somewhere between cake and banana bread.  I may have added a little too much banana, but I wanted to make sure the flavor was there.  I halved the recipe and made them into cupcakes.  This may work out better in a pan that has been greased/floured because they really stick to the paper cupcake liners when you unwrap to eat them. Overall, delicious but not as light as a regular cake.

I made this cake for father's day today, and my dad absolutely loved it. Taking advice from other reviews, I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup milk in place of the sour milk. I also added (at least) a teaspoon of cinnamon, and a cup of raisins. In a 13 x 9 pan, it took about 32 minutes for the center to be completely set. I was planning to frost the cake, but it was eaten before the cake could reach room tempurature! It was great and is definitely going in my recipe box.

Very moist. I didn't frost this cake. Yummy just plain from the oven. I did use sour cream and milk instead of the sour milk. My family woofed this down and I will make this cake again as soon as I get some over ripe bananas.

It was tasty, but I, too, didn't get light and fluffy - even double checked the recipe when the batter volume was so big and only 1 tsp baking powder - oh well, coupled with the soupy banana butter icing - it was an embarassment to me (I'm a retired pastry chef) but my son's college friends ate it up!

I made this for my son's first birthday and it was amazing!  I used a cream cheese frosting and added a banana to it.  A little chocolate frosting also tastes good (but only as an accent, not the whole cake).  Don't bake up as fluffy as the pic, but still awesome!

I really liked this recipe! Cake was very moist and very tasty! I did add 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and cinnamon to give it an extra kick, as well as 1 cup of walnuts! Next time, I will add chocolate chips!   Made the whipped cream cheese frosting to go along with cake. Will definitely add this to my recipe box!

Awesome banana cake! My 2 boys & my hubby loved this cake with and without a frosting. The only changes I made were to increase the bananas to 2 cups and added 1 Tbs of cinnamon because we adore cinnamon. Thanks for the lovely recipe!

I was so scared that this recipe would turn out more like a banana bread instead of cake, but was I wrong. I made both cupcakes and a sheet cake with this recipe. I have to say I like the cupcakes better. I didn't add any icing becuase of my 1 year old daughter, but no one missed it. The only thing I did different was I added 1/4 cup of half-n-half to make it more smooth. All in all my family loves it!!!

Everyone wanted seconds when I served this cake.  I refrigerated the cake overnight and the next day the texture had toughened up a bit.  I would recommend enjoying it at room temp the first day.

Excellent cake and very moist. Use BUTTERMILK folks in place of the sour milk - which gives a light, spongy texture.  I also added 1.5 teaspoon of vanilla and use 1/2 brown sugar for more depth of flavor.  Its a great cake to eat plain, but I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frostting II from this site.  If you're not using buttermilk, make sure you whip the egg/sugar mixture until it's light in color to incorporate more air into the batter - which creates a wonderful airy rise to the finished product.  I used a 9x13 glass pan, baked for 30 minutes.  Will make again.

This was absolutely delicious!! Nice strong banana flavor. I made a 9"x13" cake, baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, reduced temperature to 325 degrees and baked another 15 minutes. It came out perfect! I used a modified version of the Cream Cheese II recipe on this site (no banana added to frosting), it was the perfect topping. Then sprinkle walnuts or coconut on each individual piece, as desired. My family enjoyed this much better than banana bread.

This banana cake is very cake-y and not bread-y at all.  I made two-thirds of this recipe thinking that it would fit better into an 8 X 8 cake pan.  It turned out to be a nice thick cake.  The recipe was really tasty and delicious.  I added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon powder, and chocolate chips and chopped walnuts which I think made it more tasty.  But next time I will probably make a couple more small adjustments, like using 3 large bananas instead of 2 so it is more banana-ish, and about 30 ml less milk so that the batter is thicker and holds the chocolate chips and walnuts better (this is for two-third recipe).

Very good! This recipe is moist, loaded with banana flavor and easy to make. I made it for church potluck and got lots of compliments. I used regular vanilla frosting, but it would be fine without frosting. Next time, I'm going to use cream cheese frosting- yummy!

Ohhhhhhhh, this was amazing!  Very moist and delicious - the banana flavor very apparent.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/4 c milk instead of sour milk.  Did not need frosting - I had it plain, but my niece tried hers with maple butter (recipe also on this site).  This is now my new banana "bread"!

This was very good, moist and flavorful. I added walnuts because we love the combo of banana and walnut, then frosted with buttercream icing and garnished with more chopped walnuts.

I made this today, it pretty good! Mosit and tasty. However, I made a lot of changes; I replaced sour milk with fat free milk, half of 1.5 cup of white suger with brown suger, and added 1.5 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp ground cinnamon. Besides, I used 1/3 cup of oatmeal and 2 cups of flour instead of 2.5 cups of flour. Therefore, the cake has some texture. I wish I could use more banana, though I can smell and taste banana but I prefer to have more banana.I think I actually made a different banana cake but it's really tasty and the formula and baking time is definitely wonderful!

instead of sour milk use butter milk a cup and a half, i too made the mistake of using sour milk but my family got sick from it so unless you want to make a bad impression or get your kid out of school use BUTTER MILK.

(freeze for 45 min. after baking).

(this cake is super hard to get out of the 9x13 pan mine always breaks into 2.

Absolutely wonderful!  Moist like really good banana bread, but a little lighter, and just fantastic with the Bourbon Cream Cheese frosting.  I will definitely make this again!

Very good cake.  Followed directions exactly and made as a layer cake.  Baked for exactly 20 minutes and the cakes came out perfect and very moist.  (Ovens vary so make sure you watch) Made with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  Thanks

Tasted more like banana bread instead of cake, it was not very light or moist.  The flavor was alright, but could have used a little something else. I served this with a chocolate ganache, and think that was a good pairing, especially for those who want something a little more than "banana-banana".

Good cake that family enjoyed. I added a banana to the cream cheese frosting-I thought it was really good, but my 10 year old asked that I not do that again-she felt it was too much banana.

This is an excellent recipe!  The ingredients are great since I always have them on hand.  The cake was light moist and sweet.  I added 1/2 cup brown sugar to the recipe because I didn't plan on using frosting, and the cake turned out to be just perfect.  Definately and easy cake to make!

Wow is this good!! A huge hit with guests. I also made this without putting the frosting on it to make is less of a dessert and more like bannana bread. You can eat it all day then!! A favorite now in our house instead of bannana bread!  Thank you

I made 24 delicious cupcakes, frosted half with vanilla buttercream and half with cocoa buttercream.  All at the block party loved them!
