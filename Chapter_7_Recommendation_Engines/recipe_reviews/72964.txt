I rated this 5 for taste but it turned out so well because I followed the others' recommendation to only add 1/2 cup milk.  Doing it that way, it turned out PERFECT.  I lightly wet my fingers before working with the dough and did dropped donut holes instead of traditional donuts.  Keep in mind that the holes will about double in size when they expand in the oil!  We topped with cinnamon/sugar, powdered sugar, or chocolate syrup.  Will definitely make these again!

This was an absolutely delicious recipe. I made donut holes and they came out so light and fluffy! At first I was confused about the comments but then I realized that allrecipies actially made a modification to the milk amount and this is why the comments didn't make sense any more. I made this recipe with one little modification, I used cider vinegar instead of white and it came out perfect! Oh and by the way...3/8 cup of milk equals 6 tablespoons of milk. Enjoy!

I think the milk amount should be halved.  This recipe is the one my grandmother, mother, and I have used for years, but mine takes the same amount of milk and vinegar, but DOUBLE the amount of everything else.  Just use half the amount of milk and vinegar listed in this recipe and they will turn out fine.  I have make this "half batch" of about 18 doughnuts many times.

This was the first recipe that has ever made me angry. Even after taking tips from previous reviews, the dough still wasn't rollable. I did 1/2 c milk with 1 tbsp vinegar and added more than a cup of additional flour. After that I let it sit for 20 minutes in the bowl. It was so sticky that rolling it out & cutting it into doughnuts wasn't even an option. I was able to roll them in my hands  to make holes, which worked out just fine. All in all the taste was pretty good(even after adding a lot of extra flour). I would look elsewhere before trying this recipe again.

You can substitute plain yogurt for the milk/vinegar mixture - makes it easier, and they come out tastier (in my opinion).

WOW!!  I used the recipe conversion and made only a 9 serving recipe and it turned out awesome.  We used a 1/4 cup of buttermilk because that is essentially what  the milk and vinegar are.. and we used a small cookie scoop and dropped straight into the oil.  My 3 year old had a blast rolling them in powdered sugar.  oh yeah and once it is converted it calls for a half an egg.. we used egg substitute that I had laying around from my parents visit.  lol.  Worked like a charm.

I made this recipe twice.  First time, to the letter, turned out great, but thought it could use a little more flavor.  Second time I used 1 tsp vanilla instead of 1/2, and added 2 TBSP of vanilla instant pudding mix to the flour mixture.  It added just enough of the flavor I was looking for. Dont diminsh the vinegar, it needs it for the rising power and will not affect the taste if that's what you're worried about. I found that all the listed amount of ingredients made for a very good consistancy of dough. It was just barely sticky, but by the time you add the flour for rolling it is fine. You don't want to overwork the dough with too much flour or it will become tough. try to handle as little as possible. I used a mason jar lid for the cut out and the top of of two liter bottle for the center cut. Perfect!!

This recipe is very simple, quick, and tasty, and makes a perfect basic cake doughnut recipe. The dough doesn't have much flavor on its own, so for myself I would season them with cinnamon, citrus, vanilla, etc. If you roll each doughnut quickly in flour before frying you'll get a nice, crispy exterior.

I loved these, they were light and fluffy and reminded me of when my mother made doughnuts when I was a child.  I agree with alot of other reviews, they needed more dry ingredients or less wet (I simply added more flour until it was at a soft, roll-able texture).  I don't know about going as low as 160 on the oil temp tho, mine worked great at 375, and started cooking slower when the oil cooled down to 350, I would imagine keeping the oil so low (the 160) would make them greasy.  Wish we had powdered sugar to glaze them, but they were good with a sprinkling of granulated sugar and cinnamon.

These were fantastic and super easy! I made a few adjustments, first I used 1/2c whole wheat flour and 1 1/2c white flour, next I did not fry them but baked them for 13 min at 325 and lastly I dipped them in melted butter then cinnamon sugar since I did not have powdered sugar on hand. I would definitely make these again!

5 stars! Awesome! After reading the reviews I doubled the recipe but only used 3 tblspn vinegar, added 1 tsp nutmeg, doubled the vanilla. Fried at 375 deg and coated with cinnamon and sugar. Anyone living in upstate NY: These are like "Freihofer's" but BETTER! The family LOVED them!

I highly recommend being very careful about adding the milk, the recipe simply calls for too much. You want to end up with a very soft but manageable dough, not a paste!

Excellent recipe but I followed the advice of others. I used 1/2 cup milk and added 2TB of apple cider vinegar to it and let set a couple minutes before adding into the dry ingredients. Also make sure you let your doughnuts to sit before frying. I ended up with 9 doughnuts and 9 holes. Perfect amount for my kids  for a special after school snack.

I love this recipe, the taste is great and was exactly what I was looking for. The only changes I made was, I added an extra 1 cup of flour to the dough and it rolled out smoothly. Also, I added 1 teaspoon of ice cold water and it set up quickly. Being I had a house full of kids to feed I did several variations. I did the usual donuts and holes along with whole donuts that I later cut halfway open and put in jelly, cream cheese, and vanilla pudding. They turned out awesome and I will surely be making these again.

Perfect!  If you cut the recipe in half, you can still use the whole egg.  This is a very forgiving recipe, especially if you skip rolling the dough and just drop bits of batter into the hot oil.  That way you don't have to worry about having a sticky mess on your counter when you're finished.

We liked these. The dough was a little sticky, but we just turned the dough out on to a flour-dusted surface, and kneaded in a little more flour to make a soft dough. I think too much flour might have made the final product dry; the soft dough was perfect. We fried in batches, and it only took a few minutes per batch. My 6 year old made the dough, and my 14 year old fried them up.

I thought these were really good, and I liked that I had all of the ingredients. The only modification I made was to use buttermilk instead of the milk/vinegar mixture because I needed to use some up.  The texture was lighter than some of the other ones I've tried.  Thank you for the recipe!

I didn't really care for this recipe that much! It was easy to follow, and everything! But I ended up having to add more flour than the recipe called for, it might have been because of the weather, I'm not sure! But I ended up just following all the steps and adding a 1/2 cup extra of shifted flour, then I rolled out the dough, and used a doughnut cutter, and I just rolled the dough into little balls and deep fried them and coverd them in powder sugar, and it reminded me of a funnel cake, it was delioious though!! :)

My boyfriend got a craving for doughnuts tonight and since it was late and all the local places were closed, I tried this recipe.  I followed it almost exactly (just switching the shortening for the same amount of butter since I don't buy shorting and using soy milk and not adding vinager to it since I wasn't sure how it would react to it) and after getting used to how they cook (they poof up in the oil and if the oil is too hot, get brown on the outside quickly but still are doughy on the inside) I got about 12 that turned out looking like doughnut holes.  I dusted them in powdered sugar and put them on a plate.  I tried one and they are okay, but very cakey, in my opinion.  My boyfriend had about 2 before    "feeling greasy" from eating them.  Maybe I did something wrong, maybe it was because I subbed some of the things in it or maybe this just  wasn't what we were looking for.  I think I'll stick to buying doughnuts if the craving hits (we really aren't big on "junk foods") rather then making them again.

Very good!  I made these as drop holes and then dropped them in a simple glaze.    On the last batch I made, I added a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter.  Great recipie!

I made these donuts this evening, and Boy, were they a huge success in the household!!!  I substituted the vinegar and milk with "buttermilk" I used WHAT THE RECIPE ASKED FOR 3/8 milk and they were soooooooooooo incredibly easy and delicious. Folks around here were eating them by the 3's (big smiles here)  I am copying this recipe over and over and over and keeping it in all my cookbooks.  (Just a bit of advice, when it came to measuring the 3/8 cup of milk my mom told me to measure using the 1/4 cup measure three (3) times -  and again, I can't stop raving about these delicious, mouth-watering donut recipe.  God Bless you and thanks a million!!!!!!!

Fabulous flavor and texture and thank you Allrecipes for correcting the milk ratio; also it was very handy to know that 6 T equals 3/8 C.
An instant favorite in my family. I did however figure out that you have to either roll out the dough and cut it or drop VERY SMALL donut holes into the hot oil, or the centers will not cook through - I later surmised that that is why donuts have holes. I dropped desert spoon sized dollops and ended up with some gooey centers. Pay close attention to oil temperature as well. Because I used a deep skillet and not a deep fryer, 375 was too hot.

Just okay. Dough was a bit bland so I added some almond extract for an extra kick. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 6 tb of milk per the original recipe. Doughnuts came out a little too dense for my liking, and kept bursting as they cooked. I ended up with doughnut flowers rather than holes. I covered mine with cinnamon brown sugar, powdered sugar, and a blackberry cream cheese glaze.  I may try this recipe again, but if it doesn't work the second time, I will be looking for another doughnut recipe.

I did not care for this.  This was my first attempt at doughnuts.  I made again and cut the doughnuts thicker, it came out a little better, however I will try other recipes.  Dough had no flavor and was blah.

I didn't know making donuts was this easy! Used 1/2 cup milk, and added lots of extra flour when rolling out to reduce sticky factor. We used a shot glass to make donut holes. Very good!

This is the BEST doughnut recipe I have ever made. We loved making little doughnut holes with this dough. The only problem I found with the recipe was that it was really sticky when I made it as the recipe states. I ended up adding about a cup of extra flour and it turned out perfectly.

I used only 1/2 cup and milk and the full amount of vinegar. I didn't try to roll them out since my goal this morning was dropped donut holes. This recipe was excellent for that. Once I managed to get my oil the right temp these were wonderful

Great recipe, easy and uses minimal ingredients. The consistency is like a cake style doughnut.  They are quick to make and fry up fast. I made them for my husbands birthday breakfast and he loved them.  No waiting around for the dough to rise etc because there is no yeast. The updated ingredient amounts were perfect, and I used 6 TBL milk (3/8 c) and it came out great.  Make sure to flour your surface and rolling pin well, the dough will seem sticky when first mixed but quickly comes together as you roll it out (assuming you floured your surface).  I will definitely use this recipe again, what is more impressive than homemade doughnuts! Thanks, happy cooking!

I read the other reviews before trying this recipe on my own, i used 1/2 cup of milk and a tbsp. of vinegar and was expecting a 'runny' mixture since the other reviews mentioned that it will take a good amount of flour to get it to a rollable consistency so here's what i did:

1)i dropped a spoonful of dough onto a mound of flour and worked it lightly with my fingertips to get a soft rollable dough and cut out doughtnut holes

2) i dropped spoonfuls of the dough directly into the frying pan

the RESULTS:
 i felt the rollaed doughnuts had a more flourey taste and were slightly dense.

the douhgnuts i made dropping batter directly into the oil were soft and light and tasted like dunkin donuts cake doughnuts BUT i will say that its a lot trickier to fry them by dropping spoonfuls because if the oil is too hot they wont cook compltely from the centre and if the oil isnt hot enough then they will take longer to cook and you'll end up with a really oily doughnut.

so i guess the next time i try this recipe i will try to control the temperature of the oil and droop 1/4 teaspoonfuls at a time to get a bite sized doughnut that's perfectly cooked

This recipe was super easy and held up wonderfully to my allergy substitutions, which were; Ener-G egg replacer for egg and oat milk for the milk. I didn't coat them with sugar soon enough so it didn't stick, but they were delicious anyway!

these are amazing, and following with just adding 1/2 cup of milk, i found i still had to add some flour at the end when kneading a little, they came out great.  We will make them again often, since they won't last long

Needed more flour to make them moldable, and then the finished donut sticks I made were too dense, just not very good. Still worthy for morning coffee, but I'll look for another recipe.

(photo#8) i substituted donut receipe for Phillsberry Buttermilk Biscuits; DEEP fry each in veg oil few minutes, turning til golden-brown all sides (don't overcook them, if they are cooking too fast, lower flame, othewise insides will be sticky); they will be about the size of a lemon, or 3bites; allow to cool on paper towel about 20 minutes before filling.  i found a filling receipe for 'raspberry sauce' as follows: One 12oz bag of frozen raspberries (not in syrup) ½ cup + 3 TB of water ¾ cup white sugar/Splenda 1 TB lemon juice 3 TB cornstarch ¼ cup cold water  Gently simmer the raspberries, water, sugar and lemon juice for 15 minutes, in a small heavy bottomed pan. After 15 minutes, you can push the berries through a sieve if want a seedless filling (I got rid of the seeds).  Bring the strained berries back to a full simmer. Dissolve the cornstarch in the ¼ cup of water and whisk it into the simmering berries. Bring it back to a boil, and simmer for another five minutes. Cool/chill completely. It will thicken as it cools.  i followed this receipe exactly and the Raspberry sauce was slightly tart, absolutel delish!; i would not make any change in the amount of sugar unless you like it sweet-sweet; i cooled the filling overnight, but i think it would be okay if refrigerated an hour or two; i used a pastry bag with the long tip; also; poked side of the donut with tip of a knife where pastry tip inserted to prevent squeezing donut; dust TOPs of donuts with conf. sugar.

I absolutely LOVED these! I had to use Apple cider vinegar but they were AMAZING!!!! The only thing I didnt find accurate on the recipe was the ammount, it said that it would yield 18 servings, and It would, if all 18 people had at least 6!! When I made it, it made 101 donuts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Although, as you can tell by my name, I like to make things small:) so I might have made some of them a little bit smaller than expected:) Anyways, I will definitely make these again!!!!

I really like the homemade donuts my mother-in-law makes.  She couldn't find the recipe so I tried this one.  I thought the oil at 375 degrees was way too high!  I burnt the first few.  I didn't have a donut cutter so I used a cup and medicine cup (to cut out the middle).  Mine were thin, but we like them that way!

If you are used to the usual yeast type donut this is definately a differnt texture, I only gave it three stars because I thought the flavor was lacking, I actually could taste the vinegar in it and that wasn't so plesent, and then it was super sticky and hard to form into any shape. My girls loved then though.

I am a firm beleiver in don't messing with the recipes until you try it first. I have no Idea what went wrong but as for frying them, Mine fell apart and soaked up alot of grease (@375) I thought the dough was alot like a sugar cookie dough so I baked them in the oven @400 worked good and with some frosting was able to use the dough and not throw it out. I'll look else where for a drop doughnut. sorry just didn't work for me.

Everyone else has such good reviews, so I must have done something wrong. I followed the advice of other reviewers and put let milk in, but somehow I ended up making these bland doughnut "cookies". I gave them to the dog, I'll try another recipe.

These are good doughnuts (I make doughnut holes/balls  with this recipe using a teaspoon measure). I've made them a number of times and they have always turned out for me. I think someone has corrected this recipe because my original print out of this recipe had 7/8ths cup milk and now it is 3/8ths cup milk. I also  add 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to get a bit more flavor. My children love these, and I usually freeze the extras (without glaze or sugar). I glaze them after they are defrosted.

The recipe is misleading in that you can't roll the dough out and cut it. I dropped it by spoonfuls into the oil. I didn't care for it much, but my 4 year old.

This is a good, basic doughnut recipe, with the exception that it calls for just a tad too much liquid.  I made it as written except that I used real buttermilk instead of the milk/vinegar substitute, and only put in 1/3 cup.  It rolled out perfectly. (A tip that my mother taught me: when rolling out sweet things use powdered sugar instead of flour, it will add a little sweetness, but won't make your baked good tougher!) I don't have a doughnut cutter, but I used a 3" biscuit cutter and cut out the centers with one of my grandmother's cordial glasses and it worked perfectly.  They fried easily.  I thought they came out a little dense, but tasty. I did make a glaze of 1 C powdered sugar, 1/2 t vanilla and 2 T water to glaze the tops instead of dusting them with powdered sugar, but that's just my personal preference.

It was a snow day at school, to cold to go to the store and the kids were wanting a snack, so I looked up doughnut recipes, found this one, made them and it was so easy and fun to make, the kids loved them, said they were the best they have had in a long time, even my husband who mind you is not a doughnut person loved them told me to save the recipe!! lol

Bland, very little flavor. Dough cooked too fast on the outside and was left doughy in the center. I definitely will not make this again!

We couldn't stop eating these, they were so good!  We did half dipped in powdered sugar and half in a cinnamon/sugar mixture.  The cinnamon/sugar mixture stayed on better, but both were delicious!

This was my first time attempting to make doughnuts.  My son and I liked this recipe.  It was very easy to make, although I did use my kitchen aid which made the dough alot easier to work with.  I fried the doughnuts in an iron pan for about 2 min's, turning once.  I used the glaze recipe from the crispy and creamy doughnuts recipe and it was awesome.  Only alterations for me were using 1/2 cup milk and I used butter instead of shortening!!

I teach Family and Consumer Sciences and today I had 65 high school students make this recipe - and they all did GREAT.  I was a little worried about them using the grease but we didn't have any problems.  We did use a Cooldaddy which made it very easy.  I recommend this recipe to everyone - If 65 high school kids can follow the recipe and enjoy the doughnuts (in 45 minutes including set up and clean up) then you can't fail with this one. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have used about 3 or 4 high rated donut recipes from this site.  My criteria for any recipe is usually 4 stars or higher, but the number of reviews has to exceed 100.  With that said, these turned out better than expected.  They are more of a cake like donut.  I used a name brand flour that states Better For Bread flour on it and used 2 1/2 cups and 6 Tab of Milk and Apple Cider Vinegar vs white.  Those were the only changes I made and oh I lowered skillet temp to 350 as they were burning on the outside at 375.  I give these donuts a 4 if your using the correct type of flour (better for Bread) and increase to 2 1/2 cups.  Be sure to have a well floured surface!  The glaze I used I got from a another donut recipe and it has 1/3 melted butter and 2 cups of confect.sug, 1 1/2 tsp Vanilla and 2-4 Tabs hot water (add water til Thin but not watery).

I actually liked this.  Mine turned out to be more like pancakes than doughnuts. My husband said that they tasted like this fried dough that he used to get back in NY. He liked them, so I guess it was a good thing.  The only different thing I did was drop them into the pan so I guess that's one reason they came out like pancakes..lol. I dusted mine with powered sugar and cinnamon and sugar and they tasted good. I'm not sure if I'll make this again, but it was easy and quick.

I was not satisfied with these doughnuts at all. They were fine right out of the grease, but 1/2 hour later, they were hard and tasteless. Not worth the trouble in my opinion.

If you're considering making these I have to honestly say DON'T! You'll be wasting time and ingredients on something that WILL NOT turn out right AT ALL. The first batch fell completely apart in the fryer, so I tried wetting my fingers with milk in order to reduce the stickiness, doing so for the second batch helped slightly, on the third batch I made the doughnuts bigger and they turned out decent, but the taste was SUPER GREASY and crumbely. Save yourself the effort and go down to your local store and buy a dozen doughnuts.

Very easy. Tasted good over here. I cut the recipe in half and used butter instead of shortening. I cut the dough into 8 pieces and rolled them into circles before frying them in oil on the stove. Then powdered sugar after they cooled.

They are....SUPER EASY... I did cut the milk down to 1/2 C. Made lots of donut holes. I used the dosing cup from a bottle of the kids medicine as my cutter and they puffed up to the perfect size. I will definately make this again!

I only used 1/2 cup of milk and one tablespoon of vinegar per the comments. We made donut holes, 1/2 spoonful seemed about right. Even with only 1/2 cup of milk, the dough was still very sticky. No problem for donut holes. They turned out delicious. I would have rated the recipe five stars, but the need to follow modified directions in the comments results in a lower rating.

As suggested by other reviewers, I cut the amount of milk down to ½ cup and the amount of vinegar down to 1 TBS. I used butter instead of shortening, and I doubled the amount of vanilla. I shaped the dough/batter into little balls instead of donuts, and dropped them in the fryer in batches of nine (but my fryer is a huge 5-litre one!). It made about 26 donut holes, and they were great without icing sugar! The flavor reminded me of cruellers my father used to make when I was a kid, but you need to add more flour until it's almost like pie crust dough. You then roll it out on a floured board to about 1/4" thick, and cut it into little strips (about 1" wide by 4" or 5" long), which you then tie into little knots and twists, whatever shape you desire! Deep-fry until golden and tasty, dust with icing sugar if desired. It's fun for kids to do, and I remember making them with my sibs and father. Thanks for the memories, Stephy. :)

I must admit it was an overall easy recipe however, it was too "loose". About twice the thickness of cake batter,  or really doughy. I had to add at least an extra cup of flour to thicken the batter to make dough. I don't really know if I did something wrong or what. In the end I was able to roll it out, cut it, make holes, and pick up the doughnut cutouts to fry. I also used my deep fryer not a skillet.

Just as I was making this, I discovered that my vanilla extract had gone bad.  I substituted an equal amount of maple syrup after researching possible substitutions online.  I also used buttermilk.  The dough was very tender and puffed up beautifully while frying.  The actual flavor of the donuts though was bland.  I plan on using this recipe again and will follow suggestions on making the dough more flavorful.  I love how simple and easy these were to make.

I made 3 batches of this today,substituted butter for shortening tho. I separated each batch into 2 then I added a bunch of different ingredients. Plain, Cocoa, strawberries and coconut....Awesome !!! Yummy too :)This is a great base if you want either plain or get creative. Oh and I used the deep fryer. 375 degrees for about 2 mins,then flipped over for 1 more min.

I used the 1/2 cup of milk like others suggested and the end result of this mess is a glob of so called batter! The recipe is a farce because you cant roll it LOL I tried adding more flour and that just made it to sticky to handle. You couldnt even drop it in to the deep fryer because it sticks to you.

I could not roll the dough and the texture was more crumbly than I expected. I used the 1/2 cup milk and added a few drops of almond extract. The result was edible but not near OMG I want more.

These doughnuts were awesome. I did add a little extra milk, about 1/3 cup more. I glazed half with a homemade chocolate frosting and placed them in the freezer for 30 minutes and the other half I just coated with powdered sugar. Very impressed with this recipe!

I didn't like this at all but I think it's because I was wanting the yeast donut taste and this isn't it.  More like a cake donut.  I do agree with one other poster that it didn't roll out at all and the donuts were very odd shaped.  Won't be using it again.

Very good recipe! I made it exactly as described and it was perfect. Make sure you have a thermometer to measure oil temperature. The oil was too high at first and the doughnuts were not cooked (liquid) in the middle. If it is too low, the doughnuts cook too long and get crispier. Perfect temperature was between 360 to 375F. Make sure also not too overwork or over mix the dough or it will get hard when fried.  Just mix enough to mix the ingredients together, but no more. Then it will come out perfectly! The 3/8cup (or 6tablespoon) milk works perfectly with the 2T vinegar. No need for substitutions.

Easy to to make, forgiving, have added a daub of sour cream. Made this many times. I frosted them with chocolate icing, sugared them, powdered them.  Today we had 11 inches of snow so I am making these for the crew!

Used coconut oil instead of shortening, and cake flour instead of AP. And 1/2 cup milk 2 Tbsp vinegar and it worked beautifully for dropped doughnut holes! Let them cool a bit then rolled in powdered sugar. All in all a great turnout for my first time making doughnuts. Made about 32 2" doughnut holes.

Didn't love these.  I followed the directions to the letter and they were dry and crumbly, and didn't really taste like anything but fried dough.  They weren't dense enough for cake donuts and weren't light enough for regular donuts.  Maybe next time I'll find a recipe that uses yeast.  I won't make these again.

These turned out great. My son requested doughnuts for his birthday breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly. My son loved them. My daughter thought they were too crispy. Personally I liked the crispy outsides and light fluffy insides.

I would rename this recipe "super easy carnival food". It was good tasting, but definitely not a breakfast food. The yield was pretty decent for my family of 4. I will try it again and maybe use more flour, because the dough was so sticky, i used spooned drops into the oil.

Very tasty, but after making recommended adjustments. the milk was still too much. I had to add alot of flour. I rolled when it was still sticky and those were very light but then when I added more to get the correct consistency it was a bit too tough. I will tweak it though. Its very tasty

I will keep searching for a donut receipe. These were quick and easy, but lacked flavor and were a bit to dry. I did put a 1/2 cup of milk in also, which didn't add and moisture.

Like the other reviewers 1/2 cup of milk was plenty. I also made some without the final dusting of sugar and some with. We found that the doughnuts did not need the final dusting of sugar. They were great without it. Best recipe I have found yet for doughnuts.

These were easy and great. First time making donuts and got the oil a little hot. Next time I'll make sure to get the temp stabilized before I start :)    Did anyone try to add cocoa to make chocolate? I might try that next.

These where out standing and yummy after trying another donuts recipe that had the texture of bagels I was kinda eager to try another.  When I saw the picture on here with the fully look of a cakey donut I was like I must try old fashion cakey donuts are my favorite sure enough I found my favorite donut at last and I can make them and enjoy them with my tea you must definitely try :) they are outstanding.  You can't even taste the white vinegar in them.

These are okay. They taste too much like a biscuit to me...not like a cake donut. We were looking for a cake donut and did not find the taste we were looking for. Thanks for a quick recipe though.

Something seemed wrong to me with this recipe.  I've not made doughnuts from scratch before, but the ratio of 2 Tbsp vinegar to 3/8 cup milk just sounds messed up to me.  Then after I fried the doughnuts, before sprinkling with powdered sugar, I could taste the vinegar.  This recipe just isn't up to par.

I tried this recipe and it was fine until it came to roll it out. I don't think all the flour in the world would have helped. even the non-stick rolling pin had no luck; it stuck to that like tar. i think that from now on i will stick to buying doughnuts from the store.

Made it exactly. Put the powdered sugar on too early and it turned into a sugar sludge. It was wonderful otherwise!

These were very delicious, lighter and fluffier than other recipes I have tried. We shacked with with cin/sug and powdered sugar and left some plain and added raspberry jam onto those. My only complaint was they turned out to be super sticky in the dough stage. I made them into balls and this was a messy process but I shouldn't have even bothered because when I went to put them in the oil, they just fell apart again. Still tasted good, just were in odd shapes. I think being so oddly shaped (Id say they were balls covered in spikes!) did make them extra crunchy which was good. I am not sure where I went wrong, I followed the posted recipe exactly. I was a bit confused about other peoples reviews when they said they halved the milk/vinegar part and then a review from allrecipes.com saying the recipe has been altered. I followed the recipe as posted. I will probably make another recipe next time because they were too messy.

Though a first time donut maker, I cannot give this a better rating.  What a mess.  Did I need less milk as other reviews mentioned?  Was the milk amount right?  I have no idea.  I followed the recipe exactly as listed.  What I do know is this:  I came -->.

I dont know why people rate this so high, I only choose this recipe because of that. I was totally disapointed!  First the dough was terribly runny, after adding so many things to make it possible to actually roll it out. Then when trying to fry them! Disgrace! They were burnt on the outside but not still done in the inside, so I tried many other thigs.  I will try ANOTHER recipe next time and be sure to read ALL the reviews!  This recipe should be rated much much lower maybe 1 star!

Pretty good..Easy to do..definately a cake doughnut. My kids loved them. My oldest son (16yrs) wanted them, found the recipe, we made it together, he did the cuting out. (took the inside of my 1920's aluminum doughnut cutter and made them. He did the rolling in the sugars too.
Happy boys!

The dough was way to moist, the batter (not dough) absorbed tonnes of oil, wasn't even cooked in the center when the outside was crispy. And it was just not a good recipe at all. I followed it to a t! I have a tfal deep frier, and set it on the doughnut setting, so it was not the fryer. It was the recipe.

This was actually good. i tried reading the reviews but got confused, alot of people said to use 1/2 cup milk and then complained that it was sticky. The recipe calls for around 1/3 cup milk, i followed the recipe and it came out perfect.

These doughnuts are awesome!  I used a cookie scoop and dropped them into canola oil.  They were light and fluffy, even after a few of them had set out, they weren't greasy and still very good.  Next time I will be adding a little jelly or cream filling to them.

Decent Flavor, relatively simple to make, but I needed about 4 cups flour instead of 2.  Maybe its he humidity and altitude, but, the came out very tasty.  Still will look for a better cake doughnut, and, I may make these again using a coconut or almond extract.

These are really great.  But please note what everyone is saying - they are  PERFECT with half the vinegar/milk mix.  Will try adding a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and anise for a spicer flavour!

The Doughnuts taste great, but had to double the dry ingredients. The dough was to sicky to be able to handle. After adding additional ingredients. the dough was still a little sticky but manageable. The doughnuts are more like cake doughnuts than raised doughnuts.

This recipe should be called Fairly Easy Funnel Cakes. There was no way to make donuts out of the resulting "batter," but pouring that into the oil did make for pretty tasty funnel cakes.

As a previous rated said, the dough was more of a batter consistency for me, therefore I wasn't able to roll or cut the dough. Thats my only complaint! Very good!

This was fun to try.  I thought I would have a real doughy mixture - something I could actually roll and cut. This is not the case.  I did everything according to the directions, but it didn't work out for me.  However, I was able to drop the liquid dough into the oil and fry them - it was more like funnel cake.  My husband raved over these!  I will make again - even though I wasn't comfortable with the consistency.  Oh, we were eating "doughnuts" in no time - super fast!

I made this using 6tbsp of half and half and 2 TBS apple cider vinegar. I also used 1/2 C Kerry Gold butter and 6 tbsp of coconut oil in place of shortening. I'm going to chill and take out in the AM,  let rest and deep fry in peanut oil. I'll let you know how they turn out but so far a 5 star recipe for me.

The dough turned out way too sticky. I tried giving it a go and rolling it out but it just made a huge mess. The reason I gave it two stars, as opposed to just one, is I was eventually able to fix it by adding a bunch more flour. I will not use this recipe again.

Great job! I used Splenda as we are a diabetic family

No changes were made other than making donut holes instead of regular donuts.  Made a simple glaze, a powder sugar dip and a cinnamon sugar dip as options for topping the donut holes. The children enjoyed them.

I followed the recipe and doubled it to make the servings size doubled up too. It was a soft dough, a little bit sticky, after frying, it was crunchy outside yet soft and chewy inside. I like it however, my family was so used of the soft type of donuts(like in Jco or Dunkin's) so they were kind of ok with it. :-)

Great taste, but the dough is too soft to roll.  I added an additional 1/4 cup of flour, and it changed from a batter  to a nice dough, easy to roll out.  I made doughnuts and doughnut holes, so  my yield was different.  Great easy recipe!

The only changes that I made was that I used apple cider vinegar and they still came out really well... My second time making them I put cake icing instead of powdered sugar on them. This is a good recipe when you want a snack or something sweet right away.

These were super easy and really tasty while warm.  I dusted them with cinnamon sugar, instead of confectioners sugar.   I want to try again when I figure out how to make coconut stick - my husband's favorite doughnut topping.

These were super easy and came out yummy. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar combo on top while they were still warm. I used 6 T. milk with the 2 T. vinegar and let it sit a good 5 min.  before adding it. I did just roll the dough in balls. Very addicting.

This was a delicious recipe!  I have made tried many donut recipes with similar ingredients but this one takes the cake!  Easy and fast to make in comparison to yeast donuts.  Half way through the using the dough we decided diced green apples would be yummy so we mixed them into the remaining dough.  The outside was crispy and inside was fluffy.  My 3 boys and invited the neighbors to come and eat them with us and their mom was in heaven-so good!  The only thing I recommend is to skip donuts and make donut holes.  I didn't want to add more flour to make it a consistency that I could roll out.  I used a 2 Tbsp cookie scoop, and the dough expanded to double in size in the oil.

Really great recipe - I can't  believe how well they came out.  I made a double batch which made a dozen donuts and a few donut holes.

We made a basic glaze (not from this recipe) and then did lots of little variations.  In total we did classic glaze, chocolate glaze, strawberry glaze, maple glaze, sprinkles, cinnamon & sugar, and plain sugar.

I didn't have a donut-shaped cutter, so we used a big and small heart-shaped cookie cutter.  I also didn't have a mixer, so I did it all by hand.  They still came out really good.

Very easy recipe and loads of fun to make with the teens. The dough itself seems a bit lacking in flavor. Next go round I'll add a pinch more salt to balance the sweetness of the heavy sugar/cinnamon I used to coat them with. They came out a tad dry/dense in the center compared with store bought. Not sure how to tweak it for a moister lighter center.

The batter/dough was sticky none rollable, I made donut holes out it, and added vanilla for flavor,  oddly the donut holes turned out really well and floor was good next time I will add 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of 1 teaspoon . Drained them put them in paper bag with mixture of sugar and cinnamon for some, the others cinnamon and Splenda for me, tasted awesome. WILL decrease milk by half as others recommended.

OMG, this recipe is simple and easy.  I also used 1/2 cup of milk as recommended here by others.  Instead of donuts, I made donut holes and just rolled the dough by hand into little balls (they will expand in the oil) and dropped them into the hot oil.  They will cook fast, so watch them carefully.  Others complained of sticky dough, but I just added flour a little at a time and rolled the dough until it had a firm  consistency.  These are simple to make and delicious to eat!  My kind of recipe!  My hubby loved them, so I will make them again in the future!

I multiplied this recipe by 4 and I don't know if that made a difference or not but I sure didn't have the problems others have mentioned. The dough consistency was excellent. I added vanilla and nutmeg for the old fashioned flavor. I always use lard for donuts it seems to have a better after effect and not so much grease absorption. I did do them as donuts in a donut dropper. I would definitely pass this recipe along for anybody trying donuts for the first time!

Followed recipe as stated above. Glad I didn't double it.... it makes a large batch! Don't make them too think or they will brown too quickly and the inside will be raw. Good simple recipe

I also used 1/2 cup of milk. I had a lot of problems keeping the dough together it was so sticky that it was hard keeping them in donut shapes . In the end I used a scraper for the last few ans they were almost round. All in all it was fun and I loved the donuts with a cup  of BABY,S Killer Joe coffee.

OIl Your Hands!!!! ball dough then poke finger in middle to make the donut shape, before putting into the hot pan. This recipe is super sticky, but super tasty and a nice crunch with soft inside.

These were a big hit with the family.  I used apple cider vinegar and substituted coconut oil for the shortening, turned out really good.  Really simple to make and you can have fun with fillings and icing.  I put cheddar cheese curds in some of the donut holes, amazing.

as someone who has a job making mini donuts, i thought this recipe was pretty good. They don't taste the same, but they are quite similar. 
I didn't have any eggs or really much to substitute so i ended up using some miracle whip and water, which still gave it the right consistency and all.
My younger brother loves them and we tossed them in cinnamon  sugar.
Would make again, but my house is very very foggy/smoky/i don't even know from the oil.

I did not like this recipe one bit. I don't know if I did something wrong or if the recipe just isn't my type, but it did not turn out good and the dough just fell apart when I went to fry.

I didn't have enough all-purpose flour on hand but was eager to whip something up. So I am reviewing based on my modification of using 50% all-purpose and 50% white whole wheat flour. While I was preparing to sour the milk I figured "what the heck" and grabbed whole milk farm fresh Kefir I,had on hand instead figuring it's cultured milk and the same concept. I used a scant 1/2 cup and added extra flour on the board before turning out the dough. After frying I coated them in cinnamon-sugar. The family loved them. Great recipe for deciding on a whim to make doughnuts before the sun set on doughnut day. Thank you.

The dough was too sticky. Then I did it again adjusting the milk to 1/2 cup still awful as the other reviews recommended. I couldn't work with the dough. Stuck to everything added more flour to make it manageable, and it after frying they were like little dense hockey doughnuts.

These turned out awesome! We made a few changes. We are a gluten free family, so we substituted gluten free all purpose flour, maple syrup for white sugar, and butter instead of shortening. The butter and maple syrup was amazing together!

Giving this recipe 3 stars because the taste was definitely on point... However the ingredients were way off! I had to add additional flour and I also used powdered buttermilk, in addition to the vinegar/ milk buttermilk, the dough was still not roll-able... I would say this recipe needs nearly four cups of flour or three cups of flour 1 cup of powdered buttermilk for it to be anywhere near rollable! I did not add that much additional flour , and just ended up putting the dough in my oil by dropping it in my clumps! They are ugly as sin but taste very yummy! Basically taste like state fair style funnel cake when dusted with powdered sugar!

This recipe went really well! it went pretty quick and tasted great! I gave this only four stars because I had to add half a cup more flour to the dough then the recipe called for (not including dusting flour).  Also i don't have a doughnut cutter so I had to use a round cookie cutter and just cut out a small hole in the middle. This made it take longer, but again, they tasted great! Don't try to make doughnut holes with this recipe or the outside of your doughnut will burn while the inside is still doughy. My favorite was when i died them in glaze then rolled them in cinnamon and sugar! Yum!

I just made these and the dough was very sticky! I put flour down to roll them and by the time I was done I had added almost an extra half cup of flour and the dough was still sticky, tasted like flour and did not hold their shape. I think if I took the time to do adjustments these could be a good base donut but I do not forsee me taking that time with this recipe.

Great and easy receipt to make!!!  I didn't adjust the milk measurements at all since the posts regarding to much milk was old and I had seen that it has been adjusted on the recipe. I did however double up on the vanilla and added in some cinnamon.  Once the donuts were done I topped them with some cinnamon and white sugar... My kids loved them!!!!!

If your dough turns out too sticky using 3/8 cup of milk, then you probably did not let the vinegar and milk sit together long enough to become thick.  This is a very important step!  My family did not like this recipe because there was little flavor, even with the powdered sugar topping.  Also, be sure you sift the flour or use bread flour.  I think mine turned out a bit heavy because I wasn't careful of this.

I haven't finished them yet but I can say, following the recipe exactly, I got a batter and not a dough. I added a half cup more flour and it's still very wet. I have stuck the bowl in the 'fridge in hopes it will stiffen up enough where I will only have to add a little more flour. I'm not sure what will happen with the rise if I have to add significantly more flour. I wish I had read reviews first and discovered that this is far too much milk for this recipe. :/

The flavor was good but the dough was too loose so I had to add more flour.  I would make again now knowing  to decrease liquid or increase flour.

Oh my gosh! I followed the recipe exactly as it was written (as of 9/2015) and they came out great! The dough was soft and sticky but held together enough to be patted to 1/3", cut and fried. The recipe was easy to follow and came together fast. The donuts were better than I expected: warm, crispy outside, light and cooked, sweet but thankfully not too sweet. I will definitely be making these again!

Followed recipe with 1/2 cup milk recommendations & watched the video.  Dough was SO STICKY, had to add so much flour which resulted in heavy donuts with little flavor.  I will not make these again.

Easy & yummy recipe! I read through lots of reviews first.  Decided to stick with the 3/8C milk (which is 6Tbsp) & the 2C flour which was perfect.  The only thing I changed (again, based on reviews) was I put the temp at 350 and doubled the vanilla (1Tbsp) and added approx 1tsp of Oriental Five Spices (Cinnamon, Anise, Ginger, Nutmeg, & Cloves) for added flavor. Of course, I used tons of confectioner's sugar.  PERFECT!

Made these with my 7-year-old son, who has multiple food allergies. We used (3/8 cup) rice milk and Ener G brand egg substitute. Dough was sticky, but manageable with a little extra flour. We made the doughnuts small, with no center hole. Delicious! (Hard for fried dough to ever be bad, IMHO!)

This recipe is a flavour-success, but an effective failure. The fundamental problem is that in order to roll out the dough and maybe to use a doughnut cutter, the dough has to be a dough and not a batter. This recipe makes a batter.

About a quarter cup of milk is all you'll need, but quickly work on it until you have made a soft dough. Don't add all the liquid until you have it figured. Add a bit more flour if it is too thin. 

You should be able to hand-form a tight circle of dough, if necessary. And remember that it cook to double in thickness and be 2/3rds wider than the original dough circle, with the hole getting bigger. So make your circle pretty tight.

It tastes good.

I tried this recipe, but instead of all that stuffing about with milk and vinegar, I just decided to use plain Greek yoghurt, which delivered the exact result I expected. I also didn't deep fry them, but just fried them like normal in a mixture of butter and oil. I'm going to now bring the few leftovers I have to university and see how my friends like them~

This recipe was awesome! Super crispy on the outside and cakey on the inside. I didn't really know how to calculate the 3/8ths cup thing so i just took my measuring cup and poured between the 1/2 and 1/3 cups line (too lazy for math). I also used coconut oil and instead used butter for shortening. Had to add a little more flour too for rolling it out. Looked like It wasn't going to turn out good but i was super surprised!

They didn't turn out.  The oil was two hot and turned them black after only being in the oil for 30 seconds. Then, when the oil was cool enough, they just didn't taste good.  Ill probably try again another time, but this time is just wasn't worth it.

This recipe wasn't good. It was like a mix between a cake doughnut and a regular doughnut. I could definitely taste the vinegar in it too.

The milk amount seemed odd, so I used the adjusted amount of 1/2 cup, with 1 tsp apple cider vinegar (only vinegar I have),. These are a delicious fried cake doughnut. They come out with a nice golden exterior and a soft cakey inside. The doughnuts have a weak flavor, even though I doubled the vanilla. I made mostly holes and a few free-for donuts, and rolled them in cin/sugar. Overall delicious, and I will continue to play with the flavor.

First time I tried it seemed too gooey so I added flour, therefore they were much too bready. Second time I decided to stick closely to recipe to avoid first failure and found that the dough was simply too gooey to make donuts therefore I had to make shapeless balls instead. Very disappointed.

These were delicious! I made them following the recipe for my first batch, then with changes according to my personal taste the second time.   Following the recipe "as is," leaves the donuts needing a little extra flavor.  So, for my second batch, I added 3/4 t. cinnamon,  1/4 t. Nutmeg, and 1 T. Sugar.  But if you're putting icing on them, the donuts are sweet enough with the sugar the recipe calls for.

This Recipe was great! It was exactly what I needed today! My Father came over and was reminiscing about how his mother used to make homemade doughnuts a lot when she was alive. So I went on a hunt for fast and easy doughnuts! This is Deff. a keeper! we made doughnut holes, and rolled them in sugar and they were gone very quickly! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

What a mess!I'm only giving these a two because my kids are devouring them right now and I didn't have to trash them. I doubled this recipe and followed the advice of the majority of reviewers who used less milk than called for. Even doing this I still had to add WAY more flour and still these were not workable enough to roll out. 

I ended up using a mini cookie scooper and just scooping in the dough into the oil. What I ended up with were puffed up weird biscuit looking things, not the donut holes I was hoping for. I guess that can be expected when I couldn't roll the stuff up into a ball in the first place. 

As far as the taste it was nothing special. We all thought it tasted like a big glob of funnel cake/elephant ear dough. This isn't a bad thing necessarily but it sure wasn't what I was going for.

So I'm going to have to agree with the reviewer who said this recipe actually made them angry. I totally felt the same way when I carefully followed the instructions and measurements and ended up with something almost unusable. I wasn't expecting spectacular donut shop style donuts but I also wasn't expecting funnel cake balls either.

So I say make at your own risk. I double it because having three kids and a husband everything goes quickly. Man do I wish I wouldn't have doubled this recipe.

Can I use butter instead of shortening? Also is there a substitute for white vinegar? Cider vinegar was mentioned in one of the comments, but I don't have that either.

My son may have a milk allergy so we are going milk-free.  He was devastated that donuts in stores have milk.  I used this recipe but substituted water in for the milk.  They turned out just as well as when I had used milk previously.  He is thrilled!

I made this recipe exactly except in stead of rolling and cutting I it used my hands to shape the balls. As the first doughnuts I've made, I had fairly high expectations. The result was very dense and cake-y but it had a sour milk flavor that I was not at all fond of. Next time I would substitute sour cream for the vinegar and milk, because of its smoother taste and texture. I might also add 1/4 cup more sugar to make them a little sweeter.

Awesome! Followed directions for the batter. Then, using WET HANDS, I rolled the batter into little balls to make doughnut holes. I would suggest planning on a couple of test batches to make sure the oil is at the correct temp. Rolled them in powdered sugar and dipped them in raspberry jam - YUM!

Wow, what a fantastic recipe!  Thanks!  We followed the recipe exactly and I don't understand why anyone would add 1/2 cup when it calls for 3/8 (which is less than 1/2, do the math people!) cup of milk and 2 tbsp of vinegar.  Anyways, it was fast, easy and very tasty!  Will definitely make it again.  :)

Very easy to make.  I lessened the water like other reviews suggested and it was not too sticky to roll out.  I used biscuit (round cookie) cutters to cut out the shapes with my 3 year old and had a blast.  I actually liked the donut holes better, because I rolled them out too thin.

If making doughnut holes, be sure to make them small so they won't burn on the outside and stay doughy on the inside. I found they work better as doughnut rings instead of holes.

These were DELICIOUS!!!  I, like others, used 1/2 c. of milk and followed the directions for the rest of the ingredients.  I did have to add some more flour to get the dough to rolling consistency.  Other than that, this recipe was a HUGE hit with our family!!  Thank you!!  Can't wait to make them again and again!!

I agree with the name of this recipe - super easy!  These cake doughnuts were fluffy and light, and tasted wonderful.  My kids couldn't stop eating them (and honestly, neither could I).  I tossed them in a combo of powdered sugar and cinnamon.

This was a pretty good recipe.  The dough was very sticky (I used 3/8 cup of milk, like stated).  I couldn't cut out the donots, so I just rolled them.  The turned out pretty good, but soaked up a lot of oil.

I also changed the milk quantity per suggestions from other reviewers.  I did have to add a little more flour.  I also just made donut holes and they worked great.

These are great and really super easy.  I did what a lot of the previous reviewers said and only used 1/2 cup milk.  I only had white wine vinegar so I used that.  I also substituted 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour to give them a little bit of fiber.  I let my kids get all sticky and roll out the donut holes and they had a blast! We fried them in about 1/2 cup of vegetable oil in a skillet and let them drain on paper towels.  Confectioners sugar, chocolate syrup, and cinnamon sugar were all used for toppings.  A huge hit for a great Saturday morning!

Pretty good recipe. I changed the 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.  And I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg (very good touch!).  They turned out very tasty after my modifications!

I only used half of an egg and the 6 Tbs of milk and had no problems working with the dough with some dusting of flour. Only thing i would change is adding more sugar. The donuts didnt have a lot of flavor but i would say a good base recipe for cake donuts

These donuts were okay.  I didn't have any issues with the ingredients (I used 1/2 cup of milk like everyone insisted on) and the donuts came out alright.  But that's just it... they were alright.  They seemed very labor intensive (standing over the fryer for an hour) for how they taste.  I think I expected a bit more.

I would say these are good, but when you mix the flour, and the vinegar and the milk, make sure that when you switch back and forth the last thing that you do is the flour it'll turn out runny if you do the last thing with the vinegar. And i recommend to do apple cider vinegar do 1 instead of 2tbs or whatever it is, Then do 1/2 cup of milk it will turn out better. these are alright to make pretty easy. too.

My son is allergic to milk and eggs so we used soy milk and egg replacer and they came out very very nice. He was so happy to get donuts. We liked them as holes better than rolled out- I rolled the dough to thin. We'll definitely use this again

The doughnuts had a good taste and they were very light and fluffy. I was not happy with working with the dough as it was very soft and hard to roll.  I will try the drop method next time. I also rolled in sugar instead of powdered sugar.

This recipe was OK in a pinch.  They didn't really taste like doughnuts - however the kids loved them (but anything covered in sugar qualifies for them!) I probably won't make this recipe again.

I didn't think these were very good. They came out dense and more like a fried cookie than a doughnut. The taste isn't too bad but if you want fluffy doughnuts than try something with yeast. I didn't feel like waiting for them to rise so I made these. They are very easy and quick to make so I will give it that much! :-)

These were good. Easy to make. I did not have any problems with the dough. I used 6 tbs of buttermilk and they turned out good. Sort of taste like a thick sugar cookie. Easy though and would be great in a pinch. Covered with cinn/sugar and choc icing as well as a glaze. Thanks for the recipe.

These doughnuts came out really good (I believe 3/8 cup milk is halfway between 1/2 and 1/4 cup if that makes sense)so this recipe did not need as much milk as everyone thinks-hence the all recipes adjustment) but I eyeballed the amount of milk anyway LOL. My family wants these again - and often. Just yummy :)

This was my first time making donuts. I used 1/2c milk and they were still super sticky. They tasted pretty good but I don't think I'll make them again. I'm sure they won't last but a few hours when hubby gets home from work though.

These doughnuts tasted 'off', maybe because of the vinegar.  I used half the milk and still had to double the flour and the dough was still sticky.  If you followed the recipe exactly (minus the vinegar), you would have a really good funnel cake recipe. :-)  I'll just stick to refrigerator biscuits next time. Sorry!

Great tasting donuts, but the measurements are off.  Either double the flour or half the milk.  I ended up dropping spoonfuls into the hot oil, but they really needed to be rolled flat to cook all the way through.  I will look for a more accurate recipe.

I'm sorry, I thought these were pretty awful.  I followed the suggestions and reduced the milk and vinegar.  The dough was still difficult to work with, and they didn't taste very good.  They reminded me of the consistency of hush puppies with powdered sugar on top.  My kids wouldn't eat them.

Should have read reviews first, had to add more flour to make rollable, then they tasted bland. Using canned biscuit dough is much easier and tastier.

I thought this would be fun to do with the kids.  We were disappointed because they are more of a funnel cake, and certainly can't be rolled and cut with a doughnut cutter--more like plopped into fryer with a spoon.

These didn't "rise" at all.  I let them set after cutting them out and they still ended up tasting like fried cake doughnuts. I wouldn't recommend this recipe at all

After living in China for a year, these doughnuts were a real treat.  I only did 1/2 cup of milk as suggessted, and they turned out wonderful!!!  I topped them with chocolate icing and now they are a favorite among my teammates.

Was having quite the craving for some donuts NOW and this did the trick! Like almost everyone else, I cut the milk down to 1/2 cup and they came out perfect! Had just a few drops of vanilla left, so I added a little anise extract which made them really good, too!

This is a great recipe. I did as others and only used 1/2 cup of milk. I think next time i'll add more dry ingredients to make the dough more manageable. It turned out great and we loved it. My girls ate it up. I used powdered sugar and on a few i used a cinnamon and regular sugar mixture. They did not look like storebought donut holes and they were very crispy outside but all in all, still very good. This was my first time making donuts so im very pleased!!

my "doughnuts" came out like little doughblobs, the taste was alright but if the dough was thicker they would have some good  doughnut potential

This Donuts are quick easy, and my husband and daughter loved them. They also have the bonus of being lower in sodium, than most of the donut recipes one usually finds.

I used buttermilk in place of the vinegar and milk combination and added an extra 4 tablespoons of flour. I could not get a dough to form but dropped the mixture by spoonfuls into the oil. I found that the oil did not need to be nearly as hot as called for(I had mine at approximately 160 degrees F) and used small spoonfuls and the end result was very tasty. I made a glaze with powdered sugar, water and vanilla to go on top. Thanks for the recipe, it was very quick and easy.

These are not doughnuts.  They are definitely dough, however.  We took the advice of a few other reviewers and dropped them by tablespoon into the oil.  Unfortunatly, all we found were sour tasting dough balls.  The powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar, and glazes that we used to try and improve the taste did little to help.  Overall, if you are craving doughnuts, I recommend you look elsewhere for a good recipe.
