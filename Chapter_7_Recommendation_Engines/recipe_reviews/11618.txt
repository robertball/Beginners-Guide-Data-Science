Perfect cookie! To the reviewer that gave these a 4 our of 5 star because she wanted a crispier cookier and less cake like... if you have followed the recipe like it said you might have gotten what you wanted.  Brown sugar will make a cookie softer.  Please dont rate a recipe if you change it up and dont like what you did to it.... These cookies are perfect just follow the recipe.

These cookies were very good - definitely something I will make every fall.  I'm cutting back on the butterscotch next time because it made them too sweet and they overpowered the pumpkin taste.  Cooking time was more like 12-14 minutes.  And no, they don't spread, so make sure you like the shape of them going in the oven because that's what they're going to look like when they come out.

Really yummy, soft cookies!  The use of butterscotch morsels sounded strange, but it turned out to add a lot to the cookies.  I used 1-1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of 1 tsp cinnamon, and I had to bake the cookies for 13-14 minutes.  I'll definitely make these again!

Absolutely delicious!  The cookie just melts in your mouth with the buttery taste of the butterscotch chips.  I used 1 c. butterscotch chips and 1/2 c. chocolate chips.  I increased the amount of cinnamon to 2 tsp. and added 1 tsp nutmeg.

This recipe was good except it could have used about twice as much pumpkin! Was hard to taste as it wasn't
that noticable. I used raisins instead of butterscotch
bits.

Superb Recipe- M.J!

I made these cookies for my works annual cookie exchange and they were a total hit!  I made half w/ butterscoth morsals & half w/ the new cinnamon morsals- YUMMM!

I used 100% Pure Pumpkin from Libby. And added a 1/4 teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  The dough is VERY STICKY.  I ended up scooping the dough w/ a spoon & putting it in a sm. bowl filled with cinnamon & suger (mixed) after it is well sugered- you can roll w/o sticking:)  Everyone at work thought by the smell of these cookies that they were cinnamon bunns-I faked them out!  Make sure to SPRAY THE COOKIE SHEET HEAVILY!!!  You will definately be baking for a while 12-16 minutes depending on size of cookies.  **They will look a bit doughy when taking them out- but they are done & ready to eat:P

Hope this helps!  Happy holidays all!

I love these cookies! (Guests loved them, too!) While I am ususally a big fan of crisp cookies, I thought the texture of these cookies was great! Very soft and moist, but not gooey or wet. The butterscotch compliments the pumpkin flavor nicely, but like other reviewers, I cut the butterscotch to somewhere between 3/4 cup and 1 cup, which was perfect. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. I increased the cinnamon just a by using a generously rounded teaspoon and used butter, since I didn't have shortening. 
Overall, a great cookie. I will definitely be making this again.

These cookies turned out ok, but they are super sweet for my taste. I gave them away, and other people thought they tasted ok, but just beware - the butterscotch makes them REALLY sweet!

Yummmmmmmmm!!!!!!  Thanks, these are easy and delicious!  Actually I used white candy chips, because I had them, and I'd guess that was at least as good as butterscotch!  :)

Wow!  I made these just as described but substituted cinnamon chips for the butterscotch - I even special ordered them from a grocery store around here, thinking they'd be just the right touch.  I was right!  Sweet and full of spice, these cookies are perfect for autumn.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  Cooking time for me was 12-14 minutes (12 for one baking sheet, around 14 for two)

P.S. Some of my cookies didn't spread out much at first, but I found that if I flattened them slightly right before putting them in the oven they looked just fine. :)

I must be missing something... are there supposed to be eggs in these cookies? Every time I've made them according to the recipe they've been so airy and haven't spread out or anything -- basically look the same as they went in. Also take a lot longer to bake than is called for (I usually don't have that problem with my oven). Anyway, this recipe sounds good but I'm going to have to play with it or find another one. Disappointing!

A good pumpkin cookie recipe.  These are a very good cookie-like texture (if you follow the recipe) and not at all cake-like, like alot of other pumpkin cookie recipes are.  Only thing is they're a little bland.  I added twice as much cinnamon plus nutmeg, ginger and cloves (or in other words, pumpkin pie spice) and they were much better that way.  Also, mine took 17 minutes to bake to be just a little bit crispy on the edges but soft and chewy in the middle.  Will definately hang on to this recipe.  Thanks!

Really good!  I used butter instead of shortening, and reduced the sugar a tiny amount based on some of the reviews.  I tried seperate batches of butterscotch and dark chocolate chips, and both were great!  Texture of a muffin, light and airy.  Rave reviews at the office!

I wasn't planning on making pumpkin cookies but had some leftover pumpkin and didn't know what to do with it. Well, i'm glad i found this recipe because it was very good. I halved all the ingredients. I didn't have the butterscotch chips so i used white chocolate morsels and some dried cranberries. I eyeballed the amount of these last two ingredients to whatever looked right and they turned out very moist and flavorful. As others said, the dough doesn't spread much but i don't consider that a problem at all.

These are surprisingly delicious and soft! The women at the office just loved them.
I found this recipe when I was looking for a way to use up pumpkin puree on a regular basis (I have to feed a little to my cat every day, but a can always goes bad by the end.)
I also used butter instead of shortening and it worked just fine!

Changed it up a bit! Used butter instead of shortening, and half white sugar and half brown sugar. Also, I substituted the vanilla with pumpkin spice baking emulsion. Turned out pretty good! 

ALSO. 'Teaspoonfuls'? The cookies were tiny and I made twice as many as the recipe predicted. Maybe a typo?

Made it with applesauce to reduce calories and fat, but next time I think I'd try it with the oil because they seemed extra moist and sticky made with the applesauce.

Delicious! I used brown sugar instead of white and nutmeg instead of cinnimon (I'm allergic). Other than that I did everything as the recipe called for and they were delicious! Don't over do the chips or they overpower the pumpkin, but the two flavours compliment each other really well. They have a brownie/cake type texture which is neat. I may try making them as a cupcake next time and ice them with butterscotch icing for something a little different.

These cookies were loaded with butterscotch chips, which I happen to enjoy!  I also added a pinch of cloves to my batch, which I think really gave the flavor some depth; otherwise, I think the butterscotch would have been really overpowering.

This is one of the easiest and best cookie recipes I have ever used.  These cookies turn out so delicious, not too sweet, and the butterscotch chips (which I was worried about at first) really compliment the pumpkin flavor well.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use half white and half brown sugar, and scant 1 c. of the chips.  I would love to try these with cinnamon chips as well... if I could only find some!

These keep beautifully in an airtight container, and are just as moist the next day.

These cookies were great.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to use parchment paper and they didn't stick at all.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of each of the following: nutmeg, ginger and allspice.  They taste like Fall.  I dropped them by teaspoonfuls and they made about 50 cookies.  Cooking time was as suggested at 10 minutes.  I froze some of the batter so I wouldn't have to eat them all at once and will write again if that makes difference when they are baked.

Very good! I used some of the previous suggestions and substituted butter for the shortening, added a little more cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, did one batch with chocolate chips and one with white chocolate, and rolled them all in cinnamon sugar (tablespoon size balls) and baked them for 14-16 minutes. Everyone thought they were delicious, we have a new fall favorite for my family.

I was looking for an eggless pumpkin cookie recipe for Thanksgiving and these did the trick. They were indeed very cake-like, moist, and light. Like others, I used brown sugar instead of white, and halved the butterscotch chips. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg because I am always looking for an excuse to use my favorite spice. 

I have mixed feelings about the butterscotch chips. I really love butterscotch, but definitely feel that the pumpkin played second fiddle here, even with the portion halved. If I wanted to make a super pumpkiny cookie I'd probably skip the butterscotch chips next time.

Oh, and having misread the recipe, I dropped them as tablespoonfuls and they still came out beautifully but had to cook for much longer, closer to 15 minutes. As they didn't spread or rise at all, I couldn't imagine them as teaspoon cookies--it seems they'd be tiny.

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!  I am usually a crunchy cookie person, but this soft cookie is fabulous with all the flavors.  I used 1/2 butterscotch and 1/2 cinnamon chips.  I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  FANTASTIC!  Thank you for this great fall treat.

These are cake like, soft and yummy. Next time I will cut the butterscotch chips in half, there are just too many for our taste.

Amazing cookie! Exactly how I like them! I'm personally not a fan of "cake-like" cookies. This recipe is more "cookie-like" and they still have the pumpkin taste! Thanks for sharing M.J.!

Delicious! I did use only 1 cup of butterscotch chips because I know how overpowering they can be and I baked them for 15-17 minutes.

These were good but didn't have much pumpkin flavor.  The cookie part was a little bland.  I would reccomend adding some nutmeg and clove.

I have made this recipe for two years now and I always get rave reviews!  I always substitute the butterscotch chips for chocolate chips and they are a hit.  Very moist and totally fulfills the holiday pumpkin craving...

We have found a new favorite cookie.  My husband took one bite and told me I should make more so he could take them into work! (He works with a lot of single guys that we feed a lot.)  I did add about 3/4 teaspoon more cinnamon and cut back on the butterscotch chips.  For the first time ever I used fresh pumpkin.  It was so yummy!

great tasting cookie! they're very soft. i took others' suggestions of doubling the cinnamon (definitely do this) and halving the chips (could probably go either way). however, most people said these cookies didn't spread ... mine DEFINITELY did, and they took more like 20 minutes to bake. i omitted the salt by mistake but they came out fine without it.

These were very good!  I hate to bake, so you know they can't be very hard!  I subbed the cinnamon chips for the butterscotch - great combo.  They don't spread so you might tap them down a little before baking.  I made a milk/powdered sugar glaze and drizzled it on - balanced the cinnamon and looked pretty, too.  Thanks for a no egg recipe where the kids can eat the dough!!

these are very good and a great way to use up pumpkin.  Had some fresh pumpkin in the freezer that I used.  Only sub was 1tsp. pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon.  These cookies do not spread so you can get alot on a sheet.  *great cookie if one has an egg allergy or out of eggs.  These produce a soft chewy cookie but aren't 'cakey' due to the lack of egg.  I would up the spice a bit next time, as I really couldn't taste it much and perhaps was overpowered by the butterscotch chips...would maybe cut down on the chips next time to 1 cup, unless one likes alot of chips.  Nice recipe.

This recipe is a good base to use your imagination.  I like the flavor--not too strong--but the fun part is experimenting with add-ins.  I saw others added raisins or choc. chips, so I decided to do white chocolate chips and peacans.  What a yummy combonation.  Have fun with this recipe and get creative!

I used whipped margarine [i.e. blue bonnet/country crock,etc] instead of shortening, whole wheat flour instead of AP, no chips, and they turned out great. even better, made this way they only have 60 calories a piece!

This is a very tasty cookie, especially if you like butterscotch. You should definitely shape the cookies before baking them (as suggested here by others) because they barely change shape at all while baking. The 8-10 minutes suggested baking time is odd. I baked them for about 16-17 minutes and they turned out great.  This is a great Halloween recipe!

Definitely not an ordinary cookie. Doesn't cook like a normal cookie (took about 16 minutes in my oven), and doesn't look like a normal cookie. I would suggest: really do round the cookie balls on the sheet, otherwise the cookies come out very jagged - they don't melt down flat; I agree that pumpkin pie spice would add a bit more zing than just cinnamon; I used the new no-trans-fat shortening (all vegetable) and next time I might try butter flavor; and take the cookies out a bit before you think they are done. They'll continue to set on the sheet out of the oven without burning on the bottom (the butterscotch chips can get hard and candy-like if overcooked). I got 40 very generous sized cookies out of this recipe, but because they are so rich, next time I'm going to go for 80 bite-size balls.

Overall a GREAT cookie, but not exactly what I expected.

Very tasty! They were quite soft though and a bit sticky which made eating them slightly messy. I used butter instead of shortening, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and I added about 1/4 cup extra pumpkin.

A great egg-free recipe. My two-yr-old has an egg allergy and it is always nice to find new recipes for her. She Loved these cookies. They were very moist. It took a little longer to cook these than the recipe said but I used a baking stone. Overall, a great cookie!

Wow!  I really enjoyed these.  I wanted something different and these are great!  Make sure to use 100% solid pumpkin.  My first time I used pumpkin pie in a can and it was awful so do not substitute.  A++++++++++++++

Awesome! I used whole wheat flour (I always do), I used one teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and I used cinnamon chips. I took the advice on the shaping of the cookie prior to baking. They came out perfect! They are soft, cake-like cookies and everyone LOVED them. It seems to me these are Vegan without the cinnamon chips!? Oh, and they took about 16 minutes to bake.

These are really good but I did make a couple of changes. I used coconut oil instead of shortening for a healthier version. It worked out fine and gave it a bit of flavor. Because some of the reviews said it was too sweet, I used 3/4 cup butterscotch chips and 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips. I think it would have been fine with just butterscotch though. I also substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon. Both of my hard to please boys gave them suspicious looks because of the pumpkin but said they were really good.

Made these using chocolate chips (only 1 cup) and they were fabulous! I didn't have a sifter, but they turned out really nice. I imagine had I sifted the dry ingredients, they would've ended up being more cake-like. Everyone loved them and they disappeared very quickly (:

I don't know where you got this but it is my grandmas recipe ;) I have been making this for Thanksgiving and Christmas since I was old enough to bake.  For people thinking these are too sweet or not pumpkin tasting enough, I add a couple teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and cut back or cut out the cinnamon. I also add chopped walnuts with the butterscotch morsels. My favorite cookies ever. Note:  pressed for time, I greased a 9 x 12 glass casserole dish and made these like bars last Christmas and every one loved them.  You just have to change the amount of time in the oven.  I am pretty sure it took at least twenty minutes.  I kept pulling them out and adding five more minutes until a toothpick came out clean in the middle.  Yum!!

awesome cookies.  i replaced butterscotch with cinnamon chips and added pecans.  to die for!  (the swap probably reduced the sweetness as i thought they were not super sweet at all).

These are fantastic cookies, lightly pumpkiny and sweet with a great blend of flavors. The proportions are spot-on; mine made exactly the estimated 3 dozen. I added a little ginger and nutmeg as well, just a dash of each, and I recommend playing around with whatever spices you like in your pumpkin to get it just right for you! I also cut the chips back to 1 cup because as other reviewers have mentioned, butterscotch chips are quite sweet. If you like a very sweet cookie you will probably be fine with the given amount; if you like a little more flavor contrast, 1 cup is perfect. They needed 14 minutes in my oven; your mileage may vary. Just poke them with a toothpick, and if it doesn't come out doughy, they're done. I will be adding these to my fall recipe collection to make every year. Thanks for the great recipe!

I liked it used pumpkin pie mix in a can which is just pumpkin puree and spices-used a stick of butter-1/2cup white sugar-1/2 cup dark brown-a little less cinnamon due to spices in pumpkin pie mix and I used white chocolate chips-also I added a little bit more pumpkin pie mix cuz it was a little dry and was not mixing well-so yeah I like my version of this

Great cookies!  I try to make the recipe as low fat as I can.  I used 1/2 c of applesauce instead of oil, 1 cup of butterscotch chips, one small can of pumpkin and 2 tsp. of cinnamon - these are very good and I will make again!

Wasn't a huge fan of these cookies. The butterscotch didn't meld well in my opinion and they were very cakelike.

Mine came out cakey...Don't know why that happened.  Was expecting something better, more pumpkin-y I guess.  Ok, but don't think I'll use this recipe again.  Thank you though

This is one of my all time favorite recipes! A crowd pleaser for sure! I prefer to use real pumpkin. Canned pumpkin is so sweet and with the butterscotch...It's sweet enough.  That is, of course, if the pumpkins are in season.

Yummy use of leftover pumpkin!  To those of you who thought the butterscotch chips made the cookies too sweet - PUHLEEZE - IT'S A COOKIE!!  It's supposed to be sweet.  You people sure must like bland, dry, boring cookies. This cookie is moist and tasty. I thought that the chips made the cookies better.  Anyway, followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  I thought the recipe did not need tweaking and I was a little skeptical when I there was not an egg.  But I guess the cookie would be to cakey with all that pumpkin AND an egg.

I actually made these cookies for a group of Vegan friends, and without the butterscotch chips they are completely vegan safe. (There's milk in the chips) They were an absolute hit with all the friends and didn't last 30 mins! I don't think i even got to have one- I will have to make them again. The only thing is, I cooked them for about 4 mins longer, and it could have used a little more than 1 Cup of pumpkin.

If I could give these cookies 100 stars, I would!!  They are AMAZING, probably the best cookies I've ever made!!  Only change I did was substitute half the sugar for Splenda, which I always do, and they are DELICIOUS!!!

These are really pretty good. I subbed 1/3 c oil for the 1/2 c shortening without any trouble and used 1 c of butterscotch and 1/2 c chocolate chips with really good results. The cookie is really like and cakey with a nice cinnamon flavor. Something you could definately play around with and add in whatever you'd like.

I added more cinnamon, some nutmeg, and even pumpkin spice after taste testing the dough and the first batch of baked cookies.  Still seemed like they were missing something...we enjoyed them but I may tinker with the recipe next time around.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were DELISH!!!  I even took some to work and they asked for more along with a copy of the recipe.  The only changes I made was cutting the butterscotch chips to 1 cup and adding 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  Great cookie for the fall season. Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm at high-altitude, so I decreased the flour by 1/4 cup and added 3 Tbsp butter -which made cookies less cakey. Agree with other reviews about adding nutmeg and decreasing butterscotch chips to 1 C. I also added pecan chips.  Excellent recipe! These cookies don't stay around long!

We liked these although I did make a couple of changes.  I replaced half of the white sugar with brown sugar and I added pecans and dried cranberries.  I also baked them for about 15 minutes.  I just wish they were a little more crispy and less cake-like.

I used a whole can (15oz) of canned pumpkin, so I'll admit from the start that I may have made a mistake adjusting the recipe. I found the cookie flavor to be very bland and the flavor of the spices (i used half cinnamon and half pumpkin spice) to be too much. not a big fan of the butterscotch either, i think the white chocolate chip idea would have been better.

But they are indeed very moist and soft cookies, which I did like.

I made this recipe because I had left over pumpkin from pumpkin soup and wanted to use the rest up. When I made the first batch of cookies they were pretty bland and all I could taste was the butterscotch (which is not particularly my favorite.) I added some powdered sugar, more cinnamon and 1/4 more pumpkin, my next batch tasted a bit better but it still was not memorable..maybe I did something wrong?

I started off by mixing all dry ingredients and then realized the sugar was supposed to get creamed with the shortening. I also used raisins vs the butterscotch chips.  I should note that I made my cookies a bit bigger and they needed to cook 20 minutes + at 350.  Great treat for the fall!!

These were pretty good.  I slightly altered the recipe so I could use a whole can of pumpkin (15 oz = 1.75 cups if I remember correctly).  I used half shortening and half butter, which worked out pretty well.  I am not crazy about cake-like cookies, so I was hoping the butter would make them a little more chewy, and maybe they were a little more chewy than if I used all shortening, but they were still pretty cake-like.  Overall I liked them.  Tasted like pumpkin bread with butterscotch chips!

These are some of my favorite cookies! I really like that the pumpkin is there, but not overpowering.

I usually add a pinch of nutmeg and substitue chocolate chips for the butterscotch.

This is a really nice cookie recipe.  I used chocolate chips, because my husband and son aren't big fans of butterscotch chips, and the results were very good.  I agree with another reviewer that cinnamon chips would be good in this recipe, also, and will probably try that next time.  I was going to give this recipe 4 stars, but every time I walked by the cookie plate this evening I found myself stuffing another cookie in my mouth, so I decided that they definitely deserved 5 stars.

Yum!  Just took these out of the oven, and yes, they took about 12-14 minutes to bake, but oh, are they good.  Great pumpkin flavor.  I didn't have butterscotch chips so I used semi-sweet chips.  I also used a melon ball scoop, which is about a tablespoon, so maybe that's why they took longer.  The recipe said to grease the cookie sheet, so I sprayed with Pam and had no problem.  Thanks for sharing, M.J!

I was very excited to make these cookies because they're different.  There are two things I would like to say about them.  
First, I would omit the butterscotch morsels.  The cookies were too sweet with them added in.  Just the pumpkin flavor alone is nice, without the sweetness attached.
Second, for some reason, when I put them in the oven, they wouldn't spread while baking; they stayed in large clumps on the cookie sheet.  I'm pretty sure all the measurments were correct.  
Overall, the cookie did taste good, just not great.  I will work on this recipe again, and hopefully in the future, they will come out better.  Thanks M.J..

This is really a wonderful fall recipe! I changed it a little bit - instead of butterscotch, I used caramel/milk chocolate swirls. They look very festive (orange and black for Halloween) and taste good with the pumpkin. Also, because I accidently ran out of pumpkin puree, I used canned pumpkin pie mix as well, which turned out nicely - although maybe not quite as flavorful as I would have thought. Still, if you add a touch more cinnamon, and a dash of ginger and nutmeg, this cookie is a fall must! My brother, who NEVER eats sweets, devoured five of these at one go.

This recipe made a very nice moist cookie that was enjoyed by everyone in my family.  I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of 1 tsp cinnamon and as suggested I rolled the cookies into balls and covered with cinammon sugar.  I sprayed my cookie sheet very well with Pam and didn't have any problems with sticking.  I baked them for 9 minutes. Next time I am going to skip the chips and add nuts instead.  Thanks for the recipe.

Hershey's has created the perfect substitution for this recipe:  CINNAMON CHIPS!  My daughter and I made these and with the chips they were fantastic!  Yes, cooking time was 12 minutes.  I sprayed the heck out of the pans so they didn't stick.  My neighborhood friends all enjoyed eating the cookies as they were FAR TOO DANGEROUS in our home!  I ate 6 after dinner alone... oops!

These may have been the best cookies I have ever made.  I wasn't sure if I sure ball the dough up or not so I just dropped them from a teaspoon and they were fine.  It was hard to tell if they were done.  I cooked them for more like 12 minutes until they were a little brown on the bottom then took them out.   They were absolutely delicious and easy to make!

Yum.  Quite good, chewy and tasty.  I wouldn't say rich, though butterscotch chips aren't exactly light!  Follow the shaping advice; I think the fibre from the pumpkin must make these hold their shape.  I would try butter instead of shortening if I make these again, for flavour.  Followed recipe except used cinnamon (1 tsp), 1/2 tsp nutmeg, shake of ginger.  Be warned, they stick to sheets.

I took the advice of several reviewers and was actually disappointed that these cookies got such a high rating (I give them a 4 with some tweaking and help from other reviewers). I thought they were dry, cake like, unattractive, and not sweet enough to be a cookie! I used the butter flavored shortening, 1 C butterscotch chips, and ½ C Chocolate chips – glad I did, the butterscotch flavor can be overwhelming. As one reviewer suggested I added ½ Tsp of Nutmeg, but I would increase the ground cinnamon to 1 ½ or 2 tsp.  The thing I did on the second batch helped the taste a great deal – I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before putting them in the oven. These cookies do not change their shape from when you drop them on the sheet – so make sure you like how they land! It’s a nice recipe for Halloween -Orange cookie with the orange and brown chips inside.

Not too bad.  Ugly cookie.  Easy.  I used butter crisco.  Tasted too much like crisco.  Next time I would try half crisco and half butter.  These cookies do not spread.  All butter would probably make them spread too much.  I thought there were too many butterscotch chips -- they overpower the flavor of this tender cookie.  I will try it with only 1 cup of chips next time.

These are simply the BEST pumpkin cookies ever!  I'm not usually a fan of shortening cookies, but the pumpkin gives them a really smooth texture.  I've gotten lots of recipe requests for this one.

All the other recipes advertise a fluffy, cake-like cookie, which is exactly the opposite of what I want. I like my cookies gooey and dense. This came out somewhere in between... not like a cake, but fairly light and airy.

I can't comment much on the flavor of this recipe because I changed it up - I used regular chocolate chips and added some allspice, nutmeg, and cloves. Came out delicious with those changes though.

These were a big hit! I used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch, half butter/half shortening and added 1/8 t . of both nutmeg and ground cloves. Cooking time was longer, about 15 minutes. Will make them again.

Did as is no changes.  My husband could not keep his hands out.  Found reason like kill flys to get them.  Was easy as hell and all ingredients on hand.

This recipe is a keeper.  I cut the sugar in half and used Sea Salt and Caramel chips instead of butterscotch.  Really yummy cookies.  Thanks for the recipe.

Substituted 1/2 cup butter for the shortening, used 1/2 cup sugar instead of the full cup, and added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, and ground cloves. The cookies turned out fantastic! My father in law loved them for his birthday. Woohoo!!

I'm new to baking.  Took a little longer to cook then advertised,  11-12 minutes, longer if you make them bigger.They do spread out a little, so don't put them too close together, say an inch apart.
I made according to directions, except left out the chips because I can't stand them.

Little ones loved them.  Nice cookie.  We mixed some cinnamon and sugar together and dipped the cookie in that, after the first panful came out of the oven and we felt they were a bit bland.  the cinnamon an sugar topping was perfect.

I think the cookie dough tasted slightly more amazing than the cookies, but only just slightly. I had to substitute coconut oil for margarine and dark chocolate chips for the butterscotch due to allergies.

The cookie tasted good but I couldn't detect any pumpkin flavor.  Next time I would add more pumpkin and less butterscotch chips.

I liked these a lot and we followed the recipe. I think we'll try a different chip because I'm not a huge huge fan of butterscotch. They were pretty soft too in case anyone is interested in texture.

I will definitely make again but with canned pumpkin--I used fresh and pumpkin pie spice along with cinnamon. I also used the whole bag of chips and I might cut back to what the recipe called for.  They were very rich.

My pumpkin loving kids and I loved these. I took them to a family gathering and everyone there loved them too. I made two batches... one with the butterscotch chips, one with semi sweet chocolate chips. Both were equally delicious. I also chilled the dough overnight.

This is not only a perfect pumpkin cookie but a perfect cookie in general. Every time I make these, they disappear and I'm asked for the recipe. I've been making these for 6 years now and the only thing I've added is 1/2tsp ground ginger and 1/8tsp nutmeg. Bake time 11-13 minutes. Bake on parchment lined airbake pans.

The texture on these was very strange, spongy. Kept baking them longer thinking they weren't done, but were still not cookie-like enough for me. Baked more like 12-14 minutes. Substituted chocolate chips for the butterscotch.

I wanted to make something quickly this morning to take home to my mom, but I hadn't been shopping this week so I was out of eggs, so most of my go-to recipes were out. I found a box of puréed pumpkin in my cabinet (similar to canned pumpkin, but a slightly more liquid texture). So I found this recipe and made a few alterations, and they can out perfect for what I wanted. I'm sure the original recipe is great on its own, but here's what I wanted - something soft and slightly cake-y, not too sugary bc my mom won't eat it then, and a bit of a kick, spice wise. I used 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup dark brown, thus reducing sugar by 1/3 cup. I also used 1 1/2 cup white I bleached all purpose flour, and 1/2 cup light brown all purpose flour (bc I ran out of white...I really need to go shopping). I used slightly more than a half cup of shortening (maybe an extra tablespoon), and slightly more than 1 tsp vanilla. I increased cinnamon by 1/4 tsp, added 1/4 tsp allspice, and 1/8 tsp ground cardamom. (If I didn't mention an ingredient, it's cause I didn't change the measurement from the original recipe). I omitted the butterscotch chips but added 2/3 cup chopped walnuts. I then lined my baking sheets with parchment paper and baked at 350 for exactly 10 minutes. It was perfect - not too sweet, soft, spicy, and pumpkiny! Also, I added chocolate chips to a couple of the cookies for myself, and that was delicious as well!

Sweet bread bites might be more accurate. They are not really cookies but still tasty. Also not very attractive.

Followed recipe but omitted the chips because I didn’t have any. I had to bake mine an extra 3 minutes. I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar over mine before baking. They came out good, a soft type of cookie.

These are soft cookies which will crisp a bit at the edges if you increase the baking time to around 10-12min. I substituted the butterscotch with semi-sweet chocolate chips and halved the sugar because other reviews said it was too sweet. I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin spice and tossed the cooled cookies in a bit of ground cinnamon to make up for decreased amount of sugar.

Taste good, only I used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch. Still turned out well and everyone liked them, I found the pumpkin taste came out more after they cooled and sat for a bit. Good recipe and may make again.

Very good cookie.  I used butter flavored Crisco, and 2 t. cinnamon and 1 t. nutmeg per another review.  Next time, I will use 50/50 shortening butter.

This recipe was delicious! I confess I discovered after starting the recipe that I didn't have shortening so I substituted butter. I was afraid the consistency wouldn't be as good. It wasn't as fluffy as it might have been if I'd been able to use shortening but the flavor was fabulous. My husband doesn't like butterscotch chips - he LOVED this recipe! Thanks for sharing it, MJ!

Doubled the recipe. Used white chip morsels instead of butterscotch. Very good. Had to bake them 15min instead of 8-12 min.  Definitely would make again. Even my non- pumpkin eating husband liked them

A little dry and took longer to cook then I expected. The recipe said 8-10 minutes at 350 but I had to adjust it to 15 minutes at 375 degrees.

I dunno where you got 3 dozen cookies from, the dough is so tacky.. I got 18.. I substituted Pumpkin spice for Cinnamon instead and the flavor came out awesome. Also not many sugar fans in my house so I used Pecans instead made them turn out awesome as well. Thanks for the recipe but I had to mark 3 out of 5 due to amount of cookies I got.

Cakey and moist! I found the cookies delicious, just a tad bit heavy for me. If you're looking for cakey goodness in the form of a cookie you will definitely love this.

Great recipe! I found Hershey's Pumpkin Spice Creamed filled Kiss's marked down the day after Halloween and bought a few bags thinking it would go great with a pumpkin cookie. The only thing different I did to the recipe was left out the butterscotch chips and added just a little more cinnamon. Right out of the oven I placed a Kiss on each cookie. They came out awesome!

Delicious, soft cookie.  I used butter instead of shortening because that's what I had.  Came out great.  I used my own pumpkin puree I made from my garden.  Everybody loved them.

I wanted so much to like this recipe, but I just can't get behind it.  While the texture of the cookies is lovely, they wound up being overly sweet and bland at the same time.  Maybe if I had upped the spice content or used butter instead of shortening?  My three-year-old likes them, but I don't know that I'll make them again.

Yes very nice soft mild cookie but could use a little kick, used my own pumking pie spice in place of cinn and could have used more. All in all will make again and tweek it. Used icecream scoop and flattened raw cookie with floured fork.

My family and friends loved these cookies! I made them for a birthday party, used a small cookie scoop and ended up with 56 cookies! I substituted chocolate chips for the butterscotch (I didn't have any on hand.) and they were delicious.

These cookies are very tasty!  They turned out super moist, sweet, and pumpkiny, just like Mom used to make when I was young.  My personal modifications were to use half white and half brown sugar, the entire can of pumpkin, a couple extra tablespoons of flour, and double the cinnamon with a sprinkle of nutmeg.  I also used half butterscotch and half chocolate chips and they taste fabulous together with the pumpkin.  The cookies did not spread but instead turned out to be perfect little mounds of cakey goodness!

I want to preface this by saying I have a tendency to mess up recipes the first time around.  That being said, I didn't mess this one up!  I needed to make enough for 12 dozen cookies, so I used the calculator provided and got wayyy more than I needed.  Also measured in grams w/ my kitchen scale...I altered it slightly by using butter-flavored shortening, doubling the cinnamon, and using 9 grams of nutmeg.  I used half butterscotch and half white chocolate chips (one bag each) and it came out Perfectly.  Going by the recipe, the flour and the chips had the same weight, so I can understand how that may be overwhelming, but yeah, I can't wait for my family to eat these.  I also rolled the dough in cinnamon/sugar which gave them a uniform shape.  I've already eaten at least six...

I made these for my son's 1st grade class this morning for their Thanksgiving vacation festivities.  
As I see most every other cook out here does (and I've done for years with most of my own cooking), I tweaked the recipe.  In fact I might have to submit my own version of it, with credit of course to this one.
At first I wasn't thrilled with the taste, but as they cooled and I added a "glaze" they tasted better...oh and of course I doubled the cinnamon, added allspice, ginger and nutmeg and omitted the butterscotch morsels, then topped with sprinkles after I glazed them. (see why I'll submit my version? lol).  But these were a perfect starting point for me and the kids gobbled them up like turkeys!!

Yum!  I am very surprised to say that my husband and I loved these.  He usually eats chocolate desserts and little else, but he loved how moist these were.  We took them to a party and everyone liked them.  I made very minor changes.  First I used margarine since that's all I had and used only 1 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 chocolate chips (had to get them in somehow).  Also, I scaled the recipe so that I could use the whole can of pumpkin (mine was 1 1/2 cups).  Also, I had to bake the cookies for 14 minutes.  Super moist and yummy!

These were pretty good.  I had to cook them much longer than 8 min though.  More like 15, until they got pretty dark.  They were a wet otherwise. I still prefer the cookies with frosting, like brown butter.

Wow! I am shocked how these turned out! Me and my two kids *2 and 3* were tired of the same old cookies. So we ran across this one and decided to give it a try. Turned out tastey as could be! I didn't have any butterscotch on hand so I used some choc. I had on hand *semi sweet*. They turned out fab. Next time I will try the butterscotch, sounds good!

Really enjoyed these!!  I substituted butter because I didn't have any shortening, and I also didn't have any butterscotch chips.  They have a great spongy texture.  The kids & I all love them!

Okay, the BEST cookie yet.  My fiance' had 6 at one time, I could barely get them out of the oven before they were all gone!  Love the mix of butterscotch and pumpkin.  I will definitely make this one again and again!

An update...I have been making these for Thanksgiving now every year.  Now I have to make at least 6 dozen cookies.  Everyone loves them.  They get very heavy sitting there so at the end of the night whatever is left gets mashed together like one big cookie.  But we all love it.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown.  I also did alot more cinnamon and then added pumpkin spice and some cloves.  I add the entire bag of butterscotch chips per batch when I make these.  I also have forgotten to add the baking powder and it was just fine.  Still loving these cookies!

I wasn't sure how pumpkin and butterscotch would work together...but, I threw caution to the wind and gave it a whirl. Ya know, it's a great combination.  I thought these cookies were pretty darn tasty. Thus far, this has been the only pumpkin cookie that hasn't been an utter let down.  Not only is flavor great, but these presented very nicely!  I did add chocolate chips to the last half of the batter, which added more kid-appeal (not that they weren't eating them before though..)

A truly excellent recipe.  I have made it many times over, and everyone loves and requests them.  The cookie has a 'cake-like' consistency that sets it apart from your standard chip cookie and the butterscotch morsels add a sweetness to them (and are a good flavor match).  Overall one of my favorite and trusted cookie recipes -- glad to have found it! :)

I made these for Thanksgiving and *tried* to make a few extra for my husband.. my entire family cleaned me out! 

They are the perfect blend of sweetness and spice, and the butterscotch is an extra burst of sweetness. 

I'm a chocolate fiend, so I split the recipe about 25/75 and made a few cookies with chocolate chips instead of butterscotch.

So yummy!  I did a few twists; I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, used butter, brown sugar, and spiced them up with cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. I had some white chocolate chips and use some of both butterscotch and white chocolate. After baking, they were a little delicate, but I found that I could crisp them up by turning the oven off and returning them on cookie sheets to sit in the oven as it cooled.  That seemed to give them a more crispy, less cakey texture. I think these are going to become a family favorite; a great autumn recipe!

These were a hit at work. I also added a little extra cinn. and I had to cook mine for about 11 minutes. Although I like how they taste now, I think next time I will add walnuts or pecans.

So good! I was looking for a pumpkin cookie recipe a few years ago for Thanksgiving for a work potluck. Now anytime cookies are mentioned I get, "are you going to make those pumpkin cookies?" People who don't even like pumpkin or butterscotch love these cookies:)

I chose this recipe assuming that the 'no egg' factor will render it more like pumpkin cookie rather than pumpkin bread or cake. The mixture was too sticky so I had to add an extra 1/2 cup flour and refrigerate for 1/2 hr. The cookies turned out a little TOO chewy, almost inedible. That was wasted time and effort!!

When I made these cookies, I added 1t pumpkin pie spice, eyeballed 1/2t cinnamon, and added 1t milk to the dough. I cut back the butterscotch chips to 3/4c. After 4-5 minutes in the oven, I used the back of a spoon to tap down the tops of each cookie to flatten them slightly since the cookies don’t spread much. Really yummy and great to use up extra pumpkin!!!

They sure lived up to the "moist" title. I was greatful to find an egg-less recipe - as I had run out. I added semisweet choco chips and omitted the butterscotch.  They were good, but not great.  Interesting to note that on the second batch I added a tiny bit of nutmeg to give it a boost.  Bad idea!

thought the cookie was a great jumping off point. i made the first third of the dough as directed adding more pumpkin and about a teaspoon of nutmeg. the second third i added golden and regular raisins. the last third i added the raisins again and coconut as well.

I may be a big cookie scooper, but even after I doubled it, I only got about 3 and a half doz out of this recipe. I used almond extract(out of vanilla!)1 C butterschotch and 1 C chocolate chips. I added allspice, and nutmeg. Nice moist cookie, added a little extra pumpkin. Used splenda instead of sugar, also added pecan peices. Really good cookie with coffee, almost scone like, but sooo moist!

These are absolutely delicious! I used only 1/2 C butterscotch morsels, which was plenty. Great consistency, can't stop eating them! Also added chopped pecans, which were a great addition.

These cookies were good!  They are very moist.  I added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and cloves.  Also, I used the cinnamon chips (and the 1 tsp of cinnamon the recipe called for) and really liked them.  I will make these cookies again.

These cookies were extemely easy and very quick to make.  Nice for fall.  I am only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the recipe calls for too much butterscotch chips.  I would recommend cutting the 1 1/2 cups in half to 3/4 cups.  There are so much chips in the cookie that you can hardly get to the cookie part.  I think the flavor of the butterscotch is very complimentary, however too many  called for.   Also, as other reviewers mentioned, these cookies do not spread out at all.  Once I realized this I squeezed as many on to one sheet as I possible could, because there was no danger of them running together.   I will make again, but with a few alterations.

These cookies are soooooo yummy!!  They have more of a cake like texture and are very moist.  I used 1/2 stick marg and 1/2 tub marg instead of shortening to decrease the trans fats.  I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour to increase fiber.  I used splenda instead of the sugar to reduce the calories.  I also used semi sweet choc instead of butterscotch chips (only 1 cup) What great tasting healthier alternative to a regular choc chip cookie!!

OH MY!!!!  These are a cookie shaped version of the most moist, perfectly spiced muffin!  INCREDIBLE!!  OK, OK  I did make some modifications, I use fresh hubbard squash (cooked) in place of the pumpkin puree.  Hubbard squash is close in texture and taste to a pumpkin, but it's milder and sweeter in flavor.  I used cane sugar (i.e. Sugar in the Raw), instead of that white refined stuff.  I used whole wheat flour instead of that white refined stuff.... AND not listening to the other reviews, I opted for ONLY cinnamon, but I did not meassure.  I "eye-balled" 1 teaspoon (probably more like 1.5 to 2).  Also I did not use butterscotch chips, but only because I did not have any. I did have walnuts, so I doubled the recipe, made 1/2 plain for the kids and 1/2 with walnuts.  We have been devouring them ever since.  THANK YOU for the incredible recipe.  If I could give it more stars I would!!!!

This recipe was perfect for my boyfriend, he doesnt eat chocolate and the ONLY pie he will eat is pumpkin. I made some without the butterscotch chips because I dont really care for them and the cookie was a little tame. It needs some kind of chip added, chocolate, white chocolate, butterscotch.. something to add more flavor.

These cookies were good, but I thought they were way too sweet with the butterscotch chips. I liked that they were different and fall-colored, though. I made some with no chips and added a cinnamon-butter cream frosting.

These cookies were moise, spongy, and just the right hint of sweet. Very Good! I will definately make these again.

These cookies need to be cooked at least 16 minutes. I thought they weren't too tasty

Perfect recipe.  Didn't make any changes including to the time which was 10 minutes in my oven (which was recently calibrated so I know it's correct :)  Used butter flavor crisco and would do so again.  I also used a cookie scoop which saved a lot of time and takes care of the shape issue others mention.  I also did one sheet with cooking spray and one without.  The ones without weren't ruined but the spray did help.

Great recipe for the fall/halloween. I used fresh puree'd pumpkin in this recipe which I think made for a great taste, not too sweet. I also only used about 3/4 cup of butterscotch chip which I think is just enough. Baking time is 15 min. in my oven.

I didn't deviate from the recipe, except for the time in the oven (a couple extra minutes). The texture of the cookies was really nice - sort of a mix between a loaf and a cookie I guess. However, I'm not a big fan of butterscotch so they were way too butterscotch-y for me. And I wish that they tasted MORE like pumpkin. If I make them again, I might add pumpkin pie spice and/or more cinammon (as other reviewers suggested).

not too sweet at all; in fact, it was the not-too-sweet cookie part contrasted with the butterscotch chips that made it good. I'd use more chips next time, even. very nice, a good change from everyday cookies.
