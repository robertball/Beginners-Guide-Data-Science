You can cook this in the oven at high temp (425 degrees for about 25 mins and it turns out great. You don't necessarily have to fry it   I didn't use this recipe exactly, since I found the lamb meat pre-spiced at my local halal meat store. I kept it in the fridge for 1 day and cooked (by baking in a shallow dish lined with foil) the following evening. When served with warmed pita and the traditional yogurt-tahini sauce it is great. My husband loved it!   BTW- the sauce can be made with some freshly chopped mint, about 2 freshly chopped garlic cloves, a couple of tablespoons plain yogurt, 1-2 tablespoons of tahini and a squeeze of fresh lemon.

I made this with lamb stew meat which I threaded onto skewers then marinated in the yog/vinegar etc for about 36 hours. Cooked the kabobs on the Foreman grill which avoided the unappetizing "boiled meat" appearance another reviewer mentioned. Served it in pitas with tomato, onion and a garlicky tzatziki sauce - SO much flavor, and super tender too! Nice recipe. Thanks!

Nice - and easy! My meat was saucier than I wanted it after it had fully cooked, so I did crank it up a bit and reduce some of the liquid. I can see hanging onto a lot of that sauce if I were to serve it over rice. Speaking of which, I really like it that the submitter gives a couple of serving options and lets us know this recipe can be used with beef. Helpful! Thanks for the recipe!

It was very difficult to cook quick on the skillet, because the marinade ended up so watery. The taste was good, but the liquid amounts need some tweaking. Also, mine were very light in color, turned out almost grey rather than brown, not extremely appetizing looking. I wonder where I might have gone wrong...

I have made this recipe several times, and it always turns out perfect! There is extra sauce left from the marinade, which is wonderful because it is soooo good. I serve this over rice alongside tzatsiki, baba ghanoush, hummus, and pita bread. My Iraqi roommate says it isn't anything like the real thing, but everyone loves it anyway.

Won't make this again.  Yes, the lamb turned out tender, but wasn't particularly flavorful.  A waste of a perfectly good boneless leg of lamb.

Probably will not make again.  It did not come out as flavorful for me as I expected, and I had issues with the fat removal, not sure if I got an especially fatty leg.  Lamb fat easily congeals and is rather unpleasant, so definitely something to watch out for.  I would definitely raise the amount of lemon juice when marinating, maybe that would help.

Very good. I let mine marinade for 8 hours (by accident.) Otherwise I followed the recipe as it is and it turned out pretty dang good. The lamb was super tender and the sauce from the marinade was excellent. Great with the pita bread and topped with the tomatoes and onion. I'll have to do this again sometime.

Found this recipe to be really tasty and the lamb was so tender. Marinated overnight and then cooked stove top as directed.
