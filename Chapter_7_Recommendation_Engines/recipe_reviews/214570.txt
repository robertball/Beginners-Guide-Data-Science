Excellent recipe for the advanced palate. The fresh epazote adds an amazing/authentic taste to this dish.  I add a bit more manchego than is called for (about enough to cover the top).  Well worth the extra effort to make!

I liked these more than I thought I would. I added an extra egg to the crepes because they were super thin. I used gluten free flour. The blossoms stay a bit crunchy so you get a lovely texture and a burst of flavor in every bite. The sauce is really creamy and delicious. I didn't use the epazote leaves.
