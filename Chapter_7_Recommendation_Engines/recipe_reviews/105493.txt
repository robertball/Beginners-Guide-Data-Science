I first found this recipe in a "Splenda" booklet, and my family loves it! The sauce is so good that I like to make extra. The Salmon comes out so tender! And the vegetables are a perfect touch. We also make white rice on the side.

This sauce is awesome! It goes great with the salmon. It has tons of flavor, and is very sweet. It balances out the full flavor of the fish. I used minced ginger from a bottle instead of fresh ginger, and I didn't remove it. It freezes well and goes great in stir fry.
