I’ve made this twice and both times have turned out amazing! My husband and children loves these soo much! They just melt in your mouth! I used aluminum foil on my pan so no messy pan to wash. Pecorino Romano cheese is a must! I had some leftover from another recipe from here and glad I tried this meatball recipe. I will never buy frozen meatballs ever again! This deserves more than 5 stars! Thank you for sharing such a simple but amazingly tasty recipe!

My Go to recipe for Italian meatballs. Made it several times with consistent results. Generally, I add some Tuscan seasoning in place of parsley and 1/2 t. Fennel seed. Delightful meatballs and very simple recipe.

We are used to a more firm meatball so my family wasn’t sold on the texture, but the flavour was very good. Thanks for the recipe!

These meatballs were very tasty and easy to make. Everyone liked them.  I didn't have romano cheese though, so I used parmesan and I added some italian seasoning.  I found that some of them fell apart easily.

I made these exactly by the recipe. The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of salt. I baked them for 20 minutes until they were 160 degrees internally. Then I added them to my tomato sauce while the pasta cooked, about 11 minutes. Delicious and very easy to make. My husband really enjoyed these meatballs.

I didn't want dairy, so I used 1 cop bread crumbs instead of adding cheese. Still a 5! So I'm sure with the cheese they'd be over the top!

I cooked 350 F for 20 mins. Rest for few min inside oven. Taste good and texture is fine .  I prefer to use higher heat like 400 F for 15 mins next time.

Easy & fast :) I had to make some changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. The meatballs still worked out great and were tasty. If I had the pecorino, I expect they would have  been extra tasty. I liked that they were a fast recipe and sometime when I have more time I'll try one of the more intricate recipes with long simmer times. Yum!

I doubled the ground beef but kept all the other ingredients the same as we like a beefier and more firm meatball. I put them in my tomato sauce raw and simmered for an hour. A hit with my family, very flavourful.

These turned out great. I added a bit of Worchestershire and used parmesan cheese.

Excellent recipe for all beef meatballs! We really enjoyed the flavor of these! Very simple ingredients, yet so flavorful and moist. I used Gluten Free plain bread crumbs (Aleia’s brand). I made these to freeze them, but my husband stole extra and I will have to make more to have enough for a future dinner. Can’t wait to try these in a tomato based pasta sauce! Thanks for sharing the recipe, Bren!

My family really liked these meatballs. The meat stays tender and moist. I used fine bread crumbs made from day old bread instead of fresh. Thank you for the recipe.

Used parmesan cheese instead of romano and added 1/4 cup finely chopped onion. Only using ground beef, this was the best recipe I have ever made for meatballs.

Also, cooked them a bit longer because I like meatballs with a little bit of a crust on them.

This will be my go-to for meatballs from now on.
