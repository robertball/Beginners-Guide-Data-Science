My sweetie and i made this recipe for our Valentine's Day dinner and it was DELICIOUS! Rather than roasting the tenderloin, we decided to grill it, so omitted the onions. The orange zest really gives the beef a special flavor, combined with the rosemary.  I will definitely make this again.

By boyrfriend and I both enjoyed the tenderloin and I have requests to make it again!  It was a bit peppery, but that is an easy adjustment to make.  Great flavor, tender mean, excellent recipe.

A wonderful easy recipe. I used dried rosemary and chopped onions. Two lbs of beef cooks in 50 min.

We are not on the south beach diet...but this recipe is awesome.  My husband loved it, I made this for our anniversary. He wants to buy beef tenderlon every time we are at the market. I used one large Vidalia onions instead od pearl onions and still tasted great.

TOP NOTCH recipe!  We used fresh rosemary and shallots from our garden and included the pearl onions - just small enough to add a little extra taste to the meat.  The orange zest shone in this recipe adding an amazing yet not overwhelming taste!  We had this with some sauteed mushrooms and a salad - 100% keeper!

I used NY strip steak because it's substantially cheaper and still good.  We made the rub as directed.  My husband grilled it, first searing them and then cooking a while on the upper rack above a low flame.  Excellent!  I don't like beef much but these tasted fantastic.

Ended up grilling. Doctored up the marinade a little by adding some dijon mustard. Used orange juice instead of orange peel (didn't have any). The flavor wasn't that remarkable but just O.K. I think this would be better if the steaks were marinated for several hours.

This recipe was amazing! I will be serving this at least 3 times a month. The steak came out mouthwatering--my whole family loved it.

Great way to cook steak. It came out very tender.  I liked the orange zest, it came through very delicately. I didn't have the pearl onions so used a brown onion, which tasted fine.  This was very good and everyone really like it.

As a newlywed I am always looking for tasty recipes for beef (since I don't usually eat it but my husband loves it). We omitted the pearl onions and shallots since hubby doesn't like either, and used dried Rosemary instead... and it was delicious!  Really pretty dish too!

I was unimpressed.  For the variety of ingredients, all I could taste was pepper.  I might try it again using less pepper and more of the other ingredients, but I would never make it again with the proportions the recipe gives.

This was good, but now I wished I had not used the pearl onions.  They really didn't add much flavor.  I think next time, I will use a vidallia or white onion.  The orange zest was different, and I think I would prefer lemon or lime.  The meat was extremely moist and tender, though.
