Good recipe!  I used fresh North Carolina shrimp.  I only use fresh local seafood off the NC coast.  Cindy must like frozen seafood from oversees.   Thanks.

Good party dip. Everyone liked it. I changed the cream cheese to a garden veggie cream cheese spread so it was already soft. Used cilantro instead of parsley. And for a awesome splash of color i used red , orange and yellow peppers. Things I would change next time....... more cream cheese and a little less shrimp sauce. Also would add more horseradish to the sauce, This is not " Zesty " at all.  This is a good dip and is easy to throw together.
