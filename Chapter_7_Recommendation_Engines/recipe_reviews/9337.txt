Fairly straight on descent and approach. Nothing hard about this one, however, 2 teaspoons of cracked pepper?? Uhm, perhaps, just let the eater add their own? This works well, and what worked even better (the 2nd batch) was to mix lemon with the orange juice, let stand 15 minutes and then broil. Its a grand recipe and its a terrific starter recipe for the up and coming chef in your family. 

Cheers!

Very good with a mild flavor. I usually bake salmon and this was the first time I tried broiling it.  I did turn the filet over once while broiling because it seemed like it was taking longer to cook through.  Easy and enjoyable. I would make this for people trying salmon for the first time.

I overall liked this recipe. I have never cooked salmon before, and this was a pretty good recipe to start with. I used lemon instead of oranges, because thats what I had on hand and I LOVE lemons anyway, and it turned out great. Dont skip on the vinigar or green onions, they added a great flavor!

Whatever you do, DO NOT put the salmon 4-6 inches from the broiler. I tried making this at my boyfriend's apartment and the salmon caught fire, and as our new neighbors were coming home from work, our fire alarm was going off and smoke was coming out our windows.

But in the end, the recipe was pretty average. It tasted just like regular baked salmon, the citrus really didn't show.. I don't think I would make it again.

This was an easy recipe to follow and my family loved it.  Even my 14 year old daughter, who is a picky eater went back for seconds.  Served with Sauteed Garlic Asparagus and Twice Baked Potatoes (both receipes also from Allrecipes.com)

This was alright, not as flavorful as I would have liked. I did everything the recipe called for but I added lemon juice prior to cooking and put the orange sliced on about 5 minutes prior to the fish being done. I thought the fish was bland... it would be better if some how I could infuse the orange flavor through out the meat instead of just on top.

outstanding! I took the advice of another reviewer adn let the fish marinate in orange juice and lemon juice. Instead of placing it on a broiling rank I kept it in a glass pan and the fish roasted there. A minute before it was done the splash of vingear, flipped the fillets and sprinkled sea salt over them. Divine.  Only used 1 orange, all we had.  Great taste for less calories!

If every bite had an orange round on it, it would be 5 stars.  Next time maybe I'll try more small orange pieces.  Without the chunk of orange, it was still good but nothing special.  I broiled it on the middle rack, by the way, and it still cooked within the indicated time.

I followed recipe to the letter, but just did not get much flavor at all; I think marinating the salmon in juice for up to 30 minutes would definitely improve the flavor.

It was quite tasty, just a little too much pepper for my taste. I actually used tilaplia instead of salmon since I'm allergic to salmon and I loved it.

I thought this was just "okay".  I made as per the recipe except I put the pepper directly on the fish (couldn't bring myself to put pepper on an orange).  It was REALLY easy, and definitely okay to make again, but it was not memorable.

The steps on this seemed out of order. I also thought it could be done just as well with half the oranges. Not bad though, I'd make it again.

Wonderfully easy and flavorful!  Much better than you average salmon recipe! :) And low cal too.  I'm going to try it with balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I think balsamic might give it a little more body.

We both really enjoyed this one.  It is light and fresh, just brings out the flavor of the salmon.  I soaked the orange slices in pineapple juice and lime and poured the left over juice on the salmon with the oranges.  The rest of the meal wasn't ready so I let it sit a few minutes before the last minute of broiling.  I will definitely make this again

This wasn't very good to me. It was a little blad to me. I'm a big salmon lover and looked forward to a new recipe, so needless to say, I was a little disappointed.
