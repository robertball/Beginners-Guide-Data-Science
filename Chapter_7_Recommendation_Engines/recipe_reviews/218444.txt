I grew up with a different version of this recipe and we still enjoy it.  First of all it's much easier to cut the bacon into small pieces before you fry it.  It takes less time and cooks evenly.  I don't toss my onions in the bacon grease, just sprinkle them over the salad before adding the hot dressing.  I only use about 2 Tbsp. of the bacon fat and add about 1/4 apple cider vinegar, ground black pepper and sugar (to taste, we like it pretty sweet).  Heat until the sugar dissolves in the vinegar and bacon fat.  Pour hot mixture over the greens and enjoy.  It's less fat and gives it a little bite from the vinegar although it does add sugar to the mix.  It's delicious.

'Wilted Lettuce" as I know it, has  has been a family favorite for as long as I can remmeber( i'm 46 now).  My grand mother who has now long passed away, could not wait til "leaf Lettuce" was in season to make this, I can still Smell the bacon,onions,vinager.. Every time I make this, it takes me back to her kitchen...Oh how I miss her.. She was a wonderful cook and a wonderful person. How I wished I had written down all her personal recipes! I can't give measurement bc she/we cook my sight and feel, sorry....(Just go with it). A few things she did different....Leaf Lettuce, cut up(schedded by hand)green onions, fry bacon,drain grease keep warm(hot), Mix lettuce,crumbled bacon. green onion,vinegar, salt ,pepper to taste in a bowl. Make sure your bacon grease is very warm(hot) pour over mixture until"wilted". Its kinda like a oil, vinegar spinach salad BUT SO MUCH better. My family moved from West Virgina to Flordia in 1956, So where did the recipe come from I don't know. But I do rememmber my Great Aunts( Grandmothers sisiters) talking about eating this when they were childern in WV, early 1900's. I wished I knew the full history behind this dish, And oh how I miss my gradmother........

Similar to a brussel sprout recipe I found on here a while back but this is just bland. It got considerably better with the addition of salt, pepper & hot sauce.

I grew up in Southern Missouri where we always ate "Wilted" lettuce...had the same ingredients, but you heat the bacon grease to a very hot temperature in the skillet and add about 1/4 cup water with a little sugar and some vinegar to the hot grease, then pour over the lettuce and onion.  The liquid makes it more like a hot bacon salad dressing!  Yummy!

I grew up in Tenn and my grandmother made this all the time.  We ate ours with white bread.  You definitely have to add salt and pepper.  I just cut up the bacon, fry it, and pour directly over the lettuce and onions.  Its so good.

I have made this recipe, but used dandelion greens in the spring before the flower blooms.   After the flower blooms, the greens are bitter.   I got go to the country where there are no dogs and look for the greens.

I also make this salad with the addition of thinly sliced radishes. It was always a spring time "look forward to" salad with fresh, tender green onions, radishes, leaf lettuce and some years we even had our own home grown bacon! Waaaaayy popular long before oil/vinegar became a diet staple.We also called it "wilted lettuce", my parents were originally from Oklahoma where my mother grew up eating "onion sandwiches" which are basically bread with butter on it, green onion (as many as you like, mom had 2 or 3 not cut, per sandwich) and some radish slices. roll up and enjoy.

This is a summer favorite of my family. We all anxiously await the fresh lettuce from the garden to make this once a year treat. I make it a little differently, I don't cook the onion, and only add enough hot grease to lightly coat the lettuce (about 2 tablespoons). I also add a fair amount of salt, my friends, neighbors and family LOVE this!

I am so happy to see this recipe.  I haven't made this in years and had forgotten about it.  I'll never forget the look on my new husband's face (back in the 60's) when I told him what I was cooking for dinner.  He ended up loving it and requesting it often.  I was taught to use leaf lettuce and added just a little vinegar to the dressing along with salt and pepper.  Guess what I'm fixing tonight???

My Mom called it "Wilted Lettuce" also. The only difference in the recipe she made was adding a little vinegar just before pouring it on the lettuce. Yum!

After some tweaking, this recipe turned out great!  It's the kind of thing that is made from tradition, so everyone has their individual likes.  My family called this wilted lettuce (Arkansas).
I made it as my mother did.  I put the lettuce in a bowl and added raw green onion and a little bit of  raw radish, cooked the bacon and let it drain.  With the bacon fat still in the pan I added some apple cider vinegar and a little sugar, and got that real hot.  I poured it over the lettuce and stuff, covered the bowl with the pan (upside down on the bowl), and let it sit a minute.  Afterwards,  I added the crumpled up bacon and stirred.  It ends up being  kind of sweet and sour.  Mom and I used to make a meal out of this - we didn't need anything else.   I've wanted to make this for a long time, but didn't remember how until I saw your recipe, and I thank you for that...

Growing up we just called it lettuce and onions.  Also, we always added vinegar,  I can't imagine eating it without.
