Great, Simple Recipe! Loved the crust-have to admit that I added a touch of cinnamon to it though. Then I cut out the cheesecake with holiday cookie cutters to make shapes! Will make again. Who ate the leftover cheesecake after the shapes were cut out? Anyone who could beat me to them-so, it's a great "reward" for the cook. No waste here.

Easy to make. Drizzled chocolate on top of it. Great if you have limited time but still want to make something homemade.

This is an easy recipe, quick to prepare and *good* as is.  If I were to make again I would make some changes.  First I would use 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs instead of crushing the crackers by hand. (note I reduced the recipe size to 20 servings and this is for that change) I would also add a 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to the filling and a full teaspoon of vanilla.  I reduced the recipe to 20 servings so I could use two- 8oz blocks of cream cheese.  I also used an 8 inch spring form pan. I used up a can of cherry pastry filling for the topping.  Everyone enjoyed the cheesecake but thought it was a little light in flavor.

Very good, and very easy!  Be sure to line the pan with foil BEFORE putting the graham cracker mixture in the bottom of the pan, and be sure to dip knife in hot water before making EACH cut! We used green and red gel to decorate. I did not change the recipe at all.  However, next time, to make things a bit easier, I will buy graham cracker crumbs.  Note that the 10 crackers called for in the recipe makes 1 3/4 cups of crumbs.

This recipe needed a little extra "something".  Maybe ground nuts and cinnamon in the crust.  They were good and fun to decorate.  I baked mine in a pan with nonstick foil overlapping the sides so I could just lift the whole thing out.  Worked great.  Had no trouble getting nice, clean cuts once these were refrigerated, then used my pizza cutter for the squares.  Very neat edges.  Took them to my sister's for Christmas, and they were well received.

These were so simple to make! I wish I would have read the tips on wetting the knife with warm water before cutting into them. Mine were a lot sloppier than I had hoped! My husband loved them and they will work great at our holiday party. Thank you Honey Maid!

Yummy! Was simple to make, but didn't cut as neatly as I would've liked (initially forgot to wet my knife with warm water for ease). Still, so good!

These were very easy to make, tasted great, and provided an afternoon of entertainment for the kidlets.  I grabbed the wrong box and ended up with chocolate grahams which proved a happy accident.  We will make this recipe again, with or without the decorations.

My family loved this recipe.  I used coconut oil in place of butter for the crust.  In addition, lemon favor was added for extra pizzazz.  I will defiantly make this over and over again.   :)

Excellent cheesecake.   It is a very light tasting cheesecake, if there can be such a thing.  Perfect consistency, although I did have one crack in it.   Maybe a hot spot in my oven?   And the crust was excellent.  When I'm not feeling lazy, this is how I always make my crust and it didn't disappoint as usual.

Five stars for ease of prep! I made these for our neighbors' Hanukkah party and they loved them. I crushed and mixed the crumb layer in my food processor. Rinsed the bowl and blade and mixed the cream cheese mixture in the same bowl. I did have a bit of a time cutting these until I started using a knife/cutter heated in hot water. The hot cutters left a nice clean cut. Next time I make these, I think I will add some lemon or lime zest to add a punch of flavor.

These are an easy and fun treat! We decorated ours with cutouts and colored sugar. To make it even easier, you can crush and then mix up the graham cracker crumbs along with the sugar and butter in a ziploc bag.

There's not much I can add to previous reviews. A batch of these went to a neighborhood holiday party and they disappeared in no time. They were easy to prepare and fun to decorate. I can see making these for other holidays too.

I made these for the holidays and my family loved them. This was the first item to be gone.  I also had to share the recipe with several people.  I used my small food procesor for the graham crackers to get them really fine for the crust.  It worked great.

Easy recipe with good flavor, would decorate with something other than gels due to them running together. Cute idea for the holiday dessert table.

I made it exactly according to directions and it turned out perfect!  So simple and so tasty.  Ours was for a graduation reception so we just precut and let people choose their own topping.  Everyone loved them!
