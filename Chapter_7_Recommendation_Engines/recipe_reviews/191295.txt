This is 5 stars for being a lower fat alternative to full-fledged cheesecake.  The real thing is still the best in my opinion!  The level of coffee flavor in this recipe was perfect, and the coffee yogurt on top was surprisingly just the right balance- moist and sweet enough to compliment the rest of it.  I used 7 oz.(half box) of chocolate graham crackers and 7 T butter in the crust.  I couldn't find plain chocolate cookies for sale in our area.  Nor could I find potato starch, so I used Thai tapioca starch, which was just fine.  I wonder how corn starch would have done- anyone?  I accidentally poured all the coffee yogurt into the cake batter and it turned out fine.  I did bake it longer than 70 minutes, but the browning on top disappeared when covered with the coffee yogurt topping.  ;)  When serving, I put the cinnamon shaker on the table where our Easter guests could try it out.  We all decided we preferred it without cinnamon, but I'm not one to mix cinnamon with chocolate.

I used a regular graham cracker crust, then added cocoa.  Because I could not find coffee yogurt, I used the plain yogurt, then added extra instant coffee. This smooth, creamy coffee flavored cheesecake was a hit!
