The recipe has nothing to do with german Fleischkuechle except the use of meat. Fleischkuechle are oval, abou 1 inch thick, have a weight of 2.2 or 4.5 ounces. They are never deep fried but fried in a pan. Besides in Germany we don't use flour for the dough but rolls, two or three days old, soaked in milk or water.

The picture shown is not how fleishkuechle is traditionally made around here (I'm from ND as well). The recipe fails to include the fact that the balls of meat should be pressed flat (think oval-shaped hamburger patties) before the dough is wrapped around them. For the health-conscious, even though it's not "traditional," the fleishkuechle may also be baked. Around here we would NEVER detract from the flavor by adding cheese, but we do love to dip them in ketchup!!

I am from ND too. This is served at many restaurants in ND. Sometimes the dough is made with 1/2 and 1/2 with the milk. Growing up I had these at the local dairy queens/restaurants on my lunch break almost daily!  They are made with chopped onion and water in the blender, then add that to seasoned hamburger for a spreadable meat. Then take a dough ball about the size of a lemon and roll out to a circle just slightly smaller that the size of a plate. Spread meat mixture on 1/2 of the dough, fold over and seal by pinching or with a fork. Prick twice with a fork to let steam escape while deep frying. They are flat, and about the size of 1/2 of a plate, but can be made smaller. If made correctly there is a little grease that makes the inside dough slightly oily. That adds flavor. They freeze very well! No cheese!! ONLY KETCHUP!!! :)
We pronounce it fly(sh)-keek-la.

i live in germany. fleischk√ºchle (buletten, fleischpflanzerl) aren't made with that much flour. in germany we use old buns or white bread soaked a few minutes in milk for that. that gives it a softer texture. if the meat mixture is to wet, we add breadcrumbs. also mustard is a must for seasoning.

I was actually trying to figure out how to spell this dish, as I made it with a friend this weekend, and stumbled upon the exact recipe we used. I just want to say that it's the most addictive thing I've ever had, this being the third time we've made it. She always makes a macaroni salad with lots of pickles to go with it, and I think it's a nice way to balance the hearty juiciness of the Fleischkuechle.

I know she also got this recipe handed down to her from her German family, so anyone who says it's not "real" because it doesn't use moldy old bread or whatever needs to let me know so I can be sure to call them a waaaambulance. It's THE most delicious thing I've ever had, no matter what you call it.

I as well grew up eating these but I think my mom used day old bread or bread crumbs as well as the diced onions.  She shaped them like patties.  I thought they were strange as a kid but now make them from time to time.  Also the pronounciation here is incorrect should be more like (PHLISCH-KESH-EL-LE)

This is awesome!  My family makes these as a special treat.  I can't believe someone submitted the recipe.  We don't add egg to our dough or onions to the meat, but the rest is the same.  My mom loads it up with garlic and we love them!  My daughters help make them and make small ravioli size ones for bite size portions!

As a cheese lover, I add shredded cheese to the middle of it, but it's got a great flavor as it is.  If you're a bit more adventerous you can also add some cayenne and other spices (I prefer oregano and garlic) as well.  If you're making it for some people the like spice and some that do not, it's easier to place the spices in the dough.  Make the first half without, use 1 egg.  Make a second batch with only 1 egg but add the spices.  Mine have always turned out okay with only 2 eggs total.

My family thought this was okay. I probably won't make it again. I had alot of difficulty manipulating the dough and ended up mixing the beef mixture into the dough. The end result was a beef fritter.

I love trying out old family recipes because they have been around for so long and loved for so many years. But this one seemed to be lacking in  flavor. It definitely required some other seasonings or ingredient in the filling, or maybe the addition of a dipping sauce. My kids didn't like the grease that came from it when they bit into the dumpling. But that may have been due to the fact that I didn't use the very leanest ground beef.
