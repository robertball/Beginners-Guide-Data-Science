This is very similar to the steps I take to make my own tostones, even though my family is Cuban.  I believe the steps do need a little tweaking because as is I think you could burn the tostones.  Ok, if your tostones are not fully submerged in oil, fry for 2-3 minutes on one side then flip to submerge the other half.  You can also use a Fry Daddy and have it all submerged for 3 minutes.  ONCE THEY COOL OFF, THEN you mash them with something with a flat bottom. A mug or a cup will do nicely. Make sure they're cool or it might come out mushy.  I hate to go against tradition but my tostonera is going to waste because it provides a sideways mashing ability and the tostones come out lopsided.  For tostones, also make sure your plaintain is green.  If its got more yellow than green, it might be too soft for this and is best to be held off for platanos maduros once they darken.  Lastly, I know this may sound weird however, I'd say skip the garlic powder and go with real minced garlic from a jar.  Pour it on the tostones with some juice.  Yes, its raw but the plantain kills its pungency and all you taste is yummy goodness. Salt to taste (light sprinkle will do) and you've got a wonderful side dish on your hands!

You can also use the bottom of a can (like a can of beans, or corn) to smash the tostones. Do not let them get brown. Tostones should look golden in color not brown. I like to sprinkle garlic salt on them as soon as they come out of the oil. Another fabulous but easy dipping sauce for tostones is mayoketchup. Mayo and Ketchup on a 1:1 ratio (equal amounts), one clove of garlic pressed for each 1/4-1/2 cup of mix, stir, refrigerate about 30 minutes to let flavors come together... VOILA!

A.Maz.Ing! Made these tostones alongside grilled Jerk chicken and coconut rice, and it brought a little beachy-flair to our dinner table on an otherwise rainy night in Georgia. I followed the recipe, except I used 2 plantains to 1/4 c. veg oil. I smooshed them b/t pieces of wax paper, using a coffee cup. Sprinkled them w/ Adobo w/ Pepper, and these savory treats were gobbled off our plates in record time.

instead of a tostonera or can, I use the plantain skin to smash them.  When removing the skin, make one long incision and remove plantain, then, after initial fry, put the piece back in the skin & smash.

Very simple, yet tasty. Tastes much better homemade than the platanos in the bag! My inlaws from Honduras also make tostones...thanks for the reminder to make some soon!

I just used garlic salt to season them. Turned out awesome! My son enjoyed them with ketchup while my fianc√© topped them with cream cheese. Different, I know, but tasted good!

I selected this recipe because it is a classic Tostones dish. It turned out perfect. Although, I used adobo instead of the garlic powder. But either way they will turn out delicious.
