This made really good pulled pork! So easy to prepare, and put right in the crock pot! The BBQ sauce was good, as was the coleslaw! I usually like a creamy coleslaw so I was little hesitant when I saw this was more of a "vinaigrette" version; but it turned out really good, and complimented the pork well! I will be making this again! Thank you!

I had never had coleslaw in my pulled pork sandwiches and I don't think I will ever again. Or maybe it was because I didn't care for this coleslaw. I left the cucumbers out and I used green cabbage instead of purple. The pulled pork was very good and the Ball Park Buns aside from being delicious stay in one piece.

The pork turned out perfect!  I have enough of that foodsavered to keep for another meal.  We have always used cole slaw with pulled pork sandwiches, but we didn't care for the dressing that came with this recipe.  Next time I will use my old standby recipe for that.  We did like how the Ball Park rolls hold up to the meat in this, and we did like the sauce a lot.  Thanks, Ball Park Buns!

The Pork was amazing and I will make that again! We like the coleslaw better on the side but we tried it both ways.  I added a jalapeno to both the pork and the coleslaw and it added a little zip. We really liked this recipe and loved the Tailgater Buns by BallPark. I had to look around for them but it was worth the search. The Tailgater buns hold up better than  Hamburger bun.

While certainly easy to make, this recipe was not a huge success in our house.  The pork itself was delicious, but no one cared for the slaw.  I will most likely make the pork recipe again, but won't make the slaw.  The Ball Park buns were a perfect compliment to the sandwich.

I wasn't sure if I would like slaw on my pulled pork sandwich. However, the slaw makes the sandwich. Next time, I will leave out the cucumbers. My family wasn't a fan of the cucumbers.
