WONDERFUL ... Used 2lb London Broil. Started the marinade about 11pm.  Created a 'quick' marinade for veggies - 2TBS garlic Olive Oil, some oregano and garlic.  Tossed the veggies for a few minutes before putting on the skewers.  While the Kabobs were grilling, put the left-over Beef Marinade in a small sauce pan and brought it to a slow boil.  Grilled kabobs for only 9mins ... turning every 3mins ... They were juicy!!! Fortunately there was ample left-over meat (cooking for just my husband and I).  After Dinner we grilled the remaining meat to be used later in the week for left-overs. YUMMY!!

AWESOME!!!  These are the best shishkabobs I've ever tasted!  I marinated the beef for a day and a half, and it was soooo tender and flavorful!  As another reviewer suggested, for the veggies, I coated them with olive oil and sprinkled them seasoning salt and garlic salt before putting them on the skewers, and they were excellent! I will make these again and again!

YUMMY! This is a 5 star recipe for sure. I changed it a bit (not that it needed it, but I like to experiment and add my own touches) by substituting half of the lemon lime soda for Squirt citrus soda. I also added a tiny bit of liquid smoke. For the vegetables I used the ones in the recipe but added green zuchini and yellow zuchini. I got green, red and yellow bell peppers instead of just green. These were beautiful !! The tip of softening the peppers a bit prior to grilling worked like a charm. I did this only to the peppers and zuchini. This is the first time ever my boyfriend asked me to PLEASE make something again from all the recipes I have made from this site. Kids loved it too.

Update: I was excited to make this one again. This time I followed the recipe to the letter . This time NO ONE liked it :( including me. The first time I did changes and also didn't marinated it overnight. It was flavorful and tender. Not sure what happened this time. Maybe it was the sirloin cut, or the overnight marinating made the sirloin tough, but i always tought marinade tenderizes. I was not as flavorful as before.

Sensational! This definitely is a slightly sweet marinade that's almost like a teryaki. I used low sodium soy sauce, white wine vinegar, minced garlic vs. garlic powder and since I didn't have garlic pepper seasoning I opted to substitute 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika. I never marinated anything with soda before and this was a nice change from using oils. I put everything into a ziploc bag and marinated the sirloin overnight which I highly recommend. I skewered red and green peppers, red and vidalia onion and cherry tomatoes separate from the meat as they cook at different rates. This smelled great and tasted even better!

We found these kabobs to be scrumptios!  I did have to make a few adjustments, and it was still fine.  First, we had no pop, so I substituted lemonade, and second, I did not find good, fresh pineapple, so we left that out.  However, these did not take away from the wonderful flavor.  (The lemonade we used was the type made from frozen concentrate, not from powdered mix.)

I do recommend using a quality cut of meat.  We did use really good sirloin the first time we made these, but the cut we used the second time was a little fatty, and it was not nearly as tender or flavorful.

White rice is a great side dish for these kabobs.  The meat, veggies, and rice make a full meal...  and a very good one, at that!

This is a great recipe!  My husband ranted and raved over the taste of the meat and my kids even loved it.  It hardly took any time to make the marinate, the hard part now will be waiting the 8 hours while it marinates!  My husband took the left overs to work (he is a fire fighter) and the guys called me to get the recipe so they can make it at work!

I made this recipe for guests, and it turned out very well.  The pineapple was a nice change....I don't  usually put pineapple on my kabobs, but it turned out well.  Make sure to marinate the steak overnight so that it is nice and tender and flavorful.

This recipe was a huge hit with the entire family.  I can't wait to fix it for a dinner party!  The marinade was soooo good, we made extra and put it on white rice as a side.  No need to change anything!  Thanks!!!

Marinaded meat tasted great and I alternated the meat between each vegetable. Everyone loved the kabobs.  Next time though I'll cut the beef into 1" cubes.

If you like your green pepper alittle crunchy you may not want to parboil the pieces since they come out great when grilling the kabobs.

My stomach is soooo full.  I just got finished trying these kabobs for the first time, and they were WONDERFUL!  I marinated the meat, onions, and bell peppers overnight, then this morning I added the mushrooms and pineapple.  I wrapped the meat in bacon before skewering everything, and they turned out perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I will definitely use this recipe again...soon.

Well this was a great start, but I improved upon it to make it 5 stars. Instead of the garlic powder and garlic pepper seasoning, I used 1 clove fresh garlic minced and 1/2 tsp Montreal steak spice. I marinated the veggies as well (adding zuchinni, red pepper and sweet vidalia onion to the other veggies listed - substituting portabello mushrooms for regular). After marinating all day I microwaved the zuchinni and peppers for a minute and a half and skewered everything. I used canned pineapple chunks, reserving the juice and added a bit to the basting marinade. Delicious!!!

I made these and admittedly made a number of changes, but nothing that would have adversely affected the outcome.  I made the marinade subbing seasoned pepper for the garlic pepper seasoning.  The veggies I used were red, yellow, and orange bell peppers, mushrooms, onions and zucchini.  I didn’t bother blanching the peppers.  I skewered the meat and veggies separately as their cooking times are different.  I thought the marinade was very thin so I heated the reserved marinade and added a cornstarch/water slurry to thicken it just enough to give it some body.  I think that made a better basting sauce because it had some nice “cling” and didn’t just run off.  This was good and we enjoyed it served over rice.

I made these for our 4th of July backyard barbeque and it was a big hit.  Everyone commented on how tender and delicious the meat was.  That surprised me since sirloin is a leaner cut and is why I didn't make them into steaks in the first place.  I marinated overnight.  I think the vinegar and 7-Up tenderized the meat perfectly.

Best kabobs ever!  The meat came out tender and the flavor was great.  The marinade isn't sweet like a teriyaki but you can definitely taste the affects of the brown sugar and soda.  Don't worry you can't taste the lemon/lime flavor at all. I wasn't sure if I should go with london broil or sirloin as some reviewers said the sirloin came out tough. I went with sirloin anyways and was glad I did. I cut them into large cubes a bit bigger than 1" just in case the marinade did over tenderize and toughen the meat. The meat marinated for about 18 hours.  I skewer everything separately (meat, veggies and fruit) since they all have different cooking times. I didn't blanch the peppers and they did take a lil longer on the grill than everything else (put them on before meat on low temp in back). The meat was seared on high and then the grill was turn down a bit and cooked about 5 minutes on both sides. I sprayed oil and seasonings (garlic powder, pepper, salt, mrs. dash) over the veggies just before grilling. I should have used the meat marinade because that was amazing.  Can't wait to eat leftovers tonight!  Thank you Kimber.

I make lots of kabobs, so thought I would try these today.

For the most part, I liked them. I don't parboil my bell peppers though. I like them tender-crisp. I slow cook them so the veggies get done right with the meat. Very good flavored marinade! Thank you!

We LOVE these!!! We omit the cherries and replace with zucchini from the garden. We've prepared the meat and marinade ahead of time and froze it for camping trips (meat/marinade then thaw in cooler) - turns out GREAT every time!! We also grill meat on separate skewers from the rest for more even cooking.

This is very good, I will make this again.  I followed the recipe except I added cubed chicken breast.  I marinaded the beef in chicken in a sealed tupperware bowl for 24 hours.  The results were tender, juicy and flavorful!!!

Thought these were pretty good, but really nothing out of the ordinary.  Although the meat was very tender, it just seemed to be lacking in flavor or something.  Can't really put my finger on it!  Alot of chopping!

This made the sirloin taste fabulous!  And the leftovers were great too.  We have vegetarians in the family and made a batch with firm tofu instead of steak and it was great too!

I made these tonight and they were fantastic. I let them marinade two nights, not on purpose. My MIL took us out to dinner last night when I was originally going to make these. My hubby (the very picky eater) said they were the best kabobs he's ever had. I used beef sirloin and chicken breasts. I also let the veggies marinade with the beef. Next time I'll add the mushrooms about 4 hours before cooking. They seemed to soak up too much and just didn't taste right to me.

These were great! I didn't blanch the peppers - just tossed the veggies in a little olive oil, salt, and pepper before putting on the skewers. I would recommend doubling the marinade. After reserving the half cup for basting, there wasn't enough to cover the meat while it was marinadiing. I could have used more for basting too.

YUMMY! I used the same ingredients but prepared on my indoor electric grill. I grilled the meat first, then the vegetables. The meat was very tender. My family loved it. This recipe is a definitely a keeper.

I loved this recipe. I have never made kabobs before and I made this for family members over at the pool. Everyone loved it. Since then I have used it again and again for a marinade for other peices of meat. It's a keeper!!

This was good.  Next time I will make extra marinade so that I can marinate the mushrooms as well.  Basting with the marinade was not enough to give them enough flavor.  Even my 2 year old ate this!

Now, I tend to like my marinades with a little kick.  We made this for mothers day, so I wanted something a little less spicy for others to enjoy.  Everyone loved this recipe.  I would personally give it 4 stars, just because it was was to sweet for my tastes, if I make this again I would cut the brown sugar down to about 1 tablespoon or maybe even 1/2 tablespoon and add some chile.  Good recipe.

What a great recipe!! I used chuck eye steak, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and pineapple. I left out the tomatoes. I did let it marinate over night. I made the marinade by the book, and I wouldn't make any changes. I think this is one of the best marinades that I have ever cooked.

Very good flavor.  Be sure to use a good cut of meat.  Anything less and you'll end up with chewy, although flavorful, chunks of meat.  Also, I changed the recipe to make 20 servings and there didn't seem to be quite enough marinade so you may want to make more than what the recipe calls for.

I made this for a tailgate party and got rave reviews.  I marinated both the meat and mushrooms overnight in the sauce - the mushrooms taste great marinated! I packed all the veggies and meat in containers, set them out and let everyone make their own kabobs, then popped them on the grill.  Wonderful recipe!

Very good - will definitely make again.  Did omit the tomatoes and used onions.  Should have par boiled the green peppers as suggested - crunchy.  The london broil I used was not of the best quality but the meat still turned out tender.  Great recipe.

The meat was awsome and the presentation of these looked great. I had some problems with things falling off because I didnt cut them big enough, so make sure you dont skimp on the size of the veggies!

These are very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with it. I may use more mushrooms next time, but that is just personal preference and the recipe really is wonderful as is. The marinade made the meat very tender and flavorful. Perfect recipe for summer grilling. Just served with rice and that was it. Very simple and very good.

This was the best kabob I have ever had!  The marinade for the steak was perfect!  I chopped up the mushroom stems and some onion and added it to the marinade to make a reduction to accompany the kabobs - YUM! (Make sure to boil the marinade for a few minutes so its safe to eat!)

I made these for Mother's Day & they were delicious! I only marinated the meat for about 5 hours and it was still very juicy & tender! I served them on a bed of yellow rice and with grilled onions, zuccuni & squash! They were a big hit!

Absolutely FANTASTIC!! I will use this marinade for steaks, too. Be sure to grill fresh pineapple, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, peppers, squash, zucchini & pearl onions on separate skewers. Do all of the meet on skewers of their own. This is for cooking everything to perfection. I reserved some marinade to baste the veggies & meet while grilling.

Excellent!  This is by far the best kabob recipe I have tried from this site, and there are several very good ones.  One tiny substitution...I used grape tomatoes because I couldn't find any decent cherry tomatoes at the market.  I'd love to try this with pork or chicken next time!

Fantastic!  I prepared the marinade and dropped the meat in the night before we took our RV out to the desert.  When we were ready for the kabobs, I put everything together on the skewers and grilled.  They were awesome -- a real hit with everyone!

These were amazing. The marinade was awesome, the meat was juicy, tender and delicious. I use Tri-tip instead of sirloin, and my guests loved it. No changes other than the cut of meat. Wonderful.

This is one of the best and easiest marinades ever. I use the recipe amounts for the salt and pepper,  then used three cloves of fresh minced garlic.  Made kabobs that were delicious and threw another steak in the marinade for dinner tonight. A real keeper.

VERY GOOD, I couldn't find my Soy Sauce so I used Teriyaki sauce instead and it still turned out amazing. Also I only marinated an hour and I could still taste all the flavor. Husband loved it too. :)

I scored major points with my wife by making this dish on the 4th of July! I wish that I had read the suggestions by Janet and Bubooki to marinade the veggies as well, but I think that you can hardly improve on fresh Hawaiian pineapple in Oahu in any case. My notoriously picky 4 year old said, "Dad, this dinner is perfecto!" Also, once the preparation is done, setting up the skewers is a fun family activity. The color and smell combination are very appetizing, and I would recommend this as a quick and easy accompaniment for football games. Not poker, though. It isn't clean finger food, and you don't want to mess up the cards.

We marinated a large sirloin steak over night and it was incredible. The meat was so tender and flavorful.  We will make this again and again.  We would serve it to company any time.  It was that good!!  We cut it into larger pieces and put them on the screwers long way so the larger side cooked.  It worked really well and the pieces cooked to a lovely medium rare.

This is an excellent  meat marinade - the only change  was to add freah minced garlic and omit salt - the carbonated  lemon  line soda added a delicous touch to  the meat. I   made this for  a camping trip and everyone  raved about the flavor of the  kabobs.  you can use any combination  of vegetables, but do  thread some pineapple with meat  and vegeatbles onto  the skewer - I will be making again  -thanks for posting  your recipe !

The marinade didn't end up being very flavorful for me, even though I followed the recipe exactly.  It only made the meat taste slightly sweet.  After tasting the first batch, I sprinkled the rest liberally with lemon-pepper seasoning after basting with the reserved marinade.  That really helped the flavor, and we liked it after that.  Still, I doubt I'll make this again.

I made them for the first time for Halloween party (6lb.'s worth of top sirloin - I trusted the prior reviews).  They were a HIT!!!! Everyone seemed to really enjoy them, and I loved the sweet and juicy flavor, I used onions, green peppers, and Cherry tomatoes for my veggies - I did microwave the peppers for 3 min in a bowl of water.

My word of advice to anyone cooking these, is please don't over cook the meat.  Sear them up real nice, get the tomatoes bubbling and pull them off! You'll be rewarded with tender, juicy meat that everyone will love!

Thanks so much for the recipe!

It's probably not fair for me to review this recipe since I don't eat beef myself, but I made it for a group last night and they all gobbled it up. Of course, it might be that sirloin would be gobbled no matter how it's prepared. It was an easy recipe, though. I skipped all the veggies because we were having sides that took care of that, so the pineapple flavors that other reviewers noted as nice, were definitely missing. I used just over a pound of sirloin and the marinade just covered it in a small bowl, so I'm thinking that if you used the 2 lbs the recipe calls for, you might want to increase the marindade or use a ziplock that you can squish around occassionally to make sure all the meat gets saturated.

..Tired of the same ol' steak and potatoes?  Try these kabobs! The marinade is really easy to throw together in the morning resulting in tender, yummy bites of sirloin.  I used fresh garlic and cracked pepper rather than the 1/2 tsp of garlic pepper and 4 oz of sprite.  I didn't blanch my veggies since we like them crisp and added onion in place of the cherry tomatoes (didn't have any).  I wanted more meat and veggies so grilled pineapple rings on the side.
Next time I will marinade the 'shrooms, peppers and onions and try rosemary skewers...will make these again..thx Kimber!!

This recipe was a TOTAL hit at my Father's Day BBQ (we have many picky eaters).  I used filet mignon instead of sirloin and I didn't have lemon-lime soda, so I left it out completely.  I would probably do the same next time I make them also.  I only marinated meat for 6 hours, and the meat was very flavorful.

The marinade was wonderful.  I halved the recipe but didn't think I had enough marinade for one pound of beef so I ended up using the marinade quantity in the original recipe but only half of the meat quantity.  The only other change I made was to substitute onion for the cherry tomatoes as a matter of personal preference.  Will definitly make this again.

Tasted like teriyaki.  I was going to omit the pineapple, but ended up using some canned chunks, and loved the combo of meat and fruit.  Marinated meat 2 days, and expected more flavor.

Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Meat was flavorful and tender.  When I make kabobs, I always place the pineapple next to the meat because I think it further tenderizes the meat as it cooks.

I followed others' suggestions and marinated the mushrooms separately. I also added red peppers, I didn't blanche the peppers and they were fine. Also I made a little extra sauce. Make sure you put the extra sauce inside a container that has room, the soda seemed to make it bubble up and out the from under the lid of my tupperwear container.  They made a nice presentation and my guests like it.  A tip from my asian neighbor, if you use wooden skews, soak them in water first for about 15 minutes or more so they don't burn on the grill.  Also, I skewed them about 6 hours ahead of time and put them back in the refrigerator.  Saved me a lot of "last minute" work.

This recipe is a HOME RUN!  To die for!  I used the toughest english broil roast you could imagine and it all but melted in your mouth with a taste the kept on giving!  Because I was using such a tough cut of meat, I marinated for 24 hours instead of 8.     What I really liked about this marinate (besides the awesome taste) was the lack of salt as compared to many marinates.  I immediately begin to feel the effects of too much salt by puffing up - this was not the case at all.   Great recipe!

Very good recipe. I prefer a little stronger flavor so next time I think I'm going to try adding some fresh garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper to the mix.

Definitely 5 stars by us.  I used top sirloin and followed the recipe.  Very delicious.  We will be enjoying these again soon.

OH MY. FABULOUS.  Marinated overnight and followed the recipe exactly except I microwaved the bell peppers for 2 minutes.  Next time I'll make extra marinade to baste the kabobs with while cooking.   Id give these 10 stars if I could.

I made these on the grill using charcoal and wood chips for Father's Day and everyone loved them. I used strip steak and marinated them over night. I cooked the vegetables on seperate skewers because I was afraid of the consistency of doneness between the meat and the vegetables. The flavor was excellent and some of my guest like their steak well done which my fanily is not used to and I tasted the well done ones and they still tasted great and not tough. I will use this marinade the next time I make a steak.

My husband doesn't really enjoy steak that much (I know! Weird!) but I love it...so I am always trying to find a way to get him to "want" steak since I crave it at times- this was it! He enjoyed it and I thought it was great too! YAY!

Our meat ended up in the marinade for 2 days but the dish was fantastic. We didn't have any garlic pepper seasoning and I'm going to add onions to the vegetables the next time, but we'll use this again and again. Thanks so much for posting it!!

This was delicious!  I didn't use pineapple because we don't like to cook with it.  I used red and orange peppers to add more color.  I served the kabobs over rice and it was a hit with our guests!  Thanks for sharing!

I loved the marinade for the kabobs, and the pineapple was delicious, but next time I will add red potatoes and I will cook the kabobs longer.

I thought that the marinade had no flavor and I put it in the fridge the night before and the next day, cooked it at a BBQ. The only good thing on the kabob was the fruit and veggies. I'll never make this recipe again.

Absolutely delicious!! I had been wanting to try this recipe, and decided to make tonight with only 3 hours to marinate.  The sirloin was so tender and flavorful, can't wait to try again when I have time to marinate overnight.  Will definitely make again and again, thanks for sharing!

Very good!  This was my first time making kabobs and they turned out GREAT!  I used tenderizer salt instead of seasoned salt and I didn't have garlic pepper, so I just used regular pepper.  I added some other veggies as well, but I stuck to the recipe otherwise.  Oh!  And I did about a pound and a half of steak and the same for chicken.  I doubled the marinade (but I didn't keep quite enough for basting).    Thanks for the great recipe!

The marinade made the sirloin super tender, melt in your mouth delicious. Used the multi-coloured small peppers which made for a more colorful presentation. Tomatoes were ok, I wouldn't use them the next time, perhaps replace them with red onion but that's the only thing I would alter. Really good recipe we'll make again.

These were pretty good, and they made great leftovers.  I recommend cooking the tomatoes separately and for half the time, otherwise they may burst.

I love this recipe. The marinade is great on sirloin but I have also used it on chicken with great results. I also double the marinade to brush while grilling. I don't marinade the veggies as they get soggy. I simply toss in olive oil and garlic salt and pepper. Thanks for a great go to recipe!

Wow these kabobs were the best!!The marinade was sooo delicious. I will definitely be using this marinade for my kabobs or even steak for that matter. Very impressed. Marinade overnight to get the best flavor. Dont skip the lemon-lime carbonated drink. I think that was the secret to this delicious marinade.

Super!  Hubby & kids really enjoyed these.  I am not a steak eater & I thought they were quite good too.  I ended up using Dales Steak Seasoning in place of the soy sauce (after discovering I was out of soy sauce).  It was still really good with the Dales...but, looking forward to trying the soy sauce next time.

I wasn't very happy with this marinade.  I marinaded over night and the flavor took over the flavor of the beef.  The taste of the soda was also kind of weird.  Also, I didn't have garlic pepper nor have I ever heard of it so I used regular, but I doubt that had anything to do with it again.  I probably will look for a different marinade if I choose to make these again.

This was just excellent!  I doubled the marinade and remembered the 1/2 c. to save back for basting.  I used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and salt.  I also marinated the veggies in a sesame honey ginger dressing I had on hand.  Used red and yellow peppers and did not blanch them. Replaced the  mushrooms with zucchini as I made the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto as another user did (recipe on this site).  I didn't use tomatoes because when you try to get those off a skewer when they are hot, it's messy. I'll definitely make these again.

This recipe was awesome but I changed somethings to fit what I had around the house. Instead of lemon-lime flavored soda, I used tequila with some lime and lemon juice squeezed in. I also tossed the veggies in some olive oil, soy sauce, and garlic-pepper seasoning before putting them on skewers. 
 
This recipe was really easy and the kabobs were delicious...we've made them a few times and my family loves them.

This marinade is sooooooooo delicious!!  I doubled the marinade ingredients (except kept the lemon-lime soda at 4 oz) and marinated the meat for ~6 hours and then basted the meat while grilling.  I love how the soy sauce flavors but doesn't overpower.  My family loved it.

Verrrry good marinade- not just for kabobs. I will use this as a staple marinade for all my meat. Make sure you marinate overnight. I tried marinating for only 3 hours, and the flavor did not penetrate the meat at all. It is too good to hurry!

I made and served these kabobs at my party as the main attraction, and everyone enjoyed them and wanted more. I let the beef sit in the marinade for 24 hours or more, which gave it the tenderness and succulent quality for the debut!

We loved this.  Gives the meat & veges a great flavor.  I used small red onions which I quarted and then roasted with whole garlic cloves, EVOO and some spices.  I then added this to the beef which had been marinating for a few hours.  I added mushrooms to the marinade for the last 1/2 hour or so.  I needed more marinade because of the veges so I doubled that amount. I know I will be making this alot.

So wonderful!  We marinated a thick sirloin steak overnight, and WOW this was great.  The next time, we'll add some red pepper flakes or something for heat to compliment the sweet.  Thank you for this marinade!

It was a mess. Our kabobs burned up on the pit. The few that were salvagable for stovetop cooking did not have enough salt. The recipe didn't say to add it, so I assumed the marinade was going to add enough of a salted taste. Although the meat was tender, it was bland. The pineapple came out best.

Excellent.  I was short on time so only marinated for maybe 3-4 hours, and I didn't even marinate the veggies.  I just took the extra marinade and brushed it on about 30 min. before grilling.  I also sprinkled it all with Montreal Steak Spice prior to grilling.  Everything was very flavourful and the meat was quite tender.  I will try this on pork and chicken.

My husband had never made kabobs before, but since our son's birthday party had a Hawaiian theme, we thought we'd try them. They were a big hit with our guests. He added chicken on several of the skewers and that turned out just as tasty. We'll make these again, I'm sure!

This is a favorite recipe in our house!  I did change the vegetables a little do to my husband's picky tastes!  I did not use the cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, or pineapple.  Instead used onions, potatoes, and red and green bell peppers.

I actually took a risk and used this recipe to feed a party of 50 for my sister's wedding reception.  Although I personally found it somewhat bland, everyone ranted and raved about how wonderful it was.  I ended up using some store bought bbq sauce to add some kick to it.  Overall good recipe, but next time I will probably try one with a little more flavor.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.I followed the recipe exactly. The fresh pineapple was wonderful.I used a small london broil instead of sirlion it was very good and marinated overnight. I am trying this next time with can unsweetened pineapple chunks -- cheaper and less time consuming. Thanks Kimber

I've used this recipe twice in the last month and it was wonderful. Yes, I changed a couple of things in the marinade but nothing that would make a difference in flavor. It's easy,(it doesn't use oil), and it delicious.

This recipe was good but it just didn't resonate with the rest of the family. It was good to make to have a different, non-oily marinade but I think that I'll stick with my tried-and-true kebab marinade. If you're looking for a little less oily marinade then I'd definitely give this one a try.

The meat was delicious! I couldn't get enough. I marinated for a couple days though... next time I will follow other reviewer's advice and give the veggies a quick brush of olive oil & seasoning so they can try to compete with the amazing taste of the meat :)

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! I make it with chicken or steak its so delicious I usually don't have garlic pepper on hand so I add a little more garlic powder or minced garlic and regular pepper and it always turns out I've made this sooo many times for company and they always compliment how delicious the marinade is I usually double the recipe for the marinade and marinade the veggies in it as well and the. Baste with the remainder!!!

SENSATIONAL! I used a 2.5 lb. Sirloin Steak and I marinated overnight.  Meat was so tender it melted in your mouth.  The pineapple added a nice sweetness to it.  I served over plain couscous and my family went crazy for it.  No more buying premade at the butcher's anymore!

I only had time to marinate for 2 hours and these were still delicious! I can't imagine what 8 hours would do! I only had ginger-ale on hand and I think the combo of ginger and soy worked awesome!

These kabobs were great.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of skewering the steak separately from the veggies and fruit.  Very nice flavor.  Went very well with Lemon Fried Rice from the Taste of Home website.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Kimber!

This was really good. I made it for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I did not put veggies on my skewers - just the beef. Made the marinade and put beef into it on Tuesday afternoon. Put the skewers together on Wednesday night then put them in freezer since my party wasn't till Friday. I had to make them ahead since I was going out of town till Friday afternoon. Really, really good beef! In place of garlic powder I used the squeezable stuff from produce department. I also used Montreal steak seasoning in place of lemon garlic seasoning. I felt these changes added to the flavor. Next time I will make more marinade and hold some aside so that I can reduce down and brush on meat while cooking. Served with rice pilaf and Rosemary ranch chicken for those non beef eaters.

This was very good. I made a big batch of the marinade, cut several NY Strips into large chunks and put both in several ziplock bags in the freezer. Makes it easy to defrost, assemble and grill! The pineapple adds a nice touch. Thank you!

Probably the best marinade for kabobs that I've had. I'll definitely make this again. I might even just use the marinade by itself for other meat.

Great recipe!  My husband has asked that I keep this one and reuse it.  The 7-Up was a surprise ingredient, and since no one drinks it around here, I used what was needed and poured the rest down the drain.  I will now keep a 6-pack of the mini cans just for this recipe.  I keep a bottle of distilled vinegar in the pantry for cleaning windows.  Who would have thought it wouldn't be too harsh to use in a marinade?  I usually use wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar in my marinades, and was wary about using the distilled vinegar.  I marinated the beef for about 20 hours.  It was tender and flavorful. I didn't have a fresh pineapple, so I will wait till next time to see what I missed this time.  Thanks!

This is my absolute favorite kabob marinade, the only one I make now.  My family just loves it! The only thing I never seem to have on hand is the garlic pepper seasoning, so I just add pepper and a little more garlic.

Me and my husband absolutly loved these kabobs! The steak was soo juicy and was the best steak i have ever cooked! I only marinated the steak for about 6 hours and they were still awesome i can only imagine over night. Im making these again and this time i want to try squash and zuchinni. I wasnt a big fan on the tomatoes but the pineapples and the mush rooms were delisious, i'll definitly keep those. I will do the green pepper again but this time i'll take the advice of the recipe and blanch them first. I also highly recommend tossing all the veggies in olive oil, garlic salt, and pepper before putting them on the skewers. These are by far my most favorite recipe.

These are okay... The veggies really need to be marinated for a bit as well. the marinade is so runny that basting is impossible. Also, grilled pineapple is a must with this.

This recipe is fantastic followed in the exact portions noted in the recipe.  I used Mikes Hard Limeade for the carbonated beverage.  I also marinated the meat for 12 hours.  The kabobs came out perfect!

Added some fresh garlic along w/the powdered and a dash of cayenne for a little oomph...only had 5 hrs to marinade, so maybe that's why it was just a little too tame.  Flavor was good - just not strong enuf.  I'd try again w/amped up qtys of the spices and a longer marinade time.  Thanks for the post!

We used a T-bone, cutting it off the bone to marinate for kabobs. Cooked to medium, enjoyed immediately off the grill - amazing taste! We made this for company, and it was a hit with the steak-lovers! I even liked it though, (not being a steak fanatic myself)... says a lot. Great marinade!

Made the kabobs without veggies, just marinated the meat with all the ingredients. Kept the sirloin tender, very mild taste without being bland.

This was so good, we had it twice in one week! The marinade is great -- even with mid-grade meat (we used stew meat) it was very tender and had great flavor. I let it marinade for a good 18+ hours, and did the quick toss of olive oil and seasoning salt for the veggies.   And for any leftovers you may have -- I sliced everything up and threw it with some spring mix and a little olive oil. It made for a salad that was just as amazing as the original meal!

These were delicious!  I marinated the meat for about 5 hours... only change I made was I used some fresh garlic and pepper, as I didn't have garlic pepper.  I also added a bit of Mrs Dash.  I forgot to add the pineapple when skewering, so I put it on its own skewers and everything turned out very flavorful and yummy.  I served the kabobs over basmati rice.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely be making it again.

Finally!  You can't know how many years I have tried to make beef kabobs that didn't come out as tough as truck tires.  This truly was my last effort before I threw in the towel.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were delicious!  Thank you, thank you for sharing this recipe.  Can't wait to make it again.

Had all the ingredients to make this and discovered my skewers were missing.  So, I made a stir fry out of the ingredients, using the reserved marinade as a sauce.  Turned out excellent.  Flavors went together quite well.  Even the picky eaters liked it.  Will be making again, and would love to try it as actual kabobs!

The marinade for these kabobs is wonderful.  My husband and my son devoured these.  I have a pretty picky husband so I had to leave out the pineapple and mushroom.  I can only imagine what it would taste like had I added them.

My beef kabobs came out great!  I cooked them in the broiler for 10 minutes (5 minutes on each side).

I have made this many times now and overnight is a must for tender meat I used sirloin and I cook the meat on one skewer and the veg on another this way you don't burn the veg.Thanks for such a yummy recipe.

This has to be one of the best beef marinade recipes I've ever tried.  After marinating for three days, the sirloins was tender and flavorful.  My husband couldn't stop adding pieces to the grill!

Husband thought these were superb.  Tender enough for 15 month old to eat.  I used 1 lb of serloin but used the full amount of marinated.

This was an easy and tasty marinade.  The meat had a very mild, slightly sweet yet tangy taste.  The whole family loved this one.  My favorite beef kabob to date! Made just as specified, but about one and one half times the marinade so there was more left for basting and dipping.

OMG...I'm not a steak eater but tried this one and it's absolutely amazing.  I doubled all the spices and otherwise used it as is.  Sometimes I marinate for just a couple of hours and sometimes overnight and it's always well received.

These are fantastic!  I don't eat a lot of beef, but a friend made these at our cooking club and everyone loved them!  The flavor is very balanced but not overpowering to the meat.  Wonderful recipe!!

Oh my deliciousness! This was fabulous. My husband RAVED! I used bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and onion. Following advice from others, I soaked my wooden skewers before I grilled on my indoor Cuisinart. Also, I soaked the onion for about an hour so it wouldn't burn while grilling. I put the green peppers (not blanched), onion, and tomatoes with a bit of olive oil and oregano about ten minutes before skewering. Served with mashed potatoes. Hubby was so happy - a good thing, too, because he really hated last night's recipe experiment. Thanks!

These were pretty good.  I made the marinade as written except I didn't have garlic pepper, so substituted more garlic powder with regular black pepper.  My first thought when I took a bite was that it tasted like 7-up.  I used the veggies I had on hand (peppers, onion, zucchini, tomatoes) and did not use any marinade on them.  My daughter said 4 stars.  Thanks!

Another keeper! Excellent marinade. Fresh pineapple on the grill is so good but I prefer it with chicken instead of beef. I also don't care for tomatoes on kabobs as they seem to turn to mush. If I do use them, I will cook my meat alone on skewers and the vegetables on other skewers. Great recipe that you can add any combination of meat, poultry and vegetables to your personal likes. Yum!

LOVE THIS!  Of course, it's impossible for me to make anything "by the book" so I changed a few things to my taste.  I added some ginger and used a decent ammount minced garlic rather than the garlic powder or garlic pepper.  I didn't have any Sprite or 7up, so I used Squirt.  GREAT Flavor!!!

These were great!  The marinade has a nice balance of sweet and salty.  I added some minced garlic to the marinade in place of the garlic powder.  Next time, I would probably marinate the vegetables as well to give them a little extra flavor.  I served this with Gourmet Mushroom Risotto (from this site) so I replaced the mushrooms with green zucchini slices.  I also added white onions and omitted the pineapple (husband's preference).

I just tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious. I thought the taste the marinade added was perfect. The kabobs were tender and flavorful. I tried to follow the recipe as it was written and it was just the flavors I was looking for. Everyone loved it. Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper.

Excellent!  I made these last night for my in-laws who are very picky and they LOVED them.  I only marinated for 8 hours and they were very tender.

Made this yesterday evening; with only one change.  I used sturdy stalks of rosemary for the skewers & it gave the kabobs a garden-fresh flavor.  I soaked the stalks for about a half hour before adding meat, veggies & fruit.  I  poked thru the food 1st with my metal skewers to make threading easier.  I read about this tip recently in a magazine, so I won't take credit.  The neighbors next door said they just HAD to come over & check out what I was doing.

This was fantastic.  I only had enough time to marinade for about 3 hours and it still turned out great.

I think this is a very good dish. I really enjoyed the marinade. Everyone else seemed to enjoy this marinade also.

I tried this marinade again on some pork I had to use for stir fry. I made a second batch of marinade and used it to coat the vegtables, noodles and meat. I put the sauce in a pan added 1 tsp of minced garlic and some cornstarch to thicken it up before coating my stir fry. 

and let me tell you it was to die for YUMMY!! My children loved it and requested to eat the leftovers for dinner the next night!!

We LOVED these.  However, I did make a few changes.  I left out the seasoned salt and garlic pepper.  Added onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper.  I also doubled the marinade amount and marinated overnight.  I coated the veggies with oil, salt, and pepper before skewering.  Then I cooked everything in my Showtime rotisserie.  My family wasn't crazy about the tomatoes (but I think it was the tomatoes' fault) nor the pineapple.  Next time, I will play around with the veggies I use.  And there will definitely be a next time!

Wow, this was great!  Made it for a barbeque, and everyone loved it.  Definite keeper.  Oh, I didn't have garlic pepper seasoning, so I used lemon pepper.  YUM!

Our friends and family liked this! I didn't have 7up so I substituted Pepsi instead which could be the reason I didn't "love" it but overall it was the best kabobs I've ever had!

This was very good.  I added tenderizer like was suggested, and also doubled the marinade and included the mushrooms the day of cooking.  Not quite a five star but very good.

Very tender and flavorful.  You need to plan ahead though, because of the over-night marinade step.  This got rave reviews from all!  Thanks!

This marinade was very good. I will use this over and over again. I did cut back on the sugar by one tablespoon. I would suggest doubling the marinade and using meat tenderizer as well. The sirloin just didn't get as tender as I would have liked, however, the meat was very good. 
Have fun cooking.

I love kabobs and have tried several different recipes...this one is absolutely EXCELLENT!  I doubled the marinade so I would have enough for the meat AND the mushrooms at the same time.  I marinated the meat overnight and stuck the mushrooms in the next morning and then made the kabobs after work that same day.  The meat was tender and had TONS of flavor! I highly recommend this recipe to everyone!

Great recipe.  Only marinated my sirloin for one hour and used diet 7-up and low-sodium soy sauce.  Also, used fresh garlic (2 cloves) and a red pepper.  The beef I used was lean.  Because there was no oil in the marinade, these kabobs were easy to grill without having flames flare-up that might have burned the veggies & fruit. Didn't pre-cook the peppers because we like them crunchy.

Very tasty and not too sweet although I may have cut back on the sugar a little.  I also add 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, but hardly noticed any heat.  My family is not a fan of sweet marinades and prefers a little kick.  Next time I'll add a little more red pepper, but for this review I'll say it's very good as is.  No need to doctor it up unless you feel the need.

We enjoyed this marinade on the steak kebab so much last night, my son requested the same marinade for chicken. I left the lemon pepper out but used to roast garlic seasoning in its place. Also added a tablespoon of lime juice. Poked holes in the chicken and marinated in the fridge for an hour.

I'd like a little less sweetness and a little more salt to the taste but it was good. I used normal tomatoes that I had in stock in stead of cherry tomatoes. That worked just fine. And I used white mushrooms from Costco.

I substituted pineapple juice for the vinegar and used concentrated lemon and lime juice. I marinated the sirloin for a day and the kabobs turned out to be very tasty.

I also marinated some chicken in a separate bag (same marinade) and skewered it with the sirloin and veggies. We will definitely make this again, it was delicious!

I added worcestershire & i like my veggies charred & cooked longer than my beef, so I skewered them separately drizzled with evoo,  salt, & pepper. Maybe I'm  missing the marriage between the veggies & beef, but they both taste great on their own.

I got a fairly tough piece sirloin from Walmart. It actually looked like the heel of a rump roast. Followed the recipe.
The results were fabulously tender. I put the pineapple chunks next to the meat. I plan on experimenting with variations of this menu as I believe the Sprite soda is the key ingredient
Definitely a keeper.
Update: Made them a 2nd time. Didn't blanch the peppers.
Just coated the veggies with a zesty Italian dressing and skipped the garlic powder. Still fantastic
 You have to keep in mind this  is about making a meal out of a tough piece of meat

Enjoyed this recipe, good marinade. However, when grilling next time, put meat on a separate skewer in order to cook the entire meal more evenly.

These looked amazing, magazine worthy , on the grill however, I thought they lacked flavor. Loved the grilled pineapples the most! If I made it again, I would buy a better cut of meat. Went for the less expensive meat therefore the meat was a little chewy and tough.

This is a nice marinade.  I let my top sirloin sit overnight and it was very tender off the grill.  Next time however, I will add something to give it a little zip...perhaps some red pepper flake or Sriracha.

The only change I made was I also made chicken kabobs in addition to the steak kabobs.  Other than that I made it as is.  It was terrific and everyone raved about the flavor.  Will be making these many more times this summer!

I've always had a little difficulty trying to combobulate a good marinade for kebabs so I was happy to try this  – –These kebabs are really good! Mine marinated overnight with pineapple chunks as well.  Added sweet red peppers to the mix  for extra flavor. We Always skewer meat separately from veggies because of cooking time differences and overall this was a simple and very Fine recipe! we paired it up with white rice on the side and extra sauce to dress it as well. What a Yummy supper!!!

Excellent recipe- thank you Kimber!  I made the marinade as written and used it on  Chicken and Steak.  Following a couple of suggestions, I made another batch, thickened it slightly with a cornstarch slurry to baste the veggies in and cooked them separately.  Rave reviews all around.

Made this for dinner tonight and hubby's comment, with a full mouth, "this is gooood!". I followed the recipe exactly except for when I mistakenly put 1 teaspoon (instead of 1/2 tsp.) of garlic powder in the mix so I left out the garlic pepper and just added some pepper. I used a small sirloin roast (it was on sale) and there were a few pieces of meat that were a little tough but that was not the recipe's fault. The marinade is excellent and would be equally good on chicken. I used vegetables fresh from my garden (yellow squash, cherry tomatoes and bell pepper), and sweet vidallia onion. I did not have mushrooms or pineapple but will definitely use them the next time. I made the full recipe of meat and marinade and froze 1/2 in the marinade for an easy dinner in the future. Considering how good this was I doubt it will be too far in the future. Thanks for an easy, delicious and visually attractive recipe.

Delicious! I didn't marinate the sirloin overnight because I didn't know I would be making it until today, so it marinated for about 4 hours. It turned out great! I also didn't blanch the peppers first and they were delicious; they had a nice charred taste with a slight crunch. My whole family loved it, and my husband wants to use the marinade for steaks next weekend.

Prepped this meal the night before an early afternoon BBQ by having the already put-together kabobs marinate overnight in the fridge. Came out beautifully and was eaten up fast!

We loved it!  Because my husband doesn't like vinegar, I substituted lemon juice.  We found this to be really flavorful.  Will definitely make this again!

The marinade was very good but Kabobs were very time consuming.  Not good to make for a large family unless you get your vegetables ready before hand.

well- let me just tell you...I made this marinade only about two hours prior to dinner, so I worried that they would not be very  flavorful, but oh was I wrong! The only change I made was I added about 3 fresh cloves minced garlic, and because of the basting at the end, the flavor was amazing! PLUS- I was so surprised how tender these pieces of not very expensive steak became on the grill with this marinade! It was a real favorite! Thank you so much for the recipe!

Above average by all means, but the family complained of too many veggies, something that is easily fixed. Made these along with rosemary chicken kabobs and a spicy shrimp kabob both recipes from this site.

I followed the recipe to the "T" and the sirloin was chewy.  Husband liked it, but I thought it was a lot of work for a meal I couldn't chew.  The kids loved putting the kabobs together, so that was a plus!  However, they wouldn't tough them.

This is a great base recipe, with a few modifications. I doubled the marinade, so that we would have extra to baste. We made this for company, and they asked for the recipe, it was also kid friendly for my 7 year old! My recipe adaptions are as follows: 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white vinegar, 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 tsp seasoned salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 cup lemonade (Crystal Light prepared), 1/2 cup lime seltzer, 1/4 cup olive oil. I marinated the meat for 8 hrs. We did not cook the peppers ahead of time and we basted for the entire time the meat cooked. The leftovers were fabulous today!

This worked out well for me. The meat was really good and was tender.  my only problems were that the pineapple kept falling off and the kabobs stuck to the grill (I used PAM for Grilling).  I will make them again.

So good! I only marinaded the meat for an hour and it still came out very tender. The marinade was super tasty. I substituted canned pineapple for fresh, and added about half of the juice to the reserve marinade. Yum!

WOW! If you are looking for THE kabob recipe, stop looking and make these. You will not be sorry, dinner was amazing! Even my 2 year old (who does not eat red meat AT ALL) ate them like it was her favorite. The only thing that I did different, was changed the veggies to what we normally eat (green and yellow zucchini and mushrooms) and I did as one of the other reviewers suggested and coated my veggies with olive oil, oregano and fresh pressed garlic. The marinade did not need changing one bit, it was excellent! I will definitely be making these again and again! Thanks for the five star recipe!

I am not giving this 5 stars because the marinade ended up being a bit sweet for my tastes when it comes to beef.  My husband did think it was good.  I thought I might like this marinade better with pork.  I do have to say that the beef was tender and not over salted.

Excellent.  I marinated for 10 hours.  Added red pepper flakes because we like things spicy and coated the vegis in olive oil.  Cooked on my stove top grill.  This is a keeper!

Everyone who's tried this recipe has loved it!  We have used lots of different vegetables - all were good.  We usually use venison tenderloin rather than beef, but either way it's very good.  I make 1.5 times the marinade as I like to let the vegetables marinate for a 1/2 hour before grilling.  Overall, very good!

I made this exactly as per the recipe, except that I tossed the veggies in some olive oil and garlic before threading them on the skewers, as some of the other reviewers had suggested.  It was very good.  Next time, I will make a few extra skewers with only mushrooms (I used small whole white ones) because they were amazing, and I'm not generally a big veggie fan.  I could have eaten a whole bowl of them.

Very good.  I usually screw up any Steak type of thing on the grill but this turned out great the first time.  Meat was very tender even after only marinating 2 hrs.  I also marinated the veggies separately (onion, mushroom, and pepper) which added flavor.  Mine were done about 12 minutes on Med-High heat.  UPDATE:  I have tried to make this several more times yet for some reason the flavor isn't as great as that first time.  I follow the recipe but for some reason it still feels like it is missing something.  Too much vinegar I think too.

Very, very good!  The marinade is superb! Based on my family's personal preferences, I would change a few of the ingredients.  I added onions and suggest using pearl onions.  We also didn't care for the taste of the green peppers.  We added bacon on ours which turned out tasty.  We also didn't care for the tomatoes.  Like others suggested I doubled the marinade and it was plenty.  I think making 1 and 1/2 batches would be fine.

This was awesome. Left out the tomatoes and wished I had made many more. The family (very fussy) enjoyed it. Doubled the marinate.

I made this recipe last night for my husband and some friends.  It was very well received & enjoyed.  The friend liked the marinade so much that he was drinking it right along with the meal!  Definitely a keeper in my book!

Great marinade, easy and had all the ingredients at home.  I didn't have quite enough honey so I added a bit of brown sugar.  Very good flavor and kept the sirloin very moist.  I liked that the veggies were also marinated.

These are very good.  I double the marinade, and then marinate overnight.  I use fresh garlic instead of powder, which mkes a big difference.  Makes a lot of food.

When going to visit my daughter in North Carolina, she had found this recipe on here and decided to try it.  All I can say is boy am I glad she found it!  These were spectacular.  These were by far the best kabobs I have ever had.  My daughter has made these several times as have I.  I have stopped looking for the perfect beef kabob recipe.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I have a restaurant quality marinator so it only took me 20 minutes to marinate the steak. This helped because I only had 2 hours to prepare appetizers and dinner for a party of 5. The meat was absolutely delicious. The only change I would make is the serving size. I made the 2 pounds for 5 people and I think I could have served more. The recipe for 2 pounds says it serves 8 people. I would usually do 1/2 a pound of meat per person as long as there is only 1 main dish.

I made these for the 4th of July.  They were great!  I used onions(after soaking them) and green peppers.  Blanching them was a great tip.  I used wood and they didn't burn on the grill, I soaked them for about 20 minutes before hand.  I will make this again.

This was a hit with my family, and we don't particularly like soy sauce. The marinade was a TAD too strong for my liking, but overall, a really great, easy recipe.

AMAZING! This is the best kabob marinade ever! Works well on chicken too. I also throw the veggies and pineapple in the marinade. I used a bit of Mrs. Dash in there too and I used canned pineapple and it works fine (cheaper and more convenient).

I've made this excellent recipe over a dozen times and have yet to change a thing. It's very tasty and takes only a few minutes to whisk the ingredients together. I always double the recipe because I use about 3lbs of sirloin and I leave a little extra marinade for the mushrooms. I don't marinade the meat overnight, only 5-6 hours. Meat stays extra tender but still packs a punch of flavor! Use plastic storage bags: it makes sure everything gets soaked with the marinade and helps with the cleanup!

Very good. The marinade was delicious and it flavored the meat well after sitting overnight. The pairing of beef with pineapple is wonderful - and the mushrooms and green peppers were also welcomed to create a healthy entreé for my family. We will be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Exceptional! I made this with squash, zucchini, green, yellow, and red peppers, and pineapple. Too good to tell you. The marinade made all the difference in the world, and the meat was so tender we didn't need a knife. Thank you for a great recipe!

Don't let the lemon-lime soda scare you. This recipe is easy and tasty. I marinated the meat overnight and them grilled them. My only complaint is that I did not save any to baste the kabobs!

I love these kabobs.  We use this marinade on shrimp, chicken and beef, but it's the best on shrimp.  The kabobs are a party staple for my family.

I do not consider myself to be a very good cook and admittedly the outcomes when grilling are evenmore questionable. I made this recipe for in-laws visiting from TX and the kabobs turned out great and there was no leftovers. Very flavorful and went well with baked potatoes. Due to limited time, I was able to marinate for only 3.5 hours but the meat was so tender. I also added minced garlic from a jar to the marinade that added extra flavor. I did use sirloin steak rather than a cheaper cut but the tenderness of the meat and the great flavor was worth it. I will definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this recipe last night, we loved it.  My husband wasn't thrilled when he knew I was marinating meat, he doesn't usually like it.  But he loved this one.  Instead of fresh garlic I used chopped from the jar...very tasty.  Will continue to make this one all summer!

They were good, but watch your cubing and grill timing.  Smaller cubes, shorter cooking time.  Will use this marinade on full size steaks for sure but not sure on GRILLED Kabobs, lacked wow factor.

Big hit at a recent family barbeque...many asked what was in it.  They were very surprised to find out Sprite was one of the ingredients! Plan on marinating steak in it tonight for another family get together this weekend!

This was an OK marinade, didn't really have much flavor. I changed the veggies to my families liking. I think I will try something different next time.

I made these for our anniversary party and still had a bunch left over. The taste was bland, even though I marinated them overnight, along with the mushrooms. The meat was very tough -may be because I bought meat already cubed (from the market). We used cherry tomatoes, pineapple, green peppers, and mushrooms. Don't think I'll make these again, but if I did I'd use the sirloin and cut it up myself.

I did have to make some adjustments to this because I didn't have everything needed.  I used dark brown sugar instead of the light brown sugar, left out the seasoning salt and garlic pepper seasoning and added shallot pepper seasoning and red pepper flakes.  Marinated the meat overnight.  My husband and I really enjoyed the flavor of the meat!  It was excellent.  I think marinating overnight was the key to more flavorful meat!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was O.K. but nothing outstanding. I would not serve it to guests. Didn't bother with blanching the peppers or cooking the marinade and applying during grilling. The best part of this was the canned pineapple and cherry tomatoes -- I have never put pineapple on steak kabobs, only chicken or shrimp.

I marinated the steak for over 12 hours and parboiled the peppers. Still, the peppers were crunchy and steak was okay, but not "wow". Husband and I agrees that it was a decent meal but not a "repeater". It just didn't have enought flavor for us.

Oops, I didn't marinate the meat long enough and so it wasn't very flavorful.  I will try better next time.

This is very good but be sure to not overcook or the meat dries out.

These kabobs were SCRUMPTIOUS!  My dad often grumbles when presented with a new recipe, but he wants to have this again.  The given ingredients were wonderful, especially the mushrooms.  I may try other people's suggestions with chicken and onions.

I made it just as it said to. And my husband and friends loved it. I do not care for red meat without a tortilla. So I did just that, I took everything off the stick added a little salsa some fresh beans and avacado and wrapped it up, and had the best burrito ever. And I did that for my husbands lunch today and he said that was the best burrito ever.. Oh I did not put the pineapple in the burrito. So yes I give this 5 stars.

EXCELLENT!! Made this dish for a week-end get-together with close friends and it was a hit. The marinade is wonderful..I choose to marinate overnight and the results were fantastic! Marinade ingredients are easily available...always a plus.
