Restaurant quality for sure!  First I marinated my chicken(6 breasts) in buttermilk for a few hours as I do with all my chicken(1cup milk 1 TBS vinegar or lemon juice if no buttermilk) for that extra moistness. Then I mixed 1/2 cup flour with 1 tbsp paprika and dredged chicken in before frying. I did it all in one skillet-why dirty more than one pan!  I sauteed garlic in 4tbsp butter(instead of oil) on low heat then I raised heat to med and added chicken which I cut into strips and browned on all sides.  Then I added sundried tomatoes and 1 cup mushrooms and sauteed a little longer.  I followed others and doubled sauce so I added 1 cup chick broth and 1 cup white wine(for a greater flavor) salt, pepper and reduced to low, covered and cooked for 30 minutes.  I removed chicken added heavy cream with 2 tbsp cornstarch(I like thicker sauce)and fresh basil and cooked to my desired thickness then added chicken back in and tossed on fettuccini.  WOW what a dish..Yummy! Fattening but a much deserved treat.-don't pass it up!

This is a very rich and creamy pasta recipe that was almost sinful!  I tried to simplify the recipe as a few other reviewers have done and only use one sautee pan.  First, I pounded out my chicken breasts to make them all even thickness then I dipped them in seasoned flour (smoked paprika, salt and pepper)and cooked them in a mixture of olive oil and butter until cooked through (about five minutes a side).  I removed the chicken and added the garlic and about 1 1/2 cups chicken broth to deglaze the pan.  I then added my chopped up sundried tomatoes and let them cook until tender.  Then I added 2 cups of cream and about 1 cup of freshly grated parm cheese.  I let this cook for about 8 mins and then added my chicken which I had sliced into three pieces each and let the chicken heat back up in the sauce and added the basil.  This was soooo good - like a meal at a restaurant!

This will be added to my list of restaurant quality dishes. The sauce is creamy and velvety delicious and the whole dish makes for a beautiful presentation on the plate. I used two chicken breasts (for the two of us) but kept the amounts of the rest of the ingredients the same. I added white wine to the sauce, which must be reduced a good long time to get the thick, rich  consistency I was after. After sauteeing the chicken breasts I sauteed shallots and fresh mushrooms, then added them to the sauce. I served this with whole wheat fettucine and roasted asparagus. We really enjoyed this, however, when I make this again I will stick with doubling the sauce, but keep the amount of tomatoes the same, as the amount of tomatoes meant for four breasts was a bit much for two.

Simple and Delicious!  I started all three pots at the same time and I am glad I did because everything finished at the same time.  Although I was hesitant of the amount of sauce based on previous reviewers I made the recipe as stated.  I found the amount of sauce to be perfect for the meal.  My personal opinion is doubling it would make too much - overwhelming the dish.  I did make minor changes based on personal taste and what I had on hand.  I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning after pounding it thin.  I'm glad I pounded it down - it took longer to cook then the recipe states.  When cooking the chicken I used about 1-1/2 tbsp oil from the sun dried tomatoes for added flavor with the other 1/2 tbsp of olive oil.  I made everything else as stated except used 1-1/2 tsp of dried basil because I didn't have fresh on hand.  Watch your sauce and don't cook it on a high heat it will reduce quickly and you don't want to have the problem other reviewers had with too little sauce.  Also you don't want the sauce to thicken a whole lot which may be causing the complaint of lack of sauce...As the recipe indicates you want it to be able to coat a back of a spoon.  It's not an alfredo sauce so you don't need that texture.  Anyways...My whole family enjoyed dinner even my picky eaters.  Next time I may cook the chicken in the sauce after browning for some added flavor but it is perfect as stated.  Thank you for the recipe it will definitely be a repeat in our home.

yum Yum YUM! I usually never leave reviews, but this recipe was too EXCELLENT to not post something. I tasted a spoonful and I was surprised at how good it was! My brother said it was better than something you would order in a restaurant. Next time, I would double the sauce recipe and use 2 cups of heavy cream and an entire can of chicken broth (14 oz), which makes it easier to use up all the ingredients. I also followed other suggestions and added chopped portabello mushrooms and a little white wine with the sundried tomatoes (the kind packed in oil--this gave the sauce a wonderful flavor). I added about a spoonful of cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a little. I used olive oil instead of the butter and vegetable oil. I cut the chicken into pieces before cooking, and added the broth directly to the chicken instead of putting it aside. Finally, I added about 1/3 cup parmesan cheese with the basil. I made it with bowtie pasta..I think it goes better with shorter pasta instead of strand pasta. YUM...i'm gonna make it again tomorrow!

Let me start by saying that this recipe is DELICIOUS. If you're having company over, or want to impress a date with a fabulous dinner - this is the meal to make. Having said that, there are a few steps I would change when making this dish. My sauce was done long before the chicken and pasta and reduced down to almost nothing. I didn't really have enough to serve. Pound your chicken breast flat and season it first.(WATCH THE SALT - YOU DON"T NEED MUCH)Before you start to cook it, get your pasta going because it takes the longest to finish. Right after you get the chicken on, start your sauce. If you're like me and like a lot on your pasta, please consider making double the recipe - it reduces quickly. Thanks for the restaurant - quality dish!

Oh My God!!!  SOOOOOO good!  This was absolutely incredible and not difficult at all.  I know other reviewers thought it messed up too many pots, however, I kept the chicken in the pan and added the sauce to that to let it absorb the flavors and saved myself an extra plate and pot by doing so.  It's TOTALLY worth the dirty dishes.  My husband and I were fighting over today's leftovers.  I added mushrooms and I used 1/2 and 1/2 rather than the heavy cream (to save on fat and calories) and it was still AMAZING!  This will be a regular in my house.  Thank you for the great recipe!!!

This was so good I was inspired to write a review.  This recipe tastes even better the next day.  Next time I make this I will make the sauce the day before.  I also reccomend putting a little bit of cream aside and mix with a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit.  This was fantastic and probably one of the best recipes I've tried on here so far.

This is a very good recipe. I cannot understand why so many feel the need to change/add other ingredients. Why not submit your own recipe.

This was a great recipe but I did do some changes.  I doubled it so that I could have sauce for a 16 ounce box of pasta, and instead of using sun-dried tomatoes, I used Knorr's sundried tomatoes and pesto mix-It was fabulous!  I cooked the chicken with the chicken broth and then I put it in the sauce instead of placing it on top.

I usually don't post reviews, but I made this for my bf and he said "Give this the best review you can! Or better!" It was just amazing! I did however make a few changes though. When I was making the sauce, I added some chopped up mushroom and onion. I also added about 1/4 cup milk to it as well, just to make a little extra sauce. Turned out great!!!

I have been making this for several years and my husband who is extremely picky decided that he wants this to be his last meal! I have modified this to make it even easier and quicker. I start by cubing the chicken seasoning it with salt and pepper and then browning it in some olive oil in a deep skillet. Once brown I add the garlic letting it toast, and then add the sundried tomatoes and chicken broth. Once its boiling I turn it down to low and let it simmer 5-10 minutes, then add the cream. I usually start boiling the water for the pasta at this time, and I use bowtie pasta. By the time the pasta is done the sauce is thick. I throw it all together and mix in some parmasean cheese.

OHHH MY GOODNESS.. this is a restaurant worthy meal.  I took the suggestion to make this in one skillet using chicken tenders.  I did dredge them in flour seasoned with cajun blackening, onion powder, garlic powder and salt.  I fried those in the butter and olive oil just until done and browned.  I removed from the pan and added a very small, finely diced onion with the minced garlic and let that saute for a couple minutes and then added the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and added the whole cup of chicken broth.  Brought to a boil and let simmer for about 10 minutes, added the cream and the basil and let simmer for about 5-8 minutes.  I sliced the tenders on the diagonal and added right into the sauce.  It's truly one of those recipes that feels like you are eating in a five star restaurant.. hence the 5 star review!!

This is so good!  I would rate 4.5 if I could, but felt 4 was not enough, so I "rounded up" to 5. Agreed with other reviewers that a little red pepper flake and mushrooms would make this dish perfect.  Def a keeper! I took others advise and prepared sauce/chicken in one dish. One last thought - I wish I would have pounded my filets to 1/2" thickness.  I'll try that next time.

This was wonderful. My entire family (picky eaters included) ate it up and raved about the sauce. I agree with other reviewers that the sequence of preparation is awkward. I cooked the chicken first (seasoned, dredged in flour, then sauteed it in butter & olive oil). Took the chicken out and kept it warm on a plate covered with foil. Then, I made the sauce in the same pan while starting the pasta. I doubled the sauce recipe because some of us like our pasta to be drowning in sauce : ) The additions/changes I made were: two teaspoons of flour added in with the broth to thicken it a bit (just preference, not necessary); about a 1/3 C. of white wine; and I used half & half instead of heavy cream. Very, very good. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My family loved this recipe!!  I added a splash of white cooking wine to the pan drippings and broth before adding to the cream sauce, just because a friend recommended.  I ALWAYS butterfly my chicken breasts and soak in 4C water with 1/4C salt and 1/4 sugar for 15-20 minutes in fridge before cooking.  A trick I learned from America's Test Kitchen.  Makes MOIST thin chicken breasts!!!

Followed the recipe EXACTLY as written. No additions...no deletions...no "I made the following 112 changes and give it 5 stars" nonsense...This recipe was fast, easy, and soooo delicious. It has definitely made the regular rotation in our household. BTW  My 18 year-old son made it for his friends and they now think he is a GREAT cook. 'Nuff said!

Tasty! I used a pint of grape tomatoes and a pint of baby yellow tomatoes and roasted them for 4 hrs on 245 degrees. I also threw in a few baby onions and whole garlic cloves. I pounded the chicken down, and we love spice so we put some crushed red pepper flakes on top as well as some good parmesan. Everyone loved it!

Truly restaurant quality!!!  I took others advice and doubled the sauce and served it over pappardelle pasta, and WOW the presentation of this dish matched the taste too!  I made everything in one pan, minus cooking the pasta.  I did coat and season the chicken with 1 tsp smoked paprika, a heavy pinch of salt, fresh ground pepper, and flour mixed together.  Definitely a keeper!!!

Made as directed with chicken breast tenderloins. Delicious! Just don't reduce the sauce too much. Should be a thin creamy sauce. YUM!

This is a very exquisite dish. A wonderful different way to prepare a chicken and pasta dish.   It is certainly restaurant quality. This would be a superb “company for dinner” dish. Great presentation, taste divine and everyone loved it!  It doesn’t get much better than that.

This was absolutely fantastic.  As another reviewer suggested, I used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and used the oil to cook the chicken.  Had great results!  This is really a restaurant quality dish.    It was good the next day too.

This is by far the best recipe I have tried from allrecipes! This recipe is DEFFINATELY a keeper! Great for when company is over - it is resturaunt quality. I have made it a few times, and everyone who has tried is LOVES it!

I have tried a couple of different sun-dried tomato cream sauce recipes and this is way better than any of the other ones. The only caveat is that you NEED to double the sauce. As written it is a bit bland because the pasta soaks up the sauce and you don't have enough to flavor the chicken and really taste the sauce; but if you double it, it's excellent. 

I have made this with both dry tomatoes and the ones packed in oil (with the oil drained) - the flavor is the same, it's just easier to cut the tomatoes if they are the ones packed in oil. Also, if you don't have fresh basil, it's also good with 1 tbls of dried basil. Finally, to make it a little healthier when it's not for a special occasion, I substitute half the cream for half-and-half

Very tasty!  I did what one reviewer did and used half and half...just want to warn others NOT to use fat free half and half!  Next time I will use the regular half and half...trying to cut down fat but the fat free wouldn't really allow it to thicken very much.  The taste of the sauce is amazing though!  Will make again!

Simple and yummy! This recipe is pretty simple to make, yet looks and tastes like a dish from a fine dining Italian restaurant! I usually don't write reviews, but I had to for this tasty recipe. 

Instead of heavy whipping cream, I used regular whipping cream to cut down on the fat and used corn starch to thicken the sauce. I also used canned diced tomatoes instead of sun-dried ones and just drained the juices. 

I also used a little more garlic and more basil. YUM!

I love chicken and love pasta, so this seemed like the perfect recipe to me.  Very easy to make, but in all honestly even with much salt and pepper I found it very bland.  I used my own basil from the garden.  Not sure if I will make this again, if I do it will be with some changed to enhance the flavors...

Instead of 1 cup of heavy cream I did 1/2 cup of cream  and 1/2 cup of white wine. I also added mushrooms when I   had them handy. Everyone loves this dish. So simple and  versatile. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipe! I pounded out the chicken, seasoned with salt and pepper, floured it, and fried it for just a few minutes. Put the chicken and the sauce in the oven for about a half hour and it was moist and delicious! Thanks!!

I rated this recipe previously, but decided to give it another shot using jarred sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil. What an ENORMOUS difference this made! I rinsed the tomatoes under hot water (to reduce the fat a little) before dicing, and the sauce was a perfect, yummy pinkish color with a whole lot more flavor and much more appealing than the dark/brownish color the dried tomatoes turn my sauce the first time. Also, I think pounding the chicken before cooking makes for a nicer, more tender chicken (cooks faster, too!). I added a handful of fincely diced shallots to the garlic before sauteeing, topped each serving with crumbled feta (wonderful with the sauce!), and we used angel hair for the pasta. Definitely a keeper and most definitely one to impress guests - mine couldn't get enough!! Thanks so much again!

One of the best chicken recipes I've ever tried. It was easy and SO tasty. I dipped my chicken in milk then lightly breaded them before frying. It made for a nice texture and the chicken held the sauce well when it was served. One other change I made was that I added some white wine to the chicken broth when deglazing the pan and that added a wonderful dimension to the flavour. I will be serving this to guest again and again!

so perfect.  i added green onions for color, and i used a combo of half and half and milk.  i didnt have any fresh basil on hand, so i seasoned the chicken breast with garlic powder, onion powder, basil and salt and pepper and let it sit for 45 mintues while i prepared the other ingredients.  that gave the chicken such good flavor.  also, i omitted the pasta completely and served as an open faced sandwich, with crumbled bacon on top.  yummmmy!

This was a good recipe but I did not see the need to use 2 pots to prepare it.  I cooked the chicken first and then I browned the garlic and added the broth and the rest.  It worked out just fine that way.

This recipe was fantastic.  My husband normally hates tomatoes, but with the sundried flavor, he couldn't stop talking about how good it was throughout the whole meal!  Nice change from regular sauce.  Quick and easy too.
I used the sundried tomatoes in oil and rinsed them first to cut fat.  I also then used half and half and like others said added a teaspoon or two of cornstarch to thicken it.  I had no problems getting it to the right consistency.  Cooked everything in three pots all at once and it was finished in perfect timing.

It might not be much to look at but it's full of intense flavors.  I used full-fat milk to cut down some fat and it still tasted good.

Oh... this is good.  I added a bit more cream than called for so the sauce was runny at first.  After the pasta was drained, I put it back in the warm pot along with the sauce.  Heated over low for a minute thickened it right up.  Tastes just like the dish served at Macaroni Grill -- with the exception of mushrooms, which I suppose could be added.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I made this recipe with a few minor variations and my family absolutely loved it, even my dad who is arguably the pickiest person when it comes to trying new foods. One was I used double the noodles and double the chicken (same amount of sauce). This made it come out with the sauce stretched farther, but more of a Mediterranean-style dish. Two, I chopped fresh thyme with the basil, at an even amount because I love thyme. Lastly, I threw a splash of red wine (around 2oz) in while I was sauteeing the chicken and it made the chicken melt in your mouth. I don't usually cook any particular dish twice, but this one will definitely be cooked again very soon.

I chose this recipe because I had a carton of cream to use and a family pack of chicken breasts. What a perfect recipe this was to try! This was definitely a tasty dish.  You won't get by with just one or two dirty pans - it produces a lot of dirty dishes!  Before I made this recipe, I checked out the other reviews and took notes.  You MUST make a double recipe of the sauce.  The sauce would be enough for maybe just the chicken by itself but if you serve the noodles underneath the chicken, more sauce is needed.  I agree with others that the sauce DOES need to be thickened. I followed a couple of suggestions - I added two big handfuls of parmesean cheese - plus I used cornstarch to thicken it.  Both worked wonderfully. I also added some mushrooms to the sauce when I added the sundried tomatoes.  I might think of cutting back on the sundried tomatoes next time.  Although they do contribute delicious flavor to the dish, there are just a bit too many of them.  I liked another reviewers suggestion about using fresh tomatoes but instead of putting them into the sauce, I sprinkled some chopped tomatoes on top of my chicken & pasta after I plated it.  Yummy! This is a dish that the whole family will enjoy. It's like an alfredo sauce with a bit of spice added.  I recommend it.

Pound the chicken for even thickness, season, and cook on the grill. Sauce: Double the garlic and sun dried tomatoes. Use olive oil instead of butter and vegetable oil. Use 1 cup fat free half and half as well as 1 1/2 cup lowfat milk instead of the heavy cream. Use a mixture of 1 cup olive juice and 1 cup chicken broth. Add 1 1/2 tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce. Use 1 tablespoon of dried basil. Excellent robust sauce!!!

This was a super hit with guests I had over.  I saw in the reviews where it was referenced as "restaurant quality" and funny enough, my guests used that exact term.  I added diced fresh white mushrooms, doubled the sauce ingredients, and added a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch to thicken.  This was a great recipe I'll use again and again with guests.

My family thought this was delicious and I thought it was very easy to prepare. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes so just used fresh Romas, which perhaps took away from some of the flavor, but the sauce was still delicious. I added a little Parmesan just because I like it, and I used bow tie pasta as another reviewer suggested.

I thought this dish was delicious! I added mushrooms like the other reviews suggested and used a little less butter.  I also dipped the chicken in egg white and then in Italian Bread Crumbs w/ garlic salt before pan frying the chicken. The breaded chicken added a little zip to the dish which my family loved. I also ended up adding 2 tbsp of flour to thicken the sauce.  Great recipe!!

I decided to make this, but decided to skip the fettuccini to save a few calories, although that would have been wonderful.  Since I wasn’t going to use the pasta, I didn’t double the sauce as many other reviewers did.  For the chicken broth, I used half broth and half white wine.  I made the sauce ahead of time and simmered it for ten minutes.  I got impatient and decided to add a corn starch/water slurry to thicken it, which worked very well.  I salted and peppered the chicken and then dredged it in a little flour before cooking.  When plating, I put the sauce on the plate and topped it with the chicken.  Delicious!  We loved it, which means it will definitely be repeated!

WOW!  Excellent!!!  Get ready to over-eat.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried instead and it was still wonderful (fresh basil would be fabulous). I used fresh chicken stock and oil-packed sun dried tomatoes.  Do we really care about adding the extra oil when we're already cooking with heavy cream?   So since I was in the fattening mood, I also added fresh grated parmesean cheese to the sauce to thicken it a bit and it was AWESOME.  Next time I'll double this and have left overs.  This was really, REALLY good, and my husband, who hates creamy sauces, loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and very easy!  Seasoned with a little oregano.  Put sliced mushrooms in at same point as the sundried tomatoes.  Used nondairy pareve creamer instead of heavy cream.

This was excellent! I made it for company with all rave reviews. It seemed to take a bit of work, but it was well worth it. I did cut the chicken up and cook it with oil and garlic before adding it to the sauce, to which I added portabellas and white wine (in place of some of the chicken broth), as some reviews wisely suggested! I also used penne pasta, tossed it all together and topped it with parmesan just before serving. Wonderful!

I made this dish exactly as the recipe instructed except that I substituted penne pasta for the fettucini. It was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS - "restaurant quality," as several other reviewers have said. I made it on a regular weeknight but plan to double it and use it for my next dinner party. Hats off to Holly for submitting this prize!

This was very flavorful!  I added more chicken broth and cream to make it extra saucy.  I used a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and added some fresh mushrooms and some capers for that extra zing.  Bowtie pasta and buttery garlic bread went perfectly with this dish... I can't wait to taste the leftovers!

Good for a nice romantic meal with husband or significant other.  My kids were not big fans even when I left out the sundried tomatoes.  But I felt like I was dining on a restaurant style dish!  You may want to double the sauce if you want your pasta to be completely covered.  :)

This dish is one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!!!  I can't believe it came from my kitchen.  The only thing I did different was to double the sauce-I like my pasta juicy.  My 1, 3, and 5 year olds loved the pasta and chicken too - minus the tomatoes, but that is ok, the more for my husband and I!!

This was delicious.  I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup cream to reduce some of the fat and it turned out great.

My fiance and I loved it! Followed the recipe to the "T" and I would like to make some recommendations: use the best sun-dried tomatoes you can find (mine had a strange tangy flavor that eventually cooked out)and make double the sauce if using garlic bread (it deliciously mops up the leftovers!)

Meh. For all that butter and cream it really was boring. I was able to rescue it with a bunch of salt and pepper when served along with a lot of onion powder, garlic powder and oregano. Then I doused it in Chardonnay. Then it was very enjoyable. If I had some Parmesan on hand that probably would have been good. Ditto for some artichoke hearts.

I love this recipe, so easy and so good.  My husband doesn't like sun dried tomatoes but he licked the plate clean.  I followed the recipe exactly, no changes or additions needed.  Will make again.

This was very good.  I made a half-batch which worked out fine except needing to use almost the entire amount of broth to keep the liquid content high enough.  Very good dish.  Add a vegetable and breadsticks, and you've got yourself a meal!

This was a total hit.  Everyone loved this.  It was creamy and fresh tasting.  The sauce was amazing. 

Next time I just need to remember to put the pot of water on first.  Having that as the third step of the recipe is kind of out of order for me, as I did not read this through all the way again before starting, so I had to take the chicken and sauce off the stove to get the noodles cooked.  I'm also going to cut down on the amount of tomatoes, as there were just too many for us.  They got picked out and left on the plate.

All in all, it was a great recipe.

I followed the recipe for the most part. i changed the serving size to 6 and I doubled the sauce (but didn't double the cinnamon).  It was really good but it needed more sauce. Next time I'll triple the sauce.  I also used 4 full chicken breast, used an extra clove of garlic and a full box of fettucini.  Would definitely make again.

Sorry Marbalet, but I cannot rate this with more than one star. Either I did something wrong or this recipe failed to say how salty sun dried tomatoes are. Thank God I did not add any additional salt. I followed this recipe to a tee and it was like eating a salt shaker. Even my husband who is not too picky couldn't eat it. I ended up picking out the tomatoes and tossing them. Let's kiss $4.00 goodbye!! Can someone please tell me if the s/d tomatoes are supposed to be rinsed first?

Made this for my daughters wedding and got RAVE reviews!!!! Only thing I changed was to make dbl the amount of sauce, because it is soooooo yummy!  I made it the night before, due to the fact that I was going to be so busy the day of the wedding, and reheated it in oven @ 300 degrees.  It tasted GREAT, actually the sauce and chicken were even better...just don't over cook chicken the night before!

Just made this for dinner tonight.  We LOVED it!  I sliced the chicken before cooking, just because it says to slice it later anyway.  We love garlic so when I salted and pepperd the chicken I also added some garlic powder.   I cooked the chicken with half a sliced onion (just because we had some to use).  I also doubled the minced garlic for the sauce.  Made this with "Great Garlic Bread" from this site.  Definitely will make again!

I make this recipe at least every two weeks. As per some suggestions, for my husband I bread my chicken with flour, salt, pepper and paprika and fry it up. The sauce alone is great. I substitute fat-free half-n-half for the cream. I'll add a bit of cornstarch whisked with the half-n-half or a couple of tablespoons of cream to thicken. 

**If you attempt with the fat-free half-n-half, be warned, the sauce "breaks" easily. I have to slowly bring it to a simmer and watch it carefully. If it comes to a hard-boil, the sauce will start to separate. The best method I have found is to break the sauce to a simmer, add in the thickening agent (cream or cornstarch slurry) and stir gently. Once it starts to thicken, I add in fresh shredded parmesean. It is more labor-intensive, but worth it to avoid an entire cup of cream.

This was quite good.  I didn't have fresh basil this time of year, so I used dried.   I added fresh Parmesan at the table.  Iused half and half because that was all I had and it was fine.  At the end I needed to thicken the sauce a bit with a small shake of Wondra. I would like to double the sauce next time as it wasn't enough to coat all the pasta.

Of course I didn't read other reviews until AFTER I made it, or I would have known about the sauce.   

I should add, I first cooked the chicken in the pan, then removed it.  Cooked the sauce in that pan.   

This reminded me of a really rich dish from Olive Garden!

This has been sitting in my recipe box for two years.  Wish I had made it earlier.  I took everyone's advice and doubled the sauce since I like a lot of sauce.  It didn't thicken as much as I would've liked though.  Sauce probably could use a little salt, but that is a personel choice.

This recipe was awesome! I made it for the first time for company (luckily it came out good lol) and everyone loved it! I agree with some other reviews...next time i will cook the chicken first, then remove and do the sauce in the same pan then add the chicken towards the end. I would also double the sauce because it was soooo good! I also omitted the salt which I'm glad I did for this dish was salty enough (from the chicken stock) for my taste. Absolutely amazing!

This is my fav Sun Dried Tomato recipe. I’ll start by saying that.  The caveat is I don’t have any others.  That’s my issue more than an indictment against SDT’s.  That said, I also modify the recipe each time I cook it based on what I have.  I use a combination of Fat Free 1/2&1/2 and regular 1/2&1/2 plus a little Corn Starch to reduce the FAT calories and provide a thickened sauce. Today I used Asparagus, Onion, and some Cabbage I had on hand. I also used dried Basil in lieu of going to the grocery store. I also put dried Basil with some pepper and a little salt on the chicken when I cooked it. Mostly, the SDT’s provide enough salt for the recipe. I always use whatever pasta I have on hand…doubling it to 16 Oz to go with extra broth and reduced fat “Cream sauce”.  Point is: use what you have, add extra vegetables, dice the chicken like I did etc…It’s a great foundation or stand alone recipe.

I was not happy with the taste of this.  I won't knock it, I just won't be making it again.  I was really disappointed as all the ingredients sounded great...they just did not pull together well for me.

This is what I have been looking for--an easy Pasta Milano from Macaroni Grill!  Omitted chicken completely.  Added peas for color.  Didn't have heavy cream, so substituted whole milk (+ 1 T. Cornstarch).  Delicious!

If I could give this recipe 50 stars, I would!!! FANTASTIC dish. I recommend using the sun-dried tomatoes in oil in a jar, then use that oil to saute the garlic, onions, and mushrooms (additions added by me). Use one pan and cook the chicken in the sauce as it is reducing. You absolutely must double this recipe in order to have enough. I also added capers near the end and that was great. Wonderful, tasty, and very gourmet!

Fantastic recipe! Me and my brother made this today for Mother's Day - we followed the recommendations to double the sauce (do it, you'll need it), as well as the suggestions to add some mushrooms and cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It worked out fantastically...my mom loved it (and she, being very much into cooking and having taught cooking lessons before, is pretty picky about food) and my brother and I both thought it was great as well.

The only thing I would warn people about is be careful when seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper - we added a little too much salt to the chicken and the entire dish ended up being slightly too salty but if you're just careful with that, it should turn out perfect. Recommended and I am bookmarking this recipe for future use!

My brother (and he's stingy with praise! :) ) actually complimented me for this dish. So, here are the only changes I made to the recipe to make it 5-star: Double the sauce; if you love sun-dried tomatoes like I do, feel free to add 1/4 or more extra like I did (extra on the garlic, too); cut the chicken into strips or chunks prior to cooking them to make things easier; finally, toss in sliced mushrooms into the sauce before you add in the pan juice/broth mix so that the mushrooms have time to soften. I ended up mixing the chicken in the sauce and adding all of it to the pasta. This is so good!

I've been a member for 2 years, and this is my first review.. this dish is so AWESOME, I couldn't resist.  I have made it multiple times and am planning to make it again next week for guests.  I added mushrooms, and green onions and also doubled the sauce.  One of my favorite recipes!!

This was a great meal, everyone loved it and even wanted to see the recipe. The sauce for me was not runny but you definatly have to let it boil for a long time to get it thickened (that could be due to my substitutions!). I followed some of the others recommendations.  I doubled the sauce (It could have even used more).  I used 1 % milk (2 cups) and 2 tsp of cornstarch instead of heavy cream. Plus I did not have sundried tomatoes in the house so, I cut up tomatoes (3 roma) and cooked them in the oven for 20 minutes (I checked them every 5 minutes and mixed them around). Plus, I added fresh mushrooms, fresh spinach, and scallions to it (cooked seperatly after the chicken and then added it to the chicken).  My husband loved it and wants me to added it as a regular dish.  Next time I make it I will add a little wine to the sauce and parmasan cheese.

A truly, truly delicious recipe.  DH rated it a keeper after only one bite.  I think I am going to make the sauce again tonight - even my picky kids liked it (they never eat anything they don't recognize, ie sundried tomatoes)  Made it exactly as the recipe states and I don't think it needs any tinkering at all!  Thank you, Holly, for the wonderful recipe!

This is the best recipe EVER, but I reserve it for special occasions only.  Also, I started adding about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, which is great!  Tastes like chicken alfredo with sundried tomatoes in it!

YUM YUM!!!  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for, just like the Pasta Milano at Macaroni Grill.  It was absolutely divine!  Next time I will make more sauce (with more garlic!) and maybe use less chicken.  This is now one of my favorite recipes.  Thanks Holly!

Hooray!  I've finally found the recipe for my favorite dish,"Pasta Milano", from The Macaroni Grill.  The only thing I did to make it exactly the same as the restaurant dish was to add some sliced mushrooms,slice the chicken thinly, and toss everything with farfalle noodles instead of fettucini. YUMMY!

I threw in some spinach that I quickly sauted with the chicken.  Delicious!  This meal is completed with some crusty bread and a fresh green salad.

Here is what I did to simplify this recipe, I used two huge breasts that I pounded to 1/2 inch and cut in half. I took another reviewers advice and marinated them in buttermilk for about four hours. I then took a 1/2 cup of flour and added paprika, garlic powder and salt and pepper, took the chicken out of buttermilk and dredged it in the flour. I used jarred sun dried tomatoes that were in olive oil, so I used the oil from the jar to saute my chicken. After chicken was browned I removed it and drained the liquid except for about 1 Tbs. I added my chopped garlic and sauteed a minute or two. I then added a cup of white wine (Sauvignon Blanc) to deglaze the pan, added a cup of chicken broth and the 1/2 cup of chopped tomatoes and simmered for a few minutes. Then I added two cups of heavy cream and a 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a lil zing, and reduced it till it was nice and creamy, added my chopped basil and chicken, which I sliced up while sauce was reducing and heated it through. Served over a bed of angel hair pasta with garlic bread. Made three plates and there was plenty of sauce for all three...I like my pasta with lots of sauce. Looked and tasted like it was from a 5 star restaurant!

Delicious! Served it over rice instead of pasta as we usually do in Brazil and it was great! I've made it twice, actually. But the second time i didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I used carrots and mushrooms... Still a great sauce! And I think it would work with any "meatier" vegies.

This was a little rich for my taste. Be careful not to cook the sauce for too long, it reduces down rather quickly.

Looks a little sketch while making the sauce but stay with it, turned out great. Used a pinch of flour in the sauce to thicken it a little more. Fresh basil is really a difference maker

Great dish!  Adding it to the list of meals we make on a regular basis!  Didn't think it was too rich at all since the sun-dried tomatoes cut the richness.  After setting aside the chicken, I added it back to the sauce to coat and to warm it.

I made this recipe exactly the way it is written and it was delicious! My daughter even commented that it tasted like restaurant food! I took that as a compliment! Next time I might try using light cream to cut the fat. I will also double the recipe for my family. We could have used a bit more cream sauce. This recipe was simple & not very time consuming either. Definitely worth trying!

Best recipe I've stolen yet! I followed the video precisely. You can taste how important it is to use sundried tomatoes (rather than any other kind) and FRESH basil. It was something that I would have chosen as a "favorite" in a restaurant.

I followed the recipie exactly and it turned out amazing. The only thing I would do different is double the sauce recipie because it was so good and there didn't seem to be enough of it to cover all of the chicken and pasta! I made The Best Bruchetta Ever (also from All Recipies) to go along with it. I will definitely make this again in the future!

Oh my goodness, this is AWESOME!!! I'd give it more stars if I could & so would my husband and family. I don't think anyone who wouldn't like it unless they don't like white cream sauces. I went by the recipe 100%, didn't change a thing. The sun-dried tomatos were so good and sweet, it went perfect with the sauce and such a nice change. The only thing I'd do different next time is make more sauce, but I don't have to because it makes enough. I'd just want more because it's so good. Thank YOU so much for sharing this recipe with us. A+ all the way!!!

This was very good.  I prepared exactly as suggested.  The sauce needed salt.  Other than that it was very good.

Not bad! My hubs and I have been eating out a lot lately (we just returned from a 2 week vacation). We both were craving a home-cooked meal tonight, but I had limited time to prepare one. When I stumbled upon this recipe, I knew I had to give it a try. Not only did this call for ingredients I knew my grocer would have available late on a Sunday evening, it also was SUPER easy to prepare. My only regret is not dredging my chicken as many others have done. Doing this would have given it a nice sear (this is my only complaint about this recipe). To speed prep, I picked up a package of chicken cutlets (they cook quicker and more evenly, IMHO). Other than that, I followed MARBALET's directions to a T. I found cooking my chicken 4 minutes per side was spot on. My only suggestion (really my hubs' suggestion) is to use less tomatoes or strain them out of the sauce next time. We both felt they slighly overpowered the dish. NOTE: For those of you who feel there is not enough sauce, please be sure you are not over reducing it (i.e. cooking too long). I had plenty to toss with my pasta and over my chicken. For a nice touch, I garnished our plates with some leftover basil. Served with foccacia bread, this was a lovely meal. Thanks for sharing, MARBALET! :-)

OMG amazing...we were craving a high quality pasta dish, but didn't want to go out..This was perfect..I added some finely minced onion with the garlic  and at the end added a few capers to the sauce..I cooked the chicken first and put it in micro to keep warm..then made the sauce in that pan...awesome!

This was so delicious, it reminded me of a restaurant dish!  I would definitely add more garlic, and maybe some mushrooms to this already delectable dish.

This recipe was very good. (I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the heavy cream - works the same and has less fat & calories.) Next time I'll double the sauce and add fresh mushrooms. I did use sun-dried tomatoes per the recipe, but they tasted too strong and a little sour in the final result. I'll try the ones in oil next time.

Awesome flavored sauce!I was a little leery about using sun-dried tomatoes, as I have never used them before, and I'm glad I tried them. As far as I know I followed this recipe exactly. In the directions it said the sauce should stick to the back of a spoon.Mine did, but there was very little stickability when it came time to cling to the pasta or chicken. But this sauce is so tasty, and I wiped my plate clean with Italian bread. Will definitely make this again, hoping that if I made a mistake, I won't make it again!

This dish was fantastic! It was very simple. I altered just a tad by using smoked sun dried tomatoes and about 1/4 cup fresh crumbled blue cheese. My family was impressed and I will make it often. I served w/ garlic bread.

I made this dish last night.  I was fearful of the sauce not being enough so I double that part of the recipe.  I also double the pasta (just because it was a 16 ounce box knowing I could use the extra pasta for something else)  No need to double the sauce this recipe is very proportionate in ratio sauce to pasta.  So we now have enough to reheat today.  My entire family loved it.  It is very easy to make.  It is a very flavorful dish.  It is also not as "heavy" as expected considering the cream.  I think the broth helped to break through that.  Make and enjoy!!!

Fantastic, easy and fast! I started by cooking the chicken in a skillet, then used the same skillet for my garlic and sun-dried tomatoes. Added 2 zucchinis and 1C of milk, otherwise per recipe. Can't wait to have the left overs tonight!

THIS WAS DELICIOUS! Thank  you for sharing. Used boneless skinless chicken thighs and sliced them up before cooking to save time. Also added some fresh spinach and sauteed in the drippings/broth. Served over whole wheat penne! Will definitely be making again.

Great recipe.  I cut out some fat by using canned milk instead of cream....still VERY tasty.  Instead of fettuccini, I used homemade noodles.  I freeze dehydrated halved grape tomatoes from our garden every year, they are perfect instead of buying the expensive sun dried tomatoes.

Fantastic!  We made this for company and it couldn't have been more tasty.  It does take some time but it is worth all the effort.  We used the recipe exactly as written.  The sauce is so good (make extra)!  This is just as good as anything in a good italian restaurant.  We will definitely make this recipe again.

We enjoyed these but didn't really have too much flavor even though I added parmesan and used sun-dried tomato packed in oil (squeezed out some oil). Definetly double the sauce and maybe sub the tomatoes. Oh, I also used a medium size shell like 'conchiglioni'.

So good!! I used half and half and ended up using a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken it up because it was a bit thin. I also deglazed the pan with white wine to extend the sauce a bit, otherwise there wouldnt have been enough to cover the noodles.

I really liked this recipe. I made it for my whole family and they loved it. Personally I am not crazy about sun dried tomatos so when I make it again I may use roasted peppers, but that is just me. The sauce was excellent. I made it all in one pan and added mushrooms. Excellent.

Fabulous recipe! I had a guest over for dinner and I wanted to make something yummy and different. The sun-dried tomatoes made this dish a 10 for me! I was wondered there wouldn't be enough sauce but it was just right. I received many compliments and everyone loved it very much. Paired it with the recommended chardonnay and a side salad consisting of spinach leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers and mushrooms with dressing of choice. An excellent meal!

Very good and absolutely restaurant quality.  Only gave it 4 Stars because of difficulty of preparation, and by that I mean it took a lot of dishes and pretty fair amount of time (30 mins or more).  Well worth it, but not something you could make regularly.  Throw some parmesan/mozzarella cheese on top for a little extra flavor (and calories!).  I had trouble getting my sauce to thicken, so I threw a dash of flour in to help it along and it worked nicely.  I will bake the chicken next time to cut down on calories.  Definitely double the recipe if you're feeding more than 2 people and/or are not serving anything on the side.  I doubled it, didn't serve anything on the side and we nearly finished it, and we are not big eaters.  Overall a great special occasion or "date night in" recipe.  *edit* I also used fire roasted tomatoes instead of sundried - only reason being the fire roasted were .99 and sundried were almost $4.  I realize they're different flavors, but it was still great!

This is a simple recipe and easy to make - but, wow what flavor!  I used the sundried tomatoes that are packed in oil instead of the regular dried ones, but, I press them in a paper towel to get out the excess oil.  That way I get all the flavor from the marinated tomatoes - but, not the excess oil.  I also pound out the chicken until almost doubled in size for even cooking.  I also slice my chicken in thick slices and put back into the sauce instead of cutting in 3 pieces. Simple recipe - but, full of flavor.

Very delicious and easy, a definite keeper.  I did make changes so that it's even easier.  I used a 16oz. jar of Classico Sun Dried Tomato Pesto instead of the separate tomatoes and basil.  Also, I cooked the chicken first in a skillet with oil, and then proceeded with making the sauce in the same skillet.  The chicken breasts I use don't cook in 8 minutes, but I brown them and finish in the oven to 160 degrees.  The chicken is finishing up in the oven, the sauce is being made in the same pan, and the fettucini is cooking.....can't get much easier and tastier than that!

We made this tonight when I typed in ingredients I had I wanted to use: chicken, fresh basil, sundried tomatoes, pasta. This is definitely a restaurant quality dish. We followed the directions to a T, only I had half-and-half and no heavy cream so I did a little thickening with flour when it called to heat up remaining chicken broth with the skillet drippings. (I added another pat of butter with some EVOO then the flour, stirred, and followed with the broth. I also used some reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce to our liking.)  Easy dish, pleasing to the taste buds, and QUICK! We didn't have any hard cheese like parmesan, asiago, etc., but I did crumble some plain goat cheese over the chicken and sauce as garnish. That just knocked this recipe out of the park!  A keeper, no doubt!

I saved this recipe a long time ago and just made it last night.  It was so good I wish I had made it sooner.  I used Whole Wheat pasta for added protein and fiber.  I wish I had doubled the sauce because it was delicious.  I highly recommend that you chop the sun dried tomatoes.  I didn't and they were impossible to cut after cooking.  I used thin sliced boneless skinless chicken breasts so I didn't have to pound them.  Next time will season the chicken with more than just salt and pepper.  Also I recommend using low sodium chicken broth - to lower the salt content   I will also try with half and half next time as some reviewers noted to save on the fat and calories.  BUT overall this is so good - I will be making this again and again!

This is awesome!!!  My husband loved it!!!  I did double the recipe though as others recommended. At a local restaurant they have something very similar to this but using lobster so I think next time I'll try that just to try it.

I thought this recipe was ok...I've made much better pasta sauce in the past. It was WAY too thin!  There was no cornstarch, flour or parmesean cheese to thicken the sauce...I just don't get it and I am NOT a beginner. ?

I loved it! Even the picky husband who does not eat sundried tomatos ate it happily! I diced my chicken beforehand and did it all in one pot doing the chik first , taking it out hen doing the rest. It was fantastic! I also added mushrooms.

This is great but I think it's even better when substituted with bowtie/farfale pasta and sun dried tomato alfredo sauce from the store, and red pepper flakes or a little cayenne for zip!

this was a great recipe. I did do as others suggested and added 2 cups of whipping cream and 1 cup of broth to make extra sauce. I wanted to simmer the chicken and noodles together for a while so its not necessary. Next time I think I will leave out the sun dried tomatoes and do with a can of diced. I got rave reviews on this one from the family and we almost didn't have enough!

Only used one tblspoon of basil and it was plenty. Added extra chicken broth and heavy cream to make extra sauce like other reviewers said. Also added some grated parmesan cheese and 2 tspoons of cornstarch to thicken. I used heirlooms tomatoes instead of sun dried tomatoes and also used cup of mushrooms and spinach. I threw shrimp in the sauce at the very end. I have served this over fettucini and bow tie. Delicious and a crowd pleaser!

I have made this recipe three times now.  The 1st time I made it I followed the advice of reviewers INSTEAD of trying the recipe exactly.  We didn't enjoy the meal.  I gave the recipe another chance and followed it as written.  YUM!  I follow the recipe exactly now.

One of the best recipes I've found on this site! I've made this several times with several variations and it has turned out absolutely delicious every time!! 

This recipe is perfectly fine the way it is but I usually double the sauce portions because I can't get enough of this delicious sauce!

Here are a few variations I've had success with:
-add a small can of chopped portobella mushrooms along with the tomatoes.
-add a few splashes of dry white wine to the broth before you bring to a boil.
-I always add 1/4 cup of finely grated romano cheese to the reduced cream sauce.
-instead of pasta you can serve this on a bed of flavored rice (tomato-basil).

This was so good and so beautiful. I took some suggestions from others and used oil packed tomatoes. Drained the oil and then used it for browning the chicken. After plating the dish I put a sprig of basil on top and it looked super nice. This meal really impressed all guests (especially the bithday girl) and even the non-tomato fans (like my husband and I). Thanks!

This is actually one of my favorite recipes, though I think the directions make the recipe seem far too complicated. I add mushrooms to the butter and garlic in the first step and pretty much skip step #3...it always turns out great!

All I can say is WOW!! This was delicious.  My husband is very picky and there are many things that I may like that he still won't.  He really liked this and said to mark it as a keeper.  He later added this was A+.  Next time we will make with scallops, shrimp, and crab.  Definitely double the sauce. I added white wine and a little dried parsley.  It was fabulous. I followed the advice of a reviewer and fried the chicken in the oil from the tomatoes.  I think this added a lot of flavor. Thanks again for a recipe I will make again and again.

This was an outstanding tasting dish and personnally fun for me!  Like others I added mushrooms, green onions, used 1/2 and 1/2 and doubled the sauce.  Next time I make this and there will be a next time I'm going to make a little more sauce than double, add artichokes and use some white wine.  Fun because - 1. It was the first time I ever made anything with sun-dried tomatoes. 2. I actually got a chance to use the basil in my container garden for cooking!

This was very good but I wish I would have read the reviews.  You really need to double up on the sauce because there is barely enough to cover the noodles.  I ended up putting my food on hold while I whipped up another batch of the sauce.  The other thing I would change is to cut the chicken in slices first and then cook.  Because the chicken breast varied in thickness, some of the chicken got a little too dried out.  Taste was very good.  Served with a warm garlic infused bread.  Thanks

Tried it last night for the first time and it was really good. I impressed myself actually! A few suggestions of mine. If you don't like the heavier pasta, try linguini. I used the fettucini, but I think I'll try something not so heavy next time. Also, if you like a 'kick' to your food, try sprinkling some kind of cajun seasoning to it. I used Tony Chacher's creole spice. Also, if you are looking for presentation, keep a few pieces of the fresh basil for the end of cooking the sauce. It keeps it's color a bit better if you add it at the end, and adds a pretty festive look to the final dish.
This will be one of my regulars now though.

Great dish!  Hubby told me to put this one on the "keeper" list for sure!  I followed the recipe as written except for a couple of things.  I used fat free half-n-half instead of cream, and I sauteed some sliced mushrooms and added them to the cream mixture.  I also thickened the mixture using about 1/2 tsp. of corn starch in just a bit of water.  I sliced the chicken breast and layed it atop the noodles, and spooned on the sauce.  It was beautiful and made the house smell great!  Served it with warm French bread.  Really restaurant quality -- thanks for this one!

This was really good, but it didn't blow me away.  It was kind of time-consuming to make with all those steps.  I've never cooked with sun-dried tomatoes before, so that was interesting.  I used whole-wheat fettucini.  Another yummy dish using my fresh basil!

This recipe is awesome! I took some of the advice of other reviewers and it turned out great. Doubled the sauce, dredged the chicken in flour before cooking and added parmesan cheese to the sauce. This dish will be a regular at our house.

This was pretty good.  I tweaked it a bit, though.  I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes in our commissary, so I picked up the DelMonte Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes and used them including their juices.  I doubled the sauce recipe, but only used ONE tablespoon of basil.  One Tbsp seemed to be the perfect amount since basil seems to be overpowering at times.  The finished product was pretty good, but it tasted like it was missing something.... I think next time I'll play with some other spices... probably add a lot more garlic!  This is going into my recipe box!!  OH!... I also added a splash of Chardonnay and Vodka.

I made this dish one night after work and this is going into the regular rotation! It was quick, easy, and most satisfying! I'm ready to have it again and I just made it two nights ago. There weren't any leftovers... I didn't follow the preparation methods word for word, it seemed like a lot of unnecessary steps. I just browned the chicken in a large pan, removed the chicken and made the sauce in the pan and tossed everything together. As long as you wait until the LAST minute to add the basil, everything comes out fine. There are also so many options to add to this. 5 stars all the way around!

This was excellent! I did make some alterations though. I added about twice as much fresh basil, used olive oil marinated sun dried tomatoes as fresh are far too tough and flavorless. I used about 6 cloves of roasted garlic and added about 1/4 cup of red wine to the sauce. Once the sauce was thick I added about 1/3 cup of parmasean/romano cheese. That's the emain thing this sauce needed to flavor it up more! I used salt and groudn pepper as well. This recipe should just be for the sauce cause this can be used on any pasta or meat dish. I sed my Quorn meatless breaded chicken (the best faux chicken out there) over a bed of fettucini and it was excellent!!!! This sauce would even make a great soup!

My wife and I have been going to a local Italian restaurant (www.biagios.ca) that serves a dish called Milano.  It is "Linguine with grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and snow peas".  I decided to search the internet to find a similar and found this one.  I cooked it exactly as the recipe states, except I added snow peas.  It tastes just like at the restaurant.  Delicious.  We still go to Biagio's, but now we can enjoy one of their recipes at home.  I highly recomment trying it with snow peas.  It adds a bit of colour and a nice vegetable crunch.

Pasta Milano is the only thing I ever get at Macaroni Grill.  I love it, so I was so happy to find this recipe.  I made it last night, and it its exactly the same stuff.  One note, though--I used dry basil instead of fresh, so I think mine suffered a little for that.  I would reccommend taking the time/money to get fresh.  But I was really happy with this.

This recipe is outstanding! I am so impressed because my husband will eat anything, but nothing is ever "really good" to him. We had the Chicken Milano dish at Macaroni Grill and I have to say it was almost identical (except for the wood burning stove taste-which I have no idea how to acquire that anyway) Great job Holly, and thanks for being unselfish and sharing it with the rest of us! I'm adding this to my very favorite recipes! Thank You Stephanie

Wonderful flavor, I added roasted red peppers instead of the sundried tomatoes. Will make again and again.

I guess I didn't know what I was going to expect. I wasn't much for this. It could be the sun-dried tomatos. I have had sun-dried tomato sauces (minus the actual tomatos in the sauce) before and I liked it. My husband liked it and so did my 19-month-old son, but I didn't. Go figure! My husband hates tomatos, I love them and yet we feel differently about this dish.

This was the best dish I've made in a long time.  It was awesome just as it is and will definitely make it again.  I do vary the recipe and add brocoli also and some parmesan cheese to thicken up the sauce some.  It does come out a bit too runny sometimes.  I've also served this over porkchops too.  It's a great compliment to pork and shrimp both.

I made this for my family the other night.  It is a wonderful dish.  I sauted mushrooms in a little butter and then added them to the sauce.  It was a nice addition.  My family ate it all. I only had enough sauce for 3 chicken breasts.  Will definitely double the sauce the next time.

What a great recipe! Tasted like a restaurant! There were a few things I didn't have so I substituted in some way. I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted with 3/4 milk and 1/4 butter- still turned out great! Also substituted fresh basil for 3/4 tsp of basil. I'm a big fan of bow tie pasta so I used that instead of fettuccine. I used fresh cherry tomatoes sliced in half instead of dried as well. It all came together very well! Only downside was that it took me about 2 hours from start to finish.

I guess my expectations were raised by the many glowing reviews that this recipe has received.I cannot say that it was excellent.It was good enough. I have tried similar recipes on this site that in my opinion, are better.However, thank you for posting it.

The only change I made was to slice and pound the chicken into medallions and then brined the breasts to ensure moistness.  This was a tasty dish that everyone enjoyed.

Great Recipe! I doubled everything and added green and yellow pepper(large family). Also added extra garlic, some reviews complained of runny sauce, so I reserved 1/4 cup of the chicken broth and mixed one teaspoon of cornstarch in it and poured it when the sauce came to a boil, this thickened it up nicely without it being too gravy like. One of my teens had a friend over and she told her that it was better than going out to eat.  Strong praise indeed from picky teenagers!!Thanks so much for the recipe!

Everyone in my family loved this, even my picky kid cleared his plate. I did make some changes, as usual. Like others. I lightly pounded out the chicken breasts, then floured them with seasoned flour. I browned them inbutter and olive oil, then took them out, added the garlic and some shallots, then the tomatoes. I deglazed the pan with chicken stock  and a bit of Sherry, then reduced it for about 15 minutes. Then I added the cream and cooked it down a bit, thenadded the chicken back into the pan along with some artichoke hearts, and added some fresh parmesan. I let that bubble away whilemy pasta cooked. Added the fresh basil before serving. I did think that there wasn't enough save, but I don't think youreally need to double it, I will just add a bit extra cream and broth next time. And there definitely will be a next time!!

I've been making this recipe for years and now my son makes it for his wife.  It's always been our favorite dish - and I make it exactly as the recipe calls (no dredging chicken in flour).  In the summer I'll grill the chicken instead of sauteeing it.  It's delicious any way you make it!

Pretty much followed the original post with a few minor personal additions. Made it for my parents and grandmother and they lived it. Very easy and quick to make. All together with cooking, prep and plating it took about 35 mins.

This was delicious! I made quite a few changes though. I cooked a 13.5 oz box of whole wheat penne pasta in salted water. I then sprinkled two chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and dredged them in whole wheat pastry flour. I cooked them in a pan with 1 Tbsp of butter and 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Once cooked (about 5 minutes per side), I removed them from the pan. I added 1 more Tbsp of butter, 4 cloves of minced garlic, 2 cups of chicken broth, and 1 cup (3 oz bag) of chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the pan. I allowed the tomatoes to soften for about 10 minutes. Next, I added 2 cups of half & half, 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, and 3 tsp of dried basil. Once the sauce began to thicken, I chopped the chicken and added it to the sauce. I mixed it with the pasta before serving. 

It takes much longer to make than the recipe claims. From start to finish it took an hour to make.

This is a recipe you can serve for company.  It tastes like something you would have in a restaurant.  My kids even liked it, except they did not eat the sundried tomatoes.  I followed the recipe just as is and it was perfect!

This was simply amazing!  I must admit that I used the oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, only because that's all I had and it still turned out so well.  I couldn't stop tasting the sauce!  I had to force myself to stop or there wouldn't have been anything left to put on the pasta!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  This will definitely be made over and over again at my house.

This was absolutely delicious. The only thing I will do next time is cook the sauce w/ the sundried tomatoes and then strain them out. They were not appealing.

So, so good! This is definitely a make-again meal. I took other suggestions and made this in one saute pan. Followed the recipe as is except dipped chicken in seasoned flour prior to pan frying. While the chicken was cooking I soaked my cut sun-dried tomatoes in the chicken stock to make the sauce just a little quicker. I also subbed half and half for the heavy cream since that's what I had on hand. This sauce was the perfect amount for two servings, I would definitely suggest doubling it for four. Once the sauce was done, I melted in 4oz of romano cheese and let it rest off the heat for a couple minutes and it thickened perfectly.Also I LOVE sun-dried tomatoes and I thought the amount in the sauce was quite a lot. Next time will double sauce and leave amt of tomatoes the same. All in all a great recipe, thank you!

Really good...I will use fresh tomatoes next time instead. Fresh basil was great, and I really loved this way of cooking chicken! Nice creamy sauce, but I didn't particularly love the sundried flavor.

I probably shouldn't give this 5 stars, because I won't ever make it as is (I don't like tomatoes), so I have to rate it as I made it. Instead of tomatoes, I used mushrooms, which with the cream sauce, turned out more like cream of mushroom soup. It was DELICIOUS!! My husband said he thought he'd like it better with mushrooms than tomatoes. The chicken was tender and juicy and we loved it! I forgot to do step 3 (next time, I'm sure it'll add even more dimension to an already excellent recipe)! And instead of fettuccine, I served it over the broken spaghetti risotto recipe from this site. This one's a keeper, for sure!

This is probably my favorite thing right now and has been for the last several months since I discovered it. Very flavorful but relatively quick and easy for what I consider to be a restaurant quality pasta dish! I've shared the recipe with several friends and it is always a huge hit with them too.

Awesome!     I tweaked the recipe a bit, and may refine further next time I make it, but it was a very good base.     First, I used left-over rotisserie chicken, shredded.   Sauteed half pound of sliced fresh mushrooms.   For sauce I followed the recipe more or less, but used half cup of skim milk, and half cup of evaporated skim milk for the cream, to save on fat.    When sauce was almost done, added a bit of cornstarch to make thick (since I didn't have the body from the cream.)   Then, I blended sauce with a stick blender - it made a lovely color with the tomatoes, and also made it more thick.   To serve, I combined sauce with rotisserie chicken, mushrooms, and bowtie pasta.     YUM!    I had made a salad w/balsamic dressing, and some of that ran into the pasta on my plate - I think that was the missing element.   Next time I will try it again, but add a couple tablespoons of  balsamic vinegar, and some fresh grated lemon zest.     I can't wait to eat the leftovers!!!!!

the only thing I changed in the sauce is that I put it in the blender to puree the tomatoes after simmering....it had a more intense tomato flavor that way and a pretty pink sauce.

I always try the original recipe before tweaking it just to be fair to the submission. With this recipe, my entire family loved it! I think the original recipe allows for a little asparagus, or even spinach with great results. YUM

Amazing dish. Tasted as good as the restaurants, if not soooo much better, knowing what ingredients you've put into it! Honestly- this dish is delicious. It tasted even better the next day after I heated up the leftovers in the microwave. Out of necessity, I used tenders instead of breasts, and put it over penne pasta and not fettuccini, and it made no difference taste wise, of course.

I used neufetchal cheese instead of the heavy cream and regular tomatoes since that is what I had on hand.  It still came out really good and much healthier.

This recipe seemed difficult to me at first, but ended up not being too hard. I was a little iffy about the sun dried tomatoes, but they ended up being a nice twist in this dish. The sauce was very good! Next time I make it I think I might make a little extra sauce.

Very delicious. If you're looking for an easy meal to make, this is definitely not it. But if you can multitask really well and have some patience, this dish is worth it in flavor and sophistication.

Wonderful recipe. Following others' lead, I doubled the sauce; also first, pounded the chicken and soaked in buttermilk for 1/2 hour, then dredged in flour (with salt, pepper & paprika). And after cooking chicken, used the same pan to saute garlic and then follow the remaining recipe. I agree with others that the only way to improve the recipe would be to add some white wine when cooking the tomatoes. It was delicious without it, however. Thank you, Marbalet!

The sauce is absolutley fabulous! However, I gave it four stars because the sundried tomatoes were way too much. I personally don't care for the tangy taste. Everyone else loved it with the tomatoes. Next time I will use the oil-packed instead of the non-oil packed although the recipe says not to use them. At the very least I would cut down on the amount of tomatoes, use fresh or just omit them altogether. This would also be great with mushrooms. I also served the chicken on the side. Excellent recipe and a keeper for sure.

For dietary reasons, I substituted olive oil for the butter and coconut milk for the cream. It worked out very well the first day, but when I re-heated the next day, it was a bit off. Possibly because I used coconut milk instead of cream? I also didn't make pasta for this dish. I think if pasta were to be added, the sauce would need to be increased. Simple, tasty dish.

This was a good change of pace for Italian night.  The only thing I changed was that I used chopped Roma tomatoes instead of sundried.  Taste preference.  I also made zucchini fritters with fresh basil from this site.  Will make again.

This recipe was delicious. I wish there was a little more sauce though for the pasta. I added white wine to stretch the sauce a little more. It added some great flavor. I gave it 4 stars though because it was very rich. I couldn't eat anymore after a certain point. I'm not a big creamy sauce fan though.

I followed this recipe exactly except I added some veggies and cayenne pepper.  Next time, I would add some cornstarch to the sauce as we like a thicker sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

AMAZING. I loved it and my boyfriend who is about as picky as a toddler absolutely loved it. I used a whole box of noodles which is alot for two people so if you do that then double the sauce. I wouldn't change a thing =]

This was Very delicious!!!  The only thing I have to say about it is there is no way it only takes 4 mins on each side of the chicken to cook it through all the way!  It took me about 15-20 mins to cook the chicken, which wasn't a big deal.  Very yummy!  Husband kept saying "This is awesome" through almost every bite!

I made this for my husband two weeks ago, and he asked me to make it again last week.  I don't follow he recipe to the "t", but basically it is the same.  I use more garlic and add extra sun-dried tomatoes.  The first time I made it, I forgot to put the fresh basil in, so I have eliminated that altogether.  Very yummy!!  Will definitely keep this recipe close at hand.

This dish Is delish and so simple!!!!!!!!!!!! I did minor changes like I cut the chicken up into bite size pieces and just before the cream sauce was done I put the chicken in the cream sauce to heat through. When everything was finished I put the pasta in the sauce pan and let it sit for about 5 minutes so the pasta could suck up all the sauce! Its not to heavy either! You could also substitute  parsley instead of basil, i think it would be even better with parsley. Would most defiantly make again !!

I really enjoyed this dish. The directions are very simple. I think that I may try adding some crsipy pancetta to it next time for a little crunch. This  will be a dish I will refer to friends and keep in my recipe book.

I never do a review comment but this is truly a keeper. Easy to prepare and delicious.  1st time I always make it as written-then alter as to my taste (would add a splash of white wine next time).

I will admit I never leave reviews but this one is SPECTACULAR!!! It really does taste like a meal right out of a restaurant. I only made two changes. One was to pound the chicken flat and the other was to add extra sundried tomatoes. I am going to double the amount next time. It was SOOOO delicious. I can't wait to make it again. I might try using 1/2 & 1/2 next time instead of heavy cream like another person mentioned. Also, cut the chicken into bite size strips. I made w/ penne and it was TO DIE FOR. Enjoy :)

My family all enjoyed this recipe...quite the feat for my family!  Chicken had a nice flavor.  Sauce was really good...even better leftover!  I used petite diced tomatoes, rather than the sun-dried tomatoes, since I knew my family wouldn't like them.  Will definitely fix this again!

Absolutely delicious and a family favorite. Be sure to add some sort of greens like spinach for some color. It really makes the dish look more appealing and irresistible.

It was ok but needs some help.  The sauce was thin and I definitely wish I took others' advice and doubled it, maybe with some corn starch to thicken.  I love garlic so doubled the garlic and still thought it could use more and maybe more sun dried tomatoes too.  It has the right flavors just needs more. Could see the tweaked recipe working with shrimp really well.

Absolutely delicious!  Followed recipe exactly, except added a little thyme to the chicken.  Not sure why some reviewers called it bland or had little success.  Make sure you use heavy cream (as in heavy whipping cream).  Only seasoning really needed is a little salt and pepper.  Not a recipe for those who can't multi-task in the kitchen, however.  In those cases, simply make the sauce ahead of time and refrigerate.  Wonderful recipe!

This was amazing, I read the reviews before I made it and made a few small changes... I doubled all ingredients add white wine, crushed red peppers(for a little kick) also parmesan cheese, I really like basil so I probably trippled that. I also put garlic salt on my chicken before cooking Then
 cut my chicken in slices and added it to my sauce

Maybe we just don't care for sun dried tomatoes but we did not like the sauce at all.  The chicken breasts were good but definetly will not make again.  Followed directions but did double sauce.

This is an amazing dish! We do NOT like using the packaged sundried tomatoes. Added bonus to the oil packed is that we use the oil from the jar with a dab of real butter to cook the chicken in. Also, i sprinkle the chicken with salt, pepper and adobo seasoning. Agree with the others about doubling the sauce recipe, comes in handy to prevent dryness too when reheating.

The only change I made to this recipe was that I used only about 1/4 cup of dried tomatoes. I was having a heck of a time chopping them so after half way I figured it was close enough. It was a very good meal just the same. I will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious and will be used over and over.  I did make some changes.... I used half and half instead of the heavy cream.  The sauce wasn't as thick, but the flavor was still there.  I also used whole wheat pasta.

This was very good.  I substituted skim milk for the heavy cream to cut down on fat.  I also substitued olive oil for the butter.  The sauce was maybe a little thinner than it would have been had I followed the recipe exactly but it was still very tasty and healthier.

Made this tonight...I curdled the cream a bit but that was my own fault.  The taste was great and I am definitely going to make this again.  I added some lemon juice as well which I thought added a nice additional taste as well.

This is a good recipe.  We're moving so I was looking to use up some things in the cupboard.  I added extra sun dried tomatoes (not the kind packed in oil) and used 2/3 cup milk, 1/3 cup chardonnay, and cornstarch instead of heavy cream to make a bit healthier.  I also sliced up the chicken and rolled into some seasoned flour (salt, pepper, paprika) before browning it.    I thought something was missing but it might be just the fact that the extra sun dried tomatoes were a bit overpowering.  Next time I'll make with only the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe.

Wonderful. I did, however, add some fresh sliced/chopped vegies to it during the garlic stage, and found an easy way around not having sundried tomatoes: I used Lawry's Mediterrean Sundried Tomato & Garlic Chicken spices & Seasonings packet. I also used organic half&half in lieu of heavy cream. Five stars with my additions.

I make this at least twice a month. My husband LOVES it. I add in a few extra sun dried tomatoes and thicken the sauce with some cornstarch in the end to make it stick to the pasta better. Yummy

When I added the chicken broth I then reduced it by half.  When reduced, I stirred in about 2 Tbsp of basil pesto, 1/2 grated Parmesan cheese and the cream.  I added the chicken back in and heated through and tossed with bowtie pasta.  Everyone enjoyed it (even my picky 2 and 4 year old)!

This is a very simple dish to prepare and full of flavor.  One thing I always do with chicken breast is pound it to an even thickness.  Not only does it cook quicker and more evenly, it gives it a more delicate texture.  We put the chicken slices back in the sauce for serving over the pasta.

WOW.  This is a keeper.  I always try to make recipes just as listed but I was out of a couple items.  I used white wine instead of chicken broth; Sun dried tomatoes in oil, drained. After tasting the divine sauce, I was on a roll and felt like a barefoot and pregnant real italian girl. I sliced and floured the chicken before cooking it in equal parts of butter and olive oil. Yum from a different italian recipe I love. Sauce needs to be doubled - and yes, I think sliced fresh mushrooms would have been nice to add. BUT - I highly recommend making it just like it is because I know it would be great.  Then have fun Italianing it up because with you can't really go wrong, no matter what extras you add.

My sauce never thickened up. The taste was good, but it was a VERY thin sauce. Sliced my chicken up put it over pasta and "watered" it down with sauce - it just didn't work. Family voted thumbs down.

Very good.  I was really trying to like sun-dried tomatoes but I just don't.  I think it's their texture.  The sauce would not be right if you leave them out.  I will make this again but leave the 'maters big enough to pick around.  Doubling the sauce is a must if you like it saucy.  Adding grated parm to the sauce just turns it into Alfredo Sauce.  I did add mushrooms though.  I mixed the bite size chicken, sauce and noodles all together and sprinkles shredded parm (not grated) to the top of the bowl.  Nice!

Followed the recipe just as written. Amazing. My whole family loved it. I have 4 kids, 14,9,5,3 and they all liked it. Only thing was that they didn't really care for the sun dried tomatoes and picked them off to the side, which made me think to chop them super fine next time so they eat them. I doubled the recipe to serve 8 . Will for sure make it again!

I tried this recipe 6 times. Technically, only for the sauce. The first two time the sauce was creamy and yummy. I used both heavy cream  (1st) and half/half (2nd). The last 4 times the cream did not thicken. I retried it, trying to get it to thicken and I finally realized why the 1/2/ stars reviewers were not able to get a thick and creamy sauce. Simmering the sauce is the best option, do not bring it to a boil when you add in the cream. Also, the acidity from the toasted garlic also makes the cream crudle up instead of thicken. Don't use half and half if you're going to toast the garlic like you're supposed to. To make this recipe as good as it could be, its best if you stick to heavy cream and low/medium heat.

This was great with a few modifications, hence the four star rating. I almost doubled the sauce and added baby bella mushrooms. I threw everything together in a 13 X 9 baking dish noodles, 2/3 of sauce, chicken (I butterflied and pounded thin), then I layered (on top of the chicken) proscuitto and provolone and then the rest of the sauce over everything. Topped with provolone and baked for about 20 min and then under the broiler for a couple minutes... It was wonderful!!

Wow. This one tops the list! Another reviewer said restaurant-quality...and I agree! It takes a little extra time to make (hands-off time though) just waiting for the tomatoes to soften and the cream sauce to thicken - but my does patience pay off!! **Here are my minor changes, just based off what I had on hand: evaporated milk instead of cream, angel hair pasta instead of fettucini - and didn't add all the extra oil to cook the chicken. I only used 2 chicken breasts for the sauce...had a little leftover. I think it would've been too little sauce for 4 people... just my thought. What a winner!! Easy and impressive dish to serve!

My family loves this! The only thing I changed is I used half and half instead of heavy cream and serve it with a baked potatoe instead of pasta.  It comes out great and my 2 & 6 year old eat it all.

This recipe was excellent.  I couldn't believe how much my husband loved it.  I try not to make changes the first time I make a recipe but I broke my rule and instead of using broth at the end I added white wine and reduced it down a bit.  Excellent!

This was really tasty!  I doubled the sauce and had plenty.  I also only used one pan, I browned the chicken and then set it aside; scraped up all the brown bits and started the sauce.  Sadly I didn't have fresh basil and know it would have been even better with it.  I'll definitely keep this in the rotation.  Fast and delicious.  Thank you for posting!

I really liked this one. It was at least as good as the chicken milano I've had at restaurants. Next time I make it I am going to add some red pepper to make it a little spicy and probably double the amount of sauce I make, it was a hit!

Wow!  This was really good!  I wouldn't change a thing except to make more sauce next time.  There are only three of us, so this was enough.  But for a bigger family you would need to double this recipe.  The only thing I did do differently was to cook the chicken in olive oil instead of vegetable, and I browned the chicken slightly.  excellent!  I recommend this recipe to everyone.

I enjoyed this recipe. To cut down on fat and calories, I used a fat free half and half vs. heavy cream. I did use a small amount of cornstarch mixture to add a little thickening to it. I also used a non stick spray when cooking the chicken vs. using oil. This also cut back on fat and calories. The cicken did take longer than 4 min. per side. Delicious!

This was soooo wonderful! My entire family loved it...it reminded us of our favorite little italian restaurant! I was worried that the sauce would be too thin but it ended up perfect when coupled with the filling pasta. The heavy whipping cream gave it the perfect velvety sweetness. I had the sundried tomatoes in olive oil...so I gave them a quick warm rinse and blotted them dry and julienned them really fine. I doubled the recipe because we love sauce and added a little extra garlic and fresh basil. When I reduced the remaining chicken broth I added fresh mushrooms. This meal was truly exquisite and I will be serving it to my dinner guests next week with the addition of fresh crab! Thank you so much for sharing!

Best pasta I've ever had! I doubled the sauce as other users suggested. I also couldn't find any sundried tomatoes, so I used the equivalent of fresh hothouse tomatoes, and the taste was amazing! For an extra topper, I chopped 1/2 C yellow onion, tossed it in some salt and pepper, and pan fried it in some veggie oil. This made the perfect, crispy topper. Didn't marinate the chicken beforehand, but I did make several cuts in each piece to help with absoroption and rubbed it with Nature's Seasoning and Italian seasoning.

This was delicious!!  I doubled the sauce as suggested and thickened it a bit with a cornstarch water mix.  I also added a bit of parmesan cheese to the sauce, and cut the chicken in strips before i sauteed it.  Yum, came out perfect!

This dinner was very easy to make and tasted excellent.  I served it with a crusty bread and a salad.  Even the kids liked this.

We like this with some modifications.  I used two small diced fresh tomatoes instead of the sundried. (family does not like the strong taste of sundried.  
I doubled the sauce and doubled, maybe tripled, the garlic!
It was a great hit at our house.  I must have cooked the sauce a little high because the milk broke and was not smooth but tasted great. 
Added 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley at the end and parm cheese.

Pretty good! I did modify just slightly: added about a tablespoon of parmesan cheese. 
The reason I give it four stars is that it took three pans to make it. It didn't produce all that much sauce. 

But I think the sauce can be very flexible...adding mushrooms/artichokes along with the chicken would be good, and I think that it could easily be made vegetarian by sauteeing up a portobello mushroom instead, and using veggie broth.

Though slightly tricky to prepare this meal was a hit with my entire family (picky little brother included).  This Chicken Milano was one of the most "professional" style, restaurant-quality recipes to have graced our household's kitchen.

Great recipe. Doubled the sauce and used a bit of olive oil and some white wine on top of the butter/chicken broth. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes on hand, so I used mushrooms and asparagus and it still turned out very nicely. Used a bit of flour to try and thicken the sauce and served over spaghetti.

Wonderful recipe, however I did make a few changes (I can't help it!).  I roasted 3 cloves of garlic instead of using raw and sauteed the mashed pulp in the butter for a few seconds before adding 1/2c white wine and 1/4c chicken stock along with the sun-dried tomatoes.  While that reduced and the tomatoes softened (I used dry packed tomatoes that I diced, by the way), I started on penne instead of the fettucini and cooked a few chicken tenders that I marinated with balsamic vinegar, oil, and some dried basil.  I added 2 cups of cream instead of 1 and let that thicken with salt, pepper, and a bit of romano and parmesean grated in.  Lastly, I deglazed my chicken pan with another 1/4c of white wine and added that in to the cream sauce.  I tossed the penne in the sauce when it was thick and served the sliced chicken on top, although next time I'll probably just toss the chicken pieces directly into the sauce with the penne since that's what we eventually did.  The roasted garlic and the wine definitely added a nice depth of flavor to the sauce, and with a bit of salt and pepper to perk it up, it was truly a wonderful dish.  Will definitely make it again; thanks for the terrific base recipe!

What a great, easy recipe.  I used a combination of the original recipe and some of the tips from other users.  I would say dredging the chicken in flour, paprika and salt and pepper, and then adding mushrooms were key things to do!  YUM.

This was a good starter recipe, but I think taking some of the advice of cookiequeen made it a 5-star, restaurant quality meal. After cutting up the chicken, I spinkled it with paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. While sautéing 5 cloves of minced garlic and a small minced shallot in 1/4 cup of butter, I dipped each piece of sliced chicken into skim milk and then into flour. I then browned the pieces of chicken on all sides in the butter/garlic mixture. I then added the whole can of chicken broth, 1 cup of white wine, a tablespoon of dried basil, a tablespoon of Italian seasoning, a half tablespoon of salt (I love salt), and only 1/4 cup of sundried tomatoes. I'm not a big fan of sundried tomatoes, and I used the kind that are packed in oil, so that probably had a more pungent flavor than the dry kind. After adding all of these ingredients, I covered and cooked on medium-low for 30 minutes. Then I removed the chicken (covering it with aluminum foil to keep some of its heat) and added 1 pint of heavy cream and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. It took about 20 minutes, boiling and stirring almost constantly, to get it to the thickness I wanted. I then added the chicken back to the pan, heated it through for about 5 minutes, and then I mixed in the cooked fettucini. It was delicious and tasted exactly like something I'd brought home from a restaurant. The leftovers were tasty, too.

I do agree with everybody else, this recipe is VERY VERY good. I added more chicken broth, 1/2 cup marsala wine, and only 2 TS of heavy cream.
I served it with spinach tagliatelle and it was delicius. I thaught the sauce was a bit too salty for my taste so I omited the salt in the pasta water and it turned out great ! Thanks for sharing.

this recipe was great! I didn't have a lot of sundried tomatoes left , so I substituted artichoke hearts and asparagus. definitely agree with doubling the sauce and also added 1 cup white wine as someone did above.  I saved time by cutting the chicken into chunks so it would cook faster (about 2 inch rectangles).  Using unsalted chicken stock is also a good idea, makes it a lot easier to control your seasoning!  I used bow-tie noodles (seemed to go better with smaller chicken pieces).  Will make again for sure- I think almost any vegetable would be good in the sauce, more like a "primavera."

This was very good! I grilled my chicken breasts for a little more flavor and cut them into strips. Also I doubled the sauce and it was still almost not enough. Next time I will triple the sauce. This was a family pleaser! However the prep and cook time were off on this recipe. I found that by letting the sauce simmer longer it thickened quite well. Will make this again for sure! Thanks!

This tasted like something you'd order in a restaurant.  However, my sauce took SO LONG to reduce that I just gave up, so it was on the thin side.  Next time I think I would use half the chicken broth or else add a little cornstrach to speed up the process.  I also think next time I would cut the chicken into small pieces and bread it, or else grill it so it gets a nice shell on it.  But the sun dried tomato flavor was delicious.  I used the kind in oil instead of actual dry ones, so maybe that helps explain why my sauce came out too thin.  **Update: I have made this again using the DRY sun-dried tomatoes and it comes out perfect following the recipe exactly.  Make sure not to use the sun-dried tomatoes in oil!

This was really good and I didn't think it was too taxing on the multi-tasking skills (I was worried about that based on other people's comments.)  I did measure everything out ahead of time which made it much easier to keep up.  I pounded the chicken (would season them more next time), doubled the sauce, added a little extra garlic and also used dried basil because that was all I had.  Next time I will use fresh, the dried was fine but I think the fresh would be much better.  I will also try it with half and half next time too to cut back on the fat.  I may also try using a little wine wine in place of the broth for a little extra flavor.

I thought this was good, but not outstanding.  I also don't like the idea of having to dirty 3 pots.  I think all of this could be done in the frying pan by cooking the chicken first then adding the stock, tomatoes and finally after reduced the cream.  My tomatoes are already soft so boiling them pulverized them.  I'll give it another go with some modifications and let you know how it goes.  Also, I had to cook my chicken a lot longer than the 4 minutes per side, but I didn't thin them out I just left them thicker. One more thing, I fryed the chicken in olive oil not vegtable oil.

incredible.  I put all ingrediants in the crockpot except the cream and basil. I added those ingredients at the end.  I doubled the sauce but did not double the amount of cream, so essentially I used half the cream recommended. It was fantastic.  Oh and I used the sundried tomatoes that come in a jar of oil since that was all the grocery store sold.  It was still fantastic!

Really great dinner for the whole family! I made mine with bow-tie pasta, but otherwise followed the recipe exactally. There are a few pans involved- but don't let that stand in your way. I chose this dish because it called for basic ingredients that I already had in my pantry and only took 45 minutes to prepare, (my kind of meal!) Everyone fought over the leftovers for tomorrows lunch!

This recipe was awesome!!  Very tasty. My only complaint is that it is more work and required more prep time than it appears. However the end result was well worth it. My recommendations would be to definitely double the sauce. Also I used the tip of cooking the chicken in the oil from the tomatoes (I used a big jar of sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, worked great)and this really added flavor. I also used 1 C. chicken broth and 1 C. wine.  I cut the chicken into strips before cooking, and dipped them in egg and italian bread crumbs.  Oh, and I skipped step #3 altogether because the grease after cooking the chicken looked really gross!! (too many burned pieces!) Overall a really good recipe!!  Will definitely make it again!

Definitely going into my recipe box.    I followed some of the tips in "cookiequeen"s suggestions.   Doubling the sauce is a must.  I did add a cup of white wine.  I might even do a bit more next time.    My sundried tomatoes were in a jar soaking in olive oil.  Instead of frying the floured chicken in butter I sauteed them almost all the way cooked in the sundried tomatoe oil and a tablespoon or two of butter.    

I set the chicken aside and cooked the sauce first sauteeing the garlic quickly, followed by a deglazing of the pan with a cup of white wine, then I added the cream and stiring constantly reduced it after about 10 minutes of cooking.  I added the chicken back to the pan and finished cooking it.  Then the fettucini.  At first I thought i had too much sauce.  I like my pasta fairly "dry" and not saucey. But the pasta quickly absorbed it.  I also added some chopped Kalamata Olives for additional flavor.  Next time I'm going to do the olives and artichokes.

Overall, a fairly easy dish.  Only a frying pan dirty and a pot for the fettucini.  My kids and husband also enjoyed it.
Thanks for the recipe and the reviews.

I thought it ws pretty good. I served it to the inlaws who ate every bite..so it must have been good to them. I thought it could use maybe a little bacon or some green veggie..overall a winner and I will make it again.

My family thought this recipe was fantastic! I needed more sauce so I added some more cream and then the sauce was a little thin for me but I just added a little flour while it was in the saucepan, and it thickened right up. I made it a week ago and have recomended it to 2 other people!!

This tastes like something you would order at a restaurant! Excellent! I did add a few mushrooms. I just sauteed them with the garlic at the beginning. This recipe would also be just as good without the chicken.

Highly recommended.  The sauce is excellent--restaurant quality.  We prefer a thicker sauce, so I used a little corn starch, more than I really needed and it became a little too thick, so I thinned to our desired consistency with more chicken broth.  There's a few more steps in this recipe than others, so one needs to keep his wits about him, but this one recieved high praise from everybody in my family.  It's worth the time and trouble.  Chicken Milano with tossed salad and homemade croutons--a simple, but awesome New Years Eve meal!

I make this all the time now! It is so good. To make it a less fattening, I use fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream. The texture isn't the same but it still has great flavor without all the fat.

Not bad.  Sliced chicken breast in half to cook faster and chunked up to add into the sauce.

The flavor of this was terrific.  I did double the sauce ingredients (but not the sun dried tomatoes).  Even my 4 year old ate 2 helpings worth.  I will definitely make this one again!!

I was going to give this recipe 4 stars because I thought I had found it under quick and easy, but since I didn't it really deserves 5 stars.  My husband really like this and I thought it tasted great- was pretty easy to prepare just really wasn't that quick and dirtys a lot of dishes--but worth the effort.

This was the best pasta I had in a long time. I did change it a little with mushrooms added. We found this chicken sausage that we put in the dish by crumbling it up and putting it on top. It made it something that you would order in a restaurant. LOVE IT!!!!

In the words of my 6 year old, "Oh baby, this is something good!"  Absolutely wonderful. Doubled the sauce and added a little cornstarch, otherwise, no changes.

Delicious!  I used a combination of 2% milk and half and half instead of heavy cream and it still thickened up nicely.  Will definitely make this again.

Wow!!  I absolutely love this recipe!  Can't get enough of those yummy sun-dried tomatoes!  I make this dish quite often and never get tired of it.  The recipe calls for dry sun-dried tomatoes but I use the sun-dried tomatoes that are packed in olive oil in a jar and it works out great...I actually add a little bit of the oil into the sauce along with a couple tablespoons of tomato paste and it tastes great!  Also, don't forget the fresh basil it really does complete this dish.  I haven't tried this with fettuccine yet..I use bowtie pasta and I love it so much that I use it everytime....it gives a really pretty presentation.  Everyone must try this dish it's excellent!

This was an excellent recipe.  I prepared this meal for my new wife as our first meal together...whew...what a great choice. The presentation was wonderful (we thought we were at a nice restaurant again). Not only did it taste superb the night we ate it, but it made great leftovers the following day.  I substituted the heavy cream with lowfat milk then added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce; still tasted great. I doubled the sauce (thank God I did) and added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Could not find sun-dried tomatoes in our local stores, so I sliced fresh tomatoes, broiled them in the oven at 200 degrees for about 20 minutes - then diced them to add to the sauce.  Will add a little more garlic next time and will try adding some red wine.  This recipe has been added to our new "family" favorites. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It's truly the sauce that makes this dish.  I chose to bread the chicken like other reviewers suggested and I think that's the way to go.  Like a chicken parm style...perfect with a side of pasta.  Next time I make it, I will probably omit the chicken and make it a strictly pasta dish.  It was just too good with the pasta.  Easy to prepare and delicious.  Thanks.

This has a very good flavour, although I would recommend doubling the sauce. I made it the way the recipe calls for the first time. And since then I have been adding my own touches. I really like it with mushrooms, and also like it with out the chicken. Next time I think I will try adding some sausage. I would highly recommend this, as it is quick and easy, and reheats well. Even though I am a fresh basil lover, I made this with dried basil once, and it was still great! Thank you Holly!!

Excellent recipe find. We used a little extra chicken broth on the first pass and then a little extra heavy cream. I chopped 6 cloves of garlic and that might not have been enough ;-) I used 1 cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes and the sauce simmered longer than the called for 10 minutes. For the chicken, we ran that through a bath of olive oil, salt, pepper and Watkins Italian seasonings before pan frying. Next time I will add a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce and will substitute another pasta noodle, such as bowtie, instead of fettucini. My entire family liked the recipe which is rare indeed! Thanks for sharing what will become a regular in our house. I hope that you will give this a try and enjoy it too!

I used 1 fresh tomato instead of the sundried.  I also had to thicken up the sauce the a flour/water mixture.  It was very good, definately goes in the recipe box!

This recipe is superb! The first time I made it I had no heavy cream, so I made it with bechamel, came out excellent. The second time I made it I made sure I did have heavy cream and it also came out great.  I had to add more garlic though. But other than that, it was excellent! thanks!

We loved this recipe!  We stuck with the recipe except added a little bit more garlic.  Next time, however, I think I will have either less noodles or more chicken.  I'd also like to try another noodle besides fettucine.  Mushrooms would add a nice touch as well.  The sauce is wonderful and the sundried tomatoes just make it!

Very good!  Don't bother using salt to season at all- the sundried tomatoes take care of that.

Unexpected hit!!  I thought for sure they wouldn't like it but I was wrong.  Even my picky eater loved it.  This recipe was easy to make.  Next time, though, I will add more pepper for a little more zip.

This dish was fantastic!  Our entire family (even the picky kids) loved it!  The only variation in the recipe I did was to add an extra clove of garlic because we all like garlic so much.  I will definitely be making this again.

Tastes just like my favorite dish at Macoroni Grill. I added crimini mushrooms and paprika instead of pepper. The sauce needs help in thickening.

This recipe was delicious!!  I added green onions and mushrooms and about 1/4 cup of sour cream to the sauce.  Everyone really enjoyed it, and I'll definitely make it again.

WOW!  This recipe is fantastic.  I, too, had enjoyed this at Macaroni Grill.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the skillet after cooking the chicken.  These sauteed in the broth with the basil (I used dry basil) and then were added to the cream sauce.  As mentioned in a prior review, using farfalle (bow tie) pasta and slicing the chicken thinly make this a true restaurant meal.

This recipe is AWESOME - probably the best dish that I ever made - I was scraping the pan at the end to savor the taste of the sauce.  I took a  plate over to my neighbor who told her brother about the wonderful gourmet meal I had made for her.  Her daughter loved it too!

Very good.  Browned cubed chicken with the cloves and sun dried tomatoes to keep the dirty dishes under control.  I also added 8oz sliced mushrooms.  I deglazed pan with 1c dry white wine before adding the chicken broth.  I removed the chicken prior to adding not quit 2c heavy cream (to compensate for the wine).  After the sauce thickened slightly, I also added a package of fresh spinach before returning the chicken to the sauce. Be sure to add lots of salt and fresh pepper and top with fresh basil.

Deliciously light and filling. The sauce is light and good for weak stomachs. Not too spicy or heavy for picky eaters. Overall a great and very easy weeknight dinner to make.

This is a great, quick, simple recipe What a great recipe, quick and simple. I cooked it just as the recipe states other than using dried tomatoes in oil. I did rinse  the tomatoes a bit so the dish would not be to grease. It was delicious!

This was seriously amazing, the whole family loved it and I have a very picky two year old. I don't know why one of the reviewers said that the chicken was dry, it may have been the way I cooked it but my chicken was very moist and tasty. I did add extra seasonings to the chicken and cooked it with garlic cloves in the pan for some extra flavor.

This was a great recipe; absolutely divine.  We loved the sauce and plan to double it the next time that we make the recipe.  The only thing that I would recommend is having the chicken breast soak in some buttermilk overnight to keep some additional moisture, as ours was slightly dry.  Otherwise, very good.

I have made Chicken Milano a half dozen times in the last few months and each time it is perfect. I would agree with some other reviewers to double the sauce. It is so delicious you will want to have plenty. I did cook the sauce longer than written to thicken a bit but as is posted, this is not suppose to be a thick sauce. I have also made it the day before which worked very well and eaten the leftovers the next day and despite the fact that the pasta does absorb a lot of the sauce it is still delicious. I get constant raves from our regular dinner guests to make it again.

This is a restaurant quality meal. The tomatoes really make the flavor of the sauce, so they cannot be left out. Amazing and relatively easy to make.

Love this recipe. This time I had no sundried tomatoes so used a large can of diced tomatoes, drained, as a substitute (I double the recipe). Also 1 tbls dried basil in place of the 2 tbls fresh. Kids even love the sauce, just not the chunky tomatoes!
2/1/17 made it again. I doubled the sun dried tomatoes and there just seemed to be too many in the sauce. Next time I'll use 1/2-3/4 c.

Fiance said, "Wow, this is restaurant quality." I agree! Doubling the sauce is a good idea. I think thickening it up a bit with corn starch is good, too. I wish I'd have cut the tomatoes a little smaller.  I will definitely serve this at parties.

This was really good! I did what others suggested and cooked the chicken in a skillet and then pulled it out and made the sauce in the same skillet. I substituted nonfat plain Greek yogurt in place of the heavy cream to cut the fat out. It was amazing even without the heavy cream!

Yumbo! I kicked it up with some cayenne pepper, and added some freshly grated pecorino Romano into the sauce. Try it. You'll like it.

Family loved it, even the 4 year old. I finished off my chicken in the oven after searing it and cooking it about halfway. (I would never press down meat while i was cooking, it dries it out). I used the olive oil packed sun-dried tomatoes (drained first, then chopped into strips) and the flavors in there just added a wonderful undertone. All around fantastic, we will be adding this to our regular dinner rotation.

I found the sauce very bland.  I used sundried tomatoes from a bag instead of the ones packed in oil and I don't think they had a lot of flavor.  I will probably try this recipe again with another brand of tomatoes.

Its hard to believe this is so delicious AND easy to make. My grocery store didn't have dry packaged sun-dried tomatoes so I used the oil packed ones. I just patted the oil off them with a paper towel before chopping. The only change I (well, my husband) suggest is to double the sauce. It s way to yummy to not have extra.

I decided not to go with dehydrated sun-dried tomatoes, and instead I went with the ones packed in oil. I also finely chopped the tomatoes and the fresh basil in my Magic Bullet, since my son is afraid of what food might look like if left visible and whole. It came out spectacular tasting. Flavours blended together well, and made for a dish you would want to "serve company", or so my wife said :)

I NEVER write review's on receipes I try, but this one was JUST THAT GOOD!!!! If i could rate it 10 stars I would.  The flavor was amazing!!!  I was shocked I had cooked something this good because I still somewhat consider myself an amateur cook.  I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes so I just chopped up a regular tomatoe and used Mrs. Dash Tomatoe, Basil and Garlic seasoning. WOW!!! This was the definition of Delicious!!!!

Very good. Timing difficult as written but starting all about same time might help. My chicken breast were very large so they took much longer. Next time I will use smaller breast. Loved the flavors in this.  I will make again.

I thought this was just "ok", I probably won't make it again.  It seems like you have to do a lot of work at  the same time.  Cooking chicken while watching the sauce while making the fettuccini.  I was burning my arm trying to get to the back burner while 3 out of the four were working.  Way too much work for the end result.

This was tonights dinner.  The family liked it.  I think next time I'll try a bit more garlic.  It had a great taste but,  as my husband said, with this much color you expect it to explode with flavor.   I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it.

A new favorite! For diet reasons, I used spinach instead of pasta and whipping cream, not heavy.
I coated the chicken in almond flour and pan sauted first. As others said, I used the same pan to make the sauce. 
Can't wait to make it again!

The sauce is very tasty! It took longer than 30 min. to put together.
My family thought the sun-dried tomatoes were tough. I will substitute a a couple Tablespoons of Classico Sun-Dried tomato Pesto in the sauce next time. Love the Flavor!  Served with Steamed Asparagus and Mandarin Orange sections!

Loved this. We mistakenly bought bruschetta (sun-dried and crushed tomatoes, basil and olive oil) instead of sun-dried tomatoes. Other than being a little oily, it was delicious!

I didn't like it at all. Milano is not very tasty. Tho I have heard that there is a sweeter one maybe that one would be better. First time I've made something from this site that we didn't like.

I usually keep sundried tomatoes on hand but didn't have any when I tried this recipe, so I substituted roasted red peppers. To balance out the sweetness of the peppers I opted for a little bit of pesto (drained of a good bit of the olive oil, so as not to mess with the consistency of the cream sauce) instead of the basil. My final change was to add the sliced chicken and al dente pasta (I used spaghetti because I didn't have fettuccine) to the cream sauce, toss, cover and allow to sit for about 5 mins on a very low setting. It turned out great! I will definitely use this recipe (or some variation of it) in the future.

OMG..... As pasta dishes go, this has just shot to the top of my list. If I was served this in a restaurant I don't know if I would leave in a hurry!!! Chicken was sooooo succulent. It says cook 4 minutes each side but I just watched and when the meat changed from pink to white half way up, I turned the meat. I didn't add the extra 1/4 cup of broth as I thought the sauce was tasty enough. Myself, husband and 2 kids came back for a 2nd helping.... which I never do!!! A must for pasta lovers and such a simple dish to make.

Made it per the directions. Be careful not to char the sun dried tomatoes. It actually gives it a smoky flavor if you do. Mine did at it tasted great so if you want a darker smoky sauce get the tomatoes to a little blackened look.

The flavor and richness was fabulous! I even tried to lighten it up a little by using half and half and light butter...didn't matter! Still tasted great! Only thing...be ready to hustle on this recipe. There's a ton of moving pieces and they all require attention at the same time. Get everything prepped beforehand and then just move! Totally worth the sweat and extra dishes :)

Definatly need to double the recipe. I have 5 in my family and even doubling it, we ran a little short on sauce.  The sauce tasted good, but the presentation was terrible.  The coloring was a wierd brown (which kind of turned my kids off)

This was good, but it was also heavy. I made a few adjustments though. I had really big chicken breast so I took one, cut it in half-lengthwise, and then flattened it out with a meat hammer so it would cook faster. I use olive oil to cook the chicken and instead of discarding anything, I made my sauce in the same pan. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I used a few tablespoons of tomato paste until I thought the flavor was right, and added more chicken broth to thin it out after adding the heavy cream. I also added the chicken and its juices back into the pan with the sauce.

As for the heavy cream, my husband and I thought the dish itself was very heavy so I think if I make this again, I'll use half and half or just cut the cream in half and use skim milk or something with some cornstarch to thicken it.

I cooked the pasta to al dente and added it to the sauce, cooking it a bit longer.

Overall, a good dish but too heavy. Will make future adjustments but keep the tomato paste because I don't buy sun-dried tomatoes.

WOW. This is good. I made as directed. The only change I made was adding some fresh squeezed lemon and a splash of white wine.  

Everybody who was over for dinner that night keeps texting me wanting me to make it again.

LOVED this recipe!! My son even ate it, and he is one of the pickiest eaters in the world. I left out the tomatoes, though. He wouldn't have eaten it if there were left in. But all in all this was an excellent dish, and I can't wait to make it again.

As others have said, this is a very rich dish.  I used a review by mam62505 as my starting off place but before adding the chicken broth, I threw about 1 Cup of mushrooms in to saute, I used only 1 cup of cream which was plenty (I followed the recipe ingredient measurements pretty closely) - I didn't have fresh basil so I put about 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of dried basil in the sauce as it was simmering.  I had some leftover whole grain corkscrew pasta so I used that.  I did toss the chicken in some seasoned flour before I saute'd it.  All in all we liked this and will definitely make it again.  I really think the fresh basil would have made this dish better - I'll be sure to try that next time.

So delicious!  I used the roasted tomatoes in oil because I could find dried.  I set them on a paper towel for a bit before throwing them in.  The whole family loved it.  Will be making this one many times!

Great recipe.  I recommend doubling the sauce mix if you are using 4 breasts or cutlets, though.  This recipe produced enough sauce for two plates and I needed to make another batch of sauce for the leftovers.

This did taste like something from a restaurant!  Very yummy and husband loved it.  I added sliced mushrooms which added a veggie and worked well.  Also, there are a lot of things going on all at once so I would suggest making the sauce ahead of time and reheating it.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Very, very delicious made just the way described.  I was cooking the sauce and my boyfriend was sniffing the air, and very curious about what I was doing.  Then, I started steaming broccli and that drove him right out of the kitchen.  LOL!  What I am trying to say is it tastes and smells wonderful, and it is very filling.  I'm going to try zuchini noodles with it next time.

Soaked chicken in brine for 2hrs.  Patted dry, salted and pepper, dredged in flour and paprika.  Added 1 c. White wine to sauce with broth and slowly reduced.  Sun dried tomatoes add great flavor.  Thickened with corn starch.  Very good.  Will add mushrooms next time.

Delicious! Easy! And, smelled good. I made it the night before to have ready for the next day. I couldn't wait to eat it, and it didn't disappoint. We don't eat pasta, so I just served it in a bowl with peas. The peas complimented the flavors wonderfully.

My boyfriend and I loved this! I took advice from the other reviews and changed a few things: doubled the sauce, used italian breadcrumbs on the chicken, and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It was so yummy and fairly easy to make, however it took much longer than 30 minutes to prepare!

I never keep heavy cream on-hand, but I've always got a package of cream cheese!  So, a small 2oz of cream cheese made an awesome substitute.  The sun dried tomatoes added a very good flavor to the sauce, and fresh basil from my garden was delightful. I've never made Chicken Milano before, so I didn't know exactly what to expect, but this recipe was restaurant-quality good.  I almost couldn't believe it was came out of MY kitchen!

This was amazing. Didn't have enough sun dried tomatoes but it was still delicious.

This recipe was a lot of work but well worth it. The sauce is SO good! My only complaint is the recipe didn't call for nearly enough sauce! Next time, I will double the amount.

Holy Smokes! This was A-mAZing!  Made with 1 cup wine, 1 cup chicken broth, 1 cup cream, about 1/2 cup parmesan.  Was perfect! Might not add the full amount of tomatoes again, just for personal preference.  The cheese really added to the overall texture and held it together well, plus created a yummy saltiness that was to die for.  Even picky 5 and 7 year olds liked it.  Would make a great meal for family or friends, but needs to be served HOT.  Try it! You won't be disappointed

Used one sauté pan as other reviewers suggested, otherwise followed the recipe as written with no additions or substitutions.  Wow, this is a keeper!  I don't see the need to add any additional ingredients, it is wonderful as is.

I'm very new to the cooking scene but this looked simple enough. I really enjoyed it the only thing I thought it needed was a little bit of salt and pepper in the sauce. Otherwise it was delicious. I will definitely make again.

Yum! I liked this a lot. I made it with orzo instead of fettucini but otherwise made this recipe exactly as directed. I'll be adding it to the rotation, thanks for sharing!

My husband nearly licked his plate! I used chicken stock instead of broth and steamed the chicken for a healthier version. If your lactose intolerant, you'll need a few Lactaid pills to combat the heavy cream. I served the dish over gluten-free noodles and it was fabulous! Very few foods get five stars, but this one was worth it!

I was searching Allrecipes for something new to make with chicken.  I had both sun dried tomatoes and cream on hand, so I gave it a try.  My son had three helpings, saying it tasted like it came from a restaurant.
The next day I took the little bit of left overs for my lunch at work, and several co-workers came to see what I was eating because it smelled so delicious!  

I cut up the cooked chicken and stirred it into the pasta with the sauce, and my basil was dried from my garden; but other than that, I made as directed.  I will be making this again soon.  Presents beautifully, would be even better with sauteed mushrooms.

totally enjoyed.. didnt have chicken broth so i used veg broth, didnt have fresh basil either BUT, it was really good and im sure it would be that much better with those items... after reading reviews ahead of a 1st time recipe I did spice up the chicken before cooking, garlic powder, onion powder poultry seasoning and ital seasoning. I did saute the chicken in one pan and eventually just threw it all in the sauce pan until pasta was ready, served with grated locatelli and we all had more than one helping!
I just finished up the left overs and decided I should post a review. Thanks, its a keeper recipe :)

This is a great recipe and tasted so good. My kids all loved it and said they would want me to make it again.  I doubled the recipe and it took me about an hour start to finish with three rounds of chicken to cook.  I made it as it is written except I forgot to put the basil in until after we were done eating.  It was still really good.

This was superb and 5 stars for flexibility. I used another reviewers suggestion of slicing the chicken into strips and using one pan. I was out of basil (big oops as that makes this recipe) but oregano and a little italian seasoning was so good im anxious to try with just basil.  Not a fan of sun dried tomatoes so i used a few spoonfulls of diced from a can. Wonderful recipe.

This was incredible and easy to make! I did not have any heavy cream, so I used a half & half and a little flour for thickening the sauce. Instead of fettuccine, I used penne and I imagine that with fettuccine or even linguine this would be phenomenal - as it was delicious with the penne. Relatively easy to make. Will be definitely making it again. And this is one of the those, "let's impress the guests" dishes.

This was great and like all others I doubled the sauce mixture.. however it wasnt thickening the way I wanted it to so I added some flour into it ( about 2 tbl spoons.. again depending on how thick or thin you like it to be) and it thickened up right away just as I wanted... I also added portabella mushrooms which I sauted and also some blk olives... this was a great dish and will be making it again.

Made this last night even though I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes on hand.  Substituted a can of stewed tomatoes and one red onion.  Followed everything else to a T.  FANTASTIC!  Can't wait to make again with the "right" ingredients!

Pretty good. My sauce did not thicken though and I had to whisk together chicken broth and flour to add to the sauce to make thick enough to serve over pasta. The flavor of the sauce was very good. I used dehydrated sun dried tomatoes plumped up in some boiling water. Next time I make this, I will use ONE pan. I don't like doing dishes!

this was so good and so easy.  I am going to try it with some Alabama Gulf Shrimp next time.  The sauce is just exceptional.  I agree with the cornstarch, I added some cornstarch with a little of the sauce.

I've been doing this exact sauce for years as my standard for mainly tortellini, I must admit that I 'create' more than use recipes and this has always been a beautiful marriage of flavors, def a fabulous and fresh sauce. The flavor is supposed to be subtly sophisticated and very fresh tasting   ( in response to all the posters here that thought it was bland.) My husband has said many times over the years that this could be a menu item at a very high end restaurant.

Very good recipe! I made a few changes, I cubed the chicken, cooked penne instead of fettuccini, and added some asiago cheese. I had to add some corn starch to thicken the sauce which I wish I had doubled. Would have given it 5 stars but not enough sauce, delicious flavors though!

I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes anywhere, so I did without. It was delicious! I made it for myself and my roommate because he is beyond useless in the kitchen,a nd we both thoroughly enjoyed.

Wow!!! I did alter this a bit to decrease the fat. I seasoned my chicken and grilled it.  I used evaporated milk and a little cream cheese to thicken the sauce. I also added a couple tbsp of parmesan. My whole family LOVED this! The flavor was simply amazing. I wish I could have made it with all the fat, I can only imagine how rich this is!!! I would give this 10 stars if I could!!

Super yummy. My only complaint is that it needed a bit more sauce.

I never write reviews on recipes... but I just couldn't help myself with this one! This dish is FANTASTIC, deserves 5 stars for sure. It was easy to make and delicious through and through. I added mushrooms with the tomatoes and had white wine with it, it felt like I was out for a fancy dinner!

With more seasoning this could be a 5 star recipe. I'll definitely make it again with a couple small changes.

I made this with my mother for the two of us and my father when we were looking for a new, simple pasta based dish to try out.  It was a great weeknight meal super easy and fairly quick. My parents and I loved it! We are all big fans of anything with sundried tomatoes.  
I did not make any significant changes to the recipes other than pounding down the chicken a bit before cooking. The quantity of sauce was satisfactory I do not see the need to double it- although I added a few extra sundried tomatoes since they are so popular with my family. Overall a great easy dinner will definitely make again.

This is an awesome recipes.  My family loved it.  I cut the chicken in strip before cooking and then added them back to the sauce.  Once they were reheated in the sauce I served chicken on pasta and covered with more sauce.  Really good.

Good basic recipe, but it's pretty bland as is and the cream did not reduce after 20 min. simmering to coat the back of the spoon.  I will try this again, add a finely chopped onion and 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to the garlic, bump up the tomatoes to 3/4 cup,  I'll also deglaze with 1/3 c. white wine, I'll add 2 tsps. cornstarct dissolved in 2 T. water to the cream and bump up the basil to 3T.

Really good!!! though I did change a few minor things ... I only had sundried tomatoes in oil, (didn't have other ones) ... I added dried basil to the cream sauce and let it cook with it ... I added a squirt of tomato paste to the gravy and more cream towards the end ... then I thickened it a little with flour/water (ofcourse ... got too thin with the extra cream). I also seasoned the chicken breasts with italian seasoning before cooking them. I served them with wide noodles and fresh carrots.

My family loved this recipe. It's a keeper.  Very simple to prepare, and tastes gourmet.  The only changes I made were to use chicken thighs cut into pieces before sauteeing in pan.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried Italian herbs.  Delicious!

I'm a single 30 something male and for the past 4 months I've been making recipes off this site. Normally I prefer something really spicy, however, I had the ingredients to this. I can tell hands down this is the best meal I've made yet. This is also my first review in probably 60+ meals. If you haven't made this yet you're wasting time/money on paying people to cook for you. This will easily be the first meal I serve dates.

I don't usually write reviews but I had to take the time to write one for this recipe.  It was as good if not better than any pasta dish I've had in a restaurant. I read the other reveiws and I added a can of diced tomatoes instead of the sundried (it's what I had on hand), baby portobello mushrooms (since I only had one large chicken breast), half a large shallot, a little extra garlic and a little white wine.  Next time I'm doing it as is...I love sundried tomatoes and I'm sure it will be amazing.  Thank you Marbalet, this one is a keeper!! =)

The favor of this dish was incredible! I mixed together 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1 tablespoon corn starch to thicken up the sauce a bit. There were NO left overs! Thanks for a great recipe!

Dredge chicken in flour w/ paprika, salt and pepper - then pan fry. In the same pan, then make sauce. LEAVE OUT SUN DRIED TOMATOS - gross. Do not use as much fresh parmesan cheese, it does not melt and ruins the texture of the sauce. The chicken, sauce and pasta are very good together.

Family loved!  I doubled the sauce, added 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes only because that is all I had and added a whole tomato.   spiced up the chicken a bit more and it was awesome over noodles.

This recipe was fantastic! I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce and it came out amazing! This recipe is so versatile that you can make it with any protein or just a bunch of veggies (if you are herbivore!). I want to try it next time adding portabella mushrooms and maybe make it really decadent and add lobster chunks!! Definitely a keeper!

Tasty but nothing jaw-dropping.  Seemed like something was missing, maybe some paprika on the chicken would help.

My whole family enjoyed this and I made it and got it to the table in about 45 minutes. I had fresh tomatoes on hand, not sundried, so I chopped them up, add the basil to them and sprinkled them on the finished dish at the end. I used a bit of gluten free baking mix to thicken the sauce. I also cooked gluten free noodles separately from regular noodles and arranged the chicken, sauce and tomatoes on top, reserving one side of the platter for g-f and the other for non g-f. I'm so grateful to find an easily adaptable recipe that's good for everyone. Thanks for sharing!!

Cut chicken in pieces and fried.  Used half & half -
Would try a heavier cream.  I really liked it,  Terry
thought it was (good).

I very rarely give recipes a 5 star rating, but this one raised quite a few eyebrows at work the last few days when I warmed it for lunch.  Just imagine about 30 people sitting in cubicals staring at their computers and then sheepishly looking up and around with a smile for the wonderful aroma that just entered the work area.  This to me proves a dish is delectable!!  I think I used 3/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes along with 4 TB of fresh basil from my garden for some minor changes which really didn't need to be done, but I had chopped everything and just decided to use it.  Used a bit more cream and broth (not measurable) because I wanted to use up what was in the containers.  Tip of the hat to the creator of this recipe :)

Very good, I precooked my chicken breasts in the oven (cooler to do in the morning w. the summer heat) sheddered the chicken and add to recipe at the end to simmer with sauce! Quick and easy but better than eating out!

Yep!  Definitely the flavor you get from a restaurant and about as easy as it gets.  I made it even easier by making the sauce and using store-bought rotisserie chicken.  A very good pasta recipe.

I made this dish exactly as the directions state and it came out amazing! (well except for the packaged sun dried tomatoes) My friends and girlfriend loved the sauce and the tomatoes I could only find them in the olive oil sauce but I think that helped enhance the sauce a little. Definitely a favorite!

This was delicious!  Our whole family liked it -- from the 13 year old to the 74 year old!  We decided that we wanted more sauce, so we added an extra cup of 2% milk to the heavy cream.  We also had 1.25 pounds of chicken.  We also used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.  It was fabulous!

Got this recipe in my inbox and tried it last night. Fantastic ! My husband loved it. I did read the reviews and used only one pan, sauteeing the chicken first, also, added a pinch of red pepper and doubled the sauce.  I've never rated a recipe before but this one was that good.

Very good!  Made it just as written except I cut the chicken into tenders and seasoned them with garlic and onion powder as well as salt and pepper.  The whole family thought it was great.  Will definitely make this again.

Wonderful! I made it just like the recipe besides 2 things: I used dried basil and thin chicken breast. It taste like something you would pay at least $13 for in a restaurant. The flavors are wonderful and it looks so nice on a plate.

I doubled the recipe, cooked the chicken in broth then sliced and replaced. The sauce never thickened so I added flour. The sauce was extremely tart/sour so I added 6tblsp dried basil, 3tbls dried parsley, 1/4c sugar and 2tbls basil pesto. Came out a ton better, retained the tomato cream flavor but toned down the sourness by 8x. Maybe I'm just not a dried tomato fan. but After the additions it was yummy!...We'll wait to see what the hubby says when he gets home.

I made this for dinner tonight. I was worried this would be too much like an alfredo, as my husband doesn't like alfredo. This was, by far, the best meal I've ever prepared and my husband loved it. I prepared this EXACTLY as the recipe states, though I cooked the chicken just a bit longer. My new favorite recipe.

I thought this was good but the tomatoes just rubbed me the wrong way. I WILL try this again but use roasted red peppers instead... I was looking for more of that kind of flavor here i think. If you like sun-dried tomatoes though, this was really good and amazingly creamy :)

I made this into a one pan dish by sauteing up the chicken first then letting it rest while I made the rest of the sauce. I wanted extra sauce so I added 2 cups of broth and 1 cup of tomatoes. Instead of heavy cream I used 1 cup of milk and thickened it up with cornstarch, making it slightly healthier. It was delicious :-)

Awesome!!  Was definitely restaurant quality like others said.  Did use more garlic - 4 cloves - because we love garlic.  Also, used half and half instead of the heavy cream and vegetable broth because I didn't have any chicken broth.

I used sundried tomatoes in oil to skip the softening process and used half and half.  I cooked the chicken in a deep skillet, removed and added the remaining ingredients to the skillet along with about a cup of parmesan and some cornstarch. I sliced the chicken and added it after those ingredients had cooked 10 minutes or so, then topped with basil.  I cooked the pasta separately then topped it with the chicken and sauce. It was good, although next time I will use more sundried tomatoes.  My sauce began to separate but that's my fault.  All in all, a good dish.

My husband says 5 stars! This was delicious. I cooked it as another reviewer recommended: cook chicken, remove from pan, add garlic then 1.5 cups chicken broth and tomatoes til tender, add 2 cups heavy cream and simmer for 8-10 minutes. Add chicken and basil to sauce and simmer til time to serve. I served it over 16 oz of fettuccine.

I have made this twice now and made changes to suit my taste. I used half n half to lighten this up a bit and it was what I had on hand. And, I used 1/2 cup drained diced tomatoes, because I am not a big fan of sun dried tomatoes. It is also not the season for fresh herbs, so I subtituted 1 tsp of dried basil for the 2 tablespoons of fresh in the recipe. I served over angel hair pasta and it was really tasty. The chicken didn't seem to have a lot of flavor though, but with the sauce over it, it was pretty good.

I didn't think the sauce tasted good enough to make agian. It desperatly needed parmesan cheese which made it better. As the recipe stands without any additions or changes its not that good. I was pretty disappointed.

sooo good!!! very fresh tasting. i used mini shell pasta and 3/4 cup broth-hald a cup white wine. the wine reallllly added to the flavor. 5 stars for sure! and the sun dried tomatoes were not over powering AT ALL. make sure to buy the dry ones though.

Good as is, my 3 year old & my 1 year old enjoyed it. However, my husband and I found it a little lacking in flavor. I added parmesean cheese and a sprinkling of cayenne pepper and it really hit the spot. Next time I will add the parmesean to the cream sauce.

AMAZING!!!!! Love, love, LOVE THIS!!!! Wow. I didn't have cream so I used Stonyfield plain yogurt (which is my family's favorite yogurt) instead, I also had to use dried basil since it is too early in the year for our basil too show up in our garden. This turned out so good!!! I also used dried cherry tomatos that my family and I dried last year. I thought the yogurt and the dried cherry tomatos gave the sauce a nice tangy flavore. I will make this again soon, my family just loved this! Quite simple. Quite quick. Quite good. Worthy of 124,474,473 stars :P

If you don't like sun dried tomatoes, you probably wont like this recipe.  The sauce is full of sun dried tomato flavor. Yummy!  I love sun dried tomatoes .... this recipe is going to be the death of me!  LOL.  I didn't change a thing and it turned out perfect!!!  Excellent receipt!  Fabulous flavor!  The sauce was amazing!  One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. I might try bow tie pasta next time (just because I LOVE bow tie).

This is really good, not real crazy about the sun dried tomatoes, try canned diced tomatoes, or fresh.

We didn't like this very well.  The sun dried tomatoes were too strongly flavored in the mix.  And I decreased the quantity of them, as suggested in the reviews.  Overall, it just wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was going to be.

I make a version of this dish all the time- sautee chicken with kosher salt, pepper, minced garlic, ground onion & mustard. Then sautee sundried tomatoes. I use thin chicken breasts so I can 'stuff' a layer of the tomatos along with feta or goat cheese in the middle between the 2 pieces of chicken. I'll serve it with cooked green beans that I quickly toss in the chicken 'sauce' mixture along with a few extra tomatos and cheese to give them a savory flavor. This dish is divine!

Wow!!! This was amazingly delicious. the best way to warm a belly in winter. The sundried tomatoes and fresh basil were delicious! I could've eaten 3 more plates of it if I wasn't dieting, lol

This was incredible. I used spinach fettuccini and used butter instead of the vegetable oil. I also added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the cream as suggested by others. Yum!

I LOVED this recipe.  I used low-fat half and half to cut the calories and it was still sensational.  I'm sure its even better with cream.  I normally don't like chicken meals as leftovers, but this one was still good 2 days later for lunch.  I'm putting this one into regular dinner rotation.  Thank you!

Good grief! THis recipe is going to be the end of me!  I am such a sucker for Sun Dried tomatoes.  I didn't think the sauce would be enough for 8 oz of dry pasta, but it totally was.  I didn't change a thing.  Be sure to use fersh basil and not dried - don't ruin a great thing here.  BTW: my seven year old and four y ear old liked this too!

This was really great.  The whole family raved about it.  I used bow tie pasta.  Next time I will try making the sauce ahead of time as other reviewers suggested.  I took Mandy H.'s advice and: I sauteed the garlic in olive oil for 30 seconds and then added to the same pan sliced chicken breast that I had dredged in a flour/paprika mixture. I wanted the chicken to cook quickly. When the chicken was nearly cooked through, I added mushrooms and the sundried tomatos. After a couple of minutes I added the chicken broth. I let the liquid reduce for a bit and then added the heavy cream, the basil and a handful of parmesan cheese. I turned the heat down very low so that the sauce would simmer but not boil in order to allow the sauce to thicken and avoid separation. The sauce thickened up very nicely using this method. I also noted that the sauce thickened considerably after it had cooled down. I cooked the pasta to al dente and allowed it to sit in the sauce for a little while.

I doubled the sauce and added 1 cup of white wine (as someone suggested) instead of another cup of broth.  I did soak the chicken in buttermilk and it made it very tender.  Then I sliced it and sauted.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is by far my favorite chicken recipie ever! My mom and I discovered this on here about a year ago and we have both been cooking it regularly ever since. I do have to add that I prefer to use the sun-dried tomatoes packed in oilve oil rather than the dry ones, I have tried both and I just feel like the oilive oil adds to the flavor. I also prefer to chop the garlic into slices rather than mince it, it absorbs the sauce and melts in your mouth, delicious!

This is delicious! We did as another suggested, substituted 1/2 cup broth for white wine. Using fresh basil over dried makes a difference too. Rendered the sauce down just a bit to thicken it up (I don't like cornstarch). I'm glad it made a lot, I was able to share some leftovers and have dinner again the next night.

Loved it!  Took advice from others and used 1 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup white wine and 1 1/2 cups cream.  Cooked chicken first in skillet and then kept warm.  Removed pan from heat and added butter and cooked garlic because pan was hot from cooking chicken.  Put back on burner and  added tomatoes and chicken broth.  Cooked until soft and then added wine and cooked for about another 3 minutes or so to reduce wine.  Added basil at this point, cooked for a minute and then added cream.  I let the cream thicken and then cut up reserved chicken and added to pan with juices.  Tossed in cooked pasta and served.  I had  to let it sit for just a bit to allow the pasta to absorb sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe tastes just like the dish I order at Romano's Macaroni Grill.  Both of my picky eater children loved it.  I did follow the suggestions of previous reviewers.  Here is what I did:  I sauteed the garlic in olive oil for 30 seconds and then added to the same pan sliced chicken breast that I had dredged in a flour/paprika mixture.  I wanted the chicken to cook quickly.  When the chicken was nearly cooked through, I added 5 mushrooms and the sundried tomatos.  After a couple of minutes I added 3/4 cup chicken broth and 3/4 cup white wine.  I let the liquid reduce for a bit and then added 1 1/2 cups cream, the basil and a handful of parmesan cheese.  I turned the heat down very low so that the sauce would simmer but not boil in order to allow the sauce to thicken and avoid separation.  The sauce thickened up very nicely using this method.  I also noted that the sauce thickened considerably after it had cooled down.  I cooked the pasta to al dente and allowed it to sit in the sauce for a little while.  I really think that allowing the chicken to cook in the sauce kept it juicy.  DH asked what I had done to the chicken in the dish as it was more flavorful than usual.  I agree with other users that this sauce pairs very nicely with smaller pasta.  I served mine with bowtie pasta as does Macaroni Grill.  This will go into my rotation for sure.

I made a few changes because I try to reduce the fat in my diet.  Sauteed salt and pepper seasoned chicken in pan sprayed with butter flavor nonstick cooking spray. I removed the chicken to a plate when cooked through and evenly browned. To the same pan I added more cooking spray and the garlic. After 30 seconds, I added the sundried tomatoes, 1 tsp. of dried basil, and 1 c. of chicken broth. I simmered the mixture for 10 minutes. Meanwhile I whisked 1 cup of fat free half and half with 1 tbsp. of cornstarch. I then added this to the broth and tomatoes and stirred until thickened, then added the pasta and stirred to coat. It was delicious and I'm sure it would be even better made with butter, oil, and cream as the recipe suggests.  Yummy!

Yummo!  I made things easy on myself.  Bought thin sliced chicken and cooked it beforehand.  (I don't think not using the same pan for sauce made any difference.)  I then cut it into thin bite-sized pieces.  Made the sauce early also, added a few sprinkles of cajun seasoning to kick it up a little, then added about a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken.  At dinnertime, just had to cook the pasta (used mini-penne), warm the sauce and added chicken last minute so it didn't over cook.  Awesome!!!!!!!!   I agree with some other posts, some sauteed (or canned) mushrooms would go well with this dish.

I made this for my roommate and I (she is vegetarian, so we used vegetarian chicken) and it came out AMAZING!  Just like all the other reviews say, it looks and tastes like it was made at a restaurant. I will definitely make it again, this time adding more sundried tomatoes/crushed tomatoes (as per other reviews) - as I would like it with a touch more tomato flavor. Simply delicious!

Yum!  I've made this recipe several times now, and it's a keeper.  Generally I use penne instead of fettucini.  I also chop up a quart of mushrooms and add them to the sauce.  I've found that it is quite yummy to cut up the chicken into slices and add chicken and pasta to the sauce for a couple minutes before serving.

This dish is absolutely delicious! Even with all the changes I made to be healthier it turned out excellent. 1) I used olive oil instead of butter. 2) Used half and half instead of heavy cream (only used 1/2 cup to cut on fat). 3) Served over whole wheat linguini because I didn't have fettuccini. Thank you so much for this great recipe!

This was delicious! This recipe was so easy to make, I was shocked when I was finally done. I did some minor changes (I read some of the other reviews and it gave me new ideas). I used half and half instead of cream and three tablespoons of Parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce and add a little taste of the Parmesan. Other than that, everything was the same. This is a great dish that I will make over and over.

This was amazing!  I'm a vegetarian (cooking for a household of meat eaters) so I substituted the chicken stock with vegetable stock.  I ended up doubling the sauce and I'm glad I did.  I was cooking for six, but doubling it was definitely needed.  I added onions and upped the garlic as a personal preference and mushrooms as well--half diced up, and half sliced.  I cooked the chicken before everything and let it rest while I started the sauce.  I sauteed the produce and the sun dried tomatoes in the chicken skillet and moved it to the saucepan and then followed the recipe as stated.  I was originally going to use whole wheat fettuccine, but at the last minute decided to use white, and I'm glad I did.  The subtle nuances of this amazing sauce would be masked and subdued by the whole wheat pasta.  I did, however, save on some calories and fat by using half and half instead of heavy cream and low sodium vegetable broth.  I garnished the plates of those who wanted it with Romano cheese.  It was divine!  I will definitely, DEFINITELY be making this again!

This is superb! Definitely restaurant quality. It does take a while to prepare so I will cook the chicken earlier in the day next time.  If you serve with pasta, you will want to double or triple the sauce; it is not nearly enough.  I would suggest angel hair served on the side.  A caesar salad would be good with this.

Quite possibly my new favorite dish. The sauce was light, but had the perfect amount of flavor. I seasoned the chicken with an Italian blend before cooking it, and I ended up with pure perfection. Thank God I made an extra plate, because for the next day at lunch I had leftovers and they heated up perfect. The sauce quantity was exact, so if you like a little sauce left on the plate you may want to increase the amount. I also debated adding some parmesan cheese as I do with everything Italian, but this truly was perfect as is. Thanks for a great recipe!

Update: I've made this countless times, and this never fails to impress. Recently I added about 1/2 cup of diced shallot and cooked that for about a minute before the garlic and continued with the recipe as written. The shallots didn't steal the spotlight, but added a bit of extra flavor that we all enjoyed.

To DIE FOR! My picky bf actually had seconds and asked me to keep this one in rotation! So amazing! I recommend doubling the sauce if you are serving over pasta, since there was just enough with tossing the pasta and placing chicken on top. We practically licked the pan! Do yourself a favor and MAKE THIS!

It was okay. Generally I rate on some combination of prep time/effort versus taste. This took a bit of time to prepare. I followed the recipes and the suggestions in the review, but my sauce never thickened. It was okay, but I'd probably just make the sauce and throw it over pasta rather than making the whole thing.

Cubed the chicken before cooking...I don't think this makes enough sauce for 4 servings...I would serve 3 with the recipe.  Overall, good.  I will make it again.

This dish received mixed reviews in my house.  Hubby and the boys all said they liked it and even went back for seconds.  I did not care for it though.  For me, the sun-dried tomatoes were just too overpowering.  They gave the whole dish a tanginess that just didn't work for me.

I make this for a dinner party (16 peeps). I found that this turned out fairly decent. I did use the sun-dried tomatoes in oil (Costco has a huge jar for $7, note though it comes with garlic and some seasoning). I think it still worked okay, I know there was a bit more oil in the sauce that there should have been, but didn't have issues with separation when warm. Since I had to use 4c, I think if I ever make this again with tomatoes in oil, I'll chop them in the food processor to get them smaller. I also brined the chicken beforehand - turned out perfect.

This recipe was pretty good.  I am giving it three stars because a dish has to be very good to justify that many calories, in my opinion.  I have made other pasta recipes that are just as good without the calories.

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE.  MY HUSBAND, DAUGHTER AND I LOVED IT.  THE ONLY THING I'M GOING TO DO DIFFERENT IS TO DOUBLE THE SAUCE PART OF THE RECIPE AND I MAY ADD SOME WHITE WINE.  VERY TASTY.  INFACT MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE MAKING IT TONIGHT.  ENJOY!

Made this with no changes except more pasta.  It was okay.  But it wasn't special compared to any other pasta w/ cream sauce and tomato.  My main complaint was how many dishes I ended up with for the finished result.

Ok, I am going to have to agree with everyone else. This recipe is great!!  My family loved it.  I followed the recipe but added a little Parmesan as suggested.  My kids don't like the tomato's so I strained them out and put them on the side.  That way I can have all the tomato's I like and the kids still eat.  Super Yummy!!

Absolutely delicious!!! The boyfriend (who has this weird pasta phobia I'm working on fixing) inhaled the dish. I definitely recommend doubling the sauce but keeping the amount of tomatoes the same. I ended up mixing in a little flour to thicken the sauce to my taste. I chopped up the chicken and used a short pasta, bowties, instead. You can either pour the sauce over the pasta or mix the 2 together and serve. Either way, the end result looked really pretty.

This was great, but you must double the sauce.  I got away with just one can of Chicken broth and added a little cornstarch and parmesean chees to thicken it a little.

very delicious.....i made a few changes, cooked the chicken in broth.....and cut the chicken in bite size pieces..Next time I think that I will cook more veggies to go in it; (red pepper, green pepper). And perhaps even cook the chicken on the George....for easier prep of course!

This was great, the sun dried tomatoes tasted fabulous. I cubed the chicken before cooking it and added it directly to the sauce along with the heated chicken broth. Added a little corn starch to thicken up the sauce a bit. Excellent flavor.

My husband loves it and finds it very similar to our favorite restaurant chain's Milano. The only thing we change is by adding fresh mushroom to the garlic and butter to saute.

I thought it was really tasty and the kids enjoyed it as well.  The sauce never really thickened up, but that was probably because i used half and half instead of heavy cream.  It was still delicious.

This recipe was just okay for us. It tasted kind of bland for us - the sauce could have used a punch of flavor.

This was good, but not the "wow" I was expecting.  I used 2lbs of chicken tenders b/c it was on sale.  I doubled the sauce, and made ahead so it had ample time to thicken and cook.  Served over risotto instead of pasta.  It was very good, but I didn't think the sauce was flavorful enough...  maybe it needed some cheese or I should have chopped the tomatoes smaller to release more juices.  Not sure.  But it was tasty nonetheless, and when I have extra sun-dried tomatoes, I will make this recipe w/ some tweaks.

This recipe was just so/so for me. I added several things to it and still thought it was plain. I cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces and marinated it with cajun seasoning and paprika. I also sauteed portabella mushrooms, a yellow bell pepper and a red onion with the garlic. I also used white wine instead of the chicken stock and still thought it was too bland. If you are looking for something pretty plain, then this is probably a good recipe for you.

AMAZING!  This recipe was the best one I've tried on this site so far.  I was skeptical, but I'm so glad I tried it.  I will definitely be making this many more times.  I did not change it a bit; it's perfect the way it is.

Hands down the most tasty dinner dish I've ever made! My boyfriend and I made this for his mom and she couldn't stop talking about. It was a huge hit. I ended up needing a good bit of extra cornstarch but other than that I didn't change a thing. DELICIOUS!

I thought this was pretty good. However, the chicken broth made it too salty for me. I think I will try it again with either less chicken broth or the reduced sodium kind.

This is a very tasty meal!!  I did not have sun dried tomatoes so I used fresh ones and just stirred them in at the end and it was delicious.  My 18 month old could not get enough of the pasta. Thanks

There is no doubt that this dish is sinful, but it is so worth the splurge. Incredible flavor and a very well rounded pasta dish. I am a huge fan of sun-dried tomatoes and I was pleased that my family went abosolutely nuts over this dish when I made it....definitely a staple in our home. Wouldn't change a thing!

This was great - tasted like I bought it straight from the Olive Garden or macaroni Grill!!!  I took the tip about using Oil packed Sundried Tomatoes and Portobello Mushroom.  I doubled the sauce and I also added a few extra spices but not many - If you know how to cook - you pull this off with NO complaints.

Great recipe! The family said "Wow, you've really topped yourself!" and "This is like something you'd order in a restaurant!" I suited the recipe to my tastes a bit, however: I used sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil and spices, and used the oil from the tomatoes to saute the garlic. I also doubled the sauce and used 1% milk instead of heavy cream. Instead of adding the remaining chicken broth to the chicken skillet (I used breasts sliced thin), I just mixed it with a Tbsp. of cornstarch and stirred it into the sauce. I also added about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and melted it in.  It thickened perfectly! I used 1Tbsp. dried basil instead of fresh, mixed 8oz. quinoa/corn fusilli pasta into the sauce, and topped each plate with some thinly sliced scallions. A big hit with the family!!!

Yum,yum,yum.  I fried onions and mushrooms with the garlic before adding the broth and tomatoes.  I doubled the cream but not the broth.  For the chicken, I pounded chicken tenders and fried them with crushed garlic in olive oil for a bit more flavor.  Deglazing the pan was a waste of time, since there wasn't much brown - I'd skip this step next time.  I think the basil was a bit overpowering and would leave it out too.  This is definately restaurant quality and painfully easy to make - I'm looking forward to serving this to dinner guests!

I really didn't care for this recipe.  Surprising since my taste buds usually follow the crowd.  I think there was too much tomato for the amount of sauce.

Yummy!  Needed a little salt at the table, but very good.  I used whole wheat fettucini noodles instead of regular and that went well with the tomato.

My husband isn't a fan of garlic with chicken, so I skipped adding it. I thought the sauce was a little thin, so I thickened it with flour. And I also cooked the chicken in peanut oil. Tasted great!

This was just absolutley as good as the other reviewers stated.  I substitued the heavy cream for milk, and added a little flour for thickness (to decrease fat and calories) but this recipe is fantastic, will make again and again

This is a great recipe and can be made on an ordinary night or served up to impress guests. It is restaurant quality. Along the way I've made a few changes to suit my tastes, but the original recipe is just fine on its own. The #1 rec. I would make is to at least double the sauce. You will thank yourself the night of, and certainly the next day. Save the left over sauce & make more pasta! Try adding in some sliced mushrooms and scallions(or whatever veggies you have on hand), top with some parm. cheese & it's a new day. Quick Tip- Classico makes a Sundried Tomato Pesto Sauce that works great for this sauce- just use that w/ a few garlic cloves & the cream & stock- super fast & easy!

This is a great recipe. I only did a minimum of tweaking - added green olives (really, I wished I had marinated artichoke hearts, b/c they'd be amazing in it), and an extra clove of garlic b/c my husband and I like garlic. Otherwise I made it as written, which for me is almost of unheard of.

I have made this twice and would suggest to double the sauce. Other than that, this was a good dish.  It has different flavors than we are usually use to.

Made this for dinner last night and it was great. When I first tasted the sauce I was like "Wow!"  I used half & half instead of heavy cream and had to thicken with corn starch but I expected that.  I also used light butter and skipped the oil that is caled for to cut down on fat and calories.  It was still wonderful!

We really liked this recipe. It tasted a lot like Fett. Alfredo to me though (without the cheese). That's a good thing, because I love Fett. Alfredo. I also love sun dried tomatoes and I'm sure if I would have eaten this out, the tomatoes would have been much better, but I really didn't care for the brand of sd tomatoes that I bought.  If I could have added restaurant quality sd tomatoes to this meal, it would have been perfect! I will make this again (my whole family liked it), but I will be trying other brands of sd tomatoes.

Full of flavor, creamy yet light.  Delicious!  I doubled the cream as suggested by other reviewers.  I added fresh tomatoes towards the end.  Next time I'm going to try adding pruschetto to give it a different layer of flavor.  If anyone can come up with a lighter version of this dish (b/c of the heavy cream), please let me know.  Thanks!

This was very good. I'm not big on tomatoes but I like sun-dried tomatoes. The sauce has a good flavor to it. I didn't have dry packaged tomatoes on hand so i drained some oil packed tomatoes and tried to soak as much oil off of them as possible. I also used a sun-dried tomato fettucini pasta. Will make again.

It's the first time that I find a recipe that I absolutely LOVE - this pasta is fantastic. I cooked the chicken in bite size pieces and mixed them with the pasta and sauce before serving to allow the noodles to absorb some of the sauce. I also used bow ties - it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious and quite simple!  I used half n half instead of heavy cream, but I ended up having to add several teaspoons of corn starch to the sauce to get it as thick as I wanted it.  I also added sauted portabella mushrooms and doubled the recipe for the sauce.  It was the perfect amount for 4 to 5 servings.

O-my garsh...this was awesome!!  I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Made a few other adjustments as well:
Tripled the garlic, added 1 cup of diced onion, threw in approx 3/4 cup each of frozen peas and corn, 1 red bell  pepper sliced in strips, and was a little more generous  with the chicken stock/half & half to make the sauce go further. If I had had some wine on hand I would have thrown in some of that for sure.
 Make sure you adjust the salt and pepper to accommodate the extra liquid.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and crumbled a little greek feta over the top....YUM O!  Oh yeah, I used bow tie pasta and mixed it in with the whole concoction after it had finished boiling. Pasta is always better when it's been added to the sauce so it can soak up all the taste.  Just be careful you don't end up with all pasta and not enough sauce.  
I will absolutely be adding this to my regular list of dishes to serve to my family. 

P.S.  If you are Canadian and familiar with the "Tuscan Chicken" entree served at White Spots restaurants...this is quite similar!

This is an excellent dish!  Restaurant quality!  I served this to company and having never made it before, asked everyone to rate it between one and five stars.  Everyone replied with at least six and the highest was ten!  This recipe is not as difficult as some reviews would have you believe.  I did serve it with rosemary roasted red-skinned potatoes instead of pasta so that I had one less pot on my stovetop.  I would suggest having your butcher both trim and filet the chicken breasts instead of pounding them...it makes life soooo much easier.  I started the sauce about an hour before serving time so it had plenty of time to reduce.  I think one of the keys to perfecting the sauce is first using sundried tomatoes that are not packed in oil.  The tomatoes absorb some of the sauce in the plumping process.  Also, you want to be sure to turn the heat back down after bringing the sauce to a boil.  Do not continue to boil it.  A slow simmer in an uncovered saucepan does the trick.  And remember, this is a sauce, not a gravy.  It should only be a bit thicker than the consistancy heavy cream.  There is no need to add a thickening agent.  You can also place the cooked chicken on a heat proof serving platter, cover it with foil, and place it in a warm (250 degree) oven to keep it hot without overcooking it while you are finishing the sauce.  Lastly, there was plenty of sauce for the suggested 2oz. per person serving of pasta.

This dish was fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I also threw in some chopped crimini mushrooms which I thought tasted great.  This is a very rich dish, and next time I make this I am going to use half and half instead of cream (I nearly fainted when I saw how many fat calories were in a cup of cream!), but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  Highly recommended.

Easy and good flavor and even better the next day! I flattened the chicken pieces then very lightly breaded with flour, pepper, tiny amount of salt, paparika and tiny amount of basil, organo, & thyme. Allowed the chicken to sit for 10mins, while getting everything else ready. Started the water for pasta while making sauce. When the sauce is simmering, cooked the chicken pieces. I used 1 cup half-&-half with 1 can (15oz) chicken broth. Thickened with arrowood and flour. Next time I will add some mushrooms and bell pepper.

A little more time consuming but well worth it. The flavor was wonderful. The other things i found is that you can start sauting the chicken while cooking the sauce and just cover to keep warm, then everything is finished closer together. Will definately make this again.

Loved it!!  This dish was a great alternative to the same old chicken dishes.  The only thing I would do differently is make more sauce...there didn't seem to be quite enough.  Tastes fabulous and really easy to make!

The first time I made it, the sauce was too thick and didn't coat the pasta and chicken enough. Second time I saved more chicken broth for the end and ended up with much creamier sauce. This tastes very much like my favorite dish at Olive Garden. Great dish for company or a romantic dinner for two.

I really like this recipe, but I didn't care for the sundried tomatoes.  They had a sweet taste like dried fruit, so I didn't like it.  I will make this again, but maybe next time with fresh tomatoes, or not at all.  Maybe peas.

Love it!  I actually use a sun-dried tomato spread and it's a little quicker and just as good.  My husband and I love a good sauce and this one is awesome.  I love love the fresh basil.

A wonderful dish that is easy to prepare and it sure to please. I made a small change by making a sun dried tomato and garlic pesto sauce and adding it instead of plain sun dried tomatoes. It gave the sauce a fuller, more aromatic aroma and enhanced the flavor. This recipe alone is still a winner! Thanks a bunch!

This was great!  Definately use thin chicken or chicken tenders, otherwise it takes too long. I started the chicken,  sauce and pasta at the same time.  I also used an entire box of fettucine and doubled the sauce as the pasta just absorbed it! Thanks for sharing! I will definately make this over and over.

the reason this was good was how I seasoned my chicken.  I browned it with seasoned salt/pepper/garlic powder.  But the sauce was just plain.  It never got thick.  I used fire roasted red peppers from Trader Joes instead of the sun dried tomatoes (what I had on hand), but I cant imagine the taste would have changed enough for me to enjoy the sauce more.  Wont be making again.

This was very good, although, following the recipe exactly doesn't create enough sauce as other users have commented -- next time I will double the sauce or decrease the amount of other ingredients.  Thanks.

I really enjoyed this creamy recipe - right up my street!  My husband doesn't care for it but I would like to make it again perhaps just for myself.  Pretty easy to make I would do something a little more with the chicken next time, otherwise I too would double the sauce and enjoy!  With or without the chicken pretty tasty.

really nice dish.  The sauce was not enough for barely two, so i would recommend doubling.  Also, it was a little thin-otherwise excellent flavor and taste

My husband loved it!  I used fat-free half and half, which still had good flavor. Like other reviewers, I added more garlic and fresh basil, and also doubled the sauce for the recipe. (Fresh basil is key!)

Really very delicious sauce!  We too added more garlic than called for. Also definitely double the sauce - using something other than heavy whipping cream will change the taste. I'd move the steps around and start your chicken before you the sauce, as the sauce was done way before the chicken. Really excellent!

We doubled the sauce and added extra garlic and mushrooms...a very good suggestion.  However, we found the sauce to be tasteless, albeit visually appealing.  We had to add extra salt to season the sauce...we were really hoping for an extravagant dish after reading all the reviews.  It could be our fault however because we are health conscious and used half and half thickened with corn starch and 100% fat free vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  We realize this may have severely compromised the flavor...so stick with the recipe and I'm sure it will turn out as delicious as everyone says.

Delicious. I could not find the dry packed sun dried tomatoes, so I bought the ones in oil and then just rinsed and dried them. Turned out great.

This dish was phenomenal! I'd give it more stars if I could. I made a couple of changes. I added mushrooms at the same time as the tomatoes and let that simmer down. I dredged the chicken in flour before pan frying it and I used half and half to cut down on the fat. I didn't have basil so I used parsley instead, didn't give it much added flavour, but it didn't need it. I will make this again and again. THANKS!!!

Awesome!!  My new favorite dish to make and eat.  I did make some changes though.  I added 1/2c white wine to the sauce and I added the sauce to the chicken to simmer with.  It made the chicken absorb some of the flavors of the sauce. I used chicken breast tenders that I floured and seasoned with galic salt and pepper. Also added chopped green onions at the end of cooking.  Served over bow tie pasta.  So yummy.  Thanks.

Yummy!!!  This really is restaurant quality!!!  I added mushrooms and black olives; doubled the chicken broth and cream with a little corn starch to make it a little saucier and thicker. I also used chicken tenderloins and sauteed them with garlic salt and lemon pepper.

My kids, husband and I couldn't get enough of this! I doubled the sauce and used 1/2 cream, 1/2 condensed skim milk. Next time might try just the condensed to see if it's good. I also added a jar of artichoke hearts and sprinkled the chicken with a little garlic salt and lemon pepper, which I then cooked in the oil from the sun dried tomatoes (I only had a jar packed in oil, not the bagged.) The chicken was really good this way. A great recipe!

I tried this recipe last night for a special occasion and it worked out great.  I kept with the suggestions and doubled the sauce and used bow tie pasta.  I also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, season salt, and pepper and cooked that first.  I will definitely make this again, thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe last night for a friend.  We both loved it. Instead of just putting the sauce over my pasta, I everything in a big bowl and mixed it all together.

Absolutely fabulous recipe!!!  I used whole grain penne which helped add a bit more substance to the meal. I let the sauce simmer for much longer due to boiling the pasta a little late... I'm so glad I did. The sun-dried tomato flavor really soaked into the sauce well.  I also cut the sun-dried tomatoes into smaller pieces, as they were huge coming out of the bag.  I'm normally very picky about my pasta but I had to hold back from licking the plate when I was done!

I have made this recipe several times and each time I get rave reviews. I did alter it somewhat. I found sun-dried grape tomatoes at the store. I prefer to use those because they have better flavor and are small enough that they don't need to be chopped. I also slice the chicken up and sprinkle it with garlic herb Mrs. Dash before cooking. Then when the chicken is done I throw the sauce in the pan with the chicken and add some grated italian cheeses. I also use rotini rather than fettuccini because it seems to hold the sauce better.

very good & pretty easy. i sliced the chicken into strips before cooking & dredged them in seasoned flour. that helped thicken the sauce.also, it gets thicker the longer you cook it, so i didn't have the "thin sauce issue" that other people wrote about.

This is such an excellent dish!  Better than those served in fancy restaurants!  I made some revisions and I think it made the dish even tastier.  I used whole peeled sun-ripened tomatoes in tomato sauce.  I doubled the sauce, then added 1/4 c milk, mushrooms, onions and parmesan cheese. This made the sauce thicker. I also added garlic powder to the chicken seasoning together with salt and pepper.  As suggested by other readers, I added the cooked chicken to the sauce towards the end.  The pasta I had available was fussilli and it was fantastic.  Thanks Holly for this recipe!

Excellent recipe -- great for dinner guests. I did double all sauce ingredients, as others mentioned, as well as used bow tie pasta, and cut up, stir fried and then added cooked chicken to sauce. One thing not mentioned -- this reheats wonderfully. Before the dinner party, I made sauce in advance and refrigerated for a couple hours. I aalso pre-cooked the pasta and re-heated in microwave. All still tasted so fresh and no mess in the kitchen when guests were here. Oh, and did used about 11/2 tsp of dried basil -- I had no fresh on hand. Excellent dish - will surely make again!

I used sun dried tomatoes in oil and found a better flavor than the time I used them from the bag. I added more garlic and some cornstarch as a thickening agent. Good recipe!

I was a bit scared while cooking that this recipe wouldn't turn out the way it was supposed to. I couldn't get the sauce to thicken up all that much for some reason. Instead of putting the chicken on the pasta I put it in the sauce just to give the sauce a little more flavor. I also took some advice from other reviews and added a bit of white wine, which I thought was excellent. To thicken up the sauce I mixed in sour cream. It turned out really well. We topped some with parmesan cheese and that tasted great too. The only bad thing about this is that there are so many dishes to clean.. but it's a good thing that's my husbands duty! =)

Love this one!  The sauce has a great creamy flavor.  Over fettucine with some asparagus it's great.  Sometimes I add mushrooms to the sauce but the regular recipe is perfect!

A GRAND recipe! I doubled the sun dried tomatoes, used 1 can chicken broth, and 1.5 cups heavy cream. I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, sauteed until done, and then added to sauce. I also thickened the sauce before serving with a cornstarch and water mixture. Added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper to spice things up - was SO SO DELICIOUS!!!

Had my Aunt over for dinner last night and this dish was PERFECT! SOOO TASTY!! First off, I doubled this recipe...used a whole box of fettuccini and had JUST ENOUGH sauce which was fine for us but if you like alot of sauce make extra! It's DELICIOUS! Also, I cut up the chicken then threw it in the oil and added salt and pepper as I was cooking it. Didn't have fresh basil so I used 1tbs dried and it was fine. This is not a very thick sauce but coats everything very well! A VERY rich and filling dish! GREAT FLAVOR!!

I have made this recipe many times now and it never disappoints.  If you want to just make the sauce to serve with plain pasta or pasta with seafood or grilled chicken it will be delicious.  Just add all the chicken broth at the beginning and skip the part about the pan juices.  The sauce will be thicker and richer if you use real cream but it will still be very good made with half and half or even lowfat milk.  You will just need to use a little cornstarch or flour if you desire a thicker sauce.  To avoid lumps be sure to disolve the cornstarch or flour in a little bit of milk or chicken stock before slowly adding it to the whole pan of sauce.  I've made this with the packaged sun dried tomatoes that you find in the produce department and with the ones in a jar.  I've gotten better results with the ones from the produce department (chopped in the food processor)but either kind will work. This is a fun sauce to play with and works well on so many different dishes. Thanks Holly for taking the time to share it with us!

Wow!  This turned out so very well.  It didn't make very much sauce, and I was surprised how thin the sauce actually turned out.  I think next time I will double the sauce.

This was wonderful!!!  I made a few changes after reading some other reviews though.  I used the canned sub-dried tomatoes to give it some added flavor.  I also cut (halved) the chicken breasts and lightly covered them with a flour mixture (1/4 cup flour, 1 tbsp oregano, 1 tbsp dried basil, salt and pepper).  I browned them in olive oil and garlic and then cut them into bite-sized pieces after they were cooked.  I ended up just tossing them into the sauce while it was simmering so they could absorb more of the flavor.  Tossed with bow-tie pasta, this meal was amazing!

This recipe was outstanding. I invited my husband's family over and was a bit nervous about trying a new recipe out on them.  But everyone loved it.  I used the spinach and egg fettucine (adds a nice color to the dish). I couldn't find the dry sun-dried tomatoes so i used the ones packed in oil.  I too added extra garlic; and because I had so many people over and not a big enough skillet to cook all the chicken in, I grilled it instead.  Adding grilled chicken definitely complimented the pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really like this dish, but my kids don't like eating the sun dried tomatoes.  So instead, I use a blender and pulse the tomatoes with the chicken broth until the tomatoes are all ground up.  Then I pour it out and add the cream to the blender and just pulse for a few seconds to get out any remaining tomatoes and heat the mixture together.  Voila!  Kids eat it UP!

I've made this dish three times and it's a hit every time.  I've modified the recipe by adding carmelized mushrooms to the sauce and trippling the garlic. I also marinated the chicken in a garlic/herb marinade for four hours, it was very tender and full of flavor!

Very good recipe - easy to make and tasty.  However, it didn't knock my socks off.  Believe it or not, it actually tastes rather light; even with all the cream - which was wonderful.  Definitely use fresh basil and I would even suggest adding more garlic to add flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really didn't enjoy this recipe. Because of the excellent ratings I thought it would be good but the flavor was very bland. The sauce also turned out clumpy instead of creamy. The chicken was great though!!!!!

I made this for a friend and my boyfriend and both loved it. Adding a flour water mixture to the sauce helps with thickness.

One of my husband's favorites. I used bow tie pasta instead of fettucine and it was nice. I think that it held the sauce well. I do agree about making more sauce though.

I made this when we had some friends over for dinner and it was great. There were clean plates all around. I served it with fettucini and a salad and crusty bread. I admit, I did tinker with the recipe a little. Before sauteing the chicken, I dipped it in a beaten egg then dredged it in flour that I'd seasoned with a little garlic powder, poultry seasoning, and oregano. I also didn't really measure anything when making the sauce, just went by what seemed right. In any case, it came out great and got rave reviews. I'll definitely make this again.

A lot of flavor....yum.  I halved the recipe since there are 2 of us, but we'll make the full batch next time for leftovers.  We had spinach fettuccini, which I think complimented the dish well.

This recipie is delicious.  I will often cook broccoli and add it on top of the pasta, if you try to add it into the sauce it just soaks too much of it up.  Very good

Delicious!! My boyfriend and I loved it. I added a lot of extra garlic but it still didn't seem like enough, maybe the simmering takes away from the garlic flavor, so I recommend adding 3 to 4 times more garlic to really taste it. Next time I will definately double the sauce; this was great for 2 but anymore and there wouldn't have been enough. Will make again!!

A really excellent dish.  The longer I let the sun-dried tomato sauce simmer, the better it seems to taste!  And I like to prepare the chicken the way it was described in this recipe (coated in salt and pepper and seared/cooked in a pan) by itself because it's so tasty.  Delicious and satisfying!

I added some fresh sliced mushrooms and sliced green onion during the last few minutes of simmering the sun dried tomatoes. This added a more flavor, color, and texture. Excellent recipe.

This was a wonderful and flavorful recipe.  I normally think cream sauces are bland but this one was WOW.  I did simmer the tomatos a little longer than instructed and let it thicken a bit at the end.  I will definately fix this again

This is so delicious. I am vegetarian so I made it without chicken, doubled the tomatoes, added mushrooms, and used dried basil. Also makes a beautiful, elegant pasta. Great for when you are trying to impress.

This was great! It didn't take a super long time to make although juggling three pans is always interesting.  It tasted wonderful!  Even my fussy husband allowed "it was pretty good." Since he said he would eat it again - I know it was tasty.

This is a bistro-style recipe that will impress family and friends.  You can really 'soup' it up by adding artichokes, black olives and capers.  This recipe works well with leftover roast chicken, too.

I have made this a few times now and we always enjoy it. I cant remember if I have reviewed this before but the time before this i followed others’ advice and used less pans and honestly we didn’t like it as well. The extra pan worked for me. My husband doesn’t usually like cream sauces but he loves this! The only difference is I used just regular cream - not heavy as that is what I-had.

Really quick and easy recipe that turned out a lot better than I expected. I replaced heavy cream with coconut milk and butter with olive oil, but otherwise followed the directions as is. It came out really creamy and savory, with a bursts of sweetness from the tomato. After having a little, I decided to up the acidity and added some kalamata olives. This really kicked it up for me, especially with some of the olive juice added to the sauce, and I plan on making again in the future when I have some sun dried tomatoes I need to use up.

Wonderful, I love this recipe. I have made this quite a few times and it’s always a hit.  I definitely suggest doubling the sauce. I also like to add 2-3 tablespoons of flour to the heavy cream to make it thicker. Tonight I made it with shrimp and clams instead of the chicken and it is so good!

Awesome dish.  Restaurant quality for sure.  I stuck to the recipe as I am a beginner cook.  I did add mushrooms and stirred in some Parmesan though.  Enjoyed it so much I made it twice in a week.  Next time I might do shrimp instead of chicken.  Also I might double the sauce portion of the recipe as it just makes enough, just be careful when simmering as not to reduce to far.  So if you like extra sauce suggest doubling.  Dry Sun dried tomatoes make the dish, but if you are not a big fan of them you might want to scale back on them a bit.  First time I just tossed the all the pasta, chicken and sauce which worked out great.  Second time I went more for presentation like the video suggests and I think I preferred it that way.  Both work.  Everyone raved about this dish and again felt like they were at a restaurant.

The taste was amazing, but the thickness of the noodle subtracted from that. Should try again with penne or spaghetti.

Enjoyed with fresh green beans and homemade garlic bread. Very enjoyable altogether.

Excellent flavor! The amount of sauce is plenty for this dish. My wife & I love garlic so I used 4 cloves instead of 2 and I also added garlic powder to the chicken breasts as they cooked. Other than that I made it as per the recipe.

Wonderful, even better the next day! Only addition I made was 3 strips of thick, hickory smoked bacon, chopped then browned before cooking the chicken in the same pan.

I made this exactly as written, no dredging chicken in flour or making twice as much sauce or thickening the sauce with cornstarch. The chicken was very tender, the sauce was not too heavy and overall it was very tasty. I will definitely make it again but I think it may need a little something extra next time. The rave reviews are warranted unless it has been so modified it’s not the same recipe. But adding a little white wine or red pepper flakes may be all it needs. I highly recommend following it as written at least the first time you make it.

Made it with beef broth instead of chicken broth, probably screwed it up by doing that: it definitely tasted like beef.

This recipe is top notch and super delish!  Try Better Than Bouillon instead of regular chicken broth although not entirely necessary because this recipe has plenty of flavor.    I did like the idea of adding paprika to the flour before dredging the chicken.  Also definitely double the sauce.  In fact, double your whole recipe so you’ll have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

My daughter told me this is one of her favorite meals the first time I made it.  I made it a second time for family and they all said how exceptional it was.  Definately double up on the sauce if you like to dip your bread!  It's too good not to!

made this tonight and added a few extra ingredients I had on hand that needed to be used up. I stirred in a container of ricotta in the sauce added some hot pepper flakes and some Smokey onion and garlic seasoning. I also saute the chicken with macadamia nut oil which gives a wonderful buttery taste since I didn't have butter. fed most of the neighbors as well and everyone loved it

This was delicious! I was a bit skeptical based on how simple the recipe seemed, but it turned out great.  I love sun-dried tomatoes so I added some extra (I usually prefer the ones that come in oil based on past experience but the dehydrated ones ended up tasting fine and added flavor to the sauce).

Added flavor and pizaaz to the otherwise dull boneless, skinless chicken breast.  Excellent upgrade to a typical weeknight dinner.  Did not have pasta on hand and it went great with rice.

OMG ... so good. My husband loved it and asked if I could make it again minus the chicken & sear some scallops & put on top of the pasta & sauce. I doubled everything except chicken & pasta. I substituted roma tomatoes for sundried that I added at the end with a small container of sliced baby portabella mushroom that I had fried up in a pan.I cooked the chicken first and then rested while I made the sauce all at once in the same pan. I threw in the cooked pasta in the pan at the end with the sliced up chicken. I am glad that I didn't over cook the sauce because it would have thickened up too much in the end.

I cooked the chicken breast as instructed but then cubed it for serving.  Really tool the sauce nicely.  Next time, I will reduce the amount of sun dried tomatoes...or maybe just remove some them from the sauce before serving. But there will definitely be a next time!

This dish was tasty. The only thing that we changed was a tablespoon of dried basil instead of 2 tablespoons of fresh. The store didn't have any fresh.

I made this exactly as instructed and it was A-MAZING!  My husband loved it as well!  It tasted just like the Chicken Milano I love at Macaroni Grill.  Very rich and tasty.

5 stars with the changes I made after reading reviews. Like a lot of people, I drenched the chicken in seasoned flour before cooking and , I doubled the sauce, 2 cups of broth and cream, and I also made this using one skillet. It was so good my husband and toddler who normally don’t like pasta loved it! I will definitely make it again.

Sooo good! I used my cast iron skillet. Husband hates tomatoes so i substituted diced red and orange bell pepper. I also added bacon bits and parmesan cheese to the sauce.

It was good.  Nothing I would crave.  Great recipe for sure.  I added extra heavy cream and chicken broth because I like a lot of sauce.   We will see how it reheats tomorrow.  Might be even better.

I made no changes except I used chicken which was already cut up.  It cooks quickly.  Everything else the same.  I used basil from my garden which is always rewarding.  Just over an hour from a bit of prep work to clean up.  Will make again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! The sauce was very creamy, and the consistency was smooth. The basil hints were delicious. Definitely recommend this! Tips: I added some white wine and crushed red peppers to add spice. Also, next time I would make 10-12 ounces of pasta bc the exact recipe only made 3 servings as a main dish.

I made this and loved it. It was sweet and savory and rich. I wouldn't change much about it, I would just suggest to make sure you really season your chicken and make sure you give the sauce time to thicken. :) fresh basil is a must as well. :)

This is such a flavorful, delicious meal. Typically with online recipes I have to modify the ingredients (add more than the recipe calls for or add different ingredients to make the dish more flavorful) but I did not have to adjust anything. My family devoured the meal with no leftovers. I will be making it again this week.

This recipe is great as written ... so flavorful and yummy    I also made it with dried basil when I didn’t have fresh and it tasted great.... I usually add a bit or cornstarch to make the sauce heavier but that’s just my preference

I forgot the basil but is really good.  I coated the chicken before cooking.  I recommend not doing that for the amount and type of oil recommended by the recipe.  Very easy to make.  Preparing every thing ahead of time is s must.

Very good as is but the ingredient list is off a bit. Simple enough to just add ingredients to taste an feel though and still be ok

This recipe has great flavor.  I used thin chicken cutlets--they were prefect!  I will definitely double the sauce next time.

Doubled the sauce as recommended by a few reviewers and found it to be more than enough.  Add some canned artichoke hearts for more variety.  All the family loved it!  This recipe made it to the ? list!

I studied the reviews and dredged my chicken in flour, a little garlic powder, a little salt, and a little paprika. Before dredging, I cut the chicken breasts into strips like chicken fajitas. I didn't have fresh basil, so I followed a reviewer's measurement of dry basil. I didn't have heavy cream, but did have evaporated milk. Those were my only changes/substitutions. It was good, but I'm not inclined to make it again, even with the correct ingredients.

This was REALLY good.  I used 4 boneless thighs instead of breasts.  I would have added mushrooms to the sauce but did not have any.  I did add one sliced green onion.  YUM!  My husband thought it was wonderful.  Thank you!

Served with angel hair pasta. Used a fat 1 clove worth of minced garlic. We had fresh basil that I picked from my herb garden- a little overpowering with 2 Tbsp. My husband likes to have leftovers so would double the sauce recipe next time. Enjoyed the recipe-restaurant quality!!

I love this recipe! I changed a couple things, but nothing major. Instead of pasta, I used my spiralizer to make zucchini noodles. I also added mushrooms for more veggies. I cooked the zoodles in chicken broth to soften them added them to the creamy tomato sauce. I will definitely make this again.

DO YOU LIKE MAC N CHEESE: Because I'm obsessed. I adapted these recipes to suit my addiction and basically made something new. Use smoked sun dried tomatoes and add one cup of  shredded parmesan and one cup of shredded mozzarella along with two tbs of butter instead of one and a cup and a half of heavy cream. 

SO GOOD. 

I also used macaroni noodles. 

So if you want a major adaptation, here ya go!

Definitely restaurant quality! Family raved. I didn’t have heavy cream so I substituted whole milk and corn starch to thicken. Also added mushrooms and shallots. Suggest having grated parmesan and/or shredded mozzarella available for those who like cheese with their Italian dishes.

I added about 10 oz of white button mushrooms, used less heavy cream but used 3\4 cup of  2% milk to lighten it up but make a thicker sauce. This was absolutely fantastic served over linguine!!  Super easy and can't wait to make this again and again!!

This was absolutely delicious! The directions are a bit confusing, as you have to do most of these things simultaneously and it doesn't describe the proper timing very well. Also, you need WAY more than just 4 minutes per side on the chicken if it's getting cooked via saute. But otherwise, I followed the directions exactly and this was one of the tastiest things I've eaten in a very long time. I'm so glad I tried this, and will absolutely be adding it to my family recipe binder to make again!

This was absolutely delicious.  The only changes we made were using light cream instead of heavy and serving with grated parmigiana reggiano.  Definitely this will be added to our more frequent dishes.

This was delish. I sauteed the chicken breasts first, in butter and olive oil, then moved them to a plate and used the same pan to do the garlic and tomatoes in chicken broth. Once the tomatoes were tender, I sliced the chicken in thick pieces and added them back to the pan, simmered until they were cooked through (added  a little more broth), added the cream and basil, and cooked until reduced to the consistency I wanted. Delicious, tasted like a fine restaurant meal. Cold white wine a definite must!!

Made it just the way the recipe calls for it to made, except I pounded the breasts to make them more uniform in thickness before they were sautéed. Very tasty.

I made this last night and it was delicious! I made bruschetta from scratch with roasted asparagus and a kale cabbage salad. There’s plenty for left overs tonight, which I Love! I will make more sauce to pour over it to freshen it up a bit since the pasta has absorbed so much.   The whole family loves it!

I overlooked the chicken because I don’t make meat very often. I also cooked the chicken first, remove from it, then used the same pan. I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was delicious! I was nervous it would be lacking flavor but it had just enough salt and creaminess. Definitely going to be making this again and perhaps trying with different meats.

Turned out great!  As others commented, I also cooked the chicken first and set aside then started with the first step and cooked all in one skillet.  My second time I added one more garlic clove and some fresh shredded parmesan cheese to give it a little extra flavor.

One of my favorite recipes!  I triple the sauce and thicken it up with 2-3 table spoons of corn starch.  I also prefer Roma tomatoes to sun dried, so I remove the seeds form 2-3 Roma’s, cut small and through them in the sauce much closer to the end.   Absolutely delicious!!

I was excited to see a simple (few ingredient recipe) with several positive reviews.  It was easy to make and came together fine.  The outcome was just okay -- not nearly as flavorful as I had hoped.  I would say it's a fine enough meal for  something quick and easy, but it's not on my 'got have it soon" list.

This is an amazing dish.  It is now an absolute favorite for my family.  I did make minor adjustments as I did not have all of the ingredients, but I didn’t add anything.  I used tomato paste in a tube, rather than tomatoes and I used half-n-half instead of cream, but oh my.  so good.   Thank you for this recipe!!!!

Didn't take that long to make and clean up was a breeze. The taste was wonderful and the sun-dried tomatoes were a twist of a taste I was not familiar with. Great tasting meal.

Excellent recipe. No need to use 3 pans. You can make do with one or 2. I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breast. Came out so flavorful!

Yum! I simplified it a bit, using one pot for the pasta and a large skillet for everything else. I browned my chicken and removed to a plate to keep warm, then did the rest of the steps in the skillet. My sauce was done by the time the pasta was. I also doubled the sauce because I had a 16 oz box of pasta and didn't want it to be dry. Delicious!

I've used the dry packaged sun-dried tomatoes, but it didn't look like the small pieces in the photo. So I guess I need to let it cook longer to tenderize it. Since I didn't have any fettuccine on hand, I've used angel hair pasta, which also tasted great. I split half of my chicken and have some for leftovers-- I might use it with spaghetti next time around.

Not a fan, sorry.  Made exactly as written but doubled the sauce only because I made extra pasta.  Even with the extra pasta, I don't think doubling the sauce was needed because it's extremely rich and way too salty! The chicken was dry and the sun dried tomatoes were a bit too sour and overpowering for our tastes. Guess you need to like sun dried tomatoes to like this dish. I had high hopes based on all of the reviews but I won't be making again.

Wow!  My 15 year old made this for Easter dinner last night and it was amazing!  I helped him just a little to make a few changes based on reviews but he did everything else. The changes he made were to use 1/4 white wine and 3/4 chicken broth and he added mushrooms to the sauce. He also breaded the chicken in flour after pounding them out. He used 6 chicken breasts (about 3lbs) and tripled the sauce (increased recipe to 12 servings). This was for 6 people and there was maybe 2 servings leftover. This had to be one of the best meals I’ve ever had!!

I made this recipes several times now.  My friend had to crash at my house one day I made it and his reaction was just a really loud MMMM  he is fairly picky and I was hesitant to serve him something he had not tried but it worked out perfectly and he asked for the recipe.

Really flavorful pasta. The sun-dried tomatoes really complimented this dish. My husband went back for seconds. There was only enough sauce to coat the pasta. So, in the future, I will double the sauce. Just all around, a good recipe.

Restaurant quality. Doubled sauce. Used 2 teaspoons dried basil in  place of 4 tablespoons fresh. Squeezed a few drops fresh lemon juice at the end. Kept 1/4 broth for drippings.

Not bad. I added a lot of my own spices and cheese to the sauce. I also used canned roasted diced tomatoes instead of sun-dried ones.

I made this and you can follow the first most popular review the instructions to do it all in one pot. I doubled the sauce I also you mixed chicken broth and white wine Pinot Grigio and it made it taste superb this is a win-win recipe you can't go wrong with it I've you use butter instead of oil in the sauce as well. You can put any variances of vegetables as Peppers mushrooms or whatever you like to dye sand with this dish will only make it taste even better I use mushrooms.. this recipe can be used with chicken or shrimp.. restaurant  quality dish.

Thanks for allrecioes.com and everyone that submits recipes and reviews. They help me as I started cooking this year. For Chicken Milano I followed Marbalet's recipe and combined it with Cookiequeen's review. I had fun preparing it and it looked great, however, the sauce was tasteless. Cheryl, my wife, complimented me for my efforts, but agreed with me. Any suggestions what to do? I'd sure appreciate them. Happy New Year, Jack Kinney

It was all in all pretty good. I made it as a special meal for my family  tonight and it was fairly well received... save for my brother,  but he's an extremely picky eater and a homemade tomato sauce was a little too adventurous for him. But, my father and I LOVED it. If I made this recipe again, though, I'd try to make the sauce a little thicker. For us, it didn't coat the pasta very well.

Incredible.  Like others, I made more sauce.  The sauce was like out of a fine Italian restaurant.  Loved this recipe.

This recipe was excellent. Restaurant quality like others said. I’m not sure if this was the recipe or my mistake, but the sauce was dry and there wasn’t enough if it. Otherwise I’d give it 5 stars. The flavor was outstanding. I used light cream to make it a little healthier. I will definitely make again. It is a dish I would serve to company.

We really liked the sauce.  I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, so I diced fresh tomatoes and put them in near the end of cooking the sauce.

WOW is all I can say.  This is definitely a GOURMET DINNER!  I threw it together last night following the recipe exactly but with dried basil and half/half cream.  Wowsa...... I will definitely save this for a dinner party with that crusty bread and Caesar Salad.  Winner winner chicken dinner!  It's so rare that you find a gem recipe like this!!

Huge fan of chicken and pasta so this was a very good dish. Though keep in mind there is little flavor and more garlic and crushed red peppers as well as let sundries tomatoes sit for awhile to let flavor seep in

I added caramelized onions and sautéed mushrooms to the sauce (cooked separately and added at the end). I also thickened the sauce using the recipe above but adding parmesan cheese and cream cheese - adds more flavor! Paired with garlic bread: slice loaf in half, coat with butter, sprinkle garlic salt, and top with shredded mozzarella cheese; bake in oven at 350 F for 10-15 minutes until cheese is golden brown and melted.

This recipe was restaurant quality...extremely easy and so yummy!  Only change I made was to use chicken cutlets rather than breasts so they would cook faster.   I will save this recipe as one of my favorites!

LOVED this sauce!  I am already planning the next time to make it.  The chicken and pasta were good too but this sauce is something else.  Might have to incorporate it in other dishes as well.

This was amazing, made exactly as directed (except my chicken took longer than directed to cook, but I expected it to)! Always looking for new ways to do chicken. My kids loved it! The sauce was subtle enough for them, but flavorful enough for me. No doubt we will be repeating this recipe in our home!

I did the same as many others and simplified it to only one pan. No need to wash more pans then needed. Add some cornstarch to the sauce so that it thickens up otherwise it's too watery. Very good and tasty will make this again.

Thanks so much for this recipe!  We absolutely loved it!  I would have given it five stars but I had to make some changes.  Took other reviewer's suggestion and dredged chicken strips (not breasts) in flour seasoned with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.  I browned the chicken then set it to the side.  Added margarine and sauteed the garlic and deglazed with about 1/2 c white cooking wine.  Added the chopped sun dried sun dried tomatoes (the kind in oil) and chicken broth and seasoned with garlic powder and cayenne.  I let the sauce reduce very little then added non dairy cream and the rest of he chicken broth.  Place the chicken back in the skillet spooned the sauce over the chicken .  Sprinkled a generous amount of fresh basil.  Simmered about 20 min. Wow!  Moist, flavorful, delicious. kept on spooning the sauce over the chicken.  Definitely a keeper.

I made it for my wife and she said it was the best meal she's had in a long time.  Will make it again.  The amount of sauce is fine.  The chicken was tender and moist.  If your chicken is dry, get a good instant read thermometer.

I kept the same ingredients, however my boyfriend doesn't like when chicken is cooked by itself so I diced the chicken up, trimmed the fat prior to cooking, and as the ingredients sautéed, the chicken cooked with it. I used the dried tomatoes (not in olive oil) and it came out fantastic. My 8 year old, who's the worlds pickiest, even ate majority of it (minus tomatoes). Definitely a keeper.  Thank you!!

Absolutely delicious! Next time I will use the sun dried tomatoes not packed in oil as the recipe submitter suggested. My sauce was a tad bit oily due to the tomatoes but still delicious non the less. I served this on a bed of couscous because I served pasta the night bed. Fabulous! Restaurant quality hands down!

Delicious.  One ingredient change:  I added sliced fresh mushrooms along with the sundried tomatoes.  Served over mashed potatoes rather than pasta.   Next time I will make it with the addition of white wine.  Yum.

Nice sauce. Followed others advice and fried chicken dredged in flour then removed before making sauce. Fried sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and garlic. Next time I'll  use 3 big cloves.  Delayed pan with broth then added rest of broth, cream and basil.  Used coffee cream and it was plenty rich enough. Next time I will deglaze with white wine. Recipe calls for way too much pasta. Next time half the pasta.

I loved it, I added some extra salt but all was very flavorful.  I will definitely make again.  I may up size the sauce amount though, I like it extra saucy. ;)

Delicious! The sun dried tomato sauce is so creamy. It's not difficult to make and although other reviewers made changes to use less pans, I l didn't really think that 3 pans was a big deal

I doubled the sauce because it would have been dry.   Coated chicken w flour and paprika before sautéing .  (Cut the breasts in half , larger than filets).  Used angel hair pasta.  Followed everything else to the tee.   WONDERFUL flavor.  Family and guests loved it.  Will make again.

I made this for 6 so I doubled the recipe.  I also did as others suggested and saved a cup of pasta water to add to the noodles.  I used milk instead of heavy cream in order to try and save calories but it still came out wonderful.  I can only imagine how good it would have been with cream.  I served it with roasted asparagus and two of my 75 year old guests who have always shied away from asparagus tried it and said it was a perfect compliment to this dish.

I made this without the tomatoes as my son doesn't like them and it was still delicious! Otherwise, made it as is and we both enjoyed it. He is 8 years old.

Made this and added spinach when sautéing tomatoes. Also wanted low cal so used lowest cream cheese melted w skim milk for cream sauce. Was very good but I think dried sun dried would taste better than those in the oil.

Fabulous!! Since my fam doesn't like the texture of sun dried tomatoes, I bounce them around in the food processor with a bit of the broth til they break up a little before cooking.  After they  cook and get soft, I take out the big chunks. Still has lots of flavor without the chew. I tried this once without cream and substituted evaporated milk - epic fail. Just FYI on that.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I couldn't believe all the positive reviews! The love cream sauces but the sundried tomatoes were way to salty and awful tasting. I followed the recipe exactly but I'll never make it again.

First time making this. The sauce was delicious!! The combination of the sundried tomatoes, garlic, butter, with chicken stock made for a very flavorful sauce that complements any noodles. For the chicken breast, I found that 4 minutes per side didn't cook the chicken all the way through. Would recommend cutting the chicken breasts in half to facilitate better cooking times. Again, we loved the sauce! Will definitely be making this again.

Really good. My wife and I both enjoyed this. You certainly could make this in just one pan. If you cook the chicken first , remove it and cover with foil, you can do the sauce. Whenever there is a cream sauce, I double the liquid. I have found I like more sauce with the chicken. I added a touch of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up just a touch.

This chicken recipe was excellent.  The only change I made was to use cream cheese instead of heavy cream, which then caused me to add more chicken broth to the sauce to bring it to a nice consistency. My hubby stated that it was the best chicken he ever had. I served it with linguine and asparagus.

If you're cooking this as a standalone chicken dish, use less basil. Maybe around a tablespoon or else you get an overwhelming taste of basil in the sauce. Other than that, it's was pretty good!

Was a big hit in my house.   I purchased the chicken already thinly sliced into "tenders" and added some fresh Parmesan cheese to the sauce near the end of cooking it to thicken a bit more.  If I could have changed anything it would have been to try to get the sauce to thicken even more than I was able to get it.

I made this in my Power Cooker Pro, set at 20 minutes.  I used 2% milk instead of cream to reduce the calories, and canned tomatoes. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes. My husband said it's the best dish I have made recently.  Next time I will set the cooker for 15 minutes, as the noodles were a little too soft.

A little pasta heavy but very good flavor. Used penne instead of fettuccine. Also used thin chicken cutlets, would grill next time for time saving. Either reduce amount of pasta or increase sauce by 50%. Used red pepper flakes to up the flavor.

Wow, we loved this.  I followed some suggestions to add wine and used marsala, which was all we had around.  Delicious!  Our  entire family was going for seconds and thirds.  I think I'll triple the sauce next time with just two breasts chopped up.

Husband said it was missing something.  I omitted the basil because I didn't have any on hand.  Next time I would use the basil for sure.  Very good recipe, however, it uses too many pots and pans for my liking.  I wouldn't make it very often because I don't like washing so many pots!!!

I don't write reviews...ever. And also, I'm a life long vegetarian. I've never had chicken. I wanted to make something for my friends for a dinner I was hosting. It's difficult to make something that you can't taste so needless to say, I had to master this sauce and chicken (as in not overcooking/drying it out/leaving it pink in the center)somehow. 

I read the "bad" reviews first in order to avoid the common things being said. I also read the "helpful" reviews but there were so many modifications. I followed the recipe but without the salt (bc of the bad reviews). I bought boneless chicken tenders as they're easier to cook because people said to flatten the chicken breasts to be evenly cooked. I may have added a bit more garlic..and I also sautéed sliced baby Bella mushrooms (which I was going to add to sauce but kept on the side bc one of my friends wasn't keen on them). Served with asparagus, garlic bread and a salad. I thought my friends were being nice to me letting me know the chicken, pasta and sauce were really good. I didn't believe them until I noticed people literally wiping their plates with the bread to get the last remnants of the sauce. What a hit! They said it was like eating at a restaurant. One of my friends even went as far as saying he'd pay $50 for a meal like this.  Thanks for this :)

My whole family loved it!  I substituted approx. 4 ounces of cream cheese instead of heavy cream (cream cheese is a staple in my house, but heavy cream is not; plus it's a healthier way to go).  I also used half chicken broth and half white wine.  Served it with cauliflower "rice" instead of noodles.  We couldn't get enough!  I had set some aside for lunch the next day, and it was even better then.  We will be making this again, a lot!

I made it with dredging in flour & Italian seasoning and adding a cup of white wine plus the chicken broth. It could use a little more seasoning, but was good on a cold winter night.

Loved these flavours! I didn't think there was enough sauce to serve with pasta. I would serve with a potato side. If I want to serve with pasta, I would double the sauce proportions.

The sauce was great, I added more chicken broth and herbs, plus some cornstarch to thicken it.  The chicken was kind of dry so I would soak it in buttermilk next time as a reviewer indicated.  I'll try this again, and re-rate it.

OMG...restaurant quality for sure!  I actually followed cookiequeen's review (except I didn't have white wine so I doubled the broth).  The chicken was so moist that a knife was not necessary.  High quality recipe!

My husband and my son have always been picky eaters and both of them are always honest about how they feel about a new recipe (gently, of course, but they let me know if I should make it again or throw away the recipe forever, lol). As my boys enthusiastically ate their first plate, my husband calls to me from the next room, "PUT FIVE STARS NEXT TO THIS! Make sure you save it too, it's fantastic!" I agree, loved it ??. I always get nervous about running out of sauce, so I doubled it. Now I have a LOT of sauce. So, when I make this again, I won't double the sauce. Guess I will have to figure out how to use up the rest...Maybe I can just eat it over pasta without the meat for lunch or something.

This was so easy and yummy. I did make 2 changes i couldn't find fresh basil so i used dried basil i put it in with the garlic and chicken broth it tasted great, the other change i added Italian Seasoning for more flavor. My husband and my picky 4 year old liked this very much will definitely make this again!

An absolute must fix! The key is the fresh basil, garlic cloves and sun-dried tomatoes. My family loved this dish! I made some angel hair pasta to go with it, and some extra gravy out of the sauce to go with it, ceasar salad, grilled asparagus and a five cheese garlic bread. Delicious!!!

This was good but disappointing, the reviews hyped it up. I regret following the recommendation to use the tomatoes without the oil, I should have known they would soak up all the chicken broth and they did just that. I will be trying this again with the oil packed sun dried jar, but I think the taste one is seeking with this recipe can be found in the cajun chicken alfredo recipe from a guy on food network. This was good but not great, I've had a better version that might be hard to beat. If its not good  when I make it again with the oil packed tomatoes I don't see any reason to make this again. I have very high hopes for next time!!!

This dish is the bomb depending on how much you like the sweet "tomatoey" taste. My wife loved it, and I've made it for my in-laws and they can't get enough of it. Will definitely be saving this recipe.

Made this because we needed something different and it looked easy enough and had great reviews.  We weren't disappointed. I followed the recipe and was pleasantly surprised with a rich, creamy, "restaurant quality" pasta dish.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written.  I have to say it was probably the best recipe from All Recipes that I have tried.  I will be serving this to our friends very soon  and I only make things that I know they will rave about.  My husband thought it was better than any five star restaurant meal he has had.  We had  baguettes with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and a wonderful green salad along with red wine to top this dish off.
When I make this again I will double the sauce.  If there is any left overs you will need it for your second meal on the Chicken Milano.

I would double the sauce.  It was wonderful.  Didn't have fresh basil but dehydrated worked just fine.  I'm definitely making this again.

This is one of our most favorite dinners. I added between an 1/8th of a cup and a 1/4 of a cup of really good cold press extra virgin olive oil. The olive oil adds a great taste to the sauce. After making the sauce and before adding the chicken, we puréed it to make it a very flavorful cream sauce. We did this only because one of our kids won't eat it if it has lumpy things in it.

We loved this. I cooked it as the recipe read but I know my oven cooks hotter than normal so I took it out 5 minutes early. The chicken was moist. We will be cooking this one on a regular basis.

Delicious recipe only thing is the portions were off. I changed it so it serves 6 and the recipe called for a lb and a half of chicken which was way way too much and there was hardly enough sauce. Enough for 2 people had to add another cup of cream at the end. Other then that definitely a keeper.

Very good !!  I doubled the sauce.  It was rich and smooth. 
Cooked the chicken breasts slow and covered ...... added chicken broth after they were browned on both sides. 
Will make again!

I LOVED this dish! Boyfriend cooked it for me (I'm so lucky) he added a little bit of Parmesan cheese to the sauce and we used diced tomatoes instead. He also cut up the chicken into chunks to cook it a little faster and ensure it was cooked. I thought there was plenty of sauce while boyfriend said he could've used a little more. But overall it was Fantastic and I will definitely be having this again. Only this time I'll make it ;)

I made it as written only using the jarred sun dried tomatoes and dried basil.  I personally thought the sauce was rather bland.  To "save" the dish, I added about 1/3 cup grated Parmesan.  I normally appreciate the reviews and suggestions  but with this recipe, the suggestions made the recipe too different from the original.

Took the advice of a previous post and marinated the chicken in buttermilk and then dredged in flour.  Better than the first time I made it.  Either way it was phenomenal!  Serve with garlic bread!!

Made some changes by incorporating other ideas. ..this was a HIT! Double the sauce, add an overflowing 1/3 cup Parm cheese, 1/2 cup white wine to the sauce before you add the heavy cream. I doubled the sundrieD tomatoes amount and bought the one in the jar with the oil.  I doubled the amount of cut up fresh basil and added that to the 1/2 cup of chicken broth that I mixed with the drippings from cooking the chicken breasts. I also sautéed 1/3 of a large sweet onion, 1 overflowing cup of chunked mushrooms and 3 cloves of minced garlic in butter in a separate pan. I added that to the sauce after I added the 2 cups of whipping cream. I let the sauce with everything in it simmer for 15 mins on low. Made pasta, put the chicken on the pasta and topped it off with the sauce. It was amazing! ! I also added a bit of salt and pepper to the sauce whIle it was simmering. I dredged the pounder chicken breasts in a flour, salt and pepper coating and cooked it in olive oil on med heat for 8 mins per side. Put the chicken into the oven @300 degrees to keep warm while my pasta boiled and the sauce simmered. Really excellent! !!!

Made as-is and it was easy and delicious! Second time I made it, I sauteed some mushrooms to add into the sauce - also delicious! Hubby liked it a lot - this will go into the regular rotation, for sure. Tasted as good as a restaurant meal!

This is a great dish. I'm not crazy about sun-dried tomatoes but it went well with the heavy cream and chicken stock. I used fresh basil from my garden so it had some extra flavor. However, I thought the sauce wasn't thick enough for me but the wife and kids enjoyed it.

Wow, this was really great.  Restaurant quality all the way around.   I didn't have the sun dried tomatoes, but did add sautéed mushrooms to the cream sauce.  Exceptional!  Would make a great dish to serve to guests. I'll make this again.

This recipe has become one of my favorite chicken dishes to make with my dad, and that is saying so,etching because I actually really hate tomatoes. It's a surprisingly light chicken dish compared to something like Chicken Parmesan, at least that's how I feel, and the sauce tastes amazing on pasta as well.

Not my favorite, the flavor is missing something. Might try and make it again and add some more ingredients.

I sliced the sundried tomatoes and packed them into a half cup. There were a few too many for the amount of sauce, but I like a little extra sauce.  In the the future I need to double the sauce batch leaving the same amount of sundried.

Great Dish - Used Barilla Bucatini  pasta. Added chopped green onions,  Fresh Spinach and sauteed and drained fresh mushrooms to the sauce mix.

Cooked  the meat/sauce all in one pan.

Delicious!

To save on clean up I would cook my chicken first and add the butter straight to that pan and cook the same as the directions say. You'll save a skillet and since the recipe prompts you to de-glaze the pan any way I feel like more of the flavor is saved. 

Also, cast iron is your best friend here. Soooo good.

Really great! We substituted a light white wine for the chicken broth. Served it with a summer salad, cooked fresh spinach, and capellini pasta. Of course, we had the white wine with it.

This was awesome! I can't  eat tomatoes so I made this with broccoli and onions instead and it turned amazing! I also baked a chicken thigh instead of doing the breast in a pan. For those who are upset with dry chicken, I bake it in the oven at 425 for 22 ish minutes and let it sit for 5 before cutting (awesome juicy chicken). A new staple in my house.

Tried this recipe for the first time last night and my family loved it! Will make it again and next time, will add mushrooms and peas. Thanks for sharing!
4/23/17 made it again for the 2nd time but this time I added white cooking wine  and added more dried tomatoes but the one that's available has some lemon flavor in it so it  came out less yummy. Will omit the cooking wine next time and cut down on dried tomatoes.

Oh man was this good! The cream sauce is a perfect amount of heaviness, and just tastes amazing. I've been trying to find a good creamy tomato dish and I just found it! I did add chives to the sauce since I find that they give a nice flavor to dishes like this. Also, I used shrimp instead of chicken which still came out excellent! Lastly, i added about a teaspoon of flower mixed with cream to thicken the sauce a little bit. Will definitely be making this again.

Made this when I came home on leave once for my mom and haven't been able to stop making it at least once a month it's been such a hit. I however marinade my chicken breast in buttermilk either over night or for at least a few hours leading up to cooking. I then season the chicken with a kickin chicken seasoning and grill it on a charcoal grill. I pull the chicken after cooking on each side for roughly 3 mins or so as to give nice color and grill markings to give that nice grill flavor. I take the chicken off and place into a pan and cover putting it in the oven on 350 for the remainder of the cook time to make the chicken even more tender and juicy. Its a phenomenal upgrade from the sort of bland salt and pepper seasoning in the original recipe. I have yet to try it with the sundried tomatoes in Olive oil I think that could make a huge difference in color and flavor.

This was so delicious! The only thing I did different was put a little bit of green and red bell peppers in it cut julienned style, and a little bit of thinly sliced onion. I did not double the receipe of sauce as the others did because I did not use the pasta. Instead of the pasta I used yellow squash that I put through the little tool that makes spaghetti out of it. I tossed a little of the sauce with that and served the chicken on top. I do take my chicken breast and fillet them in half to make them a little thinner. This is a receipe worth saving!

DEL IS  I OSO.   So good. Butter makes everything better. The sauce is wonderfully creamy and flavorful. This is defenetly  a company dish. I think you can make this with less pans however. I sauteed chicken tenders first and removed, then sautéed mushrooms and sweet onion and removed.  Sauce last with a touch of wine and a few minutes to reduce down. Well worth doubling sauce. 
Put it all back together with pasta and man Iloveit!!

I come from Greece and I love a good bite of Mediterranean food. This was delicious. 

I did not change anything big in the recipe. I only doubled (probably tripled) the cream sauce and added super extra basil with a hint of fresh parsley. It didn't thicken that well, but mostly because of my ballpark  measurements - nothing some starch won't fix. 
  My supermarket didn't have the specific fettuccine, so I went with something like 50/50 fettuccine and linguine, but I chose the one with wild garlic and spinach, which blended  great with the basil and parsley already in the sauce.

Switched heavy cream for Half and half.  The recipe itself does not provide enough flavor.  But once I added season pepper, Italian seasoning , Greek seasoning, and some parmesan cheese it tasted amazing.  Love the creamy, rich flavor.

Awesome! I did end up following another reviewers suggestions and altered things just a little.  I coated the chicken in seasoned flour, cooked it about 10 minutes per side in melted butter then removed it from the pan. I then added the garlic , about  1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and the sun dried tomatoes. (I did use the tomatoes in the jar in olive oil and honestly have no complaints about that. I did rinse them before dicing them and adding them to the pan so I don't know if that made a difference or not) Once the tomatoes were softened I added two cups of cream and 1 cup of parmesan and then let that simmer for a while to let the sauce thicken up. I then added about 1-1 1/2  tsp of dried basil. I felt like the amount called for was a bit much but that could just be a personal preference. I then sliced the chicken breasts and added it to the sauce which I then combined with the cooked noodles. This dish was fabulous and got rave reviews from the whole family.

Delicious!!! Once I start eating this I can't stop. I followed the recipe exactly. I just added a little ground red pepper to give it a little kick. sometimes I use sauteed shrimp instead of chicken and it comes out great.

This was wonderful. I fully enjoyed this non-red, creamy sauce.  It is best with the sun-dried tomatoes, of course, but I had a very ripe tomato needed using up. I removed the seeds and liquid from them so as not to water the cream sauce down. Please do not press on your chicken while cooking. You are squeezing out the moisture that can lead to dry chicken. Better to cut it into chunks or even bite size pieces. Or marinate in buttermilk as does Cookiequeen. I omitted step 1, browned the chicken, set aside, started on the sauce in the same pan using all the chicken broth, continued from there.  I undercooked my pasta to let it finish in the sauce along with the returned chicken. Definitely  restaurant and company quality!  Thank you for sharing Marbalet.

A big hit with everyone. It was fabulous. I did marinate the chicken in lemon juice and olive oil for two hours prior to pan frying.  The chicken was tender and delicious.  I also made homemade fettuccine to go with it.  Will definitely make again.

Easy and quick, but a lot happening at the same time, (plus a lot of pans get dirty!) But taste wise, very good! I sautéed the chicken in the Olive Oil that was in the jar of sun dried tomatoes. Fresh basil is a must!

I added a little extra cream and a bit of cornstarch thicken the sauce.  It was sooo yummy! I will definitely be making this again!!!

Anything that will get me to make a sauce from scratch a 2nd time in 5 days is a good recipe.  I couple this with a Riesling wine and the dinner was a huge success.  And now that I have a lot of basil and garlic, I'll be looking for more recipes for pasta!

Nice rich flavor. I plan on increasing the sauce by 50% next time around.

My husband and I really enjoyed this! I did end up using a jar of cherry tomatoes in olive oil, because I had it on hand, and the sauce tasted amazing! I might double the cream and broth next time, because we really wanted more sauce!! We loved the sweetness of the tomato and the garlic together....very tasty!
I just had the leftovers for lunch and want to make this all over again.

Super easy and restaurant quality!  Pounded chic Breast to medium thickness and used oil marinated sun dried tomatoes.  Also used half and half as that was what I had on hand... Took a bit longer to reduce but worked great!  Awesome flavor.  Wish I had more finely chopped the sun dried tomato to better disperse  but that is a personal preference.... Give it a try!  You will not be disappointed!

I've been making this for a couple years. Copied Macaroni Grill recipe using bow tie pasta and adding mushrooms.   After I cook the chicken I chop it and add it to the sauce then pour over the pasta. I also add asiago cheese at the end.  Oh sooo good!

This is definitely restaurant quality. I worked in Restaurants for over 20 yrs. from Cooking to General Mgr. This recipe is so easy, fast and I don't think it uses too many dishes. Followed the recipe, but added about 1/2 cup more chicken broth into the pan that was used for the chicken to deglaze. Then added the cream sauce into that and cooked a bit to reduce to thickness we desire. You can use this recipe to make many dishes! Add thin strips of steak, shrimp,  portabella's, for main dish. Just do sauce and pasta, add artichoke hearts or roasted brussel sprouts with bacon for a side or main dish. I used fresh herbed, egg noodles. Mix it up and enjoy!

This was delicious!! Probably the best chicken dish I've made in a while! I did what others suggested and made it all in one pan. I flattened my chicken a bit and seasoned it with garlic powder, thyme, basil, and lemon juice along with salt and pepper. I also tossed in some sauteed mushrooms as others suggested. It was incredible and took very little time!

Instead of dried tomatoes I used the Goya Doritos tomato base and I cut up the chicken into pieces so it cooked much faster. Everyone loved it definitely doing it again. Thanks for the recipe. Love it.

I just made this dish for my father-in-law's birthday.  I did make some changes to the recipe;  I've added more heavy cream, a little bit of flour and butter to the chicken broth after sautéing the chicken breasts. And add the chicken breasts to the sauce for five minutes prior to adding the sun-dry tomatoes and basil mixture to it. My chicken breasts were cooked to perfection, they were moist and juicy. I added the entire sauce to the pasta and mixed them well, chopped up some fresh basil for garnish.
I will definitely make this dish again-for my husband.

Absolutely amazing! Didn't make many changes, doubled the sauce, and made with half and half due to the store was out of heavy cream and used jar sun dried tomatoes in oil with seasoning also due to the store. Will make it that way again with the changes I made. I wouldn't want to change anything else.

Made this tonight as the recipe is written and it's excellent and we will definitely have it again and again. The only change that I plan to make is to cut up the chicken in to 1 inch cubes before I cook it to speed up the cooking time and ensure equal cooking throughout. It really is delicious and I wouldn't change anything about the flavor at all!

This is a very very good family recipe which I've been making for a few years now. Sometimes, when things need to go quick, I do it without the chicken and will still end up with a lovely pasta sauce.  I think I will try marinating the chicken before as suggested, and there are some more great reviews and suggestions on here that I will try out to see if I can change things around so we don't get bored of this dish :)

I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and Trader Joe's 21 Salute seasoning before cooking.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream. Other than that I made the recipe as stated. 
My husband and I liked it but felt it could use a bit more seasoning.   It was creamy and delicious overall. Will def make it again

We have made this many times. I only use one pan instead of two and do chicken first and then the rest while chicken rests on the side. We also serve over roasted cauliflower instead of pasta. So delicious!

Made it per the recipe except I didn't want more sauce so I skipped adding the last part of the broth at the very end.  It was great!  Cover the pan while the chicken cooks to keep the moisture in and it won't be dry.

Instead of using pasta I used spaghetti squash. I was nervous that the flavor would get soaked and lost but it wasn't an issue. Also, I added lots of crushed pepper and that added the spice that I like :) Great recipe.

This is now one of my favorite chicken dishes. I have made it 5 times now and love it every time. I have started making it for when we have company over and everyone has loved it and asked for the recipe.  I've tried a few different things based on my families likes and one of them is that i season my chicken breast with paprika and blackened seasoning instead of salt and pepper the 2nd time i made it and we loved it so I make it like that every time now. I also added capers to my sauce 3 different times and we liked that also. But it is still wonderful the way the recipe is originally.. kuddos to the chef! Thanks for the wonderful recipe

I made this for the first time a few months ago and everyone LOVED it.  My husband loved it so much that he has asked for it at least once a week.  I didn't change any ingredients, but I did double them.  My sister even started making it for her family.

This will definitely been regular in my house. It is so easy and taste like you are at a restaurant! I made this dish just as written and it came out looking like a picture perfect plate..wish I would have taken a picture. The cream sauce did not thicken after bringing it to a boil, so I had to add about a tbsp. of flour for a thicker

Was surprised at how special the sauce taste became after a few minutes of thickening on the stove. A simple recipe with complex flavors. Got a few "hmmm" comments from dinner guests as they took their first bite. Will be a staple from now on.

Really great and decadent! I reserved a little of the water the pasta cooked in and added to the sauce to make it a little less rich, but other than that stuck with the recipe's instructions.

One of my family's favorite recipes! The only thing I like to do different is use chicken tenderloins cut into pieces, and I use a little bit less of the sun dried tomato than the recipe calls for. The sauce is amazing and tastes great but I would definitely recommend making a little extra.

Man, this one's a winner! I halved the recipe, but I wish I would have doubled it! I thought the gamelli pasta I had would soak up the sauce, but it really didn't. I want to try this with homemade fettuccini! This is a great one-skillet-dinner that's sure to impress.

I actually read a review which helped limit one pan and the I added Parmesan cheese and it became one of my go to meals, it's restaurant quality. My husband loves it and asks for it.

It was good...a little too much work with the Two pans..will make using one pan next time..very similar to other chicken n sundried tomato cream sauces I've made from here.  I sliced the chicken n added it back to the sauce to saute a bit n so it would absorb some of the sauce flavor.  I kept the pasta slightly wet by not fully draining and splashed it with a bit of broth n some garlic salt for flavor n moisture since reviews said dish was dry..overall not bad not restaurant quality but would make again

This is fantastic chicken, sauce, and pasta!  Wow, it is a must try.  So  easy to make but tastes like you spent lots of time on it.  I did double up on the sauce and there was plenty.  Better a little extra than not enough when it tastes so good.  Was thinking about leaving out the sun-dried tomatoes, but am glad I didn't.  This is one of my favorite recipes on this site so far.  Thank you

Very good!!!  I followed it exactly, but bought chicken tenders, they are much smaller and cooked faster.  Even husband loved it, and he is not crazy about sun dried tomatoes.  It makes a pretty dish too, will be nice to serve for a small dinner party.  Next time I will double the sauce, I like a lot of it.
Thank you for the recipe.

I put in about half the amount of sun dried tomatoes as it called for. I also had to cook the chicken longer than it said but could have been due to the size of my breasts. Recipe was great and easy, even my picky eater was happy!

I will make this again, but I made a few changes. I used the Knorr Homestyle Stock instead of the chicken broth in the cream sauce.  I also used half a cup of half and half and half a cup of buttermilk. I seasoned the chicken with garlic pepper. It was what I had and it tasted wonderful. Oh I also threw in a few Kalamata olives as garnish.

I adore the flavor of this recipe, and it is super easy to make. I wanted the sauce a little thicker the second time around, so mixed two heaping tablespoons of arrowroot powder in 1/8 a cup of chicken broth and added it while glazing the pan. It turned out to be too much, and the sauce was too thick - like a cheese sauce. That’s on me, obviously. Next time, I’ll reduce the arrowroot a bit.

I made this last night for dinner, my husband loved it! Like other reviewers, I used sun dried tomatoes in olive oil from a jar and doubled the sauce. I also added a bit of white wine to the sauce. It was a hit, I had it again for my lunch at work!

Great dish! I added a little more cream and broth. I also shredded the chicken. A new family favorite!

I used thin sliced chicken breasts, pounded flat, dipped in egg and flour. Cook the chicken first, set aside then make sauce. Everyone loved them, even the picky child !

I haven't made this yet but it sounds absolutely delicious! Is there anything I could use in place of the sundried tomatoes?

Tried to make this once following the directions to a T. It was okay, a but bland. I've found if I switch out the chicken broth for Marsala wine or switch the plain sundried tomatoes out for fire roasted ones this dish is instantly full of flavor. I prefer using the Marsala wine way myself. And of course sub half and half with a bit of corn starch instead of heavy cream. Yummy

I had to double the recipe for many many guests. I used plain Alfredo for 2 of them who don't like tomotoes. Everyone would of cleared their plates, had I not given them huge portions. Chicken was excellent and the sauce on the noodles was delectable. I did end up slicing the chicken prior to cooking, as it was thick and would of taken too long to cook. I did use a lot of dishes during this recipe, but totally worth it. I would lower the broth and really whisk the cream on high to get a thicker result. I usually add shredded cheeses to make my sauce creamier.

Delicious! Definitely restaurant quality. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used sun dried tomatoes packed in oil and it still turned out great! The only difference was my sauce was more pinkish in color. Some reviews stated there was not enough sauce. However, I had more than enough for the noodles. Maybe it had something to do with using the oil packed tomatoes versus dry packaged ones. I did pound out the chicken breasts before cooking because I was worried about them not cooking all the way through. Will definitely make again. Next time I will use bowtie or penne pasta instead.

Our family does not like tomatoes, so I omitted them. I added a dash of crushed red pepper instead. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. My 1 1/2 yo loved it. This will be made again!

This was over-the-top-good!  It takes a good 3-4 ounces of dry-pack sundries tomatoes but the flavors were full and the presentation superb.  Fettuccine is the right choice.  I might add a little more garlic or something else for a small "bite" but I don't think that red pepper would be it.  Hot paprika?

This was very good. I only made one change to the recipe.... I used 1/2 and1/2 instead of heavy cream and we are not doing Pasta right now so I served the chicken with Green beans and Mushrooms and a Baked Cauliflour.  All 3 recipes from All Recipes!!

This was a fun and delicious recipe. Only thing is maybe I cooked the sauce too long, but next time I make this I'm going to double the ingridients because I had barely enough for the two of us. Super good and easy to make this. I made mine without the tomatoes because I have a mr. Picky eater, but I did decide to sneak in the basil and Im glad I did. The basil in the end adds such great flavor to the sauce.

Delicious, tastes like it was more work than it was! My only complaint is I had to add flour to thicken the sauce, and it still took about 20 minutes to thicken. I made the mistake of cooking my pasta before the sauce was done, so the pasta was cold by the time the sauce was ready. I doubled the sauce, but not the tomatoes.

This recipe is fantastic. It took me a little longer than 30 minutes to prepare because I forgot to put the noodles on, but just keeping the sauce at a very low heat until it was finished worked out just fine. My husband says this is the best meal he's ever had and we are having it for the 2nd week in a row but now with an additional guest. I would absolutely recommend this for the pasta craver.

This dish is fantastic!  Loved the flavor. Would just like to make the sauce a little thicker next time. I did double the sauce which I usually do on recipes because I like to have plenty. Even my 2 kids who are picky eaters loved it.

I doubled the sauce and it turned out to be the perfect amount to allow for dipping of our bread in it as well. Going to play around with recipe to make it less fattening thou.  Am going to try adding spinach, or artichokes or asparagus along with mushrooms next time.  Highly recommend.

This is a family favorite and a birthday requested dish. I follow the recipe to the tee and it is wonderful! Fresh Basil works best but in a pinch I have used dried.  Browning the chicken and resting while whole allows the chicken to remain juicy and tender.  Remember, the higher the quality of ingredients the better the dish :) A definite keeper!

Delicious! Instead of using a regular skillet for the chicken, I used a WELL SEASONED cast iron skillet and oil. It was amazing.

Simply delicious!  Instead of having an extra step (and extra pans). After you sauté the chicken, just add butter and garlic to the pan, cook 30 secs add broth and the tomatoes, cool for 10 mins then add the cream, bring to a boil, turn down heat add chicken and juices then keep warm till pasta is al dente add the pasta in and give a gentle toss.  Delicious!

OMG! This dish made me want to DANCE a jig!! I followed the recipe exactly and it is AMAZING!  No need to tweak it at all. My family enjoyed it so much they wanted it again for dinner the next night. Although it was amazing,  I didn't want the same thing two nights in a row so I compromised by making the sauce & adding SHRIMP!!! SUPER DELISH!! This is definitely a keeper!

This was delish! I am definitely keeping this recipe. I followed advice and dredged breast meat first to thicken the sauce. I would make double sauce next time to cover the meat and pasta. Thanks for sharing.

This was good and easy to make. I like how all of the ingredients are typical "on hand" items. I didnt have sun dried tomatoes, I used fresh cherry tomatoes and chopped them up. 
Picky toddler approved too!

After all the rave reviews, I was disappointed. I tried using fat free half and half, since another reviewer said they substituted half and half for the cream. Since it was fat free it curdled. The sauce was thin- not at all like I expected. There are some recipes where you can substitute fat free products but this is not one of them. I used the tomatoes in olive oil and I think it was too oily.

I am not a very experienced cook and this was very easy to make and came out amazing. I used the jarred sun dried tomatoes on the recommendation of others for added flavor, and I added some chopped artichoke hearts in with the basil at the end. My boyfriend absolutely loved it and even I was surprised at how good it was.

Nice. I doubled all but the chicken and used half and half instead of heavy cream. Served it with roasted asparagus and Italian bread with butter and everyone enjoyed it.

I made this dish and my family loved it! The only thing I would change however, is the two gloves of garlic.Though I know some people enjoy that "garlic-kick", personally, I thought it was a little much. In order to neutralize some of the garlic flavor, I added in some grated parmesan and romano cheeses to the sauce, a slightly bit more of the broth, and about a cap and a half of red wine. I also added more flavoring to the chicken by using some seasoned salt(versus traditional) and italian seasoning on both sides before cooking.    It turned out amazing and my family couldn't stop complimenting me on it! This one is a keeper!

This recipe was so delicious. I followed the advice of "cookie queen", thank you. The only other change was to use gluten free pasta. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe

Delicious! I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, but it still tasted AMAZING. I added a little bit of grated parmesan to the sauce mixture.

Amazing. I thought there wouldn't be enough sauce, but it's so rich, there's plenty. The sun dried tomatoes complement the Alfredo style sauce perfectly.

The chicken is just okay. I like to grill my chicken. The pasta--OH MY GOODNESS!!  This is hands down, the tastiest pasta I've ever had. It's rich and creamy and the chewiness of the sun dried tomatoes is just magical. So many layers of flavor and it is just pure bliss!  I cannot get enough of this pasta!  Great side dish for any meat!

Delicious! Added 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream. Cut two chicken breasts in half so they were thinner. Then dredged them in milk, then 1/3 cup flour and 1 TSP paprika. Used spaghetti noodles instead of fettucini.

It was really tasty - For some reason only had enough sauce for 2 servings.  
I did make a change - instead of the 1 cup heavy cream i used 1 cup whole milk and 1/4 cup half and half. 
Perhaps if I had used the heavy cream I would've used less sauce on the pasta? Doesn't matter, it was SO good, just need to double or triple the sauce.

This is one of our favorite dishes. We double the sun dried tomatoes, basil, and the heavy whipping cream and let the sauce simmer a bit longer at the end as we like the sauce really thick.

Wonderful recipe, and really simple. Definitely use one pan, just sear the chicken, set it aside, make the sauce, and put the chicken back in!

Like other reviews, the family said it was a restaurant style dish. Will definitely make again!

Very good but a tad salty.  Next time I would salt only one side of the chicken not both!  Other than that I would double the sauce recipe as my hubby likes lots of sauce (which by the way was excellent!) but we ran out.  Also we used egg noodles and it was a nice change.  Will make it again - enjoy!

This is probably one of my favorite and most cooked recipes I have adapted from allrecipes.com. This is my go-to dish when I need to impress someone, but on a budget and have to cook it quick. When I'm in a rush, i just simply buy the already cooked chicken by Tyson and season them well. This pasta dish is soooo  good!

This is one of the finest chicken recipes I have made.  This was something I would have expected to find at my favorite fine dining Italian restaurant.  I did not change a thing and after tasting it I would not adjust one single ingredient.  I served foccacia breadsticks and a fresh salad with it.  An absolutely AWESOME dish indeed!!!!  The meal screamed of Tuscany!

My husband made this tonight with soy milk instead of heavy cream, and a vegan butter (my son has allergies). Usually we add onions, peppers and zucchini, too. Absolutely delicious. Gourmet flavor, healthy, easy. I highly recommend this one.

This was as good as the reviews said it was.  However, after reading the reviews, I also did everything for a "one skillet" method.  I used sun dried tomatoes in oil and pounded the chicken to a flatter consistency and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end.  Definitely a keeper.

To Brittanydaw:  Tomatoes are acidic and make milk curdle.  You must use cream to maintain smooth texture of the sauce.  Same for recipes that have lemon and cream.  Using milk will cause sauce to curdle.  I, too, don't like to use a lot of cream in cooking, so would cut what's required here in half.  Good luck!

I don't think I've ordered a better tasting Chicken Milano plate in a restaurant.  The sauce was so creamy, melt in your mouth delicious.  

Follow the recipe exact and you will not be disappointed.

Time consuming, but very good.  Made according to recipe, but did add 1/2 cup white wine.

This was so delicious. My family loved it! I pounded the chicken breasts, liberally seasoned them and dredged in flour before sautéing. I added sautéed sliced baby Bella mushrooms and used spinach linguini.

As a retired widower living alone, I'm a "single pan" cooker. I pounded the chicken flat and cut into 3/4 cubes and browned them in butter and removed from the pan. Then followed the recipe except substituted white wine for the broth and increased the cream. Love lots of sauce! While the tomatoes, garlic begin to simmer, tossed the pasta in a pot that already had boiling water. Hmmm...I guess that's two pans. Returned chicken and added drained pasta Sprinkled with freshly shredded Parmesan.

This is one of the best pasta-dishes EVER. End the end though, I mix all the pasta and the sauce, to get an even mix. And the chicken is served with only ½ a chickenbreast pr. pers. since that is enough to get you full. And cut into 4 smaller pieces.

Easy and excellent. Can saute the chicken as stated in the recipe or simply use grilled chicken over the top as well. Will definitely be making it again when company is coming over.

I just tried this for the first time, and really like the gentle flavor of this. The soft heaviness of the cream gives the whole dish it's creamy texture that rolls on the tongue.
Had it with rice,and it goes well, in fact because it is so heavy, I got full pretty quick. 
I pretty much followed the whole recipe, (but made it in one pan by doing the chicken first and removing) except that instead of sun dried tomatoes, I had fresh tomatoes, so I sliced and heated them in the Toaster Oven (brush some olive oil on tray base) for several minutes until somewhat dry in texture, and I added a pinch of dried oregano in addition to the basil.
One suggestion : I tried to cut down on the cream and used only half at first, but the flavor wasn't very nice. So I added more cream, and it changed into something much better!

I just registered on this site, only to write a review.

I LOVE THIS DISH! it is absolutely fabulous! I can not believe that so few ingredients and so little effort can result in such an impressing taste combination! :)

I did as others have also mentioned, everything in one pan. And I also added some white wine!

This is a definite keeper, and not just among other "keepers", but in the top,top! :)

Thank you!

I made this for my family and I felt that the sauce was very liquidy and it wasn't very thick, as I was anticipating. Overall though, I felt it had a very rich flavor and I would make it again.

This was okay, but I probably won't make it again.  My husband and I thought there were too many sun dried tomatoes.

I hate it when people use different ingredients and don't follow the recipe, but then give it a bad rating.  I did follow the recipe exactly except ONE thing.  Instead of cream I used milk, so I don't think it should make that big of a difference.  Just healthier.  But when I made this, as I added the milk, it turned into cheese and didn't mix with the broth, etc.  I thought, hm, that must be wrong, so I chucked the whole thing and tried again--this time adding extra butter to make up for the milk instead of cream.  But it happened again!  Finally I picked out the tomatoes, etc, drained off the broth, made my own white sauce and added the broth and tomatoes to that.  It tasted fine but wasn't anything to write home about...  I don't know what I did wrong.  I really don't think cream instead of milk would do that--I never use cream in any recipe, I always substitute with milk and I have never had that happen before. Wierd.

Wow this dish is amazing!! I added about a half cup of white cooking wine and threw my chicken in flour and a little garlic powder mixed together then fried it in the butter garlic mixture. It saves on all of those pesky pans you have to wash.I also added some mushrooms that needed used up. Hope that help! Oh and I used chicken breast fryers, easier to fry up and no cutting into small bites!

When I say DEEEELISH!!!! I mean it is much more flavorful than I expected.
I followed the recipe as much as possible using what I had on hand (had to use spaghetti noodles and made my own cream).  It could be that the chicken broth I used was flavored (red wine and something), but I'm pretty sure this will be just as amazing with the regular broth.  I wound up making more of the sauce afterwards b/c I like a little more to cover the meat.  I would definitely compare this to a restaurant quality dish.

We were very happy with this recipe, and it made an elegant meal.  The chicken was very tender and the sauce had a lot of flavor.  I did make only one small tweak-  I did not have enough chicken broth so I added a little white wine.  I love recipes like this, simple and yet impressive.

The sun-dried tomatoes were the best part, but my sauce came out runny.  Next time I will make a roux or use less chicken broth and some boulion.

I really enjoyed this dish but found the sauce to be to thick and to little so I just added a little bit more to the recipe as well as added pesto and it was great! Suggest using spinach fettuccine.... Another change I made was to bread the chicken.

Followed recipe exactly.  I did grill my chicken seperately on the George Foreman however.  I would make more sauce next time since there wasn't enough for the 1lb of pasta that I made.  Delicious and easy to make.  My fiance told me it was a very fancy dish.  I would make for company next time.

SUPER YUM!  I took the advice of other reviewers and dredged my chicken in seasoned flour before cooking.  I also realized last moment that I did not have any sun dried tomatos so I used some smoked chipotles.  Spicy but SOOOOO good!

This is awesome,  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth while I prepared everything else, cut down on pans being used.  Prepared the sauce and just added a little bit of italian season with the basil.   I had to thicken it a little with flour and water mixture but it turned out fantastic.

Very good. Had to do a little substituting didn't have sun dried tomatoes or heavy cream. Used diced tomatoes drained and added 1/3 cup butter to 2/3 cup milk to make a heavy cream.  Also used white wine in the sauce. Turned out exceptional. Will use sun dried tomatoes next time.  The kids thought it tasted like it came from Olive Garden,  it was better than that in my opinion.

While I loved it, the family kind of nodded and smiled about the sun-dried tomatos.  It is not a knock on the recipe, but it is not very teen friendly

The pasta sauce was delicious. The taste was reminiscent of my favorite pasta dish I ate at a restaurant in Hawaii. Next time I think I will add artichoke hearts and peas. YUMMY!!

I ALWAYS read the reviews before making anything and I'm really glad I did on this recipe. I doubled the sauce and it was the perfect amount. I usually don't like sun-dried tomatoes but this was by far the best pasta dish my boyfriend and I have ever made!! I will absolutely make this again. It was delicious

This was a good recipe, but when I made the sauce it was not enough. I added more heavy cream, milk and chicken broth so I could have enough sauce to completely cover my noddles. This helped a lot and the dish turned out great!

This dish tastes like it could be served at a restaurant.  I followed some of the other reviews and made these changes: coat the chicken in a mixture of flour, salt, pepper, and paprika; deglaze the pan with white cooking wine; and add one cup of parmesan cheese to the cream sauce.  Fantastic!

Restaurant quality. This recipe is awesome made as recipe states. The only recommendation I would have is to make it lighter by using half & half in place of the heavy cream. My kids both loved this too and they are super picky.

I loved this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!!! I did double the pasta and sauce though.  I can't say yum enough! Felt like I was eating out at macaroni grill or something similar.

YUM!  I doubled this recipe and used 1 cup of cream and 1 cup of whole milk.  I also sprinkled the chicken with some Lawry's season salt.  Cooked the chicken and set aside and then made the sauce in that same pan, adding all of the chicken broth at once.  Definitely a keeper!

Awesome recipe...followed with the exception of substituting basil in a tube for fresh basil only because that is all the store had...turned out great.  Restaurant quality recipe.  Definately a keeper!

This dish is easy & flavorful.  I thought the sauce would be a bit "runny"  but it was perfect.  So was the amount of sauce. Great fresh basil flavor.  My husband and son both enjoyed it.

Great Recipe! Im full Italian and this is worthy to be considered one of my family recipes....so glad it was featured in an email I read the other day or else I wouldn't have even looked for or known about it. I usually always have these ingredients on hand so it was simple. I did make a few changes in that I used fat free half and half. It probably doesn't thicken like it should, but the flavor is there and I don't need all the extra fat in me or my family's diet!! One other reviewer suggested cooking everything at one time...I agree! I did cook them in separate pans but at the same time...otherwise it would take wayyyyy more time! Definitely a family fave! Buon Appetito!

fantastic!  This will be one of our favorites.  I have 4 kids ranging from 6-13.  The younger ones just ate the chicken, pasta, and tiny bit of sauce while the rest of us indulged in all of it.  Yummy!

I have never reviwed before, but I had to for this recipe. Very very easy to make and deliciously good. It was simply world class. I added mushrooms just like other viewers recommended, other than that, I followed to the "T". My husband loved it so much and asked to take leftover to work, unfortunately it was all gone! Making again next week as I have family coming over and I need to impress them. Thank you sooooo much for the recipe.

I didn't have the sun-dried tomatoes or fresh basil on hand, so I used the dried basil and I had the sun-dried tomatoes in pure olive oil..I dabbed off the olive oil with paper towel and chopped them up as per stated..It had good taste and is a good basic quick meal..Everyone enjoyed the flavor of the sauce. Will make it again.

This recipe was delicious! I used cherry tomotaoes because I didnt have sun-dried on hand - must admit was a bit skeptical as I was doing it but it turned out amazing - I couldnt believe I'd made it! Definately resturant quality. Just be careful about over-salting the chicken - otherwise, absolutely fantastic!

Time consuming, but worth it! I added a few extra spices and a little bit more sundried tomato. The amount of basil asked for is a bit much, so you can change that as you like.

delicious dish. Really wonderful flavor ... I added chopped onions when sautéing the garlic for some added flavor. I doubled the garlic. Also- after cooking chicken, I added the remaining pan juices to the sauce. Only thing I'd do differently next time, is brown the chicken for two min on each side and then cook in oven at 375 for fifteen minutes. I drenched a French loaf with butter and threw in 350 oven, then broil , to serve with dish. The buttered bread dunked into the dishes sauces and juices was just simply outstanding :D enjoy, definitely worth making and will use many times over.

I made this for Mothers day last night. It was really yummy! I skipped adding the basil and sun dried tomatoes~ as we don't like either. We're garlic lovers, so I did add a total of 1.5 bulbs of garlic and it still turned out REALLY good(perfect amount of garlic- not too overwelming, believe it or not!)! 
The actual recipe deserves at least a 4.5, but since I made it according to these directions(always start with original, then customize), i'm giving a 4 for reasons others have mentioned- the sauce cooks FAST. I did, however, start the chicken while the sauce was started. The chicken was done around the same time as the sauce. But we were waiting a while on the pasta. 
So I'd DEFINITLY at least start the pasta FIRST, then work on the rest. The sauce reduced a decent amount by the time my pasta was done, and I got worried. I did add an approx. 1/4C milk(ran out of cream) and an approx. 1/4C chicken broth as well, to try to make up for it reducing right before my next step(heated it up for a couple seconds before adding chicken). 
Since my chicken cooled off way before the rest was done, I just diced my chicken up and put it in my sauce and mixed it in with my pasta. It still tasted delicious(with the perfect amount of mixed sauce!), and it was a learning experience.
I'll definitely make it again though! If I wouldn't have mixed the sauce with the chicken and pasta, I'm not sure if it would've been enough sauce adding it seperately.

It took longer than the 30 minutes and we didn't have heavy cream so we substituted 1 cup alfredo and 1/2 cup milk in its place. It was way better than any restaurant dish we've ever had. It is definately worth it! If you like a lot of sauce, increase the servings.

I really thought this dish was special but my family didn't seem to like it as much as I did.  The only thing that I did differently was to use chicken thighs since that was the meat on sale this week at our local grocery.  C'est la vie.

Ever since finding this, I have made it monthly! I never thought I would like sun-dried tomatoes, but they pair so nicely with the cream sauce and basil. Very easy, somewhat quick, and delicious!

Used the sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil and it was great.  Used less heavy cream 1/2 cup, 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  My picky husband and toddler ate it up.  Very tasty!

It turned out great! But I had to keep adding extra heavy cream while I was letting the sauce simmer. It kept getting oily. I probably doubled the cream eventually.
I made this for my roommate and I and afterward we could barely move. Delicious!

I tasted the sauce as is and it was bland so I added in some white wine as one commenter suggested. It did improve it a little but still just okay. Had to add some parmesan cheese to give it more boost. Won't be making this again.

Outstanding!  My father REALLY enjoyed it.  I followed the advise of some of the reviews and doubled the sauce.  The only thing you do not want to double is the sun dried tomato.  Excellent dish.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was an incredible dish to fix!  My wife and daughter love it! My daughter even wanted me to take a picture of it because it looked so good.  It did take longer to fix than the directions indicate because it was my first time.  Next time, it will be faster to make and I will make it again for sure!

Sometimes you wish there were more stars to correctly rate a recipe.  This one would need 10 stars out of 5.  My only change was to increase amounts because I cook for 6.  It was so very good, will definitely make this one a lot.

This was so delicious! I agree that it is worthy of being served at a restaurant. The only thing I did differently was to shred the chicken and add it right into the sauce. I have a pretty good size family and it makes the meal stretch further...and is more kid friendly.

This was a fantastic dish! I made a couple of changes including pounding the chicken thin so it would cook evenly and faster, I replaced the heavy cream with 5% cream mixed with about a tablespoon of cornstarch to reduce the calories and fat and I topped each serving with fresh parm. The great thing about this dish (other than the great taste) it that it was fairly quick to make as well, so you can easily make it on a work night.

Loved this recipe! The kiddos liked it too.  Restaurant quality.  The only thing is next time I might try 1/2 of the tomatoes or double the sauce. Easy to make for a beginner also.

I am impressed! I followed the recipe to a T and it came out great. The sauce wasn't as heavy as an alfredo but heavier than a simple olive oil sauce- perfect. The sundried tomatoes, garlic and basil really added to the taste. I've marked this as a favorite and will be making it again!

Good recipe! I added some chopped onions into the sauce which added good flavor. The sauce was separating a little bit so I will make sure I dump out all the oil after cooking the chicken. Will make again!

I'm eating leftovers of this recipe as we speak!!  This is probably one of the BEST dishes I have ever made - even my boyfriend loves it, and he's not a fan of sun dried tomatoes. I made a few changes though. I cook the chicken in the slow cooker with chicken broth, garlic and spices and then when it comes time to make the sauce, I use that broth. I doubled the sauce recipe, and added 1.5 cups of parmesan cheese and about 8 slices of chopped up cooked bacon. I also whisk in about 2 tablespoons of flour to help thicken the sauce.  I find that making the sauce before you even start the pasta works the best, because as the sauce sits in a covered pot, it'll thicken up as you cook the pasta. So I'd suggest holding off on starting your pasta until your sauce is done and sitting.  5 STARS all the way - yum!

I added more chicken broth and cut the cream in half.  I used a bit of chicken broth and cornstarch to thicken the broth slightly.  Cut the breasts in half and seasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, salt & pepper.  Browned then covered them to cook them faster; removed them from the pan and sliced, added to thickened sauce.  Then deglazed the pan with dry white wine and added that to the sauce.  Used olive oil instead of butter or veggie oil, and served over rigatoni.  Delicious!

This was really good and relativly easy even though the directions look a bit complicated.  I didnt have fresh basil and it was still delicious with the dried stuff!  Other than that I follwed the directions exactly and it was great! (make sure you read them all the way through before cooking because you have a couple pot/pans going at once)

This recipe was fabulous! My husband and I wanted an italian dish that we could drink with Chardonnay.  This was perfect! The only changes I made was that I added one diced onion and one small can of mushrooms (drained) to the garlic and butter in the sauce and it made it perfect.  We also doubled the cream and broth, because we enjoy a lot of sauce.  I have already sent this recipe to my entire family to try.

I've used this recipe several times now, and I've got it tweaked just how I like it. Not that the base recipe isn't good to begin with, but I felt it needed a little bit of zing. I add a tablespoon of crushed red pepper and some red wine to the sauce-- maybe 1/4 cup or so. I also throw in some sliced black olives to round things out. The red pepper gives it just enough kick to add something to the dynamic without making it too spicy or becoming overpowering. Great recipe.

Love this recipe! Everyone always raves about it. Not a huge sun-dried tomato lover. So, I let them simmer in the chicken broth for 10 mins or so and take them out. It makes for the perfect flavor for someone that is not crazy about sun- dried tomatoes.

Incredibly easy and incredibly flavorful.  I made the chicken, removed it, then made the sauce in the same pan.  Saved dishes in the long run.  Wonderful!

We loved this dish!!!! We used to order this at our favorite italian restataunt and now that I have this there is no need to spend a ton of money when I can whip it up at home ... I used chicken thighs that was my only sub and added baby Bella mushrooms... So tasty and easy thanks for the recipe I'm sure to keep for years to come:)

I thought this recipe was really good, but my husband and kids loved it!  I didn't cook the chicken in a skillet, instead I seasoned it with salt, garlic pepper and a little paparika and then grilled it in the forman grill.  Because I didn't use a skillet, I just poured the whole cup of chicken broth in the saucepan instead of 3/4 cup after I melted the butter.  I also doubled this recipe b/c I have a big family.  I made one pan of sauce as directed.  The other pan of sauce I added chopped mushrooms for the mushroom lovers. The sauce was definitely delicious, but I guess I was expecting something a little more by all the wonderful reviews.  My family though just kept singing praises as they ate.  And, of course I will be making this again. My family wouldn't have it any other way.  Also, this dish was incredibly fast and easy to make which is a hugh plus in my book!

Fabulous! This recipe was amazing! As suggested by others, the key to make the sauce thick is to cook it before you make the rest of the meal.  I cooked it and refrigerated it about 4 hours before I made the chicken and macaroni.  When I reheated the sauce it was so thick and creamy.  The only change I made was adding onions.  And I did use the sundried tomatoes soaked in olive oil, my local deli didn't have them plain, it didn't make a difference.  Overall the recipe was amazing! My husband loved it he said it's one of the best and even my 1 year old was licking the sauce off the spoon while I was cooking it! Definitley going to be a regular meal at my house!

We enjoyed this.  I have a dairy allergy so I substituted soy milk for the cream and only used one tablespoon of soy margarine.  I also added some onions before I sauteed the garlic.  Very tasty.

I made this recipe exactly and I had the same problems that others had.  The flavor deserves 5 stars but the thinness of the sauce would get 2 stars.  I will pro ably make again be ause the flavor was so amazing but I will take e eryones suggestions to thicken the sauce.

There are enough outstanding ratings in here to know it's outstanding! I got compliments all around, and my husband even said it tasted like something he ate at a restaurant before! Voila. I had no whipping cream, so I used Crema, which tasted the same. It's a hispanic sour cream I think. I also cut the chicken into cubes and lighting cooked it at first to avoid drying out. It was juicy and flavorful this way.

I cooked this tonight, but made some changes just b/c of what I had in my fridge. I added sweet onions and mushrooms to the garlic. I didn't have whipping cream, so I used milk. I did add garlic salt to the chicken instead of salt and pepper. I also added 2 tble spoons of butter, garlic powder and parsley to the angel hair pasta. I mixed it and then added the chicken and the sauce. I mixed it all together and it was so good!

This is a tasty pasta dish, with some minor changes.  However, I must admit it was more time consuming and finicky than I thought it would be.  I used half/half cream which tasted great but I did have to add some flour in order to thicken it up.  Also, I took lots of the chopped sun dried tomato bits out of the sauce at the end because there were so many in it.  I had already added mushrooms so the sauce was plentiful.  Finally, I pre-cooked strips of chicken and just threw them in the sauce and mixed all together with fussilli pasta (not fettuccine)!  Not sure I'll make again on the basis I like other pasta dishes more.  Do try it though!  A pleasant change!

Excellent recipe.  The only changes I could recommend would be to reduce the sun-dried tomatoes to 1/4 cup and to pound the chicken breasts between plastic wrap to 1/4-inch thickness.  I will make this recipe again!

Excellent recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly but used Penne pasta instead.  Only served it for myself and my husband, and the sauce was the perfect amount.  So, if you cook for more than 2, be sure and double the sauce!  Will definitely make again - was very flavorful!

Absolutely wonderful as is. Some reviewers said they didn't have enough sauce, but this dish is not intended to be extremely saucy. It's so rich that just a light coating is perfect. This will become a regular in our house!

This is one of our new family favorites.  I also saute mushrooms and add them to the sauce.  The sauce has so much flavor and is great over bowtie or penne pasta too.

This is so similar to a Macaroni Grill dish that I've been trying to figure out.  We all loved this dish...even my little kids.  Loved it, loved it, loved it!

My sister told me about this recipe, so I wanted to try it.  It was very good!  I just need to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a little.  I will definately be making this again!

This was delicious!  The market was out of the dried sun-dried tomatoes, so I had to use the ones in the the liquid.  Honestly, it was so good I don't think I will try the dried ones next time.  I also just baked the chicken.  This will definitely be made again at our house!

My husband and I loved this dish! I grilled the chicken instead of cooking it in a pan, turned out great! I had sun dried tomatoes in oil rather than the dry ones, still was delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I rarely rate recipes but I felt compelled to write one in this case.  This dish was fabulous!  I did the recipe exactly as directed with no changes and it came out great.  Even my picky boys ate it all up.  Thank you for a great recipe.  This is a keeper.

This was a little time consuming but good and worth it. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes, so i subbed in diced tomatoes and added a little more garlic and some paprika to the flour on the chicken. tasty! The cream sauce needed a little something extra for my taste, and it didn't thicken until i put in some cornstarch but for a rich creamy flavor it was very good. will definately try again w/ the sundried tomatoes :) Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe said. I really like it, the only thing was it was just a little bland for my taste. I added some extra salt and pepper when all was said and done - however, the recipe does say "season to taste" so yeah! Yummy for sure.

This recipes is wonderful!  I made it with my girl friends for dinner and it is restaurant quality.  Instead of linguine we used regular spaghetti.  The only issue we had was timing everything to finish together.  We had to add some corn starch to the sauce and that thickened it up really nicely.  Amazing!

This recipe was awesome!!!  I did take the advise of others.  I did half and half with olive oil and sundried tomato oil, added italian seasoning with the chicken (along w/everything else the recipe called for), and sauted the chicken w/the oil/chicken broth, basil then added it all with the cream sauce.  The vegetable I used was steamed asparagus.  My kids are very picky and they loved it!!!

I sauteed the chicken breasts in the dried tomato oil and broth.  Also, I added chopped mushrooms and parmesan cheese to the sauce.  To thicken the sauce I added 3tbsp of cornstarch.  I also substituted Italian seasoning for the basil.  The meal was a smashing success!

This was pretty good. It was actually a little better the 2nd day because the flavors really came out like most Italian food. I did follow the recipe basically as called for.

Very tasty! Great flavor, moist chicken my family loved it we will definitely make again. I had to substitute milk and cornstarch for the heavy cream (thought I had some and I didn't). Next time I will follow the recipe.

I used evaporated skim milk instead of cream and whole wheat spaghetti instead of fettuccine to make it a little healthier. It was still very tasty. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe, I made this yesterday as our lunch, my mom cannot stop pilfering the fried chicken she said that its delicious and tasty, my dad cannot stop asking what did I put to make the chicken so tasty, all I said is that I followed the recipe's cooking direction. This recipe does really made may day, seeing my family's dishes empty and getting more in the serving plate brings satisfaction and happiness for me. I really really love this recipe, for sure it will have a place on my bday party!

This recipe is great, but I changed it a bit.  As one "rater" said, why change it so much, just make your own.  Well, the idea is great but everyone has their own needs & tastes.  For my family, we try to eat healthy so some of this wouldn't work.  I went out on a limb, hoping it would turn out & we LOVED it even my 7 & 10 year old.  I placed Skim Milk in place of the heavy cream.  I chunked up the chicken & cooked it in 1 tbsp of the oil from the sun-dried tomato oil.  I added ALL the chicken broth, milk, etc to the pan, & added 1 tbsp flour to thicken it up.  After simmering & it began to thicken, I added the chicken to the mixture & continued cooking for a while, added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese & served over whole wheat Penne noodles.  Next time we will double the sauce b/c after simmering to the desired thickness, it wasn't enough sauce.  Great recipe even making it healthier.

This was a wonderful recipe and so easy to make on a week-day evening. The only ingredient change I made was to substitute homogenized milk for cream, reducing the fat significantly. As this made for a thinner sauce, I added the sauce directly to the cooked pasta, stirred to coat and let it sit on low heat for a few minutes. I sliced the chicken and added it to the pasta and sauce, and before serving, grated fresh parmesan on top of the plates of Chicken Milano. Yummy!

I took the advice of other reviewers and added mushrooms to the sun dried tomatoes (in oil).  I also added some pinot grigio to help the sauteing and add flavor.  cooked everything else as the recipe states except I added some parmesan cheese with the basil and let simmer for a few moments before serving over the pasta.

This recipe is amazing. I doubled the sauce so that the noodles could really soak it up. Also, added fresh mushrooms at the same time I added the sundried tomatoes. I will make again and again! Thanks for a great recipe

This was really great! I did substitute canned tomatoes for the sundried version and drained them a bit.I also used an egg wash and dredged my chicken in seasoned flour first. It was so good and something we will make again and again. My daughters fought over the leftovers.

DELICIOUS!  The most simple chicken recipe I've ever made.  I did not broil my chicken, simply turned on the oven to 375.  I used chicken breast halves, and flipped them over midway through the cooking process. I cooked for about 10 minutes. The sauce from the pan is delicious for dipping, too :)

Excellent, even though I didn't have any fresh basil, so I had to use dry. My personal pasta preference is angel hair, so used that instead.  My husband raved about it and said it could be on the menu at a high end restaurant.  I will definitely be making this again and would serve it to company.

This was sooo good!  With some fresh baked bread and a side salad, we felt like we were at a restaraunt.  I didn't follow the instructions exactly.  I did use sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil and it turned out great.  I sauted the tomatoes and garlic for just a minute and added the broth.  I added the cream shortly after that.  Once the cream sauce had reduced a bit, I added the fresh basil.  I also added my chicken to the sauce for the last couple minutes.  I tossed the fettucini and sauce together in a big bowl and we all ate family style.  Great recipe!!

The flavors are very good, but the cream separated in the sauce and it didn't look incredibly appetizing.

This is absolutely delicious. I only had oil packed dried tomatoes, but I just drained the oil and skipped the step of cooking them, since they were already moist.  Have shared this with several others and they love it too. A real plate scraper.

EXCELLENT!!!  I can't say enough good things about this dish.  My husband said it was the best pasta dish he's ever had, hands down.  Every member of my picky family gobbled it up.    I made a double batch for my family of 7, and combined it all into the skillet at the end.  I coated the pasta with half the sauce, and added a spoonful of cornstarch to thicken the remainder of the sauce before spooning it over the individual servings.    Love it, love it, love it!

I think it might have been the type of sun dried tomatoes that I used, that made it taste a little off.

This was yum!!! I made it with non-dairy creamer thickened with a bit of flour the first time. The second time I made it I cut the chicken into strips before I sauted it. I coated it with flour mixed with salt and pepper and then sauted it. It came out heavenly!!! great recipe! thanks!

EXCELLENT!!!  I added 1/2 cup Asiago cheese gradually to the sauce as it began to boil, added the diced up chicken and allowed the sauce to simmer for about 10 minutes.  I also used the bow-tie pasta and combined the sauce/pasta just before serving.  Everyone raved about the great combination of flavors, especially with the sundried tomatoes.

We thought this recipe was delicious.  I prepared the recipe with the ingredients as written and took the suggestion of another reviewer and just prepared the chicken & sauce using one pan.  I first cooked the chicken, removed to a platter and covered w/foil to keep warm.  I then poured off the fat and made the sauce in the same pan using all chicken broth at once, etc.  I did not find it necessary to double the sauce or thicken it in any way.  It thickens itself with the cream as it reduces and we found that there was plenty of sauce for four servings.  It is not the intent of this recipe to be oozing in sauce.  The sun dried tomatoes just made this recipe for me....so deliciously sweet.  I will definitely be making this one again and would not hesitate to make this for guests.

This recipe was a hit and I will make it again. Love garlic so, I added a few more cloves, used half & half (all I had) sauted mushrooms in butter, added these. I did thicken the sauce with corn starch but, after cooking awhile I don't think that was necessary.  I doubled the recipe after reading reviews and if the portions are kept small there is enough sauce using the original recipe.  Even though, this sauce has delicious flavor, and as good as some of my favotite Itilian restaurants I cooked two more chicken breasts as I had plenty of sauce left over(after doubling the recipe) and now have another meal for two. Can't wait to have left overs. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Love this dish. Great for company!

My family really liked this dish alot.  I added onions but other than that I followed the recipe. I doubled the ingredients and I'm glad I did because we had just enough for the 4 of us(2 of us went back for more)so I guess that counts for 6. My son said this one's a keeper.

This was absolutely awesome!!!  The flavors of everything together made our anniversary dinner a big hit.  I used knorr chicken powder to make my broth to add a richer stock.  We put this in the "keeper" file!!

While this recipe was very good - I agree wit mot of the others that you need twice as much sauce.  I, also, added some tomato sauce and wine to the sauce; which I believe enhanced this recipe.  My husband loed the favor of the chicken!  I will make again with changes.

I thought this was a very good meal. Even my Hubby liked it! I over cooked the sauce the first time, so you only have to cook the sauce about 5 minutes. I also added my own seasoning and left the sauce on the side so everyone could put their own sauce on without over doing it. I will cook this again.

Amazingly delicious. This is as good as any fine dining restaurant. I did need to thicken it some with some flour.

I breaded and fried the chicken and used canned tomatoes instead of sun-dried.  Delicious and very easy.

Muy delish!!  We really loved this sauce which I too doubled, as recommended by so many other reviews. Once the 10 minute simmer time was done on the garlic, broth and tomatoes, I processed in my mini food processor for a much less chunky consistancy and then simmered with the cream.  It made a beautiful creamy sauce with a wonderful sundried tomato flavor.  Will definately make this one again.  We prefer a smaller pasta, so I will make with a spaghettini or an angel hair next go-round. This would be great with a lightly sauteed shrimp instead of the chicken also.  Yum!!

AWESOME! My 2 kids and hubby loved it. One major change, you MUST double ALL the ingredients for the sauce. There was not enough sauce for the pasta and chicken. If you want you want leftovers, you need to triple it. You can get away without tripling the tomatoes but definitely all others. ENJOY!

I just made this last night and I followed the recipe as is and I would change some things.  I would double the sauce or follow some of the other suggestions b/c it isn't a lot of sauce once you let it reduce.  Next time I might add some onions, mushrooms and maybe some asparagus.  The flavor is there...if you don't like too much sundried tomatoes (which I found that I didn't like all of the tomatoes in there), you could take some out after it's cooked.  My fiance is a cook and I thought he would definitely have something negative to say about it but he only commented how the chicken needed a little more seasoning but overall, he said it was good and he liked it...so it's a two thumbs up in my book. I'm definitly going to try this recipe again and maybe try some of the other suggestions out there.

This was pretty good.  A little more salt and pepper was added to the sauce to make it more tastier.  It took awhile to get the cream sauce to thicken but other than that it was a good recipe.  I did double the sauce as suggested by others so we would have enough for the pasta.

awesome, but for sure double the sauce.  we made three chicken breast but only had enough sauce for two of them.  this is something i will make for company for sure.  one more thing, try making the pasta a few minutes before everything else and then reheating it in the microwave.  my pasta was the last thing to be ready and my sauce wasn't as hot as we like, so next time i will try to time it all a little better.

Loved the flavors.  Used farfalle (bowtie) pasta instead of fettuccini, so that my toddlers could eat it a little easier.  Tried to jump ahead a little and heating water for pasta right away, and then found the recipe layout a little tricky to follow since I kept reading ahead and going back -- but this might just as well have been due to afore-mentioned toddlers pulling on my legs and arms!  ;)  Great recipe though, and earned the "restaurant quality" praise from hubby!

used to make something like this but added a splash of Pernod, sounds goofy but that splash of anise flavor was really different and served w. rice pilaf and cold lemon souffles for dessert.

This was excellent. Too bad cream sauce never stores well in the refrigerator. If it did, the leftovers would have been great as well. I will definitely make this again. My wife loved it too (as a matter of fact, she's the one who found the recipe and asked me to cook it for her). Thank you.

the only reason this recipe gets a 4 star instead of a five is because (a) it took too many pots and dishes-would love a simplified version like some commenters mentioned and (b) i was incredibly confused by the consistency of the sauce,  mine was rather thin.

everything mixed together made great and easy leftovers though!

will make again :) tasted great

This was disappointing and I'm not sure why. The only thing I can think of is I don't like sun dried tomatoes. The flavor was different. I might make this again minus the sun dried tomatoes.

I just cooked this recipe as-is (but doubling the sauce) for three of my best guy friends.  They couldn't get enough of the sauce.  So, even without all the alterations it is still a great recipe.  My only complaint is that it dirties a lot of dishes.

GREAT GREAT GREAT!! I made this for a regular family dinner but i will most definitely make for the holiday season. It tastes like something The Cheesecake Factory would serve! The only change i made was doubling the recipe and i added mushrooms with the tomatoes! Came out delicious.

Very good! I actually forgot to use the other 1/4 of chicken stock so my sauce was very creamy. My husband and daughter both loved this to. This will be going into the family cookbook and will try this out when I have friends over.
Thanks for a good recipe.

i actually made this for my other half as he is extremely fussy when it comes to food for dinner and he couldnt fault this absolutly beautiful, but i did however make double the quantity of sauce and a bit more and that turned out the best way. I put a bit of butter in the sauce pan with the garlic then added the cut up sun dried tomatos then the stock then the cream and used the hand held blender in it for a sec but not too long just so its a little chunky then fried the chicken in the electric fry pan till they were done and added the sauce to the fry pan and done it asll in that that way the chicken sucks up all the juices- excellent

I made this for my family a week ago and they are still talking about how great it was. Used the tomatoes in oil and used part of the oil to cook my garlic in,,as others suggested. And I cut my chicken prior to cooking it. Thickened my sauce with corn starch. Was a grand dish. My husband is Italian and loved it!!! Can't wait to make it again!!! A definate 5 star!!!!

This is a delicious and easy dish to make for company, it is so good. Very restaurant quality. My hubby eats this with the tomatoes picked out and still loves it. I love the sun dried tomatoes and use oil based ones, turns out fine, just a bit greasier. So good!!!

I followed some of the other reviews and doubled the sauce recipe, and I'm glad I did because it was delicious.

In addition to the garlic I included 2-3 shallots (minced).  

I found that I did not need to add any salt to this recipe.

Awesome! My husband who is not a pasta lover didn't think he would enjoy it. He thought it was FANTASTIC and enjoyed every last drop. I did double the sauce recipe.

I thought this recipe was really good.  I know I messed it up a bit...My 2 year old daughter was cranky, hanging on my leg!  But it still came out really good...even my extremely picky 18 year old liked it! I used dry white wine instead of chicken broth...and I didn't have sun dried tomatoes so I used a can of diced...I know that altered the the taste...but it was still really good.  I'd say this recipe is pretty much fool proof!!!!  Thanks for sharing!  I'll try to make it right next time...LOL!

This dish was absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was that I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil instead of the dry packaged kind.  It gave it more flavor.

This is a magical recipe. The kind of recipe that is wonderful in every way: easy to make, quick to make, a feast for the taste buds, a feast for the eyes - all in all a dish to impress!!

This one is definitely going in my recipe box!

I added more sun-dried tomatoes than specified in the recipe. 

Louise.

Followed the recipe as written and it was very good, but we had to skimp on the sauce a bit as it had reduced significantly. Next time I will double the sauce and perhaps play with some seasoning, or add more basil.

I made as the recipe stated, but for some reason the sauce curdled, so I went ahead & doubled the sauce, after which it was fine.  I too added wine & cornstarch to the sauce...  while I enjoyed the texture, we didn't care for the flavor.  I'll try again as the recipe states & re-rate accordingly.

This recipe was a great weeknight addition that was quick yet flavorful. I took the advice of other reviewers and sliced the chicken before I sauteed it. I also added some corn starch and 1/4 c sherry to the sauce both for thickening and flavor. Turned out great!

Made this tonight for family dinner night we have every week with my brother's family.  Everyone loved this one.  We thought that it might need a little more salt.  We did double the recipe for 8 servings.  Substituted 1/4 cup of the chicken broth for Marsala wine and also added about a cup of chopped baby bellas.  Yummy!

Love it! This is a great copy cat of Macaroni Grill's dish. Truly a delightful dish! I only changed one thing: I added sauteed mushrooms to the final sauce before serving.

This was FANTASTIC! I changed just a couple of things. First, I doubled the sauce recipe. I also added chopped portobello mushrooms, and also used a smaller, whole grain pasta. It was OUTSTANDING! Everyone loved it!

For the amount of time and number of pans it took to make this dish, the pay off wasn't worth it.  The chicken itself was quite good but the sauce was pretty boring.

This was fantastic! Even the rest of week as leftovers it was supberb! I made this for college sons birhtday dinner. I 4x the recipe. I had 10 guests. I did not use the recipe calculator-- I just 4x all ingredients. I cooked the chicken as directed, but since I had so much to cook, I browned all chicken in pan with oil as directed and had all drippings.. I did not cook chicken all the way thru. I transferred all to platter and then grilled till done. Since this was for a crowd,I sliced chicken into strips and cut into 2 inch pieces. I didnt want to plate each persons plate so I served it all family style.. cooked fettucini, sauce and chicken--mixed all in bowl. I did not use all the sauce, there was probablly 3 cups left. That came in handy when saving all leftovers, I poured remaining sauce over everything and that kept it all moist and extra creamy. (you know how sometimes left overs get dry)
My husband, and our daughters boyfriend ate left overs for a few days this week and each raved how this was fantastic with each reheating.. A definite one to make and save!!  Definitely restaurant quality.

Mmmmmm......I didn't even use this recipe for the chicken...I was ONLY looking for the sauce to put over some mushroom ravioli.  I DID end up putting it over some stuffed chicken thighs and it was delicious.  It tasted so much like my favorite dish from my favorite Italian restaurant.  Changes I made: Before adding the cream, I pureed some of the sauce with my immersion blender.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken.  I added about 2 tsp of sugar. Finally, I added about 1/4 cup of smoked gouda which really set it off.  But even if I hadn't changed anything at all, it's still a 5-star recipe. Definitely fine dining. ;-)  Thanks so much!!

I've made this recipe 10+ times and it's a favorite at my house.  A word of warning though... You DEFINITELY need to double the sauce portion.  I also recommend whisking the cream with ~2 tablespoons of flour before adding it to the sauce - it really thickens it up.  And we love to add artichoke hearts as well.  YUM!

Super rich. But very good. The boyfriend was thrown off by all the dry tomatoes but my other friends were ooo'ing and aaahh'ing.  I used the bottled kind and not the bagged as was suggested and it was still very good.

this dish is very easy to make and tastes like something you would order out.  the only thing that i changed that made it even tastier is that i used 1/4 cup of white wine to deglaze the pan instead of the chicken broth.

I tried this last week.  While it wasn't bad, it is fairly bland.  I was expecting the garlic and the basil to give it a little punch, but honestly it was almost cafeteria-style.  It smelled great while cooking, and definitely wasn't "bad," it just wasn't exciting enough to make again.

Another favorite in my home. So creamy and different from the everyday chicken dishes. The tomatoes definitely add a little something extra to this dish.

Very good. I did make some minor changes. I cut the chicken into strips before frying and I added a cup of white wine in addition to the heavy cream with a TB of corn starch (recommended in another review). It tasted wonderful and made the perfect amount of yummy sauce. Tastes better than you get in an Italian restaurant!

This turned out really well.  I opted to use quite a bit less cream (used half and half light 5% instead) to try and cut back on the calories/fat.  I also added approx 1/4 cup of white wine and served it with whole wheat rotini (didn't have ww fettuccini) and steamed broc on the side.  This recipe did have really good flavour and will likely make again as I am just beginning to acquire a 'like' for sun dried tomatoes!

It's Very yummy! However, I really think the sauce should be doubled or even tripled! I started everything at roughly the same time... the pasta and sauce were done right on time (11 mins), but the chicken took the longest. Next time I think I'll double the sauce recipe, slice the chicken into strips and start it first.

I made this a few days ago and EVERYONE loved it.  It was very easy to make and what little leftovers there were tasted even better the next day.  The only thing I changed was that I pout my chicken and pasta right in the sauce and simmered together, instead of adding on top of pasta.

omg this stuff is so good! this is made at least 2 times a month at my house. the left overs are just as tasty. my fiacne always asks me to make this. i try to do it as often as i can but i like to mix things up a little bit.... if it were up to him we would have this every day of the week. i would recommend adding maybe one extra clove of garlic. and a little bit more cream. other wise it's a little runny. thanks for recipe it was a hit!

This recipe was really good.  We put some chopped up ports in it, so we probably should have made a little more sauce, but it was really yummy.
Thanks!

I followed the directions (except for substituting white wine for broth) and it was actually quite bland for my taste.  Needed more garlic, and seasonings.

This was pretty good but way too salty for my taste. I barely used any salt on the chicken too. Next time I will try using light sodium chicken broth and see if that makes a difference.

I followed "Cookiequeen"'s suggestions and it turned out glarghglrlgh (ala Homer Simpson) ~ delicious!  I skipped the fettuccini (too many calories) and served it with Penne with Garlicky Broccolini from this site (no need to cook it with the bacon, btw).  Watch the salt, it doesn't really need any once you reduce the sauce.  Very satisfying, would definitely satisfy a desire for Olive Garden.

Absolutely delicious!  What a wonderful taste.  No adjustments had to be made!  I made this recipe with the 'pasta in pink vodka sauce' recipe; what a great combination!  Both my girlfriend and I craved the meal.  I'll definitely make it again!

This is really great and easy! I did what another reviewer, Mandy, suggested. I pounded the chicken and started all the pots going at once and everything got done at about the same time. I used 1.5 Tbls of oil from the tomatoes and 1/2 Tbls oil to cook the chicken in. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used 1.5 tsp dried basil.  I had quadrupled the pasta and tripled the sauce and found I had way way too much sauce. If you do not reduce the sauce too much you will have enough as stated in the recipe, if not more than enough. This sauce is like a spice, you don't need a lot to have a great dish! Thanks, Holly, this is a real keeper!!

I have never posted a review for a recipe but knew I had to when I made this recipe. This was easy and sooo delicious! I read some of the reviews and also made some changes. They were:
1. Cut up chicken in bite sized pieces and soaked in buttermilk first.
2. Added baby bella mushrooms. Yum! 
3. I didn't add in the last bit of chicken broth at the end. The sauce was perfect to me at that point.  I sauteed the mushrooms in the broth instead. 

Overall, excellent recipe. I will make this again.

This is one of my favorite recipes right now.  Have made a few times and love it.  I add only one thing and that is mushrooms.  I sauteed them with garlic and just place them on top of the chicken before serving.  DELICIOUS!

Pretty good.  There was barely enough sauce for all four of us, so I would recommend doubling the sauce, at least.  I also used a little cornstarch in water to thicken it up a bit.  Not bad.

This was very tasty. However, there was not enough sauce to enjoy on both the chicken and the pasta. So I just served it on the chicken. I agree with someone's suggestion to make the sauce last since it does reduce while staying warm.

A terrific everyday dish! With the exception of boiling the pasta, I made everything early in the day. I made the sauce, sauteed the chicken (which I cut into bite sized pieces as others had suggested)added it to the sauce, put the pot in the icebox and forgot about it until dinner. I reheated it slowly, served it over angel hair and a side dish of sauteed spinach. A very easy and delicious recipe. Thank you for sharing!

My family loved this.  Rich and delicious, it was easier to make then I thought it would be.  It's wonderful when a dish made at home taste just as good
(if not better) then one made at a  restaurant, and for a quarter of the price too!  It will become a part of our 'special meals' collection.

Oh my goodness! Was I eating at a fancy Italian restaurant or my own home?? This was fantastic, by far one of the best recipes on here!! I doubled the sauce, & next time will thicken it a little bit w/ cornstarch. The flavor is amazing, & it really is an easy recipe for as good as it tastes. This is my new "company" recipe!! Thanks a bunch!

I have no barely have any experience in cooking but this dish was easy and was a hit at my dinner party!  I had to sign up for this site just to leave a  comment - it's the least I can do.  The sauce does reduce quickly though so be sure to make more of it.  The recipe is fool proof. I recently chose it to make it again for my BF's Mother when she came to visit and she thouroughly enjoyed it as well.  Thanks!  A recipe for impressing the future in-law...you're the best!

This was excellent!  We did however flour the chicken breast before cooking. I would definitely double the sauce next time I make it.

This was fabulous! It's perfect for a candlelit dinner with your boyfriend, I know mine loved it. I was a bit worried it wouldn't turn out well, because this was the first time I'd ever made a cream sauce, but it actually wasn't that hard and it ended up being delicious. I paired it with the spinach caprese salad and garlic bread, and it made a great romantic meal.

Oh my sweet, fattening heaven!  This recipe is very tasty.  I made a few minor modifications but mostly made it as written.  First, I did use the oil packed sun dried tomatoes as others recommended.  I was worried that my young children would turn their noses up at the sun dried tomato pieces so after I simmered them awhile, I put the whole mixture into the blender then returned it to the stove and added the cream in the next step.  No big chunks of sundried tomato but still had the intense flavor they give.  I also poached the chicken in broth instead of pan frying it and that created very soft, tender chicken which I cubed and mixed with the sauce and bow tie pasta.  Huge hit with the kids.

This recipe is great!  I cooked the chicken on the grill instead to make it easier.  I agree with others that if you like a lot of sauce, be sure to double this recipe.  Also, I do not recommend replacing the heavy cream with half & half, as the sauce did not thicken up.  But this is a super easy and tasty entree.

We all liked this dish, it was not as exciting as I expected. Just good, a little on the blah side...not 5 star. Used half & half, so maybe that made the difference?

When I get the taste for a 5 star restaurant meal but don't have the extra money to indulge myself, my daughter or I will prepare this dish. We bring out the fine linens, a good bottle of wine, some candlelight (depending on time of day) and experience a culinary delight. Never tasted anything so good. Even my 3 year-old granddaughter loves it (my husband, on the other hand, prefers basic meat and potatoes - go figure).

Really good!!.. I didnt have heavy cream so i used whole milk and 2 tbls of corn starch. Also, I did double the recipe so it was very creamy. I didnt have sundried tomatoes but I had a sundried tomato pesto and used that instead..worked perfectly!!

The first time I don't know what happened to it, the sauce was pink &  very thick.  I told myself, that I would try this recipe one more time. This time around, I doubled the sauce, used 1/2 & 1/2 & the garlic chicken broth, which made a bit of a difference, I used 2 tsps of cornstarch to thicken it just enough to coat the noodles.. I added about 5 garlic cloves, mushrooms and onion.  I started everything at the same time so it did get done at the same time & it did.  One thing I omited was step 3, really ya don't need to do it.  Oh and this time around my sauce was like perfect, just like a creamy color, not pink!! Other than that, my mom even enjoyed the Chicken Milano... It was really good.. I am going to try next time a white wine.. see what that will do.

I've given this only 4 stars for 2 reasons. First, I subbed fat free half and half in the sauce to eliminate a lot of the fat.  The sauce was still very good, just maybe not 5 star good.  The second reason was that this recipe was time consuming not only in the preparation, but what a lot of dirty pots and dishes to clean up after!

This was very good.  I didn't have enough cream so I used milk to make up the difference. I doubled the ingredients for the sauce as someone else suggested and it turned out great.  Will definately make this again.

It was just ok. I found the sauce a tad overwhelming. And the chicken needed more seasoning-it was quite plain even with the sauce over it.

We loved this one. I'll definately make it again. Next time I'll double the sauce because I like extra. Thanks!

This was excellent. My German mother-in-law, who had never used sun-dried tomatoes before, raved about it. I was expecting there to be more sauce, however.

Adding cornstarch with a bit of water is a must for this recipe. Also, the sauce will thicken up when mixed with the pasta. I do cut the chicken up in cubes before cooking, add sliced mushrooms and use bow tie pasta. As much as possible use fresh basil - it makes a big difference. This is one of our favorite dishes from this site!

I am not sure what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe as much as possible.  The only thing I did different was that I cooked the chicken and then added all the stuff into it.  I did not use three pots.  I did that because chicken seasoned with only salt and pepper taste like nothing.  I have to say putting everything with the chicken gave the chicken a good flavor but the sauce never got thicke.  It was like a soup.  My husband liked it but he asked me if we where eating chicken noddle soup.  In all the I would probably make it again but just the chicken with the sauce since at the end there was hardly no sauce and it never got thicke.  Maybe I should have used corn starch.

MMM this was great! I made a few adjustments though. I doubled the sauce and used white wine (chardonnay) instead of chicken broth. This added great flavor but next time I think I will use half wine and half chicken broth or a sweeter wine. I also added thinly sliced mushrooms. It was excellent. My mother in law wanted me to copy Macaroni Grill's chicken Milano and she loved it and so did my super picky husband! Oh and to thicken the sauce I did add a little bit of flour.

I had some problems with my chicken--it was much to thick to cook quickly, and was still partially frozen.  Which means that it didn't do the pretty caramelizing.  Drat.  I really like this recipe though--I would recommend flattening thicker chicken breasts.  The flavor was a little different but good.  I will definitely be making  this again.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish but wished I would have made more sauce.  Unfortunately I didn't read other reviews until afterwards.  Definitely will double to sauce next time.  It also seemed like the prep and cook time was alot longer than what was stated.  Will definitely make again though.  Thanks for the nice recipe!

The flavor was really great. It took some time, and I'm not great at multi-tasking, so it wasn't a good idea for me to make it as part of a many course meal, but it was pretty good. My chicken wasn't halved, so it took a little longer to cook, and it was kind of tough by the time I was done, but that's my fault. Neither my husband nor I care for tomatoes that much, so we picked out the sun-dried tomatoes, but they gave it a great flavor and I wouldn't dream of omitting them. Over all, it was a great dish. I did have a hard time serving everything hot. The chicken was out of the pan too long.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I and we both loved it.  I did make something alterations that may be helpful.  If you are using chicken breasts as therecipe suggests, I would cut them into strips and cook them on all side as directed.  The whole breasts, at least mine, depending on their size, won't cookall the way trough.  Other than that, it was delicious!

Yum!  The first time I made this pasta dish, I couldn't help but say with every bite "Wow!  This is good."  I have made it a few times since and have loved it every time.  I have also shared this recipe with so many people, many of whom have called right after eating it to comment on how great it is.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is not as complicated as the directions seem.  I think it would be great with grilled seasoned chicken. I used 6 small chicken breasts because we like a lot of chicken.  Next time I will add more cream and thicken with cornstarch and kick it up with a little cayenne and some red pepper flakes.  Used bowtie pasta and it reheated well the next day. Thanks for this great recipe.

I thought the flavors in this recipe were really good.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream to cut some of the fat.  The next time I make this, I will double the sauce b/c it was just a little dry for my taste.

This recipe gets a big five from me. I've made a slightly different recipe for Chicken Milano in the past, and tried making the sauce a day ahead and reheating it the following day.  That worked out really well, the sauce was a bit thin compared to the day before, so I added a little water combined with flour to thicken slightly.  I had also added maybe 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to my sauce.  This made coming home on my late night and scrounging up dinner not so bad, just pan fried chicken, cooked my pasta, warmed my sauce and I was done!

This was amazing!!  I made this last night.  I did substitute white wine (Chardonnay) for the chicken broth as I wanted to get rid of it and used half fresh basil and half dried.  Also, I sliced the chicken breasts before frying as I thought this would reduce cooking time.  It was wonderful.  I think I did reduce the sauce too much and ended up adding some pasta water.  Great flavor!

This is one of the best pasta and chicken dishes I have ever made, and is on par with anything I have ordered at restaurants. I used three chicken breasts and 1 package of fresh fettucini (350 grams) and the portions were just perfect. The sauce was sweet, slightly fruity, with lots of garlic shining through. It was very creamy and stayed that way throughout. A+.

Oh, *wow* was this recipe delicious.  Rich and creamy and sweet and tangy.  I prefer marinara sauces over white sauces, but this was delicious.  The chicken, simply cooked, was just the right compliment to the dish.  Nothing overwhelmed it, and it really was perfect with some crusty bread!  I wouldn't change a thing.  It was definitely worth the extra work (p.s. to all of my fellow lazy chefs out there: don't be lazy with this one!  watch the simmering, cream sauce like a *hawk*!)  Def. five stars, man.  I'm so making this again.

this dish is worth the effort! I will add more garlic next time. Very flavorful sauce (I used 2 chicken breasts for myself & 2 small boys), so the amount of sauce was fine for us. It definitely tasted like restaurant quality and was just as yummy reheated the next day. Only thing a bit weird was my sauce was pink from the tomatoes!

I most have done something wrong because my sauce was never thick, but it still tasted good.  I didn't use the sun-dried tomatoes, instead I used onions and mushrooms.  This recipe makes the house smell great too.

The flavor was good but it needed more sauce. I would have also liked to have it all mixed up rather then layered. Probably will not make again

This was excellent!  Only thing I did different was use fat free half and half and less chicken.  Great dish, good enough for company, loved the fresh basil and sun dried tomato mix, thanks!

This has become a favorite in our household.  I double the pasta since I prefer to go lighter on the sauce and there is still enough to coat and cover the entire dish.   Thanks for sharing!

So far this is our absolute favorite from this website. We cooked this when my husbands' bosses came over for dinner and everyone was impressed and went for seconds! We make extra sauce as we like it so much and use dried basil as we always have plenty.

I made this for dinner and we loved it!! Since I do not like bland food I usually sprinkle a little seasoning on the meat before preparing, this will help keep the chicken from being bland. This is a recipe that I make at least once a month.

I wasn't impressed. There wasn't enough sauce for 8oz of pasta in my opinion. The chicken was bland so I simmered it down with the sauce after cutting it in chunks and it tasted better. However, I will probably not make this again.

I really dont know why this recipe is rated so highly.  The flavor is so odd, bland, and just not very good at all.  Followed exactly and couldnt figure out what was wrong with it.  Fiancee said that maybe it needs more spice, possibly grilled shrimp instead of chicken and less SD tomato.  i dont know, doubt ill make again, a lot of work.  chicken was good and moist, but thats about it.

Holly Thank you for this recipe. I have made it several times now for family and will make for my next dinner party.  I cut the chicken up into chunks before cooking, it speeds things up. The last time I used a lower fat cream (5%) and it still was delicious.  I have used fresh and dried basil both are fine. It is so easy and will wow guests and family!  We LOVE this one.

This is really good, try adding some chili flakes while simmering the sauce, and some cooked chopped bacon near the end... I did and it turned out fantastic.

I love this recipe and have already made it a few times.  I found that it's better to cut up the chicken in smaller bit size pieces after cooking it and adding all of it to the sauce, it absorbs the flavors better.  I also sauted some mushrooms and added it to the sauce as well.

This was a terrific recipe. I only made a few changes: used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast (very tasty) and I added a couple of tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the sauce. Also, didn't have fresh basil on hand so had to use dried. Taste was great!!! I can only imagine what it will taste like with fresh. The husband loved it!!! A definite keeper.

This receipe is great.  Since having to take over cooking chores for my mother in law for the past year, she now thinks I'm just the greatest cook.  Shes an old southern lady and didn't care for my cooking till the last six months thanks to all recipes.  The only thing I did different with this receipe was I used olive oil and cut the chicken into chunks, sprinkle chicken with salt, pepper, galic powder and add a clove of garlic to the oil while chicken cooked.  Discard clove of garlic before adding chicken to sauce.

Definitely the best chicken recipe to impress someone at dinner.  I did follow other suggestions and double the sauce recipe.  Also cut the chicken into strips before cooking, faster to cook and easier to control when it is done.

My husband & I enjoyed this (every fattening bite :) I did double the sauce by using a whole can of chicken broth & more heavy cream. I also added more garlic & mushrooms. Delicious!!

I've made this several times for many people of all ages. Everyone loves it. I even poured this sauce over salmon and pasta for my son who couldn't stop eating it! This is a terrific sauce with mushrooms over garlic mashed potatoes too.

Recipe was excellent. I doubled the sauce but not the tomatos. I used tomato in jar. Not recommended because they made the sauce oily. I used half and half and thicken with corn starch. I julienne a red bell pepper and an onion to stir fry right after the chicken was done. This gave the dish a sweet crisp flavor. I seasoned the chicken with a Cajun seasoning. All reviews helped a lot.

This was ok.  Be sure to add seasonings to your taste - it was pretty bland.  I used half and half and would NOT do that again.

Good & Easy...make sure to use dried tomatoes rather than jarred - which are difficult to dice and saute. I used angel hair pasta - my family loved it! Served with asiago bread and ceasar salad. Only gave it 5 stars b/c I can only say it was good, not great.

Great!!  My husband's new favorite meal!  I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled the sauce (and I'm gald I did).  
I thought the sauce was just the right consistency - not too thick, but stuck to the pasta well.  Will definitely make again!

I made this for my husband and I for a special Christmas Eve dinner. I thought this was pretty good but he thought it was wonderful and one of the best dishes I have made. I took other's advice and added a little Cajun seasoning to the chicken when I cooked it, other than that, I followed the instructions. I still prefer the Cajun Chicken Pasta from this site. And this makes more like 6-7 servings.

This was pretty good.  We thought it was a twist to the way we usually make chicken with noodles.  It was easy to prepare, and one we'll make again.

We served this for some guests and everyone loved it.  There were 4 adults and 2 children and we customized the recipe for 8 and there was plenty.  We have leftovers.  It wild tasty yet mild enough to serve to any picky eaters.  The sundried tomato was the best part...

This is delicious! I added extra sun dried tomatoes and simmered the sauce longer so it would have extra flavor!  This will definitely be made again in my house!

I thought this was awesome.  But my family hated it.  Maybe they should have ate at McDonalds!  I guess you have to like sun dried tomatoes. I doubled the sauce as others did.  I didn't feel that the pasta was necessary but I did try it with bow tie.  Next time I think I will serve it with mash potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this recipe with the sun-dried, freshly diced, and canned diced.  For me, the sun-dried just didnt cut it.  Avoid that and you have one amazing, very rich, restaurant quality pasta.

This was excellent!!  My whole family of seven loved it!!  The only thing I would change is to season the chicken a little bit more.  I think it needs a little more than just salt and pepper.  My family felt like they were eating in a fancy restaurant.......thanks for the recipe!!!!!

It was a hit at dinner and I will make it again. I used canned milk and whole grain pasta to make it a little more heart friendly. Served it with a nice tossed salad, wholegrain baguette and sun tea. My guests were both impressed and satisfied.

Excellent dish! The kids loved it too! I used regular cream instead of heavy, and it still came out very good. Had to simmer sauce a little longer than anticipated, I think do to using a lighter cream. Also, used bow-tie pasta. GREAT!!

Toddler & preschooler even loved it. Used milk instead of heavy cream b/c didn't have it on hand; added cornstarch to thicken. Reminds me of a dish at favorite restaurant...will add goat cheese and a couple of veggies (asparagus?)in the end like their version next time.

I LOOOOVE this recipe!  I make more sauce, because I like my pasta dripping with sauce.  Besides that, I don't change a thing, the mild flavors and creamy texture of this dish are just wonderful.

Maybe it was a mistake that I used half and half instead of heavy cream in attempts to cut calories and fat.  The sauce turned out terrible.

This is a great recipe. I modify the recipe a bit becayse my grand mother does not like rich sauce. So, I diluted the sauce and add more chicken broth. Now, she wants the recipe.

Awesome!  My only changes were to make this with half and half and add some green onions.  It's hard to perfect on perfection! My husband LOVED this one. This also reheats quite well - just added a little milk when reheating to thin the sauce.  This one will be a regular in our house!  Thanks SO MUCH!

Great!  I made a few modifications.  In addition to salt and pepper, I added some Italian seasoning to the chicken.  I recommend that you cut the chicken before cooking.  It will reduce your cooking time significantly.  I had mushrooms on hand, and really wish I had added them, they would have been great.  I wish the sauce was a little thicker--when you add it to the chicken broth, it becomes somewhat thin, but the taste is outstanding.  I also added some grated parmesan cheese to the cream sauce, as was recommended to thicken the sauce, but I don't think it helped there, but might have done something to the flavor.  Peas would also be a good addition.  I used fresh fettucine, as I know it cooks so much more quickly.  Finally, I used olive oil rather than butter and canola instead og vegetable.  Thanks Holly!!!

This is a wonderful recipe and I have made it many times. The sauce is always too runny though. I'll try adding cornstarch as someone else suggested.
My fiance also thinks this is great!

This was really great - a bit more time consuming than I had thought, but worth it.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled the sauce, added a splash of vodka, and used fresh fettuccini.  I will definitely be making this again.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  It's very simple to make.  When the weather is nice, we grill the chicken instead of cooking it in oil-less mess on the stove!  I also have to thicken the sauce a little with cornstarch.  Without the thickening, the sauce can be a little too runny.  My kids are not fond of the sauce, but they love the chicken and the noodles plain with a little butter!  Great recipe!!!

This was awesome!  The sauce is to die for.  One thing...my kids are little so didn't want the sauce.  It was a good thing because there was really only enough sauce for two servings. If your entire party of four wants sauce, try doubling the sauce portion.

Wonderful!  I thought it could have used just a little more sauce but the flavor was great.  I used a little more tomatoes than were called for and I think I will stick to the amount called for next time.

This was a really great meal.  I even left out the cream since I forgot it at the grocery store.  I used milk and cheese to substitute, and as scary as that sounds, it worked out really well.  Will add to our recipe box.  Thanks!

Awesome recipe! It was easy to make (I'm not much of a cook) and tasted great. I topped with some sauted mushrooms and cubed the chicken & added to the sauce as others suggested. I will definitely be making this one again. Thanks Holly.

OMG... Delish!! I have made this recipe several times now for when we have company over and everytime people ask me for a copy. I do, however near the end of cooking time, add  some capers, parm cheese and sometimes artichokes(to kick it up a noch). But definately great the way it is. It really does have that restaurant quality to it. Thanks a million for sharing!!

Great and pretty quick.  Hubby was impressed.  Similar to Pasta Milana at the Macaroni Grill.

This recipe was pretty good, but it definitely fell short of my expectations. It was fairly bland and tasted like it needed pepper. It was also thin and runny, although this might have been my fault for adding some of the broth late.

I forgot to rate this when I made it, and it definitely deserves the best reviews ever!  Way more than 5 stars!  I made it for my mom's birthday dinner, and everyone, from the 1 year old to the 50 year old, loved it.  It has the best flavors and is by far the best chicken recipe that I have ever had or made.  Better than any pasta in the finest restaurant! Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was really tasty. The sauce did not thicken too much so I added cornstach to thicken it up. I also cut up the chicken into bite size pieces and added it to the sauce. This gave it lots of flavor.

This was not creamy at all, especially when re-heated.  Maybe the cream I used was not "heavy" enough.  My husband and I also found that it had very little flavour.  I think it would be much better with some green onion and maybe some red pepper flakes.

This pasta dish is delicious!  Just make sure to use heavy cream instead of half and half (heavy cream is not always available where I live) because it doesn't thicken up easily.

Very Very Very good!!! And a lot easier than expected, I also used 3/4 parts half and half and 1/4 part heavy cream and it still turned out delicously creamy! Used margarine instead of butter, 3 cloves garlic and added about 4 Tbs. finely chopped red onion with it. Thank you for such a easy yet yummy and impressive dinner recipe.

This is definately creamy which is what I like but I thought it lacked flavor.  The chicken probably needs to be added in with the sauce to get some flavor.

This recipe was fantastic!  I used the sundried tomatoes packed in oil.  I like the taste better (with the spices that are added to the jars).  However, this does tend to make the sauce very oily, so its probably best to press out the oil before adding the tomatoes.  The chicken also needs something more, maybe marinating in the oil from the sundried tomatoes?  I added italian seasoning and garlic powder to the chicken.  It may just be better to cut the chicken into strips and add it to the sauce.  Thanks Holly for the recipe!

Fabulous!  I doubled the sauce and used a combination of plain sun-dried tomatoes and ones in oil -- really tasty.  I also cut the chicken into strips before sauteing.  I think this sauce would be great with shrimp too.  I will try with half and half next time, because it is very rich.

GREAT recipe.  I found that I put too much salt on the chicken before sauteing.  The fresh basil made all the difference.  Thank you for this recipe, it's now added to my family's list of favorites!

This dish had no taste at all. I thought I would give it a try because I love pasta dishes. I would have to add at least 3 to 4 spices to perk this one up. Not sure I will try it though.

I made this tonight for dinner with friends.  It was very tasty!  I doubled the sauce, cut the chicken into strips before sauteing, and used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch, and served over spinach fettucine.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful!  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, Italian spices, and onion powder. I don't think it would have had enough flavor without these spices. I also used half and half instead of the cream and thickened it with cornstarch and water.  I will be making this one often!  Thank you Holly!

Wonderful!  Although the recipe looks a bit laborious, it was surprisingly easy to throw together.  First time using the dry packaged sun-dried tomatoes - delicious.  Made a few minor changes to the recipe...Substituted olive oil for the butter and vegetable oil, used extra garlic, used garlic salt instead of plain salt to season the chicken, added a small can of portabella mushrooms (drained), cubed the chicken and added to the cream sauce after cooking, and served over angel hair pasta.  A company-worthy recipe.

This was awesome!  The sauce is delicious.  I skipped over keeping the chicken warm and just added it to the cream sauce with the basil and chicken broth.  Seemed like an unnecessary step.  I also added portabello mushrooms, more garlic, used the sundried tomatoes in oil(which added a lot more flavor since they're packed in oil and spices) and cut up the chicken into small pieces.  Next time, I think I'll use scallops or shrimp in lieu of the chicken.  Will definitely make again and again!

I made some changes to this recipe as well, I went with what others had said and increased the garlic amount I also used shallots (2 of them) and instead of cooking them in butter I used olive oil. I also used 3 parts half and half and 1 part heavy cream.
I made this for our family dinner night, everyone but myself was impressed. I like the texture just not the flavor. More spices are needed.

This was wonderful!  I tossed the chicken and sauce with bowtie pasta. I actually cut up the chicken into smaller pieces before cooking it, and it worked out great. Both my husband and I agreed that we would definately make this again.

Possibly the best chicken dish I've ever made.  I loved this recipe!  As others had suggested I too added mushrooms and doubled the sauce.  When I doubled the sauce I didn't have enough heavy cream so I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk.  It turned out perfect.  I also breaded the chicken before I sauteed it.  This recipe took a little extra time but soooo worth the extra effort.  Will definetly make again and again!

Pretty good dish, one that me and my partner have a bit of a different opinion.  She thinks it is a 5 star, however, since I'm the cook, the last word is up to me.  Good in taste, but too many things to coordinate...can never have everything ready to serve at the same time; the chicken is always waiting. All in all, good for the family, but not to make an impression on guests....missing that 'something' which would place it in a 5 star category.

I made this last night and it was very inexpensive easy and absolutely delicious! I loved it!  I did not think it was bland at all. This was like something you order from a resaurant. My husband who is a pasta guru also loved it. I will definitely be making it often.

Splendiferous!!  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and dipped in egg then italian seasoned breadcrumbs...THEN I stirfried it till done (not as fancy, but just easier for me).

I found that I did not have to thicken the sauce...I just let it reduce through simmering on the stove until the pasta was nearly finished.  

SO GOOD!

Excellent! I didn't have the fresh basil, so I substituted 1 tablespoon of basil pesto. I also used Penne pasta instead of fettuccini.

It was a delicious dish. My boyfriend and I liked it so much. I added a drizzle of wine and some black pepper that made it flavorful. Thank you so much for the recipe! This will be one of our most favorite pasta dish.

Absolutely delicious!  My fiance said we no longer have to go out to dinner, it tasted just like a restaurant.  Have made it without the chicken and used penne pasta and it's just as good!  A permanent addition to my recipe files!

Tastes good and easy to make!  The sauce wasn't very thick--but the combination of flavors was great.  I'll make this again.

I found this okay. I wish I had used the oil packed sun dried tomatoes as I think they have much better flavor. I used a whole can of broth and about 1 1/4 cup cream and it was plenty. I must be missing something with the fresh basil. Maybe our plants are too mature, I don't use it much. I think I will make this again and add some capers, white wine and maybe some dried basil.

I followed other suggestions and made extra sauce.  I was glad I did it, because the flavor was great and we wanted more.  My only issue was that it was a bit thin.  This was the first time I'd made a cream sauce though, so maybe I just didn't do it right.

This recipe turned out really well, it has a very prodominent sun dried tomato flavor.  When I made it though, instead of cream I used skim milk and a little cornstarch to thicken it. It turned out not quite as thick as it would have with cream, but it still had a really good flavor.  I'd make it again.

We did not care for this.  The flavor of the chicken was good, but we felt the sun dried tomotoes/pasta was missing something.

This was the first time I made a cream sauce and the dish tasted very good. It took me close to an hour, so I wouldn't call it the quickest recipe. I am not sure whether I was supposed to cut up the sundried tomatoes and try to eat them or just use them to give flavor to the sauce (which is what my husband did - he loved the recipe, too). I used about 1/2 lb chicken breast, sliced and tenderized them, which worked very well. I didn't have heavy cream, so I used whipping cream. Thanks, I will definitely be making this again.

Pretty good. I love cream sauces, so anything with cream in it is a hit with me. I had my parents over and they enjoyed this meal. If you liked this, I tried another that was easier, quicker, and a little tastier: Cajun Chicken Pasta.

The recipe was very tasty, but the sauce was not thick enough. I am not sure if I did something wrong or if there is way to make it thicker. I am not too sure about the whole cup of chx broth.

This was a tasty recipe, though I had to double the sauce.  It isn't a recipe for kids, unless theylike the pungent flavors of sundried tomatoes.
