Simple recipe that goes a long way. I forget to get the pasta sauce that the recipe calls for so I made a few changes. I kept the pasta and chicken seperate. And I added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese to the pasta/broccoli mixture as well as the cream cheese. Pretty Darn Tasty!

I used Caesar dressing instead of the roasted red pepper and Parmesan (it's what I had on hand). I also didn't have any pasta sauce so I used a can of tomato sauce and a can of Italian style diced tomatoes. It was tasty! My family devoured it! Will definitely make again.

So delicious! After I made the sauce I loved it so much that I added extra cream cheese... the sauce ended up looking almost like a vodka sauce just perfect!

This was so quick and delicious. I was doubtful about the broccoli but the end product is so tasty. I recommend it for any busy cook. I did use regular cream cheese that I had left over from the holidays but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

My family loved this! The only changes I made were to reduce the pasta to 3 cups and increased the broccoli to 5 cups and used non fat cream cheese. Made it lower calorie for us. Really good easy and quick. Will make often. Thanks!

This was a great recipe! Very easy! I did not have any of the Kraft Dressing so I just grilled the chicken in Olive oil and spices including the garlic. I did a short cut AND a money saving by stiring in a bag of nuked broccoli when it was time to stir all items.

This was just okay. The color of the sauce turned out to be dark orange and it was not appetizing looking and it wasn't the greatest tasting. If I was to make again and not sure that I would I would go very light with the pasta sauce so as to try to keep a lighter color.

Quick and easy! You can use any dressing to cook the chicken. The broccoli cooks perfectly. I cooked a 16oz bag of farfalle but didn't add it all to the sauce because I like a lot of sauce in relation to pasta. My 3 & 5 year olds who don't care much for red sauce ate this well!

This was a delicious dish. I had never done chicken that way before with the pasta and broccoli all mixed together with the sauce and chicken. We loved it. I will definitely make this again! As a side note my chicken breasts were quite thick and it took about an hour to cook them in the skillet using the lid to cover them and seal the heat. It was worth the wait though! The cream cheese mixed with the pasta sauce was mouth wateringly good. If it helps anyone I found the Kraft dressing at a local Wal-mart. It's tempting to use that as a marinade without all the other stuff just to try it out!

I scaled this to 2-3 servings. Such a quick and easy dish with minimal clean-up. I forgot the parm cheese (oops) but it wasn't missed! Will make again because of ease!

Very good quite flavorful. My husband said he liked it and he rarely offers an opinion unasked! My picky 8 year old didn't eat it but his older brothers did. Next time I might try adding some kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes.

Yumm! Very good base recipe... even better with some tweaks! I Cut the chicken into pieces and marinated it overnight in Italian dressing (I couldn't find the Red Pepper kind). Instead of plain cream cheese I used the new Philly Italian Cheese and Herb Cooking Creme which was very flavorful. I also added some chopped red onion and julienned red pepper & carrots in addition to the broccoli. I steamed the broccoli rather than boiled it and then added all the veggies to the chicken/sauce mixture in the skillet. Finally to add some heat I tossed in some red pepper flakes. Super easy & fast too which is always a plus.

I thought this recipe was just ok. I had higher hopes for it. It turned out a bit on the bland side. I might make again but I will be adding to this dish to turn it into something spectacular.

I didn't have bow tie pasta so used linguini. I had three chicken breasts were marinated in italian seasonings and two plain so just added italian dressing (I'd forgotten to heat the dressing first). The family loved it! Filling tasty and easy to make = a winner

This was a great one! I followed the recipe as best as I could. However I doubled the garlic used basil and garlic sauce instead of tomato-basil and cut the chicken into bite size pieces to saute in the dressing (it went faster). I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

Excellent and easy dish to make -- I only had 3 chicken breasts left in my bulk package but I left the rest of the recipe the same and just cut them into smaller chunks. Cooked the broccoli a little too long so definitely keep an eye on that! My chicken breasts were Italian/herb flavored so I skipped the dressing altogether and I think it achieved the desired affect.

Easy recipe but way too salty even using less than the recipe called for and reduced sodium soy sauce. We couldnt get past the salty. Making the sauce with chicken stock instead of soy sauce and saving the soy sauce as a condiment may be a better alternative. Next time I would also use more ginger and a little garlic.
