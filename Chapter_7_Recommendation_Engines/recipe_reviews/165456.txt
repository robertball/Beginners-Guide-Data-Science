This was deeeelicious! I give it four stars only because I don't approve of the microwave.  I made it on the stovetop with a few modifications.  On med-low heat, I used a single pot and started by sauteing an onion until browned.  I doubled the spices and added curry. I omitted the cinnamon and cloves because I don't care for them. After browning the onions and spices, I added the rest of the ingredients except the shrimp and I used vegetable stock instead of chicken cubes. I also added cauliflower florets and frozen peas. I cooked until the rice was almost done, then added the shrimp and cooked until opaque.

I give this five stars because not only is it delicious but easy to make!  Next time I might try doubling the spices but it was great the way it was.

This gets five stars because it is so easy to make , it's a quick dish and very rich in taste, lovely. I made it a couple of times on the stove not microwave. I marinate the shrimps (I use frozen precooked shrimps) then, boil on medium heat for 15 minutes, once the shrimps are done I remove and place the shrimps aside, then fry the rice with the marinate add water and boil until the rice is almost cooked then place the rice covered in a preheated oven at 165 degrees celcius for 15 minutes or until rice is well cooked, once done I remove all the spices and place the shrimps on top along with a few parsley leaves before serving. I use exactly the same amount for all the ingredients as directed in the original recipe, hope that helps, Bon Apetite!

This is great, so quick.  I used chicken instead of shrimp which I diced into small cubes.  I did add a little turmeric for colour and flavour.  I omitted the oil and salt.  Will most definately be making this again.

We love it!  But, I need to make it a few times more before it becomes my own dish.

I was apprehensive in the beginning - who makes a biryani using microvave !!
But I must say this turned out really well (I just added some more than salt than I am used to). Will try this again this w/e and add some vegetables. 

Thanks a lot

I made this on the stovetop instead of the microwave.  Tasted good, and I added some spinach and raisins to the basmati rice. Also used ghee instead of oil, and not so much of it. Also I think the number of servings for this recipe is wrong (2 servings?? At least 4)

Very Good! I used left over shredded chicken instead of shrimp. I heated the oil and added the spices and chicken with a little water in a frying pan. I simmered the rice in chicken bouillon broth then added the rice to the chicken and spices.  I didn't have any yogurt so I used sour cream.  The sour cream really mellows out all those spices.  I didn't use cardamom seeds because I didn't have any.  I didn't have any garlic ginger paste so I used 1/8 tsp. ground ginger and 1 tsp. of garlic powder.  Cut black pepper to 1/2 tsp. I also added about a cup of frozen mixed veggies.  I know I changed a lot of things, but the basic recipe remained.  It was spicy and very good.

Pretty good base recipe. I modified mine with more 'masala' and parboiled the rice before assembling it using the traditional layering method. I will try it as is next time though.
