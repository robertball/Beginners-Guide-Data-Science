This IS a great recipe! I read some of the other reviews, and the trick to getting the bars out of the pan without them turning into a gooey mess is to LET THEM COOL for at LEAST an hour! The cranberry mixture needs to "jell". My husband and kids REALLY loved these...even my picky four year old~!

Some important tips for this recipe: 1) use the real deal rolled oats, not the instant kind, 2) I used frozen cranberries and dropped the water down to 1/2 cup . . . you absolutely must cook the cranberries down until it's thick in the pan, keep mushing the berries as it cooks down, 3) you're better off making the cranberry part either the day before or wayyyy earlier than when you mix the cake part b/c it's better if the cranberry jam is fully cool, 4) don't even think about cutting these bars for at least 2-3 hrs after coming out of the oven . . . waiting will ensure lovely cut bars.

I gave this a 4 and not a 5 because I only liked these the day I made them. The next day they had gotten soft (of course b/c of the amount of butter and the cranberry spread), which isn't bad, just a preference thing. And heck, throw some ice cream on top and I'll be saying texture smexture ;-). I will make these again, but will reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.

Very good and easy too.  I didn't have any whole cranberries on hand, so instead of making the craberry filling I actually used canned whole cranberry sauce.  It worked just fine.  This is a great one to add to your baking gifts for the holidays.

FANTASTIC!!!!! A nice change from the usual chocolate & nut bars.  My husband loved these, so will make again.  I may try next time with a little orange zest or a touch more cinnamon.  The filling is so easy, I may try doing some kind of a cranberry pie/tart with it also.

a snap to prepare and oh, so good.  I love the sweet with the tang of the berry.  Used pom juice in place of water.  Could not taste the spices in the crust, so added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the cran mixture after thickening and still can't taste it but perhaps by tomorrow it will season.  The cooking time was spot on in my oven.  I couldn't let them cool completely because I was too impatient to try.  They were still warm but did not have any problems with crumbling or falling apart. *I also took care in not letting the cranberry sauce touch the sides of the pan during preparation.  This prevented the sugar from crystallizing as it baked and sticking to the pan and becoming hard. They cut perfectly into little squares.  They are sweet so they can be cut into small squares.  I only had a white mix and used that and cannot taste any cake mix flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe with alot of versatility.  I would like to add a bit of orange zest to the next batch.

Very easy and a great way to use up that leftover Thanksgiving cranberry sauce that nobody touched!  I ad libbed a little (it is in no way a reflection on the original recipe, it's just what I do...).  I added about a cup of ground pecans to the dough.  On top of the cranberry layer I added a handful of white chocolate chips (would have liked to add a few more but someone had broken into the bag and a handful was all that was left!), and I also added about a cup of shredded coconut before adding the top layer of dough.  Delicious and festive cookies that I am looking forward to serving at our Christmas party tomorrow night!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is baking in the oven as I write this.  You need to drop the topping by small spoonfuls onto the cranberry filling.  Then press lightly with your hands before putting in the oven.

I zested 1 orange and used its juice and water to make the 3/4 c for the cranberry sauce, 10 min cooking is fine. After cooking just place pan in sink filled with 3" cold water- it will cool very quickly that way and thicken. To the cake mixture, decreased butter to 2/3 c, 2 eggs, and used quick oats(didn't have rolled), only 1/2 c br sugar, 2 t. cinnamon, no ginger. Then use the butter wrapper to press down the dough mixture into the pan (it won't stick) and use wrapper again to press the remaining dough into flat pieces to place over the cranberry mixture. 35 min was perfect in my oven. Cool completely and it will cut beautifully. Great fall dessert.

I cooked the cranberries in orange juice and cut back on the sugar a bit. I also cut back on the butter and added some applesauce and allspice.  These are yummy, and the kids loved them. I thought the dough would be a little less sticky, and that these would be more cookie-like, but they were more of a brownie, cake-like bar. I will make this again, but I think I will use more oats.

I have made this recipe a few times now, and done two different things with it. First off...this must be an older recipe, given the size of cake mix it calls for. People need to be aware that this changes the outcome. Maybe not  too badly, but it does. The first time I made them, I got a second box of cake mix, and weighed it out on my kitchen scale, adding enough from the second box, to equal the weight of what the recipe calls for. I also used cranberries that were fresh, and not frozen. They came out absolutely perfect!!  The next time, I used it as called for, just using one cake mix. I could tell from the get go, that there wasn't enough crust. Also, the second time, I used cranberries that I had frozen. They were a lot wetter, than doing them fresh, and letting them cool. Definitely need to let them cool, as the recipe states. So...the first round was better, and gets my 5 star vote. Nobodys fault, that the second round wasn't as good..just that the cake mixes are smaller now. The third time, I used blueberry filling. And that, I can't rate, because they are still cooling as I type this . So..my last comment is, please when you all use cake mix based recipes, pay attention to the weights on the boxes. They vary by brand, and will alter your finished products

These bars where such a hit that I froze several bags of cranberries to make them throughout the year!  The first time I made them I used Quick Oats.  While they tasted great they didn't hold together well.  Once I used the right Oats it was off to the Kitchen Hall of Fame!!!

I came down to Naples with a package of fresh cranberries in my suitcase, not wanting them to go to waste while I was gone.  (I do that a lot) I chose this recipe because I thought it perfect for keeping my mitts out of it, because I don’t like cranberries and I’m not particularly fond of cake mixes or even ginger, for that matter.  I’m just a sucker for cake mixes whenever they go on sale.  Mixing these up confirmed for me I would not be a fan, and I certainly wasn’t amused with having to “pinch off” pieces of the mixture for the topping.  What a pain in the neck.  I was sure I wasn’t going to like these  and I’d save myself a few thousand calories by not eating them.  But I was surprised - these were good.  Real good.  The fresh cranberry filling is to die for and the bar part is surprisingly good too – doesn’t have that yucky cake mix taste and I didn’t even detect the ginger at all!  I used a French Vanilla cake mix (one of the few remaining original 18.5 oz. size) because in my experience it tastes infinitely better, a lot less artificial, than a yellow cake mix. To be on the safe side I sprayed my pan with Pam and had no problems getting the bars out of the pan. However, it may have been helpful that when I spread the cranberry filling I kept it away from the edges.  I would not hesitate to make these again.   And I know Hubs would have no problem with that.

These were just okay for me. The flavors were good and the cranberry mixture smelled and tasted wonderful, but they were crumbly even after leaving them in the pan for a couple of hours. My cake mixture was very moist and gooey. There was no way I was going to be able to "press" them into the pan. Might be because I used instant oats, but not sure. Not sure the flavor was good enough to warrant another try.

I just had to review these bars again. I did it last year when I first made them and I got the recipe out again for another season of parties. I took them to a class meeting of future business owners and they went nuts! Then I took some into work with me and they went nuts for them too. My boss told me that I should market and sell them because I would make a fortune.  They are that good!

Turned out excellent.  I used 1 can of whole cranberries instead of using cranberries, water and sugar, and they turned out great!!!   Took them to work and they were a hit.  Would definitely make again!

Yummy!  I made a couple of changes to the recipe: Replaced water for cranberries with the same amount of orange juice.  (I love cranberries and orange.) Decreased the amount of ground ginger to 1/2 teaspoon.   After cooling a bit I tried one... then two... then ... well it wasn't pretty.   I had them set out for Thanksgiving as something for people to grab and munch.. and they vanished quickly.  (One person kept putting whipped cream on his.  I mention that as it might be considered a serving suggestion.)

A delicious cranberry dessert! Where the recipe called for 1 cup white sugar, I used 3/4 cup. Where the recipe called for 3/4 cup brown sugar, I used 1/2 cup. The bars are still very sweet with the reduced amounts of sugar and next time I will use slightly less sugar still. Easy to make too.

I think I just gave myself a stomachache from eating too many of these.. These came out so delicious! I can't seem to stop eating another piece. Unlike other reviewers I couldn't really taste the cake mix in them. (I used Pillsbury, maybe that helped?) But it did take me longer than I expected to press the cookie parts into the pan. Very sticky. I found it helpful for the top part to take a piece of dough, mash it flat in my palms, and then place it on top the cranberry sauce. I'll definitely make this one again. Maybe just not eat half a pan by myself next time.

if this could get more stars i would give them! the cranberry/sugar/water mixture is basicly making your own cranberry sauce. that being said you could probably sustitute canned whole berry cranberry sauce if cranberries are out of season. i followed to a T made no changes whatsoever. of the whole pan i got one square. my husband ate the ENTIRE pan other than two squares he brought for a couple of the guys he works with. he ate it all in less than 24 hrs. i would say it was a hit!

I made these tonight for Thanksgiving tomorrow and of course have done plenty of taste testing. These are truly great!  They look very pretty and festive too.  First of all I only used 1/2 cup of butter and it works perfectly!  Someone said they were greasy and I hate it when bars are greasy.  Also, I was so close to cutting back on the sugar but in the end I followed the recipe and am so glad I did cause I think these would have been too tart if I would not have used the full amount of sugar.  I just flattened pieces of dough in my hands and they would lay those pieces on top of the the filling and it works very well.  It is true that you must wait until they are completely cool to cut but with any bar like this, I put them in the freezer for maybe 10-15 minutes before cutting (use a serated knife like a steak knive) and they cut fine and look nice.  I did add chopped pecans on top of the cranberry filling too.  I dusted with powdered sugar and next time will drizzle white chocolate.  I was worried it would be too sweet with chocolate but I don't think so!  Give these a try.

Canned whole berry cranberry sauce works just as well.  Add a bit of orange zest for an interesting twist.  We love these for Christmas!

These bars are just wonderful.  The sweet and tart of the cranberries combined with the flavor of brown sugar and oatmeal makes these a favorite from now on.  As mentioned, they aren't kid friendly, but that's okay because it leaves more for the adults!!!

These were totally awesome!  A very nice change from the usual deserts.  Very easy to make.  The cranberry filling was delicious.  I'm sure it would be just as delicious subsituting apple, cherry or blueberry pie filling.  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is heavenly. I made it twice over the holidays, once with the yellow cake mix and once with spice cake mix, and both were fabulous. WONDERFUL recipe, easy and yummy! A friend made this with chocolate cake mix and she said it was so good. I prefer spice or yellow, I think, but if you are a real chocolate freak, you'd probably like the chocolate mix.

I made these bars for a church cleaning day. They were delicious! I used a French vanilla cake mix instead of yellow. And since I didn't have any cranberries, I used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce in its place. It turned out perfect!

very very good, and you can't complain about them being long to prepare! they were ok with me and got rave reviews. Some said they could be great with a touch less sugar, but I must admit I hadn't got cranberries and used cherry preserve after all...

Just okay. My bars wouldn't hold together, less like a bar and more like a crumble or crisp.  I used Orange Cake Mix which made a nice flavor combination though.

I didn't have a yellow cake mix, so I substituted a Lemon cake mix.  Wow! I think they were better than the original could have been. I also added some lemon zest to the batter.  I deleted the cinnamon and lowered the brown sugar to 1/2 a cup and added 1/4 cup white sugar.
My family & friends say this one is a keeper!

These were great but I believe that the following changes are necessary: 1)Add more oats. I ended up added 1 or more cups oats to the crust and almost 2 cups more to the reserved topping, to make it manageable to place on top as well as to actually have some texture.  The amount of brown sugar is a little much.  If you like it sweet, that's fine but it is possible to reduce it at least to a 1/2 cup. Everyone enjoyed it!

This was a great and tasty way to use up my leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving dinner. Amazingly, I didn't have a yellow cake mix in the house but I did have lemon--and that turned out very well--would definitely make again! Brought it in to work and it was gobbled and lots of requests for the recipe.

I made this and brought it into work. It was an instant hit!
I did modify the recipe by adding an additional 1/2 teaspoon of Cinnamon to the bar mix and the zest of 1 small orange to the cranberry filling, once it was cooled.
I also read the other comments about waiting over night to cut, and I would recomend this as well.
I will for sure make this again!

I used the 3/4 cup butter like suggested and also did half of the crumb mixture on the bottom, and the remainder on top. Had to bake a few extra minutes but they were fabulous. I also grated an oranges worth of zest on the cranberries before i added the top layer of crumb. I Used 1 can of whole berry and 1 can of jellied. Can't be beat....yummy!!!!

This was a great recipe.  I don't even really like cranberries, but this came out fantastic!  My only modification was that I used Splenda in place of sugar when boiling the cranberries.

I made this exactly as stated. We did not like it at all. The cake base's flavor was terrible. The combination perhaps of cinnamon and ginger is what threw it off, plus it was overly sweet from the add'n of brown sugar. Further, as I think another reviewer said, you really could have used canned whole cranberry sauce for this to save time. I don't think you'd be able to have told the difference. Looks like I learned my lesson: stay with my tried 'n' true cranberry recipes.

This is so yummy. I taste as I go and the batter was wonderful.- after everything was mixed. Could not taste the  Ginger   Yes I eat some even with eggs in it but the eggs are from my hens:-)  I used my own cake recipe: 2 1/4 cup flour, 1tsp baking powder, 3/4 tsp baking soda. 1/4 tsp salt, 1 3/4 cup sugar, 1tsp vanilla . Added all the brown sugar and it was not as sweet as I thought it would be. This is on my regular dessert list.

Fantastic bars! My 8yo son loves these, and they're great for packing in lunches. Allow the filling to cool, use "real" oats (not quick-cook), drop the topping by very small spoonfuls (it will be gooey), and be sure to let the finished bars cool in the pan for at least 2-3 hours for easy removal. They also freeze great. I can't wait to try them with raspberries as well. 

Updated: I've now tried these with raspberries, and the filling didn't thicken and set quite as well. I ended up adding another 6oz of raspberries and cooking down much longer. I think it's because the raspberries are juicier than cranberries. I'm going to make them again this week and plan to use 12oz of raspberries and 12oz of blackberries instead. My son has been asking for them for weeks, but I can't find fresh cranberries right now, so I'm just going to work with the berries and likely add a touch of cornstarch too.

Delicious.  Less like a bar and tastes more like a cranberry dump cake.  Serve ice cream over the top.  The tart and the sweet combine perfectly!

Cut back on sugar as per other suggestions.  Found this recipe to be a little too much "cake-like".  Thought that it would have more of an oat texture (similar to date squares).  Flavour of cranberry sauce was good.

These things just went like hotcakes at my work holiday party!  I loved the tartness of the cranberries.  I think I might mess around and look for a heartier crust, though.  I like a little more substance than the yellow cake mix gave.  But this one's definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe. I did the cranberries the day before and it helped them to set at a gel consistency and were easier to spread evenly. Make sure you cook your berries down, really cook them down. Also, keep the layers of the crust thin. It really puffs up and can over power your berries if not careful. This was very rich for us and we found that serving it with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream made it a fabulous desert for our celebration.

The tartness balances the sweetness. My family wouldn't touch it if I told them if it was cranberries; so they tell me great cherry bars, mom.

These bars are quick and easy to bake! I patted the dough in my hand and flattened it to put on top of the cranberry layer. I had a few uncovered places but it filled in while baking. The smelled wonderful while cooking!!!!
Great fall recipe!

These were excellent.  My family couldn't say enough good things about them.  I did cool the cranberry mixture for about an hour until it was like a jelly.  I spread the dough in the pan with my hands and really packed it down.  Then I spread the cranberry mixture almost to the edge of the dough.  I topped it with some white chocolate chips then the rest of the dough.  I did as others said and cooled them for 3 hours on the counter.  They were very easy to cut and take out of the pan.  I will definitely be making these often as we love cranberries.

This is the 3rd year I have made this for Thanksgiving.  I caught my boyfriend eating this at 2am... (after he'd told me he did not like cranberries).  He had to admit it was delicious.  I always cut it too soon and it makes a mess.  I just can't wait to eat it!  Today I'll make another batch and wait for it to cool as others have suggested is all I need to do.  Thank you again for this yummy dessert!!

Very good! I used considerably less sugar, because I like mine to be tart! They took forever to cool!

So delicious!  I used 2T less butter than called for... had no problems cutting them or removing them from the pan.  I chopped up walnuts and sprinkled on top - perfect!

Excellent! Now I know why I saved that extra bag of frozen cranberries from Thanksgiving shopping. Great rich taste, nice choice as well as amount of spices, and loved the tart/sweet flavor. This would be a great treat for Thanksgiving too.  I did not change the recipe, but I did add a sprinkling of powdered sugar to the top. I think maybe next time I might also add chopped walnuts to the berries----maybe, but it's perfect just the way it is.  I heeded the mesage of others who said it was difficult to cut. I placed foil in the pan lengthwise allowing about 2" to hang over the 2 long ends of the pan. After the dessert is completely cooled, you can easily lift it out & cut into bars---I've done this with brownies & it works so well! I also cooked the cranberries the night before as another person said----the only bad point of that is it gets pretty jelled, so you need to chop it up a bit.

AMAZING!!!I made these bars at holiday time and they were a HUGE HIT.  Not only is the recipe extremely easy, it keeps for several weeks.  My teenage stepson has requested that I make this again.

Very good bars. One thing I'll add, though, is a dollop of Cool Whip on top of each serving.

I cannot say enough good things about these bars!!!!  I had slightly less than a bag of fresh cranberries left over from Thanksgiving and it worked fine.  Easy and delicious.  I had to freeze several after a few days because I kept eating them!!  Bonus that they made the house smell divine.

These were awesome. I made no changes and they came out great, served them with vanilla ice cream while a little warm. They were also so easy. If you like tangy with your sweet, these are it!

Very good and very easy!  I do think you could use canned cranberries to save time.  I also might try to use a can of canned blueberry pie filling, too.  Yum!

Absolutely awesome!  I also only had a lemon cake mix so I added a little lemon zest as well as a little cinnamon to the cranberries as they cooked.  No problem removing once they had cooled.  Will defintely make again, but may also try this with blueberries.  Thanks for sharing!!!

These are simply wonderful. I am always asked for the recipe whenever I make them for friends or work. I accidentally used too much butter the first time I made them, but I got such great feedback from everyone who tried them, that I decided to keep making them with 1 cup of butter instead of 3/4 cup. I stock up on fresh cranberries and freeze them so I can enjoy these year round. Besides, your house smells wonderful when you make them!

This was very good, the kids loved them. I did add 2T of orange juice concentrate to the berries after all the berries popped and were thickening up. I also made a powder sugar glaze to drizzle on top. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious. I really loved these cookies. I made a couple of alterations, but nothing dramatic. The cranberry filling was just perfect. Make sure you cook the filling until it is almost the texture of lumpy jam. That is when it is ready. I only had white cake mix so I used that and I also added some more oatmeal to the batter as it looked a bit too moist. I might have gone a little heavier on the spices too. I'll keep this in my recipe box. Thanks.

These are excellent!  I used a can of whole cranberries instead of making the filling (I figured if I was all ready using a cake mix, why not make it REALLY simple).  You couldn't tell the difference.  I melted some white chocolate with a little shortening and drizled each bar with a little white chocolate.  SOOO Good.

I made four batches of these over the weekend, and even the most stellar of the bunch was only a three-star result.  They're a bit hard and dense - the taste is sub-par, but the texture was not impressive.  They're not overly sweet or offensive, however, so while they didn't wow and amaze me, they're certainly worthy of a tasty cranberry treat.

Loved, loved, loved these bars. Very easy to make with on hand ingredients. ( I usually buy extra cranberries when there on sale and keep them in the freezer)I used Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus in place of the ginger and Cinnamon. I sent them in to my husbands office and got a call for the recipe about 15 minutes later! Great for the holidays, my kids even liked them! Thanks! K

I don't cook so this is an easy delicious desert that EVERYONE loves. People ask me for this recipe. Sold out at the bake sale. Like others said, completely cool cranberry mixture and after baked COMPLETELY COOL.  You can use half the sugar.  I add a bit more oats.  I don't use quick oats. Cake mix is 16.5 for me. Can't find what is called for in recipe at our local grocer. LOVE THIS RECIPES. YUM. My picky husband loves it too.

Yummy!  I used leftover cranberry sauce that I made at Thanksgiving for the filling rather than making a new batch and it turned out fine.  These are delicious and great served with vanilla ice cream.

I followed this recipe exactly as its written and it came out beautifully. The only thing i would change next time is maybe shaving 5 minutes off the bake time. Mine came out just a bit too brown, not burned at all though. They taste great and my family LOVED it! (Even my boyfriend who isnt a big cranberry fan!)

One of the best Cranberry desserts I have ever made.  I prepared it the night before and cooked the next morning.  It set up for about an hour before I cut it and it  was prefect.  There were all pros to this recipe...no cons.  I will be preparing these Cranberry Bars more often.  I always keep fresh cranberries in the freezer.
Thank you,
Wanda

I just made this yesterday for a funeral because I had a bag of cranberries in the freezer. This is really an awesome recipe!! I'm so glad I tried it! Try this one! you will be surprised! Everyone at church really liked it. It was really easy too. I did add an extra cup of oatmeal, and 2x the cinnamon. Came out perfect, and will save this recipe for when it's cranberry season!

I made these for one of our Christmas desserts and they were delcious.  I made a simple powdered sugar glaze - laced with a few drops of Orange Oil - to drizzle on the top of each bar.  Super good!

I made these when I wanted to do something different with the cranberries I had. I thought they were good but didn't realize how good until I took them to work. They were such a hit, several coworkers are asking me to make it again. Some even asked for the recipe.

These are great   HUGE TIP!!! :   One thing I have learned from professional bakers ( 5 ***** chefs) is that when it comes to BAKING, Never use off label items   only use the best ingredients down to the last grain of sugar.   There is a HUGE difference in the way things turn out and if you like to bake as much as I do you understand.

Yummy. the only reason I am giving this a 4 star is I have tweeked it just a bit, I didn't have yellow cake mix so used french vanilla and had a 16oz bag frozen cranberries & just used that, decided to add a splash of almond flavoring to the batter (maybe a teaspoon). I decided to drizzle some powdered sugar icing over it. We let it cool just a bit and had it with icecream. Hubby loved it, this is a keeper,,,oh this is the first time I am rating a recipe Thanks so much for it!!!

Have made this recipe several times and it's always excellent. It's very sweet and tart. I always use a 9x13 glass casserole dish and there isn't enough batter to do 2 layers with cranberry layer in between. So I just spread all of the batter on the bottom and put all the cranberries on top. Then I sprinkle oats or granola on top. This dish is super sticky and I find it cuts much better if you let it cool for several hours or overnight and place parchment paper on the dish before you put in the batter.

Super-good five-star hit. These were a great consistency that made perfect bars for wrapping/carrying as a mobile snack in a lunch bag. Not only that, the taste and texture of these put me in mind of the store-bought breakfast bars . . .only these are much more flavorful and more substantial- not to mention, more economical. Be patient, spread the first layer evenly and thinly across the entire bottom of pan, and be likewise patient as you spread the next two layers. This made attractive, even layers for me. I used a square pan. So good.

I liked this recipe, although I made some changes. I added 1tsp of almond extract to the cake batter. I also added about 1 cup of additional oats to the mixture for the topping. The topping was too sticky to work with.

Great recipe. We made it with with orange cake mix, and only 1/2 cup sugar added to the cranberries, and no additional sugar after (except whatever is in cake mix) - NOT the 3/4 cup plus 1 cup, as recipe states. PLENTY sweet. Will make it exactly like this again. Cannot imagine how sweet it would be if we made it as written.  Maybe will try with spice cake mix next time, will probably be delicious.

The taste on these bars is fabulous!  The first time I made this the topping was very hard and that made them difficult to cut into bars.  I made it a second time and 1. used a bigger pan (11x15) 2. used all the batter on the bottom 3. added a crumble top mixture of flour, oats, brown sugar and butter over the cranberry mixture. Cooled overnight. Turned out excellent and was WAY easier to cut into any size bars. Either way you make it the taste is amazing! These are going to a public function and I KNOW they will be a hit!

The combination of fresh cranberries, rolled oats and the dash of spices with the yellow mix makes for a fabulous autumn dessert. I baked this and many other goodies for my nearly 90 dad during my visit. These cranberry bars were his favorite.

Turned out fantastic!  I had only 1/2 a bag of cranberries, so subbed about 3/4 C of dried for the other half bag and added an additional 3/4 C water.  Worked great!

Absolutely delicious!!!  My family fell in love with them.  Although too sweet for me, I thought I might try cutting down or out the sugar in the crust to see if it will help with the over-sweetness.  Thank you so much for posting this delicious recipe!

Fabulous!   A perfect balance of sweet and tart.   I triple the cinnamon and omit ginger.   Colorful and fragrant.  Great for fall bake sales and Thanksgiving through Christmas potlucks.  Everyone wants this recipe once they taste them.

I served these as a Thanksgiving dessert this year, and everyone loved them.  I took the advice of others and used a can of whole cranberry sauce instead of making my own.  It probably could have gone a few minutes longer in the oven, but it was hard to judge if they were done or not because of the filling.

Excellent....would give it a 6th star if possible.  Made this in a 9 inch springform pan ( well sprayed) and left out ginger...hate it!..  Also gave it a fine dusting of icing sugar for a more festive look.  Cut into wedges and served with ice cream and it got big raves!  Like others, I made sure the filling was cooled well ( made it the day before).  Such a simple to  make recipe that turned out so well.  Enjoy!

Yummy Yummy Yummy. These were so good.  I liked their soft texture.  I also liked the tartness of the cranberries.  I read the other reviews and the ones who said that thier bars didn't set wasn't true for me, but I cooked my cranberries for a quite a while and I don't live in a humid area.  I will be making these for thanksgiving and christmas, oh and inbetween.  My family and I really enjoyed these.

These were really good; moist, flavorful
NO boxed cake mix taste! I used canned whole cranberries, and butter instead of margerine. Best if eaten within 2-3 days, after that the top tends to get soggy. I am going to make more with a different fruit and cake mix flavor.
Thanks for the recipe.

These were good, but I wouldnt call them bars as this is a cake recipe...doesnt resemble cake whatsoever.  I made it twice and settled on using half the batter in a bundt cake, top with cranberry sauce and add rest of batter.  Marble the top and cook.  Wait until completely cooled to cut or remove.  It is very good any way you cook it "bars" or cake.

I liked these bars, once they had cooled completely.  I had no trouble with them crumbling.  I cooked my cranberries/sugar mixture to a very thick jam consistency.  The only problem I did have with this recipe is that the bars were done at 30 mins, much earlier than the recipe states.  I will make this again when I am wanting something sweet with cranberries.

I made these last year (Christmas) with what I had in my kitchen. They were a refreshing change from all the other rich and chocolate goodies.  I made them again for Thanksgiving and received good reviews.  Nice with coffee.

this was very good, a bit too much sugar.  it may have been the cake mix though.  i will try again with a less sugar.

SO easy to make and tasted great. I've always been a little wary about cake mix recipes, but this one turned out great. Not too tart, not too sweet. A great way to use up your whole cranberries!

This is great!! Ease of preparation, smell, and I can only imagine the taste.
Looking forward to that though. 
A quick note here--the recipe calls for 3/4 C. of butter, melted. Make sure that you measure 1 1/2 sticks of butter.
1 stick of butter is 1/2 C., then from your second stick of butter, you need 1/4 of it. That equals 3/4 C. of butter, melted. 
If you actually do 3/4 C. of melted butter, your dough will not hold together.
Let you know after I have some.

My husband loved these bars, but I thought they were greasy, waaaay too gooey, and they still had that cake mix taste.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I am disappointed because the reviews were so good, I expected them to be a lot better than they turned out.  Sorry.

Fantastic! I committed the cardinal sin of baking - I made these for a group without having ever made them before. They turned out great. Just follow the recipe. I had the luxury of making them the night before so getting them out of the dish was not a problem. I also used my trusty serrated knife which works like a charm. Highly recommended

My family loved these.  I substituted Splenda white sugar and brown sugar but otherwise kept the recipe as written.  Had no problem cutting them but you have to let them cool completely.  Being winter, I just covered them and sat them on the deck for about a half hour.  I thought they were a little sweet the next day but the rest of my family could not get enough.  Thanks

This is a super easy and yummy recipe.  I did add 1 cup of toasted pecans, half sprinkled on the base layer and half sprinkled on top.  I served these to my couples Bible study group and everyone raved about how good and different they were.  They didn't have a cake mix taste at all.  I'll definitely make these again!

OH MY GOD!  This is SOOOO good.  I brought it to work before Thanksgiving for a taste test.  Everyone LOVED it.  I made a special trip with a warm batch to my work on Thanksgiving day for the guys who were stuck working. They were so excited, you would have thought I brought them gold. Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!

When I saw this recipe I thought it would be perfect to use up my leftover cranberry-orange sauce from Thanksgiving dinner. I was right. However, I was out of butter so I substituted canola oil. The crust was crispy on top and soft inside. It was a little too sweet for me. But that did not stop me from eating almost half of it. I will cut back on the sugar next time. I cut these into 1"x2" bars that were easy to eat and stretched out into more servings. They need to cool completely. I will use this anytime I have leftover cranberry sauce or experiment with over fillings.

AWESOME!  Everyone loved them and my daughter begged me to make more.  I followed the recipe exactly and had none of the problems mentioned by some other reviewers. Cranberries are hard to come by where I live, I'm thinking of using whole berry cranberry sauce next time.

Excellent! The perfect combination of tart and sweet. I have made similar bar cookies with jam, and have always thought they were just a little too sweet and that something was missing. These are perfect! The dough is quite sticky, though, which makes it hard to apply the topping. A little crisco or cooking spray on your fingers helps. They cut into bars very nicely and are so holiday pretty! Thanks! I'll be sure to add this to the recipe box.

I actually couldn't find cranberries when I wanted to try this and substituted blackberries instead.  It was really good.  I also drizzled a sugar glaze on top and it made a great presentation. Loved it, thanks.

These are great!  The ginger adds a nice dimension.  I agree that the key to cutting and getting them out of the pan is to let the cool completely.

These were tasty bars and well received by all that had some.  They add nice colour to cookie tray or cookie tins.  I did find that this was one of those recipes that was stubborn when trying to cut into squares and remove from the pan.  Alot of the sides and crust were left behind. But the overall taste was wonderful.

Like the setup of an old joke, these tasted great but looked awful.  I made them for a potluck, and had visions of tidy little squares, but they were (for me) impossible to cut into anything other than crumbly clumps.  However, they were delicious, easy to make and garnered lots of compliments.  I imagine they'd be great served warm with some vanilla ice cream.

I made them according to the recipe, but added chopped walnuts on top of half of the cranberry filling as I love nuts on everything. They were yummy both ways, but better with the nuts.

Followed this recipe exactly. Let cool several hours before cutting. They were perfect & a big hit with a crowd. Will definitely make these again.

I had frozen cranberries to use up.  I never follow recipes to the tee so added some  sweetener along with the sugar and flax along with the oatmeal; but still pretty good tho' a bit too sweet for me.  Great

These were excellent. I’m glad I read  other people’s reviews. I never realized the difference in weight of cake mixes. It was amazing. I made these exactly as written. I have since made them using strawberries. I think next time I will try blueberries.

Recipe calls for 18.25 oz package but I had a 15.25 oz box, so I mixed 6T flour and 1/2 t baking powder to make up the difference. I made a few other changes to cut some calories/fat - those are: 3/4C white sugar, 1/2C butter, and 1/2C brown sugar. Following others' recommendations, I let the cranberry mixture cool several hours and used the butter wrap to smooth/mashdown the crust.

A favorite - I make the yellow cake mix from scratch and just use dry ingredients from recipe and it makes it all yours.  I have never been disappointed by this recipe.

These were very good. The cranberry filling was a little tart, which I like, but my boyfriend doesn't, so next time I might add more sugar. I think this would also work well with raspberry or strawberry filling. The cake part is easy and delicious. I had no problems cutting the bars, but I did squish the cranberries with a potato masher while they were cooking, which made the filling thicken up much faster. I then left it to cool for about four hours before making the bars.

I’m making this as we speak. So I’m rating it only on the fact that I’ve tasted the cranberry mixture and the batter mixture. It’s a good basic recipe and leaves so many options to modify or add to it to make several different bars.  I added 1 cup of ground candied pecans to my cake mixture. I also increased the cinnamon and ginger to 1Tbl and added 1/3 more cup of oats because for some reason my batter was very moist. What I added helped. I also added 1/8 c more of brown sugar.  My cranberries jelled very nicely and were the perfect taste. Not to sweet or to tarte. I built up the sides of my batter in my pan as others said to do and added my jelled mixture so it didn’t touch the sides. I baked my batter for 10’ before adding the filling. Man was the pan heavy. I also made mini cranberry tartletts in my pampered chef bowls. And to suit my 10 year olds taste I used jelled strawberries. I’m excited to try it tonight for dessert. I think I might add some white chocolate drizzle to half the pan to see how that taste. Yum. Thanks for the easy recipe.

This recipe was average.  The best part of this bar is the cranberry filling.  I cooked it the full 15 minutes, plus, for a nice, thick filling.  The bars were soft and too sweet.  They lacked the desired crunch.

very very good. I made very few changes. 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. I also used orange juice rather than water. Another reviewer said the recipe was old due to the cake mix size and she is right. However even though newer mixes are about 2 ounces less it really doesnt make a difference. The bottom layer is going to be thin and really packed in. Drop the top layer of cake mix in tiny pieces all over. You dont want a solid layer of cake mix on top, its the cranberries peeking through that makes this so pretty. Very very good. I didnt break open the cranberries, its really yummy when you bite into a whole one.

I made this yesterday for a lunchtime visit with some friends today.  It was as good yesterday as it was today.  I grated the peel of an orange into the cranberries while they were cooking.  It was absolutely delicious and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  I have to say that I was expecting more of a crumble (like in the picture) but when assembled the batter was a very thick batter rather than a crumble.  It cut easily and did not fall apart but I did let it cool for about 45 minutes like the original recipe said.  Thank you.

Oh so yummy!!!!  This is the second time I'm making these and I don't think they will last long.  I used more crust on the top but you definitely have to make the clumps small as they don't distribute very easily over the top.

It was definitely a 5 star for flavor, but it didn't cut into bars very well (even after cooling thoroughly). So I warmed it up in the oven, and served it warm with whipped cream on Christmas. Amazing!!

I followed the recipe as written.  The bars were tasty although the cake mix flavor was forward IMHO.  I liked the tartness of the cranberries.  Spreading the mixture into the bottom of the pan was messy and tedious.  It's a bit like spreading  peanut butter with your fingers and a knife; it sticks to both.  Once your get it into the pan, it's a bit easier to poke down flat.  I did put parchment in the bottom of the pan for easier removal.  I may make this again, but probably won't.

I added some more oatmeal to the topping as it was very sticky and hard to spread over the cranberries.  Delicious square.

I used less sugar than the recipe called for, and it was very good. My suggestion is that the cranberries are chilled before placing them on the dough, otherwise, the filling will run.

I made this using frozen cranberries and cooked the sauce as directed in the recipe.  I really liked it and thought my guests would too but while they thought it was good, they (including my husband and daughter) thought it was just ok.  I like the fact that it's different from the same old same old and I plan to make it again.  Next time I'll cut the pieces smaller as it makes a fairly thick bar.  I let it cool thoroughly and didn't have any trouble getting it out of the pan, which I had sprayed very well.  It looks very nice on a plate!  Thérèse

I made it with white cake mix, and I added a little lemon extract to the cranberries.  My family, who hates cranberries in general, loved this.

This recipe was way too sweet and I can't believe I'm saying that about Christmas cookies! I cooked the dough for a full 40 minutes and it still didn't seem fully cooked. I would not make these again.

I have been making this for years.  The only thing I do differently is I add 1/4 teaspoon of cloves .  Everyone loves these and they go fast around here ! Also, they need to cool completely  before cutting. I store them covered in the fridge and they don't crumble at all.

Easy to make, and good for you too! I added more cranberries to the mix because I like a little more "oomph" in the filling, and coked it a little more to make it thicker. No other changes made.

I made this to take to Thanksgiving dinner. My mother cannot have gluten so I substituted a gluten-free cake mix. Because the cake mix was a little smaller I added a little extra oatmeal. They were amazing. My boyfriend, who is not a fan of cranberries said I should rate them "outstanding" which kinda says it all!

I made these just as the recipe called for.  They were way too sweet for me.  I was thinking the tartness of the cranberries would make the taste okay but I didn't count on the cake mixture being so sweet.  Won't make these again.  Way too sweet.

Oh my goodness!  These are fantastic!  And so easy to make.  Just be sure to let them cool adequately before removing them from the pan or they will fall apart.  I took them to quilt guild and the ladies were fighting over them.

These are awesome! We loved the crispy crunchiness of the crust and the chewy fruity center. These are now a staple in our home. We are going to try it with peach honey jam my neighbor made. I did cut down on the jam by 1/4 cup as I used Oregon Marionberry jam.

Instead of working so hard with the cake mix, use some really good cookie dough to make the crust. I used some holiday stuff which was loaded with pecans and it was amazing! It browned beautifully and there was no problem cutting it in bars and bringing it out of the pan. Also if you're not a fan of cranberries, you can use your favorite flavor of jam and add the crumbles and nuts on top. Definitely a crowd pleaser. I took it to work for a holiday party and everyone begged me for the recipe.

Will make again. Only change was I added the zest of an orange and 1 cup of Fresh OJ instead of water, reduced the sugar to 1/2 so cranberry filling wouldn't be too sweet. Refrigerate after they've cooled so they stay fresh. No problem removing from pan.

So good! Followed the original directions, and it turned out perfectly. I followed the advice of cooking the raspberry mixture until it formed a thick jam, and then let it cool over night. After baking, I let it cool for at least an hour. It had a yummy, crunchy crust and was easy to cut into pieces. Will definitely make again!

It was easy to make.  The flavors were okay.  The cranberry layer had good flavor, but the cake/crust layers were a bit to sweet for my group.  It was worth trying, but probably not something I would make a second time.

These were great!  Recipe is perfect.  I also added coconut and sprinkled it on top.  Next time I'll try adding it on top of the cranberry layer.  Also, don't use steel cut oats - too chewy.

I follow the recipe exactly, and these bars get rave reviews every time I make them.  Some reviewers have said they are crumbly, and I did have that problem when I made them in a dark pan, whereas they came out perfectly when I used a glass pan.

This recipe turned out too cakelike. First time I have dealt with real cranberries, and that was easy. I could tell just from the cake batter what the result would be. Turned out to be more oatmeal cake with cranberry filling rather than bars. Not sure that I would make again. Just okay.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!  I make several batches at Christmas time.  It's always a crowd pleaser.  The only thing I change is to zest some orange peal into the cranberries.  I tried it once with canned berries, but it wasn't as good.  But the cranberries are so easy, it's no effort to make.  When I make batches in bulk, I make the cranberry sauce the day before because my time is so limited.  Plus, I have a lot of arthritis which has made me cut my seasonal baking down to almost nothing.  But this is so tasty and so easy, even my arthritic body can handle it.

Gooey, sweet, delicious cranberry bars! I made sure the cranberry mixture was cool prior to pouring it on the oat mixture. I took them out of the oven after 34 minutes when the top was turning golden brown as I think my oven cooks fast. Then I let them cool in my 9x13 glass pan for over an hour.  Would definitely make again!

These were phenomenal! I could have eaten the entire pan myself! I made these for a dinner party and they were a HUGE hit. I followed some others' advice and doubled the cinnamon and added orange zest (about one oranges worth) and I literally cannot say enough about how delicious they were. Definitely will make this recipe again and again!

I am a HUGE cranberry fan, so finding a recipe that calls for them made me so happy.  These bars are delicious; even my hubby, who isn't a cranberry fan, likes them a lot.  Two thumbs up.

My family and I loved this recipe. I thought I had cranberries but come to find out it was tart cherries. I used them and added some cornstarch to help thicken.  Delicious!

I am not a baker, so this recipe appealed with the small list of ingredients. The first time I made this, the cake mix I had on hand was 15 oz, not the 18 oz on the ingredient list.  The batter was a bit short for covering the entire cranberry surface. But the bars were delicious even though they didn't look too good. Husband loved it. I tried it again today with a smaller pan, a 13x13 pan. The batter coverage was just right.

I hate cranberry but wanted to make this as a gift for family. I'm going to have to make a second batch because they taste so amazing. I used someone's suggestion of orange zest and juice from an orange to substitute part of the water. To make the top layer, I smashed the dough between two butter wrappers. Without doing that, it would've been impossible for me because it was so sticky. I may add more oats the next time to make it look more like the original photo.

This recipe was awesome and easy! My 7 year old son and his friend are eating it right now with ice cream and they love it. I used one can of whole cranberries. Worked great. Will definitely be making this again!

These are incredible! I had a large bag of FRESH cranberries from costco that I used half of for cranberry sauce at thanksgiving. Looked up recipes that had cranberries in it so I could use up the rest of the bag. I chose this one. My whole family loved them and I shared them with extended family and friends during the holiday season and we talked about how good they were a month later. I tried to make them again several months later but fresh cranberries weren't in season anymore!!! So sad!! Can't wait to make them again. A must bake for the holidays!

I tried this as a new addition to my Christmas baking and found it very disappointing. The flavor of the cake mix overwhelmed the filling and it just did not have a pleasant texture. I won't be making it again.

I take this to work every Christmas and they love it.  I always make the cranberry sauce the the before so it can cool and gel. I also buy the Costco size bag of cranberries so I can make two batches. I add a 1/4 cup orange juice to the cranberry mix and after it has cooked down for a while I use a potato masher to pop all berries. If the mixture is too liquidy I will spoon out a little of the juice.  I also add a 1/2 a cup of white chocolate chips to the cake mixture.

Delicious! Make sure to cook your cranberries down to a jelly consistency so they make a suitable filling. Let them cool before you cut them or the filling will ooze out. They do get a bit chewy the next day but are still delicious. These would be great warmed up with some vanilla ice cream. I will definitely make these again!

Ok, so I totally screwed it up.... I didn't read the instructions all the way through and I combined the oat mixture with the cake mixture, rather than making the crust. OMG, great mistake! After throwing it all together, i spread a thin layer of cranberry sauce, then I made another batch of the oats and spread that on top. YUMMY.

I wish it didn't use a box of cake mix, would prefer to make from scratch, but I was in a hurry to make a treat to bring to a friends and this did come out smashingly. It was a hit.

I loved these and so did my husband who doesn't like cranberries or oatmeal.  My favorite part is the cinnamon. It adds such a fun element!  I did not include the ginger because I'm not a fan.

I actually used blueberries instead and added pecans to the topping.  They were gone within an hour of me putting them out.  Everyone loved them and wanted this recipe.

Loved this!  and so did my family. My picky 10 year old said it was the best dessert she's ever had.  I put the entire oatmeal mixture on the bottom though...added the cranberry mixture and made a crumble for the top w/ oats, butter and brown sugar, nuts and threw it on top.  I reduced the amount of sugar in the cranberry mixture as we don't like these overly sweet.  It was fab!  Am getting ready to make it again right now but only have chocolate cake mix... gonna try it out anyway and see how it is.

Sweet & Tart, even though I realized after the fact I left out the brown sugar in the dough, they're still sweet enough.  The husband who typically doesn't like cranberries even liked these.  I don't care for ginger very much, so I may cut down on it next time, I think its a tad strong.

I really love this recipe and I did not give it 5 stars because what I got was more like cranberry cobbler--super delicious--just not something I can slice up to share with a group of people or as a cookie exchange. The picture I submitted shows how the left side is more like the texture I'd prefer in a bar, the right side shows gooeyness more akin to a cobbler. Perhaps cooking it longer would result in a firmer bar, or adding less liquid, but it tastes great just the way it is! (BTW I was out of ginger and only had a white cake mix--yummy!)

my whole family really enjoyed these bars! i did exactly as the original recipe said but did coat the pan in crisco beforehand and the bars were very easy to remove. i had baked them earlier in the day so they had about 3-4hrs to sit and cool before serving them. i will definitely be making these again!

These were really good and easy to make. I didn't change a thing since it was my first time making them. I didn't have any trouble getting them out of the pan and I let them cool about an hour. I agree that you need to let the cranberry sauce cool before making the bars. I knocked one star off because I think they need more spice so next time I'll double the cinnamon and maybe add some to the cranberries instead of just the crust. I will also add some chopped nuts to the topping portion of the batter for more texture. Overall, this recipe is a keeper!

I made these for my grandson who only likes chocolate. So I made them with chocolate cake mix. The only other change I made was changing the water to orange juice and a teaspoon of orange zest. I also lined my pan with parchment paper so I could easily lift it out to slice. It worked great. I did not have any of the problems with the cranberry filling being runny. Maybe people are cutting out the sugar and not cooking it until it is thick and the pectin sets up.

Delish! These were so easy to make.  I found my cranberries a little more tart than usual so I added 2 Tsp. of Port wine to the sauce.  Perfect!  These were a big hit with my fellow co-workers and my family.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved it!  I added some cornstarch to the cranberry/sugar/water part in order to thicken it up more quickly.

While it came out softer than I expected, they were still great.  I was worried it wouldn;t fit the 9x13 pan so I used an 8x8 and they were pretty thick.  The taste is amazing.

Awesome and easy! I did tweak a little as per some of the reviews by cutting the water down to 1/2 cup and adding orange zest once berries were cooked down.  Allowed to sit overnight to cool before making the bars.  Made a second batch using Saskatoon berries with lemon zest in place of cranberries.  Oh my!!!!!! I think I like these better than the cranberry version, but then again , I'm partial to Saskatoon berries. So good!

Absolutely love these!! Won 2nd place in a cranberry bake off! Freeze very well and they taste great right out of the freezer too. Very easy to make, great ahead of time. Using real cranberries was a breeze and tastes amazing.

Absolutely outstanding. I followed the recipe as written the first time, but when we ate it all and my husband wanted more, I didn't have another cake mix. I used a basic cookie dough recipe (Big Batch Kris Kringle cookies without the add-ins), and added ginger, cinnamon, and oats. It came out a little firmer, and next time I would use a little less flour or underbake it for a softer bar. I'd rather not use cake mixes anyway.

This was ok but I wouldn't call them bars exactly.  When left for the next day, these bars get softer and almost cake like.  I did like the contrast between tart cranberries and the sweetness of the dough, but this is probably something I won't try again.

I was so excited to make these after reading all the amazing reviews, and thought that Thanksgiving would be the perfect time to unveil such a delicious treat.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  They weren't bad, but they certainly didn't live up to the expectations I had from all the great reviews.  After reading some of the other reviews I decided to only use 3/4 cup white sugar to sweeten the cranberries.  They were very tart, which I like, but if you prefer sweeter I would stick with the 1 cup of sugar.  Also, I let them bake for 40 minutes, which turned out to be a little too long.  I checked them after 35 minutes, but they didn't look done.  40 minutes was too long though, so just keep an eye on them if you think 35 minutes isn't long enough.  I let them cool for about 3 hours, and had no problems cutting them into bars.  They did look very pretty, but to me they just tasted like a buttery nutri-grain bar.  I was expecting them to taste more like the raspberry bars at Starbucks (which are to die for), but they were not even close.     Everybody said they were really good...but I think they were just trying to be nice because I had almost half the pan left over.

Yum.  Definately agree with others about the nice contrast between the tang and the sweet.  Next time I think I'll add some coconut and I like the idea of some white chocolate chips!  Definately will make again.

I LOVE the cranberry flavor of these bars, but the consistency of mine were more like a cobbler.  Delicious, but not really a bar cookie.  I may have screwed up, I'll freely admit, but I think for cookies next time I'll use something other than cake mix--I'd rather use an oatmeal crumb type mix for it.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are absolutely delicious!!  I had to use canned whole cranberries because the store didn't have the fresh.  After that I followed the recipe.  It was not difficult to work with at all.  I made half the batch in a square pan and half in mini muffin tins.  They turned out wonderfully!

I wasn't wild about these bars - I took them to my bookclub meeting (my allrecipe guinea pigs!) and thought they were just all right, nothing special. The others really like them, so maybe it's just me. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars.

These were wonderful.  Everyone loved them, even those who said they didn't like cranberries.  I only used 1/2 cup of butter & they came out just fine.  The cranberry filling is also great on toast for breakfast.  Will be making these many more times. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. They were excellent! Most everyone
liked them. I especially liked the tart flavor combined with the sweet. The only thing that I did different from the recipe was to leave out the ginger (as I do not care for it). Also, it was very easy to make. Will definitely make again!

I loved these. I made them today for a get-together and everyone loved them.  I can't keep out of the leftovers - what little there was left. They'll be gone soon!  I only used 1/2 tsp of ginger as I was worried it may be too strong, but next time I'll probably put the whole tsp in.  Thanks for the recipe.

I added a little extra oatmeal and some whole berry cranberry sauce (leftover from supper) to the fresh cranberries. As long as you let the completely cool, you should have no problem cutting/removing them. Everyone loved them!

Very tasty, I use less sugar to let the tartness of the cranberry come through.  Nice and soft bar.

I thought these were too sweet, but my husband said they were "awesome" and my friends also seemed to like them.  I think I will cut the butter and brown sugar to 1/2 cup each if I make them again.

Very easy, very tasty. The crust is quite rich with all that butter but contrasts well with the cranberries.  Makes a nice size batch too!  Thanks!

Easy and yummy!  My husband was disappointed that we couldn't keep more for ourselves instead of bringing them to our hostess.  He liked a bar with a scoop of ice cream on top.  Perfect fall dessert.

I loved the tangy taste of the cranberries with the sweetness of the cookie.  They were easy to make too.

Delicious! I couldn't find any fresh cranberries, so I substituted dried and they still came out great. Go easy on the sugar, though, if you use dried.

I thought these were wonderful.  I followed the recipe and they came out great.  I added them to an assortment of cookies & fudge on my holiday cookie tray.  Everyone loved them.  I could have eaten them all myself, and I'm not usually a big cranberry fan.  Yum!!

I made these at Christmas time. I make 6-7 different kinds of cookies and make platters to give away. I was very disappionted with this recipe. I thought the flavor of the cake mix was overwhelming. They were very soft, so not a good addition to my platters. And with the first batch (I made them twice), I did not let the cranberries cool enough to allow them to thicken, so the filling too runny (I actually drained some of the juice off). The second batch I did cool the filling and it was thicker, but I found this version of the filling overwhelming. My suggestion would be to put it in a bigger pan (like 11x15) to make them thinner, and maybe crisper. Unfortunately I will not be making them again. Sorry.

Great recipe! Everyone loves it.  The trick is to make sure you bake these for the entire 40 min. And let them cool completely before cutting.  If you do they will cut easily and keep a firm texture.  I bake them for all the holidays! Thanks for the recipe

I don't know what it was but I just wasn't happy with these.  I followed all directions carefully and they turned out very mushy.  I could hardly cut them into squares.

I thought it was very good, except I might use twice the cranberries next time; I like less crust and more fruit!

I only gave this 3 stars because even though I used rolled oats and followed the recipe exactly, I ended up with bars that fell apart too easily (chilled, I was able to get them out of the pan alright but once at room temperature, they were difficult to eat) with tops that were over browned while the bottom crust was soggy. This recipe would have been a disaster if they hadn't tasted so good.  They were delicious, and even with the soggy bottoms they all got eaten.

Pretty good...The cranberries were really good and simple.  I may even use that part to make real cranberry sauce next Thanksgiving...yummm.  I tried it with dark brown sugar because that's what I had on hand.  It made them look more done than they should have, but they tasted great.  I will most likely make this again.

I had to do some creative substituting since my grocery store did not have fresh cranberries. All in all, the bars came out pretty good -- very chewy. Can definitely taste the brown sugar & cinnamon in them.
