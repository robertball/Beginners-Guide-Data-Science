This was a really good meal and I love the fact that I don't have to use the oven to make it.  The only thing I thought was missing was a little kick to it, so I added some crushed red pepper.  I also added more Ragu because I thought it was a little too thick at the end.  But overall my family and I thought it was delicious and I will be making it again.

I just felt like this dish was not too tasty.  It was ok, but not great.  There was too much sauce and not very much flavor.  I did use a different pasta sauce than the recommended Ragu sauce so maybe that would have made the difference, but I think there still would have been too much sauce.

This recipe was delicious. The above review helped add the extra flavor that was needed by adding crushed red pepper.  I recommended this recipe to some friends and I'm recommending it to all of you as well.

This recipe was awesome!! My father had it with us, and told my mom that he loved it, and wanted her to get the recipe from me so he could have it again! I did not change anything about this recipe!

I just made this dish and I have to say it was very easy! It tasted decent ( I didn't use Ragu I used Prego roasted garlic and pepper sauce - I think most sauces would work). Not the best meal I had therefore only four stars but bland enough that my two year old ate a huge bowl - and that's a success in my book. Next time will try with asparagus and broccoli.
