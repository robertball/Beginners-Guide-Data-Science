INCREDIBLE!!! SCRUMPTIOUS!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Although a little tedious (melting the chocolate completely with the hot mixture) but soooooo worth it! I have also used this recipe to make Cookies n' Cream fudge, using 2 c. white chocolate chips and crushed up oreo cookies.  I have also made Rocky Road fudge, using all milk chocolate chips, 2 c. , and adding nuts and mini marshmallows right before pouring the mixture into the pan.  SOOOOOO delicious!!! The next time I make this recipe, I am going to make it all peanut butter and I think I will add real peanut butter to give it a very flavorful peanutty taste.  I found that the peanut butter taste in the double decker fudge was overpowered by the chocolate. Peanut butter lovers in my family wanted more peanut butter!! Overall, GREAT recipe! A definite keeper! This fudge, nicely packaged would make great gifts during the holidays!

5 Stars!

EASY TO MAKE.  This was my first attempt at making fudge, and it was easier than expected.

DELICIOUS.  Everyone raved about them, even people who normally didn't like peanut butter.

INGREDIENTS AND TIMING ARE PERFECT.  I wouldn't suggest changing a thing.

LONGEVITY/FRESHNESS.  The fudge stayed fresh for quite awhile in the cookie tins they were in.  

SMALL IN SIZE. I would cut them a little larger, therefore getting a little less than 60 "servings".  The "servings" seemed small to me.

OVERALL, an excellent recipe that I will be making and sharing every Christmas, for years to come!

This fudge has a very good taste.  My main problem with this recipe is the fact that they have you pour "half" of it into the peanut butter chips and "half" of it into the chocolate chips.  It is very hard to judge what half is when you are pouring something out of a pan.  I ended up adding too much to the chocolate chips and not enough to the peanut butter.  So the bottom layer is a little too hard, and the top layer is a little too soft.  It still tastes good, it just didn't set up very well on top.  I will try and play with it until I get it to come out just right.

This is a great fudge recipe. You do have to make sure that you cook it for the 5 minutes AFTER it reaches a full boil (when BIG bubbles are popping the surface, not the little air bubbles that are generated from heavy stirring). Getting to the "full boil" stage took me about 10 minutes. People who have had softer fudge probably started their 5 minute count too early.

This is pretty good! I think maybe using real peanut butter instead of the chips might taste better. I will try it next time

This was a great fudge recipe and was so quick and easy.  I have to agree with others in that the peanut butter was the best part.  I substituted regular peanut butter for the chips and will be making this again soon with just peanut butter.

I took the advice of others and used less sugar.(2 cups).  The family loves it, I would prefer a less sugary more dark chocolate rich taste.  Next time!  The overall apperance and texture is great!

This recipe was absolutely amazing!  I chose to try it with white chocolate chips instead of peanut butter because someone in our family has a nut allergy...I followed the recipe exactly though and it came out great! I've never made any type of fudge before, but this was very easy and tasted great!  (My whole family loves chocolate and they LOVED it!!!)

This is a wonderful creamy fudge! Not gritty like some sugar fudges can be. Delicious.... The only problem is...it doesnt last LONG ENOUGH! This will be my permanent fudge recipe!

Very quick and easy to make, you don't have to wait for any "hard ball" stage.  Becareful of the boiling marshmallow mixture, it splatters!  I recommend wearing oven mits while stiring.  The vanilla is crucial (I forgot it once), the fudge won't set without it.

This is a great tasting and simple fudge recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and the fudge turned out great.  The only mistake I made was I didn't add enough mix to the peanut better chips so the peanut butter side was a little dry.

By far the easiest and most delicious fudge recipe out there. It is melt in your mouth delicious. I made this as teacher appreciation gifts at my kids schooled and I had people begging for the recipe.

I was thrilled to find a fudge recipe for peanut butter and chocolate. But I couldnt be more disappointed with the over all taste. Saying its a "very sweet" fudge is an understatement! I served this fudge at a dinner party and most people were not able to even finish their piece because of the sweetness. I doubt I will make this again : 0(

Two pounds of the fudge (one recipe) lasted less than one day in our house.  It was quite a hit with everyone who stopped by.  I would definitely make it again in a heartbeat.

Super easy and really yummy....everyone in the family loved it.  This was the first time I made fudge, so I was a little nervous, but it set up great!  The only change I will make is to pour the chocolate layer first, then peanut butter layer on top.  That way when I flip it over and cut it, the chocolate layer will be on top....it is more appetizing looking than the light tan peanut butter layer.

This fudge was too easy to make! It firmed out quite nicely, looked and tasted great! For precise and easy measuring, (and for an easy, clean transfer) I used a ladle to transfer the marshmallow mixture to the chips... My ladle holds 1/2 c. of liquid so three ladle fulls and I got the first half of the mixture.

My daughter and I followed the recipe with exact precision. We allowed it to cool 'completely' for about 2 hrs. It had the consistency of a very thick frosting. Put it in the fridge for a while in an attempt to get it to harden. Any suggestions?

This was my first time making fudge, and this was a hit at Christmas!  I took the recipe and halved it; one half for the chocolate and one half for the peanut butter.  It seemed to be easier than halving the fudge while it was hot. I used peanut butter instead of chips and it came out fine. We're big Reese's peanut butter cup fans and this was perfect and easy!  Fantastic recipe!

I think this recipe probably tastes better made with real peanut butter rather than the chips. You have to move VERY quickly, or it doesn't melt the chips well. I also substituted white chocolate chips for the peanut butter ones and it came out great. Very striking looking. Will make again.

Great recipe except I must have done something wrong!  When I poured the chocolate over the peanut butter layer, they mixed together!  Are you supposed to let the first layer cool before you pour the chocolate layer over it?  A little confusing, but it still tasted delicious.

Love it!!  The first time I made it according to directions.  Husband, kids & I all preferred the p.b. layer.  So the 2nd time I made all of it p.b. with just a THIN layer of chocolate fudge on top.  EXCELLENT!  A keeper!

The flavor was great and it was easy to make but mine came out very sticky.  You almost needed a spoon to eat it.  Not sure if I did something wrong or not.

I used regular marshmallows (measured on my digital kitchen scale)which are a lot less expensive than the creme and it came out just fine. Two-thumbs up from everyone who ate it.

This made a very, very sweet fudge which my friends could not keep their hands off!  It was a bit too sweet for me - hence the 4 stars. Instead of pouring 1/2 of the cooked mixture into each type of chip, I "measured" half of the cooked mixture by using a ladle and simply counted 1 ladle into the choc. chips and 1 ladle into the peanut butter chips and kept going until it was all gone.  I definitely liked the peanut butter fudge better than the chocolate overall.

I just made this today. It's easy and delicious! If you like a creamy fudge especially ones with peanut butter this is the recipe for you! I used milk chocolate morsels instead of semi-sweet and it was still great! This should go over great for the holidays!!

this fudge was so good! i made the bottom half butterscotch instead of peanut butter. I always screw up when i try to make fudge, but this recipe was so easy to make, I did fine!
it took a while to set in the fridge though, i was afraid it was going to be squishy. i was just impatient!

I LOVE this fudge recipe. I have been making it for over 10 years. I make it as directed most of the time, but my FAVORITE way to make it is using ALL peanut butter chips. This was suggested as a variation in the Hershey's cook book I found this recipe in. Also suggested was using all chocolate chips. Now I love chocolate, but this is the best peanut butter fudge EVER, hands down.

Tricky at the end when beginning to cool because you need to work very quickly so it pours ok but it is well worth it--excellent.  I'v never made fudge before and friends were amazed at how good it came out.  Now I look for excuses to make it.

I haven't tried making fudge in a long time but when I did it never came out solid enough.  This came out perfectly!  It took some time to boil and I even stirred it a little longer than 5 minutes.  I think I may try it with all chocolate chips and add nuts next time!

I have been making this fudge recipe for some time and it is always absolutely wonderful (except that one time when I forgot the vanilla). I've substituted the peanut butter for white chocolate and even almond butter (which was quite rich yet subtle) and it is always delicious. You just have to be patient while heating/stirring, use either a candy thermometer or the cold cup of water test (i've used both for this recipe), and work FAST when it has reached the exact temp. DELICIOUS!

We are all big peanut butter/chocolate fans in our house, and were really excited to try this after the reviews,  but we were dissapointed with this recipe.  Followed it to a "T", but not one of us liked it - it had a rather strange taste.  Won't be making it again.

Run.....do not walk to the grocery store to get all ingrediants!  Smoothest and easiest fudge I have ever made. One thing I did was measure out the hot mixture (1-1/2 cups) when seperating. 
I used 1 cup of smooth peanut butter instead of buying the chips. Worked perfect! If you have more chocolate mixture than peanut butter....just pour onto a foil lined pan and you have reg. fudge.
Keep in refridgerator.

Really good!  I took the suggestion of others and cut the sugar in half, worked wonderful.  I also decided to make each half completly seperate.  It took a little longer but I think that you get the best out of the two flavors if they mix as little as possible, plus it looks really good. Next time I will buy two jars of marshmellow cream and make two batches at a time!

This was very good and very easy to do. Like the other reviewers, I also had trouble dividing the cooked mixture in half, but it turned out well anyway. I always forgot to add the vanilla extract to the hot mixture so I started adding it to the chips while everything else cooks (1/2 to each). I also sprinkle extra peanut butter and chocolate chips on the fudge when it isn't too hot. This makes it very pretty and adds a nice crunch to the soft fudge.

I'm so proud!!!  This recipe was a little bit tougher than the PB fudge recipe I used from this site, and I did it!!  Inever had luck with fudge in the past.  I started making it all, and realized, I didn't have both PB and Chocolate chips.  I did have a bag of them mixed, so I used those.  Not as pretty as it would've been double deckered, but still tastes great and worked out nicely!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This fudge was very, very good. I loved it, and so did everyone else. The only reason I am giving it four-stars instead of five is because it is difficult to "half" the mixture to make the chocolate and peanut butter fudge. I ended up with too much of the mixture in the peanut butter (too soft) and not enough in the chocolate (a little tough). But I do recommend this one to all!

My husband loves peanut butter and chocolate. I decided to try this recipe to see if he would like it. He loved it! He said it was better than his Grandmother's fudge, so that's saying something! I am not a huge fudge fan and I liked it. My only tip would be to use a huge pan to make this in as it gets very messy.

it's not that bad but the thing is that it is really really sweet, so you might wanna add some kind of cake under or something because otherwise it's not really good.

Very sweet, but once your teeth get used to it, it's rather good.  You must work very quickly though, once you add the chips.  Mine started setting up in the bowl!  I was rather doubtful, but once it cooled and I cut it, I knew it was a keeper.  I may cut down on the sugar, though.

This fudge was amazing!  It was easy to make and it tasted wonderful.  After letting it cool, I cut it into bitesize pieces, then put it in the fridge.  It was incredible.

I was always afraid to make fudge because it seemed to be very difficult to turn out correct.  But since I have found this recipe, I have successfully made 'Good Fudge' that everyone enjoys.  This is a very good and easy recipe to complete and give out to your friends!!!

Immensely easy to make, very rich & tasty to eat! I must admit, at first I thought I didn't do it right b/c I couldnt' gauge how much of a chocolate layer I was going to have (it seemed thin from the top despite halving the cooked mixture b/t the chips) but when I cut it, it turned out great! Will try milk choc. chips next time for a change of pace.

I made a double batch for a fellowship gathering after church; when service 
was over, I made my way to the kitchen and the fudge was GONE!  A huge, huge 
hit.  Tastes a lot like buckeyes but SO MUCH EASIER!  Thank you for this 
great recipe.

This is the best fudge I have ever eaten!  It's very easy to fix and I get rave reviews every time.  I make this fudge and give it away during the holidays.  Everyone says it's the best fudge in the world and they can't wait to get their's each year.

I make this every year for friends and family and it is always a hit.  I don't bother trying to measure out half of the base, I just mix the two types of chips together and it still tastes great.  It's so easy to use different chips too to make different flavors of fudge.  I love this recipe and I plan to use it for years to come.

Great flavor, smooth texture.  1 1/2 cups mix to the chocolate and pb chips wasn't quite enough.  Will make again but add more chips and more mix.

This is great and very easy! I have not made alot of fudge or candy and the fudge made me look like a pro! I let it boil for 6 minutes and it turned out perfectly. My husband liked it alot because it was firm and creamy, not grainy or crumbly. Just the way he likes it!

Sinful!  Absolutely the best of both world's!  Chocolate and Peanut Butter!  Next time I will definitely double the recipe since I am sure this won't last long at my house!  I boiled longer than called for and it turned out perfect.  I can't wait to wrap it up and give it as gifts.  Having grown up in Hershey, PA I can honestly say their recipes are always keepers!  Excellent recipe

This is the best fudge I have had. I did 1.5 cups PB chips and .5 cups choco. Next time I think I might do PB for the entire thing. The fudge has a really nice smooth consistancy and was very simple to make.

I couldn't taste the peanut butter very well but it was decent otherwise.  I had a little trouble mixing everything at the end.

I have made this recipe for a couple years now and it is hands down our favorite fudge. I usually make this for holiday gift trays and it gets rave reviews.  It is very easy to make and always turns out creamy.

I have never made fudge before, and this made it an easy experience.  It can be a bit messy though.  Make sure you have everything prepared and ready to go so the marshamllow mixture doesn't cool off.  Great flavor and texture.

Rich and not too sweet, the two layers of this fudge compliment each other nicely. A little tricky to make at the crucial moment of pouring, the work was worth it! They were the special treat in cookie trays sent out this year.

I think this sounds like a great recipe - I plan to make 2 batches - all chocolate in first batch, peanut butter for 2nd batch to see if it works. Trying to find a way around the dividing.

I was looking for something different to make for treats this holiday season and I came across this recipe.  My husband and I made it one night to test it out and it was delicious!!  I am definitely going to be giving it out to my friends and family this Christmas.
