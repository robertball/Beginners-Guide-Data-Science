When done right in a non-stick pan this is super easy for clean up and if you follow the couscous box instructions the couscous should be the perfect consistency.  You need to first bring the water, 2 tsp butter, and the seasonin gpacket if there is one in the box to a boil.  Then you add the couscous, stir and let sit covered for at least 5 minutes.  Cheddar cheese tastes the best and if the tomatoes reduce to a thicker consistency you get a lot more flavor.  My family loved it.

I doubled the onion, garlic, tomatoes and cheese.  After tasting it, it was still bland so I added salt, pepper and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  With the modifications, this was good and my husband enjoyed it.  I will be making this again.

Only giving 4 stars since my son (8) tried to pick out all the tomatoes! Used 1-1/2c cous cous, 1-1/2c boiling water with 1 tbsp chicken base added. Sauteed 1/2 of a finely-minced onion with tomatoes, added 1/2 can of drained, sliced black olives; used 2 oz goat cheese I had leftover, and 2 slices cheddar cheese crumbled up. The tomatoes made it festive, and the black olives and goat cheese were very nice together. Will make again, next time using finely chopped zucchini & yellow squash with the tomatoes for color. Thanks for the post, it was very easy to make with only 15 mins til the main course was ready!

This was a good recipe, considering I have never attempted to make couscous before. I added some fresh basil from my garden and salt and pepper to taste. The kids gobbled it up....with 2nd and third helpings! Very easy weeknight meal.

This turned out to be very good when I combined advice of other raters.  I used chicken broth instead of water, and added butter to the couscous as directed on the box.  Now my husband and kids will eat couscous!  Thanks for the great idea.

THis was okay. I did everything as recipe stated but was just kinda bland for me. Maybe more garlic and salt...It's missing something. I'll have to experiment next time.

As written, I'd have to give this three stars b/c it was just too bland for my taste.  I made this a second time and, to bring in more flavor, added 1tsp each of cumin and cayenne pepper and added salt to taste to the boiling water before I mixed the couscous in.  This gave more flavor to my couscous.  I added double the amount of garlic and a whole onion to the tomatoes.  After I mixed the couscous with the tomato mixture I added about 3 tbsp of lemon juice.  With those changes the dish improved significantly.

I had some leftover plain couscous that was dry as a bone... looking for a way to reuse it that I could actually eat, I tried this - I used canned tomatoes since that's all I had, and added a can of mild green chilis. It was good. A huge step up from bone-dry leftovers.

The original recipe was a bit bland for me, so I jazzed it up a little more by making the couscous with chicken broth and switching the cheese to Pepper Jack - now it's a meal my husband and I both love for a simple, quick main course.

So, so bland! I added a lot of salt and pepper and some cayenne pepper to make it not taste so bland. Definitely not making it again.

My daughter called and wanted something quick to do with a box of plain couscous.  I got on here and this came up so I read it to her and since she had all of the ingredients on hand, she decided to give it a whirl.  She just called me back and was very pleased with the results.  She said that she did not need any seasonings or anything b/c the tomatoes and cheese gave it plenty of flavor.  She will make this one again! Thanks for the recipe!

Had some extra couscous so I tried this recipe with a few twists. Cooked onions and garlic; then added chopped mushrooms 2 red chili peppers in oil, and orange tomatoes. Then I tossed it with couscous and minced parsley. Added a little Louisiana hot sauce at the end as it was not spicy enough for me.

this couscous was ok. it certainly doesn't live up to its name. it was very dull in taste and apperance. to "up" the taste i would recommend putting in less couscous and more tomatoes. a little salt and pepper and EXTRA cheese spruced this dish up quite nicley. fast and easy.

This was my first couscous recipe and I really liked it. It's a wonderful foundation for a recipe. I added mushrooms, asparagus, kernel corn, veggie broth (no sodium/gluten free instead of water) and some celery too. Spices and herbs, I've added sage, rosemary, oregano, marjoram, Cajun spices, chipotle and a little bit of turmeric.

I made this for my very picky husband and he gobbled it up!  I added 2 chicken boulon cubes to the water with the couscous.  I've made couscous with only water before and it turns out very tasteless, I'll never make it without chicken broth or boulon again.  I also added Zuchini with the vegetables which added another demention of flavor and color.  This is a tasty, easy, quick recipe that's great for quick work night dinner or a side dish.

Tasty, but we added MUCH more garlic (I think it was four cloves) to the recipe for more flavor.  Adding a little bit of paprika and a chili or two adds a bit of zest as well. We like our food spicy, so adding just a bit kicked it up just enough!  Great base recipe.

Used canned tomatoes with garlic and peppers, plus a little extra diced garlic.  As with other viewers, I used canned chicken stock to cook the couscous. I used cheese that I had on hand rather than the pepper jack and it still turned out good.

I liked the fresh tomatoes in here, and also appreciated how you could use this recipe to breath new life into leftover couscous. I used chicken broth to prepare my couscous and did not find it "smothers your tongue in flavor" even with that change. Next time I'll play with herbs and spices in the oil with the tomatoes/onions/garlic. I may even try throwing a handful of chopped bacon in with the onions and nix the olive oil... but I'm decadent like that. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  I used two Roma tomatoes because they were quite large and green scallions fresh out of the garden.  Also I chopped up some fresh basil.  I always use chicken broth to cook my couscous because it adds flavor to it.  I used cheddar cheese because that is what I had on hand. I will be making this again.
