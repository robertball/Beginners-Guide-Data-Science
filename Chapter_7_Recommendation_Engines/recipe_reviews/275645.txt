I made it as per the recipe and it was a big hit. I was inspired by the other poster who added carrots - I added fingerling potatoes cut in half and they were the perfect texture.

I'm not a fan of chicken breasts, they always seem dry and chewy to me, I normally stick with the dark meat.  BUT, I followed this recipe exactly.  I will be making this again and again and again.  Meat was perfect, very tender and juicy.  The gravy was outstanding!!! Definitely deserves 5 stars!!!!

Delicious!  And I love spice, which this is not.  I'm not a gravy girl either but sure like this one.  Hubby loves it all.  Have made it twice, didn't change a thing other than to triple the recipe to have leftovers for multiple lunches.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and placed large sliced carrots in with the chicken. Served over leftover mashed potatoes. My family was thrilled! Will make this again.

Pretty good stuff for such a simple recipe! I quartered some Yukon gold potatos and used that to prop up the chicken instead of the rack. They absorbed a lot of flavor that way. A very nice weeknight meal. Thanks!

This was the first recipe I tried when I got my Intant Pot. The chicken came out tasty and tender while the gravy was perfect with the mashed potatoes. Everyone in the house loved it and it will be a regular dish in my rotation.

What a fantastic dish! I cooked carrots in large chunks under the chicken. That was the only thing I added. I didn’t change anything else. It was spot on from the ingredients to the directions. This will be a regular rotation for us. Gravy was fantastic. You have to make the gravy! I roasted Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, and yellow onions seasoned with salt, sage, and olive oil for a side. Perfect dinner! Thank you!

I doubled all ingredients. My chicken breasts were large and frozen so I doubled the cooking time to 10 minutes which was a touch too long. Thankfully the gravy was delicious and saved the slightly dry chicken. I'm sure had I used thawed chicken and followed the cooking time stated it would have been tender. Still, my DH went back for seconds and poured the gravy over his roasted potatoes and veggies too. Will be making this again soon.

Excellent, gravy was rich and flavorful.   The chicken was delicious, but a bit dry - next time, I'll probably cut the cook time just a little, otherwise, a Sunday night dinner on a weeknight!   I can see adjusting the seasonings for a variety of flavor profiles - for example, instead of paprika, I'll use sage.  How does lemon pepper sound?  Possibilities are litterallly as limited as the imagination.

I made this as instructed and it was delicious! The chicken was so juicy and the gravy was yummy. I served with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. A fast and easy dinner that I will definitely be making again!

This is the first Instant Pot recipe that I'll make a second time.  I substituted hot paprika for the regular paprika, and garlic salt for the garlic powder.  I doubled the chicken stock for the gravy, and it turned out perfectly.  The key is to pat the spices into the chicken prior to searing.  This is a keeper.

I added some carrot chunks, red pepper slices and little potatoes (halved) before setting the browned chicken on top.  I also used 1/2 cup white wine & 1/2 cup chicken broth rather than the 1 cup chicken broth.  All of the chances I made were because I had items on hand and wanted to use up.  Turned out great and only used the one pot.  Will make again.

So easy and delicious!! I added carrots and baby potatoes and they cooked perfectly. Chicken was very tender - no knife necessary! I'll be making this again.

This was really delicious. I upped almost all of the spices . The quantities suggested in recipe are not enough.  Added thick cuts of sliced carrots in the chicken stock. Great addition.  Served with roasted brussel sprouts and garlic mashed potatoes. 

I'm curious now how to do this with four chicken breasts? I'd love to replicate this with a larger quantity.  As is, it's a great dinner for two.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!! The only addition I added was 1/4 tsp cayenne and will double that next time. I doubled the ingredients too because I had 4 pieces of chicken to cook.

Do not NR more than the 10 minutes stated.  I did 12 and I found our chicken breasts to be dry and they were thicker than 1 inch.

Delish! We add Tony Chacheres to everything, but that’s the only thing we did differently. Still trying to master the Instant Pot , and this was a huge help. Super juicy chicken.  Hubby wanted thicker gravy but I’m sure that was my error.

Meh, no real taste of anything.  Gave it three starts because now I know how to make the gravy on the insta pot.
