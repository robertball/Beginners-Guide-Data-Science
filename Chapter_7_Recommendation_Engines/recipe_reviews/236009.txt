Delicious! Even better the second day (as is the way with most soups). I did, however, add a can of cream of celery soup to it to make it look creamier. Excellent recipe.

Thanks for this great recipe! It was easy and very tasty! I omitted the butter and added more vegies and ham. Had discovered frozen/cut up leeks at Trader Joe's which makes using this veg much more convenient. What a time saver that was! Yummy soup!

I increased the size greatly as I was feeding  15.  Used the program to change quantity to 12 servings then doubled that.  Had some leftover which I suspect will be even better next day.  I had no garlic powder so substituted  dried minced garlic and put an extra amount of ham, since part of th group was hard-working men.  It was a great winter night soup and praised by the whole group!  I did not use the celery (personal preference) but used a couple cans of cream of celery soup to give the flavor and make the broth more hearty.  This is a keeper!

This soup was so easy and very tasty! I did make changes due to either not having enough time or ingredients. I used leftover baked potatoes, diced. Instead of leeks and celery (which I never buy), I used cooking onions and broccoli. I don't like dill, so I left this out. I used 1/2 tsp pepper. I also added more broth - 9 cups instead of 6 (maybe because I added quite a bit of broccoli). I didn't have time to use the slow cooker, so I boiled the soup for 20-30 min. There didn't seem to be a need for the butter since the vegetables were not being fried first. My family really enjoyed this! It used up a lot of leftovers in the fridge and took very little time to prepare! My husband is lactose intolerant so it was a plus that the soup did not use any dairy.

I did not like this soup. I used white onion  instead of leek and I did not have any ham but that was not the problem. It was the spices....they do not go well in this soup.

Great with grilled cheese sandwiches. I thought I would experiment using "pickle juice" instead of dill and it seems to have just a little more flavor to it. Great soup for cold winter days/nights.

Very bland. Made it exactly according to the recipe and it tastes just "okay."  No better than that.  Needs more spice or something.  And something to thicken the soup a bit. I may try it again but I'll have t add a few things.

Yum! I made this for a soup supper at church, made a double batch, and came home with enough for one serving. Enough said!

Delicious soup!  Perfect for a chilly day.  My experience/tweaks: 

* I only used 4 large potatoes, not 5.  I felt it was plenty.
*  Every crockpot varies,  but my soup was done after 5 hours.  I cooked it for an additional 3, and felt the soup was overdone

Next time I would halve the garlc salt and dill as it was overpowering. I aaded a can of cream of potato soup to thicken, and in creased the carrots and celery. Other than the overpowering garlic and dill, it was a good and very easy soup.

I try to follow the recipe exactly for the first time. And I did up to the last few minutes,the broth was  too thin for my taste, so I added some instant potatoes to thicken it some.
Tasted good, and would make again.
