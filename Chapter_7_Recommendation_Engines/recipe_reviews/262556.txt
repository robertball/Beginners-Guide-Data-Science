First time making this recipe and used ghee instead of regular butter. Very tasty with a crisp outside and soft middle. Just slightly grainy in texture, but it is gluten-free. Would definitely make this again.

yum yum yum!! This is my first time making cookies since I was told to not eat gluten, and I didn't miss the gluten! They are crumbly but that is to be expected. Would make these again.
