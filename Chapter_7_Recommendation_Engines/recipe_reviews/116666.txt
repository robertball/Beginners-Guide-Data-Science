Yum! Yes this is more dessert than salad but it is so good. They were selling the same salad at the deli counter in my supermarket and told me they only sell it in the fall. I came home and went to my favorite cooking website "All Recipes" and you came through for me once again, Thank you Dawn and All Recipes.

Tastes just like a Caramel apple.  My kids LOVED it.  It did great, but got alittle watery over night.  Make this one the day of, not the day before.

The recipe is very good, but it calls for 2 cups of reduced-fat whipped topping, divided, but doesn't say when to add the second cup of whipped topping.  I just used 1 cup, and it was fine, but would like to know.

I knew going in to this what the ingredients together would probably create, but I was really hoping that some magic would happen between the apples and pudding to make this taste like caramel apples. For me, it didn't. I do appreciate the chance to try the recipe. ;)

I substituted the salted peanuts for chopped walnuts. I would say this is more of a dessert than salad, everyone had seconds. I loved how its not overly sweet.

I specifically sought out this recipe because I used to have one similar and couldn't find it, so the reason I gave it a four instead of five is not because I didn't like the taste.

The recipe states that you need 2 cups of whipped topping, but the directions only tell you what to do with 1 cup.  So, I put one cup in the actual pudding/apple mixture and then spread the remaining cup on top and sprinkled the nuts over the whipped topping.

Not sure what the taste difference would be if you put both cups of whipped topping in the mixture.

I love this recipe!  I also gave a 4 because it doesn't say what to do with the extra cup of topping and also because I like more peanuts so I chop up more and mix them in as well as sprinkle them on top.  I have made this about 4 times since finding it last summer and it is always a big hit with no leftovers!
