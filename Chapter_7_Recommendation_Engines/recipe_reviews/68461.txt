Great dip for football season! I used Texas Pete Buffalo Style Chicken Wing Sauce, 1/3 less-fat cream cheese (aka Neufchatel), and 1 lb. of fresh chicken that was boiled for 20 minutes (or until done) and then shredded. However, to avoid the strange "orange sherbert" color of the dip, I layered the ingredients in a 8"x11" baking dish as follows:  Mix together the softened cream cheese and ranch dressing and spread evenly in the bottom of the dish.  Then mix together the shredded chicken and wing sauce (about 2/3 bottle)and layer on top of the cream cheese mixture.  Sprinkle just a small amount of shredded cheese (I used Colby/Jack) over the top.  Bake at 350 for about 20-25 minutes or until dip is heated through and cheese is melted.  I just think people tend to shy away from the dip when it's all mixed together because of the strange color.  It's more recognizable (retains a brighter red color) when it's layered and gets gobbled up faster!

I have made a variation of this recipe for over a year now and have never been disappointed.  I suggest using more chicken and more hot sauce with this recipe. Also, if you use the chedder cheese, don't use the pre-shredded bags from the grocery store.  The cheese in those bags is coated with flour and it seems to make the dip oiler.

the biggest hit for the superbowl party!  I did use bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch because thats what you eat with buffalo chicken!  I also used 2 boneless chicken breasts instead of canned chicken (i cant stand canned meats) grilled it in a pan, cut it into bite sized pieces, put it back in the pan with the hot sauce. When I mixed the the cream cheese and bleu cheese together I added more hotsauce for more of a kick.  Baked in an 8x8 pan, 350 for 20 minutes.  Dip was gone in minutes!   will make 100 more times!!

A KEEPER! A really tasty and unique dip with the perfect amount of zip. I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, boiled and shredded. (I can't stand canned meat) I mixed all ingredients and baked it in a uncovered casserole dish for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Then I converted it to a crock pot to keep it warm. I served it with tostito scoops and celery. It was the talk of the party!!

I got this recipe about a month ago off of this site to take to a pitch-in and since then have made it 3 more times!  It's a total hit and everyone loves it!  My changes (okay, I made quite a few): use 1/2 cup Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce and 1/2 cup Red Hot, 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing and 1/2 cup Blue Cheese dressing, and put almost all of the cheese in the dip and just sprinkle some on top.  Oh yeah, and we used fresh chicken shredded in the food processor as someone suggested.  And we didn't like the crock pot method - it made the dip get dried out pretty quickly.  We just cooked it on the stove and put it into a serving dish (we did end up puting in the microwave a few times, but that was okay).  This is great because the recipe itself is very low carbs and you can use low fat cream cheese, dressing, and cheese and you don't experience all that much guilt... especially when served with celery sticks (although those Fritos scoops are fabulous!)  Thanks for this one!

This is a great and easy appetizer to make and is very well received and I have never brought any home from any party.  I read the reviews before making it and like many others I made a few modifications that I think helped make the recipe better.  I used 1 lb of skinless chicken breasts which I cleaned, sliced into strips and par boiled for 15 minutes, drained, and cooled for a few minutes.  When the chicken is cool it will be very easy to shred with your fingers.  I used a large skillet where I placed 1 Cup of Frank’s Red hot which is what is used in Buffalo, NY at the Anchor Bar to make real Buffalo chicken wings.  I also added a ½ stick of butter which is also a very common ingredient in the preparation of Buffalo chicken wings.  While the chicken and Frank’s is warming slowly, I mixed one cup of Blue cheese dressing and the cream cheese until smooth and placed it into the refrigerator until I was ready to make the dip. After the chicken and Frank’s were good and warm I placed this into a plastic container for later use as well.  This gets everything ready for the next day or for later in the day to just place it together and warm in the oven.  When I was ready for the dip I pre-heated the oven to 350 placed the blue cheese mixture into the bottom of a 7x11” baking pan and layered the chicken onto the top of the blue cheese.  I topped the whole thing with a small amount of shredded mozzarella / provolone cheese and po

This is sooo good!!!  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in the oven for 20 min instead of the slow-cooker. Next time I'll try it with blue cheese dressing instead od ranch. Either way, you can't go wrong!

I made this today for the first time and it is excellent!!  I have been trying out lots of different recipes to prepare for my annual Halloween party and this one will definately make it to the table!  Canned chicken is repulsive to me so I used rotissary chicken (from Sams), which has such wonderful flavor and compliments the entire dish.  Also...nothing beats Franks Original Hot Sauce!  Used blue cheese instead of ranch and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Combined all in the crock pot and let it sit on low for a couple of hours.  Served with tortilla chips, celery and scoops. Yum, yum, yum!!!

This is excellent.  I've made this dish many times, and everyone keeps requesting it again.  I mix 1/2 Ranch dressing and 1/2 blue cheese.  I do not use the chedder cheese. I tried it once, and did not care for the oily orange greasy appearance.  A few other "improvements" I've made are I melt 1/2 a stick of butter before warming the meat in the frying pan.  Also, I recently began substituting ground turky and found it much eaiser than cooking and shredding chicken.  It has a nicer texture in the dip, and tastes the same.

I have made this before and it is awesome. Instead of the ranch dressing I used blue cheese and didn't use cheddar cheese. It is so addicting!

I love this recipe.  I got it from a friend about a year ago, and have made it with rave reviews ever since.  The only things different I do with it, are use rotisserie chickens from the deli at the grocery store, chopped fine (the chicken's just way better that way than canned, without having to actually cook it yourself), and use Bleu Cheese dressing instead of ranch. Then we layered it instead of mixing it all together in a class dish.  Chicken/hot sauce mix on bottom, then layer of cream cheese/dressing mix, then layer of chedder cheese and bake until cheese is melty, and the center is bubbling.

Ordinarily, I lothe it when someone reviews a recipe on here based on the changes they made.  HOWEVER, that being said, I started making this last night too late to use the directions as written.  I did use the ingredients as written (down to the Franks sauce...buffalo style  :) )  only I microwaved it all in a big measuring bowl.  I have to say, it tasted great.  Next time I make it, and there will be a next time, I'll use the crock pot method, if for no other reason than to keep it warm while serving.  But it was the star of my super bowl show :)

Always a hit... but I prefer fresh chicken to canned. DO NOT USED CANNED - TRUST ME... I take 2-3 Skinless Boneless Chicken Breasts and just poach/boil them in salted water and shred them with a fork... makes this 1000x's  better!!!! Trust me! I make this all the time and everyone loves mine....

Also to cut on fat I use the 1/3 less fat cream cheese, you never know the difference... and I use SHARP cheddar... spread it in the pan and then put some crumbled bleu cheese on top and lightly mix/swirl it in....

To the reviewer that took the time to layer it to not get the 'unappetizing' orange sherbet look... good for you, but I triple batch this for parties and it's always GONE! Even with it's color...

Wow... I just realized that I hadn't rated this recipe.   I have made it more times than I can count!!  I use Frank's Red Hot, because to me, that is the ONLY hot sauce!!  I add at least a cup to make sure it's good and hot.  I also like to use rotisserie chicken instead of can.  Just the brests.  Also, I never add the cheese.  There is absolutely no need for it.  And I love cheese.  I am asked to bring this to every get together we have.  And we have a lot.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

Ever since I found this recipe, it's been requested for every party I attend!!  I follow the recipe as-is, except I just mix everything together and put it in the oven at 350 degrees until it bubbles - no skillet or slow cooker needed.

Nice easy dip for a super bowl party. I only had one pack of cream cheese and it was still good. I used two chicken breast that I cooked in my small pressure cooker for fifteen minutes, and chunky blue cheese dressing, Colby Jack shredded cheese. I did bake mine in a deep dish pie pan and topped it after it came out with a small amount of the shredded cheese. Used celery sticks and corn tortillas to dip with.

Oh my goodness----I can't believe how delicious this was (and so easy!). I made it for a neighborhood party (doubling everything) and it was gone and I had people coming up saying how good it was and asking me to make it again for the next get-together.  I used fresh chicken (that I poached and shredded) instead of the canned and mixed it with Frank's hot sauce until it had enough kick to my liking.  I did NOT use the cheddar and really don't think I needed it.  I made it up the day before, refrigerated it overnight, and then put it all in a crock-pot and reheated it for the party (keeping it on the warm setting during the party) and I didn't have any problems with separation.  I will be making this frequently! One note: I had someone say that they've tried a dip like this before, but that it was smooth (everything went into the food processor) and they preferred it this way because "you could tell what you were eating and the pieces of chicken were fabulous!"

I cut the fat and calories on this recipe by using fat free cream cheese and Hidden Valley Ranch powder instead of the actual ranch dressing.  I still got the ranch flavor in there but without the fat.  If it's too thick, add some skim milk.

I have read the reviews on this recipe and I often see that some people experience an oily residue from the cheese.  They either wipe it off or omit the cheese.  I have made this recipe many times without experiencing this and it has always been delicious.  I always use the reducuced fat shredded cheese.  Recently I made the dip using the full fat version, and boy was there a LOT of oil on top. I kept wiping it and it kept coming back.  I didn't serve it to my guests.  Use the reduced fat-tastes the same with NO oil.

**NOTE** I've posted this review before, but had to add this in, since I've made this dip many times since then. (by request!) I never add cheese, there is no need for it. Also, the key to "no greasy look" is to ONLY COOK IT ON LOW HEAT. I never have a problem! Hope that helps. *** This was great! I would've given 5 stars if I hadn't changed so much like others. I boiled 3 chicken breasts and shredded the meat instead of the canned chicken (personal preference), I used Blue Cheese dressing instead of ranch, and only put in about a handful of shredded mexican cheese. I didn't think it needed it for taste, but tried it to see if the Franks would not separate so much with the cheese. It didn't help much, so the appearance wasn't my favorite (I too believe that the "greasy" look people talk about is the Franks Red Hot separating from the other ingredients) but the taste was GREAT! I served this at a family party last weekend, a house full of half Buffalo Bills fans and the other NE Patriots...and everyone LOVED this recipe! The Buffalo natives were all asking for me to give them the recipe. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

It's in between four and five starts for my family.  I've tried this several different ways, but my most recent one went over the best.  Follow the receipe (I use left over fresh chicken and the blue cheese.  Even those that do not care for blue cheese still like it.)  BUT, the switch is this.  Take cresent rolls and cut them into thirds.  Spoon a small amount onto the "fat" end of the cresent dough and roll.  Bake these in the oven until brown.  I used biscuits and they were good also. Just use the same basic thought . .cut the biscuits into thirds and put the dip in between the layers.  Bake until brown.  The dip doesn't seem as greasy this way and it is perfect for large crowds.

This is a heart attack on a chip.  Delicious, but only for those who have a lot of self-control!! 
I used 1/2 ranch and 1/2 blue cheese dressing.

This is the best recipe...
This is how I do it and it comes out fabulous every time.
Spread 2 blocks of cream cheese in the bottom of a rectangular pan. Cook 1 bag of Tyson frozen grilled chicken strip chunks in 1 cup of Frank's hot sauce for 20 minutes on medium.  Spead this chicken/sauce mixture on top of the cream cheese. Drizzle about a half of a bottle of Ranch dressing over the top of this and then top off with  2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. Bake on 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until bubbly! Serve with frito scoops! yum! This recipe is sooooo good. Enjoy...

I halved this recipe and used blue cheese instead of ranch and it came out incredible!!  I accidentally bought fat free cream cheese and was in tears because I was running late and could not go back and get regular cream cheese.  I made it anyway and hoped for the best!  Well, when I tasted it I was VERY pleasantly surprised that it came out awesome and you could not even tell that fat free cream cheese was used.  So, if you are looking to reduce the calorie and fat in this recipe I highly recommend that you try the fat free cream cheese and you won't be disappointed. BTW, I NEVER use fat free cheese of ANY kind because it does NOT taste the same or even good in my mind but with this recipe it definitely works!  A+++ in my book :)

We have been making this for years - every party this is requested.  We use a rotissire chicken and blue cheese instead of ranch - but that'd just because we dip our regular wings in blue cheese. Everyone will love this recipie - it's great in a crock pot, too!

Freaking awesome!! Everyone loved at the super bowl party!! I accidently bought franks hot wing sauce but it still turned out great. Also I don't like canned meat either but I tried it and it tasted totally fine mixed in with the sauce, I wouldn't waste the time of cooking up chicken breasts. This took minutes to cook. It great just the way the recipe is :)

I've reviewed this recipe before and given it 5 stars. I'm still surprised by the people who say that this keeps seperating and looking bad.  If you use monterey jack or monterey jack/colby cheese, it doesn't seperate or look bad and tastes delicious.  Really worth a try!

Honestly, I ate about half the dip with a spoon before I remembered I was supposed to, you know, dip something in it. So. Good.

My family and friends obsess about this dip and it's requested for all get-togethers - however using canned chunk chicken doesn't do the recipe justice. Must use fresh chicken breasts, boiled and shredded. I use four medium to large size breasts. I use a full 16 oz. bottle of Frank's, 16 oz. Ranch dressing, 8 oz. shredded colby/monterey jack blend cheese and serve with Club crackers. Great Super Bowl food and very filling!

Amazingly yummy and versatile!! I did make some modifications. I heated the chicken with a few tablespoons of butter in a skillet and added Franks hot wing sauce. I also used 1/2cup ranch and a 1/2cup bleu cheese. I layered cream cheese mixture, chicken mixture and then shredded cheese in a casserole dish. Looks a little more presentable that may. Last time i made it i cooked it all together stove top, minus the shredded cheese. I slathered over flour tortillas, sprinkled with the shredded cheese, rolled up and refrigerated then cut into pinwheels and served cold. HUGE HIT at parties and highly portable and potluck friendly. I upped the hot sauce to 1 cup also because the tortillas temper it a little. This recipe is awesome.

I throw all the ingredients in a Crockpot (except the cheese).  I use one large frozen chicken breast.  After a couple hours I take the chicken out and shred and return it to the crockpot.  I use blue cheese instead of ranch.  I wait until it  is almost time to serve and trow in the cheese in.  I use half the amount  of red hot called for as I don't like spicy..

This is a standing request when we have a party and I have to make a dish...I use Footy's Wing sauce (may only be available at Publix in South FL or FL) and like others, I use half ranch and half blue cheese dressings, both Marie's.  I heat it on the stove and then throw it into the slow cooker to stay warm.  I put a layer of shredded cheddar on top - just for fun.  We like it best with Frito's scoops, but any chip or cracker will do.

I have made this dip with fresh chicken and with canned I like the fresh better. I use ranch dip instead of dressing and top with pepper jack cheese. We have also made it in the crock pot. Very easy and a crowd pleaser.

My cousin made this and brought it over and I have made it as well, the way he did.....IT WAS DELICIOUS! A crowd pleaser most definately!
The way we made it was:
boil some chicken tenderloins and then shred them (the canned chicken had a bit of tuna flavor when we did that one)... mix the shredded chicken with the Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce, in a seperate bowl mix the cream cheese and Hidden Valley Ranch until it is nice and creamy.....spread the cream cheese and ranch mixture on the bottom of a glass baking dish and then top with the chicken/sauce mixture and bake at about 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes....DELICIOUS! We ate the dip with Tostitos Scoops.....YUMMY!

This is fantastic! We used light cream cheese, lite ranch dressing, too. Used Cookie's brand wing sauce (our fave) instead of Frank's. Warmed it all on the stove top and bypassed the crock pot. Warmed up leftovers are good, too. Ate it with Triscuits and Chicken in a Biscuit crackers. We'll make it OFTEN!!

This is a delicious recipe, but it is soooo much better with "real" chicken. Use a rotisserie or cook your own. For the best flavor, don't use the canned stuff. Also, I've made it with several different sauces, and Frank's Red does give it the most authentic flavor. You can also bake it just until bubbly - you don't have to use a slow cooker.

I don't even know how many times I have made this recipe during football season in the last five years and it's a hit each and every time.  I've tried it both with ranch and blue cheese dressings and my family prefers ranch, so that is what I use.  Also, I ALWAYS use fresh chicken breast - about a pound give or take - in place of canned chicken (ew!).  I usually coat my chicken in olive oil and bake in a 350 degree oven for 35 min then shred.  Also, I make mine in layers and bake in an oven not the crock pot. I mix the cream cheese and ranch dressing and put it down as my first layer. Then I mix the shredded chicken, hot sauce and most of the cheese (2nd layer). Lastly, I sprinkle with additional cheese to my liking.

I've always liked the IDEA of buffalo wings, but not so much the cooking or eating of the actual wings.  This dip solves my problem.  It's delicious and rich and I can feel like I'm eating a "proper football game food".  I also cooked up some fresh chicken breast and used bleu cheese instead of the ranch.  I'll make this again for the Super Bowl and try the layering idea, because that sounds good too. And by the way, I didn't find the orange color of the dip to be strange or unappetizing at all.

I make a variation of this recipe that I personally feel is much easier.  Instead of the Ranch, I use Blue Cheese dressing and instead of cheddar cheese I use mozzarella.  I combine the chicken with about 2/3 bottle of Frank's and marinate in fridge for 30 mins.  I soften cream cheese and spread in bottom of 9x13, then add chic mixture, then blue cheese and top with 2 cups mozz. Bake at 350 for 20-30 mins or until bubbly and cheese starts to brown. OMG!

The first time I made this recipe, I threw it out because it tasted terrible. Fast forward one year to a friend's Christmas Party. She made the same dip only instead of using canned chicken, she cooked 3 whole chicken breasts, cut up& shredded herself. What a difference. She said don't use the canned chicken, it makes it taste terrible. Now we have made this several times & it is delicious. Ditch the canned chicken! I'm only giving this a 1 star because of the canned chicken, however, with "real" chicken, it deserves a 5 star!

I made this last night for the chiefs football game. I made a few changes, used chicken thighs I seasoned and cooked in a skillet and shredded them while cooking them because this is a more tender meat than breasts. Used Cheddar jack cheese it adds more flavor than just cheddar cheese. used a little more ranch dressing than a cup because it cuts down on the buffalo sauce being too spicy. Used celery, crackers, and carrot chips to serve with the dip. Overall a GREAT recipe. I was worried because the color of it makes it look HORRIBLE...but the taste was AMAZING. I have people asking me to make more for this weekend! LOL...quick and easy. Lots of fat but sooooo good!

I thought this was really good. I made it for a party. My husband wanted to eat it all before we went to the party. I found that putting it in the crock pot was a bad idea. The texture was great before the crock pot, but when I put it in the cheese & the hot sauce separated & made it yucky. I had to fix it. Next time NO CROCK POT.

LOVE this recipe.  I boil three large chicken breasts and then shred, so it is a lot more meat than the original recipe but it is really good that way. Also use the buffalo chicken hot sauce, and shred my own cheddar as suggested by others. Easiest to use an electric mixer to combine the cream cheese, ranch, and buffalo sauce.  Throw the mixture in a crock pot to heat through and it is perfect! Many, many compliments.

This Dip is a "KEEPER" for sure !!  Served this at the Superbowl Party with crackers and celery.  I halfed the recipe and substituted Blue Cheese Dressing for the Ranch.  It really does taste like Buffalo Wings! Everyone loved it.  The other bonus is that it is Atkins friendly. I had what little was leftover for lunch today!!

This was the hit of the evening.  Sent the recipe home with everybody who showed up.  Totally out of this world with carrot and celery sticks, kids were using Frito Scoops because, according to them, the scoops held more and didn't break (!), caught DH using tortilla chips and we all loved it on the variety of crackers that were offered.  This recipe makes me happy to have it in my files!  Thank you!!!

I have made this three times now and every time it has disappeared.  I have made the following modifications
	- Instead of canned chicken ,grill chicken breast then shread the chicken.  
	- Dice a half stalk of celery and mix it in to give the dip a little crunch.  
	- Like others subsitute blue cheese for ranch.  T Marzetti is excellent.
	-Subsitute Franks Red Hot with Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce.

I have made this dip twice.  Once with the canned chicken and once with the packaged rotisserie chicken.  We actually preferred the canned chicken.  I also use blue cheese instead of ranch and left out the cheddar cheese.

I made this for a Superbowl party. The guys loved it! Next time I'll add a little less ranch and a little more of Frank's pepper sauce.

2900+ reviews don't lie....this dip is delicious. I could eat it with a spoon....also good with Tostitos scoops. I'll follow Scott99's recommendation for the layering next time - the color is definitely unappetizing.  I just boiled 2 chicken breasts in plain water for 20 minutes then shredded them.

This was a good basic recipe.  The changes I made were to use Marzetti's Ultimate Bleu Cheese instead of ranch.  I also boiled my chicken breasts (about 1.2 pounds) in chicken broth and then shredded them before adding the Frank's (ALWAYS use Frank's--nothing else will give you that "buffalo" flavor).  I did not add the cheddar on top.  I did spray the dish with butter flavor Pam before cooking so it added that flavor to the end product.  There was nothing left after my last party--everyone loved it!

I actually did the 'lazy chef' version of this... and it was a HIT.    I took the meat off one rotisserie chicken from the grocery store - shredded it.  Since it was the night before, and I didn't want the chicken to dry out... I poured 1 whole bottle of Franks Wing Sauce, and 1 whole bottle of Ranch Dressing over the chicken, put in a large ziplock storage bag, and refrigerated overnight.      In the morning, I took 2, 8 oz packs of cream cheese, and the chicken mixture - plopped all in the crockpot on low for several hours, stirring occaisonally.      I did not use the shredded cheese to top with.    Served with crackers and celery sticks.

I made this for a BBQ and it was the first appetizer gone!  I layered this dip.  First layer was the melted cream cheese and blue cheese dressing, then the chicken w/ texas pete's hot sauce and then topped with cheese.  I baked in an 8x8 dish at 350 for 23 minutes.  Came out perfect.  Not greasy and ohhhh soooo delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was very disappointed in this recipe after reading the fantastic reviews.  It was very watery.   I used regular cooked chicken breasts like others and I followed this recipe to a tee.  I think the amount of how sauce overpowers the taste in the whole thing.  If you like only the taste of the hot sauce then this is the recipe for you.  Forget about how the chicken was prepared you won't even taste it.

I did this in a really quick and easy fashion.  As I was planning to "crock pot" it, I put all ingredients in a saucepan, warmed to melt the cheeses and popped into the frig.

My adjustments - per others'recommendations, i used 1/2 c ranch and 1/2 c blue cheese dressing.  Also used rotisserie chicken.  *my touches* - added a half stick of butter to the wing sauce.  Also, used the *whole* chicken, rather than just the breasts.

At my work potluck, a gorgeous coworker (male) was WIPING the crockpot clean, first with a chicken wing someone else had brought, then with his fingers!!  He could not stop!

I found this recipe on this site two years ago and have made it many, many times. I always use cooked, seasoned chicken breasts and I add chopped onion and celery to give it some texture. I use bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch and it cuts down on the salty taste. It always goes over big!

UPDATE: This is my "go to" recipe when I need an appetizer recipe. I now use only Colby-Jack cheese and it does cut down on the greasy look. Everyone loves it with the blue cheese dressing instead of the ranch. And I always use cooked, chopped chicken breasts seasoned with garlic, lemon pepper and paprika browned together with the celery and onions in olive oil.

This dip is the best! It's now at every family funtion, someone is always assigned to make it. Try it with Frito's Scoops, it really is extra delish with those! It really does taste just like a chicken wing!

I've been making something very similar to this for years now. Most people seem to love it.  I recommend using a little garlic powder and some black pepper, as well.  Also,  i recommend using sharp cheddar; as opposed to mild, etc. You can also cook this right on the stove, if you want.

This is a good recipe-but 'Buffalo Chicken' by definition would use Blue Cheese dressing. I've been making a very similar recipe for a several years now-and I eventually figured out that if I add either lowfat sour cream or fatfree greek yogurt-it makes for a much more 'dippable' texture.

I halved this recipe and used chopped cooked chicken breast instead of canned (didn't have any canned chicken).  I used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and 2% milk cheddar cheese to help lighten the cholesterol.  Put the ingredients in my little 1.5q crock pot and let it heat up for half an hour or so.  GREAT snack with Frito's scoops and tortilla chips (we also had it with celery sticks). This will be on the game day menu again!

I left out the cheddar cheese as most reviews said it was not needed.  This is rich enough so keeping out the cheddar didn't seem like a bad idea.  The thought of canned chicken turns my stomach so I bought a package of chick. breast (3 is enough), seasoned with garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper, threw them on my foreman grill, and then into the chopper. I used celery sticks and also frito scoops which was perfect.  I was looking for a dip to make for a gathering and because of the reviews I thought I should try this.  It went over very well..I was even asked for the recipe.

Awesome! I cooked chicken breasts ahead of time and threw everything in a crockpot on a low setting.  I also used half ranch and half blue cheese dressing as was recommended by others.  To eliminate the lumps from the cream cheese, I first put cream cheese, ranch and blue cheese dressings in the crock pot, heated them slightly, then added the chicken, hot sauce and cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Looked greasy and unappetizing.  The taste is okay, but the texture is all off.  Husband agreed.  Kids wouldn't even look at it ... removing this one from my recipe box.

I don't know what all the fuss was about this.  All 11 of us thought it was bland and not appealing at all. With chicken at $3 a can it was costly. I even added more hot sauce and it still did nothing for us.  We tried it on celery, tostitos and crackers. Was best on celery. Sorry folks, just not a "winner" here.

Made this for superbowl sunday.  A big hit.  We used Archie Moore's buffalo wing sauce (our absolute fav) and fat free cream cheese.  It was wonderful.  It will be a required addition to our appetizers.

Good start for a buffalo chicken dip, especially if you're one to tweak  recipes to your own tastes. The first time I made it with out any changes my hubby and I couldn't help but feel like something was missing. I gave some to my daughter and cooled it down with sour cream to make sure it wasn't too spicy, and low and behold that's the tangy zip we were looking for! Next time I make it I will add a 1/2 cup of sour cream for a little extra flavour.

This dip is delicious.  I reduced the quantity of hot sauce by half and it still had nice zip.  I also bought a rotisserie chicken instead of canned.

Very good.  I use fresh chicken breast instead of canned and used a little less hot sauce because I'm a wimp.  Usually I'll use half ranch dressing and half bleu cheese dressing.

I made this dip a couple of times now. First I followed the recipe as written, canned chicken and all.  It was good with a lot of flavor so if you are a beginnger then this is an easy tasty recipe. The second time I boiled a couple of boneless skinless chicken breasts, seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic in chicken stock.  It took more time but it made a difference in the overall taste. Gave it more of boost and the chicken stood out more.  If I have time I will use the chicken breasts vs the canned meat..Thanks for the recipe!

As written, this is a four star recipe.  It's very good and all of it will get eaten. However, if you want a five star recipe, use 2 fresh boneless skinless chicken breast instead of the canned.  It makes a big difference.  My favorite method of cooking the chicken for this dip is to poach it in chicken broth, then shred with two forks.  Also, keep in mind if you are using the slow cooker to make this, the longer it cooks, the hotter it gets.  The amount of hot sauce called for is great for the crock pot method.  If you are baking this in the oven (I've done it both ways)  I always add more hot sauce for extra kick.  Our favorite dippers are toasted baguette slices or bagel chips.

oh my gosh my whole family is licking the crock pot! i've never had this but kept seeing links to the recipe. with super bowl weekend coming up i thought i'd give this a test run tonight and they are screaming i have to make it again before next weekend! i did use 2 large boiled chicken breasts instead of canned chicken, 1/2 blue cheese dressing and 1/2 ranch. i served with fritos scoops and celery sticks. my daughter baked a pizza crust and spread it on that for instant buffalo chicken pizza! oh and also my husband is on the atkins diet and loved this with his celery sticks. thanks for an easy and great recipe!

SO YUMMY!! Instead of canned chicken, I shredded a rotisserie chicken. Seasoned with pepper and a pinch of salt. So much tastier. I also used Bleu Cheese and Ranch together. Turned my crock pot on 'HOT'. Once hot, placed chicken and cream cheese in. Added Bleu and ranch and Frank's (1/4 cup at a time). Added 1 cup of cheese. Let cook until bubbly. Turn to low/warm. Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese on top. Hope this helps.

I have been making this recipe for the past few years and it is always a hit. I use Franks Red Hot because I love the way it has heat and also a lot of flavor. This is great for low carb eaters too if you just use celery and omit the crackers. Just a tip, have the ingredients on hand and you have a quick and easy snack for unexpected guests. You can put the mixture in the microwave and it is ready in just a few minutes. Just cook on high for two minutes, take it out and stir, and then cook for one or two more minutes and it is ready to eat! Goes great with tortilla chips and corn chips also.

This was really yummy and does taste like chicken wings!  After reading a few reviews, I opted to use a store-bought rotisserie chicken instead of canned chicken.  All else followed exactly.  Delicious!

This was sensational!  I used Ken's Buffalo Chicken Marinade instead of the Franks, and it was gone from the crockpot as soon as I put more in!

Perfect for football season! I made this for the Packer kick-off game and guests raved. I highly recommend shredding a rotisserie chicken rather than using canned. Substituted Neufchatel cheese for a low(er) fat option and I probably doubled the hot sauce just because I love spicy wings. Also added green chilies which I also add to artichoke dip to give it a little kick. Served with celery and tortilla chips. Not sure why you couldn't make this all in the slow cooker, but made as is and it worked great.

This was OK - if you use the canned chicken I did not like the flavour.  This is a recipe that you would use for leftover chicken  - or get an already roasted one from the store

Love this recipe - it's addicting! Some changes I make: reduced fat cream cheese and ranch. I use less than 1 cup dressing, and usually don't add the cheddar cheese, it's still good without it. Sometimes use 3 cans chicken. Dump all in crockpot versus cooking in pan first. So good with celery, carrots and Baked Tostitos! YUM!

I love making this for parties and get-togethers.  There is one big change that I always make - substitute blue cheese dressing for the ranch dressing.  Makes a HUGE difference.  I just had to make it with ranch because the blue cheese dressing was sold out (because of Super Bowl Sunday!) at my grocery store - it just wasn't the same.  This dish is always a crowd-pleaser!

this is the best dip ever!  Everyone was raving about it and there was none left over at our New Years party.  The only changes I made was that I used 1/2 the chicken and topped it with blue cheese crumbles and minced celery.

I would give the recipe as written only 4 stars. I made the following changes. In a bowl, I combined 1 cup of Frank's Red Hot Sauce, 1 cup of Marie's Blue Cheese Dressing, and the 2 pkgs. of cream cheese. Don't worry about the cream cheese being lumpy, we'll take care of that in a minute. Canned chicken is nasty, so I cut up 3 lbs (we like extra chicken, it makes a chunkier dip) of raw boneless chicken breast into small pieces and sauteed in a skillet until done, then drain any juices. Add the hot cooked chicken to the sauce mix. This will melt the cream cheese lumps and make it nice and smooth. I also find that using all cheddar cheese makes the dip oily, so I use 16 oz. of shredded colby cheddar/monterey jack combo, most stores call it "mexican blend". Throw it all in the slow cooker on low until bubbly. I serve with Tostito's tortilla chips and celery sticks. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!

It was good, but too cream cheesy. Not enough buffalo wing flavor. I would make this again but with only 1 package of cream cheese and maybe try it with blue cheese.

Oh my, my, my... This was amazing! Made this for game day snacking and couldn't get over how good it was. My husband was super happy too. Like others, I used chicken breasts that I baked just prior. I also made my own ranch dressing. Other than that I followed the recipe as stated. Part of me is a little sad. Now we won't be able to live without this, there goes my favorite jeans...

I used Blue Cheese Dressing instead of Ranch and because I was short on time, I just dumped everything into the crock pot. I microwaved it for 5 minutes to soften the cream cheese and start the melting then put it on high for about 30 minutes til it was melted through. It was a big hit. i served it with wheat thins and celery sticks.

Everyone loved this.  I made a couple of changes.  First, I think using real chicken is a must. I boiled then shredded 3 boneless chicken breasts (I think the package I bought was 1.25 lb)and mixed with 1/2 c of frank's hot sauce and 1/2 c of wing sauce.  I also omitted the cheddar altogether - just not necessary.  Mixed everything together and baked at 350 for 20 mins.  Served with tostito scoops and celery sticks.

I divided the dressing 50/50 blue cheese and ranch.  Then mixed the dresssing with the cream cheese.  Made that the bottom layer.  The next layer was chicken and hot sauce.  Finished the top with chedder cheese.  Baked 350 for 20 min.  It was great!

I'm going to add to my first review.  The second time around, I mixed all ingredients together in a bowl and put the glop in an  8x8 dish and baked it.  It came out MUCH better that way.  It doesn't look as gross and isn't as oily and separated.  Try it, it tastes the same!

I gave this recipe 5 stars, but with a few minor changes.  I used 1 cup blue cheese dressing instead of ranch (preference!) and also baked 2 skinless/boneless chicken breasts and cut into small cubes.  I thought that sounded better than canned meat.  I also took the advise of another review and layered the dip.  Cream cheese mixed with blue cheese on the bottom, chicken mixed with Frank's Red Hot sauce (THE BEST!) on top of that and lastly, colby jack cheese (lightly) sprinkled on top.  I baked it in a 8x10 dish at 350 for 20 minutes and served with Tostito Gold Bite Sized chips and cut celery.  This dip was FABULOUS and was even great the next day cold!  My huband and I love wings and appetizers.  What a great combination!

This was an awesome dip.  I made it yesterday for a Mother's Day cook out.  I should have taken copies of the recipe as well.  This was the first dip to go and it only lasted about 25 min!  I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and used monteray jack cheese (a little less than called for).  I can't wait to make this again!

This is a fabulous recipe.  If you like wings, you have to try this.  I had been hesitating to try this for a long time; chicken dip just struck me as strange for some reason.  I made it for New Year's Eve and it was the first thing to disappear among many other dips and appetizers.  My mother-in-law said it was the best dip she ever had and people were very disappointed when it was gone.  I used bleu cheese dip and I baked my own chicken breasts(sprinkled with garlic pepper and seasoned salt and baked at 375 for about 40 minutes) and didn't add cheddar cheese to the dip but sprinkled about 1/2 cup on top along with some green onions.  Try this one and you'll be bringing home an empty dish.

I prepared the recipe as written except that I used 2 shredded, roasted chicken breasts and I microwaved it.  I give this recipe 5 stars... even though it was way too hot (pepper sauce) for me, it was delicious,...and it made quite a boatload.  In fact I served it in 2 pie dishes at 2 separate serving stations.  I intend to make it again as it was delicious but I will lower the heat for the masses and serve it up again for a crowd.  I served it with celery and carrot sticks along with plain corn chips and everyone enjoyed all the dippers.
I will also cut it in half for smaller gatherings next time.  Good recipe, worth experimenting with different cheeses, different degrees of heat and various dippers.  Thanks, NunPunch.

Soooo yummy. I made it the night before and put it in a casserole dish to heat up for a party. My husband was mad that he couldnt eat it all to himself beforehand! I added green onions to the top to dress it up a bit. Very good flavour.

I took this to a Superbowl party.  In the judging, it came in second to a homemade chocolate cake.  ---I can live with that!---

As with every dish, I altered this a little bit.  First, I used fresh chicken that I boiled and then shredded and soaked with the Frank's Red Hot. In another pot, I combined the ranch dressing, cream cheese, and cheddar and brought it to temperature on the stove.  I combined all of the elements in my medium sized crock pot and toted it off to the party.  I served with Celery sticks, but I saw some people using tostitos-- so this might be a good addition.

Made some changes:  only 1-8 oz. pkg. of creams cheese.  (2 packets made it too thick).  Then made with the remainder of the ingredients, but added several green onions, sliced thin and threw in with the celery.  Stirred in 1/2 the amount of cheese, mixed well and then transferred to a crockpot on the low setting.  When it became bubbly added the remainder of the cheese.  STIRRED well and then ready to eat.  Dipped with potato chips.  You can add anything you prefer for dipping.  Made for Jason Birthday Day Party and even Sarah loved it.  A HIT!!!

Used 1 lb of white chicken breast, boiled for about 20 minutes or just until cooked through, shredded and then recipe as follows.  Used 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese instead of 2 per others feedback.  You could easily use 1/3 less fat cream cheese. So many flavors, no one would know the difference.  I used Franks hot sauce but ran out.  Luckily had some texaspete hot sauce in the fridge so finished off with that. All your personal preference.  Easy hit, hard to mess up.  Celery and chicken crackers made for the best scoopers.  I wouldn't mess with the hot sauce much, as if you have guests, it would easily get too hot for some.  Perfect at this amount.

I've made this recipe several times and it's always a hit!
Instead of using canned chicken, bake your own, remove the skin, then add to the recipe.  I'll be making this for my Superbowl Party this year - GO SEAHAWKS!

I haven't made this particular recipe, but I can say that using fresh chicken breast is a MUST, I usually fry some up in a pan in a small amount of butter and then cut it up when it's JUST done (it will bake for 30 minutes, you don't want dry chicken). 
I also use buffalo wing sauce, Chef John's Buffalo Wing Sauce on this website is pretty awesome, but you could buy buffalo wing sauce too. I generally keep all the other ingredient amounts listed...some people like blue cheese, but I personally wouldn't do blue cheese dressing, crumbles instead :)
I mix it all up, and put it in a baking dish and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. 
Can't imagine buffalo chicken dip can get any better than that! 
Oh, and I like it with tortilla chips. 

4 stars since I never made the recipe that's listed...but doing it the way I just stated...gains it 6 stars!!!

Addicting assuming you like Buffalo wings. The only down side it looks gross when it cools or dries out. 

I have taken this and used this idea to create a Buffalo Chicken Dip Pizza that my family loves. 
In a dish layer Crescent dough and bake until golden. Then a layer of 8oz cream cheese. Then make the dip but half it. Add the sauce on top.

Grill, boil or saute chicken breast. Cut in thin strips and layer on top. Add cheddar cheese. Bake like you did the crust until all cheese is melted.....so good

Excellent!!! Used Franks Original hot sauce, and added a little more to taste. My crockpot was already in use, so I baked this in a pie-plate in the oven until the cheese melted. Absolutely delicious. Kids liked with crackers; hubby and I enjoyed it best with carrots and celery.
***UPDATED TO SAY***
I can't buy canned chicken, so each time I've made this recipe (three times now) I've poached a boneless chicken breast and shredded it. The last time I made this I used half ranch dressing and half blue cheese (low-fat Marie's blue cheese; that's what I had on hand) and I liked it with half blue cheese.

I have made this dip at least 5 times/year for the past 10 years, since originally being introduced to it at a bbq.  Always a crowd pleaser, regardless of the setting or the crowd.  You can always vary the ammount of hot sauce (Frank's DOES work great) depending on the audience.

I made this for a wedding reception and everyone raved. It was definitely the hit of the party. I ended up using 4 blocks of cream cheese, a 12 oz bottle of Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce, a 4 cup bag of cheddar cheese, about 2 cups of Ranch dressing (it was a whole bottle) and 4 10oz cans of chicken. Mixed it all together and dumped it into a crock pot to heat while we set up the rest of the food. PERFECT! Served with celery and scoopable tortilla chips.

This dish was delicious!  I followed another's recommendations and cooked and shredded about 1 lb of chicken and mixed this with Frank's Wing Sauce.  I mixed half blue cheese dressing,  half ranch dressing and the cream cheese and then layered the chicken mixture over this.  Sprinkled with jack/cheddar and baked in the oven at 350 for 20-25 minutes - so good!

Excellent recipe. I only put in 1/4 c hot sauce in because I have small children. They loved it. It was a little heavy on the cream cheese but I will only put in a block and a half next time. I used bagged grilled chicken and it was delish. I will use 2 bags next time. I used 1/2 shredded cheese from a bag and half "fresh" cheddar that I sliced. It melted well and it was not greasy at all.

If I could give this dip more stars I would.  I have been asked to make this so many times. I am not a fan of canned chicken so I poach a couple chicken breasts and shred them and I use Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce.  I can't imagine using any other pepper sauce as it might be too hot (especially something like Tabasco sauce).  I also like to layer the ranch and cream cheese on the bottom and then top it off with the chicken mixture.  I top it all off with the shredded cheese if I have some in the fridge otherwise no one really misses it.  We had one occasion where we had a little bit left over so the next day I made a grilled buffalo chicken dip cheese sandwich with sourdough.  It was so good.

I didn't really measure anything and used this as a base recipe. In a slow cooker, I dumped in a pack of cheddar cheese, a pack of mozzarella cheese, 3 large chicken breasts shredded, a jar of franks, 2 packs of cream cheese, and probably about a cup of ranch. It tasted great, and you really can't go wrong with these flavors together :)

I am taking this to a football gathering this afternoon and it tastes fabulous!  (yes, I had to try it before everyone else gets their paws on it)  I used a rotisserie chicken from Costco and left out the cheese per other reviews.  I just loaded all the ingredients into the crockpot this morning and left on low for 3 hours and it's ready to rock.  I can't wait to dig into this!

Love this receipe. But I like to use a rotisserie chicken or cook up some chicken breast. The canned stuff tastes like tuna to me and has a funny smell. I like this recipe best for tailgates and parties because most people don't like blue cheese like other buffalo dips call for. Personally, I like the blue cheese. I serve with carrots, celery and wheat thins. Ritz crackers work but they break easy. Great in slow cooker or baked!!

Great recipe. I prefer fresh meat, so I boil two chicken breasts for 40 min or untill tender and use that meat instead. It was a big hit and using fresh meat makes it so much better, with only little more efford.

Excellent. Used chicken breast as many others did and baked it in the oven. Was a bit afraid it had a bit too much red hot sauce, but it was very good with chips. Will make again.

This recipe was just what the doctor order for our weekend cabin snack. I used 2 large boneless chicken breasts, 1 cup blue cheese dressing, 1 cup frank's hot sauce and 1 8 oz blue cheese and that seemed to make plenty. I also used the mexican blend cheese cause that's what I had on hand. This recipe will make me a hero when the super bowl comes around. Oh yea, I also layered my dip.

Add a packet of buffalo hot wing seasoning for a great flavor. Great on tortilla chips.

This recipe is always a big hit. The guys love it but the ladies do too! I use Blue Cheese dressing instead of Ranch. I mix the chicken with hot sauce and then just layer everything together in  a casserole dish and bake until bubbly.

This weekend Superbowl 2011 will be my 2nd time making this dip! Everyone goes wild over this dip! Instead of canned chicken, I shredded up a rotisserie chicken already cooked from Costco. It adds great flavor! I also bake mine which turns out great. Franks Red Hot sauce also comes in a buffalo flavor...Makes it very tasty! Thanks so much for this recipe! Its a keeper!

This is a favorite among everyone each time I make it. I use Blue Cheese dressing, Maries is best, in place of the ranch and mozzarella cheese instead of Cheddar. Love Franks Red Hot sauce and I use at least a full cup, sometimes more!

I have been making a recipe just like this forever. I hate the taste of canned chicken so we usually use the real thing, and I usually put pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar. It's awesome.

I have been making a version of this dip for a few months now and it is always a popular request! You can substitute the cup of ranch for blue cheese or do half and half. Very good stuff!

Love this recipe!  I do change it slightly to suit my taste.  I only use one package of cream cheese to save on the fat...2 bars is just not necessary.  Sinced there isn't as much cream cheese I cut down on the Frank's...to 1/2 cup, and I add 1/2 cup of ranch and 1/2 cup of bleu cheese dressing instead of a cup of ranch.  Everybody loves it, and it's a little more mellow than some of the buffalo chicken dips I've had.  Perfect!!  For New Year's Eve I changed things up a bit and made them into Buffalo Wontons by putting a teaspoon of the mixture into wonton skins and deep frying them.  They were the hit of the party.

This is a really good Buffalo Chicken Dip!  I don't like canned chicken so I boiled and shredded 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, except for adding all the cheese at once.  (For the Ranch dressing, I used "Light" Ranch by Hidden Valley).  Next time, I think I will start it in the Crock Pot, stirring after each ingredient instead of transferring it from a skillet and dirtying another dish.   If you are making this for a group and want people to actaully enjoy it, I would strongly suggest using only 1/2 cup of Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce because it will be too hot for the average person. You can always add more but you cannot take any out once it's added. LOL  I served this with toasted French baggettes but I'm sure crackers and celery sticks would be great with it too.  Thanks Nunpunch.

I first tasted a similar dip while on vacation and I fell in love at first bite.  This recipe nails it!  Kudos.  I have made it several times for both family and friends and received many 2nd requests.

This is a great party dip, always goes fast. My version also uses blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. I also dislike canned chicken so I use store cooked rotisserie chicken that is easy to shred with a fork. I bake it at 350 for about 25-30 minutes or slightly brown and bubbles.

I have made this 4 times in the last 2 months... always a fan favorite and everyone asks for the recipe.  I don't use canned chicken as a personal preference since I work for a poultry company.  I tend to use 1 lb of chicken for every 10 oz the recipe calls for.  I simply boil thawed or fresh boneless skinless chicken breasts for a few minutes, let cool and shred.  Typically I get the ingredients ready a few days before and toss the chicken and cheese ingredients in the crockpot and refrigerate.  I add the liquid ingredients and cook on low for about 6 hours before I need.  Another option is to fully melt the dip the night before, refrigerate it overnight and it doesn't require as long of a heating time the next day.

I use 2 frozen chicken breast boiled and shredded. I mix the cream cheese with 1c ranch dressing and spread on the bottom of glass pan. Mix the chicken with hot sauce and layer that on top of cream cheese. Cover with blue cheese crumbles or cheddar cheese. Bake until bubbly. We prefer it layered than all mixed together but either way this dip is AWESOME!

Great dip.  I use a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the store.  Canned chicken smells like cat food!

I used blue cheese since I don't think ranch is appropriate with buffalo chicken. I also followed the advice of getting a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken and it was a fantastic time and money saver (deli cooked whole chicken was $3.99, same whole uncooked chicken was around $7.00).  I shredded the chicken and combined all ingredients on the stovetop until well blended and bubbling.  I transferred it into a 9X9 glass dish and baked for 30 minutes.  It was perfect!

Great dip. Goes over extremely well with everyone! Tastes just like wings. I used the small bottle of Frank's and that was enough. Don't use the canned chicked, either do crockpot, pan fried or boiled.

I have been making this dip for some time now and it always gets rave reviews!!  I use 2 fresh cooked (not canned) chicken breasts shredded and always grate my cheddar cheese by hand- I think this makes a big difference! As another reviewer suggested, I recently made this recipe in layers rather than one large mix- the bottom layer being the ranch dressing and cream cheese, next layer being the chicken and hot sauce, and finally topped with the cheddar cheese- it made for a nicer presentation but everyone gobbles this down so fast I’m not sure presentation matters!!! I serve with Tostitos scoops and celery sticks- always a big hit!

This is soooo good....so addicting.  I didn't layer it...just threw it all together and nobody seemed turned off by the color.  It was gone before I knew it.  However, I think it tastes much better with tortilla chips than with the crackers.

There are so many different recipes for the Buffalo Chicken Dip and I always make one that has blue cheese but I wanted to try this one to see how it would come out. I decided they all taste about the same. I ignored all the directions and just threw it all in a small crockpot and let it cook for an hour. Great for football season.

A friend brought this dip to my house for a football game. This recipe tastes exactly the same. I like things spicy so I add a little more Franks Red Hot when i'm making it. One thing is for sure, if your stomach is easily made "upset" this dip may not be for you. Then again, it may be worth the pain once you taste it.

This was AWESOME...the only thing I would do is make it in a 9x13 pan... we served with tortilla chips while hot (and I used celery when it was cold the next day!!)  If making it as a cold dip, I would layer as instructed, but just not melt the cheese.   Or, mix the cheese in with it.  YUM!!  Excellent recipe!

This stuff is addicting, my friends love it and I've also served a big bowl of it to my son and his friends whenever they're here for a get together. It always goes way too fast.

AWESOME!!! I took a hint from previous reviews and boiled two boneless chicken breasts, pulled the meat and warmed it in 3/4 cup of Texas Pete's Buffalo Wing Sauce.  I used blue cheese dressing, because I prefer it over ranch.  I mixed the cream cheese and blue cheese and folded it into an 8 by 11 inch baking dish, layered the chicken, then topped with mild shredded cheddar cheese.  Baked in a pre-heated oven of 350 degrees for 20 minutes, I served it with baked Tostito Scoops, (haha, to cut down on the high calories!) and celery. YUMMY!!

OMG Forget about what it looks like and EAT! If you just smell the stuff it makes you want it when you've already eaten too much! Fantastic flavor and NO BONES!  I use reg chicken that I poach and always make a double the batch.  My DH can't get enough and everyone requests that we bring it to parties! I'm considering getting a separate crock pot just for it since the only one I have always seems to be full when I need it.

I have never had one negative comment about this recipe, and 99% of the time I get RAVE reviews and NO leftovers.  After many different methods of making this, I've come to find that they key really IS the yucky canned chicken breast that I wouldn't use in anything else.  I thought I could improve it greatly with regular chicken breast shredded, but it just doesn't shred as nicely as the canned (and DRAINED... no draining = yucky goupy dip) stuff.  We also prefer blue cheese dressing to ranch.  It is equally yummy baked as it is in the crock pot.  The most recent time we served this with Fritos scoops, and people went bezerk over it.  It's also good with tortilla chips and celery sticks.

Everyone Loves this!  I boil and use fresh chicken and I use Marie's Chunky blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  I also use Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce.

This is a great recipe but I have some alterations that make it WAY BETTER! I use fresh chicken, bake it, shred it, Marinate that in Franks Red hot (with tobasco for those who like it really hot). Combine Marie's Blue cheese dressing (they make a lite one too) and a bar of cream cheese together. Then layer in a casserole dish (chicken, cream cheese/dressing, chicken). Top with shredded cheese. 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Serve with Fritos scoops and celery!!!! Men love it...great football food!!!

I've made this several times and it's always a big hit. Serve with corn chips or cubes of bread!! Yum. I always just throw everything in the crock pot and stir often until melted together. Then keep on low.

This is a delicious wing dip! I was very hesitant on trying to capture the flavour of chicken wings in a dip at first, but I made this for game night and the guys devoured it. Followed the recipe to a T, except for substituting the ranch for blue cheese salad dressing, which I think made it even better. A sure winner.

I made this for a potluck at work today, and WOW.  The raves were non-stop!  I followed the suggestion of the first review, to layer it (cream cheese and blue cheese dressing and chopped celery, shredded rotisserrie chicken and hot sauce, and then fresh grated cheddar on top - baked at 350F for 15 min., foil-covered), and I'm glad I did!  I served with tortilla chips and celery sticks. :)  This is a VERY easy recipe and perfect for potlucks!  It might cost a bit to get all the ingredients, but potlucks are worth it, in my opinion. :)  Oh, and this is great to make in advance to refrigerate overnight - and then just bake in the oven right before serving.

I've made this dip several times now and everyone loves it.  I did change a couple of things, but it is still as easy.  I cook and shred two chicken breasts so I have about two cups of cooked chicken instead of using the canned. Also, I use a glass pie dish about 10 inches and bake it for 15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.  I don't use the crockpot because it never lasts long enough anyway.  Fantastic!

Just like most people, I too, loved this dip! I was voted MVP at the Superbowl party for it and just made it again for a March Madness party. I use a rotisserie chicken, reduced fat cream cheese and light ranch dressing. The last time I made it I just "winged" it and didn't measure anything. I like to serve it out of the crockpot because I think it's best warm. I also like to sprinkle some sliced green onions over the top and serve it with celery sticks and chicken-in-a-biscuit crackers. Mmmm...so good!

I made this for Super Bowl and got the rave reviews I hoped for. Like others, I omitted the cheddar cheese, skipped the skillet part and used a roasted chicken. I topped it with diced green onion to hide the "ugly" look that many described.

I entered this dip in an appetizer contest & won 3rd prize!! My husband loves this dip. I start with a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store that I shred into bite size pieces. I follow the rest of the directions except I like to add about an extra cup of Franks hot sauce and at least 10 shots of Tabasco ( we like it HOT!!) I throw it all in a crock pot and let it simmer for 6 - 8 hours. I like to serve the dip with Tostito Scoops & Frito Scoops. Very Yummy!!!

Very good dip and easy to make. I used fresh chicken breasts that I boiled and shredded. I also modified the hot sauce for our tastes after reading other reviews. I used 1/4 cup instead of 3/4 cup. It still had a good kick init, but it wasnt over powering. Will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe for years, and many different ways. I vary mine by using the real chicken chicken breasts and after shredding them put some of the wing sauce in with the chicken first-(it absorbs better and keeps the flavor hot) I also use my food chopper and chop a couple sticks of celery very fine and add to the total mixture before baking (yes, it cooks and is not crunchy) I use half blue cheese and half ranch dressing, and last, I use very little shredded cheddar. (some in and some on top)My family is picky on the degree of "hotness", so I usually split a batch and make half less hot and the other half more. NO matter how you make this recipe, its great!!!!

I had tasted a recipe similar to this last winter and was waiting for an occasion to make it.  Like others, I cooked frozen chicken breasts and shredded them in a food processor and I used our favorite blue cheese dressing rather than ranch, and the Franks wing sauce.  I took this this afternoon to Bengals party at my neighbors' home and EVERY bite was eaten. After the game was over, I had to walk home and print out 4 copies of the recipe to share.  Great recipe, great Bengals victory.  Sorry if you're a Steelers fan, but you had it coming after what happened last Januray. HOODEY!!!

I also tried doing this as a layer dip and it worked really well because it was gone in about 15 minutes, it didn't have a chance to get cold.  I did 1/2 ranch and 1/2 bleu cheese instead of all ranch.  I also used just a bit of shredded cheddar on top to avoid the greasy look from the flour.  I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes the night before and brought it to work the next day and warmed it in the mircowave.  Just before serving I sprinkled bleu cheese crumbles, diced celery, and green onions on the top.  It looked great!  I can't wait to take it to the Super Bowl party this weekend!

yummy! I made this for a party about a month ago and everyone raved. I used bleu cheese instead of ranch. The first time I made it cooled off very quickly and it did not taste good at all. I kept having to reheat it in my friends microwave. I made it last week for a another party and this time I baked as directed, then transferred it to a crock pot. It worked out GREAT!!!! I will continue to do this when I make it in the future. I also used paper towels to carefully dab up the grease that pools at the top, after baking.

I LOVE THIS DIP!  But recently we have been on the low fat trend. So I tried this with Fat Free cream cheese, and fat free Ranch, and %2 colby and monterey jack cheese.  This is the best low fat conversion I have ever tried!!!!

SO very good!!  We are a wing loving family and this was superb!  I did use some left over baked chicken and decided to use half ranch and half blue cheese dressing. I also completely omitted the cheddar, totally not needed (in my opinion). To die for:).  I served with celery and carrot sticks as well as Tostito dip chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!  This will be one of two super bowl dip traditions. (Reuben Dip pn this site is the other.)

Fabulous!  I halved this recipe for a smaller crowd on New Years Eve and it was a huge hit.  I poached one large chicken breast and finely diced it. It was delicious served with celery and "scoop" style chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was awesome!  I will be making this again for sure.  We ate half of this before adding the cheddar cheese, and that addition made it a bit greasy.  Next time I will not be adding the shredded cheese at all.  I made this and served it in an electric fondue pot.  This was a huge hit at my party!

this is a great recipe..I made some changes though--I used boiled chicken instead of canned and I used cheddar cheese and monteray jack cheese. I only heated the cream cheese and hot sauce together until smooth, then mixed the other ingredients in.  It didn't get the greasy film on top (from the cheeses) and it was ready to eat and easier to scoop.  I only serve this with tortilla chips....

Very good recipe as is, but I tend to make it with the following changes.  Use a half cup of Ranch and a half up of Bleu Cheese dressings, and two cans of Sam’s Club chicken (I think they are 14 ounces each).  I often mix everything together, and heat in the crock pot or give it a head start in the microwave.  Most people seem to prefer tortilla chips to Chicken in a Biscuit crackers; I stopped serving celery sticks since no one seemed to eat them.

TOTALLY AWESOME!  I am appreciative of the suggestions of others!  I used a rotisserie chicken, shredded the meat, used blue cheese, and layered the chicken/frank's on the mixture of cream and blue cheese and put shredded cheddar on top.  It was TERRIFIC!!!! Not healthy but a nice splurge.  Thanks Nunpunch!  Interesting moniker, btw.

This dip is awesome! My sister made it for Labor Day and I loved it so much I decided to make it for an evening with the girls. I was shocked when she told me it was canned chicken but since I liked it so much I didn't change it up when I made it. The first time was a huge hit and I didn't tell the girls it was made with canned meat.  TImadeit Iadded jalapeños to up the spice factor and increased the hot sauce, because we like it hot. (No pun intended:-)) I also used a yogurt based blue cheese dressing instead of full fat ranch to save calories. The next time I make it I'll use low fat cream cheese and try it with rotisserie chicken to see (taste) the difference. Our local butcher has a version of this dip that we love using smoked chicken but one of the girls commented that she like my version better. ??That was a great compliment since we had dubbed the butchers version as "crack" since it was so addictive. I'm just hoping they don't show up at my front door at all hours of the night for a hit of my buffalo dip.

Used rotisserie chicken, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  I love spicy, but this was a tad too much for me.  Also tasted a little salty.  I had no problems with the oiliness that others complained of.  Will make again, but will try blue cheese dressing, and will pull back on the Frank's just a tad.

I used a Rotisserie chicken like others did. I also used half a cup of Blue cheese dressing and half ranch. People noticed the blue cheese hint without being overpowering. Next time i might substitute half the cheddar with Monterey Jack cheese. That might cut down on the visible oil from the cheddar! Overall very yummy!

We used actual chicken, not chicken in a can.  Also, instead of using shredded cheddar cheese we shredded a block of cheddar (the flour coating on the shredded cheddar added too much grease to an already greasy dish).  Very good - definitely going to add bacon next time!!

BEST DIP EVER! I found this recipe here years ago as a trial and it is required for me to bring to every party. I'm literally not allowed to come without this dip! Hubby tries to eat it for dinner. Make it just the way it is, and use FRANKS! I use all generic ingredients (store brand) except brand-name franks red hot is a must. Years later... the recipe is still a hit :)

Made it twice, both times halved the recipe so it would fit in my tiny crockpot. Both my husband and my son loved it, my daughter, who is 9 wasn't a fan, but she's still in that picky food stage. I didn't bother with the cheddar cheese since I didn't have room for it in the pot. No one seemed to miss it.

Really good!  I discovered Neufchatel cheese...same great cream cheese taste but so much lighter in taste!  I took the advise of another reviewer and layered the ingredients (cream cheese, chicken mixture and shredded cheese,) but I think I'll mix all of the ingredients together next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe many times and it's great every time!  I do find that if you let it sit the spicer it becomes.  I do not put it in the crock pot.  We have it right out of the pan. We also like it cold on toast as a buffalo chicken sandwich.

While the Broncos did lose, this recipe for buffalo chicken dip was a more than satisfying consolation for such a sour defeat. Living in Belize, it was a good way to combine the nostalgia of eating this at home with the adventure of making this with a pinch of Belizean improvisation. This is a delicious recipe that is more than worthy of sacrificing my arm to be punched by a nun (in her defense, all the dip was eaten...) Thank you, NUNPUNCH!

Everyone loved it! I was a little reluctant to use the canned chicken but nobody could tell the difference and neither could I Bc in the past, I used recipes w fresh chicken which took a lot longer.  This recipe was amazing and sooooo much easier than using fresh chicken!

I have made this recipe many, many times and people request this all the time.  I only gave 4 stars because I have changed 2 things when I make this.  I won't use canned chicken (tastes fine but it smell like canned tuna fish to me) soI cook a couple chicken breasts.  And, instead of ranch I use blue cheese dressing.

I enjoy anything to do with buffalo chicken. This was a big hit for me and for everyone I work with. I prefer to go ahead and mix all of the cheese in it instead of sprinkling it on top because when you stir it or dip it out it melts down in it anyway.

VEGETARIAN VERSION:
I always envy this dish at events because I love the "buffalo" flavor, but don't eat meat.  I chop 3 cans of artichoke hearts and use in place of chicken.  I've had meat-eaters tell me they like it better than with chicken!  Also, like some other reviewers, I just bake it on 350 til bubbly and a little brown on top

This was very tasty, I took this to a company christmas lunch and there was nothing left.  The only change that I made is that I mixed in crumbled Blue cheese into the dip.

I use 1 cup Frank's Red Hot and 1/2-3/4 cup of ranch since we like it spicier. Also, I serve it with tortilla chips too. It's been a hit everywhere I bring it and I've given the recipe out numerous times. It's so yummy!

I made this for a baby shower and it tasted great and the guests thought it was a great idea.  I used 3 chicken breasts poached in water and shredded.  I topped it with cheese as directed, and baked in the oven as another review suggested.  Unfortunately instead of becoming bubbly and appetizing, it sort of curdled and disappeared under a layer of orange oil.  Besides this presentation malfunction, it tasted really good and I would make it again!  Also it was not all that spicy, adjust accordingly.

My sister makes this dip for every family function, and I can't eat it fast enough. She omits the ranch and it is just so yummy! I could eat it with a spoon. When we make it though, we bake 2 large chicken breasts in the oven and splash it with franks buffalo sauce; then we shred the chicken with 2 forks. Great recipe for parties!

Loved it! The only thing I  did different was to parboiled 2 chicken breast and shredded instead of the can chucked chicken. Other then that it was a big hit at our party. Thanks for sharing!

What a great dip recipe!  We used less cheese than the recipe called for, more Frank's Red Hot Sauce, and added diced jalapenos.  Delicious!

I expected to love this dip because of the high ratings it has gotten, but neither my husband nor I liked it at all.  It has a strong Frank's Red Hot pepper sauce taste, which just didn't suit us. I won't make this again.

Big hit with everyone! I took the advice of others and used chicken breasts instead of canned meat. Tasted great and much cheaper! I used my small crockpot and toward the second half of its time in there, it started to form ALOT of grease. I just used to spoon to get it out. I will make this again and again and again!

It's good as is, but I use less cream cheese and more ranch than the recipe calls for because we thought the cream cheese was a little overpowering.

Everyone loved this dip!  I boiled 1.4 pounds of chicken breast cut into small pieces.  Then I shredded the chicken and mixed with Texas Pete's Buffalo Wing Sauce.  Oh, and I used blue cheese dressing instead of the ranch.  I have made this several different ways:  1.  I mixed all ingredients in the skillet until hot.  2.  I layered the cream cheese/blue cheese mixture under the chicken/sauce mixture and sprinkled with cheese.  Then, I put in the oven until bubbling (approximately 25min) on 375.  3.  I mixed the warm chicken/sauce mixture in an ovensafe bowl and mixed with the softened cream cheese/blue cheese mixture and heated in the oven in the same manner as process 2 above after sprinkling with cheese.  I liked processes 1 and 3 the best.  By the way, if the chicken is too chunky, it won't work well with crackers or celery.  I liked it with the Scoops chips the best.  Any leftovers I served wrapped in tortillas heated in a skillet with a little butter.

This was pretty good, added extra cheese.
Ended up heating it up in the skillet and served right away. I liked it better with the chicken crackers over the celery

I layered this as another reviewer suggested. I prefer it that way instead of all mixed up. I baked it at 350 for 20 mins. Very easy to make!

Such an easy, quick appetizer to make, and it's always a crowd-pleaser.  I make this recipe as it is written, but also add about 1/2 cup of blue cheese crumbles to the mixture - try it out, it's a great addition!  :)

I don't use canned chicken; opted for rotisserie instead.  We dipped celery, crackers, meatballs, and pita bread into this.  My husband's exact words: "Never stop making this EVER."

This is a good base but it was too bland for myself and my family.  I upped the hot sauce quite a bit and added chives and black pepper.  I also used chunky blue cheese instead of ranch, tasted just like wings.  Yum!

The color makes people tentative to try it.  However, it usually takes one person to taste it for the dip to become the hit dish at the party.  I usually follow the recipe exactly.

This is an excellent recipe for parties! I have made this recipe many times just as written, some people think its a little spicy, so the hot sauce can be adjusted and just add to taste. A majority of my friends love it as is and I have been nick-named the great dip-maker of the group. Thanks for this recipe!

I didn't put nearly 3/4 cup of hot sauce and this was still good and guests loved it. I did seem a little too creamy so maybe next time I cut down the amount of cream cheese.

Made this for a work potluck. Instead of canned chicken, I used 4 chicken breasts (on the smallish size) that I boiled then shredded. I measured out the shredded chicken to make sure and it equaled 20 oz almost perfectly. This was a huge hit!! Very tasty.

I made this two weekends in a row for two different sets of people and it was a hit!!!   I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  I shredded storebought rotisserie chicken instead of canned.  I may have added an extra tablespoon of hotsauce.  Will be making lots of this.  So easy!

Love this!  I've made it a few times now and have gotten lots of compliments.  I've used both Texas Pete and Frank's Red Hot, and both are delicious.  I add a little more hot sauce because we like it spicy, and it is so good with wheat crackers.  I do use store bought shredded cheese but have never had any problems.  I skipped the slow cooker and poured the stove-heated mixture into a 8 in sq baking dish and put into a preheated oven on 350 for 20-25 minutes.  Perfection.

I make this same dip with the same exact ingredients but instead of mixing them together, I layer them.
-cream cheese
-chicken
-ranch
-hot sauce
-shredded cheese
Then I just cook in the oven until the cheese is melted.  I have even put it in the microwave.  It's a hit every time and the cook time is about 20 minutes.  Nice for a last minute party dish.

Amazing....a must have for any Football party! I mix everything up ahead of time and leave the dip in the fridge until about 40 minutes before the guests arrive and pop it in the oven.  Always a hit!

I did not use canned chicken.  Instead I cut up rotisserie chicken and added a little extra pepper sauce.  Was delish!

I took this for a friend's birthday and it was a HIT!   It's spicy, but the guys really loved it.   They ate an entire crock pot of it!  I did add a pinch of celery seed to it.

Mmmm this was good. I used two boiled chicken breasts, about 1 cup blue cheese, 1 8oz container of cream cheese and almost the whole bottle of franks hot sauce. I put mozzarella cheese on top and backed until the top was browned. If u add 2 8 oz containers of cream cheese then i would add an extra chicken breast because i think it would be floating in cream cheese but thats just my opinion. I served with fritos. My husband and i enjoyed this very much.

This is a fantastic dip to bring to any party. We served it with bread from our bread machine and chips. 

Easy to make and went FAST! One friend said they wished they could just eat it by the spoonful.

Tastes very much like buffalo chicken. I'm not big on the canned chicken though, it almost dissolves into the mixture. Next time I'll cook and chop my own chicken breasts instead.

I use this recipe to make Buffalo Pizza.  I make the recipe as posted and instead of putting it in a crockpot to dip, I buy flat bread and put enough of the dip on each flat bread, top with cheese and put it in the oven until the cheese melts and then cut it like a little personnel pan pizza.  Very Good!

I made this for New Years and it was a big hit.  I did use canned chicken, but next time I will try it with fresh.  I took a tip from another reviewer and put the canned chicken in the pepper sauce the night before.

This stuff is awesome! I made this for a potluck at work. Great & can be assembled the night before: I melted on the ingredients (except the cheddar) on the stovetop, then, put into a 9x13 casserole dish, topped it with the cheddar, covered it, and left in the fridge overnight. Then, toted it to work and popped it in the oven when ready. Also, used 1 pkg lowfat and 1 pkg fat free (that one was accidental, but worked out well) cream cheese & light ranch. No one could tell it was "healthier". Also, my cans of chicken were 12.5 oz each (it's what I had). I serve mine with tortilla chips. Love this stuff and it's not super spicy, the cream cheese & ranch cool it down but still love the yummy flavor.

Yum!  This was super tasty.  I made it exactly as written. Well- maybe just a few extra splashes of Frank's since we like hot.  But other than that one, tiny prefetence it was word-for-word and DELISH!  I will be making this again.  Only negative was when someone was complimenting it and asked what was in it, their eyes bugged just a bit and I'm sure I saw "fat/sodium" figures running through their head.  A great indulgence!

This is now our favorite dip! It tastes just like Buffalo wings without all the work. My son couldn't stop eating it! I didn't tell him I had used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and had added some extra blue cheese crumbles. YUM!!

I made this with the same ingredients except low fat cream cheese and low fat cheese, didn't think anyone knew it was low fat.  This was so yummy.  My husband started eating it before I got it in the oven.  I mixed most of the cheese in and some on top.  I thought I might use a bit less hot sauce next time, maybe 1/2 cup.  I did have left over as there weren't as many people at the party as I thought and it was better I thought even the next few days, so I would not hesitate making this ahead of time next time.  I did add a little seasoning in the water when I poached the chicken, but don't think it made any difference. It was great with the celery sticks especially, so I would chop 2 bunches next time.  The next day I made chicken salad with extra chicken I had and threw a scoop of this in it and what great chicken salad it made!

Excellent dip!  I've made it with ranch and blue cheese - both good.
One note about boiling chicken - DON'T!!  Steam, bake, broil, pan fry if you can.  When you boil anything in water, you lose lots of the flavor and it goes down the drain with the water (chicken broth).

I used grilled chicken, 1.5 packages lite cream cheese, and 1/2 cup ranch and layered the chicken over the cream cheese mixture like suggested.  The dip was DELICIOUS, my family could not get enough.  I will def. be making this again.

Although I didn't have any at our super bowl party tonight, I received TONS of compliments as people RAVED over this dip.  I also used fresh chicken breast, used blue cheese dressing instead of the ranch and I added chopped onion as well, which I cooked first until translucent.  I can't wait to make it again and actually eat it!

We used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  Mixed the cream cheese and blue cheese together, and then poured the hot sauce over the shredded chicken in a separate bowl, then mixed it all together.  Finally, we threw the cheese into the mixture, with a handful of cheese on top, and baked at 350 for 25 min.  We used a bit more hot sauce, about a cup.  Was A HIT at the superbowl party- served with Fritos and Tostitos.  This is our new signature dip.

Delicious!!!  It really does taste like a creamy version of buffalo wings.  I used shredded chicken breast that I had leftover from another recipe and chopped it up.  I made it on the stovetop on low instead of a slow cooker and it came out wonderfully.

this is soooo good i think i could eat it with a spoon!  i'm not a celery fan but really enjoy it with crackers and with a variety of other raw veggies.  i usually add significantly more hot sauce, but if younger ones will be having it too, then it's good where it is for flavor without too much heat.

Great dip!  I added some Swiss and mozzarella cheese just to add more depth to the flavor.  I used diced chicken breast instead of canned.  Also, I finished it off in the oven, on broil, to melt the cheese.  The color is fine, especially since I sprinkled some additional hot sauce on top.  Yum!!

I make one very similar to this and am asked to bring it to all get togethers.  The only difference is:  I use my George Foreman and grill chicken breasts. (I don't like the taste of canned chicken.)  I then mince it really fine.  Instead of adding pepper sauce I add medium Buffalo Wild Wing sauce.  Other than that, it's the same.  It is so good.

Really excellent, but I prefer it with buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's) over pepper sauce. It gives it the true buffalo flavor. Love it with tortilla chips or fritos!

This is yummy! You can make it even tangier by melting the cream cheese with a bottle of chuncky blue cheese dressing (rather than Ranch), then pouring that over the chicken mixed with Frank's Hot Wing Suace. Bake it for 30 minutes @ 350 degrees. Then, add 2-3 cups grated cheese. Pop it back into the oven just long enough to melt that top cheese. Serve with Scoops or over baked potatoes. Enjoy!

Another tip - you can just dump all the ingredients in the crock pot instead of cooking some of it on the stove top and then switching it to the slow cooker. Easier and you dirty less dishes :)

I have been making a version of this recipe forever and am always asked for the recipe.  I use 1.5 lbs cooked chicken chopped up (worth it), 1/2 jar of Franks Red Hot "Buffalo", 1 jar of Marias Blue Cheese(found in produce section), 1 block of cream cheese.  Mix all together, bake 350 for 20 min and serve with Tostitoes!  Yummy!

This was amazing! I baked 4 chicken breasts w/ just a smidge of salt and pepper instead of canned chicken (which is yucky!) and chopped them up. I also used Blue Cheese dressing instead of ranch and used 4oz. of crumbled blue cheese instead of cheddar. I cooked it in a crockpot for a while and then transferred it to a warming dish for serving. It was excellent! My husband loved it. I am going to make it again on Super Bowl Sunday. A keeper.

With alterations definately 5 stars! Use real chicken and dice in food processor Add 1-2 oz blue cheese Mix cheese in instead of putting on top Bake in oven dish not pan, you can stir it and it keeps its yummy look longer than baking on a sheet topped with cheese. If you like things really spicey you can use some of Frank Buffalo Sauce at the hot level, using all at this level was way too hot for us but using it for about 1/3 of the sauce in the recipe really gave it a great kick for those who like thigns spicey

Made this yesterday and took Scout99's advice and layered the dip and baked it. I actually didn't like it that way. The cheese on top cooked up hard and the layers didn't mix well. I used diced chicken from the store as I was in a hurry but dicing the chicken didn't make it it very dip-like. Next time I will boil my chicken, then shred it and mix the layers before baking it. Update: Made this a 2nd time, mixing all the ingredients together using 2 c shredded rotissierie chicken, 1/2 c blue cheese, 1/2 c ranch and baked for 20 min at 350 degrees. Here's my assessment: the mixing is good, as is using the shredded chicken. Didn't like the bleu cheese and the whole thing is just too creamy. I think I'd use less cream cheese next time, but I'm also still searching for the right thing to eat with this dip. Celery is good, crackers and bread are too heavy, but it's just not right. Also, 3/4 c hot sauce is too much. 1/2 cup would do just fine.

I ve been making this recipe from here for a while and tried several tweaks, all of which are good. My point being, you can play with this recipe. I have however found a way around the "Canned chicken" taste that people seem to dislike. Canned is so much more convienient, so I marinate my chicken in the hot sauce for an hour or two before I put the dip together, this tends to let the tin flavor disappear. Ejoy this recipe...however you may tweak it- it's always requested at parties!

yummy! I didn't measure anything exactly that didn't use a whole can or package, just used the measurements as guides for how much to squeeze or scoop in. (I think I overestimated the chili sauce so then had to add some more ranch to cut the spice.) I also didn't waste a dish on the whole stove/saucepan thing, just tossed the whole mess in the crock pot on high and stirred it around a couple times until it had melted. Super yummy! I was so pleased to find a version of this that used ranch like should be on buffalo wings rather than bleu cheese.

Use blue cheese dressing. Anyone who knows buffalo style knows you don't use ranch.

Delicious with just a few changes! As others have suggested, I poached chicken breasts instead of using canned. I also used a deli-quality bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch and omitted the cheddar cheese to cut down on the fat (just slightly!). Once cooked, I put the dip in a hollowed-out sourdough round loaf, sprinkled a little cheese on top and served with slightly toasted french bread slices and celery.

This thing was a crazy hit.  I had to use a full cup of Franks's Red Hot, because once the cheeses and ranch were added, it wasn't spicy.  And I'm a spice weenie. I took home an empty crock pot. People seem to like it the most when I use Frank's Buffalo Red Hot.

I used blue cheese dressing and neufchatel instead of cream cheese as for the lower fat contents and an kind of chicken shredded (not a fan of canned chicken) - to make it a meal I cook some pasta (bowtie, rotini, fussilli whatever your fave) prepare dip in a saucepot on stovetop without topping with the remaining cheese, pour cooked pasta in oven proof casserole dish, add dip and a veggie (broccoli, peas, bell peppers, celery...) stir, cover with remaining shredded cheese and bake in oven on 375 F for 20 minutes. serving suggestion with green salad on the side.

I tried this recipe because it had so many good reviews.  But, I am not so sure about it.  At the party,  I put it in my mini slow cooker and put it in the corner.  I did not like it at first. Finally, after 3 hours of cooking, it started to not taste or smell funny.  I think it was the canned chicken that made it strange, and that just had to cook off.  In the end, it tasted okay, but the beginning of it I was sure it was not going to work out well.

Really tasty and easy recipe. I whipped it together while giving friends directions to our house and had it ready by the time they got here.  I usually stick to the recipe exactly first time around. This time I strayed just slightly. I put half of the ranch in before realizing it overpowered the other flavors. I cut it off at 3/4 C and added a little more Frank's Red Hot sauce. I'm glad I did. All the same, this is an excellent recipe.

We make this all the time.  We've made it with ranch and bleu cheese depending on what we had on hand at the time.  We now favor bleu cheese in it.  I don't use canned chicken.  I just chop up whatever leftover chicken we have and throw it in.  (Leftover MARINATED chicken is the best! My fave is Pretty Chicken Marinated from this site) We make 1/2 of the recipe in a 8x8 pan and always eat it with tortilla chips!

I made a couple changes to this recipe and I think it tastes better my way. I cooked two boneless, skinless chicken breasts and chopped them up instead of using canned chicken. Also, used 1/2 ranch and 1/2 blue cheese dressing instead of all ranch. I love this dip!

Excellent recipe! My husband and his friends always devour this! I use 2 c. cheddar cheese and add a bit more hot sauce. I also bake it in the oven at 350 for 30 - 40 minutes, stirring frequently instead of using the crock pot. I serve with Tostitos. Perfect for football tailgates!

More than anything I can say about this is overshadowed by my anti-all-dips-husband.  I made it for an outing over a friend's house and when he heard we were bringing dip - he was HORRIFIED (he thinks of bringing dip as equivalent to bringing a bag of Pork Rinds to a dinner party).  It took hearing a few of the guests complimenting it before he would try it but when he finally did, he was very surprised - and impressed.  It really is good.  I made it just as written (except for baking in the oven at 350 for 30 min instead of the slow cooker), although, I did half the hot sauce initially.  It didn't seem to have enough kick (and we're not spicy food people) so I threw in some more (probably still didn't equal the 3/4 c. called for).  Very very good!!!!

I'm sorry, but I thought this was the worst thing I have ever made.  It was extremely spicy and the color was a real turn-off.I made a double batch as I had 40 people coming for a party, and it was barley touched. What a waste of time and money. As far as I was concerned, it was inedible, so I am shocked at the reviews.

This was excellent and will become a party staple. I followed someone else's suggestion and used 1/2c ranch and 1/2 c blue cheese dressing

I have been making this for years. I use fat free cream cheese and use low fat blue cheese dressing in the recipe.  We use crackers, tortilla chips and celery for this dip. I also take this camping in a foil cake pan. I make it ahead of time and sit it over the fire to heat it up-delish!

Use 1 pound of cooked chicken in place of the canned - you will not be disappointed!  Also, I like to put 1/2 cup of ranch and 1/2 cup of bleu cheese dressing in this dish and it just takes it up a notch.  Try a spicier than usual hot sauce, too!  I don't know why but a little extra heat seems to make the dip that much more addictive. Serve it with Fritos. Great party food!

We made this last night for the Superbowl. It was a big hit.  The only thing I did differently was to sautee my own chicken to add.  Great flavor, especially with the "Chicken in a Biscuit" crackers. We be making again soon.

This was the hit of my Christmas party. Everyone asked for the recipe.  Like others, I used two 6-8 oz. cooked, diced chicken breasts instead of canned.

This has quickly become one of my favorites! However, like others my variation is a little different. I use a small dip sized crock pot and add 2 blocks of cream cheese. Then I add about a tbsp or so (to taste) of ranch dressing mix and mix with the cream cheese. Next, I add 2 cooked and shredded chicken breasts and the hot sauce to the crock pot. Stir it all up let it heat thoroughly and add 1 cup of cheddar cheese. Let this melt and you are ready to go. YUMMY!! Everyone who has this asks for the recipe... so easy and so good!

Love it!  I like either version; blue cheese or ranch.  If you use blue cheese dressing I would add a bit of crumbled blue cheese in place of a bit of the cheddar.

Excellent thanks!

Simple, easy, tasty and a big hit at a recent Halloween party! A bit too spicy for the younger kids but it was great to have a creamy "adult" dip ;) Stayed warm in the slow-cooker for hours.

This is amazing! After reading the other reviews here are the changes I made. I boiled 3 boneless chicken breasts and shredded them. In a saucepan I combined 3/4 cup of Ranch and 3/4 cup Blue Cheese with 8oz of Cream Cheese. In a skillet I melted 3 tbs of butter and cooked the chicken in it for a few minutes. I then added 1/2 cup of Red Hot and 1/2 cup of Red Hot Wing Sauce. Once the chicken and hot sauce were combined I poured it in with the dressing and cream cheese mixture. I didn't see a need to bake this or layer it. It was great mixed together. We ate this with tortilla chips and fritos. I will make this one over and over again!

This is absolutely amazing.  I have made it a few times and I prefer it with bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch.  But it's excellent either way - I had to use buttermilk ranch this last time and it turned out fantastic!  I half the recipe when it's just me and the hubby wanting some munchies for late night TV.  GREAT with chicken-in-a-biscuit crackers!!!

I thought this dip was just okay - but a lot of people loved it at the party I went to so I averaged it out and gave it four stars. I'll probably make this again for sure without the ranch dressing and with blue cheese dressing. Blue cheese would have made this a five star recipe.

Yummy! Made this for a football party at the request of my boyfriend and everyone ate it right up! We like spicy food so I used a whole bottle of Red Hot. I also used 3 big cans of chicken and I'm glad I did as it was just enough. I was going to use fresh chicken but realized that this dish isn't really about the chiken but the hot sauce and cheeses.... And by the time the dip has finished cooking down you wouldn't be able to tell the quality of the chicken because it all falls apart. Will make this one again!

I debated giving this 5 stars.  It's very, very good.  I made it for a large gathering and everyone who tried it really loved it.  I made it exact except I doubled it and didn't add the cheddar on top.  The reason I didn't add the cheddar on top was because I added what was called for to the mixture and almost immediatly I had a greasy river running all over the dip.  I used shredded Sargento cheddar so I don't know?  I tasted it before I added the cheddar and was shocked at how much it tasted like buffalo wings!  At that point it looked pretty good too.  It went downhill after I added the cheddar.  Adding the cheddar caused the color to go a bit off and as I said before the grease.  So I will make it again but I won't add any cheddar.  It's great without it!!

Tasted horrible the first time around with canned chicken so I tried it again with fresh chicken.  It has the potential to be a good dip but I did not like it and barely anyone ate it.  I will not make this again.

This a delicious dip and I have never made it without being asked for the recipe.  The only change I make is to mix everything together in a bowl and spoon into a small crockpot, set on low for a couple of  hours!  Skip the pan stuff and just toss it all into a bowl!  I recently made it for our craft night and it was a hit with all the girls - it takes something really yummy to tear these women away from their scrapbooking :) even for a minute!

Yum! I layered my dip like a lot of others did. Cream cheese, Ranch dressing, chicken mixed with Franks Red Hot buffalo sauce, and then a Jack/Colby blend. Cheddar can separate and get greasy so I opted for a better melting cheese. My DH loved it and it was so simple.

This was pretty tasty. Easy enough to make. I did end up adding more hot sauce because it was kind of bland for my tastes.  I liked it with the celery, but next time I will definitely pass on the chicken flavored crackers. They were weird with this.  Oh, and this does not taste just like buffalo wings by any stretch, but it is tasty in its own. Makes a lot too, so if you are only having a small group, you may want to half the recipe.  I might make this again.

Great recipe!  I did use blue cheese instead of ranch, just my personal preference.  I also boiled and shreded 3 chicken breasts and let it soak overnight in the hot sauce.  I can't wait to serve it at our big Super Bowl party!

I made this for a Christmas party a few weeks ago and it was a HIT!!! I first made it exactly the way the recipe calls for [ mixing it all in and putting in crockpot], and the result was visually UNAPPETIZING. Instead of throwing it out, i left it on warm in crockpot and remade another batch, layering it like someone else suggested. This time it was 100% better looking and people were RAVING about it. I ended up putting the crockpot full out after the 9x13 pan was gone of it. People still ate it but were super skeptical of its appearance. I HIGHLY suggest going with the layering method over the mix it all together. People definately judge food by its appearance, regardless of what it may taste like.

This is the perfect dip to make in a pinch. Couldn't get any quicker and easier to make than this. And its delicious! The canned chicken worked great for me and I omitted the cheddar cheese (It wasn't necessary). I have even used the dip and mixed it with hot pasta for a zesty meal.

Love It!  I have made this for my family as well as for a couple of parties and I get rave reviews every time and asked for the recipe.  I add more Franks to kick it up a notch and always used fresh boiled chicken instead of canned.

Made this for the 1st time at my sons 2nd bday.  Everyone absolutely loved it!! I used real chix in sm. chunks instead of canned, 1/2 the cheese (only the 1st step), little less ranch dressing and a tad more hot sauce (I like a kick to it). I got asked for the recipe throughout the whole party. Was told it was better than some restaurants. Def. make it again.

This dip was great! I am not a fan of the canned chicken so I poached 3 small chicken breasts and then put them in the food processor. Worked like a charm. Mixed everything up....minus most of the cheese. I didnt think the recipe needed it so I just sprinkled some on the top.
The grease everyone speaks of is from the wing sauce not the cheese. I had it on top of mine and since I barely used any cheese it has to be from that.
I also used the Franks wing sauce as recommended by others.
It was great with Fritos scoops and celery cut into nubs. Nubs so that there is no need to double dip.
I am making it again this weekend!

This recipe deserved 10 stars!  I used chicken breast, boiled and shredded.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  I also found that Texas Pete's buffalo chicken sauce worked the best.
I made this twice, once in the baking dish, then in the crockpot.  A word of advice--if making for a crowd and want to keep it warm in a slow cooker, be sure the cooker's low temp is really low.  I came back to check on the dip only to see that the heat was too high and the dip had separated.  Despite this, everyone raved about it, and 4 months later I'm still getting co-workers asking for the recipe.  GREAT recipe!!

My husband and I really loved this dip. I made a couple changes, but I don't believe my changes improved or took away from the dip as a whole. I boiled chicken (mixed pieces), shredded, and used those, which is considerably cheaper than the canned chicken. Then, we used Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce instead of the regular Red Hot Sauce. I also made Ranch Dressing II from this site to use in the dip. The texture was very creamy and the taste was a wonderful combination of spice and smoothness. We served the dip with celery, crackers, and tortilla chips and enjoyed it immensely. I literally can not wait to make it again!

This dip is awesome!! I made a few changes though. Some of my family has an aversion to cream cheese so I used sour cream instead and I did it all on top of the stove, then put it into a crock pot for serving. I had no problems with grease on top. Maybe because of the sour cream. Its a big hit at our ladies night karaoke parties!

Using the canned chicken gave this dip a strange tuna like flavor (yes, I'm certain it was canned chicken).  It was left virtually uneaten at a party I took it to.  Sorry :(

Made this last night for hubby and I, as he loves buffalo chicken.  We thought the flavor of this was outstanding.  Perfect amount of hot sauce (I used Franks Red Hot as suggested).  This was my first time using canned chicken and I wasn't too impressed, its pretty stringy and gets absorbed in the buffalo sauce, so there's not many chunks.  Next time I will boil chicken breasts and chop them myself, as they will hold up better.  I omitted the cheddar cheese altogether - I am all about cheese, but I could tell that it would be overkill! It shouldnt even be in the ingredients list. I also baked mine at 350 for about 25 min., and added blue cheese crumbles in and on top of the dip.  (Also used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch! Thats a must!) We ate this with Tostitos scoops and liked it that way.  Hubby had a really good suggestion for next time - the dip is kinda runny, so he suggested putting in a handful or two of plain croutons in the dip, to absorb some of the sauce and give the dip more "substance".  Anyway, if you have a craving for buffalo wings, this recipe will surely satisfy!

Delish!  I added blue cheese, as other have suggested, plus crumbled blue cheese pieces both in and on the dip.  I heated it up in the oven at 350 for 20-30 minutes and served it.  This is definitely a new favorite!

This is an AWESOME recipe! Combining the suggestions of a few previous readers and knowing how I LOVE my bleu cheese dip with hot wings, I substituted a refrigerated bleu cheese dressing for the ranch dressing; and stirred in 4 ounces of bleu cheese crumbles inplace of all of the cheddar cheese.  This was NOT overpowering on the bleu cheese taste, infact I'll probably add more next time.  Also, by eliminating the cheddar cheese, I didn't have any trouble with it being greasy.  I made this for a Couples Halloween Costume Party and it was a BIG HIT.  We had to leave early and I was FORCED to leave my crockpot with leftovers at the party because I COULD NOT take it away until it was all finished.  I ended up giving the recipe out to numerous people. I KNOW THIS ONE gets a definite 5-STAR RATING and I'll be making this again and again.  Oh, I served with plenty of celery, and I think people enjoyed it with tortilla chips that other people had brought for their own dips, too.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE NUNPUNCH!!

this turned out great for my scrapbooking party.  After reading the reviews I substituted velveeta for cheddar and had no problems with grease.  I also poached and shredded my own chicken.  ThaNKS IT WAS A HIT.

Served the dip for a football party and it was a huge hit. I took notice to comments regarding the cheddar cheese so I reduced the cheese by half even though most said to leave it out. I must agree that IT'S DEFINITELY NOT NEEDED.  The dip is so rich and the cheddar doesn't add additional flavor only addtn'l calories!! Will definitely make for super bowl (minus the cheddar cheese).

What a hit at girls' night!!  Everyone went wild for this, and my husband even loved the leftovers.  I followed the ingredients list exactly, except I used boiled, shredded chicken breast instead of canned.  I cooked the whole thing in a saucepan on top of the stove, spread the hot dip in a quiche type plate, topped it with the reserved cheese, and just popped it in  the microwave to heat it through again just before serving.  The celery was perfect for it, as it counteracted the spicy dip.  I also used those Tostito scoops, as someone suggested. This recipe is a real winner.

Great appetizer for anyone doing the Atkins diet!  I used less ranch and shredded some grilled chicken breasts.  I also halved the recipe and baked it at 350 in a pie plate until bubbly.  For those of us NOT on Atkins, tortilla chips make excellent "dippers" with this recipe!

This dip is wonderful, and apparently was served at many Super Bowl parties!  I sent half with my daughter to one party; the other half went with us.  I was oringinally concerned about the amount of hot sauce.  I started with 1/2 C, but increased it to the 3/4 C after taste testing by my husband and daughter.  All loved it and did not think it was too hot.  I did serve it with the chicken crackers and celery, and was surprised how much everyone, men included, liked the celery.

It makes a lot, so half the recipe for 2-3 people. I only used 1 stick of cream cheese and it was still delicious. Ate with celery and carrots, which was tasty, and even better with plain ripple potato chips. Also tried it in a pita and it was good.

I have made this both with full fat ingredients and low fat (fat free cream cheese, yogurt based low-fat ranch, fat free cheddar) and both ways turned out very tasty.  Anytime I've made this people comment on how good it is, my family like this so much, I've made it for dinner a few times :-)

This is delicious! It tastes exactly like the buffalo ranch dip I was expecting! I grill 1 lb of boneless chicken breasts and hand shred them once they're cooked. I soften the cream cheese in the microwave, usually takes 1-2 minutes. I took the advice of others by layering. I spread the ranch and cream cheese  mixture on the bottom of a 8x10 dish. I then spread the chicken and buffalo mixture on top of the ranch/cream cheese layer. I used Moore's Creamy Ranch Buffalo Sauce because it's not too spicy and it adds to the ranch flavor. I baked the dip for 20 minutes at 350 degrees and top with cheddar cheese. I love this recipe and have made it multiple times. Definitely a family favorite

I take a long baguette and slice it about 1/2 inch thick. Then I brush both sides with butter and lay the out flat on a cookie sheet. I sprinkle them with garlic salt and bake them at 425 until Golden. Perfect for dipping in this dip!

Simply delicious!  Tastes like the dip I had in a restaurant! I didn't make it in the crock pot, instead I cooked it on the stove as directed then put it in the oven at 450° for 25 minutes then topped with cheese. Next time I week try the crock pot method but the oven turned out just fine! Five stars!

This is a great recipe for parties and football. Easy to throw together, and has always been well received by those served. I've substituted blue cheese dressing for the ranch, turned out great. It goes quickly so keep in mind the crowd size. Between four guys on football Sunday, it will last almost a full quarter-almost. Also goes great with regular ole potato chips.

This is the football season dip of all time! I dont change any of the ingredients. But I do just throw everything in the crockpot on low for 3 hours. Its less mess and the ingredients have time to meld together. I make this ALL the time. Thanks!

Just soooo good!  Mad this for Super Bowl and several times since then.  One of the best dips I have had.  I just mixed all ingredients and put in a small crockpot.  Very easy and so tasty! Will keep this as one of my family favorites!

This dip won me 1st place in a dip competition with all of my friends and everyone really enjoyed it. The only change I made was adding a lot more hot sauce. I used the entire bottle of Frank's instead of only 3/4 of a cup.

I took the suggestions of a few other reviews and used half blue cheese dressing and half ranch and I cooked boneless chicken breast and shredded it instead of canned chicken. Also used Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce and a little Franks Red Hot It was a big hit for SuperBowl.Thank you for the recipe!

I made this recipe and the only change that I made was using my own cooked chicken, because I do not like canned chicken. This tastes great and everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this about half a dozen times so far and with some substitutions it comes out great.  We have pot-luck's at my work about once every two months and if I didn't bring some of this in my co-workers would be pissed.  The substitutions are: grilling two chicken breasts with McCormick's dry rub and shredding them in a food processor, using Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo hot sauce, Hidden Valley ranch dressing (the packets you make with mayo and milk), and adding some colby-jack cheese in addition to the cheddar.  I have found the best thing to eat it with is Keebler original Club crackers.  I even had some extra and used it in an omelet one morning and it was fantastic!

I made this for the first time to take to a party. My recipe called for cooking chicken, and I thought I was so clever using canned - I believe in easy! I left this dip in the crock pot because it is best warm, and we plugged it in.

I can honestly say that many people did not leave the spot all evening, while some came and went throughout the evening! The conversations over that pot were as warm as the compliments. I hated having to share because I wanted to be the special lady who brought this dish! Oh, and my husband couldn't get enough - poor soul, he hates chicken!!

Great dip been making it for years. I recommend blue cheese dressing though. I found ranch an odd choice seeing as chicken wings go with blue cheese not ranch. I also use an entire fully cooked rotisseriea chicken torn up without skin. Not sure what canned chicken is but sounds gross and lastly I use more franks as well. Turns out amazing every time!

Awesome!  This was the first thing to go at my NYE party.  I don't like canned chicken so I boiled chicken breasts like others had done & it was delicious.  Everything else I followed exactly.

Have made this for years - but trust me - it's SOOOO much better made with Ken's Thick and Chunky Blue Cheese dressing -- the 'ranch' is ok, but so over used, and not appropriate for Buffalo Wings at all

I am now required in my employment contract to make this dip for any pitch-in. If I don't make it, I may receive death threats from co-workers. People rely on this stuff like it's crack. But seriously, it is awesome. I think the reason people like it so well is that instead of canned chicken, I always make a few chicken breasts and then shred the meat with two forks as finely as I can (a food processor would be easier). I also replace Frank's hot sauce with Gringo Bandito because it is amazing!

I made this recipe for an early Christmas party at work today...The results were an empty dish!!!everybody loved it!The only thing I did different was fry 5 large pieces of maple bacon,then chopped the slices into small pieces, after that I mixed the bacon bits in with the rest of the mixture, set the oven to 350 and let the dip bake for 20 minutes. The results were amazing!Just the right amount of spice from the hot sauce(Frank's) with a combo of sweetness from the maple bacon. This dip will be used for a lot of years to come, especially for Super Bowl parties!!!

The only thing I did different was I kept it in the skillet on low heat and let it bubble instead of slow cooker. It was AWESOME. My mom and dad both just had a huge bowl and couldn't get enough of it. I'm bringing it to school tomorrow :)

This is a great recipe and perfect for parties or gatherings because it's good hot or room temperature.   Definitely don't used canned chicken though, take the time to use chicken breasts it makes a huge difference.

This is one dip you can never go wrong with and every man in your life will adore! This version seemed a little more complicated than it needs to be. I just use a small crockpot (depending on how many people you are serving) and put the block of cream cheese in to soften as it heats up. Then add the 2 cans of chicken (drained), 1/2 cup of Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce, 1 cup of ranch dressing, and I use a cup of shredded mozzarella cheese. My husband's friends request it when they come over and it's even great leftover! If you love wings, you will love this dip.

Can't get enough. Lots of positive reviews from my guests.  I love it with celery.  Made it with ranch because my daughter doesnt like blue cheese but I would like to try it that way.  I used a rotisseri chicken.  I did not warm the chicken.  I microwaved the cream cheese in my mixing bowl to soften it and mixed everything together except cheddar and parmasean to top it off.

I made this as written the first time, only substituting fresh chicken breast, and it was to creamy for our taste. The second time I only used 1 thing of cream cheese and it is AMAZING! Fresh chicken is a must. This dip is requested at every party we go to. There's never any left over.

Great recipe.  Very slight modifications for me were 1/2 cup ranch and 1/2 cup blue cheese, wing sauce vice hot sauce and I reserve 1/2 cup cheese and dump the rest all together and then put it in a baking dish and top it with the remaining cheese...and then a little more.  Serve with baked tortilla chips.  This stuff is good and usually gone!

I just made this for the 1st time last night - after binging on it at a baby shower a couple of months ago when I 1st discovered it - & it was so simple to make & flipping delicious. I especially enjoyed the warm, soft cheesy texture of this dip paired with pretzel crisps while my guests also enjoyed with those, pita chips & celery.  I cut the recipe in half & prepared as directed on the stovetop then moved it into my smaller crockpot (which I believe is a 1.5 qt) & topped off with cheese and this amount fit perfectly in that sized crock...

Great starting recipe. Don't have to change a thing - but I do! I use 1 whole rotisserie chicken or 3 chickens breasts. Use equal parts ranch to hot sauce and add 2 tablespoons of butter in the mix and it makes a difference - I am always asked for this recipe and its always the first thing GONE at a party! If you like chicken wings you'll love this. I serve it with sliced baguette as well. YUM!!

My daughter and I make this at least twice a month. I start with 4 boneless skinless breast and boil with celery, baby carrots and garlic. Then I take half the chicken and make chicken'n rice soup and the other half I shred and add to a pan with a block of cream cheese, some ranch dressing (Hidden Valley only...Kraft is nasty), Franks RedHot sauce, sriracha sauce and some additional powdered HV ranch seasoning. We make this different every time and never measure. Sometimes we add some mexican shredded cheese in the mixture but we always add some to the top then bake at 400 until bubbly. We use Ritz crackers or Tostitos. My daughter has yried others that use can chicken and she thinks its very bland. Also the sriracha just kicks it up a notch. This is a wonderful recipe everyone can adjust to their liking.

I have made this several times exactly as the recipe says and it is fantastic.  Today my slow cookers were all being used so I put the dip in a casserole and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes.  Just as delicious.

I used fresh chicken (poached, then shredded) and baked the mixture at 350  for about 20 minutes and it came out excellent!!!! I used reduced fat cream cheese as well. I will definitely make this again and again!

I prefer to use rotisserie chicken breast rather than the canned, it adds another layer of flavor.  This is always a hit at parties and freezes very well.

I've never submitted a review on anything in the 8+ years I've been using this site.  This dip won such rave reviews I had to compliment  NUNPUNCH on this!  I made this for a bunch of folks I'd never met before for a Texas Hold'em night.  They guys all loved it...their only complaint was it wasn't hot (spicy) enough.  So the only thing I will change is the type of cheese I use next time - either a colby jack or a pepper jack!  GREAT RECIPE!!

Amazingly good! Everyone wanted the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was good beyond my expectations. I might try it with cooked chicken next time, but the canned tasted great. We had about 20 people at the party and the dip lasted long enough. Just the right amount for the crowd (with lots of other munchies as well).

Really easy appetizer, but I altered the recipe a bit.  I used less ranch, more cream cheese and more hot sauce.  We love spicy food although it may be a little too spicy if you don't like spicy.  I serve it with parmesan crackers or just normal crackers.

This was amazing!  Canned chicken at the grocery store was almost $4 a can so I used three cups of cooked, diced chicken and it turned out really well.   I used chive and onion cream cheese and I also added 1/4 cup of crumbled blue cheese and everyone LOVED it!  Definitely a keeper!

I use 2 fresh boneless skinless chicken breast (which I boil and then chop up) instead of the canned chicken. I serve this with tortilla chips and/or pita chips. My boyfriend will eat this cold the next day he loves it so much! Always a big hit when I take it to party!

This was amazing with a couple of tweaks. My family devoured it! I layered this by mixing the chicken with pepper sauce. I didn't measure the sauce. I just added some to the chicken until I got the consistency I wanted. I spread the chicken mixture on top of everything else, then baked. I also served it with tortilla chips instead of crackers.

EDIT: Prepare to have minds blown.  Once a year I will do the following for the Superbowl because it is labor intensive, but AMAZING!

Make the dip per original directions. Then take a small spoonful with a couple slices of green onions and seal in a wonton wrapper and fry.  Best football food EVER!

This is awesome. I really don't like canned meat, so I boiled a pound of chicken tenderloins in a shallow pan with a lid, and then shred them in my kitchen aid mixer. It cooked fast and had a nicer taste and texture. Added it back into the pan and followed the rest of the directions. I prefer to use 1 cup of Red Hot and 2 cups of cheese, but this is good as is too. Huge hit at the party, served with tortilla scoops and celery sticks.

I boil and shred my own chicken breasts, but other than that, follow the recipe exactly.  It's a dip that I crave, and make whenever we have a football game on or a casual get together with friends.  So yummy!

I made this dip for the Superbowl.  My husband loves buffalo chicken wings so I thought this would be a good choice.  It was okay when I first made it.  I put it in a crock pot to keep it warm and by the end of the first quarter it had become way, way, way too salty.  Even when it was freshly made it was just alright, not really good.  I won't make it again.

I used Crystal's brand hots sauce, not Franks, can't stand Frank's.  I also used a freshly grilled chicken breast instead of canned. Just couldn't get myself to use canned chicken. I also used blue cheese dressing instead of Ranch, b/c that is what I prefer with my buffalo chicken. Turned out awesome and everyone really loved it.

Whenever my boyfriend watches a football game I have to make this dip. His friends tell him not to bother coming without it! I use a whole store bought rotisserie chicken for the chicken and use a combo of Frank's and whatever hot sauce I have lying around, the favorite around here being Brook's Wing Sauce. I also use Marie's Super Blue Cheese Dressing and Ranch in equal amounts for the dressing this calls for.

This stuff is soooo good! I met a lady that used to bring this to all parties. I finally asked her for the recipe and she told me it was this one on here. I never would have thought to make a buffalo chicken dip using canned chicken. Most of the others on the site have blue cheese, which is not always popular with a lot of people. This is perfect. I had the large 12oz cans of chicken from Costco. I made a 1/2 recipe and just used one. I mixed up my own ranch dressing with ranch powder and lite sour cream and Hellmans mayo with olive oil. I accidentally measured out 1 cup of a cheddar cheese blend and just used that. I didn't want to wait to set it in the crock pot, so I topped it with cheese and put it in my Nu Wave oven for 8 minutes. This is great with tortilla chips and will be served on Super Bowl. Thank you, so much quicker and easier than making buffalo wings.

This is a good concept but an INCREDIBLE dish if you substitute a finely chopped whole rotissorie chicken use only 1 package of 8 oz cream cheese and 1/2 C ranch and 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing.

5 star with these changes: I used chicken breasts boiled & then shredded instead of canned chicken, I added some butter to chicken in the skillet with the hot sauce. I used 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing & 1/2 cup ranch dressing in place of 1 cup ranch dressing. Tried it with extra hot sauce to make it spicier but it was too salty. Doesn't need to go in slow cooker, I heated it in oven before serving. May need to be reaheated, but it tends to get eaten even if some is left to get cold! Served with tostito scoops.

Awesome! I've made this a bunch of different times and used different combinations of sauces and cheeses and they all come out great. I pick up a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and use the meat from that. Its easier and and adds a nice flavor. Thinly slice up a baguette for dipping.

I have made this about 10 times, and everyone loves it.   Super easy to make as well.   I have a variation below that people seem to like better than the original version.
3 cups shredded chicken   (we buy canned chicken from costco, and break it up with a fork to turn it into shredded chicken)
2 8oz packages of light cream cheese   (we buy the rectangular boxes of hard cream cheese, rather than the soft fluffy expensive creamcheese )
1 cup Ralph's brand [orange coloroed] hot sauce  (buy  from a Ralph's supermarket )  cup ranch dressing  (we used Ken's brand to make entire recipe gluten-free for our nephew)
1 cup cheddar cheese  (we used a bagged Mexican cheese mix, but plain cheddar will work just fine).
Throw all ingredients together in crockpot and heat on low for 3-4 hours (after 2 hours I stirred the stuff to mix up the now warm cream-cheese with everything else).

Serve with tortilla chips or small baguette slices (personally, I liked it better with the baguette slices....but tortilla chips are good to have on hand as a gluten-free option).

I was looking for a COLD dip, not hot, and with a couple alterations, WHALA! I used the cream cheese (softened), ranch dressing, and Franks Red Hot Buffalo sauce. This was perfect to dip chips, pretzels, and veggies. Yum!

I'm almost positive my fiance proposed to me because of this dip. He's mentioned several times that after one bite he was hooked. Since then I've served this dip to various audiences at least 20 times with great results. There is never a bite left and I'm often asked for the recipe. It truly is best with the chicken crackers but I've served it with potato chips, tortilla chips, ritz crackers, and you-name-it. Excellent recipe with life changing results ;)

I have made this recipe for SEVERAL events; holiday party, summer bbq, wedding shower, etc. I have never heard one bad remark, everyone always loves it!! Also quick and easy to make. Not the most budget friendly but you could substitute to make a couple ingredients to make it less expensive. Enjoy :)

Great party dip. I make this with fresh chicken breast and it's always a hit. I've also used Sweet Chili Hot Sauce for a milder flavor.

Great!I substituted 1 bone of boneless breast that I shredded, and 1/2 c of franks red hot, (left out the bottle for people to add more if they desired.)  People LOVED this, and I served it with tostitos scoops. :)   Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried several receipts and this is, by far, the best ever.  I made it for a BBQ being held tomorrow but I've had three servings.  I don't like chips and had it with pretzel crisps.  This is a keeper........

I got rave reviews on this, even from a friend who says she doesn't like cream cheese dips.  I did however more than triple the hot sauce, otherwise it was too creamy and did not have a buffalo kick.  I used Franks Red Hot - Hot Buffalo.  Served with pita chips, which are nice and thick for a heavy dip.

Delicious! Instead of the canned chicken I purchased a supermarket rotisserie chicken and shredded the meat myself (the entire bird). I increased the hot sauce to 1 cup and kept the remaining ingredients the same. It was devoured by 6 people in 20 minutes. Highly recommended!

I've used this recipe for over a year and my kids tell me it's near perfection.  It does require getting the modifications at a Kroger near you.  I use their roasted chicken and shred it off the bones by hand.  For the dressing, I use store brand Lite Southwest Ranch.  I also change out the cheese withthe store brand shredded habanero.  I mix half in the mix and sprinkle half on top.  I also mix some frenches onion chips in the topping.  I use three types of hot sauces...franks regular, store brand extra hot, and a habenero death sauce I picked up at a specialty store.  My kids think I have perfected the heat level.  I read the comment about processed cheese, and I've never had any problem with the store shredded brand.  It might be because I use the whole chicken so it's usually more than 2 cups.  However you make it, this recipe is a keeper.

this was really good. I used blue cheese dressing since it traditionally goes with wings. I used 2 shredded chicken breasts. Since my jar of hot sauce had 1 cup in in I just threw the whole thing in...no point in leaving a tiny bit in the bottom on the jar! Only comment is that next time I would use a little less cream cheese.

Make sure you use a quality name chicken in the can. Some off brands have rib/dark meat in them. Swansons for example is all white breast meat. Made exactly as recipe is written. Very rich, can't eat too much, but very good.

I used the ingredients exactly like the original recipe.  I used fresh shredded cheddar cheese and not the bagged.  I mixed it all together on the stove before putting in the crock pot.  It came out perfectly and was delicious.

This dip was fantastic! I made it for a heavily-male superbowl party, and it was devoured.

The reason I gave it 4-stars is because I changed some things as suggested by fellow raters.

I used 1/2 ranch, 1/2 blue cheese, just standard Marie's dressing. I also used Frank's Hot Sauce- Red Hot, but ended up adding about 1/2 cup more because I wanted some more bite to the dip. Finally, I'm a poor college student, so the closest thing I have to real chicken is the bag of pre-cooked, grilled stuff. I just used that for the chicken, shredded it up and threw it in.

Will definitely make again!

I used a rotisserie chicken and subbed blue cheese for the ranch. Did not bake, instead heated everything n a skillet. Turned out yummy! Everyone liked it. Also, I made it 2 days in advance and it heated up nicely.

WOW!  I used past reviewers suggestions; poached chicken breasts, minced rather than shredded, increase chick and wing sauce quantity, eliminated the cheddar, used full fat bleu cheese in place of the ranch dressing, used low fat cream cheese, increased quantity to compensate for eliminating cheddar and added about 1/3 cup crumbled bleu cheese.  My big mistake?  Baking in the oven after the stove top step.  It changed the texture from creamy to a curdled appearance and caused the wing sauce to appear as pools of red fat on the surface.  Don't bake, use the crockpot or a chafing dish to keep warm. VERY popular dip!

Love this version. Even though blue cheese is the traditional dressing for anything buffalo chicken, I like this better. It's not quite as rich, easier to eat. Also, cannot eat canned meat. Have made with chicken I keep shredded in the freezer or used perdue short cuts.

This is a very easy dish to make! I used some baked chicken and probably ended up with 4 cups of chicken because the sauce was very saucy!

It was a big hit at our Super Bowl party! Good with tortilla chips, celery, triscuits ~ pretty much anything!

This was so rich!  I brought it to a super bowl party and it was barely touched.  My husband said you really can only eat about 5 bites before the cream cheese overtakes you.  Not sure how to make it better....just not our cup of tea.

Everyone loved it! I put in more chicken as suggested by other and I put it more pepper sauce and less ranch dressing (I didn't really measure the two). I dislike buffalo wing, but loved this dip!

This is recipe is delicious if followed as is, but I made it again with a few changes and it was even better. I used 2 12 ounce canned meat cants, 1 pack of cream cheese, 1/2 cup ranch, 1/2 cup blue cheese, 1/4 a cup of franks red hot, 1/4 a cup of Moore's Buffalo Wing Sauce, and 1/4 Choluoa Chili Lime Sauce, 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese and 1/2 a cup mexican mix cheese. This was AWESOME with the changes! I put all the ingredients together in a 350 degree over for 20-25 minutes making sure to stir it occasional and it was fantastic! I think next time i will try to use fresh chicken or a store bought cooked chicken since I think it will taste better! Huge hit though and super easy!

I actually got this recipe off of a walmart TV,, and we tried it. This is a REALLY RICH DIP!!! I mean, almost makes you gag rich. The flavor isn't enough to push past this. The flavor is very mild, and nobody in my family liked it. 
If I were to make it again... it wouldn't even be the same recipe. 
If it's too rich for you (like it was for my family) I suggest taking out the cream cheese  and ranch, and doing just a buffalo chicken cheese dip.  


Be careful.

Delicious recipe! Instead of Frank's Red Hot, I used Sriracha. My uncle is picky when it comes to hot sauces and he said that next I HAVE to make it with Frank's, but for me the sriracha added a more complex flavor to the dip! I served the dip in my fondue pot to keep it warm throughout the football game :) If you don't have a fondue pot, it's a great investment! Don't only have to serve fondue, but dips and even soups work well with it.

This dip is DELICIOUS!! I used only about a 1/2 cup pepper sauce because we don't care much for spicy stuff here and it was perfect. It is great with celery and tortilla chips.We will definitely make this again and again!!

Tasted good, but you can't get authentic "Buffalo" flavor if you use ranch dressing. Authentic buffalo is Blue Cheese and nothing substitutes. Not sure who or where they started using ranch with Buffalo wings but it doesn't work. I also use rotisserie chicken instead of canned, the flavor is much better and can be bought at most grocery stored these days. Gave it 3 stars, would have been 5 if it were called "Spicey Ranch Chicken Dip". So long as it uses ranch dressing, it won't taste "Just Like Buffalo Chicken Wings"

A great standby appetizer for my family.  Works good with canned or fresh cooked chicken breasts. I usually use one block of cream cheese and sometimes dont even use the shredded cheddar, dont miss either. You can easily cut down on the buffalo sauce as needed for sensitive palates. Quick and easy and never any left over.

This recipe is delicious and always a favorite among my friends. However, it is much better when I use a rotisserie chicken and just shred it than canned chicken.

DELICIOUS!  I did added chicken pcs purchased from Costco that many use for salad, I chopped them up and mixed them in .  I too used Blue Cheese dressing and increased it to 1 cup of Frank's Red Hot. This is the third weekend in a row I will make this for my husband and he told me to double up the batch......because it is Super Bowl weekend after all! :-0)

I served this on Christmas eve for my daughter. She loves this appetizer. The only reason it does not get a five-star from me is that I prefer add grill chicken breast, rather than canned chicken.

This is a great recipe for those who like hot foods.  The first time I made it there was just about enough for three crackers left.  Some friends were helping me to clean up,  and took home that little bit of leftovers!!
So easy and so delicious.  I have made it many times since and it always get rave reviews..

AMAZING!! I changed as follows: I boiled 2 large chicken breasts & shredded, then mixed with shredded cheddar cheese and equal parts of Franks Original Hot sauce and Franks Buffalo Wing sauce. Then I layerd in a glass baking dish: cream cheese, chicken mixture, ranch dressing, and topped with remaining shredded cheese. Baked at 375 until hot, then added to a crock pot to keep warm. Serve with hawaiian bread and celery sticks.

Great recipe. I cut the servings in half since it would be just my husband and I eating the dip. I used  a half cup of buffalo chicken sauce instead of pepper sauce.

I would give this 5 stars if it used real chicken!  10 oz. is not enough, either.  After reading reviews and looking at photos, I decided to alter a bit and normally HATE reading reviews when someone hasn't tried the original.  I would think adding liquid ranch could be what is making this too oily for some.  I used ranch powder instead.  Texas Pete's gave it great flavor.  1 lb. chicken, hot sauce, cream cheese (at room temp melts right in), 2 tbsp. ranch powder, 1 cup fine shredded cheddar mixed in and bake with light layer on top.  The only thing I would like to try is adding 1/8-1/4 c. blue cheese crumbles mixed in to the recipe and maybe add some to the cheese mix on the top.  The color didn't bother me since it's buffalo chicken and a lot less messy than the real deal.  Tortilla chips and celery were a hit!  Yum!!

Great recipe. Everyone loved it!  I also used 2 bonless skinless chicken breasts rather than canned meat.  I was lazy and used a food processor rather than shredding the chicken and it turned out ok, but I will not use a food processer to shred the chicken again.  Instead of cheddar, I used 2 cups of the 4 cheese mexican cheese mix and mixxed one cup in the dip, and covered the top with one cup.  Instead of using the slow cooker, I baked in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes (as someone else suggested) in a 13 X 9 glass baking dish.

This dip is delicious, and always a hit!  I use the block cheese instead of shredded as others have suggested and it turns out alot less greasy!  Great suggestion!

This recipe was excellent.  We just used tortilla chips to scoop this dip out.  We also skipped the celery.  It was a great appetizer.

This stuff is great!  A friend brought it to a Christmas party and when she told me what it was, I had to try and make it myself.  
I used 2 (12.5 oz) cans of chicken breast, about 1 1/4 cup of Frank's Hot Sauce (the original), probably about 1 1/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar and since I didn't have ranch, I used about 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup of savory garlic Cookin Creme cheese.  I added garlic powder and some Mrs. Dash to spice it up a bit.  I cooked it on the stove as indicated, then transferred it to an 8x8 metal pan, topped with a bit more cheese and baked for 15 minutes at 350.  It turned out great even without the dressing.

Great Recipe!! The first time we made this at my house, we made the recipe as directed except for boiling and shredding 2-3 chicken breasts, and it was awesome! My hubby usually makes this one!! It has been tweaked a different way every time we make it, ever since our first time. We will sometime use blue-cheese dressing in place of the ranch, and crumbled blue cheese instead of cheddar, or any combination of those...they are all yummy! The only time I had a complaint about any tweaks we've tried was when we tried Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce in it. It ended up too greasy. It seems better to stick to the regular Frank's Red Hot and not the actual Wing Sauce, other than that, I suggest this recipe exactly as it is, or trying other slight variations...you really can't go wrong with it!!

A friend of mine made this dip for a party a few years ago, and I've loved it since!  This recipe is actually a bit healthier than hers, but just as tasty.  I make this for every get-together now!

I just served this at a party and everyone went crazy for it! I took the advice of another poster and boiled chicken breasts rather than using the canned chicken. 3 breasts for about 25 minutes on the stovetop did the trick. Awesome recipe!

Oh my goodness....this was a huge hit.   I followed a few changes.   I do not like canned chicken, so I used chicken from the crock pot (from Allrecipes.com) and shredded.  Could not find Franks so I used Cookies wing and things sauce.  Everything else I followed as per the recipes.  Everyone raved about it.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for posting.

Really Tasty. I used a bit more chicken and used 3/4 cup blue cheese and 1/2 cup ranch. I used 1/2 cup each wing sauce and crystal hot. Also would advise shredding your own cheese and not using the store bagged cheese. It did not come out greasy at all. I put it out at half time with some deep fried shrimp. Make ya wanna slap your mamma!

Made this for a party and everyone raved. I didn't use canned chicken, though. I boiled two chicken breasts and chopped up fine in the food processor and used that. And I shredded my own cheddar cheese, not using pre-shredded since it has a binder on it that keeps it from sticking together in the package and makes melted cheese clump a little.

AAAAHHH!! I have been making this recipe for quite a while but had been making it from a verbal recipe from a friend. Previously all I had was the ingredients list and was told to add them in whatever ratio suited our taste! Therefore it was never exactly the same two times in a row. This recipe is amazing! So addicting! My sister-in-law is convinced it has "crack" in it! :) So glad I have exact measurements now!

Always good and will make again!  Be careful not to burn in the beginning, that happens to me once in awhile and it makes the dip horrible.

Excellent for any party dish! Used shredded colby jack and it was excellent! Also, cooked on 350 in the oven for 20 minutes instead of crock pot. Definitely go with the bleu cheese, even if you're more of a Ranch fan (like I am). It's totally worth it - the dish was gone in mere minutes!

Doubled the recipe.  Made this for a small gathering, leftovers were taken to another and those leftovers were taken to yet another event.  Everyone raved about it.  Used neufchâtel and I could not tell a difference.  Don't think the cheddar cheese was necessary though.  Delicious!

I use blue cheese crumbles instead of ranch, and use rotisserie chicken instead of canned.  Turns out AMAZING!  Always the first thing to go at a party.

Great for game day!  Nice & spicey which I love.  Have never tried Frank's Redhot Pepper sauce before.  It's good.  As the highly recommended reviews state, I used home cooked chix.  I blended 8 oz Neufchatel cheese with blue cheese dressing and another pkg with ranch, then used these for the bottom layer on half of the pan so we had 2 flavors to choose. Yeah Seahawks won 13-10.   c",)

Love it!  This dip is so quick and easy to make and it's always a hit.  I always use all WHITE meat chicken from the can and buy a national brand not store brand.  You can also use fresh cooked chicken but I use the can when making this dish because it's cheaper and easier.

This was okay but not as good as I was hoping. I used boiled chicken and shredded it so maybe next time I will try canned chicken (eek) or use the pre-packaged kind from Perdue.

We make this every time for poker night and it's always a big hit. I love the recipe because it's easily adjusted. If you want it meatier add more chicken, spicier add more Frank's, cheesier add more...well, you get the idea.

i've made buffalo chicken wing dip hundreds of times and I would never make it with canned chicken, I did the first time and it wasn't any where near as good as made with cooked chicken breast. Just cook it up and then shred it, soooo much better. So thats why i only gave it two stars. If made the other way I would give it five.

This dip was fantastic!!! I did not add quite as much franks as the recipe called for, but I did add a few dashes of tabasco with franks. I didnt put in the crock either, just cooked on stove in pan and then transferred to a pretty dip bowl. so good!

Excellent dip.  I couldn't stand the idea of canned chicken so I used fresh chicken breasts, chopped and sauteed in the hot sauce and it didn't take too much longer to prepare.  Good served with flatbread.

I thought this dip was very good and also quick and easy to make. The only change I made was to use rotisserie chicken because I absolutely hate canned meats except or tuna. When I have left over, chicken, I'll make this dip for the family. They love it too. It so nice to have something so simple taste so good.

I doubled this for a party and had a ton left over.  I placed extra dip onto rolled out crescent roll dough (as in making a chicken broccoli braid) and baked it.  This was a real hit with my family and os often a requested meal! I serve this, buffalo chicken braid) with a green salad for a complete meal.  Yum, yum!

This dish is ADDICTING! I took it to a friend's vacation cabin over the 4th, and all the pickiest of eaters devoured this. It kept well on the drive. This is one of those recipes that is so simple to make that it's surprising how delicious it is. It is now fondly called "Chicken Delight" with my friends.
I recommend using Frank's Buffalo Wing Style hot sauce.

This is really good, I'd probably put a little less hot sauce in there as it overpowered the dip but that depends on the brand of hot sauce used.  Served it with celery and tortilla chips.  Made it in a crockpot to keep it hot - but probably prefer to layer it in a dish instead. Next time I'm going to try with ground chicken and will omit the cheddar cheese, not necessary.

I REALLY liked this...but unfortunately, it didnt resonate with my BBQ people. Bummer as I really loved it. Will probably try again...maybe during football season. Did the layering approach....melted the cream cheese and ranch together and poured on the bottom of the pan...then mixed fresh chopped chicken with Franks wing sauce to coat and put it on top. Topped with some blue cheese crumbles.

Try substituting Asian Zing BBQ sauce instead of the Hot Sauce to give this recipe a new twist of spicy tang.  Everyone raves about this variation!  The Asian Zing can be purchased at Buffalo Wilds Wings restaurant.

This was excellent and so easy to make! No baking or slow cooker required - just heat it on the stovetop (less mess and dishes to wash). I used extra buffalo sauce and the canned chicken. Will definitely make again, this stuff is addicting!

I personally used fat free cream cheese and light ranch. Still came out good (I had to mix the cream cheese a little harder though so the chunks would smooth out).
I also used two boneless chicken breasts and boiled them for 20 minutes. Then, I shredded them. It made me feel better that they were fresh and not canned.
I'm not giving it 5 stars because of one factor: It's too salty! If I could find a way of making it way less salty, it would be perfect.

Mm mm good! I used 2/3 fat free, 1/3 low fat cream cheese, fat free ranch, and 2% sharp cheddar and baked the dip between two tortillas, al la quesadillas. Made for a snacky, bar food type dinner without the guilt.

I've made this many times before, but with other recipes.  This recipe is by far the best I've made.  One thing I did differently was I added more Frank's Red Hot Sauce than what the recipe called for, maybe 1/4 cup more.

Very tasty.  It was a hit at the party.  I shredded my own cheese instead of using a pre-shredded as suggested.  There was still a lot of oil separating, very unattractive.  I would suggest not making it too far ahead of time.  The flavor made it worthwhile though.

I will never make this again because I made it for a small get together and had about half leftover and I have eaten it constantly since.... lol. Seriously amazing!!!! the only think i did different was added a little extra hot sauce as we like things spicy and skipped on the exra cheese topping bc it really didn't need it! Will make this often but for larger events or send the leftovers home with someone else so I don't gain 30 lbs from it!! lol. Thanks for sharing!!!!!

This was a big hit with everyone! Instead of pepper sauce I used Tabasco & put it in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes. My friends & family can't wait for me to make it again. They aren't big vegetable lovers so they used tostitos & fritos.

Love, love, love this recipe.  Added 1 cup of diced celery to the mix for a little crunchiness.  After cooking the cream cheese, chicken, celery I divided the amount in half.  One half I added 1/2 cup of Frank's Red Hot sauce and in the other half I added 1 cup of hot sauce.  The milder dish has a thicker consistency than the hotter dish.  Just make sure you mark the hotter dish, so someone doesn't have a bad experience!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This dip is super yummy. I used fat free cream cheese and the Franks Red Hot. I made the mistake of using fat free chedder cheese. NVERVER again if the recipe involves cooking the cheese. The top layer I used it for was inedible. I had to peel it off and it pulled off in one peice. GROSS. I also used a rotisserie chicken . This recipe was best served with celery. The fritos and chicken crackers were TOO salty. It tasted even better cold.

I have been making this dip for years and the only suggestion I have is to only use the half of the cheddar cheese that goes in the dip and not put any on top because no matter what cheese you use it makes it very oily on top.  Awesome recipe.

Great, easy recipe!! I followed the directions exactly except I only used maybe a cup of shredded cheese -  a tiny bit of mild cheddar and the rest was sharp cheddar (I ran out of mild... thought I had more in the fridge).  This is definitely awesome with celery sticks, but I'm sure it'd be awesome w/crackers or tortilla chips as well.  I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. Must use real chicken..not out of the can!  I shred mine.  Sooo much better with blue cheese dressing.  I use Marzettis...other cheaper versions are not as good.  Also make sure you use Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce instead of the regular Franks Hot...Great with Tostitos Scoops!!

I have made this dip over and over again, my children can't get enough of it and now their friends keep requesting me to make it when they come over.  I have made it with both Ranch Dressing and Bleu Cheese dressing at different times.  It's hard to say but,  I think the Bleu Cheese is the best to use.  Everyone really likes it with Tostidos chips or similar kinds.

I make this dip all the time, but instead of using canned chicken, I brown the chicken and cook on med low until done.  This adds so much more flavor to the dip.

Love this dip and so does everyone else! My version is a tad different. I omit the blue cheese dressing as I'm not a big fan of its strong potent flavor, add a packet of dry ranch dressing and a small container of Plain fat free yogurt. I put all ingredients in small crockpot or casserole dish in the oven to melt cheese and warm.  Serving with celery and chicken flavored crackers.thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This dip tastes delicious and is highly addictive. I gave it 4 stars because of my changes. I made my dip with chicken breasts instead of canned chicken. (Canned chicken creeps me out.) I cooked 3 breasts with some water in the slow cooker for ~6 hours. I drained the juice then mashed the chicken is a casserole dish with all the other ingredients, minus the top layer of cheese. I put the casserole in the oven for 25mins, then sprinkled cheese on top and let cook for another ~5 mins. Turned out great!

Very good, on its own I thought it was just okay.  But then I had it with the celery and it deserved the 5 star rating.  Skipped the whole cheese on top and just added it all in.

Love it!  I have made several times and always a hit!  I use a deli roast chicken and pick off and shread and half blue cheese half ranch.  I have made it with fat free cream cheese and don't notice a DIFFERENCE.  I use the regular full fat dressing though.  The low fat versions don't cut it there

I made this for the first time and it was a big hit at the party.  I personally wasn't thrilled with the canned chicken (I had never used it before) and will have to try it again with cooked chicken breasts.  Everyone else thought it was great and I had requests for the recipe!!

Made this for a party awhile back.  At the last party several people asked where the "wing dip" was.  Guess I'll make it for the pool party this evening.  i used a good blue cheese dressing & added hot sauce to taste.  Also used left over chicken.

EXCELLENT! The second time I made this with 2 (not too large) boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I cooked and shredded. I put chopped celery in it too. I used blue cheese instead of ranch and mozzarella instead of cheddar cheese both times as that is what we prefer. I found you could make this on top of the stove, in the oven, in a microwave or in a small crock pot. I would rate this 5 stars no matter how you make it. Really great recipe. Thanks.

This is really good. I just think it may need one other thing with it... Just can't put my finger on that yet.

Best.Appetizer.EVER!!!  Every time I make this, I get asked for the recipe.  People LOVE it.  I alternate ranch dressing or blue cheese, depending on what I have on hand.  Also, I will sometimes bake it in the oven and put some cheese on top and brown it.  Both ways it's delicious!  So glad I found this!  It's a staple in our house for gameday.  Thanks!

I've made several versions of this recipe. This one is my favorite!! I refuse to use canned chicken. So I boiled and shredded 3 chicken breasts. I also use half mozzarella and half mild cheddar. I think using all cheddar makes it a bit too oily. Wonderful!!

I love this recipe.  I don't add the shredded cheese because I don't think it needs it.  I use 1 c. blue cheese dressing, 3/4 c Franks Buffalo sauce and a package of dry ranch dressing seasoning.  It's to die for.  Serve with pretzel chips or carrots...the best!

This is one of my favorite recipes I have found on this site. I prefer a lot more Frank's sauce than called for. I also used half ranch and half blue cheese. It is much better with the combo. I have the whole family hooked! Dip sourdough bread in it too... that is our fam fav.

Instead of canned chicked I boiled 3 chicken breast and shred them. I used added crumbled blue cheese & blue cheese dressing. I liked it, my hubby was iffy. I think its cause the Franks Hot Sauce gives and itchy feeling in your throat. Maybe I need to find one is more subtle yet still spicy.

Good base recipe but I did make some changes to my liking.  Used fresh chicken breasts and blue cheese dressing.  I put everything in the crock pot and heated through on low.  My 7 year old daughter loved this dip!

I too make this recipe with variations, when I make for parties I use two can premium 12.5 oz chicken, a cup and a half of Texas petes, and 3 8 oz cream cheese. When it comes to the dressing i tend to put in the same amount of blue cheese dressing as I do hot sauce. The kicker is a dash of garlic powder. I've had people constantly ask me for the recipe and I've even making a large batch for a christmas party that I am not going to be attending. This dis also works well on quesadillas. FYI.

This stuff is really really good:) I took another person's advice and didn't use the pre-shredded cheese and it worked a lot better, not so oily. I also used a rotisserie chicken from my market's deli instead of canned and it was really good!!

This is one of my favorite things in the whole world! The only thing I do different is less hot sauce...I use 1/4 cup and it's still plenty hot.

This is without a doubt one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. We love this and make it every time we have an excuse to make dip. We use corn chips rather than crackers. Sooooo good!

I omitted the chicken entirely, and instead of ready-made ranch, used a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch with sour cream.  This dip was a HIT!!  I had it warm in a crock pot for the entire evening, and by the end of the night, we had run out of celery and were scraping the bottom of the pot with pretzels!  Yum!

Growing up in NY I have a blue cheese preference for my buffalo wings so I replaced the ranch with low fat blue cheese dressing.  I further reduced the fat of this by using fat free cream cheese and I baked, de-boned and trimmed 4 chicken thighs.  Everyone absolutely LOVED this and I will definitely make it again...but I wouldn't mind a little more Frank's to spice it up!

Very easy! I pouched 3 chicken breasts and shredded it then mixed in a bowl and sprinkled additional cheddar cheese on top. Made in the morning in my crock pot, turned it on 3 hours before party and it was bubbling hot ready to eat. Used low fat cheeses and fat free ranch to save calories and used on 1/2 cup pepper sauce so it was not to hot. Will make again and again!

I have been making this dip for years, everyone who eats it at my house always asks for the recipe before they leave! Here is how I make it though.. I use fresh chicken usually 2-3 boneless skinless breasts, 6oz of buffalo sauce, 6oz ranch dressing, one bar of cream cheese and mozzarella cheese. I shred the chicken and mix it with the cream cheese then mix in the ranch and buffalo sauce then I add in the shredded mozzarella and bake it in the oven for 20 minutes, I put more mozzarella on top and bake it until melted and serve with tortilla chips. I have never tried cheddar cheese in it and don't think I would. I feel like it would give it a kind of odd taste. Also DON'T use canned chicken! I have never even tried it but I really feel like it could NOT be good!

This was much too hot for our taste.  I made it for a family gathering and no one could eat it.  My daughter recommended just drizzling the hot sauce on top.

I tried this at a party this summer and was instantly obsessed, so I made it for a party last night and it turned out perfect! The orange color never bothered me so I mixed it all together (shredded boneless skinless chicken, light cream cheese, light blue cheese dressing, Red Hot, and colby jack) and it was a huge hit. I actually did end up with leftovers, so today I rolled some into tortillas and baked them in the oven - OMG!! Ridiculously good!

Used a honey-jalapeno flavored rotisserie chicken, 3/4 cup ranch and 1/4 cup bleu cheese.  It was tasty and everyone seemed to enjoy it, but the color is not very appealing as far as the presentation of the dish.  Served with chicken-flavored crackers, Frito's and celery.  Majority preferred it with the celery over the crackers/chips.

Made this for a "House Party" that I hosted.  It was a HUGE hit. I used freshly cooked chicken breast and put it all in the crock for a couple of hours.  I also reduced the amount of cheese.  I just sprinkled about 1/2 cup over the top before serving.

I always pick the meat off of leftover roast chicken and keep it in the freezer - this is a great way to use that up if you don't want to use canned.  I use Frank's Red Hot on my wings anyway and it really did well here.  Frito's Scoops are a good dipper, as well as bagel crisps, but don't use anything fragile.

I thought this was soooo good!  I like the flavor of buffalo chicken, but always need a ton of bleu cheese dressing and milk to take the fire out of my mouth.  I made this for a party, mainly for my wing-loving husband.  I thought it was great!!  It had that flavor I love without all the intense heat, which is perfect for me!  Thanks!!

I don't generally give very many recipes a 5 star rating but this one deserves it. It was awesome dip that i will definitely make very soon again. The only change i made to the recipe was to use rotisserie that i shredded rather than canned chicken and i used scoop fritos rather than the chicken crackers. I can't think of anything i would change other than the amount of hot sauce i used if i had some people over that weren't heat lovers like i am. 3/4 cup was perfect for me but id probably lower it to 1/2 cup for my family. It all depends on the hot sauce your using of course. I used Franks Red Hot as the recipe suggested.

This is a great dip recipe and versatile to tweak to ones taste of what they like for 'Buffalo Chicken'.  I usually bake vs using a slow cooker but have done both.  I top with green onions for some color and additional flavor.  The best was adding in crumbled gorgonzola and additionally topping the mixture with pre-cooked crumbled bacon.  Yummo!

This recipe is great...I only gave it four stars because canned chicken is not the way to go. I have always made this with boiled and shredded chicken (one pack of three boneless chicken breasts). No need for a crock pot...everytime I make this it is gone within 20 minutes anyway! I also serve with the scoop tortilla chips instead of crackers - just my preference.

Fabulous!!  My boyfriend and I could not stop eating it.  He said he wanted a little more hot sauce for next time, but I thought it was perfect as written.  He likes his buffalo a little hotter though.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Mmm - so good!  I've received many compliments when I've made it.  I do modify slightly... I prefer using fresh boneless chicken breasts, also a combo of Ranch and Bleu Cheese.  I've found that Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce works well in place of the hot sauce.

Good but not fantastic. The dip looked a little pinkish from the hot sauce. Not sure if that is what scared people from it but it didn't get eaten much at the party.

Not that this recipe needs another good review, but I'm giving it one anyway. This was very, very good. I made it for my daughter's 7th birthday party today and my guests tore it up! I did 1.5 times the recipe, used 5 thin blsl grilled breasts that I shredded, neutschafel, Texas Pete's wing sauce and subbed blue cheese dressing for the ranch. I also crumbled in about 3/4 cup of really good blue cheese and to me that just MADE this. Served with celery, fritos scoops and tortilla chips. (Guests liked it best with the scoops) Will make again.

I have never seen such an outrageous reaction to a simple dip!  Brought this to a bbq; everyone seriously flipped out and searched for "the girl who made The Dip." It was nuts. I baked and shredded 3 chicken breasts.  Cut the cream cheese down to 1.5 blocks, went generous on the bleu cheese and Frank's Red Hot (Buffalo style).  Used low fat options wherever available and shredded a only light layer of cheddar on top. Baked at 375 for 15-20 min.  Perfecto.

This is a KEEPER. Be prepared to give this recipe out to your guessts. I also use blue cheese dressing instead of Ranch. I tried the canned chicken the first time I made this and was very disappointed. I like to get a rotissery chicken and pick the meat off the bone (both dark and white meat) - This is the closest to the real deal in chicken meat for me.  I also use more hot wing sauce. Store bought shredded cheese is oily but melts very well. I can't wait for super bowl to serve this dip with Scopp chips and veggie sticks!!!

a little oily but made some changes and it was DELICIOUS! boiled chicken breasts (2 is good) vs. canned chicken - once boiled just shred with a fork. Much better chicken flavor. We love garlic so I sauteed some garlic with butter then added the hot sauce to blend the flavors..SO GOOD!!  Everyone LOVE it!  =o)

I didn't have any canned chicken, so I boiled 2 chicken breasts, shredded them with forks, and chopped into little pieces. Next time I'll add more hot sauce, but that's just my taste. I'll definitely make this again and cut the recipe in half. Made this for a group of 6 and everyone had seconds, but still had a lot leftover - it's a big recipe. YUM.

We make this all the time and by now I just use 4 chicken breasts, whiz it in the food processer, and  eyeball the measurements on the rest of the ingredients at the last minute (by taste).  Awesome recipe!  We serve it with sliced baguettes or nacho chips, although the chips tend to break when scooping when the dip is cooling.  Keep it warm!!  You can also substitute bleu cheese dressing for the ranch except I prefer ranch!!  So easy to throw together!

Such a great alternative to wings! I'm planning to put it in a pita next time I make it and try it as a sandwhich. I also like it with blue cheese dressing.

Amazing! I have made it several times. Don't use canned chicken. I tried it and it ruined the dip. 2-3 Chicken Breasts boils for 20-30 minutes, shred with a fork. It's so much better! (Also, seriously, go Frank's or go home!)

This was so good.  I used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch (because it goes with wings!) and I melted the ingredients together in a saucepan before transferring to a plastic contrainer to transport to work for a potluck.  It heated up quick and turned out great.  For my own use for the future, I will probably use extra hot sauce and throw in some bleu cheese crumbles.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really like this recipe with a few changes.  I use fresh chicken breast that I cook and season with cayenne pepper.  Then I cut it up using my chopper.  I use 1 cup of Frank's and Blue Cheese Dressing instead of Ranch.  I love to make this for a party while watching football and NASCAR!

I have been making this dip for about 2 years now...it is a staple I keep all the ingredients in the house for! My boys love it, as does everyone any place I have ever taken it to. IF there are any leftovers (like once I think!) my boys like to eat it in a wrap the next day. The only thing I do differently is mix it all together and heat in the oven, not cook it on the stove top.

this recipe is amazing... I used 1/2 cup ranch dressing and 1/2 cup blue cheese... This is my husbands new favorite and he actually asked me to  make it for him for a meal. He took left overs to work...I prefer Frito scoops with it, my husband likes tortilla chips and my daughter likes Chicken in a Biscuit crackers with it...I Will keep this recipe as a family favorite!

Instant hit!!! I made this for a football party and everyone loved it. Instead of chicken crackers I served it with Frito Scoops (celery sticks were not allowed at the party). I also used the baking method. This did make a lot of dip, so for a smaller crowd I'll cut it in half. This is a keeper!!!!

We have been making this dip for years and it is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! We eat it with tortilla chips, and it is actually really good served over a baked potato as well.

When I make this recipe, I cut up about 1/2 cup of celery and add it to the dip. Then you can add more hot sauce and it has a hot and cool taste - just like eating wings! I also recommend using Frank's red hot wing sauce, not the regular red hot. This goes well with tortilla chips or bread as well as crackers!

I have been making this for some time now and love it but I made a few changes.  I only use one brick of cream cheese low fat, instead of ranch dressing I use blue cheese and replace the chedder cheese with mozz cheese and because I am a wimp I cut the pepper sauce back to a half cup.  This is a favorite at parties and is gone quickly. I also serve with crackers and Fritos scoops.

Excellent!!! Quick and Easy.  I made this dip yesterday and used some suggestions I read in other reviews.  I substituted fresh ground chicken (1 pound) for the canned chicken, 1/2 hot sauce and 1/2 Buffalo Wing sauce, 1/2 Ranch and 1/2 Blue cheese dressing, 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and Colby/Monterey Jack shredded cheese instead of cheddar.  I also baked it for 20 minutes.  I'm sure this will become one of my most requested pot luck favorites.

Great recipes!  Always a hit with ranch or blue cheese.  Adapts well to crockpot-use diced or shredded cooked chicken, throw it all in on low and let it go.  Love this recipe!

Awesome dip! I tried this once at my aunt's house and looked for a similar recipe. I made it today for football game day and yum! My bf said it was possibly the best dip he ever had. I used bleu cheese dressing and leftover boneless chicken. Great way to use leftover chicken, too!

Was great! Have fixed it several times and used readers comments to adapt it to taste.  Used 1/2 wing sauce, half hot sauce because my friends don't like it too hot.  Used 1/2 blue cheese, half ranch. So far everyone has loved it!

I made this for my son's birthday party.  It was a huge hit.  I did change it just a little.  I used reduced fat versions of the cream cheese, dressing and the cheese.  Still it was awesome.  Served it with tortilla chips and chunks of french bread. I had guests asking to take some home and for the recipe.  I plan to make this my go to recipe for parties.  DELICIOUS!!!

This is sooo good and addictive!  This can easily be served with tortilla chips too.  That way there is no other flavor distracting from this heavenly dip.  I use Cookies Buffalo Sauce.  I always have the ingredients for this recipe on hand... it come in handy all the time!

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for a while now and had a package of cream cheese I had to use up. I cut the recipe in half because I only had one package of the cream cheese. I also added jalepeno peppers to the mix and it was great. I think next time I will use Frank Buffalo sauce with real shredded chicken and see how that works, but I do not feel this recipe needs to be changed.

I followed some of the suggestions of others by using chicken breasts and blue cheese dressing. I couldn't find the type of buffalo sauce the recipe called for, just used what was at my grocery store but it was SPICY!! So I added 1/2 cup more cheese and 2 to 3 tbsp BBQ sauce. Mixed everything together and  baked in a casserole dish at 350 for 20-25 mins (baking is a must, I tried to microwave it...was gross). Served with Frito's Scoops. THIS WAS A HUGE HIT AT THE PARTY!!!

This was awesome.  Co-workers always make it by just throwing everything in a crockpot and letting it sit for a few hours but I did it just as described.  I'm having a party with about 20 people and should have doubled the recipe,  it's not going to be enough especially with how I know it's going to get eaten!  I put a little more hot sauce in because my hubby likes things spicy.

Wow this was awesome! I love buffalo chicken anything. As some others had mentioned, I couldn't bring myself to use Ranch so I stuck with traditional blue cheese dressing and served it with Tostitos. I was strapped for time so i used canned chicken, which i'm usually not a fan of, but thought it tasted just fine (making it with fresh chicken is too much work for just dip and the hot sauce and blue cheese overpower it anyway). I think it tasted even better after it sat for a little bit. I would suggest maybe adding a little more chicken than this calls for. Took this to a party and got so many compliments!

This dip was the hit of the party! The only things I did differently were use three baked BLSL chicken breasts, instead of the canned chicken, and I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.

What a great recipe. I served it last night @ a jewelry party I hosted and the dip was gone quickly! I would suggest adding another small can of chicken. I used bleu cheese dressing and it was fantastic. This is most definitely a keeper.

Everyone loves this when I make it!  If you have to travel with it, though, see if you can only cook it halfway and then finish cooking it when you arrive.  The oil separates in the hot sauce very quickly and makes it greasy.

Great recipe! I made it for Easter Sunday and I was asked to bring the dip for a bridal shower the following week.  I substitute cooked chicken breast for the canned chicken. I mixed 1/2 ranch and 1/2 blue cheese dressing. I added more of  the hot sauce.  I never added the cheese, the extra fat was never missed.

Have never made this recipe as is because Ranch dressing did not make sense to me if it's supposed to taste like chicken wings.  I used a good quality Blue Cheese dressing, boiled 1lb. boneless chicken breasts then diced them, and I use Frank's X-tra hot sauce. This is also good served with pita wedges.

This recipe is great! I made it for the Super  Bowl and everyone (even the picky eaters in our family) loved it! Great for using up left over roasted chicken. For a healthier version serve with carrots and celery sticks to dip.

I made this for the Superbowl and it was superb.  I had read other reviews prior to making it.  Many suggested to cut in half because it made so much.  It was gone quickly so I had to go back and make more.  Dont believe them, make the entire batch, as it WILL get eaten.  I did cut the spice almost in half and it was still perfect!

This is my favorite dip ever! I make it easier on myself by dumping all the ingredients in my crock pot and let it do the cooking. Just be sure you rinse off the chicken before you use it.

Was very VERY good.  A little rich for me but that's good so I just had a few bites that I enjoyed IMMENSELY!! :0) I added extra hot-sauce because I love my heat... but it wasn't necessary.  For anyone else who's tempted to add more just try what the recipe calls for 1st is my advice! :0) It was still delicious but a little bit TOO much (which I thought was impossible... haha. Hence the temptation to add more!!)

Very good recipe. I used blue cheese instead of ranch. Great with almost anything you dip in.

Very good.  I followed the advice of many...I used 1/2c ranch and 1/2c blue cheese.  I also cut down on the buffalo sauce and added original red hot as the buffalo sauce was not spicy enough.  I used rotisserie chicken and added some celery.

This was a *favorite* at our New Year's Party.  I cooked 2 chicken breasts, used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and Hidden Valley Ranch dressing made with light mayo.  I used the chicken flavored crackers, but I would also get tortilla chips to go with this.  This was not too hot, I would not recommend cutting back on the hot sauce.  You couldn't tell the cream cheese was light either.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe tasted great but I had trouble with it getting oily/greasy on the top after standing the crock pot for more than 15 minutes.  The only changes I made to the recipe were that I used leftover chicken from an oven roaster instead of canned, and I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  Followed everything else exactly, and I don't think either of those changes would have affected the texture much.  It tasted great but I was a little embarassed when I uncovered my crock pot at a party that I took this too and saw it looking so gross with pools of oil on the top - some people were hesistant to try it because of how it looked.  Oh and no amount of mixing would make it go away!  Gotta find a way to fix this before making it again.  It also seemed that the longer that it was in the crock pot, the worse that it got - so I'd recommend either making in the oven and serving immediately or serving in a setting where it will be eaten quickly and not left in the crock pot for a long time.  I deduct one star only because of the greasiness and appearance - taste was wonderful.

I LOVE this dip and it always gets gobbled up at parties!  I have a slightly different version.  I shred two baked chicken breasts, add 4 oz. hot wing sauce, 4 oz. ranch dressing, 4 oz. blue cheese crumbles, 8 oz. cream cheese and 4 oz. of shredded cheddar.  I reserve a bit of the cheddar to add to the top.  I mix it all together, put it in a baking dish, top with remaining cheddar and bake for 30 minutes.  I serve mine with tortilla chips.  Yummy!

This dip is WONDERFUL!  I took it to a party and it was the biggest hit. The only changes I made was using Marie's Super Blue Cheese dressing instead of ranch and I added some extra Red Hot sauce.  It has become my new go-to dip.

I made the recipe as written. I'm sure it would be better with rotisserie chicken, but I won't bother trying because the overall flavor just wasn't that good. I’m glad I halved the recipe. The leftovers will probably end up in the garbage.

Even with a few healthy substitutions, this recipe was rich and creamy with a great flavor and nice kick.  Used Fat free cream cheese and only 1/2 cup of reduced fat cheddar cheese.

This recipe is very good as written.  I usually bake mine because its easier for me.  I have made this recipe w/ canned chicken and w/ a real breast of chicken that I boiled and shredded.  Hands down the boiled chicken is better.  A little more work, but well worth it.  I also added a little garlic powder and cayenne pepper.

Mmm!  Delicious!  Made exactly as written except I put it in the oven until bubbly.  Very good party dip.  Served with tortilla chips, only because husband doesn't like the chicken crackers.

This was a bit hit @ social gatherings.  I added 1 cup sour cream and some cilantro.  I used Texas Pete Buffalo Wing Sauce instead of Frank's and used tortilla chips instead of crackers....yummy!

I made this for a BBQ dinner party and everyone went crazy over it, people were even putting it on their burgers!! I made a few changes that make all the difference. First off, I did not use canned chicken, instead I sprinkled 1 lb. of chicken tenders with garlic powder, salt, and pepper and cooked in a little bit of vegetable oil. Once the chicken cooled, I shredded it into a pot and cooked with Frank's Buffalo sauce. I would suggest 1/2 c. ranch and 1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing and no cheddar cheese because it makes the dip oily. Also, instead of cooking this in the crockpot, I transferred the dip to a baking dish and baked for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. I served with celery stick and tortilla chips.

This is a big hit at parties. The only changes I make are to switch Blue Cheese for Ranch and omit the cheddar completely. The cheddar didn't seem to add much to the dish, it just seemed greasy.  And honestly, who eats real chicken wings with cheddar anyway?

We love this one.  Every where I have taken it everybody raves about it.  I do reduce the ranch dressing to 1/2 c, as I don't like that much ranch flavor.  I also don't cook it on the stove top.  I blend the cream cheese together and then slowly incorporate the ranch and hot sauce then pour over the chicken and cheese in a 9 x 13 pan mix well and top with a little more cheese and then bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes or until bubbly.  Love it - will continue to make it for many years to come!

I just made this for my college graduation party and it was amazing! It was gone in an hour! After reading reviews, I used grilled chicken breast but I did 1/2 grilled chicken breast shredded and 1/2 Perdue  fresh cuts( its what I had in the fridge) I also used Blue Cheese instead of ranch, it was great! People were asking for the recipe all night, Thank you! Update: I've made this so many times, people always rave about it! I use 3/4 cup blue cheese and 1/4 cup ranch.

It was great!  I used 3/4 cup blue cheese and 1/4 cup ranch, layered it, sprinkled some garlic salt over the cheese on top and baked it till it was bubbly and brown (I didn't want to use my crock pot).  It turned out so good!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Guys LOVE this recipe! Bring it to a football party and you will be the hit of the party. I also modify the recipe by using fresh chicken and shredding it. I also like to layer the ingredients, and then bake it in the oven.

This was fantastic!  I don't use can chicken, so I used skinless, boneless chicken and chopped it.  My son has bragged about a Buffalo dip that his friend's mom makes so I thought I'd try it...We took it to a friends house and my son sid it was better than his friend's mom made!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This appetizer is soooo good and everyone loves it!!  I like to cook chicken breasts in the crock pot before hand so that the chicken is really moist and delicious. I always add extra hot sauce, but we like it mui caliente!

I used blue cheese in place of the ranch and it came out superbly. Everyone kept saying "This tastes just like chicken wings w/blue cheese". I sprinkled a very light coating of the cheese atop the dip before putting in the oven. It didn't have a greasy look but I think you could omit the cheese entirely and have it come out even better.

People loved this dip.  I made it as-stated, except I doubled it and used 4 6-oz bags of Tyson pre-cooked chicken breast strips (not canned).  I also used less than a cup of cheddar cheese, mixed in.  Everything else was exact for a doubled recipe.  I think doubling it was too much for a small Superbowl party, because it was such a heavy and salty dip.  Best to leave people wanting more.  Also, the dipper of choice was Fritos scoops (yum!) or celery.  The chicken in a biscuit crackers made this just too over-the-top salty.  I would make this again.

I made this for a party yesterday, and I brought nearly the whole dish back home. No one enjoyed it, even those who love "wings". I will say it smelled awesome while it was cooking...that's all the good I can say about it. Very disappointing :(

This was so good, everyone loved it at the super bowl party!  The only change I made was to use cooked chicken breast that I shredded, about two breasts.  Great with the celery and the crackers.  My husband mixed it in with his chili and loved it, that didn't sound good to me but he swears it was great.

I made this by mixing shredded chicken breasts with Franks Red Hot Sauce, pouring the melted cream cheese/ranch mixture on top and sprinkling with cheese. I omitted the celery as my boyfriend is an avid non-veggie eater, but it was still awesome!

All my company LOVED it and are already dying to get me to make it again.

HAH!  I made this this morning for my husband to take to work - Super Bowl Snack Day.  One hour later, he's e-mailing me because EVERYONE wants the recipe!  Definitely a keeper!  I did take some other reviewers' suggestions.  I used half Ranch and half Blue Cheese dressing, used cooked shredded chicken, and I used Texas Pete's Wing Sauce and sharp cheddar cheese.  I baked it in the oven for about 30 minutes until it was bubbly, and served it with Aldis brand "Entertainment Crackers" and celery sticks.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Can't wait to make it again!  The only thing I might do differently is add a bit more chicken.  Other than that, it was perfect.

I was looking for a delicious buffalo chicken dip I was served at a party recently.  I found the smell of this dish to be slightly unpleasant. Maybe the canned chicken?  I did try to use half bleu cheese dressing, but it did not yield satisfactory results.  Next time I will use fresh chicken,and bleu cheese crumbles instead of dressing altogether. Other than that, I did enjoy the taste reminiscent of hot wings, but the cheddar cheese on top also made it difficult to use tortilla chips.

Huge hit twice now! Great advice on layering ingredients for nicer presentation. I used the blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, very yummy. Make sure it's bubbly and heated all the way through or the cream cheese layer is thick and over powering. The second time I made this I grilled nearly 2# boneless chicken breast and chopped them up. We liked the recipe better with MORE chicken.

This is really really yummy!!! I used boneless chicken breasts and boiled them. Canned chicken didn't sound very appetizing to me! And when I put the cheese on top (in the slow cooker) it didn't melt well and looked like plastic...I actually peeled it off. But the dip was fantastic!!! It's really good with wheat thins.

I made this dip for a party and everyone devoured it. I baked a couple chicken breasts and used that instead of canned chicken. I softened the cream cheese and mixed everything in a pyrex dish and left cold until party time. Then I baked it in the oven at 375 until hot stirring a few times. It was easier to travel with cold.

I used fresh cooked chicken breast and
shreded when cooled.  I used 1/2 cup of
blue cheese and 1/2 of ranch.  Served 1/2
of the dip hot and 1/2 cold.  Both bowls were emptied at almost the same time. I will use this again.  Easy and my guests
loved it.  Only next time I'll make more.

Oh lord.  This was so salty I couldn't serve it.  I used some blue cheese and some cheddar (as suggested by one user) and it ended up smelling really unsavory.  Worst recipe EVER.

After eight hundred reviews I don't know how much more I can add except to say that this is a dish best served with the ingredients layered and in a crock pot so it all stays melty.  Maybe I'll add a little diced raw celery for some crunch next time.  This was REALLY good!!!  Rave reviews at last night's New Year's party. :)

I make this all the time, But I use fresh chicken and blue cheese not ranch, It is to die for and you cant just have one. lol But everyone loves it.And insted of adding the cheese on top cause that is what makes it look nasty. I add it altogther and it taset better and has less grease. I hope you guy enjoy it I know we all do!

This is a good base for this recipe, but I have made a few adjustments.  Instead of canned chicken, I "Forman" grilled Adobo seasoned chicken tenders. Once done I shred up the chicken and add non-fat ranch dressing, low-fat cream cheese (for a healthier version), hot sauce and cheddar cheese as usual.  My husband loves this recipe on a sandwich roll while watching football.

WOW!  I can't wait to make this for the next football game.  I was hesitant to add the canned chicken but tastes great.  I'm not a ranch dressing fan but still loved it.  I used fat free cream cheese and 2% colby shredded cheese.  My daughter even loved it.  The bad part was that I discovered that I don't have any celery but hasn't stopped me from eating it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this for Christmas.  This is very easy to make.  I made a few substitutions, starting w/the fact that I used 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of canned chicken due to personal preference.  Then I shredded the chicken using 2 forks per breast until it was finely shredded (mind you, after it was boiled!), then I added 1 tbsp. of garlic pepper, and used Frank's Buffalo wing sauce instead of the standard hot sauce.  I was told by a few people that this was the best dip they ever had!!!

Love this recipe!  I used both Ranch and Chucky Blue Cheese as well as a 16 ounce bottle of Frank's Buffalo Chicken Sauce.
I will cook chicken breasts instead of the Tyson Chunk Chicken (smells like cat food).
Used celery and Chicken in a Biskit crackers....a real hit!

This is great!  If you are a true "Buffalo" lover you will use Blue Cheese instead of Ranch though!  I reccommend dressings from the refrigerated produce section - they are 10x better!

i made this dip for a christmas eve get together with my family and everyone wanted the recipe. it was so good and quick for a party. i don't transfer this to a slow cooker i just let it sit in a covered pot for about 10 minutes until the cheese is all melted. also so it's not so chunky when you put the chicken and hot sauce in the pan break up the chicken a little bit that way it's more of a dip instead of a topping. people are now telling me that i need to bring it to the new years eve party lol. great recipe thanks for sharing. I re-made this recipe for new years but i made it a layered dip. I would not recommend it. no one at any of it because it tasted funny. if you are going to make this def go with the dip style not the layering.

GREAT dip.  My teeny Crock-Pot kept it warm and delicious.  "Tostitos" chips were really yummy with it.  :-)

This dip was a big hit at my Christmas party this year! It makes a good bit, so it's excellent for a large crowd.  I cut back to 1/2 cup on the hot sauce (store brand-not Frank's), and it was just enough heat...not so overwhelming. I mixed everything together (including all of the cheese), put it in a casserole dish, and baked it at 350 for about 35-40 minutes.  Kept it warm in a chafing dish and served with tortilla chips, pita chips, and assorted crackers. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was good!!! If you like buffalo chicken wings then this is the dip for you!  I followed the recipe but exchanged the ranch for blue cheese dressing.  I served with scoop Frito's and sliced celery. I used low fat cream cheese and the oil separation other users found did not occur.

Great recipe. Everybody loves it!

I did it with:
2 cans 10 oz chicken chunks (white meat only)
1 cup frank's WING sauce
2 cups HOT PEPPER cheese, shredded
1 cup SPICY RANCH
2 8 oz. sticks of cream cheese
1/5 stick of butter/margarine

I put the chicken (well-drained) into a small skillet with a bit of butter, then added the sauce and cooked on medium high for 5-6 minutes.

At the same time, I microwaved the cream cheese for 2 minutes in the same measuring cup I had used for the sauce. Then I put the cream cheese in a round glass baking dish and mixed in the ranch. I mixed in 1 cup of shredded cheese, then poured the chicken and sauce on top. I put the rest of the cheese on top of that, then crumbled a handful of ritz toasted chips (southwest ranch flavor) on top. I covered the dish and baked at 350 for 23 minutes. 

Served with ritz toasted chips (southwest ranch) and chicken 'n' biscuit crackers.

I was very excited about making this dip, we love buffalo wings and the recipe has gotten rave reviews.  But we did not care for it!  I made it for a party and there were 14 of us who did not like it!  I made it exactly as the recipe says, so my finished product couldn't have been that different from everyone else's.  I think it may be too much hot sauce as some other reviewers have mentioned because it tasted like creamy vinegar.  I won't be experimenting to make it work, I don't think it would be worth it.

This dip was amazing! I only used one packaged of cream cheese, cut down the ranch and spread it on the bottom of a 9x9 pan. I boiled chicken breast in chicken stock and a little hot sauce for about 40 min until tender. I then shredded the chicken and mixed in Wing Sauce rather than pepper sauce. I spread it over the cream cheese mixture and topped it with Monteray Jack and Cheddar cheese. I popped it in the oven for about 25 min. until golden brown and bubbly. Everyone loved it! And it wasn't too spicey, the ranch and cream cheese was a great offset. My boyfriend, who hates anything spicey, was the biggest fan of all! This is now on my "best recipes" list!

This dip is fabulous!  My husband and I love it and often bring it to friend's homes for football Sundays :)  I always receive many compliments.  We make ours on the stovetop, then pour it in a baking dish and bake it for about 10 minutes at 350 just to melt the cheese on top...we also use buffalo wing sauce instead of the pepper sauce.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This is the best dip I have made in years.  I prepared it and transported it to a Trivia Night Event for charity and the folks at the table went face-down into the dip.  We used corn chips and crackers -- I liked the crackers best.  TRY THIS ONE!

This is a favorite of mine.  I make it all the time - probably more than I should but I end up craving it.  I used Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce, 1/2c blue cheese and 1/2c ranch dressing and added some red dye for color.  I eat it with tostidos scoops and it's completely addictive!

I made this to bring to a Halloween party and I was acosted by the hostess when she saw me packing up the crock pot and remaining dip at the end of the night.  I got so many recipe requests after everyone found out I brought this dip.  It's so simple to make and the ingredients are inexpensive.  I do wholeheartedly recommend cooking your own chicken and shredding it for the dip instead of using canned chicken.  I also used Ritz crackers, as the Chicken in a Biscuit crackers were too salty and crumbly.  Great party food!

I agree with most everyone else. Use fresh chicken as opposed to canned. I also layer the ingredients then bake it. Cream cheese mixed witht he blue cheese. then the chicken mixed with some hot sauce (depending on your heat taste) and some of the cheese. then sprinkle with the rest of the cheese. I also put a little crumbly blue cheese and sprinkle it on top on top. It's always a hit!

The only changes I made were: I used shredded chicken instead of can. I also used 1 cup of hot sauce, 3/4 cut of ranch and 1/4 cup blue cheese.

It came out wonderful.

I made this before also, but with all fat free ingredients. I would not recommend it. The cheeses did not melt properly. Even though it tasted good.

Simply delicious, I did open a can of chicken but decided it looked like cat food, so decided to go with a chicken breast roasted and then whizzed in the food processer, this dip simply is gorgeous...

I have made this again and again and frequently get comments on how it is the most delicious dip..

Instead of ranch, try the same amount of Blue Cheese dressing.  Either way, this is a real winner!

This recipe ROCKS! I took it to a Halloween party a few years ago, and now I can't show up around that crowd without it. Always requested, and easy to double or half. I always use fresh boiled, shredded chicken breasts instead of canned as well, and a bit more cheese than called for, so it's nice and gooey. I have passed this recipe on whenever I've taken it somewhere.

This dip is always a hit!  I make mine slightly different though - first I use fat free blue cheese dressing instead of rance and then I just mix everything together and spread it into a baking pan and bake for 20-25 minutes on 350.  It turns out great every time!!

This is a good one...the last time I made it during a family get together, it literally lasted only 4 minutes.  I don't use canned chicken..I usually boil uncooked chicken so it pulls apart easily, or I use leftover chicken.  Don't try to make it "healthy" with non fat cream cheese, ranch, etc.  I did this for someone and it's not the same...it is perfect in it's most fattening form :).  Also, kids won't touch it as it is nice and spicy...more for us adults.  I choose to bake it at 350 for 25 or so minutes, but I think I'll try the skillet method next time around.

This hit the spot! I am a die-hard wing lover, and I plan to whip this out whenever the craving kicks in! I used 2 of the small bottles of Frank's (I like it hot and am amazed at how much this sauce tastes like wings!)- shredded an entire rotisserie chicken from Sam's to use - skipped the cheese, served with Frito Scoops, Chicken in a Biscuit (?) crackers and chunks of celery - made two pie plates of it, since it makes so much and cools off quickly. As others pointed out, not the prettiest thing to look at, but outstanding and simple!

This is awesome!!! Very addicting. I made it as recipe stated. It was so good. I made it when my boyfriend and I were not all that hungry, I just wanted to cook something up, and when it was done we started eating it and couldn't stop eating it. It is like eating buffalo wings but with a different twist, it was a nice change! Awesome recipe!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe for a get together with friends.  I did not use the canned chicken, instead I shredded 1 1/2 lbs. of chicken breast, it was wonderful!  Everyone loved it, and once they started eating it they did not stop.  I am sure there will be several requests for this in the future!

Wow - great! Like this dip needs another rave review. Pretty darn terrific and it does tastes like buffalo wings. Like some other reviewers suggested, I did not add the cheese. I totally agree it is not needed as it is so creamy and rich anyway. Surprisingly, I liked it better with celery than crackers, but that is how I eat my wings so I guess that makes sense. Thank you for a new addition to my old and boring dip collection. UPDATE: Someone in an earlier review commented on how her quests asked if this was tuna. Well, we just tried some of the leftovers cold from the refrigerator and it tasted more like tuna than buffalo chicken. We didn't like it nearly as much. Very weird. Maybe is has to do with the chicken being canned like tuna. In the future we will either eat it warm as recommended or I might try it with chicken that didn't come out of a can.

This recipe is to die for! If you like Buffalo wings you will love this. It's very rich so I don't make it often, but when I do, it goes fast. Perfect with Scoops tortilla chips. A Super Bowl "must".

I love everything with buffalo flavoring and this was no exception.  I used fried chicken from the grocery store.  I had to give the recipe out twice at the party we went to.  The appearance wasn't exactly pleasant and as it cooled down, the grease would gather on the top - not so nice.

I've made this several times and it's just simply the best. First, let me tell anyone, you HAVE to use the canned chicken. For those who didn't, no wonder you didn't like it. I serve it with a veggie tray and various crackers and it doesn't last long. Enjoy!

This is my all-time favorite party recipe!  I don't make it in a slow cooker; I just put it in a casserole dish and bake it on 325 until it's hot and bubbly.  This is a definite crowd pleaser and a must for any get together.

I am updating a previous review I did on this recipe.  I originally used blue cheese instead of ranch, and everything clumped.  I later found out it clumped because of the blue cheese, so I made it again and used ranch, as the recipe calls for.  Wow, it really made all the difference.  I made this recently for a 6 year olds birthday party (for the adults, of course) and it was such a hit.

Wow!!!  Made this for Super Bowl party.  Everybody loved it.  The only thing I changed was I boiled 2 chicken breasts instead of using canned.  Really easy with just the right amount of kick.

I used to pre-make it in a saucepan but it isn't necessary an even easier way is spread 8 oz cream cheese at bottom of pan, layer with 1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce, 1/2 cup blue cheese and then 10 oz of canned chix, top with 1 1/2 cups cheese and bake for 20-25 minutes at 350.

Wow, this was quite a hit at the Superbowl part!  There were about 40 people at the party and almost everyone commented on how much they liked this dip.  I even had to give out the recipe several times because the wives said that their husbands insist that they learn how to make this.  The only changes I made were to use 3 chicken breasts (boiled then shredded), 1/2 cup ranch and 1/2 cup bleu cheese, and no cheddar cheese.  I even had the cheddar cheese in the refrigerator, but I really did not think that the dip needed it because it was so rich already.  The dip did not turn greasy AT ALL.  Maybe this is because I didn't use any cheddar.  I will definitely be making this for my next get-together!

This is a great recipe for parties, or even to have a snack to nibble on.  I use fresh chicken breasts instead of the canned.  Also used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch, and Frank's makes a buffalo wild wing hot sauce that is excellent to use instead of the original hot sauce.  everyone that tries this dish loves it and asks for the recipe.  it is so easy and quick!

The first time I made this recipe it was the first crock pot that was empty and now it is brought to every party we go to whether I make it or someone else does!  I sometimes use  Hooter's Hot Wing Sauce in place of the hot sauce WOW!!!

Everytime we make this we have to give a small explination, but once that is done, there is NEVER anything left!  I've found it's even really good cold.  I usually use half the cheese is calls for and use fat free cheese, low fat cream cheese, and low fat blue cheese instead to reduce the greese.  We also increase the hot sauce to almost double and add a habenero extract because it's not usually hot enough for us...also, we tend to serve it with tortilla chips...thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!

Phenomenal. I think the only change I made was to use cooked, shredded chicken rather than canned. Everyone raved over this dip! It's a keeper! Also good with tortilla chips.

This is very good.  I put it in my mini crock pot and the longer it sits the better the flavor. I do not like canned chicken but this works great with cut up leftover chicken breasts.  Also I did it without the chedder cheese since it did not really need it and I have never had chicken wings with cheese!  Yummy!

Delicious!  Made a couple changes based on other reviews.  Used 1/2 Blue Cheese, 1/2 Ranch Dressing.  Used chopped, boiled chicken breasts.  I didn't want to bother with the crock pot so I made the dip ahead of time and warmed in the oven at 325 for 30 minutes before serving.

This sounded better than it was.....it was really good, but I would even make it spicier.  I might use cooked chicken breast instead of canned chicken next time.  Good recipe!

This was great!  A friend of mine actually recommended it to me.  The only thing I did differently was use 2 cups of shredded chicken breast.  I also added half of the cheese to the top of the dish.

Scrumptious!  I also used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and boiled 3 chicken breasts instead of canned meat.  I mixed everything on the stove except the Cheddar and then put in a pan with the cheese on top and baked for 20 minutes.  I took this to a CHRISTmas party and it was gobbled up!

I have made this recipes a number of times and get great reviews from all who try it.  I usually do 1/2 ranch dressing and 1/2 blue cheese dressing and omit the cheddar cheese but add blue cheese crumbles.  To make it super simple I purchase 2 - 3 fried chicken breasts at the deli section of the supermarket, remove the crispy skin and bones, then chop up the meat into small pieces.  I think that the fresh meat tastes better than canned which I tried once.  I find that I like it best with celery and go through two whole stocks each time I serve it.  I usually serve it in a mini crock pot to keep it warm, but be sure and watch that it doesn't over cook and you'll need to stir it once in a while.  Thanks for this tasty recipe.

I've made this for several parties and it's a hit everytime.  It doesn't look the prettiest, but tastes great with tortilla chips.  I usually use shredded chicken that is cooked in a crockpot with a can of chipotle peppers.  You can then chop up some of the peppers with the chicken for some added flavor.  Using lower fat cream cheese and ranch help a little with the nutritional numbers and you can't taste the difference.  Mini crockpots work great for keeping the dip warm during the party.

This is a delicious recipe. Instead of canned chicken chunks, I boiled chicken tenders and put them in a food processor for a few seconds. I served it with tortilla chips.

I don't like to give low ratings, but I didn't feel like I had a choice with this.  If you like grease, you will like this.  I don't know if I did anything wrong (I followed the recipe as written), but it looked like a big bowl of orange fat.  Perhaps a low-fat cheese would help remedy that.  The flavor is pretty good, but I couldn't get past the grease, sorry.

I make this all the time, I cook on the stovetop and then spread in a 9x13 pan to bake because it goes so fast there's no need for a crock.  I also add extra chicken.  I have always served it with Fritos Scoops and celery.

This is a huge family favorite in my house.  We make it for every party and every football game!  If it is too spicey cut back on the hot sauce.  I also skip the slowcooker and just pour the dip into a pie dish and bake it at 350 for 10 min. to melt the cheese.

I have made this recipe before, prior to seeing it posted on this website. I use blue cheese instead of ranch (that is the Buffalo way...) Canned chicken works great, however so does leftover cooked chicken.

Very easy to make!  I kept the ingredients exactly the same, but since I don't have a small crock pot (only a very large one), I just cooked it all together in a sauce pan.  I thought it was very good!  If I make it again, I'll add more chicken.  My husband, who loves Buffalo Wings, did not like it.  He didn't like it before he even tasted it because he thought it sounded weird.  He thinks Buffalo Wing sauce should only be on wings, so he already had his mind made up.  But I loved it!  It's pretty rich, so I couldn't eat too much, though.

This is one of the best dips I have ever tasted. It really does taste like a chicken wing. I made this first at Christmas, but it has been a favorite at several gatherings since.
UPDATE: Try letting this cool and wrapping in tortillas. The cut into 1" sections for spicy roll-ups! Easier to take to gatherings this way than in the crock pot.

This is the BEST dip ever. I use Blue Cheese dressing instead of Ranch. I had the problem of it separating until I stopped cooking it so long. Just heat it till it is warm throughout and all the cheeses are melted. Also very good with Ritz chips (not crackers). I never have any leftovers.

Holy mother of god was this good! I used 6ozs of cream cheese and half a bottle of Hooters wing sauce and a cup of Lite House blue cheese dressing...the best out there! Even those who don't like spicy said it was good.

Delicious! I made this for a party last night and everyone loved it. It tastes like delicious Buffalo wings without the mess. I used much more hot sauce than required, because I like my food hot. I boiled a few boneless, skinless breasts instead of canned chicken. I also mixed in blue cheese crumbles and put a few crumbles on top. I served with celery and the large sized Wheat Thins. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

This is a great recipe that I have made many times for parties. It is always a hit!! I always use fresh chicken breast cooked and diced instead of canned though.

I can't exactly rate this recipe, because I haven't tried it with this cooking method, but the ingredients are almost identical to the one that I use, quite frequently.  I do cook my own chciken, rather than use the canned as instructed, but maybe in a pinch I would try the canned.  I do like the idea of combining the chicken with the hot sauce prior to mixing it all together.  Maybe next time I'll try that.  I use blue cheese dressing, rather than ranch - my recipe says "either, or."  My recipe combines all of the ingredients and putting in a baking dish, then baking the mixture for about 20-30 minutes at 350 degrees, or until sharp cheese is melted.  It doesn't call for putting an extra layer of cheese on top.  Before serving though, I sprinkle a layer of chopped fresh celery on the top of the baked dip, just to give that final "buffalo wing" touch, and serve it with tortilla chips, although wheat thins work nicely, too.  I have also, on occasion, just placed a bowl of the chopped celery alongside, for those that want it.  Its a wonderful dip that gets rave reviews, and it sure does satisfy that "buffalo wing" craving, with a lot less mess.  Hot sauce, of course can be added to suit your heat tolerance, and any of the wing sauces work.

This dip was easy and tasted great, whether it was hot or cold.  Baking it seemed to fluff it up a bit, so it seemed a little creamier when baked.  I made it with boiled chicken breast which I shredded before adding.  It was great served with celery and tortilla chips.

I made this dip for Christmas and it was a big hit.  I did use the blue chees dressing instead of the ranch, ommitted the  cheddar cheese on top, and added extra crumbled blue cheese to the dip.  I used Buffalo Wild Wings "Hot" buffalo sauce instead of the Frank's red hot.  I served it with tortilla chips and celery.  I am making it for a baby shower in a few weeks as I have a few carb conscience guests attending.

Great recipe idea - but all of the suggested adjustments by others make it just right.  I used 3 boiled chicken breasts, hot sauce per recipe, 2 low fat cream cheeses, and chunky blue cheese dressing. No extra cheese.  Served it with celery, tortilla chips, and crackers - not sure which would go best.  The celery won by far and I preferred it too.

My husband and I took this dip to a New Years Party and everybody loved it.  The next day we both regretted leaving the leftovers at the hosts' house.  We will be making this again for sure, and next time around I may susbstitute the blue cheese dressing for the ranch.  Yum.  Thanks for the recipe.

AWESOME!!! A big hit after football games! We used 1/2 Emeril's Wing Sauce and 1/2 Emeril's Red Pepper sauce instead of the hot pepper sauce. And I like to cook boneless, skinless chicken breasts-then shred in food processeor-rather than the already cooked chicken. Have made MANY times, ALWAYS a hit!!!!

I use fresh chicken and boil it until it shreds.  I replace the ranch with Bleu Cheese Dressing and leave off the cheddar cheese.  I serve with Fritos scoops.  I can't take this somewhere and bring any back home with me!  It is a giant hit!

Sorry, but this tastes nothing like buffalo wings.  The only change i made was to use blue cheese dressing in place of the ranch because my husband prefers it.  Guests kept saying it was okay, however nobody ate any after their initial taste.  Waste of ingredients.  Coulda, shoulda just made actual wings.

This is the perfect amount to fill the little dipper crock pot...and although it looks like a piping hot bowl of thousand island dressing...it does taste EXACTLY like wings....HOT wings...so tone it down if you don't like hot.We however LOVED it.

If you haven't tried this you must. If you like taking home empty dishes from parties, this is a sure fire. My husband begs for me to make this so he can eat it as a meal. Not so healthy, but it shows you how good it is. Just make sure to get some good tortilla chips and celery.

Since I usually serve small gatherings, I only make a half recipe. I do not use canned chicken, but cook my own and use Blue Cheese dressing.  A small crock pot is perfect for serving.  Everyone is always impressed and most often ask for the recipe.

We made this dip for a family gathering over the New Year's holiday.  Everyone loved it.  We used Blue Cheese instead of Ranch, increased the Franks to 1 cup and omitted the Cheddar cheese.  Just threw everything into a small crock pot and heated through, which worked well.  Also goes great with tortilla chips and crusty bread.  Will definitely make again.

Fabulous! I cannot believe how quick and easy this came together. Used canned chicken and thought it was great. I served with celery sticks and Ritz crackers. Used fresh Ranch dressing (from Sams club. I cannot wait to make this for friends. Again, I am so impressed by this recipe -- I am putting it in my top 5 all time favorites from Allrecipes.

AWESOME!  If you like buffalo chicken, then you will LOVE this dip.  I boiled and shredded 3 chicken breast halves rather than using the canned chicken.  I also substituted Marie's Chunky Blue Cheese dressing rather than the ranch dressing.  I served it with tortilla chips and celery sticks.  Very, very good!

This is a great recipe, and people just love it!  I use tofu instead of chicken to make it vegetarian.  To do, I freeze the tofu, thaw, press out excess water, cut and marinate in Frank's wing sauce for a few hrs.  Then I just add that in as you do the chicken.  I definately prefer the ranch, as well.  Great addition- thanks!

Excellent, simple and tasty - what could be better?  I used blue cheese as its traditional with Buffalo Wings.  I did bake this at 350 for about 20 minutes rather than use the crockpot.  The hot wing sauce is perfect - a nice ZIP without being hot - it was enjoyed by those who don't like hot foods as well as those who do.  Everyone seemed to prefer the celery to the chicken crackers.  Great choice a a new, unusual dip!

Yes!  I got this recipe from a friend of mine.  He uses real chicken breast.  If making a regular batch we use 1-LB chicken breast.  Cut in small pieces cooked and drained then followed the regular recipe. A+

Also, the leftovers are good with Pillsbury  crescent rolls.  Take a triangle put a spoon of dip in center and roll it up and bake as directed !!! Yummy snack-a-tizer. (Use blue cheese or ranch for dipping if desired)

I hate when people say they love a recipe and then write all the ways they changed it,,,so what they're really saying is they really didn't try this recipe,,, but here I go.   This recipe was a great guide to what I made, which I would give 5 stars,, my husband did as well. I used a cup of good blue cheese dressing and half cup ranch and only 12oz of cream cheese. That way it wasn't so heavy. And I used 2 fresh boiled chicken breast instead of canned and added a bit more hot sauce for more zing. So, call me a hypocrite. Turned out really really good though!!

2.5.17 - Made this for Super Bowl Sunday, and subbed blue cheese dressing for the ranch (and cut it back slightly). I knew a full recipe would make way too much for our group, being that we had a lot of other food being served, so I cut the recipe in half, wh ich was the perfect amount for my mini-crockpot. Nice recipe, thanks!

I made no changes but did also split the recipes, serving half hot and half cold, making flour tortilla roll-ups. Amazing both ways. Fabulous recipe.

This is an easy recipe that makes  a great dip.  For easier prep make sure you cut the cream cheese into cubes and I even add a little sour cream to make sure it's not too spicy (if you want it on the mild side so everyone will enjoy it).  I also recommend the Franks Red Hot 'Buffalo Wings' sauce instead of the original as that is more of the flavor most people expect!  Remember to add the hot sauce to taste as once you add too much you'll need to have sour cream or even more cream cheese to try and tone it down.

Everyone begs me to make this again even the people who don't really like spicy! I add a little bit more hot sauce to give it extra bite. I've microwaved it a couple of times for a home party and used a crock pot for a work party another time. I've even served it for dinner over rice!

This is a sure fire hit!!  Made it just as the recipe calls for, except I put everything in my crockpot on high for about an hour. Served with Tostitos. My girls actually will put this on a tortilla wrap and make quesadillas.

I'm always asked to bring this dip to parties - everyone loves it.  I make this in a large dutch oven on the stove and then transfer to a baking dish for about 30 minutes in the oven at 350.  I use good bleu cheese dressing (like Marie's) instead of the ranch, and add one cup of the shredded cheddar to the dip while it's still on the stove and don't top the dip with it (tends to get rubbery as it cools off).  Also best served with Frito's Scoops.

I have used this recipe many times and it's quite popular. I took away one star just because I used boiled chicken rather than canned chicken, and that's a pretty significant change. Otherwise it's very good as written. Over time I've adjusted here and there. I like half ranch/half blue cheese for the dressing because I have a thing for blue cheese. I also add a little garlic powder and some celery flakes. Just a personal preference. Very good and very easy. Thanks!

My husband loves this.  He requests that I make this for parties we attend.  I got this recipe from a co-worker.  I just throw it all in a smaller dip sized crockpot, put it on low and stir to keep mixing/heating the ingredients. We serve this dip with tortilla chips.  My husband will eat the leftovers for lunch and dinner until it's all gone. I enjoy it too, just not as much as my husband apparently does :)

I used half a rotisserie chicken finely diced /shredded.  Instead of mixing all ingredients together I layered the mixed cream cheese and ranch on bottom of an 8x8 baking dish then the chicken and hot sauce mixture topped with the cheese and heat through. Next time I'm going to try putting the cheese in between the layers because once the dish started to cool it was difficult to scoop with chips (chips kept breaking). Everybody raved about it and it's great with Fritos.

Update:
Cheese in the middle is way better.

This is how I ensure this dip comes out to 5 stars EVERY TIME:
*USE REAL CHICKEN- about three good-sized breasts.  cook it. Either boil it, like some have suggested, or what I like to do is cook it in a pan on the stove with about half a bottle of the Frank's red hot sauce. 
*USE CHUNKY BLUE CHEESE DRESSING- instead of Ranch. Marie's is a great brand to use. Use the whole bottle. 
Doing these two things brings this 3 star recipe to a 5 star recipe easily!!

hands down the best. I add more red hot and I also add  a bit more sharp cheddar cheese into the mix.  I also add a bit of chunk blue cheese on top when served.

This is my go to recipe for parties. It is so easy, don't let the canned chicken scare you away. People never even know it is canned chicken. 
I make in a crockpot for parties so it's only one dish I am messing up. 
Hints: break the chicken up to very small pieces, I use the whole bag of cheese for easy measuring ha. 
People really love this recipe and everyone asks me for it.

Who cares what color it is. This stuff is amazing! Easy to tweak to make to your liking. I used 2 grilled chicken breasts. They were huge. I used half ranch and half blue cheese and lower fat cream cheese. I put in extra hot sauce because we like things spicy. Put it all together in a bowl, no skillet, put in a baking dish, sprinkled a little shredded sharp on top and some blue cheese crumbles, then baked. Yum. There are so many versions of this recipe. I guess I combined a little of all I had read. Yum!!

I really hate reading a review that has so many changes that it no longer resembles the original.  One or 2 are fine, but paragraph after paragraph and you lose me.  That said I make this all the time just as listed.  Yes I have one change....I bake it at 350 rather than using a crockpot.  It's a hit every single time!

Classic Buffalo Chicken Dip recipe. I only made a couple of changes. I, too, don't prefer canned meats to fresh, and boiled and shredded a pound of chicken breasts instead. I also switched out the ranch with Bleu cheese, because that's what you eat with chicken wings! Instead of cooking it in a slow cooker, I mix everything together and heat it through in a skillet, then transfer it to a baking dish, cover it in the cheddar cheese (always freshly grated, of course) then pop it in the broiler for 2-4 minutes until the cheese is lightly browned. Delicious, and always popular at parties! I like to serve it with Tostitos scoops. I've made a hundred times, and will make 1000 more!

I always put my cream cheese in the crock pot on high about an hour before I start cooking the rest of the ingredients so it has time to get nice, soft and easy to stir.

I've tasted this before and it was excellent. I don't have time to make this, because there's a lot of issues going on around the workplace that I have to tend to. I know many people have difficulties doing their job especially if it changes others opinions of them. The best time is when a good TV show is on or even a good flick. Cinnamon and whipped cream tops it off nicely. Even with chocolate shavings or chocolate syrup drizzle. Slows down production in the office.

I found it too spicy but I am a wimp when it comes to spicy. Everyone else loved it. I made it as written except heated it in the oven instead of the crockpot.

Yup, I was the last person in America to have heard of this recipe, apparently.  I made it for the family while they all watched some big football game, and it was by far the star of the show.  People ended up using it as a condiment on the rest of the dishes I prepared.  I saw people eating Buffalo Dip meatballs, Buffalo Dip potato casserole, they put it on chips, vegetables, and some were eating it straight up with utensils.  I think they'll disown me if I don't make this again.  I made no changes, but I did use reduced fat versions of the products called for.  Total success!

Great recipe!  Someone brought this to a party once and I've been wanting to make it since. Finally did and brought it to work and everyone went nuts! I did use Litehouse brand blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, I might try 1/2 ranch 1/2 blue cheese next time because I do love ranch dressing.

I used BC Dressing since that's what I had on hand and I increased the amount of hot sauce to 1 cup. on the advice of other reviewers I left out the cheddar cheese completely. You really need to double this recipe to fill a crockpot; my crockpot was little bit less than half full after making batch of it for a party.

I use 1/2c hot sauce instead. I notice alot of orangish oil that seeps to the top that I have to soak up with paper towels.

My husband and I love this dip. We make it per the recipe. I'm not a spicy food eater and this is still very good, I still enjoy it. Great dip for football days. I'd say it takes 15 min, tops, to make.

My guests ate this, but maybe they were really hungry...I was not very proud of it. I used the canned chicken because although my instincts were to use a rotisserie chicken, my grocery store didn't have any ready when I was shopping. I'm going to try it again with a rotisserie chicken because it has such rave reviews...but canned chicken is just not for me.

I made it with a Monterrey Jack and cheddar blend and decreased the hot sauce to 1/2 a cup. It was fantastic. :-)

I substituted the sharp cheddar with blue cheese cooked it up and tried it. Wow! Great taste with chicken when hot as a dip. The dip seems versatile enough that I am going to make a salad out of it with onion and chicken as other edible option. Anyway great recipe and highly recommended.

I have made this recipe many and it's always a favorite.  I have modified it by using the rotisserie chicken at the grocery store.  This is an excellent short cut.  If you have a Kroger's nearby, I always use their low fat southwestern ranch dressing.  I also use their fiesta blend cheese with hot pepper in the mix or the habenaro brand if I can find it.  I use frank's hot sauce, but I also put a few tablespoons of specialty hot sauce that my kids get me for Christmas.  I don't use the slow cooker, but make it in the over on 350 for 20 minutes.  If I remember to by some, I sometimes sprinkle the French onions around the sides or mix it into the cheese before sprinkling it on top.

I really enjoyed this recipe after trying it at a work potluck. However, the thought of using canned chicken makes my skin crawl. I used leftover turkey from thanksgiving instead. I also used hot wing sauce instead of hot sauce. It was perfect and everyone loved it. I also cut the recipe in 1/2 since I was only making it for us at home. I served it Frito scoops because I forgot to buy the chicken flavored crackers. I will definitely make it again, but with my same spin (fresh turkey or chicken breast).

This wasn't great for me.  I used Franks Wing sauce and found the recipe very salty.  I did get compliments and recipe requests.  It was also very easy.

Delicious.  Made it exactly as outlined in the recipe (even down the he canned meat) and it was a winner.  Next time I'll probably roast some chicken breasts but that's the only change I'll make,  it's a winner without changing a thing.

Great flavor, but too hot/spicy for me, and I generally love spicy foods. Next time I will use less hot sauce. Everyone at the party seemed to like it, though. Also I bought a large rotisserie chicken breast and shredded the meat. Can't bring myself to use canned meat. Also subbed 1/2 cup ranch & 1/2 cup bleu cheese dressing for the 1 cup ranch.

I made this recipe but did a substitution - subbed the blue cheese dressing for ranch dressing - was afraid the blue cheese flavor would overwhelm it.  The recipe with the substitution was a hit.  Very rich dish though do not need to eat a lot.  Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe! I baked this in the oven knowing the fam would gobble this up and I was right! It would not have sat very long in the crock pot. I otherwise followed the directions exactly, I then baked it for 25 min at 350 degrees. I think I will use roasted chicken breast cut into chunks next time. This is definitely a crowd pleaser!

Amazing! I also used real boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced and cooked in the hot sauce then followed the recipe from there. So easy and delicious. I took this to a Halloween party and everyone loved it. I used the amount if hot sauce suggested which I thought might be too spicy because I usually like my wings mild. It was just a bit of heat and I probably will use more the next time. I will definitely keep this as a go-to party snack.

Loved this - did use blue cheese instead of ranch and shredded chicken breasts and it was perfect and a hit!  I bought the "block" cheddar and shredded it myself and it was not greasy at all.  I need to double the recipe next time, it was such a hit.

I didn't care much for this dip but my family loved it and ate all of it.  I used chicken breasts that I had roasted in the oven.  I also used only half of the cream cheese and substituted wing sauce in place of the hot sauce.  It was a bit bland so I added some crushed garlic to add some punch.  The next time I make this I would use an alternative to ranch dressing as I found it gave it a strange taste - maybe a combo of sour cream and mayo.  I baked it in the oven and did not get the greasiness that other reviewers have reported.   Based strictly on the reviews of my family, one of whom called me the next day to say she was still thinking about it, it is a great 5 star recipe.  With some further tweaking I may upgrade my own personal rating....we'll see!

I made this for a 4th of July pool party. Used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch, and made in a crock pot (didn't want to use the oven in the Phoenix heat!). Served with tortilla chips, carrot and celery sticks. Everyone loved it, came home with an empty crock pot!

This recipe is awesome.  I like it a little spicier, but not everyone cares for that.   It is so easy to make.

I used rotisserie  chicken as another reviewer mention.  Very easy to make.  Slow cooker excellent idea as this dip  needs to stay warm.

I've made this many times when looking for something to do with cooked chicken (not canned). I do follow many of Scout99's tips which work great. I usually just make a small amount in a casserole dish, layering the cream cheese (actually used the whipped type) and blue cheese dressing, which works well here. Then I mix the chicken with some bottled buffalo chicken sauce, layer that with more of the cream cheese mixture, then top with whatever cheese you prefer. (I used a Mexican blend this time.) I scoop out some, top with choppped scallions and had with crackers. It is very rich, so a little goes a long way. Thanks NUNPUNCH for the great recipe, and Scout99 for the helpful hints!

Great dip!even my kids love it. It's low carb when paired with celery or pork rinds. I followed another reviewer's advice and doubled the chicken and increased the hot sauce (Used Frank's). This time, along with the cheddar topping layer I added a few crumbles of bleu cheese on one edge to test!

People ask me to make this for them left and right. I alternate between ranch and blue cheese dressing depending on what I have on hand. This is very easy and a total hit. I wouldn't eat it with chicken flavored crackers, however.

Family loved it but it was a little vinegar(y) for my taste. And others commented on the (fishy)flavor of the canned chicken. Thought I could get around that by using Swanson's brand but it was still an obvious flavor to me. I will certainly make this again but will add my own cooked chicken and different hot sauce. Franks is suppose to be the best but I didn't care for it.However that's just my personal taste. Recipe was SUPER easy to make and overall was a BIG hit!

We love it!!  I use Blue Cheese dressing part of the time.  a lot of ranch dressings have MSG which I try to avoid for health reasons.  I usually make it in a 9x13 pan.  One end has hot sauce, the other has barbeque sauce for my hubby.  Everyone is happy, happy, happy!!

I followed this recipe exactly and when I tried it I was not satisfied. It was really bland. I ended up adding almost a cup more of Franks, adding Cajun seasoning, garlic, more cheese and some Louisiana Hot Sauce. If I make it again, I will use real chicken and try to add more flavor.

This was very good and more filling than just regular dip. I used pulled chicken breast but stuck to the recipe. Served with tortilla chips, vegetables and bread. I will make this again.

I know this is weird because I hate hot sauce and ranch dressing but I wanted to try this so bad. I just warmed up a can of chicken with a little butter on the stove, added a block of cream cheese, a 1/2 cup of ranch dressing, 3/4 cup of hot sauce and a cup of finely shredded cheese and cooked it all on the stove for about 7 minutes and it was simply wonderful

Tried this over the weekend for a party we had. It was a HUGE hit! The guests loved it, even my kids loved it, including the five year old! I think next time I will exchange the chicken for bacon, and maybe add a little liquid smoke for a little more depth. I baked it rather than used the crockpot, since I had other things going at the same time. The only issue I really had with it was the cream cheese kind of "curdled" so the dip had lil bits of it rather than everything mixing smoothly. I used and electric mixer so I am not sure what happened.
Update: Made it again, with bacon. Still super yummy, although a little salty. Still a hit.

This is a favorite!   However, it is much better with real chicken breasts instead of that canned stuff.  I slow cook 3 boneless breasts in chicken broth for 4 hours.  Drain and shred with two forks, then prepare the dip.   Yumm!!!

I made this using canned chicken, but I cooked my chicken in butter, white pepper an garlic, to change the taste of the chicken and it was awesome. This is a keeper.

I have made this recipe several times. It's always a hit. I mix everything together in my Pampered Chef covered baker and bake at 325 for 20 min. I set aside about half a cup of the cheese. After it is done baking I spread the cheese on top and put the lid back on to melt it. So yummy.

This may be my new favorite. I roasted a couple of chicken breasts with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning before shredding. I maybe would add a bit more pepper sauce, but we like it spicy. I really enjoyed it with celery sticks

I make this recipe a little bit different. I boil the chicken for 20 minutes, shred it, then boil for another 20 minutes. Meanwhile, I put the cream cheese on the bottom of the deep dish and mix together the Frank's Red Hot hot sauce and the French* dressing. After, I mix the chicken in a bowl with the dressing, shredded cheddar cheese and hot sauce and pour it over the cream cheese. After, I put more cheddar cheese on top and put it in the oven for 15 minutes. Ritz crackers are the best to use:)

Made this for my boyfriends 40th surprise birthday party.  This was a big hit.  The only thing I changed was instead of canned chicken I used rotiserie chicken from the super market.  Will definitely be making this again. Thanks

I don't use canned meat, so I used boneless chicken breast.  TO make it easy I threw the chicken (frozen) into a crockpot in the morning and when it was done I took it out, shredded it, and then threw it back in the crockpot along with all the other ingredients.  It kept it nice and warm during the whole football game and the men LOVED it!!  No leftovers!!

Tasty but next time I would cut back on the cream cheese, and add more chicken.  BTW I used fresh chicken breast not canned.

I've made this recipe many times, & it's always a hit! I put all ingredients in a crock pot, and serve when it's hot. It's good with tortilla chips too!

Every time I make this I end up getting a phone call asking how to make it. Simple and delicious. Makes a great dip to throw in a dip size slow cooker and then take to a game day. Every week I let one of my kids choose a meal and most of the time, whoever it is asks me to make this.

I took Scout99's suggestion and layered it instead of mixing it all together, and I just loved it.  Great appearance, and so super yummy!

I used fresh chicken that I smoked instead of canned chicken. I used half ranch dressing and half blue cheese dressing. 1/3 less fat cream cheese instead of regular. I used "scoops" instead of chicken flavored crackers. I found that the dip was the best on celery. This is an EASY recipe to make.  I will make again!!

This is a nice easy, tasty appetizer. It's incredibly easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly except I used a rotisserie chicken instead of canned, and added some bleu cheese crumbles on top.

The only thing I did different was to bake my own chicken and not use canned.  I really didn't follow the amount because I just "wing" the measurements.  Turned out great.

This dip has been a big hit in my household for several years now. In place of canned chicken we bake skinless boneless chicken breast, let it cool down and then shred it.  Also, we prefer Totino's Scoops in lieu of celery or crackers.

I make it with Colby Jack cheese, chopped up the celery(added into the mixture) and added blue cheese to the recipe...this way it is more like a recipe I received from a former coworker. Much tastier than this recipe! and have never had leftovers!

This dip is fantastic! Easy and delicious.  The only thing I change is, I use Texas Pete wing sauce. I take it to work once in a while and my boss loves it.  If there is any left over, he always asks if he can take it home!

This was really good with some minor modifications, based upon previous reviewers' advice.  I used two packages of light cream cheese and spread it in the bottom of a pie plate.  I then mixed the chicken (I used Costco's grilled chicken strips) with the Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce and put it on top of the cream cheese layer. I then put blue cheese dressing on top of the chicken and then two cups of shredded cheddar on the blue cheese dressing.  I baked it at 425 for 15 minutes and it was awesome.  I served it with Frito Scoops.  Everyone at our Super Bowl party loved it.

I liked it.  I'm trying to eat less processed food so I tweaked it to accomodate that(made chicken and ranch at home.) It took longer but I can feel okay about what's in it. I wish I had cut back on the cream cheese, it was a little too much for me.  I used a mixture of Frank's hot sauce and the Buffalo Wild Wings Spicy Garlic...I love that stuff!

Have made this recipe a bunch of times and it's always a hit! I usually poach chicken and shred that since I'm not a fan of canned chicken. Sometimes I substitute bleu cheese dressing for ranch, both ways are delish!

I tried this recipe with real chicken and it was so delicious. Way better than can chicken. What a difference. For a short cut, I blended the cream cheese,ranch dressing,& hot sauce to a creamy mixture, then added the shredded cheese and cooked chicken, then heated in the microwave. And of course nacho chips for dipping was superb!

I have made this before as is but recently made it again with some changes that apparently sent it into the stratosphere.  Everyone was clamoring for the recipe.  I cooked chicken breasts myself rather than using canned chicken, I used Bleu Cheese dressing instead of Ranch and probably the most significant change was I used Syberg's Buffalo Wing Sauce rather than a red pepper sauce.

Good stuff! I mainly stuck to the recipe, and it came out very well. The only alteration that I made was to add about 1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles, and I boiled 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, then chopped them, in lieu of canned chicken.

This is a great recipe! I followed the advice of some others on here and substituted ranch for blue cheese dressing. I served with plain club crackers.  This was a hit!

So easy to make and tasted great!  You have to keep the dip warm after making it or else the cheese will firm up.

Great recipe but made with roasted chicken breasts would never buy canned chicken. It was delicious hot with crackers and also good served cold in endive 'cups' on a circular party platter.  I'm going to try this as a stuffing for baked bell peppers.

Very good recipe.  Went over very well at the gathering I took it to, so much so that I have been elected to make it every time!  I used Frank's Red Hot, store brand cream cheese, Hidden Valley ranch, Sargento off-the-block shredded mild cheddar, and Swanson canned chicken breast meat (Not chunk.  I only wanted whole pieces of white breast meat.  Although I am extremely picky with meat and the thought of using canned chicken grossed me out, I would use this again and not even think about cooking my own chicken.  Too much work and the texture of the canned chicken was perfect for dip.) The only variation that I made was dumping the entire bag cheese in.  I wish I had just stuck to the amount listed in the recipe because it altered the texture and made it way to thick for my liking.  Next time I will be sticking to the recipe as written.

A good starter.  I didn't think it was spicy enough - ended up adding more hot sauce.  Also, I don't think that melting everything in a skillet is really necessary, and it makes for a lot more cleanup!

This was very good and easy. My only complaint (which is personal opinion) is using the canned chicken. It almost gave it that metal taste. Next time I make this I plan to boil chicken, shred it, and then follow exactly.

This recipe is delish! All the guys request for football games, I am lazy though and just throw all ingredients into a ceramic baker, so I have less dishes, and bake at 375 for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

This recipe has been the staple of every party and gathering I have hosted for the past three years. I prefer to replace the Ranch with Blue Cheese dressing for an extra kick. It's also great with Wheat Thins or Triscuits.

This dip was delicious...I should have used Frank's hot sauce, but I had "One Hot Mama" on hand and it was very hot, but it was very good for those of us who like things on the spicier side.  I used diced turkey leftover from Christmas dinner!  This will become an annual Boxing Day tradition in our house.

Decent base recipe.  Changes I make: I cook 1lb chicken breasts in the crock pot the day before with a little water and shred.....canned chicken creeps me out...if in a pinch I buy a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store and shred.  I use a good blue cheee instead of ranch because I eat my buffalo wings with blue cheese and frankly I hate ranch.

This recipe called for canned chicken, because I was going by memory I accidentally bought fresh chicken tenders and it was about 2 or 3 oz more than it called for, but it worked out in my favor.  After it was cooked, I tore the chicken using a knife and fork so it would have that shredded texture.  I did not move it to a slow cooker as it suggested, but allowed it to simmer on low heat or until all shredded cheese was melted. I took it to a party and it was a huge hit! No leftovers! I brought crackers (Club crackers) they worked pretty good :)

Not too bad.  All I could taste was the buffalo sauce.  Maybe would use less of it next time or try a different brand.

I thought this recipe was ok, but I'm giving it 4 stars because everyone loved it!  I triped the recipe to make an entire crockpot full for a party.  I made two changes: I only used 2.5 cups of dressing for the entire 3x recipe, and 4 blocks of cream cheese.  This made the dip more chunky.  I also added in a container of bleu cheese at the end so there were chunks of bleu cheese.  To make the dip more appealing for my taste, I'd add something in it to make varying textures, such as stirring diced celery or scallions into the dip at the end, right before serving.  However, even without that change, there was no dip left at the end of the night.  Men really liked it.  Buy lots of crackers or Tostitos Scoops though, the men didn't eat much celery!

I made this dip for a small get together I was having and it got rave reviews!  Everyone kept asking what I did "different" because it was BETTER than the other Buffalo Chicken Dips they have had!  I mixed all of the ingredients as stated (used Blue Cheese instead of Ranch) and transferred it to a small crock pot--it held up wonderfully!

Just made a few changes, but was super yummy!  I omitted the cheddar cheese from the mixture as other reviewers said it was overly greasy, but sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top before serving.  After I melted all the ingredients in the pan, I poured it into a 8x8 pan and served right away.  Non need to put in the oven.

This is a great recipe when I make it for football Sunday everyone loves it! For the chicken I buy a half roasted chicken from the store and shred the meat off of that and I wouldnt use all that cheddar cheese it makes it too greasy, either use half of that amount or mix it with mozzarella OR just use all mozzarella :)

This dip is delicious!  I've made it many times for parties and never bring any home.  Instead of canned chicken I use chicken breasts that I've cooked the day before in the slow cooker and shredded.  I don't put the cheddar cheese in because some other reviewers said it made the dip greasy and really it is very rich even without it.  Since I'm from Buffalo I use Blue Cheese instead of Ranch dressing too.  Celery and tortilla chips are good for dipping.  This one is a keeper!

I'll give 2 instead of 1 star after making this only because others liked it. I'll never make THIS recipe again. I don't like my dip chunky and having to spoon out and spooning out with difficulty.  If the cream cheese isn't kept hot it will re-solidify. That and having to spoon off the oil that rose to the top from the melted cream cheese was ridiculous. I kind of knew before hand when it called for serving it in a crock pot! How many dips do you have to serve in a crock pot and do you really want your guests sticking their hands into your crock pot, breaking crackers and getting dip on their sleeves? 
The taste was okay if you like cream cheese. But this highlights a problem with Allrecipes - 2700 reviews on this recipe and very few other buffalo chicken dips recipes. I came across another this morning using sour cream in place of half the cream cheese.  I'll make this again with better ingredients.

This recipe was ok.  I used Nueftel cheese to cut down on the calories, but it was so thick I had to add milk to make it "dip-able".  I will try it again with the exact ingredients.  Tasted yummy though.

I made this for Thanksgiving. My Husband and relatives loved it but I thought it was to spicy. I added more sauce as some suggested so maybe that was the problem. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly to see it this helps.

I followed the advice of others and baked my own chicken breasts and shredded the meat. I also subbed blue cheese for the ranch and did not cover with shredded cheese. I brought it to Thanksgiving to serve during the evening while everyone was playing cards, etc. This particular group is open to trying new things but no one really cared for it! People only took one helping and no one had it as left overs the next day. I thought it was okay but nothing I'd ever make again. Can't really pin it down though...maybe too much of a blue cheese/cream cheese texture? My co-worker loves it but I don't see what the craze is about and I LOVE buffalo wings!!

This my go-to party offering!  Always get tons of compliments on it.  But I use regular boneless, skinless chicken breast rather than canned chicken.

Very good base recipe, but I made a few changes. I used rotisserie chicken.  I "marinated" the chicken with the buffalo sauce in a ziploc overnight (normally I don't have time for this step but I did this time and it was even better). I also used half ranch dressing and half blue cheese dressing and added blue cheese crumbles on top. Turned out great!

I liked the dip, and so did EVERYONE else at my son's football team tailgate party. Trying to keep things easy, I decided to do it all in my slow-cooker. 
Turn it on low. Place cream cheese (straight from refrigerator), ranch, and pepper sauce in cooker. While that began to soften, I started to chop my chicken breasts...sorry, not a fan of the can. Actually, I used my mini chopper to get it superfine for the dip. 
After the chicken is shredded, add it and half the cheese to the softened items in the crock pot, stir to incorporate it all, top with remaining cheese, crank it up until the cheese on top gets bubbly, then bring back down to keep warm setting. One dish PERFECTION!

Wonderful! I made this for the Ravens season opener last night and it was nearly all gone! I used fresh chicken breast, chopped fine, and a 1/2 cup of Blue Cheese instead of Ranch. I look forward to this one all season!

Great dip! I used Trader Joe's jalapeno pepper sauce since I wasn't sure which one was equal to Frank's Red Hot. It was spicy but so good! Really enjoyed it with Chickin in a Biscuit crackers.

A great starting point! I have made this multiple times, and it is always hit! However, I change mine a decent amount. In my opinion, there is too much of the "sauce" items and not enough chicken in the original recipe. Last time, I added extra chicken AND reduced cream cheese and ranch. Plus, I hardly add any cheese to this recipe - I just don't think it's necessary. Like I said before, a great starter recipe! Just change it to your own taste!

My wife made this and it is the bomb.  She used fresh, free range chicken breasts and pureed (on accident) instead of chopped, and it came out great.  Excellent with just celery, chips, or by the spoonful.

Everytime I make this people are scraping the pot! It is a huge hit. I substitute blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.

I make this dip for almost every get together we attend.  I never come home with any and I typically make a double or triple amount.

The one variation I do which makes it easier is to simply dump all the ingredients into the kitchen aid and mix (saving about 1/4 the cheese out) and dump it into a pan and bake it at 350 for 30 min (or until bubbly) and then put the remaining cheese on top and bake until bubbly again.  It turns out great and I don't have to stand at the stove top.

I love this recipe. I make it for potlucks all the time. It so easy to make in a crockpot. I used the canned chicken but put it in a skillet and seasoned it to get rid of the canned taste. Then I put it in my crockpot with the other ingrediets. I also use half ranch half blue cheese dressing.

OOOOOHHHHHH so good.  I've found my new vice.  Use bleu cheese versus ranch for a more buffalo wingy taste.

This stuff is awesome! I will always make this exact recipe... Has the right amount of kick without having your mouth on fire! My husband did request less cream cheese so instead of 2 I'll try 1 or 1 1/2 next time. Oh and I used Fresh chicken.. Not canned

This is delicious dip.  My only suggestion is to only use one can of chicken salad.  I drain the chicken salad and grind it up really small and pour the hot sauce into it and set it aside to soak for a few minutes while mixing the other ingredients.  I then heat it and serve it with round nacho chips.

TO.  DIE.  FOR.  This was said by everyone at the party :0)  I changed it just a bit.  I used 2 chicken breasts boiled in chicken broth, shredded them, and mixed it all together in a pan and baked till bubbly.

Great with celery, I added a little bit more hot sauce to the prepared dish. And the thicker Hot Sauce worked as well.

All family members like this dip.  I did reduce the amount of hot sauce by half for the toddler in the house, and I feel it would have been better with the full amount stated in the recipe. I also halved the entire recipe for our family of four.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Nunpunch!  It's a keeper!

This was very good. My family made short work of it at the SuperBowl and birthday party. I used fresh chicken which I boiled in water with garlic and a teaspoon of chili seasoning. I also added green onions and black olives.

This was delicious! I pretty much followed the recipe, as written. Got great reviews from the family. I served it with tortilla chips (oh, but I did dump everything in a small crockpot and stirred every once in awhile...no pots to clean) : )

Every time I make this, it's gone in a flash.  Definitely a favorite.  I usually make it in a saucepan since I'm still working on getting a slow cooker, but it works just as well.
My sister-in-law suggested it might also taste good with boiled eggs instead of chicken if you want to try that.

I made this for a work potluck and everyone loved it - though it was too spicy for some. I would probably use less chicken next time, and it would be a great way to use up leftover chicken.

I really enjoyed this as did my company. I used the canned chicken and expected it to taste "canned" but  it didn't, I did rinse the chicken before using it though. I mixed everything together in a skillet and then transferred it to a small casserole dish and baked it for 25-30 at 350. So easy.

Excellent!!  I poached my own chicken and shredded it instead of using canned.  Also, for a prettier presentation I layered cream cheese mixture, then chicken and hot sauce, with shredded cheddar cheese on top.  Definitely a keeper!!!

Made this for the super bowl today and I think I should have made more because my husband and 5 year old (who are VERY picky eaters) have put a HUGE dent in it already and the guests haven't arrived yet!!! I did alter the recipe a little I boiled chicken breast tenderloins in chicken broth lightly seasoned with poultry seasoning and I used hidden valley ranch. PERFECT!!!!

Threw this together at the last minute with chicken breasts that I needed to cook up.  FANTASTIC.  It was gone in no time.  Don't use canned chicken - pick up a  rotisserie chicken from the grocery store or roast some chicken breasts in the oven quickly - it will make all the difference!

This is a terrific dip!  I also dislike canned chicken so I season chicken thighs (with skin) with salt/pepper/garlic powder and bake until they are done (several hours but with the skin it doesn't dry out). Then remove the skin and pull off bone and shred and use that instead of the canned stuff.  I also layer it like the other reviewer did and bake it.

After cooking it a few times, I've made these modifications: 1) roast the chicken myself (about 1 lb); 2) only used half of the cream cheese; 3) only used 1/3 of the pepper sauce. The original recipe is good, but with my modification it tasted even better.

This did not look appetizing but the flavor is awesome and everyone loved it. Instead of ranch I added 1 cup heavy cream and 3 tablespoons ranch powder because my husband does not like mayo. I do think next time I will only add 1 pkg cream cheese

Made this with 2 boiled chix breasts, shredded. 2 packets of cream cheese and one cup bleu cheese dressing. Used Anchor buffalo wing sauce (whole bottle) and a few shots of Frank's Red Hot. Used pita bread cut up and brushed with melted butter and baked. Fabulous and addicting!

This recipe is pretty good! I did reduce hot sauce a little as we do not like real hot stuff...I also reduced the cream cheese and added sour cream. I do believe next time I will use buffalo sauce. This recipe is close to one at a local restaurant that I love but missing something!

This is YUMMY!  I had several requests for the recipe!  I used blue cheese instead of the ranch.  I tried this layered, but it was actually much better when it was all mixed up!  Will be making this again and again!  Thanks!

If you want a versatile, simple to make dish that will have people asking you for the recipe all night long, than you can't go wrong with this bad boy. It's certainly got some kick...which I like! Perfect for Super Bowl Parties, Pot Lucks, etc.

Huge hit!  I use a rotisserie chicken from the deli at my grocery store.  The first time I made this dip I was told I'd have to make it for every gathering forever :)

Big hit on Christmas Eve!  I went to the trouble of shredding sharp cheddar cheese to avoid the oily look mentioned by some reviewers - and it was still quite oily on top.  But once the dipping started, it all got sort of mixed in anyway and it was fine.  I would not give points for presentation, looked "prechewed" according to my so-helpful brother - but BIG points for ease in the crockpot, and was it ever tasty!  Next time - bleu cheese dressing!

Just came home from Christmas with the family and this was a huge hit!  I also poached three chicken breasts and shredded them.  Then i mixed the cream cheese, 1.5 cups of Franks (we like spicy), the cheddar and ranch and just poured everything in a casserole dish.  Didn't feel up to baking last night so i refrigerated the mixture and cooked this morning at about 350 till bubbly.  Still warm when i arrived and after the first taste, everyone loved it.  When I make it for myself i will add blue cheese crumbles at the end (i thought about substituting blue cheese dressing for ranch but i think the tang of ranch went well with the mix).  

Thanks for this one!

This was so good and gone in seconds... Definitely rave reviews from everyone at my holiday party.  I was a little nervous using the cheddar cheese because of reviews stating that it made the dish oily but I used it and it turned out fine. Yummy!  I served it with tostitos scoops, fritos scoops and ritz crackers.

LOVED this dip, great for parties! But definitely substitute for the canned chicken. I bought thin breasts and grilled so there was that nice flavor and chopped. A per other reviews, baked for 20 minutes at 350 instead of slow cooking. Quick, easy, and YUMMY!

I make the same dip, but usually use baked chicken or leftover deli chicken--probably about 3-4 cups of meat.  And I use a full small sized bottle of ranch dressing, and the full bottle of Frank's Hot Sauce.   We use Fritoes or celery pieces to scoop it up.  My husband loves this, and sometimes even makes it himself using the canned chicken meat.

This is our new family favorite dip! We usually only use 1/2 cup hot sauce as we have younger kids eating it too...but the older people eating it don't seem to miss that extra 1/4 cup so it's all good. We love to eat it on slices of bread as well as celery. Great recipe!

This is so, so, so fantastic.  I brought it to a party and it was gone instantly! Followed the recipe, except didn't use a slow cooker and didn't add the second half of cheese.  Good cold or hot - people couldn't get enough!!! Served with wheat thins.

Used one of those premixed bags of Mexican cheeses instead of just cheddar cheese because its all that I had. Didn't move it to a slow cooker. Just left it on the stove for about 30 minutes and it came out perfect.

This is a big hit at parties and tailgating.  I use either store bought Rotessiere chicken or cook 3-4 chicken breast and shred.  I also use a hot and med wing sauce and sometime the hot sauce (depending on how much heat I want).  This is def a winner!

Made this and absolutely loved it!  I ended up making it in the oven according to NYPD K9's review. My kids gobbled it up!  Served it with celery & carrot sticks, as well as tortillas & crackers.  Gotta try it!

Oh My Yummness - so good!  I didn't have any canned chicken so I boiled 3 large chicken breasts (they were exactly 20 oz) in water while I started the rest of the items (including the hot sauce) in the crockpot.  I shredded the chicken and threw that in the crock as well - super easy and a huge hit!

This dip was really tasty.  I doubled the cans of chicken to get the texture that I wanted.  When I make it again, I will add diced  up chicken breast so that the chicken is more prominent in the dish.

I made this recently and people have been aggressively asking me to make it again. Huge hit. I now make it with ground chicken thigh rather than the canned stuff. I'm not too big on the essence of canned meat.

Eating this right now while watching football and wow, its awesome!  I made a couple of changes as some have posted.  I used rotissary chicken in place of the caned and bluecheese dressing instead of ranch.  I can definetly taste the blue cheese in this dish.  Its going very well with Tostito chips!

I also used boneless chicken breast * 1/2 cup ranch & 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing, But I BBQ the chicken and shredded it, removing any over chard parts, Also added just a few drops of liquid smoke. Delicious!

I made a double batch for a fight night and left some at home for us to enjoy later.   I ended up putting our reserved portion on store bought pizza dough with bleu cheese crumbles over the top.  We (husband and friends) liked it better as a pizza topping! It was an all in one deal and amazing!

P.S. I agree with previous reviewers about the orange color being off-putting.  I will definitely go the layering route if I'm serving it as a dip.

Every time I make this for parties it is the only dish that is COMPLETELY empty at the end. EVERYONE asks for this recipe. I don't change much except I do like to go for some lower fat ingredients. No one can tell the difference if you sub in some fat free cream cheese  or light ranch dressing.

The flavor of the end product is reminiscent of hot wings, but I don't care for the smell that the canned chicken brings.

excellent recipe, I found Cheddar Cheese bit too greesey, so I substitute Monteray Pepper Jack Cheese. (I have made it with Low Fat/Fat Free cheeses, ranch, and cream cheese no one will second guess its low fat).   Excellent recipe no complaints =) Thank you.

Awesome dip.  I did make a few minor changes after reading reviews.  I used pan grilled chicken breast as opposed to canned.  I also substituted cheddar cheese for monterey jack.  It was huge hit at my get-together and many asked for the recipe. I was craving it again the next day!

Super easy & quick to make. For a slightly cheesier version, I substitute blue cheese for ranch and add about a 1/4 cup more cheese. 

Always a hit among party goers!

Really yummy!!! I reduced the recipe by half and used frozen chicken breast that I sauteed (I was horrified by the idea of canned chicken). I also added 3 tbsp of Tuong ot toi viet-nam Chili Garlic Sauce, and a hand full of chopped banana peppers. We like things spicy!

Awesome!  The only thing I did different was I baked in a casserole dish on 350 for about 45 mins before serving instead of using a crock pot.  It was the perfect all the guys in my office went crazy over it!

This is our go to party recipe.  Everyone loves it.  I like to serve with carrot sticks for a healthy alternative.  We have also used different hot sauces to switch up the heat variations.  My favorite is Nance's chicken wing sauce!

I make this for for parties all the time and everyone loves it.  I make two small adjustments to the recipe. I use rotisserie chicken instead of canned.  Instead of using a crock pot, I put everything in a 9x13 baking dish and bake it at 375 until it's brown and bubbly.

I love this recipe but I always use cooked chicken breasts or shredded rotisserie chicken since I think canned chicken tastes too much like tuna in this recipe. Also, instead of celery and crackers, I serve it with tortilla scoops. So delicious and always a crowd pleaser!

I'm a big fan!! You can put it in a casserole dish 12X9 and heat it up in the oven for half hour on 350 when your ready to serve! Great for dipping out of too.

Awesome! Followed the directions except for the crock pot. After melting and mixing, I put it in a glass dish and baked for about 10-15 @ 400. Came out beautiful! This was a HUGE hit!!

WOW- I don't even eat meat and this smelled HEAVENLY! I feed 5 guys on a nightly basis and they DEVOURED this! For once there was no talking around the dinner table because they were all too busy eating! Super easy and SUPER popular... the only think I changed was I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. What a fabulous and easy recipe. I WILL make this more often (And they're ALL excited!)

I decided to make it lower in fat and calories so I used one package Philadelphia brand fat free cream cheese, one pacakge light cream cheese, fat free Ranch dressing and Kraft 2% milk shredded cheddar cheese.  I didn't tell my husband that it was "light" before he dug in and raved how wonderful it was.  That endorsement meant you can't tell it's lower fat/cal so I will definitely be making this again with those modifications.  Give it a shot!  Totally addictive!

I used lowfat everything, I used 8oz lowfat cream cheesed and 8 ounces fat free cream cheese. I also make my own homemade Buttermilk Ranch from Hidden Valley, I make it all lowfat and I used that in place (YUMMY) I also used Kraft shredded fat free cheddar cheese, melt's great, cant even tell it's fat free in dips. I also added about a handful of reduced fat blue cheese crumbles, add's that extra zing I thought this was missing. Went soo fast I made more and then the leftovers I gave to my hubby's friend, he was eating it with a fork.

I like making this as a finger food on occasion except I make it slightly different. Instead of canned chicken, I used cooked chicken breasts and I do not add any ranch. P.S. this is totally gluten free my way but with gluten free crackers, of course.

Great, easy dip that is quick to put together, even at the last minute, and usually everything is already on hand.  I use diced/shredded chicken breasts, ranch dressing mix, and plain yogurt instead of canned chicken and ready-made dressing, mix it all and place it in a casserole in the oven.  Raves every time!

I made this dip for superbowl 2011. After going to many parties I had to change what I usually make, I have canned chicken and never knew what to do with it.  This dip was a HIT! (I was almost the most popular person there!).  I do hate ranch dressing so used blue cheese and sourcream as I didn't have any blue cheese dressin.  I used Tabasco as my small town stores didn't have any Franks Red Hot sauce, (I have since stocked up on the Franks in case I get invited to another party).  Thanks Alot!

Loved this dip! My guests all asked for the recipe. I did make a couple of slight changes, however. I used half sharp cheddar cheese and half crumbled bleu cheese. Also, I put slightly less hot sauce into it. Overall...highly recommend!

This dip exceeded my expectations -- it's delicious as a hot appetizer and is a great cold leftover with a side of crisp carrots.  I used 3/4 cup of ranch dressing with 1/4 cup blue cheese dressing which added a nice zip that wasn't over the top (especially if blue cheese isn't your favourite flavor).  A truly terrific recipe!

We LOVE this! The only thing I will do differently next time is the cheese on top, it didn't need it and it kind of got in the way of my eager dippers! Was surprisingly good on the celery or other veggies too!

Delicious! I only used one package of cream cheese for a meatier dip and used a blend of mozzarella and cheddar-I also boiled and shredded 3 chicken breasts. Easy and delicious, I'm sure it would be just as tasty as written, I just prefer more chicken and less "dip"

Oh, this was so yummy and everyone really liked it!  I used Franks Hot Sauce and I cooked 2 pieces of chicken then put them in the food processor.  I like it that way so it didn't distract too much with big chicken pieces.  Super yummy with celery and tortilla chips!

This is a very good!I always use cut up browned chicken breast and 1/2 cup lt blue cheese dressing and 1/2 cup ranch. Make sure you use real cheese not 2% light, so it melts nice and goooie. Celery is my fovorite dipper too.

The dip came out fantastic! I have to give it 4 stars because I changed it up the preparation slightly. I am not a fan of canned chicken so instead I poached chicken breasts in boiling water and pulled the chicken into smaller pieces when done.  The rest of the recipe I left as is and the flavor was great.  I served it with tortilla chips and it was addicting! The next day I took the leftovers and served it warm in a soft taco with lettuce and tomato.

This turned out great! I used 2 cans chicken and 1 cup of everything else, then I just put it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes. It was so incredibly easy and so good. Everyone loved it with the celery sticks.

This is a great recipe!  I did not have buffalo sauce, so I made some variations.  I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with chiles, a can of black beans (drained and rinsed), low-fat cream cheese and low-fat ranch dressing. I mixed it with the chicken and then baked in in a casserole dish with the cheese sprinkled on top.  It was a hit!

We all thought this was quite good.  I used a rotisserie chicken, meat shredded, as per another reviewer (I think canned meat is gross); subbed blue cheese dressing for the ranch (tho I love ranch and think that would be just as good) and put the chicken mixture in a baking dish, topped with the cheddar and baked until the cheese melted (rather than mess with the crock pot).  Served with Fritos Scoops and celery sticks, and it was perfect for the Super Bowl.  It's a nice change from the usual spinach dip or RoTel queso dip.

I assigned the making of this to my 16 year old who wrinkled her nose at the 'canned chicken'. A minute later everything came together & it was absolutely delicious. My friend says she knows an even more decadent dip with blue cheese etc. etc. I dont see how it could be any better and we dont need any extra calories- this one is rich enough! thanks for the recipe.

Awesome!  I tried Blue Cheese dressing after reading several other reviews.  It's a little too much, so I'll use half Ranch and half Blue Cheese next time.

I've collected receipes off this site for three years and this is my first review.  Although I consider alot of recipes five stars, I just had to say how EASY and how DELISH this recipe is!  This dip tastes exactly like buffalo chicken wings without the messy fingers or the bones! LOVED it and would give it ten stars, if I could. Thank you so much, Nunpunch!!!!

Wow - this is delicious! Perfect for Super Bowl day... when all Americans are excused from thinking about calories, etc.... right?

I replaced the Ranch with Marie's blue cheese dressing, and I used a rotisserie chicken instead of canned. I don't know how it tastes according to the recipe, but with these changes, it's pretty darn tasty! I'm serving it with celery and tortilla chips.

Excellent!  Made it for today's party and used the used Rotisserie chicken and Blue Cheese instead of Ranch.  I was going to add the blue cheese crumbles, as another reader did, but I don't think it needs it.  As a matter of fact, I may have to make another batch, because the kids and I can't stop dipping; it's so tasty.  Definitely a keeper.

I usually decrease by half the buffalo/wings sauce because I thought it was a little over powering.  I add a 1/2 teasp of garlic powder too.

This recipe is amazing.    I use chicken breasts (shredded) instead of canned chicken for my personal taste.  Everyone loves it and the amount of hot sauce can easily be adjusted for the taste of those you are making it for!

Always a huge hit. I do not recommend using canned chicken though. Either use  2 large cooked boneless skinless chicken or for an easier alternative the Perdue Short Cuts oven roasted chicken strips chopped up. One package is usually sufficient. Love to serve this with blue tortilla chips.

I have been making Chicken Wing Dip for several years now and it is ALWAYS a hit! We prefer using Blue Cheese dressing and Chicken Breast (canned chicken is too salty for our taste). I don't bake it either but instead use my slow cooker or crock pot as then you can keep it warm.
Side note: my sister has used wild turkey before too and it was very good!

This dip is really great and everyone loves when I make it.  I do change a few things though. For the chicken I usually roast it in the oven the day before I will make the dip.  I coat it with olive oil and garlic and then sprinkle it with williams and sonoma's chili lime rub.  Squeeze the juice of one lemon and one lime over it and roast at 350deg f for 40 minutes.  Also for the dip i just cook it in the oven in a pyrex pie dish and i sprinkle the top with some smoked paprika for color.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and everyone loves it! The only changes I make is to use poached chicken breasts and shred them instead of the canned chicken. I also bake in the oven instead of using the crockpot and I serve the dip with tortilla chips. Will be making some for Superbowl Sunday! Thanks for the great recipe!

Use real chicken. Was not sure if it was the brand of Ranch dressing, or the canned chicken but it didn't come out tasting too good.

My favorite appetizer recipe!  I have made this so many times, and it is always the hit of the party, with lots of recipe requests.  I love the recipe as is, but I have varied the recipe at times.  I prefer it with blue cheese dressing, for a more pungent flavor, and I have used light dressing and light cream cheese to reduce the fat (it is not the healthiest recipe!), no matter what it always turns out great. I like to serve it with carrots, celery, fritos scoops and tortilla chips.

Awesome!!!! I just used a saucepan to make the whole thing and it turned out great! I used Bleu cheese instead of ranch and i used a little less than called for, and used extra Franks red hot buffalo sauce. I also used poached shredded chicken instead of canned... came out great!!

This is an absolutely favorite of ours! I've made it for all of my extended families and for football game parties and for work events and everyone raves about it and asks me for the recipe. It's extremely straightforward and easy to make. I prefer using chicken breast instead of canned chicken so I use a couple breasts and boil and shred them first. I combine the cream cheese, ranch dressing, hot sauce and cheddar cheese in the crock pot until smooth and then add in my chicken. Works wonderfully and is easy to transport.

We boiled and then shredded a few chicken breasts instead of using canned chicken.  Also, added a pinch of habanero to make it a bit spicier.  Served with Fritos.  Simply put, a great appetizer!

I've now made this twice and the first time I used ranch dressing and chicken breast that I cooked and shredded myself.  The second time I used blue cheese dressing and canned chicken.  I like the taste of the blue cheese better.  I'm not a fan of canned chicken, but it was okay in a pinch.  I used Frank's sauce, and it wasn't hot enough so I put in a few drops of XXX habanero sauce to kick it up and it's perfect.    Oh, also, I put all the ingredients in a small crock pot with the cream cheese and fresh shredded cheddar on the bottom.  I then just throw in the rest of the ingredients and stir it after the first half hour.  I then stir it again in another 30 minutes.  It's warm and ready to eat in another hour (so approximately 2 hours total) with tortilla chips.

I added more hot sauce (Franks buffalo sauce) and forgot my slow cooker at home- made at my parents house- so i baked it in a dish, but it came out great!  Very good with tortilla chips and celery.  Going to make in my slow cooker and bring to work next week.  Thanks!

I was a little worried about a funny taste due to the can chicken, however this was delicious!  I used pre-shredded cheese and it was not oily.  Not sure if it was due to it being 2%??  Very Good!

My sister-in-law made this version and it was amazing! She added more hot sauce then stated. My husband liked the idea of the one with blue cheese but I'm more of a ranch fan myself! Making it my new go-to appetizer! :)

I don't really fancy the canned chicken. So, I get 10 ounces or more of raw boneless skinless chicken and boil it with a touch of salt and pepper. It turns out sooo yummy!!

Excellent dip that is adjustable to personal heat levels.  I mixed all ingredients together in a skillet over low to medium heat to allow cream cheese to melt consistently - I absolutely HATE trying to mix anything with cream cheese, so this way proved to have less frustration for me.  After the cream cheese was evenly distrubuted throughout the chicken/sauce mix, I moved everything to a casserole dish, topped with remaining cheese and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Delicious!

Very good, easy to make! You can add some jalapeño juice to give it a little extra kick and keep that tangy flavor that makes this dip so good.

I just made this dip for a little get together and everyone loved it! I did divvy the cheddar to a 1/2 c. and 1 c. mozzarella cheese as I've usually only used mozz in this recipe before. The taste was great though and next time I'll use more cheddar.

Every time I make this the more I like it!  I melt the cream cheese on the stove top add in the ranch and shredded cheese then the wing sauce and chicken then transfer it to my warmer for parties.  Franks makes a "Buffalo" sauce that makes this EVEN BETTER!  This is a great recipe for a party or an afternoon snack (like the one my son and I just made :))

Very addictive and delicious.  Everyone loved it, including my 11-year-old daughter.  I served it with tortilla chips.  The only modification is that I used blue cheese dressing rather than ranch because I'm used to eating wings with B.C.  This dip would be excellent for Sunday football!  (Also, definitely use Frank's Red Hot if possible for the traditional wings taste.)

This is a great recipe if you are in a hurry.  The canned chicken saves a lot of time (just make sure you buy the all white meat chicken). I use Blue Cheese Dressing instead of ranch.

Just baked this - unfortunately I did not have a slow-cooker so I put it in the over at 180 for 40 minutes. It was delicious - but would probably had been better had I used the slow cooker, as it was a bit soupy.

This dip is great for parties, and it is sure to impress everyone! I used franks hot pepper sauce(buffalo wing) and wishbone ranch. I added more hot pepper sauce, because I preferred it more spicy. I served it with corn tortilla strips and small appetizer breads. FABULOUS!

I made this recipe this past weekend for the Florida / Georgia game.  I too poached chicken breasts and shredded the meat instead of using the canned chicken.  It was delicious and was huge hit!  I will definitely make this many, many more times.

I just made this recipe for my husband's surprise party and it was a HUGE hit.  Only change I made was that I made it in a crock pot for convenience sake.  I combined all ingredients except the cheese and put it on LOW for about 4-6 hours.  Just before serving, I added the cheese.  I served it with Fritos Scoops and everyone raved.  Thanks !!

Easy and always a hit at parties.  We always use a rotisserie chicken pulled apart for the meat.  Gives more flavor.

If I  could give this recipe 10 stars I would. I use 1/2 cup ranch and 1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing. I usually double this recipe. There is always cries for more. When I serve this to teenage boys there is NEVER any left. We always serve it with Tostitos scoops. Thank you for this recipe. It is a family and neighborhood favorite.

The flavor of the dip is fantastic, but the visual effect of the oils from the cheddar is stomach turning.  I had to sop the oil off with paper towels.  Honestly, the cheddar didn't seem to add to the flavor, so I think I will skip it next time.

YUM!!! I made a half recipe of this, and we devoured it!  I used low fat cream cheese and ranch and it still tasted great. After the crock pot, I poured it in a glass loaf pan then served with with Hint of Jalapeno tortilla chips. So good!

Yummy ... I Always used this at parties! I always used fresh chicken breats and cut it up in to bite size pieces. I tossed it in thepan with a little oil, garlic salt, and pepper then I follow the rest of the recipe. I also add 1 cup of celery... for those of you who life celery! But other than that this is one of my favorite recipes of all time

Made it for the first time yesterday and took it to a party...everyone loved it. Served with tortilla chips and celery.  I used the ranch dressing, but will try the Bleu cheese next time, it's an awesome appetizer. A must for any party.....ask me if you don't believe me

Made this for a 4th of July BBQ (a little late in reviewing it) & it was a hit!  I served it with corn tortilla chips.  The only thing I noticed was that it was very greasy once it baked so I may cut back on the cheese next time.  Also, if you or your guests are not a fan of spicey things, back off on the pepper sauce.  It was fine for me, but a quite a few ladies were mentioning that it was good, but too spicey!!

I would have rather made this with fresh chicken, but the canned chicken made life SO much easier! The recipe makes A LOT of dip, so unless you're having a big gathering... I'd say to cut the recipe at least in half.

yummy dip! yucky color, which only really seemed to bother me. I boiled 2 large chicken breasts then shredded them. Next time I may chop them up instead. Used half and half blue cheese and ranch. Franks red hot is my favorite hot sauce so I would recommend it. After baking does get a greasy layer on top just blotted off with paper towel and tossed back in the oven for 5 minutes. Used celery and tortilla chips to dip.

I used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch and simply microwaved everything until hot instead of cooking on the stove.  Served with raw celery, carrots, and crackers.

Great recipe.  I don't use canned chicken... I just parboil two or three breasts or use a rotisserie  from the store.  I also substitute ranch with blue cheese dressing a lot of the time.  But Very yummy and everyone likes it.

This is the perfect recipe for any night with a couple of friends! I like to up the hot sauce (I use Louisiana Crystal) to a full cup. I just soften the cream cheese in the microwave and mix all the ingredients together in a bowl (I like to use about a pound of fresh, boiled and shredded chicken breasts). Then I transfer to a baking dish and sprinkle with more shredded cheddar. Bake it for about 20 minutes on 350 or so and let it cool for a good 10 minutes. My friends and I crave this all the time! Perfect with Utz's tortilla chips!

I made a few alterations. I used shredded rotisserie chicken shredded and blue cheese dressing. I omitted all cheddar cheese and thought it tasted great.

I really do love this recipe.  It's a great alternative to wings (which my friends absolutely love), without all the mess.  I tried this recipe once without changing a thing -- it was delicious.  I then tried it with pan-fried thin-sliced chicken breasts instead of canned chicken.  I also used Frank's Red Hot Wings sauce for 1/2 cup, then Frank's Red Hot Extra Hot sauce for 1/4 cup -- turned out very well, but honestly, nobody would notice the difference except for those who are very particular about canned chicken (it's usually the smell that turns people off -- smells a lot like canned tuna!).  I've also done half Ranch/half blue cheese... either way is very good.  Bottom line is:  this is a great dip, and will undoubtedly be a hit at any get-together.  Enjoy!  Side note:  instead of crackers, this dip is great with tortilla chips!

This is easy and so delicious. My kids ask me to make this all the time. Sometimes I use low fat cream cheese and ranch dressing just to make it a little healthier, and it does not impact the flavor. This is one of our favorite things!

4 stars for this recipe as is - 5 stars if you use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. Add some crumbly blue when it's all done and you'll have the greatest dish.  Thanks Nunpunch!

I tried this and loved it! I made a few changes. I use slightly less hot sauce. I boil fresh chicken breast and shred it with a fork. Everything else I kept the same. My family and friends loved this! They request it all the time.

I make this dip for every party I go to, people have even requested I bring it to parties! Its a big hit whenever I make it, I use a rotisserie chicken instead of chunk chicken and sometimes like to use 1/2 c blue cheese and 1/2 ranch instead of all ranch. Its a great dip!

This dip is amazing!  I make my own changes, though.  I boil two chicken breasts instead of the canned, I use blue cheese dressing instead of Ranch, and the hot sauce I use is Nance's Chicken Wing Sauce.  I don't really measure the cheese, I just use a couple of handfuls.  I brought this to a party and heated up portions in the microwave and it was gone quick.  Remember to bring plenty of Fritos or tortilla chips.  Goes well with Ritz crackers too.  YUMMMMMMMMMM

I did like many others suggested and used chicken breast rather than canned. Also layered the ingredients and baked in the oven for 25 min at 350. I used Texas Pete wing sauce and only used 3/4 cup because I was worried about it being too spicy. Next time I think I'll use a full cup. This was yummy with celery and tortilla chips. A real crowd pleaser!

Fantastic. I make this pretty regularly because it's delicious and you can easily keep it in the fridge and heat up chunks of it over the next week to eat for snacks/lunch. I use a cup and a half of hot sauce, just mix the cheese in, and boil chicken before hand and then shred it with my hands. Also, I've made this several times for parties, and other reviewers keep complaining about the orange color but...no one has ever complained about the color? Oh well!

I've been making this for a few years now and every time it's soooo yummy!  I've made it with boiled/shredded chicken breasts, canned chicken and even a can of black beans to make a vegetarian option.  I always use Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce, neufchatel cheese, blue cheese instead of ranch and shred my own block 2% colby/jack cheese.  I would highly recommend like others shredding from a block, it really does cut down on the grease.   Enjoy!

I don't know what went wrong here, but none of my family liked this... it was way too thick and rich, and not very spicy .  It was almost unbareable to eat more than a few bites.

Big hit! I would recommend shredding your own cheese instead of buying already shredded. Someone already mentioned that the flour used on shredded cheese makes it greasier.

EXCELLENT dip!  Your guests will be hovering over this dish.  An alternative to the canned chicken -- buy a roasted chicken from the supermarket and shred it before adding to the recipe for a fresher taste.

Would probably give it 3 1/2 stars only because I changed the recipe considerably and it was excellent. Made this for superbowl last night and it was gobbled up. I used blue cheese dressing and boiled chicken breast (not into canned meat) and topped with parm/romano cheese as the cheddar didn't seem to go well with blue cheese. Baked it at 350 degrees and served with small slices of french bread to dip. Now with the little bit left, I am re-heating it in the oven topped with crushed chicken-n-biscuit crackers mixed in with melted butter. Smells great!

Made this for the Super Bowl and it was a hit!  I also used blue cheese dressing in place of the ranch which made for a perfect buffalo wing taste without the bones!

I also dislike canned chicken so I use store cooked rotisserie chicken and shredded it. Cut all other ingredients in 1/2, except hot sauce.

I love chicken wing dip, but some of this recipe doesn't sound too good.  It's way better if you use fresh chicken and then shred it....not yucky canned chicken (may be easier though I guess).  I also serve it with tortilla chips!

Great with corn chips! This is always a hit, even if I just make it for me and hubby!! However I have never used canned chicken...bake it till cooked through then shredded. Usually I have to at least double this recipe.

I pretty much mix it all up the day before (don't need to do all the step) and toss it in the frig. I put it in the pot on high about an hour and a half before I want it ready. I couldn't step away from the pot the first time I made it. Everyone loved it. It's not too spicy. I did use 12 oz cans of chicken to be more filling, but it taste great with 10 oz cans.

Was really great and simple! I made half the recipe and it still made a lot! I used fat free cheese, fat free cream cheese, and fat free ranch dressing and it still turned out great. I simply mixed everything together and cooked on 350 F for 20 minutes. Was perfect, will make again!

I make this exact recipe ALL THE TIME.  The only change I make is to decrease the hot sauce for my fiance because the first time it was way too spicy for him.  I bring it to potlucks and parties all the time and sometimes make just when we're sitting around the house watching football.  It is delicious!

This is the best dip ever.  I loved it because hot wings are so messy and this dip is not.  All the flavor of the real thing without messy hands.  Makes for a great entertaining appetizer.

I love this dip!  I make it all the time for work functions and parties.  I place everything in the slow cooker and just stir it occasionally until everything has melted.  Then I set it on Keep Warm and top with additional cheese.  I usually serve it with tortilla chips.  Super easy!

This was tasty! Fattening, but tasty. I used fresh rotisserie chicken that I had and extra Frank's hot sauce. Also blended the cream cheese with the ranch dressing with a mixer and stirred in the rest of the ingredients. Put all of it in a glass baking dish and baked for 30 mins. at 350. Great for parties! Everyone loved it~

This was good, but not great.  I don't get the crock pot thing because unless you've got a smallish one I just can't see this working in something so big.  A fondue pot perhaps.  I just left it in the saucepan on simmer and stirred occasionally.  It does, IMO, really need to be warm - I took a glob out of the pan to take into another room, it started cooling off, and it just wasn't any good that way.  I used both fat free cream cheese and cheddar cheese (as I always do), and the packaged ranch.  But other than the fat issue, I *though* I had made it as is.  Except several days later I was looking at the recipe again and realized I'd only used half the cream cheese - I think I was staring too much at that 8 oz instead of the 2 in front of it.  (That's a screw-up on the last two recipes I've done - getting senile I guess.)  But it still was pretty good anyway and I'd be curious what it's like with the proper amount.  Definitely thought it better on crackers and not on celery.  Can't say as I like the tortilla idea.  This whole recipe goes a long way.

A really terrific dip!  I served this as an appetizer on New Year's Day and it was well received.  I think I will try 1/2 cup of hot sauce the next time because it makes it pretty hot for us as well as salty.  I also prefer fresh chicken breasts that are steamed in water until cooked, cooled and shredded.  I also added some finely sliced celery to the mix.  Yummy!

A complete hit! I substitute the cans of chicken by simmering 2 whole boneless chicken breasts in chicken broth and garlic, for 10 minutes or until chicken is juicy and tender. I use 2 forks (one in each hand) to pull and shred the meat perfectly. I substitute the Ranch dressing with Bleu Cheese dressing. l don't measure the hot sauce, I only add to taste. In my humble opinion, I find that Texas Pete hot sauce adds less 'vinegary' taste than the other leading brand name hot sauce. The recipe does tend to have oils come to the surface. It may be the cheese or it may be the dressing. I just blot orangey oils with a paper towel and serve. This appetizers gets rave reviews everytime!

Awesome!  I made this for a game night & it was a hit.  Instead of canned chicken, I roasted one large split breast & used the meat from that.  I also added a bit more ranch & Franks Hot Sauce (maybe 2-3 T more each).  I also added a little chili powder- about 1 teaspoon.  Served it with celery sticks, carrot sticks & tortilla chips.  After heating everything together in the skillet, I transferred to a crockpot & kept it on warm... no problems.  Will definitely make again for New Years Eve get together.

Wow this was soooooo good! I made it for a football party and everyone loved it! I got many requests for the recipe! I didn't use canned chicken either. I've never had it before and I was too scared to try it now. lol! I made a big gumbo for the party so I just boiled 3 extra chicken breasts. Perfect amount. The only other thing I did different was I used more than 3/4 cup hot sauce, more like 1 1/4 cup. I also did not find the need to use all the cheese, I used just about a handful. I couldn't find Frank's so I ended up using Louisiana wing sauce, which was awesome! I threw it all in the slow cooker and didn't use the stovetop at all except to boil the chicken. I served it with Tostitos Scoops! Just writing this review makes me want to make some right now!

Delicious! I heated this in the microwave in a pyrex pie dish and it turned out great. This also was as good the next day reheated. Great with veggies and crackers. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, this was so easy and so tasty.

I was little worried using cans of chicken, but it turned out great. Everyone loved. I served it with Tostitos Scoops.

I used blue cheese dressing, baked/shredded chicken, added baked shrimp and a bit more hot sauce.  I also baked it on 350 for 20 minutes.  It is delicious.  Just delicious!

I used to make a layered version of this type of dip but couldn't find the recipe I used to use.  This recipe was so easy to make and was delicious!  The crowd couldn't stop eating it.  I had a decent spread of items to eat so there were many dippers to choose from.  Most people used tortilla chips to dip with, not the Chicken crackers or celery.

This dip is awesome, but like others I made changes. I used a Precooked Rottisserie chicken, and used 1C ranch, and 1C Bleu Cheese Dressing.

Outstanding! I served this at a company food sharing and was loved by all. I microwaved everything and put it in the crockpot since I did not have a stove. Worked out well.

This was pretty good, however, i followed other suggestions and used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and i thought that the blue cheese taste was pretty overpowering.  Next time i make this, i think i will try using ranch dressing.

This recipe was great.  Normally I stick to the recipe the first time making it but I strayed a little with this one.  As suggested I used shredded chicken breast (3), I only used 3/4 cup of ranch but instead of adding bleu cheese dressing and added 4 oz of bleu cheese crumbles.

Awesome dip! It does taste just like buffalo chicken wings. I made it for a big party and everyone loved it! I did layer it and baked it in the oven, however I ended up mixing it up after i tasted it, the blended ingredients worked better. I also used half ranch & bleu cheese and loved it, and i can't stand bleu cheese. Definitely would recommend using a good & spicy wing sauce though. I am making it again for a family party this weekend.

This dip is phenomenal! I make it for parties potlucks and it is *ALWAYS* a big hit. When I made it for my party here recently, the whole bowl of dip was gone by the end of the night and I had people asking for the recipe! It tastes SO good!

This is not my favorite dip, but bf really loves it, and everyone at the party we brought it to really enjoyed it as well.  I'd never made it myself but have had it at other parties.  Bf promised the hostess we'd make this, so I had to go hunting for the recipe.  This is the one!  We kept it in the crock pot as long as possible--this really needs to be served warm in my opinion.  I boiled chicken breasts instead of using canned chicken, which works very well.  Bf shredded the chicken for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe! I have made it several times and all were good. Used canned chicken and people still liked it, used fresh boiled chicken breasts and people loved it. Used rotisserie chicken and it was outstanding!! Next time I think I will try the blue cheese dressing. Yum yum!!!

Excellent dip.  I cooked and shredded my own chicken because I don't like canned and used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch.  It was a hit at a potluck and I had to hand out copies of the recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised by this.  I didn't think I'd like it but wanted to try it due to the really high ratings so I made it for my husband to take to a poker night.  I tasted it before and I was surprised at how delicious it was!  I added extra hot sauce because some said it had no spice.  Well it was super spicy so next time I'm definitely adding less but will for sure make again!

It tasted good, but came out way too oily. Next time I'll make it in the oven and use a block of cheddar like some others have suggestedd.

Wow, this was really good! Frank's Red Hot is the ticket to this one. I made it over at my mom's house the other day and she didn't have that brand. I used what she had on hand and it wasn't nearly as good. Now I know.

This is a fabulous recipe!  A few modifications:  
I use a rotisseri chicken from the grocery store instead of the canned chicken.  This saves time and it tastes so much better!  I also use monterey jack cheese along with the chedder cheese.  Before putting in the oven I sprinkle with Blue cheese crumbles.  You can also add some blue cheese dressing along with the ranch if you prefer the blue cheese flavor.

This dip is pretty much fantastic.  I got rave reviews at the party and multiple requests for the recipe.    Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce is a must use.  Something about Frank's just makes it taste like every wing you have had and love.  Also boiled bone-in fryer chicken parts, nothing beats that flavor.

My husband thought it was a five. I thought it was a four. So it's too bad I can't rate four and a half. I didn't use chicken because we didn't have any but it still tasted great on top of baked potato fries. Yummy. Will make again, for my hubby's sake.

Excellent. Instead of canned chicken (yuck!), I used fresh boneless/skinless chicken breasts and poached them in chicken broth. I also ground the chicken in the food processor afterward.  Will definitely make again!

This was really good.  I cut the recipe in half and used slightly more Franks Red Hot and slightly less dressing - and I mixed blue cheese and ranch because that sounded good.  People ate it up but it did seem to be a tad salty at the end.  Thanks for the post - it was fun football food.

Really good - perfect football game snack!  I followed tips of the other reviewers and 1) used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch, and 2) layered the dip rather than mix it all together.  The layered dip looked very attractive in a glass dish, and didn't turn as 'orange' as the other reviewer commented. A great recipe!

Like...but I think it needed more chicken or less cream cheese mixture. It was too thin to be my favorite, so i had to add a bunch of chicken...But overall, had a great taste.

I made this dip for a card party. It was very good and well received. However, I think the canned chicken gave it a slightly odd taste.  Next time, I will buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it.

Love it! I didn't bother putting it in the slow cooker and just let it simmer on the stove on low before serving.

This was a hit!!! I did make some changes which I highly recommend: I shredded one large chicken breast (boiled), used one 8oz light cream cheese, 1 16oz light ranch dressing, and about half a small bottle of Crystal hot sauce, served w. tortilla chips. Cooked on low in the crock pot until the cream cheese melted,then kept on warm during the football game. This was the perfect amount for 4 (including 2 men) to snack on during the f-ball game.

I love this recipe. This is a staple at any carry-in now, I've even had someone ask me to make it just so he can take it home. I make it at home all the time too, for Sunday's when the Colts play. When making it for myself, I add more hot sauce, but for anyone else, I go by the recipe. Not everyone likes it as hot as I do.

If I could give this more stars I would.  Have made this twice in under a week for 2 functions and have not had any leftover.    I basically kept the recipe the same but used low fat cream cheese and light blue cheese dressing and a rotisserie chicken almost the entire chicken... i just used my hands to shred it.  Will use this many times over.

This was great, we fumbled with the recipe a little using blue cheese instead of ranch, and we used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store instead of canned chicken and it was a huge hit. Next time I think we're going reduce the amount of cream cheese a little so it's a meatier dip and it definitely needs to be kept warm, right out of the crock pit is a good idea! - although it didn't last very long for it to cool much.

A friend gave me this recipe a couple years ago and it is always a huge hit at parties!  It is so easy and I have never had left overs!  I have used the canned chicken, which is great for last minute guests, and I have used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I usually just boil the chicken and shred it.  I'm always tempted to use blue cheese, but almost hate to mess with something everyone loves!  Maybe next time.  I serve it with tortilla chips and right out of the crock pot.  Great recipe!

Excellent Dip!  People wanted to lick the bowl, there was no dip left.  I did make modifications, I used real chicken and Blue Cheese dressing.  But you gave me the idea to make it, I would never have thought of it.  Thanks.

I love this dip at every party I taste it but have never gotten the recipe. I looked it up on here just yesterday and made it exactly as directed. OMG!!! It was waaaay better than any I've ever tried. Not sure what the difference is in the others I've tasted, but I'll never look for another. This is fantastic!!! There is a down side, though. We barely had any to bring home after the football party we went to  :(

Everybody wants the recipe and no matter how much I make it is not enough. I think the few people having problems with recipe are using cheap or low fat cheese that gets nasty when it melts

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because of the canned chicken. Everything about meat in a can does not sit well. :(  I boiled 2 pounds of chicken breast (cut into strips to boil)  I only used 1/2 cup fat free ranch (may use a little less next time), fat free cream cheese (with the other ingredients you can't tell the difference) and almost a whole cup of Texas Pete Chicken Wing Barbecue sauce.  I do bake it for 20 in the oven and then transger to a crock pot on warm for serving.  I served with tortilla chips and celery.  What a tasty treat at my football parties!  Heats up well the next day the next day too!  THANK YOU for the recipe!!  So much better and easier than wings!!

Made it for the game today, my small group of 5 polished off this HUGE serving by the end of the game! Everyone was RAVING! This recipe could easily be halved if needed. It does make a large portion and the oils separate so it doesn't reheat well...if it lasts that long.

I made this recipe exactly as is and found it delicious.  All our football fans found it perfect during the game!  I imagine it would still be wonderful with all the variations suggested, but why change if not necessary?  Thanks again it was a huge hit!!!

I have also been making this for years...the original recipe was only half as much and I had to double it (to proportions here) for our annual Christmas party--it was devoured!  Please be sure to use Frank's sauce...it just worked better than another brand I tried b/c I think it was a little thicker.

I have been making this dip for YEARS. During football season, my husband requests this dip every Sunday!  Not once have I ever brought this dip to a party and not had several requests for the recipe! I omit the Ranch dressing and only add one can of chicken so it is creamier.

i made this tonight for my husband to snack on while the football game was on (and to do a test run for a possible baby shower dip)... it was good! used a shredded rotissery chicken (canned chicken is too disgusting to even eat in my opinion) & i layered the ingredients rather than mixing them all together like some people suggested to make it 'look better' however, i thought that by layering everything there were some bites that tasted like nothing but cream cheese and ranch, and others that were just chicken and hot sauce. i'll mix it all together next time i make it. we use enough hot sauce in this that the color of the dip when mixed wont look like a pastel orange, it will be more true to the color of the actual hot sauce (not that it really matters). i liked dipping this with celery and french bread, my husband liked using ranch flavored dorritos. next time i make this i'll try it with bagel crisps and fritos!

Absolutely a hit!  I've made it a few times,once with Velveeta.  I only use one 8-ounce package of cream cheese, however.  I make it ahead of time, then heat in the oven instead of making in a slow cooker.  Easy and a big hit with teenagers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've been making this dip for over a year now.  It gets rave reviews each and every time.  Many people have asked for the recipe.  I follow the recipe exactly except for using blue cheese dressing in place of the ranch.

Update on 4/16/11:  Made this for my son recently and he replied that it's like crack cocaine!  (I won't ask how he knows that.)  Anyway, it is still the best reciped I've made in a long time!!   Original review:  We served this at this year's July 4th get-together and it was great.  I've made it with blue cheese dressing & with ranch and the ranch is better even though I love blue cheese.  We served with celery sticks, crackers and even some Tostitos scoops.  Yum!

I am always asked to bring this dip to the party- it is a huge hit. I layered it like others suggested, so I mix the cream cheese with half ranch and half blue cheese. Then I top with the chicken / sauce mixture and bake it. I use Franks Buffalo Sauce instead of the Red Hot, and I also use a rotisseree chicken or pre cooked chicken- never canned. I also omit the cheese, I don't think it's needed. I serve with blue corn chips and celery. Delicious!!

Someone made this at a BBQ a couple weeks ago and I knew I'd be able to find it on here.  So I made it this weekend for son's bday cookout.  Only thing I changed was used a full cup of hot sauce (we like spicy)and blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  Was a huge hit!!  Not a drop leftover (which I was kind of disappointed about lol).  Served with tortilla scoops and celery sticks.  mmmmm

I took this in for a potluck at work and it didn't go over well. I think it would be better with freshly cooked chicken breats rather than canned chicken. I thought it was ok but I doubt I will make it again.

Easy and Delicious!  I substitute cooked chicken breast for the canned chicken and use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  I put all ingredients in my Pampered Chef 2 quart mixing bowl and microwave for about 2 minutes (until everything is melted) stirring half way between and then transfer everything to my crock pot. Serve with crackers, corn chips or celery and carrots.  It's always a hit and always gone fast!!!

When I make this my friends and family cannot stop eating it until it's gone...I did however change a little about the recipe! First I boil 3-4 boneless chicken breast, then shred. While chicken is boiling I cut up 2 8oz blocks of cream cheese in crock pot to heat and soften up. Add the chicken then mix in a whole medium size bottle of Franks Red Hot and a large bottle of Hidden Valley Ranch drsg. After that I added about a bag of shredded cheddar cheese. Mix frequently or the sides burn. Eat w/ tortilla scoops to hold the chicken...you'll run out of chips and dip!

I too subbed bleu cheese for ranch and used fresh chicken breasts. This dip turned out DELICIOUS. I made it for Superbowl this year and everyone loved it! I thought the chicken tasted a little wierd in the dip though, so I probably would just omit it next time. You get the drift of the taste if you just used everything else and use chicken flavored crackers and celery to dip

This recipe is GREAT!  I make in the crockpot and it is perfect to take to work for a carry-in, to a party or even to have at home.  My family loves it with celery sticks, but the chicken crackers are also great!  Thanks for submitting this.

I used bleu cheese dressing because I don't like ranch and also baked it in an oven instead of a slow cooker, as suggested by someone else. About 20 minutes at 350. Served with tortilla chips and crackers.

This was a good recipe but to be honest the chedder cheese just sounded weird to me so I came up with this alernative recipe.  1 lb chicken, cooked and shredded, 8oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup ranch dressing, 5oz crumbled blue cheese, Tabasco sauce to taste (about 1/4 cup).  Place cream cheese, hot sauce and ranch dressing in a sauce pan and cook over medium heat until cream cheese is melted, stirring to combine. Taste and add more tabasco if desired. Mix in blue cheese and chicken.  Transfer to baking dish and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

I wish I could give this 10 stars!  I made this for the superbowl for just my family and even my kids ate it.  I froze the rest and thawed it when I had company a few weeks later.  They loved it and I gave them the recipe.  I baked chicken breasts instead of using canned and I also used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. I will be making this again and again!

We are snacking on this right now.  This is definitely man food as my teenage son loves it and my husband keeps going back for more too.  I have to say that it does taste like buffalo chicken but it's leaving a sort of greasy feel in my mouth that I don't like.  I used block cheese as recommended by the top rated review but still had to blot the dip with paper towels when it came out of the oven to reduce the oiliness on top.  Instead of using the slow cooker, I mixed everything together as instructed and baked it in an 8x8 pan for about 20 min. at 350*.  Served with Sociables crackers and celery.  If I make this again for the guys, I will cut the recipe in half but still bake it in the 8x8 pan so that, as my husband just said, there will be "cheese in every bite."

I halved the recipe - layered as stated by a previous reviewe, then baked at 350 until bubbly. Served with celery and it is really good.  Who knew - it could be this easy.

Neither myself nor my husband cared for this dip.  I suppose I could blame part of the reason for this due to the fact that I used canned chicken. It was an ugly, orange greasy color.  The blue cheese dressing was overpowering. If you don't love blue cheese then you might prefer the ranch dressing.

LOVE IT!!!!! This is probably the best recipe for buffalo chicken dip. I did change the ranch dressing to chunky blue cheese dressing and I used 1/2 fat cream cheese. I also doubled the recipe for the super bowl party and it was gone before half time! Great recipe overall.

Yum!  Sooo good!  Tastes just like a chicken wing and perfect on a celery stick!  I did modify, however, using traditional Buffalo wing ingredients: I used shredded chicken thigh meat, 1/3 less fat cream cheese, Bob's bleu cheese dressing (instead of ranch), Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce and omitted the cheddar cheese.  I topped it with a few more dashes of wing sauce and sprinkled bleu cheese crumbles over that to make it look nice.  I agree the color is not the most appetizing, but if you love Buffalo wings like I do, you won't care.

This dip is amazing! Soooo good! I used fresh chicken, 3 breasts that I boiled for 15 minutes and then shred and chopped real small, and followed the other directions as stated in the recipe. But I baked it 350 for 25 minutes instead. I didn't think these were too hot at all and I have weak tolerance for spicy foods. I think I might throw in an extra dash of Franks next time. I served it with celery sticks and scoops. I had chicken in a biscuit crackers but noone cared for them with the dip. While the dip was awesome it was slightly unappealing in the looks department. The cheese made the dip really oily, but it tasted so good it didn't matter.

I got RAVE reviews about this dip.  I (like other reviewers) did not use canned chicken, I hate canned meat also.  So I boiled chicken and then shredded it by hand before putting everything in a saucepan.  The only difference is that I used 1 stick cream cheese and 1 cup sour cream.  Just for variety.  This was gone in about 10 minutes and everyone asked for seconds.  Too bad I didn't make enough!

I made this for my husband's Super Bowl potluck. I tried it before I sent it off with him. So good. I would definately use shredded chicken breast in this recipe. So you have more of the chicken flavor in it. We served with Tostitos.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I have made it for a few years, and always get a ton of compliments.  Yes, the canned chicken doesn't have the most pleasant smell when you open it, but it's wonderful in this dip.  Also, I would definitely stick with the ranch dressing, as the recipe states.  Blue cheese might be great for dipping wings in, but it's no wonder some people don't eat it after people substitute it--I'm not a fan of blue cheese, and would not try it in the dip.  If you want a perfect dip, make it the exact way it is stated.  Also, the chicken flavored crackers (i.e., Chicken in a Biscuit) is the best way to eat this dip--it rounds out the flavors.  I would also recommend Hidden Valley for the ranch dressing--I used Kraft one time, and it did not have the same yummy results.

I typically cook this recipe from start to finish on the stovetop, skipping the slow cooker step. I turn the heat to low, add the rest of the cheese, and stir the mixture until the cheese has completely melted. The finished product is easily transfered to a serving dish. I serve this dip with tortilla chips in lieu of the suggested crackers and use 1 cup of pepper sauce (instead of the 3/4 cup suggested) to add a little more spice. Absolutely everyone who tastes this dip asks me for the recipe. Summer, Winter, Spring or Fall, this dip is a HIT!

The only difference I made was using 3-4 medium chicken breasts (skinless) instead of the canned chicken.  Spicing the chicken while it is cooking with garlic, pepper, cayenne and worcestershire sauce.  I also use a full cup of Red Hot.  This has been a crowd favorite since I began making it last February.

DO NOT USE CANNED CHICKEN!!  I did, only to give it a fair shot as written -- BIG mistake.  I almost decided to toss it before I even baked it (imagine TUNA w/Frank's Wing Sauce -- eeeyooou!)-- but I went ahead & baked it (in the layered format) just to see....GLAD I DID -- cuz I will DEFINITELY do this again with fresh chicken breast that I saute/shred w/the Frank's.  Even with the quasi-tuna thing  going on from the canned chix, it's not half bad.  With fresh chicken, I'm sure it's a keeper.

Great dip, everybody loves it.  This makes a hardy portion. I would suggest starting with 1/2 C. hot sauce and adding more according to your taste.

This recipe kicks some serious butt! It's great football food (I actually just whipped up a batch while watching the NFC Champ game) I do make some minor adjustments: I use diced chicken that i cook myself instead of canned. This time I actually had left over turkey so i used that and you can barely tell the difference. Also, I use a pre-made buffalo sauce and only a couple splashes of Frank's. I love that recipe has familiar flavors and presents them in a new fun way. Also this is great for parties since eating regular wings is a messy affair this really cuts down on the dirty finger and all those bones. I highly reccomend this for super bowl!!

Fabulous dip! Easy to do! I followed a few reviewers suggestions and used skinless, boneless chicken breasts in place of the canned chicken. Just simmered them for 15 to 20 minutes till cooked through, then chopped them up into very tiny pieces. Also added a 1/2 stick butter as another suggested. I made my ranch dressing using Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix and followed the pkg directions. It is very spicy but buffalo wings are suppose to be very spicy so it lives up to expectations. This excellent dip has been added to my standard recipes

My family make this dip all of the time.  My nieces have renamed it BCD.  We use a whole cup of hot sauce and a cup of blue cheese dressing.  We also use boneless, skinless chicken breast that we cook and chop.  Much better than canned.  We don't put the cheddar cheese on top, because we always serve it in a crock pot and the cheese on top isn't necessary.  We serve with Frito Scoops along with the celery. Great dip!  We crave it and usually make a double batch.

I used the ranch dressing but instead of putting it in a slow cooker, I put 1 cup of cheese in the mix and then transferred it to bake in the oven with another cup of cheese on top for 15 min or so on 375. I've tried this recipe both ways and loved it in the oven.

I mixed together the cream cheese & blue cheese dressing and spread it into a serving plate. Then I mixed together the shredded chicken and hot sauce and put on top on the cream cheese. I sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar and baked for 20 minutes. Delicious with celery or crackers!

Everyone loved it at a party. I made it in a covered casserole dish.  I used about half or 2/3 the cream cheese and only about 1/4 of the cheddar cheese.  I poached the chicken then shredded it.  Onions might go well in the dip.

I was so excited about making this recipe as we love hot wings and I thought for sure this would be a definite keeper.  I made this as written and didn't make a test batch before the evening of the event that I planned to bring the dip to, due to such high ratings.  I've decided that maybe I just don't care for dips with so much cream cheese in them...?  However, nobody at the gathering I attended liked the dip either.  I took nearly the whole batch of BCD home with me and now I don't know what to do with it.

Fabulous dip.  I made this on Boxing Day and everybody loved it.  I used the Kraft Italian cheese blend (all I had on hand) and it was great.

I halved this recipe and I'm sorry I did, everyone just loved this dip. I did boil some chicken rather than the canned chicken. Served with tortilla chips and it was requested that I make it again next weekend when the football games are on.

My famiy and friends like buffalo to be really hot.  I modified the recipe to reflect this.  I now put 1 1/2 bottles of the hot sauce in it while cooking the chicken.  This has resulted in a lot hotter dip for our taste.  The original recipe is also good... but if you like it hot I recommend putting more in to suit your taste.  It will come out wonderfully!!!

I never have any leftovers when I make this and I always double the batch.  It's great!

I could not make this recipe the way it was called for. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and only half a cup of blue cheese dressing. Now, I enjoy my unhealthy dips and dishes, but this was almost too much for me to enjoy. I love buffalo wings, and was willing to forget how fattening it was for something that tasted amazing, but this isn't amazing. It's good, but to me, not worth it.

Served for an engagement party, everyone loved it!  Replaced the ranch dressing with Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing from this site and the canned chicken with leftover turkey that I had frozen. Loved the celery with this more than the crackers. Would definitely make again.

This was easy to make and absolutely delightful! It was a huge hit of my dinner party. I made mine with left over rotisserie chicken and did not use the cheddar cheese. The recipe  asked for by several people.

Yummy, I make a simmiler recipe (especally for when I am sticking with my low carb diet) But I use blue cheese dip instead of ranch. I also add some mayo. I dont like the chicken in the dip, I grill chicken tenders and use them to dip along with oven dried Josephs low carb pitas and veggies.

Made this for a party last night and it was a hit! People kept coming up to me asking what the spicy crab dip was. I had to explain that it was buffalo chicken, but by the end of the evening, the bowl was empty and there was a TON of food to choose from. So, I would say it was a success!

Either you love this or hate it. Personally I thought it was way too rich and couldn't eat it, but I gave it 5 stars because my guest raved about it and ate the whole thing. (Don't forget to add a bottle of Tums to your shopping list! lol!)

OMG.  I layered this dip as previously suggested, and also used blue cheese dressing.  WOW!  This is FANTASTIC! And soooo easy... Thank you!  I baked it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  I can't wait to make it again!

Very good. I used homemade ranch dressing and added just a little of the homemade dressing mix on top of the ranch dressing for a little boost of flavor. I also used sharp white cheddar. 

I'd make this again. The husband inhaled this and wondered if I'd make another batch soon. I'm thinking I might throw a half batch in the Crockette just for him every Pizza Night.

Excellent dish for a party starter.  I prefer to add all of the cheddar to the mix instead of topping the dish with cheddar.  The cooked cheddar is a little hard to get a cracker into.

I love this but we make it a little different. We put the cream cheese on the bottom of a dish then put the chicken/blue cheese/hot sauce on top of the cream cheese and cover with cheese. Bake in the oven until it bubbles.

This was awesome! I didn't use canned chicken though, since I don't really like it. I boiled a couple of boneless, skinless chicken breasts in chicken broth instead. I also didn't mix the cream cheese and chicken mixture together, but next time I might, because they get mixed when you eat it anyway. But really, if you like buffalo chicken, you've GOT to try this. I was even thinking that using frozen breaded chicken fingers would work, too. Just chop them up and mix them with the sauce. Awesome recipe!

THIS IS THE BEST, most Awesome!!  This is just like eating Buffalo Wings!

We use Tortilla Chips and add chopped onions to ours!  It was delicious - the kids and the adults couldn't get enough!

I made this for Sunday's Packer game and it was a hit.  I put everything in a crockpot and served it with tortilla chips and celery.  A couple people commented that it was addicting.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it was GREAT!

I've made this dip about 5 times now and the last time I made it someone stole the recipe right out of my hand.  
The one thing I do based on the other reviews is use 1/2 the amount of Frank's Red Hot Sauce and add in 1/2 regular buffalo wing sauce such as Moore's brand - it's always a hit and goes very fast.

Fantastic! Only changes I made were: fresh chicken, not canned (this is a MUST); a little less hot sauce; a little more ranch. PERFECT! Many, many compliments and requests for recipe!

I just made this for a tailgating party and put it in a aluminum bread pan and reheated it on the grill- it was a hit!  I also serve with totilla chips, the scoop kind, instead of the chicken crackers and everyone loves it!

I think if you like hot sauce you'll love this recipe.  I will actually make it when I know I am going to have a night to myself to just watch movies and pig out.  I LOVE this stuff, it is one of my favorite things to bring to a party.

Great recipe for tailgating! I used three large boneless, skinless breasts which I boiled, cooled, then threw in a food processor. This fine consistency was great for a dip. I also used twice as much Texas Pete buffalo wing sauce. (Okay, this was a little much, and next time I'll probably use 1 cup. 3/4 c. seemed insufficient, but 1.5 c. was a little strong.) I also warmed the dip in casserole dish in the oven. I will make this for the guys again, but will leave off the cheese topping, and maybe omit it altogether. You cannot taste the cheese, and I'm not sure what this even adds to the recipe. Anyway, what does cheddar cheese have to do w/ the taste of buffalo wings? All in all, this dip was a hit, and the recipe yields enough to feed a large group of strapping young men and then some.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it for the first time just now and it came out great!  I used 8 oz. of cream cheese and 8 oz. of sour cream (I didn't have enough cream cheese) and I added a little more cheddar cheese to the top of it.  I also added only about 1/4c, of the Ranch because I thought it was seeming a little loose.  I put it in my little dipper slow cooker and it's perfect.  I could eat the it all myself!  Definately a keeper!

I did not care for this recipe. I think something went wrong with the hot cream cheese; there was just SO much of it.  This will not be a repeat.

This dip is excellent! It does taste just like buffalo wings. I cut the recipe in half and used all reduced fat ingredients. I didn't really measure the cheddar cheese, instead I just mixed in a good size handful and instead of sprinkling cheddar on top of the dip I sprinkled some blue cheese crumbles on top. Great dip! I didn't use canned chicken instead I used the kind in the foil pack.

Ok, so it's not the most healthy thing but it sure is good! I prefer to shred some "real" chicken but the canned chicken isn't bad. I've made this for a wedding I catered and for work luncheons. Everybody loves it and many ask for the recipe. Make sure you get the chicken flavored crackers, they really "set it off".

This is by far the biggest hit I've ever made.  I did make it as a layer dip - used ranch dressing and softened cream cheese (blended) as the first layer, boiled (with grill seasoning and onion powder)shredded chicken smothered in Frank's Buffalo sauce as the second layer, topped off with shredded cheddar and baked at 350 for about 20ish minutes.  Fabulous served with Frito's scoops and celery sticks.

I've made this dip for a couple of parties, and it's been a hit! I prefer to use celery sticks or plain crackers for dipping; the chicken-flavored crackers are a bit much with this dip.

This dip is really good.  Tried it for the first time for a backyard BBQ/party and it was a hit....the only dish that was completely gone by the end of the party!  I made it in a slow cooker so that it would stay warm all evening, and that worked out perfect.  The only thing I changed was that I served it with tortilla chips instead of the chicken flavored crackers.  Mmmmmmm!

This dip is super addictive! Everyone always loves it. I do like to decrease the cheese to one cup though since it gets quite greasy on top, but you could always just blot some off with a napkin before serving! It's also great with tortilla chips

Everyone always asks for the recipe whenever I make this.  Added a little more sauce for extra spiciness and some extra chicken that I leave chunky for added texture.  Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

I made this exactly as it was written, and did not care for it at all.  I think it was the canned chicken that threw me off, something about meat in a can freaks me out.  I will try again with REAL chicken! EDIT 9/19/08 - I made this dip again, with grilled chicken breast.  It was extremely good, much better than with the canned chicken.  I am giving this another star, for a total of 4!

I make this all the time. Even in smaller batches just to have as a snack for myself when watching TV. 

The only recommended change I suggest is to use torilla chips instead of crackers when I serve it. I have tried to make it with blue cheese dressing as others had suggested in their reviews, but I find I like it much better when I just stick to ranch as the recipe stated. 

Be very careful not to use too much Frank's Red Hot sauce as then it seperates from the dip and it looks really unappetizing.

This dip is the one thing everyone asks me to bring to cookouts or get togethers.  I did add blue cheese dressing, as well as ranch and it tasted great.  Also, I do these in a slow cooker and just mix everything together.  I only put a small sprinkling of shredded chedder cheese in the dip, as it seems to get oily with more.  Love it!

Everytime I make this dish I have at least five people ask me for the recipe!  I usually cook it first on the stove and then when it's really hot, I pour it into a small crock pot and serve it-that way it stays hot and fresh.  I also serve it with sliced, fresh baguette bread and celery from the local grocery store.  Sooo good!

Very good recipe-once I experimented.  i followed the advice of some other members to layer it for a nicer appearance and found it too hot that way.  All you could taste was the hot sauce and heat!!!  Also, I took this to a cookout and the cheese on top became hard sitting out.  I ended up mixing the leftovers together and microwaving that.  Much much better!!  Spciy, but not over the top-the flavors had a chance to melt together making a much more palatable dip.  Will make again!

I bring this to just about every family party.  We love it with the ranch dressin, but love it more with blue cheese - just depends on what flavor you like beter. Everything else is exactly as submitted- great recipe!

I made this tonight and it was a hit!  I only used about half the amount of cheddar cheese, and I didn't have any problems with it being greasy.  I also prepared it ahead of time, put it in an 8x8 baking dish and stuck it in the fridge until 30 minutes before my party, then I baked it for 30 minutes at 350.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a fantastic dip but I alter the recipe a little bit to fit my taste, that's why I've given it 4 stars.  I don't like canned chunk chicken so I cook my own and shred it,  I prefer the shredded consistency.  Also I use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. It's really fantastic!!!

I use fat free cream cheese, ranch, and low fat cheddar. Also, it's easier to buy chicken tender cut chicken so it can be cut up. I also use fat free club crackers to make this dish as healthy as possible!

i loved the dip! If you don't have chunked chicken, you can use two chicken breasts if you are  making half a recipe. it is harder, but also convenient if you tear the chicken into small strips. i didn't have cheddar, so i substituted montery jack and parmesan. i would also use Ritz. (:

This dip is a hit at any kind of sports party! I have gone through a lot of trial and error with this recipe though:  The first time I made it I layered it and baked it in pan.  It cooled off too fast and made one big clump.  The second time I put it in the slow cooker and it became really greasy and separated.  Now I keep it in the slow cooker, but I use the Velveeta shreds.  They melt great and don't get all greasy like reg. cheddar cheese does.  I also use cut up rotisserie chicken, and add crumbled blue cheese.  The hubby loves it with the Chicken In a Biscuit crackers.

The cheddar cheese makes this extremely oily. I have tried many different combos and have found that Maries Bleu Cheese dressing, Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce and mozzarella instead of cheddar is best (waaaaay less greasy). When I used the canned chicken, it had a tendency to get "lost" so I have started to use fresh chicken that I boil/bake and the shred. If taking to a party, I will put in a crock pot (layering w/ cream cheese on very bottom, then chicken, hot sauce, mozzarella and finally dressing). The chicken wing dip idea is great, but I had to play around with this quite a bit.

Great Recipe.  I use Blue cheese and cooked chicken in mine, and serve it with tortilla chips and philly soft pretzels, cut into bite size chunks.

I really liked this dip, but I would add more chicken. I did add a lot more cheese and hot sauce to thicken it up and make it hot enough for me, which is why it may have needed more chicken. I will definitely make this again.

I make this dip A LOT - except we boil chicken breast and shred them... and use Franks buffalo wing sauce... and bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch... and tortilla chips instead of crackers - so a few changes, but its the best dip you will ever taste.

This was an incredible hit for poker nite!!!  I did substitute bleu cheese dressing for the ranch, and it did taste just like a chicken wing! We didn't bring any home with us.  This should be on everyones' list of party essentials.  Thanks for the great recipe.

One of my husband's favorites.  The only downfall is you really need to keep this one hot or it just gets oily.  It's not a dip you can leave on a table, you really need a mini crock pot or something to keep it hot.

I made this for a family get together.  Everyone LOVED it.  We used celery sticks and tortilla chips for dipping. (We liked it better than the Chicken crackers recommended.) This recipe is definately a keeper!

This is the dip that everyone at my party wanted the recipe for...they all loved it!  It is so good & so easy to make.  I served it at room temperature & did not add the cheese on top.  I also served it with Carr's Table Water crackers...yum!

yum! I did do it a little different. I used shredded chicken; I had cooked in a crock pot over night. Also I added garlic salt and instead of chedder, I used colby/jack cheese. If by chance you have any left over, its even better the next day cold!!

Fantastic dip. I use Louisiana hot sauce and I'm still trying to perfect the proportion of that to make it just right. After I made this once this is the only dish I'm allowed to bring to parties now! No matter how hot I make it everyone comes back for seconds, thirds, tenths!

I love this recipe!! I too added more Franks Red Hot to mine and also did the layering and it was wonderful!!!  Instead of celery or crackers I serve Tortilla chips with it and everyone loves it!  I also used a cheese with less chedder in it for thelack of melting reason and I also used mroe than it called for (I love my cheese)!  I'm thinking of adding a layer of jalepenos into it next time...

This is great.  Our friends always request it for parties & practically lick the crock pot clean when it's gone.  I omit the cheese since so many people have commented that it makes the dip greasy.

This recipe is great! I love it. I have made it for my boyfriend and my family and they all loved it. I used Sweet Baby Ray's hot buffalo wing sauce and marinade and it was great. I had a kick but isn't too spicy for those of you who do not like it firey hot!

Every time I make this recipe, I get rave reviews!  I use blue cheese dressing, add real blue cheese, and use Frank's Wing sauce (I use a whole bottle- but I like it spicy!).  I keep it heated in a crock pot.  My entire family has asked for this recipe- always a hit.  Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe was great. I made a few changes I used all blue cheese dressing and substituted sour cream for one cream cheese. I also added a little more buffalo sauce then the recipe called for. Also, if you like spice, add a few jalapeño peppers. I took it to a holiday party and everyone loved it.

This turned out pretty well, I was sceptial about trying it since it doesn't look all that yummy, but needless to say, by the end of the evening it was scraped totally clean!

This can also be made in the oven. Cook chicken and mix well with hot sauce. Cook cream cheese and dressing in a pan till combined. Pour over chicken and mix well. Cook 20 min on 350. Top with cheese cook 10 more min.

I have been making this dip for years, and everyone loves it! I almost always get requests for the recipe. When my crockpot is not availible, I have baked in a 9 x 13 just until bubbly, and it works fine.

Had it at our super bowl party and the adults loved it! I especially liked it with the chicken biscuit crackers. It was to spicy for the kids but oh well that just means more for the adults! I used shredded chicken breasts that I had cooked in the oven on 350 for about 20 minutes. I just don't like the canned stuff. I also used half ranch and half blue cheese, not a morsel left....I think someone licked the bowl.

The canned chicken really ruined the taste of this dip. When I ate around it, it was fabulous. Next time, I'll skip the chicken and go straight for the good stuff!

This has quickly become a "must have" for all sporting event get togethers at my home.  It's also a quick weekend snack for the family anytime.

GREAT recipe!

Ok, first of all - I am the superstar of the office for making this!! They will be rollong out the red carpet for me at EVERY potluck from now on! Second of all - this was absolutely delicious and anyone who DOESN'T like it needs to go to the doctor and get their tastebuds checked!! Third - I used rotisserie chicken from the deli department instead of canned chicken (i'm with others on that one!) and I did not sprinkle cheese on the top - everything else stayed the same. I may try blue cheese next time, but "if it ain't broke - don't fix it!". The cheese makes it a little greasy, but this should be bottled and sold!!!!!!

Huge hit over Christmas.  Will be making for super bowl party as well.  YUMMY!  Also had the idea of making it a little thicker and putting it in a a puff pastry crust like a mini pillow of Buffalo chicken dip.  DH also likes it on a hamburger bun.

Made for a party and everyone loved it!  Used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  Also used extra chicken which turned out to be best because it would have been too much cream cheese without more.  Was so yummy - thanks for a great one!

I loved it and so did the guys watching the big game.  I put it in my electric fondue pot to keep it warm and I'll do it again.  It worked great.  The only thing I would do differently is use freshly cooked chicken and more of it.

I made this recipe for the first time and EVERYONE loved it. I think the key to the hot sauce is to put in as much as you like. I used about half what the recipe called for and it was perfect. I don't like things really really spicy so it was great. Very easy!!! Oh-I also baked my chicken breasts and shredded them instead of using canned chicken.

I used cooked chicken breast and ranch dressing as variations.  I can only give this recipe 3 stars.  It didn't really go.  Perhaps it was the crowd ~ my kids didn't like it and all but one grandparent thought it was too spicy.  My husband thought it was "too creamy".  I thought it was just okay.  If I make it again, I'd surely cut the recipe in half as there was way too much.

My favorite dip of this kind yet.  I added all of the cheddar into the mix, then turned the heat off and moved into the oven in an 8x8 pan.  Baked at 350 for a half hour instead of finishing in the crock pot.

Good stuff.  I made this for New Year's Eve and doubled the recipe.  Everyone loved it.  It was just like eating a buffalo chicken wing.  I should add that I used the Tyson pre-sliced chicken strips in the deli section instead of boiling any chicken. I also tried to shred that as it cooked in the hot sauce and it turned out awesome!!
Thanks for the great recipe.

I've made this loads of times, and people scrape the bottom.  First of all, I use bleu cheese dressing.  Secondly, I chop up celery (about a cup) and mix that into the dip.  I've served it in a small crock pot...the celery will lose some of its crunch this way after a long time of cooking in there, but still adds something.  It adds crunch and a little lightness (and makes more dip!) Lastly, I serve it with crackers AND celery sticks.  The celery is my favorite way to dip it because it's lower guilt and just tastier than crackers.

This was one of the best recipes to come from this site. I made the following changes per other reviews: I used a pound of ground turkey instead of the canned chicken, and browned it before addig Franks Wing sauce.....Half a bottle was perfect. I also substituted blue cheese dressing for the ranch, and I think it halped make this spectacular. I layered this dip with the cream cheese on the bottom, and put the grond turkey on top, with a sparse amount of cheese on top. I served this right out of the oven and served it on a warming tray to keep it the right temperature. Placing tortilla chips on the side in an oven-safe bowl made for the perfect touch....Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!

It was OK.  I am real picky about chicken.  My guests liked it but my advice would be to make it a little more spicy and to not used canned chicken.  I am not a fan of canned chicken.  I think it tastes like cat food.  Otherwise a great appetizer.

This recipe was delicious!!  I made this recipe for a New Year's Eve get together and everyone loved it!  I did make a couple of changes to it, as many other people have also.  Instead of ranch dressing, I used bleu cheese.  I also did not add the cheddar cheese to it, which caused it to be barely greesy.  My husband can't wait for me to make this recipe again!  A definite 5 stars!!

I love this recipe. I've brought it to a few functions and it's gobbled up. Here are my changes though. For a single batch, I use 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts & bake them with some salt & pepper in the oven. Then I cut them into a few pieces each and toss them into my food processor. That way when you mix the chicken with the cream cheese & rance it's more of a consistent texture. Also I only use about 1/2 cup of Frank's & serve it with Tostitos scoops.

Yummy! Super easy and it was a hit! I  decided to cook chicken tenders,hot sauce and butter in a pan then shredded the chicken. I layered the dip and it was very good! Will make for Super Bowl Sunday. Thanks!!!

Made this exactly as written and it turned out fabulous!  I took it to a party for New Years, and someone there had made something similar for Christmas.  We didn't find it unappetizing in color, I really enjoyed the blended flavors.  Great recipe!

I am from Buffalo and true Buffalo wings are served with blue cheese dressing, NEVER ranch.  For the real deal substitute blue cheese (preferably Marie's in the jar).

Everyone loved it, the only thing I would change is more chicken. I would double the chicken.  The chicken inside the can is great but it shreds easy and melts into the dish when baked. They didn't even know there was chicken in the recipe but they loved it.

Ugh!  I usually agree with the overall rating but this recipe was just not right.  I used some of the suggestions from other reviews - blue cheese and  layering - and it just was icky.  I made it for a party and the people that are usually excited to eat my appetizers thought it was just strange.  I think you have to use diced chicken instead - it might improve matters.  Great idea but lost something in the translation.

At first I wasn't sure how well this would come out, so I made some adjustments per previous reviews. Used diced chicken breast instead of canned chicken. I also added the shredded cheese into the mix instead of sprinkling some on top. My husband loved it and even people like me who don't usually eat spicy foods kept coming back for more. This is a keeper!

this was so good!  I basically halved this recipe and it was wonderful.  Instead of hot sauce, I used some wing sauce that we had purchased from one of the wing restaurants.  This is so delicious, we all loved it and will make it again, soon!
Thanks for posting it.

This is phenomenal! The only thing I would watch is the amount of hot sauce~ kids may not like it as spicy. Other than that, this dip is great.

This recipe is awesome! I made some small alterations by cutting up the celery in small pieces and mixing in the dip, used blue cheese instead of ranch dressing, and added a bit more hot sauce. It was a hit!

I was hesitant to try this because some of the reviews made it sound like a greasy mess.  I have now made it twice in the last week and it was a total success both times!  I followed the recipe with just one variation, I used buffalo sauce instead of hot sauce.  I am now looking forward to trying some of the other variations because I can see how this could be good in so many different ways!!!!  TRY THIS RECIPE!

The dip was a little thick for my liking.  The first time I had it was at a dinner party and it was a little thinner.  I looked up a recipe on allrecipes and tried this one.  Not sure what alterations I'll make next time to thin it out, but it's a keeper.  It still tasted great.  I too used fresh chicken rather than canned.  Canned meat is a little scary if you ask me!

Sooo easy and definitely the HIT of the party!!!  It's crazy how such a simple dip can completely impress so many people.  I give a big thumbs up to the canned chicken, but I have yet to try it with shredding chicken breasts.  I also made mine as a huge, double batch in the crock pot, but I will likely try to layer it next time b/c mine STILL got a film of orange grease that floated to the top... even though I left out the shredded cheese entirely from the recipe.  Oh well... no body seemed to mind!  It's still ridiculously delicious!

This recipe was very good.  I bought a rotisserie chicken at the store and shredded that instead of using canned chicken.  Then I used 2 cups of shredded cheddar instead of 1 1/2.  It was a little heavy, (I used low fat cream cheese, but regular ranch) but it still tasted good, just not one of those dips you could eat all night.

5 STARS~THIS WAY! I recently had a similiar dip that was combined like this one. Let me just say it is much better layered with the cream cheese/ranch at the bottom, then the chicken/Franks Red Hot next, and just a light layer of shredded cheese. Heat until just bubbly. I don't care for the greasy effect when all the cheese is added and combined. It really is a delicious recipe!

OMG!  Awesome, was a little unsure at first while melting the cheeses in, smell of buff sauce is strong but the flavor is awesome, use canned chicken it separates and gets in every bite, went a little less on the cheddar to avoid grease factor, but people were hovering around my small crock pot to taste some more! craving some as we speak!!!!

Great! I have made twice now. First time I forgot to add the cheddar cheese, second time I remembered but actually prefered it without the cheddar. Without cheddar it keeps a better consistancy over a longer period. Also boiled chichen breast and shredded instead of using canned.

I used the original ingredients as I didn't read all of the reviews. Went and bought a mini crock pot as I thought the warmer the better. It worked great warming it up until we all started eating at the covered dish Christmas Party. At the end there was a good bit left but since it sat, it congealed, so out it went. But all that ate liked it!

This had great flavor.  I only had 1/2 cup of red hot left so that's all I used.  The only thing that I didn't like was that it HAS to stay hot.  If the dip cools it gets very thick.  If people take small portions at a time out of the crock pot it's better.  I don't think I would like this at all baked in the oven then cooling during serving.  

I made this again.  This time used 2 large chicken breasts that I shreaded, one package of cream cheese, 1/2 cup hot sauce (so the kids would still eat it) and 1 cup of blue cheese dressing.  It was great.  Didn't get as thick as the first time great flavor.  Will be making this again and again.

Awesome. Although I have a confession: I didn't read the recipe- just the ingredients. I blended the crm. chz, ranch and Frank's hot sauce with my hand mixer and stirred in the chicken and grated cheese. Served it cold. Fabulous and FAST! (why heat it??) Good with doritos, too!

I make this dip all of them time for parties as friends love it! It's easy to lower the fat by using fat free or light dressing, cream cheese and cheddar, and it still tastes as delicious.

Fantastic! Instead of the canned chicken I cooked two chicken breasts and diced them. Heated that in about 1 cup of Franks Red Hot sauce. I also used 1/2 ranch and 1/2 blue cheese. Next time, I think I'll just do a cup of blue cheese. I omitted the chedder cheese because of other reviews saying the dip came out oily. Mine didn't have any oil and it was amazing! Next time I'll add another chicken breast. Family ate it up on Football Sunday. Tasted just like wings! Served it with Fritos and celery. WILL be making this again soon!

I was actually a bit sceptical about this recipe- the combination on celery or crackers just didn't seem to fit... BUT I have been asked for this recipe SO many times!!!  It was great!!  Just the right amount of heat and the flavor is really good too!  I've already made it several times (by request) and given it out twice!

This was a huge hit at the party I took it to. I used frozen chicken breasts instead of canned. I just baked them with a littel salt and pepper. I will definitly make again!

Maybe it's a 'Burgh thing because everyone I know back home makes this and it always goes fast.  Today we're watching the Steeler game with our next door neighbors (also from Pittsburgh) and I'll be making this.  I've found that leftovers can be spread on sandwich bread the next day

The taste was pretty good, but I will try it without the cheese, using roasted chicken instead of canned.

This was soooo good. I took the recipe's combination, decreased the cream cheeze, chopped up the celery, added a little onion and pickles, and made buffalo chicken salad sandwiches. Soooo good!

This is a great recipe!  Everyone loves it with the Fritos Scoops.  I took the other rater's suggestion and used Blue Cheese dressing instead of Ranch, which gave it more of an authentic Buffalo Wing taste.  You also have to definitely use either Frank's Hot sauce or Trappy's Red Devil.  Any other hot sauce just doesn't make the original Buffalo Wing taste.  I also threw in cooked grilled chicken along with the can chicken to give it more texture and threw it all into a crock pot to keep warm during any party I take this too.  Believe me, it doesn't last long because it is addictive.

Always a good dip recipe. Made it countless times and modified countless times. I've used chicken breasts instead of canned chicken, less hot sauce, less ranch and vice versa. Always turns out great!

This is one of my favorite dips to make for parties and it's always a hit!  I usually use fresh b/s breast but when I'm short on time the canned is just as good.  From a previous review, I rinse the canned chicken first to lose that "canned meat" taste...thanks!  The color is a little odd but once everyone takes one bite, no one cares!  I have also made this with half ranch, half blue cheese and use tortilla chips to dip.  It's great for football parties...the guys always love it!!!

This recipe is awesome.  I make a few changes.  I use the Perdue Short Cuts chicken strips cut into bite sized pieces.  It's easy and eliminates the canned taste.  I also use Frank's Red Hot, and I serve it with dipping chips instead of crackers.  Everyone loves it!  Last time I made it, I had a small amount left over and mixed it with pasta.  Instant Buffalo Chicken Pasta!  Thanks for the recipe, I make it all the time.

This recipe is very good. I boiled and shredded my own chicken instead on canned and skipped the shredded cheese, no need for it. Everyone LOVES this deep especially if you are buffalo wings fan like my hubsand and I. Best served with tortilla chips.

This is an amazing recipe and I have made it many, many times.  Make sure and rinse the canned chicken very well to lose the can taste and only buy the best chicken breast in the can you can find. People freak out over this one so you might as well double it!

I made this for my Brother's going away party.  I doubled the recipe, used fat free cream cheese a whole bottle of hot sauce and a whole bottle of fat free ranch and used extra cheese.  It turned out absolutely wonderful.  I also served it with celery and scoops tortilla chips.  Out of the 2 batches, there was none left, and everyone was asking for the recipe.  When I told them I used all lowfat stuff they could barely believe it.

This recipe was VERY salty, I made it again and used Buffalo Wing Sauce instead of Pepper Sauce and it was much better. I also used half the cream cheese and substituted the other half with non-fat sour cream. Very tasty.

This dip was just wonderful.  I made it for the adults at my son's birthday party and everyone commented on it.  I've made it with ranch like the recipe says and I've also made it with bluecheese dressing instead.  Both ways are fantastic and I am keeping this recipe for future parties.

I always bring this to gatherings.  It does well in a crock pot and there's usually none left at the end of the night.  I use fresh cooked chicken cut into cubes rather than the canned chicken.  We love this with Tostitos and Celery.

We LOVE this!  Made it for New Year's and again for the superbowl. You'd think you should use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, but you don't taste the ranch and it just works!  I didn't put the extra cheese on top, just mixed it all in, threw it in my crock pot & let it bubble away to creamy goodness! Thanks for posting!

Nothing special, this recipe was just okay.  This dip looked worse than it tasted.  Because it was strange orange color, my children would not try it.  My husband did not comment on it at all.  I doubt that I will make this again.

Big hit at party and easy to make. I used. Like other reviewers, I used real chicken (boiled 3 breasts for 20 mins, then shred), and mixed with franks hot wing sauce. I layered this over the mixture of blue cheese dressing and 1/3 less fat cream cheese in small 1 1/2 quart casserole dish and then baked in the oven for 25 minutes. Doesn't need cheddar cheese. Looks nicer than mixing all together in crock pot. Served with celery and scoops.

Such a great recipe! Instead of canned chicken, I used packaged chicken breast strips as suggested. Also couldn't find Frank's sauce in the grocery store so I used Hooter's hot sauce. Thank you for the fantastic recipe!!!

I made this recipe for the Bears/Saints playoff game.  Since the Bears won, I attribute this awesome dip to their success and will be making again this weekend for the Superbowl!  

The dip did have a strange orange color as noted from another reviewer, but that did not prevent everyone from gobbling this up! Rather than using canned chicken, I bought a ready-to-go rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and shredded the chicken breasts to use in the dish.  I chose the lightly seasoned rotisserie chicken, which enhanced the flavor of the dip. I saved the other pieces for dinner later in the week. I served the dip with clubhouse sticks crackers as well as bite-sized celery sticks. Some of my guests were dipping pretzels in too.   

Overall, a fantastic taste that is so close to the real wing taste without the mess!

Yummy! I took the suggestion and used Frank's Buffalo sauce. I also used blue cheese rather than ranch (just my preference). Thanks! We'll be making this for the Super Bowl!

I made this once with the canned chicken and it wasn't such a big hit. Then I started using shredded chicken breasts and the dip has been a huge hit at family gatherings. I use Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce instead of the regular Franks.

This recipe is very much like one I found a couple of years ago in the coupon page (ad for canned chicken).  When I made it, I mistakenly used habanero sauce instead of hot pepper sauce (I didn't know the difference) and it was FIERY HOT!!!  My brother-in-law was the only one that could eat it!  Since then, I've used the habanero sauce but greatly reduced the amount.  It always gets rave reviews and I never have leftovers to bring home.  Also great with Triscuits.

This recipe was great.  I made it according to the recipe the first time, and after that, I made the following changes:  I cut the hot sauce down to 1/2 cup, and also cut the ranch down to 3/4 cup. I took it to a New Year's party in my slow cooker, and the guests were scraping  out the bottom!  I served this with celery and fritos scoops.  DELICIOUS.

This is really good and easy to make. I added about 2 tablespoons extra of the Frank's hot sauce. It was a big hit at our last football party. Make sure you use the type of hot sauce it recomends, It has a vinegar zip to it.

I changed this recipe a little. First I used Kens buffalo suace instead of pepper sauce. Also I boiled 3 chicken breast and then baked them a little and shredded them instead of canned chicken. I also baked my dip for about 25-30 mins on 350. And I let it sit just a little so it becomes alittle thicker. I also used tortilla chips. It was so good. Loved the taste.

I made this for a Christmas party and everyone LOVED it.  I really think it is quite tasty and prefer it a little spicy so I added a little more Frank's Hot Sauce but otherwise I think it's best left as is.  Excellent with Celery and Chicken in a biskit crackers.

Although I loved the taste of this dip, it was the one thing my guest didn't seem to go for, maybe because it didn't really look that appetizing. Regardless, I will make this dip again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome! My family absolutely loves it! I agree with not using the canned chicken - it is definitely worth the effort to use cut up chicken breasts vs. canned. I grill the chicken and it adds a nice flavor. We especially like to eat it with lime-flavored tortilla chips. Yummy!

Ugly, but tasty.  Loved using celery sticks instead of crackers.  Addictive. UPDATE 9/18/07: I was missing the celery taste if I used crackers so I sprinkled celery seeds (found in the spice rack at grocery store) over top before backing.  Oh, and now I mix the cream cheese and blue cheese together, "frost" the pan, then mix the chicken and "Franks" hot sauce together and spread over top... then sprinkle with the celery seeds and bake.  So much more appetizing to the eye.

I made this dip for a party and everyone loved it!  However I did make a few changes.  I used fresh chicken breasts which I partially froze, and then pulsed in a food processor.  I sauteed them in some pam and let cool.  I then mixed all ingredients together, omitting the cheese, and baked in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. I added 1 cup of cheddar on top and popped back in the oven for 5 more minutes.  I was worried that the dip would get cold, but it didn't have time.  It was gone in the first 10 minutes! Thanks for sharing the awesome recipe!

I have been wanting to try this, so finally TODAY was the day!  HT had chicken on sale and off I went. I chopped up fresh cooked chicken, then added 1 cup Frank's Hot wing sauce. I baked in the oven for 10 minutes at 350, then added the other ingrediants. I used the ranch dressing, lite cream cheese, and a mexican blend cheese. I believe by baking the Frank's sauce and the chicken first, it did not seperate as so many reviewers had a problem with. Bets with celery because it has a kick to it! Fritos and Tostitos are also good with it.

The taste was great but the color was a very unappealing orange sherbert color. I took this dip to a football party and it got skipped over until my brother raved about it and curious onlookers decided to be brave and try it. Served with Frito Scoops corn chips and celery. Dont think I would make again.

Made this for a football game this weekend. It was pretty good. I think it needed more hot sauce. We used Franks Red Hot but it just wasnt spicey enough. Also, we boiled a chicken breast in some chicken broth instead of using canned chicken. When the dip got a little thick, I thinned it with the chicken broth. I definately think Ranch is important in this. We used blue cheese instead but it was missing that tang. I would definately make this again!

This recipe is fantastsic.  My crowd loved it.  The only adjustments I made to this were: I used a rotisserie chicken and cut it into big chunks.  I also used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  I cooked it in the microwave.
Definitely a keeper.

This was good, but not great.  I think it looks better than it tastes.  I served my dip with Chicken in a Biscuit crackers and tortilla chips and nobody seemed to care for the crackers, they only ate the tortilla chips.

So I rated this before and now I am giving an update. I am still leary of meat in a can, so I used chicken breast and seasoned the water with Lawrys seasoning and red pepper flakes (I love spicy stuff). I let the chicken cool before I shred it and follow the rest of the recipe steps. This is the BEST appetizer ever!

I made this for a party and it was a hit! I used canned chicken and blue cheese dressing.... and less cheddar cheese than called for, but I think other reviewers are mistaking the hot sauce pooling on the top for grease. I served it with both sliced baguette and tortilla chips.

A favorite at every party!  I bake chicken breast and then shred instead of using canned chicken.  I always make a double batch and there are no leftovers.

A friend referred this recipe to me and holy smokes am I glad she did.  I used 3 chicken breasts and shredded them in my food processor.  I used blue cheese dressing as well and didn't use the cheddar.  Cooked it in a casserole dish at 350 for 25 mintes and it was AWESOME!!!  Next time I will have to triple the recipe because it went that fast.

Loved it.  I also did not use the chedder cheese at all and made the whole thing on the stove top.  I added extra hot sauce and used Bill's blue cheese dressing from this site. My biggest change was I used shredded pork, almost an entire 3lb roast. It was GREAT.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so easy to make.  I did not use the can chicken instead I boiled 2 chicken breast for about 40 minutes and then shredded it. And we like things really hot so we added more of the pepper sauce.  We also used tortilla chips.  very good!  Great for a party.

Made this for a shower and it went over really well. I was afraid it would be too hot, b/c it really smelled strongly of hot sauce, but no one complained. Served it with celery sticks and crackers. Most people liked it with the celery. Was easy, fast, and enjoyed, so I will definitely make again!!

This is one of the most successful recipes I can make for a party - absolutely everyone loves it!  Instead of the ranch dressing though, I always use chunky blue cheese dressing and serve with celery.  There are never any leftovers!!!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Great recipe!  I made it for a superbowl party but I made it in a crock pot to keep it warm all night. I also boiled two boneless/skinless chicken breast in broth rather than using canned chicken.  The chicken crackers weren't very good with it (too salty) but Triscuits and celery were excellent!

This tasted good, but had a lot of orange oil floating on it when it got hot in the crockpot. Maybe baking is better? We ended up with a lot left over, too bad since it had a good flavor.

--insert slobbering homer sound here--  Yum!  Decadent!  Easy!  I used freshly cooked chicken - much cheaper and better than canned chicken - and baked it for 30 minutes at 350 in the oven instead of using the slow cooker.  A keeper!

Very good.  Satisfies that craving for hot, spicy chicken wings without the mess.  Like others have recommended, I totally omitted the cheddar cheese and substituted bleu cheese dressing for the Ranch.  I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and also lightly sauteed about a cup of finely chopped celery before throwing in the chicken and hot sauce.  Made for a very hearty dip which the family and guests loved.  Went over much better with Tostitos scoops than with the celery sticks...but was definitely a hit.

Delicious!  I omitted the cheddar cheese, as I felt it was "cheesy" enough.  Definitely make again, have passed to friends who enjoyed it also.

Amazing dip! This will be in my permanant file. I also used the blue cheese instead of the ranch and it was perfect. I did not use the cheddar cheese and I am glad because it would have been the wrong taste for this dip.

It's good....I think I liked it cold better! Definitely those who love hot and spicy will adore this!  Sure cleared my nasal passages!  I tried it with tuna, too, which I think tastes better than canned chicken.  Use as much or little hot sauce as desired!  Cheese not really that necessary, you can slim this recipe down fat-wise successfully!

Much to my surprise , this dip was very good!  I sub. blue cheese dressing & blue cheese on top & baked it for 12 minutes @ 350.  I cut the recipe in half, used canned chicken & it still was a hit!  We were disappointed that there were not any leftovers! YUM!

Made this tonight for the gang. Used half blue cheese and half ranch dressing. Put everything in a pot on the stove and blended well that way, then put in a baking dish at 350 for 20 minutes. Also, I poached two chicken breasts in water in the micro and shredded instead of using canned. Thank you.

Followed the recipe to the tee (other than I baked it in the oven to warm it up instead of using the crockpot) and it was scrumptous!  Everyone wants the recipe.  Served with the chicken crakers.

My son-in-law loves wings, and I wasn't about to mess with them, so I made this instead.  He absolutely loved it and took the leftovers home.  The rest of us enjoyed it as well, and I like the fact that you can get the wings taste without the fuss.  I did some chicken breasts in the slow cooker so the chicken was tender and easy to shred.  I think this would be good with some blue cheese instead of the cheddar.

This was sooooo good! I made one batch with blue cheese dressing and one with Ranch. It is hard to say which one was better b/c they both were awesome! I almost doubled the Frank's and it still wasn't hot enough (for me anyway). I do have to say that with the Ranch, the ranch flavor came through big time (I used Hidden Valley) and it seemed hotter than the blue cheese batch (used Marie's Chucky Blue Cheese). I highly recommend!!

Excellent!  I wanted to make something different and this was a huge hit.  I used fresh chicken breast (boiled) instead of canned, as I am not a huge fan of canned chicken.  I also used less cheddar cheese (about 1 cup).  A definite crowd pleaser and I will definitely make again (especially for the Super Bowl).

I made this dip and got a marriage proposal!! Not a serious one, but this dip is that good! I followed advise from previous reviews and used chicken breast tenderloins, substituted bleu cheese dressing from the refridgerated section for the rance and eliminated the cheddar cheese. This was my first time using Frank's Red Hot and it has now replaced Texas Pete in my house! Thanks sooooo much for sharing this recipe!!

A real hit witht he guys! I also used Blue Cheese dressing and chicken breast that I cooked and cubed. It was a bit greasy, but I think this could be eliminated. Overall great- making it again as a coating for bonelss chicken tenderloins.

Excellent dip!  It is hot and that's the way we like our wings.  I would not use any other hot sauce than Frank's but I might try using bleu cheese dressing in the future just because it is my favorite with wings.  The dip tastes exactly like Buffalo chicken wings dipped in dressing only without the mess and work of taking the meat off the bone while eating.  FANTASTIC!

I was not please with the recipe as is. Guests commented that it was just "okay". If I were to make again, I would omit shredded cheese (was too greasy), use fresh chicken instead of canned, and half-the recipe (for a smaller crowd). I baked the recipe instead of a crock, and I was pleased with the cooking results. The chicken flavor crackers did not go over well, I would use Fritos scoops next time.

After "upgrading" recipe with shredded chicken breast, Franks Buffalo Chicken sauce and blue cheese dressing, still disappointed. Seemed like there was not enough chicken (used 2 large breasts) to taste. Like other reviewers commented, it really does look disgusting and I think that's why it was barely touched at an appetizers only party.

I was a little dissapointed by the reception this recipe got, because I was very excited about preparing it!  I used cut up chicken breast, bleu cheese dressing, and velveeta as suggested by other reviewers.  I really liked it, but it was barely touched at my gathering and not commented on at all.  I think it lost out to the more traditional hamburger and cheese dip that was down the buffet.  Maybe if there hadn't been similar food, it would have been eaten better, but by the time we finish the leftovers I'm not sure I'll ever make it again.  Thanks for the interesting idea, though.

I took the advise of other reviewers.  I boiled and shredded chicken breasts, used blue cheese, ommitted the cheddar cheese, and used Frank's buffalo wing sauce.  I also didn't pay attention to the measurements.  I just kept adding ingredients until I got the taste and consistency I wanted.  I have made it twice.  First time I started it on the stove and then put it in a baking dish and baked for a few minutes before serving.  Second time I cooked it on the stove and then took it to work in a crock pot and heated it up.  It was extremely greasy.  I wil definitely make it again, because everyone loved it, but will only make it when I can put it in the oven.  I would not recommend using a crock pot.

Canned chicken is usually not my cup of tea, but it worked great here!  I used low fat cream cheese, and skipped the cheddar altogether.  Excellent party food!

Mmm Mmm, this dip tastes just like buffalo wings.  I used more Frank's hot sauce than the recipe called for because my husband and I like our "wings" hot.  And I used Blue cheese dressing instead of ranch because blue cheese and wings are meant to be together.  Served with celery sticks - - absolutely perfect!

MAN! What a great dip, and I don't even like buffalo wings! I halved the recipe because I just wanted to test it out before the 4th. I used bleu cheese instead of ranch (because we didn't have ranch on hand, but it worked out anyway) and I boiled two pieces of chicken breast instead of using a can. I also didn't use as much cream cheese. Best appetizer I have made in a while. My brother finished the entire dish with tortilla chips. And my brother never likes anything I make! This is a keeper and I will definitely make it for the 4th.

This was an excellent recipe but because of the changes I made I can only give 4 stars.  Instead of canned chicken I shredded a cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. I also eliminated the cheese, as I really didn't think it needed it.  And I cooked the whole thing on the stove and just microwaved small portions at a time when needed rather than using the crock pot.

This recipe was so interesting and so easy. I loved it. I doubled up on the Frank's buffalo red hot sauce and probably will double up on the (fresh) chicken next time also. If I don't double up on the chicken and hot sauce (for a smaller crowd), I may just go for one 8oz of cream cheese vs. two because this makes a huge batch as is. This is perfect for parties.  I brought it to a work birthday party today and as I write this review, people are coming in my office to get the recipe, haha.

WOW!!!!  We are crazy about this dip!!  I followed other's suggestions and left out the cheddar cheese, used blue cheese dressing and boiled a few fresh chicken breastes and shredded in the food processor.  Also, only used one brick of cream cheese and mixed it all together and heated in the oven.  I don't see how you could go wrong with this one, though, if you like buffalo chicken!!  Thanks, this will be made over and over in our home!

This tasted excellent, once people tried it.  It has an odd color and texture and so people were reluctant.  However, several of the people who did try it asked for the recipe.

This was okay.  Probably won't make it again.  This recipe makes a TON of dip, so cut it back if you don't need alot.

If you like buffalo chicken wings, you'll like this.  Use fresh chicken, though.  Canned chicken is EXPENSIVE and not as good.

I made this recipe for my super bowl party, people really seemed to like it.  It was a change to the normal ranch dip for vegetables.  I took other peoples advice and put it the oven instead of the slow cooker, and I also used about half of the cheese. I made this recipe a little more figure friendly too.  I used light cream cheese, light ranch dressing and low moisture skim shredded cheese. Very good recipe, I will make this again.

I made this for a super bowl party.  This was fairly easy to make, it got a little messy.  I pre-made this, I cooked it in a skillet as directed, then before serving, heated it in the oven.  I served this with Frito Scoops and sticks of celery.  No one really loved this, people tried it, but I have leftovers.  People asked for the recipe just out of curiosity of what was in it, not necessarily that they wanted to make it for themselves.  I don't know if I will make this again.

Yummy, not so hot that you only taste hot sauce.  Has a spicey aftertaste.  I used shreaded chicken breast that I baked.    Will make again.

This recipe was a real hit with the guests at our New Year's Eve party.  I followed the directions exactly and then added a container of blue cheese to everything.  If you think it is too spicy, just add more ranch dressing.

Tastes pretty good, but not very elegant.  Good to serve for a football game, but I'd hesitate for a nice dinner party.

I took this to a xmas party, no one ate it, some tried it, said it was good, didn't have anymore.  I found this dip to be below average, very very oily, and expensive to make.. not worth my time and money again.

This was excellent and my girlfriends loved it at happy hour. I only used 1 brick of cream cheese and 1 10 oz. chicken, and I served it cold with celery. Also cut the ranch to 1/2 cup. The chicken crackers were a little too salty for my taste with the dip, but the celery was great. I sprinkled crumbles blue cheese on the top and mixed some in as well.

Unbelievable!  This dip was absolutely amazing! I served it last night at a large jewelry party (like a Tupperware kind of thing).  OMG, everyone went nuts over it! Today, I have to either email it or print it out for people who requested it!  I did make a couple of minor changes...1) Poached & shredded two boneless chicken breast halves, 2) Neufchatel low-fat cream cheese 3) Reduced Fat Bleu Cheese dressing instead of Ranch 4) Reduced Fat shredded Cheddar cheese 5) I baked it at 300 degrees in a stoneware casserole dish for about 40 mins. instead of the slow cooker.  Honestly, I had dreams of this dish all night!  I can't wait to make it again!  Thanks!

Very, very good. I skipped the cheddar cheese, substituted the ranch for blue cheese, and poached chicken breasts instead of using canned. Served with celery sticks.

This was a HUGE hit at a party.  Everybody wanted to know what was in it and I had to write the recipe down 3 times!  Thank goodness it was easy to make and easy to remember the recipe.  
HOWEVER, OMIT THE CHEDDER!!!!  This only makes this dish look unappetizing (greasy) and does nothing for the flavor.  Trust me, I tried it both ways.  Tastes and looks better without it.  I used two extra cans of Tyson's chucky chicken and added more of Frank's hot sauce.

I have taken this dip to a lot of parties with different groups of friends, and everyone loves it.  I usually serve it with tortilla chips and celery sticks.  It is great for those watching their carb intake.  We even like it at room temperature.

I use a rotisserie chicken instead of canned for taste.  I've had more luck going on taste with the dressing (I use blue cheese) and hot sauce so you might want to start with less of each.  Using half a cup of the blue cheese tends to overpower everything else.  Best with celery, but almost as good with tortilla chips!

This dip pleases almost everyone!  Just add a little more hot sauce to your personal portion for a little extra "kick!"  Our entire soccer team fell in love with this dip (esp. with the Chicken in a Biscuit crackers, although it's nice to have the healthy celery alternative available, too) during a birthday celebration.  Make it today and impress all of your friends!

This dip was a hit! BUT I will say that once it sit awhile it gets really thick.  Even though the good flavor remains, the look is not so apetizing.  The second time I made it, I added twice the ammount of dressing *blue cheese*.  Turned out FABULOUS!! The same people ate it the second time and said it was even better than before.

This was pretty good but I actually thought it was too cheesy! Next time I won't use as much cream cheese. Also, (after a bad experience with canned chicken) I used 2 chicken breasts that I seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked on the stove, then shredded. Much, much better than canned chicken. I may make this again because it's different.

I was looking for an appetizer recipe for a potluck that would use up some extra grilled chicken breasts I had on hand. I found this one and decided to give it a try. Even though I wasn't sure I would like it, I thought that those who like spicy food probably would. I have to say I was even more skeptical after I put it together, it can look pretty unappetizing. When it was hot and standing, some oil (from the cheese?) floated to the top, and when it cooled it looked kind of curdled. That said, everyone at the potluck LOVED it. I used blue cheese rather than ranch dressing and Frank's Red Hot Sauce and everyone was saying "this tastes just like Buffalo wings". Most people seemed to like it with the crackers (I tried the new Ritz Sticks) instead of the celery. Once it has cooled a little it is a lot easier to dip up. The only thing I would do differently is not chop my chicken quite as finely. I also didn't think it was "too" hot. Definitely spicy but it didn't leave your lips burning. I think I would like to try this again and use ranch dressing to see how it tastes because I thought the blue cheese flavor made it taste kind of sour.

Ok, I'm gonna give this recipe 4 stars, it is very easy to make, and it does taste like buffalo wings that we love, but the teenagers thought it was just way too spicy and I wound up throwing almost all of it out.  Of course I probably did something wrong, I just cant figure out what.

I am not sure I made this right but it was still great. I couldn't get the cream cheese to completely mix, but it was amazing in taste. I used Frank's Red Hot as the recipe suggested, which I think is a pretty good brand, and Kraft Three Cheese Ranch. I actually used this as a meal with big chunks of chicken, but in the future I would reduce the ingredients other than chicken overall because it was a bit too much sauce.

This was absolutely fabulous! It was a hit at our Memorial Day picnic. I do recommend keeping it warm though because it will get super thick when cold. I served it with tortilla chips. Everyone is asking for the recipe so I will pass it along! Thanx!

I gave this a 3 due to the fact I made this for a Memorial Day party and no one really ate this.  I think because the color? Or, possibley they had no clue what was in it.  I will make this again for a party that is smaller and indoors.

Very tasty and easy to make (I cooked mine on the stove, sprinkled with additional cheese and zapped in the microwave.) I used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch. Would definitely make to take to a party.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! I had a party of 10- since there were several other appetizers I halfed the recipe and it still made quite a bit- everyone really raved over how good it was- 
I used fat free ranch- and instead of canned chicken I sauted boneless skinless breast with garlic, red and black pepper , and chili powder than diced up the chicken in tiny pieces- served with celery and tortilla chips- can't wait to make it again!

This dip is addictive!  As others suggested, I used cooked chicken breasts, used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, skipped the cheese and baked at 350 for 20 minutes after mixing all ingredients.  All the flavor of buffalo wings, but much more satisfying.  Thanks for the posting!

I made this for one of our poker parties- It was a huge hit, even with the kids.  I would make it over and over again- and the women loved it because it was atkins friendly!

This dip is awesome.  I made it for a superbowl party and it was all finished pretty quickly.  It is very tasty and not too spicy.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It is a little different and great for groups.

Great Buffalo wing flavor! I used about 3/4 lb. chopped rotisserie chicken and halved the other ingredients, adding additional hot sauce (Frank's). I substituted blue cheese dressing and Mozzarella cheese. I skipped the stove and heated it slowly in the microwave, stirring frequently. Leftover dip made a nice sandwich filling.

Excellent!! I love this dip.  It is hot but not too hot.  Serve with cold beer!

Note:  I tried this again with blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and cheddar cheese and the results were fantastic!!  Not to mention even easier.

I used fresh chicken with this recipe, only half the cream cheese and the full amount of the hot sauce. I didn't bother with the stove top melting process. I simply threw everything (except the chicken) into the food processor, placed in a casserole dish and baked. Once hot I put the dish under the broiler for a minute or two. Hubby and kids eat hot wings at least four times a month, so I knew they'd love this dip. We thought it was great and I can't wait to serve this at my next party. Good job NunPunch!

This recipe gets 5 stars because it taste GREAT. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used fresh chicken breasts, cooked and shredded and also used blue cheese dressing. I had a problem with excess oil in the pan which I blotted out with a few paper towels. My husband liked dipping with the chicken crackers. I prefer the celery. Next time I think I will try a fat free blue cheese dressing and maybe that will cut down on the excess oil.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The buffalo sauce was overpowered and didn't have near enough kick.  I made this for SuperBowl.  Everyone ate some, but no one wanted to take the leftovers home.

Absolutely delicious! This was a big hit at a recent party. For those of you on low carb diets, use the celery sticks. This is a keeper!

Oh is this good! If you like spicy or buffalo wings this is a great dip. I didn't think it would need the cheddar cheese as other reviewers stated, but when I tried it without, it was just ok. I decided to add the cheese and it seemed to bring out more of the flavor and made the consistancy better. This is great. I can't wait to have it again.****update..I added bacon. It's already bad enough for you why not make it taste even better?

Made a double batch of this pretty much as is, and it was gone at the end of our Superbowl potluck! I work at a pub where we make our own dressings, so the ranch and buffalo I used were homemade. I added half of the cheddar into the dip and didn't put any on top because of the oils that will sit on top of not stirred in. Put some scallions on top and it was a hit! People were begging for the recipe, would definitely make again. I'm interested in trying it with blue cheese!

I used leftover chicken breast for this (despise canned chicken), and made a minor mistake though it worked well. Was rushing finishing super bowl snacks up and thought it was 1 cup of hot sauce so that’s what I used. Everyone ate it up. Definitely a repeat. Just wow. Thank you.

This was really good! I followed the recipe with the exception of cooking on the stove. I made this entirely in the slow cooker. I would love to try this with bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch to see how that turns out.

Turned out great! Personally though I’d recommend using a quality ranch, a little more hot sauce, and a little less cream cheese. I think next time I make it I’ll slow cook thighs and pull the meat instead of using canned

Add some blue cheese dressing along with the ranch and yum! I just make it all ahead of time and then heat as needed from cold. I boil real chicken and then use a mixer to shred it quickly. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this dip.  It is so easy and folks love it.  I normally double it up and freeze some for another day.  

I use Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Wing sauce, which keeps the acidity down.  Folks who say they usually don't like Buffalo Chicken Dip, because it is too acidic love my version and now make this recipe with Little Baby Ray's for their own gatherings.  That said, my family is big on spicy foods and they love it with Baby Ray's, too.

I love this recipe! We are vegetarian, so I subbed out the chicken with gardien chicken strips. I also sautéed diced onion and garlic along with the strips before adding everything else. Once it all cooked and cheese melted, I put it in a dish in the oven at 450 until the cheese was brown and bubbling.

I took the other reviewer's recommendations and used real chicken. (Canned chicken, ew!) This turned out just OKAY. I felt like it was missing something or that it was too creamy. I probably won't be making again.

I love this recipe.  The second time I had a couple small modifications.  Used 2 shredded chicken breasts instead of can.  I used pepper jack cheese in the mixture and cheddar on top when I moved to crock pot.   Lastly I used 1/2 cup hot sauce.   This is the most delicious dip I’ve ever had.

I have been looking for a dip recipe comparable to Tully's Buffalo Chicken Dip and this one is the closest so far. It turned out great!

Goopy.  Needed more chicken, and more hot sauce, and I'm not sure what could have improved the texture.  It's very cream-cheese-forward.

This is a family and work crowd favorite. Made it several times as the recipe calls for, instant favorite. The pre-shredded cheese does make it more greasy as a fellow reviewer stated. The ease of the pre-shredded makes it worth it.

We have been making buffalo chicken dip for years, but not in the crockpot so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  Canned meat was not even an option so I boiled and shredded my chicken breast and let it marinate in franks for a bit.  I already knew two bars of cream cheese was too much so I did 1 & 1/2 bars.  I wish I would have put in less ranch as well because I ended up having to add a ridiculous amount of franks to kill the overwhelming ranch flavor.  I used the casserole style crockpot and it worked out great.  So yes, this was good, but not as its written.

I liked this recipe. It was so good, although I made it for 10 people, I had to use more chicken breast, ranch, and hot sauce. Adjust hot sauce and ranch amounts to what you want. I used about 3 spoonfuls of cream cheese. I used this recipe again for a party of 25, which I used 9 cans of chicken breast to make. It was a hit. Again, this recipe is your own, adjust amounts to however you want.

I made and shredded my own chicken (cooked one breast in the instant pot) and then tossed all ingredients into the crockpot on low for 3-4 hours (I cubed the cream cheese first).  This went over very well and will definitely will be made again.

Excellent!  I used flakes of chicken as I had nothing else.  It was good but would be better with shredded chicken.  It was gone in a matter of minutes.

Do yourself a favor and buy a rotisserie chicken, pull off 20oz of meat & beat it with your hand mixer until it’s shredded & sub the ranch for lighthouse blue cheese...flavor profile goes through the roof if you don’t use the canned meat.  Otherwise this is a great base!

Great recipe but made a few tweaks.

1. I used fresh chicken breast tenderloins that I boiled and then shredded. After I shredded it I added it to a pan with some butter.

2. Got a block of cheddar cheese that I shredded instead of using the prepackaged shredded cheese. Only used about a half cup.

3. Instead of using ranch dressing I used 1/2 cup of ranch and 1/2 cup of blue cheese and then a squirt of each because it was a little too spicy.

4. Would have used a little less of the Frank's Red Hot because my boyfriend thought it was a little too spicy.

Turned out delicious! Will definitely be making this again! Just wish I had made a little more because it's disappearing too quickly in my house! Even my picky teenage son thinks it's delicious.

Ok For starters use fresh chicken.  Only use blue cheese dressing if you want to replicate a chicken wing.

I make this frequently with a few modifications. I use the large container of Roots chicken, it’s already cooked and shredded. I use Marzzetti Ultimate Blue Cheese dressing instead of the Ranch and finally I substitute Mozzarella cheese for the cheddar and stir it instead of on top. Best dip ever!

I made this for my friends at a game night, and it was devoured within an hour. I would definitely recommend this recipe, and will likely make it again in the future.

This was a simple yet tasty dish I did use 1/2 Ranch & Blue Cheese dressing and a rotisserie chicken, I had one serving by the next day my daughter devoured all the rest by herself (selfish-jk).…. Thanks for the recipe

I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and added 1/4 cup of blue cheese crumbles.  I also diced a green onion to add for garnish on top. I baked in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes instead of the slow cooker.  Came out great!

This was very good but very spicy. I followed the instructions exactly except I used fat free ranch and fat free cream cheese (couldn’t tell the difference). Because I don’t like things super spicy, I will cut the amount of hot pepper sauce next time. FYI this tasted FINE with canned chicken. So easy too!

I made this exactly like the recipe said with no variations and it was delicious and everyone raved about it at the potluck I attended.  I do think the next time I make it I will try some of the variations others have recommended just to try them out.  But this is a very easy and very good recipe!

I cut the recipe in half.  I used Texas Pete's hot sauce, added more chicken than what it called for, and used the meat from a rotisserie chicken. Everyone loved it. I'll be making this again.

I made this for a party I attended and it was a big hit. I did substitute the canned chicken with a whole rotisserie chicken (shredded) and put all of the cheese this recipe called for in the actual dip and sprinkled more on top after I transferred the mixture to the crock pot. Also, when I was prepping it I softened the cream cheese (almost melted) and mixed in the ranch and cheddar cheese before adding it to the chicken/hot sauce mixture. Definitely worth making!

This dip is sure to satisfy any crowd, truly any gathering of people will devour this in record time. I'm making a batch for a 4th of July party today because it's been so popular at the other events.  I follow directions except I cook my frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot with taco seasoning and a packet of dry ranch dressing, shred it and then proceed with recipe. Works like a charm. I do use the Franks too. Some reviews have commented on the coloring being oddly orange and unappealing. I did not encounter this at all.  It's a winner.

I made a number of changes - used Chipotle Sauce, added diced jalapenos, onion, garlic, and used a rotisserie chicken rather than canned chicken - that stuff is dry.  Added fresh parsley for color and diced fresno chili peppers on top.

Delicious! It was a hit at our Memorial Day cookout. People said they liked it because it wasn't too spicy like some buffalo dips can be. We made it the night before by mixing all together then stuck it in the fridge. Heated up for about 20 minutes on 375 in the morning and took it hot to the party. Definitely sticking with this recipe

Delectable! So easy...I just mix everything together in a bowl, transfer to casserole dish and bake at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes...or until bubbly. Great with the chicken flavored crackers...but also corn chip scoops are a hit as well. Make it all the time for family cookouts. My family loves it!

This might be the unhealthiest thing I've ever made but it's delicious. I half the ranch and add a an extra splash of hot sauce before eating.  Grate your own cheese for a little extra punch or flavor instead of the powdery pre-grated stuff.

Always a family favorite when watching sports or having people over.  So easy to make and soooo good!  Low carb meal/snack when eaten with celery.

This dip has become a staple in our house.  It's just delicious. I love using the crock pot.  I use 1 package chicken breast, coat in Franks' red hot wing sauce, and cook on low about 4 hours until done.  Take out chicken, shred, and return to sauce.  I love the original recipe, but my husband finds it to creamy.  For him, I decrease to 4 oz cream cheese, 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese, & 1 tablespoon ranch dressing mix.   Still delicious, but more chicken than sauce.

First time making.I  cut ingredients in half because  its just me. I just made in pan on top of stove,  didnt use crock pot (because  I wanted it right then.)Think i could have used the 2 cans of chicken just to have more chicken.  I put it in a bowl and sat down with some tostitos  scoops. And Before  I knew it I had eaten over half of it!!  Can you say YUMMY!?? Love it! Definitely a keeper! Will definitely  make  again

So good. Easy to make and enough for a crowd. My husband was asking me to make it, for no reason at all except to eat himself. This recipe was perfect. No reason to deviate from this recipe!. Yum!!

This was very good. I used Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce (buffalo).  I made half this recipe and half using bleu cheese dressing and bleu cheese in lieu of the ranch dressing and cheddar cheese. The chicken available to me were 12.5 oz cans not 10 oz but that seemed to not be a problem. We actually preferred the bleu cheese version. This was very good on whole grain tortilla scoops

A cowd pleasing favorite! I mix everything then bake for 30 min. Only sprinkle the cheese on top; otherwise it creates a barrier that's hard to scoop as it cools. Serve with celery cut into 2"pieces and Fritos scoops!

I cut back on the amount of hot sauce.  The recipe called for 3/4  cup of hot sauce but I used only 1/3 cup.  This was just right for us.  We like spicy food but want to enjoy other flavors too.  My husband thought it a bit too thick.

Wow excellent and easy!  I couldn't bear using canned chicken so cooked breast of chicken in broth then tore it. Also used blue cheese not ranch (I'm from Buffalo-give me some slack!) It was so delicious I craved it when I woke up this morning!!

i  just took this to a Super Bowl LIII party and it was a HUGE HIT!!! i  did use 2 boneless, skinless, lightly seasoned and baked breasts that i  shredded instead of the canned chicken. It was a super easy recipe to make and, in my opinion, it was delish.

Yes I will make it again. I really liked it. 

Yes I made changes.  I used grilled chicken breast, added green onions, and topped with green onions and sliced jalapeños. I also cut the recipe in half, which was more than enough with other things for small gathering.

I used rotisserie chicken or when making for vegetarian crowd, substituted two cans of white navy beans. I didn't use crockpot but instead used large sauté pan and transferred to oven.

I've been making this many years now & have tweaked it to my preferences. Its always a hit. I buy a rotisserie chicken & use that,  blue cheese dressing instead of Ranch & omit the cheddar cheese.

This is a big hit. I had to hide it from my family so it could be lunch! I simply put everything in a slow cooker on low for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. It tastes great! I did use an entire small bottle of Red’s hot cause also. Nice kick but not too much (as I don’t like extremely spicy food). Thanks for sharing!

I use fresh chicken (I throw 3 breasts  the oven.. covered.. for an hour or 1.5 hours); let it cool, shred with 2 forks, then follow the recipe accordingly.  This makes a 9x13 dish and is awesome.  IF there any leftovers, it gets thrown into a pot of chicken tortilla soup (the buffalo gives it a great kick!).

Best buffalo chicken dip I've ever had. I eat it religiously.  It's great with french bread if you're drunk or hungover! I use Sweet Baby Ray's Wing Sauce.

I've been making this recipe for years after a co-worker brought it to work for a potluck lunch.  The only thing I do differently, is to heat everything through in a large saucepan on the stove, then either put it in a casserole dish on a hotplate, or put it in a slow cooker to keep it warm.  This recipe has been a go-to appetizer for parties and I've even made it for supper when we don't want a big "meat and potatoes" dinner.  I serve it with the "F" brand scoops corn chip or tortilla chips rather than crackers.  It's always a hit!!

I made this Christmas eve for our family party. I am always looking for great, tasty, easy ideas when I have a party or gathering and this one was awesome. The whole family loved it and we will have it again! I did add a little more Frank's hot sauce than what was called for because we like a little heat and tanginess. It was perfect!

I used very little cheddar cheese that I shredded but after baking "oil" came to the top.  Not very appetizing for presentation.  I am thinking it may have come from the salad dressing.  It tasted delicious though.  Any ideas???

My family absolutely LOVES this dip.  I used a full cup of Frank's Red Hot and a half cup each of ranch and blue cheese dressing.  Poached two chicken breast instead of the canned meat.  My kids ask for it again and again.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

Outstanding. Agree with the extra chicken comments. I would recommend draining it with a straining spoon and saving the rest in a bowl for marinades and dressings. I'm also going try blue cheese next time for variety. The perfect pre game meal!!

the recipe is amazing with a small tweak.  I dont like canned chicken so I used chicken breasts. 4 to 5 seems to be a good number.  Cook in crock pot on low for 6 hours and then shred with fork. Used 12 ounces of cheese freshly shredded.  not bagged. also used simply dressed dressing and Frank's red hot wings buffalo sauce and Philadelphia cream cheese.  delicious!

Very easy to make this. Have made it twice so far for football get togethers. I used Sweet baby Ray's buffalo sauce as the hot sauce and it gave it an awesome taste. Very delicious. This one is a definite keeper.

Love this recipe!  Instead, I used 2 raw chicken breasts, chopped.  I never use chicken from a can.  Sauteing the chicken in the pan with the buffalo sauce is a great way to cook the chicken.

Excellent as it is, although I usually use crusty bread for dipping. Sometimes I'll put in Blue Cheese dressing instead of ranch. Can attest that this recipe works when halved.

This was SUPER easy to make and SUPER YUMMY, and it was inhaled at a friends dinner/birthday party!  Great "buffalo wing" taste with a bit of heat and creaminess!  Served with both celery sticks, and tortilla chips....all of which disappeared!  This is for folks that like spicy.

This recipe is so delicious!! I have made it quite a few tiles already. The only thing thing I do differently is cut down on the hot sauce (we don’t like very spice food) and add more ranch and cheese to take down the spice even more.

This was my first time making this and it was a huge hit at our back yard bbq.  It was super easy to make.  I read the other reviews and poached 3 chicken breasts instead of using canned chicken (great idea!).  I used old cheddar cheese and there was some grease while cooking in the oven but I just removed it.  Only thing I would do differently is maybe half the recipe as it was a bit too much.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is a forgiving one. We make a crock pot full of this, with 12 oz of hot sauce, a medium onion, and 2 cream cheeses. about 2 lbs of shredded deboned chicken. Sometimes, we put black olives or green peppers in it. Just try it, give it your own twist.

This recipe is a winner. The only alteration I made is use freshly cooked chicken. I cooked chicken breasts and substituted the cans. The beauty of this recipe is that you can adjust the level of heat depending on your audience.

Delicious! I used chicken breasts instead of the canned stuff, and shredded it myself with a hand mixer (much easier to do than with forks). It was a hit at both parties I brought this to.

Delicious!! I used Frank's buffalo sauce and skipped the slow cooker 2nd time. Just let it sit in pot on the stove on low for about 20 minutes. Tastes the same but a little easier. Goes great on Ritz or tortilla chips.

Awesome again!!  I use half cup ranch and half cup blue cheese dressing and of course an extra handful of cheese.  It’s also good if you split it in two baking dishes cover in cheese and bake about 20 minutes at 350.

I made this as written, knowing that it would be better with freshly made chicken.  I just wanted to try it out.  Cause if it was really good, it would be an awesome, easy dip to take somewhere.  Alas, the canned chicken ruined the whole dip.  If you are going to spend the time and money to make this, cook your own chicken.

This is my "Go To" dish when attending bar-b-ques, cook outs, etc.  Instead of 1 c. Ranch dressing, I use 1/2 c. Ranch + 1/2 c. blue cheese dressing = delicious!

Love this dip! I always make it in the crock pot. I boil the chicken for 20 minutes (or until cooked). Then, shred the chicken. Next, add all of the ingredients to the crock pot and cook for about 30 minutes (or until everything is melted). Also, I only use 1/2 cup of hot sauce because it can be too spicy for some people. Serve with Tostitos chips.

We loved this!  I used a rotisserie chicken and added 1/4 c.  melted butter.  Served with tortilla chips.  A keeper.

It was delicious.  
The tip about sauteing the canned chicken in butter was a good one.  I usually don't like canned chicken but it turned out wonderful.

Oh, I used Franks Hot Buffalo sauce not realizing that there were different levels of hot... lol but it was good. I may try a lower one next time. 

It was great with the Tostitos Cantina Style chips.

Quick and easy. I sub fresh chicken, cooked and shredded. Add bacon bits. I also subbed 1 cup of Moore’s buffalo wing sauce for the hot sauce, and then spice up to taste.

This is a great recipe. If you don't like canned chicken, you can also use rotisserie or even bake and shred fresh chicken. I chose to bake mine in the oven rather than slow cooking, and it still turned out great.

This is a really good base recipe - I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and mexican cheese instead of straight cheddar (it includes cheddar) and it came out very good - I made it on the stove to make combining easier, and I'll heat it in the oven to serve again.

The dip itself was delicious. I followed the above recipe but for a small serving size. My one problem is that it was very greasy. I took the recommendation of shredding my own cheese to help with this issue, but it didn't work. It was very greasy and looked displeasing to the eye so I did not serve it. BUT it tasted delicious especially using the carrots and celery to dip. Next time I will try without shredded cheese and see if that helps.

This was really good! I used 1/2 cup Franks Buffalo Wing sauce because I didn’t want too much fire in my mouth and had children that wanted to try the dip. I also used a store bought original flavored rotisserie chicken in place of canned chicken. Will definitely make again!

I used 1/2 ranch and 1/2 blue cheese dressing, a rotisserie chicken,  and about a 1 and and a 1/3 cups of monterey jack cheese and cheddar pre shredded. I added a few extra dashes of franks hot sauce and it turned out great. No oil, nice and creamy.

This is an amazing recipe that has become a staple at parties. I have made this recipe with ranch and blue cheese. Both work fine, really comes down to preference. I am partial to the traditional pairing of blue cheese with Buffalo wings. The one change to this recipe that I highly recommend is using actual boneless skinless chicken breast. Boil it, let it sit for 10 minutes, then pop it in the KA mixer if you have one and it will mince to the PERFECT consistency. Enjoy!

I made this dish however I did modify it by layering the dressing and cream cheese mixture and the chicken and hot sauce... that was suggested by another user... this is actually my 2nd time making it...  both times I layered it and it’s a show stopper I love it

I threw 1 LARGE chicken breast in a small (.65 qt?) crockpot on high for a few hours, then shredded and added the remaining ingredients. The crockpot was FULL.  I thought it definitely needed more chicken, so next time I'll half the remaining ingredients.  It's really good on a baked potato also!

Immediately I knew I wouldn’t use canned chicken, and I didn’t want to cook ahead, so I bought a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from Whole Foods and threw EVERYTHING into the crockpot at once. Loved it! Brought it to a party and nothing was left to bring home.  The only feedback I heard was “use more chicken!”

I’ve made this many times but I don’t add the shredded cheese.  I find the shredded cheese causes the dip to solidify faster when not served in a small crock pot.  With or without the shredded cheese, it’s still a fantastic dip!  This has become a family favorite.

This was a huge hit at the playoff tailgate party! I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted ranch dressing for the blue cheese dressing. The blue cheese crumbles were enough. I added an extra cup of chicken and cut the hot sauce back slightly. Served with Fritos scoops. Topped with scallions. It is an much yummier while it is still warm. FYI

Super easy, fool proof and versatile.  I modified to what I had on hand...I used 3 canned chicken ( we like chunkier ) Used only one 1/3 less fat  cream cheese block. but 3/4 cup ricotta cheese ( leftover from making lasagna last night ), 2 TBSP Allouette chive cheese( another leftover item). and a small bottle ( 5oz) of Frank's red hot sauce, a small handful of fresh grated parmesan cheese ( you guessed it, leftover item). topped with a sliced muenster cheese torn up in pieces. Microwaved until bubbly. Ha ! it tasted like any other buffalo dip I've had, and I am happy I've used up some leftover the goods in the fridge ! Like I said, VERY FOOLPROOF !

This was really good.  Followed the advice in the top rated review and layered it in a baking dish.  Went over well for New Year's day football with Sociables crackers, carrots and celery sticks.

I love this dip. The second time I made it I used 8oz cream cheese and 8 oz of sour cream. I liked that a bit better because it made it creamier.

I made some simple changes to this recipe. I parboiled 2 chicken breasts and shredded them instead of using canned chicken. I mixed the shredded chicken with Franks Red Hot Wing Sauce and let it sit in a bowl while preparing the other ingredients. I mixed the softened cream cheese with 1cup blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. I also did not used all the shredded cheddar this recipe calls for. I used about 3/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and mixed it into the cream cheese mixture. After in was sufficiently incorporated, I added in the shredded chicken. I mixed this all together and placed it in a 13x9 baking pan. I topped it with a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese & baked it at 350 until it was bubbling around the edges. I served it with tortilla scoops. It was a hit at our Christmas Eve party & I will be making it again!

Canned chicken did not taste good at all. Taste more like tuna. I prefer using real chicken. Chicken wings don't come from a can! Also, I eat my wings with blue cheese. If this recipe called for real chicken and blue cheese, it would taste a lot better and rate higher.

I used two chicken breasts  (might go with three next time), cooked in the crockpot. I drained and shredded the chicken and put all the ingredients back into the crockpot on high for about an hour, with an extra half cup shredded cheese. Very easy and dangerously good.

This turned out great.  This is a heavy appetizer and the recipe 'as is' produces a pretty large volume of dip.  You could cut this in half (one can of chx, one crm chz etc.) if making this for a family of four but for large groups this is great.  This will get eaten up, we barely had any leftovers.

Was fast and easy with canned chicken. Putting boiled chicken in a blender also works. My friends usually make this with more chicken . I would probably add a little more chicken next time ,but I like this version which is easier to scoop

I make this recipe a lot and everyone loves it. I don't usually make any changes, but depending on who will be eating it, I may occasionally add a bit more hot sauce. When I bring it to potlucks I never bring any home. I usually use 2 boxes of the Chicken in a Biscuit crackers if I can't find the bigger box at the store.

This recipe certainly deserves 5 stars. It's a good base for a simple and easy dip but I also made some changes after reading the reviews and was very happy with the results. I used 3 cups of shredded chicken I made in a slowcooker just seasoned with salt and pepper. After that, I just threw all the ingredients straight into a slowcooker on low for a few hours. I also used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, and probably an entire cup (and a splash extra) of Frank's red hot because I like it hot. Turned out great! Not the prettiest dip I've ever made but super yummy. I think it's also good left over and the longer it sits the longer the flavors come together.

This dip is awesome. I halved the recipe but kept the same amount of chicken and buffalo wing sauce. I also put the celery in a food processor then added it straight to the dip for a little crunch. So yummy!!

TOO MUCH CREAM CHEESE!! Besides that the recipe is very good! I cooked regular chicken tenders and shredded it myself instead of using canned chicken as well. Following this recipe to a T in my preference made it too creamy.

I had a can of chicken from Costco I needed to use.  I cut  the recipe in half and made all in one pan, on the stove, in about  10 min. Tasty. Served with tortilla chips and celery to dip and had some sour cream for those that thought it a bit spicy. Oh, and  I had some red grapes on hand to eat on the side. They countered the spice nicely as well.  Great lunch/snack. Keeper for sure!

I use this basic recipe but add pulled rotisserie chicken instead of canned, use Buffalo Franks Sauce and real blue cheese crumbles( about 1/2 container). I have given the recipe at work after a potluck to about 300 people, including people who have told me they "don't like blue cheese"  prior to trying it!

It turned out great! I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and Franks Wing Sauce. Definitely a hit in our house!

Am I the only one who finds this way too spicy? I used less pepper sauce (1/2 cup) than called for and still can't eat it. Like the idea, but not for me.

I used ranch instead of blue cheese dressing as crumbles we're really cheesy on their own. Otherwise stuck to the recipe. Took it to a party and received rave reviews from everyone! Great crowd pleaser.

I used about 1.5 lbs of chicken breasts (about 3) instead of the canned chicken. Cooked as said and put in the crockpot.This recipe is delicious and easy! I took it to a bachelorette party where it was a huge hit!

I make it with either all blue cheese dressing or half blue cheese and half ranch and I've had people like it better that way. It's always one of the first things gone at a get together when I bring it!

I made this for our Super Bowl party and it was a hit.  I ended up using twice as much chicken (4 cans instead of two).  With just two cans I found it just too gooey without enough substance.  I also used the lower fat cream cheese and ranch dressing.  It was quite delicious but very rich for me.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make it again!

I used blue cheese vs ranch salad dressing. I used Frank's hot sauce as recomended. Everyone loved this dip. Personally, I thought it was a bit salty. Wondering how to cut the salty taste?

I followed the recipe exactly as written. Did anyone else think it was too salty?
Hubby thought  it was extra salty also and he usually adds salt to everything he eats. 
Don't get me wrong, it was good, but probably won't make again.  Will try a different version and see if it's better.

Very easy and quite delicious!  I made it a five star appetizer by using Bleu Cheese dressing instead of Ranch, and used Mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar.  I baked at 350 degrees about 20 minutes (until brown around the edges).  Using the crockpot would be ok if being transported, but baking perfects it.

I cut the serving size in half. I used leftover chicken, that's all I had on hand, I followed the recipe as written, except I didn't put it in the crockpot, just mixed everything in the sauce pan and then transferred it into a serving bowl. This was a great easy dip. I'll be making this again for sure.

Great Party Dip,  After a few times of making this dip, I made some adjustments.  I use Franks Red Hot Buffalo Sauce vs the pepper sauce (it makes a huge difference) Instead of 1 cup of ranch, I use 1/2 cup of ranch & 1/2 cup of Blue Cheese dressing and if I am not pressed for time, I use real shredded chicken.  I feel like the buffalo sauce really gives it that wing flavor that I think the pepper sauce lacks! Otherwise this dip is definitely a HUGE hit whenever I make it!

I made this for football Sunday. Everyone loved it. I went a bit less on the hot sauce, cause some people complain when I make things too hot. 
I also put it in the oven instead of the crock, to save time.
I had people ask to take it home with them, so I guess I did a good job.

Everyone loves this dip! I made it multiple times over the holidays and it was always a huge hit. We served it with tortilla chips instead of crackers and I only use Frank's Red Hot sauce. It's the best!

Well, for all that thought why this deserved five stars? Simple, follow the instructions! I made a few changes, not ingredient replacement but additional chicken. It was very simple to make and delicious for the football games! If you know what flavors you are gonna like or not like......please read the ingredients first!

As written this recipe is not very good, rather than give a bad review, I made it a different way the 2nd time. First i used rotisserie chicken, canned chicken is not good nor ideal for this dip. I halved the cream cheese, used frank's hot sauce and did not mix in the ranch dressing, we spooned it on top of the dip. Those who got oily or greasy results, what kind of cheese did you use? Cheap or store brand cheese is mostly oil and when melted makes everything oily.  Good the 2nd time around, next time i will boil and shred chicken breasts and incorporate some green onions.

Loved this simple recipe ! I used a rotisserie chicken, and what I had on hand as far as shredded cheeses, and about 1/2 ranch 1/2 blue cheese dressings. It was gone fast during football game ! Used sturdy tortilla chips for dipping. GREAT recipe

It's a hit every time. This time, I decided to experiment.  Instead of buffalo sauce, I had some Parmesean Garlic wing sauce from Buffalo Wild Wings and I used it instead. Everyone loved it and I plan on trying other flavors as well!

I recommend this dip to everyone. Whenever there is a get together this recipe will do it. I made one change from this recipe. InsteAd of using the recommended hot sauce I used the hooters hot sauce. Fresh chicken was used in this recipe. The chicken was actually cooked separate. Friends and family loved it. I have used this dip for other foods as well.

This is excellent!  The only thing I changed was to use 4 cups boiled chicken breast, shredded (approx 3 breasts) and it was a hit!  Tip: find a serving bowl that holds its heat as the cream cheese will start hardening as it cools. Will definitely make again

I made this for tailgating at a Bills game and it was a big hit with everyone.  I did not use canned chicken I had shredded chicken in the freezer (about 1.5 cups).  I loved the cream cheese in this dip, made it a lot creamier and more flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've been making this recipe for  years.  I mix everything together (only 1/2 the cheddar) and heat it in the microwave.  Then transfer it to a crock pot to keep it warm, putting the remaining cheddar on top.  I love it with Triscuits.  I use Lite Ranch and Lite Cream Cheese and it's fantastic.

Great recipe with modifications made according to the other cooks (thank you!). Used poached chicken thighs instead of canned chicken. Heated it up in pan, as suggested, but put all the cheddar in up front (didn't see a need to keep the portion out?). Kept it warm In crock pot for a party and served it with soft pretzel nuggets. Was a huge hit. The only reason I didn't give the main recipe 5 stars was because it calls (bizarrely) for that canned chicken.

i give it 4 not because its not amazing but i changed the recipe myself to make it better... canned chicken should be a crime lol i but a cooked rotisserie chicken, (our local store sells hot cooked chickens like 1-.15 lb chicken)  i pull it apart, and cut it up and add it in. i also use corn chips the scoops :)

This is a really easy dip to make and wildly popular with my daughter and her friends.  I modified it a little bit b/c I didn't want to use the slow-cooker.  I mixed about a cup of chopped celery into the dip before baking , and then I baked it with a layer of shredded cheddar on top at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes, or until the top is getting toasty brown in spots.

This dip is not only great tasting but simple to make.  It's even better when you cut up pita bread, heat the bread in the oven and spread this dip on the bread!!! This dip definitely makes the cut for one of my Superbowl dishes.

I did what one of the reviewers suggested "lasagna style"  I  mixed the cheese and dressing together, mixed the chicken and sauced together, layered that on the cheese mixture and topped it all with the cheddar cheese. excellent!

This is my go to. It was the rave of everyone in the office last year. One piece of advice. Do not use sargento cheddar cheese. Wow. It was bogo a few months ago, so I bought it. There were red oil deposits all through the dip. Tried stirring, reheating and stirring. Lol. It was gross and no one in my house would eat it. Stick to Kraft or the store brands.

I make this dip all the time for get-togethers.  It is my husband's favorite dip.  Super yummy!  I added a little extra sauce to add some more spice and usually use rotisserie chicken.  We serve with Fritos Scoops.  So good!

This was a huge hit in my family. I only had a whole chicken so I roasted that first and just threw everything in my slow pot and let it melt together. We used bolo loaves from Krogers and split them in half. Then I buttered them and sprinkled half with garlic salt and the others with a pizza seasoning grinder. We will be making it again.

Very tasty and easy to make. Always gets gobbled up quickly. Only complaint is it was a little too cream-cheesy, so I've started using just one package instead.

I LOVE this dip! it's my absolute favorite. I have started tweaking it a little, but only by doing half the called for ranch, and then using bleu cheese for the other half. gives it a little extra tang. I make it all in a pot on the stove and let it simmer for about 10 minutes after everything is mixed together rather than putting it in the crock pot. less dishes, and ready in like 20 minutes. I converted a non-buffalo person to loving it because of this dip. Not hot by any means, just the perfect amount of heat. I can eat it non-stop and no issues. Delicious!

I have made this dip different ways, but I normally make it with canned chicken (Tyson premium white chicken). I definitely want to make it with rotisserie chicken or boiled chicken to see if there is a big difference or not. I made some recently with ranch seasoning where you mix it with mayo and milk and loved the results... Tasted better than just regular ranch dressing. Also, warming the cream cheese, Frank's hot sauce (buffalo style) and ranch dressing together then mixing it with the chicken is a must before baking it. How hot you make it depends on what crowd your making it for!

I made this when I had company come over for dinner.  I followed the recipe.  I served it with mini toasted breads I found in the deli and celery.  Everyone loved it!  It does make  a lot of dip.  I was able to reheat the dip the following day to the same successful results.

I have been making this dip and trying different variations, do not add ranch, also using Franks Red hot original seems to be the best hot sauce. don't use the buffalo sauce, it leaves a odd after taste and other hot sauces just do not have the kick to them.

Thanks for the great recipe!! I am not a ranch fan so I used blue cheese dressing instead. I boiled chicken breast and then chopped it up. Added a little bit of blue cheese crumbles. Topped it with the sharp cheddar cheese and green onions. Served it with scoop Tostitos and celery sticks.

My only problem is that the person who shared this recipe didn't say how much chicken to use. Seriously it's not that hard to do.

This turned out OK.  Not as good as I would've liked it to be.  My guest did say it was good but there was plenty left over and no one asked for the recipe.  I think I will cut the recipe by half except the amount of chicken.  It was too much dip and not enough chicken.

This is always a big hit at parties. I never felt the desire to use canned chicken, so I bake chicken breast and then shred it.  I serve it in a small crockpot so that it stays warm throughout the event.  It goes great with tortilla scoops.

This is a very good dip.  However, it needs adjustments, for sure.  Add more chicken.  I used a rotisserie chicken because I don't like canned chicken.  You only need one thing of cream cheese, and I used reduced fat.  Reduce the amount of cheddar cheese to a half cup.  Reduce the amount of ranch dressing by half.  You may need to add some more hot sauce (I used Franks wing sauce and it was delicious but really not that spicy).  I also added green onions, and loved the flavor they added.  I'm going to make this for every party I attend...it was that good. But I'd never make it per the recipe.

This has become a standard party dip in our house and friends always ask me to bring it to their parties. I have made it with both ranch and blue cheese dressing and both are delicious. I was weary about canned chicken but I use the Kirkland brand and it makes prep easy and tastes great.  I always use the Frank's Buffalo sauce and highly recommend. Excellent recipe!!  Thanks for sharing.

This dip is very flavorful and delicious! I used 1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce instead of Frank's and Buffalo Ranch instead of plain. Perfect heat and flavor!

The first time I made this, I made it exactly as specified in the recipe. It was good, but the hot sauce had an afterbite I didn't enjoy, and it was a little too tangy for my taste. The second time I made it I used Cholula hot sauce, which was much smoother without losing any of its fire, and I reduced the Ranch dressing by about 25%. The result was perfect, smooth and creamy and delicious.

I made modifications, but it tasted great even with them. I used fat free Ranch, light cream cheese, and buffalo sauce. Trying to stay healthier, so dipping carrots and celery, no crackers. But boy would it taste yummy with them!

I added my own spin to the recipe. I used a pound of boneless skinless chicken cubed. I seasoned the chicken with sazon and cayenne pepper, then marinated it in franks red hot in a ziplock bag in the fridge for  about a hour.I made the chicken in a frying pan with some oil, drained  out the extra stuff and added the creme cheese, ranch and some  cheese (american, hot pepper and mozzarella).  You have to play around with the hot sauce to find the right amount, I used alot. I then put it in the crock pot on low. Awesome!

I thought it had too much ranch dressing flavor. If I make it again, I would cut the amount of ranch in half, or maybe substitute blue cheese dressing as many people seem to from the other reviews.

Amazing! I have made this a few times now and every time I get rave reviews!
Only change I've made is using shredded chicken breast instead of the canned chicken. Ranch works great, as does blue cheese dressing or a mixture of both.  I definitely will be making this again.
Thank you!

Always disappears when I bring it to a party.  I also put it in a 9x13 dish and heat it in the oven on 350 for about 20min (until the sides bubble) rather than keep it in a crock pot.  Delicious!

Everybody loves this recipe. They ask for it at many gatherings. It's always a hit. Can sub blue cheese dressing for the ranch but ranch is usually safer as not everyone likes blue cheese.

I have made this dip several times for different parties. Everyone raves about it and always asks me to make it again. I follow the recipe exactly as written. As far as the hot sauce, I always use Frank´s RedHot Buffalo Wings Sauce. Thank you!

This was delicious!  I made it for a super bowl 50 get together.  I used 2 boneless chicken breast baked for 25 minutes covered with aluminum foil diced one and shredded the other for better texture.  Also added 1/4 cup of blue cheese dressing.  Turned out amazing!

Made this for a super bowl party and it was a hit. I followed a lot of the reviewers suggestions though and made changes. I poached a chicken breast and shredded it rather than using canned chicken. I also added 2T of butter when simmering the Hot sauce and chicken. I hate ranch so I crumbled 1c of blue cheese in instead and skipped the cheddar. This tasted just like buffalo wings without the sticky fingers!

Delicious!  Made this for Super Bowl and it was a definite crowd pleaser.  Served with carrots, celery and tortilla chips.  I made this dip as the recipe is written, except didn't use a slow cooker. After I mixed everything together in the skillet, I just transferred it to a pot and simmered on low for 40 minutes.

Used 1 rotisserie chicken (18 oz meat) instead of canned. Baked in oven for about 35 minutes at 375 degrees. Turned out delicious. My husband said it was the best I ever made. Guests wanted some in to-go containers. Great for super bowl party.

Followed recipe exactly (only change used rotisserie chicken) but it was too creamy/cheesy and not balanced with enough hot sauce.  This was also was too heavy for the family.

Made this for a get together for about 8 people, it was too much recipe but it was very well received, didn't taste it myself (vegetarian) but everyone else seemed to love it! Used three skinless, boneless chicken breasts boiled in water for 20 minutes and separated. Also layered In the baking dish (hot sauce + chicken mixed, next later cheese mixture, etc) as someone suggested instead of mixing it all together and it had a nicer appearance, instead of orange. Served with cut veggies for the appearance of health :)

it turned out good except the amount of hot sauce was too much for alot of people, i think i did 1/2 cup or to taste. I wouldn't use a slow cooker for this kind of dip,  i think oven is much better.

It's a bit spicy for my palate, but my husband who loves all things buffalo chicken requests this dip!! Overall, it's a great dip that's easy to throw together for a party, and it's always a big hit! 
I like that the ingredients are "cooked" together first as it allows the cream cheese to blend together instead of dumping it all into a crockpot and having chunks of cream cheese.  I would agree with other reviewers about the extra cheese--it does look rather oily. I just stir it in the crock pot a few times before serving, but you could probably use freshly shredded cheese or omit it altogether.

I used half ranch/half blue cheese. Used cooked chicken breast. Used half red hot/half buffalo sauce. Shredded my own cheddar rather than buying pre-shredded.

I have been using this recipe for years and it is expected at every party we throw! I finish it in a crock pot to keep it warm instead of the oven. Play with the amount of Franks Red Hot sauce (it has to be that brand) sooooo good!

I made this for New Year's Eve, everyone enjoyed it and it as it was nice and spicy, but I didn't put the right amoun of cream cheese in since I didn't have enough - I more than doubled the recipe and kept it in the slow cooker.  I also used all lactose free cream cheese and shredded chedder and it was still great.

This dip was a hit! I did change one thing I used 1\2 cup wing sauce and 1\4 cup hot sauce. We had a few who wouldn't have handled it this hot. LOVED IT!!! Will definitely keep this recipe!!!

I cut down the hot sauce to 1/2 cup because my family doesn't like it too hot. I thought it was just right. Will make again.

I made this with a couple changes. First, I had a bit of bacon I wanted to use up, so I made bacon bits in a skillet, then put them aside and started the chicken and hot sauce in the bacon drippings. I also wanted a dip that I could make ahead, and then reheat at service time. So I cooled the mix first, and spread all of the grated cheese on top. Then for a top layer (and a bit of sweet to compliment the spicy) I made a zig-zag pattern of ketchup on top. After I reheated it, I sprinkled the bacon bits and some green onions on top :) I will definitely make it again. Love the simplicity, and the how friendly this recipe is when you want to change it up! Next time I think I will try a sprinkle of red peppers sliced olives on top...

Excellent recipe and dip. I experimented with various dipping materials, and settled on California Sourdough (sliced). I further cut each slice into squares or rectangles (roughly, except along curved edges), so that it would be easy for guests to put small amounts of dip onto them for snacking. The bread was not hard, but it was firm enough to hold the dip. It made for a nice taste combination. Definitely a winner!

THIS IS KILLER!!!  OH MY GOD!!!  I love onions, so I cut some up into small pieces and cooked before the chicken. The chicken I used was the roasted chicken from the grocery store, it has really good flavor.  Then I added the chicken, hot sauce etc.  Probably put more cheddar in, but hey can't have enough cheese, right???  I almost want to keep it for myself rather than have it for Xmas Eve......

This mix of ranch, cream cheese and hot sauce is delicious!  But beware if you don't usually eat spicy things -- it was waaaaay to "hot" for me!  (But I know I don't deal with "heat" well.)  I started with 1/4 c of Frank's and stuck with that.  Any more than that, I wouldn't have been able to eat it.

The only thing I changed is that I boiled 3 chicken breasts, and then shredded them. It turned out  fabulous! Took a batch to a party, and it was literally gone in 45 minutes! Can't wait to make it again!

I like this recipe for a base start and have made it according to instructions and varied it some. It best with the following adjustments:

Swap ranch for a good bleu cheese dressing (I get a soup cup from a local restaurant that is outstanding and worth it)! 

Swap the canned chicken for 2 large chicken breasts or 3 smaller ones. Steam them in a pan with water and then pull apart with fingers once cooled.

Add 2 Tbsp of Kerry Gold butter to the shredded chicken and sauce...just enough to bring it all together.

Lastly, mix the bleu cheese and cream cheese together and spread evenly on the bottom of a baking dish, layer the chicken mixture on top of that, and finally the shredded cheese.

Heat the oven to 400 and bake to let all of the ingredients heat through (15 minutes). 

We like this best with a good tortilla chip and celery sticks for dipping...YUM!!!

I  use whole chicken breast instead of canned. Boil chicken breast and then shred with fork. Also, I use less ranch dressing than called for. My family prefers dip more chunky than soupy!

Love this recipe, but DO NOT USE CANNED CHICKEN! Trust me, try it with real chicken, the results are so much better. For the best flavor, I don't think Frank's Red Hot can be beat as far as hot sauce in this. We have made it without the shredded cheese, and to me there's no measurable difference in flavor, and you save a little bit of fat. So good!

I did make some modifications. I poached the chicken breasts in chicken stock and Frank's red hot to get the flavor into the chicken. Not sure if it mattered, but I will always do it this way. Used blue cheese dressing not ranch. Makes no sense to use ranch. I also used Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo wing sauce in the recipe. Also, real crumbled blue cheese in the recipe and then topped it off with some additional. People raved!

Love this recipe with the blue cheese dressing & real chicken.  I use my pressure cooker for everything, especially when I have to shred.  I cooked 4 whole chicken breasts for 20 min at 15psi, let the pressure go down, opened it, & stirred.  It literally fell apart.  I also used the broth in the pressure cooker, to keep it moist since I put it all in a slow cooker to keep it warm. Adding butter is even yummier, but it adds to the cholesterol.

I had this at a football party and had to beg for the recipe. I don't even like buffalo sauce normally. This dip is so addicting and so simple to make!

I put 1 cup of Frank's Hot Sauce in it instead of 3/4 because we like heat.  My family loves this recipe and we have made it numerous times.

This dip was delicious. It need more hot sauce so the next time I make it, I will double up on the hot sauce.

This is awesome!!! I use the white meat from a rotisserie chicken and only about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the buffalo wing sauce. But I'm a total wimp  when it comes to spicy food. This is great served with Chicken In a Biskit crackers, Sociables, a spoon or anything else!

Fantastic recipe! However I made a few changes: I didn't use canned chicken (ew), instead I boiled some chicken breasts (about 1.50 pounds of chicken, then shredded it), I grated my own sharp cheddar cheese off the block (Ive read from other comments that using pre-packaged shredded cheese makes it more oily), and I used 1 full cup of hot sauce instead of 3/4 of a cup. I highly recommend modifying this recipe with these changes. Enjoy!

This recipe makes a TON of dip!  It's a great dip for sportsball games and it really does taste like Buffalo Chicken.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I would try it with rotisserie chicken, as suggested by other reviewers, but I'm not knocking the canned chicken.  This is a perfect kind of use for that kind of ingredient.
I served it with a variety of crackers, carrot sticks & celery sticks.

Awesome! We added extra hot sauce and used cheddar veletta cheese instead of stressed to try to avoid the greasy aspect. Turned out great! I would add a little bit more chicken next time.

This recipe jumps to 5 stars when you use fresh shredded chicken breast or left-over roasted chicken (shredded) and also add some quality blue cheese and fresh chopped green onions.  Canned chicken? NO WAY!

Use rotisserie chicken! I use rotisserie to replace a lot of "regular chicken" in recipes. Other than that this stuff is good!

Terrific! This recipe makes for a great side dish for any sporting event (or pro wrestling, my area of expertise). The only changes I made were swapping out the Frank's Red Hot for sriracha sauce and omitting the chicken-flavored crackers (since I fully admit I don't know what those are) and celery. Even with those omissions, this ended up being a hit at our Wrestlemania 30 party.

We make this for most adult parties.  It's awesome.  sometimes I use ranch dressing and sometimes I use blue cheese. Sometimes I swap out the cream cheese for sour cream, depending on what I have available. Both taste great, the sour cream recipe is just thinner.  I leave everything else alone.  My favorite is probably the blue cheese dressing and the cream cheese.  It's easy to make also!  Enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  It is very, very tasty and came together just fine  but it's oh sooo greasy!!  I spooned off 1/2 C. of grease while it was in the crockpot.  Next time I might chop up some celery leaves and sprinkle on top before serving, a little freshness wouldn't hurt.  I served with tortilla chips, I will probably make this again during football season.

I have made this dip many many times!!! The only changes I made were cooked real chicken instead of canned and I put it in an 8x8 in the oven long enough to melt the cheese. My co-workers beg and pay me to make this. They love it. I have shared the recipe with friends who loved it too. Super fast and easy to make and great football food!!!

I didn't make any changes and it was great.  Creamy bleu cheese dressing could be used instead of ranch also.

This is SO GOOD! My fiancé and I made this the other night with some leftover chicken, and loved it. We followed the recipe, though for just the two of us, we might halve it in the future-- the full batch is party-sized for sure! This is sure to be a favorite in years to come.

This has become a standard for Super Bowl.  It is very easy to make and very tasty with celery.

Delicious!!! Excellent way to use leftover chicken breasts.
I would never use canned chicken
I too did not use the cheddar cheese and substituted blue cheese instead of ranch. 
Guess I have finally done what I get frustrated with others doing. Change a recipe and rate it.

I've made this twice for game day now. I just dump everything in the crock pot together and warm it up. It's good! Next time I'm going to put chicken breasts in the crock pot overnight, pull it myself, then add the other ingredients--the chunk chicken is just not the right texture I think.

I transferred this to a crockpot from the skillet and added the cheese... It came out very good. Keep it warm... It's not good when it's cold. I wouldn't be opposed to adding some chili powder next time for more heat! Super easy and great for potlucks.

We have made this several times for tailgating parties and it is always a hit.  A friend of mine substituted blue cheese dressing for the ranch, I normally do not like blue cheese but it was fantastic.

I've made it several times, only things I've ever changed was to add some green onions and garlic. But it's amazing with to without those add-ins! Try this, you can't go wrong!

Family favorite! Usually have to make a triple batch when it's game time! My teenage boys love it with pretzel rods and pita chips. I use Franks Red Hot Wing Sauce and it works great.

I would have given the recipe 5 stars, but I did have to make one change to make the dip have the zing I was looking for. I had to add a bit more hot sauce than what was stated (I'd guess it to be a whole cup vs the 3/4c) when I tasted the dip before baking it, it was very light and cream cheesy. It was still good, but I was looking for more of that buffalo zing. I also added a light dusting of cilantro for a garnished look. Great recipe none the less!

We used blue cheese dressing in place of the ranch dressing and the flavor was excellent. If you like blue cheese, try this substitute!

I made this recipe on a whim to supplement a casual weekend lunch.  I used President's Choice (a Canadian brand) Buffalo Wing Sauce, and added a lot more than called for simply because I love the flavour.  As with many reviewers, I used fresh chicken, and basically stir fried it in vegetable oil until it was cooked, and then added the wing sauce.  Also, in the interest of not having to clean another dish, I added all of the cheddar cheese right into the mixture and didn't bother to heat in the slow cooker or oven.  It turned out great nevertheless!

This is always a hit for parties. Serve with chicken and biscuit crackers and celery.  The only difference for me is I use hot buffalo wing sauce instead of just hot sauce. Great both ways though.

I made this on Sunday for our Super Bowl party and everyone LOVED it! I followed the recipe as written except I don't have a slow cooker so instead (following other reviews) I put it in the oven for 20 minutes at 350....came out perfect!  I also took others' advice and shredded my own cheese instead of using the pre-shredded bagged cheese and the cheddar melted beautifully!  This one's definitely a keeper, I had people asking if I had anymore after they practically licked the dish clean:)

This was the simplest and best buffalo chicken dip I have ever had. I used fresh chicken breast which I boiled and shredded and then sauteed in the hot sauce just long enough to coat. I used extra franks buffalo wing sauce and by extra I mean an entire medium sized bottle and after cooking the chicken in the hot sauce I mixed it all in a bowl with about a cup of Monterrey Jack cheese and tossed it in the crock pot for a few hours until hot and bubbly. It turned out awesome and I had no issues with it separating. I do think it would be good without any added cheese but the Monterrey Jack cheese was an awesome addition. Thanks for a simple and great recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as above and everyone loves it.  The color doesn't seem to bother anyone that I know and I use the packaged shredded cheese with no problem there. It is a good recipe just the way it is!  I served mine with Scoops tortilla chips and I have a small slow cooker so it all works good for me.  I am not one to mess around with a recipe.

This was good. I don't do canned chicken so I cooked two breasts and chopped it myself. I mixed it with the franks and 1 cup of the cheese and layered this on top of the cream cheese and dressing mixture (I used bleu cheese instead of ranch). Next time I'll use a chunky bleu cheese dressing. I topped with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese. It ended up being a tad oily but was tasty. This makes a ton of dip. I used carrot slices and it worked great.

Delicious! I had it as a dip and also over rice with some fresh broccoli in it! Took less than the 45 mins. to prep. Used less fat cream cheese and it was fine.

This recipe was so good at our Christmas Eve party it was the first thing to be eaten up.  This is going to be our go to BCD from now on and it's so easy. We used cooked chicken instead of canned since we didn't have the canned on hand and it is definitely worth making!

This is a much better version of how I used to make buffalo chicken dip. The only change I made was the chicken; I poached a little over a pound of chicken breast in seasoned water (celery seed, salt, and cayenne pepper) instead of canned chicken (which is good in a pinch). Yum, yum :)

Very delicious. Although it was too spicy for me, the spice-loving members of my family ate every last drop.

I cut the amount of cream cheese in half so that it wouldn't dilute the flavor. It's perfect!

Incredible!!  I doubled the recipe, threw it all in a 4 qt. Crockpot on low.  I used ranch dressing and mild shredded cheddar...ADDICTIVE!!  Also...used the Buffalo wing sauce not the pepper sauce.

I really liked it but I am trying it again without can chicken, the can chicken tasted good and the whole thing tasted great but I am thinking it would be much better with real chicken baked in the oven...

Awesome Recipe!!! I make this dip for almost every event we have.  There are never any leftovers to bring home. What I do differently is to exclude the crock-pot and to exclude the internal cheese. I move mine from the stove top to a glass 9X13 baking dish, which gives it around a perfect 1/2" layer for dipping. I then top the dip with a thin layer of the shredded cheddar cheese. You only want a thin layer of cheese or else it will be to hard for the crackers to dip through once it cools. From there I cover it with foil and put it in a 375 oven just until the cheese is melted. This dip is best when served warm but is also great when cooled down throughout the night during a party. Don't be afraid to use the canned chicken, No one can tell with the other ingredients. Also any brand of Buffalo wing sauce will work. This dip has the perfect buffalo wing taste without the heat.

Since I found this recipe about a year ago, I have made it about a dozen times for different family/friend get togethers. Everyone, and I mean everyone, loves it. I started jotting down the recipe to take with me when I take it somewhere because I have so many people ask for it, and also tell them I found it on All Recipes. Only thing I do different is adjust the heat depending on where I take it, as some don't like it that hot.

This was delicious!! As far as the hot sauce, I used 1/2 Frank's Red Hot and 1/4 Frank's Buffalo. I also used only one cream cheese packet and it turned out just fine. Most ingredients I used were light or reduced-fat as well. You really can't tell the difference.

I used blue cheese dressing and added 2-5oz containers of crumbled blue cheese to the mix. I also diced and sautéed celery in butter and put that in also. I baked for 30 minutes at 350.

I made a half portion to see if we liked it. LOVED IT! Purists can forego the canned chicken and substitute cooked free-range organically fed chicken if desired. Low fat cream cheese will reduce the calories but not the flavor. "Heat" can be adjusted by using more or less hot sauce (I used Frank's RedHot sauce). This is excellent.

Have made this recipe several times and is always a hit. Last time I made it, I didn't have cheddar cheese so used Velveeta mixed in  with other ingredients and three cooked and shredded chicken breasts. We liked it better because it was much creamier. Will make many more times. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I used fresh chicken breast instead of canned. I just sautéed it up in a skillet and then drained it before adding the other ingredients. I also put it in a casserole dish instead of a slow cooker, and baked it in the oven on 325 degrees for about 20-25 minutes, or until it bubbled. This is a favorite for friends at a football (or hockey) party!

YUMMY! You have just found the absolute BEST buffalo chicken dip! Everyone always loves this dip. This is a family favorite and is at every gathering we have - my married sons even make it themselves! The only change I make is I use either the cooked chicken strips (in the package in the meat dept.) or I get the cooked rotisserie chicken and use the breasts - other than that, this is perfect! I put it in the slow cooker on low to keep it warm with a bowl of scoops beside it and there is never any leftovers! Gotta try it - you'll love it!

Great recipe! Huge hit at my NYE party. One suggestion that worked out great was to buy premade chicked tenders from the store and used that instead of the canned chicken added a little bit more texture.

This was so good it got eaten up immediately! I didn't change anything, even with the canned chicken it was really good and nobody could tell, I used a bottle of buffalo wild wings mild sauce because I hate franks red hot, and it was amazing because their mild sauce is one of the best out there which helped make this dip incredible!

I usually try not to rate a recipe if I didn't follow it exactly, but I figured I am one of thousands of reviews for this recipe so why not. I took the advice of others and skipped the cheese and did 1/2 ranch and 1/2 homemade blue cheese dressing. I thought this was a little thick so I added a bit of milk to thin it out. I liked it and preferred this with vegetables over chips.

I mix the cream cheese, dressing, buffalo wing sauce, and stir in the cheddar cheese.  Meanwhile, I have been slow cooking chicken breasts.  Shred them, stir it in, and then zap it in the microwave.

Way too soupy!  All we could taste was cream cheese and ranch dressing with a hint of hot sauce. This recipe needs double the chicken and more hot sauce.  The original Frank's recipe on this site is much better!

I made this recipe for Christmas and my family and I loved it!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  This is the first recipe I've used that the pepper sauce does not pool on top of the dip, looking like a big grease spot!  I also like the fact that this doesn't need to be made in the oven.  I've trashed all my other Buffalo Chicken Dip recipes and this is the only one I will use in the future!!

Great Recipe!  I prefer to not use canned chicken though.  I typically use Curly's shredded chicken.  I serve with tortilla chips and garden veggie crackers.  I love it with the crackers!  For this holiday season ill be making this and trying something different.  I'm going to use fresh boneless skinless chicken breast and put in crock pot with the hot sauce to cook for about 8 hours.  Then I'll shred it, mix in the rest of the ingredients them out back I'm the crock pot.  This dip does really well in the crock pot and is why I always cook it in.  Keeps it warm for parties and easy to transport!

Oh my...despite the wacky orange color, this is so good!!!  I made it exactly as written but I think maybe next time I'll use bleu cheese crumbles in place of the cheddar.  Excellent appetizer that I'll definitely be making again and again!

Tried with one cup of ranch dressing and also half ranch/blue cheese dressing. Either way is absolutely phenomenal!

Whenever I take this recipe somewhere, which is often, everyone loves it! I've used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light ranch, and it's still great. I've also left out the cheese because I didn't have any, and it's still good. Some people prefer it with tortilla chips or different crackers.

I boiled a chicken and used 20 oz of the meat from that. Just pulled the chicken off the bones and cut up with scissors.  I also used my homemade ranch dressing.  I just mixed everything together (except half the cheddar) and then topped with remaining cheddar.  I didn't even fool with the crock pot.  Cooked it all in an iron skillet.  When I topped it with the cheddar I stick it in the microwave for about a minute to melt the cheese.  Serve with Ritz crackers, baguettes or tortilla chips.

This is a favorite in our household.  Of course, I use real chicken for this recipe.  I tried canned once as a shortcut, and it tasted fine, but it did have a tuna smell.  I do use half blue cheese and half ranch for the dressing.

If I make this again, I will reduce the cream cheese to 1.5 blocks and maybe add more chicken.  It was fine but not my favorite buffalo chicken dip.

This is awesome!  We make it all the time, but take major shortcuts.  Meaning, we put it all on the stove in one pot and keep stirring.  The only thing we hold out and add at the end is the cheese.

This is basically the only dish I am allowed to bring to parties now. I don't use the crock pot unless it's going to be sitting out for a while. A quick zap in the microwave will also do the trick if you're eating it right away and it's cooled off from cooking. 

I used 1/2 cup of Buffalo Ranch and a 1/2 cup Buffalo Blue Cheese (Wishbone) for salad dressing.I also put all the cheese in and let it melt. Very easy to make. Just double check that all the cream cheese is melted before serving.

I have made this several times, it is one of my " go to" recipes for potlucks and parties.  I recommend using 4 chicken breasts, poached and shredded.  I also grate a block of cheddar/ jack  than using the already shredded cheddar.  A little more work but definitely worth the trouble and the cheddar jack melts well.  A hit wherever I take it!

This was good for a quick buffalo chicken fix. Ie did layer instead of mixing all together. Eye appeal is the key. Enjoyed by the family.

This recipe is a huge hit with my family and friends. The only thing I do differently is that I use cooked and shredded boneless chicken breasts. I always serve this with tortilla chips.

I absolutely love this classic recipe. I've brought it to several potluck events and it has been a hit every time. It has always been funny to me when a person rates a recipe 4-5 stars and then says how they made "adjustments" but they end up making so many, it becomes a different recipe! Lol. However, I decided to add some shredded carrots the last time I made this because I had them lying around and I thought it would add a little more texture. Turned out great!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I do like this recipe! It is very easy... but instead I used real boneless chicken breast and sometimes I use blue cheese instead of ranch. Or I will do half a pan with ranch and half a pan with blue cheese.

We had to tone down the hot sauce and used about an eighth of what is called for. Otherwise, an amazing dip. Thank you for posting it. I first had it at a friend's Superbowl party years ago.

I have made this several times an brought it to different parties; it has always been a crowd favorite.  When I am making a double recipe for larger gatherings, instead of using can chicken, purchase a roasted chicken from your super market. I use half for the recipe and the other half for salads or pasta.

Everyone loves this!!  We make it all the time and people request it.  I have made this too many times to count. I make a homemade ranch (because any version off the shelf has MSG in it) and have used cooked chicken breasts if I was out of canned.  We always serve with tortilla chips.

The guys really love this recipe so I make it quite often. I leave out the grated cheese because I do not like the fact it gets so hard once cold and I dislike having to keep warming it up. The guys also like it better without the cheese. We are cheese eaters so it's not that we dislike the taste the cheese gives it's more the texture when cold that we dislike. For us it's so much better and perfect without the cheese. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Great recipe.  Its not quite the same as eating real buffalo wings but its a very good substitute.  Its a little cheaper to make and goes further at a large party as opposed to buying a 50 piece bucket of wings.  The only thing different I do with the dip recipe is that instead of using 3/4 cup (6 oz) of hot sauce, I buy one 5 oz bottle of Frank's Red Hot, and just add the whole bottle.  This way, there's no measuring, I just open the bottle and dump it in.  Besides, I love love it on the hotter side but some of my friends & family do not.  Using one whole 5 oz bottle seems to give the perfect amount of of heat, with enough hot sauce to give it a little kick and add good flavor but not too hot for people who don't like overly spicy food.  I think the dip is better served with Tortilla chips than crackers.

Made with shredded chicken breast instead of canned. Substituted 1 c. shredded mozzarella for cheddar cheese. Warmed and served in a crock pot. Was a hit at cookout. Next time will omit mozzarella cheese, as it really didn't add anything.

This was perfect, and so easy!  It had just the right amount of flavor, and not too much heat.  I was worried that it might be too spicy for my family's wimpy taste buds (myself included), but it was perfect.  If you like a lot of spice, you should add more hot sauce.  I followed the directions exactly (using canned chicken and Frank's Wing sauce), but served it with tortilla chips instead of crackers and celery.  I thought the canned chicken was just fine, despite the comments by other reviewers.

This is the most amazing buffalo chicken dip EVER! It is so easy to put together and then just keep it heated in the crockpot. I make a slight variation in that I use 1/2 cup ranch and 1/2 cup bleu cheese and I'll use either Frank's Red Hot or Buffalo Wing Sauce (or some of both). I've made this for a number of parties and will actually make it today again for my granddaughter's birthday party. It's gotten rave reviews every time!

Have made this several times for parties and potlucks and it's always very popular.  I like it served with pretzel chips and celery.  Seems like it would be simple to cut in half and, if you are so inclined, make it with low-fat ingredients to make it a bit healthier.  Thought, let's be honest, no one is eating this to be healthy!

I love this dip!  I do not used canned chicken though.  I either use a rotisserie chicken or poach some chicken breasts in chicken broth and shred them up.

Quite a yummy dip. I added a little more Velveeta and hot sauce than the recipe required. One bottle of Goya hot sauce and almost a whole bottle of Frank's Red Hot.

I make this on a weekly basis and it's amazing every time. I switch it up using Cheddar Jack cheese blend sometimes and that helps cut down on the grease. My husband likes to eat it on top of Doritos, with tortillas, or sometimes he tops his hotdogs with it.

Great dip! However I do doctor it up a bit when I make it. I add a couple of dashes of Worcestershire, 1t garlic powder, 1t onion powder, and usually add 2 cups shredded cheese.

Was a big hit at the pot luck, but you need to use regular cream cheese.  Low fat or fat free does not melt nicely.

My coworker makes this for every potluck and the entire office loves it. Everyone is always asking her ahead of time if she's making it and it's the first thing to go when it comes time to eat. I had some leftover canned chicken so I decided to make it today. I made the recipe exactly how you see it here, except I cooked at 20 minutes on 325 in a glass dish instead of using the slow cooker.  I even used all off brand ingredients, and it was delicious!  I used brand name Frank's Red Hot though... can't skimp on that! No doubt this would be even better with fresh chicken... but it's pretty perfect as is! Oh, and don't cut out the cheddar cheese... it adds a certain depth and dimension to the flavor, especially if you use sharp!

Excellent! I've been making this recipe for 4 years now for various get-togethers and it always receives rave reviews! I do add a bit of habanero pepper sauce (2 tbsp) to give it that extra kick. And I have made the recipe lighter using low-fat cream cheese, lite ranch dressing, and reduced-fat cheese...it's nearly as good as the full fat recipe.

I always mix everything on the stovetop and then transfer to a crockpot to keep warm throughout the party. I also prefer the dip with regular or baked tortilla chips. Delicious! Thanks!

I love this dip. I usually just cook the chicken shred it and mix all the ingredients in the croc pot and just stir occasionally. I also serve this with tortilla chips... Yum!

Followed exactly except used 3 medium sized chicken breasts. 2 Packs of cream cheese is too much, next time I will only use one and reduce the ranch and hot sauce to 1/2 cup as well as add more chicken.

I make this slightly different. In bottom of baking dish spread cream cheese, using whole chix breast (2) shread after cooking and mix with hot sauce and 6 tbls melted butter. Layer over cr. cheese. Next cover with a thin layer of ranch dressing and top with shredded cheese of your choice. Bake at 350 until cheese is melted. Everyone loves this and I never leave without being asked the recipe.

Excellent dip!  I make it all the time.  I use both mozzarella and cheddar for the dip.  Sometimes I substitute blue cheese for the ranch for a different flavor.  Great served with tortilla chips!  Reheats well.

This is a wonderful dip for a hungry crowd!  I liked the zesty taste!  I brought it to a small dinner party as an appetizer and we couldn't stop eating it.  I served it with french bread baguetts slices and crackers. I thought the bread was better with it.   I didn't try it with the celery and carrot sticks, but I am sure that would have been good too!

The flavor and creaminess were really good and tasty, but this was quite tame spice-wise, and that's the only reason 1 star is missing - next time we make it, we'll add more Red Hot and a few shakes of cayenne for oomph.

Awesome crowd pleaser, made this dip for every event for the last year, from potlucks and parties to family reunions and everyone just loves it.  Someone always wants the recipe.  At one family reunion I found an uncle just slathering it on a bun and having a Chicken Dip sandwich.  I just dump the whole 2 cups of cheese in, as the bags come in 2 cup portions.

This is perfect game day food! I used a lil less hot sauce for my families taste .... I also used a couple boiled & shredded chicken breasts the second time I made this and it tasted even better! Making it for superbowl for sure!!!  I would also like to try it with blue cheese or feta!

I make this every football Sunday! Everyone loves it. I never bother putting it in the crockpot and it comes out great anyway. Chicken in a biscuit crackers are a must! Enjoy!

Yummy, but the sauce (Frank's red hot---duh!) was too spicy for me and the kids. Made this for a football party and of course the guys loved it although a couple did mention that it was too spicy-of course they ate it all up anyway.! I did use shredded rotesserie chicken instead of canned chicken. The flavor was great, I will have to search for a less spicy wing sauce.

Make this dip often. I love buffalo chicken anything. This dip was good but I would use blue cheese dressing rather than ranch. Delicious!

I made this last nite, and my husband loved it!! Because my husband is not a fan of ranch I did you less than the recipe called for. Still was amazing we are going to make this again for sure.

This is a great recipe. I did take advice of others and used boiled chicken vs. canned. I buy pita pockets and load in the mixture and top with cole slaw! Yum!

Wonderful, easy dish!  Always follow the recipe, except for using a baked boneless chicken breast versus the canned chicken.  Always get requests for this recipe.  Cannot go wrong!

Really good.  I dont use canned chicken, I put 2 or 3 chicken breasts in a croc pot for a few hours and then shred.  I also use blue cheese instead of ranch.

This was SO good! I used the Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce wich is a little more tangy than regular hot sauce. Instead of canned chicken, I used one of those roasted/rotisserie chickens they sell at many grocery stores these days. Rather than using the slow cooker, and because we needed to transport the finished product to the party, I placed in a oven-safe dish and heated on 250. Everyone loved it!

we love this dip, it has become a staple in our house.  We changed up the recipe a bit cuz my husband doesn't like cream cheese that much.  We only use one package of cream cheese, 1 cup of buffalo sauce like Franks Buffalo Wing sauce  The more buffalo sauce gives it more of a kick and we use 3 to 4 chicken breasts that we chop up and cook in a pan then put into a food processor.  It doesn't get that canned chicken taste and we found to be less expensive.

I made this for an office potluck and it was FABULOUS! The only thing I did differently was to substitute bleu cheese dressing for the ranch dressing.  I served it as recommended with chicken-flavored crackers and celery sticks.  This will definitely go into my regular rotation of appetizer/snack recipes.

This was a hit as a game day app.  I used the meat right off of a rotisserie chicken because i couldn't bring myself to serve canned chicken.  I accidentally left out the cheese and it was still pretty darn good.

I started with the crock pot.  No since dirtying another pan.  Also, used 1/2 ranch and 1/2 blue cheese.  Cut back to 1 1/2 bricks of cream cheese and used 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar.  I even used turkey breast from a turkey I had to use that was in the freezer!  Awesome!

Absolutely amazing.  My co-workers make me bring it to every potluck we have.  I always double the recipe, using a whole bottle of ranch and a whole bottle of buffalo sauce, and stick it in a crock pot.  It helps to mash up the chicken; it distributes the meat more evenly through the dip.

Very easy and quick!  It tastes really good too.  I followed the original recipe this time just to familiarize with the recipe and taste but will also try with bleu cheese dressing next time as others have suggested.  It seems that moving from stove top to oven for the final step with the cheese sprinkled on top gave a great look and texture.  Highly recommend!

This is a great recipe I have used a lot. I usually use fresh chicken (chicken breast just boiled in water and shredded). But it's also good with canned chicken as a substitute. Usually I bake this the oven and serve warm with tortilla and pita chips.

I have been making a version of this recipe for many years, except I use 2-3 fresh chicken breasts, cook it and dice it small, then add 1 cup of frank's and warm a couple of minutes.  Then I add 2 pkgs of cream cheese, 1 cup blue cheese dressing (not the light stuff...), and a handful of shredded cheddar, or better yet, the pre-shredded mexi style cheese that has jalepenos and chili powder in it.  I serve it with tortilla chips, the low salt kind, but I like the suggestion of celery...I think I'll try that next time!!!

No need to add the cheddar cheese, substituted the blue cheese in place of the ranch.  To add chrunch I added a red and yellow pepper cut up in small pieces to the mixture before serving.

No need to  make any changes to this recipe...my family loves this so much. It never makes it out of the pot to a bowl..they literally stand while its making and eat it out of the pot with the appetizer of their choice...some just eat it with a spoon!  Great recipe I have used it many times and just wanted to say thanks. My oldest son makes it at his home all the time also. And also the Frank's Red Hot is the pepper sauce of choice.

Every time I make this recipe i get compliments on it. I have made it with fresh chicken shredded and canned, depending on the time I have and it truly is great both ways. Although I do prefer to use fresh chicken because I don't like to use any canned meat. My 16 year old daughter begs for this every time she knows we're having a get together :)

Really good easy recipe.  Cut the recipe in half and it made a generous portion for a family of five for an appetizer.   I also used blue cheese dressing in place of Ranch and half of a small container of crumbled blue cheese in place of the cheddar and it tasted great.  The use of less cheese did not make this runny.  Would make again based on the need for a good filling football season junk food snack.

This is the best! I wish I could give it more stars. The recipe posted is fantastic. However I have made a few changes to meet my needs lol. I use reduced fat Ranch and reduced fat cream cheese (gotta cut back somewhere lol), I use less shredded cheese, sometimes I don't use it at all. I add some cayenne pepper for more kick, and love using Franks Buffalo Wing sauce.

I LOVE this recipe!!! I made it for the first time last night. I wanted to test it out before making it for a get-together. My boyfriend, my dad, and I ate almost half the dish! It was sooo good. I made a few variations: I used low-fat, store-brand cream cheese and it worked just as well as regular, brand-name cream cheese. I also mixed the shredder cheddar cheese inside and also topped the dish with some so the top layer was a layer of cheese. I also mixed all of the ingredients on the stove-top (low heat), then put it into a baking pan and stuck it in the oven for about 20 minutes.

This is amazing. I'm not really sure how anyone can rate it under 5 stars. The only difference that I made was to use Crystal Hot Sauce and make a wrap out of it by using tortillas. It is to die for.

I always get compliments on this dip. I would highly recommend using boneless, skinless chicken breasts versus canned chicken. I boil three chicken breasts in water until they were cooked, drain the water, and then shred with a fork. I have also made this in the crock-pot (low for 2-3 hours) and it tastes just as delicious (as long as you don't mind the orange color)

I LOVE this dip...its like eating a hot wing without the mess. The only exception I made was I only used 1 cream cheese and a little more hot sauce (I like really spicey food). Definately a keeper.

Next time I make it I will be using fresh chicken without a doubt. I dislike canned chicken and you can taste the fact that it is in there. Otherwise its yummy! We used it at our big superbowl party and it was a hit!

This dip is awsome.  I just googled buffalo chick. ranch dip and this was the first one to pop up.  I used Franks Red Hot sauce.  It tasted better than Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce. Make it all the time. Everyone loves it.

Just awesome, nobody could get enough of this.  As suggested, I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  I also thought it needed a little salt, so I added about 1/2 tsp of celery salt.  I used the Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce, and the dish was very tasty, but next time I'm going with full-blown hot sauce for an even hotter kick.  Yum.

I have made this dip several times now.  I have made a couple of small changes to the recipe.  First, I do not use canned chicken, I boil 2 or 3 chicken breasts and then chop them up very finely.  I use my chopper from Pampered Chef and it works perfectly.  It almost minces the chicken so that you get a little chicken in every bite.  Second change is that I use half a cup of ranch and half a cup of blue cheese.  I serve with tortilla chips or chicken in a biscuit crackers.  It's awesome!

I made this for Super Bowl.  Not sure why, because I made it exactly like the recipe, but the cheese separated into a pool of orange grease.  It did taste ok, but no-one wanted to try since it looked so awful.  My cheese was fresh, so really don't know why this happened.

My family and friends did not care for this. Other than the spice from the pepper sauce this had no other flavor and the texture was not good. Made it for our Super Bowl party and I ended up not eating it all.

I used 2 boiled chicken breasts, as was recommended by others. I also added more hot sauce, and used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar for some more zing. It was gone before the first quarter. 
Side note: Do not eat with the Hint of Lime tortilla chips.

I had been given this recipe in the past, but the method was different.  This was just excellent!  Everyone really loved it.  I did put it in the oven though to melt the cheese instead of the crock pot.  Will definitely do this again.

This was okay.  I used roasted chicken, blue cheese dressing, and half buffalo wing sauce and half pepper sauce (Frank's brands).  I served it at our Super Bowl Party and people ate it, some commented they liked it.  I didn't particularly...and I love blue cheese and buffalo wings, so I was disappointed.  I probably won't make this again.  I believe if I had used canned chicken I would have rated this 2 stars.

I am constantly getting requests to make this!  I do make some alterations, by using a package of chicken tender cutlets and I par boil them.  Then drain the water off, cut the chicken in to pieces, and throw them in the pan with 1 stick butter and 1 cup hot sauce.  Cook it for a few minuets so get the hot sauce absorbed into chicken, pour it over the cream cheese into a crock pot and finish the rest of the recipe.  I take the crock put it in the oven at 400 degrees until the cheese on top is a bit brown and bubbly.  Then keep it warm in the crock pot and serve with tortilla chips.

Delicious!  One thing I changed was baking my own chicken breasts and then shredding.  Make sure and layer the cream cheese and Ranch (I used "Light" versions of both) on the bottom, then Chicken and Red Sauce, then shredded cheese.  Very yummy, will make again and again.  Great with celery sticks!

Good flavor with a kick.  Taste best if dipped with celery sticks. Used half cup each of ranch and blue cheese dressing. Someone mentioned to layer top with shredded cheese - don't...ended up baking it and it made a hard top cheese shell which ruined the consistency.

This was ok, but I didn't care for the texture. It was mushy. Maybe that's because I put the cooked chicken and sauce into the food processor a little too long, and the result was mushy meat. After that, even with all the other ingredients, it just wasn't all that appetizing. Be careful when you make this and don't do what I did.

This dip made a good addition to my super bowl party, but I made a few changes:  I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  It overwhelmed the flavor of the dip so I would not do this again.  Next time I will use half blue cheese and half ranch or all ranch.  Second, I used velveeta instead of shredded cheese.  I'm not sure if I liked that change either, so I will probably try the shredded cheese next time.  Overall, I would give my version of this recipe 4 stars, but I'm giving 5 stars since I think my dip would have been better if I had stuck with the original recipe.  Thanks for the great dip idea!!

Made only 1/2 of recipe. Used 1/2 blue cheese & 1/2 ranch dressing. Also used Frito scoops instead of chips. AWESOME!!!!

This dip is great....my roommate loved it so I knew I had a winnner to bring to the superbowl party I'm attending. I will say using straight blue cheese may be better than using blue cheese dressing (I didn't use ranch, I preferred blue cheese). Overall a great recipe, not sure if you need two 8 ounces of cream cheese seems excessive but tasty nonethheless.

I have been making this for the past couple of years and it is always a favorite. My college kids and their friends request it almost weekly.I have found it to be especially good using the breast meat from a rotiserie chicken. Then I use the rest of the chicken to make soup! I also blend blue cheese with the cheddar for the top. My son spreads it on bread and toasts it instead of crackers. YUM!

Made this today. I used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch and the Franks Red Hot sauce. I just made a half batch because nobody else in my household likes this sort of thing (cream cheese, bleu cheese, spicy). I loved it! I did the layer and bake method. I'm going to make it for my next church small group meeting. I'm sure they'll love it. I ate mine with celery. YUM!

This is recipe is really yummy! I did use canned chicken put I will cook my own chicken next time like some other people suggested. I used Texas Pete hot sauce and used more than the recipe called for.

I use two breasts like some of the other reviewers and then put it into a glass pan and bake in the oven at 375 for about 30 minutes or so. This is a good option if the crockpot is not available.

I've made this three times now and every time it flies out of the bowl!  It is really a great dish!  To make it easier I use a rotisserie chicken from the prepared foods section at the grocery store. 
Whenever I show up to a party without it I get asked why I didn't bring it!

I gave it a 3 star b/c I'm just not a fan of this dip.  My sister always makes it for occasions and people gobble it up.  I just think it's super greasy.

Made it for today's Packer game and it was a huge hit with the crowd.  I increased the hot sauce to 1 cup and used low fat cream cheese.  Recipe turned out great.

Pure Simplicity at its best. I made this for the family on new years, it was gone by the end of the night.  Also its a excellent use of left over chicken, just convert the measurements and dice up the chicken :D

This is an awsome dip.  I have made it about 6 different times and everyone raves over  it...I use the Franks Red hot that says " Buffalo wing " it gives it just a tad more Zing and use Tostino round or scoops to dip in..  So good my mouth is watering just thinkin about it.

This dip is amazing! We had it once at a party and I forgot to get the recipe so I came on here to look and found this. I made it and my husband was blown away. I am requested to make this for every party, in fact, I am making it for our club's potluck Christmas dinner tonight!! I would recommend using name brand items like Hidden Valley and Frank's since the flavors mesh beautifully rather than generic foods. It does make a difference.

Pretty good.  It was a large recipe.  I took half to a Christmas party in a mini crock and left the other half warming in the oven in a pie plate for hubby. Next time I would only make half for a gathering of this size (there were ~20 ladies, and we had some left over).   Eveyone loved it and I had several requests for the recipe.

I loved this and so did my famliy.  Only suggestion (as others commented) is to use 2 breasts of boneless skinless chicken breast parboiled and shredded very finely.  Also, I think I wouldn't put the cheese on top again as it doesn't lend itselft well to dipping with celery or nachos.

This dip has the zing of a buffalo wing in a bowl...creamy, flavorful, and not quite as messy as wings.  The hit of our football game get togethers!  Good with scoops or torn loaf of french bread.

This is naughty, delicious goodness! I used 2 poached chicken breasts and subbed light blue cheese dressing for the ranch and shredded mozzarella for the cheddar to save a few calories. This is very good scooped up with Triscuit Parmesan Garlic Thin Crisps.

This dip is delicious but has loads of oil on top.  I will leave the cheddar cheese out next time I try it and hopefully that will help and still taste great.

A friend brought this dip to a party at my house and I was hooked from the first bite. I don't normally eat spicy foods but for some reason I can't get enough of this dip. Instead of using canned chicken, I grill up a couple chicken breasts. I also serve the dip with tortilla chips.

Very Delicious. Even my little one liked it and she doesn't do well with spicy food. Didn't care too much for the cheese topping though. Think I will leave that out next time.

Very good recipe. I used fresh chicken breast which I broiled and then shredded. I just don't like canned chicken. This is a very good recipe which competes well with the bar and grills in my area. Thanks for the recipe

Very good! I used a whole bottle of Franks hot sauce, but I like kick, I also added some extra cheese at the end, yet it is all about personal taste. A great food for football to coinside with chips!

I have to mention this with Halloween coming up.  Halloween stores sell many thing, including food molds that look like human organs.  The color of this is perfect for the brain mold. Increase the recipe by half.  I see folks that I don't see all year who ask me "did you bring the brain?". Yes, I and my friends are sick, but man this dip is good!

Awesome!  I used more Frank's Red Hot than called for (1C) but followed everything else to a 't' - it was spicy but we couldn't get enough!  Ate it with celery (to cool off our mouths) and tostitos scoops.

This was a huge hit! Everyone at the party loved it and wanted the recipe. I did take the advice of others and shredded my own cheddar cheese.  I used Frank's Red Hot sauce. It does have some kick to it but if you like it real spicy I would add some additional hot sauce or cayenne pepper.

A simple but easy to make recipe! I've found it's also very easy to tweak by changing the hot sauce to another form of buffalo or wing sauce instead, and also to instead of canned chicken to grill your own and shred it. That provides a nice texture to it as you eat it too.   No matter how you tweak it, it's a great simple recipe!

yummy! i used rotisserie chicken so i could shred the cooked chicken faster and used extra sharp cheddar cheese instead! my boyfriend became selfish by not letting anyone eat it but him! :) i used two napkins to get the oil off the cheese on the top.. and used tositos flat rounds instead of crackers, goody-good! thanks for the wonderful recipeee

Followed this recipe as written and it turned out perfect. Made it for the first time for a potluck and everyone loved it. Next time I will just mix in the all of the cheese instead of sprinkling on top.

Very good basic recipe! I doubled and made it for a bacheleurette party, the girls ate it all night and there was not a bit left by morning! I did substitute the canned chicken with Sam's Member's Mark Grilled Mesquite Breast Fillets thawed and shredded. I also don't care for store bought ranch, so I made my own using buttermilk, sour cream, mayo and a packet of Hidden Valley Dry Seasoning! I threw it the crock pot, as it keeps it nice and hot for a party, and topped it with four cheese mexican cheese, yummy!

I first tasted this dip at a party and liked it so much i wanted to make it for my own party. I decided to use this recipe because it sounded alot like what the original cook said she did. I would change the recipe next time by either reducing the amount of cream cheese i put in or by adding more chicken. It was creamier than what i had anticipated and would like a chunkier texture. I used both blue cheese and ranch, but pretty much stayed to the recipe. I will make again , but with some minor changes.

Pretty good! I added a little more ranch and hot sauce. One of the party favorites!!! I served with tortilla chips instead of crackers though.

This dip is awesome! I did add more hot sauce to it. The next time I make it I will not use canned chicken it gives it a tuna fish smell/taste to it but otherwise it's great!!

This has been a hit every time I've made it both for work potlucks and family get-togethers. I've also made it with blue cheese instead of ranch and that works just as well.

This was amazing!!  Made it for 4th of July, everyone LOVED it!!  The store I went to didn't have the Frank's Red Hot, so I just bought regular Louisiana style hot sauce.  I served it with celery and Tostito's scoops and it was great.  The only thing I would do next time is skip the extra cheese on top, of course it was delicious, but it made it kinda hard to scoop up.

Good stuff!  I used 3/4 Cajun Chef Louisiana Wing sauce and 1/4 Stubb's Wicked Chicken WingSauce.  Also cut back the cream cheese to one 8 oz package, my preference for consistency.  Used bleu cheese dressing instead of Ranch and added a bit of blue cheese crumbles  to the top before baking.  Omitted the shredded cheddar altogether.  Used 2 frozen chicken breasts instead of canned chicken but I think canned would have been ok if it was all I had on hand.  I'll surely make again and probably add a 3rd chicken breast next time for a thicker, less saucy result.

Amazing dip!  I suggest taking the time to make "homemade" Hidden Valley Ranch dressing to use in this recipe.  It tastes SO much better than bottled dressing.

Very good, I made a half batch and eyeballed the hot sauce. I used actual buffalo wing sauce, I'm not sure if that's what was meant by pepper sauce, but it worked perfectly.  I would try it with bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch next time

I love this recipe! I used 1/2 cup of ranch and 1/2 cup of blue cheese (instead of a fully cup of ranch), and then served it with Blue Corn tortilla chips. Yum! Also, instead of using a crockpot, I just put it in a small casserole dish and popped it in the oven on 350 for about 15 minutes or so, just to help solidify it. I am not a lover of super-spicy things, and this dip is just right: the hot sauce is flavorful but not overpowering. I'll definitely bring it to our next football get-together! Oh, and P.S. the leftover dip, after being refrigerated, heats up really well!

This dip is AWESOME!! We do make it with bleu cheese dip for authenticity and bake it in a pie plate in the oven - this makes it super easy to take to gatherings - just throw it in the oven when you get there and it's hot and tasty for the party! It's a huge hit wherever it goes, everyone loves it!

oh my yum! This was so good, easy to make ahead of time. I wanted to bring it to a party, so I baked it instead of using the slow cooker. I also used fresh chicken, cut and shredded. I have made it a couple times, and have used both blue cheese and ranch. I honestly don't taste the difference, so I think that ingridient is interchangable. Enjoy!

I wasn't impressed with this at all.For one thing the taste of the hot sauce completely overwhelmed all the other ingredients.Another thing I didn't like was the pool of orange grease that accumulated on top.I tried skimming it off but I couldn't get all of it out.Instead of tossing this in the garbage I used it as a pasta sauce,I hate wasting food.If I ever make this again,and I highly doubt I will,I'd use 2 chopped chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken chunks and cut back on the hot sauce.Take my advice and look for some other dip recipe.

I used the can chicken just to be fast.  It was good, not great.  Next time I'll use chicken breasts that I've cooked myself and use more of it and I think it'll really hit the spot.

Tastes just like a buffalo chicken wing! Followed the recipe exactly (used chopped chicken from a roast) but will add more chicken next time to be more chunky. Served with celery & crackers. Maybe Fritos next time! Great to throw in a crock pot to keep warm when needed.

I boil chicke breasts instead of using the canned. Then I shred them.  I just put everything in the slow cooker on low heat. Amazing!! Everyone loves it.

This was excellent!  I used blue cheese dressing, because that's what I had, and I used a rotisserie chicken rather than canned chicken.  I also layered it, because I think it makes it more interesting when it's served.  Next time I make it, though, I will leave out the cheddar cheese, this does not need it!

Awesome!  Restaurant Owner/Chef friend of mine said this was better than his.  I broiled 3 boneless chicken breasts and chopped them up but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was right moreish.

This dip is great and SO easy to make.  My co-workers are in love with it and ask me to make it all the time.  I do add a more hot sauce than the recipe says to make it a little spicier.

Love this recipe. Easy to make this very low fat. I choose the canned chicken that is white meat and 97% fat free, fat free cream cheese, fat free ranch and I use tabasco sauce instead of Franks because the sodium is much lower. This frees me up to use lots of chips  A+++ recipe!

I made this for our annual Halloween party and everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe, used boneless chicken breasts that I boiled and then used two forks to shred.  I added extra hot sauce and then the rest of the ingredients.  I kept it in a small crock pot to keep warm. Delicious! Fritos or tortilla chips are really good with it!

Delish. My hubs made this same dish from a coworker's recipe. We use a couple boiled chicken breasts instead of canned. We like to play with the hot sauce and ranch levels by taste. Sometimes we use mozzarella cheese. I love to sprinkle on some blue cheese crumbles while it's warm. We just mix it up and bake it! Great with hearty multi grain tortilla chips. Oh I like to use leftovers (if there is any) on a home made buffalo pizza.

Super. Delicious. Could not stop eating.  Yummy!  These were all things I heard from people who ate this dip I served at a recent party.  I used thick crackers and celery as the sides to eat this with and I cannot say enough about how great it was!  Even people who don't normally like buffalo chicken or wings seemed to like this.  This will be a forever staple in my party rotation!

This recipe was terrific. I did change two or three things, such as, I added (1) container of sourcream. I used 4 chicken breast, boiled and shredded. and I cooked in microwave for 6 minutes! It was great! Will be making this one often, Thanks! Also instead on ranch dressing, i just used a package of Ranch dressing mix (for making your own dressing, this really gave this alot of flavor). Thanks again. =-)

So easy, so good.  I did use a leftover shredded chicken breast instead of the canned and upped the pepper sauce to a full cup because we like it spicy.  It all fit into my lil dipper crock pot - easy transport to a party.  Will be making often!

Fantastic dip!  I may have messed something up though.  I doubled the chicken and hot sauce but left the dressing and cream cheese as is.  It was still fantastic and I've gotten numerous requests to make it again.  Served it with frito scoops and lime tortilla chips...YUM!

Big hit!  Used buffalo sauce in place of hot sauce and scaled it back slightly to lighten the heat.  May try a little more chicken next time.  Loved it with celerey sticks.

I followed the recipe verbatim and found it to be a bit too "hot" fo me.  My husband loved it and ate nearly the entire dish himself!  Next time, I'll cut down on the hot sauce and save him some calories!

This is fantastic.  Everyone raved about it - PLUS I used fat free cream cheese and "light" Ranch Dressing. They never knew the difference.  It was devoured.  This is a definite keeper.

I felt this recipe tasted a lot like drinking straight Frank's Hot Sauce.  I had this at a party where it was served and then again when I made it for another party.  It is definitely much better to eat with celery - as the coolness of the celery helps to tone down eating this.  Guests loved it - they complimented it throughout the evening.  I found it a bit heavy but - well, if my guests liked it then why complain?

This sounded so good and easy.  I don't think that I did anything wrong, we just didn't taste what all the hype was about.  I ended up throwing most of it out. :-(

This recipe came highly recommended but I did not like it at all.  Consistency was too thick and it seemed very rich to me.  Would not make this dip again.

This was amazing!!  I made it for the Super Bowl and my husband and dad couldn't get enough of it.  I boiled 2 chicken breasts in chicken broth and garlic, I used bleu cheese instead of ranch, and I baked at at 350 for about 20 min.  I'm making this for work on Monday - we are having a "food day."  I think I will add one more chicken breast, and I will be using the slow cooker so it will stay warm all day.  Thanks for  the great recipe!

Soooo yummy and a fantastic Super Bowl Treat.  I wouldn't change a thing, just to say that it is also good cold.  I didn't have time for the slow cooker, I just heated it up on the stove.

I made this for our Superbowl party, and what a hit! I made as is, expect I mixed everything together, put in a 9x13 baking dish, and baked at 350 for about 20 mins. Will definitely make again for my next party!

Delicious, and always a hit.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts simmered with garlic and onion.  I also added garlic and onion to the cream cheese mixture. I used a mix of ranch dressing and neufchatel cheese, and stirred in some blue cheese crumbles, as well.  Instead of stirring it all together, I layered it in a pie plate.  The cream cheese/ranch/bleu cheese layer was first, then the chicken/buffalo sauce, then cheese on top.  I baked it in the oven at 350 till it was bubbly and slightly brown on top.  Everyone always loves it.

Cream cheese can be reduced significantly without affecting the end result too much (I once cut it in half).  Also, no one can tell the difference when reduced fat cream cheese and ranch are used...and I think it actually turns out better that way.  I love this recipe!
(Other buffalo chicken dip recipes tend to suggest bleu cheese, which I find disgusting and can pick out immediately.  Thanks for not including that nastiness in this recipe!)

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a real hit. I served it up with pretzels but when we ran out, just started putting it on anything we could find. I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce, Blue Cheese instead of Ranch, and substituted Quorn Chick'n for the real thing(my wife is vege). I already have people calling me for the recipe.

Against my better judgment, I made this recipe with the canned chicken as the recipe directs.  The canned chicken makes it so bad.   I'm sure it's good with real chicken, but if rating the recipe as written, it's only two stars for me.

FANTASTIC!!!!!  The hit of my Super Bowl party!   The only change that I made, was to used 4 grilled chicken breasts, instead of canned.  Wonderful recipe that I will definitely use again, and again!

Love this recipe w/ a few changes.  I doubled the recipe used cooked chicken breast shredded and layered the cream cheese mixture on the bottom of a 9x13 with the chicken on top, drizzled a little extra hot sauce on top and then the cheese.  Baked for about 20 mins at 350.  This was the hit of the Super Bowl party.

This is a simple and delicious recipe!!  I actually boiled skinless, boneless chicken breasts because I don't like the canned version and it was fantastic!!  I really like that it's specifically for the crockpot.  I put it on around noon and kept it on all day and kept going back for more and more and more!!  I served it with scoop tortilla chips, the perfect little bowl to scoop it up with!

This is wonderful!  Everyone liked it and I will definitely make it again.  There are many recipes out there for this, but this one is by far the best.  I followed it exactly - just never added the shredded cheese on top (no need for it).

Certainly not the best buffalo dip I have had.   I followed recipe exactly. Did not have enough Buffalo flavor.   Maybe if you make the changes some reviews suggest then it would be worth more stars.  but I believe on rating recipe as is.

Awesome dip!!  Used two boiled chicken breasts and a whole bottle of Frank's hot sauce.  Combined everything in saucepan as directed but then put in 8x8 casserole dish and heated in oven for 20 min at 375.  A keeper!!

This was really good. I cooked and cubed 2 chicken breasts instead of the canned, and used lite bleu cheese dressing instead of the ranch. I heated and whisked this over low heat on the stove. My family really enjoyed this, though I would've preferred it with a little more hot sauce. When I make this again, it will be for a much larger group as I just feel really fat right now...lol.

Our family is addicted to this dip!  I add a few tablespoons of blue cheese dressing to the ranch to equal the cup measure.  Easy and lots of room for creative measuring!

For people who think this isn't "hot" enough, a chef once warned me to use "hot sauce" rather than Tabasco if I didn't want it too fiery.  It's advice that has served me well.  For a little heat, I use hot sauce.  For fire, Tabasco!

"It was great, can't go wrong, everybody loved it" My hubby's words. He looooves buffalo chicken of any kind. I hadn't even had it until we were marriied, but he's made me into a fan. I made this for some friends last week who drove an hour to come visit us. They said the dip alone was worth the drive. This dip is addiciting.

I have made this dip for over 6 years and it has always been a hit!  To cut calories and fat, you cna use reduced/nonfat cream cheese and dressing!  Also, try it with blue cheese for a switch!

Everyone LOVED this dip. I used boiled shredded chicken in place of the canned. I threw everything in the slow cooker on low and didn't really measure anything out. Yummy stuff.

Made this for game night, everyone loved it. Followed recipe exactly. I think next time I will add more hot sauce, because it wasn't spicy enough for me. Still, so good!

This is THE best dip I have ever eaten as well as made!! I had this for the first time at a friends for a New Years Eve party and I just love the spicy/ranch flavor!! Since then, I've had tons of people ask for the recipe and I'm now required to bring it whenever there's a party!  I pretty much use the exact recipe except I use 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts rather than the canned. I boil them first and then shred them and I think it tastes just great! 5 STARS ;)

I made this for NEW YEARS EVE & it was a huge HIT, I mixed it all together. I used cubed chicken breast them chopped it  finer. I used 1/2 Mild & 1/2 Medium Buffalo Wings sauce. I used a combo of shreded Cheddar & Monteray Jack cheese in the package & served with tortilla chips. I baked it in a 8x8 pan 375* for 35 min. It was AWESOME!

This dip is awesome! Everyone raved and begged for the recipe. The only thing I changed was instead of 1 cup of Ranch dressing, I did 1/2 cup Ranch dressing and 1/2 cup Blue Cheese dressing and it was great. It's delicious with tortilla chips as well as celery. You can't go wrong with this dip!

I made this to take to a friends house and it was awesome!  It makes a ton!  I used 2 boneless breasts instead of the canned chicken.  I transferred it to a small pyrex and we baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes.  I do not recommend topping with cheese if you decide to bake it.

CAUTION! Don't make this if your home alone.  You will not be able to stop eating it and before you know it - the bowl will be empty.  Insanely delicious - and that's coming from a girl from Buffalo who knows all about wings.

Absolutely wonderful!  Took it to a New Year's Eve gathering, and it was a hit with all ages.  (I did substitute shredded deli chicken for the canned.)  Will definitely be making this one again.

Great taste, used real chicken and Marie's super blue cheese dressing and layered instead of mixing all together. Did look a little oily, so I am going to play around to see if I can fix that...

I've had other buffalo chicken dips and this turned out much better than them.  I used three chicken tenders, which I grilled for that "char" taste.  I actually served this uncooked as I forgot that step!  It was still good!  The next day I tried it heated up, and that was good too!

This is my old stand by now to take to parties and it's such a hit that folks make sure I'm bringing it.  I usually halve it.  I'll ONLY use Frank's Hot sauce--1/2 c. for half recipe and light cream cheese and light ranch dressing and just offer celery.  Warning: it's addictive! :)

It tastes so awesome can't wait for it to get done!  I used chicken breast and fork-shredded it, just added enough until it looked right and popped it into the oven at 350 for at least 20 minutes.  Delish!  Oh, and I really dont think you even need the shredded cheese...it's great as is!

Wonderful recipe! I used Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce,  24 oz of chicken and about half the cheddar cheese required.  It was wonderful!  I made it for Christmas Eve family gathering, and it was such a hit!  Everyone loved it!  Some thought it was hot, so I was happy I used the Buffalo Wing Sauce.  I used canned chicken - which was fine.  No one could tell.  I was asked to bring it to a New Year's Eve event, so it was obviously loved!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was wondering if anyone ever used chopped up chicken tenders instead of shredded chicken? I am making for New Year's Eve Party. Sound delicioso!

Out of 5 or 6 dips at our party, this was the first to go. We used boiled chicken (finely chopped)  instead of the canned in our batch. Five stars.

Every time I make this dip someone asks me for the recipe. I usually add 1/2 cup blue cheese crumbles for a more authentic flavor. So yummy!!

I had buffalo chicken dip at a party and it was wonderful. I looked on this site for the recipe and tried it for myself. It was wonderful! I now make it for every party I go to, and just serve it with Wavy Lays.

This was the first time I ever made Buffalo chix dip...it was a hit! yes, it comes out a strange orange color, but it is soooo good! The only change i made was to cook the chicken in a little butter, adds to the flavor. Served with Fritos, the family loved it!! Will make again!

This is an crowd-pleasing dip for sure! There is never any left, and you will need to be prepared to give out the recipe! I prefer to use blue cheese over ranch, the results are the an extra "yum" factor!

This is very good and whenever I make it it's eaten quickly.  I boil chicken breasts instead and shred in my blender.  I just think canned chicken is too much like cat food and can't bring myself to use it.  I once made it withour the cheese and it was still very good.

Very good, and very similar to the recipe "Chicken Wing Dip" from this site. I made the other one, but used this method to do so. Other changes were minimal, such as blue cheese dressing for Ranch dressing. Thanks!

I also took the advice of another member and layered the ingredients with cream cheese/ranch on bottom, then a layer with buffalo chicken mixture and went very easy on the shredded cheese. Everyone whose tried  mine has requested the recipe. Yum!!

I used a rotisserie chicken and half blue cheese, half ranch. I also used GOOD cheese and shredded it myself which makes a huge difference in the flavor. Served this for a football gathering and everyone loved it. I used Franks Buffalo Wing sauce which was way too spicy for me, but everyone else thought it was perfect. I admit I am a wimp:) Served it with tortilla chips. I will definitely make it again for all my spicy loving friends! I doubled the recipe and it made a ton.

I love this recipe.  I make it every time I have a party to go to.  You can substitute blue cheese dressing for the ranch as well.  A couple things I change are that I use the 1/3 less fat cream cheese, light ranch dressing, and no cheese.  This recipe is so good that you don't need the extra cheese.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was great, but a little to creamy cheesy for us. Next time I will use half as much cream cheese and add more wing sauce.

This dip tastes great. I added about a 1/3 cup of ketchup to sweeten it up a bit. Really easy to make too.

Great recipe! I made it in a slow cooker and added chopped green onion, chopped celery and extra chicken and served it with nacho chips and sliced baguette bread. Great for a crowd!

Great, easy appetizer recipe. I like to use Texas Pete's hot sauce. Whenever I have made this for guests they have loved it- it is one of those that EVERYone seems to ask me the recipe for.  Definitely a good one for game day!

This dip is awesome! The only change I make is to use a rotisserie chicken instead of can. I always receive compliments! Feeds a big crowd.

Took this to a potluck and it was a huge hit.  Will defintely be making again. After reading reviews I also made a few changes.  Instead of canned chicken I bought a rotisserie chicken.  I used 1 cup of Frank's hot sauce and fat free blue cheese dressing.  Also used reduced fat cream cheese and cheddar cheese.  Sprinkled the top with blue cheese crumbles.

I subbed the blue cheese dressing for the ranch and used wing sauce and layered in a casserole at 350 for 20-25 mins., as some other reviewers suggested and it was AWESOME!!!  Raves from my family.

I first tried this recipe a few weeks ago.  It sounded good, but I had no idea that it would be my new favorite!  I have made this for ourselves twice and for two fall parties this week!  A must try.   I am not a celery fan, so we ate with tortilla chips.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

We love a good dip at our University of Alabama football tailgates, and this one was a big hit! I made it exactly as it is written. I even used low fat cream cheese and light Ranch dressing. I don't think anyone could tell the difference! Thanks!

This was way too "hot" for me.  I couldn't handle it.  Otherwise it'd be great, and I will make it again w/ much less of the hot sauce.  Bummer!

We love this dip!  Our college football team's color is Orange so I am always trying to serve something that color.  Everyone in the south loves Ranch dressing and Texas Pete's Hot Sauce.  Can't make enough on game day!

This is so good!  I gave 5 stars based on making this with real chicken, not canned.  I boiled a pound of chicken in 1/2 inch of water, turning, for about and hour, shredded and used 2 1/2 cups.  We ate with saltines.  This would be good in a bread bowl. Made as directed, but in the oven.  Perfect and addicting!!

This lived up to the ratings it has received.  Used 2 large boiled chicken breasts, ranch dressing and layered (as another reviwer suggested) and baked for 25 min at 350.  Served with Scoops.  Delicious!

I made this as an appetizer at my daughters birthday party for the adults since it was also the day of the MSU/U of M game. Everybody raved about it and it was gone in less than an hour! I made it exactly according to the directions with an exception of the canned chicken (used chicken breasts instead). I will definitely be making this for every get-together in the future!

Thought this was fantastic.  Mostly followed the recipe other than substituting low fat cream cheese, 1/2 cup of low fat ranch and 1/2 cup of low fat bleu cheese.  After warming in skillet, put in casserole dish and baked in oven until cheese was all melted.  We ate it with tortilla chips and celery.  DELICIOUS!

I had read that a few people had separating issues, I only got this when I used the "bargain brand" cheese. I love this recipe. Some use crackers, we use golden tortilla chips. The nice thick ones. I make is stove top..Basically putting everything in a big pot until it is melted. I do let the canned chicken simmer alone long enough to remove some of the water and then I let it cook in the hot sauce before I add the cheese. But I do not do the layer in the oven thing because it takes longer and is tastes no different.

I wasn't thrilled with this dip. I think the theory behind it is good but my dip kept seperating on me.  I would add more sour cream and cheese hoping it would cream it up for me..heat it and it was a seperated mess again..I was disappointed as I hail from upstate Ny and Buffalo chicken wings are a staple there!!

I really wanted to be impressed. I made it exactly to the instructions, with the exception of using blue cheese dressing. While it was eaten by a couple of people, there was still a bunch left over, and I wasn't impressed at all with the flavor and texture. It just seemed gummy and oily, and I used quality cheese too. I won't make this again- back to artichoke dip for me!

Made this last night for the football game.  My family loved it.  I thought the corn chips was too overpowering for the dip.  I did use the chicken crackers.  I think just plain tortilla chips would be fine. Both of my sons put the dip on a sandwich bun with corn chips on top!!  My sister said it was the best recipe I have made!

We made this last night for a party we hosted for my husbands friends from work.  I showed up late because I had to go get the ingreds, but it whipped together really quick and everyone was asking for the recipe!  I liked it better with celery, it made the buffalo flavor pop a little more.  I'm keeping this recipe for the next party!

Each time I make this and take to a party or family get-together everyone loves it. I put all the cheese in the dip instead of putting some of it on top. I usually serve in a crock pot on low instead of out of the oven.

I made this for poker night and it was a hit. I did not use can chicken. I boiled a few chicken tenders and then shredded it by hand. I used low fat ranch and I don't think it made a difference. I then put the mixture in my crock pot and it was perfect and kept warm all night.

This is a great dip!  I mix all ingredients into a deep pie dish, bake it in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes, stir to combine everything to a nice smooth consistency, then add a little bit of cheddar cheese on top, put it back in the oven until the topping is melted and bubbly.  Super easy and Everyone always LOVES IT!

We've made this at 2 parties this summer and given out the recipe and had it at 2 other parties since then.  It's a big hit and everyone loves it.  I don't use canned chicken, just boil chicken breasts and shred them.

I make this with my leftover whole chicken (that I get for 99cents a pound, I just shred the chicken) I use Triscuits per family request and celery. I also have lactose intolerant family members and use tofutti cream cheese and margarine for the butter. I layer my dip. It's always a hit!

I love making this dip. My husband can't stand the smell or taste, but he is the only one that doesn't devour it. We eat it with tortilla chips. I also use fresh cooked chicken strips (diced) instead of canned. It always brings rave reviews at get togethers.

Warning...this dip is ADDICTING!  I love it and can't stop eating it.  I did use just a little less hot sauce than in the recipe, which I recommend.  You can always add more.

Amazing!  My favorite dip hands down.  We did use fresh chicken instead of canned, but with the chicken being more of a filler then a key flavor either will be great!

I made this dip for the first time last weekend and it is amazing!  We had friends over and they finished the entire bowl in no time.  I used low fat cream cheese and low fat ranch dressing...neither affected the taste or consistency in any way.  I served it with celery and Triscuits, both of which paired with the dip quite nicely.  Highly recommended!

I used left over cooked chicken and blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and it was amazing! I also brought it to a party and it was gone in 15 minutes. Everybody asked for the recipe- this dip is a crowd pleaser.

This always gets rave reviews from all the guests.  I shred chicken breasts instead of canned chicken meat.  IMO, it takes a bit more time but the taste is much better!

I made this using a half franks red hot/half franks red hot buffalo wings (medium) sauce.  Pretty tasty, more buffalo-ey.  I will add a bit more chicken next time and may prepare it instead of the canned.  Overall pretty good

This is a winner. It is requested by kids and adults at every party that I have. 

Don't leave it warming in crock pot. The oil will make you not want to eat it.

I also, baked it after heating it stovetop as the recipe suggests. I used a large baking dish and took it to a 4th of July neighborhood party and everyone loved it. I'm making it for my brother-in-law's 50th birthday party tomorrow. If you like blue cheese, you can use blue cheese dressing instead of ranch or you can use 1/2 of each. It is delicious!

I make this dip using fresh chicken that I dice and fry with butter or olive oil Pam, garlic pepper and broiled steak seasoning by McCormick (fabulous on chicken). I use a full cup of Franks wing sauce and I use mozz. cheese. I serve this with tortilla chips and everyone raves about this dip where ever i bring it. It's always the first to go! I make it often at my house because everyone loves it and it's easy to make.

Delicious. I've also made it with celery in the mix and using a bottle of blue cheese dressing instead of ranch which i prefer. Every time I make it, I get raves.

I love this recipe but I modified it to BBQ Chicken Dip because some members of my family do not like "hot" food. Prepare exactly the same except use BBQ sauce instead of the hot sauce!

Instead of using canned chicken, I boiled chicken breast halves for a couple minutes and then shredded them. The finished result does not look very appealing, but tastes delicious! Served it with tortilla chips, my boyfriend and I loved it. We make it all the time now!

Absolutely delicous - a hit everytime it's served!  I can't count how many times I've given this recipe to guests.  I toss everything into a bowl and then scoop it into a mini crockpot to heat up - you can't get more simple than that! If you love hot wings - you'll love this1  Both ranch and blue cheese work fine in this recipe!

Went over great with the family.  I heated and layered the cream cheese mixture in the 9x13 pan.  I mixed the chicken and sauce in a to go container.  Then heated it when I arrived at the party and layered it on top. I will add blue cheese sprinkles on top next time so it is easier to tell what it is!  Served with celery bites.

My daughter loved this.  I had one problem, but it wasn't the recipe's fault.  I don't know if the sodium content of my hot sauce was high or if it's because I am living in China and have gotten away from eating bottled stuff, but I could not eat it with a chip because it was so salty.  I used bread that I had made the night before and celery and it certainly helped.  But the ingredients were a perfect combination. The only change made was to use chicken breast.

I made this for a playgroup today and everyone really liked it!    I used 2 cans of 13oz chicken, drained, and broken it up with a fork.  I also used 1 cup of Buffalo wing sauce.  I think this makes it not as spicy as the Red Hot.  I put it in a crockpot on low, and within an hour it was bubbly and ready to be served.  After that I turned the crockpot down to the warm setting.   We served with tostitoes chips.  I also tried it with Pita Chips, and those tasted good as well!  This wasn't really spicy at, which I can't handle.  Just the right amount of spice, without having to grab a drink of water after every bite.    I highly highly recommend this recipe.  Serves alot of people as well!

I make this once a month and then refridgerate the left-overs and eat them throughout the month. This dip is VERY good. I eat it with the Toppers crackers you can get at most grocery stores and it is amazing.

I loved this! Changes to taste, more hot sauce and I used shredded chicken breast as I cannot knowningly consume canned chicken, personal preference. Never the less this was delicious with the crackers, celery and even tortilla chips.

Wonderful dip!!! we loved it the first time but it wasn't spicy enough and we thought it was too ranchy so we cut back the ranch a bit and doubled the hot sauce. It was super good and it's now a staple when we have guests.

Yummy dip!  I used half of a leftover rotisserie chicken.  I also baked it at 350 for 20 min instead of heating in a skillet.  Served with tortilla chips and corn chips.

This was awesome! I used blue cheese dressing and franks red hot buffalo sauce. I used shredded cheese and there was a layer of grease. The next time I make this, I will try grating my own cheese to see if that helps. Either way it tasted great - I brought it to a party and it was a big hit!

This was a good recipe! Needed a little more chicken, but overall not bad. Next time will probably follow other reviewers suggestions to layer ingredients, as well as try blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.

WE only changed this by putting in a bit less hot sauce, as we were bringing it to a mixed group and did not want it too spice. (We used about 5/8 cup) IT was the hit of the appetizers... everyone wants the recipe. Next time I will try low fat cheeses and dressing. I can't imagine it will make too much of a difference in taste.

I made this for my family one night, and it was a HIT! So good. I halved this recipe to fit into my mini crock pot, and I warmed it until melty and creamy. I used real cooked, shredded chicken breast (just broiled in chicken stock) instead of canned chicken, and used Franks hot sauce, I also added more cheese, and used Bleu Cheese dressing instead of ranch. AWESOME!

This recipe is great! I used 1.5 lbs of cooked chicken tenders instead of the canned meat. Canned meat just creeps me out! I also used monterey jack cheese along with the cheddar, and tobasco to taste. I don't like things spicy so i just mixed in a tablespoon at a time until i reached the heat level i like. I made it ahead of time for a party, baked it for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees, and then broiled it for the last 2-3 minutes to get a browned crust.

I made this over the weekend and it was a hit!  I bought pre-cooked chicken breast from the meat secion and cut it into small pieces.  I also used freshly shredded cheddar based on other users' recommendations.  I served this with Wheat Thins and it was a hit!

My husband loved this dip!  However, it was not a hit at the party.  I'm not sure if just picky eaters or what.  I thought the dip was pretty good...

This was good but not great. First couple of bites were good but anything more than that was too much.  If i try this again I'd reduce the cream cheese a bit and use blue cheese dressing with blue cheese chunks.  Definitly wont use canned chicken again.  Im not sure why there would be cheddar in Buffalo chicken.  It didnt do anything for the dip. TY for the post.

Awesome dip!  I did make a few changes, I used baked chicken breasts, 1/2c ranch dressing and 1/2c blue cheese dressing(instead of all Ranch), and I omitted the cheddar cheese.  It was perfect.  The cheese makes it too greasy and who needs the extra fat.  Thanks for the recipe.

It could have been the sauce brand I used, but this was WAY too salty and vinegary for me to like it. Also, it was just kinda like a fat fest of cheap stuff.   Could modify it to be non-canned chicken and about 1/2 less sauce and maybe it would be better?

This recipe is FAB! Though I think it would be less salty if you were to boil some chicken breasts &chop them up to use instead of canned chicken. But that's my personal preference. I will try that some day!

I liked this best with blue cheese dressing and layering with breaded chicken strips (torn in pieces) and covered in buffalo sauce.  Didn't like the chicken crackers....better with veggies or even toasted bread rounds.

This is awesome!! Add more hot sauce though for sure.    I had some leftover from a party, and tried a couple spoonfuls an omelet the next morning.  It was one of the best omelets I've ever had!

Great dip.  I used ranch as the recipe calls.  However, I followed another reviewer's recommendation and I layered the ingredients in a pan (didn't use crock pot) to avoid the strange orange color.  I placed the ranch and cream cheese on bottom, then chicken mixed with the hot sauce and topped it all off with the cheddar cheese.  I baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  It was a huge hit at a Super Bowl party.

This recipe was perfect for Superbowl Sunday!  Substitue Blue Cheese for the Ranch and bake for 20 mins at 350 (instead of the slow cooker).  Serve with tortilla chips.

This recipe doesn't need another review, but here's one anyway.  Very, very tasty!  I used roasted chicken instead of canned, but didn't substitute anything else (although I did cut the recipe in half, since there are only two of us and as is we'll be eating it all week).  I did cheat a little on prep:  I microwaved the chicken and hot sauce for a minute, added the dressing and cream cheese, microwaved for another minute, mixed in all of the cheddar and then baked at 350 for 10-15 minutes.  My oven runs hot, so on an oven that actually cooks at the correct temp, it might take as long as 20 minutes to achieve hot bubblyness.  I'm curious to try it as written, because I thought when the dip came out of the oven it was a bit runny, but it firmed up as it cooled a bit.

Great dip! This went over well at my Superbowl party. I only used one 8-oz. package of cream cheese, used bleu cheese instead of ranch, measured the hot sauce only to taste, and baked it rather than slow-cooked it. It's fattening as all get-out, so it's really rich, but I think it was a 9 out of 10. It should definitely be served hot, I'd say. The recipe made a ton, so I had a lot left over from my gathering of about 10 people. I will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I only gave this recipe 4 stars b/c I made SLIGHT variations--this is wildly popular with guests!  I only use 1 pack of the cream cheese, I mix white italian cheese (mozzarella or whatever i have on hand) as well as Cheddar/Jack Mix.  In addition to this I add about 1 tbs. butter (maybe less)--I found that this prevents the coagulated cheese effect--I put ALL ingredients in the crock pot (start with softened cream cheese to get it melting), and add the cheese slowly.  Superbowl party hit!

This was good, but you definitely don't want to eat too much of it.  REALLY RICH, and because of the amount of hot sauce used...LOADED with sodium.  Good for an appetizer at a party

I recently threw a party and had about 5 different appetizers.  This was the only one that I had to make more of!  People were raving about it and asking me for the recipe!

This dip is very good - I served it with chicken flavored crackers and celery.  We prefered it with the celery.  I used fresh - not canned - chicken.  I also used 1/2 Ranch and 1/2 Bleu Cheese dressings.  Very good, will make again and again.  My husband would have licked the dish clean if I let him!

Made this for New Year's and everyone RAVED about it! I used half bleu cheese dressing & half ranch and cut the hot sauce down to 1/2 c and it was still spicy enough for our crowd. We took thin sliced beef lunch meat and put a spoonful of the warm dip in the center of each slice and rolled it up--yum! Served the rest with crackers. Will make this again and again!

Made it for new years in layers as another reviewer suggested and also bought a store bought rotissierie chicken and pulled it. It was a huge hit. Tastes just like chicken wings. Very addictive!

My sister says that there's something wrong with this dip... because nothing should taste THIS GOOD.  This dip is a hit everytime I make it.  I make it exactly as it was originally posted.  When I feel like cutting fat a bit, I'll use 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and 2% shredded cheese and it's still just as delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Great!!!  I boiled chicken breasts and shredded it instead of canned chicken. We don't like things too spicy so we used 1/2 cup hot sauce. I also didn't put it in the slow cooker, just in a casserole dish in the oven until the cheese on top was melted and slightly browned. Very good recipes, will definitely make again.

We all loved the taste of this dip.  However, the two times I've made it I left it in the crock pot to keep warm. When doing this, the Frank's Red Hot Sauce seperates from the cream cheese mixture and looks oily (I'm sure it's the moisture from the crockpot lid and the fact that it never completely congeals with the cream cheese mix.   I had this dip at a party and took it off of the heat and served from a bowl.  I just think it's better when warm.

This dip is always a hit.  I changed the recipe a bit using 3 chicken breasts sauted w/ salt, pepper, and basil in olive oil then roughly chopped.  I also cut the cream cheese to 1 1/2 blocks and used blue cheese dressing.

This was a hit even though I didn't have wing sauce on hand.  I cut up leftover chicken and made the dip with Tabasco instead of the wing sauce.  Since then, I have bought buffalo wing sauce and will make it for my next gathering.  YUMMY and different than the norm.

Your recipe on this dip is a home run! I followed with the slow cooker instructions and also put in an alum. loaf pan & took it to a hunting camp, heated in oven, then just toss the pan. There have never been left overs when I made this! Thank you. This is my NEW FAVORITE RECIPE!

This dip was very good. Made it at home and for a potluck. One word of advice - use only cheddar cheese. 1st time I made it I used cheddar and it was yummy and gooey. The next time I made it it was very oily. I used a blend of Colby Jack. I couldn't figure out what went wrong. It had to be the type of cheese.

I love this dip and this made it so easy to make for friends and family as a tailgating recipe. Instead of canned chicken I use rotissarie. The texture seems better when you do. Also, instead of hot sauce like Franks's I use a spicy garlic sauce. It seems to add a little more flavor with the kick!!

So good!!  Made it as stated, everyone liked it.  Then we made it without the cheddar cheese, and just sprinkled blue cheese on top, and it was all gone w/in an hour...  My new favorite appetizer recipe - making it for our party tonight!

This was a huge hit with my family!  Even my grandpa who generally dislikes anything even remotely spicy loved it!  I did use chicken breasts that I cooked myself as I don't like canned chicken.  I substituted blue cheese dressing for the ranch as well.

This is wonderful! You can make it as spicy as you like by adjusting the Franks Hot Sauce.  I brought it to a work potluck and the guys were just raving about it!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! Every time I make it people are scrapping the bowl clean.  The only change I made is that I use 1/2 cup of Buffalo Sauce.  I have used 3/4 cup, but not everyone liked it that hot. With the 1/2 cup it suited everyone's taste.  I also put mine in a mini crock pot to serve so it stays hot.  I highly suggest this for a Superbowl party!

I made this Christmas Eve and it was a hit.  My family loved it.  I plan on making it again for a New Year's Eve party, especially after the reaction I got Christmas Eve.

Delicious, and you can adjust the heat to your liking. Try fresh cooked chicken instead of canned, as the dip turned out a little too salty. Also, better served with chips than with the chicken flavored crackers.

Made this for a Christmas party last Saturday. Very good recipe.  I used 3 small chicken breasts that I poached in water then shredded.  I used blue cheese dressing rather than ranch.  After tasting my husband said it was really tangy with the blue cheese so I added a bit of ranch dressing to tone it down.  It was apparently a hit because I didn't have any to bring home.

I was so looking forward to this recipe because we love buffalo wings, but this recipe was just disappointing and not what I expected at all. We didn't like anything about it.  It tasted strange and the look and texture was not appealing.

I love this, we've been making it for years, I use the packet of hot sauce that comes with tgi fridays boneless wings, and I use either rotisserie chicken or boneless skinless chicken breasts since we don't like canned chicken.

The only other change we make is we usually eat it with fritos and carrots, not chicken flavored crackers and celery.

Wow...this was really yummy!!!!  Much easier than preparing traditional buffalo chicken wings too.  Canned chicken meat always sounded gross to me, so I bought a ready made rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and shredded the meat - great time saver.  I didn't bother with heating the chicken in the pan...really not necessary.  Just mixed everything up in a bowl, poured in a baking dish, topped with remaining cheddar cheese and baked at 350 until heated through and bubbly (about 25-30 minutes).  Great served with slices of french bread and Ritz crackers.  I'll definitely keep this one in mind for the Super Bowl, but I'm sure I'll make it many times before then :)

This is delicious!  Due to some other reviews, I decided to also leave out the cheddar cheese, and now after tasting it, I can't imagine it in there.  Doesn't seem like it would go.  I used 3/4 cup blue cheese and 1/4 cup ranch.  We ate it with fritos and celery.  YUM!

This dip was gone before everyone had the chance to try it! I did do as others suggested and used chicken breast that I shredded instead of canned chicken(yuck), and that made it taste much better. Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this recipe tonight for a football game and it was delicious. I used Texas Pete's buffalo sauce and served it with Fritos scoops. Everyone loved it. Question -- do you think it would be good to add onions and/or tomatoes to make it a little chunkier?

This was a quick and simple recipe that everyone loved!  The only reason that I rated it at a 4 star is because it was a little to spicy when you add 3/4 cup of hot sauce.  Next time I will be cutting back to 1/3 cup and I am sure it will be much better!  I think we all went through at least 1 bottle of water while snacking on this dip because of the heat!

This is an easy, tasty recipe.  I did lighten it up with Wishbone Lite Blew Cheese dressing and Fat free cream cheese--and left out the cheddar cheese entirely.  Fantastic and not completely unhealthy!  I've used roasted turkey leftovers, chicken breasts and rotisserie chicken (all chumked or shredded).  This workd well in the crockpot for cooking and serving.

EXCELENT DIP!!! I made it to have while watching the race. Everyone loved it. I used 1LB of fresh chicken breast instead of canned. I slow cooked my chicken over low heat covered till I was able to shred it. Then I finished the recipe as written. Very easy will make it again. I was asked if it could be made with beef. I will let everyone know how it turnes out.

I made this buffalo chicken dip for a holiday party that I just had, and when it filled an entire slow cooker, I was a bit nervous that I would have tons of leftovers, since we were serving a number of other dishes as well. This was not the case. Everyone complimented me on this recipe. My friend, who hates anything spicy, couldn't stop eating it. Needless to say, it was gone halfway into the evening, and I've had several requests for this recipe.
Best part of this recipe is that it's extremely easy to estimate and just 'throw in' the ingredients. I may have gone a little heavy on some ingredients, but it turned out great! I'll definitely be making this again.

I cut down on the cheddar cheese, and like someone suggested, didn't layer it too thick on top.  Texture was great, got pretty good reviews at a potluck.  It was just a bit "off" for me, I will try it with the blue cheese next time for perhaps better results.  So simple, and a good base, just needs to be tweaked.

I make this recipe pretty much exactly as it is written, with two excpetions; I double the shredded cheddar and use half a cup of ranch AND half a cup of bleu cheese. Nummy! I serve mine up with Tostito's scoops and celery.

Have been making this for a year and everyone RAVES about it.  I use a store bought rotiserrie chicken to shred, cup of hidden valley ranch, a cup (not 3/4) of franks red hot, and same amount of philly.  I dont add the cheese.  I make it in huge batches and it dissappears!

This is good, however, it's better when fresh chicken breasts are used.  Just boil them for 20 minutes and then shred or stick in the food processor for a few quick seconds.  I also use Blue Cheese dressing instead of ranch, since Blue Cheese goes so well with buffalo sauce.  We serve this with flour tortilla chips - delish!

I halved this recipe because I didn't have enough chicken.  I loved it with celery, but my 8 and 6 yr old devoured it with crackers.  Hubby was a little disappointed that he didn't get very much after that.

This was great!  Next time I'm going to try substituting the ranch with bleu cheese, and maybe some blue cheese crumbles on top.

I have been making this for awhile and it is ALWAYS the first dip to go. I never warm anything up first, I just mix it really well in the pan I am baking it in and go.  I have even used the crockpot for this and it worked well, also on low for 3 hours.

I do like this dip, but boy does it give me a stomachache. I think it's all the fat. I do use reduced fat of any items I can. It is yummy!

I made this for a BBQ at my house and the guests are still raving about it. My daughter, who doesn't like spicy food couldn't stop eating it.

Now it is football season and I am getting game day requests for it! The guys love it.  

Used my mini crock pot and it doesn't have a temp adjustment, so after a while it burnt a little, so will need to remember to keep it stirred.  

For those that didn't like celery, i used "scoops" chips and this worked quite well.

Looks a little greasy, but tastes great

Great recipe.  The only thing I changed was adding diced rotisserie chicken instead of canned.  It was great! I would NOT add more hot sauce.  Also, I just threw everything in the crock pot together.  That was much easier, and I don't think it changed anything.

This is really addictive.  We drizzled a little more buffalo sauce on top and then sprinkled cheddar over it.  It's great in tortillas too.

I was disappointed with this recipe after all the good reviews.  I made this for a family gathering and ended up with much of it to take home.  I followed the recipe to a T. The cheese left the top standing in grease.  The ranch/wing sauce flavor was just ok.  I have found an alternate recipe that I like alot the recipe uses much of the same ing. it just omits the ranch and cheddar and uses sour cream, blue cheese dressing and provolone cheese mixed in. I prefer it as a cold dip but the recipe calls for baking either way is very tasty.

Love it!  I used boiled chicken, 1 c. hot wings sauce, blue cheese dressing instead of ranch, 1 1/2 pkgs softened cream cheese, and omitted the cheddar. I haven't even heated it up yet--I'm eating it cold and its fabulous! Can't wait to try it heated through.

I just made this for a football party & it is keeping warm in the slow cooker.  I had to taste it before I serve it, though -- and it is EXCELLENT!!  Perfect w/ the chicken-in-a-biscuit crackers.  This one will be a regular for get-togethers! Super easy, super cheap, and very tasty!!!

Wow!!! A strange combination of ingredients, but it works! It's taken me a while to try this recipe because I had never heard of canned chicken chunks and assumed we didn't have anything like that in Canada, but I made a point of looking the last time I went grocery shopping......and there it was! My family loved it and I can't wait to make it for friends. The only thing I would do differently is add more hot sauce, just because we love heat. I also added more cheddar on top for the crust. You must try it.

Hooray for this recipe!!  I don't think I've ever got more compliments on anything else....I never use canned chicken, only the real thing, and I bake it instead of using the stovetop, but I'm sure it's still delicious as is...not that this recipe needs another glowing review, but this is by far my favorite!  People are always asking how to make this one...be prepared!

A HUGE HIT!!!  My street had a BBQ this weekend and this dish didn't last long.  I had several people request the recipe. I used 1/2 blue cheese 1/2 ranch dressing like suggested.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.

Ok. We all know it's easy to feed our friends and co-workers fattening foods...I mean they will eat any free food right?  Well, I work with very picky people and took this to an employee retreat in the Wisconsin Dells.  I took other reviewers suggestions and avoided canned chicken.  I poached three FROZEN chicken breasts in water seasoned with salt, pepper, bay leaf and onion for about 20 minutes.  VERY convenient.  I used low-fat cream cheese, and a combination of fat-free ranch and fat-free blue cheese dressing.  This cuts the fat considerably, since I did use REAL Wisconsin cheddar cheese.  Needless to say everyone gobbled up this dip, even those "on a diet this summer".  I just reminded them how much fat I cut out!  Also, the first time I tried this recipe, I used Uncle Dougies Chicago-Style hot wing marinade.  It was as good as using Franks Hot Sauce, though I admit Franks is REALLY good.  I recommend trying this recipe.  Definitely bake it onsit if possible.  It just tastes great.  Thanks again for a fabulous appetizer.

This recipe is awesome!  I even made it with fat free cream cheese and fat free dressing and it is still outstanding!  I will definitely try it with blue cheese as well (because I love blue cheese).  This is a keeper.

I give this a 5 for taste and a 3 for appearance - average of a 4.  This was really good but had a layer of grease on the top.  I have seen others with this same consistency.  Next time I may use less ranch & hot sauce or try leaving out the cheese as one reviewer suggested.

I love this dip, but I am with NYPD K9 COP in that I don't care for canned meats, so I use shredded cooked chicken breast for this.  Sometimes I substitute the hot sauce for salsa and serve with tortilla chips for a little Tex-Mex taste.  I also use reduced fat cream cheese and light ranch dressing--although this may cause the dip to separate just a bit more.  I do the reduced-fat version for us at home but make the regular version for parties and other get-togethers.  You won't be sorry if you make this for your next party!  It will be gone!!!!  One more variation for a celery-hating husband--I use a small chopped onion instead.

Brought this to a Super Bowl Party and it was very popular.  However, I found that the crock pot was not necessary and preferred to add a little more hot sauce.  An extra can of chicken could be beneficial in making a thicker dip.  Very good!

I made this dip for a party and substituted the canned chicken for 2-3 chicken breasts that I boiled in a stockpot with some chicken seasoning and chicken broth.  It was a HUGE hit at the party!

A huge hit.  We made for company and it was polished off quickly.  They asked for the recipe before they left and I directed them to this site.  I used boneless skinless chicken and I layered it instead of combining ( as other users suggested).  I did not even use the cheese on top.

This was the first time my husband and I had this dip and it was a wonderful recipe! There was only a few things I did different. I put in 1 cup of hot sauce (Budweiser buffalo wing) instead of 3/4 cup. I also used extra chucky bleu cheese dressing, even though it smelled odd, the taste was wonderful. I was skeptical, but I used canned organic white chicken. It was perfect due to my time crunch and couldn't taste the difference!

Everyone really loved this dip.  I will definitely make it again, except try substituting real chicken breast for the canned to try and cut down on sodium.  I thought it was a little too salty.

This dip is a hit at every cookout or get together.  It is so popular among frinds and family, that we alternate who makes it.  I add habanera sauce for added spice!

I make a very similar dip, the differences are: real chicken, boil a whole chicken then shredded, blue cheese dressing from the jar in the produce section, Texas Pete Hot Sauce (2) bottles! It is so delicious everyone asks for the recipe.

I made this once so far, and was asked to make it for our next get-together.  I used some of the reviews recommendations also.  Boiled fresh chicken brest and layer the dish.  This dish was such a hit.  Even among my dieting freinds :)

We made this dip for our Memorial Day Picnic and it was the rave among all other dips that day!I did as the others suggested and layered the ingredients and accidently made the ranch dip with 2 cups of sour cream. When i realized what I had done, I combined the 2 bricks of cream cheese and ranch dip in my big mixer and mixed it up. It was fine. We cooked the chicken in a little butter as suggested. With the extra dip we served it too with chips and it was a hit too! I gave this recipe out a dozen time that day. Best new dip this year!

I made this dip last night for a cookout.  I received the most compliments of any dish I have ever made.  It was really a hit!  I used a mixture of bleu cheese dressing & ranch.  I also followed the suggestion to layer the cream cheese mixture, then the chicken & buffalo sauce and topped with cheddar cheese. Everyone loved it. I had men at the party asking for the recipe!

Very good but with this amount of hot pepper sauce, it may be a bit overpowering.  I agree with the recommendation to layer instead of mixing.

This was good. Not as good as I thought it would be with all the hype :) I topped it with parsley and a few shakes of tabasco for more kick. I did scale it down to 10 servings and maybe some flavor got lost in translation!

I used fresh chicken breast tenders about a pound and a half. Also, dipped torilla chips in it instead of the chicken crackers.  Great addition to any buffet.

So unhealthy, but oh so good!  Used lots of fresh cooked chicken, 1 cup of Frank's Red Hot, only 1.5 blocks of cream cheese, and mozzarella instead of cheddar.  Served with celery sticks and tortilla chips. Awesome recipe- will be sure to make for parties.

Very good taste - just like hot wings.  Gave it a 4 just because it has a wierd texture and because of the greasy factor with the cheese.  I agree that it doesn't need the cheese.  If I make again, I'll delete that part.

My whole family loves this dip!  It was hit at the Super Bowl party!  I used Bleu Cheese dressing instead of Ranch but that's because we like Bleu Cheese with our wings.  A little extra Red Hot doesn't hurt too for more heat!  Guaranteed winner!!

This is such a wonderful dip!  It is unusual looking but tastes so great.  My sister-in-law made it for us for Christmas Eve and I have fixed it several times for different parties since then.  It is always a huge hit.  I use the Tyson pre-cooked chicken fajita strips (diced up) instead of the canned chicken and also the buffalo style hot sauce.  Everyone enjoys it with fresh celery and tortilla chips.  Definitely a must have in your recipe box!

This is always a hit...I often get asked for the recipe. I do not add the cheddar cheese, and make it in the oven (at 375 degrees)instead of the slow cooker.

Very tasty - enjoyed by all! Don't overlook the deli in your grocery store.  I asked for four slices 1" thick of Buffalo chicken.  It was great.  I always get ham, sandwich pepperoni or whatever meat is needed for a recipe from the deli.  Vary the thickness based upon the recipe or how you're going to chop it.

This was very good. I did use a roasted chicken from the deli instead of canned. I also wish I had put more chicken in. My husband said it was better the next day and my little boy wanted to eat it spread on bread.

I did layer this instead of combining the ingridents, it made it look much more appealing.  Also I only used 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese on top which made it healthier and cut down on the greese.

The bowl was EMPTY before half-time! I used ranch(since a friend told me the blue cheese overpowered the dip). I also used 1 stick of cream cheese and 2 poached chicken breasts, and I mixed 1 cup of chedder in before baking in a casserole dish.  Next time I'll add more buffalo sauce because it was surprisingly mild and I may dice up some celery as some reviewers suggested.  Overall - great and I will make again!

A popular choice at our Superbowl party! Everyone preferred eating this with celery, but next time, I would like to try Frito's scoops. I used all Blue Cheese Dressing. Also, used a pound of chicken breasts, poached & finely chopped and did not use the cheese in the dip. I sprinkled about a half a cup on top & added some chopped green onions for looks. Would like to try to make this in a lower-fat version because I could feel my thighs expanding while I ate it!

I made a few changes - I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch and topped with blue cheese crumbles.  I also used baked and shredded chicken.  I thought it was a little too creamy with not enough meat, but everyone loved it. Served in 9x13 dish, layered with cr cheese/dressing, then chicken, then crumbles.  Next time I'll use only 1.5 blocks cream cheese and less blue cheese on top.  Overall, great base recipe.

This was awesome!  I made it for the superbowl and it was an absolute hit!  The only thing I did differently was to poach a  boneless skinless chicken breast instead of using the canned chicken.

Good recipe, but made the following changes as suggested by others: use 3 large chicken breasts (baked then shredded), Franks Wing Sauce, half Ranch/half Blue Cheese dressing and only 1 cup of shredded cheese. Nobody could stop eating it (and I don't even really like wings!).

Pretty spicy and good, I used blue cheese dressing and I don't think it would have been as good if I had used ranch.  Also, I used about half a 12-oz Tabasco bottle and a little extra cream cheese (I buy it in a 1 kg bulk pack so never sure if I am cutting 8 oz off the brick or not). It was pretty hot!
Wish I'd had salty tortilla chips to go with but used french bread instead.  Yummy!

Buffalo Chicken Dip is a great tasting dip if made properly.  This particular recipe calls for waaaaay too much ranch dressing.  If you use the full cup it calls for it just overwhelms everything and that includes the buffalo sauce flavor(which is hard to do).  I would say about 1/4 cup of ranch dressing would be about right (blue cheese even better).  I  also had to use more hot sauce than the recipe called for.  If possible, use shredded or chopped up chicken breasts instead of the canned stuff.  Once in the dip I couldn't hardly see it or taste it.

Yummy, yummy, YUMMY.  My new football half-time favorite.  Very easy recipe with just a few ingredients but with an awesome outcome! I had 13oz. cans of chicken meat so I added three 8-oz blocks of cream chees and 1 cup of hot sauce.  Also, like other reviewers, I mixed the ranch with half bleu cheese dressing.  A great way to enjoy the taste of buffalo wings without all the mess.

This recipe was perfect, not too spicy, just the right kick!!  I will be serving mine tomorrow with celery and tostitos, the only thing I can see: is that I put it in my small crock and it looks tiny...maybe for a big crowd I would double the recipe.   Other than that, thanks for a great recipe!!

QUICK, CHEAP, EASY, & DELICIOUS!  Followed recipe almost exactly leaving out only about 1/2 cup of the cheddar cheese.  This is outstanding dip for a party.  Huge crowd pleaser!  Tastes great with celery sticks.

This recipe is fantastic.  It's easy to make and it's easy to double!  The only modification I made was I boiled chicken breast and shredded them.  

I have had numerous requests for the recipe every time I make it AND I even get requests from friends who heard about it and haven't even tried it yet.

This is phenomenal...I get requests for it all the time now! Sometimes I make it with blue cheese dressing, other times with ranch, it is great both ways! Leftovers taste great over french fries or baked potatoes!

Great dip! I have made this dip 100 times and it never gets old. I have been buying a rotisserie chicken from walmart, instead of canned chicken or chicken breast. It works great.

This dip is amazing. A friend made this at her house and I begged for the recipe and I was surprised at how simple it is. I mix it all up and serve it from a crockpot at almost all of my parties. We also love to eat it with triscuits.

Loved the taste of this.  Just like eating chicken wings.  When I make this again, I will try the layering method and omit the cheddar (gave the dip some oily spots).

I found the cream cheese and pepper sauce too dominating in this recipe. The other flavors were lost. I didn't think it tasted anything like chicken wings. My only advice, if you are planning on preparing this, is to eat it with celery. It's a nice change from crackers. I won't be making this again. Sorry.

This was great! We will make again & again! I also substituted Blue cheese for the ranch. Next time I think I will use fresh shredded chicken instead of the can kind but surprisingly it was not bad. Great recipe!

I served this appetizer for family at Christmas.  I was told it was a keeper and to make it again.  Many people originally thought it was crab dip and didn't have any idea it was chicken.  Just the right amount of heat.

This was AWESOME!  I forgot to rate right after I made it in Oct, but it went over very well at our annual bonfire with friends & everyone wanted the recipe!  You really do need to serve this with the chicken in a biscuit cracker though...it does make a difference.  Only used 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese though.

I was disappointed when I first tasted this dish, although it grew on me the more I ate it.  It has nice potential, but seems like it still needs something.

I made this recipe exactly like the original.  I was expecting to eat this and say "Wow"!  I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  My husband did like it, but he hasn't asked for it again and normally he would if he just loved it.  The other people at the party also liked it, but no one asked for the recipe or raved about it.  I think maybe I will try this again, but the layered version and with bleu cheese instead of ranch.  One thing for sure is that we all enjoyed it best with tortilla chips or ritz crackers rather than the chicken in a biscuit crackers, those were way too salty!

I just made this recipe last night.  Everyone loved it!!  I made a few changes as suggested by some reviewers.  
I used Boneless skinless chicken which I grilled. Light Cream Cheese & Ranch.  
I layered it in an 8x8 pan.  Cream Cheese/Ranch Mixture.  Chicken and Frank's Redhot. Then 1.5 cups of colby jack cheese on top.  Baked 350 for 20 minutes.  Absolutely perfect.  I dabbed the top with papertowels to help reduce the grease.  Worked Great! I served it with tostidos and celery.  Celery was a defenite hit! Surprisingly! Not too spicey for anyone.  Cannot wait to make it again!

We're conflicted. I love bleu cheese, my husband HATES it. My husband loves spicy, not too spicy for me. I made this last night, but cut the recipe in 1/2. I used canned chicken, bleu cheese dressing (not too chunky) and no extra cheddar cheese (he's not a big hot cheese eater). I poured in the Franks hot sauce little by little to make it not too spicy for me, but still with a kick and ended up using about 1/4 cup (for 1/2 recipe). We ate it hot on Chicken and Biscuit crackers and both thought it was OK. We just ate it cold and I liked it soooooo much better. My husband thought it was better, but still OK and that's when I confessed there was bleu cheese in it. I'll try it again with cooked chicken, but will definitely keep it as a cold recipe.

I found this recipe today and went right out to get the ingredients to make it. I used fresh boneless/skinless chicken breasts, Franks Wing Sauce, cheddar cheese, and Marie's Blue Cheese dressing. I am taking it to a party tonight, and after tasting this...I fully expect it to be a BIG hit. This is very yummy!! I even used the occasion to buy a new small 4 qt. crock pot that came with a travel bag! ;) This way my husband can transport it to work, because I know all the guys there will LOVE it! I can't report on any surface oil yet, but I suspect it will be gone before that happens! I'm serving it with celery sticks, Chicken in a Biskit, and Tostitos scoops.

Easy, but I think it would be best made with chicken breast.  I found it to be very "tuna-ish" with the canned chicken.  Way to hot for my taste.

I loved the idea of this recipe, but I took some of the suggestions and what I did was to eliminate the ranch dressing and replaced it with sour cream.  I loved the blue cheese dressind idea, but what I ended up doing was to add actual blue cheese, which was fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe!  Grated some pepper jack instead of using cheddar, and used Tabasco brand Chipotle Hot Sauce.  Boy was this tasty!!  I've since tried it with both fresh and canned chicken, and i must say, I prefer the canned.  It must be the trailer in me! Also of note:  Chikin n a biskit crackers are great with this.

This was just okay for our family.  We love wings and were hoping for something closer to that than just another dip.  I couldn't get Franks so I used Texas Pete's.  It wasn't near hot enough so I added more Pete's and served with our favorite hot sauce, Shula's (try it, it's delicious on everything).

I Love this dip. I did make quite a few changes though. I used blue cheese dressing then I added about 1/3 cup of crubled blue cheese to intesify the blue cheese flavor.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of canned(hate that stuff!) and I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (I like it really spicy) and I added a 1/2 cup of finely chopped celery for some texture. Then I used tortilla chips for dipping  The results were excellent!

I had this dip several times. It is wonderfully addicting. The ONLY thing I would do differently is to use fresh chicken either poached or wrapped in foil w/ aromatics and roasted in the oven. This is merely a personal preference as I have had this dip using canned chicken and the taste was excellent.

I made this dish for a house gathering and everyone looked it.  I didn't use the canned chicken (as mentioned by previous reviewers) but 3 chicken breast.  This dip was easy and had a good taste.

This went over great at my football party. The only change (as others have said) was to use fresh cooked, shredded chicken and layer in a pan to prevent the "ugly" effect. I also used homemade ranch from the Hidden Valley packet and just a sprinkling of cheese over the top.

Not as good as I had hoped it would be.  I don't plan on making it again.  It really looks so unappetizing, probably part of the reason it wasn't very popular at a party I brought it to.  The jalapeno popper spread (from allrecipes) I made was a big hit, but this dip was not.

Good overall recipe. I boiled a chicken breast then put it in the food processor.  I did also omit the cheese.It really goes good with celery. I would prefer bleu cheese dressing next time and I may try our favorite BBQ sauce ( very spicy jerk) also as my hubby does not like buffalo. Also the low fat cream cheese worked well for us. I will make this again for New Years.

Great recipe! I added onions and took out celery. Everyone loved it and couldn't stop eating it. It serves best in a crock pot.
Thanks

Delicious. I am not a huge buffalo fan and I loved this. We used fresh chicken, half ranch half blue cheese. We also used Ken's brand Buffalo dressing which gave it some tang. It was awesome and everyone at our party LOVED it! I will definitely make this over and over!

I use fresh chicken breasts, not canned. I also substitute low-fat cream cheese, low-fat Ranch, and low-fat Extra Sharp Cheddar for the regular stuff. Even guys who swear against low-fat foods can't tell because it's so delicious.

This is always a hit wherever I bring it.  I do cook it slightly different, I buy a cooked chicken at the store, combine that with all the ingredients, and put it in the over for 20 min at 375.

Have made this a couple of times - most recently for a Christmas get together.  Everyone brought drinks and appetizers.  It was a hit!!  They were dipping everything in it - including buffalo chicken wings that someone else brought.

I make this dip for potlucks and EVERY time I make it, I get multiple requests for the recipe.  I cook 2-3 boneless skinless chicken breasts on the stovetop until it's no longer pink and the juices run clear.  Then I chop it using my Pampered Chef food chopper, it doesn't get any easier than that!  I use about 1-1/2 cup of Frank's Red Hot, 2 blocks of cream cheese, 1 cup of light Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  It's so easy and ALWAYS a HUGE hit!  Everyone requests it whenever there's a potluck.  Oh - I heat and mix everything on the stovetop, then transfer to a crock pot.  Turn it on the lowest setting and it stays warm and yummy for hours!

My mother used to make this when I was a kid, and I completely forgot about it until I saw it here. I made it, and liked it but I didn't LOVE it. I used half ranch dressing and half blue cheese because it just seemed wrong to not have blue cheese in a buffalo wing dip. I kind of felt like I was dipping crackers into a container of ranch/blue cheese after people had spent the night dipping their wings into it.

I made this for an office party, and I am not kidding it was gone in minutes!! Whenever we have other work "food days" this dish is on request! They make me bring it!! This is incredible! But I don't use the cheese on top because it already has plenty of cheese and gets a greasy orange color to it. Amazing!!

It's great. I agree layering and baking is best alternative, and to use bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch. I also pick up a roasted chicken at the grocery store instead of using canned. It provides a nice combo of white and dark meat -- fantastic!

Very good.  I did as suggested and layered instead of mixed it altogether but then ultimately just ended up mixing it altogether anyway and it's just as good either way IMO.  We're taking this for a thanksgiving dip tomorrow. Yum! Thanks much!

This dip is the best.  Depending on what Hot Sauce you use it can get really hot, so I only use 1/2 cup.  Also I cook and cut up chicken tenders to add to it instead of can chicken.  Even my 3 and 2 year old kids like it.  It's just great for when the Steelers play.

THIS DIP IS THE BEST!!!  I use Perdue Chicken shortcuts instead of the can chicken.  I just chop it up and follow the recipe.  I serve it in a fondue pot to keep it warm.  Always a big hit , thanks for sharing:)

I first tried this dip at a friend's house. She used the crock pot-- the orange-greasiness, that wouldn't stay mixed, was really a turn off.  I tried the layered/oven method as others had talked about. This is the way to go!!  It was a hit!!

I substituted blue cheese for the ranch and it was fabulous.  I also layered the chicken over the creamcheese and dressing mix and then topped with cheese.  The presentation looked much better and everyone was begging for the recipe.

This is great!  The first time I made this, I "halved" everything just to make sure I would like it.  I put everything in a slow cooker (I have a small one just for appetizers) and let it simmer for a while.  The chicken is fully cooked so I felt there was no need to cook it on the stove first just to heat it up.  It was so easy just to throw all of it in a crockpot.  It was wonderful and I will make for all of our parties.

I have made this dip many, many times.  It is ALWAYS a HUGE hit and very addictive!!  I try to cook my own chicken, but I always keep canned chicken on hand, just in case.  I have also tried different variations of cheese and have never been disappointed in the results.  I have made in the crock pot, on the stove, and in the microwave.  Anyway you choose, it is wonderful.

Dont let the ugly color of this dish fool you, it tastes INCREDIBLE!  Also I made my own fresh chicken, which if you have the time, tastes way better.  Also I dont have a slow cooker so I just covered it and let it simmer on the stove.

AWESOME! This is the best dip. My husband and I love buffalo wings (or buffalo anything!) I made this last week, and it will be a new staple in our party food. We love to entertain and this one will be a hit.  I used real chicken, baked for 30 min. like someone else suggested, then shredded. I also used low fat cream cheese to spare a couple calories (and you couldn't tell at all) and I used closer to a full cup of Franks Buffalo Sauce (not the pepper sauce).  Put it in the crock pot and it was great! Can't wait to make it again!

I am completely addicted to this dip!!!  When I first made this recipe it was for a quick snack-like dinner...and then I ended up having it three more times that week!  I use Texas Pete hot sauce and tortilla chips, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly.  No changes necessary!  From now on I will always keep these ingredients on hand for my future cravings.  SO GOOD!!!

Made this and really enjoyed it.  I cooked chicken breasts and shredded the chicken instead of canned.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.

AWESOME!  Thank you for the great recipe.  The only alteration to the recipe was that I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese & 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing.  I wanted a spicier dip and this provided that and more.

Excellent! I was looking for something 'orange' for a grown up Halloween party and this worked wonderfully.  I skipped the canned chicken and used cooked chicken breast.  I skipped the slow cooker part as well due to time and just reheated at the party and it worked well. Served with 'witches fingers' made from bread sticks and sliced almonds for nails. It looked gruesome but it was a hit!! Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

Very good, but an awful color. I used a rotisserie chicken as others suggested (although I really like canned chicken! Don't laugh..It makes a terrific chicken salad) I think next time I will sprinkle toasted sliced almond over the top rather than the cheese.

This is really good.  Instead of canned chicken, i used pre-cooked roasted chicken cubes and shredded them in a food chopper.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent.  I don't like canned chicken so I used chicken breast and chopped it.  I recommend adding the ranch and wing sauce to the chicken based on your desired thickness.  Mine was a little runny, but still really great.  Everyone loved it!  Great with celery, not so great with crackers. Next time I'm going to try french bread.

OMG- this tastes just like buffalo wings.  Everyone loved it, in fact it was the hit of the party- everyone standing around the buffalo dip all with celery sticks in hand. I can't say enough good things about this recipe. I only changed a couple things- I baked 3 chicken breasts with hot sauce @ 350 for 30 minutes, shredded this once cooled, and proceeded with directions as stated. The other change was that I used 1/2 cup ranch dressing, and 1/2 cup blue cheese because everyone either liked one or the other, and they didn't know that the other dressing was even in there.

Every one at my football party loved this recipe. I served it with "Scoops" tortilla chips, celery, and crackers. I did the half ranch and half bl cheese way. I will make this quite a bit I predict.  Thanks

Awesome.  Made this for tailgate and used pyrex heated tote.  I used three chicken breasts cooked in a pan and then shredded in food processer.  I used a cup of BC and added a handful of BC crumbles.  I also added a whole cup of Franks "wing" sauce and a 1/2 packet of dry ranch dressing mix.  Mixed all ingredietns well and heated through in pan.  Did not add cheddar and did not have to bake.  Served with bread flute cut in thin slices.  People where fighting over the last bits!  Fantastic.

I agree with all the rave reviews.  Another timesaver - go to the salad bar and get the chunk chicken they have to put on salads - it doesn't taste nasty like canned, but it doesn't require cooking or cutting!

Oh my gosh this an awesome dip. I host a lot of parties and this is a huge hit @ every party. The only thing I changed is, I use bleu cheese dressing and I dice up my boneless chicken breast into cubes instead of using the can chicken.

Changed a few things in this recipe to make it more "wing-like".  DId not use canned chicken; I cook some chicken up in oil in a frying pan and then either shred it or cube it and add back in after the other stuff is mixed together.  Used blue cheese dressing instead and did not use the cheddar cheese.  We like to use it with crackers, tortilla chips, and even wrapped up in soft taco shells for a meal.  yum yum

Unbelievably delicious!! This dip is very rich & tasty, even cold! My only complaint is figuring out how to make it a little softer when it's cold! I used real chicken breast strips & cooked them separately. I also had buffalo chicken sauce on hand, and used that instead of the hot sauce. Since the chicken was already cooked, I didn't see the need to bake it! I'll be making this for an upcoming float trip, and I think I'll add a little bit more sour cream & skip the oven altogether.

Out Of This WORLD!!!  This is so good and the easiest thing to make! I have made it a few times already, it has become my favorite.  I made this a day before this time and heated it up in the microwave and it was still great!  I have only served it with scoops so far.  Highly recommended!!!!

This was wonderful.  Made it for my diabetic father-in-law who loves wings, but is restricted, served with wheat crackers and celery.  I did not have enough hot sauce on hand, so added juice from jalapenos and about a tsp of cayenne pepper.  Also, I prepared the chicken and cream cheese as directed, but threw everything after that into the crockpot.  Was delicious!

We had this at a tailgate...now I will not go to a tailgate that doesn't have this dip.  It is that good.  I add one jar of the refrigerated blue cheese dressing found near the pre-made salad section in the grocery store.  Great with Stacy's pita chips.

Whoa, baby this is great.  I used low-fat cream and cheddar cheeses and cooked my own chicken breasts, then served with raw veggies.  The crowd went wild.

Everyone always asks me for the recipe! I just add all the cheese at once and don't save any for the top and it is delicious! I also serve with tortilla chips.

This was great.  I had to use Louisiana Hot Sauce b/c we didn't have Frank's but other than the recipe was followed exactly as written.  My kids were begging for a snack and I happened to have the ingredients...a good use for the canned chicken that never found a recipe until now.  They devoured it with celery sticks and vegetable crackers.  Will definitely make again for a party! I like the idea of adding blue cheese crumbles and fresh chicken.  We will have to try that.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, great as is.

I normally love everything that's already rated 5 stars by other users, but this one wasn't to die for.  Although it was pretty good, my friend and I could only eat a few servings before it was just a bit too much and wasn't as appetizing.  Thank you for sharing the recipe (I didn't change a thing), but it just wasn't a favorite.

This was an awesome recipe & not one person at the party thought differently. There's only 2 things I didn't do the same I added about 1/4c. more hot sauce to it cause we like things a little spicier & I served it with tortilla chips instead---that was really good!!

This tasted REALLY good... the only reason I give it the four stars is due to the appearance. I know it has been said time and time again in these reviews, but the greasy appearance is not appetizing. If you are cooking for a group, this is not the recipe to use... however, I just cooked it for my husband and I, and we really enjoyed it!!

I have made this a couple times and it is fantastic.  I try to eat "healthy", but I LOVE Buffalo wings.  So as a compromise, I'll make this with low-fat ranch, low-fat cheese, fat-free cream cheese and eat with carrots, celery and whole-wheat pita chips, Triscuits or All-Bran crackers.  You'd never know it was pretty good for you and it satisfies my craving for wings!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I baked regular chicken breasts instead of using canned -- I also added less cheese on the recommendation of others.  It was best with celery -- I thought it was too salty and using chicken flavored crackers compounded the problem.  Probably won't make this again.

I made this for my parent's superbowl party.  Probably wasn't the best choice given the people since they don't really like cheese all that much.  I thought it was pretty good but if you have leftovers, it congeals and takes on the container shape and the (orange) oils seperate out which is kind of gross.

Everyone knows this is a great recipe!!! What makes it better? Follow the advice of previous reviews like I did - it doesn't need cheddar, it only        makes it greasy & clumpy as it sits &  avoid canned chicken, fresh is best.

This dip is deadly (deadly good...not deadly bad!!)  I used low fat ranch dressing and Franks Buffalo Wing sauce (instead of the traditional hot sauce).  Everyone loved it...but it must be served warm. Thanks for this recipe...awesome!

Extremely easy and a huge hit!  The color is a bit "sherbert" like as a previous reviewer mentioned, but simply sprinkle some Italian herbs on it for some color and contrasting.  Also, it's not necessary to put in a mini crock pot.  This can be presented and reheated in a serving dish as well.

I made several changes to this recipe but loved the results!  First, I substituted a package of Perdue turkey shortcuts (2 cups of meat) for the canned chicken and used reduced fat cream cheese.  I limited the hot sauce to 1/2 cup, which was ideal for my family and guests.  Instead of transferring the dip to a crockpot, I placed it in a baking dish and popped it into the oven so the cheddar on top looked nice and bubbly.  We enjoyed the crackers and celery with the dip but surprise, surprise - my 4-year-old decided to dip an apple slice, and we loved the sweet taste with the spicy dip!

I have made this recipe for over a year now... for food days at my work and my husband's work, and also for parties at our home.
Everyone loves it, plain and simple.  I always serve with both chicken in a biscuit crackers and celery, and usually go a little heavier on the hot sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Was absolutely wonderful! I've made it 4 times now & everyone's loved it! I used a different brand of hot sauce & it was a bit spicy for me, but it was definitely worth the calories!

I brought this dip to my friend's Superbowl party and it was a definite hit!  I layered the ingredients as recommended by other reviews and I also boiled and shredded my chicken.  I baked it for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees & broiled it for an additional 3 minutes to give a nice, golden color to the cheese.  I served this dip with tortilla chips & celery but a friend of mine also used french bread for her dip.  If you like boneless buffalo wings, you'll love this dip!

All that I can say is "WOW"!  This was a HUGE hit at our superbowl party.  The recipe makes enough to feed a small country however.  With 7 hungry football fans we could barely put a dent in it.  Next time I will half the recipe even for a party.  Thank you so much - I will definately be using this one again!!

AWESOME!  We used boiled boneless chicken breast and served with Tostitos/Fritos and celery.  If I made again, I'd use a little less chicken.  Not really spicy which was perfect for me.

I made this for the superbowl and it was so good and addicting; everyone loved it.  I substituted low-fat cream cheese, low-fat white cheddar, 3 poached chicken breasts and added a little blue cheese.  I baked in the oven at 350 for 20 min then transferred to the crock-pot to keep warm for the party.  Can't wait to make this again!

This was awesome - I got great compliments on it at a Super Bowl Party. A few people requested the recipe. I didn't add the cheese - just seemed over the top.  I also baked it at 250 for a couple of hours before the party instead of using a crockpot.

Yummy! I made it pretty much as is, but used a full cup of the Frank's. It had a little kick, but not too much for the non-spicy lovers. Used fat free cream cheese, which I was afraid wouldn't melt up good, but it worked fine. Wish I had thought to use fat free ranch, but after all the junk we ate at the Super Bowl party, I don't think it probably mattered. :)  Used with tortilla chips. Awesome. Thanks!

My husband absolutely LOVED this. I thought it was really good, if a bit heavy (on the other hand it is party food!).  I loved it with celery sticks, and my husband loved it with tortillas. We'll definately be making this again. I think next time I'll try reduced fat cream cheese and dressing.

I just made this for the superbowl party and it is very good! The only thing I might change next time is adding less ranch by half, other than that it is awesome!

I *love* this recipe.  It has been such a huge hit with my family and friends.  We leave out the cheddar cheese, because we feel it creates way too much oil.  And we use Zesty Ranch instead of regular ranch for an added zip!

I made this and took it to a Birtday party and it was a big hit!!!  Instead of the canned chicken, I used the already cooked louis rich chicken breast strips and it turned out great.

This was a big hit.  I used Red Hot and it my little kids ate it.  I didn't think it was hot at all.  It just smells hot.  In addition, I added bleu cheese crumbles.  I didn't love the tortilla chips and want to find the perfect thing to serve with it.  Maybe I will try the Hawaiian bread.

This is a really tasty recipe!  I like the original version of the recipe using low fat cream cheese, and fat free ranch.  However, my wife and our children preferred the recipe with less hot sauce and more ranch and cheese.  They liked it because it didn't have as much kick and was creamier.  Variations can be made to suit most anyone.  A keeper!

This is absolutely delish!  And easy!  I prefer to use a rotisserie chicken or boil/shred chicken breasts rather than canned chicken and also use low-fat or fat free ingredients (I sprinkle cheddar on top only).  This is a highly-requested recipe!

Tried this recipe out in preparation for the Superbowl this weekend.  Used the can chicken stuff as I didn't want to make a breast just to try it out.  Anyway, the recipe turned out great.  I usually don't like hot sauce but the flavor was very unique and made you want more.  My boyfriend liked it very much and we will be making it this weekend.  Serving it with tortilla chips as I liked that better than using the club crackers I had.  Thanks for sharing.

Rave reviews from co-workers who plan to make this from their superbowl parties this weekend. I used chicken breasts, full bottle of Franks and full bottle of ranch. Mixed all in the crockpot and served hot. Delicious!

Very good, lots of compliments. Used 1/2 ranch and 1/2 blue cheese. Also used Tyson chunk chicken, a little more than called for, and backed off on the cheddar. May back off on the hot sauce next time.

This dip really surprised me. It was thicker than I expected and really great on celery sticks. I want to add a little more 'heat' next time I make it and want to try to get the color a little more appetizing! It is also good cold as other reviewers mentioned.

If you can get past the kind of unappetizing orangish color, your in for a treat.  Excellent!  A lot tastier if you add shredded chicken instead of the canned stuff (which I don't care for).

Great change from the traditional HOT WINGS!  I made this for a New Year's Eve party and everyone raved over it!  Made one addition to give it a Georgia flair by adding Vidialia Onion Peach Hot Sauce with the Hot Suace (1/2 and 1/2)  Will be keeping this in the family cookbook collection!

This was awesome! I made it for my husband's birthday and it was the hit of the party. I used just a tiny bit of cheddar cheese, but I wish I would have left it out since it made the consistency lumpy as the dip cooled. I kept it hot in my stoneware fondue pot over a low flame. Tasted great with celery sticks!

I've made this several times and it quickly disappears at our family parties (I just realized I didn't rate it yet). We like it best with fresh chicken, just cook a couple of skinless boneless chicken breasts in the microwave and chop up. It's also great with canned chicken and is my daughter's favorite!

This was good - but next time I won't use canned chicken. Like previous reviewers I thought it tasted like tuna a little bit. Also - it is VERY spicy and gets hotter the longer it sits!

This is wonderful recipe and leftovers are very good on baked potatoes.   I marinate my chicken breast in a chipotle sauce then cook them on the grill, and also I use Spicy Ranch dressing to give it more heat.

I made this dip for some friends on Christmas and it was such a hit.  Everyone loved it!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe but next time I would make more because it went so fast.  I will be making it on New Years.

OHHHHHH YEAH! Spicy yes!  I did like some of the others had said and I used some broiled chicken breast I had.  The only thing I did different was I just took everything (make sure to use fresh cheese for sure) and put it in a crockpot after the chicken was a tad shredded and stirred it here and there!  I had some very happy guests!  Thanks for sharing this one!

This is really good! I made it with blue cheese dressing and everyone loved it! The only slight problem I had was that I thought the canned chicken faintly tasted like tunafish. No one else seemed to notice, but i think I'm just going to used cooked chicken breast next time. Thanks for a great recipe! I already had 4 people call to get the recipe.

This is an awsome dip! Everyone always raves about it. Like others I didn't use the canned chicken, I bought a rotisserie chicken and picked that off the bone, it was the perfect amount. I also used half blue cheese dressing and half ranch. This is also great served cold.

We thought that this recipe was pretty good. It was made exactly as the recipe stated and the only thing that I was not sure about was the cheese. I preferred the dip taste and texture before the addition of the cheese. We will make this dip again but without the cheddar cheese.

Excellent.  I didn't use as much hot sauce because my husband doesn't like it really hot, but this was really tasty.  I wish I would have read the reviews before I made it and tried the bleu cheese dressing instead of the ranch, but I will do that next time.  I wouldn't change a thing besides that!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  Brought it to a football party on Sunday - everyone wanted the recipe!  I made a couple of changes -I used the Perdue Done Its instead of the canned chicken.  Also, someone recommended 1/2 blue cheese & 1/2 ranch dressing (great choice!)

I was dissapointed with this recipe.  It was ok, but from all that I have heard about the dip I was expecting something better.  If I make it again I will try some modifications, maybe reducing the amount of cheddar and adding more Frank's sauce.

I LOVED THIS AND SO DID ALL OF MY SUPER BOWL GUESTS.  IT WAS THE FIRST THING GONE, AND I RECEIVED SEVERAL REQUESTS FOR THE RECIPE.  THE PEOPLE THAT I GAVE THE RECIPE TO SAID IT IS NOW REQUESTED BY THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.  I LEFT OUT THE CHEDDAR DUE TO OTHER REVIEWS AND AFFRAID IT WOULD MAKE THE DIP GREASY, I ALSO BOILED BONELESS SKINLESS CHICKEN BREASTS FOR A FRESHER TASTE.

I took this to a party and got rave reviews! Everyone loved it. I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. I did wish I added more Frank's red hot - I felt it needed more. I will add more the next time I make this recipe which will be soon.

This is pretty good. I, like the others, used shredded chicken instead of canned chicken. I halfed the recipe and it still made quite a bit. If I make it again I'll probably change a few things to see if I can improve on it.

This dip is always a hit. I use Hidden Valley ranch dressing plus a quarter cup of bleu cheese.  I skip the cheddar cheese altogether.

Made this for a get together last night. I thought it sounded weird, but wanted to give it a try. WOW!! This was really good!! We had several people demand the recipe from us!! Took the advice of some others and used Bleu Cheese, and just a touch (small handfull) of the shredded cheese. Served with celery sticks and Ritz crackers. It was a HUGE hit. Thanks for an easy and GREAT dip!.

Great recipe.  Everyone loves it.  I usually boil two chicken breasts and shred instead of using the canned chicken.

I made this to take to a concert in the park outside of Chicago this weekend and everyone loved it.  It was gone immediately and I have also given the recipe to an Aunt who is making it for a birthday party this next weekend.  I did substitute blue cheese dressing for the ranch dressing and served it with Scoops chips and celery sticks.

A great dip for get togethers. Everyone loved dipping celery and tortilla chips into it.  Quick, easy, and foolproof.

Very quick and easy to make.  Not to mention it's pretty darn good too!!  I added more Frank's red hot to make it a bit more spicy.  The new black pepper jack doritos are awesome with the added spices!

without a doubt the most popular dip i've ever made - had to have made it over 50 times. i have friends from d.c. to chicago making it.  people are disappointed when it's not made.  frank's makes the dip and don't be afraid to up it to one cup for a little more bite.  best served with fritos scoops (2 bags to be safe) but really can be served with anything.  ran out of scoops last time and people started dipping pretzels, bread sticks and by the end even their fingers...well maybe not their fingers.  anyway props to whoever came up with this simple yet addictive recipe.

Many rave reviews. I would chop chicken a little more to make less chuncky but all the men said they loved it this way. I would also recommend a crock pot to keep warm. VERY BIG HIT!

I hate when people say this was great, but I changed this and that....but this one was great, but I did not add the cheese... I just felt it didn't really go with the dip.  Next time I might try it, but it was excellent without it.  Had a little kick, but not too much.  I served mine with tortilla chips... got rave reviews. (I also used chicken breasts I cooked, not canned).

This is GREAT!  Made as is, no changes (this time.....I try to rate a recipe as is before adding or changing to my personal preference).  All I did was add ALL the cheddar cheese to the mix, didn't sprinkle any on top.  This will be a keeper for sure.  Mmmmmm....Update 12/30/14-I have made this several times since and I now make it with real chicken breast I boil and shred myself (no canned) and use Bleu Cheese Dressing instead of the Ranch....everyone asks for the recipe!

This was so good! I set this out with celery sticks, and Fritos scoops while dinner was on the grill, and it was gone within minutes! The only thing I didn't do was put cheddar cheese on it. I didn't think it needed cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

OMG! How easy to put together! This went so fast at my father's day BBQ. Definately a hit for a group of hungry guys.  Thanks! I did use blue cheese versus Ranch - just a personal preference.

Well, I served this at a "Spice of Life" party last night and it was awesome. On my end, I do not do measuring cups and spoons very well..I am more of a grab and dump til it looks right kind of girl. I did rinse and drain the chicken and I also mixed the cream cheese, ranch, red hot and then added a couple of spoons of sour cream for kicks in the microwave before adding the chicken. I let it sit overnight in the fridge and then put it in the crock pot for an hour. It is 8am and my nieces are smearing the rest between flour tortillas for me to put on the grill!

I doubled the chicken, and the hot sauce, it was more substancial, and my husband likes spicy. I also only used a handful of cheese, just enough to give it a thicker consistency. It is a good idea to keep it warm with the crock pot. I liked it with celery for the crunch, but my husband liked it with crackers or tortilla chips.

Great. Didn't use Franks Hot Sauce because of the taste. Used more chunked chicken, and tortilla chips instead of crackers. Went over well with our friends. Will use again. Thanks.

I did this using the microwave and the oven, since I didn't have time for the crock pot. I microwaved the cream cheese and the salad dressing (I used a premium blue cheese dressing) for 2 minutes. I used boneless skinless breasts that I just chopped using the food processor. I followed what everyone said and used less cheese. This was AWESOME. It was better after it had set for a few minutes and cooled off, since it was less drippy. The guys loved it and fought over it.

This was ok. I don't know if I will make it again.  I was excited about the recipe since we love anything and everything buffalo but I was pretty disappointed.  The only reason I will make it again will be if I need few different types of dips/apps for a party. And then I will only make a half batch.

Wonderful!! Everyone loved the flavor.  A few said it needed to be spicier but they like things super hot.   I used cooked fresh chicken instead of canned because I had some on hand and reduced the cheddar by half according to others recommendations.  Taste wise you could probably leave it out all together but it seemed to help hold the dip together and give it a better consistency.

This dip is absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I took it to a party and it was devoured.  I followed the recipe exactly and used tortilla chips and celery.  I will definitely make this again.

Went over well with a bunch of wing eatting men. I added extra hot sauce, almost doubled it and I was still asked if it could be made hotter next time. Excellent recipe

Not exactly what I thought it would be.
Too cheesy, I don't know, just not the flavor it should be.

Wow!  My company went wild for this.  I thought it tasted great, but was a little too rich for me.  I left out the chedder cheese.  I think that would have been way too much. I also used blue cheese instead of ranch.

I took this to a party and it was the most popular dish.  I am constantly asked to make this.  I use fresh chicken and liked it much better with ranch rather than the blue cheese.  My kids love it on tortilla chips

This is the ultimate in party fare.  My family and friends like it with just the celery.  The chicken flavored crakers seem to taste too salty with the dip.  If you have a small crockpot put the dip in that on low to keep the ingredients melted, but check every now and then to make sure not burning.  This is the best!!!!

This was the best, easiest and most unique dip I have ever made!  Very easy - do not change a thing.  Like others, I was skeptical about the canned chicken, but it was actually fine and no tuna taste to me (it did smell funny coming out of the can though).  My guests could not stop eating this.  I will for sure make this again and again!

I make this recipe at least 2-3 times a month. Great for a Sunday afternoon vegging out & watching movies. DH & I both LOVE it, as does everyone I have ever made it for. I add an xtra 1/2C cheddar, & make it all in a pan on the stove. Just mix everything together xcept cheddar-add at the end. Reheats yummy, just doesn't look as good! THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT RECIPE!

I made this for a happy hour party for a bunch of men.  It was a huge hit!  I took some of the other suggestions and only put 3/4 cup cheddar cheese in the dip and didn't put any on for the topping.  I also served it with Fritos.  It's a winner!

This a great recipe, it came together quickly.  I used two cans of chicken plus 3 cooked chicken strips so there would be some larger chunks of chicken.  Instead of ranch I used blue cheese.  Finally, I baked this in the oven at 350 for 30 mins because I don't have a slow cooker.  I serve these with fritos scoops and celery sticks.  I got rave reviews for this one at a superbowl party in Buffalo, NY so you know this one is good.

This recipe is awesome!  I took this to a work party and everyone raved over it!  My hubby also LOVES it, wings are his favorite.  I used Fritos Scoops and celery - the Fritos are so yummy with it..they're a nice sturdy chip so you can scoop up a good bit of dip!  The only thing I'll change next time is the canned chicken - I just really don't like it.  I'll boil chicken breasts and shred the meat instead.

this was great.  we liked it best with carrots and celery. the canned chicken was good because it fell apart in the dip. the cheddar cheese was good in it too.  i actually mixed in some extra cayenne to make it hotter.

It took me a long time to decide on making this recipe.  I just couldn't believe that it would really be that good.  Well folks....it is def worth making.

Easy as can be and delicious.  Only thing I did different was not add as much cheddar and I baked it for a short time rather than put it in a slow cooker.

Though it tasted good on anything I dipped into it, my favorite was the Tostitos Gold chips which I also use for Chili.  Celery was a close second.

I made this about 3 years ago for a Super Bowl party...now every year eveyone asks me if I am bringing "the dip".  I have to make a double batch now!  The Chicken in a Biscuit crackers get a bit salty after eating so many so I also use a less salty cracker with them and the celery stalks.  Always a hit!!!

This dip was amazing!!! Everyone raved abot it!Even those who don't like hot stuff!! Next batch - I will make 1/2 with regular Frank's and the other half with Frank's X-tra hot sauce. I won't be adding any extra cheddar - the consistency changed after I added the cheddar - other than that - it's a keeper !!!

This was a big hit. I omitted the cheese, otherwise made it as written. Next time I will try it with bleu cheese dressing. The biggest complaint was that it was almost too rich.

This was ok.  I made it for a party and it did not go over very well.  I made the recipe just as directed w/out any additions or substitutions.  I won't make it again....just our preference.

This was a really good dip. It was a little spicy for me, but then again I am very sensitive to spicy food, but my boyfriend absolutly loved it, and demands that I make it for the superbowl this year. He suggested that I use more hot sauce, but other than that I made this recipe exactly as stated.

This was awesome.  My husband was very leery of the whole idea when I told him what I was making for our New Year's Eve party.  However, it was gobbled up and I think my husband ate the most.  It tastes exactly like buffalo wings.  We had it with celery and tostitos.  I doubled the recipe for everything except the cream cheese, we used three instead of four.  We also used chicken breasts that we pan fried and then chopped and the blue cheese instead of the ranch dressing, omitting the cheddar cheese like most of the reviews say.  Excellent recipe...going in the keeper box!

I brought this to a New Year's Eve Party and it was a HIT!  I added 1/2 c. ranch and 1/2 c. blue cheese dressing.  I also cut up baguette bread to serve with it.  Scrumptious w/ the bread! This is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing.

You can't go wrong with this recipe. I even used a bit less chicken than called for and it turned out FABULOUS. One of the best dips I have ever made.

This recipe is GREAT!  I followed the suggestions in some of the other reviews and didn't use the cheddar cheese, but it was great without it.  I will use just a little more hot sauce the next time, but we like things pretty hot.  Everyone loved it, and I'd say that if your serving alot of people, the amount of hot sauce that it calls for is perfect...spicy, but not too hot.

Excellent.  I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 blue cheese as suggested by other readers; however, it was still too greasy from the cheddar.  Next time I'll use all blue cheese and just sprinkle some cheddar on top.  Everyone loved this.

this dip was wonderfual and got fabulous reviews by everyone at Christmas time!  I boiled 2 large checken breast for a while, then grilled on a pan and shredded it/cut it up.  I also mixed blue cheese crumbles into the sour cream.  Served with tostitos, but they were not sturdy enough- will use the Rold Gold next time (which will be this weekend!)

Wow! This is excellent!  Took advice of others and went with the blue cheese and didn't use the shredded cheddar.  I always look to save on calories and fat.  Used Wish Bone Just 2 Good dressing and light cream cheese, served with celery and assorted crackers.  Received many compliments and requests for recipe.

Fantastic.  I tried many new recipes for Christmas this year and this is the only one that I will use again.  We only used 1/4 cup of hot sauce and it was perfect.  Everyone loved it including teenagers who love spicy food and Grandma who usually finds Buffalo wings too spicy.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I've had this in my recipe box for 2 years and FINALLY made it yesterday...it was DEE-LISH!!! I omitted the cheddar cheese completely, but the rest was exactly the same.  Didn't use the crockpot...microwaved at 40 percent power for about 20 minutes --stirring half way.  I served with wheat thins and celery sticks.  I didn't think i'd like the celery, but it turned out to be great.  The crunchy with the hot/creamy dip was awesome!

WOW! This is awesome! I added some chopped green onion & that really did it! Also cooked & shredded some chicken breast instead of using canned. This is SO much easier than making wings, and has the same flavor. Already have plans to make it for holiday parties!

This dip is out of this world.  I used 2 chicken breasts that I boiled and shredded and I have to admit, I used more than 3/4 cup of hot sauce; I used closer to 1 1/2 cups as I love it and left the cheese out.  You gotta try this, it is amazing and my co-workers are going to goggle this up.  Thank you for a new "favorite".

This is a great dip. I used chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken and blue cheese dressing instead of ranch as some previous posters suggested. This really tastes best when kept warm, so if you have one of those dip-size crock pots, use it.

This was awesome and a big hit at my party last night. I didn't change a thing, but I think next time we will try to make it with actual baked chicken instead of canned chicken to see which way we like it best. I even got an email from a friend who said she normally doesn't like that kind of thing but she couldn't get enough of it! I highly recommend this!

Loved this recipe. Was great with celery sticks. A big hit at parties. You don't have to worry about anyone else bringing the same thing.

Excellent! Absolutely awesome dip. I doubled this recipe for a catering event I did recently and there wasn't a spoonful left. I think they'd have licked the chafing dish if I'd have let them! I dice up a few stalks of celery and add it directly into the mix, and I boil chicken breasts instead of adding canned chicken...the flavor and texture is just worth it. Served with celery sticks and butter crackers. WONDERFUL recipe!

Absolutely Wonderful dip! My in-laws came over for a football game and couldn't stop going back for more of this. The first bite my husband took he said its not bad he went back later after it had time to soak in the goodies real good and he said , wow this is pretty good! and our daughter LOVED IT! Great recipe I will make again!..oh and I used a BIG can of chicken from walmart that comes out more shredded and it was delicious! also I used Bagget bread to dip it with (I know spelling is wrong on this) .

I made this last night for Bunko and it was devoured!  I've already had to email the recipe to everyone today.  The only thing I changed was to use 4 smallish chicken breasts that I baked in foil for about 30 minutes as opposed to the canned chicken.  I just don't like the thought of canned meat too well.  It definitely wasn't the prettiest dish, but certainly the tastiest!  I will be making this again for our Christmas party, but doubling the recipe!

Kinda greasy. I did substitute hot wing sauce for the hot sauce, next time I won't. Also, next time I will shred my own chicken instead of canned. Didn't care for the texture of the canned chicken. Still tasted ok though.

I'd give this a 5 except I changed a couple of ingredients to use what I had in the house...I used 1/2 jar of Hooters med sauce in place of the pepper sauce and 2 foil packs of chicken. I made it on vacation one morning before leaving for the day so it could have time for the flavors to mix and we all ended up eating it for breakfast! Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe..but I've made a few changes.  I use 4 large cans of chicken...1 1/2 cups of Ranch and 1 cup of celery chopped.  I mix all the ingrediants, as they are, in a bowl...pour them into a 9 x 13 baking dish and stick it in the oven for an hour.  Turns out awesome...less work...ALWAYS gets rave reviws!!!

The first time I made this, I put it all in the slow cooker as the recipe states, but it looked gross.  So I changed it to a layered dip: cream cheese and hot sauce as first layer, chicken and dressing as second layer, and some shredded cheese on top (1/2 to 1 cup).  Then I microwaved the whole thing for about 5 minutes.  It looked a lot better and didn't separate.

Definitely satifies a craving for buffalo wings. The recipe is delicious as is but next time I am also going to try it with bleu cheese dressing just because I like it so much. I also put out a bottle of Frank's (none other) for those who want to add a few dashes for some extra flavor.

I made the recipe as listed, leaving out the cheddar cheese as so many had recommended.  It's ok - did not get the rave reviews.  I probably won't make it again.

I LOOOVVVEEE this dip. It has been an absolute HIT every time I make it!! I add more hot sauce as it is a little cool for my families hot taste. Chicken flavored crackers are a little too salty for me so I use town house or baguette bread sliced thin!

I make this by request for just about every gathering I go to & end up giving the recipe to a few people every time.  I use blue cheese dressing from the refridgerated section instead of ranch for a more authentic chicken wing taste.  I'm sure it is great with ranch too.  My guests always rave about this, we like to serve it with tortilla chips along w/ the crackers & celery.  EXCELLENT!!

This dip is terrific.  I use chicken breast that I cook in Frank's Red Hot sauce for some more kick.  I serve it with blue corn chips.

This was a delicious recipe with a nice, but not overpowering buffalo wing flavor.  I was entertaining a small group, so I cut the recipe in half, froze half, then put the remaining 1/4 in a "little dipper" crock pot.  It worked wonderfully and was a hit.

Great unique dip for a SuperBowl party...beats eating messy chicken wings!  I used a medium hot chicken wing sauce instead of just pepper sauce, and I ommitted the shreadded cheddar cheese.

I made a dip recently that was similar to this and it was good, but this recipe is even better!  I did make minor changes by using real chicken breasts, baking it and serving it with tortilla chips.  Everyone loved it - especially the guys.  My brother dubbed me the "queen of hot dips" after tasting this.  That's how good it is.  This dip will be perfect for football games in the Fall.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will be serving for many occasions!

Tasted great - looked terrible.  MUST not cook with cheese as the oily film left is very unpleasant looking.  However, served it at a staff function and got many requests for the recipe - even with the orange oil!

Yum! I made this for my recipe club and it went over great! I used Louisiana Hot Sauce since that was what we had in the house and sauted some boneless, skinless chicken breasts in olive oil, added salt, pepper, garlic & onion (salt or powder). Perfect for parties or just snacking on during the weekend!

This was ok.  I dont think I will be making it again though.  I used some leftover chicken breasts, I dont like the taste or texture of canned chicken and I also substituted blue cheese dressing for the ranch and left out the cheddar cheese.  So my review may not be entirely fair, because I did alter it.

I had never had can chicken before and did not like the taste.  I took myself out of the rating and asked my guest to rate the dip.  They said if I made it again they would eat it, but they wouldn't call and say, "please make that dip again."  I plan on making it one more time and use chicken breast instead of can chicken.  Maybe add some more hot sauce.

Served this at my last party and it was hit!  I enjoyed the "hotness" of it but a few thought less hot sauce would be better, so I would recommend adjusting how much hot sauce you use according to how you like your hot wings.  Everyone asked for the recipe - thumbs up!

I really loved the taste of this recipe, I didn't use a crockpot so it didn't get hot and bubbly so that's why no five stars (my fault).  I used blue cheese instead of ranch dressing becuase we are big blue cheese fans.  Definitely will make this again.

This has to be the best dip I have ever eaten. If you like hot wings, you will love this. And it being easy to make is an added bonus. I like mine HOT, so I also added 1 dash of Dave's Insanity Sauce,(i use it in everything!). It's even good the next day! A real keeper!!!

We skipped the cheddar cheese and used Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce.  Very delicious!!  Great with breadsticks and cornchips too.  We even liked it cold the next day.  A definate keeper.

I brought this to a party and I couldn't eat it because it was too hot for me - but others liked it.  It was also VERY greasy.  Maybe I should have used less hot sauce.

This was the first recipe from this site that I had complete success with.  It was easy, and was the first food item to be finished at a crawfish boil we had in New Orleans.  The spiciness was just right.  And it was most popular with the men.  Three men asked me for the recipe and I had to write it down for them.  Another woman called me for the recipe the day after.  It would be great to serve during football season! It's not much to look at, but once people try it, it goes quickly.  The recipe makes a lot. I mixed half Ranch and half blue cheese dressings and the flavor was not too strong for the non-blue cheese eaters.  I also toasted some pita bread that I cut into triangles, brushed butter on them, sprinkled them with salt, then toasted them in the oven.  They were great for holding up to the dip.  Celery worked well, too.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I'll use it often and I'm sure I'll pass it around!

One of the best and most unique dips I've ever tasted!  I tweaked it a little by boiling/shredding two chicken breasts, and using only 8 oz. cream cheese.  I took the advice of others to leave out the cheese, and it was a good choice-you'll never miss it.  The chicken crackers were a perfect compliment, and I will definitely be making this awesome appetizer again!

Everyone at my party loved it! I still have people asking me to bring it to their parties, or give them the recipe. I omitted cheddar cheese and it was still very tasty! I also served it with Scoops corn chips instead of crackers.

This is an excellent dip. If you like buffalo wings, you will love this. HUGE hit!! My friends & family couldn't get enough. Didn't change a thing. But I did put blue cheese dressing on the side for those who like it. Thank you for sharing your recipe! One of the very best!

Love this dip!  I took it to a party and four people asked me for the recipe.  I changed it a bit, I used frozen chicken chunks, 1 cup hot sauce and used 2 cups of shredded cheese.  Very yummy with tortilla chips too!

I brought this recipe to work in a small crock pot.  I cooked everything the day before and placed in crock pot the next morning.  It was absolutely delicious.  I must of handed out the recipe a dozen times!  I did use a little extra bleu cheese dressing as suggested by others.  I served with chicken crackers and celery sticks.  This one's a keeper!

This was pretty good, I omitted the shredded cheese and increased the hot sauce.  Next time I think I will make it as directed to compare as it was a little too spicy for some.

This is now a family favorite. I have had many requests to bring it to family gatherings. Be careful, it can be too salty if you add too much hot pepper sauce.

I had this recipe twice before I made it and thought it was great.  When I made it, I only made one change, which was to use Blue Cheese dressing instead of Ranch - and it made it even better.  The day after the party - we used the leftovers to make wrap sandwiches - which turned out okay, but gave me a tip for next time - adding diced celery and green onions to the mix AFTER it's cooked.

Not bad.  I'm a big cheese eater, and I really think the cheese could've been omitted from this recipe.  I only used one pkg of cream cheese and two cans of the chicken.  definately needed more hot sauce.  It was a good one to try, but doubtful I'll be making it again.

Very good.  I will definitely make it again and again.  I boiled a chicken breast in place of canned chicken. Much cheaper.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this recipe many times for work and now I think everyone at work has the recipe.  It doesn't need any changes - it is awesome the way it is!  The celery makes a nice change as a dipper over crackers and chips.

Absolutely AWSOME. This dip is fast and easy and loved by evryone who tries it. I brought it to a holiday party and there wasn't a bit left and everyone wanted the recipe. I made it the night before and then just threw everything in the slow cooker until we got to our party. A sure crowd pleaser!!

This dip was good...although I have had better.  I made it today, "testing" it for our SuperBowl party next week.  My husband ate it, but only said it was OK.   After about 20 min. of simmering, it started bleeding oil...don't know if it was from the cheese or what.  Anyways.  I like the Chicken Enchilada Dip better!

This was not a big hit with my family.  We were expecting the dip to taste like Buffalo Wings, but all we could taste was the hot sauce and cheese.  We will stick to the real things next time.  Thanks, anyway.

Very good, will be a regular at parties.  Same as many others, I had people lining up for the recipe.  I think next time I will add a little more dressing, just 1/4-1/3 cup more.  I think that depends on the brand of dressing you use since some are thinner than others.

Really good!  I followed the recipe to a T and I do have to agree with others.  This dip is really not aesthetically pleasing.  It does taste good tho!  You'll just have to convince guests to eat it :)

I was making this in a small crockpot to take to our family christmas party.  My grand daughter was having a birthday party that afternoon.  One parent asked me if he could taste it.  Then he had everyone sampling the dip.  I am glad it wasn't my only donation to the party because there wasn't any left, but it was great to see everone enjoy it.  I have made it again just for me and hubby!!

AMAZING!  I made this for a NYE party and it was a hit!  I only used 1/3 cup of hot sauce because it was the extra hot kind.  Gave it a great zing!  I didn't use all of the cheese either.  I will be definately making this for other get togethers, but I think I will try with blue cheese next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

LOVED IT!!!!!! I made this on Christmas eve... it was the biggest hit of all.  I followed a tip of another review by using actual chicken breasts, and used a full cup of hot sauce.  I also used blue cheese dip rather than ranch.  I did not use a slow cooker, but rather put it into a casserole dish in the oven.  It turned out awesome. There were only 7 people over, and there was almost nothing left.  No one could walk away from it.  I did not try the canned chicken, but would totally recommend using chicken breast instead.  Also served with natcho chips...

I used 1/2 cup of ranch and 1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing, and instead of the cheddar cheese, I stirred in about 1/2 cup of blue cheese.  I then baked mine in a stoneware pan, the dip stayed hot for quite awhile and it was a huge hit at my party!

This recipe is the perfect non-traditional appetizer.  Works well as a dip for crackers and veggies, but also works well as a spread for bagels.

Awesome!  I altered it a bit and used 3 cooked and shredded chicken breasts instead of the canned, one 8 oz. cream cheese, and the whole 12 oz bottle of Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  It is even better cold the next day and rolled into a cheeseball!!!

I originally rated this dip with a low number of stars.  I think that maybe I just did something wrong.  After making it again the crowd LOVED it.  And so did I.  For superbowl friends were calling and asking for the recipe.  I am sorry for the previous bad review.

"This dip was just -ok- nothing was "wow" about it.  It made alot so I was able to serve half of it Christmas Eve. and then heat the second half for Christmas day.  Each night entertaining different people and the dip just not moving.  I will not be making this one again."

So yummy! Followed the instructions exactly. I have never used canned chicken before, but this tasted just like buffalo wings. It had that kick to it but it wasn't too much. Will make again!

Very Yummy!!!  Although, I did make some changes just like others....I poached 4 chicken breasts and shredded them, I substituted Blue Cheese Dressing for Ranch, I used only 12 oz.(a brick and a half) of Lite Cream cheese and never used the Cheddar Cheese!!  You will never miss it!!  My sister liked it better when the crock pot had been turned off for a bit....it isn't as runny!!  We ate it with celery sticks, wheat thins, tortilla chips.....whatever!!

We had a party Saturday night, and this was the only thing there was nothing left to speak of. My husband has been bugging me to make this again every day since.  I used a little less cheddar, substituted blue cheese dressing, and threw some blue cheese crumbles on top. Definitely a keeper!

I had previously rated this recipe five stars and stand by that rating. Upon making this again, I purchased a roteserrie chicken and picked off the meat. I also still only used 1/2 cup of the hot sauce and it was just right for me. I also eliminated the cheese this time as I see no need for it. The dip has enough flavor on it's own without the cheese. Now my favorite dip!

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe.  We like a lot of kick, so we used a whole cup of Red Hot, and bleu cheese dressing sprinkled with extra bleu cheese instead of Ranch.  We put it in a 9x13 pan and put it in the oven long enough to melt the cheddar.  Needed 2 bunches of celery, and tortilla chips were good too.  Got several requests for the recipe.  Yum!

Fantastic - a new family favorite!  Instead of heating the chicken and pepper sauce first, I just threw everything into the slow cooker and stirred ocassionally until well-blended.

Yummy scrummy!  I took this to a party tonight and it was a big hit.  I made it with leftover cooked turkey from the freezer and bottled bleu cheese dressing.  I used about half the shredded cheddar.  There was a big spoonful left, and since I didn't get much to eat at the party, I came home and turned it into a pasta sauce by mixing it into some cooked spaghetti and adding some pasta cooking water to make a sauce consistency -- tasty!  Thanks for the recipe.

FABULOUS!  I won't be able to make this too often -- I can't stay out it even cold!  I don't think it needs quite as much shredded cheese. I've already forwarded this to several friends.

Wow, I can't believe the raves on this one. Don't get me wrong it is an ok dip. I just seemed to get a different response than everyone else here, mine was "It's ok, if I never had it again I wouldn't miss it" I guess this one is a tosser from my recipe file.

Very easy to make and tastes so good! I used fat-free cream cheese and fat-free ranch dressing and it was still really good. This is also very good refrigerated with cheese flavored crackers.

Being from Bflo,Ny, this is the closest to ck wings. If you substitute 2 boiled ck brst & shred them instead of canned ckn & use a bottle of blue cheese instead of ranch, it works even much much better!

OH MY GOSH! Everyone went crazy for this! Made it as is the first time, and the second time changed it a bit to suit my tastes. More than doubled the hot sauce. Switched the cheddar to pepper jack, and used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch. I liked it even better the third time, when I omitted the cheese altogether (you will never miss it), skipped the dressing and topped it with blue cheese crumbles! Yum! Serve celery with it, its so good!

This dip looks disgusting but tastes like the real thing.  I made mine with 2 chicken breasts - cooked, chopped and patted dry with paper towels.  I threw everything into my Little Dipper crock pot and everyone ate away (I served with celery and Frito's).  I had no problems with grease as some others had (???)

This was really, really good!!  I served it early in the day on Thanksgiving for everyone to nibble on while dinner was being prepared.  People were practically putting their faces into the crockpot scraping every last bit out.  I noticed several people were skipping the crackers altogether and just putting spoonfuls onto their plates and eating it plain.  I do lots of entertaining where I serve  appetizers, and my husband requests that this recipe be included in my "regular" menu.  Thanks very much!

Excellent!  Hit of the Thanksgiving appetizers.  Caution - very rich!  I did add a packet of dried ranch as well as the bottled dressing, and probably only put 3/4 cup of Frank's Hot sauce in - plenty spicy.  Great with the celery sticks!

This was GREAT!  Made it as a dip for Thanksgiving, it was so easy and everyone loved it.  I halfed the recipe but left the hot sauce the same, infact ended up adding a bit more as to our taste.  I used chicken breasts instead of canned and seasoned them with salt and pepper.

Awesome!  Highly recommended.  I also boiled and then shredded 3 chicken breasts in the food processer.  Also substituted ranch for blue cheese like others suggested.

Fabulous!!!  Do use cooked chicken - it's worth the extra time, and blue cheese dressing for more authentic buffalo taste.     A guaranteed winner!

Thanks for a huge hit from kids to Grandma!  I doubled this recipe using 8 boneless chicken breasts, shredded, instead of canned chicken.  I made this for a graduation party, and everyone loved it, especially the "Atkins" people.  Thank you!

This was a great recipe for a crowd.  I kept it in a crockpot for our Halloween party and it stayed hot and creamy all night.  I would definitely make it again. It was very easy to put together too.

This was a bit hit at our football party. Added extra blue cheese dressing to cool it down a bit. Just add more or less of what you like, very easy. I also used fresh chicken breasts, not canned. Everyone wanted this recipe.

This was an excellent recipe! i am not a fan of the "chicken crackers" as they seemed to salty for this. the celery was great and so was some baguette bread!

Excellent! I made this dip 2 weeks ago and it was so popular that I've given it out to  co-workers who loved it at least 3 times already.  Also good with fresh sliced french bread.

This was great!  It went over really well.  I mixed the cheese in right before serving and gave a stir or two throughout the night and had no separation that some others have had.  Really good!!

This dip is awesome! I have had requests to bring this to the last 4 parties I have gone to! Everyone wants the recipe- everyone is crazy about this dip. The only thing I do is use "real" chicken in place of the canned chicken. It comes out perfect every time and it's the first dish to go at every party!

This is one of my favorites. We love Buffalo Wings & this is the easiest way to duplicate that flavor without a lot of work. The couple changes that I made are to use shredded cooked chicken breast for the canned chicken. And Bleu Cheese dressing for the Ranch since we are real Bleu Cheese lovers here! This works well in a crock pot.

I made this for a housewarming party - along with A LOT of other food.  This one by far went the fastest and I got so many compliments and requests for the recipe.  I made it as is - served with Chicken in a Biskit crackers, celery, and Frito Scoops.  The scoops were favored by far with this dip.

From living outside of Buffalo NY for YEARS,(and living on those delicious wings) this recipe was the best for dip!! I have varied this combo a few times(using 1/2 ranch and 1/2 bleu cheese; more hot sauce for the younger crowd, less for us who only like alittle kick!)I have even gone without the cheddar cheese when it was too late to run to the store. It STILL tastes good!

This is perfect with a couple additions.  I add extra buffalo wing sauce (Frank's Red Hot), a diced small onion and a 4 oz. can of chopped chiles.  Just the right heat and zesty flavor.  We like it best with tortilla chips.

This was the BEST!  Everyone LOVED it!  No one could believe how good it was and what was in it.  I will have to make this one over and over and over again.  Celery made this dip, the crackers were good, but the celery chuncks is what did it.

This is a very easy recipe to make.  Not only is easy to make but its delicious.  I made it for a crab feast we went to this past weekend.  There were a total of 12 people there and everyone loved it so much that there was nothing to bring home but the empty dish.  Instead of putting it in a crock pot I put it in a baking dish and microwaved it like others said they did.  I also served it with tostitos. Try it you won't be sorry and neither will the people you make it for.

Followed the recipe as directed except I added a little more canned chicken (only had 13 oz cans on hand) and a little more hot sauce.  Turned out great but I would cut the cream cheese down a little next time.  My husband loved it but next time I'd try tostito chips as well as crackers.

My husband LOVED this dip.  He has asked me to make it again soon.  The only thing I changed was I added some shredded, poached chicken instead of the can but I can't imagine that changing the results all too much.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This is a great dip and the first time I served it everyone requested it again, soon!  I followed the receipe exactly, except my store didn't have the right hot sauce, so I used Crystal Hot Sauce.  I'm making again tonight for a group of friends.

One word, FANTASTIC.  Every time I make this everyone raves about how great it is.  Instead of a slow cooker I just use a microwave safe bowl and to heat till ready.  Also, very easy to cut recipe in half when needed.

This recipe was a toss up since I love "Buffalo" style anything, but not cream cheese.  I went ahead and used 1 cup of Frank's to finish off what was left in the bottle and I added 1 can of black beans (to give it more substance).  Instead of canned chicken, which I don't like, I used some rotisserie chicken.  To my suprise, this was really good...but the vinegar from all of the hot sauce was a bit too much. Next time I'll stick with the right amount.  All in all, I would make this again to serve to company.  Thanks for sharing.

This was wonderful and easy to make. Followed other suggestions and used grilled chicken breast and served with celery and tortilla chips.  I  made it and the reheated it in the oven.  Next time might make two smaller dishes one with the ranch and one with the blue cheese.

Excellent!  I just had this at a party and had to ask for the recipe.  It tastes exactly like the buffalo wings that I like...wahoo!!  Thanks! ***We changed it a bit by adding in a shredded chicken breast and used bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch.***

Co-workers and husband liked this. I only gave it four stars since I halved the recipe and still had leftovers.

This is incredible!  So easy, too. We used the celery, which was the best, and also tortilla chips.  I doubled the recipe and everyone was still disappointed when it ran out-three days later!  I will cook it without putting in the crockpot and adding cheese and freeze in small containers.  You can then pull out of the freezer and use in the crockpot as you need it for parties.

I am not a big fan of Buffalo wings, so I rated this recipe according to everyone who ate it and they all gave it 5 stars! I served it with those new Ritz Cracker Dip sticks and celery. I even gave out the recipe to a few people.

I made this dip for my husband who loves hot wings.  He loved it.  I used low fat cream cheese and low fat ranch dressing.  Because there is so much flavor in this recipe, I didn't feel that the lighter ingredients were a detriment.  I made the dip in a pot on the stove, poured it into a casserole, topped with the cheddar cheese and microwaved it until the cheese was melted.  If you like spicy foods, you will enjoy this dip.
