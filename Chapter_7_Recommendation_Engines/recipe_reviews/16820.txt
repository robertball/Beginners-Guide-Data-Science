This is a tasty, easy to make soup recipe.  My husband loved it.  The next time I make it however, I would reduce the amount of rice.  The recipe calls for 2 cups and I only use 1 1/2 but still found that to be too much.  Next time I will only use 1 cup of uncooked rice.

This soup is really great. I did one thing to alter it; we do not eat white rice in our home, so I used a wild rice blend from Wegman's supermarket. It really added to the heartiness of the soup.

This had a good base. garlic, onions, chicken stock and the herbs and heavy cream.  I changed alot though. I added chicken with the sausage, italian green beans and diced tomatoes for color and pasta (tortellini or ravioli would be good too). Then topped it with a blend of italian cheeses (parmesean cheese worked well too).
My husband loved it!

Great flavor! Next time we will reduce rice amount by at least half. As per recipe, it turned out more like a casserole or stew. Can't wait to try it again with less rice !

As is, this is just sausage and rice and needs quite a bit of help - like a lot less rice and a lot more of something else.  I knew going in this was going to have too much rice so I prepared HALF the amount called for in advance, in chicken broth, and held it aside until I was ready to just add it to the soup at the end.  I added mushrooms, carrots and celery to the sausage to give this some color and substance and they were great contributions.  I added the rice at the end, then stirred in the cream and... I was still disappointed.  It could have been creamier for one thing.  And all those herbs just floated to the top and looked very unattractive; so unattractive that I skimmed most of it off and the soup was much improved, particularly in its appearance.  We both liked the final result but it traveled a long way in the process to get to that point.

WAY TOO MUCH RICE!  I thought this was a soup?  It was like a humungous moist "pre-packaged" rice dish.  Flavor was tolerable to me.  Everyone else hit the brakes after about 3 bites.  If you use hot sausage, it does make it quite spicy too.

I screwed this up at the end, and didn't add the cream, but I think it came out great as a rice dish!  Try it, I loved it!!

Very good soup. My husband and 5 kids ranging from 20 mos to 14yrs all said how much they liked it and had seconds or in my teenage sons case fourths! I did, as some others had suggested, and added cooked brown rice at the end so we would still have soup and not end up with a casserole. I also used ground sausage as that is what I had on hand. I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband made this for me last night and followed the recipe precisely. The flavor was very good but the broth was extremely soupy and salty. I will probably try to make this again though.

My husband and I were absolutely amazed when we made this recipe.  I had intended to follow it exactly, but we're not big garlic fans, and we love onions, so I made a few small changes.  I only put in a clove and a half of garlic, and I upped the onion to about 1 cup (half a medium onion).  I didn't quite have 8 cups of chicken stock, but I used what I had (probably about 6 or 6.5 cups).  We also like a lot of meat, so I believe we put 6 links of sausage instead of 4.  It was more like a stew than a soup, but we liked it that way.  I can't wait to make this again, and next time I plan to double it and share with relatives!  Thanks for sharing!

Hubby and I both enjoyed this. As we're vegetarians, I had no problem making a healthier, meat-free version. I used Tofurky brand sausages, used brown rice instead of white, and substituted plain soy milk for the cream (also reducing fat and calories). It was delicious; I will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing!

I made this using handmade sausages from a local farm.  Those were great of course, but the recipe would be just as stellar with store-bought sausages.  Scaled down for two, it was  a little small, but fabulously rich and creamy, almost like a risotto.  Don't change anything until you've tried it.

Definitely will be making this again. I added mushrooms, carrots, celery, and kale.  I also seasoned it with garlic salt, peppercorn, celery salt, a little thyme, oregano, and basil. 

I also added 2 cups of water to the broth, wish I had only used 1 cup of rice as it sorta became a rice dish, but it was oh so good!

A great soup and fairly simple to make. I heeded the advice of others who have made it, and used only one cup of rice instead of two. I thought it worked out  perfectly. Additionally, I used a wild rice mix I had on hand instead of plain white rice. Finally, I threw in some leftover chicken breast I had in the fridge along with the sausage. All in all, I thought it was an excellent soup and will be making it again very soon.

I made this hearty soup.  Easily great for lunches.  I used light cream and more stock then called for.  I also used Italian seasoning blend rather than measure the few spices.  I also used Arboro rice instead of a regular white rice.  This recipe was a quick soup and delicious!

My family liked this though we did make a couple of changes. One NO heavy cream was added to the pot since my oldest has a dairy allergy.  We also cut the rice in half based on the other reviews.
It was still really good.  I added cream to my bowl and it was even better!  But it was really good even without the cream.

So when I made this recipe, I looked at the comments first and made some changes:
I added less garlic (2 cloves) and instead of decreasing the amount of rice, I added more chicken stock (10 cups) to add liquid.  I also used fresh chopped oregano, basil, and parsley instead of dried herbs.  
And finally, I didnt add the heavy cream.  
I made it in 2 big spaghetti pots, and saved one pot for the freezer and shared the rest with friends. 
It's really delicious even with the tweaks to the recipe and its exactly what I wanted (an herb/sausage/rice/broth soup).  
Delicious.
