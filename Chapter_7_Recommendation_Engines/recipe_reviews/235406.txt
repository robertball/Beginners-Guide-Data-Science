Delicious! Make sure you use a small eggplant otherwise you will end up with extra unused slices. Very easy to assemble and packed with flavor! This makes 4 generous sides. I realized when I was on my third layer that I had forgotten to brush the eggplant with olive oil, so I only got the third layer. Not sure that really made much of a difference. The only thing I'd suggest it adding more cheese. 1/4 cup if very skimpy to cover the top, but that's personal preference. I used 1/2-3/4 cup total.  Next time I might even add a bit of cheese between the layers. Thanks Anthony for the tasty recipe!

Might want to consider pre-baking or grilling the eggplant prior to assembling for the oven.  My eggplant was still a little tough after 45 minutes.   And like any other recipe, you'll need to adjust the add-ins such as the vinegar and rosemary to you taste.  By the way, my wife loved it.

I like the seasonings with the peppers.
I salted my eggplant, then browned it in a dry non stick frypan before baking it to soften it.

The bals. vinegar was overpowering.  I would decrease the b vin. Next time.

Should've covered lightly , then removed at the end.  It took a while.  I was expecting magic.  It didn't happen, didn't wow.  Ya know, I love basil; & rosemary is okay.  Maybe adding more is the reason it's so bleh.  Eggplant isn't exactly mouthwatering on its own.  Such small amounts of spice for that much food.  'Could be, anyway.

My husband loved it!  Me Iâ€™m picky but the flavor is great.  We used it as a main dish.  May want to use it as a vegetable side in the future.  I added an extra red pepper because I love them.

Agree that the eggplant needs a head start in the cooking process. Great recipe.

I used balsamic vinegarette (my fav, Newmans Own) in place of the oil and vinegar. I didn't have onion or rosemary, I used Italian seasoning and onion powder. I did grill my eggplant in a stove top grill pan for just a few min first. It was delicious! Its more of a side dish than a meal
