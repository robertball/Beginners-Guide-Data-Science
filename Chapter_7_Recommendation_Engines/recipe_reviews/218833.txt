It's been windy, cold and wet and I wanted to try this, but couldn't on the outdoor grill. Instead, I browned Johnsonville Pork Chicken Sausage indoors. I then added all of the ingredients into my pressure cooker and let that do the work for me. In 15 minutes, we had and excellent sausage for our sandwiches.

Made this for guests and it was fabulous! No grilling in winter here so I pan sauteed the sausages and peppers and put everything in a slow cooker. Kept the recipe the same but added a few tablespoons of Giardiniera and everything had so much flavor it went quickly!

I come from the land of sausage sandwiches. New Jersey. Can't go more than two miles without finding s sausage stand. And because they are so good here, I never bothered to make them. Ours are traditionally in red sauce.
Having said that, I took a try at this.  This is sausage cooked more in a wine vinergarette. Interesting taste. I did find the white Merlot. Only makers I was told is Sutter Home and Berringers. What I find totally lacking in this recipe is time. So, here goes. I turned the grill on to high to cook off the crepe on the grill. All four burners. After 15 minutes I put it down to medium low. Put the pan of wine/peppers etc on one side. After 15 minutes it was simmering. Put the sausage on for 30 minutes, turning over a bit ( on the other two burners).  Then put the sausage in the pan for a few minutes. I did use fresh sliced onions and no olives (sacrilege here!) all in all, it was an interesting take on a staple here. Not bad but cannot hold a candle to the Jersey Boardwalk or Italian festivals. Sorry :(.

I invited the neighbors over for the first barbecue of the season and this was PERFECT. Everyone LOVED it and it was so darned easy to put together. I did not have white merlot so I used a bottle of chenin blanc. I served it with a tossed romaine salad and some toasted crusty rolls. YUM!!!!! Will definitely make this again and again! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

My neighbor has been doing this for years, except instead of the wine he uses beer.Fresh onions instead of jarred ones & no olives. But however you might tweak it-quite yummy.

This recipe is fun to make and tasty to eat. I used a fresh mix of green & red peppers and onions - didn't use cocktail onions or olives, just a personal preference - but otherwise followed the directions. I had never grilled sausages & veggies using a wine steam bath before, it worked very well. I think next time I do this, I may use a beer though. Because it's all done in the foil pan, clean up is a breeze. Will definitely make this again. Thanks, Johnsonville!
