I made this for our Christmas Pokeno and it was sooo good!  I shaped it into a Christmas tree and covered it with parsely flakes, and nuts for the string of lights, and red bell peppers for the ornaments.  I was afraid it would be too soft to hold the X-mas tree shape but it held up beautifully!!  I will be making this every X-mas!  Thanks!!

Thanks for all the nice reviews on this recipe.  This is a recipe that I made up by modifying the popular spinach dip a few years ago, it was successful with the people that I served it to, so I thought that I would publish the recipe on this website.  This recipe can be varied so much using ingredients that you like the most.  I use either cream cheese or the 1/3 less fat cream cheese or sometimes a mixture of both and have had great results. I also have sometimes varied the shredded cheese, depending on my mood ( I have used cheddar, and co-jack with great results as well) I usually use Knorr's Vegetable soup packet (so whatever size that comes in is what I use)  I also generally use pecans when I make it. (When I sent the recipe in for publishing, I wasn't specific enough...I just said 1/2 cup chopped nuts...pecans, walnuts or even toasted slivered almonds might work.) Like I said, this is the type of recipe that you can vary the ingredients to come up with something that is entirely your own...that is the great thing about cooking!

Wonderful appetizer! It's so easy to make and makes a great presentation! I used reduced fat cream cheese, Hellman's light mayo, and reduced fat Cheddar cheese so it was light on the waistline as well...but you could never tell by the taste! I also used Knorr vegetable soup mix and you could easily sub green onions for the water chestnuts. I served this with Roasted Vegetable Ritz Crackers and it was gone in no time! Thanks for great recipe SARAHB2!

This is simply the best spinach dip I've ever come across. I tried making it into a christmas tree like one reviewer and it came out terrific. Took it to a Christmas potluck at work and people oooohed and aaaaahed and then devoured it. The parsley flakes actually added a nice spicy touch.  I've made it for various other occasions and in other shapes, most notably a fish for a Pisces b/day.  I do add a small amount of chopped scallion just because I like the taste but I've omitted it too when I know people don't care for it. A fantastic recipe...thanks so much for posting.

I thought this cheese ball rocked and did my guests. People couldn't believe I had actually made it because it was so attractive as well as delicious. I couldn't find a .4 vegetable soup mix and I used a Lipton's Vegetable soup mix (they were out of Knorrs) and it was 1 oz. I think a .4 would not have been enough. I served with a variety of crackers and my guests gobbled it up. Actually I made two smaller balls instead of one large and I think that worked out better. In my opinion way more than 8 servings. I guess it depends on how much each person eats.  I also used the "1/3 less fat" cream cheese. I was a little leary of the walnuts but they were excellent with the other flavors. Thanks for sharing. I will definitely make again.

This cheeseball is delicious! I made it for a Christmas party that I was hosting. Keep in mind that it makes a HUGE cheeseball, it seemed more than twice as large as the normal cheeseballs you see at the store. Next time, I will likely halve the recipe.

Very good recipe. I only made a couple  slight changes. I used mushroom herb soup mix and pepper jack cheese. I left out the onion soup mix because I wanted the other flavors to come through.

I used this recipe to make a CHRISTmas setting for a group of CREAM CHEESE PENGUINS! How fun! I moulded the igloo out of it, spread a thin layer of sour cream to camouflage the spinach and help the parmesan adhere to the igloo, then I made some small Christmas trees out of the cheese ball recipe for the background, just coated them in dill and dusted them with parmesan as well!
My husband is a HUGE fan of the bread bowl filled with Knorr spinach dip and he LOVED this even better! I always have at least half the bread bowl left over. This year I made a double batch of this wonderful stuff and it was GONE! 
Guests said they recognized the spinach dip but this was a better tasting version!

This was delicious!  I have made the spinach dip using Knorr's dried veg soup mix and water chestnuts many a time, so I really enjoyed making one of my all-time favorite dips into a cheese ball.  So good, I almost made myself ill eating so much of it!!  Thank-you Sarah!

Very good.  My daughter made it as an appetizer for Christmas.  Left out the water chestnuts and used chopped pine nuts to coat it.  She made it in an oval shape.  It was a nice alternative to the "normal" spinach dip. Thanks for the recipe!

This was the hit of the party! I left out the water chestnuts (personal preference) and instead of rolling in nuts, I molded it into a wreath.

I didn't get to eat any of this because I made it for a Christmas event I wasn't able to attend, but it won first prize in the dip category. I had shaped it like a tree, covered it with parsley, used sunflower seeds for lights and used a tortilla cut into a star for a topper.

I would give this 6 stars if I could!  I made the Christmas tree shape.  The only problem was it looked so good I could hardly get my guests to eat it!  I didn't have a yellow pepper and stuck a strawberry on top of the tree.  I used pomegranate seeds around like a cranberry garland.  Easy to shape using plastic wrap.  I made ahead and froze it without the parsley or pomegranate seeds.  I took it out of the freezer to thaw slightly and added those.  This one's a keeper.  It will be a regular at my Christmas open house!

Wonderful recipe!  And SO easy--I just dumped the ingredients into my food processor, and it was mixed in a flash!  My husband won't eat mayonnaise, so I substituted sour cream. Additionally I added 1/4 c. white onion, as some of the reviewers said it was bland.  Excellent flavor!  Next time I'll try substituting a different soup mix or maybe even dry Ranch...  Yummy!

Great recipe. It made a lot. Next time instead of one large ball I would form it into 2 smaller, more manageable ones.

This is a good recipe. I went to a gathering and I also did a mold and it was cute (can't specify what the mold was but it would be seen at bachelorette parties) My mother loved it and has asked for the recipe. I used nuts only in specific areas of the mold and parsley in other areas. I will definitely make this agian...probably not in the mold though

Good recipe. Everyone liked it as a holiday appetizer, but It is a great recipe year round. I added diced green onion, a little black pepper, and some garlic powder. Frozen spinach needs to be drained well, and cut up really well unless you want long strings of spinach. I choped my spinach up, but would prefer an even more cut up spinach next time. Maybe kitchen shears would work best?
Edit: The second time I made it I used cooled chopped blanched fresh spinach, and also some herbed brie spread about 2 0z. Turned out just perfect this way.

This went over really well at my Thanksgiving.  I followed the recipe exactly, except i didn't put chopped nuts on the outside.  We all couldnt stop eating this stuff! I like it best on wheat crackers.

Made half of this recipe as written except omitted the nuts (allergy) and the other half substituting fat-free yogurt cheese for the cream cheese.  Used Knorr vegetable soup mix.  Both were very tasty.  Nice change from the more common spinach dip.  Thanks!

What a fantastic recipe. It was super easy, and a hit at my family get together. I had to give away my copy of the recipe! The crunch from the water chesnuts is amazing, and I did use fresh spinach chopped very fine. Fabulous!

This was good - guests liked it and a great twist on traditional spinach dip. It also made a cute christmas tree on the platter for my holiday party. However, I think I'll just stick to the real spinach dip when I'm wanting it.

I wanted a twist on the traditional cheese ball recipe and this was it! I thought, what an awesome way to combine two favorites (spinach dip and the cheese ball) Everyone who tried it loved it. This is a definite keeper, thanks for submitting it!

Great easy and fast recipe.  I didn't have  chestnuts, so I used pine nuts.  I  shaped this into three Christmas trees (flat, not a pyramid like in the picture - it's easier to eat that way) and used the pine nuts to make a garland.  

I have it 4 starts instead of 5 because  I still prefer the regular spinach dip.  This is a bit too rich for me.

Wow!  I love the Knorr spinach dip so wanted to give this recipe a try and I am so glad I did.  I served it at a party and it goes great with any alcoholic beverage - that was the concensus of my guests anyway!  It really is great!  Thank you for sharing!

Shaped this like a bunny for Easter along with fresh vegetables and a cracker/pretzel tray.  I thought it made a large amount.  Great with pretzels!    (wheat thins would be really good with this, too.) Thanks!

I made this for our Super Bowl party for the "Cheese Head" Packer Fans and shaped it like a football. It was so easy and was super delicious! I am making it again this week and will keep it as a staple when entertaining! A++

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful!  I took it to a New Year's party, and it was a big hit. Cheese ball and spinach dip are two of my favorite party foods, when they are combined, it is even better! I will be making this again and again.

I just made this as an appetizer for a Christmas dinner. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Loved the taste. I also shaped it like a Christmas tree and used baby carrot coins and pieces of bell peppers for "decorations." Will definitely make again!

Fantastic cheese ball!  I'm not a fan of cheese balls, but when asked to put something together, I always accept the challenge!  I added a few splashes of tabasco to add a nice little zip!  Pass the crackers puleeez!

I made a couple of modifications... used sharp cheddar, doubled the quantity of shredded cheese, and added a minced carrot with the spinach.  I made a wreath shape with a bell pepper bow and sprinkled with lots of parsley.  It was a HUGE HIT at our party!

This was just ok for me. Personally I prefer the traditional style of spinach dip.  But I do like that you can shape it into a Christmas tree!   I would make this again, more for presentation than taste.

Very good!  Easy and delicious - and I was asked for the recipe by co-workers.  That's always a good sign!  I, too shaped it in the form of a Christmas tree, put it on a red and white plate and it was really festive.

Love this recipe, esp since you can shape the Christmas tree or wreath like other reviewers noted.  I added green onions as well, and the Knorr vegetable soup mix packet.  Thanks for sharing this one!!

this was a great recipie but i only gave it three stars because it really just tasted like spinach dip . It could have been because i didnt use water chesnuts ( hate them!) and only used the walnuts to create a pic of a rattle on the top of the cheese ball( it was for a baby shower) i will try again with a few alterations !

Absolutely wonderful & delicious!  A big hit at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and pot lucks!
I follow the recipe exactly, and it turns out very well.  The recipe calls for vegetable soup mix, but vegetable dip mix works exactly the same (potAYto / potAHto...). 
As for the nuts, can you use them or not, especially if you have people in your crowd with nut allergies.  I've used multiple types of nuts, too.  (Tonight I used freshly roasted and chopped hazelnuts - can't wait!)

Very disappointing. I like the recipe on the Knorr soup mix package and the traditional spinach dip much better.  This was too firm and didn't go over well with my guests. I had lots left over and ended up throwing it away.

It was OK, and everyone loved how cute it was when I shaped it into a tree, but the taste wasn't anything spectacular. It wasn't bad, mind you; I liked it fine, but it didn't knock my socks off. It seemed like it could use some kick. Maybe I'll use more soup mix next time, or Tabasco.

This was a hit at the New Years Party I attended.  I used Lipton vegetable soup mix (the whole packet~doesn't come in .4 oz) because I was out of Knorr, but was still good.  Will definitely make again.

I formed the Cheese Ball into a Christmas Tree just like the picture as I made it for a neighborhood get together. The neighbors were impressed with the form, but not so much the taste. I thought it was just ok.

This freezes well, so all of you who think it makes too much, shape it into two balls and freeze one for next time. Great recipe! Thanks!

I made this for a small Christmas gathering.  It was good, but not great.  The other adults seemed to like it ok, but didn't think it was anything special.  I made it the day before so the flavors would have time to mix and mingle.

This tasted GREAT!  I made the cheese ball in the shape of an igloo and served it with my cream cheese penguins - it was a hit!

This recipe for the Spinich Cheese Ball is amazing. I am a huge fan of the original spinich dip, but this has a nice little twist. I made this for an appitizer at Christmas at it was a huge hit! I do have one recomendation and that is before you roll the ball in walnuts, place it in the fridge and let it get firm (It also rolls better into a ball this way too) I tried rolling it in the walnuts after all of the ingredients were mixed and it was much to soft. Next time I may try adding a little chopped green onion like the dip recipe calls for. You can't go wrong with trying this!

This is an incredible cheese ball!  You've heard the old tired line "my husband hates...(in this case spinach)...but loves this recipe"--well, my husband (and I) LOVE this recipe.  What a GREAT idea to take a wonderful dip and make into a cheese ball, Sarah!  Thanks for sharing!

Makes a nice big cheese ball.  I make it up without the nuts and let it marinate in the refrig for a couple days.  Quite tasty, but I added a dusting of cayenne pepper later and found this a little more to  my liking.

Use "Knorr Leek soup mix"
This soup makes it so good you will make yourself sick eating it !
This can be divided before adding the soup.
Mix 1/2 with the Leek soup (only use about 1/2 the pack) add other seasoning to the second 1/2 of the mixture. Italian seasoning is wonderful and if you like a Mexican slant use Taco seasoning packet...amount used of these is per your taste. Diced black olives are really good in the Taco seasoned cheese.

This was delicious. I added a little Lawry's season salt but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Yum!

It makes a beautiful presentation but you can mold almost any cheese into this shape and decorate accordingly.  What's wrong with it?  Nothing really- and that is the problem.  It was so bland and tasteless that no one wanted to eat it, even though they were initially excited by how beautiful it looked. I suggest either finding a way to flavor up this recipe or, more easily, just take a different one and mold it as this picture presents.  I used pine nuts as one type of ornament and had to purchase a small plastic star for the top because none of the yellow food items I had would hold together.  Perhaps a brick form of some yellow cheese, cut into a small star, would work?

I made this dip just as recipe showed and formed the cheese ball into a Christmas tree.  I then covered the tree with curly parsley and added nuts and roasted peppers as ornaments.  I also made the olive tuxedo penguins and placed them around the tree.  It was fun doing it and the dip was fabulous and I received a lot of compliments at my Christmas Eve party.

I made this for a Christmas gathering we had with my adult children. They though it looked so nice that they didn't want to eat it but said lets save it for my daughters baby shower which we were hosting the next day. Needless to say everyone at the shower loved it and said it looked adorable!

I made this for a picnic this past weekend. I liked the taste but I couldn't roll it into a ball so I just spread it out on a platter. Everyone enjoyed the flavor.

It was so easy and very tasty! I did add some chopped green onions also. Yes, I'd make it again.

I make this EVERY holiday shaped accordingly. I'm not a fan of water chestnuts so I omit them. Tastes great!
