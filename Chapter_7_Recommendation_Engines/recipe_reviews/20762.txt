In the PA Dutch version we simply don't use oil in the mix.  Everything else is the same, except onions are optional.  Thes rest of the dressing are measured to taste, depending on how "spicy" you like it.  We generally don't measure.  Try making it with just the vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper.  You'll have a whole new taste experience from the other side of the country.

This comes close to a slaw they serve at our favorite Mexican restaurant. Mine came out a little dizzying to look at since all I had on hand was red cabbage and yellow bell peppers! It was really bright (and pretty). It's good. (I have tried using this dressing with packaged cole slaw mix and it doesn't turn out well at all, it is limp instead of crisp.)

Like another person suggested, I just used a bag of prepared cole slaw - this took the prep time down to less than five minutes, and it was delicious!  Thanks so much for a very easy and tasty recipe - I'll make this one again and again.

This is a delightful recipe - in ALL respects.  It is so simple to make.  It can (and should) be made ahead of time.  It makes a beautiful presentation and the flavor is wonderful!  I call it California Cabbage Salad, because people have a pre-conceived idea of what cole slaw is. When taking it to a pot luck, served side-by-side with traditional slaw, you'll get so many rave reviews! Thanks, Alex!

This slaw is great. A wonderful change from mayonaise based slaws. Will keep several weeks in fridge.

Served this with Jay's Jamaican Jerk Chicken and mashed sweet potatoes for a large group. It was a huge success! I made it the night before and let it soak in the marinade, which is the way to go. Yum!

As a Spaniard I have been making this salad for over 50 years.  We always use olive oil & cider vinegar, and we never measure, we go by taste test.   If one doesn't want to add sugar (I don't), sub seasoned rice vinegar for cider and reduce the oil.  The key is that the cider vinegar gives it a nice 'bite'.  Sugar is optional.  Definitely marinate in fridge for several hours, or overnight. If made just prior to dinner, marinate at room temp for about an hour, tossing to coat several times.    It will have absorbed the marinade and still retain a little crispness.   Leftovers are great the next day.

I have made this recipe no fewer than five times.  It gets raves reviews when I take it to work for pitch in lunch.  I have only tweaked it just a bit using the same ingredients, except for red wine vinegar because it has more of a bite.  I also use the grater on the cabbage to get it into tiny pieces.  I like extra dressing so I use 1 cup red wine vinegar, 5T sugar and 1/2 cup oil.  I think the oil helps the dressing cling to the veggies.  The dressing is also great on sliced cucumbers and onions!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this recipe this morning and planning on serving it tonight with Beef on Weck (got that recipe here too) sandwiches for dinner.  Can't wait for the flavors to meld, as I taste tested it after making and it's FAB already!!!
Read tons of reviews first and this is what I did - one 16 oz. bag of slaw mix, mostly green cabbage, carrots and purple cabbage. Cut the oil in half - used EVOO, also switched out cider with LITE rice vinegar and cut way back on the sugar, maybe 1/2 teasp. - one BIG pinch.  Not a huge raw onion lover, but hubby is, so I chopped up one thick chunk of a large Vidalia and that was perfect!  Didn't have any red or green pepper on hand, so I used up 1/2 an orange one. 
Don't enjoy most mayo-based slaws I've tried before, so I know this one will be a keeper for me!

This recipe was good, but a little too much oil.  I cut the oil back by almost half the next time I made it and was much better.

Refreshing compared to traditional cole slaw, however, a little oily! I would still make it again but reduce the oil ;.)

I was very excited to see this pop up in today's recipes. I had just made a similar version the other day, from a book I edited many years ago.  I couldn't believe how delicious and fresh-tasting it was and how well it held up. My version used white vinegar, but next time I'll try it with the cider vinegar. A couple of changes that I liked: Slivered the pepper and used both red and green (or you may use poblano) and thinly sliced the carrot. I have also included red cabbage at times, but it bleeds and shouldn't be added until the end.

This is the best coleslaw I've ever had!  I'm grossed out by slaw that is creamy from mayo, so I love this simple, clean marinade.  I made this 6 hours before serving it which allowed the flavors to develop while keeping the cabbage a perfect crispness.  Really great!

All time favorite slaw. I don't like mayo, so this vinegar base was amazing. I use half the suggested oil to cut down on fat, doesn't need it. Definitely marinate overnight!

Pretty good! I accidentally bought red cabbage, but I think it came out pretty awesome. I think some of the proportions in this recipe are a little off because this definitely yields more than 6 servings. Also, I had a head of cabbage (approx 4 lbs) and it may not have been "small" enough because I only used about half of it with the rest of the portions staying the same, except a little extra carrots. I might also not use up all the dressing next time, as there was an excessive amount of liquid left over. Either way, it was still very tasty and I will definitely be making it again.

This has a nice sweet/sour flavor to it. Make it days ahead of time because the longer it sat, the better it tasted.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Love the fact it uses cider vinegar as it's my favorite. Added a teaspoon of celery seed and halved the sugar and oil. I'm not a big veggie fan, but I had to force myself to stop eating this. Thanks for sharing it.

If you prefer vinegar dressing to mayo like my family and I do, your search for the perfect cole slaw recipe ends here! Just use any type of onion, cabbage, pepper and throw in whatever other veggies you have on hand - I've added celery and apple in the past. I do cut the oil down to 1/4 cup but follow the other ingredients as written. Also tastes fine with olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Great recipe.  Very simple, quick to make.  Much more healthy than a traditional cole slaw recipe which I find to be repulsive.  I think it might taste good with some herbs in it too; perhaps some fresh parsley.

I didn't have any bell peppers, so I chopped up an unpeeled apple.  I also only had red onion, but I used it anyway.  ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS SLAW!  It's got to sit overnight for full flavor, but it's the best on pulled pork or pulled chicken sandwiches!

We have been using this recipe for quite some time, though, tonight left out the oil as it does not work well with doing Weight Watcher's. Can't believe how much better it is now, it has a much fresher taste. REALLY awesome!!!

This is a great vinegary slaw. Just don't substitute balsamic vinegar like I did unless you like it to be an icky brown color. Tasted great, though!

AWESOME!  I added about 1/4 cup finely chopped mango and 1/4 shredded red onion, along with the white onion and it has an incredible flavor.

Not overly excited about this recipe but I would definitely try it again. I loved the colorfulness of the slaw with the addition of the peppers. (I used green/red/yellow/orange!)

Superb! 
I was making "Hudson's Baked Tilapia with Dill Sauce" and needed a side dish or two...something refreshing. This recipe fit the bill perfectly! I cheated a little and bought a 1 lb. bag of prepared coleslaw (already had shredded carrots in it) and I chopped up the rest of the veggies myself. For the marinade, I mixed all the ingredients in a separate cup and then poured it into the salad bowl with the veggies and tossed the salad making sure everything was nice and wet. I refrigerated it for about 4 hours. It went excellent with the fish! A very refreshing and tasty coleslaw! I will be making this a lot in the upcoming summer months.

Wow. This is fantastic. I used a store package of broccoli slaw mix instead of a head of cabbage. I tested this recipe just in time for grill season--my boyfriend and I will be eating this all summer!

Wow! This was my first time making cole slaw in many years and it was so great!!!  I only tasted it after it sat overnight and my dinner wasn't finished yet.  I had a hard time stopping myself from filling up on it.  I thought this recipe rocked!  I didn't have bell pepper and I used white vinegar, cut the oil down to 1/4 cup like others suggested and  it was so yummy.  I think it's a very versatile recipe.

Very easy to make and turns out great.  It is much better after it marinates overnight, and I drained off excess liquid before I served.  Makes a great easy filler for wraps!

I will admit, I didn't follow this recipe to the letter!  I was in the mood for coleslaw one evening, and I needed a recipe that was not mayonnaise based.  I took the liberty of using 1/2 cup of rice vinegar and 1/4 cup sesame oil instead of the vinegar and oil used in the recipe (what can I say...I'm Filipino, and these are what I had handy!)  Instead of chopping my bell peppers, I sliced them thinly.  I used red onion instead of white, because it's what I had handy.  It turned out great...even my husband went for seconds, and he is a bit picky!  Please remember, I made changes to the recipe without trying the original.  However, the original recipe did serve as a springboard to making coleslaw with what I had handy.

Super easy for quick prep slaw. I agree with the other users that it is way better sitting after a day. But it is almost as delicious that same day! Will be making this again.

Nice, simple, and not the average dish of mayo-based coleslaw! Like so many others, I halved the oil. I also added sunflower seeds for an extra subtle flavor.

Super slaw.  Used one purchased bag of shredded cabbage, sixteen ounces, two small yellow peppers, a bulk-purchase bargain at the local supermarket, and a tiny bit less oil.  When first mixed - and tasted - I had reservations.  The vinegar seemed really strong.  But by dinnertime, this was great and I'm glad I resisted the urge to add a bit more sugar.  Lots of 'juice' at the bottom of the bowl the second day, but this didn't seem to affect the flavor or texture of the slaw.  Will make again fer sure.

This was so easy!  I substituted an yellow pepper for the green pepper and rice wine vinegar for the cider vinegar.  It is less sharp. It was colorful and tasty.  Everyone loved it!

I can't get enough of this.  I have taken it to several potlucks and always get asked for the recipe.  I make it in a gallon-size freezer bag, squeeze the air out for maximum marinade and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  I work from home a few days a week and I love having a batch on hand.  I eat it with my sandwich instead of chips!  I don't use all the oil.  I put about 2 TBSP oil in the bottom of my 1/2 cup measuring cup and fill it the rest of the way with water.

This is great for taking to a gathering. Received lots of compliments and none left at the end. Great for leaving in the fridge as a handy, healthy snack. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added a yellow pepper. Everything else stayed the same.  Thanks so much ALEXPE!

Very tasty!  Rather than cut up all the cabbage and such, I just bought 2 bags of the Dole Coleslaw blend, and added the remaining ingredients.

I was short on time so I threw all the ingredients in the food processor.  It made it a very even consistency and saved me a few extra minutes.  It was a very pretty dish for my bbq and my friends loved it.  It still tastes great a few days later so I will definitely be making this dish again.

I liked it, I'll make it again.  It would be a really good side with BBQ.  Little spicy, little sweet. It could be a bit more spicy for me, I think I'll add a dash of hot sauce next time for an extra kick.

I had a small bag of premade cole slaw- minus the sauce-that I wanted to use.  The recipe on the back of the bag for the "sauce" sounded really bad, so I visited this site.  I made this recipe minus the peppers and onions because I didn't have them and just used the cabbage and shredded carrots in my cole slaw mix.  I allowed it to marinate overnight as suggested. I was going to have it as a side for tuna sandiwiches, but ended up using it as a topping on the sandwiches. It was REALLY Good!  My 4 1/2 year old even liked it!  It reminded me of having a sub shop sandwich-YUM!

I had two heads (on red) of cabbage for a dish I ended up never getting around to so I was frantically looking for ideas to use my surplus. This recipe is easy. Simple to follow and actually wasn't too time intensive I regards to chopping. I made a few minor adjustments  I thought would suit my tastes:

--The addition of red cabbage.

--Substitution of onion with shallot (I love onion and shallot but for this dish the milder the better IMO).

--Added golden raisins ( I could also see either  walnuts pecans edamame even pineapple as complementary ) .

--I used the juice from half a lemon sprinkles independently and prior to marinade.

--Lastly (and I know it's a bad one but I couldn't help myself) I substituted most of the oil (still added a tablespoon or two olive oil) with about 3 tablespoon regular creamy mayo.

While the veggies sat in the bowel absorbing the lemon I whisked together the marinade then combined it all together. 

it hasn't been the recommended 24hr marinating time but I will say from the taste of the marinade alone my out loud reaction was "Wow! That is good!" I did taste a little of the combined dish which also was very tasty.. Again , go mild on the onion .

A nice change from mayo-based slaw. Not too sweet or sour. Enjoyed its flavor on the first day. Can't wait to try it on the second day.

This recipe is delicious! I've made it on a few occasions, mostly for BBQs.  Not only is it delicious on its own, but it pairs well with BBQ pork or brisket.  It's light and colorful and tastes wonderful.

This was yummy and I just made it.  Will see after marinating.  I didn't have cider vinegar so used 1/4 wine and 1/4 rice.  Added some red paper flakes, dash of hot sauce and 1/4 tsp. of Adobe Criollo seasoning to spice it up.

I used a 16 oz. package of shredded cabbage with carrots and red cabbage and then followed the recipe for the dressing.  The slaw was refrigerated for about an hour and we had it for dinner.  It was delicious and as stated by others it was even better a day or two later.  Thanks, this is a great change from a creamy dressing.

This was okay. Not great. I used one very small head of cabbage and still had to double the marinade to make it have flavor. I don't think I'll make it again as it needs too much doctoring. sorry!

My Hubby doesn't eat mayo, so this is perfect.  I recommend keeping the ratio of marinade ingredients or the vinegar will be too strong.  I made this the night before and it was good right after I made it, but excellent after marinating overnight.

Great recipe.  I used a 16 oz bag of coleslaw mix in place of cabbage and carrots.  I also only used 1/4 cup of oil.  Best if allowed to marinate in refrigerator overnight.  Great with BBQ.

I didn't care for this slaw. It needed another flavor to balance out the vinegar. It just wasn't bold enough for me.

I used packaged cole slaw mix that already had carrots and purple cabbage in it, so just added some finely diced onion.  I used more sugar, and less oil.  Also added freshly chopped mint for a twist on the usual cole slaw taste.  I wasn't able to marinate this overnight - only a couple of hours - and the result was still quite tasty.

I've made this salad twice in the last 2 weeks and both times it's really yummy!  It keeps for a while in the fridge and does really taste better over time.  I actually used red cabbage the first time and the 2nd time i used both red and green cabbage.  Will be a regular side dish for us!

This is a GREAT slaw!   Didn't have time to let it sit overnight in the fridge, but it was still very tasty!  Really hit the spot... even with the husband who is not a big salad fan!  I served it with Deborah Westbrook's "Cheesy Catfish" that I put on the grill for a WONDERFUL, cool dinner on a 90 degree Seattle day! I had the leftovers for lunch the next day and they were great!  Thanks, Alex!

Absolutely delicious slaw!  Just a bit too oily and sweet as written.  An 8th cup of oil was plenty and I reduced sugar/stevia as well.  Really good stuff!

What a beautiful and colorful coleslaw, and it taste great, too!  I mixed this up in the morning and we had it 12 hours later.  It was very well blended and we enjoyed it with 'California Tortilla Pizzas' from AR.  I used 2 TB sugar and 1/4 cup of oil and that was perfect for us.  My salt was Lawry's® Seasoned salt-free as we are watching our sodium intake.  This slaw has wonderful flavoring and with all the colors it makes a great presentation.

So easy and so yummy! I did all the prep work and put everything in a ziploc bac and made the dressing and then just added the dressing the next day to marinate for a few hours.  Perfect balance of flavors and colors and went terrific with the BBQ and didn't have to worry about spoilage!

Loved this! So fresh tasting. Course having all organic ingredients from a nearby farm helped, I'm sure. Only difference is that I used a red onion instead of a white one. I also used a food processor for the cabbage and carrot and they ended up a little more minced than I would have liked.

I love sour cole-slaws like this one. The ingredients are great and I enjoy its crunchiness. I always add a bit more red vinegar, but only because I like it so sour. The celery seed makes it so fantastic however; it cannot be substituted. This is perfect for picnics and even just making a large batch to snack on all week.

I've made this recipe many times.  People seem to really enjoy a vinegar based coleslaw, especially when you don't know how long it'll be sitting out.  Instead of using a green pepper, I usually will sliver up a yellow (or even orange) peppper.  It contrasts nicely with the red pepper and the orange of the carrots in the bag of coleslaw mix that I use instead of shredding my cabbage and shredding my carrots.  I also sometimes add extra pre-shredded carrots from the produce section.  I know - cheating and more expensive, but what a timesaver!  I also tend to sliver the onion instead of chop it up.  It's a very easy recipe to make.  The longer it sits, the better it tastes.

This cole slaw is good. I let it marinate over night and tasted more like pickled slaw. It is quick and easy to make. Great for a hot day.

I made this with shredded red cabbage and used white vinegar because I had it on hand. I also eliminated the salt because of restricted diet. It is fantastic! We're really enjoying it.

We just didn't care for this, too oily and too much vinegar for our taste, also not enough spice.  I will make this again with only 2 tablespoons of vinegar, mayonnaise instead of oil, add garlic powder, onion powder, and celery seed.

Great receipt and easy! I did make a few changes: no green peppers and only one tablespoon of oil. I used chopped celery instead of green pepper.  Fun bright and hit with my adorable but picky wife.

8.1.19 We like all types of coleslaw, and I was looking for a non-mayo one today.  Rarely buy green bell peppers anymore, so I did sub a yellow bell pepper, otherwise, followed the recipe.  Good, but just a bit too much oil for us; would reduce the oil by half if I make again.  Quick and easy, into the fridge in the morning for an evening meal.

This recipe was fantastic! I used shredded angle hair cabbage and used a food processor to shred 1 (extremely) large carrot. Substituted avocado oil for vegetable oil, and used two packets of Truvia instead of sugar. It turned out terrific.

For time saving I used a bag of slaw mix with carrots.  Marinating overnight is definitely the key.  It especially gives  the peppers a chance to absorb the marinade and soften them.  This is a keeper for those who prefer a vinegar/cider slaw over a creamy white dressing.

This was good and I will make it again.  It's really simple and a great way to eat your veggies.  Next time I will cut the bell peppers in to strips instead of dicing them, and I will add a touch less vinegar.  It doesn't need all the oil, you can easily halve the oil.  It would be great with purple cabbage too!

LOVED this slaw! I cut way back on the oil, then used EVOO and  dash of sesame oil. Subbed Stevia for sugar and used sea salt for a healthful side dish since we're watching calories. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Pretty good, although I thought it was a bit greasy.  If I make this again, I'd cut back on the oil I think.  Very pretty, however, it loses some of it's vibrant color when it sits overnight.

A terrific slaw and great option for those with dietary restrictions (dairy, eggs, etc.). I also was able to substitute 2 packages of stevia for the sugar with great results.

Sorry, not to my taste:
1)This is the 1st time I tried Cidar Vinegar & I dont like it- the smell + the flavour is not to my liking. I'll stick with Distilled White Vinigar.
2) I think the oil is too much so I left it out the 2nd time around.
3)I find that salt + vinegar is a no-no with our taste buds so also left it out the 2nd time around.
4)So that leaves me with just vinegar (white) & sugar - it's ok with these two- just sweeten to taste.

A fabulous and flexible cole slaw recipe.  Particularly good for all those folks out there who dislike the mayonnaise based cole slaws which are so prevalent.  Try with purple cabbage for a pretty flair!

I used a bag of broccoli slaw mix, added chopped red onions and green bell pepper.
I like it a little bit spicy so I added dash of red pepper flakes as well.
It was light, tangy and delicious.

It was just okay. I made this because my husband doesn't like mayo-based cole slaw. This was no better. It tasted too much like relish to him. He's right. That's kind of what it tastes like.

We really love this!  I was looking for a mayo-free slaw and this is perfect.  Very light and fresh and summery.  I halved the oil, as suggested by others.  In an effort to be health-conscious, I also left out the salt and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Then I threw in several dashes of hot sauce for some spice. Yumdeli-icious!

I loved this cole slaw, much better than a sugary, heavy, mayo-based sauce. I made the sauce almost as written, cutting down a teeny bit on the oil and sugar, and just using a sprinkling of salt and pepper - I'm trying to cut back on salt and I really think the sauce stands well on its own without it. I omitted the onions and peppers as we don't like them raw, and added broccoli, extra carrots, turkey and peanuts (I made the sauce recipe 1 & 1/2 times to cover the extra stuff I added). I really enjoyed this recipe and will absolutely make it again - it's a perfect warm-weather meal, and I even got my kids to eat it!

Served with grilled BBQ pork.  Nice addition in sandwich, but lacked 'something' as a sidedish:  Bland/boring.  Only drizzled 1-1.5 T of oil into it, and that was about right for me/guests.  If I'd added more oil...it would've become the dominant flavour (instead of an enhancement).

Made recipe as a salad to accompany baked whitefish. My company loved the salad and asked for the recipe. Since I had only a small head of cabbage, I used only 1/2 green pepper and red pepper. And, instead of grating carrot, I just cut it into a small dice. Also, decreased oil/vinegar a bit. Absolutely delicious and will make again.

This was a nice change from the mayo based coleslaws. It did taste better the longer it sat. Next time, I might try some different oils in the mixture.. sesame or walnut, perhaps?

I was looking for a non mayo-based slaw  since I was bringing it to a New Year's Eve party and I didn't know how long it would be sitting out. My husband made a beef brisket. It was delicious! I used a bag of coleslaw and added a shredded carrot. I only used one red pepper.

The recipe I found years ago uses white pepper and olive oil.  I have used vegetable oil and like the taste of olive oil better.  I sometimes use red cabbage or add garlic.  This is always a hit at potlucks and BBQs

Used the food processor and it did look very nice with all of the colours. I found it a little onion heavy. It was absolutely better the next day. This is nothing like creamy coleslaw, we thought it tasted much more fresh. For health reasons, we used good EVOO instead of vegetable oil. Against my better judgement, I added the sugar. I found it far too sweet and could have gone without it. Or at very least use a small squeeze of honey instead. I enjoyed trying this.

Very good and a welcome change from a mayo based dressing. I used Splenda instead of sugar and will need to cut it back quite a bit the next time, and since I'm kinda lazy, a bag of pre-cut slaw mix worked like a charm. Thanks for the recipe - we'll have it again soon.

This is awesome!  Maybe a little weird but I used a normal head of green cabbage and chopped about half of it up.  I also peeled and hand shredded the carrots.  The dressing might be a tad bit sweet but has lots of good flavor and a nice tang (I am a huge fan of vinegar).  I think next time I will add some Dijon mustard to the dressing.

Good recipe for someone who likes peppers, I do not like peppers so I did not care for it much. My sister and my mom loved it (they love peppers)  but my sister said it needed to be sweeter. The dressing is good! I like it having no mayo. If you like peppers it is a must! If you don't like peppers, don't try it.

This is an excellent salad. I had doubts at first because I don't care for cider vinegar, but this was very good.

I used honey instead of sugar and did not add peppers because my son has a food sensitivity to them.  The way I made it, it was good, not spectacular, but very good.  May be more spectacular with the peppers.  My kids really liked this slaw and I will definately make it again.

We thought this was just OK--not bad, but not great. It just wasn't very interesting. It needs something to add some depth, but I'm not sure what. Some fresh herbs might help. Thanks, anyway.

Loved this added a bit more organic carrots and raisins, added some broccoli heads and used apple cider vinegar. Used mixed cabbage instead of cutting my own. I like the red cabbage. Did marinate over nite. Was a big hit at the BBQ. And will be making again for the next one this week.

I made this recipe with the following changes and it came out perfect: I used one small head of cabbage and one small head of red cabbage; I omitted the red pepper since I didn't have one; and I only used 3/4 cup canola oil. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again.

I just used coleslaw mix and chopped spanish onions.  This is great alternative to the traditional mayo coleslaw.

This was pretty good...I used 2 16 oz. bags of pre-shredded cole slaw mix....it was a light version in contrast to the typical mayo recipe.  I really enjoyed it...used it on pulled pork sandwiches.  Will made it again for sure.

Love it. It's light and tangy.Much better if it is made a few hours earlier than when you plan to eat it.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I used napa cabbage instead and added some shredded jicama.  YUMMO.  This slaw really counter balanced my William Sonoma potato salad and bbq ribs recipe very well.  DH has requested this to be a keeper.

I've been looking for a summer slaw recipe without mayo, and this recipe provided the inspiration I needed.  My modifications were: no green pepper (I don't do peppers) and added cucumber instead and decreased oil by half.  It turned out YUMMY.  I will certainly be using this recipe whenever I am in need of a good slaw.

Nice and easy...  I used apple vinegar, a bit less sugar and no oil.  Then decided to add a touch of mayo. However then I felt the flavour was lacking (!!) so added a couple of spoons of raspberry jam.  THIS was great!! Added the sweetness and a fruitness that in my opinion, the coleslaw needed.

I made this 3 days ahead of time as suggested.  When we tasted the salad it was awful!  Had very little taste...except was oily even tho I reduced the amount of oil as had been suggested.  I was going to throw it out and then decided to add some mayonnaise.  This helped, but was still embarassed to serve to our guests.
