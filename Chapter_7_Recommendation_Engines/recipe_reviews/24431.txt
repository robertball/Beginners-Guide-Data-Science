This cookie is sooo good, the first time I made this, I made it with 2 other recipes from here and EVERYONE chose this one as the best one. I have been making it ever since and get great reviews from it. It works great in a cookie bouquet, I have even had someone tell me that these were better than the Cookie by design cookies ( I think so too). I haven't tried the frosting recipe though because I already have a special frosting I use but these cookies are to die for.
One thing to keep in mind when making these cookies is using the right amount of flour. If you use your flour after you have fluffed it up then it won't be enough, but if you pack it in the cup it will be too much, put just enough into your measuring cup.
Thank You so much for these fantastic cookies!!

This is absolutely the best sugar cookie recipe I had ever made! I did make a few changes in the recipe. I used real butter and used 3 sticks and only 1/4 cup of shortening. Over the time I have tested cookie recipes I have discovered when you have baking powder in recipe change it to cream of tarter. I am telling you this makes the cookies. Also, if you soften your butter on the counter verses in microwave your cookies are much softer and fluffier! I also used vanilla verses lemon. Will try lemon next time.. I love love love this cookie recipe!!!

This recipe is so yummy!  All of my friends have asked for it!  I love the hint of lemon, and even added a bit more in the icing for extra flavour.  These didn't last long in our house!

This is the only sugar cookie recipe i use.  I decorate to order and these keep my customers coming back for more.  Tender cookie that is not too sweet.  I add lemon zest for a "fresher" taste.

I chose this recipe for 2 reasons.  1) the use of both shortening and butter along with both white and confectioners sugar was intriguing.  2) the name of the recipe was my name too!  I REALLY liked these sugar cookies.  I made them with vanilla instead of lemon juice because I wasn't looking for a lemon flavor for Christmas cookies.  They were very yummy, even without icing.  Or should I say, especially without icing.  I found them to be a dense cookie instead of what folks might call light, which I really liked.  They had a good crunch and wonderful flavor.  When baked, they held the cookie shape very well.  I made the dough early to fit my schedule and put it in the fridge for several hours only because I wasn't ready to cut and cook when I prepared the dough.  I found that it took warming the dough by simply playing with it a little bit before I could easily roll it for cutting.  I will make these again and again and for no special occasion. Although Santa will be getting them from now on!! I look forward to trying the lemon juice.

I would give this recipe like a 4.8 if I could, if only because I was hoping the lemon flavor would be more prevalent.  That said, I took these to a family party over the weekend and had multiple people say they love them and ask for the recipe.  Next time I make them (and there will be a next time!), I'm either going to add a little lemon extract or more lemon juice and just aim for the right dough consistency when adding the flour.  Great recipe, though!

This recipe is like the one I had many years ago.  I use butter instead of margarine.  I have also used almond extract for a change of pace. I never or almost never make shaped cookies so the softness of the dough is not a problem.  I do however us an ice cream scoop to place them on the cookie sheet, a flat bottom glass which has been dipped in a sugar and cinnamon mixture to flatten out the cookie to my desired thickness and size. I have refrig my dough between batches to keep the dough from becoming too soft. These cookies could best be described as a butter cookie (not overly sweet without the icing) and an addictive one at that!

Okay, so to be clear, I am an experienced baker of breads, cookies, brownies and all things yummy. I do it at least twice or three times a month, so I know my way around a cookie recipe. I followed this one to the letter, and they have yet to be finished. First, this cookie dough is waaaay too soft and sticky to be rolled immediately after making. As it stands, it needs to be refrigerated at least overnight... mine's in the freezer at the moment to firm it up because I don't have 12 hours before the party I hope to serve them at. As for the taste.. well, the dough is delicious. So, for all those hoping to make them for an event, keep in mind they should be made the day before and chilled to keep them from being too sticky to use.

Another option, which I may try today, is to roll them out between two sheets of waxed paper. Good luck to everyone else, but so far this one is bust.

Used gluten free flour (from Costco) and butter in place of margarine. Turned out great. Will note, if dough is too sticky to roll, put in fridge for a while AND I rolled it in between parchment paper coated with confectioners sugar.  Cookies will puff up during baking so be sure to give them space in between.  I also used parchment paper on cookie sheets.  Do allow to cool at least 10 minutes or may flake apart (may be due to gluten free flour).

Easy to roll out and tasty.  They did puff up a bit, muddling the cut shape.  Next time I'll use less baking soda. Also, I'm sure the "lemon juice" should be lemon extract. That gave it a nice lemon taste.

I substituted vanilla for the lemon, and it came out tasting great! but the dough was way too sticky for a simple dusting of flour, I had to heavily flour my pastry mat in order to keep it from absorbing all the flour while being rolled out. 

I might increase the flour next time.

Followed the recipe exactly and the cookies are delicious!  Soft on the inside. They need some TLC after rolling and cutting to get them to the cookie sheet but I will only be making these sugar cookies in the future. It took me one hour from start to the last tray coming out of the oven.

Very tasty lemon sugar cookie.  I added a little extra lemon juice, just because my family loves it.  Plan to give as Christmas gifts.

The cookies were good, but the dough was very soft, so the cookies did not hold their shape after being cut. I'd recommend chilling the dough before trying to use cookie cutters (I ended up making all of mine into balls then squishing them into circles)

This makes good soft cookies for cutting out and the icing is not too sweet. I think they have a nice flavor. The lemon is not noticeable which is fine because that wasn't what I was going for. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the dough is delicate and I had to use a flat knife to pick them up off the counter and keep them from falling apart. That worked fine.

these have a great texture. I used butter and butter flavored crisco.  I didn't use the lemon juice but would try them in the future using lemon extract.  I found this to be a very delicate dough to work with both cutting out and after baking.  A few of my snowflake cutouts fell apart once baked and the stars and trees seemed to be sturdier.  I used almond and vanilla.  Great texture with all kinds of possibilities for flavorings.  Nice and soft but again, a bit delicate.

The dough was a little soft to work with, even after refridgeration so i had to add a little extra flour, but other than that it was great. I acutally used half vanilla extract and half almond extract instead of the lemon juice.
