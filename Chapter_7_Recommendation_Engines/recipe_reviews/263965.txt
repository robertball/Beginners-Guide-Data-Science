This was a nice meal, but I did have to add some butter to the wine sauce to make it a little thicker.  The only thing I did differently from the instructions was to leave out the black olives, an ingredient I don't usually have on hand.  I should have used my green stuffed olives.  I chose to put this over capellini rather than the suggested couscous.  Be sure not to overcook the chicken.  Mine cooked quickly, and I had to remove it to finish off the sauce.  This is a nice meal that was satisfying.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this tonight and threw in some angel hair pasta, and it was pretty much exactly what I wanted it to be.

Great flavor, tender chicken! Though, I will use fresh mushrooms of any variety next time, rather than canned mushrooms.

I used fresh sliced mushrooms and pitted Kalamata olives, and served it with angel hair pasta. It was delicious!
