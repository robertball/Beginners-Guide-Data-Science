I substituted the  steak with pinto beans. But I used the  carne asada seasoning and garlic powder on the pinto beans. Because I used pinto beans I had made and frozen they were slightly dry. I put the seasoned beans and Hunt'sÂ® Diced Tomatoes in my food processor and pulsed just enough that the tomatoes and beans were mixed together. 
 I would never have thought of using  tomatoes in a breakfast  burrito but they really added great flavor.  My husband and I really liked this recipe and will be adding it to our collection.

OK!  I made a couple of changes.  I used chorizo rather than the meat and hash browns rather than diced potatoes.  I did only use one egg for the half recipe I made, but otherwise I made this according to the recipe.  This made for a very delicious dinner tonight, and we would for sure make it again!  Thank you so much for this very forgiving recipe!  I love it when you can use the basic ingredients and then change it for what you have on hand!

Truly delicious!! I knew these were going to be addictive, and they are. I used pinto beans instead of potatoes. The flavor just bursts in each bite. I added extra onion, jalapeno, bell pepper and Hunt's tomatoes and put some of it in a dish for dipping the burritos. It was like a salsa and I wanted more. I didn't brush the finished burritos with butter though. I used blue corn tortillas instead of flour. Thank you for the recipe.

Really good. We made these for dinner and left out the eggs.
