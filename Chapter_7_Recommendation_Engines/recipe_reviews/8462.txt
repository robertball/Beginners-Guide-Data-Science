This is one of my most favorite recipes, but I do change it a little to make it quicker and simpler.  The only thing I keep the same is the marshmallows, strawberries, and Jello.  Skip all the rest of the ingredients and use a box of Duncan Hines yellow cake mix and prepare it like it says on the box for a 9x13 cake.  Pour the prepared batter over the marshmallows, then the strawberry mixture on top of the batter and bake like it says on the box.  Test it with a toothpick taking care to avoid the marshmallows that rose to the top.  Leave it in the pan and cut serving pieces from there.

We all love this recipe.   Most of the time I make it exactly as written, but the last time I decided to shortcut the shortcut cake and I used a box yellow cake mix.  Blah!  Didn't like it at all that way.  So in my opinion it's WAY better to make it as written.   YUM!  Thanks.

This was a good cake. Very tasty and moist. I had to cook it a little longer. Top with cool whip. I also used fresh strawberries, just added a little sugar.

I made some changes to this recipe.  I used fresh berries, not frozen.   My other changes were in the interests of making it healthier.   I used white whole wheat flour, not all purpose.   I used only one egg and 1/3 cup egg whites instead of three.   I used fat free vanilla yogurt instead of shortening.   Of course the milk was fat free and my the jello was the sugar free stuff.   Barring tonight, I had not had this dessert in over 25 years, but even making it a healthier lighter version, I still see why it was my favorite.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I still have the original recipe torn from a PILLSBURY flour bag about 50 years ago.

My frozen strawberries were whole so I gave them a quick rinse (to knock the ice crystals off) & sliced them in the food processor. Then I  sprinkled them w/ a little sugar & let them sit in the food processor until thawed. I took Jane's suggestion to make it easier & used a white, boxed cake mix. After baking, the strawberries were at the bottom of the cake (w/ quite a bit of juice, which may put off some people, but we liked it) & the marshmallows had risen to the top & melted, creating a marshmallowy crust. Yummm! I drizzed a pool of strawberry puree (the kind you use in mixed drinks) onto a plate, added the cake & topped it w/ a dollop of whipped cream & a fanned-out strawberry. Thanks for the recipe Maureen!

I had lots of strawberries left over and tried this using the cake mix hint from the previous review (Thanks!!!).  My only difference was that I did not have frozen strawberry so I mixed one box of jello with 1/2 c boiling water and 1/2 c cold water-then added that to sliced strawberries.  Prepared and baked as directed then topped with cool whip.  I cannot tell you how much a hit this was!!   Adults and kids alike all enjoyed this--tasted better than any strawberry shortcake!!

Wow! This is so great!  I had this recipe years ago and "loaned" this recipe to a friend and never got it back.  I used to make this all the time and when it's cold it's even better tasting!  Thank you so much!

Made this for Easter - it was a hit!  Everyone wanted seconds.  Sort of had a strawberry/rhubarb taste to it - delicious.

Personally, I didn't like this cake, and my daughter didn't either.  I made it for my boss birthday, hope I don't get fired.  I'll find out if she liked it, but she'll probably lie and say yes.  I added everything just like the recipe says and it didn't work.  That or I'm just not a strawberry fan.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly. TIP: make sure your strawberries are completely thawed, even microwave them until they are luke warm. It will blend so much better while baking this way....I discovered by trial and error. :)

this was very good. especially if you want a break from store bought shortcakes. I did just like jane did and made it easy by doing a cake mix. It turned out really moist, so make sure you add enough gelatin to the mix of strawberries.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday party.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  In fact, someone made it this week-end for a Mother's Day
dessert.

It was delicious, but my first one fell apart when I tried to flip it to put on a cake board. The second cake I made, I just left it in the pan and served it that way!! Definitely making this again!!

I LOVED this! It definitely does have a bit of a rhubarb taste as somebody else mentioned. I made it pretty much exactly as written, though I did have to use some substitutes to work with my daughter's allergies (Ener-G egg replacer and soy milk). My daughter who has food allergies said it is her favorite.

We were so pleased with this absolutely delicious cake recipe! My son loves strawberries and he actually picked this recipe out to try for his 11th birthday!  Can you believe how easy it is to make? My children made it while I was attending my crochet club... ;)
