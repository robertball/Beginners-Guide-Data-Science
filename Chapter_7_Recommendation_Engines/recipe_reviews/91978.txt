Great recipe!  I did add my own spin to it, I took the onion and 1/3 cup mayo and added in 1 tbsp. dijon mustard, I blended these in the food processor. When the mixture was smooth, I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper and garlic.Then I smeared the onion mixture on the fish. I topped the fish with crushed corn flake crumbs.  Baked it for 25 minutes and it was divine!  Very moist!

Oh how wonderful!!!  I also like the fact that this is not breaded, fried, or flour-battered!  Sure saves on calories.  I only had catfish 'nuggets' that are just odds and ends pieces of catfish.  I also had some honey-orange dijon mustard that just was fabulous with this.  Such few ingredients make this so simple and the flavors blend so nicely.  I love garlic but I stuck with the amt. specified in the recipe because I didn't want to overpower the other flavors.  It was perfect.  I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.  It also is a very inexpensive dish to make and can be made in a jiffy with no grease-splattered stove to clean up afterwards.  Thanks so much!  I served this with orange rice and garlic broccoli also from this site.  A wonderful meal.

This was a truly fabulous meal. Definitely liked the non-fried aspect of it. I substituted dried parsley flakes for dried oregano and it was still yummy. Also paired it with the 'Sweet and Nutty Moroccan Couscous', whose sweetness perfectly complemented the tangy flavor of this dish.

My husband loves fish, so I tried this recipe for something different.  It was really easy, used on-hand ingredients and really tasted good.  I'm not a fish fan particularly, but I even ate the leftovers the next day for lunch.  We'll definately make it again.

I'm not usually so harsh on the new recipes I try -- trying to give them all SOME redeeming value -- but this was disgusting. It might be saved by cooking the onions first but the onion was so overpower that this was a wasted dish for us.

Delicious!!  I was looking for something different to make in seafood, and this was it, the flavors were very good together.  The only thing I added to the mustard and onions, was about 1 tsp of minced garlic.  It's a winner, my husband and son loved it!  It will be a regular for our Lenten meals!

I scaled it down 2 servings. Since I read reviews that indicated the onion overpowered the flavors, I halved the onion and used a little more dijon mustard. It was really, really good and I'm disappointed I don't have any leftovers to heat up today. :)  My hubby was skeptical since he does not like catfish but he tasted it and was pleasantly surprised.    I think adding a little honey dijon, as well.

These flavors did not match well for me.  Too much onion and the honey dijon clashed with the onion.

I picked up some Swai fish and tried this recipe on it. 
I was glad I took the advice of others and cut back on the onion.  The reduced amount I used was plenty.
It was a little too mustardy for my taste, but I'll make it again, cutting back a little on the mustard.

I love the recipe, it can be used on chicken, salmon, catfish or mackrel, and it is soooo easy, the only thing I changed was a stopped using the onion and added garlic, but I use this recipe probably once every 2 weeks, my husband loves it!

This was really good, however the onions were too sharp. Maybe I didn't chop them finely enough, but next time I will caramelize them for 10 mins or so before making the marinade & baking the fish. Thanks for this recipe!

This was a simple and delicious fish recipe.  I put the onion as well as a clove of garlic in the food processor to make it more of a paste and then also added about a tbsp of mayo to the mustard mixture.  Substitute catfish with tilapia or even chicken and this would taste just as good.

This was a delicious, light meal served with green beans.  I didn't have the dried parsley flakes so I used some oregano, and also made sure to use freshly ground black pepper. They're a nice alternative to fried catfish and my husband ate them all up!

This is okay. My family eats a lot of fish. We try to stay away from red meat, so we're always looking for new fish/shrimp/chicken recipes. We've added this to our list for variety, but it isn't the best catfish we've ever had. This simply decent.

I loved this recipe! I changed a few things though...I used shallots instead of onions because the flavor is more mild, added a few chopped cloves od garlic, and I also used a course dijon mustard paired with some chicken stock. When there was about 5 min left to bake I topped the dish with dill weed. YUMMY!!!

I thought this was excellent. I didn't have honey mustard so I made my own by combining dijon with honey. I'll definitely make this again.

Admitedly, I'm not the biggest seafood fan, however I need it once in a while to feel as though i'm eating right.This was easy,and it tasted fabulous. I definately will use this recipe again,and I'm of the "I dont know what i'm doing school of thought" so I follow recipes to the letter. This one is perfect as is.

Like others, I cut back on the onion, but the recipe still didn't impress us  unfortunately. I think it might work better with tilapia. Thanks anyway.

I was a little concerned when I noticed that the 4 star rating was a combination of 5 star and 1 star reviews only, but everything worked out just fine. Got good reviews from my family at well! The only complaints were that it was slightly soggy (maybe should have broiled another few minutes?) and that the coating didn't stick to the underside.

I thought this was pretty good... It is really hard to bake catfish and make it as good as fried fish. Anyway I just wish it was crispier, but good for a non fried fish, i think it could have used something else on it too... maybe something to spice it up like cayenne. But over all it is good written as is.

My husband loved it, but I found the onions a bit overwhelming.  Hence the compromised rating.  But you can't beat it's ease and simplicity in preparation !

This recipe was fabulous!  I don't know how that one person who talked in their review about all the onions meant what she said.  I couldn't believe that I didn't taste the onions at all!  I did use a 1/4 cup of honey mustard dressing.  The finished product certainly looked very appetizing and it was! I definitely will make this again.  I wasn't even sure I liked catfish, but I knew my husband did.  He loved it too!  Thanks!

This recipe was great. I used Tialpia because i am not a Catfish fan. I did not use a whole onion. I did not have garlic salt, but i used some garlic power. I loved it. The honey dijon mustard tasted really good with the fish. My husband had seconds.

I wasn't wild about the flavor combo here, but my fiance liked it. Definitely buzz the onions in a food processor (I have a small 2 cup one that was just right for the job) and then add the mustard to that and buzz to combine. That way you don't wind up with bigger hunks of raw onion.

Very tasty. I did increase the amount of seasonings since I like highly seasoned food. Did not have honey dijon, only regular dijon and so added a little honey to recipe. Wil definitely make it again.

My wife loves seafood, so I'm always looking for new recipes to prepare for her.  She thought this was great.  I did change it a bit, used nuggets instead of fillets, mixed mayo with the mustard and seasoning to coat the fish and then sprinkled crushed potato chips to give it a bit of a crunch.

This was very good for being so simple and so fast to prepare. I made my own honey Dijon with approx 1 part honey to 3 parts Dijon. I also cooked it on the Bar BQ by cooking it on a piece of double think foil for about 15 min. Fantastic!

This recipe was Good.  It was easy and hands off, which is always a plus.  I sautéed the onions with fresh garlic prior to mixing with the mustard.

This was my least favourite meal. HOWEVER. I have never eaten non-fried catfish. The taste of the catfish was strong and even though I'm not a picky eater and grossed out by practically nothing, I could not swallow this. I would love to try this recipe with another type of fish.

The mustard and onion flavors were way too overpowering in this recipe. Next time I will use sweet onion instead of yellow onion and add some mayo to cut back on the mustard flavor. I see the potential in this one so I won't give up on it!

Great Sauce.  Excellent fish to include in wraps with plenty of greens and extra sauce and/or other dressing.  For those who want to avoid a strong onion taste, simply mince relatively fine AND MAKE THE SAUCE AHEAD OF TIME - THIS TURNS THE SAUCE INTO A LOVELY RELISH, GREAT FOR DIPPING.  That said, I love onions anyway, but if this sauce is made ahead of time, it will sit well with those who love onions and those who do not.  Used garlic powder instead of salt since mustard, even honey mustard, has a lot of salt in it. If making for wraps, might simply cook fish, possibly with sauce, in skillet in the future. Mixed honey into brown mustard and yellow mustard (since we ran out of brown mustard).  When we were testing our wraps straight off the skillet, we tried dipping them in a bit of extra sauce, and let me tell you, that would make a great appetizer all by itself.  I would personally prefer a non-bottom dwelling fish, but since we had  a lot of catfish come our way, we tried this recipe, and am I ever glad.  Fabulous.  Used the Italian Wheat Roll recipe  from this site in our bread machine, sans yeast, to make the wraps. Best wraps we have made to date. Excellent pairing for this fish and sauce.

This recipe was easy and simple.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it paired with a Garlic Broccoli recipe also on Allrecipes.com (thanks to TUNISIANSWIFE who's review recommended the pairing).  We will make this again, but may try cooking the onions a bit before mixing with the mustard.  They were very crunchy, which I didn't mind, but I think cooked onions will be a nice alternative.

This was great, It is very spicey, if you don't like Onions and Dijon Mustard stay away, it will open the sinus (smiles). So easy to make. I like recipes that don't have a lot of ingredients and this hit the spot. My Husband loved this, best Catfish he has ever had other than fried. Just remember it is spicey. Thanks for the great recipe. Definate keeper

My Fiance and I were not fans. We even left out the onions because we hate them, and well, we think that mustard and fish should stay away from one another! It was very easy to make though!

Not a huge fan, unfortunately.  I just think the onion, mustard and fish were not a good combination.  Fiance liked it - I wouldn't make it again unless he wanted it.

I had higher hopes based on the reviews.
I'm not sure what it was but the mustard/onion/fish combination did not sit well with me. The mustard sauce is excellent...just not on my fish. Every one tried it, my old man said he liked it, but didnt eat much of it. No one else liked it. I'm going to try the mustard/onion on some pork sandwiches! 
Two stars for the sauce.
