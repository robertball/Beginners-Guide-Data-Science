Love these!!! My Grandma always makes them & brings them over after church & every single time, the cookies are gone by then end of the day. My G-ma's recipe is a little different: 1 TABLESPOON White Vinegar & 1/2 tsp. baking soda, NO NUTS!, 350 degree oven, & her recipes makes 4 dozen. More corrections: Beat butter & sugar at low speed. Increase to high & beat till light & fluffy. At low speed add vinegar, flour & baking soda, Cover bowl & let sit in refrigerater for an hour or put in freezer for 15-30 minutes. bake 20-25 minutes! Perfect!

The best! These taste just like sugar cookies, but without eggs. I skipped the nuts due to an allergy. The dough was easy to make and mix and the measurements given are exactly right. I measured the dough by the teaspoon-full and then rolled the cookies into balls and dipped the tops into raw sugar. They spread beautifully into perfectly round cookies. Fresh out of the oven they are soft and fabulous -- very buttery. Once they have cooled completely they get crispy, though the flavor is still very good. The recipe made about 48 cookies. This is a definite keeper.

Oh my goodness..tasty cookies is an understatement.  These are crispy, buttery and amazingly good.  The entire batch didn't last the day.  I used 3/4c white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar and pecans instead of walnuts.  The ease of making these and the common ingresents make these my new #1 go to cookie!

Vinegar cookies are the most underrated cookies of our time! I have loved them since I was a kid, and finally, I found a recipe for them..I made two dozens of them, brought them to work, and went home with nothing. Delicious, thank you so much. They are excellent with or without the nuts...

I was looking for a dairy free, nut free cookie for my allergic daughter (I left out the nuts).  I never have high expectations for those recipes, but I found myself eating all of these cookies.  They are addictive!

Just made these the night before last, and realized that I need to let the world know how good these are!  They are truly fantastic.  They remind me of Pecan Sandies, only better. I have made them with both walnuts and pecans.  I made them with pecans last, because that is what I had on hand.  You could also call them 'Butter Pecan Cookies' this way; it sounds a little more appetizing than Vinegar Cookies.  I love how this recipe requires only a few ingredients, most of which you will already have.  The only cons that I can think of is that the dough can be a little crumbly and dry, so I had to work the dough into flattened balls by hand before putting them on the cookie sheet(but it's worth it).  They also seem to cook faster the closer you get to the bottom of the bowl, so I would look in the oven at about 15 minutes.  They are also a delicate, crispy cookie, so you need to store carefully if you are going to gift these.  These are definitely gift-worthy cookies!

I made these last weekend and they were quite good!  The taste and texture remind me of Pecan Sandies (except with walnuts instead).  I wasn't sure how they were supposed to turn out and one of the batches burned when I let it go 20 minutes rather than 18.

Too bad I can't give this a 10 star rating!! In the last week, I've made 10-12 DOUBLE batches because they couldn't be simpler to make!!  EVERYONE I know will be getting a tin FILLED with them, and I had a blast making each batch a bit differently experimenting with nuts & a variety of spices... and and !! EVERY time I had a WINNER and I don't think you could goof these up no matter what. I happen to LOVE pecans... so I used them, but did use the walnuits for hubby... He thinks I'm a master baker now too... but it's MY SECRET! I could go on & on, but! THANKS for this KEEPER and HAPPY HOLIDAYS! Oh, and I like 'em BIG so I just increased the size.   :)P``

These are excellent!  They were so fast to make, and with only a few pantry staples.  I almost added eggs cause I've never made cookies without them and was hesitant about how they would turn out, but I'm glad I didn't!  I only added a pinch of cinnamon & vanilla for extra flavor.  The texture of the cookies was light & crispy and a little chewy.  My only complaint was there weren't enough of them :)

Writing this review as I eat a cookie!  First time making this, did half a batch following the directions. It was soooo delicious! The second time I added half a tsp. of vanilla. Made it even yummier!  Also, great thing about this recipe is if you wanted to eat just the dough, it's safe for pregnant women because it doesn't have eggs in it. 5 stars!

I can't rave about this recipe enough! Haven't had the nuts in (just none in the house when I start going), but perfect butter cookies. The first time, I made a larger recipe than I wanted, so I rolled up part of the dough and put it in plastic wrap in the fridge - baked them maybe two weeks later by slicing off rounds and they were every bit as good as the originals on day one. The second time I baked them, I used white whole wheat flour and threw in some cinnamon, plus used apple cider vinegar because I was too lazy to go downstairs for the white - delish. One time I followed the reviewer suggestion to dip in sugar - some in sprinkles and some in colored sugar - and again, perfect. This IS my butter cookie recipe now. Thank you SO much and so happy I bumped across this recipe somehow as I was surfing allrecipes!

I baked these on a whim.  The recipe was so simple I just whipped up a batch.  I am so glad I did!  These are awesome!!  Light, crisp edges, slightly chewy center.  I used 1/4 C brown sugar and 3/4 C white, as other reviewers suggested.  I do not care much for nuts, so I ground mine very fine.  Delicious!  These taste just like a local coffee house's pecan cookies.

I just made these and it was very easy to make.  As I was putting in the nuts, I thought, that's a lot of nuts, but somehow they all got mixed in.  I changed the recipe by halving it and substituting whole wheat flour and flax seed for some of the all-purpose-flour.  On a lighter cookie sheet, I baked them for 18 min and on a darker pan, it only took 15 min.  The result was very flat cookies that were extremely crispy and buttery.  They tasted good, but I thought it was a little too sweet so I will cut down on the sugar next time. Because they're so crispy, my toddler made a mess eating them so I'm not too thrilled about that.  They're delicious so I can't stop eating them, but wish they were a little chewier.

OMG. Seriously, best cookie ever. I rolled them into little balls, then rolled the balls in cinnamon sugar to make snickerdoodles. I love a good, buttery, CRISPY cookie, and these are OUTSTANDING. In fact, I told my boyfriend who swears he's NEVER getting married that after he eats one of these cookies, we're going to talk about it again, cuz I think these are going to change his views on the universe. These cookies are proof of good in the world.

These were great!  Even my friend who usually avoids anything I bake without eggs or milk loved them. I left out the walnuts since I didn't have any on hand and added cinnamon like some other reviewers suggested.   I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I've been making these cookies for years for my son who is allergic to eggs.  Everyone loves them and no one could guess that they're egg-free.  I have used this recipe for many variations, including adding 1 cup chocolate chips for yummy chocolate chip cookies.  I've also chilled the dough and used it for cut-out cookies.  Overall these are great light buttery cookies!

An exceptionally crisp and yummy shortbread-like cookie.  I left the nuts out.  Some of these will be on the Christmas plate for the neighbors.

Let cool completely before removing from pan. Use parchment paper for easier removal. I omitted the nuts because I didn't have any. They turned out delicious and my family/friends enjoyed them immensely! I wonder if baking powder would substitute the baking soda-vinegar ingredients, since these came out flat anyways. The dough is very dry, so don't get discouraged, they will flat out and turn out beautifully! thanks for the recipe!

I made these into chocolate chip cookies and my husband LOVED them. We like wheat flour, so I used half wheat and half all-purpose flour. I also added a little vanilla and cinnamon and cut back just a bit on the sugar. They turned out delicious...a little bit crispier and flatter than I thought they would but tasted great. Thanks for the recipe!

I gave these only 4 stars, because, even though they tasted good, I wasn't crazy about the texture. I've never had Pecan Sandies, but that is how I would describe the texture of these cookies, um,  well, sandy. Even though they were very easy to make, I wouldn't make them again unless I were desperate for a sweet cookie and out of eggs. Also, based on other reviews,I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the mix, and chocolate chips instead of the nuts,(personal preference).

These are absolutely fabulous!  They are so easy to make that my 3 1/2 year old stepdaughter helped me make them.  I didn't think I was going to be able to get her to stop eating the dough because it tasted so good!  (And because there is no egg I didn't have to worry about her eating it.)  I made each batch a little differently. The first I made according to the recipe but added 1/2 tsp of vanilla as suggested by another reviewer; the second, I made with some chocolate chips; and the third I made with the chocolate chips and rolled them in raw sugar.  WOW!  Each one version was fantastic!  I love how they all the ingredients are kitchen staples so if you are in a bind and need an easy and versatile cookie recipe, this is truly it!

Very disappointing.  Tastes just like a bite of baking soda.  I'd thought I could trust the ratings (I took luscious punch and jalapeno popper spread to parties without trying them first - they were great), but these are for a funeral lunch tomorrow and I'm afraid I'll have to purchase cookies in the morning.

We love these cookies especially for school treats where some kids may have allergies to eggs... I did try it a bit different this time. I used 1/2 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour 1/2 cup white sugar 2 sticks of butter and 1/2 margarine. They turned out perfect.  One note though, it is advisable to let them sit for about 5 minutes after mixing them to let the mixture "set" then it will hold its shape while baking.

Trying something new is a good thing!  I have baked cakes with vinegar, so why not cookies? A nice, crisp, flavorful cookie.  I will make these again!

I was really surprised how good these were!! They are now a favorite because they are crispy, buttery and easy to make. You can't taste the vinnegar folks, but I think it reacts with the soda to make it bubble as it bakes creating an airy, light crisp cookie! Keep an eye on these...They will burn easy with all that butter and they spread out resulting in a thin cookie. Love them!!

Such an easy, yet wonderful tasting, recipe.  It tastes much better than it sounds.  I found that it worked better making a smaller size cookie.

I love the thin, chewy, crunchy cookie, but they taste rather blah, in spite of the white choc. chips and cranberries I added.  My husband, who will eat just about any sweet thing, didn't like them at all.  They are very greasy, as well.  I might make them again, but not for sure.  Definitely use parchment paper and let them cool on that or in the cookie sheet.  They fall apart very easily, but the crumbs are deliciously crunchy.

Very tasty and simple cookie recipe! I used 1/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 c white sugar. I also added a dash of vanilla and a little cinnamon. I didn't have any nuts on hand so I left them out as well.

I made this recipe because I was craving homebaked cookies, but didn't have any eggs on hand.  This cookie is buttery and crunchy and satisfied my craving for sure.  I only used about a half cup of chopped walnuts, and it was perfect for my taste.  I also sprinkled the cookies with cinnamon and sugar when I pulled them out of the oven.  These cookies reminded me somewhat of those Christmas cookies you buy in the blue tin.

I will admit i thought this wasnt gonna work. The dough was SOOO crumbly I didnt think it had a chance but trudged ahead and mashed them into the balls and baked them. OMG! these are the best cookies I have tasted in a long time. So soft and light!! I omitted the nut and dusted w/ sugar out of the oven. So So GOOD!

Review is a good recipe for a mennonite traditional.  I added a little almond flavor, nuts and dates and it made the cookie much better.  Would recommend this recipe that surprises many when they find out it is called a vinegar cookie.

Simple and delectable! Nice crunchy outside and chewy inside. Yes, they flatten like little pancakes, so what? They are really lovely cookies and perfect for coffee or tea time. Do not be turned off by the name. Not quite sure what makes these cookies  These cookies. All I know is I LOVE them!  PS, A sprinkle of cinnamon sugar would not be a bad thing either! LOL Keeper  Thank You Cynthia, These are a warm hug :)

Crispy, flaky EASY goodness.

I can see what makes this a go-to recipe. A few simple ingredients that you have on hand, a quick stir and they're done. 

I followed the recipe exactly  except for adding a teaspoon of vanilla. No hand mixer involved, stirred 'em up by hand.

Spooned up a walnut-sized piece of dough, lightly squeezed it into a roughly-shaped ball. I used parchment paper instead of a greased cookie sheet (who wants to wash a greasy cookie sheet?)

They do spread, so leave some space between them; However, it didn't seem to hurt them if they ran together.

Be sure to check them at 18 minutes. They can over-crisp quickly. I got most of them out of the oven when they were still pale and puffy-looking with just a little brown around the edges. Those I let brown more went flat and were too crisp.

I plan to experiment using part brown sugar, part maple maple sugar, lemon and other flavorings  with these. Seems like they would be pretty adaptable.

I was scared by vinegar being in a cookie, but they're pretty dang good! I tweaked the recipe some. We were low on sugar so I subbed it for Stevia. And we didn't have whit vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead. Added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla. Sprinkled some powdered sugar on top--YUMMM!! Definitely a keeper!

These are prefect if you need cookies for school because there is always one kid that is allergic to something. Only down side is they are not to sweet so you'll eat them all right away,if not by yoursel.:) I threw cranberries or other dried fruit to add color the kids love them.

I wish there were more stars!! I made a batch of these with 1/2 pecans and 1/2 walnuts. Then I gave some to my husband to try, I was in the basement and all I heard was OMG, THESE ARE AWESOME!!! I had to make another batch, right away, b/c he ate them ALL!! The 2nd batch I did try with 1/4 c brown sugar & 3/4 c white sugar. We prefer them with all white sugar, but they were EXCELLENT both ways! I also toasted the nuts. They reminded me of pecan sandies. Thanks for sharing an AWESOME recipe!!!

I need to try again.  Apparently using Smart Balance dairy free butter is NOT the route to go.  I'm sure that's why I had to add nearly an extra 1/2 cup flour and my cookies ended up totally flat.  They taste decent though so I have a feeling with the REAL butter they will be a hit.

OK, so I picked this recipe because (1) I was out of vanilla, (2) I had walnuts, and (3) I thought the concept of vinegar in cookies would gross out the kids. Success! (In both the taste and reaction.) The cookies were delicious, and the kids got a lesson of the use of acids in cooking. One possible suggestion: My oven may run hot, but my cookies were done after 13 minutes.

Turns out a lot like a tea cookie or spritz.  Interesting taste though, makes you want to eat one after another.

very good, subtle buttery cookies. I personally would have preferred them with pecans, and will make them again with, but they were very good with walnuts.  They do spread quite a bit - I chilled the dough and scooped it into rounded balls and cooked without flattening, and they still spread out quite a bit. Let them sit on the pan for two minutes before sliding off.

eta: i'm kicking this up to five. they were so good i ate the whole batch. made another batch with vegan butter for a friend, and they were great too, and spead less.

Everyone that has tried them has loved them! I accidentally melted the butter instead of softening it, and didn't have time or ingredients to do it over, but they turned out amazing! And I don't know if that's why or not, but mine are done in ten minutes at 325. And maybe it's because I use parchment paper, but I've had no problems with crumbling cookies. I've not had to add any extra flour either.

Delicious cookie.  Based on other reviews I added extra flour, almost a cup for a double batch.  I had no problem lifting the baked cookies from the pan, which I had forgotten to lightly grease.  With that much butter in them you shouldn't have to grease the pan anyway.  I used pecans rather than walnuts from personal preference.  I found I had to raise the heat to 350 to get them to cook in 20 minutes.  I got 8dz out of my double batch!  They're going into a bake sale tomorrow.  The only bad thing about these cookies is the name;-) it could put people off.  UPDATE:  2 wks later my husband is still raving about these cookies - he loves 'em.

Would have given them 5 stars, but had to alter them just a little after the 1st batch spread all over the pan. I had to make the flour a full 2 cups, and up the temp to 350. After that, can't say enough positive things about this cookie. 

The dough is easy to work with, reminded me of sugar cookies. I rolled them into balls, they cooked in minutes.

Presentation, they looked like perfect display cookies. They are soft. My daughter tried the first one, "Heaven, they melt in your mouth". They seem to be a cross between a sugar cookie and butter cookie.

I will be saving this recipe for the future. I have a son allergic to eggs, perfect for him.

I suppose you could also alter this even further and make them chocolate as well.

Oh my gosh! These are the best cookies EVER!!!!! I can't get enough of their yummy goodness but word of advice, don't make the cookies too big or they will be a hassle to get off the pan. Also lining the pan with aluminum foil makes clean up significantly easier :)

Wow, I can't believe how tasty these are for how easy they are to make! I ended up just whipping all the ingredients together in a bowl and adding a little strawberry and vanilla extract! Delicious! Only thing that would make them better, would be if they were a little thicker,but that would probably require eggs and for me to refrigerate them awhile, which I did not. Yum either way!

I got 4 dzn out of this recipe.  I did not use nuts, and I added a tsp of vanilla to the recipe.  They are good, but quickly will turn hard after taking out of the oven as they cool.  Still a good cookie overall.  Great for a budget or those who are needing to watch allergies.

These cookies just came out of the oven and I am eating one as I make the review.  They absolutely DO taste like pecan sandies. I made mine using splenda and pecans. Mine cooked in 16 minutes. I rolled into balls and placed on cookie sheet, mashing them slightly. When they were done, they slid easily off the cookie sheet. No problems with crumbling, etc. I hate to bake, but will make these often.

These cookies are so simple, yet drop-dead  delicious.  They are just buttery, sugary, and a little bit crumbly.  My family does not much care for sugar cookies and rarely requests them. The only reason I made this recipe was because it contained baking soda and vinegar, so I wanted to test them for possible use in a preschool science lesson (for our chemistry unit -- acid/base reactions).  Though there's no exciting volcano-like action going in in these cookies (such small amounts of bs + v), they are so tasty that I'll make them again and again, for home and for school!

Great cookie!  Looked for an egg free cookie after the massive recall and was amazed by this one!  I added just a touch more flour, chocolate chips and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar when pulled out of the oven!!  They didn't last 5 minutes!

When I mentioned that I wanted to make "vinegar cookies" my family made all kind of faces... Last night at about 10:30 pm I decided to try the recipe... Once the cookies were baking I had to use my spatula to keep the kids away; needless to say they all LOVED them! I cut the dough in half and added chocolate covered Heath crunch to one of the halves; can you say YUMMY?! Fabulously easy and yummy cookie! Next time I'd like to try to cut the butter down a bit.

These were good cookies and it is really a matter of taste. They are very crunchy. I used these with peanut butter frosting and that alone would make them five stars. Not great, but not bad- just a tasty, simple cookie.

These remind me of Sandies (pecan shortbread cookies), which is not my favorite cookie.  My husband loves Sandies, on the other hand, so maybe he'll like these when he gets home.  I made a double batch and the only thing I changed was that I added vanilla.  I made 6 without nuts and the rest with.  The ones without nuts, spread more,  were not as attractive and fell apart very easily.  These cookies have a nice, sweet, nutty taste that seems to keep calling me back for another try, but once I eat a bite, I keep finding myself disappointed by the greasy film left in my mouth and on my fingers and by their extreme fragility.  I'm not sure what purpose the vinegar serves, as it is undetectable as far as taste goes; I was actually hoping for a wee bit of a tangy flavor.  I saw in another review where their recipe called for 1 tablespoon of vinegar, so maybe that would be an idea to try if you're hoping for at least a hint of the vinegar taste to be in "vinegar" cookies.  It's not a bad cookie, just not one for me.

This is a good, basic egg-free cookie that can be modified to be entirely dairy-free by using baking-safe margarine or shortening in place of the butter. That's the point of the vinegar; you can't taste it. It's silly for this recipe to be receiving mixed reviews; lacking eggs, of course it will not have a texture like regular cookies. But, for a cookie lacking eggs, these are remarkably similar to sugar cookies or sandies in taste and texture. Are they as tasty as cookies made with eggs? No, not really...but they're fabulous anyway. (I tested this recipe using butter, so that is the primary flavor. You could also use extracts to flavor them, 1/2 tsp.) Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great simple and quick cookie recipe. It was on the sweet side but really good. I skipped the walnuts and it was still great. I will use this again as the ingredients are readily avaiable and due to the ease of preparation.

Don't let the name fool you.  These cookies will be gone in a flash.  I omit the nuts, refrigerate the dough, then roll into 1" balls, then bake. (my 80 yo mother-in-law's recipe) Don't be afraid to omit the nuts...they'll still be wonderfully tasty +++++

My poor nut- and egg-allergic child has been deprived of cookie-making for so many years...I tried various recipes but they were so...weird, and labor-intensive to boot that i gave up and just made him rice krispie treats.

Bu this recipe was SO easy and so delicious...the kids were super excited to help make them and we ate them almost as fast as they came out of the oven (though i think they're actually better and a little less greasy-tasting the next day). Made them as is except for leaving out the nuts.  Baked on a silpat - easy peasy.

We decided to call them Armpit Cookies bc my husband walked in to the kitchen while we were mixing up the dough and asked why it smelled like armit in there. :)

Made this tonight and my husband loved them.  I left out the nuts (didn't have any) and added a cinnamon/sugar mix to the tops about half way through baking.  Yum!

I made them without the nuts and they were delicious!  So super easy to mix up.  I dropped by teaspoonfuls (they looked like they'd be tiny cookies) but they spread out to about 2" cookies.  Once baked they are a little fragile, so I don't think they'd travel in the mail well, but this is a great cookie for a sweet treat at home.

Yum. I baked mine 16 minutes and they were great. I loved them warm out of the oven, and my hubby preferred them a couple days later when they were extra crunchy with milk. Either way the flavor is fantastic.

I followed the recipe exactly & unfortunately I do not like the flavor. They have a strange aftertaste. I gave it 3 stars only because my fiance thought they were ok & he ate the batch that I made (but he will eat ANYTHING). I will not make these again.

These cookies were excellent!!!! This is my new cookie dough for sure. I love the fact that they have no eggs, and I don't have to fight the kids to stay out of the dough! I made mine with 1/3 cup brown sugar 2/3 cup white sugar, and also left out the nuts.  Instead I added half a bag of white chocolate chips, and they were DELICIOUS!

This is without a doubt one of the tastiest cookies ever.  I read the reviews and decided to try it.  It was so easy to put together that if you are looking for a treat to whip up in a hurry this is it.  They are wonderful warm from the oven and would make great cookies for an ice cream sandwich desert.  I too left out the nuts because my grandkids prefer things plain.

These cookies are wonderful.  They leave you with a crisp buttery cookie.  The only thing I changed was I added 1 tsp of vanilla for a sweeter taste. So easy to  prepare.

Since I adjusted for our taste I am giving 4 stars, but with my minor changes they are 5 stars cookies in both taste and ease of making...anything this buttery has got to be good! :)  This is what I ended up doing: I left out the nuts since my family wouldn't eat them that way, took the recommendation of using 3/4 white and 1/4 brown sugar and then found after the first batch that they needed something more, probably due to leaving out the nuts, so I sprinkled the hot cookies with cinnamon sugar.  Like this they taste very similar to Snickerdoodles...one of my favorites...but way easier. Perfect with a cold glass of milk!

Basic cookie recipe. Interesting use of vinegar. Used 3/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. added 1 tsp vanilla extract. Added half bag of choc chips. I think it could use less butter though.

Everyone was very apprehensive of the name till they tried it. Most people had the misconception that they would taste vinegary, which they do not. They are very tender, buttery tasting cookies. I also added fruit bits to it to give more definition to the flavors. Otherwise it'll taste a bit too buttery and greasy, like you picked up a crispy piece of butter. Overall it's an average cookie.

These cookies are delicious!  One of my favorites!  I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar and walnuts the first time I made them.  The second batch, instead of walnuts I used Heath bits - they turned out great!  This will definitely be a regular cookie recipe - it's easy and yummy!

These were TO DIE FOR.  I make 4-5 different cookie recipes every xmas and this one has been by far the best one ever.  
I used less flour as suggested by other reviewers, formed balls with the cookies, rolled in sprinkles and flattened out on the pan.
I am making them again for New Year's.
I highly recommend them to anyone who likes cookies!

Well, much to my disappointment I give these cookies one star. I followed the recipe and they came out flat and not at all tasty. They are edible, just not light, tasty, and delish.
 Our weather today has been wet, maybe the humidity affected the outcome of the recipe. I love the idea behind the recipe and I truly am disappointed. I don't feel like wasting my money and time on a recipe that doesn't work. Will not make again.

Just like the other reviews, we found these cookies to be easy and really tasty. Some of the Staff who tried them, couldn't believe their tasebuds.  We heard "Vinegar? Really?" a lot. We liked the fluffy/airy texture!

Very yummy cookie! :) I also used 3/4 cup of white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown suger.  And, I used 1 cup of white flour, and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Everyone in our family loved them!  And, super easy to make!  (Especially, when limited ingredients are in the house ;)

You know the pantry's bare when you're down to using vinegar in cookies! :) I used margarine instead of butter and I omitted the nuts as we're all out. The cookies REALLY flattened out, and I had to lower the temperature to 325 as they were starting to darken on the bottom while remaining uncooked on top, but they turned out tasty. Kind of like an extra-crisp butter cookie. Next time, I think I'll add more flour or something so they don't flatten so much and so they're somewhat chewy instead of so crispy. Some cinnamon and nutmeg might be nice... Thanks, Cynthia, your recipe rocks. :)

These cookies are delicious.  I received 
numerous compliments on a nutless 
version of them at a recent church
supper.

Very easy recipe to follow when you feel like baking but don't have chocolate chips/raisins/oatmeal!

Changed I made: I didn't add nuts. Made like 1/5 of the sugar brown instead of white. Didn't have baking soda so used 1.5 tsp baking powder. 
Added dashes of:
Nutmeg
Allspice
Cinnamon

Success!

Amazing cookies!! Reminds me of pecan sandies (except for they are walnuts) with a more enhanced flavor. These were soo good that I could not stop eating the dough!! The vinegar truly brings out the taste in these cookies. Great way to bake cookies!!

These tasted great, but I was unimpressed with how flat they turned out.  They were thinner than pancakes!  They were also very greasy.  I doubt we'll make them again.

These are absolutely the best, and very easy to make! I like soft cookies, my husband likes crunchy, so I cooked half about 15 min, and half 19 min, and it worked wonderfully!

Meh - these cookies were just OK to me. Could have been my own fault for not checking. They seemed to brown quickly. My in-laws devoured them, however. Maybe just to be nice ;)

I guess the taste is okay... but most of the cookies stayed stuck to the pan and would break off when i tried taking them off i tried to do it hot and cold. They turn out supper thin and they are edible but nothing i will crave or try to make again.

Great cookie, great flavor.  I used pecans and added chocolate chips and a little vanilla.  The only negative is that this cookie comes out hard, and you must wait until the cookie cools before you try to remove it from the sheet, otherwise it will crumble.  Overall a good recipe.

These cookies are better than sugar cookies--nice and buttery with a perfect blend of soft in the middle and crunchy on the ends.  This recipe is especially handy when you're out of eggs but have that sugar cookie craving.

I got this recipe from my grandmother.  Whenever I'm in the mood for cookies, these are the ones I make.  They practically melt in your mouth!  Her recipe calls for pecans rather than walnuts, and includes 1 tsp vanilla.

These weren't quite what I expected them to be. They did not rise very much, but that may have been because I couldn't find my baking soda, so I used baking powder (I don't know what the difference is). I only baked them for 10 minutes because my oven is hotter than most. I can't imagine adding chocolate chips or nuts to these because they spread and flatten so much that it would be difficult to hold any cookie add-ins. Even though they weren't chewy in texture and were somewhat flat, they had a very good taste and were very addictive! I would call these cookie crisps rather than simply cookies.

I really liked the idea of eggless cookies but mine flattened out into thin, sticky, sugary blobs. I'm not sure what I did wrong as I followed the recipe exactly as-is.

I followed the instructions exactly... Used walnuts coz all of us are nuts about nuts:-)
It's the first cookie that I've been so compelled to "test" as each batch came out! They're not your typical sweet cookies, they're crispy and buttery with a hint of sweet at the end... Maybe that's why I'm already addicted!! Will definitely be making again and again, it's also an amazingly easy dough to mix up.  Can't stop raving about this...

I had all the ingredients on hand so I tried this recipe. I should have refridgerated the dough before baking so the cookies didn't spread so much. These cookies are perfect with a cup of coffee or tea but they are very rich. I didn't add the nuts but added mini choc chips. These were too sweet for my taste so unless I adjusted the amount of sugar, I'm not sure I'd make these again

What an amazingly delicious recipe thanks for sharing! I made these with my 4 yr old & they were very easy to make. We used margarine due to dairy allergies & they turned out wonderfully at 18 min. These will be hard to keep around the house for long!

I am not sure what that vinegar does, but these are some good cookies. Thin crispy and great flavor. We ate them right up! I had everything on hand in our pantry which is nice for making really quick when needed.

I work in an after school program.  It was a dreary, rainy day & I decided making cookies with the kids would brighten things up.  Problem was- we had nothing in the pantry- EXCEPT the ingredients for these cookies!  I made a double batch, exactly as per the recipe- except that I had to leave out the nuts b/c some of the kids have allergies.  I made the dough before the kids arrived (took all of 2 minutes) and then let the kids form little balls and roll them in colored sprinkles.  They were a big hit- even with the parents.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!  I'm sure it would be delicious with other additions- perhaps cinnamon or vanilla- but even if you have just the bare minimum on hand- this is the cookie for you!

These are tasty, but not the greatest. I added vanilla to get more flavour. They are also a bit too greasy, so I put paper towels on a wire rack while cooling and also in the box where I saved them, and that helped.

Great quick cookie recipe without eggs!  Buttery and crisp a definite keeper! Allow to rest on cookie sheet 1 minute before removing to avoid breakage.

This cookie was a HIT at thanksgiving !

Some people say that the dough is crumbly. My dough started out crumbly, but after a few more minutes in my stand mixer, it actually became quite smooth. 
I added vanilla and cinnamon per other reviewers, and used chopped cranberries and walnuts instead of pecans (though I'm sure pecans would have worked just as well)

Only reason it's not 5 stars is that even cutting back the sugar to 3/4 cup, the cookie was a tad too sweet for my taste. 

I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for sharing !

2nd Try: Came back to change my review (three stars to five stars)...I decided to put them in the muffin tin and they turned out to be soft little cups. I filled it with a big marshmallow (close to the end of baking) and it was good. Next time will try it with different filings. 

1st Try: This was a nice little quick easy snack to make. The first batch I made was a little too done (15 minutes) so for the second batch I left it in there for about 6-7 minutes (brown edges) and then turned the oven off. Very thin and crispy. I also added chocolate chips to the second batch I made.

I made these one night after I used my last egg and accidentally burned the cookies from another recipe. These saved the night! I already had everything on hand and was able to whip them up quickly. I usually like soft and chewy cookies, but I really enjoyed the interesting crispy/crunchy texture these had. They spread quite a bit, but everyone at my game night gobbled them right up!

These are great!! Especially when you have a craving for something sweet and realize you've run out of eggs!! I made the mistake of flattening my raw cookie balls, this made them thin and crisper. I can't wait to make these again! Super simple, fast, and delicious!!!

Perfect tea cookie! Keep the dough chilled. I bumped the vinegar to 1 Tbsp (as recommended)and used salted butter, pecans and raisins.

This is the first recipe I made from this web site and now I am a huge fan of both the cookie and web site.  My husband says they cookies should be called "crack" cookies because they are so addictive!

I didn't have time to go to the store and needed a recipe in a hurry.  These were quick and easy to make.  

The walnuts I chopped rather small, so they were more like sandies.   Next time, I will chop the walnuts a little more coarse. No comments except they were very sweet, but they were eaten all up!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and very versitile. I agree with others comments..add a little more flour or they are just way too runny. You can add ANYTHING to these. I made a batch per the directions and they were great..some with a 1/2 tsp of Almond extract and another batch with chocolate chips...You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

We love these cookies! I add a teaspoon of vanilla, leave out the nuts and add sprinkles and they're the perfect addition to my daughters preschool lunch since her school is a nut free school.

I like the quickness but it just tastes like something is really missing! Maybe more sugar and flour.
