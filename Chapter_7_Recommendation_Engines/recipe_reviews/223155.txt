Great, easy recipe! Most ingredients are on hand at our house, we used it when we ran out of  store bought guacamole and still had more chips, we won't be buying store bought anymore. Way to easy to do this.

Thanks for sharing.  Super easy and even husband liked it!  Great by itself but next time I'm adding fresh cilantro! I drained my Rotel before I added them.

A great basic recipe for Guacamole.  I did use fresh tomatoes this time around, but in the winter when I can't get them, I'm sure the canned will do just fine.

I made this and was very pleasantly surprised with the taste without a lot of heat. We had fresh salsa also and that had lots of heat. Most of the guests enjoyed the fresh and cool guacamole. If I make this again I will add an additional jalapeno pepper or two, I like more heat.
