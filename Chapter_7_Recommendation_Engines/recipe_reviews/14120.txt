10 stars. This is awesome with some minor adjustments. My entire picky family loved these. For serving of four: I used 5-6 small white potatoes (sliced thin) 1 small onion (diced), 5T flour, 5T butter, 2 and 1/4 c milk, 1/2t pepper, 1/2t dry mustard, 1t each of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and salt, pinch of cayenne pepper and 1/4 c parm cheese. OK grease 2 quart casserole dish, preheat over 425, make roux in saucepan: melt butter then whisk flour cook one minute until it resembles wet sand, add rest and cook until slight thick. put one layer potatoes, one layer onions, one layer sauce and continue once again. Top off with paprika and parm cheese, cook 425 5 minutes then 375 for 50 minutes. Awesome and actually very easy. Must try will not be sorry

like most others have stated, this recipe as it is given is very bland but there are many remedies as suggested by others that make it fab-o!!  i will do my best to summarize them all so others behind me don't have to sift through hundreds of reviews...

1.) boil the potatoes for 5 mins beforehand to reduce the cooking time in half
2.) make a roux of the sauce rather than pouring ingredients directly on top.  roux is made by mixing flour, butter and milk into sauce pan on medium heat.  then add seasonings as you like.
3.) use seasonings to make this recipe really pop.  i used 2 cloves garlic, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp celery salt, 1 tbsp chopped onions, a pinch of thyme, a pinch of rosemary, 2 pinches of parsley, 2 pinches of oregano.  then at the very last second when the roux was simmering nicely, i added 1/4 cup of shaved parmesan cheese.
4.) once you drain the potatoes, place one layer in the bottom of a 9x13 glass casserole dish, then drizzle 1/3 of the sauce on top.  repeat for 2 more layers.
5.) cook covered at 425 degF until the sauce boils and then remov cover and cook at 350 degF for 30 mins.
6.) to get the top of the potatoes browned, you may need to broil them for 5 additional minutes (depending on your oven's cooking capabilities).
7.) voila - enjoy!!!

Wonderful and simple recipe! I will always use this one for my family. Great to put together ahead of time and pop into the oven. For those of you who added this, that and the other...why? It's supposed to taste like potatoes! For those of you who said make a rouge...why? It's supposed to be a simple recipe, who wants another unnecessary step *and* another dirty pan to wash! Sounds like you folks need to submit your own recipe, because you are totally changing what this recipe is all about...ease, simplicity, & down-home flavor :o)

These are just like the ones my MIL used to make!  Ok, if you're looking for a fancy-type dish, then don't bother with it - and yes, there is no cheese, etc., so they are not "au gratin" potatoes.  These are just plain old down-home scalloped potatoes like granny used to make.  These go excellently with pork roast, pork chops, or pork tenderloin.  The only thing I did differently was to add pepper - I think that maybe the submitter forgot pepper in the ingredient list since she described it with "seasonings" (plural).  Also, maybe my oven is fast (convection), but 45 minutes was plenty (even maybe a bit too long) for cooking time.  Anyway, it's very simple and ingredients are all something I usually have on hand!  Thanks for sharing.....

Turned out pretty well. I made a few basic changes. First, I made a roux out of the flour/butter, added the milk and let it thicken to avoid the lumps. I also added about 1 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, a sprinking of garlic salt, and 1/4-1/2 cup parmesan cheese. I spread this sauce over each layer of potatoes and cooked as directed. They did require more time to cook than indicated and it didn't say whether to cook covered or uncovered. I did covered but then had to turn the broiler on for a bit to brown the tops.

These potatoes were excellent!  I had never made scalloped potatoes before, since my family doesn't usually like them. Even my picky four year old liked them!
Next time I make these ( and there WILL be a next time!)  I will try sifting the flour over the potato layers -- there weren't many lumps, but I think they could be avoided all together by using the sifter instead of sprinkling the flour with a spoon.
Thanks for the great recipe!!

I normally make this dish with the traditional cheddar cheese sauce, but decided that I wanted something a little different. I was a little concerned over differing reviews. The "bland" part can always be rectified but the flour issues kind of worried me. I was happy to see JEPPER'S review because I thought the "roux" idea was a good one. I made my roux in a sauce pan, added my milk along with black pepper, onion and garlic powder, parm cheese and some cayenne for a little zippity-do-dah. I placed my first layer of potatoes in the dish and poured some of the sauce on top, in addition to more parm cheese. I repeated this and ended with another sprinkling of parm and paprika. Very, very delicious Nancy!

I have been making this simple recipe for more years then I want to admit.  It's a SIMPLE recipe you can add to if you want.  You don't need to make a roux for this.  Why is it that everyone needs to make all these changes and then rate it.  If you don't like what you read look further I am sure there are other recipes on this site that will meet your needs.  I find this with soo many recipes on this site and you are being unfair to the person who submitted it. Have you tried it as written?

E U R E K A ! ! !  I agree with another reader, this is so much like the "Original Scalloped Potatoes" I enjoyed as a child.  All other recipes have cheeses in them making them an Au-Gratin Potato, which is not a true Scalloped Potato.  I would have given this a 5 STAR rating, except for the omission of thinly sliced onions layered between the potatoes. I have been eating these potatoes over 40+ years!  And of course you can always add other ingredients to change the casserole to suite your taste!

Good old, basic recipe that works well and is very good!  I blended 1/2 the milk with all of the flour, poured it over the layers of potatoes and then poured the rest of the milk over the whole casserole at the end.  I baked them at 425 for 30 mins and then turned down to 385 for 45 minutes.  They were soft and delicious.  I used almost 5 lbs of potatoes, but kept everything else the same.  YUM!  Thanks for a classic!

Finally! REAL scalloped potatoes! YEA!!! Excellent, old-fashioned recipe like the women in my family made generations ago. I had lost my recipe and could not for the life of me remember the key ingredient: flour! DUH! Thank you for posting.

I looked all over for this recipe, thanks!  I sauted julienned bacon and finely chopped onion, and put that over the potatoes.  Made a roux of the flour and butter, added the milk and a cup of sour cream.  The family loved it.

These are almost exactly like my mom and grandma made. they would toss the flour in with the potaotes in a big bowl, then layer with a thinly sliced onion in the layers. also they would heat the milk and butter together and pour over before baking. and dont forget the black pepper. yummy.

The key to not having flour lumps is keeping your oven hot enough that the milk vigorously boils.  This turbulence breaks up the flour. I followed the recipe exactly aside from turning up the heat a little, and had no problems.  My family loved it!

I have been making this for years. The only difference between this recipe and my family's recipe is that we salt and pepper each layer and also add very thinly sliced onions to every layer. Top with pork chops or pork steaks for a one pot dinner!  By the way, once you add cheese, these are no longer scalloped (or escalloped) potaoes, they are au gratin.

Do not change anything to this recipe as it is an excellent recipe if you want the simple taste of Potatoes, butter and salt. If it is to bland for you or your families palette then there are many other good scalloped potatoes recipes where cheese, onions ect have a dominant flavour. Perfect simple side dish that doesn’t overpower your meat or vegetables! The only variations I would experiment with would be the type of potatoes and /or the type of salt.

I actually joined Allrecipes com to rate this recipe.  I have been looking for a recipe that resembled my mothers.  She just did it by-the-fly...no recipe.  There was NO cheese.  Just potato, milk, flour and butter.  Back then, she always fixed it with smoked sausage...it wasn't one without the other.  She grew up in the South and was not that much of a cook...but she got Fried Chicken White Gravy and Scalloped Potatoes DOWN! Thank goodness for a basic, no frills recipe!!

This was good, better than the potato recipes that typically add a manufactured taste with canned soup.  Simple to make, especially if the potatoes are sliced with a food processor.  The sauce was slightly gummy and lumpy, but thickened up well, even with skim milk.  In the future, I would cut down on the amount of flour somewhat, or start with a roux, since there was too much of a raw starch taste for my liking.

Nice and creamy!  Good, perhaps a few more spices (pepper, garlic) would be nice to add some additional flavor.

Just what I was looking for!  I only added a bit of garlic salt (I think I can't cook without adding that) and some white pepper.  They were exactly how scalloped potatoes are supposed to be - creamy and it didn't overpower the rest of the meal.  I did not add cheese - I thought that made them au gratin!

In my almost 40 years of marriage, I have never been able to find a Scalloped Potato recipe that I could master. Most of them seemed to curdle, be lumpy or taste bland. THIS one, however, worked!!!! The potatoes were soft, the sauce was plentiful and thick and no lumps and no curdling! This is DEFINITELY going in my recipe file!

Awesome...just like my irish father in law used to make.  Sometimes he would throw in a handful of cheese for a treat, but usually it was just this version.
It does not get lumpy, no roux is required.  And yes, pepper is good, but not mandatory.  I love that it is one pot, and no canned soups added in!!  Simple and tasty!

Just like my mom used to make!  I can eat a whole pan of these!  To the person who thought these didn't have enough taste, you can tell from the recipe that they're going to be pretty bland overall, so don't use the recipe and then complain about it.  Look for something with more spices.  As for me, this is my favorite dish.  Perfect!

This the way my mother made scalloped potatoes. I have made them for years this way. My Mom always made them perfect. I never had the amounts, so sometimes mine weren't as perfect. Now, thanks to BUCHKO, I have some amounts. This is the only way to make scallooped potatoes. To all you cooks saying to make a roue first, you are missing the point of the recipe. This only requires on pan. I do stir it up in the middle of cooking to get lumps out and to make sure it is not going to be too thick or too thin. I always remember there being dry flour bits in my Moms. I guess just like having lumps in gravy or mashed potatoes, thats how you know it is homemade. Nothing tops this recipe. Thank you.

As written it would be bland IMO but following other reviewers advice this was awesome!  I made my ruix in a sauce pan with 5 T of butter 5 T flour; cooked 3 min. then added 2 1/2 cups milk, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp. black pepper, 1/3 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp. dried mustard and a pinch of cayenne pepper, whisking until thickened aprox. 3-4 minutes.  Then layered the potatoes and sauce sauce along with cheese and crumbled bacon in the first two layers.  Ending with just sauce and cheese!.. Sooo good my Mom wanted this recipe!..:)

I've have been making this recipe since I saw it here in 2001. It is perfect as is. If you begin adding all the other ingredients 'suggested', then you are moving away from "scalloped potates" and might as well give it another name. I suggest trying it as posted with the addition of more salt if you prefer.

Perfect!  These ARE scalloped potatoes.  Volzstone - cream of chicken soup??!?  Shame on you!!    The only change I made was to add pepper to the recipe.  Oh...and ham.  This is pretty much the same recipe you find in the Fanny Farmer Cookbook.  I had no problem with the flour as others did. Consistency was very creamy.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for.  I wanted scalloped potatoes like I remember eating at holiday dinners but not the cheesy kind.  It just has a creamy taste.  YUM.  I took the advice to mix the flour into the milk and ended up with a smooth sauce, too.

Our family has had these potatoes as part of our Christmas Eve celebration since before I was born.  Now, when I make it, I add cubed ham steak in the layers.  We also add a few separated rings of very thinly-sliced onion in each layer.  To prevent the lumps, use Wondra flour.  It works like a charm 99% of the time.  I don't heat the milk, just carefully pour it until you can see it approaching the top layer of potatoes.  Last but not least, place several tablespoon-size pieces of cold butter on top.  As it melts down, it helps to create the roux.

This is the "real deal", almost identical to the recipe given to me years ago by an Irish lady. (And the Irish really know their 'taters!).  
I partially peel the potatoes, but leave some skin on - we all need our fiber.  And I slice the potatoes very thin using a mandolin - but patience with a sharp knife worked well before I bought this gadget.  
My family loves this and it is easy to modify for my gluten sensitive grand-daughter - I just make it with her special flour.  Because my family likes it with cheese, I generally add shredded cheese with each layer, and you can spice it up or down according to the tastes of the people you are feeding.  Garlic powder and perhaps a little chili powder for adults,  plain for kids. 
Add this to your recipe box for a treat for 2 people or 100 - you'll get great reviews every time.

Converted the recipe to 4 servings rather than 7.  I used four medium-sized russet potatoes for the suggested 28 oz. (although I am not sure how much they weighed).  I also peeled the potatoes prior to cutting them.  Based on another review, I mixed the ingredients together in a saucepan over medium-low heat and added a little bit of cayenne pepper, garlic powder and black pepper.  I layered the slices from two potatoes and then poured half the sauce over and added a thin layer of parmesan cheese.  I added another layer of potatoes, sauce and cheese.  The mixture browned nicely on top with the thin layer of cheese.  I will probably make again and add a bit more cayenne pepper and cheese.

Great recipe. I read about 50 reviews before I made it. I did a few things different. I grated 1 onion into the layers and I added 5 more tablespoons butter, plus I salt and peppered the layers very well with fresh ground pepper and sea salt. It was excellent.

This recipe is fantastic. I doubled it, made it the night before and just reheated it. The potatoes are done just right, with a smooth creamy sauce and lightly browned on top. I received many compliments and requests for the recipe....a definite keeper!

Nice & traditional. I do not like using any recipe that uses soups as an ingredient. I did add more salt & pepper, layered thinly sliced onions, as well as fresh sliced mushrooms with the potatoes. I mixed the milk and flour together before hand to take out risk of lumps.Second time around I added a touch of garlic and some shredded cheese. This was an excellent basic recipe, the whole family loved it, even my 3 yr old who will only eat potatoes in the shape of a french fry!! Very creamy!!

Delicious!  I boiled the potatoes for 15 minutes so I didn't have to bake in the oven for so long.  I also added shredded cheddar cheese to the top.

Any recipe that can withstand my get-in-a-hurry and not-paying-attention mistakes and still come out great gets a top rating from me!  Football was on last night, and I planned on putting this together during halftime..that was the hurry part.  I didn't finish before the 3rd quarter started...that was the not pay attention because I'm watching the game part!  To up the flavor, I chopped onion and layered that with the potatoes.  I also added freshly gound pepper and shredded sharp cheddar cheese along with the salt, and I mixed the flour into the milk and poured over each layer as I made them.  But...it was halfway into the cooking time when I realized that I had forgotten to use the butter!  I took the pan out of the oven and let it cool for a bit, then mixed in the bits of butter and stirred everything together.  I then smoothed the mixture and baked until the potatoes were tender.  You would have never known this started as a disaster.  They were creamy and delicious!

I loved this recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to add some pepper and I added some sharp cheddar cheese to the top after the potatoes were done, and let the cheese melt and brown in the oven.   I was bothered by some of the comments made about the recipe about making a roux.  I picked this recipe so I could skip the whole "getting out a pot and whisking" part.

I made these for Mr. LTH's gram's bday (she always had scalloped potatoes and mincemeat pie for her bday as a child).  I'm not a fan of scalloped potatoes, but she said these were just like her mom used to make and everyone else liked them, too. I made them as is, though I did add some diced and minced onion.  Thanks for making Gram LTH's bday!

These were good.  I also mixed the flour with the milk and poured it over top and added onion powder.  I only had one problem...the milk overflowed while cooking and made a big stinky mess in the bottom of my oven.  Not sure why this happened, I measured the milk carefully and used the right size pan.  I will still make these again i will just be ready for the overflow.  =)

For all you people that made a roux, what's the point,do you all have dishwashers? This is how my Granny made her's for over 70 years, always creamy & loved by her over 500 descendants. It is a basic recipe that is part of our Irish background and Sundays at the farm the dishalways made it to the table. As to the layer method, Emeril Lagasse once used it on the show he had with a live audience. I remember, I thought it silly  that a chef acted as if this was out of the ordinary. Also worth noting they DID NOT get the "Bamm' spice hit he was so famous for on that show. So save the roux for Welsh Rarebit, Creamed Salmon/Peas or just your basic White Sauce. Keep in mind some dishes are meant to be simple (bland), it's usually so to compliment a more flavorful main dish.

Just like Grandma's. I sliced & boiled my potatoes for a few min because I started dinner too late. Because the potatoes were then partially cooked, I followed the baking instructions(temps) but reduced the final bake to 30 min. Absolutely PERFECT!

This recipe is awesome. It is a perfect base to make any "flavored" scalloped potatoes you could possible dream of. Just add what ever spice(s) you wish to either the milk or the layers and you will never be disappointed. I have done a garlic/onion version, a chive/parsley/basil version and a cheesy pepper version. You can make it how you want and it turns out every time! Thank you for sharing!

This was fantastic with the following recommendations from another rater:  For serving of four: I used 5-6 small white potatoes (sliced thin) 1 small onion (diced), 5T flour, 5T butter, 2 and 1/4 c milk, 1/2t pepper, 1/2t dry mustard, 1t each of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and salt, pinch of cayenne pepper and 1/4 c parm cheese. OK grease 2 quart casserole dish, preheat over 425, make roux in saucepan: melt butter then whisk flour cook one minute until it resembles wet sand, add rest and cook until slight thick. put one layer potatoes, one layer onions, one layer sauce and continue once again. Top off with paprika and parm cheese, cook 425 5 minutes then 375 for 50 minutes

This recipe was terrible and I'm not a bad cook either.  I followed the advice of several reviewers and sifted the flour, still I had major lumps. I added shreaded cheese, onion, garlic, seasoning and such, but it was still very bland.  I had to cook the casserole for 1 and a 1/2 hour still the potatoes were a little hard.  It was very liquidty when first removed from the oven, but thickened as it cooled, still it did not look appetizing nor did it taste good. I ended up throwing the thing away.  I was very disappointed especially when I have always been successful with other "allrecipes". I don't know why this recipe got four stars.

loved these! Baking scalloped potatoes in a 9"x13"
pan worked so much better for me, than my past results in other type pans. I seasoned the potatoes with a little Lawry's. Also, I added several uncooked bacon strips across the top to flavor it while baking--- as that is how my grandmother always made them! This is the scalloped potato recipe I will stick to from now on!

This is the recipe I remember from 40 years ago.  My daughter and I made it together.  Potatoes and onion with creamy sauce.  NO CHEESE.  People who  change it and make a totally different recipe should not review this.

These are perfect! For those of you who think they taste bland, I think you are just used to the flavors and spices that we  use to perk things up nowadays. In the 1930's, 40's, 50's and 60's this  was a very buttery, creamy dish. Some of the suggestions for add in's sound yummy and I will be trying some but, for me, THESE ARE SCOLLOPED POTATOES. Classic served with a baked ham or roast beef.

This is exactly what I was looking for! It is the perfect base recipe for adding ham or seasoning to your liking.

This amazing recipe is one I grew up with, in fact it's probably the first dinner I ever helped with as a little girl (so much fun to layer those potatoes ;). We enjoyed it as written, sometimes adding chopped cooked leftover ham to make a hearty meal. We did just bake at 375 for roughly a full hour. Thanks for posting, it's a great meal and has so many happy memories for me!

I followed the suggestions from the review by 072705r and added the additional seasonings, and my husband thought these were fantastic! I thought they tasted more like au gratin potatoes, probably because of the paprika, but still thought they were good. Will definately make again.

This is the recipe my grandma used to make, but she would brown pork chops and then put them on top to bake, oh so yummy.  This is real comfort food for me!

This recipe is exactly the way my mother has made them for years!  I love them and I do have a few suggestions:  if you are short on time put the completed dish in the microwave for about 10 to 15 minutes and then just brown the top in the oven, make sure to place the dish on a cookie sheet in case it overflows, cleaning a cookie sheet is much easier than cleaning the oven!  This is comfort food at its best!  Thanks for sharing BUCHKO!

We enjoyed this dish--a tasty side to serve with baked chicken etc .  To save time we mixed the salt, pepper, flour and milk together and poured a little on each layer-- adding the remainder over the top after layering.  We also indulged by sprinkling shredded Cheddar cheese on each layer.

This is how I always make scalloped potatoes.

I'm making these for dinner tonight as a main meal with some additions:

I'm adding ham, onion, garlic, pepper, and cheddar cheese, along with parsley on top to make it pretty!

Not bad.  But here is a way to make them 5 stars.  NO FLOUR.  Use 3 cans cream of chicken soup.  One sweet onion diced, about 1/2 cup milk,  and here is the key.  LONG HORN CHEESE> Mix all well and bake.

I made a couple changes - I used Adobo seasoning instead of plain salt, added extra black pepper on each layer and also some Amer. cheese torn into strips.  I blended the milk and flour and poured it over everything before baking. Also, I used a deep round casserole instead of a baking dish.
This was the first time I ever tried scalloped potatoes from scratch - came out much better than I expected.  My gas oven is having an issue of not heating well, and I couldn't get it over 350 degrees, but i increased the cooking time and it came out perfect.  Everybody loved it.

This is a classic, homestyle recipe.  I halved it and baked it in a 9-in. round glass pan, alongside a roast chicken  After baking I let the dish sit for a few minutes so the sauce could thicken a bit. My husband scraped the bottom of the pan, and even my 8 year old son, who's not a potato fan, had seconds.

My mamaw made  these.  I loved them then too...made just like this wonderful old recipe.  I just can't understand listing all the tweaking and recipe changes that are made and considered in the review of the submitted recipe.  Make it the way it was submitted and review it that way.   Review the recipe the way it is submitted.   A "few  changes" turns out to be a half page of your own entirely different recipe.  Adding  bacon, onion and sour cream to my mamaw's scalloped potatoes is not a good thing.  Submit your own recipe!

I always layer potatoes & onions sprinkling salt & pepper over each layer.  I also heat the milk, flour & butter mixture till thick & creamy. Pour over potatoes & add more milk to cover potatoes. Cook through & sprinkle cheese over top & cook till melted & bubbly.

Just like mom's basic recipe except she didn't use the hotter oven to start. I add chopped onion and black pepper at each layer. Sometimes use seasoning salt. Easy to add cheese if desired. Also easy to scale down for two people.

I would say a four star doing it exactly by the recipe AND REMEMBER this is the old fashioned way so expect that...I would give it a five star if you added pepper when doing the layers.  I also sifted the flour on each layer instead of sprinkling with a spoon, this may have helped with the clumping that people were talking about because I didn't have that happen.

OMG!!  Its incredible!  I used milk straight from the fridge so needed to lay foil on top of the potatoes for about 10 minutes at the begining so they wouldn't burn, took about ten minutes for them to start bubbling around the edge.    Try layering 8 ounces of grated Gruyère cheese with the potatoes....  I can't begin to tell you how GREAT it is.  Two of us ate 1/2 the pan and had to restrain ourselves from eating the rest right then!

I made this dish to go with our Easter ham.  As many others have written, the taste is a bit on the bland side.  However, potatoes were perfectly cooked and the creamy consistency of the sauce was great.  If you add a little more salt and/or pepper, it can be very tasty!  I will definitely make this again.

This is a solid basic recipe from which you can explore using other ingredients. I added thinly sliced white onion, pepper and garlic puree between each layer. I did find it slightly bland but I suppose that it's 'just' a side dish and doesn't need to be too racy. Next time I would add more salt, onion and garlic. I'd welcome other reviewers' suggestions on how to rev this up a bit!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish.  I used yukon golds which provided and even creamier flavor.  The only thing I would change next time is using a little less butter.  Otherwise, this is a great side dish!

Absolutely perfect. No need for any extra steps or seasonings. It's creamy and delicious as is. Followed the recipe exactly: 15 minutes at 425, then 45 minutes at 375, and the potatoes were perfectly tender. Great comfort food. Both my husband and I had seconds!

Delicious, just like how my Mom and Grandma used to make it! No need to make a bachamel sauce, it defeats the whole purpose.  I used gluten free flour rather than wheat and it was just fine; rich and creamy.  I did add diced left over ham and some onion powder in the layers.  With a veggie or salad on the side, it's a complete meal. 
 This is major comfort food.

Excellent, very simple, traditional recipe- just like my grandmother used to make. Next time I would add some garlic just because I love garlic. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and left the temperature at 425°. I will definitely make this again, but next time cut the recipe in half. I think this was more like 12 servings, not 8.

I made this recipe close to as is.  Added a touch more spice and almond milk instead of regular milk.  My son cannot have any type of dairy.  I wanted to stay away from the Grotin type recipe, which is similar but with cheese.  This recipe is ment for the cheeseless eaters.  I liked it good enough, but this time it was not my absolute favorite.  I will use Yukon Golds next time.  I used idaho spuds this time.  I cannot use regular butter so we have one that has olive oil, coconut, etc.  It is a great substitute.  We buy it at Whole Foods.

Some how I had a rating typed in here, when I just made it the first time tonight. So good!! I can't say how the rest of my family liked it because the hubby hasn't tried yet and my picky 5 year old is scared if it. Its the delish & classic taste I was looking for!! I think it would also be a great base for an au gratin potato, but aside from possibly adding other seasonings per taste its perfect as it is!

Thank you!  MIL used to make a potato dish like this.  She would tear up pieces of American cheese and layer it on top of the flour.  Very simple, and always good.  I've tried to replicate it and could never get the quantities of flour and milk correct.  I omit the butter and replace it with the American cheese.   A taste of home for my hubby.  Thanks!

Very much like my moms.  Only thing additional she adds is pepper and then once all in the dish she sprinkles some Paprika on top to give it that nice brown coloring on top.

VERY TASTY...made it for Easter dinner, my family loved it.  I added just a little cheese to the sauce and sprinkled some on top.  And we didn't have mayo, so I used 2 Tbs. of plain yogurt...it worked out great!

Used three different potatoes sliced to layer into a pan.  Sprinkled each layer with seasoning salt, garlic powder, and a small amount of flour.  Probably used only 2 T each of flour and butter.  Only added butter to the final layer.  Covered and baked for almost an hour on a cookie sheet.  Glad I did, as it spilled over.  Also used skim milk to 3/4 pan height.  Outstanding, creamy scalloped potatoes.  Great lower calorie option, even without any cheese.  Plan on making many times.

Yummmmmy! Made a roux like other suggested then added 4 cloves of minced garlic. Creamy goodness! I don't normally change recipes and the review- but it was Easter dinner and I just knew the garlic would totally make it:0

I took this to an outdoor party and everyone loved it.  I took the butter four and milk and made a white sauce to pour over and it worked out wonderfully.  I also added sliced onions.  I will definately make this again.

This is great - my mother would make potatoes this way - the only thing that I did was add thinly sliced onions on each potato layer.  Tastes really good reheated.

This gets a five star because it is so easy and very good.  I made just a few changes by adding a little grated cheese and ground pepper on each layer.  I also added an extra layer.  Yummy!

This hit the spot!  I did as others suggested and mixed the flour with the milk prior to pouring.  Also I added sharp cheddar to each layer along with garlic salt, pepper, and the dotted butter.  Just what I was craving.  Thanks!

These were exactly what I was looking for! Just like Mom used to make. As far as seasoning, I only sprinkled a little salt over each layer, then let each one add additional seasoning on their plates. I've only ever used the box kind before, I never realized how simple this is to make. I did let it stand for about 8 minutes before serving though, so the sauce would thicken up just right.
UPDATE: I cut this in half and then forgot the butter which I just tossed on on the top with the milk. I sprinkled osme kosher salt between the potao layers, maybe 1/2 to 3/4 tsp worth total. I ground some black peppercorns over the top. These aren't full of seasoning and spices, just pure potato goodness like Great Grandma used to make. These went perfectly with our steaks!

I was looking for a last minute scalloped potato recipe and stumbled upon this.....mine turned out pretty good.  After the initial "boil" in the oven, I gave it a good stir, and I had no problem with the consistancy.  I did however think that this could use a lot more seasoning....as the recipe states "butter, milk and seasonings", which lists salt....hmmm.  The seasonings that I used were; garlic and onion powders, cayenne, paprika, salt & most importantly white pepper.  Great easy recipe Nancy.

Turned out great. Was looking for a scalloped potatoe recipe like my mom made and helloooo, apparently of the other recipe posters don't get the difference between scalloped potatoes and au gratin. This one did not have cheese, nor should it. Did add pepper and some onion powder, and layered it with ham. Thanks!

I disagree with those who say this is bland!  My husband and I loved this recipe.  We added salt and pepper to taste and a tiny grate of parmesean and they were awesome!  I've never made scalloped potatoes from scratch before, and now that I know how easy it is, I will do it more often!

If I didn't know better I'd swear my mom who is passed on, made this for our dinner. This is exactly like mom used to make! We very much enjoyed this. Has the homemade taste that I've been searching for. We all enjoyed this dish. I added strips of ham and black pepper and it took longer to bake than recipe said, but I may not of made my potatoes as  thin as needed to bake in time recipe calls for. Never the less the baking time didn't bother me. I would suggest placing casserole on baking sheet as it did bubble over in oven a tiny bit. I will be making this again and again.

Delish, family loved them.  I had some leftover ham I added, made this as a dinner with a side salad.  The only thing I did differently was to add a minced clove of garlic and chopped onions to the layered mix.  So easy without a roux!

Method: PERFECT. No need to make a roux; it makes itself! Texture: PERFECT. No onions or other vegetables to get in the way of melt-in-your-mouth potato perfection. Flavor: a little bland, but that's partially my fault... I never use enough salt when salt is "to taste" in a recipe. My recommendation to anyone trying this recipe is to try it EXACTLY AS WRITTEN the first time. Remember that you're salting the potatoes AND the sauce, so don't skimp on the salt. Resist the urge to add cheese (which will make the perfectly creamy sauce greasy), onions, herbs, whatever. I add onions and cheese in some form to just about everything, so trust me when I say to try this without! Now that I've made this once as written, I know to salt more generously next time, and I do think I'd like the flavor of onions without messing with the texture, so I'll probably add some onion powder and maybe some thyme. Happy to have another great recipe with ingredients I always have on hand!

This is perfect as is.  Just like my mom used to make.  I have to say, though, some of these reviews kill me.   We all love tips (make a roux, etc), minor changes or suggestions (add onion or ham), but some of these turn into an entirely different recipe.  I don't find those helpful, I think so many changes to sort through just makes it confusing.

This is the exact recipe made by my mom and her mom before her, and me! The only difference is that we cut Spam into pieces about 1" by 1/2" and layer 1/3 of a large can (or more, if you really like Spam)on top of each layer of potatoes. You could use ham if you don't like Spam.

This is the way I have made scalloped potatoes for years and my mother before me. I don't measure, but I am sure I use more butter than this recipe does. I add crushed soda crackers on top and add milk slowly on the side of the casserole dish until I can see the milk.  I then press down on on the crackers withy hands to make sure they get wet with the milk. If not add a little more milk. This gives a nice golden color and is crusty when done cooking. Make sure you use a deep enough dish, leaving about an inch empty on top of the potatoes and milk. Yes, it is a good idea to put this on a cookie sheet, just to be sure you don't have a mess.  I always cook this at 350 degrees for about an hour. You can check for doneness with a sharp knife.

These are the scalloped potatoes I grew up on!! I never knew it was a recipe. I always thought my mom just assembled to taste and baked. (God rest her soul) This recipe is a find! No onions, no unusual spices, just simple potato flavor. As another writer suggested, I add pepper and once in a rare while I may sprinkle with some mild cheddar shreds before serving. I have been making these for years always getting compliments. This recipe is beautiful as is in form and function-- down home flavor and  goodness!!

RATING THE 10 STARS VERSION: Made exactly - too spicy with both cayenne & black better - sauce is funny beige color and artifical tasting.

Excellent basic recipe. Add smoked turkey, onion, garlic, pepper, salt or seasoned salt and parmesan cheese while cooking. When done, add smoked gouda and put back under the broiler for 5 min to brown. Really, really good.

Perfect potatoes!  Thanks for the prior reviews - I made a roux and that worked out great.  I used yukon golds thinly sliced.  Definitely will be making these again!

Excellent as-is, but really good as a base recipe. Slices Yukon Golds with my mandolin slicer, very thin and used half heavy cream and half 2% milk. I was surprised how buttery and flavorful this turned out. The top pieces were nice and crispy.

Next time, I'll add thinly slices garlic, just 2% milk and perhaps some cheese. Would be great with chives sprinkled on top as well.

I chose to do this recipe as I had tons of potatoes and a lot of milk to use up.  Not too bad considering how few ingredients it uses.  I used garlic salt instead of normal salt otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I like how it doesn't feel greasy or fatty as other scalloped potatoes taste like.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe.

Made these potatoes for Easter dinner and they were a big hit!  I did use the modifications that 072705r mentioned in that review though.  I like a little more flavor in my potatoes and those ingredients appealed to me.

Good potatoes!  My first attempt at scalloped potatoes and they were soooo easy.  I pulled them out about 5 minutes early and sprinkled colby jack on top and put back in to melt on top.
The family loved them...and they are delicious reheated the next day for lunch in the microwave.

This is a TRUE scalloped potatoes recipe. If you add cheese, that changes it to AU GRATIN style. If it is bland adding garlic or garlic powder or more onions and a little black pepper should do the trick.

These are terrifically simple.  I sliced one leek and layered that with the potatoes.  I used whole wheat flour as that seems to thicken up better than regular.  Then topped the whole thing with a good sprinkling of seasoning salt and pork chops.  The only downside is that it boiled over in my oven.  The taste was wonderful.  I will be making this again.

Good starter recipe. I chose this recipe, because it is easy to prepare and baked. Easy to cut recipe in half. We like to add a little onion powder and a pinch more salt and pepper. Good overall.

No need to slice and boil potatoes - just use Homestyle Simply Potatoes - they are perfect! I only needed recipe as a side dish so I used one bag of potatoes, and made a roux using 3Tflour, 3Tbutter, 2 1/4 cup milk, sprinkle of parmesan, and added garlic/onion powder, parsley, celery seed, salt and pepper to taste.  Poured over potatoes in  greased casserole dish. Broil last few minutes to brown. Started as 4, ended up 5

Very bland as is.   The second time I made this; I made a roux, by mixing the flour and 3 TBSP butter in a saucepan and gradually adding the milk (over med heat).  Then I added my seasonings:  1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp sauted onion, 1 tsp fresh parsley, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, 1 tsp ground mustard.  I brought it to a boil and let it simmer while I assembled my pototoes in my casserole dish.  I assembed them by alternating potatoes layers with light layers of cheddar cheese. (Plus this helps the roux get through to each layer).  Then I am finished.  I simply dumped my roux over my potatoes and put in the oven.  It was great.

Like almost everyone, I decided to jazz up this recipe.  I made a roux of the sauce rather than pouring ingredients directly on top (did this by mixing flour, butter and milk into sauce pan on medium heat and then added the following seasonings: onion powder, garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, celery salt, black pepper, salt, parsley, and oregano.) In the last ten minutes of cooking, I added a quarter cup of shaved parmesean cheese, which was nice.  I layered the potatoes as instructing (placing a layer and then pouring the roux on top of each layer).  I cooked at 400 degrees.  The end result was just delicious.  Scrumptious potatoes.  My boyfriend requested the next time I make this that I add bacon.  An intriguing notion, no?  Thanks for the base recipe.

Fantastic!! Way better than the boxed mix I usually use. Well worth the effort involved. I did follow others' suggeations regarding precooking potatoes, addind a few spices, and cooking sauce before layering in pan. I also added some shredded cheddar because that's what my family's used to, but I think they'd have been great even without. Will definitely be making again (and again!)

Delicious!  We'll definitely be making these again.  To save time, I heat the milk in the microwave (essentially scald it) while I assemble the dish.  Tastes exactly like the ones my mom used to make!  I like to add onion powder and black pepper to mine.

This is just like my Mom made, perfect.
I did add 1/2 a large sliced onion, for my own taste. 
Note - I used large, smooth skinned russets, and employed my apple peeler, slicer, corer. I had to cut the potatoes in half crosswise so they would fit, and the time saved was amazing, plus the slices were beautifully uniform. All I had to slice was the 'cores', which only took a few seconds.

If you want to be a little decadent...omit butter and flour and replace milk with heavy cream.  Sometimes I sprinkle a little parmesan cheese between the layers and on top and develop a nice crispy crust.  This mild potato goes great with stronger flavored meat like lamb.

Similar to LINDA MCLEAN: I Added garlic powder, bit of cayenne, dried parsley, salt, pepper and melted butter to a mixture of milk and flour and layered that 3 times between a combination of potatoes, chopped onion and parmesan. Sprinkled some paprika on top. Had to up the cooking time to 1h30m uncovered. Let it sit for a few minutes before serving. Turned out rich and tasty.

This was great.  I did as another reviewer suggested and made a white sauce out of the butter, flour, and milk.  I layered half of the potatoes in a 9 x 13 pan, sprinkled with salt and pepper.  I also added s little sliced onion and some parmesan cheese. Then I poured in half the sause and repeated the layers.  I didn't add quite all of the sauce because it wouldn't all fit in the 9 x 13 pan.  Came out wonderful - a nice golden brown on top and tasted great.

Very nice.  I added pepper and garlic/onion pwd btw layers.  I also mixed in a chicken stock cube into the last cup of milk (can use chicken broth as well).

Easy, good recipe that doesn't require too many ingredients.

This recipe always turns out great for me.  I also add chunks of leftover ham.  I do stir it halfway through cooking and I usually have to cook it longer.

good recipe... the cream mix was a bit greasy though, there was quite a bit of grease on the top of the potatos but other than that these were pretty great! perhaps a bit longer in the oven for euro ovens :)

I agree this is a very easy recipe. I read other reviews before making it and added some sheredded Mozzarella, but it still had a little floury flavor, next time I will make the roux as someone else suggested.

These potatoes are to die for. Instead of using milk I used 3 cups of heavy whipping creme. My family loved them.

1st time for scalloped taters for me and they turned out great!  My only addition was a sprinking of green onions and permesean on each layer, and a little grated cheese, on top, under the broiler for the last 5 mins.  Even better left over!

Mmm  this is a good one!  I took a reviewer's advice and blended the milk and flour first ( added a HALF cup of parmesean and some pepper)
Worth the trouble of slicing and peeling the potatos. Easy cleanup with cooking spray and aluminum foil.

This is good, I do appreciate how easy it was.  I boiled the potatoes for a few minutes so the time baking wouldn't take as long.  I also added Tastefully Simple Dried Tomato and Garlic Pesto seasoning.  Everyone liked it!!!!  The only reason this didn't earn 5 stars from me is because the flour seemed a little thick and gooey in certain areas..The recipe didn't say to stir dish before serving but I would.

I added garlic puree and onions to this recipe and did the roux as suggested (flour, milk, salt & white pepper and butter).  I also added parmesan cheese and mozz cheese in between some layers and had cheddar, mozz and parmesan cheese on the top.  Mmmmm....everyone loved it!

I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. This is a great recipe that you can modify to your own taste. I added lots of pepper, some onion and some ham, and I sifted the flour as was suggested by other reviews. It came out great, and I am NOT a great cook!

I have found this recipe to be very close to the one I remember my German grandmother making when I was little.  I had lost the recipe and in a pinch I used this one!  It did turn out well.  Also, I always use very thinly sliced yellow onion and white pepper and use only sweet cream butter.

Loved these potatoes!  Taste just like my mom's.  We added some cooked bacon and apple cider vinegar the next day to the leftovers for a quick german potato salad (warmed all in a large fry pan).  Turned out great!

This is really close to the way my Mom (and now I) make scalloped potatoes.  I add dried minced onions to my layers along with the flour, salt and pepper.  Also, when I get to the top, after I have added the milk, I sprinkle a little paprika on top of the potatoes.  I make these A LOT!

I loved the way this turned out. I modified it by adding some spices as suggested by other reviews. For 8 person: 1tsp Dry mustard, 2t each of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and salt, 2 pinches of cayenne pepper. Mix together with the flour in a sauce pan. Slowly stir in butter and milk and hit up. Then after layering the potatoes, layer this flour/spice roux mixture over the potatoes. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese, and repeat layering. YUM!

Added 1/4 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp Colmans powdered mustard.  This is a good basic recipe.  May serve with snipped chives and crumbled bacon.

I remember my mom making scalloped potatoes by layering potatoes, flour, butter and then adding milk...this turned out just like I remember and we all loved it. It's so much easier than making a roux. I had no problems with clumping. When it came out of the oven, I stirred it gently to mix the top crunchy layer into the rest and let it sit for a half hour. This will be my new go-to recipe. Both hubby and our 11 year old son went back for seconds.

7.11.17  Using a food processor to slice the potatoes makes this a breeze.  I scaled this down to 4 servings, cooked in an 8x8 dish, and the potatoes were done (even a little overdone) in 30 minutes.  This was so easy and surprisingly good, easy  and quick enough for a weeknight meal (using the food processor, at least).

This assembly technique is the way my mother made her scalloped potatoes and the way I've  been making them for 40+ years. The only difference with mine and my mothers is to layer onions and Spam,...yes spam, between the potato layers. Back when I was a kid spam was cheaper than ham, plus my father had been in WWII, so was used to spam. Anyway, the technique is easy and the results yummy.  Thanks for posting this. It is the only recipe I've seen so far that doesn't call for a beschemel (sp) sauce.

I was looking for a ham and scolloped potato recipe like mom made in the 60's.  This is just like hers.  I did add ham and a small amount of thinly sliced onion.  The onion was not necessary and I probably won't use again.  The sauce was creamy and everything was in the right proportion, Perfect !  I will make this any  time I have ham left over.

I made this as written, scaled down because I didn't have 3 lbs of potatoes, and added onion powder with the salt & pepper layer.  We loved it!  I had no idea scalloped potatoes could be so easy.

Very easy to make.  I did not add other unnecessary steps as some did.  Just make the recipe as written, and you will get a nice basic scalloped potato dish.  I added ham too.

This was exactly what I was looking for when I wanted to make scalloped potatoes!! The only change I made was adding a few slices of onions to the first two layers (because that's how mom always did it!). You do not need to make the sauce separately. The flour and potatoes thicken the milk nicely just as the recipe is written.

This is the way my Mom always made Scalloped Potatoes,  the only thing she would do is add 1 or 2 packages of cooked breakfast sausage links to the potatoes.  Now it is the way I make it also.  It was my favorite dish growing up.  Also it tastes great cold the next day.

the night i made it i had planned to serve it the next day. i tasted it before going in the fridge overnight and it was great with a good creamy buttery taste however the next day was dry :( i was so sad. it was so fun to make. i got to use my food processor to slice the potatoes which i had never done before lol. i spoke with my friend about it since she cooks really well and she told me that potatoes soak up what the are in if leftover. so i guess i would just have to revive them.

These taters are awesome! I added some garlic and onion powder and topped with some shredded cheddar towards the end of cooking. I also used half and half for creamier potatoes, and if you just let liquid get to room temp, no need to adjust cooking time...my guests loved them.

I have been trying to make rich creamy scalloped potatoes for years and I have never been successful until this recipe.   I made the roux as suggested, grated an onion in the layers, salt and pepper, maybe a little leftover cheese and WOW!   This is a perfect comfort recipe--would be great with steaks in the summer, a pot roast in the winter. Thanks for a great recipe!

It's a great, easy recipe and turns out beautifully.  I added garlic and cheese in the layers for my own personal taste and there wasn't a bite left. Definitely a keeper.

I made these last night to go with our smoked pork chops.  I probably shouldn't actually "review" the recipe as I made modifications based on what others said but I did use it as a base recipe as I have never made scalloped potatoes from scratch.  Like others, I made a roux with 1/4 cup of butter (putting in one small chopped onion until translucent.) 1/4 cup flour with some garlic powder, onion powder and the salt and pepper.  For the liquid, I used 3/4 cup chicken stock and about 3 cups of milk and let that all thicken.  I then layered the potatoes and poured the sauce on the first layer adding a sprinkling of parmesan (the green can kind) and continued until done.  I baked them at 425 for 15 minutes and then reduced the heat to 375 and baked for 45 more minutes.  The potatoes were done and the top was somewhat browned and bubbly but next time, I will put them under the broiler for a minute or two to really brown them up.  My family likes them a bit more "crusty" on top.  They WERE good and my family did say they liked them a lot!  I gave the four stars because I made the changes and the fact that I would have liked them more crusty on top.

I made this exactly as written.  It turned out milky like potato soup.  Tasted OK, but definitely not creamy.  I should have made a roux, and I knew it when I did it that it was going to be watery.  Oh, well, we ate it anyway.  I won't make this mistake again.

I found my "keeper" scalloped potato recipe finally- but it wasn't the original recipe, it was 072705r's adaptation - it was perfect. It was thick, creamy, with great flavour- and all easy to make from scratch! Here it is:
4 servings:  5-6 small white potatoes (sliced thin) 1 small onion (diced), 5T flour, 5T butter, 2 and 1/4 c milk, 1/2t pepper, 1/2t dry mustard, 1t each of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and salt, pinch of cayenne pepper and 1/4 c parm cheese. grease 2 quart casserole dish, preheat over 425, make roux in saucepan: melt butter then whisk flour cook one minute until it resembles wet sand, add rest and cook until slight thick.  layer potatoes,  onions,  sauce and then repeat. Top with paprika and parmesean, cook 425 for 5 minutes then 375 for 50 minutes.

I did not care for this recipe. Because of the ratings I made this for Christmas dinner.  Apparently I didn't salt to taste enough.  How should I know how much to salt 3 pounds of potatoes? I'm not going to taste it before it's cooked.  Basically this recipe is potatoes and milk.  Flour and butter don't add much taste.

Made this tonight, and thought it was really, really good!  As per other reviews, I made the butter and flour into a roux, then added the milk and cooked it just until it started to get thick.  (I used unsalted butter, and added a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash to the sauce since my mother is on a low-sodium diet.)  Topped it with cubes of lower-sodium ham and flakes of Parmesan cheese and baked as directed. The creamy, rich flavor really surprised me!

I was yearning for good old-fashioned scalloped (and NOT AU GRATIN) potatoes so I halved the recipe to make for DH and myself. As did many reviewers before me, I made a roux white sauce instead of pouring the milk on top last.  I also used olive oil instead of butter and added garlic and onion powder, dry mustard, pepper, and freshly grated parmesan to the sauce.  The dish was excellent with just the right consistency and no canned soup taste. I'm a potato lover, and this recipe lets you taste and enjoy the texture of the potatoes.  I highly recommend you slice the potatoes with a mandolin or food processor, as very thin and uniformly thick slices of potatoes work best.  This recipe has the perfect proportions of potato, flour and liquid and you can season it to make it your own.  Thanks, Buchko, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Scalloped potatoes complimented an Easter ham dinner. Great suggestions from the other users! Made the goop ahead of time in a roux. Also added fresh parsley and chives along with diced onions. Perhaps the next time try it with a cup of sour cream...?

Buchko this is perfect as is, but I'm a bacon hound so like my mother always did I topped it with a few strips of the good stuff.  I'd never had the instructions or measurements written down before, always eyeballed it like Mom did but with the exact same ingredients.  I used your recipe and they were almost exactly the same!  Thank you for taking the time to measure, it is a lot easier recommending your recipe for them to try, rather than trying to explain what a couple of handfuls of flour looks like! lol  Bravo on the perfect recipe, Buchko!!

I used a few more seasonings than what is listed in the recipe: pepper, garlic powder, minced onion, and parsley flakes. I personally like a bit more seasoning on my potatoes, but I followed the directions as written. They took about 50 minutes to finish, and they were completely worth it. I would make these again any and again.

A deliciously simple recipe for basic (and tasty!) Scalloped Potatoes.  I didn't have to add or change a thing, other than it took forever for the milk to boil (I poured it straight from the fridge) so I wound up cranking the heat to 475 until it boiled, than lowered to 425 and started checking for doneness after 30 minutes.  These were a BIG hit at Christmas dinner, my husband said they tasted just like his grandmother's.  I'll be making these again.

Excellent! Only change was I added some fresh ground pink peppercorns. The flavor from this simple combination of ingrdiants was so rich and tasty. Easy recipe to follow for such a great result. Other flavorings really are not necessary.

I really liked how the potatos turned out.  The recipe was super easy and turned out very tastey.  I sprinkled cheddar cheese ontop of it at the last 10 mins of the baking time, perfect. I would recommend this recipe to anyone, but I also did add onion poweder like others suggested, and some sliced up onions.

I used seasoning salt between all the layers, one pass of onion powder on the top, a little sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese in the middle layer and topped it with a thin layer of cheddar the last 15 minutes of baking.  Fabulous, even my husband who is never impressed with anything loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

I followed the directions and added salt and pepper but still this dish was very bland. My husband likes fairly bland things though so he thought they were good. Personally, I'd rather move on and try a different recipe than make this one again. Thanks anyway though.

Yummy!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I've never made scalloped potatoes before and it was so easy!  I kept mixing the potatoes while they were cooking and added parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup + about 20 min after I put it in the oven.

Using half the milk, I made a roux first, put some left over ham in there as well as onion, garlic, pepper and layered it in between the potatoes. Then I poured the rest of the milk over it. Sooo good!

I took reviewer Melissa Evans' advice & made the roux and added it to the milk & poured it over the potatoes, and add the herbs & spices that she did and it was VERY good.  There was about one helping left after the 3 of ate!

Very good. Added a bit of Colby Jack cheese to the top before it was done. My 6 yo daughter dont like scalloped potatoes from the box, but after I mashed these ones up on her plate she scarfed them down no questions asked. Wonderful dish!

Nice and simple. I made these 2 different ways. I followed the recipe exactly and mdae them as they are stated and I also made them w/ onions sliced between the layers and topped with shredded cheese. OF course the cheese added to the richness of the dish ,but both ways it was good.

with a little bit of tweaking, this was wonderful!  the recipe given is a little bland, so to add some flavor i added parmesan cheese to the mixture.  then, once it started browning on top (less than 10 min left to bake) i sprinkled some more cheese on top. delicious!

If you are looking for good old fashioned taste, this is it! The only thing I did differently was I used evaporated milk instead of regular, and I used fresh cracked pepper.

Made this last night.  Parboiled the tators to cut down on cooking time and premade made the roux on the stove top--cooked in the oven about 20-30 minutes.  Wasn't thrilled with the outcome so I added some cheese. My daughter and her boyfriend thought they were pretty good but no one came back for seconds, and they suggested adding bacon.  Hubby just looked at me and said isn't it cheaper and easier to buy the box stuff?  With the cheese added I thought they were okay, but nothing special.  I appreciate the recipe but probably won't make again.

Good starting off point. I added sour cream, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and cut the milk down about enough to cover the entire dish after adding the other ingredients. also i layered cheddar cheese between the potatos. next time i might add parmesan and bread crumbs to the top to get a nice crust.

Delicious! I topped each layer of potatoes with a roux and a few shakes of paprika, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, diced onion and parmesean cheese..then poured milk until it was 3/4 full. I followed the oven times exactly. Perfect crisp edges and tops..so good!!!

I had to travel with these. . . much of the moisture disappeared over the 1 hour commute. Next time, I'll use more of the wet ingredients.

5 for presentation. I used the country hashbrowns with onions and peppers and everyone seemed to really like it. Fresh parsley is also a nice addition and I added garlic and a few other spices as others suggested

make the roux with butter/flour and add milk.  Heat again and add 1/2 cup parmesan.  I used glass flat casserole only 2 layers of potatoes.  425 until milk boils and turn to 350 for 45 minutes.

This is a delicious, healthy, and easy recipe. I added milk to each layer instead of just putting it on last. Also, you can add whatever meat or other ingredients you want.

I took these potatoes to a get together. They were gone in minutes, and they were delicious. I wish that I had read the reviews before I made this recipe though. Next time I'll definately take the advice of others and mix the flour and milk together first. It was a little messy making sure the flour was moistened after it'd already been layered.

I thought this recipe was a little bland, and I even followed a few other reviewer suggestions to pep it up, including: (1) I added freshly grated parmesan cheese to each layer, (2) I sprinkled powdered garlic in addition to S&P on each layer. I did like how the potatoes cooked to a nice brown color and were crispy on top, but the bottom potatoes were a bit "muddy" in the flour mixture. If I make this recipe again, I will add more spices and a little less flour.

These were pretty good, but they didn't get the "Wow!" that I was hoping for.  I did add salt, pepper, garlic powder and seasoning salt in between layers.  I mixed half of the milk with the flour and stirred halfway through, as others recommended.  The consistency was great.  Next time, I think I'll add more spices and/or some cheese to achieve a more flavorful result.

I was in the process of making these potatoes for the first time alongside a meatloaf I hadn't made in a few years when company stopped by. I thought the meal was a semi-disaster. Burnt meatloaf and scalloped potatoes that were lumpy and too salty. However...

I give this four stars because I think most of it was my own fault. My mother recommended that I mix the flour and milk beforehand, but I decided to follow the recipe. I also decided to buy sea salt as opposed to my usual kosher salt at the grocery store today. I should have adjusted my measurements. My boyfriend like them. I don't know about my guest. The taste was there, mind the salt, and the thickness of the sauce was perfect. I also added some grated parm to the layers. Otherwise, it was easy to prepare.

My mother's scalloped potatoes were one of my favorite dishes, but she was one of those old-time Southern cooks who never measured, never used a written recipe, and we've been trying for 50 years to duplicate it with no success.

This is it, and just as good as I remembered! Many thanks, Nancy.

I would say this recipe is only a 3 star, as written, but it is a great base recipe. I actually combined this recipe with another one on this site and they turned out great. For me, this recipe is a little bland. I added a little grated cheddar cheese between the layers along with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I also topped it for the last 30 minutes of cooking with more cheddar. I mixed my flour with the milk to prevent lumps. Great recipe to play around with!

This was a little messy while cooking, but well worth the mess...it was delicious! I usually put tinfoil on the bottom of my oven anyway. I'll definately make it again, but may spray the baking dish with Pam next time.  Great recipe!

Excellent suggestion to boil the milk. I think that's what's been missing from my potatoes every time I try to make them. These turned out just like grandma's. Also added cheddar cheese on the middle and top layers of mine - Yummy!

Absolutely delicious!!  It reminds me of the kind my mother used to make...not the quick fixes with canned soups.  I added ham but otherwise followed the recipe directly.  This is a staple at our house from now on!

Made this with Christmas dinner.  The milk boiled over the edge to bottom of oven.  I added onion and thought it was still bland.

This is a great basic recipe.  It seems you could add different ingredients to flavor it different ways (i.e. garlic, cheese, etc.)  I added both garlic and cheese and it was very good.  It was a little bland, but that's because it needed more salt.  I plan to make this again and experiment with it a little.  I did follow the suggestion to sift the flour and mine didn't turn out lumpy at all - it was very creamy and buttery.

Great Recipe!!!  The fussiest eater of my household (husband) was happy!  I added onions and on my second time around I cut back on the flour (as per request from the fussy eater but I thought it was fine either way).  Easy and Yummy!

These were absolutely fantastic.  I added a bit of seasoning as suggested and they came out terrific.  My picky daughter loved them!  The potatoes thicken nicely if left to sit for a few minutes.  5 stars and a definite keeper.    kate

This recipe is delicious.  I have dreaded cooking
scalloped potatoes because of the length of
time it took to prepare.  This is so easy and
taste like it took a long time to prepare.
I was afraid that the flour would be lumpy in 
the potatoes, but this was not a problem.
This is definitely going into my recipe keepers
box.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Added chicken. Good, but I ended up with dry flour on the top, so next time, I'll mix the flour with the milk.

A very nice place to start with and make better.  Much as my mother‘a recipe but she always put pork chops on top. Just spice it up a little.  Garlic, salt, pepper, onions premo dinner on the table.

It was very good right out of the oven. I included some leftover baked ham.  However,  I made too much for just the two of us and decided to freeze the leftovers.  Reheated frozen scalloped potatoes are not good, though.

Best scalloped potatoes!  I was looking for a recipe that tasted like my mother used to make and found this one in 2013.  Sometimes I layer in thinly sliced onion otherwise make exactly as described.  Delicious with pork chops or ham!

I added some thin sliced white onion and some diced ham left over form Easter as this is how Mom made it when I was a boy. It's pretty good. I'd consider some sharp cheddar on top as well. Adding the shredded cheese last final 15 mins of baking.

This was really good and easy to prepare.  I shared the oven with a roast pork and had to adjust the temp and cooking time.  Cooked at 350 for about 1.5 hours.  This would also be good to add cheese to each layer.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but forgot to layer the butter in while stacking.  So at the end I pushed the diced up pieces into the mix.  I also added a layer of thinly sliced onions to the layers.  Also, I added a little half and half to the milk at the end.  Delicious!  Absolutely perfect!

The only change I made was using 2% instead of whole milk and it still turned out fantastic! I would recommend adding additional spice to each layer, as the potatoes were creamy, but a bit bland. Otherwise, I have no qualms!

Great base recipe but followed others’ advice and added spices: garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, paprika,  and a pinch of thyme. Made a roux and added in the spice blend before layering among the potatoes

Pretty good— I followed the advice in other reviews and added garlic powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, and a little cayenne to taste. I also baked it with a layer of Parmesan cheese, and made a white sauce first of the other ingredients rather than adding them raw.

I cut the portions back to 4 but otherwise I made this as written.   The end product is nice and creamy but it needs onions, I found it a tad bland.

Very nice recipe, I was also concerned about it being a little bland. I added some garlic and chives.  Turned out nice.  I was only making this for 3 people , so i used 5 potatoes and cut back on the rest.

After reading the reviews I made a simple white sauce using  7 T flour and butter and added a quart of whole milk. I added leftover ham and  baked for 1 hour and 40 minutes.  Delish!

Followed recipe as directed with the exception of adding more seasonings.  The final result was bland watery slop.  ended up baking an additional 30 minutes.  Would not make again primarily due to no flavor.

Made as directed. Just fine. For those who thought it was too bland, you may want to add some finely chopped onion to the layers, as my old recipe suggests

The first time I made this, I followed the instructions exactly. The second time I added a half of a yellow onion diced small. Both times these were so good, although I preferred the addition of the onion. I took the second casserole to a church potluck, and it got rave reviews. By the way, there is no need to make a roux. The sauce was creamy and delicious just by following the instructions. I didn't have a mandolin so I used the side of a box grater that has slots for slicing. It worked nicely.

Very good basic recipe.  Made exactly as written and my husband and I enjoyed them very much.  Made this recipe for the second time and used Lawry's season salt instead of plain salt. I thinly sliced an onion and sprinkled them  between the potato layers. I used half-n-half instead of milk and left out the butter.  Wow! Very good, very flavorful.  There are so many vaiations and additions that can work well with this recipe - O, the Possibilities!

I changed almond milk for the milk. I put 1/2 the amount of butter. I put garlic powder along with pepper. I put no salt due to I am trying to cut down on sodium for health reasons. I felt that it was bland and was missing something. Maybe the salt. It turned out okay.

Very easy recipe for scalloped potatoes.  I made it for Christmas with a little cheese added.  Turned out yummy! I'm making this with ham tonight.  I love that all recipes allows us to adjust the number of servings and it automatically adjusts the recipe!  Would definitely recommend  this recipe to family and friends.

This was super easy & tasted great. Used a mandolin to slice potatoes lickety-split. Layered everything but forgot flour, face palm! I just sprinkled it on top, stirred it up then smoothed it back down and it came out fine. I used 1% milk, no problem there either.  Also, I always use white pepper with potatoes. Looks & tastes better IMO.  This is an *easy* alternative to mashed potatoes and looks way more impressive. Thx for sharing :-)

I added onions to the recipe.  I sauteed the onions in the butter; added the milk, and flour.  The sauce was too thick.   Next time, I'll lower the proportion flour to milk.  2 tablespoons of flour to 1 1/4 cup milk will make it less thick.

So good!  Creamy yet with crispy edges here and there.  I forgot to turn it down after the first 15 minutes so it cooked at 425 degrees for an additional 15 minutes.  This gave some of the edges above the milk a nice crispy crunch, a great contrast to the creaminess.  Here are my tweaks, which I'll definitely do again:
I layered leftover ham, cut into bite-sized pieces, over the potatoes, then sprinkled  1 tbsp. dried minced onion between the layers, along with 2 tbsp. parmesan cheese. I also sprayed any dry spots of flour with cooking spray to soften the flour.   With 15 minutes left I added 3/4 c. shredded cheddar, though gruyere or swiss would have been delicious, too. 
I used only two layers of potatoes instead of three. It was perfect for two people...I had two servings it was so good! (That left 3 for my husband!) 
Next time, instead of adding ham, I'd like to try a smoked sausage or kielbasa.

I can't give an accurate  rating because I followed the highest rated comment's suggestions which COMPLETELY changed the  recipe.  Anyway, if you make it with the roux with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, etc. - it's excellent!

My star rating is for the original recipe as written. It was okay, but nothing spectacular, a bit bland for me. The second time I made it, I used the same milk to flour to potato ratio, but I made the flour and milk into a white sauce and added nutmeg, lots of salt and pepper, and a dash of dry mustard. I layered potato, onion, and sauce four times, sprinkling each layer of potatoes with a dash of seasoned salt. I finished it off with a bit of leftover mozzarella cheese over the top. Baked in the oven at 425 covered until bubbly and soft, then uncovered until browned. My recipe was head and shoulders better than the original recipe, but I did use their wet to dry ratio to keep mine on track. I highly suggest spicing this up a bit, and making a white sauce out of the butter, flour, and milk so it comes out very smooth.

I will definitely be making this again! I did decide to add some more seasonings to the top layers - garlic salt, paprika etc, - and I wish I had added more throughout to spice it up a bit. Still very good plain, my husband and I just like things spicy..

I've made this twice now to see if tweaking things a bit changed my opinion. It was ok, but I'll use a different recipe next time. For me the top potatoes got dried out and tough since the sauce condensed too much. Easy simple and quick though.

I followed Melyssa Evan's review...boiled sliced potatoes for 5 minutes and had to run a bit of cold water over them so I could layer them.  Made the roux with added garlic, layered with onions, paprika, parsley and parmesan.  Only cooked at 425 for 7 minutes then covered and dropped temp to 350 (convection oven).  Broiled the cheese on top and will definitely make again. Boiling made all the difference.  Every potato was cooked!

I've made it a few times following the recipe but it was bland. This time I added half a large sweet onion, diced, 3 small garlic cloves, minced, two handfuls of diced cooked ham and some chopped broccoli florets half way through the layering. I had some cheddar I found in the back of the fridge and sprinkled that throughout as well. (All food that I found scattered in the fridge I needed to use up) I don't use "drinking" milk in my cooking  so I used some dry milk that I have prepared for recipes like this.  No need to put anything else on the table. It was a great meal!

I've been making this recipes for years and it's delicious!  I read a long time ago that instead of making the flour and milk and butter into a sauce, you can layer the potatoes with onions, butter, seasonings and top it off with milk and they are just as good as other more work intensive recipes.  I'm making this tonight and I have confidence it will turn out fine (as long as the milk doesn't boil over into my stove! lol).  I actually don't use exact measurements and sometimes get too much milk so it boils over. Be careful of this. I usually put a pan underneath to catch any spills.

This was a good scalloped potato recipe. After taking the potatoes out of the oven, I let the potatoes cool for about 10-15 minutes and that way the potatoes were not so runny. I did add some shredded cheese because my family loves cheese on their scalloped potatoes.

I think if the flour was cut back to 6 Tbsp instead of 9 it might be better but it tasted more like gravy. I'll make it again but do some of my own changes.

This was better the second time I made it. I took off a star because it was relatively bland without following other reviewers advice. I made a roux (butter + flour; cook for a minute before adding milk), then added additional spices before pouring on top of potatoes and baking in the oven. Additions included 2 tablespoons minced onion, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper. I also added 2 tablespoons gorgonzola cheese (because I was trying to use up what I had). Baked it approximately 25 minutes, then sprinkled 2 tablespoon of parmesan on top and baked for an additional 20-25 minutes. Delish!

I followed the recipe as described, but sprinkled some parmigiano reggiano on top with some green onions.  No other myriad of changes or additions.  They turned out really well.  Nice and soft and full of delicious potato flavour!  Will make again!

SO GOOD.  My changes, and I think it would've been good without... I used heavy cream because, well, I'm just that kind of girl.  Also, I added a very thin layer of sliced cheese, sliced at the deli counter - that kind of thin, at each layer (for a total of 3 layers, ending with cheese on top).  The first time, I did a combo of swiss and provolone.  The 2nd time, I used all very strong swiss.  That was not as good.  Next time I'll use all baby swiss (or go back to the combo).  Also, with the cheese on top, it probably got more brown, more quickly.  It wasn't  too bad but just  be warned that it will happen and it should be done cooking before it gets too brown.  If it's getting too brown and it's still not done, cover with foil.  I wouldn't cover with foil to begin with because 1) it's probably not necessary and 2) it may throw off the cooking time more than is worth it.

I modified this by adding onions and roasted garlic (two bulbs) and by using 5% cream instead of milk.

I made this in part for a New Year's Eve dinner and shredded Champagne Cheddar on top, then sprinkled with italian style bread crumbs. It was a hit!

Sometimes simplicity is best. This is a delicious, but simple recipe. The only addition I add (which is a very nice addition) is some chopped fresh thyme. Thyme really seems to be a perfect pairing with this.

I have also made this recipe using some kohlrabi in place of 1/3 of the potatoes. Basically 1st layer potatoes (then the flour/butter/salt/pepper) then 2nd layer kohlrabi slices (ditto), then third layer potatoes, etc. Yum!

I added thinly sliced onion as well and layered that in with the potatoes. I also started with a roux, added the milk, salt and pepper, a little garlic powder and layered that instead of putting flour in separately. It got great reviews with the potluck!

I added thin sliced onions to all the layers and used olive oil instead of butter. Simple and fantastic all at once! I also put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to brown the top a bit.

2 things I learned when trying to make this recipe. I couldn't put the cold dish in the hot preheated oven. It broke and all the ingredients spilled all over my oven!! So the 2nd time I made it I didn't turn the oven on until the dish was in there. And when the milk starts to boil it spilled all over the oven and started smoking and set off the smoke alarm. So I put the cooking dish on a cookie sheet.

Wonderful!! I made it as per original recipe the first time . It was very good but I was jonesing for onion flavor , So the second time I added thinly sliced onions a bit of granulated garlic and a grated a few swipes of nutmeg on each layer ( maybe 1/4 - 1/2 tsp all together ) I know nutmeg might sound odd but it's the layer of flavor in any great white sauce that makes it great. A sprinkling of paprika on top and it was perfect.

Tastes better than it looks.  Mine curdled... I didn't have milk but had a qt of half and half (that shouldn't have made a difference but the richness)... Other than that, followed the directions exactly.  We enjoyed it though but might try a different recipe next time.

Loved the it's a basic recipe. And I'm trying to out right now, with some changes.

I mixed black pepper with garlic powder and parmesan cheese. Sprinkled that on most of the layers. Missed the flour on most of them ( oops. ) Skipped the mix on a middle layer were I had the flour and grated cheddar . Old for more flavor.

On the top before adding stuff on potatoes I poured in the milk, had to use a bit of water to get enough. Then put more flour the last of the spices and more cheddar.

About an hour later we finally get to eat my first try at scallop potatoes. They where really good. Should of payed better attention to how much pepper went into the spice mix as there was too much. But it wasn't super saucy like my mom's would be and the potatoes were nice and soft. Yummy!

I made this tonight for my husband and I just as written except that I cut the recipe in half for the two of us. We absolutely loved it and it was so much less labor intensive than my usual cooking potatoes and making a roux recipe. It was easy to pare this down for us and will go into my "Meals For Two" file in my recipe box. I will be making these for family dinners when our kids come to eat with us. We are already excited to have this dish again. I might just add ham or chicken the next time.

I like this recipe because my hubby watches his cheese intake.  This tastes like the original that Grammy made!  I sprinkle chopped green onions and Montreal steak seasoning with each layer and then mixed some Dijon mustard with milk.  Delicious!

Add some thinly sliced onions and grated sharp cheddar cheese to each layer - delicious. This is how my mother made them.

I have always made scalloped potatoes this way. First time I've seen a recipe printed the way it should be made---Not making a "roux" of the flour! I do add chopped onion and some slices of velveeta cheese. And if you want to make complete meal add some diced ham and lima beans to the layers. THX

Yes! Tastes just like mom's!!! I am so thrilled to have found this recipe. There's only three of us so I use an 8"x 8" dish. I peel about 6 medium russet potatoes and then thinly slice them. I boil them for 5 mins in the meantime make a roux and then add the milk. I use a generous T of both garlic and onion powder and a generous amount of black pepper and sea salt. Bake at 375 for half hour and they are bubbling and browned on top. Absolutely delicious and perfect!!!

I made this low carb using Carbquick and Calorie Countdown fat free and rutabagas instead of potatoes and it turned out great - I did add more fresh herbs that this didn't call for, but I think if you use this recipe as a "base" and build on it you'll be good.

I followed other suggestions to make them more flavorful.  However, next time I will thin the sauce a bit more.  Had to add more milk after I added the fact.

OMG these are amazing,  the only change I made was I put 2 tbls of flour and added some raw green onions. It is still creamy but with a bit of a crunch from the onions.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's either the same recipe I found in a Betty Crocker cookbook years ago, or it's very similar.  Whichever, it's what I've used for years.  I like not having to make a milky sauce to pour over the potatoes, and I love that it doesn't use cheese. The only thing I did differently from the recipe is throw in some chopped green onions, but that's because I had a few that weren't going to last much longer, and I not only was not going to let them go to waste, but I love green onions with potatoes - so sometimes I add them to my scalloped potatoes and sometimes I don't.  Thanks for the recipe - I'd lost mine a few years ago!

BORING...the liquid did not get absorbed while baking.  Too runny and even though I seasoned at each layer, it was milk potatoes.  I made a 2md batch at the same time, I did what others recommended and I made a roux of the wet ingredients and added parmesan cheese.  That one came out great.

I used about 2.5 lbs of medium sized Yukon Golds.  Peeled and mandolin'ed into #2 setting slices.  Added butter, flour, salt, pepper and gruyere to each layer.  Used whole milk and topped with cheese which browned very quickly.  Took this out for a bit while Ham continued to roast.  Ham out, Potatoes back in for 30 minutes--superb.  Also made a delicious creamed spinach and alton brown's city ham.  Hubby raved and had LARGe seconds.

This recipe turned out creamy and tasty. It didn't specify the amount of salt and mine turned out a little flat. We ended up adding some at the table. Next time I'll add a little onion or garlic but that's it. Good recipe!

Exactly what I grew up with, with the exception of a light sprinkle of paprika/salt/pepper with each layer, versus seasoning slices in the beginning.  Perfect side dish that is mild, yet still tasty!

These were definitely delicious as...well...potatoes and cream in just about any combination are good! I did find that they seemed like they were missing something in the taste department. I think that adding some gruyere or cheddar cheese between the layers would have added a really nice touch. My family did still give a "thumbs up" on these when I served them at Christmas dinner.

I made these exactly as the recipe states. They were very good. My family did expect the dish to contain cheese though and seemed to really miss that flavor so next time I will make a cheesey potatoe  recipe. Gotta give 'em what they love!

Made this today... I made the roux with onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I poured it over the potatoes and then lightly sprinkled some paprika and grated parm cheese on top. Baked it in the oven on 400 for about a half hour and then 350 for another 20 minutes till it was golden brown on top. Hubby and I thought it was great!  I will definitely make it again!

Recipe exactly as written is extremely bland.  Really needs to be spiced up with some seasonings.

My scalloped potatoe curse is still with me. Just cant seem to get them right. I added onion and diced ham to this recipe, it was ok, it would really help to know how much salt to add, I didnt put nearly enough in and it was kind of bland. Added cheese between layers and on top. My milk seperated on me though and while they didnt taste bad, they werent aesthetically appealing.
My bad probably

Hi - This is exactly like my mother's recipe - I made it and used a mandolin to get the potato slices very thin and uniform - also my mother always added breakfast sausages (maple flavor) 12 oz package, you cut each sausage into 3 pieces and add them to each layer - if you have some shredded cheddar cheese hanging out in your freezer this is a great addition in the layers and on top.  this makes a great side or whole comfort meal.

So, so easy to make and delicious. I added onions and used Lactose free milk. I did have to cook the dish at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, not 5 minutes, before turning the oven down to 375 degrees.

I have to admit that I hate when people rate a recipe that they've adjusted the first time they make it, but I'm doing it anyway. I made these potatoes tonight following the adjustments suggested by Melyssa Evans (minus parmesan, only because I didn't have it). The dish was awesome with the revisions, and having attempted scalloped potatoes in the past, I think the original was a good base, but I would have needed extra spice. The proportions, though, are what matters, as they are an excellent base and could probably take on any of your favorite potato fixings.

this is almost exactly how my boyfriend's mother makes them, she just doesnt measure the ingredients out, and she adds pepper with the salt in the layers. A very easy and very yummy hearty side dish. The ONLY thing I would probably do different is to add a little chopped onion and/or garlic to the layers.

This is a great recipe but as others have said, it's a bit bland and missing something when done.  We added paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder.  That helped a bit though next time I might try adding real onions and a bit less milk.  We also added Velveta Cheese and will try shredded cheddar next time.  I might add another spice as well.

Good basic recipe but lacked a little flavor.  I would add some cheddar cheese and some chopped green onions next time.  Maybe some sprinkles of onion powder if I didn't have real onions.  Overall, a great way to use up the bag of potatoes sitting on my pantry floor!

Very tasty.  I did use almond milk instead because I am lactose intolerant, and added a small onion diced very small, but it turned out very well.  The only thing I will change for next time is to blend the flour and milk first, because there were still some flour clumps between some of the layers.

This seems like a good base or rough outline recipe but no way would it be ok on its own. All bland ingredients. Like others suggested, I made a roux but I included garlic in mine. I then alternated layers of potatoes with the roux, prousciutto, asiago and parmesan cheeses. I poured about a half a cup of heavy cream over the top and about a 1/4 cup of melted butter over the top. I then topped it with bacon crumbles and more parmesan and asiago.   This is terrible for your health, but it was delicious for a once a year meal such as Easter dinner.

This recipe is delicious. Many people complain about the blandness, which can easily come from a basic recipe with just potatoes.. but in the description of this recipe, it states that it is pure potato, which I LOVE! However.. my husband doesnt care for the basic potato flavor.. so here is what I did: I pre-boiled 6 medium potatoes for about 5 minutes. I Heated the milk and the butter in a frying pan, then wisked in my flour, one tbsp at a time. I let that boil until it was slightly thickened. Then I added bits of sliced ham (DELICIOUS). I thinly sliced 2 potatoes, then poured 1/3 of the sauce. Then repeated to make 3 layers. Because I pre-boiled the potatoes, it cuts your cooking time by a great deal. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. It is delicious. This recipe is great the way it is, but is also great if you add a couple tiny things. Thanks so much to BUCHKO!! What a wonderful recipe!

I used this recipie as a jumping off point because ive never made home made scalloped potatoes before.  I also liked the idea of making a roux.  I didnt measure the ammounts i used, i just  eye balled it but i added salt pepper a dash of curry and a bit more butter.  I also added diced onions, because i already had them diced in my fridge and they needed to be used.  Anyway, I made this ahead of time in a deep 9x9 casserole dish (i would recommend the 9x13 this recipie suggests, i just wanted to use my 9x9 because it was new :) )  I headed it until bubbly at 425 then lowered it to 350 to let it cook for another 40mins or so.  It was ok, needed a bit more salt.  Next time I will probably add some extra seasonings, but I am glad i never have to buy boxed scalloped potatoes again.  Next time I make these ill throw a handfull of chedder into the sauce to make them au-gratin.  These heated up in hte microwave fabulously.

I tried this recipe because I was out of cream, but wanted scalloped potatoes.  I have now learned my lesson- this was just gross.  Once you've had scalloped potatoes made with cream and cheese, nothing else can compare.

Made this recipe for dinner last night. Like many other reviewers, I was looking for a recipe like my Mom used to make. This was pretty close. Like her, I added ham to the layers and it came out very good. Thickened up as it sat on the stove. I also made a smaller pan with cheese, for my son. I liked it much better without the cheese. I will definitely make again.

I'll give this recipe 5 stars for technique only, not flavor.  Had I not read the review comments before hand, I would have been disappointed with the bland flavor.  You really need to kick this recipe up a notch with some spices in order to delight your taste buds.  I followed 072705r 's 11/5/07 recommendation by adding pepper,  dry mustard, garlic and onion powder, paprika and salt, cayenne pepper and Parmesan cheese.  While the base recipe may be good for children, the additional spices really gave this dish the wow factor most adults appreciate.  Thanks 072705r!!

This was a wonderful and easy recipe!  My family devoured the entire thing during one dinner.  The only thing I added was shredded cheddar cheese to the top during the last five minutes of cooking.

I didn't add anything and they were great!  My 4 year old ate them up!  Loved the browning on the top, delicious!  I thickened the milk, butter, and flour in the microwave ahead of time, then layered with potatoes for about 45 minutes in 375 degree oven.

grest basic scallop potato recipe. I will use this often and is easy to jazz up. Added ham and mushrooms to make it a one pan meal. Like the others I made a roux first.

Perfect scalloped potatoes!  Do not waste your time with those recipes calling for canned creamed soups.  Way too much sodium in them,  This recipe turns out perfect!  Creamy, great flavor, and no layer of uncooked dry flour.  Perfect!

I followed all the previous input to this recipe (making a roux and adding more zest) and the potatoes turned out great.  I may have cooked the "roux" a bit too long (it was very thick), so I just poured in some more milk.  I added a fair amount of seasoning and it could have used more - there are so many potatoes, don't be afraid to be generous with the spices.

Very yummy. I made a roux with 2 1/2C milk, 9T flour, 5T butter, added minced garlic, 1/4 tsp ground pepper, about 1/2C Parmesan and poured between every layer of potatoes. I will definitely make this again, my hubby loved it!

These were the first scalloped potatoes I ever made!  I used a ton of the suggestions though.  I by making a roux and adding a ton of seasoning.  Salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and cayenne pepper.  The first time the seasoning was perfect - the second time I added too much cayenne and had spicy scalloped potatoes.  Also, I still need to figure out cooking time, I need more time than they recommend - it probably varies based on thickness of the potatoes.  I recommend this highly with changes!

Made this recipe exactly as is and was VERY bland (and I could taste the flour a lot).  next time I will add some more flavor, onions or garlic, needs more flavor.

Really good recipe.  After reading the reviews I thought to give it a try.  I took some advice and tried the whole roux idea.  Seemed to work.  Although (might be my oven) came out really liquid on the bottom, yet totally crunchy on top.  My husband found there was not much taste, so had a few spices to it ( think he put tabasco...he's a little odd with food.)  Otherwise, it's a good one to try, and will seriously think about trying it again.

Made this for Jourdin's birthday, and everyone loved. Takes about 1.5 hours to bake, needed to add a can of evaporated milk as it was a little drid looking even though covered with foil.

Very good recipe!....I did the Roux thing and added just a little salt, pepper and garlic and they were just wonderful! I also liked the nice size it made, had a little leftover and they were just as delicious today!
Thank's Nancy ;)

This recipe is failproof and is the perfect starting point for great scalloped potatoes. I have made this recipe a few times and it's turned out great each time. I took the advise of other reviewers and pumped up this dish with salt, cayanne peper, thyme and garlic.

I can't recommend this recipe because of the flour content.  I mixed the flour, warm milk, some salt, pepper and red pepper in the blender to avoid the lumpy flour problems.  Unfortunately the floury taste was so prevalent and the dish generally so bland that I would not make it again.

These are really good -- though they are a little bland exactly as the recipe is written (I have only made them as written).  Maybe next time I'll play with some additions to add a bit to it.  REALLY good base though.  I LOVE that it's all from scratch.

Thanks, this is so easy. I did add onions, bacon and velveeta cheese. I always fry extra bacon each time I make it and freeze the extras, so I have it ready to add to recipes like this.

These were tasty, but they lacked appeal.  I would never serve guests w/ this.  Why did mine turn out w/ lumps?!  I'll look for another recipe that comes out smoother, but has the same flavor.

I'm pushing 2 stars on this recipe.  I scaled it down to 4 servings, added garlic power, some cheese, lots of salt and pepper and it was still bland.  I cooked it longer than required and the potatoes were still hard.  I'm very disappointed.

The flour made this dish taste like egg cooked with potatoes. Didn't like it.

I whisked the flour and milk together before adding them to the potatoes, but still felt like the texture was a little gluey and not as creamy as I would have liked.  Pretty good flavor, though, especially with some chives added.

This is the same recipe that my mom used and I have tried this several times, but can't seem to get it to taste like my moms. She did butter the casserole dish and sliced the potaotes very thin. She didn't boil the milk before, just poured it over the top as the last layer. She also put tinfoil over the top and baked it in the oven. It is possible for some of the potatoes to still be firm even after the full cooking time. Mom said that has happened to her at times.

This recipe is just very bland.  The texture was fine because I used Wondra flour, which is a very fine flour that won't 'lump' found in the flour section in a blue and white container, but even so, I whisked the flour in with the milk to make sure I didn't get any flour settling.  I will try this again using it as a base adding onions, garlic salt, and pepper.  I also will precook the potatoes slightly.

Yummy and easy.  I added some ham and onions which gave it a real nice flavor.  I will make this again for sure.

If you are patient and don't mind cleaning up a messy pan (from boiling and baking milk), this is a great recipe. I've made it several times and have never had problems with any of the ingredients. I slice the potatoes as thin as I can to make it cook faster and I sprinkle the flour over each layer, without measuring it, I probably use less than 3 tablespoons.

This is a great basic recipe.  I like to springboard and by adding carmellized onions between layers, sifting the flour then placing a few slices of Canadian Bacon over top - it is really tasty.

Very easy, and you can easily add items to suit your tastes - cheese, onions, seasonings, etc.

Excellent and lighter than those with cheese.  I added some fresh sliced mushrooms, and some diced onion for extra flavor.  A keeper!
