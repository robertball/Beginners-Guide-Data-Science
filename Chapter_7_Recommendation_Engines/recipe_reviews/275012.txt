This is my first time ever using or eating dates, and I thought it was great. I followed the recipe exactly except for halving it. They made great little between-meal snacks. I'll make them again for sure.

I'd  call it Date Sesame, but whatever the name this recipe is a keeper.  I used the best organic Medjool dates available.  I probably didn't need to soak in hot water but I followed the recipe as instructed.  It's hard to stop after eating just one.
