The recipe suggests using a tortilla wrap, which was not a good combination with this salad.  Maybe bread would have given it a better taste.  I thought that the sweetness of the apricots and apple sounded good with turkey, but it was not.  I will not make this again.

I loved this! The dressing was so good. The only difference was that I used candied pecans.

This is one wonderful salad!  You could certainly use chicken if you don't have turkey but I wouldn't change another thing.  I had raw cashews so I toasted them in a dry non stick skillet with a tiny bit of sugar.  I set aside some nuts & chopped apricots to sprinkle on top.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't try this myself, but made it for my fiance. He said it tasted good. Instead of the apple, celery, cashews, dried apricot and spices I used the leftovers of "Waldorf Salad with Walnut Oil Vinaigrette" (from AR) that I'd served for brunch a day or two before. I changed the amounts of mayo and sour cream to 1/3 cup each, but left the amount of apricot preserves the same. Did not serve on tortillas, but rather regular white bread, toasted.

My family loved the Ginger-apricot Turkey salad. Kids are a funny about new foods and they ate it too.
