I've made this twice and it was good both times. The second time, I put the beans and salsa right on the tortilla (instead of in the pan on the eggs), scrambed the eggs and used sour cream instead of mayo.

I followed the recipe as directed. It was delicious! It was quick and easy to make when you are short on time. I've made it twice. The second time I made it, I decided to add more salsa because I loved the spicyness. This is a great recipe! I'll definitely make it again and again!
JAN 2011 UPDATE: I make this A LOT. Now I add some shredded cheddar cheese on top of the egg as it cook (after u put the beans in). It's delicious!

These were eggcellent!!  I sprinkled my tortillas with some shredded italian cheese and zapped it in the microwave instead of using the mayo.  This was the "glue" that held it together.  I didn't have the lettuce so I left it out and added some garlic and onion powders to my eggs before I scrambled them.  Good breakfast recipe..thanks.

Like LadyHughes, we have these regularly but substitute whatever we happen to have on hand in the eggs, such as peppers, onions, ham, etc.  A quick, nutritous and filling breakfast.

Healthy and tasty.  I have to review just to say: Refried beans and salsa are NOT high fat, if you buy the right kinds which are readily available; most salsa is quite healthy.  I added tomatoes and skipped the mayo, so it was even healthier.
A simple and yummy treat!

As written, I'd rate it a 4--as made, a 5!  We really like more "stuff" in our tortillas so I tripled (maybe quadrupled!) the refried beans & salsa.  I coated the non-stick pan with some oil before adding the eggs.  I left out the mayo (it just didn't seem to compliment the flavor) and made 3 8-inch tortillas.  It was a nice presentation and the 3 tortillas were just right for my DS.  DS said it needed more salsa.  Next time, I may use medium salsa rather than mild or serve additional salsa on the side.

the recipe is great, I added bacon and breakfast sausage in the eggs before wrapping and used the beans on the tortillas instead of mayo as mentioned before. I even made some My family loved them. I even did some with spinach, mushrooms and mozzerella...very good!!!

Instead of mayonnaise, I used reduced fat sour cream. I didn't use as much lettuce as the recipe called for and I added a chopped roma tomato. This was a great way to get a filling breakfast and use the leftovers of last week's taco dinner so it dosen't go to waste.

Living in south central Texas I used to have these all the time for breakfast, lunch or dinner! I agree with Tanaquil though, I always use sour cream, never mayo. These are great protein! Thanks.

I guess this isn't the majority opinion here, but I frankly thought this was boring.  I hardly even noticed that I was eating something.  It would have to be livened up quite a bit before it would be worth me making again.  And it wasn't that filling.

This was a good idea but I really didn't like the mayo or the lettuce in this. I think sour cream would have been a better choice than mayo and skip the lettuce completely. I didn't make a bean and egg omelet, I just kept them separate. It was easier that way and less mess. I loved the beans mixed with the salsa. I used El Fenix restaurant salsa and this had great flavor.

Another wonderfully versatile recipe! I warmed the beans and salsa a little in the microwave while I scrambled the eggs with some sliced ham and mushrooms. I'll definitely be making this again - it takes no time to make, plus it is extremely convenient to eat on the go. Thanks, Lysa!

We make something like this at our house but call them "breakfast burritos". You can put whatever you like into them. We put the scrambled eggs with onions, green peppers and then add hash browns and bits of sausage and shredded cheese (salt&pepper). You can really get creative with them. It's almost like rolling up an omlette!

YumYum!! I too spread the salsa/beans directly on the tortillas and sprinkled some shredded mild cheddar on the eggs instead. I will definitely make this again and again, it was soooo good!

This was really good.  It was a nice change from normal breakfast food.  My husband enjoyed it with low fat sour cream instead of Mayonnaise.

In lieu of mayo & lettuce I used spinach & sour cream. Added onion & hot sauce & cheddar.  This is good served anytime of day.  Always check your fridge & see what leftovers are there.  You can get very creative!

A quick and easy breakfast option!  I didn't have any re-fried beans, so I took some rinsed and drained canned pinto beans and ran them with the salsa through my food processor to make a sort of paste.  I replaced the eggs with eggbeaters and used the bean/salsa paste in the middle as directed. I also used reduced fat mayo. Good recipe!  I will make again.
