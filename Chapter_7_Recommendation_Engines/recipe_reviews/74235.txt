I used this as a side dish to accompany simple grilled chicken, and boy was it ever a winner.  I love home fried potatoes and the idea of putting them together with the broccoli slaw mix was fine with me because I love it too.  Only addtition was that I used 4 medium russet potatoes.  I will make this all the time now for any meal.  YUMMY!
Thanks Mann's!

I did as another reviewer suggested and added some egg to try and get this to hold together, It doesn't. This is just plain bland.  But thanks to another reviewer I discovered "awesome korean steak" from this site.  It was awesome.

I made 1/3 of this recipe to make 2 servings.  It turned out DELICIOUS, even though I accidentally used CABBAGE slaw for the broccoli.  I didnâ€™t understand how the veggies were supposed to hold together to be "turned", so I added a beaten egg to give it some body.  It was an excellent side dish when served with "Awesome Korean Steak", also on this site.

This is a great variation on traditional home fries. The broccoli slaw gives it a healthy touch. You can spice it up as much as you like. I made a big batch for a school function and had many compliments!
