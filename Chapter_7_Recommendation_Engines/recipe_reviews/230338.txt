I LOVE this recipe. It was the first time I ever made a stew and my boy friend, who loves stew really enjoyed it and said it was a "keeper". I served it with warm crusty bread and garlic, parmesean, buttered noodles, then we made mashed potatoes to go with it the next night. You can eat it just as a soup too. The only change I made was coating the beef in flour and searing it before adding it. This thickened it up a bit and made the beef more tender. I chose to omit the peas because I don't like them, so I only simmered it for 45 minutes, but I had also cut the recipe in half. I will definately make this as a cold winter night comfort food dish again! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was well received.  We served it over wide egg noodles and it made a hearty, nutritious meal.  The sour cream really gave plain old stew a nice twist.  Thanks for sharing, Kelly.

I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with a roast and I came across this recipe. I am not a fan of thyme so I left it out and added an extra tablespoon of tomato paste only because mine wasn't as red as the picture.  I also sauteed my meat in 1/2 cup red wine  then added all the ingredients with the exception of the sour cream in a crock pot and walked away. It was a big hit!  My family really enjoyed it!

It was absolutely fabulous!  I didn't have bacon on hand, so I cooked the beef in a stick of butter instead. I also seasoned the beef with Montreal steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  And at the end I added mushrooms instead of peas. I'm pretty sure it would have been a fabulous 5 star recipe without any changes, but I absolutely loved it the way I prepared it as well!
