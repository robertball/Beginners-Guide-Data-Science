This is the best chocolate chip recipe that I have ever found. You can't make just one batch, you have to make a lot more as they disapper just as soon as you put them out to cool. Also I use peanut butter chips for one of the chocolate chips. YUM YUM

These turned out perfect.  I did substitute 1/2 cup of the butter for 1/2 cup butter crisco as I do in all my cookies, I think it helps give them that crispy texture.  I also didn't have the full amount of chips on hand, I ended up with about 2 cups of chocolate chips in the batter and it was the perfect amount for the way we like our cookies.  Will definately be replacing the husbands grandmother's recipe for this one-- he didn't even realize there was a difference.

We live in greater Cincinnati area, and down here we are famous for chili either 3-way or 4-way or 5-way.  I modified this recipe a bit and called it "5-Way Cookies" for a bake sale and they were a hit.  I bought the milk chocolate chip/peanut butter chip blend and used a cup of that instead of just one cup of milk chocolate chips.  I also added a 1/3 cup of mini baking M&M's.  I took the other reviewers advise and reduced the white and brown sugar by about an 1/8 of a cup each, and added 1/2 tsp of salt.  Very good.

Awesome! I ended up adding a cup of the white chips and a 1/2 cup of the others and I omitted the nuts, but these are awesome! Not a single one was left when I brought them over to a meeting. YUM!

I made these as regular sized cookies as opposed to jumbo.  They still came out great!  My husband who usually only likes cookies straight from the oven continued to eat these for the next couple of days until they were finally gone.  Everyone complimented me on these cookies!  A must keep recipe!

These were amazing and the cookies were huge!  I would recommend doubling the batter-you will want more of these than less!

These cookies are amazing!! My husband and I loved them!! I did add 1 tsp. salt and made mine with an extra 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup cocoa to make them into chocolate cookies. So delicious!! We will def. make them without the cocoa as well to try them that way. I will be making this recipe again and again. It was fun making them so big, I usually just make regular size cookies, but these were fun!

These came out very good. I chopped up leftover candy bars from Easter and added then to the mix. Very good with Hershey's special dark chocolate!

this is an awesome cookie! i made these regular-sized and that works too. i reduced the amount of chips, 3/8 cup of each, and substituted butterscotch chips for milk chocolate ones; the combination is too much! i  recommend trying this recipe if you like good cookies, but like to try something new every once in a while.

These were pretty good.  I did substitute peanut butter chips for the milk chocolate and added a little more chips instead of nuts becasue I have a friend who can't eat nuts.  Will make these again.

I was very disappointed in this cookies.  When I see 5 stars from so many reviews I expect a great cookie.  This cookies needs SALT!!!! It has a funny aftertaste.  Now I am afraid to trust the other reviews on this site.

Yes I really do enjoy these cookies.Although it is nessesary to add a teaspoon of salt and I would have made it an even 3 cups of chips.They were very crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.Not for someone wanting a chewy cookie but if your looking for size and presentation these really give the "Wow" factor!

I baked them on a pam sprayed heavy duty foil cookie sheet for 15 minutes on convection bake took them off hot baking sheet  immediately. Put  them into some tupperware they are perfect and soft and chewy always keep seeled in a tight tupperware and they will be soft for days.

This is a awesome recipe. I am a baker and I feel these cookies are wonderful. I made some without adding salt and some with salt added.  Both batches were good. I also used butter flavored crisco instead of butter. Baked them for 13 min. Definitelywill be making these again and again.

Used Butter Flavored Crisco instead, and instead of using nuts, I just added an extra cup of chips.  I used a large ice cream scoop and baked for about 13 minutes.  These were AMAZING!

My brother loved these he ate a bunch as soon as they came out of the oven. i didnt have all the chocolate chips that the recipe asked for not that that mattered thats part of the fun i used semi sweet chocolate chip the swirled morsels and the chocolate caramel swirled morsels. But calling them jumbo is a marjor lie they were the size of regular cookies or smaller. I am still on the search for the perfect jumo chocolate chip cookie recipe. I hope to find one jumbo cookie thats actulay JUMBO

These are good, but I agree with my family that
they are not the best recipe I've tried.  Thought
it odd that the recipe called for no salt, and I
would probably cut back slightly on the sugar as
they are very sweet with all the chips.
