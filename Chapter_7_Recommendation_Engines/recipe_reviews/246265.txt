Made it with all unsweetened almond vanilla milk.  The instructions say to add 1/4 milk to the dry mixture and whisk until smooth - that did not happen, it was way too thick. So I just slowly added the remaining 3/4 cup milk and whisked away!  eventually it did get smooth - added the remaining milk while hand whisking  - and it took longer than 5 minutes to thicken - but it did!  So just be patient if it takes longer.

Works great, is delicious, and is very flexible!

I tried the recipe with half unsweetened almond milk and half regular dairy milk. I substituted the sugar and used brown sugar, and only used half the sugar (substituted stevia--the kind used for baking--for the other half). I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It turned out delicious!

The amount of corn starch assures that this will be a very firm set pudding--moreso the next day. I'm not sure if the dairy milk helped make it set more? In any case, it was fine. I tried the recipe a second time, with one-third dairy milk, two-thirds almond milk. Same with the sugar combination (one third sugar, two-thirds stevia). The pudding turned out great!

This will be one of my go-to recipes for chocolate pudding. I can vary the percentages of stevia (and sugar), as well as vary the  percentages of almond milk/dairy milk and it seems like it will turn out fine every time!

I wanted a recipe with almond milk since I always have a problem with it thickening. This pudding turned out great! I used Hershey's special dark cocoa so it came out looking so rich and smooth. It's delicious and so quick and easy! I saved it to my Favorites because next time I have a sweet tooth this will definitely satisfy.

Very good.  Used vanilla almond milk, cut sugar in half, omitted vanilla, and added 2 tbl instant coffee. Perfect level of sweetness, nice mocha flavor, rich and creamy. Hubby is lactose intolerant so it's nice to have a pudding option he can enjoy with the rest of the family :)

I made it with Allulose  instead of sugar and unsweetened almond milk. I loved the texture, just like Jello. I will definitely make this again. I want to try freezing this, because I think it would make great Fudgicles !

This is really as quick and easy as the other reviewers said! I used unsweetened almond milk, and only used 1/2c sugar. I added about 1tsp of cinnamon and it set well and was delicious! Definitely a keeper.

This pudding was very chocolaty, but not too sweet. Due to a corn allergy, I replaced the corn starch with tapioca starch. Other than that, I made no other changes. I will definitely make this again.

This is a keeper! I have a 4 yr old that is gluten, dairy & soy free due to allergies - desserts are tricky. I used original almond milk (because I had it) so I cut back the sugar to 3/4c. I also used soy free vegan butter at the end. It came out perfect ?? 

Thank you!!

Sounds FABULOUS! I can't wait to make myself a batch... BUT Before I do, I have a question:
The recipe says it yields "6 servings," but I'm not entirely certain if my idea of a "serving" is the same as the recipe's author?! I'm curious as to how many CUPS this recipe will produce?? 
... I see that it calls for 3 cups of milk, so am I safe in assuming that it'll make about 4, considering the other ingredients??? 
I just want to know how much it yields, so I know how kuch I want to make on my first go-round, because I ABHOR waste.
If anyone knows, please let me know... THANK YOU!

Super recipe. Super-duper easy. Instead of vanilla, I added cayenne pepper powder. I did not add the butter. It thickens quite quickly, so keep your eye on it. Thank you for the recipe.

I made changes because my husband bought the wrong almond milk. I always use Unsweetened almond milk. So withSweetened Almond milk I  used 1/2 C stevia & monk fruit plus 1/4 C sugar. Sift cocoa. You don’t want to take a bite and get bits of cocoa in your mouth. Learn from my adventures. So it tastes Great!! I have made this 4 times.
Cow milk 1% make as instructed.
Low carb use /2 corn starch and 2 T Xanthum gum

I will cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups next time. 
Once it started to warm up I noticed that it was kind of lumpy, so I strained it. 
It came out so nice and smooth. 
It seemed to be taking a long time to thicken, but once it started to simmer it thickened right up. 
Adding the butter at the end mad it so silky. 
Mmmm. Definitely a keeper

Love this pudding! so much better than the commercial kind.  Not overly sweet but smooth and creamy and yummy.  Add pecans as a garnish on top and nice little crunch.  Have been looking for almond milk recipes as can't do dairy - this will be at the top of my list

Excellent!!  I use 1/4 c splenda brown sugar blend instead of white sugar.  I accidentally forgot the vanilla but I had used unsweetened vanilla almond/cashew milk so I wasn't too worried.  I also had a few chocolate chips left from another recipe so I through those in.  I did NOT add the butter.  The texture and the taste - outstanding!!!!   I'm so happy to be able to make pudding with almond milk.

I made it twice already. The first time, I made the mistake of using half sweetened & half unsweetened almond milk + 3/4 cup of sugar. It was WAY too sweet for my taste. 
The second time, I used unsweetened almond milk and 1/3 cup of sugar. It did the trick. I am still missing a little "kick" I feel so I'll try to add cayenne pepper next time

Excellent! The only adjustment I made was to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was perfect. It would have been too sweet for me if I had used a cup of sugar.  A delicious low fat tasty pudding that would satisfy the chocoholics.

This was an excellent recipe. We did cut the sugar by half.  Split the milk with  2 cups almond milk and 1 cup fat free half and half. Added 1/4 tsp espresso powder and small dash of cayenne. It was so rich and amazing!

Pudding is too runny. I did go back and cook more but didn’t help. Flavor is good but next time I’ll use 2 3/4 cups milk. Maybe try less sugar for a richer chocolate flavor.

This pudding recipe stuck out to me because I have to be gluten free but love dessert. It was so amazing and is so rich....just how I like it! the only thing I did different was use regular 1% milk and I used just under 3 cups but I recommend the entire 3. I also used coconut oil instead of butter and it turned out perfect!

I tried this recipe because I missed chocolate terribly. I nurse still and have a 13 month old who can't handle dairy. Not only did I get chocolate, but he got his first taste too! 

As other users said, I literally added the almond milk as I hand whisked. And boy did it take a while to start thickening! I have a weak wrist and ultimately traded off the task of stirring the pot.

Just need to find a way to reduce the sugar so I can enjoy this more often.

Excellent, I did use Cashew milk, as that is what I prefer. It turned out sooo good, I even thought of not telling my husband it was made with cashew milk, just to see if he could tell. But I told him and he still loved it. Will be making this one often.

The consistency of this pudding was spot on, but it was too sweet for me. I would have to cut back the sugar if I were to make it again. I would probably decrease the amount of cocoa as well, as I prefer a fairly mild chocolate taste.

Easy and tasty.  I add about half the rcommended sugar, omit the butter and it still tastes great.  Fantastic vegan pudding.

Nice recipe. Easy to convert to vegan. I used coconut oil instead of butter, used only two cups of almond milk because I used one cup of raw honey instead of sugar.

Truly Delicious, best pudding I have ever made.  I did drop the sugar to  3/4 cup, and used unsweetened Almond Cashew milk (no big difference I am sure)  I will try substituting Cacao next time for the Cocoa for increased health benefits.  Definitely gave me my chocolate fix without all the fat!!!  A must try!

Very good. I used soy milk and used 1/2c sugar and extra coca powder because I think more chocolate is always a good thing!

Brilliantly easy and perfect. I used homemade almond milk and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup. I also used raw cacao powder instead of regular baking cocoa. It's a chocoholic's delight. I want to try it over sliced strawberries in a pie shell sometime.
