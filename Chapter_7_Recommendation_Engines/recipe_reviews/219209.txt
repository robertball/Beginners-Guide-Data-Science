I scoop out some of the baked potato and combine it with the cheese mixture, then spoon it back into the potato shell.  In addition to topping then with chives, try crumbled cooked (real) bacon.

I love gorgonzola so this recipe was right up my alley. I did make some modifications by cutting the potatoes in half, removed the filling and mixed it with sour cream, gorgonzola as well as some cooked bits of chourico and couple tbsp of garlic cream cheese. I stuffed the potatoes with the filling and baked them. Afterwards I topped it with caramelized onions and they were absolutely amazing. Thanks for a great base recipe! :)

Pretty good potato recipe! I skipped the chives as I had none and changed the oven temp to 400 and baked the potatoes for a little more than 40 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

Made these at a friends house yesturday. We used 1/2 cup crumbled gorgonzola instead of 1/4 cup and topped them with carmelized onions instead of chives. They were sooo yummy I will make them again!

A very simple dish with an elegant presentation; this was a big winner in our house!  I couldn't believe how easy it was to throw together and the result was quite delicious!  My only substitution was to use Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.

I took these to a function and everyone said how good they were!  I had to use a bit bigger potatoes, but it worked just fine.  :)
