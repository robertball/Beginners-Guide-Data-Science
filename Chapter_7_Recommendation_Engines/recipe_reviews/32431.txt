This was a good substitute for my beloved Diet Cherry Limeade when I can't afford to go to Sonic. I did use an off brand of diet lemon lime soda. Since I've jumped back on the wagon this was a nice way to use up the grenadine I had in my fridge. My youngest son loved this.

Pretty refreshing but more a Shirley Temple than what I would consider a Cherry Limeade. Thanks Anonymous.

Great drink! I added a little vodka and finished it with a twist of lime - that made it even better.

I love cherry limeades so I made some cherry vodka just to use in them. I call them cherry limeades XXX (for adults only;o) ). Wonderful poolside drink!

Tried this twice - once with a whole lime (too tart & limey) and once with just 1/4 of a lime - much better.

This recipe calls for a little too much grenadine. My glasses have beveled edges and it was just a few cm's above the edge so I think I'll fill it up to the edge next time. This drink was so easy and looked so beautiful. One lime will make about 8 glasses so one lime a case of soda and a bottle of grenadine makes 8 happy people!! After making this over and over and over and over I found that it's best to roll the lime before you cut it to make it really juicy. This is the perfect drink for Christmas because of the colors. Pour the grenadine in first then squeeze the lime and throw that in the grenadine this will stain the inside of the lime red and then pour the soda on top. This makes for a very FESTIVE drink!!

Great combo of cherry lime - the right amount of sweet vs. tart. Next time I'll try crushing the ice and making a slushie out of it.

Very refreshing and colorful. It was a nice change from the every day water juice or canned soda with our meal. We will definately keep grenadine and lemon lime soda on hand. Thanks a bunch.

3.29.18 Not into sweetness too much these days. I did cut back the amount of grenadine and gave the drink a good squeeze of a fresh lime wedge to achieve a good sweet-tart level for me. Enjoyed.
