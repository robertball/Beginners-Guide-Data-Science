I just made this salad--the dressing is wonderful! I am not a fan of Italian dressing so this will be a go-to dressing for me. I also heated the dressing as suggested by others. I added tomatoes and cucumbers because I had them in the refrigerator. I also added some mozzarella as someone else also suggested. What a wonderful make-ahead salad for all year around. I will use it again.

Although it is not my favorite take on cold noodle salad - this is a good recipe. The dressing resembles French Dressing. I added cubed turkey and shredded cheddar cheese so that I could make a complete meal for our Sunday supper. If your a fan of French Dressing - you might enjoy this unqiue salad. Glad we tried it!

I make a variation of this. Instead of onions & green peppers, I use red, yellow and orange sweet bell peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Sometimes I add broccoli too. Also, the dressing should simmered over low heat so the sugar dissolves. Everyone I feed this to loves it!

This was tasty but not spectacular. I added some crumbled bacon to it for some extra flavor and my family liked it a lot with that addition.

This recipe is not to my liking -- so sugary and other than that no flavor. I ended up rinsing the pasta and starting over!

This was delicious. I didn't have wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. My kids aren't big on veggies in pasta salad so I just added bacon cheese and tomatoes. It was a huge hit. I did take an earlier recommendation and heated the oil sugar and vinegar just enough to melt the sugar and then added the ketchup. I added the bacon and cheese once the salad was cooled off. This is a keeper.

This was very good! What drew me to the recipe was the dressing...it's just like a dressing my grandma makes except we use worcester sauce in it but other then that it's the same! so I knew I'd love it and I did! I did however use some extra veggies...tomatoes blk olives and vidalia onion instead of green onion. very good and different then the regular old italian dressing...thanks for sharing!!

This is a good pasta salad but you need to like your dressing a little on the sweeter side. I subbed seashell pasta as that is what I had on hand. I also added some red & orange peppers along with the green to add color since my pasta was not rainbow pasta like the recipe calls for. I do believe this is a recipe that is better if made the day ahead so that the flavors have time to meld. The dressing is sweet and if I make it again I will cut the sugar in half and drop the vegetable oil down to 1/3 cup but keep everything else the same. I m always looking for new pasta salads to try and this was good although sweet as written.

This was pretty tasty! I substituted splenda for the sugar and red wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar. Also substituted vidalia onions for the green onions and 1 red and 1 orange bell pepper for the green one. Used whole grain wheat pasta. Turned out great for my diabetic husband. I will be making it again.

I made this for Memorial Day. It went over very well. Noone complained that it was too sweet. I made exactly as written but added fresh spinach. I will make again!

Made this for my son's high school graduation party (tripled the recipe). I wanted a non-mayo based salad because we were having potato salad as well and found this recipe. I received tons of compliments on it from the kids to the adults. I used red bell pepper instead of green (personal preference and what I had on hand) but that is the only change I made. I could see adding cooked diced chicken maybe sliced black olives - the possibilities are endless. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added chunks of monterey jack cheese grape tomatoes and black olives. I would also substitute a yellow or orange pepper for the green one just for color variation.

I made it for a pot luck lunch. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. I did not have the red wine vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar. It turned out very nice
