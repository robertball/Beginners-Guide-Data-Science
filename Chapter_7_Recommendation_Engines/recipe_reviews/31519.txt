This was a great way to make homemade fries. I ended up adding all the ingredients into a ziploc bag and shaking it really well to evenly coat the fries. I placed them on a piece of foil (spray the foil so fries don't stick) on a baking sheet, and that made clean up super quick and easy. Great fries!!

These are a dream come true!! Great spicey healthy fries!! 5 stars all the way. I love them and they last well in the fridge a couple days and can be re-baked later. ****JUST REMEMBER to grease your baking sheet--I used wax paper--with an olive oil spray or some other flavored spray so they don't stick to the sheet!! I didn't grease my sheet the first time and it was torture to have to throw away those tasty fries and only be able to slowly pick off some. But ever since, the greased sheet works like a charm... : )

This is an awesome recipe for healthy eating. Top notch side dishes are always hard to find. I paired these with Asian Tuna Patties, another great allrecipes submission.  I may never eat another french fried potato again. Why would I when only 11% of the calories in this recipe are fat calories? It doesn't get much better than that. In trying to eat healthy, these french fries are a perfect choice for a side dish. I will be talking about these and using the recipe for the rest of my living years. As others have recommended, I did bag the Parmesan cheese and dried basil, coating the fries in three batches. I added salt and pepper separately.  Enjoy! This is one recipe I would choose any day of the week, healthy recipe or not.  Mmm.

I've been trying to find creative uses for potatoes since we're now on a tight budget and potatoes are cheap.  I used this cooking technique, but changed the ingredients.  I lined my baking sheet with parchment paper and coated the fries with olive oil spray.  I seasoned the fries with garlic salt and cajun spices and baked them in the oven for about 35-40 minutes (I don't see how 20 could be nearly enough... they were still very soggy, but I did toss them a couple times to make sure they cooked evenly). For the person with sticking issues, the parchment paper works perfectly.  I crumbled some leftover gouda I had in the food processor and threw that on top in the last couple minutes, then added another light coating of olive oil spray and added some fresh snipped chives.  Together with the grilled gouda burgers we made, we certainly didn't feel like we were on so tight a budget!

Super easy to make, and a healthy alternative to frying.  Very flavorful.  The only change I made was adding a dashing of paprika.

These turned out really good. Better than I had hoped! They went perfect with my turkey burger. After reading other reviewer's problems with them sticking to the pan, I decided to use parchment paper. I highly recommend this. I also used reduced fat parmesean and garlic salt rather than regular. They're so easy to make, too! The hardest part was slicing the potatoes, and I accomplished that before my oven was even finished preheating. I'll use this one again.

Very good!  I also used this recipe to make some tortilla chips (in place of the potatoes) for dipping and it was even better!

These were okay, I think I actually sliced my potatoes too thinly because they got too crispy.  Also, they didn't have much flavor, but I used real Parmesan instead of the stuff out of the jar, I think they may have actually been better with the cheap stuff.  I may try again adding more flavor as I was looking for a good low fat potato recipe.

My husband (the ultimate french fry fanatic) absolutely loved these!  I put the seasonings in a large ziploc bag, added some garlic powder and Johnny's Seasoning Salt (instead of just plain salt & pepper) and shook the potato slices before placing on the baking sheet.  I used parchment paper, sprayed with a little olive oil spray, and then sprayed a little more on the top of the potatoes.  Nothing stuck!  They turned out cripsy and extremely flavorful.  They did take a little longer to bake than the recipe stated...no problem.  We will be making these again and again!

The kids and I loved these baked fries. So easy to make. I added all ingredients into a ziplock bag, plus I added 1/2 tsp chili powder to spice it up a bit and some olive oil. The ziplock bag worked like a charm to coat all the sliced potatoes evenly. I baked it at 400oF for 40 minutes (turning the fries over around 20 minutes), then increased to 425oF for an additional 5 minutes. Served it with turkey bacon burgers. What to do with leftover fries? For breakfast the next morning, I cut the fries into small pieces, fried it in a touch of bacon fat, and served it with scrambled eggs. Yum.

My kids started munching on these as I was putting them into the serving bowl and they loved them.  So did the adults.  Fantastic recipe and simple.  I did as suggested by other reviewers and used a bag to shake the seasonings onto the fries.  The only thing I would suggest is to make two batches if your crowd loves fries!

Nice flavor and very easy to make!  I used garlic salt though I think fresh minced garlic would have made these fries even better.

Made these for lunch today and they were a big hit with my husband and son (I left out the basil, though). If you don't have any cooking spray (I didn't), you can pour a small amount of oil (I didn't measure, and I used olive oil) in a ziplock bag with the salt and pepper, add the potatoes and turn over several times to coat all, and then add the cheese and do the same. I used parchment paper on the baking sheet, and I had to cook them a little longer than stated; I think maybe 35 minutes would be about right, in my oven at least. My husband said I could make these every day as far as he's concerned! Thanks for sharing.

These turned out pretty good, but the cooking time was a little longer then called for and we had to flip them in order to get them crisp on each side, but the flavor was good. My husband thought they could use some garlic, so I may try that next time.  I definitely will make again, but will add the garlic.

I loved them.  My daughter and my husband loved them too.  I didn't have basil so I got creative.  I sprinkled Parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, salt and a small amount of paprika. It came out so delicious.

These were a great start to something I improved over time.  I like the spices, but add some garlic powder as well and just a tiny bit of cayenne to kick it up a bit, plus the red/orange color looks great!  The main thing that bothered me about the recipe as is: 25 minutes at 400 is not nearly enough.  I've tried  it in a regualr oven and they were only about halfway cooked, and the next time I used my convection cycle and they still came out not cooked enough.  I cut them in 1/4 inch slices as called for, some even thinner.  The first time I made it I picked the recipe b/c of it's quick cook time, we were in a hurry.  We ended up throwing them out and getting fast food on the road.  Needless to say, when I made them again, my husband was skeptical.  But after several tries, I've found that 45-50 minutes at 400 does the trick.  And definately line your pan with parchment and/or tin foil!  Great start to something we;ve now enjoyed alot!

These are great! I cut the potatoes with a mandolin on the french fry setting, which made it fast and easy, but I think they came out too thin. The taste is awesome! 
I did have trouble with them slightly sticking, so I think next time I'll place them on parchment paper.
Great recipe!!

These were great!  My husband even liked them.  The only thing that I would do different next time is maybe sprinkle some garlic powder.  And they are only 2 points on weight watchers.  Thanks!

These were good!  I followed the advice to put the fries, seasoning & Parmesan cheese in a zip lock bag.  I also added parsley & oregano to the basil.  Then when I put the fries on the foil (after spraying it) I put a bit of paprika on top.  Baked for about 40 minutes.  They were a good side to my vegetarian Reuben sandwich!  Next time I'm going to use something to spice them up a bit.

Very good. The parmesan cheese in particular gives it a great flavor. This recipe is better than most baked "fries" recipes I have tried.

Made a few times now and always follow the recipe as written, but have cooked a bit longer due to larger cuts.  Excellent!  Guests also raved!  Flavor, crispness right on the money!  Who knew? Thanks for the post!

Thee tasted great but stuck horribly to my aluminum foil lined pan (that I forgot to spray with Pam). Will try again with Pam.

To get these as golden and crispy as my family likes, I had to cook them 20 minutes longer. With the addition of garlic and onion powder, these were very good. The leftovers were heated in a skillet the next night. They developed even more crispiness to them.

These are VERY tasty. The first batch that I made I followed this exact recipe. They were yummy but werent very flavourful. My second batch I added a bit more spice (basil, salt and pepper) and it came out BEAUTIFULLY! It tasted liek french fries you would get in a 5 star hotel! Ohhh and the best part, this is super easy, quite healthy and the kids can help if they'd like! Prep time says 20 mins here but it took me only 5 mins to prepare.

Yummmm! Followed the recipe to a T and then added a tsp of garlic powder (we're garlic fiends). So tasty and they crisped up more than I anticipated for baked fries. Excellent flavor and the parmesan helps with the crunch. This is now our go-to fry recipe.

Quick, easy, and fun for the whole family! The only thing I did different was that I placed the potatoes and the seasonings in a bowl and mixed, THEN placed them on the cookie sheet to bake. Every fry was evenly coated with seasoning. Definitely will do these again.

Delicious! I used fresh basil from my garden, Johnny's seasoning salt, freshly ground pepper and sprinkled cayenne pepper over the potatoes. Spicy and delicious, and non-greasy! Also, I just used two good sized potatoes and it was plenty for my husband and I.

I made them exactly as indicated, however I found they turned out stale with little flavor. I may have cut them too thin; not sure what went wrong.

I gave them a three because I like fries and these were ok. I had the same problem I see some others had, mine did not cook well, had to double the time and raise the temp for the second 20 mins. I will have to cut them thinner and try again. I use a stoneware square pan for cooking, I will try something different next time.

We loved these fries! We ate them with some homemade chinese rice. At 400 degrees, they were done around 45 minutes. I peeled mine becuase I didn't read what is said about leaving on the skin till I was finished making it, it was good anyway!

I have been looking for a french fry recipe and this is by far the best.  My husband agrees with me and he's picky.  My kids all ate them.  The only thing I did different was add the ingredients to a gallon zipper bag and coated them that way.  They were very good.

I added 2 tsps. olive oil and 1 tsp. italian seasoning mix and tossed in a glass bowl.  I cut the potatoes thinner to cook a shorter amount of time. 375 degrees for 25 minutes.  Make sure you use parchment paper or move the fries every 5 minutes because they will stick to the pan!  These were delicious!!!

I love this recipe. It is so easy, so flavorful and so much healthier than traditional French fries. I didn't change a thing, but I was very generous with the pepper because of personal preference. The parmesan was a nice touch. Thank you Fred!

So yummy. The parmesan cheese makes the potatoes sooo..tasty! The second time that I made it I cut out the parm. cheese (to make it a bit lower calorie) and seasoned with salt, pepper & onion powder. Still yummy. Nothing like eating FRENCH FRIES when dieting!

Excellent fries.  I took advice from Shandy and also drizzled my fries with olive oil and then put everything in a large ziplock bag so it was mixed very well.  I also added garlic salt.  Kids loved as did I.  Thanks

Nice but definitley add garlic salt and use olive oil instead of cooking spray.  A nice light-tasting fry.

I used foiled and sprayed with pam also sprinked potatoes with extra virgin olive oil & garlic salt. We loved this recipe!  The fries were gone in 5 minutes.  The only complaint from my boys were there weren't enough.  I need to double the recipe next time.  Will definately be using this instead of frozen bag fries.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Served it with fried cod made a great dinner.

Really tasty fries and it will be so easy to change the seasonings around to taste. Put the potatoes in a ziplock bag with a little bit of olive oil, cheese, garlic salt, pepper and the basil. Baked on parchment paper for 40 minutes (turned at 20). Super easy prep and was a hit with the whole family.

Tasty, but I must have done something wrong because all of the fries stuck to the pan and had to be peeled off.

I've been using a variation of this recipe for years. Nice to see it here and obviously enjoyed my many others.  I too vary the seasonings with my tastes, entree and mood, drizzle lightly with olive oil, toss in big bowl, and always bake for at least 40 mins. Been family fav for years. Rarely use cheese, lactose intolerant family member can't enjoy 'em with it. But we all love 'em spicy!

I have had quite a few dietary problems since I got my gallbladder removed last years and have found my self constantly trying to come up with creative low fat foods I can make with little effort just for a snack.  I can spend 5 minutes prepping these and pop them in my toaster oven.  They are low fat, delicious, quick and easy.  How much more could we ask for?

love these French fries. Only complain need more cooking time . I cook mine 45 mins usual..  I make these all the time. I add garlic powder or use salt free garlic herb mix . Increase the seasoning because I love lots flavor in small bite. Another tip is soak in cold water 5 mins 1 or 2 times. It ruduce starch causes crispyer frie .. 

If you want even lower fat or . Use reduce fat parmesan. I am on very low fat diet. If I can have .5 or less in side dish I am excited. Even 2 grams is not much.

Yum!  My family tried these fries for the first time this evening and we all love them.  Much healthier alternative to greasy fries.  The parmesan cheese gives these fries a great flavor.  The only thing I added was a garlic salt.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!!!

I agree, very good potatoes!  My +1 commented favorably on them twice while we were eating them (with some baked BBQ chicken drumsticks and a green salad) and once more after dinner was done.  A keeper for Mr. Picky apparently.  :-)  I mostly followed as directed, but added a little overage of each ingredient as I used 4 medium sized potatoes and a little olive oil to help coat the potatoes.  I cut them into thick wedges and mixed everything up in a large ziploc.  Baked in oven at 400 for 40 minutes.  It is essential to coat the foil on the baking sheet well with vegetable spray so the potatoes won't stick.  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and 1 teaspoon of kosher salt into the bag.  I am a bit lazy, so I am interested in doing as little as possible with food at times, but I can see how flipping the these french fries in the middle of baking could provide more even crispiness.  Mine turned out a-ok the lazy way.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe in the rotation.

This was really good!  I was surprised how well the flavors stood out and how tasty these fries were!  I think I might try flipping them next time to try to get them more crunchy on all sides.  But in any case, excellent dish!

What a great alternative to regular french fries! I made this exactly as written, and served it alongside "Slow Cooker Pulled Pork", also from this site. Delicious meal. I lined my pan with foil (sprayed with Pam) as another reviewer suggested, and it made cleanup a breeze! They lifted up so easily. Also, my fries weren't browning by the end of the 25 minutes so I put on the broiler for a couple minutes and it crisped them up a bit more. Thank you for a great and easy recipe!

I used a red potato instead and put the wedges into a tupperware, added lots of garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a little bit of cayenne pepper. *ADDITIONS: I also cut an onion into thick slices and layered it on top, and once I shook them up in the container! So delicious! Definitely try this.

These were absolutely wonderful!  I used olive oil instead of cooking spray, but that was the only thing that I changed.  The suggestion by someone to use parchment paper to line the baking sheet worked great.  I will definitely make these again!

These were really tasty and certainly healthier than deep fried fries. As many of the other reviewers noted, the cooking time give seems to be too short. Mine took about 40 minutes to cook, even though I cut them fairly thin. Thanks!

I keep making the mistake of cutting these too thin- for anyone else that didn't realize this (like me) they thin out as they cook! Maybe that's an obvious fact for other...guess I'm special! (short bus). Added seasoned salt to mine- yum!

These were great!!  I made a trial batch with one potato to see how it would taste. I put garlic olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried basil in a mixing bowl. After mixing the spices, I threw in the potato strips and tossed to coat evenly.  I used un-greased parchment paper and did not have trouble with the fries sticking to it like some other reviewers had said. I did have to bake for about 30 minutes as my strips were slightly thicker... and they turned out really good!! My total prep time was 5 minutes!!   Definitely a keeper! Will make again on a larger scale next time.

An easier way to do this is to just put the taters in a plastic bag and add Italian salad dressing and let it marinate.

These were really good for baked potato wedges...but I wouldn't call them "french fries".

Left out the basil (personal taste), but loved the way these turned out. A definite no brainer. Can scale nicely to server more or less depending on your family size, which is great. Next time I might flip them once to get both sides brown. Don't let them fool you that they aren't getting brown... it's the pan-side of the fry that gets nice and golden. I use this same technique with sweet potatoes (with a dash of cayenne -- yum).

I really like how they turned out crispy!  Makes me feel like you don't HAVE to deep fry fries to get them crispy :)

Definitely a keeper! I used Lawry's seasoned salt along with the other seasoning called for. I baked them at 425  in convection oven for about 35 minutes flipping them about halfway through.

I didn't find these too flavorful and I even added a little extra cheese and basil. Also, I'd bake for a little longer because they were still crunchy when they were done.

This was a great recipe to work with!  I use a lot of spices and don't typically measure out spices for things I bake.  The more spices the better for these babies!   So casually... 3 Potatoes-1/2 c. Olive Oil (Vegetable Oil works fine too)-1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder-1/2 tsp. Onion Powder-1/2 tsp. Basil-1/4 tsp. Paprika-1/4 tsp. Oregano-1/4 tsp. Chile Powder-Salt and Pepper to taste.  Combine ingredients in bowl.  Add potatoes and toss in bag or large bowl.  Bake at 400 until golden brown and enjoy!  Serves Four.

SO yummy!  This recipe is so simple and so delicious!  We've only made it twice and each time, our guests have asked for the recipe.  I too put the seasonings in a bag and then added the potatoes and found it much easier that way!  Great recipe - thanks!

I loathe deep-fat frying.  These fries weren't highest restaurant quality (d@#^ Good Fries from East Coast Grill in Cambridge or Fat Boys fries to name a couple) but they satisfied us at home without the cost, mess, or travel.  This is definitely the way to go to get home cooked yummy fries with endless possibilities in the spice-it-up department.

Very Good! I used red potatoes, flipped and added another spray of cooking spray half way through cooking. This way they get evenly brown on both sides. Beats frozen fries any day!

Great recipe, I have been making a similar one for years. For a delicious alternative seasoning try Cavendars Greek seasoning. It is outstanging on everything.

Amazing! I've made these a few times and they've quickly become a favourite in my family. They're full of flavour and low in fat! This is definitely one for the recipe books. I didn't have a problem with them sticking to the pan-- I simply put down a sheet of foil and a bit of spray. Just as other reviewers did, I put the potatoes and spices into a Ziploc bag and shook them around to get them more evenly coated.

These were so so good!  I cut my peeled potatoes into strips and tossed in a bowl with olive oil, some dried onion and a package of Italian Dressing seasoning.  I put down parchment paper on a jelly roll pan before putting fries on.  Excellent! Will make again!

These are a fabulous side to turkey garlic burgers or anything else! The spices make it perfect. The only disclamer I'd give is that it's a very "grown up" taste, my kids weren't interested at all to my disbelief.

Not sure why mine didn't turn out like everyone says-I followed the recipe and recommendations.  Mine did not get crispy, and needed to be cooked longer.  Just ok. My kids (9,12) didn't eat.

As written, these were alright, but since I added garlic and paprika for extra flavor, they pretty much ended up like the fries in Baked French Fries I.

Very tasty. I put them in a ziploc bag and drizzled them w/olive oil. I then added the basil and parmesan. No problems w/sticking.

Very good.  I also used parchment paper and shook all ingredients in a ziploc bag.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Everyone loved it.

Yum!  I exchanged the basil for garlic salt and these were a big hit.  My husband insists I made them at least once a week.

These were so easy and GREAT!  My boyfriend and I were fighting over the last one!  I did change it a bit (thanks to the reviews) by adding garlic salt instead of basil and just a bit of olive oil.  Shaking them in the ziploc was helpful too.  Will definitely be making this a regular!

Baked these and left them in the living room to cool while I made another batch. When I came out, they were all gone! ;) Healthy and tasty - what more can you ask for?

We loved these - and they are so much better for you than regular fries!!  We also made a few modifications to the recipe; instead of using cooking spray, we used a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, we used basil, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, but we added some cayenne pepper and some seasoned salt...we added all this to a large ziplock back and shook the fries to coat.  We can't wait to make these again - they were quick, easy and delicious!!

These french fries are excellent. Great taste, family just loved them, just make sure you spray baking pan for easy release of fries.

Delicious!!! Best fries ever. Husband loved them.  So easy and no grease. The only thing I did different was temp at 425 degrees, used a little olive oil to coat and put them in cold water first and then dried them.

Wished could give this 10 stars, as its  fantastic.  In the past have tried many different recipes for oven baked fries, however, non of them comes close to this one. Followed the recipe exactly except for replacing Parmesan with Romano cheese, adding onion powder & a sprinkling of paprika for more color..  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all.

Delicious! I sprayed the baking sheet with coconut oil spray and poured about two tablespoons of olive oil over the potatoes, seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Vegan and healthier and so delicious!

Wow   After reading the reviews, I knew these might stick so I used foil and sprayed the heck out of it.  They STILL stuck!  I spent several minutes peeling them off the foil and turned them over after 20 minutes.  After another 20 minutes, they were delicious.  I'm not sure they were worth the trouble, but I might try them again when I have some parchment paper available.

Awesome!  I used a zip-lock bag to put all the ingredients in & then toss the fries in it.  I also baked mine for much longer (40-45 min), turning half way. 
Great recipe - thanks!

Ok, so I went the slightly unhealthy route as I didn't have any cooking spray. I used melted butter and a brush on each piece. I plan to try some different oils in the future, but this recipe offers an excellent guideline.

These were a huge hit at my home! Since they had parmesan I opted to make a parmesan burger as well, it was excellent pairing! They turned out even better and yummier than I ever expected.

Didn't have basil, but used paprika, S&P, and parm cheese. Was delish! I don't think parm cheese has enough flavor to use this way, so I feel it was a waste... Maybe I just prefer stronger cheeses. Next time I'll just make without the cheese. Simple, easy, and quick. Maybe I'll try with curry powder next?

I boiled the potatoes for 5 min.  Drained completely and let sit for a few min.  Added oil.  Poured onto pan.  Sprinkled salt, pepper, basil and parmesan.  Baked until golden. 20-30 min. The kids ate 'em all up with a bit of ketchup!

I didn't add the basil or cheese, mostly because my family is VERY picky, and I kept them in the oven for an extra ten minutes or so. This recipe was the only one I found that used spray oil, it is great!

Absolutely delicious! So simple and so much healthier than fried. I did alter the recipe a bit - used olive oil instead of cooking spray and also mixed all the ingredients together with the potato strips before spreading them on the baking sheet. I liked it with Parmesan cheese but my husband didn't so I'll probably leave the cheese out next time.

These tasted so good! Mine cooked just fine in the 25 minutes and even had some crispness to them. Added some seasoning salt instead of basil, just because that's what was in the cabinet. Will definetly make again!

SO GOOD! Made as written, but did bake them a little longer and turned them halfway through. A nice, healthy alternative, and one I will be making again and again~great flavor! Thanks for sharing. :)

Fantastic! I sprinkled shredded parmesan over the top in addition to the grated parmesan and it was great. Much more tasty. It was good without the basil, too.

DELICIOUS!! Made this along with the 'Chicken Fried Chicken' recipe from this site and some corn... it made for a GREAT meal!! Next time I think I will do like one of the reviews below said and put all the ingredients in a ziploc baggie and shake to evenly coat the fries.  Either way they were yummy!!

These were great! I had to cook them much longer than the recipe stated, almost double. The potatoes I used seemed much larger than normal so that may be why. Once they were finished though they were really good, nice seasoning and flavor. My picky husband enjoyed them too. Thanks!

These were a very good and healthy alternative to french fries. I used Yukon gold potatoes which gave them a bit of a sweeter taste. I added a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash and a bit of garlic to the spice mix and shook the potatoes in a bag to coat thoroughly. My picky children enjoy them. Thanks for the easy recipe

Great recipe! I followed it exactly and my boyfriend and I were very happy with the results. It did not specify freshly grated parmesan or the powdered kind so we used the powdered kind. It Was good that way but we're going to get some fresh and I bet it will be even better.

These are easy and fast.  My daughter who hates potatoes (except for MC Donald's french fries) just came back for her third helping.  I am always trying to find ways to make her eat her vegtables and with this recipe there is no making her.....thirds unheard of!  These are very tasty and soooo much better for my kids.

They did taste good, it's just never the same without a deep fryer. They were more healthy, and a good flavor. I forgot the salt and I think that might have made the difference.

These are good and very easy.  I did put the cheese and basil in a ziptop bag, along with some olive oil and then placed the potatoes in there and shook the bag.  I liked this because it put the seasonings on both sides of the potato wedge.  I sprinkled salt and pepper on before putting in the oven.  I also coated the baking sheet in olive oil to help keep things from sticking.  They came out perfect!

These are quick and easy.  I didn't care so much for the cheese on them, it didnt add enough flavor.  Also, you cant cut them to thick because they wont cook enough. Great recipe for those quick meals.

They didn't really work out for me. I'm not quite sure why. But the basil and parmesan didn't really give them much flavour, and they weren't very crispy.

We liked them, although I agree with my husband that they could have been crispier. I baked them for 20 minutes and they were golden and crispy but became soft quickly. When I try these again I will go 5 minutes longer. I used an AirBake cookie sheet and parchment paper. I used a Ziplock bag to shake the potatoes in the cheese and spices, left-over cheese went onto the hamburger patties as they cooked.

Made these a few times now, and decided I should finally review them! These were really good!  Made them again yesterday, but didn't have any cooking spray on hand, so I tossed them extra virgin olive oil instead.  Tried them with Italian Seasoning this time instead, and fresh grated parmesan cheese - tossed them all together in a bowl then baked them.  Turned out fantastic!  Thanks for the no fail recipe.  Will make these again and again.  :)

These were really good!I liked these better than 'baked french fries I'.I drizzled with EVOO instead of spray but other than that followed recipe as stated. Will make this version again for sure.

Yummy. I eyeballed the parm and used a combo of dried/fresh basil, since I have a ton of it. I also used a little olive oil to help with the sticking issue, and some garlic salt. They were delicious and simple!!

These were great!! I cooked them for 25 minutes though. I also wanted more zest and a kick. I seasoned with seasoning salt, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper! They were awesome!!!! I will make these more often!

This is a great starter recipe for any kind of fry you can think up.  I definitely cut mine too thick, because I had to cook the 25 minutes, flip over, and cook another 15-20 minutes.  And I switched the basil and parm for Lawry's seasoning salt and garlic powder.  Tasty.

Maybe I am too picky... But I was hopeing for a baked french fry with a lot more zip and flavor.  I could taste the basil but I barely noticed the Parmesan.  The fries turned out ok, but I'll be experimenting to find a more flavorful fry.  Maybe I'll try adding dijon mustard to the mix next time.

These were good.  I'm not sure I liked the parm cheese and I think a little olive oil would have made them better.  Overall great healthy choice though.

these were good.  made them for lunch for the kids and their friends.  
I did think they were a touch bland - next time i may add some italian seasonings to them.  I did spray them with 'cant believe its not butter' butter instead of cooking spray. 
will make again !   :)

Good, basic recipe. I heavily sprayed my sheet with olive oil and turned the fries every 5 minutes or so and had no problems with sticking.  I seasoned with Italian seasoning, garlic salt, and parmesan.  We dipped in BBQ.

I didn't really like this recipe.  I've baked fries before so I knew what to expect, as far as texture is concerned, but I thought the flavors were bland.  I even added more salt (after the fact) hoping to give it a little more excitement but it just didn't work.  Maybe I did something wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used fresh grated parmesan instead of the parmesan that comes in a can.  Was that what went wrong?

I made therses last night however I tried to remember the recipe instead of writing it down so I ended up using parsley instead of basil.  However they were still very good!  I dipped them in a bit of sour cream.

This is an excellent way to spice up homemade fries. As another reviewer noted, I found the ziplock method works best by shaking all the ingredients together first and then dumping them on a pan and spreading them out.

They're good and a healthier alternative to fried French fries. Next time, a little more salt may be used.

This was easy to make and the seasoning was perfect. Since it was baked rather than fried, it was a healthier choice in the end.

I have made these with both fresh potatoes and also frozen french fries. Both were good (potatoes were better). I added garlic powder and used the suggestion of putting all ingredients in a ziploc bacg to shake everything together. Turned out great!

Great recipe. I used the advice of a reviewer before me and used frozen fries. The only other change I made was I used EVOO instead of cooking spray. Turned out great :)

I made these as an afternoon snack for the grands. Like Linda, I chose to use frozen fries. I used shoestring potatoes & I let them thaw first. I drizzled w/ olive oil instead of using spray & I added garlic powder...these were very tasty! Thansk!

I cheated with this recipe and used frozen french fries. If you're in a hurry, they work out really well. My oldest daughter doesn't eat potatoes very often but she even loved these. I added garlic and onion powders to the mix and everyone raved about the parm cheese addition. Really tasty and thanks so much!

This was the best baked fries recipe I've made so far. There's no need for any ketchup either. The only thing I added was the garlic salt and drizzled olive oil over the fries before I shaked everything up in a bag. Turning the fries 1/2 way through cooking gave them an even golden brown.

All I can say is yummy!!  I just eye balled the basil and cheese.  I also added some garlic salt.   If you toss them half way though cooking all sides will get crispy.  Next time I think I will also add some oil, cause some of the fries got stuck.  Goes great with Grilled cheese

I liked the fries but they were only crispy on one side.  Also, next time Im going to add garlic and a lot more salt on top of the fries before I bake them.

These french fries are SOOOO good.  I couldn't believe how good they were, and that they were baked not fried!  I used garlic salt and onion powder to season them, and also used olive oil as some of the other reviews suggested.  I didn't spray the pan before baking, thinking that they were oily enough as to not need it, but after about 20 minutes I pulled them out to flip them, and found that they were sticking.  I quickly sprayed the pan, flipped them, and returned them to the oven for another 10 to 12 minutes.  They were crisp and browned.  My husband said they were the best french fries he's ever tasted!

Tastes great and family really enjoyed this recipe! Took the advice of a previous reviewer and used olive oil instead of cooking spray and put everything into a large plastic bag to toss. This will be a keeper!

I really like these. I wasn't sure about how the basil would taste on the fries but it was good. I did cheat though because I used crinkle cut fries! It still worked out great!

I love this recipe!  I usually use Italian seasoning (instead of basil), and sometimes I've even tried other types of seasoning, just for the variety.  It's all good!  I use my crinkle cutter to make the fries look "authentic".  My entire family enjoys this recipe.

These fries were good but nothing to write home about. I made them with a turkey burger recipe from this site and it was a nice healthy meal.

I've been making fries like this for years.  I use a little seasoned salt and Emeril's Essence.  My family loves them.  It's such a healthy and easy alternative to frozen fries....NO TRANS FAT in these fries.

Okay.  Didn't have as much taste as I was hoping for.  Maybe I kept them in the oven too long.  Next time will try with sweet potatoes.

Great recipe.    Interesting taste with the cheese but would subsitute garlic or seasoning salt instead of basil.

This was a nice little side dish to go along with grilled burgers. I cheated and used frozen steak fries and they tasted just fine. My kids wouldn't try them but my husband liked them a lot.

These were very good but did stick to the baking sheet a little even when I sprayed it with non-stick cooking spray. My question is how do you slice them in 1/4 strips then lay them in the pan skin side down??  It's obvious that the only pieces with skin will be the ends (no matter how you slice it) :)
I used the suggestion of one review who shook them in a bag with olive oil & the seasonings - very good.

Excellent!  Even my french-fry- connoiseur husband thought they were swell.  They sure beat the greasy deep fried ones.  I shake them in a ziplock bag with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Great!

I have made this recipe at least 30 times. I like them almost as much as real french fries and they are so much healthier. I use garlic salt instead of the toppings in the recipe and they are quite good. I recently moved into an apartment where the oven is broken and these fries are the one thing that makes me miss having an oven the most.
