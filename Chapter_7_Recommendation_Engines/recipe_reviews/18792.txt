I made some modifications to the recipe and it turned out really good!  I ommitted the shrimp and ground beef, reduced the soy sauce to three Tablespoons, reduced the green onions to only two stalks, doubled the chili sauce, and most importantly, I used three skinny Japanese eggplants instead of one large regular eggplant.  It tasted just as good as I've had it at my favorite Chinese restaurant!

I also used skinny Japanese eggplants. It is more tender and better for Asian recipes.
I used julianned pork cutlets instead of shrimp and grouned beef for the ultimate authentic flavor.
I sauteed the pork with ginger, garlic and half the scallions quickly with a little veg. oil than remove it from the pan to set aside. in the same pan I sauteed the eggplants in a little bit more oil until almost tender than combined pork, eggplant, sauces,cornstarch last in the pan to let the flavors marry and thicken.
In the end i sprinkled rest of the scallions and drizzled with seasame oil. Saute to combine and serve.
It is SOOOO good !

I substituted the shrimp and beef for chicken since I was trying to duplicate
my favorite dish at PF Changs, it was delicious!  My boyfriend, who is very skeptical
of eggplant, thought it was great too.

So good! It looks like a lot of ingredients, but this is pretty simple to make. I've omitted the ginger and shrimp both times that I've made this, and it was still great. I agree with other reviewers that ground pork is the more traditional ingredient, but I've used sliced beef in this, and the flavours complement very well. 

This is really saucy, so serve it with lots of fluffy rice. Putting this over Pad Thai also gives a nice change. Vegetarians could omit the meat and use cubed, crumbled, or fried tofu instead. It's actually one of my favourite ways to eat tofu. Thanks Minhuey, for giving me a taste of mom's home cooking!

I really enjoyed this recipe - the closest I could find to a dish I have often enjoyed in Hong Kong.  However, in Hong Kong it is made with ground pork NOT beef.  And I found the proportions reversed - there should be a lot more eggplant than meat.  After reading the other reviews I slightly reduced each of the chicken stock, soy sauce and oyster sauce and the saltiness was perfect.

The sauce was amazing. The ground beef can be substituted with ground pork - tastes amazing! And it's healthier, other spicy eggplant dishes require you to fry the eggplant in tons of oil. I will use this eggplant recipe from now on.

This recipe was a bit salty, so I cut back the soy sauce to 3 tablespoons.  I skipped the meat and only used tofu and eggplant and it was great.  The salty/sweet/spicy flavour is intense.  I've made this several times and it's always a hit.

8.26.11  ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18792/szechuan-spicy-eggplant/ ... Very good!  I listened to the other reviewers' comments & reduced the soy to 4t.  'Would've used 2t oyster sauce, but I was out.  'Rest of the measurements as written.  I used the white half of the green onions in the first part so they got cooked & the green half at the end.  Only problem, which really wasn't, was there wasn't any sauce to thicken.  I used the full smount of sauce for one pound of eggplant.  The chili sauce, the Chinese type - not the ketchup cousin, added just a little spice.  I'd say kidfriendly spice amount.  For adults, I'd add more - & will.  :)  OH, OH, OH, I kinda did change a few more things now that I'm rereading the recipe.  Oops.  I didn't have any ginger root (didn't add powdered either) & didn't add any shrimp or meat.  I did add a little tofu - maybe a third of a package, about a cup & half or so.  It, along with the green onions, helped with the appearance.  'Think the (sesame) oil amount should be 1t.  Huh, maybe not.  With the addition of meat, you may want that much.  Anyway, it was good & I think you should try it.  It's not the prettiest dish you'll see, but it is very good.  'Kinda cute that the eggplant seeds look like sesame seeds on the finished product. Note4Me:  If you add enough sauce ingredietnts, no need to cover for cooking.  Two large eggplants, one zucch, one squash, three mush, half can o water chestnuts needed an 8qt(?) stock/soup pot.9/12recip

The eggplant is just like a sponge that soaks up the sauce's flavor.  A VERY tasty stir fry but I too used chicken instead of beef and shrimp.  If you are going to serve this over rice, I think doubling the sauce is a good idea.  I made this a second time using chicken, green onion, red bell pepper, sugar snap peas and of course the eggplant and served it over brown rice.  I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 based on my second impression...

Yummy! I love anything with eggplant in it, so when I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it. I followed everything on here except a few minor changes. 

Instead of green onions, I used cilantro, due to me not having any. Also, I used chicken instead of shrimp and ground beef. 

I will definantly make sure I have all the ingredients next time and follow the recipe as is. 

I do have to say, the flavor was great! I loved the ginger in it. I can also taste the soy sauce and oyster sauce. I didn't expect it to be as spicy as it was, but, just that tiny teaspoon of chili sauce did it. I didn't have to add any extra before I ate.

This recipe is gorgeous and so economical.  I always omit the shrimp because my husband is allergic.  It also freezes well so I make a big batch up and freeze some. Maybe we have bigger eggplants in Canada but I never use as much eggplant as the recipe calls for.  Definitely a week night staple.  I have to remember to try it with ground pork.

Thank you for sharing your Mom's delicious recipe; through you she has brought great culinary happiness into my home.

I did not  make changes to your heirloom recipe, so my 5-star rating reflects my experience with the recipe as handed down and not my version of it: this is not a rating of my own personal interpretation, or  cooking skills, or pantry contents, but an honest  review of the recipe as writen, and let me say it was absolutely wonderful without modification!

Flavors are perfect. I swapped surf/turf for bird... I love chicken w.szechuan eggplant from my wok-n-good local spot...and they NEVER seem to have the eggplant lately so I had to figure it out myself.

The main problem for me here was texture.  I will try not to overcook it next time.

I had chicken tenders and eggplant in the fridge that I needed to cook up so I found this recipe an
decided to give it a try. Delish.  I cut the tenders into chunks, floured, and browned in oil.  My thinking was I wanted a crispy chicken to counter balance the soft eggplant. I did increase the garlic and did double the sauce. I cooked the eggplant with the garlic and ginger first  and browned the chicken in a separate pan. Added sauce and thicken and tossed chicken in last. Family said they'd like to try the ground beef & Shrimp  as well so I guess I'm as making this again.

This recipe will be in my dinner rotation.  I used Japanese eggplant and white eggplant.  I substituted teryaki sauce for oyster sauce.  It turned out great!  I also used more shrimp and no ground beef, as I am not a huge red meat fan.

I thought this recipe was such a great idea. I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. I didn't like the combination of hamburger and shrimp. Next time I'll use chicken, I think that will be much better! Also, the cooking time the recipe stated for the egg plant is way to long. When mine was done it was pretty mushy. Next time I'm only going to cook it for a couple minutes. The sauce actually tasted super good! I'll cook this again for sure, but with chicken and less cooking time for the egg plant. Also, I like really spicy food and this to me had absolutley NO spice to it. I'll add some extra kick to it next time too.

Great flavor in this dish. Also very quick and easy to pull together for an impressive dinner. I used Japanese long skinny eggplant, and pork strips because that is what I had available and it was over the top for flavor! I doubled the sauce mixture also because I served this over rice and I wanted the extra sauces. Great recipe, very authentic.

I have always wanted to try eggplant from a Chinese restaurant but wasn't sure if I would like it. This is a really good recipe with some tweaks according to your tastes. I agree with another reviewer that the eggplant really absorbs the flavor of the sauce. Yum! I left out the ground beef but wish I would have subbed with other veggies. The eggplant/ shrimp combo seemed a little too "meaty" for me. I halved the amount of soy and oyster sauce ( I think there may have been a typo there) so it wasn't too salty. This makes a very saucy dish that went well over brown rice. Next time I would add celery for some crunch and wait to add the shrimp. It was a little overdone.

I was happy to discover this recipe as my own mother used to make something similar to this but without meat. The flavor that came out of this recipe was just as I remembered and was perfect over rice. I think I could make this every day if I could.

This was a great recipe!  My Chinese friend had made this for me (got the recipe off a website in Chinese!) and I loved it, so I was stoked to find a recipe in English!  I made a few alterations: - I used beef cut into small pieces instead of ground beef.  It was so tender and delicious!  I marinated the meat in half of the sauce that would normally just be added to the ground beef during cooking.  It was very flavorful. - I reduced the green onion to two and added a huge handful of fresh basil at the end, just after turning off the heat.  That's what my friend had done, and it added such aroma and flavor! - I didn't have any oyster sauce, but we hadn't had any when she made it either, so I added some sugar and vinegar in its place.  I also didn't use chili sauce, but rather chopped up some dry red peppers instead.  It was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe that could be easily tweaked with what I had on hand.

Yum!!! We really like this type dish and it went fast with no leftovers. I changed the recipe by combining it with the P.F. Changs recipe ingredients. I prefer the cooking method of Minhueys  recipe though, as it doesn't require to deep fry the eggplant, which makes it a healthier dish.I used 2 Tablespoons of soy sauce instead of 4, 1 tablespoon sugar instead of a teaspoon, 2 to 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1 clove and I added to the sauce 1 tablespoon white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil. No black pepper. and added the rest of the infredients to the sauce. Also I substituted the beef and shrimp for boneless ground chicken breast which I ground on the food processor. Then  I follow the rest of Minhuey's recipe cooking steps. This was gooooood!!!!

Really good- reminded me more of lobster sauce than Szechuan so next time I will double up on the chili sauce (and I'm a whimp). I swapped chicken for the shrimp and ground turkey for the ground beef, but I feel this is a very forgiving recipe. Bonus, it really only took 30 minutes total. Keeper!

Szechuan Eggplant w/Twice-cooked Pork is my favorite dish at our local Chinese restaurant.  I use this recipe, but without the shrimp and beef.  It tastes awesome!

Thank you for this really great recipe.  I make it all the time now for my family and even the finnicky ones eat it all gone.

I don't cook with corn starch so I used about 3-4 tablespoons flour (depending on the thickness you desire) and mixed it with 1/2 cup chicken broth. Used white pepper as a matter of preference to bring out a more asian flavor and omitted the shrimp/beef. I have used powdered ginger or omitted it altogether - the taste doesn't suffer with or without it. I caramelize some diced sweet onions and add mushrooms. This recipe is also very good with tofu. Seems to take me more than 30 minutes, because it takes awhile for the eggplant to get soft, I'd say the last 15 minutes or so is spent keeping it low on the stove and stirring every so often to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. I can't handle too much spiciness so I only added about 1 teaspoon of chili paste for flavor. Love it - thanks!

Very good, but I made it on the spicier side and served it alongside Coconut Jasmine Rice (recipe here). I also added a 2 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar which really made the flavors pop. Kid and hubby loved it. Will be making it again and probably adding mushrooms and baby corn for added texture.

This turned out soooo good, much better than expected! I wanted to try something different with ground beef and what little ingredients i had on hand. I had to substitute sliced green peppers instead of eggplant and didn't have any shrimp to add but kept the rest of the ingredients as is. I separated the ground beef very well and instead of only browning it cooked until it started to turn crispy before adding the vegs and sauce. It was a little on the salty side but i like it that way, and not too spicy for the whimpy members of the family although I did add extra chili sauce to my bowl. This seems like a recipe that can work with whatever combination of meat and vegetables you have on hand!

Overall a tasty recipe, but 1lb of ground beef was too much. I used 3 long skinny eggplants, which were drowning in the beef.  I have to agree with another reviewer that the dish is traditionally made with ground pork. One thing I did differently from the recipe was instead of cooking the shrimp first, I threw it into the pan for the last 5 min.
I would make this recipe again, but use 1/2 lb ground turkey instead of beef, add more chili sauce, and less soy sauce (replace with more soup stock). I might even add 1/2 lb of tofu too.

Good, simple, easy to make.  Used ground turkey instead of ground beef, but I thought the sauce was too salty.  I ended up adding tofu at the end to try to tone down the saltiness.

The flavor of this was delicious.  I made it vegetarian, without the beef or shrimp.  My only complaint is that somehow when I added the cornstarch mixture, it became way too thick.  Also, I would keep an eye on the eggplant 15 mins covered might be too long.

You can use chicken, shrimp, ground meat, or thinly sliced meat. It goes well with everything. Make sure to include the fresh ginger root. It's what gives it the authentic Chinese cuisine flavour, along with the sauces of course.

This was the first time I've made eggplant and I was trying to find a recipe my picky husband would eat. We both loved it! I didn't have chile paste, so I used about 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Also, just used tofu, no meat or fish. Eggplant keeps a nice texture. Served over rice. Awesome!

I LOVE eggplant, especially Chinese restaurant style, and I found this very tasty! Really good over rice. The eggplant dishes were always my favourite dishes as a kid growing up in a Chinese home and I'm so glad I can make it myself at home now. I used Chinese eggplant (the long skinny kind), omitted shrimp and used ground pork instead of beef. I didn't have oyster sauce at home and used hoisin sauce instead. Will definitely make this again

The oyster sauce and chili sauce makes this dish - even if you put just a little of each in it.  I use pork instead of beef and add cubed tofu to it after adding the eggplant.  Those who have too salty a soy sauce - just add less.  Same with chicken stock - add less boullion and more water.

I find the japanese style eggplant doesn't work as well on this dish.  The eggplant tends to turn an unappetizing brown after cooking with the lid on.  The big deep purple eggplants work well with this dish.  

Great recipe for this eggplant lover - thanks for submitting it!

Taking the suggestions from the reviews, I used tofu in lieu of the shrimp and ground beef.  I also used lite soy sauce, low-sodium & fat-free chicken broth.  Since I had no oyster sauce, I used leftover champagne for both the oyster sauce and the water.  I also used chili paste with garlic rather than chili sauce.  I did not add the tablespoon of oil. I thought the taste was just right--spicy but not overwhelming and not too salty.  I will make this again.

This was very good.I used about a pound of very firm tofu,pressed and marinated for about half an hour,instead of the meats.It worked nicely.Also,I din't have any oyster sauce left,so I didn't use that.It was about salty enough for my taste,i probably could have added a couple more Tbs. soy sauce.Over all very tasty.

I am trying to lose a little weight and eating vegetarian more often so I was looking for an eggplant recipe.

 I omitted the shrimp and beef, cut the soy sauce to 2 tablespoons and added some peanuts and diced baby corn to make up for the missing meat.  After sauteing the garlic, onions and ginger, this wonderful dish was done in ten minutes. There was absolutely no need to add a thickening agent. Yes, I did use chicken stock, but the orthodox could use veggie stock.

This can be a master recipe for many combos of vegetables. If I were to make it with meat, I would use the shrimp and sub ground pork for the beef.

Thanks for a keeper!

I used just two chicken thighs,and Thai holy basil  instead of the chili sauce,as it was on hand. Also used aq bit of sesame oil instead of spraying the pan

I have made many variations of this recipe, and this was great with my substitutions. Not too much chicken, but enough to enhance flavor. 

Especially like the small amount of oil.

This recipe is way too salty. I even halved the soy sauce (used only 2 Tablespoon) and it was light soy sauce at that! I would make it again but would omit adding the cornstarch/water mixture.

VERY salty!  Also lacks that overtone of sweetness that szechuan usually has.

This is very close to a favorite dish of mine at PF Changs.  I cut up chicken breast instead of ground beef and I exclude the sugar.  I've also used a yellow and red onion when I did not have green onion on hand.  It is wonderful, my new weekly dish!  I serve it with brown rice.

We  made this with bison, not beef and shrimp. We liked this recipe, but have vowed to make it better for our taste. Next time we make it, we will reduce the soy sauce, double the garlic and ginger, and eliminate the corn starch.  We didn't have much sauce to go over the rice, and imagine our liquids were less because we used bison (less fat than beef).  But, hey...it got Brian to eat the eggplant. Cheers!

Yummy! I had 3 Japanese eggplants instead of the large one. I also did not use any shrimp. It turned out so yummy! I think the only con to this dish is that the sesame oil at the end can be a little much. I put less but it still seemed like a little too much. I don't usually cook with eggplant, but this recipe is definitely going to be a repeat! Thanks!

I feel like I did something wrong here given all of the rave reviews. The recipe had a potentially great flavor, but was so salty I could barely eat it. I only added 3 tbs soy sauce instead of the full 4. I did use only eggplant (4 Japanese) and no meat, so that probably made the difference. I will likely try this recipe again, but would recommend that if you only use eggplant use maybe 1.5-2 tbs light soy sauce and low sodium chicken broth, or even add some water to the sauce.

Terrific recipe!  I substituted tapioca starch for the corn starch to make it a more authentic textured sauce.  I also allowed the dish to sit for a few minutes as it is tastier at a luke warm temp as the flavors can balance.

I'm giving it 4 stars because I modified it a bit to suit my tastes: reduced soy sauce to 2T, used Chinese eggplants instead of one large eggplant, substituted about 1/2 lb. ground pork and 1/2 lb. cubed tofu for the shrimp and ground beef.  Served over rice and it turned out great.

a quick healthy meal. i didn't add the shrimp. i used turkey ground meat instead, which is lower in fat but lamb or pork would have been more flavorful. i also added 1/4c. chopped onion, a bell pepper, and about 1/2lb green beans with a spritz of fresh lime and sprinkle of cilantro.

I substituted a 12-oz package of silken tofu for the shrimp, but otherwise I followed the recipe closely.  It was very good and I would make it again, possibly adding more garlic, ginger, green onions and chili sauce (I like spicy!).

I found this recipe quite bland. I was pretty disappointed as I am a HUGE eggplant fan. But, my sister, for whom I made this recipe, was impressed. I used seasoned tofu instead of any meat and added Kecap Manis at the end for a bit more flavor.

Really tasty dish. Has all the right ingredients for bold flavor yet I'm a tough critic when it comes to spicy. I'm sure I used the wrong chili sauce, but Thai Sweet red chili sauce was all the store had in the asian section.  So I added about 3 T of chili paste and a few heavy dashes of red pepper flakes and it was perfect.  Because my husband says I love salt more than the avg person, I used low sodium soy sauce and reduced to 3T (mistake) and low sodium chicken broth.  Next time I'll use 5 T low sod. soy sauce, and 1/2 C broth, since sauce wasn't as thick or salty as I'd like. I used 1/2 lb ground pork, and left out the shrimp. It was a satisfying portion of meat I thought. I would have used tofu but it was passed it's best buy date(darn).  I also thought it could have been better with a crunch to it.  I might try a bell pepper or cashews next time.  I served it over Maifun rice sticks but next time I'm going with sticky rice. I love anything spicy and eggplant is my new favorite veggie, I'm anxious to make this again.

This was pretty tasty, but not altogether great.  I think I might have enjoyed it better with a different meat, like others have suggested, rather than staying with the beef and the shrimp.

Yum!! Will make this again.  I used 1T spicy garlic sauce, because I like spicy.  Also substituted 1/2 lb Morningstar 'beef", because my boyfriend doesn't eat beef.  Used one whole pound shrimp.  Loved the flavors of the sauce!

It was kind of bland.  I used 3x as much chili sauce and it didn't seem at all spicy to me.  Also, I should have heeded the warning about saltiness.  Definately use low sodium soy sauce unless you like salty foods.

Not what I would call authentic chinese resturaunt style szechuan, but very good nevertheless. I really enjoyed the flavors of the sauce. I doubled the garlic and added more oyster sauce and extra eggplant. The oyster sauce really does add a very nice flavor. I used thinly sliced pork instead of the ground beef because I have never had ground beef in an asian dish in my life, so it just didn't sound right. Next time I would use only shrimp, as I don't care for many mixed meats in my food and seafood or chicken is my preference. All in all, very good, if not authentic, recipe. Thanks!

This recipe was way too salty!  I substituted no-chicken/vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and didn't use the ground beef, but it was incredibly salty. I added extra broth and some sweet chili sauce to tone it down, and it was okay.   I will try it again, but with only 2 Tb of soy sauce, and hope that this will improve things tremendously.

The dish was delicious but a little on the salty side for me (I rarely add salt to any of my dishes). So for the average or better salt lovers this salt level will suffice.

My fat man AND my 15 yo  boy both hooped and hollered.  This recipe is now a permanent fixture at my house. 

I prepped everything over the weekend (pre measured sauce ingredients in a jar, sliced the eggplant) so Monday night after work, all I had to do was throw everything in my wok and cook it up!  took me about 15 minutes. 

I took the advice of others and cut the soy in half.
I used 'real' Korean chili paste instead of chili sauce (because I had it) 

THIS IS A FANTASTIC RECIPE!

This was good, but not good enough to justify all the ingredients included.  It's a keeper, but not a regular rotation item, I think.

Excellent! Hubby can't stop raving about it and he's not really an eggplant fan! Will definitely make again! BTW, I made it with spicy ground pork sausage and no shrimp(didn't have any)! Still yummy!

I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the soy sauce down to 3 TBSP and doubled the chili sauce. It was still a bit salty for my liking and would recommend using only 2 TBSP of soy sauce. I also used half Chinese eggplant and half Thai eggplant. Delish!

I did not find it spicy at all. I  also did not make this recipe for myself since I don't like eggplant, BUT the seasonings are awesome and I will def use this recipe w/o eggplant and shrimp. I used a Japanese eggplant and left out oyster sauce and shrimp. I made a side of jasmine rice using vegetable broth vs water and tossed some lemon peels in before rice was finished to make the rice more fragrant. The recipe and the jasmine rice are a perfect pair.  I did eat this, picking out the eggplant. Very pleased with flavors.

I didn't have oyster sauce, so I used fish sauce and also I didn't have corn starch so I used corn meal and flour as a thickener, and it still came out great. I also added a chopped hot pepper and it added some needed heat. Great dish, I will make it again.

It was good but by no means spicy!  I only added 2 TBSP. of soy sauce, per others' suggestions and didn't have any shrimp.  I can't imagine putting the shrimp in before the beef, though!

Like many of you, I also substituted chicken for the shrimp and beef.  It turned out really nicely.  Since my one eggplant was rather large, I upped the amount of chicken stock, did 3 tablespoons of oyster sauce, as well as adding a bit of hoisin and some sweet chili sauce.  Instead of just using a chili sauce (as I had none on hand) -- I substituted srirachi, which is an awesome garlic chili sauce.  Upped the garlic and green onions, subbed ginger powder for root, as well as adding sesame seeds (instead of oil) at the end.  I just used what I had on hand, and it turned out great!  It is a must with rice so soak up the delicious salty, semi-sweet spicy sauce.

Great recipe. But I made several changes: 1) Reduce soy sauce to 2T. Use light soy sauce like Kikkoman. 2) More eggplant 3) 1/2 lb ground beef 4) Use 1 T chili garlic sauce instead of chili sauce 5) 2 T of oyster sauce and 2 T of black bean sauce  The black bean sauce makes all the difference. Trust me!

This was pretty good...it was a little salty for my taste...I think I would use even less soy sauce next time? I used 2 T. of soy sauce and 1 T hoisin and then doubled the chili sauce. I still think it was too much salt...I also didn't add the chicken stock. I served over noodles. Overall pretty tasty.

This is very good. I used ground turkey instead of beef and skipped the shrimp (didn't have it on hand). Next time I will use more eggplant, it was my favorite part, and more garlic.  My husband really liked it as well.

This was Very good! I followed the ingredients exactly, and directions closely. I think the shrimp should be added the last 5 mins or so of the cooking process. It should cook for just a few mins or it will end up rubbery. Flavor was good but needs to be eaten with rice as it was a bit salty.Will make again =)

My husband loved this recipe.  We have always liked the spicy eggplant dishes we have had at Chinese restaurants.  Previous eggplant recipes I have found always called for deep frying the eggplant. I made a few changes to the recipe,  I substituted ground turkey and omitted the shrimp.

I loved this recipe.  I have made similar sauces before, so I knew I'd like it.  
Instead of meat and shrimp, I used one 16 oz package of extra firm tofu (cut into big cubes) and 2 Italian eggplants.

I served it with Chinese noodles and it mixed well with them.

Loved the flavor! I added too much chili sauce because I read other reviews that suggested more spice -- maybe the chili sauce I have is super spicy, but a little bit goes a long way.  I also just used eggplant, without meat or shrimp, as I was cooking for a vegetarian guest. Definitely will make again, probably with ground pork.

We love this dish. I've made it without the shrimp and I've used some roasted chicken for the meat. It was excellent each time. Thanks for a new way to fix eggplant.

It was delicious!! We made several substitutions based on what we had; we used ground turkey instead of beef, hot chillies diced finely instead of chili sauce, and regular onion instead of green onions and it was hot and delicious! Great, definitely a new staple in our house!

I found this recipe very bland. Definitly more Western then Szechuan in this recipe.

The Beef just doesn't suit this recipe and there is too much of it. Could be worth a try with minced pork instead. It also needs a boost to all the flavours that make Szechuan food taste so good.

This was so delicious!!!  Before this, anytime I made chinese food at home, it would turn out so-so at best, but this was amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just right.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I had an eggplant that I didn't know what to do with when I found this recipe.  Due to my own mistakes (not reading the recipe all fully), the dish wasn't much to look at when it was done, but it tasted great.  I substituted tofu; drained, marinated in the sauce, and crubled; for beef.  It was really tasty and I will try making it again.

Very tasty recipe!  I doubled the eggplant, omitted the shrimp and added fresh mushrooms.  I aslo didn't have oyster sauce, so I used a thick teriyaki glaze sauce.  It's a great recipe--because you can adjust it any way you want and it still comes out delish (ie: add more garlic, ginger, chili, or omit things).  Great recipe to try!

I was skeptical at first, but oh my gosh, this stuff is AWESOME!  Different, but absolutely delicious.  Add a little extra Thai chili sauce if you want it really spicy.

Good, simple recipe. Next time though, I would add more eggplant than calls for in recipe. They mostly disintegrate as it cooks down. I also added frozen peas to cut the saltiness.

Well, let me first say that I'm allergic to shellfish, so the shrimp and oyster sauce were left out.  I made the recipe with a combo of ground beef and pork because I've seen this dish traditionally made with pork.  I also was really tempted to drain off the fat, but didn't because the recipe didn't say to- next time I will.  I served it over rice noodles and it was BLAND.  Not nearly spicy enough.  I ended up adding 2 tbs of chili paste and then it was oh so yummy.  I still think I need to add something in place of oyster sauce to give it depth..maybe a hoisin, fish or teryaki sauce instead?  Next time I will make it with 2 tbs of chili paste and add another eggplant because it really cooks down and becomes unnoticeable in the dish.  My husband didn't even know eggplant was in it until I told him.  Oh, and over a package of rice noodles, this easily serves 6-8.  I would give it 4 stars, but my husband hated it, so I'll have to settle for 3.

OH my god!!!  This was great!  I have made it twice in two days!  The first time, I didn't have any beef but made it anyways, the next time made it with beef!  MMMMMMMMmmmmmm!!  No need to go to the restuarant!  I did make more of the sauce though.  I like it juicy.  Also, it goes well over ramen noodles!

I loved it!  It's a very comforting and hearty one dish meal served over rice.  The flavors are excellent and blend together perfectly.  I had no shrimp but the ground beef alone was enough.  Used 3-4 augbergine eggplants (long and skinny).  This recipe has passed the test into my regular rotation!

Substituted ground chicken for the shrimp and beef, Japanese eggplants instead of regular, reduced the soy sauce to 2 TBSP and used 1 TSP. garlic chili paste instead of the chili sauce... and had a VERY close replica of PF Chiang's Spicy Eggplant with Ground Chicken!  It took some tweaking, but I was eventually very pleased with the outcome!

I enjoyed the infusion of all the different spices.  Next time I will probably leave out the eggplant.  I'm just not an eggplant fan.  Will probably replace with stir-fry vegetables.  Otherwise really good.

Not as bad as I had expected. I reduce the amount of soysauce as the other reviewers suggested. So the dish was not salty but seemed to lack something. Next time I would add more chili sauce. Good with steamed rice.

I left out all the meat and it was still great.  So flavorful and easy.  My husband wasn't crazy about it, said if felt "greasy" in his mougth, but I think he's nuts.  Will definately make again.  Used sicilian eggplant, the subtle sweetness really added to the recipe.  No need to serve over rice because of the thick, gooey sauce!
