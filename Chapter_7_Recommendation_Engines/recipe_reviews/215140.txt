This recipe has been in our family for generations - at least since my great-grandmothe.  We don't kput sugar in the plums, but instead when finished cut them open and put on cinnamon and sugar when we are eating them.

An old family friend used add grated lemon peel to the bread crumbs and cinnamon with the sugar. We used to eat them with icing (powdered) sugar. Just couldn't get enough of them. She also used apricots as well. Just couldn't get enough of them!!

like my mom would make. Though her recipe was German and she would add a sugar cube to the centre.
