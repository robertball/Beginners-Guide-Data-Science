Not bad for a quick cheap meal. I left out the chicken bouillon and turmeric as I didn't have any on hand. I used instant rice and the diced tomatoes instead of tomato paste (what I had). Thanks Mika.

I made this vegetarian with tofu hot dogs and vegetable bouillon. I did reduce the rice and increase the water a bit-- otherwise it would have been more like a casserole than a soup. It turned out really tasty and went well with the quesadillas I served alongside. Even the picky eaters in my house liked it. I will be making this one again!

We like this! It's something very simple to throw together when you have very few ingredients on hand. I usually have hot dogs in the freezer and rice in the cabinet. Great weeknight meal!

I had to keep adding water to this and it still came out more like a stew than a soup. I also had trouble getting the rice to cook. I had to let it simmer a lot longer than 20 minutes. If you want this to be more of a soup I recommend halving the rice onion and hot dogs. The flavor was great and I will make it again just maybe with more broth.

It wasn't bad at all. I didn't us tomato paste or tumeric cause I didn't have any on hand. Instead of chicken bouillon cubes I used beef and instead of onions I used onion powder and it still came out good.

I made this for Dad and I. He likes southern cooking so I thought this might be a good one for him. He loved it! I saved the leftovers in the freezer for when we don't want to cook. Because these ingredients were all I had I typed them into google and this recipe came up. I never would have put these ingredients together otherwise! Thank you Allrecipes contributor Mika Yemin-Daniel!
