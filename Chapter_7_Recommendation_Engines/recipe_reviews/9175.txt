I did not like this recipe at all. The taste of ginger was overpowering!

The conserve didn't thicken up even after simmering longer than what the recipe called for.  It wasn't bad (it tasted good on hot cereal), but I don't think I would make it again.

Great with turkey as an alternative to cranberry sauce. Nice and spicey!

This recipe turned out full of strong flavors, like ginger, but is very tasty with poultry and pork. I used frozen sour cherries rather than dried cherries and it turned out great!

I first saw this recipe in the November 1994 issue of Bon Appetite. I tried it, I loved it, and I've made it every year since. It goes especially well with a cornbread sausage stuffing. The ginger flavor is very strong, and is supposed to be, but you're not supposed to eat heaping spoons full. I add a bit to each fork full of stuffing and the combination of flavors is wonderful.
