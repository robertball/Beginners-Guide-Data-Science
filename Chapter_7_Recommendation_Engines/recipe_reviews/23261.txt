All of my family and Christmas guests LOVED this cookie; however, I found that it was actually a little too rich for our tastes when dipped in chocolate or made into a sandwhich cookie; we thought that it was perfect on it's own, without the melted chocolate.

These are very good cookies. I used soft mint white and red candy and it worked out great. The cookies have nice crunch and interesting flavor. I used the chocolate for pairing and drizzling the tops. Then I sprinkled them with remaining mint candy, which made a nice presentation. However I do prefere them just with chocolate (no candy topping), because then you are really able to enjoy those little crunches in the cookies.
