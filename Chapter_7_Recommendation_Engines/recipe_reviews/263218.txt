I nice flavor and one variation of cooking with a wood plank. Home Depot actually sells the cedar planks for cooking and they come in a package of 8 for about $7. I myself like to use the cedar plank on a gas grill ( Bar B Q ) with my Salmon covered in Hellman's mayonnaise and sprinkled with the table blend of Mrs. Dash. It's Awesome!!!

Very simple and easy recipe, only change;  a dash of lemon pepper. The cedar planks add a hint of wood flavor to the fish.

Had weekend guests, dinner for 6 along with steamed asparagus topped with lemon zest and a brown tomato/avocado salad.

My friend Cathy kept quiet, apparently she doesn't care for salmon, but she loved it!
