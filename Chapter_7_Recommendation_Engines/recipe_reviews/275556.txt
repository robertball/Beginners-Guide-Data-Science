It was delicious. The only thing I did differently was I added zucchini since they are so abundant now. Yum, yum it was!

Growing up in the south, this was  a food, fried, usually crookneck, squash upon which I grew up. I selected this recipe tonight just to get my ratio of  onions to squash clear. And yes I changed it, I added more onions.  

A short-coming of the recipe was no reference to the fact that it is cooked and turned frequently  to mix a browned (caramelized) layer and flavor into the whole end result. And that cannot be done in 15 to 20 minutes. To evaporate all the excess water and carefully brown the squash takes an hour!
