Wonderful! This is exactly how coconut ice is supposed to taste and how I remember it from my childhood. 
(I suspect some of the other reviewers might have used sweetened coconut instead of plain flaked coconut, that would definitely make this too sweet.)

I didn't have any nonsweetened coconut, and I read somewhere that in that case you should decrease sugar to 1/2 cup.  Or maybe by 1/2 cup.  I don't know.  In any case, I used 2/3 c each water and sugar, the vanilla, and I cooked the coconut in syrup until the whole of it was at soft ball.  I also beat it a little much - be careful about that; stop while it's still a little drippy, or it will be crumbly later.  
The result?  It was delicious, but it made about 20 square inches.  Hmmm.  I think I'll try and get my hands on some non-sweetened coconut next time.

I agree, this receipe was way way too sweet, even for me.  It was a waste of ingredients that's for sure.

I have been looking for years for this recipe.  I tried it and it is really the best I have tasted. I do not like the "soft" coconut ice that you can buy or make.  I prefer a bit of "bite" to my coconut ice, and this really fills the bill.

Very very sweet.  I'm a huge sweet eater and I couldn't even handle these.  Very attractive, but a combo of just sugar and coconut is just too sweet.  Though they did look good on a cookie/fudge platter.

Takes me back home to Grenada! Just because of that I would give it 10 stars if I could! I enjoyed having my daughter make this with me and when I watched her eyes when she took her 1st bite it was HEAVEN! Sweet sugared coconut is all is it BUT the memories of home is worth it! I'll make it again. Thank you for this :-)

thanks for the recipe - i decreased the amount of sugar - though very sweet. Wasn't as chewy as i expected. I added strawberry flavouring instead of the colouring, which worked well with the coconut. Thanks again

I followed the instructions but ended up with a dry crumbly mixture after I added the coconut and vanilla. What did I do wrong? Also, it made such a small amount it wouldn't have filled a 7X7 pan. Help, as I really wanted to make this for my Christmas Candy tray. Barbara

My father is lactose intolerant and loves fudge.  We used to get coconut ice from a fudge guy at the fair each year when I was younger but he hasn't been there the last faw years.  Dad loves this stuff but it is very sweet!!  Better if you blend the coconut down so it's more fine.

This worked okay. I had to make two batches of it though, because half of the original recipe only covered half of my pan! I flavored the entire first batch with vanilla and cut the sugar back to 1 cup since I used sweetened coconut. The second batch I flavored with strawberry and used hot pink food coloring. it turned out pretty sweet, but it wasn't too bad. My kids really liked the pink/strawberry combo, and asked me to experiment with other colors & flavors too!

Great Recipe!! I was looking for a recipe that would wow and this certainly fit the bill. I made it twice....once using sugar and once using Splenda. It turned out good both times. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

As per other reviews, I used unsweetened flaked coconut in mine and substituted cherry berry flavouring too for the bottom layer, and they turned out fine. They are very pretty to look at -my bottom layer turned a nice light pink colour-, even though my boyfriend was not fond of them, but he doesn't like coconut. Not sure if I will be making them again, but thanks for sharing anyways, Emma.

Lovley. Tasted just like i remembred from my childhood when mum made it. I used Dessicated Coconut, and used a candy thermometer to measure exactly  the right temperature. I found that you didn't have to beat it very long at all (3-4 mins) before it started to thicken, the moment it does - pour into the pan! If you beat it too long it gets too thick, and will crumble once set.  I will be making t again.

Taste was great but 7x7 pan was too big for what I wanted.  I think 5x5 might give me the results I want.

They were very good. I loved them. It took a while for them to cook as it took a long time for them to reach 240 degrees. Also at the end they kept crumbling apart so they did not look very good. They were very tasty. Thank you!

Wanted to love this, but eh. Even if you time it perfectly, and don't end up with sugary sand, the end result it still pretty much a coconut flavored sugar cube. Not awful, but not really worth the ingredients or effort.

I tried this yesterday, don't have a thermometer which might have hindered me, but did seem to get soft ball stage with the sugar and it 'looked' the right consistency, but then when it had cooled down it was way too hard to eat, not chewy enough, so had to throw it out unfortunatly.

My daughter had a presentation on madagascar so decided to do this it tastes amazing! I definitely recommend using flaked coconut which you can buy cheap from holland and Barrett i also think you need to break the flakes up more maybe in a nutiriblender (lesson for next time) it looks too chunky for my liking im a cake decorator and fussy lol, its well worth making and make sure you have a thermometer i used tala and it tells you when soft ball is reached

My mom always told me "if you need a thermometer, don't bake it".  Boy, was she right!  Had to throw it all out even though we tried the ball in water trick.  Save this one for the baking experts.

Followed the directions exactly (even used a digital thermometer). The result tastes moist but was still a crumbly mess!

I followed the directions, I used unsweetened coconut, it is very sweet but yummy however it didn't stick together. The pink layer and the white layer seperated from each other. most of the coconut just crumbled away.

I only gave 4 because I changed the sugar based on others' reviews. I also buy macaroon coconut (unsweetened) from an Amish store. These were wonderful! I have a horrible sweet tooth so they were great. But if you don't like "coconut flavored sugar cubes", this may not sit well with you. Thanks for the great recipe!

Lovely! A little watery I had to leave overnight in the fridge before it set and them keep in the fridge so it didn't melt again. I think maybe I needed to boil for longer so more water evapourated? Went down well with everyone though!
