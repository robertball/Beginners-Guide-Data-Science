This is a very good recipe! The only thing I did different was to cook the onion and celery directly in the roux until tender then added the okra (I used frozen becuase I could not find any fresh). I have made other gumbos that way and I hate making more pots dirty than I have to. Lazy me!:) Thanks for this wonderful recipe. The combinations are terrific.

Good soup!  I did make some changes.  I used 1/2 cup oil & 2/3 cup flour to start.  I added 2 large onions, 4 stalks celery & leaves, 5 cloves minced garlic, 1 bell pepper instead of okra, cooked 10 minutes.  Then I stirred in 8 cups of water, 2 cans chopped tomatoes, 1 tablespoon dried parsley, 1-1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon thyme, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 4 bay leaves & better than beef boullian, simmered 20 minutes or so then added 3 cans black eyed peas, no meat added but I did serve with rice which was good.

This recipe was soooooo delicious and so easy. I used fresh veggies, except for the tomatoes; I used canned, diced ones. I also added diced jalapeno peppers just to spice it up a little.  True to her word, it was even better the second day!

I will definitely make this again.  I made some changes.  First, I used smoked sausage instead of ham.  I also used two cans of ro-tel tomatoes with green chiles instead of chopping fresh tomatoes.  I did not have fresh parsley, so I used about half the amount of dried.  Finally, I added half a teaspoon of dried savory.  And like a previous reviewer, I cooked the vegetables in with the roux, and because I used frozen okra I added it last.  The gumbo is very good.  Thanks for submitting it!

This recipe was very good.  I added a jalapeno to the onions and celery and okra to saute and used Rotel diced tomatoes with chilis.  It gave it just the right kick.  I also served this with white rice and corn bread.  Great meal for a cold night!

Only change I made was to substitute chopped green bell pepper for the okra, since bell pp are normally put into gumbo and my family has mixed opinions on okra.  This was fabulous for New Year's Day.  It tasted really good, and was not that time-consuming.  Don't let making the roux intimidate you.  As long as you keep the heat at medium and whisk or stir the whole time, you won't burn it before it turns that pretty roux color somewhere between peanut butter and chocolate.  I made 6 cups of white rice to accompany this (4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups white rice, simmered for 20 minutes), and it was the perfect amount.  Highly recommend.

I love the flavor of the gumbo....but I don't care for the thickness. When I make it again, I will cut the amount of oil significantly and all of the flour. I will add rice to the broth and keep it a thin soup. I used canned tomatoes (28 oz) and frozen okra. I repeat-- I love the flavor.

I'm sorry to say that this dish isn't to my families taste. The Okra was very fibrous and spoilt it, I really picked them over too, it looked as if I was getting nice young ones, but obviously they weren't. Sorry Paula!

Easy to make and full of flavor! I used can vegs and add it with the juice to omit the water. Minus the bay leaf added more garlic and onion powder.

This gumbo is extremely easy and tasty!  People always say gumbo is so difficult/time consuming to make because you need special things like file powder, bacon drippings, or 50 ingredients; not this recipe!  Thank you for sharing Paula!!

All the ingredients were extremely easy to get in my small local grocery.  I took some liberties and added shrimp and andouille sausage and substituted black-eyed peas with kidney beans - still just as tasty.

I would change the amount of salt too.  It was a bit too salty for my taste and I would add more okra...but that's just me because I love okra. =]

This recipe makes a good sized pot.  I would only say this serves around 6-8 people though.

Excellent!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe that will definitely be our new tradition for ringing in the new year.  I couldn't find okra so I used sugar snap peas and halved them.  When it came time to add the meat, I split the soup into two pots, added the meat to one (kielbasa) and kept the other vegetarian for my daughter.  I added some cooked rice to both.  Very hearty and delicious.

I tripled the spices (we like a lot of flavor in our food), omitted the celery (husband does not like it), used 16oz of chopped Hillshire Farm Lil' Smokies instead of ham, and used canned tomatoes and frozen okra.  I also added 1.5 cups of cooked white rice when I mixed in the black-eyed peas since I had leftovers in the fridge.  Yummy!

Easy to make and satisfying and tummy warming on a cold day.  Very healthy for weight watchers.  Made a lot, had plenty for leftovers for a couple of days.  Will make again.

This was a rich and hearty dish. My changes were a 16 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the chopped tomatoes; I added shrimp, sliced carrots and used zuchinni squash instead of okra. I added a 1/4 tsp of creole seasoning. Served over rice...Delicious!

This was good. I made sure I baked the okra in a 450 degree oven for 45 minutes. This keeps it from being slimy once adding it to the gumbo.

This was delicious, and surprisingly, my kids LOVED it.  I belong to a CSA, so I was able to use farm fresh black-eyed peas and okra, and substituted a small bit of bacon for the ham.

I have been making this for New Years (tomorrow will be year #3)and everyone loves it. I do use good spicey andouille sausage instead of ham and fresh black-eyed peas. My roux is probably much darker than it calls for but I like real yummy dark cajun gumbo and don't mind spending a little extra time.

Made this yesterday, it is very good. It was even better today at lunch. I did add additional cayenne pepper, and black pepper. For the ham I used a Farmer John 6 oz. ham steak. My husband wants to know if I'll make it again next week!

This really wasn't much like a gumbo and was not too flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly, too. Perhaps sausage instead of ham would make it more complex and flavorful. More spices are needed as well.

This recipe is DE-LISH! I added shrimp and rice and left out the okra (couldn't find any... don't be surprised, I'm in the UK). Was quick and easy to make and is super filling! Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious and just what I needed for New Years Day, a way to use up leftover ham (the old fashioned kind of bone-in ham) and a way to get black-eyed peas for the holiday.  After it's done let it simmer covered real low for the tastes to blend.  I had to use frozen sliced okra, the only thing available, and it turned out great!  Only thing I added extra was a tsp. of chicken granules. Thank you, Paula from Susie

Wow! This was such a great gumbo!! Whole family loved it, made my house smell delicious and filled my belly in a very pleasant way.  I did use a couple extra cloves of garlic, minced my onion very very fine and used a whole large onion...plus, I used ham AND a 16oz bag of shrimp. I also kicked up the spice a bit with more cayenne than the recipe called for.  With some brown rice and corn bread muffins..this was a meal worth waiting for....I would cook this again soon and everyone in my house would be glad for it, too! Awesome job Paula!

This was a fabulous first experience with making Gumbo, and even tasting Gumbo for me. I would give it a 5 star but the prep time indicated is much less than it actually took me to prepare it. The recipe itself is top notch, and the flavors can't be beat.  There's room to add extra seasonings if desired!

This was fantastic!! My hubbie thinks he doesn't like okra, but this recipe was great. The veggies weren't too mushy and I used kielbasa instead of ham...will make again

Doesn't need the black eyed peas as it is very think and rich without them. I used bacon instead of ham. Served over brown rice, this was a very good supper and my husband requested the leftovers for lunch today. I will make this again.

This was really yummy and easy to make. I gave this recipe 4/5 stars because it was not as thick as I thought it would be. Perhaps I will like it better tomorrow when I will try it with rice. I followed the advise from other reviewers and substituted okra  with a green pepper. Also I forgot to mention that I doubled everything to be able to serve more. I also used canned dice tomatoes with chilis to give it a little bit more kick. I used minced garlic in place of cloves. I also used smoked sausage and shrimp...... this will definitely be my "new" New Years meal...... I can't wait to try this tomorrow since others have said that its so much better the next day. Delicious!

This is a hearty soup, yet I do not feel guilty for having a second bowl. We've been enjoying this for the past couple days. I basically threw everything in the crock pot and let people eat as they please. Next time I'll try sausage (as others mentioned) rather than ham because the flavor is a little quiet. I do, however, love the pairing of okra and blackeye peas, it's a nice change for me. And I must admit the addition of a 1/2 head of green cabbage. I can't help but to add cabbage whenever I'm preparing soups for my family. It's serves us right and so does this recipe. Thanks for letting me share.

This is our new favorite recipe. The first time I made it I used andouille sausage rather than ham. I sliced and browned the sausage separately before adding it to the gumbo pot. We like our sausage with a little bit of crispy exterior. I had used my cast iron frying pan to brown the onions, celery and garlic first then transferred it to the gumbo pot. Browned the sausage in the same pan next. The first time I added extra black-eyed peas too. The frozen okra I waited to add until about 15 minutes before serving. If you add the okra in too soon it cooks down to nothing. The second time I made this I cut back a tad on the sausage so I could add chicken too. Next time I plan on trying some shrimp.  Also the second time I made this I added extra chicken broth for a total of 3 cans and extra black-eyed peas for a total of 4 cans. In our house we serve 4 adults so we adjust recipes accordingly. This is really an outstanding recipe I recommend adding different proteins for variety.  That's why they call it gumbo.  A little bit of this a little bit of that.

I have ALWAYS wanted to make gumbo but wasn’t impressed at how long I thought it would take. I doubled the recipe and substituted smoked sausage for ham and added shrimp at the very end. I also used unthawed okra (Wal-Mart ran out of the fresh okra). I just let it sit out until I prepared the dish/it I thawed quickly.!To make the roux, I took another reviewer’s suggestion and added 1/2 cup oil and 2/3 cups of flour (be sure to times that by 2 if doubling!!) to pan & cook until golden brown. I also added 6 beef bouillon cubes & more seasoning (seasoned salt, pepper, garlic and some cayenne pepper) once the vegetables and roux were combined otherwise the dish would have been bland and we like well seasoned food. I also added a seasoning called “Slap Ya Mama Seasoning” and added it to the vegetable and onion sauté & shrimp (which I sautéed separately in butter). After I added the black eyes peas and smoked sausage, an additional 2 cups of water is needed, otherwise it will taste kind of like flour. This dish was perfect and my family and guests raved about it! I will make this dish again and again. Thank you for the submittal!

Wonderful!!  Added shrimp to the mix when I added the ham.  Was very pleased with the shrimp addition.   It made 8 bowls by itself.  Did not add rice although I'm sure would be really good.  I'm on a diet and didn't need the extra calories from the rice.

Used Andouille sausage and cooked chicken instead of ham.  Left out the cayenne pepper.  It turned out flavorful and not spicy, which is what I was going for.  Absolutely delicious!

I made this for New Year's Day for our customary southern tradition to eat black-eyed peas. It was a hit! But, as usual for me, I changed a few things. Substitutions included: 
7 drops of Tabasco Sauce for the cayenne pepper
2 cans of chunky RoTel for the tomatoes
Chicken sausage and shredded chicken (1 c of chicken and 2 chicken sausages sliced)  for the ham

"Wow!" was my husband's reaction to this gumbo and I have to agree. This was our New Year's Day, black-eyed peas lucky meal. Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe with one alteration in the process, I sautéed the vegetables in the oil and then made the roux with the sautéed veggies. From there it was exactly like the recipe. We will be making this often, not just for New Year's Day.

Very tasty! I will definitely be making it again. Even my somewhat picky husband liked it. 

I did make some modifications. I used bell pepper in place of the okra and Trader Joe's Smoked Andouille Chicken Sausage instead of the ham. I made black eyed peas from scratch and cut fresh tomatoes and I think the salt level was perfect this way; if using canned ingredients, putting in less salt is probably a good idea. I was going to serve this with rice and cornbread, but got lazy and ended up serving it with rice and crackers. :)

My only problem was that the yield seemed off. I cut the recipe in half expecting to get six servings, but it just didn't look like anywhere near enough liquid and I ended up adding another 1.5 c. water.

I used leftover Christmas ham to make this on New Year's Day and it's been requested every week since. I do make my black eyed peas fresh not canned to avoid the mushy quality of canned.

Wonderful flavors and a great dish for leftovers and New Years.  I only substituted my cajun smoked turkey stock for the water. I do add my veggies to the roux and cook instead of separately.  Great recipe.  Thank you!

Very good!  I sauted my veggies then added the rue.  I used ground turkey meatballs and turkey hardwood smoked sausage instead of the ham and it came out sooo good!  I also sauted my veggies with a small scotch bonnet pepper and I used the fire roasted canned tomatoes to give it an extra kick.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  This will be added to my collection.  I can't wait to cook it again and share it with friends and family!

This was my first attempt at Cajun style food. Awesome soup. I followed the recipe exact except that I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  We LOVED it...next time I will double the recipe and freeze a batch for lunches. Can't wait to try some others on this site.

Made this on New Years Day - had to get in my Black-Eyed peas -  and it was DELICIOUS!  I used chicken stock for 3 of the 4 cups of water but otherwise followed the recipe.  This will become our New Year Lucky Gumbo from now on.  Thanks for sharing.

First I made the rue as suggested with oil, but it burned long before the recommended 5 to 7 minutes and never thickened up.  I dumped it out and tried again using unsalted butter and flour. I cooked it  only about three to four minutes.  Success! I also added the ham with the tomatoes and water, to shorten up the cooking time. Delicious!

This was really good. I did use frozen Okra but pretty much followed recipe to the T. Was a great way to get our New Years Black eyed peas in!
