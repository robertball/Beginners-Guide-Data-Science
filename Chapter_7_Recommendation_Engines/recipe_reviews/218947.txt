I made a few changes:
excluded the onion, substituted kidney beans for red bean, substituted cumin for turmeric, added cheddar cheese

The rice and yogurt mixture was a little bland. If I make this again I'll definitely use the onion and probably add a little more spice. I think the cheese was a necessary addition though. 

Overall, I think this is a good solid, healthy vegetarian meal.

Made this dish when I had some friends over.  Since several people noted that it was rather bland I kicked up the spices, adding turmeric and paprika along with 1/2 a head of garlic.  This seemed to give it a bit more pep, however I think I would season it even more a 2nd time around.  
Also, the left-overs heated up extremely well.

I really liked it. I thought the flavor of the vegetables really came out and I loved the dense yet fluffy texture of the rice. The flavor wasn't strong, so next time I might try to add a bit more spice, or some cheese as another rater suggested.

Takes a little while to do the prep and to cook, but WELL worth it. The texture of everything combined is absolutely perfect! To give it a little extra flavor I did 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, a dash more of the turmeric, 3/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon extra of the minced garlic. By doing that, I think it brought out more flavor without having to go overboard in anything. It was excellent. Super delicious and healthy vegetarian dish that's rich in flavor.

Excellent! Used regular brown rice. Substituted sour cream instead of yogurt. Added more spices-more turmeric, chili powder and cumin. Topped with cheese. Overall a delicious vegetarian recipe.

I have heart issues, so this recipe with low fat and low salt is just right for me. I will add more spices as other reviews suggested.

I really liked this recipe! I did make just a couple changes. I added mushrooms and used rice pilaf instead of Uncle Ben's. I also wish I had kept the skins on the eggplant for better presentation. But oh well.
