THIS IS AN EXCELLENT GRILL SAUCE. TRY IT ON CHICKEN OR SHRIMP,TOO. I KEEP A JAR MIXED UP IN THE FRIG SO I CAN PUT A GRILLED MEAL ON THE TABLE IN SHORT ORDER. JUST BE CAREFUL, IT BURNS QUICKLY. WATCH IT LIKE A HAWK.

My family usually only wants regular ol' bbq sauce on ribs, but they LOVED this recipe!! I varied it a bit: I boiled boneless ribs then threw them in the crockpot (sprayed w/Pam first), made the glaze then spread it over the ribs & cooked it on high for about 4 hours. Added bonus--the house smelled wonderful!

I loved this recipe!  I used short ribs and broiled them.  They fell off the bone.  I'm using this sauce on a pork loin tonight. Wouldn't change a thing.

The sauce is fantastic.  Loving sauce, I cut back on the meat and doubled the sauce portion of the recipe.  Slurp!!

The pork turned out very dry and you could not really taste the glaze on the pork after it was grilled.  I will use a different recipe for spareribs in the future.

These ribs were fairly good.  Next time, I will save some of the sauce to dip the ribs in while eating.

Came out perfectly good. I followed the recipe for apricot glaze and I kept licking the sauce and realized I need to leave some for the ribs lol.  I let my ribs cook in the oven for about an hour and half, cut off the fat and the meat like spare ribs and added the glaze.  Great recipe...Thank you, my husband and I really enjoyed.
