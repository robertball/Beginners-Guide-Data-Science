I give it one star because my family ate it, but otherwise it was a disaster! The poor little veggies had practically burned away to nothing while the chicken was still half raw in the middle. It took some quick thinking to even keep them at an edible level.

I think you have to cook the chicken first then shred it as the vegetables saut√©.  This needs seasonings such as cumin, garlic, chili powder, etc.

This recipe was very easy and fast.  My kids loved it.  We served it in flour tortillas with mushrooms, cheese, and tomatoes.  I used some legs and thighs instead of breasts, it is much cheaper.  I just boiled and shredded the chicken with a fork.  It turned out great!

This recipe left like it is gets a low rating, because bland.  I used leftover chicken I had from the baked crockpot chicken, I shredded, added fresh chopped cilantro, 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. chili powder, fresh garlic, added just enough broth to simmer, chopped onion, green pepper and roma tomatoe.    Then filled wheat tortilla with mixture added cheese to melt.  Pretty healthy taco.

I agree this filling could use some more flavoring and I used a hand blender/food processor to really mince the chicken but it was darn good, I'll probably add many more spices next run through.

This recipe, as written, both ingredients and directions, is a 1.5 to 2 stars, at best. I read it, read it again, and made a Scooby Doo "baroooo??" noise. I equated this recipe to somebody telling me to make a tuna fish sandwich by opening the can of tuna, mixing it w/ just mayo, and slapping it b/t bread. Sure, it's a starting point, but the only way to take this recipe from yawn to yum is by tweaking it a bit. That being said, I did the chicken FIRST, then added the onions and peppers, and began jabbing at the chicken w/ my spatula to break it into smaller and smaller pieces. I then added 3 TB of "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from here, along w/ 3/4 c. H20, boiled, then simmered until the liquid was absorbed. Served them w/ green onion, cilantro, tomatoes, and salsa, and then the recipe was scrumptious. I hate to leave a bad review, but the recipe just needs to major spicin' up.

This recipe is a starter.  You must add seasoning and spices to make it a "taco", otherwise it just cooked chicken and veggies. Definitely needs taco seasoning, or cumin, garlic, paprika and some chili powder.

I liked that the "basics" where there and it was easy but it needed Zing!!! I added in medium salsa, Banana Peppers and that gave it a lift that I was thinking of when I hear the word "taco"

It wasn't awful, but I needed to add seasonings to make the tacos flavorful.  This is an OK base but not a complete recipe.

This is really yummy. I added a little yellow bell pepper too and some natural salt and little bit of some other seasonings along with adding a little chicken broth to make a light sauce! YUMMO!

Easy, great as is, satisfied varying taste buds and dietary limitations, fun laying out spices and other tasty stuff to add to.
