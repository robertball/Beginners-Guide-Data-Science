I loved how easy this was. I made it for my husbands birthday cake and it was awesome! I left out the rum and added vanilla and I think maybe cutting down on the milk maybe to 3/4 cup or maybe 1/2 cup. I would like it a little thicker. But overall it was real tasty!

I used this recipe to top my son's cupcakes for his second birthday. I cut the milk in half as suggested and left out the rum using about 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead. I also refrigerated the frosting until right before serving so it would remain thick enough not to slide off the cupcakes. My husband loved the frosting as did my son.

Tastes like banana cream pie!! I was so glad to have found this recipe since all other frosting/icing recipes called for confectioners sugar which I didn't have at the time. I used it on the Banana Cake II recipe to which I added chocolate chips and it was wonderful! Tips: I used rum extract instead of straight rum. A large wisk makes "folding in" very easy. Quick and easy to make. Thanks Cyndi!

I used others people's suggestions and cut back on the amount of milk and the frosting came out perfect!!!! It's light and airy and full of banana flavor. I am using this frosting on my banana cake recipe I can not wait to try it on my cake.(I always make my cakes the day before and let the ingredients settle before adding my filling) This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you so much for sharing such an easy great tasting recipe. My only regret is that I can not give it more stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's got a nice mild banana flavor. Not authentic banana since most of its flavor comes from the pudding mix but it's nice nonetheless. Reducing the milk by half it still wasn't quite as thick as most people would want. Combine the liquid ingredients (milk/rum) last and add as much as you need to get the consistency you need.

A good choice if you're looking for a whipped cream-based frosting with a banana undertone. I was surprised how subtle the banana was conidering the banana pudding and mashed fresh banana in the recipe. The frozen whipped topping really cut the banana flavor which I personally liked.

Well it tasted great but much to runny. I dont have a food processor I used a hand mixer and still couldn't get it thick. I think like the other lady the milk should be cut down to 1/2 cup.I have another recipe that calls for a 12 oz tub of cool whip with only 1/2 cup milk and 3 oz cream chease and 1 pudding mix. So how does this one get a full cup of milk? I'll keep working on it because it did taste good. Kept it in the fridge overnight so it wouldn't run. and it was ok then.

This is a great little recipe if you want a quick simple frosting/filling. I added sliced bananas to the middle of a devil's food chocolate cake along with this filling turned out great. It doesn't make the prettiest cake just the tastiest!

This was very easy and turned out better than I expected. I was using this to frost cupcakes and was worried about it being too runny. I made this about 8 hours before frosting the cupcakes and I let it sit in the fridge to thicken. I didn't have any rum so I used a little rum extract instead. It turned out to be a creamy frosting with lots of banana flavor and it didn't run off my cupcakes.

I reduced the amount of milk to 1/2 cup like other reviewers suggested. It still came out a little more runny than I preferred but my guests loved it. I baked two 8-inch round devil's food cakes. Rather than frosting it completelt I "sandwiched" the filling between the two layers added a dollop on top and drizzled it with a little chocolate sauce. (I left the sides unfrosted.) It turned out very pretty.

I used this recipe as a cake filling and it came out great! I added butterscotch to give it even more flavor! I mixed together 1/2 of a 3.4 oz banana cream pudding mix package 1 whole banana 1/4 cup whole milk 1 tsp vanilla extract and about 15 butterscotch morsels (melted) and 4oz cool whip. I whipped everything together and used it to fill a 9 inch square yellow cake with plain butter cream frosting. DELISH!

I love this recipe! I needed something quick and easy for a picky husband and found this. I substituted regular rum with Cap't Morgans Spiced Rum (because it was only one I had) but it tastes sooo good!. I used it as a topping for banana cupcakes then garnished with star fruit strawberries and kiwi.

Wonderful frosting! I only added 1/2 cup milk and used a tsp of vanilla instead of the rum. I have been looking for a frosting for banana cake that doesn't start with icing sugar....and this fits the bill. This is so nice and creamy. Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe and it was very tasty but a little runny. I read the prior reviews and thought I could stabilize with cream of tartar however that didn't work. Next time I'll cut down on the milk and use the cream of tartar...I'll let everyone know my results!

I was looking for a really easy frosting recipe for my students to make in a ziploc bag so they could decorate cupcakes. I left out the rum and used about a tsp. of vanilla and reduced the milk to 2/3 cup. It was perfect! The kids (2 and 3 year olds) were easily able to mix it in a bag and it tasted great! Not too sugary...very light and fluffy. Will make again and again! Will try different flavors of pudding too.

This was the BEST banana frosting we have had so far! Wonderful banana flavor! The only problem I had was that it was too thin - I may have measured wrong somewhere but will defiantly make again! Thank You!

This my favorite frosting to make mostly based on how easy it is. I use it whenever possible and people love it! For anyone feeling adventurous Cool Whip has seasonal flavors like French Vanilla. I just used it in a recent batch and it tastes even better!

I love this frosting I use it as a filling. I add an extra banana and cut back on the milk I add 3/4 cup and I skip the rum. I've received many compliments on this recipe including from my daughter who said " you make the best banana frosting."

I followed other recommendations and used vanilla instead of rum and only 1/2 cup milk. It was awesome on the Banana Cake also featured on allrecipes.com. I'll be making this one again!

It is just okay - not nasty or anything but taste just too much like cool whip and fake banana flavor from the pudding - I thought adding the fresh banana would give it a fresh taste but it still has that fake banana taste to it. This makes the cake taste more like a dessert rather than a cake.

The taste was good but I could not get it to thicken either. I used a blender on "stir" to thicken and also deleted the rum reduced the milk to 1/2 C. AND refrigerated it overnight before frosting(banana cake II - which was excellent!) Still was runny.

I followed the directions except to add less milk (1/2 c) as many people have recommended. It ended up being a nice thick frosting but I did not like the flavor nor did my friends. They said the rum didn't go well with it and it didn't taste banana-y enough. I'm not sure if I would try it again.

I would not recommend this for cupcakes. If you want to use on cupcakes throttle back on the liquid. For a sheet cake it s easy and tasty.

Yummy just use less milk or it's too runny. 1/2-3/4 cup of milk worked.
