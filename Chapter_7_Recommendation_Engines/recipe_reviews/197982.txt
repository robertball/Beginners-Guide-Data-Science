I did not have Cinnamon OR Chocolate Chex but I did have Rice Chex, so I used that. I used my air popper to pop the popcorn instead of microwave popcorn or packaged. End verdict? My kids and husband flipped for this. Serves 16? Nope. My boys had it all gone before our movie was even half over. I think had I used the pre-sweetened cereal, it might have been too sweet. I'd like to try this next time with homemade pumpkin pie spice.

We really liked this mix.  I did not have Cinnamon Chex cereal, so used Rice Chex instead and added extra cinnamon.  Very yummy!!

Perhaps as gluten free folks, we always check the ingredients.  

Unless your Chex say Gluten Free, they aren't. Barley malt has gluten in it. There is still a lot of regular rice, corn, etc.. Chex on the shelves that isn't gluten free.  Perhaps common sense, but if you're making this for someone else or are new to the gluten free world, it could be vital!

This is so yummy! I didn't have Cinnamon Chex or Chocolate Chex, so I doubled the cinnamon in the recipe and used two cups each of Rice and Corn Chex. After it was cool I added about a half cup of mini chocolate chips.  I can't wait for my son to get home from school and have this snack waiting for him, I know he will love it.

I was kind of disappointed with this. I couldn't find chocolate chex so i used all cinnamon, so maybe that's what was missing in my final result. I just found it kind of bland, despite all the cinnamon. it really needed another element. Also, the popcorn gets sort of stale and chewy. It was ok.

Perfect for a party snack.  My first batch burnt a little on the bottom because I didn't stir it enough between microwaving.  Still, everyone asked for the recipe!

yummmmmm.  I dislike it when someone reviews a recipe after making a ton of changes...and yet here I am doing the same thing.  No chocolate or cinnamon chex to be found - i used rice/corn chex - I used 1/4 cup of a cinnamon sugar mix and 1/4 cup of smart balance and added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips.  Next time I'll use WAY less butter and less sugar and leave out the chocolate chips.

I thought it was good, but not over-the-top good.  The popcorn does get a little soft, and I'm not a big fan of soft popcorn, though.

This was very good, and my gluten free friend called it crack and took the leftovers home :)  My microwave is broke, so instead I baked it in the oven @ 350 for about 30 min, stirring after 15 min.  Had I not previously made the cinnamon-sugar popcorn (from this site) which is A. MAZE. ING.  I probably would have rated this a 5 star recipe.
