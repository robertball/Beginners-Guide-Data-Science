This is an old family recipe that we've been serving for over 100 years.  Although you can use mayo, the "old time" version requires you to make a 1/2 mayo 1/2 cream cheese mixture.  I know it sounds quite odd, but it is soooo yummy!  We serve it on a large lettuce leaf.  The colors are amazing and it makes a nice presentation.

I've eaten this all my life so it seems normal to me, but I guess I can understand how some people might find it odd.  Those people need to be braver.  This is fantastic:  the sweet pears, the rich mayo, the sharp cheese . . . unreal!  Serve it with a little of the pear syrup poured over the top; the syrup combines with the mayo into pure deliciousness.

My Ex-Mother-in-law made this. She was from North Carolina, and apparently it was an old family recipe. I think you had to be exposed to this stuff at a young age to like it. I always thought it was gross. I would scrape off the mayo, and eat the pear.

I grew up on this recipe, as did my Mom and her Mom.  People look at me like I am crazy when they see me eating it but it is sooo good.  Reminds me of my childhood.

Great little fruit side salad. I remember now that this used to be really popular in the 60's-70's. It's as good now as it was then. I don't like mayo so I cut it with half cream cheese in a compromise. I didn't have cherries since we'd used them for sundaes and I'd completely forgotten, so I used some cinnamon candies instead for the top. My mom always used canned pears but I used fresh and this was so much better! Thanks for a great way to fix pears. This is good.

I grew up eating Pear Salad too!!! We still have them at our family reunion every year and for special occasions. It does sound strange but don't knock it til you try it. I think you really do have to grow up eating it to really appreciate it. I don't even like pears - this is the only way I will eat them.  So simple and so delicious!!!

This was fabulous. My mother used to make these. There is just something wonderful about the taste of all the ingredients mixed together. Perfect. And don't do like the one rater said and scrap off the cheese and mayo and just eat the pear. She said it "sounded" gross. Obviously she didnt even taste it. Thanks for reminding me of this simple yet delicious dish.

I was going to submit this too!  This may sound disgusting, but it will surprise you how good it is! In my family, it goes back to at least my great-grandmother.  I'm going to try it sometime with the Cream Cheese!

I'm surprised that so many, even those who grew up with pear salad, find the combo odd or weird. Doesn't anyone eat fresh Bartlett pears with cheddar cheese? For a snack or light lunch or dessert? I like pears and cheese even better than apples and cheese!

I didn't like it very much. There were too many mismatched flavors in my opinion, but they weren't that bad. Maybe with the cream cheese suggestion or less mayonnaise they would have been better. Interesting flavor though.

I've always made this but never put the marichino cherries.  Just the pears, mayo and cheddar cheese.  Yummmm.. such odd ingredients but the flavors are fantastic.

I too grew up eating this, but with Miracle Whip/Salad Dressing instead of Mayo. Also the alternative with cottage cheese, MW, and paprika. All great!

I have been eating and making these for years and years.  We always used food coloring to add a bit of flair to the presentation.  Especially at Easter.  The colors are amazing against the lettuce. Just use food coloring and water.  Or just food coloring for a brighter color.  Dip just like eggs.  DO NOT USE Vinegar like you do with the eggs.

This is such a wonderfully easy salad to make. I like the suggestions of the cherries and of mixing 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 mayo. I had always made it with just the mayo and sharp chedder cheese. I'll be trying the cream cheese mix next time.

One of my favorite quick and easy snacks -- the tang of cheddar cheese and the sweetness of the pear are a perfect combination.

My hubby's mom used to make this for him & he had me try it a lonnnng time ago. It's pretty good! I haven't ever tried it w/ cream cheese but I will next time.
