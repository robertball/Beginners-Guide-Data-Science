I've made this twice now - the first time as per the recipe and it was nice (would have been 3-4 stars). The second time I poured a half cup of white wine over the potato, onion and apple layers and sprinkled with a tsp of dried thyme - and I also added a tablespoon of caraway seeds to the sauerkraut.  I then cooked it long and slow in my oven and it was great.

This was incredibly delicious!  It was my first attempt at pork chops, but the recipe was so simple that it came out fantastic!  I added a bit more brown sugar to mine (about twice the recipe calls for, and added an extra sweet potatoe, because two didn't seem enough. I think next time I will use apples with a more tart taste.  Definately on my top ten list of recipes I will be making again!!

The ingredients listed didn't sound to me like they would taste good all together in one dish, but this was delicious!  I added a little cinnamon with the nutmeg, and sprinkled some onion powder on the pork chops after I browned them in butter, then poured a little white wine over the whole thing before cooking it.  The meat was super tender and the vegetables/apples had a wonderful mellow comfort-food flavor.

I made this for New Year's Day 2011!  It was fabulous.  I did a few things a little different. I didn't have time for the crock pot so I used my cast iron dutch oven. I used a little more brown sugar and added 2 cloves of garlic.  Sprinkled sage on the pork chops, added caraway seeds and about another tbsp brown sugar to the sauerkraut after rinsing and squeezing it to get the sour juice out,,,and then put about 3 tbsp thinly sliced butter pats on top of the sauerkraut and then poured about 1/4 cup Reisling wine.  Cooked at 250 degrees for 3 hours and it was fantastic.  The pork chops were super tender, the flavors of everything else were super complimentary.  I am going to make this a New Year Tradition!

I ended up adding one cup of chicken broth to this about three hours into cooking. I was a bit concerned that the potatoes were not getting cooked through because of a lack of liquid. After five hours, and the extra broth, the potatoes were indeed done, and the dish was tasty. Great combination!

I added extra sugar because my husband doesn't like the sourness of sauerkraut. The apples cooked up a little more than we liked but I will just slice them thicker next time.  The taste was very good and my husband even liked the sauerkraut.

This was a very flavorful dish, sweet and sour combined. The apples, sweet potatoes and sauerkraut joined together in taste which made it difficult to separate each without looking. But outside of that, very good. The pork was super tender and tasty. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Something different and the tastes of the sweet pototoes, onions and apples with a hint of sweet with the saurkraut is wonderful.

This was a nice change from my regular potato/kraut recipe.  I added an extra sweet potato and apple, added cinnamon and a little more nutmeg and put in 1/4 cup brown sugar rather than 1T.  Also, if you don't like tart sauerkraut, rinse it off in a collander before putting it in the recipe.  I also added 1 1/2 cups apple juice before cooking this because I wanted more moisture. This recipe is a keeper!!!

Wonderful, tender, quick meal. The apples added the perfect compliment to the Sauerkraut. This is almost a once a weeker. Thank you.

Five stars with some of the changes suggested by other users.  I added 1/2 c. white cooking wine so it wouldn't dry out.  Used 4 sweet potatoes (not yams) and did not peel as their skins are lighter.  Used 4 med tart apples.  I mixed 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp sea salt in a separate bowl and coated the apples before tossing them in.  I mixed 1/2 the amount of the saurkraut called for w/1 tsp caraway seed.  It was fabulous!  I'm keeping this recipe on hand all Fall.

This was exceptionally delicious!  I tend to prefer white sweet potatoes and never can find a good way to serve the orange ones -- this really made them shine.  I used homemade kraut, local apples and onions, heritage pork from a nearby farmer and orange sweets from the Farmers' Market.  Totally local, totally simple, totally superb.  It's a keeper.

Hmm. I really wanted to like this recipe, we love all the ingredients but it was bland, just too bland, and in 6 hrs the pots were not cooked and neither were the onions. I had to finish them on the stove. I DO, however, plan to make this again because my DH and son loved it, go figure! I plan to change it a lot. I plan to add chopped bacon to the pot, prob 3 slices, to saute the onions before putting them in and to use apple cider to deglaze the pan (I did that this time too). Also, much more salt and I will add a TB of prepared mustard  and maybe some celery seed. I think it will be great with these changes.

Great recipe! Would definitely make it again. I used boned center cut pork chops, but I cut the bones out before placing them into the crock pot. They were much thinner than the typical bonless pork chop, so I did not brown them first because I thought they would come out too dry. Glad I just threw them in the crock pot, because they came out very tender.

I didn't think this was good enough to make again.  It was pretty bland, even with the addition of white wine.  All the flavors blended together and nothing stood out or impressed.

This was just fine. It was somewhat good, but I probably wouldn't make it again. I added extra seasonings, like sage and mustard powder, and also added about half a bottle of beer to the crock pot. And it was just okay! I did have to cook mine longer than 5 hours - actually, I went 7 hours and turned it on high for one hour, just to make sure the sweet potatoes were done. Thanks for the recipe...

The perfect mix of sweet and sour.  I love sauerkraut and this dish was amazing.  I did not brown the pork chops because I'm lazy :)  Still turned out very very good!

If you like dry pork chops and food with no flavor then this is the recipe for you.  Okay...it's not really *that* bad, but I wouldn't say it's that great either.  I used allspice instead of nutmeg and added some cayenne pepper as well but it didn't help much.  I would definitely say seasoning the pork more before the initial browning would help a lot.  In the end, it is a very easy slow cooker recipe but nothing spectacular.

What a fabulous recipe!  Was wondering how the sauerkraut would be with the apples, but it was great.  The sweetness of the apples minimized the tartness of the sauerkraut.  Even my husband who SAYS he isn't picky (but he is) loved it!

Yes! Baked kraut is very mellow in the end. I like pork steak better than chops, but a roasting cut of pork, like a shoulder, is sublime. This same recipe works well with country-style ribs, too. When I was a kid, I worked in a German restaurant for a while, and they lightly rinsed their kraut then put a healthy squeeze of lemon over it along with the brown sugar.

I did like this dish and I will make it again.  The pork chop came out perfectly cooked and not dry.  I baked in oven for 2 hours at 300 in my Lodge cast iron dutch oven, but I microwaved potato slices first 4min. since I was not sure of doneness and I browned my chops.

A real crowd pleaser! Just killer! I nuked the potatoes 4 minutes first, then baked in a foiled baking pan for an hour instead of the cooker. The sauerkraut was mellowed by the covered baking, and the chops were perfect. The potatoes disappeared into a lovely sweet-sour flavor. (We didn't peel the thin skins, and they were unnoticeable.)

I loved this dish!  Sadly my 7 yr old did not.  I think the sauerkraut is what turned him off; but, I thought it made for a wonderful, hearty dish.

Beware of trying to put the whole recipe into a 3 qt. crock! Also, beware of trying to cook it on low for 5 hours, it won't be done. At least, that was my experience.

The taste was great, the apples and potatoes turned out wonderfully but the pork chops turned out really dry.  I got to thinking after the matter that maybe they turned out dry because I opened the crock-pot to check the potatoes, thought maybe I let out all the moisture and that's why they ended up dry.  I may attempt to make again and leave lid alone but no guarantees that hubby will want to eat it again after the first attempt.

I love each ingredient seperately, but all cooked together it just came out oddly flavored.  The first night (5 hrs on low) the sweet potatoes were not cooked at all.  The second night (5 more hours on low), after adding more kraut & juice & apple juice they were still hard as a rock. We ate the chops, tossed everything else.  Sorry. I thought this would be great.

instead of apples, I used apple sauce and poured it over the sauerkraut.  then i sprinkled about 1/4 cup sugar over it and baked in a 9 X 14 @350 for about 1 hr. Excellent!

I'm sorry but this just wasn't for us. I added 5 times the brown sugar called for and it still had a vinegary taste. 2 stars because the potatoes came out pretty good.

Browned pork in a cast iron pot, removed, added other ingredients, covered and baked in oven for 60 minutes at 400 degrees.  That was too high a temp/too long of a cooking time; chops were a little dry.  Added wine as another reviewer did; still not enough 'juice' for us.  We loved it:  Very tasty.  My fiance' kept saying, "This is good."  Next time I will add more fresh sauerkraut & apples (which cooked down quite a bit; he dislikes apples but loved the flavour they added).  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe twice and it's fantastic. Flavours meld beautifully. I put the onion into the frying pan after the pork chops were out and used about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to deglaze the pan and poured that over the lower layers before putting in the chops and sauerkraut. The flavour only gets better as leftovers. I've shared this recipe with friends. Love it.

I rate this recipe a 4 star (only because our preferance would be to use white potatoes instead and save the sweet potaoes for a ham dish) ... followed the recipe taking the advice of a few previous reviewers adding 1/2c white wine at the end of the preparation over the top of the kraut and cookig on HI for 4hrs. very YUM! very tender chops and very flavorful!!!! Will make this again! esp. on a cool or snow FALL or WINTER day!!!

i personally thought this recipe was wonderful, but my family had mixed reviews. i used three sweet potatoes, three apples and one and a half onions and it still turned out okay.  i think i could've used a little less sauerkraut (i used a large can) and maybe seasoned the chops with salt and pepper.  i used white wine for the extra liquid and i think next time i make this i will use half wine half water to make the taste a little more mild.  other than these minor changes this recipe is good if you're looking for something different.

I was looking for an easy slow cooker recipe and love to try new things - this looked interesting. I have never cooked raw sweet potatoes before and this recipe was awesome! My husband I both loved it and will definitely make it again. I also poured a cup of white wine over the top. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this according to the recipe, except I added a little cinnamon per previous reviewer.  The pork chops were good and very tender.  The sweet potatoes were OK.  The apples cooked to mush.  Overall it was just weird to me.  I like all the ingredients but they did not work together.  My husband was not a fan either.  I will not make this one again.

A good recipe if you like sauerkraut.  The pork was very tender and tasted good after 5.5 hr on low.  I used 4 boneless butterfly loin chops weighing about 2lb.  I also used Granny Smith apples and cut them 1/2 inch thick, and were pretty well intact at the end of things.  I found the sweet potatoes to be too mushy for my taste, though.  This may have been because I added ~1 cup of white wine 3 hours in, as suggested by a previous review.  I liked the taste though, and next time will cut the sweet potatoes a bit thicker.  Overall, very satisfying.

I wasn't crazy about this dish.  The potatoes needed more time to cook as they were not completely done.  I would definitely not add the sauercraut next time as it took away from the taste of the potatoes and apples.

Very tasty, even without the nutmeg. I added a quarter cup of water and a tsp. of butter, so I would not risk it being dry. I also added diced carrots. Yum! 

I took my picture after we are half of it already

I liked the flavor of the sauerkraut, sweet potatoes, apples, and onion. However, the chops were a bit dry. This was surprising to me because crockpot meat is usually pretty moist. Does anybody have any thoughts about how to make the chops juicier? They were fork tender, just a bit dry.

I did some changes because of what I had. Swopped out Pork for Beef Shoulder Roast. Deleted Sugar and Sauerkraut. Added another small onion, turmeric, basil, Thyme, 3 cloves of garlic, 1/4 cup of red wine, coconut oil, Ceylon cinnamon, and 3 small carrots.

I tried making this recipe without the sauerkraut, because I don't care for it.  I did add white wine as several suggested, but the meat was very dry, almost inedible and a waste of good pork chops.  The sweet potatoes and apples were fantastic.   If I were to make it again I would put the meat on the bottom and perhaps use broth and wine to make sure the meat doesn't dry out.

After sightly browning in the pork chops in a pan, I cooked them in a covered stoneware pot 375 deg. oven for about 45min to one hour.  I cooked the apples separately and added them later to the dish because I don't like it when apples taste like the rest of the dish instead of apples.  I did not drain the canned sauerkraut because I thought it needed the extra juice.   Pork chops came out super tender!

I'll be making this again, but with these changes next time ... * Use thinner chops and salt and pepper them before browning. The really thick ones got dry and were just too much meat and too bland. * Double the spice mixture and sprinkle some on every layer rather than all in one place. * Add a little white wine or stock, 1/4 to 1/2 cup, to fight the dryness. * We like sauerkraut, so this adjustment may not be for everybody, but I used the kraut in the recipe as noted and it was okay, but when I added some extra kraut on top of the leftovers and just heated it through, it was much better. So next time I plan to add another cup or so of kraut over the top of the dish after the cooking but while it's resting. You still get some tang, along with the sweetness.
I'll definitely be making this again, but less bland next time.

I think this turned out great! I baked a 2.5# pork loin @ 325• until an internal temp. of 145• and allowed to rest. Tender and flavorful. Put loin in a cooking bag and added 2 sliced apples, canned yams, 1/2 onion, 3 red potatoes (cut in 1/4's). Rolled everything in brown sugar and nutmeg (including the pork). Plan on using whatever leftovers for some pulled pork!

Had this tonight and we really liked it.  Pork chops are tricky because it is so easy to “turn them into leather” but these were still moist after 8 hours in the crock pot!  I usually follow recipes as written, at least the first time, but made a couple changes this time.  Didn’t have an apple on hand but had an orange and some fresh cranberries from Thanksgiving so I used them instead. I used the thickest bone-in pork chops I could find and did not brown them first.  I think that is what kept them moist.  All in all it was a delicious and nutritious meal.

The sauerkraut didn’t sweeten up, and this had a slightly sour/tangy flavor that I didn’t find appealing or appetizing. My family agree that the chops were tender but 4 out of 5 of us didn’t care for the recipe. I won’t make it again.

I have made this twice just as the recipes said.  This to me is a comfort food.  Love, Love it.  I fixed the first time and invited my sister and brother-in-law over.  He claimed he hated sauerkraut, so I told him he didn't have to eat that part.  He decided to try it, and was hooked.  He even got seconds.

TRIED Dec 27, 2014  EXCELLENT -- loved it!
TENDER VERY TENDER!!  VERY TASTY AND so very easy to put together.
I did add double the brown sugar and also added some ground thyme. CUT apples and onions in large slices and or sections. I used tart apples (Granny Smith).

We love this recipe. I have made it many times. I prefer to use a small pork loin instead of the chops. Never had any issues with dryness like some reviewers mentioned. And the sweet potatoes are always done to perfection. I use the fresh bagged kraut, not the canned. Boars Head makes it. Excellent combo of flavors.

Mom and my brother really liked this dish. The flavor of the potatoes and apples is great.I used frozen sweet potato fries. Made making this dish very easy. The chops were a little bit dry. Not sure what to do about that. I will definitely make it again.

This was a great recipe that I would have used for pork chops but decided to use with a ham instead.  I cut a spiral ham off the bone (put the bone in freezer to use for a seasoning later) and put on top of the sweet potatoes, onions and apples.  Put sauerkraut on top and then poured some (2 cups or so) chicken broth on top.  Cooked for 10 hours while I was at work and it was perfect!  My paleo-only daughter loved it, too!

We made this recipe as is.  The pork was dry, the sweet potatoes, thinly sliced, were still hard and the nutmeg adhered itself to the pork chops.  No one in my family of four voted to put this recipe into our rotation.

I personally thought this was a decent recipe. One worth trying so to taste the flavors together. My husband didn't like it so much due to the sweet potatoes. For a healthy recipe, this is one worth making. Very filling. :)

The sweet potatoes and apples were good but the pork turned out kind of dry.  It was only in the slow cooker for 5.5 hours.  I added the white wine and thyme, as was suggested in previous posts and it was a good addition!

Delicious. I added 1/2 cup of white wine, 2 lg cloves of garlic smashed, omitted the nutmeg which I absolutely DO NOT like, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a sprig of fresh thyme.  This dish is true comfort food.

This was different. But I like all the ingredients separately, so I gave it a try. I thought it was ok- my husband did not. He ate his pork but left everything else and made weird faces through dinner. I think he was being a bit dramatic, as I ate it and liked it ok. However, I don't think I'll be making this one again. Thanks for sharing, though- I am glad we tried it, as you just never know what will be to your taste!

This turned out awful - the sauerkraut I used was way too sour and I used Granny Smith apples I had on hand in addition.  I was really disappointed.  The amount of sugar was too low in my opinion.  Sweet potatoes also took a lot longer to cook and tasted bland (or my tastebuds got killed by all the sour).  If I ever make it again (my husband says no), I'll use very sweet apples for the recipe, and more sugar. I also think I'll skip the sweet potatoes.

Not a lot of flavor.  Meat was tough.  Won't make this again.

While I really enjoyed this recipe, I think I’ll tweak it a bit the next time I make it. I opted for the oven option… which might have led to the sweet potatoes not getting as soft as I’d like. All in all, a great idea. Thanks, RCKim!

I found that even after 6 hours the sweet potatoes and onion had not softened (they were crunchy!) I added 1/2 cup white wine like one reviewer suggested. I had made this dinner to eat before going to the theater with my wife. Because vegetables were not done, I left it cooking while we were at the theater. Came home and ate it, and it was delicious. Pork chops very moist and tender (cut with fork). Vegetables were soft, but not mush. All in all, it cooked 10 hours. Next time I make it (and there will be a next time) 10 hours is what I'm planning on.

Enjoyable flavor but pork seems to dry out in the slow cooker no matter how short/long I keep them cooking!

There was nothing about this recipe that I or my family enjoyed.  I love all of the ingredients but it just didn't work together.

I did not like this recipe at all. I thought the pork chops were rather dry,I didn't like the saurkraut and the apples and last but not least the sweet potatoes were mediocre.
