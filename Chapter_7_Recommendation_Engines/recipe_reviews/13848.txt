I love this recipe. I do change one thing though, I use all stuffing and no breadcrumbs. I made it the first time with breadcrumbs and it was too heavy. The flavors are great and it goes really well with turkey.

My family LOVES this dressing. I've made it at Thanksgiving the past three years. It's always a big hit, and there are never any leftovers. I add low-fat Cream of Chicken soup.

This was quite tasty, but required so much butter I was a little put off. I made as-is, but did not dot with the butter before I put it in the oven. BIG MISTAKE! It needs everything called for.. except maybe a little bit more spice. :D Very good, overall.

This was a good recipe.  I used Mexican Chorizo instead of Italian Sausage for even more of a kick. I also did not drain the sausage after browning with the peppers and onions, then omitted the additional butter on the top at the end.  It was really a hit!

This was good and a nice change. However, with the pre-made corn bread stuffing mix it has a slight store bought taste. Also, do not over process onions and jalapenos or their taste gets lost.

Thanks, this recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  The only change I made was instead of using spicy Italian sausage I used sweet Italian sausage. This allowed for the younger ones to enjoy the dressing as well. I didn't want it too spicy. It gave it a wonderful sweet and spicy taste.  This recipe helped make this Thanksgiving dinner one of the best.

Tasty, but quite salty.  I would try it again using corn bread instead of cornbread stuffing mix.  Loved the jalapenos, the heat was just noticable and just right.

We served this for Christmas (with ham).  It has a very good flavor and is not spicy hot.  I took advice from previous reviews and used 2Â½ boxes (6 oz ea)of cornbread stuffing mix, 32 oz carton of broth and omitted the dry bread crumbs.  I also used plain sausage because we don't like the seasonings in the spicy italian variety.  My increase of stuffing mix resulted in this variation being a bit salty for our sodium sensitive guest, but all in all a good side dish.

Made this to go with a deep fryed turkey party in June and everyone couldn't get enough! I used spicy sausage and made my cornbread from scratch and add Jalapenos to the cornbread. My kids loved it and can't wait till we make it again! Thank you.

This is a new Thanksgiving tradition for us.  I used a 16oz package of cornbread stuffing and skipped the bread crumbs.  Also used Owen's hot sausage.

This is excellent! The only thing I changed was the amount of jalapeno. I only added 1 instead of 2 because I was afraid it would be too hot for my daughter to eat. If I could do again, I would change the plain bread crumbs to cornbread crumbs. I also would have put this in a smaller pan. I only had a 9x13 and spreading it out throughout the pan made it a little dryer than it should have been.

Made a really good dressing, and had a wonderful aroma.  Really easy to make, the hardest part was cutting the onion...I will make this dressing again.  It was a nice switch for Thankgiving.  I used Pepridge Farm Herb seasoning Stugging, and had a great taste to it.

This was one of the best dressings I have ever eaten.  The only thing I did differently was  not to add the jalapeno but used a sausage that was as spicy which was Cajun.  It was just as great.

This dressing rocks!  It's not too spicy, or bland.  It was also very easy to make.  It's not your traditional dressing, but it is delicious.

This is an excellent dish..I made it for a Thanksgiving gathering to try something alittle less traditional. Warning: it is spicy if your stomach can not handle hot like mine. I would omit the hot sausage for mild Italian sausage. I think it would still be good.

We liked this.  It could have been a bit moister.  When we reheat it I will add some broth.  I used very spicy sausage and that made it nice and spicy.

WOW!  I wanted to make something special and unique to go with our Thanksgiving dinner and I was successful in doing so.  I personally don't like spicy foods but this wasn't "hot" spicy.  It was full of flavor spicy.  It has now become a house favorite.  Thanks!

I've prepared this awesome stuffing every Thanksgiving for over ten years now. Most of my family doesn't really care for stuffing but they love this and have requested me to make it for the holidays year after year. It's spicy and firm in texture, very flavorful. You can adjust the spiciness to your liking by adding more jalapeno or for less spice use a combo of sweet/spicy Italian sausage. Also can adjust the chicken broth if you like it a little more/less moist. We like a little crispness on the top, so i bake it a little longer, but it's still moist on the inside. Enjoy!

I have been making this recipe for several years now, and it's become a family and friend favorite.  I've begun doubling it each year, and that's still not enough!  Whenever I ask my family what they'd like to see on the dinner table, they always say the cornbread stuffing! Try it! Your guests will definitely love it!

I love this recipe! Here's how I change it up: I always make a 1.5 batch, but use a whole pound of spicy breakfast sausage. I add celery along with the onions (and sometimes red bell pepper). In addition to the cornbread mix, I cut up a loaf of crusty Italian bread into cubes, toss with melted butter, and toast them. I always end up using more chicken broth and jalapenos. It is seriously the only stuffing my family and friends allow me to make.
