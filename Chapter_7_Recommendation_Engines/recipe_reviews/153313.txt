My daughter and I made these for her to take to summer camp.  We added an extra egg, filled the cupcake papers 3/4 full, put the tbsp. of chocolate chips in the middle and pushed them down a little with a spoon and baked them for 24 mins.  They were great; a perfect consistency!! I guess the extra egg helped!  The melted chocolate chips made a nice little surprise in the center. The icing was really good too.  We used cream cheese icing and added the peanut butter; also added a tsp. of milk to soften the icing a little as per Cookie Queen's suggestion.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I made two small changes--I used chocolate fudge cake mix in place of the brownie mix in place of the brownie mix (the reviews were mixed, I didn't want to waste ingredients since money is so tight. I apologize to those who think I radically adjusted the recipe. Sometimes, you have to go with what works.) and I used Pillsbury vanilla frosting instead of funfetti. These were easy for me to make with my two boys and they turned out really well. I have to say that I was iffy about mixing peanut butter and pre-made frosting but it works. This one's a keeper. My son says he wants this in his recipe box now.

This rating is for the frosting only.  I made the peanut butter cupcakes from this site (amazing) and wanted PB frosting instead of chocolate. After reading several recipes I chose this one for ease.  Why make all the mess when everything you need for the frosting is already done.  It was wonderful and made the cucakes taste even better than they were plain.  I did add a TBS if milk to soften it a little since the cupcakes were so moist it just made it easier to spread.  Awesome!!!!

This will be my go to chocolate cupcake recipe.  I thought something was wrong when they came out of the oven; they felt very heavy and hard but they were perfect!    Dense, rich cupcake.  Thank you for the recipe!

This frosting is great, especially for chocolate & PB fans.  You may have to experiment with the proportions a bit to find a consistency you like, but I have made these twice now and everybody loves them. I will definitely be making them again!

I also added an extra egg to this recipe.  They didn't rise up as much as a cupcake usually dose, however they were very yummy!  The icing was great, I did add more peanut butter to suit our taste.  Not our favorite cupcake, but it is yummy!

5 stars for these mega addicting, party in your mouth  goodness!  These are fabulous with so little effort.  It's not your fluffy cupcake....it's in between cupcake and brownie...no doubt you'll get requests for this recipe.  I didn't change anything.

These were easy and quick to make. My sister in law and I made them when we were craving some chocolate and they satisfied that craving! We followed the advice of some of the reviewers here and added an extra egg to make the cupcakes fluffier and 1/4 a cup of milk to the batter because it was REALLY thick. 
The frosting was very simple and easy to make and we also added a splash of milk to the frosting to make it smoother. Next time we will probably not bake them for the full time because the first batch came out a little overcooked. The second time we put them in for about 16 and it worked perfectly! We had to beat away our guys with the spatulas to keep them from eating the frosting before we had a chance to put it on the cupcakes, it is THAT good!!

I just made a batch of these and since I need to make 72 for a reception on Friday I wanted do a test run.  I followed the recipe on the Duncan Hines Family Size Premium Milk Chocolate box which called for 3 eggs and used a mixture of semi-sweet and dark chocolate and they turned out perfect.  Allowed to cool for 10 minutes before cutting one in half to check the texture and doneness - perfection!  So un-iced they are delicious - can't wait to try the icing too!  Will definitely being using this one again!

5 star for the frosting but it gets a star knocked off for the "cupcakes". The directions were identical to the one on the back of the brownie box. These were brownies and not cupcakes so dont expect a light and fluffy texture cause these arent it. Mine were a lil dry(my fault) but if they werent they would have been amazing. The frosting was heavenly! YUM!

I don't know what happened. I followed the directions to a T and they came out hard as a rock. I couldn't even peel the paper liner off them that's how hard they were. Had to throw them out. Too bad cuz they sounded so good.

This is the best cake frosting I have ever had!! It's not too sweet like some frostings. It sort of reminds me of peanut butter pie. This recipe saved me the night before my 5-year-old's classroom party, because I had all the ingredients on hand.

I made these yesterday for the first time for my bowling team and they LOVED them! They actually taste like Reece's Pieces!

In order to save some time and money, I worked with ingredients that I already had, so I substituted the brownie mix for chocolate fudge cake mix and the funfetti frosting for regular vanilla frosting. 

I tried to use a hand mixer to blend the frosting and peanut butter together better, but it got really dried out and thick, like cookie batter, so I had to add some almond milk (I'm allergic to regular milk) to bring it back to the right texture again. I definitely would NOT recommend doing that again!

Also, I would recommend using peanut butter that has a very smooth, creamy texture. I used a healthy one that had a lot of oil separation, so the frosting kind of fell apart when it got a little warm. It tasted amazing, but just looked a little weird.

I have never written a review for anything on this site... but felt I had to here.  I made both regular size and mini-size.  The minis were really good - took some to work, loved by all.  But the regular size ones just didn't work for me.  I also had trouble with the oil from the peanut butter separating out.  I wanted to pipe on the frosting - did the mini ones then I had to set it down for a bit and come back to it later.  It just got all oily, I don't know.  So I am going to make these again, just the minis tho.

The brownies are sweet enough w/o frosting.  I use any brand of brownie mix with walnuts and follow the mixing directions of this recipe.  I make them as a pan not as cupcakes.  So I add the 1 & 1/2 cups of choc chips to the batter.  Immediately after removing from the oven top with 1/2 cup of choc chips and allow to melt.  Then spread the melted choc chips.  Immediately top with 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and allow to cool.  I have made this several times this way and they disappear.  Everyone will ask you for the recipe, too.

I made this for my brother's graduation and they are TO DIE FOR. Instead of crisco I used the same amount of vegatable oil. When putting the batter in the pan be sure to put alot of chocolate chips in the middle. It makes the cupcake richer. Lastly, I put a whole reeses cup on top of the icing. YUM!

This is more like brownies and peanut butter icing. The peanut butter icing is to DIE for and I will use it in other recipes in the future for sure!

I had to write again because I brought these to work and gave some for my husband to take and people went crazy for them and are already asking when I will be making more.  They will never know how easy they are to make!

**THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE FROSTING ONLY**
This is excellent frosting, and it is so easy to make.  I made it once using the Funfetti frosting, and another time with Whipped Frosting--the Whipped Frosting was definitely easier to handle, as I had a pretty difficult time piping with the Funfetti frosting.  I added between 1/2-1 Tablespoon of milk to thin it out just a bit.  This is DELICIOUS frosting.

These came out very nicely for our church bake sale. I'm so glad they weren't as sweet as I thought they might be. I used chocolate frosting and added more peanut butter than called for (I still could've used more PB and will next time). Thanks for the awesome new way to make "brownies".

So I have been using AR for 4 years now and this is my first review.  I HAD to tell everyone that these are the most amazing cupcakes ever.  The chocolate in the middle is soooo yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

I have to admit, I didn't follow the recipe very closely.  I used Duncan Hines brownie mix (times 3 since I was cooking for a crowd) and followed the cake like brownies recipe (so 3 eggs instead of 2).  My chocolate chips melted so I didn't put them in, instead I shaved the chunk and garnished with it.  For the frosting, I mixed 2 cans of cream cheese frosting with a little less than a 28oz container of crunchy peanut butter.  I made both regular sized cupcakes and mini sized (I had to make them for a dinner of over 100 people).  I didn't like the regular cupcakes, but I loved the mini cupcakes with the frosting.  I thought the large ones were just too much!  I usually don't like canned frosting at all, but I have to admit mixing canned frosting with cheap peanut butter makes magic!!  YUM, the frosting is sooooo good!!

This review is strictly for the frosting. I thought it was good but it didn't have as much peanut butter taste as I would've liked so I added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I also used milk as someone else suggested to thin it out a bit.

These were very good, however there are a few alterations that I would make to this recipe. First off, I think cake mix would be much better than the brownie. Filling it halfway (which you would do with cake batter cupcakes) doesn't really work. The brownies don't rise so it doesn't fill the cupcake completely. Second of all, you better like VERY rich cupcakes. The full tablespoon of chocolate chips was a bit much for our liking. I also think less peanut butter would be good too. I am planning to make these for my daughter's 2nd birthday party in February so I'm glad I have more time to do some trial runs!:) All in all, a very good recipe, just a little rich.

I just finished making these little gems after a week of contemplating them and they were EVERYTHING I'd hoped they'd be!  The recipe is simple and the taste and texture remind me of the peanut butter cupcakes Starbucks serves only for a fraction of the cost!  This will definitely become a family favorite at our house.

You can cut the topping ingredients in half, there was a lot wasted in these measurements. Otherwise these are terrific!

I cut the batter recipe in half (two eggs total) and it made 10 cupcakes.   I kept the icing amount the same.  Wow. That icing is YUMMY.  It’s super thick and while I tried to pipe it with a decorative tip I had to take it off and just pipe It out without it.
Everyone like this.

Yummmmmm! We almost just ate the frosting without the cupcakes! I made these for a potluck, and I think they're going to be a huge hit! Thanks!

Just finished baking these cupcakes and they are deeeelisshhh. I used Pillsbury Devil's Food chocolate cake mix and then cream cheese icing. I added a little peanut butter in the cake batter.  I am just getting into backing and these turned out PERFECT!!! Hubby is going to love them.....Thanks Cookie Queen for the milk tip.

These are wonderful tasting! The chocolate chips in the middle made the middle of the cakes sink in and I highly recommend using cupcake liners.

I used this recipe to prepare mini cupcakes and they turned out pretty tasty. For the frosting, I didn't use all the peanut butter the recipe called for, but just 1/2 cup. My friends couldn't stop eating them and they were gone in a blink of an eye!
