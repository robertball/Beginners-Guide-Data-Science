This is the only kind of relish I knew growing up. Today, it's the only kind of relish I will use. I think I bought a jar of pickle relish once and it got tossed. I'm not a canner, but this recipe is why I learned/am learning to do so myself.

Only put 6 onions in, but that was plenty.  We love the stuff on beans!

The resulting yield was subjective to my interpretation of what large is. As it finished, I had 13 pints of relish. I guess my interpretation of "large" could have been smaller veggies. However, the liquid mix was just right. As for the flavor?  Delicious!

Yummy!  I used peppers and green tomatoes from my garden.  It was easy and turned out great!  Next time I will add some heat.

Delicious! But be prepared for a lot of prep work, and a lot of yield.

Cut down on the peppers and onions. As it was I needed an extra pot to cook. Didn’t have pickling spices, so I just used what I had. Cloves, cinnamon, mustard powder, turmeric. Added an extra cup of sugar as I like it a bit on the sweeter side. Made 10 1/2 pints plus a little left over or the fridge. Put it on a burger for lunch. Mmmm. Think I’ll use this next year for leftover tomatoes. Only had 10 tomato plants. Didn’t think I was going to get that many green ones. 12 lbs!

Do the people who write these recipes ever try them? Gotta say the finished product is outstanding, none better. 
The problem is getting there by way of the recipe instructions. 
I maintain a substantial garden and the ingredients all came from there. I do a lot of canning. I would love to see someone from AllRecipes prep 12 tomatoes, 6 green peppers, 6 red peppers and 10 onions through a food processor in 30 minutes.  Good luck. Further, the stated quantity  or yield is 6 pints. Ha! It is more like 6 quarts. A recipe of that size exceeds the capability of most home kitchens, we just don't have pots, etc., of that size.
Well, at 11 pints I ran out of jars and had to throw a small bit away. This process took me one-half a day.
Again, looking at the times offered in the recipe when I add them up this should be over and done in 55 minutes although the "ready in" time is 3 hours, 15 minutes. Huh?
Feel free to contact me if I can help!
