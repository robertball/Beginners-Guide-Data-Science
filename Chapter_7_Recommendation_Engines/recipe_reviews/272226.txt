These are delish! I omitted the mushrooms because I’m not a fan, but I can see how they’d be great in the filling if you like them. I made my own crust, but store-bought would work just as well if you’re looking for a quick(er) fall/winter treat. I also caramelized the onions in the grease I had from cooking the bacon (plus a little butter), which gave everything a savoriness that went well with the balsamic vinegar and thyme. This was my first adventure with hand pies, and I definitely wasn’t disappointed!

I’m not sure how you can’t love  this.  I had to make 3 batches.  One as written, one without mushrooms, one without cheese and mushrooms- all without bacon....I know, we don’t eat it.  .  This was YUM.

1 star for effort... we love carmelized onion and gruyere cheese and this is a great idea. But, this family gave it a thumbs down.
