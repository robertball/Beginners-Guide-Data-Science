Very little prep time and easy to make.  Excellent flavor.  My friend and I loved it. It has a light flavor yet still filling. It is definitely a keeper recipe.

I give it 5 stars, for ease, quick cooking, and heartiness. In less than an hour, I came in the door, emptied the dishwasher and started this recipe and had dinner on the table! I had everything in my pantry, freezer or crisper. I used my own homemade frozen chicken stock that was previously thawed in the fridge overnight. I added a cup and a half of ditalini cooked al dentè at the end. You can add it uncooked with the veggies. I added a small can of summer crisp corn and a can of chi chi beans to the recipe. The last half hour, I added 6-7 large leafs of Swiss chard torn into large pieces. It’s a cold rainy weekend here in NorCal, this soup with a large hunk of toasty garlic bread is going to hit the spot!

Used a bag of frozen vegetables,  for the corn, beans and carrots and the canned cannelloni beans. Saved time with the frozen veggies and it was a huge hit. Had to triple the recipe for a church function and it worked perfectly. Made it the day before the event and gave the ingredients time to marry. Maybe next time I will add some small pasta.
