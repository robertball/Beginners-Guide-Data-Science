I really liked the flavor and how moist these were. I was scared by the amount of ginger it called for but it was not overpowering at all. I did have to add 3 tbl of sugar to the frosting though as it was just not sweet enough for me.

Although these were okay they didn't really taste like carrot or ginger cupcakes. They were a little too much like pound cake.
