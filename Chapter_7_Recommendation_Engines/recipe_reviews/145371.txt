This was a huge hit at our super bowl party!  The only thing I changed was that I baked them in the oven.  I also used a thick cut bacon for better flavor.  This were so easy to make and so good!  I tripled the recipe and my guests were begging to take the leftovers with them!

We love these!! We don't add the dry onion soup mix since I have a picky husband and we use thick cut peppered bacon for added flavor. I have both grilled and baked these and they never stay on the table long.

Good stuff! I cut the recipe in half - but only used 3 oz of cream cheese and like 1/4 of an envelope of the onion soup mix. I think these would have been a little too salty for our personal preferences with the full amount of soup mix. Great flavor and super easy. Thanks :)

Very good!   I made these with fresh jalapenos out of the garden and they were a big hit at my party.

Excellent! The only change I made was to add shredded cheddar cheese to the cream cheese mixture. It would have been easier to bake though because the toothpicks make it hard to cook on all sides. Great taste!

Delicious!  Cheddar cheese works great.  BAKE on cookie sheet to save calories.  Drain before serving.

I adjusted the recipe a wee bit and it still came out fantastic!  Instead of using the onion dip mix, I used minced green onions. (in the future I going to add a few minced garlic cloves).  I microwaved thick sliced bacon for 7 minutes then wrapped around the cream cheese stuffed jalapeños.  In a preheated 350 degree oven, baked the jalapeños for about 25 minutes.  Bacon was nicely browned and the cream cheese nice and soft.  I skipped the dipping sauce altogether because the appetizer was fully loaded with calories already.  The whole serving platter was empty!  Will definitely make again!
