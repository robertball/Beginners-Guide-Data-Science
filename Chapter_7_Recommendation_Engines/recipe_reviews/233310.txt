This was pretty good. If you needed a quick dish for company in very little time this would be a winner. Easy to make and one dirty pan in the end. I used Pinot Grigio which really sweetened it up I would suggest using Chardonnay or another dry white wine. I will leave out the marjoram next time as it added a background flavor I really didn't care for. I used 1 T. butter and 1 T. sunflower oil to fry the chicken in. Don't use olive oil or it will smoke and leave you with a really funky taste. The chicken was very moist and tender.

Pretty tasty really moist super quick. The sauce is deceivingly strong in flavor when tasting. The chicken simmers in the sauce for just a few minutes so takes on a mild herb taste not overpowering. I used 98% fat free cream of chicken and chardonnay. Hubby approved!
