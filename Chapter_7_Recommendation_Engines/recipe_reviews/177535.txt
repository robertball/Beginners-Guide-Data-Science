Wow, this was very very good. Quite easy to make also. The only thing I will do different next time is chop my garlic after I sautee it. My family loves garlic, but not so much in large pieces.

Excellent!  I didn't put peas in it as it just didn't sound good to me....but we loved it otherwise.

I thought this was decent but the boy thought it was amazing!  He asked me to make this again next week.  I did make a couple of changes based on what I had in the kitchen.  I used italian turkey sausage instead of pork sausage.  I also used a can of roasted garlic roasted tomatoes instead of Prego sauce and I used jarred alfredo sauce instead of heavy cream.  I added a bit of italian seasoning and some dried red pepper flakes as well.

This is a once a week dish in our household. Mu husband absolutely loves it. Whatever is left over goes to work with him the next day. Very delicious, very quick and simple to make. I don't add the peas and I make my own garlic bread. Perfect for my family of 3!!
