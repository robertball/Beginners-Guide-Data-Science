I was really looking forward to a yummy healthy meal but the taste of this soup was VERY DISAPPOINTING!  Will not make again.

Yum! I had lapband (weightloss) surgery 18 mths ago and am always looking for alternative ways to get in my protein requirements. Between the crab and the tofu, this was a wonderful way. Great taste. I didn't need it to be an original recipe, who cares? Be adventurous, try something new, and you might be pleasantly suprised!

I did not care for this recipe. It had too much oregano in it & leaves an aftertaste.

It's an excellant recipe. The base had a delicate flavor. Everything was balance and delicious.
