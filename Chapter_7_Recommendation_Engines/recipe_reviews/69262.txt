We loved it, and didn't do the annoying all recipe thing and change the complete recipe!  Loved it as is, a total hit.  Will probably make the menu for Christmas morning!

This was DELICIOUS :)  I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup, still sweet..next time ill try less.. the method of dipping the biscuit balls in the orange & then sugar mix, I didnt liek much cuz the orange zest wouldnt stay stuck to the balls..so next time , I will sprinkle some sugar w the zest on the bottom of the pan, adn after arranging the biscuit balls ill add some orange zest to it...What I really loved was the consistency of the orange & butter mix , whn it was baked. ..kinda like a heavy syrup type or glaze ...only bad thing was teh 3 rolls got stuck to my pan...so next time i need to spray more butter....but overall it was a good bread!!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This is AMAZING!!!  We made it and had no leftovers for breakfast on Thanksgiving and it has been requested for Christmas!  I did have to extend the cooking time, but it was no big deal.

Delicious!  I was suprised this version still turned out 'gooey' since there was no brown sugar.  I made it with ingredients on hand (lemon rind instead of orange) and decreased the sugar to 1 Cup as suggested.  Very tasty!  Thank you!!!

I prefer a more traditional recipe.  Didn't go over very well at our small group.

This variation of Monkey Bread is absolutely delicious ! I wouldn't change a thing. When I flipped it out of the pan it has a wonderful orange butter sauce that glazes it nicely. This is a keeper for sure !

Excellent recipe.  I don't like to grate orange peel, so buy it in the store in the spice section.  So much easier to use.  For those of you who love the sticky sweetness of the original, you will be surprised how fresh this one tastes as well as being sweet.

They're good. I like the fresh taste that they have. I put aluminum foil under the pan to catch the drips & I put a place on top half way so they weren't to crisp.

It was very easy and good! I used whole wheat buttermilk biscuits in a can (for a slightly healthier version). I also used margarine instead of butter and the reduced sugar orang juice. I did use regular sugar for the dipping though, but next time I might use Splenda instead. Overall, WONDERFUL! It tastes like orange blossoms!

Changed to lemon monkey bread.  I substituted the orange for lemon zest and lemon juice.  They were a success at our church potluck and were gone before any of the chocolate desserts on the table.

Thank you for this recipe. I had 2 tubes of refrigerated biscuit dough left over from another recipe and this did the trick. I didn't have an orange to make zest, so I used 1/4 tsp of orange oil. The flavor was great. Reminded me of orange glazed donut holes. About 1/2 cup of sugar was left when I finished rolling the dough, but this may be because my biscuit tubes were only 7.5 oz each instead of 10 oz. This was easy and called for few ingredients. The whole family enjoyed it and it didn't last long. Thanks again!

I made this today for a dutch oven gathering and they all loved it.  I had some come back many times.  I followed the recipe with no changes except I cooked it outside in my cast iron dutch oven.  It's a nice change.  Will be making this again.

I don't use canned biscuits but rather a homemade sweet dough for the base but the rest of the recipe is excellent.  Perfect for those of us who have to cook for cinnamon haters.  The entire pan was consummed Christmas morning.

This is delicious!  I usually like orange rolls better than cinnamon rolls, and this was a real treat. I did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.

It was perfect. Crunchy outside, gooey and soft inside. Plenty of orange flavor as I did not measure the 1 tsbp. of orange zest but zested two navel oranges and used all the the zest. Great for the holidays!

Delicious! Loved it and I also made it with brown sugar if you like the color to be darker. Either way it was a huge hit.

DELICIOUS.  I made this exactly as stated except had to buy 2 packages of jumbo honey biscuits which was all the grocery store had left.  So I cut them into 6 pieces per biscuit and made a little extra sauce.  I put the sugar and orange zest in a zip lock baggie and shook the biscuit chunks with it.  Then poured the butter orange juice sauce over the biscuits and tossed when in the bundt pan.  If i made this again, i would definitely cover it with aluminum foil when cooking because the top (bottom when flipped over) was definitely overcooked even with the butter mixture.  But the flavor was phenomenal.  Best when served pretty quickly, it doesnt travel well.

I made these in individual muffin tins and they are sooo good.  While they were still hot I spooned on a butter cream glaze with some orange zest stirred into it.  I will make these again.  I wonder how they would be with lemon.  (grammagennie)

I didn't know Monkey Bread could be made even better! The orange flavor is awesome!I did cut back on sugar to 1 cup also and still sweet and delicious.I now have made this several times for brunch.
