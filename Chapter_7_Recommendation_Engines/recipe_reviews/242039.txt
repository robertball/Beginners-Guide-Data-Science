This is the best meatloaf I ever made.  I love the fact that it doesn't have flour or milk in it.  I used 3 eggs instead of 2 eggs and 2 egg whites and 2 lbs ground beef, no turkey.  I used 6T tomato sauce and 2T of chili garlic sauce mixed together for the chili sauce.  It was so good.  I haven't made meatloaf in probably 3-5 years, but this will be on the menu again soon.  Love it!!!!

I bought a vacuum-sealed tri-pack of ButterballÂ® ground turkey.  Mixed up this meat loaf thinking that the turkey was a 1 lb pkg (why, WHY do they package turkey like this?) and then when I was cleaning up, noticed that the pkg held 22 oz, not 16 (my mistake).  So this meat loaf ended up with an extra 6 oz of turkey.  The only negative comment I have is that it was a bit on the dry side, and I think it should have come out of the oven sooner.  Even with the additional meat, after the final 20 minutes in the oven, I checked the temp for doneness, and it was 189 degrees F (instead of 160).  I will be checking the temperature in the future much earlier, and adjust the time as necessary (or just reduce the temp to 350).  I liked the combination of the ground sirloin and turkey for meat loaf, the flavor was very good. I always use chili sauce (like that extra tang you get)  instead of catsup when making meat loaf, so overall, I was pleased with the way this turned out. I made a couple small changes...used freshly-minced garlic, subbed Egg Beaters for the whole egg, but did use the fresh egg whites.  Thanks, Betsy, for a healthier meat loaf (good sandwiches coming for the rest of the week).

So happy to find this recipe!  Like some others, I used 6T tomato sauce and 2T chili sauce to cut the heat a bit on this.  I did miss the sweetness of classic ketchup toping but this is a great compromise to have some good flavor without added sugars.  I think you could cut the oats to 3/4 cup and I might try that next time.
This baked well in an 8inchX8inch casserole dish.

My big change was that I used a pound of ground pork sausage instead of beef. Oh my was this good. I also put a carrot and celery in the blender with the onion and fresh  garlic to up the veggies and add a bit more moisture.

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it.  I made the following changes. Used 1 lb of ground turkey, 1/2 cup coarsely ground oats,  1 Tbsp flaxseed meal, 1 Tbsp chia seeds, 1 egg,  1/2 large onion sauteed first, 1 garlic clove minced, fresh basil, fresh parsley, pepper and 2 Tbsp medium salsa.  I pan fried the meatloaf for a few minutes on each side before baking it.  After 40 minutes I added some salsa to the top of the meatloaf and baked an additional 10 minutes.  It was moist and delicious!  Next time I might add a little more of the oats since it was a bit sticky.

I added chopped jalapenos and mushrooms and did not add the egg whites, turned out just fine. Keep an eye on temp as it cooks faster than listed

This was very good, says hubby the meatloaf expert. The meatloaf was moist and tasty. I eat gluten free and this recipe with gluten free oats make it possible for me to eat meatloaf. Thank you for posting this recipe. It's awesome!

This is a fantastic meatloaf!  My kids, mom, and picky husband all enjoyed and gave a thumbs up.  The only change I've made is to pull it earlier.  Mine always seems to be done after the first 50 minutes but that could be the size of my pan.  All in all, wonderful recipe!

Very tasty! My family didn't even know there was turkey in it. I did have to substitute wheat bread crumbs because I didn't have any oatmeal. Turned out perfect!

I used panko crumbs instead of oatmeal and fire roasted salsa instead of chili sauce. I added chiles in adobo and carne asada seasoning and it tasted great!

I added crushed croutons to the oatmeal just because it sounded good and used 2 eggs and no egg whites. I didn't have chili sauce so substituted with Catalina dressing. Topped the meatloaf with cheese. Was very good and made for delicious leftover meatloaf sandwiches.
