Turned out great with a few changes, thanks to the advice of the other reviewers. Cut down the milk to 2 cups and I used 1 cup of long grain brown rice.   I probably used twice as much ham and cheese too because I didn't measure that. No green bell peppers for us and more like half an onion. It was easy to put together and a big hit with my family! The whole 9 x 13 pan was eaten between the 4 of us!! Chomp chomp delicious!!

I had leftover turkey ham and wanted to find an easy casserole recipe to use it up.  I doubled the recipe but otherwise followed it exactly.  It is not only pretty to look at but delicious & even my picky eaters ate it up.  Thanks for helping me put dinner on the table tonight!

I used Minute Rice. It turned out to be mush. I will try the recipe again using regular long grain white rice.

I used 2 cups of milk, and regular rice, cooked it on the stove top for 90 minutes then put it in the oven for 30.  It thickened up but was just to salty. Won't be making it again.

Finally a great recipe for leftover ham!  Quick to make and very tasty! I added a couple spices but the blend of flavours is probably good without them!

My wife really liked this. Me, not so much.  I never try a recipe without reading the reviews because they are so helpful in avoiding disasters.  I followed three suggestions.  I cut the milk to two cups and increased the ham to two cups.  I would use even more next time.  And I used long grain rice instead of minute rice which I don't like anyway.  I found that the dish was almost burned on the bottom and edges.  Next time I will cook covered for only one hour and uncovered for a half hour.  It was at least a nice change from scalloped potatoes and ham..

Didn't bother to make it. I don't buy instant rice. I found another recipe online where I could add already cooked rice. I used brown basmati rice with similar ingredients and it was delicious.

Used 1/4 packet instant veg soup mix in place of the flavor packet. 
1c cream 1c milk.
1pack ham chopped
Really good
Yes I know I didnt follow the exact recipe but these are my notes so I can remember what I did.

I really will make this one again.  Made it with some spicy mexi -corn since I didn't have the carrots on hand.  The kids loved it.

Loved this! Didn't have any green peppers so substituted 1 cup green peas and listened to the other reviews and used only 2 cups milk. The only thing I would change is it didn't specify HOW big of a pan to use. It didn't look like that much so I put it in a 11X7 pan. It overflowed in my oven. So use a 13X9 pan next time. Other than that it was really yummy and easy!

This recipe tastes and looks wonderful.  My husband and I both had seconds.  I used Uncle Ben's instant rice.  Like a previous poster said, there is too much liquid!  I will make it again, but I will cut the milk to 2 cups the next time.

My concern just looking at the recipe before making it was that there was too much liquid in it and that it baked too long for instant rice, and I was right.  I halved the recipe but didn't alter anything and it was still watery and nothing but mush after 2 hours of baking time.  I was so hoping for a creamy lovely rice casserole but it didn't work out that way.  I'm not sure how this already has three good reviews, but it didn't work for me.
