Yummy! I was afraid to try it because of some of the negative reviews, but I had shrimp on hand that needed to be cooked so I had to do it. I'm glad I did. I only had half a cup of sour cream, so that's all I used. I used 5 oz of large shrimp but cut them up first. I also used a cheddar/jack mix and onion powder instead of green onion. After hearing that some thought it was bland, I added a little tabasco, garlic powder, ground mustard, and dried parsley for color.  It was so good.

While the Gruyere cheese makes this quiche really special, it is even better with some Emmental too. Add a little garlic powder to the mix, and you've got an extremely tasty and elegant quiche. I have made them with circles of puff pastry in mini-muffin tins, and they are a wonderful appetizer.

This was one of the best quiches I've ever had!!! It was light and a little fluffy (how quiche should be I think). I made no changes, except I mixed the ingredients together and then poured it into the shell. The Gruyere cheese and the shrimp were a great taste together...what a nice, light meal.

Quite good and definitely easy to make.  I added a pinch of cayenne pepper for some kick.  Just one change: My quiche needed to bake for 45 minutes until it was ready.  If it takes longer for yours to bake too, then I'd recommend rotating the quiche once.

i just made this quiche and it was delicious! I partially pre-baked the crust (about half the cooking time).  I added an extra egg, used frozen salad shrimp, cheddar cheese instead of Gruyere, and instead of just a tablespoon of sliced green onion, I sliced up the whole thing.  I also used probably closer to a cup of cheese and a little more shrimp than called for.  The only thing is the cook time.  It took mine about 40 mins or so.  Great recipe overall!

This was a great recipe! I made two quiches and my husband preferred this one because of the unique flavors.  I have never seen a quiche recipe with sour cream and I think that is the key to the rich taste. The ingredients did not fill my premade pie shell so next time I will increase the servings to 8.  Give this one a try, you won't regret it.  Simple to make and very different!

This was not very good.  The sour cream gave the quiche a strange tart taste, and it didn't have enough cheese.  We also didn't like the consistency.

This is a great start for a wonderful shrimp quiche.  I modified the recipe a bit because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand.  I used a bit more cheese, about a cup and a half of mixed cheeses, asagio, cheddar, colby and monterey jack.  Also I cooked the shrimp in butter, soy sauce and tangerine juice to give it some extra flavor.  I diced some jalapeno and added it for a bit of a kick.  It turned out great! I thought the sour cream was awesome!  I will definitely do this again.

I made this with swiss and a small amount of cheddar and also added sauteed mushrooms.  I would recommend cooking the shrimp with some kind of seasoning and increasing the amount of green onions.  As it is, it doesn't have enough flavor.

It was 5 stars with the changes I made based on some other reviews, so I guess I can't technically rate the recipe as is.  

Changes: used chopped up frozen cocktail shrimp, more green onion, Swiss instead of Gruyere, and added a little bit of cayenne pepper and soy sauce.  I also mixed all the ingredients before pouring into the shell, and increased the cook time by about 10 minutes.  

Two of us ate the entire quiche for lunch.  So yummy!

Made with unbaked pastry shell and baked for 45 - 50 minutes.  I also sprinkled some parmesan on top before baking.  Very good.

I prepared this recipe pretty much as is and thought it had a wonderful taste.  I used larger shrimp and had to cut them up.  I chose the recipe for its' simplicity, very few ingredients, all of which I happened to have on hand.  Hubby suggested next time to add some roasted red peppers.

I followed the directions except I made it without a crust.  I make quiche quite often and found this one to be a bit bland.  Considering how expensive the Gruyere was (I had never bought it before), I expected the quiche to be better.  I would add some hot sauce or hot pepper next time.  Like others, I had to cook mine 45-50 minutes.

I really liked the recipe but tweaked it a little going in. First, I used a little more cheese and a little less sour cream (regular since I hate cooking with light). I also added sauteed mushrooms (I sauteed them with the shrimp) and a few ounces of lump crab meat. Plan on making it again soon as it was very popular.

I used Swiss cheese and small salad shrimp, and had to bake it for 10mins longer for it to set. I thought it was OK, but I made this for my husband who enjoyed it.

This was really good!  Didn't have canned shrimp so I cut up and sauted some frozen shrimp I had.  Loved the sour cream and will add this to other quiche recipes I have.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  Followed instructions precisely except that (having bought raw shrimp) I sauteed the shrimp in bacon fat.  Also added a pinch of curry and garlic powder.  The gruyere and sour cream are a wonderful combination.  Will definitely make this again!

To work with what I had, I substituted a monterey jack goat cheese for the gruyere and it was delicious.  Bake time ended up almost 50 minutes.  Yummy Quiche!  My dinner guest ate 2/3 of the pie in one night!

After reading the reviews I did tweek the recipe to our taste. I cooked the pie shell for only 5 minutes. Sautéed the shrimp in Old Bay garlic and herb for more flavor and only used 2/3 cup sour cream, added a pinch of cayenne.  I cooked it for 30 minutes , the  crust and pie came out perfect. 

We loved this recipe and will make again and trying the suggestion of shrimp and crabmeat.

The sour cream dominated the flavour of this quiche to the extent that you loose the flavour of the shrimp and cheese. I cooked the quich for 30 minutes but had to cook it for another 15 minutes because it was  not set after the 30 minutes.

As this recipe  was bland, i used 3 eggs,  heavy cream, parsley,  dry mustard, Old Bay, rosemary leaves and salt and pepper with a medium chopped shallot.  

I also sautéed medium shrimp in butter for additional taste.

It was very flavorful and the custard consistency was excellent.   Very fluffy.

I used a deep dish pie crust and baked that first. I did not bake the shrimp first. Doubled the cheese and the eggs and the onions. Put half the cheese over the shrimp. Covered the entire dish with a second pie crust, scored it, and then put thinly sliced greyere cheese (the remainder) on top (made a beautiful presentation). Cooked for longer since it was covered up. IT WAS A HUGE HIT!!! Best recipe I've made in a long time. Even our picky kiddo devoured it.

This quiche was a complete success. Even my son who doesn't usually like quiche had seconds. I made my own base. Also added carrots to it and it was lovely. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

As usual I used different stuff, larger  cooked shrimp and 3 cheeses, cheddar, Brie and Mozz a bit more than they said.
I also added a slight amount of pimento.
2 Thumbs up all around.

I gave this 5 stars because it’s a great starter recipe and easy to modify depending on your taste.  I’ve made it several times now, and it’s never the same. This time I doubled  the recipe but instead of doubling the sour cream I used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup 1/2&1/2. I mixed a little Parmesan cheese in with Swiss and used 2 extra eggs because I was using a derp dish pie crust, which adds about 20-30 minutes to the cook time.

So good!  My mom and I practically ate the whole thing in one sitting!  Loved the cheese too.  Took a bit longer to cook than stated though.  I cooked it about 45 mins.

This turned out wonderful. I had never tried quiche with sour cream in it. I did make a few adjustments. I added onion, fresh mushrooms and blue cheese, as I did not have gruyere. I also grated old cheddar on top. Baked up beautifully but I did have to cook it for about 40 mins. My bf loved it and he traditionally is not a quiche man :)

Nice basic recipe that will lend itself to adding ingredients. I'm thinking bits of bacon, or some spinach. It stand well on its own as posted. I used smoked gouda cheese because I didn't have any Gruyere on hand. Thanks for posting!

Excellent quiche.  As one other review noted, mine took 45 minutes till done.  I am also a novice cook, so others may know this already, but let it sit 5 minutes or so before slicing.  My first couple of slices lacked a bit of structural integrity.

I really enjoyed it. I made a few minor changes but mostly stuck to the recipe. Added a few more eggs and some mushrooms.

My husband and I loved this!  Based on other reviews, I added a dash of cayenne and garlic powder, plus an extra egg, but I think it was the gruyere cheese that made it so good.  I did not measure ingredients carefully and that didn't seem to matter.  I pre-baked the store-bought crust, based on the recipe's crust ingredient stating "baked" pie crust.  And it did take longer to cook than the recipe required, but I usually find that to be the case with quiche, and with my extra egg, I expected as much.  An easy-to-put-together recipe.  I will be using this recipe to take to special events.

I did add some mushrooms and a little sausage and I loved it. I was looking for a recipe that used shrimp, and I will make this recipe again.

I love this recipe. So fast and easy for weeknight meal and good next day too. I only modified the shrimp by using frozen salad shrimp, defrosting overnight in fridge and draining off the liquid. Then I cook it up in a skillet with olive oil, minced garlic and old bay seasoning. I do this while the pie crust is pre baking for 10 minutes. By cooking the shrimp this way it adds a good spicy flavor to the shrimp while getting rid of any leftover ice crystals. I replace the Gruyere cheese with muenster, which is easier to find. Turns out great.

It was ok.  In retrospect I'd prefer a quiche that's more eggy.   I will probably lose the sour cream and stick with an egg base predominantly.  I did add spinach to it, so that made it better for me, but still, more egg is more satisfying for me.

It took almost an hour before I could get the moisture out.  I also added nutmeg an red pepper.  Still needs more flavor.  More onion an I think I’ll try a little Tabasco next time.  I also added bacon and mushrooms.

Very good. I used cheddar cheese instead.
