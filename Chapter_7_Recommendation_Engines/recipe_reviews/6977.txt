This was ok... but it needs something. I admit I was worried putting the batter into our big cast iron skillet (how long am I going to be cleaning this?) but it came out perfect without sticking at all. The taste is pretty bland. I used fresh side pork; maybe bacon would be a better choice. Thanks so much for the Southern recipe - we really enjoy old/regional recipes.

thanks for the recipe. I have never heard of this and I don't care for cornbread but I made this for dinner and the whole family enjoyed it
