Delicious! I made these for a potluck and they were a hit. The changes I made due to reading the reviews, was to add more chips, I used a whole bag instead of what the recipe called for, I was concerned that they wouldnt harden in time..But they did..Also when I scooped I used the soft insides for making the balls and left the outside crunchy brownie edges in the pan, So when all was done, then I poured the leftover melted chips, and nuts, and coconut into the the pan and it made another yummy treat. Waste not want not right? I also found that using a pastry brush to glob the chocolate on the ball was helpful, keeping the chocolate warm by setting it inside a pan of hot water helped too.

If you love chocolate... this is the recipe for you. These were very rich. I wasn't sure how big to make them so mine turned out a little bigger than I wanted them to be. I would suggest cutting the 9x13 pan into about 24 pieces and then rolling those into balls. When I dipped them I didn't let the chocolate run off. I put mine on a large cookie sheet with foil lining the bottom. They came off easily that way. It takes an unusually long time for the chocolate to harden (probably about 5-6 hrs on the counter top). Overall, a great recipe though!

This was my second time trying to melt chocolate in a regular sauce pan, so I'm pretty sure I did it wrong since it came out burned and tasting funny. But I really like the idea, so I'm going to keep trying to get the chocolate melted just right! I would love some advice on how to melt chocolate nicely if anyone has any! And it's fun to decorate the little bite-sized brownies. :3

This was an easy recipe and just a little bit different than your average brownies.  I like to serve one brownie ball and one scoop of ice cream and then top it off with a little fudge sauce.  It looks really classy when served like this.

I love this recipe.  I first made it last year around the holidays and then lost the recipe so I tried making by memory and got pretty close.  I also only use the soft inside of the brownies and leave the crusty edge in the pan.  I scoop mine with my cookie scoop and they turn out round on top with a flat bottom to sit on.  I use a double boiler method for melting the chocolate mixture.  I used toothpicks to hold the balls while dipping into the chocolate.  They keep for a few days in the refrigerator, but are best served at room temperature.

I made these with white chocolate but the chocolate sauce was too thin.  Next time I'll use less sweetened condensed milk.

love this recipe-have made it a half dozen times- I use a smaller pan than the brownie box designates-make big tall thick squares, still kind of squishing the sides while they're warm so theres no crumbs, dip one at a time (if it seems too thin add a small handfull more choc chips.) and place on a wire rack with a piece of foil under it.  The kids have never complained about cleaning up the drippings!  These dont set up hard like a shell chocolate, more like a soft fudge, I move them from rack to serving platter with two forks to avoid smudging them up.  Always the "wow" of the dessert table. Have never had one left so I dont know how they keep!

Excellent for those chocolate lovers, but a little messy to make. I used "dipping chocolate" that you can microwave to avoid using more dishes. My boyfriend accused me of messing up the brownies, until he tried one...Loved it!  I took them to an open house and they were the talk of the night!

These were very good.  I used a store-brand brownie mix and used the fudgy recipe (a opposed to the cake-like recipe). I used a 9x13 pan, cut around the edges to get rid of the crust, and cut the rest into 64 pieces.  The coating was a disaster - I tried using white chocolate, and it was way too runny.  I added regular chocolate to thicken it, but it just didn't seem to want to set up.  Next time I'll just use plain chips, maybe with a little crisco or butter added.

I thought this was a great idea!  They were very yummy and a hit when served!  You will need to devote a little time and a little clean up, but it is worth it!

These were very good. I had to add about 2 Tbsp. of milk to the coating to get it to the right consistency. It was too stiff.

I dipped my brownie squares into white chocolate after cutting them for a more festive look at Christmas Pot Luck. They looked great and everyone loved them. I do think they would taste better with regular chocolate because I am not a huge fan of white chocolate but the idea worked well for the purpose and they were still quite good.

Easy and delicious!  Roll in powdered sugar and chocolate won't stick to your fingers.  A really great item for a buffet.

Very yummy, but messy.  The coating never seemed to fully harden even after leaving them in the freezer for an hour.  I tried a different version with lemmon squares and white chocolate as well and those were an even bigger mess!
