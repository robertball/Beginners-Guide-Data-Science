This was a nice change from the usual soups in my rotation. I sauteed the onions, celery and some garlic in butter before adding small dice of potato and covering with chicken stock plus a bay leaf.  I pureed about half the cooked mixture because I like a chunky soup.  I cut the kielbasa into 1/4" half coins and sauteed them before adding the puree and remaining veggies.  I don't use dry mixes but I like ranch dressing so added a few squirts to taste along with cream to desired consistency.  Used fresh-cracked white pepper to taste.

We really didn't care for this dish too much.  This was the first time I've come across a soup recipe that was void of herbs.  I tried adding a few but it didn't seem to help any.  Sorry, but this recipe makes a very bland soup (even after adding a TON of salt).  If your looking for a really good Potato soup recipe then type in "Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup" in the search tool...the submitter is "Karena".  It doesn't call for sausage but I don't see why you couldn't add it in there.  One word of caution...the "Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup" isn't a two step type of dish.  It takes a bit more work than this one but it's a much better recipe.  Happy cooking everyone!

I made this soup for my parent's anniversary.  I didn't add as much half and half, and I also added potato chunks to give it some texture.

My husband and I like this recipe ... but with a couple of changes. We like chunkier soup, so I didn't puree the potatoe mixture. MUCH better! Also, I had to add a little more salt because it was a little bland. Otherwise, it's pretty good!

We tried this recipe and after reading the other reviews, decided to make a few changes when making it.  We added 2 packs of chicken bouillon to the water that we cooked the potatoes in.  We also like a chunkier soup, so we didn't puree the potatoes and reduced the half-and-half to a pint.  It still wasn't quite thick enough so I tried something from another recipe and added 2 cups of instant potato buds and cooked for another 7 minutes at the end.  Ultimately, we all loved it.

I made some slight changes based on what we had on hand (real kielbasa, red potatoes instead of russet, whole milk instead of half & half, plus a carrot just because I like carrots in my potato soups).  Based on other reviews, I added a bay leaf and a little thyme, as well.  The result was a rich, creamy soup that my husband and kid loved!

I made so many changes, it probably can't be called the same recipe but here goes. I used leftover turkey, coconut milk, added chicken stock, xanthan gum to thicken, and a bit of sour cream, turnips instead of potatoes. Otherwise, it was the same.

This was very good. we carmelized the onions and some garlic in olive oil and butter before adding the other veggies. we didn't puree all the potatoes so as to have potato chunks to match the photo. we also added about 2 tbsp of finely chopped pepperoni, replaced some of the water with a 1\4 cup cooking sherry and added some dried thyme.
