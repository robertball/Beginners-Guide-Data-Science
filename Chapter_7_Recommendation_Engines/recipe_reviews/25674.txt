Substituted some ingredients with tomatoes and celery, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Only problem was, I overcooked the meat...  Great taste!

Followed the recipe to the letter and it came out so bland. I ended up sprucing it up with more seasoning. Memories of beef stew my mom made for my dad (who didn't like certain spices)...bland

I used red potatoes instead of the whites and it was still delicious!  Big hit - great for a chilly evening!

My whole family loved this recipe... I only left the bell peppers out! With 6 kids it is hard to find something that everyone will eat. Definitely a keeper!!

Fabulous stew. I used olive oil instead of butter and left out the bell pepper, used less bullion I didn't measure it just added to taste. Also added a cup of red wine doubled the recipe. I served this with Fabulous Homemade Bread from AR :)

We tried this recipe out. With a few slight modifications it was scrumptious! We opted out of using peppers, swapped the Italian Seasoning for 1tbsp of Montreal Steak Spice and used some of the potato water in the stew. We also used one additional bouillon cube because we had a pack of 6 and needed to use two pots anyways. We felt like it could use a thickener like corn starch but didn't have any on hand. The final result was a bit more soupy than stew-like but still great. Will definitely have again, and recommend to others.
