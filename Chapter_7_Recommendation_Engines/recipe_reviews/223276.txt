This is fantastic! I've made this recipe twice now in the past couple of weeks. My only alterations were that I used about half the amount of lemon juice called for, an extra garlic clove, and added a little cumin. I thought it was really good, plus I got rave reviews from husband and dinner guests!

Hi Basil, thank you very much for this wonderful recipe that reminded me to the taste of "Pita im Hummus" which I enjoyed so much during my Israel vaccation 25 years ago. Done quick and easy it will be on my favorite list! Best regards from Germany, Sabine

Make this just like it directs! I thought it would be too lemony, based on reviews, but if anything, i could have added a touch more lemon! In all, a fine basic recipe. I sprinkled some paprika over the top, in addition to the final 1/4 cup of olive oil. Serve with flatbread--enjoy!

I’ve made this recipe multiple times and it’s come out great each time. I’ve started to use dried beans and reconstitute and cook them but other than that the recipe is unchanged.

Great starter recipe, cut the olive oil in half with roasted sesame oil, and roasted a whole bulb of garlic and refrigerate  over night.

This was really good! It had great flavor. My only recommendation would be to combine the lemon juice and tahini together,  process it, then add the chickpeas and any other ingredients. It just makes it smoother.

I have finally found a hummus recipe that I actually like.  I have been making different recipes for several years for my family but have never been a fan!  Yeah!  This one has the right proportions for my taste.  I followed the recipe as written, although I did substitute bought lemon juice and just  guessed on the amount.  Yummm.  Thanks!

Definitely spot on and authentic!  I agree it tastes as close to my Middle Eastern friend's hummus.  Wow!  I will be keeping this as a staple in my home.

Made two pints of creamy delicious hummus! I use it for sandwiches instead of mayo. I add Cummin and Paprika. Try it in egg salad instead of mayo it is amazing!

I’ve tried MANY hummus recipes. This is the BEST I’ve had. It’s so versatile! I’ve made 25+ types of hummus with this basic,but delicious recipe. Two things, It makes A LOT! So cut it in half if you want less. BUT! You can split it up and make many simple variations. 2more cloves of Garlic for the (Garlic Lover??).1 tsp of Lemon juice powder if you want lemon hummus. Have fun with this one ????!

I've used this recipe many times and it is great as it is! Sometimes I halve the recipe as it makes a lot and it is best fresh. I also sometimes change the garbanzo beans for pink, red or kidney beans for a change in flavour and additional fiber. I prefer a  lot less tahini, and a little less garlic to let the natural tastes combination prevail. Both garlic and tahini can overpower. Try it! It is also nice with the addition of some roasted red pepper processed with the beans, or a pinch of cayenne. Enjoy! It is wonderful paired with tabouleh and fresh homemade pita bread!  Great recipe!

This recipe was delicious, basic so you can enhance if you desire.   It makes a large batch, I just shared with a friend.  I did not use the oil for serving.  Thank you so much!

So good! I used Sesame Oil at about 1/2 mix with Olive Oil, since, that's all I had left (under-estimated my olive oil :-D )and I also added pepper to taste and topped it with fresh parsley from the garden. MAJICAL.

The consistency is great, but personally, I like a little more depth of flavor.  I added another garlic clove, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 1/8 tsp paprika, and only used one lemon.

I suggest blending the beans and oil first, and adding tahini and lemon juice in increments until its to your liking.  The full cup of tahini and 3 lemons are more than I like or usually use. I used 1/4 cup of roasted sesame oil in place of 1/4 cup of the olive oil.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it made my food processor overflow, and I was left with a lemony-oily mess all over the base of the food processor and counter.  However, it tasted great, and was a big hit with my family and friends.

I followed the recipe exactly, except when it came to pouring the one-fourth cup of olive oil over it, I wimped out and only put a tablespoon or so. This remind me of the hummus I had at a restaurant in Jordan that was so good that a friend and I ignored the rest of the buffet and just spread it on freshly baked pitas for lunch. The only problem I have with it is that it makes too much. Next time I will make half a recipe.

Excellent! I was a little low on olive oil, so cut it  with water and added some kosher salt. The water makes it a bit lighter in colour and consistency. Still delicious!

i tried to follow this recipe but the 1 cup of olive oil was just a bit too much fat  so i only put 1/2 cup but still tasted too oily for me, the lemons i also only used 2 not three, the tahini which i love i also added less of about 1/3. Then it was perfect for me. With hummus i also love adding 1/4 cup cilantro at times, tastes so fresh. Cumin and turmuric are also spices that i add often to my hummus. Yummm have to make some more!

Made as is but with garlic purée as I don't like the taste of raw garlic. I might try it with roasted garlic next time. Delicious

Great recipe and easy to make. However, if you like REAL middle eastern food theres a few changes to make!
First, add an extra garlic clove. Second, most of the time we use chickpeas instead of garbanzo beans, but either or are fine. Lastly, once finished, top with paprika, and parsley ! It adds more flavour, and of course looks prettier (:
Great to serve with herb and garlic triscet crackers by the way !

My husband and friends loved this hummus! I felt there was just  too much lemon and not quite enough garlic, so I'll adjust the recipe next time accordingly. Even as written it's really tasty. This recipe makes a ton.

I added a jar of roasted red bell peppers (drained) and it was delicious. Great as a sandwich spread too.

I reduced the lemon juice slightly, but, other than that made exactly as the recipe stated.   It was a perfect texture and had good flavor.  I served with homeade bagel chips.
