You know what?  This did have a little too much vinegar for me. But you will never believe what I did! I made the recipe again and cut down on the vinegar.(What an ingenius idea).Then this was like the perfect chicken dish. AWESOME!

Try substituing 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth for the vinegar for a "truly southern" version of this classic.  Also substitute vidalia onion for red onion.

As an experienced cook, I am assuming the reason you make a roux is to slowly introduce the liquid so it thickens (and reduces). That way, the vinegar cooks out. I did it exactly the same except for I only cut the chicken into 4. And I didn't have red pepper flakes :(. Thanks so much and we will definitely make again

I wish I would have read the other reviews before trying this recipe. I agree, this is WAY too much vinegar.  My family and I didn't like it AT ALL.

The vinegar in this dish was so overwhelming I ended up throwing the meal away! I will make again, without the vinegar and from another recipe.

This was delicious!  However, I did halve the vinegar as suggested by others.  I would recommend starting with 1/2 cup and then adding to taste from there.  My family loved it and Iâ€™ll definitely make again!

the apple cidar vinegar I used was over powering.  I must have done something wrong.
Oh! Dont use butter as a substitute.  It doesnt cook hot enough. I messed up in so many ways.
