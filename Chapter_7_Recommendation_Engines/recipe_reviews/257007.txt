I made two different turkey muffins last night and these were by far the best. I made as written except that I may have been a little heavier handed with the Worceshtershire and cheese. Between the two of them though, the muffin almost looked like beef as it was baking. Green onion was my onion of choice but red would be pretty too. By far the best looking and tasting turkey meatloaf I have had.

I left out the peppers & onions because they can bother my stomach but I season with dry minced onion. I also left out the milk . I added a pinch of red pepper flakes. I used a shredded Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar cubes. I cooked for 30 minutes & then topped muffins with bbq sauce & baked an additional 5 minutes.  Very flavorful & perfect consistency.

Husband and I both loved this. Liked the crunchiness on the outside. We both thought it could use a little bit of some spices, little less salt (we don't use too much salt).  I cut the recipe down to 6 servings and it made 6 mini loaves.

It's only me and my husband so I cut the recipe in half,  used shredded cheese with Monterey Jack and cheddar,  added 2 T of A-1, added 1 tsp of onion powder then put a little of A-1 on top of each muffin, the result was the best turkey meatloaf ever!

I was really surprised how good these were.  I halved the recipe since I was cooking for myself.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  Tonight I had no cheese, so I doubled, subbed a can of cream of mushroom for the cheese and used 1/2 cup of Ripple Milk Substitute.  It was amazing!  I've made it several times, both with and without cheese-great both ways!
