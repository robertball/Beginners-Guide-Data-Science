These were really good. I did not have any chocolate cream cheese (I couldn't find it anywhere) so I subbed nutella and I thought it paired superbly.

Absolutely delicious cookie!  I made them for our family Christmas Eve get together this year and they were gone almost as soon as I set out the plate. I had never used flavored Philly Cream Cheese before so I was doubtful about the flavor so I bought a jar of Nutella, just in case. There was absolutely no need for that because the cream cheese is delicious!                     The recipe gave me exactly 30 cookies, which I baked for exactly 12 minutes. They were firm, slightly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Any longer would have made them crumbly. This cookie is a permanent part of my holiday baking!
