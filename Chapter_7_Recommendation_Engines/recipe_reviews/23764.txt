Very good appetizer.  I made a few modifications, though.  I couldn't find thai red chile sauce, so I subsituted a honey-teriyaki.  I also added crushed red pepper to spice it up.  Also, instead of balls, I formed an oblonged type shaped.  Once cooked (in an 400 degree oven rather than frying), I inserted wooden skewers for easy handling.  Try drizzling extra sauce over the skewers once plated and set a bowl of sauce on the side for dipping.  A big hit at the New Years Eve party I attended this year.  Thanks Vivian!

Made this recipe for a Girls Night Out and had at least 5 people ask for the recipe.  Used ground turkey, added minced garlic and ginger, used panko bread crumbs and also an egg white so it would stay together...everything else just as the recipe states!  DELICIOUS!!  (I also browned them in a saute pan and then baked them on a cookie sheet for 15 min at 350 degrees so they would all be ready at once)

I like to buy ground chicken but don't have many ideas or recipes for it, so this was a great find -- I did make some modifications for my family and our taste.....I used Panko Bread crumbs, fresh basil instead of cilantro -but not a cup--added garlic, ginger, green curry paste, and dried lemon grass, I have a spice blend called Bangkok seasoning (bought at Penzey's spices)and spinkled that liberally in the mix. Made a glaze with pan drippings, soy sauce and more chili sauce -- WOW-- These turned out great! Thanks so much for a great meal!

Very delicious - made a few changes.  I live in Thailand, so bought a standard herb/spice pack with the onion, ginger, limes (no real "lemons" here in Thailand, just imported - so limes give it more of a real Thai taste), chilies, and lemon grass. Followed the recipe as-is, but grated a bit of the Thai ginger in, added one crushed clove of garlic, and about 1/2 tsp salt.  I let the mixture sit over night, with 2 stalks of lemon grass stuck in for the flavour.  Pull out the lemon grass before making into meat balls. I also baked, as per other reviews.  Delicious.  My Thai friends loved them.  Served with the left over sweet chili sauce to dip in, as cocktail meatballs.

These have become a regular meal in our house. I usually make them just as the recipe states, and I often get compliments on them and requests for this recipe. For a healthier take, we bake at 400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes, flipping once in the middle of the bake time. We dip in sweet chili sauce or hotter chili garlic sauce. Our family loves them, including our 4.5 and 2.5 year olds. Great with Peanut Butter Noodles recipe from this site that we add julienned cuke and carrot too for extra veggies.

I used 1.25 pounds of ground turkey, and subbed dried onions and dried cilantro. Instead of frying these, I baked them in the oven for about 25 minutes at 400 degrees. We ate it with brown rice that had the thai chili sauce mixed into it as well, along with some dried parsley and a few dashes of light soy sauce. Overall, this was delicious and would also make a good meatloaf with sweet and sour sauce.

Spectacular! Thank you "Jensenly" for the great idea to make it into "torpedoes" and stick a skewer in it!! it looks fabulous! I served it along with a thin teriyaki dipping sauce, with minced cilantro and scallions in it! It made a beautiful presentation! I added onion powder, garlic powder, McCormick steak seasoning. I did not need to add an egg as some reviewers have posted. My torpedoes stayed together fine. I drizzled some teriyaki sauce on it before and after i baked it as well. I baked it at 400 for about 20 minutes. Fantastic!

These were yummy.  I shaped them like burgers, which worked very well.  My little secret is to use the Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce from Trader Joe's for the chili sauce if you can... gives them an extra little kick.

This recipe was very good and offered a good spice blend with very exotic flavouring.  I did find that 1 cup of cilantro was too much and used only half.  I also added some salt and 2 fresh garlic clove.  The meatballs did need some dipping sauce because I served them with rice so I followed the sweet chili dipping sauce from another thai recipe in the website (used only 1 TBSP of sugar).  Overall this recipe was fantastic and would definetely do it again.  My kids loved this recipe and asked for seconds!

I used ground chicken breast which was pretty sticky, so I added more breadcrumbs (panko). I also added freshed minced garlic and ginger, red chile flakes and some very hot Thai chile sauce (we like things spicy) I baked these in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes instead of frying, and we were very pleased with the results.  I served them with Thai Vegetable Noodles from this sight. My cat stole a chicken ball and liked it a lot as well. Thanks for the recipe!

i've made these twice now because they're so tasty! i added some pre-minced ginger & pre-chopped garlic (out of a bottle -- i'm busy!) and cut back a bit on the sweet chili sauce (i don't want mine too sweet) and they're just perfect for me. i'm going to try baking them next time like others here have suggested to cut down on the calories. great to snack on while you're working or studying

update: i just can't get enough of these! i even made them with the most budget-looking ground chicken i've ever used (it's all they had), and baked them for 22 minutes at 400 degrees, and they were delicious! i've never had a problem turning them into meatballs, so i don't see the need for an egg (and its extra cholesterol) -- just add or subtract the breadcrumbs based on how moist your ground chicken is. and for more 'zip' -- definitely add the minced garlic and ginger. if you bake these, it's a pretty healthy (and cheap -- great for students & seniors!) recipe. i've  bookmarked it i love it so much!!

Awesome...I did follow the recipe and after frying 1 meatball to do a taste test I wanted more lemon.  I added zest of 1 lemon, squeezed 1/2 the lemon and added 2 Tbls of soy sauce.  This is a unique twist on meatballs if you wanted to serve them as an appetizer.  A huge hit when I served this last week.  Yum- great recipe, thanks for sharing.

These were suprisingly delicious!  I used lime instead of lemon and did not have coriander seed, I used curry, ginger and some garlic for extra flavoring.  I actually browned them in the skillet using sesame oil and then baked them @ 300 for 15-20 mins.  Yummy, severd with rice and veggies.  Something different.

SO GOOD!  I added some ground ginger and garlic powder to these, and baked for about 25 minutes at 400 degrees (drizzled them with olive first, flipped them half way).  Will be making these A LOT!

We weren't impressed. The texture wasn't very pleasant, the cilantro was too much even for us (and we LOVE cilantro), plus the balls needed some kind of sauce (I only had sweet and sour sauce on hand, and I didn't think it would go too well). Ah well...

The flavour was good although the amount of bread crumbs made it too dry for me.  They were also lacking in proper seasoning (salt).  If you try this recipe, cut back on the bread crumbs and fry one Chicken Ball and test for seasoning.  If you want more breadcrumbs then add the rest according to your preferences.  It also lacked in a binding ingredient.  Use an egg yolk.  Avoid the white of the egg as it will become stringy since we are using Chicken as our ingredient.  Frying was a good method however, I also tried baking them in a 350F oven for 15 minutes, shaping my Chicken Balls walnut sized and they were equally as good but less fat.

Okay So I tweaked the recipe to fit my personal taste. I used 1.25 lbs. of ground chicken, 1/4c. cilantro, 2 green onions, 1 tbsp hoisin sauce, 1 tbsp plum sauce, 3 tbsp. of sriracha hot chili sauce, 2 tsp. of adobo seasoning, and 1/2 c. plain bread crumbs. I then fried them until brown. I made a side of rice noodles with Thai Peanut sauce. Oh My let me tell you was my mouth having a party. So Flavorful. I didn't even need a dipping sauce for my chicken balls. I didn't want anything to change the flavor. So good. Loved the Recipe. You can do so many things that fit your personal taste and makes the recipe your own. Thanks For Sharing this Recipe.

I have made this recipe many times except I substituted toasted cumin for the ground coriander seed. I also added a sauce made with mayonnaise and sriracha hot sauce and topped them and put each meatball in a butter lettuce cup. It looked pretty and you just pick up the lettuce cup and eat the whole thing. YUM

I made these for Superbowl dinner yesterday, and they were soooooo good!  I didn't have some of the seasonings so I used Bangkok Blend from Penzey's Spices and it was perfect!  My super-picky family liked them too!

I prepared this recipe according the instructions. But instead of frying them in a skillet, I instead cooked them in a Deep Fryer. Before cooking them, I dipped them in an egg wash and bread crumbs. I served them with white rice and Oriental Dipping Sauce.

The basis for this recipe is really good, however it needs just a bit more kick for my liking. First, I'd add a bit of ginger and garlic and perhaps some chili paste (I'd like it a bit more spicy). Maybe some lemongrass too...I agree that it needs a sauce to go with it - I mixed some sweet chili sauce with some garlic, ginger, soy sauce and fish sauce. I substituted 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs with rice since I can't eat wheat, which make the mixture unable to bind together in balls - so I made patties and baked them on parchment. I also used lime juice instead of the lemon. Overall, a pretty good recipe - after some tinkering, it will be perfect!

I didn't have sweet chili sauce, so I put in a small amount of chili garlic paste.   Served these over zucchini and carrot shreds with Thai peanut sauce and Sriracha sauce on the side.  We liked it a lot.

I've made these so many times and we always love them. My favorite way to prepare is to use less to no bread crumbs (about 1/2 cup just to prevent stickiness), more coriander, had to do dried cilantro once and it was fine, and sometimes I add finely chopped jalapeno.  I put the raw meatballs in a cast iron skillet with about a tablespoon of coconut oil and bake at 425 for 4 minutes, then turn and bake until done.   Super good!

After scouring the reviews, I used ground pork and panko and added shredded carrot and bell pepper for color.  In addition, I added some soy, teriyaki sauce, garlic, cumin and fresh ginger, red pepper flakes.  I normally bake my meatballs but decided to pan fry these so they would achieve a more appetizing color.  I drizzled with a homemade teriyaki sauce and toasted sesame seeds. I guess I altered the recipe a lot but I was pretty pleased with the result.

My fiance liked these a lot, but i didn't care much for them at all. Not enough flavor for my palet. If I was ever to make again, I would add garlic, ginger, seasoned salt, black pepper, and red chili flakes!!!! But thanks for sharing anyways=)

Really tasty recipe! I made a few changes though. I added a bit of chopped garlic and not as much cilantro as is called for. Fried them up in a wok with some oil and then tossed in cooked rice noodles with a pad thai type sauce that I make (fish sauce, red chile sauce, soya sauce, rice vinegar, tamarind paste, and lime) and tossed it all together with some bean sprouts, FABULOUS! Thanks for the great recipe, I'll be keeping this one!

This recipe is awesome!!!  I made these "burger style" for my future in-laws and they loved them. My future sister in-law ate two of them, then came on the website to check out the recipe and hated me when she saw the calories... burger style, try topping these with the Thai Mango Sauce also found on this site. Delicious!

Loved these! I baked them with a little olive oil dabbed on top so they'd still be a little crisp on the outside. Served over steamed brown rice with both the sweet chili thai sauce (from another recipe) and some red chili paste. Delicious!

Loved these!  I put them with Thai Noodles and they were delicious.  I didn't have sweet chili sauce so I used szechuan sauce mixed with a little plum sauce.  I will make these again!  Thanks!

I reviewed this before (in 2009) when I used Heinz chili sauce, because I had no idea that there were Asian chili sauces. I decided to make this again now that I know better and see how we liked it this time. I loved them this time, & will definitely make them again, probably with extra chili sauce and extra scallions. I don't have sweet chili sauce, so I used "chili sauce with garlic" made by the people who make Sriracha. I served them with a napa cabbage salad & this was a very satisfying meal. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious!  I did make a few changes based on reviews and personal preference.  I added about 2 tsp light soy sauce, subbed dried onions for green onions, and subbed fresh chopped thai basil for the cilantro (about half the portion though).  I also finely chopped some chicken breast instead of using packaged ground chicken to reduce the fat, and baked at 400 for 20 minutes as another viewer suggested.  Wonderful, healthy and satisfying!!!

These are fantastic.  I have made them multiple times and have gotten rave reviews.  I made them first without the ginger and minced garlic that others suggested and then again with.  I definitely think they are better with the garlic and ginger added.  I also bake them instead of frying.  Served with sweet chile sauce or soy sauce they are delicious!  They are also very good with a veggie only version of the Thai Noodle Salad also from this site.

My fiance really enjoyed these. I don't much care for cilantro, so I wasn't as big a fan. I added a raw egg to help them stick better. I also opted to cook them in the oven (400 for 15 min.) instead.

These were okay.  A sauce (like others said) would be good.  I made as patties and maybe the appetizer small meatball route would be better.

Delicious!  Made this using some suggestions from other reviewers - used Panko, added fresh, minced ginger and a clove of minced garlic.  Also added two pinches of ground sea salt and bound it all together with egg white.  Fried the meatballs in bacon grease - yes I DID! - they turned out perfectly browned on the outside, moist on the inside, and really tasty.  I will definitely made this recipe again.

I really liked these meatballs and so did my husband.  I expected my daughter (3) to enjoy but she did not, I think it was the cilantro.  I plan to make these again and make her a few without the cilantro.  Was great paired with peanut butter noodles as suggested by another reviewer.

This was ok. I am not used to ground chicken so that may have been part of it. It seemed dry, so we ended up dipping ours into chili sauce and it was much better.

Confession first...I hardly followed the recipe at all but it was a great inspiration.  I used pork sausage instead of chicken;  added garlic, cumin, ginger, onion powder, salt (too much but that's on me), red pepper, black pepper, lime juice, bread crumbs, soy sauce, sweet Thai chili sauce.  I fried the meatballs in a non-stick pan.  For the sauce I mixed crunchy peanut butter, Panda Express Manderin sauce, a splash of soy sauce and a bit of Worsheshire sauce.  It's not the recipe but it was definately inspired by it and thank you, Vivian, for that!

If you bake them, definitely brush olive oil over the top to give them a crisp brown color.  I cooked some without and they looked ugly and raw after they were fully cooked. These were just "okay".  Not sure if I will make them again.

Delicious!  I, too, baked this at 400F for 20min.  It burned quite a bit on the bottom, so I'm gonna try baking them for maybe 15min.  Great taste!  Add chopped water chestnuts would also add great crunch to it.  Will definitely be making this again in the future.

I really liked this recipe.  It was quick and uncomplicated.  i didn't have ground chicken so I used ground turkey instead.  I doubled the recipe and made half with a little less cilantro for my children and half I spiced up for the adults with red pepper flakes.  I used the Taste of Thai Sweet and Sour Chili Sauce to dip and baked them in the oven as some reviewers had suggested.  I will definitely make this one again.

I made this for my lunch this week and they turned out really good.  I added one egg as everyone suggested.  I also fried them in olive oil for a few minutes and then popped them in the oven to finish cooking.  Good recipe - thanks for sharing.

These were tasty and delicious! I added some minced fresh ginger and garlic and one egg to help the meatballs stick better. Also, I used spicy Thai chili garlic sauce. These would be great with some sesame oil dipping sauce. Definitely worth making!

This recipe was excellent although I did make a few mods.  I only had chicken breasts (not ground chicken) so I cooked them and put them in my food processor.  I only used about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the cilantro and it wasn't fresh.  Instead of the sweet chili sauce I used Thai sauce and it gave it some kick and instead of 1/4 of a cup, I put in close to a 1/2 cup (and you could easily add more).  I don't like spicy foods but this definitely gave it some good flavour and for those looking for some heat, just put more in.
Overall, a great recipe, husband and I both rate it as a 10/10.  Thanks!

Yum!  A quick, easy and different dinner dish.  Served with white rice and a little soy sauce on the side.  I did not find it flavorless at all.  The cilnatro was fairly strong and my sweet chili sauce added heat.  Adjustments:
I used 2/3 lb. of gr. chicken, but kept the other measurements the same.
Did not add gr. coriander but did add salt.
For the last 5 minutes, I brushed a 1/2 sweet and sour/ 1/2 hoisin mixture on top.  Also added great flavor.

Also I baked these at 375 for 25 minutes.

These are very tasty. I made 40 balls and baked them at 400 for 20 minutes. Used sweet red chili sauce for dipping. Also good dipped in Newman's Light Sesame Ginger dressing.

These are always a hit!  I use the chile sauce from another allrecipes user.  Just make enough sauce for 12 as it is a great dipping sauce!

After reading the reviews I made a few simple changes and we loved it. I used ground Turkey and about a qtr cup of cilantro. I will make this over and over. I served it with several different sauces.

These were pretty good and healthy to boot. I used all the ingredients listed and followed some suggestions of others to add more flavor and ensure that these meatballs were moist and NOT dry. 

Added -1 tsp of grated ginger, 2 garlic cloves, 1 egg (to bind) and salt and pepper

Substituted lime juice for the lemon (authentic)

Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes rather than fry in oil. Still delicious and healthier. Served with Thai sweet chili fried rice. Thanks so much for the recipe. I loved that we used ground chicken. Also like others I need more tasty ground chicken recipes and this one fits the bill.

Great Recipe!!
My guest loved them!!

I changed the recipe slightly...
Substituting the cilantro for fresh chopped Basil.
I also added one teaspoon of fish sauce,and
A drizzle of honey for a little sweetness.

Served them on a bed of Basmati rice
And sweet peas.

Delish!

I followed the directions and these were very easy to make. While my 3 friends did not ask for the recipe, they had seconds! I will take some of the reviewers comments and amp up the flavor the next time. I left them in the oven too long and they got a little dry. I made a sauce of chicken broth, soy sauce and hoisin sauce , added the sauce and sautéed vegetables to some Pho noodles. Put the meatballs and the noodle mixture in a crockpot for 2 hrs. Until dinner. The moisture from the sauce infused the meatballs-problem solved.

These are fabulous! Served with coconut jasmine rice & hot & sour Chinese eggplant ( another AR  dish).  Will add this to rotation.  Kids loved it too!  Didn't fry them - baked at 350 for 45 minutes. I can't imagine them being any better fried in oil.

Very good! Me and my husband love this.  The only modification I did is I added salt and pepper to taste in the mixture and I cut the cilantro part in half.  After frying, I toss it with the sweet chile sauce, served it with rice and veggies.

Followed the recipe as is! ... and it was very good.  I loved the cilantro/coriander flavor.  I didn't think the cilantro was overpowering at all.  Excellent flavor overall. 

 I do agree with other reviewers that it does need a sauce.  I made a sauce of half Thai Chili Sauce and half Honey Teriyaki sauce.  I added scallions to the sauce too.  The chicken balls then became 5 stars in my book.

This was good, the only thing that was different is that I had to use ground turkey instead of ground chicken because that was what was available at the time. I will most definitely cook these again but with the ground chicken. I made a homemade sweet chile sauce and served this with fried rice. Hubby and the kids really enjoyed them.

Phenomenal! I cut the recipe in half, and instead of the sweet chili sauce I used part Sriracha and part honey (heavier on the Sriracha). SO delicious! My boyfriend loved these meatballs. A definite keeper! Thank you so much for posting.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make it every couple of weeks or so.  I use ground chicken or turkey.  I decrease the bread crumbs by half; one cup is far too much for me.  I don't serve them as appetizers but as a main course.  If I were going to serve as appetizers I would probably add more breadcrumbs to keep them together enough to spear with toothpicks.  I increase the sweet chili sauce to at least 1/2 cup & the lemon juice to 3 tbsps.  I saute in olive oil.  They will fall apart while sauteing if you try to move them before they cook enough.  Good with rice too--sometimes I add a little more chili sauce & lemon juice in the pot after they are done to make them moist enough to serve with brown rice.

Loved these! Made into 4 burgers instead of appy sized balls. Fresh cilantro and  green onions are key. I also love the chili sauce in this....mine was a bit spicy but I loved it and even dipped my burger in some extra. I also scaled this recipe in half and used 1 lb of extra lean ground chicken. Will make again. Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised. I meat was well seasoned even though I did not add any salt or pepper. I had this as an entree with rice but it would better as an appetizer.

Really good. Mixed ground turkey and ground chicken, added about 5 cloves garlic, 1 small onion, a little ginger, cilantro,red pepper flakes and a little smoked chipotle. Formed into torpedos on skewers, brushed a little teryaki mixed with a general tso sauce and cooked at 400 for about 25 min. were fabulous! Served with brown rice and broccoli.

These were very good - moist and tasty.  I served them over brown herb rice with a chunky marinara sauce poured over all of it.

Recipe as written is only a three star recipe. It is very bland and when I pan fried them as a patty, they were too mushy in texture. I fried just one patty to taste it and then I added some fish sauce and a dash of salt and that made a world of difference.  Next time I make it, I'll add an egg and decrease on the bread crumbs and see if that will firm them up. Also, I will probably replace the lemon juice w/ lime juice. Otherwise, I really liked the flavor of this dish!

I don't know if I did something wrong (although it would be a bit difficult because this recipe is so simple), but these were horrible. If it weren't for the cilantro, these wouldn't have had any taste.  I even used WAY less cilantro than recommended (probably half) and they had far, far too much in them.

Pretty good. Made the garbanzo stir fry recipe on this site as its side dish. I simply used chili sauce as a dip instead of adding the sweet chili sauce to the chicken mixture. I also browned the in oil in a sauce pan then baked them for 15 minutes in the oven at 375 degrees

Great, delicious. I used Turkey instead of chicken. I also grilled them instead of frying. I also doubled the Sweet Chili sauce amount. But the rest is the same.

These were very tasty.  I flattened them a bit so they cooked all the way through without getting dried out.  We like cilantro, so I used more than the recipe called for.  Serve with a few lime wedges-- delicious!

I'm glad I decided to use my ground chicken for these yummy balls.  I reduced the green onions and chili sauce because I was also feeding them to my 10 month infant (who liked them!); that left them a bit mild, so if making again I'd follow the recipe quantities.  Oh yeah, and I'd just make burger patties and save all the work of forming and cooking balls!

Yummy is all I can say and I didn't even have cilantro or lemon juice!  I used some green onions instead of cilantro, threw in some fresh garlic and  I rolled the balls in panko breadcrumbs before frying and they were FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS!  Soooo moist and soooo flavourful!  Will definitely make these again=)

This were absolutely wonderful!  The flavor of the Thai chile sauce really made it wonderful.  The grocery was sold out of ground chicken, so I used ground turkey instead, and increased the cilantro & chile sauce a hair.  I think this would make wonderful burgers as well - and use a dab of the Thai chile sauce on top - delicious!

Nothing to write home about. Needed a bit more zip.  I did do the egg and that held it together. It just did not have enough flavor.

the whole family loves these! I halved the recipe to "try" them. My kids are half Thai and we eat alot of authentic Thai dishes so I wasn't sure if they would like these. Next time I will make a double batch because they are already gone! I added a clove of garlic and about 1/2 tsp. of ground Thai hot pepper(we like SPICY!). Served them as a snack/appetizer with more sweet chili sauce for dipping. yum.

I really like the idea of this recipe with some added red chili flakes for the extra kick. 

On a whim, and the fact I ran out of rice, I wrapped the meatballs in thin cabbage (I suppose you can also use lettuce) leaves and dipped them in mild soy sauce, just to balance out the sweetness from the sweet chili sauce. 

It's a really nice appetizer!

The meatballs came out ok. THe texture was not so great and they caould use some last and garlic in the mix. I turned them into a great texmex meal by warming them with salsa and serving them with rice and cheese which was very tasty.

These were pretty good, but needed a lot of sweet chili sauce to accompany. Mine also didn't stick together very well through the frying, so I think next time I'm going to add an egg to bind them, and replace the lemon with lime, which seems like a more authentically thai flavor.

Very Yummy! Made these for a party and they were a hit.  I had to modify a bit but did most of the recipe used less cilantro but actually might try thai basil think that would be good.  Added garlic, hoisen sauce and soy sauce. I also used beef and chicken as I did not have enough chicken on hand to make as many as I wanted to make. Thanks so much!

Well this was just an okay recipe. Not disappointed but not impressed either. I thought the meatballs were really bland. It was definitely missing something.The store bought sauce was delicious and that made the meatballs edible.I made the leftovers into a sweet and sour meatballs type of dish..I sauted some onions and bellpeppers and simmered the whole thing in the sweet chilli sauce. It came out pretty good. I probably wont make this exact recipe again, however i did get some good ideas for my own creation next time. Thanx for the idea.

Followed a lot of the recommendations for spice options to avoid making it too spicy but still have flavor. It was just okay. The suggestion to bake them was good a good one, it worked really well. They needed some sauce, so I made a sauce w/ coconut milk, I added red chili sauce, red curry paste, ginger and a small amt of soy sauce. It was a good addition. I don't think I would make them again.

These burned! I made a test one and it burned right away. Decided to do in the oven, as others have, and they also burned. My sweet Thai chili sauce must have a LOT of sugar in it. I used one pkg of chicken so cut all ingredients by half. They’re currently sitting on the stove over very low heat to try and cook them thru

I used ground turkey and didn't have sweet chili sauce, so substituted sriracha and a bit of honey. Also used lime instead of lemon. I didn't use breadcrumbs as I didn't see the need. Results? Yum!  Definitely will make again.

I didn’t care for this as written because the amount of cilantro is just too high, but that could be my personal taste preference. As written, I’d give it two stars. The only change I initially made was using dried cilantro (scaled down recipe and used 1-1.5 tbsp dried cilantro, which was plenty). All other ingredient amounts I followed accordingly and tested cooking one ball as directed, but it was not holding together well and flavor wise was lacking (might have been fine in baking, turning half way—400F for 20-25 min total cook time is what I would do). I grated in some fresh garlic ginger and a flax egg (I can’t have egg and needed something to help bind this mixture…1 tbsp flax meal to 2.5 tbsp water let rest 5-7 min). Skewered the meatballs and grilled them. With my changes, this was delicious and I served with lightly stir fried red bell pepper and veggie spirals (zucchini and carrot) tossed with a little Thai Sesame Sauce (~1/2 cup); topped off with some chopped cashews.

Okay, I did not like this at all, but to be fair, I made two changes which might have materially affected the taste: I left out the cilantro because my oldest daughter hates it, and I baked them in the oven instead of frying them, because I always prefer meatballs baked over fried. But maybe in this one instance they should have been fried instead. But no one in the family liked them at all and I ended up throwing most of them away.

I will make these again.  They were a hit with my guys.  I used GF bread crumbs and half the amount of cilantro which was more than enough in my opinion.
I also baked these instead of pan frying.

Wonderful! I did make some changes though. I halved the recipe. I substituted some minced yellow onion as I did not have any green onions. I added 1 minced clove of garlic. I substituted almond flour for the bread crumbs and added 1 egg.  I added a little salt and pepper.  I also baked in a 400 degree oven for about 25 minutes, on a parchment lined baking sheet, instead of frying . Wow! this is a keeper for us! Thanks so very much for sharing!

I ground my own chicken meat. A combination of breast and thigh meat. I also used Panko bread crumbs. It was delicious and everyone raved. I would strongly suggest adding salt

Easy to make and a great idea.  I added some ginger and garlic, was liberal with seasonings.  No ground turkey or chicken was available, so used Pork/veal.  They were very yummy as small patties over some rice I had left over from a previous meal.

First recipe I have used from this website that I was disappointed with. The meatballs were tasteless. Had to be very careful they didn’t burn while cooking them. Probably because of the Thai sauce. I followed recipe exact and threw the batch in garbage.

I found these to be very bland. I made a home made sweet chili sauce from another site that saved the day for this dish. It was the only thing that gave it flavor.

I really liked these. Made the recipe exactly, and served over jasmine rice with hoemmade peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  

Only modification I would make next time I will use 2x the sweet chili sauce and maybe a little extra salt.

These are delicious! I substituted panko bread crumbs and lime, and served with a thai cabbage slaw and homemade flat bread, my family loved them!! I made 2 sauces for spreading on the flat breads sour cream,( I added lime, cilantro, little salt and pepper)  and a peanut butter sauce (peanut butter and red chili sauce). Thank you for sharing!!

This is nice twist on chicken. I added a little garlic powder and cayane to kick it up a little. Also I used dried cilantro about half a cup. I formed little patties for dinner then froze the rest to fry up for breakfast!! Great recipe!!

Love thi! I was out of bread crumbs so I substituted crushed crackers. After balls were browned I added my homemade ginger sweet and sour sauce and simmered for about 30 min., while rice was cooking. Flavor so are even better the next day!

I did a trial run of 1/2 recipe. thinking these would be good for a Thanksgiving appetizer.
We gave them a "meh" rating.  WAY too much cilantro, and pretty much flavorless (other than the cilantro), even with using  spicy breadcrumbs and adding some chili tepins.   I fried them and then finished them in the oven to ensure the chicken was thoroughly cooked.
Will need to be served with a sauce of some kind.

These were a huge disappointment.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I baked, rather than fried them.  They were VERY bland.  The first night, I used only half the mixture, in case I wanted to doctor it up for the next meal.  I am so glad I did!  When I made the second batch, I added more soy sauce, sweet red chili sauce, ground ginger and ground garlic.  I also baked it like a meatloaf, instead of making the little balls.  It was still not very flavorful.  I will not be making these again.  However, I do appreciate the recipe.  I love trying new recipes, and realize not everyone has the same tastes.

Yes, I used ground turkey instead of chicken, added 1 egg white, Panko instead of bread crumbs and baked them 400 degrees 20 min. on parchment paper  instead of frying them! Turned out great!!!

These were so juicy and delicious.  I’ll have to make twice as many next time.  I’m going to make these every weekend we bbq. Pretty easy affordable appetizer.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was excellent!  The only change I made is I put 1/2 cup of cilantro instead of a full cup and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I used Presidents Choice Memories of Thailand for the sweet chilli sauce with a little on the side for dipping.  Big hit with the family!

I made these. Had to add lots more Panko. Because I Added more soy and sesame and fish sauce.  Made dipping sauce using soy. Fish sauce. Brown sugar ginger garlic scallions and had no rice wine vinegar left so put in Mirin.  Spectacular. Julienned carrots celery and broccoli rabe cooked in left over sauce.  Made double amount.

Too bland and needs a sauce. Then it would be better. I guess its because I am comparing it to a really tastier version at Frazier Farms Market here in the San Diego area. It just needs a tune up with the spices,  and a sauce and it would be much better.

I made these for Thanksgiving as the recipe stated except I baked instead of fried them. My family did not care for them. They said they were dry, which was my worry whenever I use chicken or turkey in a recipe like this.

Awesome.  I did add some seasoning including 1 tsp salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, and thai garlic chili sauce and used ground turkey.  It would be nice to have a spicy, sweet sauce.

These were the first to be eaten at the party... should have doubled the recipe! I baked them in the oven at 325F instead of deep frying. As with other meatballs, hand rolling is messy so use a small ice cream scoop and then just hand shape.

I made these with ground turkey meat. I added 1 egg but the texture was very soft and they fell apart trying to cook them.  They were tasty but needed a little kick.

This was a great meal, I made this with spicy sriracha instead of sweet chili because my family enjoys spicier foods, I also added minced garlic and red pepper flakes. The chicken balls alone didn't seem like enough so I put them on a Hawaiian Roll and put lettuce and more sriracha on it and they were very good.

Added 1 garlic clove, 1/2 tsp fresh ground ginger. 1/2c cilantro (not 1c). Added 1/4tsp salt. (Other suggested 2Tbs soy sauce)
A bit of olive oil ontop to make crispy when cooking.
Bake: 20-25mins at 400* - flip 1/2 way.

I dipped in home made peanut dipping sauce.
(Might need an egg white to keep together and may need more or less crumbs depending on the chicken)

Can make as a burger or into torpedos on skewers as another suggested.

Next time will try with sweet chilli dipping sauce from this site or a teriyaki dipping sauce.
Will use lemon grass as others suggested (2 sprigs)

Just made a 1/2 batch for my DH after he had been given a fun birthday party at work. 5 stars from him screams volumes! I added minced fresh garlic because everything is better with garlic. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I made these the other night and they where extreme tasty! I used ground turkey instead of chicken because that's what I had. I also read other reviews and made the following changes: I used panko bread crumbs, minced garlic and minced ginger. I also added some crushed pepper flakes and sriracha sauce for some extra spice. I baked my meatballs at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.

Did a few changes to suit our Indian taste.. Added a pinch of turmeric extra and garam for the flavor. And, had some extra fried breadcrumbs to roll on after the balls are deep fried in oil.

I found these to be pretty flavorless.  I did not fry them in oil but baked them in the oven at 350 F for 25 minutes.  I also used ground beef instead of chicken.  They tasted ok, just nothing special.

Good recipe. I followed almost exactly... I ommitted the cilantro, used lime juice instead of lemon and ground turkey instead of chicken, just because that's what I had. I thought it needed some kind of sauce, so I served with plum sauce... which was OK. I then tried just dipping in more of the sweet chili sauce and that was better. I would have given this recipe 5 stars but I thought it was missing a little something, it was a tad bland... I may add hot red pepper flakes or something next time. I plan on making these for a work potluck on Friday. I may try baking them in the oven this time as some reviewers have suggested, rather than frying in oil.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated.
The flavour was okay.
The texture was horrible.
My boyfriend, who will eat anything, threw out the leftovers.

This recipe was a hit with my husband, who is the meat eater (I'm a vegetarian). the cilantro in our herb garden hasn't produced enough to use yet, so I substituted some dried basil and dried bay leaf. I also didn't have any Thai chili sauce, so I substituted tapatillo sauce, since it is made with red chilis. I added a little ginger, and fried in batches in the skillet. I made a sauce from pan drippings, some soy sauce and some more chili sauce.

It smelled so good cooking that I wanted some, so I used the same spice combo on some tofu for me, which I baked after marinating. We served this over some brown rice, and ate some fresh sliced pineapple with it for dessert. It was great! :)

Yummy!  I was looking for a recipe using ground chicken and this is a winner!  I made a few modifications as suggested; I added some freshly minced garlic & ginger, as well as some red pepper flakes.  I baked them at 400 for about 20 minutes.  Great with the sweet chili dipping sauce!
