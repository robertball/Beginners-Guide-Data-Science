I made this following the receipe and it was really good! Ialso made a custom version for me. Insted of canola I used olive oil, low sodium  soy sauce, splenda, omitted the almonds and sunflower seeds. I sprinkled with chow mein noodles and it was awesome. I like this more than the mayo version cole slaw!

Wow, incredible. I made it sugar free using baking Splenda and the entire family loved it. I didnt have time to refrigerate it, so I put the bowel in the freezer while the bison was on the grill and it tastes great.

This is an excellent dressing for a slaw!! We omitted the sunflower seeds (preference) and used half cabbage and half shredded kale from our garden. Wow...I'm sure this will be a new favorite. I think it would also be excellent with cranberries or a tart apple.

Another delicious salad!  I'm on a quest to use all that is in our fridge.  This was a great recipe to use up the half-head of cabbage.  I also used up the last of the carrots by shredding them and adding them to the mix.  I prepared this in the morning, adding the almonds and the sunflower seeds and served it at dinner time.  I did replace the 6 TB of sugar with 4 TB of Stevia and it worked well for our tastes.  This could easily become a main dish meal by adding grilled chicken or shrimp.  I served this with 'Sweet and Spicy Grilled Shrimp' and 'Stuffed Pea Pods', both from AR.  Thanks, Shalvie for sharing your recipe.

I have made this salad 4 times now and only found it this summer. I needed to find some cabbage recipes since I had 8 large heads from my garden.  I took some to my neighbors and she said she doesn't really like cole slaw, but she loved mine. I added apples to one batch, and added carrots from my garden for more color.  I also add crasins. I made some for Thanksgiving yesterday and I just added some leftover turkey to it and it is delicious.  Awesome recipe!

This is an interesting recipe.  I loved the combination of almonds and sunflower kernels with the cabbage.  I cut back the sugar to 3 Tbsp because 6 just seemed way too sweet, and I used closer to 12 oz. shredded cabbage and it was still a very moist salad.  I'd make this again because mayo-based salads are so repetitive, but I may have to keep looking for that perfect vinegar-based salad.

Great and well received.  I reduced the amount of sugar by half and increased the amount of cabbage because the bags held 12 oz. instead of 8.  But there is more than enough dressing still.  I put it in Tupperware and turn it upside down part of the time it is "marinating".  Delicious!

I added match-stick carrots, some chopped celery and celery seed as well as some dill weed. Didn't have green onions, so we used some chopped sweet onion. It really gave it a great flavor. We loved it. This is a definite re-do.

Fast and easy and everyone asks for seconds.  My changes: rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and I use part olive/part sesame oil to give it more flavor and Splenda or Truvia instead of sugar.  Also, I saute the slivered almonds in butter to brown them and make them more crunchy.  Can also add a package of ramen noodles (crushed) to pan and saute til brown for more crunch but we usually leave those out on our low carb diet.  Either way, delish!

Loved this recipe. Next time I will put the nuts and seeds only on what I serve myself because my husband didn't like that part. I am also going to half the dressing because it swam at the bottom of the bowl. Might add dried cranberries too. Great crunch!

Used the only size bag of cabbage available, 16 oz.  Kept the dressing ingredients pretty much the same, though I DID use only 4 1/2 tablespoons of sugar and used rice wine vinegar to use it up.  As a personal preference for a CRISPY crunch instead of merely the crunch given by slivered almonds, I opted for chow mein noodles MIXED IN ONLY PRIOR TO SERVING to keep the integrity of the crispy crunch.  Made in the a.m. for p.m. service.  Delicious!

Followed other reviewers suggestions of less sugar and more slaw mixture and used olive oil. Everyone liked very much so was all eaten. I don’t think it would save too well. Next time I will monitor the amount of dressing to slaw even more. Delicious flavours.

Absolutely loved the taste!  However, two things stood out for us.  First, The amount of dressing this makes is way too much for the amount of cabbage.  I shredded my own and had about twice what the recipe called for, so I was going to double the dressing ingredients.  At the last minute, I did not, and am glad---as is, it was still way too much. Second the ratio of oil to vinegar is too high.  Too much oil in this dressing.  I would think about 70/30 would be better.  30% oil and 70% other liquids.

Yummy! How could it be so easy? Only thing I changed was Splenda instead of sugar. FANTASTIC. Occasionally add some edamame if I have it on hand.

This is an easy, delicious recipe that avoids the fattening ingredients. Like others I substituted olive oil for canola, added 1/8 tsp. sesame oil in the dressing and added chopped green onions, sesame seeds, and sliced almonds to the salad. We also added chopped chicken to make it as meal.

This is much prettier than the photo. I made just a few changes. As suggested, I used only 3 TBS of sugar. I increased the almonds and sunflower seeds to 1/2 cup each and toasted the almonds. I also added 1/2 cup of Cherry Craisins . Will definitely make this often !

This dressing is phenomenal!  I changed it only slightly:  instead of all canola oil, I used half canola oil and the other half substituted  an excellent lime-infused olive oil made locally (Lucero Olive Oil--highly recommend). I similarly substituted in some flavored balsamic in place of part of the red wine vinegar. Since the balsamic adds a lot of sweetness I cut way back to only 3 tbsp of sugar even though I doubled the recipe, and it was exactly sweet enough but not too sweet. I'm going to make another batch of this dressing and keep it on hand for other salads!  Thanks for sharing this :)

It's was. A good alternative to traditional coleslaw specially when you are hosting a cook out and you have guest that won't eat, mayo, yogurt, sour cream , and etc .  I omitted the sunflower seeds and used broccoli slaw mix instead. Otherwise followed the recipe as directed . It's a keeper

So far this is my favorite no mayo slaw recipe and I make it regularly. Really good as written, but I prefer less oil and less sugar - I have the oil down to about 1/8 of a cup and the sugar down to 4 Tbsp.  If it doesn't seem like enough liquid, I'll add more vinegar. These changes are only an attempt to make it healthier, not make it taste better. I usually use 1/2 large head of cabbage. Lately I've been using red cabbage, it looks more appealing than green cabbage - which turns a little brown from the soy.  Have also substituted sweet or yellow onion for the green onions.  The sunflower seeds give nice texture, we add them when serving so they don't get soggy and usually skip the almonds. The salad is good without seeds too. Also great as a sandwich topping. Wonder how this would be with some dried cranberries or cherries!

Delicious but way too much dressing. My husband and I had to drain the dressing off before our BBQ so it looked more like salad and less like soggy cabage. Will definitely make this again just with half the dressing.

Using the shredded cabbage with carrots adds another color to the salad, without really changing the taste. I have occasionally used only almonds or only sunflower seeds because I was out of them and it was still very good. This is a hit at potlucks.

Wanted a lighter coleslaw than a mayo based. Used rice vinegar and tamari. Family said it is a "keeper."

This is a great simple slaw. I used half the dressing for half a large head of cabbage, reduced the sugar a tad and used rice vinegar. Next time I'll add shredded carrots and purple cabbage for color. Would probably also be good with mandarin orange slices.

I added grated broccoli stems as well but you couldn't tell they were in there. This was very very good!

Great recipe! I made a few changes like chopping 1/2 head of cabbage and adding two farmer's market carrots, which I grated with a cheese grater. I also substituted the oil to vegetable and added a dash of both sesame and chile oil for flavor. I cut back on the amount of sugar because I'm not a fan of sweetness, but otherwise absolutely loved this recipe...saved it to my favorites so that I can make it again!

I tried this and used Splenda instead of sugar and apple cider vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar. It was so easy and everyone loved it.

Wow! I started eating this salad even before I finished making it! Very well balanced. I added a little less sugar, about 4 tablespoons, but I guess that is just a minor thing and a matter of taste. Definitely, will make it again. Thank you, Shalvie!

Yum! I thought 6 tablespoons seemed like a lot of sugar, so I cut it back to 4-5 and it was delicious!

Great but needs a little "zip".  Might try adding mirin next time.  Used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  Added shredded carrot.

Love this recipe - I only tweaked a bit...changed the oil to 1/4 cup sesame oil 1/4 cup olive oil, used low sodium soy sauce, 4 splenda not sugar, and added a rotisserie chicken breast. Have this as my lunch all the time! Thank you!

Great! I used red cabbage and olive oil, and added radish and carrot. We ate it in beer battered for fish tacos and it was a hit. I also skipped the nuts as well.
