Very tasty soup! I made a couple of changes because of the ingredients I had available. I used turkey sausage in place of the pork sausage and full-fat coconut cream in place of heavy cream.  I also used garlic salt instead of plain salt as my family loves the garlic flavor. The soup came out very creamy. I will definitely make this again!

This was such an interesting soup!  It compares to nothing we’ve ever had before.  It’s got a nice zing to it, but still manages to be mellow.  The only thing I did differently was to use maple breakfast sausage and low sodium chicken bullion, as that was all I had on hand.  My husband is VERY finicky, and he ate a full crock and came back for more. Thanks for the recipe!

I am not a big fan of pumpkin, so I was kind of leery about this, but it is delicious.  The pumpkin just adds some deeper tones to the soup.  Also love how easy it is to make.

Great fall soup! I doubled the recipe and the family enjoyed it for dinner with leftovers for lunch the next day. My daughter was not crazy about the sage. Next time I may reduce the amount of sage that I add.

I made this with exactly the same recipe, but used a traditional pot on the stove instead of a pressure cooker. It is absolutely delicious. I would eat this even if I were not trying to cut carbs.

This is one of the best soups I’ve made. Absolutely delicious! My family likes sausage so I went ahead and put on the entire pound. So I added some extra pumpkin and broth to make up for it. I will definitely make again.
