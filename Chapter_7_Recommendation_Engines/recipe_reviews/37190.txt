THIS IS FABULOUS!  I made this for a food demo in a large grocery store.  During the 3 hours I made this 4 times!!!  At one point, all my samples were gone in 15 minutes.  People were watching me and trying to memorize my ingredients.  I used dried tarragon and gorgonzola.  Be careful with the sour cream and cheese.  I started off with the full amount but it was too tangy.  Cut sour cream in half and then sprinkled in some gorgonzola.  I'll definitely make this again!

This tasted wonderful but the gray sauce was extremely unappetizing to look at; I had to close my eyes with each bite.  Variations to make this a 5-star delight:
- get rid of the sour cream and just serve the marinated mushrooms on the side;
- brown the filets for 2 min on each side, then move to a 375-degree oven for 10 minutes for a perfect medium-rare;
- replace the tarrogon rub with course salt and pepper.

YUM!  Definitely the best-tasting filet ever...but I reiterate that the gray sauce looks almost too unappetizing to eat.  Omit the sour cream, and proudly serve to guests!

Delicious recipe; keep the sour cream and blue cheese at the recommended amounts. Color was a bit strange but I placed the filet on some grilled Texas toast, then spooned over the sauce and finished with more dried tarragon around the plate to add some color. Knockout presentation and this was for our lunch! Served with the grilled potatoes and onions recipe from this site. Great meal. Used dried French tarragon and a Sonoma Zinfandel for the red wine.

Very delicious, with strong flavors.  The recipe tends to overcook the meat, though, making it tougher than it might be.  Careful not to overcook!

Excellent!  My boyfriend raved about it and he's not a big fan of mushrooms.  I used dried tarragon and it worked perfectly.  I'd definitely make it for guests.

This recipes tasted great.....the presentation was lacking, however. The sauce turned out an odd shade of gray. I used stilton cheese. I would serve this again to my husband, because it tastes heavenly, but I wouldn't serve it to company.

This was the first time I had ever made beef without just broiling it and pouring steak sauce on it . . . I can only say I wish I had tried something new sooner.  Served it to family and everyone raved about how good it was.  I absolutely loved it though I wasn't sure I would because I had never had blue cheese before.   Used red wine, blue cheese and dried tarragon becuase I did not have fresh.  Absolutely delectable!

Wow, this turned out excellent and I didn't even use tenderloin.  I had some very thick sirloin steaks so I browned them as directed and then finished them in a 375 degree oven for 20 mins.  I was afraid they wouldn't be tender, but they turned out great.  I followed all the directions exactly, except I added a splash of Beef Bovril - just for the color, so my sauce was a rich brown shade.

This has become a favorite at our house! I used dried tarragon and 4 oz of blue cheese for a more robust flavor. Nothing but rave reviews!

This recipe was very, very rich -- my husband liked it a lot.  I found it too rich for my tastes.  Next time, I'd probably reduce the amount of sour cream and the cheese.

This was an excellent recipe.  The red wine gives it a great flavor so I wouldn't recommend using the beef broth.  The recipe was very quick and very easy.  The result was a gourmet meal. I got rave reviews for it.  You can find the English Stilton cheese at specialty Delis and fine grocery stores.  I hope others will enjoy this recipe.  I am going to make it again soon.

I foud that using 1/2 red wine and 1/2 demi-glace intensifies the flavor of both the cheese and the meat.

This was very good. The sauce was very flavourful and thickened up nicely. However don't think I will use Tarragon again. The flavour was a bit like Aniseed (which I don't like).

This recipe is foolproof!  I substituted Gorgonzola for the Stilton the second time I prepared it, and it got just as many raves!  If you don't already,I would recommend cutting the gills out of the Portobello's before slicing them.  Otherwise, this is a keeper.

This dish was pretty tasty and quite easy to prepare. It's too bad the presentation isn't better since the color turns out to be like a dark gray. I'll most likely make this again.

This is a delicious recipe and oh so easy!  I am planning for a supper club dinner and will definately use this recipe.  I used the beef broth and went a little light on the blue cheese.  It was very rich and very tasty!  I would love to hear what people are using for their sides dishes!

Beef cooks up well, but the sauce is a little tangy.  I love steak so adding cheese 
is not a plus in my book.  Easy to make, though.
