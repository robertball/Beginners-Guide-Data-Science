I've been a Wisconsinite most of my life (am originally from Minnesota) and while I don't proclaim to be a Beer Cheese Soup expert I do know what I like and I do know what tastes good.  And this is some good soup! Given some of the reviews I had extra flour on hand in case it was too thin, and Velveeta in case it wasn't creamy enough. This needed neither. I wasn't crazy about the cooking method which I believe wasn't as good as it could have been. I didn't like the idea of boiling the vegetables rather than sweating them, and two different mixtures, a "beer mixture" and a "cheese mixture" was totally unnecessary. I sweated the vegetables in the butter for about 10 minutes, added the flour, then cooked that another couple of minutes. Stirred the half and half in gradually, added the beer, chicken broth, mustards and Worcestershire sauce, brought it to a boil and simmered for about 10 minutes, stirring fairly constantly, until creamy and thickened. I removed it from the heat, then stirred in the cheese a little at a time until combined. I garnished each serving with crisp, crumbled bacon which only gave it an extra flavor punch (I swear bacon makes EVERYTHING taste better!). This is creamy, silky smooth, not too cheesy but cheesy enough, and very pleasantly flavored.  Sometimes cheese soups (especially in restaurants) can be gloppy and pasty but this was refreshingly light by comparison. So while the cooking method needed work this still is a solid four star recipe.

The flavor is excellent, but you will have definite texture issues if you follow the instructions as written. Cheese and cream curdle very easily! To prevent the gritty texture many complain about here (and cut down on wasted extra pot to clean), I suggest making the following changes:
1st saute the vegetables in butter until they are tender. Then add the flour and dry mustard, stirring constantly until well mixed. Then add broth, beer, hot sauce, and spices. Cook for about 10 minutes or until warm, and then REDUCE the temperature to medium low. This will prevent curdling when you add your dairy next. Gradually add half and half and simmer for 10-15 minutes to thicken, stirring periodically. DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL as this causes curdling. )Watch carefully, as this can happen quickly.) Then remove the pot from heat and gradually add cheese by small handfuls, stirring constantly. Stir in Dijon and Worcestershire, and put the pot back on to simmer on LOW for about 10 minutes.
The key thing here is to keep the temperature low! Also, adding cheese at the end will prevent it from reacting with the beer, which can also cause it to curdle, especially if it is too hot or cold when added.
By the way, this recipe is great the next day, too. Just remember to reheat it gently!

Against my better judgment, I followed the instructions exactly.  The finely chopped vegetables never got very soft and I cooked them for about 30 minutes.  It smelled great, but the texture was disappointing.  We ended up straining out the vegetables.  I used a bottle of Sam Adams Boston Ale, but it was a little bitter.  I will make this again, but with the following 2 changes.  I will saute the vegetables in butter until they are extremely soft, then I will simmer in the broth and a pale ale.

As is, this soup rates a 5.  It's delicious, relatively simple, and includes my favorite veggies to have in creamy soup.  I've made it a few times, just like the recipe and changed it once, adding diced red pepper, and cumin, along with half pepper jack, garnishing with tortilla strips, for a southwestern thing. Both versions are on semi-regular rotation now! Not only is this a great recipe, but it's a good jumping off point, too. Also, the flavor of the beer really shines through, and dark beers work better (not stouts, but a heavy lager is perfect!).

This Chicagoian knows that any cheesehead recipie is going to be good! It has the right blend of spices.  I used a little different cheese...I used a 2 year aged Wisconsin white cheedar (to make it even more Wisconsin-like). My beer of choice was Blue Moon.  This made for a very warm and fuzzy feeling!  Served with a hot pretzel!

Simple and delicious, earns bonus marks for freezing well. However, I don't recommend putting popcorn on the top - mine turned soggy within moments, so I scooped the pieces out and substituted for croutons instead. Otherwise, no problems! This is a definite keeper.

This is the first beer cheese soup I have tried to make and it turned out great!  I've had differant varieties of it at differant Super Bowl parties over the years and Have always enjoyed it.  The only thing I did a little differant is I grilled some Brats untill well done and smokey then ground them up and put them in the soup.  It was AWESOME!  Go Seahawks!!  Also used a little more cheese + one cup of shredded parmigon chese and a bout 2 bottles of henrys fall lager.

I'm also a Wisconsin native, and have had my share of Beer Cheese Soup around this fair state. This one just didn't do it for me - mainly because it just wasn't rich and creamy. The rest of the family enjoyed it though.

This was a great base recipe, but I followed my instincts and changed a few things around, which made for a successful, delicious and filling soup!!  I used a full stick of butter and divided it.  I put half in my stock pot, let it melt a little, then threw in all my veggies.  I also added two more cloves of garlic.  I omitted the hot sauce (I don't care much for the vinegary flavor of hot sauce), but I liberally sprinkled the veggies with cayenne, a touch of chili powder, paprika, kosher salt and cracked black pepper.  I sauteed them for about 8 mins together.  Then, I sprinkled about a Tbsp of flour across the veggies and allowed that to cook for about 4 or 5 minutes more.  I poured in the beer first, so the flavor could penetrate the veggies, and let the alcohol cook off.  Then I added the stock and a dash or two of worcestershire.  I allowed that mixture to cook for about 30 mins.  In another pan, I melted the other half of a stick of butter.  I used the flower to build a roux and allowed that to brown.  Then, I added the half and half, little by little, incorporating it completely into the roux.  I stirred until smooth and creamy, then slowly added it to the simmering beer mixture.  I added a tsp of dijon mustard, a few more splashes of Worcestershire, about a tsp of dry mustard, cayenne, salt and pepper (if needed).  I let it sit on low, for about 10 more minutes just to let the flavors meld together.  I served with a large crusty baguette and it filled up the family!

I mixed the flour in with the grated cheese before adding it, essentially coating the cheese bits, which allowed for easier blending/melting of the cheese and less need for added fat.  Crumbled bacon or small pieces of cooked sausage are nice additions. Popcorn is a tasty topping, but I served it on the side, so one could add it while eating.

I liked the ingredient list for this soup, and as I always do, read many reviews for helpful tips.  Here are my tweaks to an already excellent soup:

1.  I added a diced red bell pepper (pimento/cheese is a match made in heaven; see "Masters Tournament Pimento Cheese Sandwich".....).
2.  I sauteed my vegetables in the heavy soup stock pot with 3 tablespoons of butter before adding the 2 cups of beer and only 1 cup of chicken stock to gently simmer.
3.  After making the roux in a high-sided saute pan and cooking it for about 5 minutes (stirring constantly with a wire wisk) I added the remaining 2 cups of chicken stock so I could get the roux to a boil.  THIS STEP IS CRITICAL TO FULLY COOKING THE FLOUR, BREAKING IT DOWN PAST ITS "GRAINY" STATE, AND MAXIMIZING THE THICKENING POTENTIAL OF THE ROUX!  Seems quite a few folks have trouble with runny and grainy soup.  Unless you get your roux to a decent boil with some liquid OTHER than milk - which will curdle at boil- then you're missing the boat as far as proper texture of the soup.
4. After boiling/stirring the roux/stock mixture for about 5 minutes, I started adding the milk (whole).

5. After the milk was incorporated, I started adding FINELY SHREDDED cheese a handful at a time.  The fine shred makes the melt process go much, much faster, and you can easily wisk this half of the soup to a velvety texture before adding it to the vegetable/beer mixture.

I make a lot of soups, but this one was the best yet!  A wonderful blend of Wisconsin favorites.  Didn't have dry mustard, so used the mustard you put on hotdogs and it turned out delicious.  Husband raved and craved!

I liked this recipe a lot, though some of my family felt that the beer flavor was too overpowering.  It wasn't as creamy as most beer cheese soups I've had, but still enjoyable.  Make sure you use a very flavorful cheese - I blended extra sharp white cheddar, sharp cheddar and cheddar and it was awesome.

Remade Feb 2016: my cooking skills have improved and this soup was outstanding. New fave.

This recipe warrants five stars, but several changes are needed. The vegetables need to be cooked much longer than stated to ensure that they are soft. Mine were diced quite small, too. Others had complained that their soup was not thick enough. I gave alot of extra time after the half and half was added while whisking at fairly high temperatures to allow the flour to thicken. The consistency of your soup depends upon this. Last, I would add more beer to achieve the desired authentic taste. You don't want to change the consistency, so I will substitute one cup of the chicken broth so I can add another cup of beer next time. The beer was barely noticeable as written and tasted more like a cheese soup. It was very tasty, so despite these changes, the recipe still deserves five stars. I also chose not to garnish with popcorn. Thank you for submitting this.

Very good!  I followed the recipe pretty closely as far as ingredients go, only adding a bit of swiss and an Irish cheddar to the regular cheddar. I took the advice of previous raters and changed up the directions.  I sauteed the carrots, celery, onions and garlic in the butter, then added the broth and let it simmer for 20 minutes.  Then I added the beer.  I mixed the salt, pepper, cayenne, dry mustard and flour together and slowly sprinkled while stirring it into the vegetable-broth-beer-mixture.  Then I reduced the heat and stirred in the half and half, then added the cheese.  I put Tabasco and Sriracha Chili Sauce on the table for guests to add to their own tastes.

My sister mentioned that maybe some of the raters are having difficulty with consistency because they may be using store-bought pre-shredded cheese rather than shredding it themselves.  There could be an anti-caking agent in the pre-shredded cheeses that is causing the cheese not to melt properly.

After I modified the recipe, I thought it was "wonderful" I gave it 5 Stars with the changes. Eliminate the mustard and the Worcestershire. Use two cans of beer, one quart of half and half and the four cups of sharp "finely grated" chedder. I used Wondra Flour and kept adding with a little more half & half until thicker. I also added a little more hot sauce after done to give it a little more zip. I think I added more salt too; salted to my taste. This is as I remember Wisconsin Beer Cheese Soup made at St. Michaels Hosp in Stevens Point, WI. Thanks

this soup is awesome! me and my husband could live on soup in the winter and i looked all over online for a good recipe. i chose this one and another from "taste of home". i pretty-much used this recipe, just left out the hot items and didn't put as much celery. then i added a 1/2 block of cream cheese (i got that part from the other recipe). the 2nd time i made this soup, i added small cubes of yellow potato and i liked it-- seemed more hearty and filling.

I found this recipe on here 3 years ago and have been making it ever since. It's delicious. I have discovered a few things that make it a little easier and a more rounded meal. First, don't use preshredded cheese-the chemicals they put on the preshredded keep it from melting into the mixture smoothly. Second, cook the vegetables much longer than the recipe says, I cook until soft, however long it takes. And last, I add lots of chopped broccoli (and/or cauliflower) and slices of smoked sausage. In addition, I don't care for spicy hot things at all, so I omit the hot pepper sauce and the cayenne pepper - I get a whole lot more of the other flavors this way!

Delicious recipe, but the cooking method as described needs work.  There's no reason this soup should require two pots to fix.  That's just more mess and extra work for such a simple soup.  Rather than following the cooking instructions, I did something similar to other reviewers in that I sauteed the veggies in butter and salt first for about 5 minutes, added the flour and dry seasonings next and cooked the dry mixture for a few minutes before gradually adding the liquid ingredients (plus the pepper and worcestershire sauces) and letting everything simmer for 20 minutes or so before adding the cheese at the very end.  I prefer a smoother texture for my soups, so  I took an immersion blender to the pot right before I added in the cheese.

Apart from that though, this is a terrific recipe.  My family raved about the flavor and the leftovers are delicious too.  The key to getting great results for this soup is to use good cheese.  Don't be lazy and use preshredded cheddar, as the flavor profile and the texture won't be as good than if you had picked up a block of decent cheddar (I used Tillamook, but a good Wisconsin cheese would be fitting!) and grated it yourself.  The result will be so much creamier and the taste so much richer that you won't regret the extra effort!

Paired a nutty brown winter beer with sharp cheddar, and a squeeze of spicy brown mustard since I had no mustard powder. My family loved it. It is a little thin, but very rich, and yes, it does seem like you could more easily add the flour to sautéed veggies and only use one pot as others noted, but I appreciate someone taking the time to share a good recipe so I try to honor the original cook the first time I try a new recipe. Really easy to make, very filling. Slayed my family. My teen actually got all cozy after eating a big bowl and went horizontal right at the table, laid down across two dining chairs. My wife simply kinda went diagonal, resting on one elbow. I just drank the rest of the beer. Yum.

Due to reviews, I made changes. I increased the flour and butter to 1/2 cup each, used 3 cups half and half, 1 cup heavy cream,  and also added 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese and 3 teaspoons chopped pimentos. I also only used a 12oz bottle of Smithwick's beer.  I melted the butter in a Dutch oven on medium heat, added the veggies, salt, pepper and pimentos, turned the heat down to low and put the top on. They gently cooked for 10-12 minutes until soft. Then I increased the temp to medium and added the flour and dry mustard and stirred for about 1 minute. Then slowly I added the broth while whisking until bubbly and thick next I added the half and half, heavy cream and last the beer. I brought it to a boil and stirred in all the rest of the ingredients except cheeses. Next I completely removed the pot from the heat and add the parmesan cheese. I then used my immersion blender to cream the soup. Still off heat, by handfuls I very slowly added 3 cups sharp and 3 cups extra sharp cheddar cheese , whisking the entire time. It turned out thick and creamy with a hint of rich beer. We served it the next day in a crock pot for our Christmas party and it was a HUGE success. I put out croutons and bacon bits to sprinkle on top.

I have made this recipe three times now.  I did mix the cheese up, sharp cheddar, swiss & monteray jack. I don't keep dry mustard, so we use spicy brown only, not the dijon+dry. The first time I made this it seemed to chunky.  I take my hand/stick blender and blend the veggie mix once it is cooked, almost to a puree. A nice dark beer is perfect, we use Smithwicks. We like to serve this with beer bread! Thanks for the great recipe!! It is a keeper.

Make sure to shred block cheese rather than using pre shredded cheese because pre shredded cheese does not melt completely.

I made this to take to a soup "cook off". My mistake to bring a new, un-tried recipe, but it sounded so darn good and got great reviews, so I went with it. Too bad for me! Let me first say that I thought the flavor was FANTASTIC! However, I was very disappointed in the consistency and texture... It just was not creamy enough! Next time I try this I will use more half & half and probably some more cheese and flour. But, as I said, the flavor was "out of this world" delicious, so it's definitely worth making again and playing around with to get the desired creaminess.

Learned a trick with Fondue when dealing with melting cheese in anything and adding powdered spices/thickeners/etc later... don't add it later. Mix the shredded cheese with your powdered stuff in a mixing bowl. THEN add it to your beer/wine/broth. Instead of it being able to clump when you add it, it is stuck to the cheese itself and becomes part of the mix much more smoothly.

Delicous! Followed another reviewer's recommendation to puree the vegetables after they had cooked in the broth for awhile, worked great and made the soup smooth and creamy like I envision cheese soup should be! Reheated well.

This recipe is a keeper.  I halved the recipe because I was preparing this for only two people.  I used half and half which I think resulted in a creamier soup base.  I used a pale lager for the beer.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again.

I made this recipe with technique changes as suggested by another reviewer.  I kept the ingredients the same but sweated the veggies about 10 minutes, then added the flour and browned, then added liquids and remainder of the ingredients except the cheese.  I simmered the soup about ten minutes stirring frequently.  I then removed from the heat and stirred in the cheese a little at a time.  It turned out so smooth and delicious.  I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone in the mood for a great cheese soup!

I make this at home and for my coworkers all the time, we love it.  Here's how I make it.  I use an Alaskan Amber beer, half and half for sure, and for the shredded cheeses I use 3 cups aged sharp cheddar cheese 1 1/2 cups havarti and 1 1/2 cups gruyere cheese (ok probably a little more) and lastly instead of popcorn on top, add fully cooked sliced andouille sausage to add a little more spice and smokey flavor then usually put it in a crock pot to stay warm for work.  Always gets rave reviews!

There's a major flaw with this recipe. It calls for "beer". There are dozens of styles of beer, this recipe needs to be more specific to be successful. I used a homebrewed porter; unfortunately, the beer flavor completely overwhelmed all of the other flavors. This soup would have been a lot tastier with a lighter beer, I wish I had known that before I made a huge pot... disappointing.

My husband and I are HUGE fans of the beer cheese soup you can get at Curly's Pub at Lambeau Field in Green Bay. He is always asking me to make it at home but I can never get the right result, until now. This soup is amazing. Our only issue with it is we are used to our beer cheese soup being much thicker than this soup was. Next time I make it I will try using less chicken broth, which should help the problem. Otherwise, I did not have the issues with the milk or cheese curdling when I added them to the pot. This was actually really easy to make.

Followed the recipe exactly and found it to be just ok.  I've never had beer cheese soup before so i have nothing to compare this to but I can't figure out what all the fuss is about.  It's very much like a cheese sauce with beer.  There's just much better cream soups out there that have better flavor and more substance.

This was delicious!  Only gave it four stars because of the changes I made as a low carber.  I simmered some cauliflower and mashed it up ...used this as the thickener...also add sausaage... I only needed 2 cups of cheese..Nice and creamy and hearty.

Awesome and easy weeknight meal! I did omit the broc like other raters suggested and it was really good! I did sprinkle some wondra on top at the end to help thicken a little more that it was. I also used chicken broth instead of the buillion. Great recipe!

I used the recommendations from Matt H. as far as making the roux and adding a cup of the chicken broth and boiling with the roux. The end result was exactly what I was looking for. Smooth and creamy; not grainy or lumpy. I've made this recipe once before and while it tasted delicious, it was much thinner than versions I've had before. I used two bricks of extra sharp cheddar and it was perfect. Wouldn't change a single thing.

Wonderful soup. I used a light beer, next time I will use a darker one, as the taste of the beer was just discernable. I also blended the vegetables after sauteing them as I like a smooth soup. Lots of popcorn on top!!! Thank you from the dairyland of Minnesota!

Great recipe and super easy to make! Serves up great with a pretzel bread. I didn't have any mustard powder, so I omitted that... did not seem to matter because it was still awesome! The soup base smells a lot of beer, but don't be scared, because it comes together beautifully! I've used different beers every time I've made it, depending on what I have at home, and it's always turned out great. I did fry a couple strips of bacon in the pan and used the drippings to fry the veggies... of course everything is better with bacon! I added the crumbles to the top of the soup before serving. I have made this a couple of times, and it is a great platform to adjust to your liking... Thanks so much Savvyhostess for a great soup!

Great soup, but the dijon mustard was a bit overpowering. Next time I make this, I'll leave it out altogether as it really competes with the other flavors. I knew that I wanted this soup to be creamy and completely smooth, so I sauteed the veggies in butter until they softened, added the chicken broth and simmered until they were very soft. At that point, I used my stick blender and pureed the soup in the pot until very smooth. Then I proceeded with the recipe as directed, using half&half, and being very careful to keep it at a low simmer. I put out crumbled bacon and green onions to top with. This soup was a big hit at a party but had I known how much better this soup is on the second day...I would have made it ahead!

This turned out amazing!  I followed the directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing (though I think crumbled bacon couldn't hurt).  I used a mix of sharp cheddar and sharp white cheddar and the consistency was smooth and creamy.  We had ham sandwiches on the side with jalapeno foccacia bread which was great dipped into the soup.  Others have mentioned that using two pots is unneccesary, but I wonder if getting the cheese and milk mixture together first helps keep it from getting gritty?  Either way, outstanding flavor and a great fall comfort food meal.

This was my first attempt at Beer Cheese Soup and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.  This soup is SO good! I followed the directions exactly except for the beer - I wasn't paying attention and I added two full bottles of AmberBock instead of the recommended 16 oz.  That made the soup a little runny, but was easily remedied by making an additional rue and adding it to the soup along with a little more cheddar. I would not recommend using Velveta to thicken this soup as other reviewers have suggested because I think it would completely change the flavor (which was phenomenal).

This was okay.  Nothing spectacular on flavor.  It got thicker as it kept in the fridge.  I did use an immersion blender before serving so that no one could avoid the veggies in it.

This was really good. I used it as my base recipe and made lots of changes. First of all, I made a much smaller quantity. Didn't measure anything, just eye balled it. I simplified the cooking method by simmering the carrots, onions and celery with about 4 cups of chicken stock and 2 bottles of beer until it was reduced by half (45 mins). Then I added 1 cup half and half and a few tblsp flour. Brought to a boil to thicken, and then added about 3 cups of grated cheddar, and a cup of small broccoli flowerettes. This was delish, I will for sure made it again.

We made this soup for a Packer's party last weekend. It was the hit of the party. It has a good balance between cheesy, beery and veggy flavors.

This was tasty, but I'd prefer a recipe with less carrot. The carrots are good, but I'd prefer a straight up beer cheese soup.

I've had many beers cheese soups and this one gritty texture and overwhelming with mustard.  Disappointing to a Wisconsin cheese lover!

I love this soup!! I used Apricot Ale, which made it all the better. I also added jalapenos to make it more spicey. I will make this again.

Great flavor! I prefer a smoother beer cheese soup, so I blended the leftovers. I used to work at a restaurant that served beer cheese soup--I don't know how authentic it was, but it's what I'll be aiming for next time I make this: I'll reduce the broth to make the soup thicker, omit the celery and carrot, and add diced potatoes. I found this separates quite a bit and doesn't make the best leftovers, so I'd suggest making enough for one, maybe two nights.

I made this tonight.  It was DELICIOUS!!!!  It took a little longer for me to thicken than the recipe called for and I even used half and half vs. milk,  but in time it did thicken.  Once I mixed everything together, I fired up the burner and got it to a boil and then reduced it to a simmer and it did thicken.  It was to die for.  I made a couple changes to the original recipe as well.  I diced up two russet potatoes into the mix.  Made a great addition and I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow with all those added potato starches :)  I also fried up some bacon in a separate frying pan to crumble on top of the finished product, but before I dished up the soup, I added a few TBSP of the bacon grease right into the soup.  It was very good!!!  Oh and I tripled the hot sauce as well cause I love the hot sauce!  I definitely recommend this recipe if you are looking for something cheesy and hearty for a nice fall day.  Was great for Sunday football.  I didn't try the popcorn on top, but the bacon was awesome!!!!

In the recipes defense, I had been craving this for a couple of weeks so maybe my expectations were just too high but it didn't do it for me and I no longer crave it.

Dicing the vegetables isn't enough, unless you like chunks in your beer cheese soup. I made a puree of them and then sauteed them for about 5-7 minutes. Also, it tastes better if you add another cheese beside cheddar, like parmesan or monterey jack. Overall though, it was very good.

This is pretty good, but I think it's a touch bland, honestly. I'm not really sure what it needs. It just tastes like beer. Anyway, I halved the recipe and used Budweiser's American Ale, which my parents gave me. I probably wouldn't buy the stuff on my own, but it's alright. I used the exact same ingredients, but I changed the method to make it easier. Instead of using two different pans, I just sauteed the aromatics in the butter; then, when they were getting soft, I added the flour and mixed it into a paste with the veggies. I then added the liquids, brought the liquid up to a boil, then brought it back to a simmer to add the cheese. After the cheese was melted and incorporated, I let the pot simmer for about ten minutes just to make sure the veggies were soft. A lot easier than dirtying two pans!

We have a restaurant near our house with excellent beer cheese soup.  My son and I "tweaked" this recipe.  It turned out fantastic.  I did saute the vegetables to almost done.  When making for 8 servings, we added about 1/3 c flour to the shredded cheese to make the soup a little more thicker.  My son also added a tad more beer.  We also added a pinch of nutmeg.  We'll definately make this soup again.

My husband and I thought this was very good.  For texture reasons, we decided to puree the vegetables/beer/chicken broth mixture once the vegetables were tender (and we did it in a blender instead of a food processor so it would be smoother).  Because my husband does not handle any form of heat (i.e. pepper, etc.) we did not add the peppersauce or cayenne).  We appreciated that the texture of this soup was not like a velveeta-thick soup; it was brothy yet had a great cheddar flavor.  Will definitely make regularly.

This was my first attempt making beer cheese soup, and it turned out great!  I agree, the texture isn't as rich and creamy as other recipes, but I was still satisfied.  I made the mistake of using Labatt Blue (it's what I had on hand), so the beer flavor was almost non-existant.  I'll definitely be trying a stout my next time around.

We were looking for a soup that might mimic one at a nearby restaurant.  This wasn't quite the same, but was still very good.  I wasn't up for dirtying multiple pans, so I sautéed the veggies in butter in the stock pot, and then scooped them out in to a bowl while I made the roux.  Once the roux was browned, added in the milk/half-and-half (I used 2 cups of each) and then put everything else together.  The main thing I would change next time would be to use less broth.  After simmering for at least a half hour, it was still much thinner than we would have liked.  I might also puree some or most of the veggies after sautéing them to keep the consistency a little silkier.  The flavor, however, was great!  (And I used some Boulevard Wheat for my beer; it was perfect.)

Yum! This soup turned out thick & flavorful for me. I took everyone else's advice & sauteed the veggies in the butter first thing. I then added the flour & made a nice roux. I gradually added the broth, beer & other ingredients (except the dairy). I simmered it all for about 20 min, then added the milk & cheese, stirring constantly at med heat. It thickened up nicely & was fantastic w/nice fresh rolls!

I am a former Wisconsin native, too, and really love a good beer cheese soup.  This recipe was excellent.  I was worried, however, that the carrots & celery would be undercooked and make the soup too chunky, so I boiled them until about three-quarters-soft.  I also sauteed the onions in butter & olive oil along with some bacon until they were tender.  Cooled all the veggies then put them in a food processor until they were "bits and pieces".  (I had also added the hot pepper sauce, cayenne, Worcestershire, dry mustard, salt and pepper into the food processor.)  I added the seasoned vegetable mixture to a saucepan along with the beer (Miller Lite, of course - it's either that or Leine's!) and reduced sodium chicken broth.  Boiled that mixture up while working on the flour/butter/half & half.  It seemed to be easier to make each of these components separately, and the soup turned out brilliantly.  I let it simmer a lot longer, probably about 30 minutes, to thicken and let that delicious aroma permeate my kitchen.  Delicious!

Super easy to make and scrumptious. Being a Wisconsinite I naturally added a bit more cheese. I also added a little bit of Red Hot Buffalo sauce in addition to the regular hot sauce, gave it a bit more zing. We used New Glarus Spotted Cow for the beer, worked really well! Next time might add some cooked brats for even more of a Wisco vibe

Very rich and delicious.  The only changes I made to this recipe was omit the dry mustard since I didn't have any on hand & to puree the veggies (since my family doesn't like diced or chunk veggies in their beer cheese soup).  Served with popcorn for first serving and croutons on top for second serving.  The popcorn won out! :-).

I've heard my Wisconsin-born fiancée rave over beer cheese soup made by a friend, and I was very much looking forward to trying this recipe when I found it. Even though I added 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper instead of following the directions, it still seemed extremely bland to me considering how much liquid there is. I was very disappointed with this recipe. It needed to be much thicker and creamier.

As a Wisconsin native, I was so excited to see this recipe and made it for the Super Bowl.  My entire family was extremely disappointed.  It was not creamy at all and the taste was rather bitter which probably was as much a result of the type of beer used.  I could have overcome that if the texture was creamy and thicker.  Won't make this one again!

Everyone loved it!  I used a brown ale. I simmered the vegetables until they were soft like I like them.  We will make this again.

I just finished making this soup for the Super Bowl. It tastes great although I have nothing to compare it to.  It could use a little more beer flavor so next time I think I will add more beer and less chicken stock.  We'll see how the party likes it.

Very good! Thinner than I thought it would be or I would have given it a 5. I used the ingredients as written, but made in one pot: sweated the veggies in the butter until tender, added broth until hot, then milk till hot, then the flour tossed with cheese so I wouldn't get lumps in the soup. Beer and last seasonings at the end. Next time I will add less broth or some instant mashed potatoes to thicken it.

This recipe got amazing reviews from my family. I was one they told me I should definaely make again. It is important to follow the directions. Although i did good my veggies longer than stated and it took a lot longer than i thought for the milk to thicken but give it time and be sure to mix the cheese into the thickened milk mixture. I got mixed reviews with using popcorn to garnish, some people really like it while others did care for it.... Overall great recipe!!

This soup was fantastic!  I agree that the veggies need to be cooked a little longer.  I like cheese soup think so I only used 4 cups of cheese instead of 6 and it was still rich and flavorful.  This soup was a little thin, which is exactly how I like cheese soup.  I don't like to feel like I'm eating a spoon full of nacho cheese.  I used an amber beer for a richer beer flavor.  This is the best soup I've ever made!

I loved the result, and my SUPER PICKY 4 year old is enjoying the lefovers as cheese sauce for Mac and cheese. I did follow one reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the vegies in the butter, then added flour, then broth and beer, simmered, then added milk and cheese.

Good. I used frozen veggies to save some time. Good mix of flavors. Used Summit Extra Pale since I wanted to tone down the beer flavor.

We loved this recipe.  My husband wanted me to try a sausage beer cheese soup, so I used this recipe with modifications, following the recipe for 6 servings.  I ran out of cheddar so I added 1/2c of velveeta.  I omitted the celery but added ground sausage, which I browned with the veggies.  Veggies came out crisp tender, which was perfect.  I used shredded carrots instead of diced carrots.  For the beer, I went with Sam Adams boston lager.  The flavor and texture was great.  A week later and I'm still thinking about it, wishing we had more!

The kids thought the beer flavor was too strong. They are far from being picky eaters so this won't make it into our regular rotation. I'd suggest adding some bacon to add some additional flavor and maybe cutting back on the beer. Overall, I enjoyed it as did my husband.

This recipe rocks!  I love beer cheese soup and I am very picky and I only like to spend time cooking recipes that are really good and this one is worth it!  I improvised with cheddar/monteray jack cheese (& even added a little extra at the end) and I didn't have any dijon mustard so I used regular and added 1/2 teaspoonful of horseradish and I used all half and half instead of milk.

I made this recipe a couple times, last time I used a dark red local ale. The flavor was great! I also grilled some bratwurst and diced it up. The sausage added a great flavor and texture. Will make this again and again.

This soup was excellent.  I opted for a 12 ounce bottle of pale ale - it is important to use quality alcohol in any recipe. I also used 2 cups of fat free half and half, and 2 cups of milk.  And I added in about 2 cups of diced peppered ham.  Delicious.

On an ongoing search for the most amazing beer cheese soup.... and this wasn't it.  We love beer cheese soup whenever we can get it out.  Trying to limit eating out so want to recreate our favorites at home.  First, this recipe when followed exactly is WAY to watery.  Four cups of milk and/or half and half (we used 2 cups of each) is far more then what is needed.  Should have stopped at one, maybe 2 cups.  I also used an inversion blender but even with that, the soup was too grainy.  Did not have the rich flavor or consistency of a real beer cheese soup so I was very disappointed.  Off to find another recipe to try I guess.

Giving it 4 stars because the end result was amazing but the recipe instructions are convoluted and needlessly complicated.   Instead of dirtying two pots and making a roux that is completely unnecessary, sautee all the veggies in the butter until tender then add the flour and stir until the veggies are covered in a paste. Add all of the remaining ingredients, except for the milk and cheese and simmer for 10 minutes to combine the flavors. Lower heat until soup is barely at a simmer or not at all, and slowly add milk. Remove from heat and stir in cheese. Check temperature and only put back on very low heat if the cheese has lowered the temperature of the soup too much.   The end result was an amazingly flavorful soup that was creamy and full of tender veggies.

I just kind of eyeballed ingredients but followed it fairly closely, just in a different order. After sauteing the veggies, I added the flour there and cooked it for 2 minutes, then added the broth. After all was soft, I used my immersion blender to smooth it out, then added in some diced cooked taters. Adding milk and cheese at the end. Very good.

I'm a Wisconsin girl, born and raised, and I liked this soup a lot. It's not the best Beer Cheese Soup I've ever had, but it was pretty close to right. I did as others have suggested and made mine all in one pot, and sweated the veggies until they were VERY soft. I used a good sharp Wisconsin cheddar and one of my favorite Wisconsin beers - Ale Asylum's Ambergeddon - and the flavors really shone through. I skipped the popcorn entirely though, since I always prefer a soft pretzel with my Beer Cheese Soup.

I have made this recipe before amd its so good. It reminds me of the beer cheese soup I've had when I was a kid in North Dakota. Thanks for sharing it. I do make a small change though, before I add the beer mixture to the cheese mixture I purree it so it makes for a very smooth beer cheese soup. Super delicious!

it was very good.  I used 1/2 sharp and 1/2 extra sharp cheese.  I put a few home made croutons on top.   To the person that said her vegetables were not soft after a half hour--that doesn't seem possible unless your stove was set at the lowest possible setting the entire time.  I cooked the vegetables for about 7 minutes before adding the the other ingredients and they were softened nicely.  This is my usual routine for cooking the onion, celery, carrot combo for any soup/stew.

I've made this recipe several times and it just gets better each time.  I do the veggies/beer/chicken stock in their own pot and make the rue/milk/cheese mixture in a separate pot with all of the spices.  I mix the two and then I put it in the blender until it is velvety smooth.  I think the two key things are 1. good beer (I use Spotted Cow) and 2.  Pureeing in the blender for a creamy, smooth texture.

This soup is full of flavor.  I make with Guinness for a bold flavor.  The only reason that I didn't give it four stars is because it does have a slightly grainy texture that Beer Cheese Soup I've ordered at restaurants doesn't have.  But I've made the recipe three times, so that's not enough to discourage me from eating it!

The veggies didn't soften and the flavor wasn't that great. I even used Spotted Cow. We have a local restaurant in town that has the best cheese soup, and it looks like we'll be going there to render our craving.

Born and raised in WI and I have had many different types of beer cheese soup- all being delish! I followed the recipe to a "T" and Im not really digging it. Its not thick enough and the veggies never got soft (And I simmered them for 10 min longer than the recipe said to.) I wouldn't use this recipe again.

I don't even know what I did with this recipe!  I followed the ingredients of the original recipe, however I followed the directions of another reviewers'.  It was just ok for me, it was fun to make though!!  I agree with another reviewer that it's missing something and that something is meat!  Maybe I'll add brats or polish sausage next time.  My husband also thinks I need to cut down on the fat and calorie content, this recipe didn't help with that!!!

**UPDATE** So I only gave this 3 stars with the original recipe, but what I did with the left overs is a 5 star!!!!  I boiled up some potatoes and mixed them in with the soup and made BEER CHEESE MASHED POTATOES!!!!  I know it sounds weird, but I dare you to try it!!!  Awesome!!!!

I thought the soup tasted very good when first made.  It doesn't reheat well, so next time I will cut recipe in half or thirds so I don't have any leftovers.

I have had beer cheese soup at The Flying Saucer in Nashville, TN.  Needless to say, it was okay.  I could tell it was missing something!  I decided to give it another try when I was preparing a 'man' themed dinner for my husband.  I cooked this without the carrots and celery.  Also, I substituted the dry mustard with table mustard (because I didn't have a mustard spice etc.).    My husband KEEPS requesting me to make this again!!!  It was the BEST CHEESE SOUP EVER.  Perfectly spiced and amazing.  I am going to make home-made pretzels the next time I make this delicious soup.

The beer flavor was too strong for me and didn't seem to belong.  I enjoy beer and used a relatively mild-tasting Miller Lite for this recipe.  Sorry, I won't be making this again.

I agree with the other reviews; the vegetables need to be sweated until they are tender. I used a sieve to get rid of all the uncooked vegetables. I thought the flavor of the soup was good.

You HAVE to be kidding me! This was AWESOME soup! It could have been the cheese we used (smokey cheddar and some habanero cheddar. Light beer cuz that's what we had. I cooked this low and slow and changed up the order of the directions. It was a wonderful recipe...thank you so much!

I made this on St. Pats day and it disappeared!  Even one of my friends who cooks at a local restaurant/bar wanted the recipe so she could make it at the bar.  My wife beat me to the 3/4 cup that was leftover the next day.

I thought that this recipe was great, my SO on the other hand gave it a 3 so we'll average it to a 4. The beer flavor really does come through. I agree with those who said don't add the popcorn until the last second because it melts right in to the soup (but does give it a nice crunch). I also cooked everything in one pan softening the veggies first as suggested by others.  Very good. I'm freezing half of this, so we'll see how it reheats. Thanks for the recipe:)

I found this exact recipe in a local grocer's magazine. My problem: I had never made a cream/cheese based soup before....I added the cheese way too fast and in too hot of a pot, and turned my soup very very gritty. Note: after the roux is made (flour and butter mixture), remove from heat and allow the pot to cool for awhile, then add the cheese just a little at a time and stir. I made mine with Grain Belt Nordeast (the best beer out there in my opinion) and it was delicious....despite the gritty texture...this is a GREAT recipe and I will definetely try again!

The flavor here was on the money.  I used Sierra Nevada porter for the beer, as I was seeking a strong beer flavor.  I skipped the hot sauce, but used a little extra cayenne.  TOTALLY recommend using an immersion blender to get a smooth consistency. I sauteed the trinity (and a bay leaf) in the butter, then added the flour and dry mustard, THEN added the beer and broth.  Just seemed easier that way.  Regardless how you make it, the flavors here are great.  Highly recommend.  Can't wait to show it off at work on Monday!  THANK YOU!

This soup had a great flavor, but wasn't as smooth and creamy as I would of liked it. I did use a immersion blender to try smooth it out a bit, but it still was a little on the chunky side. I left out the dijon, used just 1 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce, and used vegetable stock instead of chicken. We used a local oatmeal stout that worked very well in this soup. Thanks for the great recipe I will be making it again, but maybe using less vegetables next time to make it smoother.

This soup was outstanding (not a calorie in it, of course). I followed the instructions exactly. The beer I used was Alaskan White. I made this soup for the Super Bowl party. Everyone loved it. Not a drop was left by the end of the party. Everyone thought it was funny to put popcorn in the soup, but we all did it anyway. A good time was had by all, and the Wisconsin team won.

Absolutely delicious.  I cooked the veggies in butter instead of simmering in broth.  I also used a mix of colby jack, a bit of leftover Velveeta from a previous meal, and Pinconning.  Used Guinness beer.  This is my go-to beer cheese soup recipe.

Awesome!  I used dark beer, sharp white cheddar and regular sharp cheddar, veggie stock, and extra salt, it really needed the salt for some reason.  I used my hand blender to make it smooth and served it with beer bread.  My southerner hubby loved it, I will mae it again!

I didn't really care for the texture of the soup or the flavor from the sharp cheddar cheese.  I could have thrown the soup in the food processor to thin it out a bit.

This soup is *amazing*!  I added more garlic and less carrot/celery/onion.  I also pureed the veggies a little with a hand blender... they came out the perfect texture!  I used Stone IPA and Cabot Extra Sharp cheddar.  Super tasty!

I made this for my friend's Oktoberfest party and it got rave reviews. As I didn't want chunky vegetables in the soup, I used a stick blender after cooking the veggies to puree. I also added probably a teaspoon or two of cider vinegar as I didn't find that the sharp cheese I used was quite sharp enough. Finally, I found that the flavor benefitted greatly from sitting overnight in the fridge. Yummy!

This was a good recipe, I loved the subtle spiciness.  I did make a few changes to it: I used vegetable broth rather than chicken and omitted the worcestershire sauce (I am a vegetarian so I just upped the salt a bit); I also ran the broth/veggie mix through the blender to incorporate the veggies better before adding the cheese mixture; I used a pound of Velveeta cheese rather than sharp cheddar & finally I added a bit more beer at the end of cooking because I found the flavor disappeared somewhat when adding it right near the beginning.

This is a fantastic soup!  I followed the recipe except that I sauteed the veggies first, then added the broth and beer.  Because I like a smooth soup I pureed this mixture after it was through cooking.   I used Rickards Red for the beer and it gave it a wonderful taste.  Also used a high quality aged cheddar and it was worth it!  Soooo rich and delicious!!

WOW.  This was yum.  I understand that some people may think a dark beer is not to their liking (Some people just dont like dark beer.)  And, there are some people who would taint the fine bouquet of a good cheddar with Velveeta.  (Shame.)  But, I liked it just the way it was and so did the other 26 people I fed it to.  (Wasn't a drop left, infact one guy was putting away the pan and licking it all the way there!)  Great Recipe.  When the soup outshines the main meal you know you got a winner!  ..... and on a side note, cut up ham would really make this a *meal*.

As a lifelong resident of Wisconsin, this soup passed the test.  Much better than boxed versions, and still easy to make.  Skipped the popcorn though and just added crackers.  Also used high life light for the beer, because that is what I had on hand and still tasted great.

My family is picky about vegetables, so I omitted them, and it was still excellent. I wanted a thicker soup so added 1/3 C. flour and 2 extra cups of shredded cheese - it turned out perfect. Other cheese soups I've tried have been lumpy, but this one has great smooth texture. Even my 9 year old loved it!

I've never made soup with beer before.  It was interesting, but I felt as if the beer overpowered the dish.  I might make this again, but I would cut the beer in half.  Also, because of the reviews regarding texture, I pureed my broth/veggie mixture for something smoother.

I've never had this before and it was pretty good! I followed the recipe to a "T". The flavor of carrot was a little overwhelming. Next time, I would half the carrots and maybe add some finely chopped broccoli. The beer and the cheese make a really interesting flavor together! Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome recipe. I have to admit though, I added 1 lb. of sausage to the recipe. Turned out fantastic. Would have been great even without the sausage, but the sausage made it even better. Will make again, with sausage as it turned our incredible. Thanks for the recipe.

I think this recipe is fantastic!  For a vegetarian version, simply substitute the chicken broth for veggie broth and use vegetarian Worcestershire sauce.  
I enjoy the texture of the carrots, celery and onions, but they could easily be blended or pureed before adding the cheese if texture is a problem. 
I use Fat Tire, our local micro brew beer.  It imparts a nice strong beer taste in the final product.
Also, here in Colorado we like it a little spicy, so it can't hurt to add a some extra hot sauce or cayenne!

, that's some good soup.  I've been on a quest to find a good beer cheese soup for the last few years, but unfortunately it's just not a common soup in restaurants.  So I finally decided to make some.  I was happy to find a good looking recipe that uses real cheese instead of Cheese-whiz (seriously, I can't believe some recipes use that ) or Velveeta (*hork*).  The resulting consistency isn't as smooth as a recipe with "cheese product", but the very good taste of this recipe makes up for any less-than-smoothness.  

For beer I used 1 c. bitter, and 1 c. stout and wound up adding about 3 tsp total of hot pepper sauce for a nice little zing.  This soup is very good with a nice heavy rye bread too.

Kudos to the developer of this recipe, and thank you.

I followed the recipe exactly, and agree the veggies need to cook longer. Also, I was disappointed that the texture was grainy. The flavor was great however, so I might try this again using half and half or one of the other suggestions posted.

Really tasty, couldn't stop eating it! We used budweiser beer and used half the recommended amount b/c other reviews thought it was too strong, but we couldn't taste the beer at all. We also subbed sour cream and chicken broth for the milk. Delicious!  ** Just made this for the second time. So tasty! Made it with the amount of beer in the recipe but still didn't taste too much like 'beer' to me!
*** Third times a charm! Still delicious!!!!!

I made this on 1/5/07 and I loved it, so did my husband..one thing I will do next time is let the veggies cook a tad longer before adding the broth, and then letting it cook a bit more.. the carrots were still a bit hard, but it was good I will make this again

I liked it, my hubby and stepson didn't unfortunately. I added bacon to mine (along w/the bacon drippings) for a little more flavor. And I made it w/my hubby's homemade porter - yum! If I were to make again, I would strain the celery and carrots out, I think.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is delicious! Instead of adding carrots and celery, we added broccoli because that's what we had on hand. We used sweet & spicy mustard as well as whiskey mustard along with a couple of different kinds of cheddar cheese and nut brown ale. Turned out great - we even loved the popcorn (don't knock it until you try it!)

I tripled the cheese, doubled the beer, and still couldn't taste either.  
Look for something with a LOT less liquid.

I wish this had a stronger cheese flavor.  It's good, just not over the top. 
Changes:
I rough chopped the onion, celery, carrots, and added a red pepper.  I roasted those in the oven with the garlic.  
I heated the chicken broth in one pan.  I peeled the peppers and added the vegetables to the broth.  I also added the hot sauce, mustards and Worcestershire to the broth.
In the soup pan I put the flour and butter, made a roux and added the beer (Budweiser) and added the cheese..  when the cheese melted I added the half and half.
Then poured the broth and vegetables to the blender and whirred that up. I then added this to the cheese.  I don't have any texture issues.
I'm making pretzels to go with it.  
I bought 2 pounds of extra sharp cheddar and grated it before adding.

This was fine. Nothing to get too excited about. Out of 6 people only 1 really enjoyed it. Won't make again.

Life long Wisconsinite here! Recently tried beer cheese soup at a restaurant and was hooked!  This was great, not too thick.  Also liked the use of light beer versus an ale.  I might use less or even omit the hot sauce next time, just didnt feel like it needed it.  My three year old even enjoyed it!

Very good, but I would sauté the vegetables in butter first. I followed the directions exactly and my vegetables were crunchy. I strained my vegetables and blended them in my ninja and added them back to the soup. I also found the flavor a bit bland so I added extra chicken base and some grated Havarti cheese. Next time I will try adding craft beer instead of the light beer I used for a little more flavor as well. A great recipe and I will make it again! Thank you! :)

This was an excellent fall meal!  I decided to add a few sliced potatoes and also made used the Instant Pot to make it all but the cheese sauce.  I didn’t have pretzels but some French bread was a good substitute.

I mixed up the recipe a little. I didnt use celery, mustard instead of dijon, no popcorn and evaporated milk instead of regular milk and it turned out wonderful. It was very thick but it cooked down and made enough for my entire family and leftovers! Absolutely delicious recipe.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe.  I had to use corn starch for thickening since I had no flour.  It still tasted wonderful.  I used a lager beer but next time I will use a stronger beer because I like the beer taste in the soup.

I made this for dinner and we were incredibly disappointed.  The soup was runny and had a terrible after taste, we felt.   I'm by no means a novice cook and followed the recipe, bought quality products to make it, but we neither one could even finish a bowl.  In fact, the entire batch went in the trash.  (I was going to offer some to our bachelor neighbor, but my husband said not to if we wanted to remains friends with him.) We love a good cheese beer soup, and unfortunately didn't feel this was anywhere near that.

The texture of the veggies is strange to me. I recommend using an immersion blender! It ends up very creamy with good flavor and texture.

I added 2 cups of onions that I first chopped up in the food processor then I chopped them up even more in the ninja. I used 1/2 amount of carrots and celery.
Frank's hot sauce 2 tsp

I used extra extra sharp cheddar and extra sharp farm cheddar about 6 cups and some (1 cup) regaular sharp cheddar shredded.

I used regular Miller beer (not Miller lite)

It was very tastey. This is a very good beer cheese soup recipe, give it a try and use good, good cheese. I have also used a Sierra Nevada Torpedo beet for the high flavor with good results.

This turned out great. I used 4 medium carrots, 4 celery stalks, and 1.5 medium onions for the mirepoix mixture, in case like me you don’t want to measure by cup. I also followed the one-pot method described in a few of the comments. For cheese, I split roughly 50/50 between a maple smoked white cheddar and extra sharp yellow cheddar. Served garnished with green onions and alongside some kaiser rolls from a local German bakery.

Ingrediants are just right.  Suggestions, use mild chedder and dark beer like Guinness.  I used an emulsion mixer on the beer and veggy part.  I then melted the cheese in the mixture, then the milk.  If it needs to be thickened, stir in some roux.

Made it with all organic products following the recipe exactly.  The soup was fabulous but the popcorn was a negative.   Rating the soup as a 5 but will not add popcorn again.

Guinness is a great choice for this, with the added bonus of having three cans leftover. So it’s a win-win. We also crumble bacon on top.

I made this in my 6 Qt electric pressure cooker.  First I sauteed some RED and yellow onions/celery/garlic in olive oil in the cooker, & LEFT OUT the carrots.  Then added to the cooker the diced potatoes,  spices, mustard, 12oz dark ale beer & some veg broth [made with "Better Than Bouillon" vegetable paste] to cover the potatoes.  Pressure cooked on high for 7 minutes, then let it sit to allow "natural released" of the steam [about 10 min- at which time the potatoes are continuing to cook down].  Uncovered the cooker and then I added the stove-top cheese sauce made with half the milk, adding 1/2c milk-free sour cream to compensate.  Pureed with hand mixer wand in pressure cooker and topped bowls of soup with crisp bacon, and thinly sliced green onion tops. Skipped the popcorn, not my favorite.
I would make this again with my adaptations, in the pressure cooker... it is so much faster and flavors are intensified.

I love it! The texture is perfect and I used a local IPA. I imagine the complaints about thickness come from one of two places: using skim, 1% or 2% milk and/or not allowing it to thicken before adding the cheese. I used 2c 2% and 2c 1/2 & 1/2. It’s absolutely perfect. Of course, I let it thicken also.

Amazing recipe!! Only change I made was I added some smoked sausage links  that I first boiled in beer for extra flavor. I also made the roux with the chicken broth instead of milk, but did everything else the same. My whole extended family (even kids) loved it!!

These was a really good beer cheese soup. Exactly what we had hoped for. A few days after making it we seasoned ground beef and added it to the left over soup for cheeseburger soup and it was amazing again!

Very good flavor.  I actually liked the flavor a little better before I added the Worcester sauce and Dijon.  I might cut the Worcester down a little.  I followed Pauline's suggestions on how to combine the ingredients to get a creamy texture.

Great suggestions and it came out smooth.  I used 2% milk instead of half and half and it did not effect the flavor but the soup is not as thick as I am sure it would have been but it is plenty rich.

I also have 100 baked potatoes I was needing to use up so I added about 4 cups of cubed baked potato at the very end of the recipe,  they seems perfect in the soup and my wife even asked for more.

First time ever for the national dish of Wisconsin. I used a dark beer and half heavy cream half water. The direction are clear and easy to follow. The soup goes together quickly. I hope it will freeze as even a half recipe yielded a full 2 quarts of soup. The dark beer stood up well to the cream and cheese and, while it incorporated well it was still a delicate note that was easily identifiable. I garnished with freshly made garlic croutons and bacon. We loved it and will be making a part of our repertoire from now on.

The Best Beer Cheese Soup I have ever made!! Be sure to use cheddar cheese and no other for melting purposes. I dusted my shredded sharp cheddar cheese with corn starch to keep it from clumping too and be sure to constantly stir when adding the cheese. I would make this again Absolutely!!

I wanted something different for New Year's eve and this soup was a hit~  the whole family loved it!  I made the soup exactly as the recipe instructed, but I used  extra sharp cheddar cheese (instead of just sharp) and the beer I used was a strong  import.  I will definitely make it again, but next time I will add more veggies.  I'm not a popcorn fan so did not use that as a topping. We enjoyed the soup with a warm french baguette.  A great, rich soup for a cold winter's night.  Thanks for sharing the recipe ...

Made it first with original recipe. 5 stars there.  My daughter said she didn't like the veggies in it.  Teenagers huh.  Although they were frozen carrots I was getting rid of. They were a bit rubbery.  So next time I made it.  I followed the recipe the same.  I just skimmed out the carrots and celery.  Then I added a Parmigiano-Reggiano  rind I keep in the freezer for such occasions and simmered it for an hour or so.  I love parmesan. I keep all the rinds.  It was thick, hearty and very tasty.

Next time I would first sauté  the vegetables in butter before adding them to the broth. Despite cooking them for the suggested time they were still a little crush for my taste.

This was exactly what I was craving! Don't let the reviews on texture problems scare you. Just be sure to cook the vegetables in butter to tenderize them before adding all the liquids. And when you are thickening the flour and cream, allow it plenty of time to get nice and thick before adding the cheese. This recipe was spot on. Perfect taste with a perfect thick & creamy texture. Just the right amount of beer and cheese flavors. Note: I don't like chunks of vegetables in my cheese soup, so I did not add many carrots, onion, or celery, and the ones I did add, I chopped extremely fine.

This was a wonderful soup the isn't too thick and very tasty. I confess...I had come hard cider left over and substituted it for the beer, added two diced cooked baked potatoes and 4 slices of cooked crumbled bacon(consider more).  Perfect for a cold winter day! Thank you!

This was the highlight of thanksgiving, didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the result was delicious.  Dip some toasted French bread in.  

Beer flavor and smell was good too.  No problem with sand in the leeks.  Will add a little cilantro next time.

We always add more garlic than it calls for, plus we sauteed the veggies first to try to soften them more (I usually do this with any soup so it doesn't take as long). I should have done it for longer, since the veggies still didn't get as soft as we were hoping for. It also didn't get as thick as we wanted it to be, so maybe more flour next time? It's a great base recipe for beer cheese though.

I have made this twice - the first time I was looking to use up some half-consumed beers after a family picnic (we aren't heavy drinkers, lol) and the second because I really liked it the first time!  My modifications: both times I added sodium citrate to ensure a smoothly combined cheese soup.  The second time, I had lots of picky kids over and decided to pulverize the veggies and strain them back in.  No fiber anymore, but the smooth consistency was appreciated!

This is a good recipe, the soup is delicious, not gloppy, the right balance between the cheese and the beer.    I gave it four stars because of the cooking method.  I agree with other reviewers, you don't need to use two pots, just sprinkle the flour over the veg and create your roux, make sure you have enough butter/olive oil in the pan.   I also blended the soup in my blender because I wanted a smooth consistency.   For all those concerned with curdling, the way to ensure that doesn't happen is to use evaporated milk.  I used one can and added regular milk as well. I reheated the soup the next day for the Super Bowl in my crock pot and it was in there for several hours and never curdled.

Similar to a recipe I've fixed for years though no potato chunks in this version.  I probably boosted the cheese a bit, but not much additional amounts or types of seasonings needed. I cooked the veggies enough so they were semi-soft and they had good flavor as well.  I'm not buying popcorn just for myself, but white cheddar popcorn seems like a fun garnish. When is a Mirapoix Not a Mirapoix...when they aren't removed before eating and then call it vegetable cheese beer soup. Good stuff...thickened well w/ whole milk, stores and freezes well.

This turned out really good.  I made a bunch of tweaks based on the comments from everyone.  I had extra flour on hand just like everyone also suggested.  I swapped out the milk for cream, cooked the veggies for extra time (and they got soft), and ditched the black pepper and dry mustard.  My wife is a farm girl from Minnesota (where salt and pepper are considered spicy) so next time I'll leave out the heat and have hot sauce on the table so people can add it themselves.  Also, for beer I stuck to a fairly light pilsner after hearing some of the other comments from people about bitterness. I used a Peroni and the smell was great.  I find that when cooking with beer, if you simmer for extra time the sharpness or bitterness will decrease as well.

Awesome recipe! The only thing I did different was add some sriracha make some bacon and onion dumplings then finish it in the oven. Wow, this is my new go-to cheese soup. Will try it with potatoes sometime. Thanks for the great soup!

So I did the steps differently but I added all the same ingredients, and added a portabella mushroom, a large one, and I used twisted pretzel wheat beer by shock top. This was so yummy... I don't think I would have made this recipe exactly the same as its says to in any situation but just tweaking it to make it my own I had a blast. I'm from FL And never heard of beer cheese soup....but this was good!

This is a delicious soup!  I did have to make three changes because we are a low carb and gluten free household.  I used Omission gluten free pale ale beer, instead of flour, I used 1 teaspoon xanthan gum, and half and half.  Those changes worked beautifully.

I sauteed the veggies in 5 tablespoon unsalted butter until soft.  I added all the seasonings except salt, gluten free beer, and Kitchen Basics Original Chicken Stock and let that come to a boil.  I waited until the end to add the salt and just added a sprinkling.

I removed the soup from the heat and added the half and half and then the cheese.  I returned the soup to a medium heat and let the cheese melt slowly.  I didn't let it come to a boil after I added the cheese because that can cause the cheese fats to separate.

I made this yesterday and it's delicious! I only had regular beer on hand but the next time I make it will try with a chard cider or some type of speciality beer. I used the "optional" ingredients and the soup wasn't too spicy.

I have been searching for a really good beer-cheese dip and adjusted this to make it.  The flavor was exactly what I was looking for.  I halved the recipe, left out the carrots, used celery seed instead of celery.  I cooked the garlic and onion in the butter, then added 1/4 cup flour since I wanted it thick.  Used all of the other ingredients (just a little milk, however) listed and Blue Moon beer.  The hand immersion took care of blending the chopped onion.  Served it with Hawaiian bread.  Family raved.

I made this the other night, word for word and my family ate every last drop! Tonight we are having it again, but the hubby asked for cauliflower in it. We have decided this will be the base to all of our cheese soups ! Thank you for this great recipe

Fabulous soup though I made a few adjustments. I ran the veggies after cooking through the food processor till grainy so that the soup would have a bit of texture. I used 4 tsp Worcestershire and in place of the milk, I used1 can evaporated milk and 1 cup of heavy cream. it is just delicious.

I had some beer that I didn't like, so instead of tossing it, I used it in this recipe. The flavor wasn't masked, and I didn't care for the taste of the soup. So, you should probably use a beer that you like. I have made a cheese and broccoli soup from this site numerous times (no beer) that I liked much better and will stick with that.

I enjoyed this soup, and the recipe is basically sound.  I do have some tweaks, though.
As suggested, saute the diced veggies, don't boil them. After sauting, add the beer and use a blender.
Heat the milk before adding to the butter/flour mixture (called a roux), and stir until it thickens.  For 4C milk, it should probably be 1/2C butter and 1/2C flour.
The 1-1/2C chicken broth will make this too thin.  Instead, a>reduce that amount to 1/4C before adding, or b> use bullion cubes (be careful of the salt, or c> use chicken base from a jar (I used 6t)
The beer shouldn't be the star here.  Use Bud or Miller or Corona or any unassuming pilsner.
I also added broccoli.  The chopped stems went in at the start with the other veggies, and the florets were added at the last 10 minutes of cooking. 
If blandness is an issue, kick up the flavor enhancers: I used six cloves of garlic, and twice the hot sauce and Worchestershire. 
The better the cheese the better this will be.  I used half 5-year-old cheddar and half pepper jack.
While I get the joke of the popcorn garnish, I think croutons are a better bet. 
I also did all of this in one pot, but I'll leave that up to you to figure out.

First time making.  Recipe is easy and tasty but I didn't think it was as creamy or as hearty as I felt it should be.  I added some cubed potatoes and about 1/2 cup of parm cheese and I did add a bit extra flour to thicken up more.  Served with garlic cheese croutons and crusty bread.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and sautéed the veggies first, upped the butter to 1/2 cup, then added the flour, followed by the liquids. 4 cups of half and half seemed like a lot, so I added only 2 cups to start, and 2 cups was plenty.  IMHO, the broth would have been far too runny and the flavor of the broth diluted with the extra half and half.  I used Negra Modelo for the beer, and I liked it.  Another reviewer mentioned adding bratwurst, which I think would be a really good addition.  I would make it again with my revisions.

I lived in Wisconsin for a few years and grew very attached to the good cheese in the state. But now that I live in Indiana I have to put meat and potatoes into any soup. I made this with bacon and potatoes and it was delicious.I cooked the veggies with the bacon adding the chicken stock and beer and simmered longer than 12 minutes. To the combined cheese, veggie, and bacon mixture I added potatoes at the end and cooked another 20 minutes on a simmer.

It's okay, wasn't what I was expecting, but it still tastes good. If I make it again, I will likely omit the mustards and the Worcestershire sauce. I like my beer cheese soup to predominantly taste like beer and cheese, haha!

Ok this recipe is really good. I used Tillamook extra sharp cheddar which was worth a little extra $. I also sautéed the vegetables for about 30 minutes to make softer. Quite easy and excellent results.

Was very tasty. I used a Magic Hat #9. I would have liked a little more beer taste, so maybe I should use a stronger beer. But overall great

My kids didn't care for it, so I won't be making it again.  I sauted the veggies, put the flour in to make a roux, added the liquids and heated to very warm, then added the cheese.  I did add more flour because it wasn't thick enough.  I would recommend a really light beer, like bud light...then it might be okay for kids.  I used a kolsch, but left too much of a taste for the kiddos.  :(

I love this soup but don't care for vegetable chunks. After softening the veggies I put small batches in the blender. Followed the rest of the recipe as is but also added some grilled, chopped brats at the end. Delicious!

I tried this because I liked the large amount of veggies.  This comes out better if they are chopped very fine.  This helps them cook completely and they won't sink when served.  These are very large servings.  I started out making half to try it and I have enough for several lunches.  My main downgrade is that cheese measured in cups can very a lot.  I wish I knew the weight.  I was reluctant to try popcorn but homemade croutons were great with it.

I made this for the Super Bowl Cooking Challenge for about 100 people (4 ounce servings) and it was soooo good. I made way too much but it was hard to judge the amount per serving. I made a recipe for 60 (using this recipe as serving 10 not 8 which I now figures is about 1 1/2 cups per serving) and it made 6 gallons.  I used a gallon of milk + 1 quart half and half; 8 beers; 16 cups of chicken broth. Even with reduced liquid I needed to add a lot more flour (Wondra) to thicken it up. Also, I used my immersible blender and pureed the veggies then had to do it again with the cheese to get it thoroughly melted and smooth. The mustards and worcestershire really make the flavor stand out.

I'm from Wisconsin and we know our beer cheese soup, this recipe is great! I add cornstarch and water at end to thicken slightly, but the flavor can't be beat! Served in homemade bread bowls has my family asking for this soup again and again, with picky eaters you know that makes it a hit!!

I was worried about blandness, so I tripled the garlic, added some chopped serranos, more hot sauce, and followed the previous reviewers suggestions of making a roux and using one pot. Pretty good soup for a chilly evening! Next time I will add more chilies and use a darker beer

Wow.  This is soooo good.  This is the 1st Beer Cheese soup I've ever tried.  Stumbled across this recipe and it just sounded good.  I took off 1 star only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written, but used all the ingredients as listed but followed naples34102's cooking method- did it all in 1 pot and sweating the vegetables in the butter, instead of boiling them. The extra steps seemed to just over complicate things and result in more pots and pans to wash. I also topped it with bacon instead of the popcorn. This recipe is a keeper.

This recipes rocks! The only things that I changed were adding twice as much garlic (because you can never have too much garlic) and I completely took out the dry mustard because I didn't have any. This soup tastes (and smells) like heaven in a bowl. I wouldn't be surprised if this soup ends up on my grocery list a lot. A KEEPER FOR SURE!!!

Just made this and although I'm exhausted I really like it.  I thought it would be thick since I've never had a thin beer cheese soup but I have to say - I like it better thin.  Too often you order this in a restaurant and the texture and taste is similar to Old El Paso Cheese sauce in a jar.  Can't wait to serve it at my dinner party - maybe I'll report back and maybe someone can tell me if it's supposed to be thin or did I mess up texture-wise. My husband says it's delicious and he doesn't hold back when asked.

really really yummy.  We used a dark bear (heart of darkness harpoon)and it turned out REALLY yummy; if you like beer a lot.  A light beer would be a little more mild and less bitter, but we liked it bitter!  We had it on v-day with some steak, it was a perfect special soup course!

I tried this recipe with quite a few adjustments (cuz thats just what i do )  I added steak, potatoes and mushrooms and made it more like a stew. I also changed the method of cooking. First I browned the meat with the onions and garlic, then I added the flour, beers and broth then the veggies and seasonings and let simmer until meat was tender. I then added the cheese directly to the soup and finally the 1/2 and 1/2. It came out great!

I followed another reviewers instructions and sweated the vegies in the butter, added in the flour to make the roux.  Added in the seasonings and liquids.  Bring to a boil, lower temp and let cool down.  Take off heat and slowly add in cheese.  I use the pre-packaged shredded fine stuff and it works just fine if it's cooled down some and you add it in slowly.  Being a life-long Wisconsinite, I also added in some beer brats that I cooked and diced and of course served with beer bread.  Declared Best Superbowl feast ever!!!

I made it the day before Christmas and served it on Christmas day for the soup course of our dinner. As others noted, it reheated beautifully.  My notes: I shred my veggies in a food processor to make them smaller and to speed up the prep process.  I also used an immersion blender to make the veggies even more fine for serving. There was lots of texture, but no big lumps of veggie. I thickened the soup the next day with more roux and added more salt, pepper, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce to enhance the flavor to my palate.  EVERYONE RAVED!!  Best cheese soup I've made.  I will keep this recipe in my favorites.

Adjusted the recipe for 20 servings. Didn't deviate from the instructions, and found it to be bland.

Great flavor- I followed the recipe and advice of others- made sure the vegetables were soft- pureed them, used good block cheese- cooked cheese at low temp- still a bit of a texture issue but not enough to hinder me from making it again.  Served it with Chef John's San Francisco bagles

Sooooooooooooo  good!  It was a little thin but the taste made up for it.  The veggies were a little chrunchy at first but I made the soup and then moved it to a crock pot and let it cook on low for a few hours, still waiting to see if that helped.

This recipe is fantastic!  We vacation in Wisconsin a few times each year for the past 25 years so we feel like almost-natives.  Looking forward to developing a lightened-up version so we can justify making this a lot more often!  We'll save the full-flavor version from "Savvyhostess" for those Bears vs. Green Bay games!  Go Bears!

Not sure how this was supposed to taste...mine came out rather bitter.  I'll try making it again and not putting in the dry mustard and maybe use a lighter beer?  Also, trying to get the ingredients together and follow instructions on an ipad is a pain in the butt...could have been the formatting on the ipad though.

This soup is very good and very easy to make. It had little too much mustard for our liking, but that is an easy fix for next time and there will be a next time!

Couple more details: I used 2 C skim and 2 C cream.  Sifted about 1/4 C flour at end to thicken.  Cheese was grated ( thank you, Cuisinart).  Texture held and color was perfect.  People liked the heat, so don't skimp on pepper.  No popcorn, but like idea of brats chopped into soup.  Too many vegetarians at my party for that.

I lost my original recipe for this soup when I stumbled on this one. It's a good recipe, but I made it tonight and it turned out gritty. I think my cheese curled on me. I never used two pots with my previous recipe. I will cook my veggies in butter next time and do it all in the same pot. I have always used New Castle beer. It's my favorite, but I like the Smithwicks idea too. I will cook my veggies longer next time. Not sure how to keep the cheese from curdling. Never had that problem before. Google here I come. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent soup! Allow some time to simmer this soup and really thicken it up. I puree the veggies to get a smooth texture. Use a really good, super sharp chedder for the best result.

I made this soup a little haphazardly, as I didn't have all the ingredients.  But, as has been stated, it's a phenomenal jumping off point to make variations on. \
I began by halving the recipe, as I'm just cooking for myself and a few close people.  I added a few thinly sliced strips of bacon to the vegetables in the beginning.  I also added potatoes and took out the celery (I hadn't any available).  For the dijon mustard, I used a spicy jalapeno mustard instead.  The beer I used was Montana Brewing Co's "Summer Honey Seasonal Ale".  A fairly dark ale with a hint of sweetness, not bitter.  I read about serving it with a soft pretzel and it's a phenomenal idea! 

Mind you, I'm not from Wisconsin (South Dakota), so I can't claim this to be a "real beer cheese soup", I can claim it to be a pretty delicious soup with some beer and cheese and bacon!

This is a great recipe, but I would make some changes next time...
I did add fresh sliced mushrooms for the last 10 min simmer, which was a great addition.  Next time I will cut the broth to 2 cups, cut the half and half to 3 cups & up the flour to 1/2 cup.

A wholesome soup that's delicious! Didn't change a thing to the recipe and it turned out great. For added punch and colour, sprinkle Paprika powder over soup just before serving.

This was a hit with my picky family. My husband, who can be hard to cook for, said this is a definite keeper. Went with the croutons instead of the popcorn, at another reviewer's suggestion, and it was good. I could see where popcorn would get soggy pretty quickly.

I used this recipe with my pot roast left overs and it was delish!  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added Velveeta as needed to thicken it up.  Shiner Bock is great for cooking.

This wasn't as thick and creamy as I had hoped for, but it had a very good taste and I can't complain.    I actually used three more cups of cheese than the recipe called for to thicken it up a bit.  Next time I might try using cream of chicken instead of chicken stock just to get the rich consistency I'm looking for.

Incredible soup (I used heavy cream, nothing less) and gave the veggies a spin in the food processor. I used to sell it out of a deli kitchen in Palm Harbor.  Customers couldn't get enough.  ONLY use the popcorn as a side bite, not on the soup... or forgoe it.  Crutes work good too, as does crispy bacon.  YUMOLA

My family was very hungry for beer cheese soup so tried the recipe. We enjoyed it very much but some thought the beer taste was a little too strong so I will make again but cut the beer in half next time. Maybe the cook just has to drink the other portion while making the soup.  Very rich though but good. I did make mine with all milk as I was trying to cut calories a little with all the cheese but that is what cheese soup is.

This soup was delicious!  My one complaint is that even after 30+ minutes of simmering the veggies, they still maintained a bit of a bite.  Next time I will cook the veggies until tender then continue with the recipe as written.  I'm sure I will be making it again soon as my husband has requested that we have it on a weekly basis.

I am rating it a 5 star. My boyfriend Tay (Aaron) loved it so much, he ate three bowls in ONE sitting!!! I decided to add some beer brats, so I fried/braised them in Guiness for like 20/25 minutes, then I started in on the soup...I had decided to use Guiness, but ugh, I would not use Guiness again. Mind you I LOVE BEER. But it was so strong of a flavor. I will use something maybe like a ROLLING ROCK or something along the lines of that. I also froze half the batch, and I hope that it turns out to be yummy in a month or so when I heat it back up.

Yummy! Two of my favorite things, Beer and Cheese. I used a Texas favorite beer, Shiner Bock. Did not have any cayenne pepper, but substituted with Chipolte pepper. Next time, I am going to buy a sharper cheese. We ommitted the popcorn and used pretzels as a garnish.

*I halved this recipe so my review will be based on the amounts for 4 servings.* I used one cup of fat free half & half and one cup of skim milk whisked with cornstarch instead of regular half and half. I also used wheat flour, low fat butter, fat free chicken broth, and reduced fat/calorie cheese. I put two cups of sharp cheddar and one cup of aged white cheddar that I bought from the deli (then shredded). I put in one cup of Fat Tire and next time will reduce this amount. I think the beer gives it a great flavor, but that was a tad too much. We don't have any dry mustard or dijon around so I left those out and don't think it made a difference. I used some extra hot pepper sauce and cayenne, and next time I'll put more. I left the Worcesteshire in and thought it added a nice flavor.  I think the soup came out really yummy and I don't feel so guilty about eating it because I reduced calories where I could! I'm surprised that people complained about it not being thick enough. I actually found it a little too thick and added extra broth. Skipped the popcorn because it just didn't sound appealing.

I love this recipe!!  You can taste almost every ingredient you put in it.  I did use some ingredients that you may want to try, like Sriracha hot sauce, 4 cups of the sharp cheddar and 2 cups of Monterey Jack, and a fall beer, I used Dundee's Oktoberfest.  So yummy!

This is delicious, my 15 and 16 year old boys ate 3 times more than I did. I thought it may become too liquidy so I added half of the veggie mixture, strained the liquid from the remainder of the mixture then added the remainder of the veggie to the cheese. Oh yeah, I also used 4 cups grated sharp cheddar and 2 cups grated swiss. The leftovers should be even better tomorrow.

This soup is fantastic. I chopped the veg's in my food processor to keep them really small. I used Vermont extra sharp cheddar cheese that I graded myself. I used a lot more than what was called for to get the thickness I wanted after I added the soup stock. I also did not add all the soup stock to the cheese mixture so it wouldn't be to thin. I played around with it a bit. But it was worth it.

I made this soup exactly as the recipe called for.  Vegetables added very nice texture.  I used Guinness Extra Stout beer which gave it a great flavor with the sharpness of the cheese.  Each bowl was topped with diced Canadian Bacon... I give this soup 5 STARS!!!!!

This tasted wonderful.  Not all of my kids will eat something like this but my 9 year old will eat anything.  He loves to critique foods and loved this enough to try to talk me into another serving!  It is quite filling so I was shocked he could make room for more!!  I saved half of my recipe to freeze and have my husband try it when he returns home from the military...he loves beer cheese soup!

It had a good flavor, but I like a richer/creamer beer cheese soup.  Also, my veggies did not get soft enough. I will try again, but saute my veggies first. I will also reduce the amount of chicken broth and beer to keep the soup thicker and creamer.

This was pretty good.  I only put in one can of beer (which is probably 1 1/2 cups), other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  There was a taste that I'm not sure about.  My husband said it was the beer and that I should leave it out next time.  I thought it was the mustard.  Other than that, we really enjoyed it.  A lot of people mentioned consistency problems and that it was time consuming.  I didn't think it took that long to put together and it was a very nice consistency.  I did add a bit of Wondra to the broth and veggies before I added it to the cheese mixture to keep it from being too thin.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

Update 2019
This continues to be my favorite soup. Made it for the OSU vs Wisconsin game. I’m a buckeye fan, but love the Wisconsin peeps. Turns out great every time!!

This is a great recipe! However, I would recommend adding more beer. We thought it was just a little too cheesy, so we added about another cup of beer...give or take. Dip some potato chips or fries in it! YUM!

Good, but not great.  My 11 yr old gobbled it up.  The rest of us liked it just fine but weren't wow-ed by it.  If I make it again, I'll puree the veggies.  It was time consuming, which is why I say "if I make it again."

Oh sweet Wisconsin heaven!  This recipe turned out better than the beer cheese soup I had in the Dells last January! We used a Hawai'ian wheat beer made with passion fruit... I didn't make that decision. But it still turned out really great!  I think next time I'll go for a dark ale. Extra sharp cheddar makes it best, and we found salt&pepper popcorn that really complemented the soup. Nice work savvy!

This soup turned out wonderful. I did do a few things different.   First I added a few more cloves of garlic, next I changed the cheese to colby jack instead of cheddar.  I am a Wisconsin native so I had access to some excellent cheese for this recipe.   Last I threw in some leftover ham that I had diced up in the fridge.  I used Miller high life for the beer.  Yummy!!!:)

This is a thicker than water, cheesy broth.  This needs so much more to bite into.  Maybe meat ... something!  The veggies are tender enough to not really recognize.  The soup is ok in flavor but this might as well be strained and served as cheesy consomme.  It makes a lot.  I'll buy some chicken or brats to throw into the leftovers, which there were plenty of.  Won't take the time to retry with the added meat.

VERY GOOD SOUP. I OMITTED THE ONIONS AND CELERY (I DON'T CARE FOR EITHER). I LOVE SPICY SO I ADDED EXTRA TABASCO. ALSO, ADDED IN SOME LEFTOVER BRATS I HAD. THAT WAS A GREAT ADDITION. HOWEVER, NEXT TIME I WILL PROBABLY LEAVE OUT THE DIJON. IT WAS A LITTLE OVERPOWERING. USED COORS LIGHT AND ADDED CROUTONS ON TOP. WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN FOR SURE!

This was truly the best!  Instead of chopping a lot of vegetables, I used a can of veg-all.  Everything else was made exactly as the recipe instructed.  Amazing soup on a cold fall day!

My husband didn't like the flavor.  Also I made the mistake of adding the cheese all at one time and it gobbed up.
