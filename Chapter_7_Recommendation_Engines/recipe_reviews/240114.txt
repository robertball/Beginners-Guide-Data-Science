Whole family loved these!  Had to make substitutions to use what I had on hand.. almond milk, no nuts so I doubled the oatmeal, used cinnamon instead of allspice.  I also loved that they did not stick to the muffin cup liners!!

These muffins are super moist and loaded with rich banana flavor.  They have the perfect balance of ingredients (and not too many oats), rose beautifully, and yielded 12 good-sized muffins.   I followed the ingredient amounts to the letter, but I did make substitutions.  I ran out of A/P flour, so used half bread flour (what was on hand), used Truvia for the sugar, skim for whole milk, and egg substitute for the eggs.  I'm not dieting, but I am trying to be more cognizant of my nutritional intake each day, so I adapt and compromise when I can.  In this case, it worked, and all was good!  Olivia, thanks for a great new breakfast muffin.

These bake up nice and moist. I used brown sugar for the white, and subbed raisins for the nuts. I used half white and half whole wheat flour.I subbed cinnamon for the allspice. They are good for a breakfast on the go without getting crumbs all over the car! My grand daughter likes these so much she wants a batch to share with her pre-school class. Awesome!

And  1 1/4 cups of oatmeal
Then I kinda added more cinnamon and nutmeg...
And all the little bits in my cupboard
So dark chocolate chunks, walnuts, peanuts, handful of ground flax and sesame seeds.....

After reading a few of the reviews I added milk choc chips and cinnamon. The muffins cooked quickly in my convection oven and were ready in 15 min.  The muffins were delicious!

I bought some peanut butter powder  and wanted to try it out with muffins, but there are no recipes for "normal" food available, as I am not keto, gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free or any other.  I just cook and eat.  I used this recipe because it is pretty basic, then modified it a bit to take advantage of the peanut butter powder.  The container says it can be made into peanut butter by adding 3 tablespoons of water to 4 tbsp of powder, so I added that to the recipe.  The results were spectacular.  Moist, lower-fat muffins, that we a bit sweeter than I like, as this powder has added palm sugar in it, but the muffins were really good.  Cooked in the same amount of time.  Next time, I will add more of the powder for a stronger flavor, but this was like adding a quarter cup of regular peanut butter.

A great base recipe! Mine came out airy in the middle and crispy on the outside, which I love. I was surprised at so little milk needed, but it works. I used less sugar and put in more oatmeal. I also added in about a third cup of applesauce, I wasn't sure what to eliminate. This resulted in 12 regular muffins plus a small bread pan.

I too used ingredients on hand.  In addition to "beloit3's" substitutions, I used 1 C whole wheat flour; 1/2 C brown sugar. Had lots of apples to use up & only 1 ripe banana, so used 2 shredded apples.  Well, now that they're done... even with the juicy apples, they aren't as moist as I thought they'd be.  I'll have to give this one another try later.

I wanted to use up some overripe bananas and made these muffins for breakfast. A few swaps - golden sugar for white, pumpkin seeds for walnuts and sweet cinnamon for all spice. Delicious, will definitely make again!

We loved these muffins.  I did not have any all spice, so I used one teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg. I used almond milk and a little more sugar.
I also added half a cup of blackberries.  Muffins were a hit.  I have made them at least 5 times within the last couple of months.

These were very yummy! I doubled the recipe so hubby could share them at work and they all loved them too! I did sub half of the butter with unsweetened applesauce to cut down on the fat since I figured we'd eat them with our favorite Brummel and Brown Yogurt margarine spread and they were delish!!!!

11-20-2017  ~Not sure why my experience contradicts those of most other reviewers.  I prepared these as written, only adding a streusel topping.  They're pretty, nicely flavored, but Hubs and I agree they were… disappointingly on the dry side.   Not a "make again."

My kids LOVED this recipe. I substituted the 1 cup of white sugar for 3/4 cup of brown sugar and used chopped pecan pieces instead of the walnut, as that's what I had on hand. This muffin recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!

These were great!  I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts due to a slight allergy.  I decreased to sugar to 2/3 cups as the bananas were nice and sweet and I don't like things too sweet.  Would make them again for sure!

Moist and delicious. The oats give it a bit of texture but are not really noticeable.   I made it in a shallow cake pan instead of muffins, and didn't have allspice so I substituted  a little bit of cinnamon and cloves.  I will make this again!

They  were super moist. Big Yum! I would try using less sugar next time. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I, also, used half almond meal flour. I hope company comes soon so I don't eat them all before the arrive!

Really very good and filling! I doubled the recipe and used vanilla yogurt for half the butter. These still were very moist and very good! I may add one more banana the next time I make these ( though the ones I used this time were medium to small sizes) but other than that, I'm pretty pleased! I know often fruit baked goods have more flavor the next day, so we'll see how they are tomorrow :)
