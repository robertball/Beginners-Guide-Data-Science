This is the same cut out cookie recipe that I have used for several years. It is easy to make and wonderful for elaborate decorations. This is one that I use each Christmas for the cookie baskets that I am famous for. It's not so much the flavor that everyone loves but the decoration on top. The only thing I do different is use two 1/4" dowell rods when rolling out the dough to make sure each cookie is the same height and bake evenly.

These are okay. The dough was great for cutouts. 1/8 inch thick though seemed a bit thin and we had trouble getting them on the cookie sheet. We rolled the next ones a little thicker about 1/4 inch and they were much easier to work with. Flavor was so-so just a sugar cookie. A little dense heavier texture than what I prefer. This is a nice sturdy cookie perfect for little hands to decorate.

GOOD! My intentions were to make these cookies as snow flakes. I had my cookie cutters all set but the dough would not roll. I had placed it in the refrigerator in the morning and this was evening. I didn't want to add any more flour because I didn't want a dry bland cookie. What I did was get out my cookie scoop and roll the scoop of dough in coarse sugar then flatten. Because I was now off track and the dough was thicker I lowered the temperature to 375degrees and baked for 10 minutes to be sure the center was done. The resulting cookie was delicious. I'm sorry this recipe did not work for me but the end result was GOOD! Thank you Patty Morris for sharing!

I was so excited for this recipe but unfortunately I think they are just to sweet for me! Also when they cool they get a lol bit to hard as well.
