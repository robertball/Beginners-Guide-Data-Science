As I write this review, this recipe has only a few people who have reviewed it and an average rating of just four stars--what a shame.  I hope more bakers give this recipe a chance and bring that rating up to five stars where it belongs! I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter and substituted butter for the margarine called for in the streusel, keeping all else the same. I kind of had the feeling when I saw the ingredients called for vegetable oil (rather than butter or even shortening) that this would be moist and that's exactly what this is--moist, flavorful, and bursting with blueberry flavor. The topping amount is just right, with a pleasing buttery crunch.  I have made several of these coffeecakes or "buckles," over the years, one in particular that has been my favorite for over 40 years. But as good as that recipe is, THIS recipe beats it hands down for moistness.  In fact, I think this is the finest recipe of its kind I've ever had!

This is a great brunch cake for any day of the week.  It's moist, delicious, bursting with blueberries and topped with a crisp buttery streusel. I followed the recipe exactly and added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter.  I baked it in an 8x8 pan and was very pleasantly suprised with the results.

How can you not love the name of this cake? With a newly purchased 4 pound bag of blueberries tucked in my freezer and my 2 grandkids scheduled for an overnight with us, I was searching for a special breakfast treat.  I made this, pretty much according to directions, and half a cake later we all declared it a winner.  It was moist, flavorful, and had just the right amount of blueberries.  I added vanilla to the batter and substituted butter for margarine in the crumb topping as suggested by Naples.  I also used brown sugar instead of white in the topping.  It was delicious; however, next time I'll probably stick with the granulated sugar and try a little nutmeg instead of cinnamon.  I have a favorite blueberry muffin recipe that calls for a dusting of sugar and nutmeg and we really love that flavor combination.  For those who had issues with this being too dry or needing extra baking time, some things to check are pan size, oven thermostat, and your pan material.  Some pan coatings require lowering your oven temperature by 25 degrees.

Very moist cake but it was missing something. Next time I'll add a splash of vanilla, as Naples suggested.

Moist and yummy!! I used butter instead of margarine in the topping, added the zest of one lemon and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the batter, and baked it in a 7 X 9 pan.

Well I'm not sure what to think just yet. I followed the recipe with no changes for the first time. It is moist. It could definitely use some vanilla. It's not bad, I'm just not finding it up to par for a coffee cake. Something is missing. I will make this one again and play a little.

I think this cake is truly wonderful.  It is great made just how the recipie stated, but to increase flavor, adding about 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and lemon zest according to how you like the taste (I use around just over 1 1/2 tbsp. for a stronger aroma) might be something to try.  I made it just the way the recipie said (except that I accedentally use almond milk) the first time through, then tweaked it with lemon and vanilla.  This is actually the  third time I have  made this and I also plan on making this for Fourth of July. It is a very moist and easy cake, and I see that as a good thing.  I do think adding some vanilla (as most of the other comments said) wouldn't hurt, but still, This recipie is definetly a keeper!

This recipe makes a very good coffeecake, but a little vanilla and more salt would boost the flavor.  The only ingredient change I made was to use butter instead of margarine.  I also used frozen blueberries so the coffeecake needed to bake 50 minutes.

Very tasty cake although a bit dry.  I used 2/3 Splenda, 1/3 sugar plus the recommended 1/2 t. vanilla.  I would suggest adding 1/2 c more blueberries and serving warm with vanilla ice cream.

The first time I made this cake, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out more like a doughy crumble than a coffee cake. 

I decided to give it another chance but this time I only used 1 cup of blueberries.  I mixed half a cup into the batter, and spread the other half cup on top of the batter after I poured it into the pan.  I covered with the topping and baked as usual.   

It turned out perfect.  It was so good in fact, I made it again last weekend for breakfast because I had a house full of relatives and it was gone in 30 minutes.

This tasty moist blueberry cake turned out very well.  When I read some previous reviews it seemed as though there was a consensus about adding vanilla so I followed suit with 1 tsp.  Other than that addition I followed the recipe exactly and took the cake out of the oven at 35minutes.  I have fresh raspberries to use and I might just make another cake with them.  Love the topping.

This is fabulous!!!!!!! I made just a few changes. I didn't have any vanilla so I used lemon extract. I totally forgot the cinnamon in the topping but I didn't miss it.  I used butter in the topping and sprinkled some sliced almonds on top.  So good, I want another piece now!!! I'm going to have go pick more blueberries to make another one...

I love this cake. I've made it 5 times or so, and it's turned out fantastic everytime. I've used both frozen and fresh blueberries, and it is flavorful and moist both ways. My family and co-workers all love it, and I get asked for the recipe every time I make it.

Pretty good!  I really love the crispy, sugary topping.  In fact, I ate most of that off the top of the cake, hope family doesn't notice it is missing something on top...but seriously, this is perfect with a cup of coffee.

Great recipe.  Two cups of blueberries is a tad much though.  I was a fan, but my dad said he wanted more "cake."  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Baked in a 8 by 8 pan, perfect size. Used butter and brown sugar for topping. Really tasty.

I made this with frozen blackberries and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  I only had an 8x8 pan dark metal pan so I baked at 325.  Took 50 minutes.  Great recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I can wait to try other fruits in the batter.  I just happen to be over run with blackberries right now!

This turned out tasty! I subbed one very ripe banana for the oil, added cinnamon and vanilla into the batter, butter instead of margarine and baked in a 9" pie plate. 
Will make this again.

This is a flawed recipe. To fix it, do the following: Use butter instead of oil and margarine. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1  teaspoon vanilla to the batter. 2 cups of blueberries is overkill but fun; to save money, 1 cup of blueberries is plenty.  Consider adding 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the struesel. If you use frozen blueberries, expect baking time to nearly double. With these changes, this becomes an excellent blueberry coffee cake.

I usually don't change the recipe on the first try, but broke my own rule here.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla to the batter because others had recommended that change.  The change I should not have made was I doubled the recipe and then baked in a 10" tube pan.  I had to bake for 1/2 hour longer than recommended in the recipe.  Once cooled though, I could not remove from the pan without it breaking apart, so I just cut pieces off as we ate it and then today took it completely out of the pan.  The cake itself tasted great. I won't bake it in that type of pan again.

This recipe is excellent! I made them into muffins instead of a cake. Just filled 12 muffin cups and baked for 30 min. My husband who usually doesn't like muffins loved these! I was tempted not to put so many blueberries in because it seemed like a lot, but added them all anyways. I am glad I did... so delicious! And, the topping is awesome!

Delicious!!  And so simple.  I made it in an 8x8 pan, and baked it for 45 - 50 mins total.  It was perfect!  Light, fluffy, delish.  My boyfriend is not a dessert fan, but he ate 2 pieces!

This recipe has a very dense cake texture. I had to cook it 10 minutes longer than recipe states. A great way to use up those frozen blueberries from summer.

I made it exactly as the recipe said, but I think the streusel was a bit too much... It clumped together and made craters, so the cake didn't look so pretty. Love the taste, though!

If you can, make it the day before you need it.  What a difference a day makes!  Very moist so don't cover tightly.  I also added a teaspoon of  vanilla.  I accidentally melted the butter for the topping so I added some quick oats to make it crumbly.  I may even try a different fruit next time.  Very good basic recipe for coffee cake.

This cake is so easy to make. It came out very moist. I love the amount of blueberries in this cake, bursting with flavor. The only thing I changed was substituting brown sugar for white, in the streusel topping.

This was an easy, very light and delicious cake. I cut the amount of sugar in the cake since there was a crumb topping with sugar because my husband doesn’t like cakes that are too sweet. I also used part half and half and part nonfat milk which I think helped make it so light.  I will make it again.

This turned out wonderfully delicious. I also used stevia in place of sugar in batter and almond milk instead of regular milk. I also used butter in topping and broiled for 4 minutes for a golden brown crumb topping.

This is delicious! The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine in the topping. The recipe doubles well for a 9x13 inch pan with no extra baking time. I'm making it again today!

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 13x9 Pyrex pan. I added about a 1/4 cup of flour to the crumb mixture. I also used A2 milk so it would be dairy free. It was delicious. Great recipe. I’ll use it with different fruit or even chocolate chips in a pinch. Fast and easy. Thanks for sharing!

This is excellent. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x 13 pan for 50 minutes. I added 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla and used butter in the topping. Don't over beat it if you use a mixer. Use all the blueberries. It's not dense. It's very moist and delicate. Great!

This cake turned out wonderfully.  Be careful to not overcook!  My only recommendations are to add 3/4 Tsp of Vanilla extract to the batter and double up on the crumb topping.

This recipe is very good. I was afraid there would not be enough bread for the 2 cups of blueberries, but the topping turns into a caramelized yummy breading also. Somehow my timer got shut off during the baking and I believe I cooked longer then suggested, but it was superb. I did use frozen blueberries that I thawed and drained the extra juice from. Next time I think I will cut back by blueberries to 1 1/2 cups. This was great with vanilla ice cream, and also with coffee the following day!

pretty tasty recipe.  I did make the changes others suggested (subbed butter for margarine and added tsp vanilla).  I also added more than a "dash" of salt, more like a half tsp, which really enhanced the overall flavor. Also, rather than 2 1/2 tsp of baking powder, I used 2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda.  all I had was partially frozen blueberries, so I added an additional 1/4 c flour and I had to increase the baking time to a total of 55 minutes and I had to crank up the heat for the last 10 minutes to 400 degrees.  the result was fully cooked, moist inside, green cake (darn frozen berries!) and a wonderful crumble on top.

I Made by replacing the margarine with the butter and use half white/half dark brown sugar in the streusel.
A question: what did you use to mix the ingredients for both the batter and the streusel ?
Thank you!
Anyway, the cake was Very good, a little bit elastic.

I had some blueberries that I needed to use so I selected this recipe.  I did tweak it just a bit.  I added ½ t. of vanilla and tossed the berries in flour just before adding in the hopes that they wouldn’t sink to the bottom of the cake.  I also added 1/3 cup of chopped pecans to the topping, which was a nice addition.  Rather than the 9” square pan, I used a 9” springform pan.  I sent this with Hubs to share with some of his buddies and they loved it!

A delicious, moist coffecake-like treat that was very simple to put together.  Oh.....and it has great flavor.  We really enjoyed the crusty topping on the cake.  I used frozen blueberries, in the frozen state, in the recipe without any problems.  A definite way to brighten a Monday, or in our case a Sunday. :o)  Thank you Heidi, for sharing your recipe.

Just made this today since I had fresh blueberries on hand, and it was absolutely delicious. In fact, my husband had two pieces while it was still warm. The ONLY change I did was to simply omit the cinnamon (my husband doesn't like cinnamon - please don't judge) and added about a teaspoon of vanilla in its place. Nothing else needed to be changed!!  Loved the sweetness of the topping to offset the slight tartness of the berries. The cake was moist enough without being dense; it was actually a soft cake-like texture but held together very well. I think I will try next time to use brown sugar in the topping instead of white for a different sweetness and texture. Always fun to experiment but not because the recipe needs it, just a personal preference. I did need to bake it a full 34 minutes in a 9" square pan but all ovens are different so be sure to start with the least amount of time to bake it and watch closely to not overtake so it won't get too dry. Will be using this recipe a lot!!

After making blueberry muffins for years, this is much easier and just as yummy! I do add a tsp. of vanilla, as others suggested, I've made it several times and it never lasts!

Love! Simple and yummy...even my husband who doesn't like blueberries likes it. I did sub margarine for butter in the topping and it worked great!

I just made this and had one piece hot out of the oven. The blueberries smelled so good I couldn't resist. As soon as that piece was gone I went for another! I made it exactly as directed except I used butter instead of oil in the batter and butter instead of margarine in the topping. Usually I add more fruit than called for in recipes but 2 cups was the perfect amount in this case and the amount of topping was generous also. It was soft and very flavorful. Not too sweet.

So, with all the berries I have, I doubled this using a 9.5 x 13.5.  The cup each, doubled amount, seemed too much for the topping; but I'd already started to went with it - except only used 1t cinnamon.  'Still cooling.  'Smells great.  So much topping though, you can't tell it's blueberry.  Used frozen berries & it was done in an hour.  Taste:  Good, not very good or better - only because I'm comparing it to Blueberry Buttermilk Coffeecake by BATA, which is awesome.  'Not sure if it's needing some butter (for flavor) or more sugar in the batter.  Some of that topping sugar should go in it I think.  It's light & good, but kinda eh.  'Doesn't wow ya into getting a second piece.

This is a GREAT recipe! I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan and it just barely fit! I added a splash of vanilla to the batter and used half brown and half white sugar for the crumb topping but otherwise followed the recipe as written. This will be my go to recipe for blueberry coffee cake. Thanks for sharing!

I made this a week ago for the first time and everyone LOVED it! The only change was that I added 1 tsp. vanilla. The topping had a strong cinnamon flavor which I liked but others may want to decrease it a little. I am making it again this week to take to a friends house.

This recipe is absolutely awesome as is.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for about 40 minutes.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is fantastic!! I only alternate the margarine with unsalted butter, and it turned out great, too. The cake is very moist, and the topper is crispy. The only little problem is that I can't bake the top evenly crisp. The center is already crisp while the side is still soft.

This is cake is delicious! The ingredients are simple, directions are easy, and the cake is delicious. Light, fluffy and not too sweet. I added the vanilla as another suggested, but it's probably good without. Great find! I'll make this again.

I thought the cake was a little dry. Any suggestions?  I would like to make this again, I love fresh blueberries!  The topping is good and crunchy.
