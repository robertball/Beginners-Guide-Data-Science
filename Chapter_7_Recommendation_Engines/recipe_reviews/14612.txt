Very Tasty, I made just a couple personal additions, while browning the meat I added minced garlic for additional flavor. I used 2 cups of chopped onions, and 2 cups diced tomatoes. It was delish! Next time I will use more meat and not dice the pieces so small. I served it with hot baked bagette bread, mmm...

This is a very good and tasty recipe. I too have added carrots for more color or peas instead of corn. I have also been pressed for time and cooked it on high on the crock pot for 4 hours or so. Crock pot are a wonderful invention and your recipe is proof!!

I found that this recipe was wonderful! I made a few changes and used veggies that I had on hand, mushroom, celery,onion,and a few carrots.  I added a little tomato sauce for extra flavor.  This recipe does need a little extra zing!  I used garlic salt, pepper, and basil.  Served it over egg noodles and the whole family loved it!  Really easy to throw together in the morning and forget about it until dinner!  Will make again!

THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN PLAIN OLD BEEF STEW. I ADD GARLIC, CARROTS, AND CANNED MUSHROOMS. I USE FROZEN CORN AND ADD FROZEN GREEN BEANS AT THE SAME TIME.  I AM MAKING RIGHT NOW FOR THE SECOND TIME.

This is nice but needs a bit of extra flavour. Also, I don't think the corn works in this recipe.
Solution: next time I'll add garlic and herbs, and use strong bouillon or wine instead of water. I'll also swap the corn for mushrooms.

We thought this was really tasty.  I did add carrots for flavor and I did leave out the corn as I am not a fan in soups/stews, but it was really nice.  I will make this again

It was perfect!  Every single ingredient came from our garden!!  We added peppers, carrots, fresh basil and parsley and didn't add the corn. We also used caribou meat that my uncle got for us!  All natural for sure!

Super easy!  Great results!  I cut the meat in strips, and cooked it only 5 hours - perfect!  Also, I didn't need to cook the stew 25 more minutes after adding the corn; after 5 minutes, the corn was hot.  I added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the flour - would do that again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Made as directed except did not peel the red potatoes, quartered them with the skin on, added veggie bouillon with the water, an extra onion, baby carrots and garlic salt.  The kids ate it all up with saltine crackers.

Was wonderful. I added a can of whole peeled tomatoes and basil and oregano to season it my family LOVED IT. I also used  a thin flank steak and did not cut them into small peices.

I made this for the first time yesterday and thought it was a bit bland.  My family ate it but thought it was just okay.  We like lots of flavor and this didn't really have it.  I did add garlic, carrots, mushrooms, and left out the corn.  Maybe someone can post ideas on how to spice it up.

I made this last night. Truthfully, my first stew either. I omitted the corn because I didn't have any. I also used a 28oz can of Italian style whole tomatoes. It turned our wonderous. I did put a little celery salt and garlic powder in the flour mixture. My husband and 2-year old both loved it and my son NEVER eats potatoes or tomatoes normally. This will be put on the menu rotation from now on.

This was a very good recipe that we will definitely have again.  I did add some celery and carrots just because I always put them in Swiss Steak.  I also added some salt and pepper when I put it in the crock pot and probably doubled the amount of tomatoes but only because I always throw extra veggies in soups and stews.  Very, very, very good!

Don't you hate those reviews that say, "This recipe was amazing!" yet go on to list all the ways they altered it? So how do you know if the original was good or not? Well, the first time I made this, I followed the original recipe exactly, so I can say with complete confidence that it was "just okay." My family and I found it to be quite bland. SO, armed with that knowledge, I went on to recreate the recipe in a way that would add more "pizzazz" to the final product. Here's what I did:
Added 4 cloves of minced garlic to the beef as I was browning it.
Added one cup each of diced carrots & celery.
Added one can of cream of mushroom soup.
Replaced the water with 1/2 cup of Marsala wine and 1/2 cup of beef bouillon.
Added one teaspoon each of freeze-dried basil and oregano.
At the end, I added 1/2 cup each of frozen sweet corn and frozen peas.
The final "tweaked" recipe was MUCH more flavorful...so much so that my family asked me to add it to the regular rotation.

I followed directions on this recipe but I found I should have added more liquid to it throughout the 7 hours that it cooked.  After 7 hours of cooking on low in slow cooker I found all the liquid dried up and parts of the dinner burnt on bottom of slow cooker.  It also needed more seasoning than the recipe called for, it was very bland.

Very good recipe.  I added peas and two sliced carrots in place of the corn.  The only thing I might change next time is to add more liquid - perhaps a cup of beef broth.  Overall this makes a wonderful hearty stew.

This was very easy but not a big hit with the fam.  Very bland.

"Just Like Mom's" is a term I use carefully, but this recipe deserves the title.  I made this last fall, and now that the weather has changed again, I am ready for more.  This was one of my favorite childhood dishes and Mom has lost her recipe, so I shared this one with her!  Excellent over egg noodles.  Thank you for sharing!

I omitted the corn since my family doesn't care for the vegetable.  I also browned the meat in a Presto Multi Cooker and then added the remaining ingredients instead of using a slow cooker.  This saved on time, as the stew was ready to eat in 2 hours.  The recipe was very easy to make and tasted great.

I added garlic.  It's a simple cold day meal with some crusty bread and spinach salad.
