I ate it on pasta, the first time I added mushrooms sauté in lemon juice and the second time I put broccoli instead. Both times tasted amazing. It's definitely my favorite pasta sauce. The sauce came out beige instead of white though.

Bold garlic flavor. This will go good on anything including vegetables.
