First of all thanks for a fantastic recipe!  My husband loves seafood and creamy sauces, so to begin I sautee some fresh shrimp and scallops in a pan just lightly seasoned with salt and pepper.  Once those are just done (do not overcook) I remove them from the pan (to be reheated in the sauce).

For the sauce, I cut the olive oil in half as per other reviews.  When I add the spices in the oil to heat; I have found that the longer you heat them the more flavor your sauce will take on.  I heat them for about 5 - 7 minutes (stirring often) before I add anything else.  I also add the wine before the tomatoe sauce to give the alcohol a chance to boil out.
I also cut the sugar out.  I guess this depends on your taste, but I find the sugar makes the sauce too sweet for us.  We like spicy/savoury food.  Once the cream has been added and starts to heat up I put my shrimps and scallops in the sauce and reheat(only a few minutes).  I toss this with Fettucini and I get RAVE reviews all the time!!

This sauce is FANTASTIC.  I made it for a food demo in a grocery store.  Everyone who tried it liked it.  I usually do not like what I make but as soon as I took one bite I knew this sauce was a winner.  I didn't bother with the peppers or onions.  Instead of pasta I had cut boneless, skinless chicken breasts into chunks; then I breaded the chunks in flour and oregano then sauteed the floured chicken chunks in olive oil.  After sauteeing the chicken, I prepared the sauce in the same pan.  I could not believe how good this sauce is.  I'll definitely make this again, and again, and again!!!

This is a family hit! I have made this recipe several times, using it as a sauce over lobster ravioli. My only recommendation is to add good quality wine before the tomato sauce, bringing it to a boil to evaporate off the strong alcohol flavor. It will also help to thicken the sauce.

YUMMY – very delicious!  A great blend of seasoning makes this sauce a definite keeper.    Plus, it’s very quick and easy to prepare.  I followed the previous reviewers’ advice and used 3 T. olive oil and 1 lb. Tortellini.  I also reduced the thyme to ¼ t., the sugar to 1 t. and the pepper flakes to just a dash or two (this sauce comes out quite spicy with the recommended ¼ t.).  Lastly, since tomato sauce comes in EIGHT oz. cans and heavy cream comes in EIGHT oz. cartons, I used the full 8 oz. of both and the sauce came out perfectly (hey, why have unnecessary leftovers?)  And speaking of leftovers, this sauce tastes EVEN better a day or two later.  I now can’t wait to make more!

With all the rave reviews, I'm a little surprised that we're not falling out of our chairs in delight with this recipe.  I'll make this again, but next time I'll cut the wine and sugar in half - there was just too much tang with the sweetness and alcohol taste for our liking.  (We used chardonnay, by the way.)  I will re-review this recipe after I try that.    By the way, I would say this only serves 2-3 as a main course.  The recipe reads that it serves six, but I can only see that in side-dish proportions.  

UPDATE:  The key to five stars is using a pinch of sugar , no wine, and a little less heavy cream (more like 4oz).  MUCH better that way.

I used fresh herbs left out the sugar and chicken bouillon as I needed it to be vegetarian. I used it on tortellini as suggested. Everybody loved it so much they were using bread to mop the last bit off their plate. Will make again. Thanks

I did not care for this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  While it is possible that my husband and I don't like sweet food and that is why we intensely disliked this, I think it has more to do with the fact that it was just not good!

Four stars bedause this is a good base for a rose sauce, but the seasoning is off, and more basil and marjoram works better than thyme. However, individuals can tweak the seasoning to their own taste. For those who didn't like the sweetness, note that the better (and more authentic way) to 'sweeten' a too acidic tomato based sauce is to increase the amount of ONION and sweat them down in the oil well at the beginning of the cooking.  Balance of sweetness is also dependent on the white wine used and DON'T leave it out if you want authentic rose sauce.  if you prefer a less "sweet" sauce, use a fruity pino grigio, not chardonnay which is much too assertive and astringent, or a blended white table wine.  If you do want a bit LESS acidic sauce use a slightly sweeter wine like a Riesling. It should definitely  be added in sooner rather than later, also, to mellow the flavor, before adding the cream.  Don't use a wine you would not drink -- especially not 'cooking wine' which is bad wine with salt added.  All that said, yes if you are not going to use more onions and (RED)bell peppers, then definitely cut back on the oil.  Using more of those two veggies will help incorporate the oil better.  Thanks for the recipe!

As per other reviewers, decreased the oil to 3 tbsp and omitted the red pepper flakes. My husband added the pepper flakes at the end. We also served with pieces of cooked turkey bacon and grated parmesan cheese. Also boiled the wine and the tomato sauce together to lighten the taste of the wine and because I am pregnant. Next time will decrease the sugar by half (this was way to sweet for us) and will use 4 cloves of garlic instead of 3. Will make again. Thanks for the good recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly (the first time) - Heaven!  This is the absolute BEST recipe I've found on allrecipes.com, and that is saying a LOT! I would eat it every night, if I could!  Great for regular week-night meals, and fabulous for company. It has a spicy kick to it, which is really wonderful.  After following the recipe once as-is, I found that the olive oil was way too much, and never stirred in completely... so now I cut it down to 2-3 TBLS. And I use fresh basil instead of dried. I'll also add some fresh chopped tomatoes if I have them.  I can't say enough about this recipe... if you haven't tried it - make it tonight! It's better than I've had at any restaurant. The pride of my recipe-book!

This recipe has wonderful flavors, however I thought the amount of oil and the amount of sugar was a bit much.  I did not use the amount of oil called for, but I did use the two tbsp of sugar and although we all liked the sauce, we felt it was a bit too sweet.  I will cut the sugar back a tbsp next time and add more red pepper flakes for a bit more spice.  All in all this is a very nice recipe that I will definitely use again with a few minor modifications. My husband thought this sauce would be good with Shrimp added.  May try that next time.

This is a great recipe! I added beef bacon pieces and smoked salmon. I had to substitute in sour cream for the heavy cream because I was out. Then, I poured it over a 7 cheese tortellini.
It was a HUGE HIT!! Served with a fresh salad for a quick & easy dinner.

Great recipe but too much oil and sugar. I used 3 tbls and that was still too much. I will use this recipe again and will likely use 1-2 tbls oil, no sugar, and 1/3 cup of a semi-sweet wine. I might a seafood likie crab or scallops. All in all, this is a very good recipe. Oh, make sure that you add the wine first and the cream last...otherwise it separates a little.

This tastes a little like tomato soup from a can doctored up a bit.  I followed the directions except for using a bit less thyme and red pepper flakes, otherwise, followed exactly.  I think it would be better with petite diced tomatoes instead of the sauce but otherwise it was ok.  I think I'll stick with my recipe for Linguine with Shrimp and Tomatoes recipe here on AR.

I think that this is a good sauce but I didn't like the flavor of the thyme in it.  For me, it overpowered the sauce.  I will try this recipe again without the thyme.

This was quite tasty!  I did make a heavy cream substitution because I did not have heavy cream, the only fault I found with doing this is that the butter made the dish greasy.  Maybe next time, I'll leave the butter out and just use milk or try it made with buttermilk.  I always have dry buttermilk in the fridge and don't ever buy heavy cream.  I made this a couple of nights ago and I am wanting to make more.  I do think the sauce could have used a small amount of flour to bind everything together a little bit more, but it could be that the butter (grease) was causing it separate.  Overall....I really enjoyed it!

This sauce is addictive!  I need a 12-step program for it.  Excuse me as I lick the bowl so I do not miss a drop of this sauce.  Did I mention I really like this sauce?  I just added this to my family favorites folder.      I followed the directions until the tomato sauce.  I substituted spaghetti sauce for that, and then substituted a light alfredo sauce for the heavy cream.  I served it with tortellini.  Excuse me while I go into my Sauce Rosee coma now.

I made a couple of minor adjustments - red pepper instead of green and light cream instead of whipping cream. This makes enough sauce for the family package of refrigerated tortellini. Lots of sauce and quite tasty too.

This is my first time making a rosee sauce, and I just loved it. It was very quick and easy. I made it for New Years Eve and my guest also loved it. The only change I did was halved the sugar and did not add wine. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Really good flavor!  We enjoyed it, but didn't like the crumbly/hard texture of the dried herbs in the smooth sauce.  Next time, I'm going to use fresh herbs, and I think it will be a home RUN!

I had to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand (milk instead of cream; water + 2 chicken bouillon cubes in place of wine/chicken soup base). Because I had to use milk instead of cream, I ended up thickening the sauce just slightly. I used about 1 tsp cornstarch and a few drops of cold water and dissolved in a small bowl, then added a few spoons of the hot sauce to it to temper, then added all back to the sauce pot and cooked until the consistency had thickened just a bit and was perfect. 

This is an excellent sauce. So nice in warmer weather when you don't want a heavy, meaty sauce. Thanks for sharing your recipe, YGBELAND - we love it!

I omitted the sugar. I don't think you need that unless your tomatoes were too acidic. I also didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I used a dash of cayenne pepper instead. I think it gave it a spicy kick without overpowering any of the other flavors. This sauce is delicious! I used it over tortellini noodles.

Did not like this recipe -- was looking for a more subtle/delicate flavor and just felt this recipe was too strong for an authentic rose sauce.  Tasted more like a pungent vodka-type sauce.

Great recipe, I doubled the pepper flakes and omitted the white wine (I didn't have any in the house) and I also used crushed tomatos instead of tomato sauce.  Nice and spicy, my husband and I loved it.  Served with crusty french bread and a side salad, just as good as a restaurant, if not better!!

We loved it - I also found a little thin so I had to thicken it - but it was definitely a keeper.

I agree that this was a restaurant quality recipe.  It also went together very quickly.  Our only complaint was that the sauce was a bit thin.

Very tasty indeed! It was a tad too sweet but that's a personal preference. Overall very delicious and easy to put together. Great weeknight treat. Thank you for a simple yet tasty recipe!

Yes, yes! My husband loved this, and the rest of our family(including young kids) thought it was good, too. My only issue was that there was WAY too much oil. I think next time I will halve it.

I made this recipe, but with a few adjustments after reading the reviews below.  I made for four and EVERYONE LOVED it.
Instead of 6 tablespoons olive oil I did 3.  I did 3 tablespoons onion. I used a red pepper instead of green. I did only 1/2 tablespoon sugar. I added 1 tablespoon of flour to thicken the sauce.  I also added a cup and a half of halved cherry tomatoes and 1 cup of peas. I really think that spruced this recipe up. Made it look really good too. I served with cheese tortellini, but also thicker homemade spinach fettuccine from an Italian grocery store. absolutely delicious. I highly recommend

As it stand we find this just too sweet so cut back on the sugar.  Otherwise great. I do feel we are in minority when it comes to "sweet" and nearly always have to adjust sauce recipes.

Loved this sauce.  I did make a few changes, but that was due to personal preference (added more garlic and red pepper flakes and cut sugar in half) and what I had on hand (fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream).  Also, I added the wine with the tomato sauce as others had suggested to give the alchohol time to burn off.  I sauteed some shrimp and spinach to add to the tortellini, and it was delicous.

Was delicious and really easy to make! Ingredients are those you would usually have on hand.  Has full taste  to satisfy most palletes.  I used stewed tomatos (blended) as opposed to tomato sauce which made it a lighter sauce which we prefer.  Will become one of our family favs!

This recipe is fast , easy, and extremely delicious. I didn't have everything so I improvised - instead of bell pepper, tomatoe sauce, & chick. soup base - I added 1 tomatoe on the vine and 14 oz stewed tomatoes. I had PIAT D'OR wine still from Xmas so I tried that - good thing I didn't add the suger until tasting. Very sweet! Next time I will use a Grigio wine (which is dry and 0 sweetness) and I can't wait - I know it will be perfect! I'll let you know.

This sauce was good! Mine didn't turn out quite perfectly, but not through the fault of the recipe. My stove just likes to burn things (like the herbs and garlic, and the tomato sauce sizzled as well) even when on low heat. It turned out better than I thought though, I was afraid the sauce would taste of burnt herbs but it was fine. I did make some slight changes, including omitting the green pepper and the onion (my brother won't eat onion-y sauce), adding about 1/4 cup of parm to help thicken it, and I didn't measure the amounts of tomato sauce or cream, so I'm not sure how much I added. I also agree with another reviewer's suggestion to add the white wine with the tomato sauce, rather than with the cream, so that more of the alcohol cooks off. I also took the suggestion of a few others and reduced the amount of oil, to about 4 tbsp, and I think when I make again, I'll put even less oil. But overall, yum!

This recipe tastes very similar to one I've been making for years but this is the first time I used green pepper. My family thinks it tastes better with the pepper. I only used 1 teaspoon of sugar, and I thought that was adequate.

This sauce is fabulous. I make it with farfalle and grilled, seasoned chicken breasts when I have guests. I love how fast and flavorful it is. 

I use dried minced onions and omit the bell peppers because I don't like the texture that they add to such a smooth, creamy sauce. I also use 8 ounces of cream and thicken it a bit with grated fresh parmesean. I strongly suggest using farfalle or rotini so that you get as much sauce as possible on each noodle.

A friend of mine and I made it for our husbands and we all loved it.  We followed the recipe almost exactly; we didn't use the chicken boullion because we were making it vegetarian and we didn't measure the wine so it was probably a little less than what was called for.  But it turned out perfect and thickened up very well.  We boiled it for a couple minutes after adding the cream so maybe that helped thicken it up.  Great recipe!

This was really good.  I used fresh herbs [obviously] a bit more and just infused the o.oil with them.  I also had some time so I made my own tomato sauce.  I would recommend that to anyone who has the TIME!  Then cooked down the t. sauce so it wasn't too runny!  I also cut the sugar down to a pinch, just used as a flavour enhancer.  ENJOY!!

This was a great sauce.  My husband loved it and it's hard to get a reaction out of him.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use fresh onion...I used dried.  I also didn't use the wine.  Yum!

Awesome! did it w/grilled chicken select a decent wine. that can make or break the sauce. We did cut back almost 1/2 on the liquids after our 2nd try and on other trys when time allowed, just let time help us to the desired liquidity.

I was disappointed in this sauce, from the reviews I expected better.  I took advice from others and cut the oil to 3T, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It wasn't bad, we just didn't care for the taste.  I doubt we'll be making it again.

We were originally going to have spaghetti when I found this recipe. It's now one of our favorites. Adding shrimp to it really added a very nice touch. We couldn't find any white wine in our house (it was Sunday, so we couldn't buy any alcohol), so we used white zinfadel instead. Despite that, it still turned out wonderfully. We're definately cooking this one again.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!  I had been looking for a good "pink" sauce for some time.  This is absolutely delicious!  Instead of doing only cheese tortellini, I also cooked and mixed portobello mushroom tortellini as well.  It was very good.

I used 1 lb of pasta and only 5 tbsp of oil and it was perfect!  Definitely a "make again"!!  ETA: Made another time with 4 T oil and fat free half and half.  It was runny so I definitely need to add some cornstarch to thicken.  Added in some cooked shrimp and the whole family loved it!

I’ve made this sauce probably 20 times and it is soooo good every time.  I don’t change it at all.  Sometimes I add shrimp, sometimes chicken, sometimes sausage and ravioli.  It’s good any way.  Love it!

I was concerned after looking for the negatives, and hearing some people just didn't like it.  I was a bit apprehensive, because Rose sauce from a restaurant around the corner is simply awesome- if people said they didn't like it surely it cannot be the Rose sauce I love.

This recipe didn't disappoint.  In fact it impressed.  I looked at the images and saw a bit of "broken" inconsistency.  But my recipe turned out amazing.

I used hunts Tomato  Sauce(Roasted Garlic)
I also used Wylers Chicken Bouillons w/ spices)
I used Moscato as my white wine.

It doesn't get much better than this. It will definitely be a dish I make for the rest of my life!

We really liked this sauce although I started with less olive oil (6 tbls. not necessary).  I tossed grilled chicken and penne with the sauce and it came out very nice.

This was a really good base recipe. I followed it almost exactly and would probably omit the sugar and use less bouillon next time. I may also try this recipe with less cream and add a diced tomato. We added chicken adouille sausage and made fresh pasta. This really worked well with with this sauce.

I didn't like this, but the boys did and so I would make it again for them. Subbed milk for the half&half and fusili pasta for the tortellini and added shredded chicken.

This was great! I made it with shrimp and fettucine. I, too, used less oil- about 4 tbsp. Put the wine in with the herbs for about 5 mins before adding the sauce. Delicious!

This recipe was delicious!  I did make a few changes because of the items I had on hand.  Instead of white wine I used a splash of tequila.  I sauteed shrimp with the vegetables. At the end, I also added snow peas. This was a real winner in our house.  Next time I might use less heavy cream since we are trying to watch out waist-line around here.

Tasty sauce. I had to sub half and half for heavy cream, but it was still pretty good. I omitted the wine and just used a pinch of sugar and it was sweet enough for our taste. The kids loved it and I thought it was ok. I would probably make it again.

Fantastic addition to my Pasta dishes.  Was refreshing to make my own sauce.  I used a Chicken Italian Sausage and it was Great. Next time I will reduce sugar by 1/2.  Well done!

Delish!  I typically do not care for sweet sauces, so I did reduce sugar to a pinch as suggested.  My chardonney added just the right amount of sweetness.  I reduced the wine as well as suggested by other reviewers.  Served it will meat filled tortellini, cracked pepper and parmesan.  Wonderful!  Thank you.

Awesome!! Had to substitute some things I didn’t have on hand---half and half for the cream, tomato paste for the sauce and concentrated buillon instead of soup base. It was very good and even got an applause from my picky 13yo son.

This sauce is tha bomb!!! Now one of my AR favorites. Yes, the sauce is a little oily but most delicious pasta sauces are. You could easily scale down to 4T. oil and it would still be good.

This sauce is incredible. Honestly, I made this for my boyfriend, who usually hates everything prepared in a creamy sauce, and even he was impressed! I am a big fan of rose sauce in general myself, and was so impressed with the base of this sauce I almost didn't want to add the cream in. I would recommend this to recipe to everyone, especially someone on the fence about rose sauce - this will likely win them over.

My new go-to recipe! Its quick and delicious! Use less wine and add it when you add the sauce so the alcohol can cook off. I also added 2 tbsp parmesan and a bag of spinach during the cooking process to thicken the sauce. It seems like a lot of spinach but it will cook down. Thanks for the AWESOME recipe that even my kids will eat!!

This was really good. Because many complained of the sauce being too thin and runny I added a can of tomato paste and it was perfect. This one's a keeper.

A good base sauce.  I had fresh basil on hand, so I used that instead of dried.  I only used 3 tbs. of oil and half and half instead of heavy cream. Added 1/4 c. parmesan cheese. The only thing I would change is to use 1/4 c. of wine next time.  I added the amount recommended (1/2 c.) before the tomato sauce and boiled some off, but it was still too wine-y.   All in all, a good recipe to experiment with.

We loved it!!  I was nervous after reading the review from above, but we thought is was great and we would definitely make it again.  I would follow the advice of a previous reviewer and add the wine in the beginning to allow it to cook off some of the alcohol flavor and to thicken it up a bit.  If you like wine sauces, you'll like this!

I had a craving for tortellini in rosee sauce with sausage after having it at a local restaurant. This recipe did not disappoint! I browned the sausage in the olive oil and herb mixture, then removed the sausage and added the wine to let it reduce for a bit. I then followed the recipe, adding my cut up sausage before the cream after having let them sit for a bit to let the juices settle. I used a mixture of sweet and hot italian sausage. This was the best pasta dish I've made at home ever and will be my go to meal. It's easy, not too expensive to prepare, and very tasty.

Needed double basil, and oregano and triple garlic. I also added a little more sugar and placed in food processor to smooth. Final result good.

I made this dish almost as written, added sauteed shrimp in mine and grilled chicken for my BF and son. I do not like green peppers, so skipped adding them to the dish. My sauce thickened perfectly and coated the tortellini without a problem. I loved this dish. Unfortunately I was the only one, my BF and son did not care for the sauce. I would make again and they can fend for themselves next time

I loved this recipe. I think it would make a great cream of tomato soup when not thickened.  As it was, it thickened up nicely and my husband raved about it.  Thanks!

The directions say nothing about adding some of the ingriedients so i added them to the beginning. I added the wine after the herbs to deglaze the pan. i only had prego spagetti sauce on me which turned out to be fabulous. i also used a chablis white wine. and sauteed chicken in another pan then transferred it when done. this is a very good sauce.

Loved this recipe.  It was easy to make, quickly made and tasted wonderful.  I didn't have any white wine on hand so I did without it.  I was really impressed.

Excellent!  I used red peppers instead of green, and added some leftover rotisserie chicken I had.  I am not a cook by any means, but even I could make this.  My husband loved the sauce too.  He wants  it on every meal now.

This was really good.  I omitted the thyme because we don't like it and substituted water for the wine.  Next time I will omit or reduce the amount of red pepper flakes.  I found it spicy, but my husband loved it.  We decided to compromise for next time and he can sprinkle the flakes on at the table.  I served with breaded veal cutlets.

This was such a yummy sauce to use with pasta.  It was creamy and full of flavor.  My husband loved it he took leftovers to lunch the next day and bragged to everyone that I made it.  Definetely a favorite.

Love this recipe. I reduce the whipping cream to half and then add milk to substitute, for lower fat option. It still turns out great, but not as good as the full fat version. I also use red pepper instead of green pepper.

This was a great recipie.  I made it again, cut down on the oregano, added more onion and left out the green pepper (I was out of them that day).
It tasted a lot more mellow and better blended.  The tomatoe sauce comes in a can that would leave you with an extra ounce.  I went ahead and dumped the whole thing in..it didn't make a difference.  I prefer to serve with Rotelli pasta because it holds more sauce.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband.  I will be making it for company next time.  I made it exact to the recipe and would not make any changes next time.  I agree it is similar to a vodka sauce.

This recipe was very good.  Almost like a blander Vodka sauce.  I thought the amount of olive oil was a little excessive though, and will probably cut that in half next time.  Thanks!

The author doesnt promise too much, this is really something out of a good itallian restaurant. At the beginning it looks a little bit dangerous, but at the end after constant stirring the sauce not only tastes but looks good too. The sugar is not included in the cooking procedure, just throw it in together with the other herps.

I'll bet it would taste a lot better without all the added sugar.  Two tablespoons of sugar made it way too sweet.

We loved this sauce!! I served it over tortellini and it was a big hit.  I can't wait to serve it to guests (finally found a way to impress them with my cooking)  I did cook it down a little at the end because it was a little thin.  Thanks Yves!

The first time I made it, I fell in love, even though it was extremely oily.  The second time, I cut WAY back on the olive oil, and man oh man... it's awesome.  My husband and I love this as a splurge meal (few and far between unfortunately!)  but even with the fat and calories it's worth it.  Quick and delicious. We serve it over cheese stuffed tortellini. mmmmmmmmmmm!

Very good. I followed recipe except cut down the olive oil and reduced to 1/2 T sugar, per other reviews. We really enjoyed this. I served a family of 5 - 3 adult portions & 2 kids. Felt I needed more, so next time I will double the recipe.

I created an account just to rate this sauce. It is SO good. I made it attempting to replicate a dish i love from an italian restaurant with black squid ink pasta. I forgot i didnt have oregano, so that was left out on accident. Per the other reviews, I reduced the oil to 4 tablespoons. I added lump crab to the sauce and also sauteed shrimps, scallops and added mussels at the end. I also didnt realize the chicken base was low sodium, so the sauce could've used a bit more salt. Also skipped the sugar afraid that it would be sweet instead of savory. All in all, delicious!!

I recommend simmering the wine a little before adding the cream, to let the alcohol evaporate out of there.  Otherwise, it tastes too much like wine.  Delicious recipe!  I put mine over Penne with leftover chicken my hubby grilled a couple of nights ago.  It was a great way to use leftovers.

The foundation of the recipe is amazing! I took some suggestions from others and used 3 tbsp of oil and omitted the thyme and added 1/2 tsp of marjoram instead. I also added a 1/4 tsp more of basil. I cut back on the heavy cream to 4oz and added about a 1/4 cup of parmesan and since I didn't have wine, I added about 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (amazing touch). I absolutely loved it! I will definitely make it again with the same adjustments.

This is one of my first sauces. I was trying to find something to go with some chicken tortellini. This was great. I did have to alter some things based on what I had. I decreased the olive oil to around 3T & used fresh basil since I had it. I left out the sugar because of other reviews & didn't have the soup base. I used 1 c. of whole milk instead of cream and used 1/2 c. of chardonnay. With all the changes it was fairly thin but I just simmered it until it was the thickness I wanted. Tasted great! Everybody asked for seconds! Thanks!

Great base recipe that I will use again with the changes that I made.   I did cut the oil in half, as suggested by some.   I cubed chicken breast and tossed in a bag with flour, salt and Italian seasoning.   Then I browned in the hot oil.   I set aside, deglazed the pan with water and added in more oil as necessary.   I added in the wine at the same time as the tomatoes.   I used Italian tomatoes instead of sauce and mashed them.   I also added a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste.    After sauce was made, I did thicken the sauce a little.   Tossed in the tortellini and chicken and served as is.   The base recipe probably needed none of these changes, but I felt that my changes add a bunch.   Thank you for giving me the head start on this.

I read the reviews before making this and was a little worried.  I cut the oil and sugar in half, and switched to 2 tsps of Italian spice mix instead of measuring out all of the individuals. I served on top of potato gnocchi, garnished with Parmesan cheese and had asparagus on the side.  me and my family all enjoyed it very much.  the sauce was everything I expected it to be and I am very happy I tried it. would def have this again

This was AMAZING! All four of my kids and hubby loved it! I was ready to suck up this sauce with a straw. I made it as the recipe states only adding the wine at the same time as the tomato sauce to cook down the alcohol. I did omit the sugar due to the fact that I had a sweet wine not dry. I over ate and can't wait til I can make this again! Thank you so much for this GREAT recipe!!!

This could possibly be the best pasta sauce I have ever tasted! Ate it with prawns on linguine. Doubled the recipie and that only made 4 good sized dinners. Not sure how it could have served 12? Maybe we use more sauce than average? Oil could be halved and I added 2tbl of flour (for double recipie) to thicken at end because it was too runny.

Decent recipe, but requires a few crucial changes: I got by with only 1 - 2 tbsp of olive oil…6 seemed like way too much; replace tomato sauce  with  tomato puree since tomato sauce already has salt, spices, herbs and sugar added….i think this is why so many complain of this recipe being too sweet; add wine to veg and cook off the alcohol before adding the tomato puree; use fresh parsley if you can and add just before adding the cream...dried parsley has almost no flavor, but i do think that dried thyme, oregano and basil work better for this recipe; probably goes without saying, but add salt and pepper to taste

This was very tasty. The whole family loved it over 3 cheese tortellini. I didn't have any wine, thyme, red pepper flakes or chicken bouillon so I left them out and substituted the chicken bouillon with an equal amount of salt. I also reduced the sugar to a tsp per other reviewers' suggestions. Even stripped down it was delicious.

I was alone for dinner after the kids went to bed, and had a craving for Rose sauce. Luckily, I have the All Recipes app and I found this sauce. It was FANTASTIC! I did make some small adjustments: I left out the sugar and wine, and subbed 3/4 cup milk for the cream. I used linguine instead of tortellini. It was so easy and quick, plus I have some left for tomorrow (and going to give some to the kids as well. I'm sure they'll love it!) Thank you so much, this is going to be a staple from now on!

WAY TOO MUCH OIL, a little heavy on the sugar, and runny.  If you get past that, it is a flavorful sauce.  The thyme gave it a different flavor than what you'd expect in a sauce.

After reading the rateing I think the key to this is adding the wine AFTER cooking the onions green peppers and garlic. Great recipe.

The flavour was delicious, but I find if you add the white whine after you simmer the spices in oil, and let it boil down, you get the full flavour impact but a thicker sauce. Very nice.

Everyone loved this. I eliminated sugar and green pepper cut oil in half and used fresh Italian parsley and Basil. I have made alot of pasta sauces and my family told me this was my best yet. Without the cream this would make an amazing marinara sauce as it tasted incredible without the cream as well.

Oh my gosh!  This was incredible!  Made exactly per the recipe except added the wine before the tomato sauce to let the alcohol cook off.  Served over chicken mozarella ravioli, but we could eat this sauce on anything!

Incredibly tasty and not too difficult - just make sure you have everything lined up before you start. I like to cook about a pound of chicken first and throw it in with the sauce and noodles at the end.

The recipe was a good stepping stone for me.  I eliminated the green pepper and increased the onion to a whole med. onion.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used 4 ozs. of tomato paste and 1 cup of warm water.  Used half & half instead of heavy cream.   We really liked it with the changes.  Maybe next time I will make it as directed.

Not crazy about this one. Tried it on tortellini and found it was at first too sweet, and then the wine overpowered it. It was also a bit thin. It may work better as a sauce on a chicken dish, perhaps, but not as a pasta sauce.

Fantastic sauce. I too omitted the sugar. It doesn't need it at all. I also messed up and accidentally put 14oz of tomato sauce in it so I attempted to double everything. The entire family LOVED this. Even my picky 10yr old. We wanted to lick our plates. I will definitely make this again.

Fabulous!! Tastes like restaurant quality. Per other recommendations, I made using only 1/4 c olive oil and brought wine to boil in separate saucepan then added.

A little too runny. I'll reduce the oil next time. Great flavor!

Used one bag med shirt and cooked till bright pink while boiling water, omitted sugar (we don't like sweet sauces) and green pepper (doesn't agree) and only a pinch of thyme (introducing to my family I learned to add half of new spices to them or very limited) .... Also followed other comments by boiling wine first then tomato sauce. I also used fresh parsley, onion and garlic. Rather thAn dry (doubled parsley). I think we eat too much cooked for 6? And fed 3...

So good... I like to reduce the wine right after the the onion, garlic and peppers are done cooking, and also cut down on the sugar and pepper flakes (a pinch or two of each is lots).  Other than that, it's perfect.

Best rose sauce ever! Never having it at the restaurant again :) The sauce I made turned out a little sweeter cause I used a pretty sweet apple juice as a substitute for the white wine but it still tastes amazing, sweet spicy and savoury all in one ^.^

Wow, what a flavour-rich sauce, followed to a T except for using fresh basil and thyme and used red wine (reduced amount) instead.  Delicious!  First time I had ravioli with no need to add parmisan. This is a keeper!

I prepared it exactly as per instructions. It is amazing!  My son said that it was way better than the sauces he's had in expensive restaurant dishes.  I tasted the sauce mixture before adding the heavy cream, it was amazing!  I will definitely keep this recipe "as is" and make many times, but I'm going to try a different dish and prepare it without the heavy cream and wine to mix with some pasta.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

I had a pound of cheese tortillini so I doubled the sauce as well.  Ended up having a lot of sauce - enough for an additional pound of gnocchi, as well.  I did not add the sugar nor wine.  It was on the thin side, so I thickened it with corn starch/water.  Topped with grated cheese. We loved it!  I'll make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a 99% score! The only reason I can't give it 100% is because I've never exactly followed it to the letter. At the end of Step 1 in the recipe I add and brown about the equivalent of 1 minced Italian Sausage per person (in the ingredient list above make it 3/4 per head - I find spicy-sausage sometimes overpowers so be careful).  Remove from casing first of course. I did use sugar the first time but found it negligible and I don't need any extra unnecessary sugars. I do add a 1/2 tsp of Marjoram to the seasoning in Step 1; just my preference. The final difference is that I find this recipe goes well with either Rigatoni or Penne. This recipe is all about the sauce so I want a pasta that can deliver large portions of sauce per-bite. Friends / family etc... are stunned by the quality of this meal when they have it. Thank you!

Wow and wow again!  So frustrating to make new recipes that everyone raves about that we don't like!  Finally, this was a winner!  It's was super delicious and easy to make.  I used both shrimp and cheese tortellini.  Will definitely serve with garlic bread to soak up the yummy sauce.  Definitely a meal to make for dinner parties as well! *** One update... I have made this recipe about 20x.... after you cook onion and green pepper, ADD  THE WINE... and let is cook down; then add in your tomato sauce, etc.  The last time I made this I forgot and added wine to recipe at end and it did not turn out as yummy.

I re-read the recipe thinking that I must have forgotten something, b/c I found it a little boring.  I think maybe a little lemon juice or zest would've helped.  I added sliced sausage, and still didn't get that "bam."  Anyways, the only change i made was I skipped the sugar.  O, and I halved the oil like the reviews suggested.

Absolutely delicious. I boiled the wine before adding the tomato sauce like another viewer suggested. I also added a few tablespoons of cooking creme to taste and some parmesan cheese before serving. I also added sugar to taste. Absolutely delectable, will make again.

I think the recipe has great potential with a few tweaks. I agreed with other reviewers that the wine needs to be boiled for awhile to reduce the strong alcohol taste. I also agree that the thyme flavor was overpowering. And lastly the sauce was a bit thin. Perhaps less thyme and less wine? I served with chicken and motzarella ravioli.

I loved this sauce. I made it as written except for cutting down the olive oil to 3 tbsps. Since I'm eating a low carb diet, I grilled some shrimp and laid it on a bed of fresh, raw spinach and poured some of this sauce on top with a few grinds of black pepper and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese. It was absolutely delicious. I have some left for tomorrow in the fridge and I'm having a hard time refraining from going and eating it by the spoonful. Thank you so much for the brilliant recipe!

I made a double batch and I cut in half the olive oil.  I like my food a little spicy so I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper for just a mild hint of hot.  I added shrimp and served over spaghetti topped with parmesan with garlic bread on the side.  Great cream sauce.

Fantastic recipe! We substituted some liquid beef stock for the chicken bouillon, and used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes (because we didn't have any) and it still came out wonderfully. Also added some baked fish on the side for protein. Felt easy to make, and had just the perfect combination of sweetness and savoury italian flavours. Will definitely make again!

This is great! I made it with shrimp and spinach tortellini. I cooked the shrimp with a little olive oil and salt and pepper and took them out of the pan. Only used 4 table spoons of olive oil. Omitted the sugar. Added the wine before the tomato sauce, brought it to a boil and then added the tomato sauce and bring that to a boil. Tossed everything together at the end. Delicious! You can really put this on any pasta! I didn't cut up the pepper small enough so next time I am going to make sure it is very fine.

This was a good recipe, I did add about 2tsp of grated parmesean cheese. I made homemade raviolis and served the sauce on top. I think it would be great with some lump crab meat over the pasta and then add the sauce on top. That is what I think was the missing ingredient.

This was so good.  For such a simple sauce it packed a lot of flavor.  The only thing I didn't add was the green pepper because of personal preference and I'm not sure you even need it.  I used a little less cream because that was what I had left and probably only used about 1/4 C of white wine.  I poured it in until I got the desired consistency.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again.

Even my 3 year old daughter ate this!  But I added 1/2 tbl of butter, reduced the white wine to 3 tbl, increased the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp and added 3 tbl each of grated parmesan and mozarella cheeses to the sauce.

Made this last night & we all liked it (even the kids!). I did make some changes basically for preference. I omited the onion, pepper, pepper flakes & sugar. After reading reviews the sugar didn't seem like it had to be in there. Instead of the sauce, I used a can of tomato paste with a 1/2 can of water. I did add the wine after the garlic like some suggested. It was a very tatsy sauce & I served it over tortellini as a side dish to pork chops! Will definitely make again!

Excellent, easy recipe. I popped it in a slow oven for a few hours after stirring in some cooked chicken pieces. My guests and hubby raved.

This was the most amazing sauce I've ever tasted!  It was quick to make, and tasted like...heaven.  It was also fun drinking the Moscato I put into it while cooking.  It had a little heat, but it blended well with the other flavors.  As it cooled it was a little difficult not to get Thyme stuck in my teeth--I would try to grind this or use fresh next time (and reduced).  Otherwise, perfect perfect perfect!!! (Oh, and I used the suggestion to boil the wine a bit before adding the tomato sauce and chicken base, and only added a dash of sugar instead of the full tablespoon, as another reviewer suggested)

I found this dish very easy to prepare and absolutely wonderful. If you are concerned with consistency don't be. I was a little worried about it at first but after i mixed in the pasta everything seemed fine, also it does thicken upon cooling. My only problem was finding a way to use the other 2, 1/2 cups of wine ;)

Very tasty and easy to put together.  Tasted like we were dining at a fine restaurant.  I used half & half instead of cream.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee.  Will make this again for sure!! :)

This is a fabulous recipe and is loved by all in this household. I follow it exactly with one exception of using tomato paste and a bit of water instead of tomato sauce.

This sauce was pretty good, but not fantastic. I felt like despite the amount of spices in the dish it was still somewhat bland. I followed the recipe exactly except that I let it cook a little longer to thicken the sauce up a bit. I thought it was good, but not something I would make on a regular basis.

A good creamy tomato sauce. I left out the chicken soup base because I wasn't sure what it was. The sauce was very flavourful and went great with pasta.

We just did not like this sauce.  For some reason my sauce didn't get very thick and I followed the directions exactly.  One thing I was confused on was the recipe asks for sugar but doesn't say where to add it so I didn't.  Don't know if that could have been the cause.  BF didn't like it either, I probably won't make this again.  Sorry.

it was a great sauce, but the recipe calls for some sugar, but never has it in the directions.  I never added any and it was rich enough.

This was good!  I doubled the recipe, and cut out the herbs I didn't like.  My sauce didn't thicken much, but it was tasty.  Was really good with cheese tortellini and shrimp.

I just made this for dinner and it was simply spectacular.  My husband is still raving about it.  I used 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes and half & half instead of heavy cream.  It was  delicious and nice and creamy.  I also used meat tortellini.

I used only what spices I had on hand (Italian herb, basil and parsley) and about half the suggested cream.  Also did not have wine but the sauce was absolutely wonderful!

It was my first time trying rosee sauce and  the recipe turned out pretty good. 
I added the wine and reduced it before adding the tomato sauce, I also added a bayleaf in and let the sauce simmer for a bit.
I rated this a 4 cause I couldn't get it to thicken enough.

I think I could eat this sauce everyday!  I have used it with tortellini as well as other pastas.  Even added kielbasa once and it was fantastic.  Definitely a keeper.  I don't have any chicken soup base so just used some boullion.

I make this different everytime! I love it. I'd suggest using linguine noodles instead of tortellini and instead of a cooking wine use a good white wine, you would be surprised at how much more flavor you get out of the sauce.

Wow!!  This is the first 5 star for me!  My husband and I loved it.  I also added wine before the tomato sauce as others have posted and thickened the sauce with parmesean cheese.  I also decreased oil to 3T.  Thanks!

I really really love this sauce. I do find it very runny so next time I will add some flour to it while it is just the oil and herbs... so that it will thicken it up a bit. I just used 3 TBsp oil as the other reviews said and that was perfect... I also cooked the wine (burgundy cooking wine) a bit before I added the tomato sauce to cook out the alcohol. The taste of this dish is superb! I served it over spiral noodles and added some fried italian sausage after it was cooked! Yum! Yum!

Taking advice of the other reviewers, I cut the oil in half, and deglazed the pan with wine before adding the sauce.  The second time I made this, I used whole milk instead of cream, and I don't think it changed anything except calories.  I didnt use sugar either time I made this, as I was worried it would make the sauce sweet.

I'm always looking for recipes that use tomatoes without a ton of cheese. This recipe was flavorful and easy. (You can easily cut the amount of oil in half though...) I loved the idea of pan roasting dried herbs...great! We added chicken and used roasted garlic instead of 'regular'. The recipe omits when the sugar should be added but I figured it would be with the tomato sauce - which we used a 14 oz. can (more than the recipe calls for, but worked out well)- of diced tomatoes after a few pulses in the food processor. Using half/half instead of heavy cream was fine too. Definitely adding to our list of menu favorites!

This was a fantastic sauce recipe!  I took the advice of a few other reviewers and cut the sugar in half to 1/2 TBS.  I also added more garlic and onions, cut the thyme in half to 1/4 tsp., and cut the olive oil in half to a little over 3 TBS.  I put in an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and an 8 oz. carton of heavy cream, and it was perfect!  I cooked up some frozen portabella mushrooms stuffed in spinach ravioli shells, topped them with this excellent sauce in an oven-safe baking dish, and covered the whole concoction with shredded Italian cheese to bake for a few minutes.  The result was intoxicatingly wonderful!  This was a perfect mixture of flavor that went flawlessly with the ravioli (or would go well with most other stuffed shells).  I'd give it 10 stars, if I could.  Definitely on par with Italian restaurant quality, and definitely a keeper in our family's recipe book.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!
