I've made this recipe twice so far.  The first time I made it as is and it was very "loose," even after refrigerating overnight.  The second time I used one cup of milk and one cup of heavy cream to mix with the chocolate pudding, rather than just milk.  My hand-mixer got bogged down a little bit, but the heavy cream gave the chocolate layer a much better consistency...more like a cheesecake.  Although the taste was awesome the first time, having a stiffer consistency the second time around made the taste even better.  I also topped the pie with whipped topping the second time.  I think that breaks up the richness/heaviness of the pie a little and also makes it looks much better.  Guests told me that they've bought peanut butter pies that weren't as good as this one.  I don't care much for peanut butter, but I just finished off the pie while writing this review!  AWESOME!

I have no idea where my mind was the evening I made this pie, but what could have been a total disaster came out just fine.  First mistake.  I used the whole 8 oz of cream cheese.  Not to worry! I spread the mixture not just on the bottom of the pie crust, but up the sides as well, then reserved the remaining mixture.  Second mistake.  I knew I had chocolate pudding, so, I poured the 2 cups of milk into the measuring cup, got the pudding, only to discover it was Cook & Serve, not instant.  After looking at the clock, realizing the stores were closed and saying a few choice words my momma never taught me, I decided to try something.  I drank a quarter cup of milk (yes, I poured it into a glass first) then filled my measuring cup back to the 2 cup mark with chocolate syrup, and used 2 boxes of instant vanilla pudding. Then I took 3 of the 4 peanut butter cups (I ate one with my quarter cup of milk) took my frustration out on the peanut butter cup by chopping them up pretty small, mixed them with the reserved mixture and put spoonfuls on top of the pie. I held my breath when I served it at a dinner, and everyone raved about the pie.  I mean a good rave. My husband said it was one of the best mistakes I had ever made, so I am sure the pie, made the way it should be, would be excellent, because this was.

This pie was very delicious and you can't take just one bite of it! The only reason I rated it a 4 was because the peanut butter layer had too strong of a cream cheese taste. Next time I might add more p.b., or use a lighter cream cheese. Definitely try this recipe out!

This was so easy & it is so delicios! (But, I must warn you all that it is a bit on the rich side)...I followed this recipe exactly except that I used 1 cup of milk & 1 cup of half-and-half to make the chocolate layer. This helped it be more custard-y & a little less like just plain-old-chocolate-pudding. Love this recipe...will make again! :D

Something is terribly wrong with this recipe.  I used exactly what is called for in the ingredients list.  After spreading the creamed mixture into the 9" pie crust, there was very little room left for the pudding topping.  I went ahead and proceeded with the directions anyway and sure enough, the pudding mixture would not fit on the pie.  In desperation, I put everything in the fridge and hopefully will be able to scoop the rest of the pudding on top of the pie once everything sets.  I even double checked the size of the pie crust and it was 9" as stated on the label.  I don't know how all of you got everything to fit in your pie crusts.

Very Rich!!!.  I made the recipe as is with just a few small changes.  I made this in a springform pan with an crushed oreo base (I crush oreo's and add butter to help them stick together). Next I spread on the peanut butter layer.  I forgot to add the sugar in this layer but I didn't misss it.  I then stuck an oreo half in the peanut butter layer all the way around the inside edge of my springform pan.  Next I layered on the chocolate layer.  I used whole milk and my pudding mix was REALLY thick.  I stuck these layers in the freezer for about 30min to allow everything to set well.  I topped the pie with whipped cream and sprinkled crushed oreo's on top.  This made for a very rich dessert with a nice presentation.  I didn't have 4hours to let this sit in the fridge before serving it so I put it in the freezer for about an hour and it setup nicely.

Very good pie...was gone in less than 2 days! I added chopped chocolate-peanut butter cups on top of the peanut butter filling, then mixed chopped chocolate-peanut butter cups in with the pudding mix on top. Would probably be good with crunchy peanut butter, too!

I finally had to give some of this pie away because I kept heading to the fridge for a slice!  I also used cream instead of milk, and the pie had a fabulous consistency.  I made homemade whipped topping with the remainder of the cream, and piped it around the edges of the pie.  I then melted chocolate, and drizzled it over the whipped topping.  For a finishing touch, I sprinkled it with Reese's Peanut Butter Dessert Topping (which consists of chocolate sprinkles, and tiny chocolate and peanut butter chips).  I omitted the chopped peanut butter cups.  This pie looked like a professionally made one, and tasted better.  I can't say enough great things about it!  The person I gave the pie to was a little down at the time, and when I asked him if there was anything I could do, he said, "Just keep making peanut butter pies!"

My husband and children cannot get enough of this! I use more chopped up Reese's cups on the top than it calls for, and occasionally mix a few of them up in the chocolate layer.

Great recipe!  I used reduced fat peanut butter and sugar free/fat free pudding mix and it still tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful and easy pie.  I used a little less cream cheese then the recipe calls for and also used 1 cup milk & 1 cup heavy cream instead of the 2 cups milk called for (I didn't have time to wait for it to sit, plus helps it be nice and firm.)  I halved the peanut butter mixture cause it seemed too peanut buttery to me and also seemed to be too high of a pie.  I've made this several times with rave reviews.  Thanks for submitting it.

This was a hit. Sent a piece to my daughters co-worker and she thought it was from a fancy bakery. I made my own flour pie crust for it.

I made this for Easter dinner dessert & it was a hit!  The only changes I made were to put it in a chocolate graham crust, and I topped it with milk chocolate & peanut butter chips.  EXCELLENT!  My in-laws especially liked it.

Excellent.  I have made this pie three times.  The folks at work lined up at the door and gobbled it down. I substitued small Reese Cups in leu of cutting the larger ones.  Yummy!

I have made this pie many times and it's always a big hit.I do use a little more sugar in the peanut butter layer then what is called for because I think the peanut butter and the cream cheese seem to overpower the rest of the pie.The little bit more sugar seems to balance it out more.

This is a great pie! This recipe makes two pies though. The only thing I changed was I used whipping cream instead of milk for a thicker chocolate layer. I will be making this every year now in place of the regular chocolate pie.

This is a really good pie. The only reason it is rated four rather than five is that our family doesn't handle really rich flavor very well. If you like thick, richly flavored pies, this is the one for you!

This pie was awesome!  I used low-fat cream cheese.  I also used whole milk which I think makes the pudding layer just divine.  I chopped the peanut butter cups small and sprinkled on top for garnish.  It was a big hit as the dessert for a pizza party we attended. Thanks so much.  This one is a keeper.

Outstanding!  Made this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful.  I did not cut down the cream cheese, thankfully, because it was perfect.  I did use 1 cup millk (skim) and 1 cup half-n-half.  I put a layer of chopped reeses cups in between the PB and choc layers.  I was a little worried about the choc layer b/c it seemed so lumpy when I was trying to stir it up but it turned out great.  I used a large graham cracker crust and topped it with chopped reeses cups.  Will definately make again soon!!

A friend of mine and my boyfriends is very sick and can't/won't eat much food.  I made this pie for him, exactly like the recipe said, and he ate 1/2 the pie in about 2 hours!! This may sound silly about a pie, but it brought him a little happiness that he doesn't often have. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, I appreciate it more than you know!!!

Great pie that didn't last very long at a dinner party I went to. Followed the suggestions of using only 1/3 of a cream cheese block and I only used 1 packet of the pudding. Two would have been way to much filling. I also had some whip topping left over as I didn't need to use all of it to fill up the pie crust.

This was a HUGE hit on Christmas Eve.  Only suggestion I got was that it might be nice to have a crunchy layer in between the chocolate and peanut butter layers - maybe put crushed peanut butter cups in between the layers instead of on top?  I will try that next time.  It's very easy to make and delicious so I will be making it again!

Brought this to a dinner party and everyone raved about the pie.  I have even gotten several comments on how delicicous it was even months after the party.  It was very quick and easy to make, and I will definitely make again.  Word of caution, do not use whipped cream in a can to decorate unless you plan to serve it right away because it melts even when refridgerated.

this was awesome!  I made it as one of my Easter desserts and it tasted sooo good.  I used 1/3 of the package of cream cheese (reduced fat) instead of half.  It sat in the fridge for about 8 hours and it sliced up very nice.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use one package of chocolate pudding instead of two, I had so much leftover chocolate pudding/whipped topping mix that I could have made a second pie with it.  But the taste was out of this world!  Everyone gave rave reviews.  Yum Yum Yum!!!

Make as written, but used one reviewers advice and used 1 cup milk and 1 cup half & half. I thought it was very tasty, however, my other half said it was to peanut buttery, so will probably not make again.

I thought this was a great recipe. I did put it on a traditional pie crust instead of graham cracker because it sounded so sweet to start with, but I don't think a person could go wrong with any pie crust they choose.  I also used the extra creamy cool whip.  Turned out fantastic.  I can't imagine how someone could screw it up and not have it set up if they were following the directions - the pudding was setting up just fine - mix it long enough and then add the whipped topping, it was already firming up as I was spooning it out.  Really a no-fail recipe as written.

I took this pie to a dinner get-together and everyone raved.  I made a few modifications, however.  In order to make the peanut butter layer a little more creamy, I used 1/2 and 1/2 and added about another 2 Tablespoons.  I did not affect the "setup" meaning that the pie held together nicely and was very creamy.  Also, since the standard ratio for Jello instant "pie" filling is 1-3/4 c. milk to one package, and the recipe calls for 2 c. milk to TWO packages, I used 1/2 and 1/2 (to increase creaminess) and increased the measurement to 3 cups.  I found that the two cups was just not enough as I was mixing it (very "gummy").  I made these changes to suit my taste -- no reflection on the basic recipe which was a HUGE hit!  Thanks.

Who!  If you are a peanut-butter/chocolate FREAK like I am ,the recipe you have been searching for has been found!  The very first time I made this, I jumped the gun and got cook & serve pudding and of course I destroyed it.  The second time I did it the right way and oh boy...this is an insanely good pie!  I have to watch my sugar intake so I used sugar-free Cool-Whip and sugar-free pudding and skipped the crust.  I used the entire 8 oz. cream cheese and my only fripe is that you can only eat so much at a time because it is very, very rich!  You are in for a treat making this one!  Thank you so much for your wonderful recipe!

Made this for my Easter guests, and it was a huge hit!  The only changes I made were I used a regular baked pie crust instead of graham (a family member has a food allergy to graham), and I used half-n-half instead of milk in the peanut butter mixture to make it a touch smoother.  I also used equal parts whole milk and heavy cream in the pudding mixture to give it more density.  The pie sliced up beautifully, and had a rich, smooth, almost cheesecake-like texture.  Top with fresh whipped cream or Cool Whip and enjoy the raves from your guests!  Thank you for this awesome recipe!  I've gotten requests for it already!

I substituted 1/3 fat free cream cheese, sugar free chocolate pudding, and fat free whipped topping.  No one noticed anything missing and thought it was delicious.

This was so yummy!  I changed a few things though.  Using a regular pie crust instead of a graham cracker crust cut back on the sweetness a little.  I did not mix the whipped topping with the chocolate pudding, I just dolloped some one each serving-then topped with peanut butter cups. Plus I only used one box of chocolate pudding and 1 1/3 cups milk.

This was easy to make, very rich-tasting, and was a hit with everyone.  '4 stars out of 5, though, because after 6 hours in the fridge, the pie was still a bit soft--There were no neat-looking slices when I served this.  Tip:  Even 1/4 of the cream cheese would be enough.  The peanut butter layer tasted very "cream cheese-y" to me.  It was still very good overall, though.

Really tasty and very rich! Easy to make. I did top with extra peanut butter cups:) I am a banana lover and might substitute the chocolate pudding for banana pudding and top with bananas next time. Altogether, a crowd pleaser.

Absolutely decadent.  Everyone loved it but if I were to make it again I would lighten it up somehow... reduced fat peanut butter perhaps.

I found that the pie was very good, but the pudding layer made a little too much for the top layer. I had to halve the pudding when it was done so that it would fit into the pie shell. Other than that, it tasted yummy!

There is something wrong with the ingredient quantities and the size of the pie crust. I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly in one 9-inch pie crust. If I had followed the recipe exactly, I would have needed two pie crusts. Quite yummy though!

I followed the directions on this exactly and it turned out perfect!  I would suggest to those who though it was too runny or too cream cheese-flavored to use a mixer, if they didn't.  There is no need for alter this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, one of the best pb pie recipes I've made.

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I made it for my boyfriend for his 31st birthday and he LOVED it. He said it tasted high class, and when I told him it was really easy to make, he didn't believe me! A small revision: I found that the pie was a bit loose, so I froze it for 2 hours then refrigerated it for 2 more (instead of just refrigerating for 4). It worked perfectly - the pie thawed but was still solid enough to cut and serve neatly. I would definitely recommend this recipe and will be making this again!!!

I've got lots of chocolate peanut butter fans in my household and this recipe was a hit! It was super easy and tasted yummy. Only change I made was to top with a final layer of whipped cream and then sprinkle the peanut butter cups. Will make this again and again!

This recipe is okay if you like easy desserts with instant boxed ingredients (Cool Whip, Instant Pudding, etc.). I brought this pie to an office function, and while the pie disappeared, I wouldn't make it again. Very, very sweet and artificial in texture and taste.

Delicious and rich! I followed the recipe as is, but substitued low fat/fat free for most of the ingredients.  It still tasted great.  Can't imagine how decadent it would be with the real thing!

This is a very delicious, extremely decadent dessert!  I followed a reviewer's suggestion by using 1 cup milk, 1 cup heavy cream, and also prepared it the day before.  The result was perfect.  I also used more Reeses on the top, and the pie looked like it belonged in a restaurant's display cooler.

I made this for a dinner party & it was a huge hit! A couple of things I changed, I did 3 tbl. sugar, the cream cheese was overwelming the peanut butter. Way sweet & rich enough so I left off candy topping. I also put it in the freezer for 1 hour to set up good. Perfect!  :)

This pie was perfect! I used a home made pie crust instead and cut the chocolate pudding mixture to one box instead of two...  it yielded the perfect amount to fill the rest of the pie. From reading previous reviews, I was almost tempted to use a whole 8 ounce package of cream cheese, as I am a complete cream cheese lover.. however, I am glad that I didn't and stuck to the recipe - otherwise it would have overpowered the peanut butter. I also didn't have any peanut butter cups to top it with but it still tasted fabulous without them.... It is one big peanut butter cup itself!

My family really liked this pie.  Couldn't eat a very big piece though because it was so filling.  From other reviews I knew I needed a larger pie crust, but could not find one.  So I mixed the left over peanut butter and chocolate mixture together and ate it on graham crackers. yum yum.

This pie is SOOOOOO RICH!  Make sure you have a tall glass of milk before you eat it.  I refrigerated overnight, substituted 1 large box of pudding and saved some of the whipped topping for the top. Made an attractive presentation with candy arranged on top.  The ladies LOVED it!

I rated this 5 stars even though it was way too much peanut butter for me because I can see how a peanut butter lover would be in heaven with a piece of this pie.  Next time, I'll cut the amount of peanut butter to 2/3 cup.  It tastes like a Reese "Big Cup".

I'm making this pie for the second time in four days.  It is the only Thanksgiving dessert that was gone on the same day!  I stumbled on a 10" prepared graham cracker crust and used that instead of 9".  I put (10) mini-peanut butter cups in my food processor as the topping.  My family liked to top the pie with cool whip.  The next time I will layer that on top of the pudding layer and then sprinkle with the peanut butter cups.  For a family of peanut butter lovers, this pie is a dream!  It will be added to my collection of favorite dessert recipes!

Really tasty!  I used Jello's Devil's Food flavored instant pudding which gave it a more intense chocolate flavor.  I like the idea of using a chocolate crust, though I didn't use it this time.  I also used 5 mini PB cups cut in quarters and put the pieces (and the crumbs produced while cutting them) over the pie.  I will definitely make this again!

When I asked what kind of cake my 27 year old son wanted me to make for his birthday, he said he didn't want cake he wanted pie. A peanut butter and chocolate pie. I made two of this one, and it was an instantaneous hit. They were all gone, nothing left. I got requests for several birthdays, or any old time I felt like making one, they'd help me eat it. It doesn't need any fiddling around. Just like the recipe posted.. perfect.

I made the peanut butter layer using about 2/3 cup natural peanut butter which resulted in a lighter flavor. However, instead of the pudding layer, I made a chocolate mousse. Melt 4oz bittersweet chocolate with 1/2 cup,heavy cream, stirring until smooth. Beat 1 1/4 cup heavy cream with 2 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla until soft peaks form. Fold in the chocolate mixture and spread over the peanut butter layer. This gave it a little more sophisticated flavor and texture. It was not heavy at all. My family loved it!!!

Left out the whipped cream . don't want to ruin a perfectly good
pie with artificial whipped cream.

 I also made real chocolate pudding instead of the instant box stuff.

This is one of the best pies I have ever made! My older brother's friend actually begged his mom to get the recipe. I made a slight change concerning the frozen whipped topping. The peanut butter layer had about two cups of it, the pudding had 3/4. Still tastes great!

I followed the instructions as stated with the following exceptions:
-I baked my own homemade graham cracker crust rather than using store bought (1 pouch crushed Graham's, 1/4 C sugar, 5 T melted butter - press into 9" pan, bake 7 min at 350 then cool)
-I used reduced fat cream cheese, light whip topping, and sugar free pudding mix.

I agree with other reviewers who say the quantity of chocolate topping is too much for this pie.  I put less than half on top of my pie and stuck the rest back in the whip topping bowl to serve extra if anyone wished to when they sliced the pie.  I stuck a giant spoon in the center of my pie and spread it a little, but not edge to edge, so you could still see pb showing.  In the future, I think I will use half the called for amounts for the chocolate part and maybe reserve a little plain topping for dollops on top.

Overall, my family and I really enjoyed this pie and recommend using this recipe with the tweaks!

Another thought - maybe it could work in a 9x13 pan with this amount of chocolate topping if the pb part was doubled?

I had made a  prebaked pie crust, so used it. Second, No Inst Pudding, so made cooked Chocolate pudding, used 1/2 & 1/2 and 1% milk,  poured in crust chilled it..THEN made the P B layer added it on top of the cooled Choc layer. Took a bit longer but it is 200 to the store so have to improvise. .
It was very good.  Thanks. :)

Yes I have. Makes 2 pies! In the future will replace milk with whipping
cream and cool whip also with whipping cream. for 2 pies: double the
peanut butter recipe, keep chocolate recipe as is,top with more whipping
cream and chocolate covered peanuts.

It turned out really good!! I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 c heavy cream like someone else suggested. I also used the chocolate fudge instant pudding. It gave it a deeper chocolate color and tastes so good!!

I made this pie for my little brother for Thanksgiving dinner because he doesn't like pumpkin pie or any other thanksgiving-ish pies, and he loved it. When I read the recipe, I saw that it called for whipped cream but assumed that was only for the topping, so I bought a can of spray whipped cream. When I went to make it I realized that it actually called for a tub of frozen whipped cream. Oops! I had to make some last minute home-made whipped cream, which (thankfully) turned out pretty well.  Overall this pie was delicious and super easy! I'd make it again!

Before modifications, not very chocolaty. Here's how I improved: used prepared Oreo pie crust, brushed melted semi-sweet choc chips on bottom (microwave on 50% power in 15 second increments until half chips melt; stir until all melt), let harden in freezer 15 min.  PB layer: used 1/3 package cream cheese, half & half and 3 TBSP sugar. Topped with 2nd Oreo pie crust and chopped Reese's.  Pudding layer: used heavy cream and milk, added more choc chips. Saved remaining whipped topping for separate layer. Several people at 2012 Thanksgiving dinner requested the recipe!

Great Recipe! This was my first time making a pie (other than a pumpkin) and it turned out great! I used the suggestion of using 1 Cup Milk & 1 Cup Half&Half (instead of 2 Cups Milk). The consistency was thick.  All the reviews saying it's really rich - believe them; it is! A sliver is just enough! A suggestion is to put some cool-whip on top to help cut down on the richness. A true hit with all at Thanksgiving dinner! Everyone liked that is was both chocolate and peanut butter combined. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made my own crust using crushed up chocolate sandwich cookies (like Oreo) and melted butter. I also alternated the peanut butter and chocolate mixtures to make four layers instead of two, smoothed a bit of whipped topping over that and sprinkled broken up peanut butter cups on top. A rich, delicious dessert. Will be making again and again.

I made this as the recipe says. Tastes awesome! My only issue was that there was too much filling to fit into one pie crust. So I made a little bit extra of the chocolate pudding mixture and made two pies out of it. Worked out great! Perfect with a big glass of milk!

Instead of making a single pie, I used this recipe to make a dozen torts. They turned out fantastic! Just be sure to fully mix the pudding mix and when making torts put a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter on the bottom and a heaping tablespoon of chocolate pudding on top. I used a butter knife to round off the top and wrapped each individually with Saran wrap. Thanks for the recipe!

Decided it sounded pretty rich so I bought small pot pie tins and made my own chocolate graham cracker crusts for each one. For the peanut butter filling I used about 6 to 6.5 oz. of the cream cheese, added about 1/4 cup sugar, and also mixed in about 5 chopped up mini reeses peanut butter cups. With the pot pie tins it made five mini pies, one for my boyfriend and I to share, and several to give away to my lucky neighbors. These freeze well for about 3-5 days, after that they start getting a little too frosty. Make sure to bring them out of the freezer about 10 minutes before serving. I will definately be making this recipe again!

Easy to make and tasted good. I've made this twice now and I liked it better with regular chocolate instant pudding rather than fat free chocolate instant pudding. When I made it with the fat free pudding, it seemed like the peanut butter overpowered it. Well balanced with the regular.

I'm sure this pie is amazing, considering I love peanut butter and chocolate, but I havn't tried it yet. I just wanted to be the one hundred and first person to review this recipe.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday. Very delicious, although very very rich in flavor. The ingredients for the peanut butter filling and chocolate came out to be a lot! Almost enough for a second pie. I also used crunch peanut butter instead- it was a good choice!

This recipe far surpasses an old recipe I had. I will be using this one for now on! I didn't add the remaining whipped topping to the pudding layer. I just made it the last layer. Also, I found that the recipe produced enough filling for 2 pies, so I bought another pie crust and one more container of Cool Whip to make another pie rather than waste the yummy filling! It's a keeper!

It was great. I have made it a couple of times and everyone loves it. I liked it better when i refrigerated it over night (apx. 8 hours). I love how it has so much peanut butter in it. It's my dad's fav.

I have served this both at Thanksgiving and Christmas - it was a hit!  The second time around I used Devil's Food pudding without the whipped topping.  It was very tasty.

I am not sure where I went wrong.  I followed the recipe, but this pie was not what I was expecting after reading the reviews.  We found it to be edible and that's it. I guess it's just personal preference, but we each ate one piece and the rest has been in the refrigerator for a few days.  I guess it's time to get rid of it by now.

Based on another review, I used a regular pie crust instead of the graham cracker. It turned out wonderful! Just came from Thanksgiving dinner, there were 18 pies there - and this was voted the best! I will definately make again. Yes, it is rich, a sliver goes a long way. I covered it with cool whip and chopped up reese cups.

My Great-aunt Hank used to make this "to die for" pie.  Of course her's was more of a complicated masterpiece w/ homemade everything, but, one year while searching for something for the pumkin, sweet potatoe pie haters, at my Thankgiving table I ran across this simplified version and it's been a crowd pleaser ever since.  I now only make 1 pumkin, 3 sweetpotato, and 3 of these. (Great Grandma's sweetpotato is still numero uno, even if I have to use a frozen pie crust.) I garnish w/ some whip topping in a pastry bag, a very thin, tiny drizzle of chocolate sause, and toss on a few peanut butter chips, or Resses pieces and people think it took much more time and effort than it actually did.  The taste is great and very rich.  I love this recipe.

All I can say is that my family LOVED this recipe.  My aunt must of said INCREDIBLE 10 times!  I am now required to bring this to all family dinners.  The only thing I did is cut back on the cream cheese a little and put crumbled reeses cups on top.  Yum!

I would call this "double layer chocolate peanut butter mousse pie."  It was very good, and rich.  I'd make it again if my husband asks, but I'd like to experiment with other recipes to find more of a balance; the peanut butter overwhelmed the chocolate and I was looking for something creamy rather than mousse-like.  But don't get me wrong, it's yummy!

This was excellent!  Exactly what I was hoping for!  I've made this twice in the last week and a half.  It's been a hit with everyone who's eaten it (but most couldn't finish a 1/8 piece of the pie--I suggest cutting it in 12 slices).  If you want a more "restaurant-style" look, try piping whipped cream around the edge of the filling (or over the whole thing) and crumbling the Reese's cups on top (easier to do when they're cold).  Either way, it's delicious!!

This pie turned out pretty good. I took the advice of a few others and used equal parts milk and heavy cream for the chocolate layer, and I did like how it turned out. I wish the peanut butter layer was a little "lighter," it just seemed to be SO rich and heavy, my sister ended up finishing only the chocolate portion of her piece. But overall, my family did really like it and said it tasted like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Also, I had a lot of the pie filling leftover, so I combined the leftover and will serve it as a sweet dip with animal crackers, nilla wafers, or graham cracker sticks. I would probably make this again.

Truly unspectacular!  My wife would not allow me to sample the original peanut butter layer before a drastic reconstruction of the paste. After doubling up on peanut butter, and adding a lot of little things that might make cream cheese taste like peanut butter, it tasted a lot like cream cheese and peanut butter. 
Still, I ate it.

This was great.  I used chocolate cool whip and it was ever so wonderful.  I used a shortbread crust also as most don't like graham crusts in my family.

This is definately the best peanutbutter
pie I have ever had. Have made it 3 times now, and everytime it is perfect.
The last time I made it I had to use
chocolate flavored whipped cream (it was
the only one that I had in my freezer)
but, it worked great and I think that is
the way I will make them now. I took one to a community dinner and heard people raving about it.

Excellent pie, but don't try to substitute Reese's pieces for the topping.  It doesn't work.

My fiance and I both love peanut butter and chocolate. However, this pie has stayed in our fridge since we had the first slices. This recipie is much too rich, to the point of being inedible for us.

Oh my gosh, this was easy and delicious. Watch out, though-- it's one of those tricky desserts that tastes like it might not be too bad for you since it's so light and fluffy, which makes it easy to gobble up in no time. Don't make it for yourself and just one other person, or you'll find you've eaten half a pie in two days! I won't be making this again soon, simply because I like it too much!

I rated this recipe a "5", but beware!  It is EXTREMELY rich - almost too rich.  I used a chocolate cookie crust rather than graham cracker, and it was very good.  Made it for my family's Thanksgiving, and many LOVED it but others thought it was too rich.  Overall, a very good recipe if you like a chocolate/peanut butter combo.

I made this pie a long time ago for a New Years Party and it was a hit.  This year my father had a party at work so to help a bachelor out I made it for him.  He only got a tiny piece(which he loved) because it flew off the pot luck table.

I used a graham cracker crust recipe that I also got on this web site, and I think it's so much better than with the store bought kind.  This pie was a HUGE hit at our dinner party, but it is definitely rich.  Also, I used crunch peanut butter because it was all I had, but I don't think I would do it any other way now.  Great recipe!
