This is a terrible recipe!! I wish I had read the other reviews before trying it! It does come out more like a batter than a dough. When it came out all wrong I came back to Allrecipe.com to see what I could do - I added more flour and more sugar. They came out OK (my chocoholic husband still ate them) but the texture was still pretty weird. They did LOOK pretty though. Its a good concept. But something is definitely wrong with the ingredient proportions.

Not enough flour. These cookies spread out over the whole pan. They were gooey more like they should have been a brownie.

The cookies did not turn out well at all. They came out more like a cake batter than a cookie dough. I tried to make them anyway without rolling them and they just flattened out. I ended up having to throw them all away.

These turned out great for me I don't understand where all of the negative reviews came from. Maybe there was a typo in the recipe at the time?

I would recommend putting the batter in the freezer for 45 mintues before trying to roll them into balls. It will harden the batter and make it much easier to work with. You can dip your hand in water when rolling them and it will keep them from sticking to your hand.
