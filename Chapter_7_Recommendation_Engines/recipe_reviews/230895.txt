This is the BEST coney sauce that's ever come out of my kitchen! Even my "coney connoisseur" husband loved it!

I was looking for chili sauce without beans similar to what Hormel used to sell. It was delicious on hot dogs (Hormel has since changed the recipe to it's detriment). This came pretty close. I doubled the recipe, but only used one pkg of chili seasoning (Lawry's), and added 2-3 T. flour for a little thickening. First, I browned the hamburger, chopping it into fine pieces with a spatula & drained it. Then added the remaining ingredients, & simmered to reduce the liquid and meld the flavors. It's a winner. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made it exactly like recipe.  I took this to a hotdog buffet topping event.   Everyone wanted the recipe and there was not one smidge of it remaining.  I will definitely remake this for our weiner roasts at our cabin.

Made exactly as written. Took it to a campfire hot dog roast in a crock pot and served with cheese sauce. Everyone loved it. Next time I might add some diced onion.

This is recipe is very easy. I used beef broth instead of water to get a little more beefy flavor. It is terrific. I will add some diced onions next time

So simple and very good!  Will definitely make again.  I used generic chili seasoning packet and we thought the sauce had great flavor!

Perfect texture but it needed some spice.  I added extra mustard and a little ketchup to try and give it some flavor but it wasn't enough.  I'm going to try it again but include some extra spices.  Thanks!
