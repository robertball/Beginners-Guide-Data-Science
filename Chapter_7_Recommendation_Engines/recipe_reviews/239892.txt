This stuff is insanely good! We have followed the recipe exactly and modified it to include more marshmallows and vanilla. Excellent both ways. The longer you cook the Carmel mixture the harder it will be and the less sticky. I prefer the sticky mess with soft delicious popcorn you goodness.

This tastes between a Crackerjack and a rice krispy treat.  Good stuff. Not so sticky after a few minutes, it hardens like Crackerjacks. Got it down to a single serving -  10 mini marshmallows, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 tablespoon butter, mixed with 1.5 cups popcorn.

Very, very good.  I was out of  corn syrup, so I was looking for a caramel corn recipe without corn syrup.  Marshmallows were a perfect additional.
Thanks for the recipe!

This looks Delish...but I'll have to try it with some real cane sugar. The molasses will give it a real great flavor & super sticky texture and deep brown color. Can't wait to give it a try tomorrow night.

This is very tasty, but incredibly messy. I would definitely take some oven time to firm things up as Maria Latham did according to her review on this item. I think I'll stick with corn syrup for sugar coated popcorn snacks in the future.

Really yummy. I made it for a Halloween treat and called it cobweb popcorn. I made it just as the recipe stated (although I didn't have big marshmallows. I used the tiny ones; 1/2 cup for each big one). My boys have already requested I make it again.

Really good stuff! Not healthy, but good. And very easy. I've used up to 12 cups of popcorn, still works great!
