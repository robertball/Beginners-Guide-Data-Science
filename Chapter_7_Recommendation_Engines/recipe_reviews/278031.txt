I am a home of one, so I reduced the recipe for four servings, I followed the recipe with the exception of the cooking time. I cooked it on high pressure for 12 minutes and did a quick release...I was hungry, borderline hangry!!! I loved how it turned out. Perfect! Tasty, delicious, easy and filling!!
