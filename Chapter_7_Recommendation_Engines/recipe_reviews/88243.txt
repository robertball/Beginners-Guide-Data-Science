Good recipe BUT...be forwarned that is is VERY spicy.  We cut the cayenne and black pepper back to 1 tsp. each and like it much better.

Great hummus!  I love spicy food and this was right on the money!  I did however omit the cayenne so as to actually taste the hummus flavor along with the jalapeno.  I think this recipe is just as tasty without the cayenne.

This hummus recipe is delicious, and was a hit at a party I recently made it for.  It works well served w/ toasted pita cut into wedges.

This recipe is great, only the amount of cayenne pepper and black pepper is way too much. Cut those by about 2/3 and you should have a tasty and well-presented snack or appetizer.

This was a HUGE hit!! The first time I made it, I left out the banana peppers and garlic and cut the cayenne and black pepper in half.  It was alot prettier and not as spicy but the 2nd time I followed the recipe and it was so good.  Very, very spicy but so flavorful!

I had high hopes, but was disappointed. The heat was fine, but something was off. I'm not sure whether it needed more tahini or chick peas.

Incredibly good!  My husband and I made this last night and only used about half of the hot ingredients.  We added the hot stuff in stages and quit when it was full of flavor, but not burning hot.  The next morning the flavors had melded together for an extra kick.  Great stuff!

This is a really tasty dip.  I modified a little though b/c I wanted to be able to taste the dip and not just HOT.  The only change I made was to add another 16 oz. can of garbanzo beans and just used a tsp. of cayenne pepper and black pepper.  Cuts the fire in half.  Great as a dip for fresh veggies!

This is still the best hummus recipe I have found. You must really love spicy though. I wouldn't personally recommend cutting any ingredients, maybe even suggest more jalape√±os. But if you want spicy but not mouth scorching, perhaps you should cut back. Anyways, a terrific recipe!

This was an awsome recipe. We love hummus and this was great. We spiced it up a little using some really hot peppers. This will be one of our new dishes.

I made this for a group (I am the only one dieting) and they loved it.  It had more taste than others I have tried and was very moist.

I used fresh peppers right out of the garden.

Whewwww the flavor was good once you got past the heat. I even put in a lot less peppers but that didnt help. I kept adding more chickpeas but pretty soon I had a mountain of the stuff and it was still hot. I dont think I will make this again but it was worth a try.

I love spicy food but I agree with other reviewers about cutting down the cayenne and black pepper.  I used 1 tsp each and it was still HOT!!!  I also added some cherry peppers (didn't have green peppers)

Very good!  I didn't think the heat was too much...the pita bread tones it down.

VERY SPICY! Not for everyone, although I did enjoy it.  Can't dip a hefty amount on whatever you're serving this with.  

After reading the reviews, I decided to cut the cayenne pepper in half, along with the black pepper.  I also only added 3 jalapeno peppers.  It was still a little too spicy for my liking, so I added some lemon juice, more garlic, olive oil, and more tahini in an effort to make it a bit more mild.  Worked a little.  :) 

Very good, though, will probably make it again.

Definitely decreased the cayenne and substituted black pepper for white pepper. Needs more garlic!
