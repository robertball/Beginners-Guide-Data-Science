This is a pretty omelet (see photo) but was just ok. I feel like it needed something salty added to it like capers, or I'll bet smoked salmon would be amazing. It just needs something to balance out the slight sweetness of the cream cheese. I would make it again with those additions. Thanks for posting!

Delish! My family was getting very sick of scrambled eggs, but I like having eggs for lunch once a week. This recipe made all of us happy. Go easy on the cream cheese - 1.5 T. is more than enough for two eggs.

So quick and so simple, yet so tasty! Even without the chives. I think it's going to be my quick side dish no.1 replacing gone off scrambled eggs.

It was way to creamy for me!  I would use more egg and less cream cheese.

This was SO good! I wasn't so sure about the cream cheese but it turned out great! I also used chopped onion instead of chives and added ham, bacon, and cheese to it. The ham and bacon were really good mixed with the cream cheese. This is definitely on my list to make for breakfast. It was fast and delicious!

I really liked this recipe. Never thought to put cream cheese in an omelette. I think I would probably use less cream cheese next time, but it was delish.

Delicious!  Added garlic paste to the egg mix and onions instead of chives as i didnt have any. Topped it with 2 tblsp of picante sauce and a few snips of cilantro. Very pretty on the plate!

This was amazing! I can't have tomatoes so I just did the cream cheese and chives with veggies on the side. I also added a bit of garlic (1 clove) to the egg mixture. I'm a garlic fiend! Delicious!
