Seriously the best gf quick bread I have ever made.  Kids love it.  I also adapted it for pumpkin bread - double recipe, in place of zucchini use 1 can of pumpkin, add pumpkin pie spice.  You can also substitute some of the white sugar for brown with good results.

this is GREAT!!!  I made 2 loaves.  The kids LOVE it and it made the house smell great while it was baking.
My changes:
I used 1 full cup rice flour (no sweet rice flour)
I used 1/2 cup butter in place of the oil.
I used ground flax seed in place of the xanthum gum.
I left out the glaze, the kids love it without!

I will definitely be making this again!  I doubled the recipe and have 2 beautiful loaves.  Oh and the crust really is beautiful.  Thank you!

I made some adjustments: I didn't have any xanthan gum and substituted 1/2 tsp of flax seed flour, I also used 1 cup of white rice flour and not the 1/2 sweet rice flour and 1/2 white rice flour.  I used 3/4 cup of honey in place of the 1 cup of sugar.  Also used 1/2 olive oil in place of the canola oil.  Beware it is very filling.

Normally, I think reviews should be based on the original recipe, which I still think would be 5 stars, I did alter it a little.  First, I used shredded zucchini. Next, I doubled the recipe as I needed to make 2 loaves.  I knew I was almost out of rice flour so I substituted the white rice and sweet rice for oat flour. I put half of the batter in a greased pan and the other half of the batter I added 4 T of cocoa and 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips.  Baked both loves for the time indicated in recipe.  Delicious!!!!!!  (I skipped the glaze.)  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

OMG.... this is theeeee best zucchini bread EVER!!!! It seems I've tried a zillion Zucchini bread recipes and they either raise up way to high and then flop when they cool, or they turn out rubbery!!! You wouldn't even think this is Gluten Free!!!! The only changes I made were... Instead of canola oil I used coconut oil and instead of sugar I used coconut palm sugar. I also added 1 tsp each of ginger, cloves and nutmeg (we like a total fall tasting bread). I never would have thought that blending the liquid ingredients and zucchini(I used my food processor) would make the bread so soft... but man oh man!!! This is now going to be my go to recipe for all my sweet breads!! Going to try pumpkin next!!

Just baked this bread and I used oat flour in place of the rice and sweet rice flour (1 cup total) and it turned out great! Just like regular zucchini bread! I left the rest of the recipe the same except for the fact that I use organic coconut oil instead of canola. Everything else, was the exact way the recipe reads. My bread was done in 50 min.

Delicious!  Entire family loved this recipe.  Was trying out a gluten free zucchini muffin for a relative who does GF.  Might have to make a second batch tomorrow for them.  Substituted general GF flour for both rice flours.  Also used 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c coconut oil for the oil.  Made in muffin pan only took about 20 mins to bake.  Didn't even use the drizzle topping.  These were so good!

The entire loaf was eaten by my husband and two children 3 and 5 within 2 hours. I substituted all the oil with natural apple sauce. It leaves the bread very moist and with a lot less fat. I also sprinkled about 1/4 t of pumpkin pie spice as recommended by others. I will likely be making this in the morning for breakfast.

Unlike most, apparently, I made this recipe  exactly as presented(down to the the gram). At least it was edible which can't be said of many gluten free recipes.  I would use more zucchini next time and add a couple of Tablespoons of butter to moisten it up.

Cannot tell it's gluten free at all, and has good flavor. I didn't have rice flour so I subbed oat flour and also used ground flax like other reviewers suggested. Reduced the sugar a bit and left the zucchini chunky. This is a good recipe to use as a basis for flour to binder ratio and I've used it for making gluten free banana bread too.

I made this today and it's delicious. Here are the changes I made to it. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 cup of diced carrots, reducing zucchini by 1/2 cup. I used 3 eggs instead of 4 and 3/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 Cup butter instead of canola oil. I also used 3/4 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup honey. Instead of sweet rice flour I used oat flour, and I added 1/2 Tsp of nutmeg with the cinnamon. This made two loaves which baked beautifully for 1 hour and came out with a wonderful crust on the top and ends, and nicely moist inside. No glaze is necessary. I will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe. I substituted my GF flour blend & added 1/4 c. cocoa. It was delicious. A church friend gave me a GF flour blend of sorghum flour, cornstarch, & tapioca flour. I am new to GF so I was really nervous about baking GF. It turned out great & I just made 2 more loaves. They're in the oven now. Can't wait. (I intended to share with my son-in-law if it last until I see him. LOL)

This bread is wonderful! Before going g-free, zucchini bread was a staple around our house every summer. I truly never thought I would find a decent g-free zucchini bread. This will be our new family favorite! The changes I made: used 1 cup of white rice flour,

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I have used it 5 times over the past 10 days: from muffins to take in my lunches to Thanksgiving get-togethers, and just now with ripe bananas in place of the zucchini. It is very adaptable and very forgiving, so you can use what you have on hand and make additions if you want. I do not use a full cup of sugar, I use 1/3 cup and a couple tablespoons of brown rice syrup or maple syrup. I also cut the oil in half (I've use coconut oil and olive oil, both work quite well) and added a small container of unsweetened applesauce. I have added dried cherries and shredded coconut. All modifications were simply a matter of preference or dietary necessity. The basic recipe is a winner, and I will use this as my one and only go-to recipe. Love it!

Modified recipe to make GF Chocolate Chocolate Chip Zucchini Bread - YUM!!! Used what I had on hand... multipurpose GF flour and brown rice flour instead of the other rice flours. Didn't have tapioca starch, so omitted.  Doubled the recipe and added 2 TBSP Cocoa plus Chocolate Chips, put batter into a bundt pan for looks and plus it's easy to slice out leftovers for freezer storage of individual pieces. End result was fluffy, moist, and rich - DELISH!

I made mine in Muffin cups for portion control. 3 tablespoons per cup and baked 15-17 min. Couple changes...subbed half the sugar with stevia equivalent. Subbed melted butter for oil. Skipped glaze. Used brown rice flour and bobs red mill gluten free baking flour instead of what recipe said. Turned out great and can't tell they are gluten free.

Great recipe! Crusty outside and deliciously moist inside. Used brown rice flour instead of white (didn't have any) and followed remaining recipe.  Doubled the recipe. Made a regular loaf of bread out of the first batch. Then made chocolate muffins with the remaining batter. Added 3 TBS of cocoa powder and Enjoy Life chocolate chips. The muffins were equally delicious! Will be making again!

Holy delicious! My SO recently had to start a GF diet and I was struggling to find something he could eat and that I was willing to eat. This is by far the best zucchini bread I've had at all. You can't even tell it's GF. I accidentally used potato starch instead of corn starch :S but it seemingly doesn't cause it to taste bad. I'll have to actually read what I'm grabbing next time and see if there's a difference. I also subbed corn starch for the tapioca starch. Again, can't tell if it made a difference. It's still amazing

Easy and tasty, it will be my new go to recipe for gf quick bread. I reduced the sugar and added some raisins and walnuts, otherwise followed the recipe. It looked quite wet when I put it in the pan, but baked beautifully. Thanks for sharing!

Loved this bread! This is my first experience with gluten free baking. Here is what I modified: coconut oil instead of canola, mix of white sugar and coconut palm sugar (2/3 & 1/3) and ground flax seed instead of xanthan gum.  I would like to think that thes modifications (my preferences) did not alter the taste too much. I baked the loaf for 50 minutes. I can't wait to make it again. I will likely go with 3/4 c sugar, just coconut palm sugar. Thanks for the great recipe.

The only change I made was adding 3 Tbs. of Cocoa powder.  My grandson is gluten and dairy free and he loves chocolate.  He was crazy for this zucchini bread.  What a treat!
Thank you for posting this recipe!

I used this wonderful recipe with few changes.  I made a double batch, using 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce instead of doubling the oil, and I used 1/2 c brown sugar + the rest white.  Remember, I doubled everything.   As suggested by others, I used oat flour instead of any rice flours, and all corn (instead of mixed) starch.  I spooned the batter by rounded TEASPOONFULs, into MINI-muffin pans, lined with paper liners and sprayed 1 squick spray each of cooking spray.  The double batch made 7 1/2 dozen lovely, golden zucchini muffins, which were ready in 16 minutes, in my oven.  Thanks very much for sharing your Mom's recipe :)

I think the sweet rice flour gave it a weird bouncy texture (think mochi) and overall it wasn't sweet enough.  I did like that it rose nicely since flat breads have been a big pet peeve of mine since having to go gluten free.  I might try it again with a bit more sugar and swap out that sweet rice flour with oat flour since a lot of reviewers seem to have great luck with that.

It's a keeper.  We haven't had the best luck finding gluten-free quick bread recipes that don't taste gluten-free.   I  was intentionally a little heavy handed with the cinnamon because I added tiny chocolate chip and cinnamon accents chocolate flavor.  I skipped the glaze .

Oh my gosh, this is truly amazing!! Doesn't resemble a gluten free bread product in any way.  I stashed it in the back of my fridge to keep it all for myself.  Well the fam found it and couldn't believe it was GF.  I pretty much stuck to the recipe, only subbing all rice flour for the sweet/white combo.  Added nuts and didn't do icing.  I'm very curious as to how it will work using just oat flour for the entirety of flours.  That would streamline the process and reduce the cost.  You just cannot go wrong with this recipe.

I made this yesterday and absolutely love it!!! I couldn't find my tapioca starch until after I had already added a tablespoon of arrow root so then I just added a tablespoon of tapioca starch to balance out the measurement. This bread is absolutely delicious and I will make it again and again! It did not need the glaze, it didn't even need butter!!!

I doubled the recipe, and made this with half Betty Crocker gluten free baking mix and half King Arthur all purpose gluten free flour. I used 1 cup Splenda, 1/2 cup coconut palm sugar, 1/2 cup cane sugar, and did not use any xanthan gum. I also added raisins. This is by far the best gluten free bread I've made and really my first successful gluten free bake! It's so fluffy and the texture is just great. It didn't even crumble much despite omitting the xanthan gum (but the Betty Crocker mix has a little in it). You would not know it is gluten free. Why does the recipe not say how long to bake it? I had no clue and just kept checking every ten minutes after the first 30. It ended up taking almost an hour to fully bake.

This is a definite keeper!  I used organic coconut oil in lieu of canola, organic coconut sugar in lieu of white sugar and cooked for 40  minutes.   It was easy, fun, fast, and most of all DELICIOUS,  thank you so much for sharing!
