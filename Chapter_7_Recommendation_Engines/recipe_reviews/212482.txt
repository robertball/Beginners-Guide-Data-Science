I tried this glaze on an 8 lb. bone-in turkey breast.  While it was roasting, the smell was amazing.  The finished turkey breast was moist, but only the skin seemed to have the flavor.  I think the next time I try this recipe, I'll try injecting the glaze into the turkey breast to get the flavor into the meat.

Fantastic!  I made mine in a crock pot with 1/2 c extra water cooking it for 8 hours on low.  It was moist and delicious!

I'm not a brave cook so I tend to go for the recipes that already have 100+ high reviews. Not sure what I was thinking going for a recipe with only 2 previous reviews but it definitely paid off!  A friend gave me a huge frozen turkey breast and as it thawed, I was clueless as far as what to do with it.  I made this  recipe just as written. This was really good and easy peasy to make!

This was SO great but I deducted one star because the recipe doesn't mention anything about injecting the meat with the glaze, or letting it marinate at least overnight. So I amended for this and added a side dish in the pan:

While I didn't have time to marinate the bird for more than a few hours, I rubbed the glaze under the skin and also injected it into the meat. This helped. 

I didn't have any liquid smoke, and wanted a smoky element, so I instead used some hickory seasoning (from Costco) with smoke flavor in it. It complimented the flavor profile nicely. I reduced salt for health reasons and personal preference.

I stuffed the cavity of the breast with cornbread stuffing. No sweet elements added because I wanted it as a foil to the sweetness of the bird. It was perfect.

I surrounded the turkey, in the pan, with baby carrots so they'd pick up the maple glaze. Then I crumbled some walnuts over them. 

I didn't have time to cook at that low temperature, and my bird was eight pounds, so I instead cooked at 400 degrees and wrapped the entire thing in foil. The last forty five minutes, I uncovered the top and switched from bake to roast and caramelized the skin. Breast side up where the fat was. 

The turkey was very flavorful with just the right hint of sweetness. I don't like overly sweet meat, and this was perfect! The carrots, due to their own sweetness, got even sweeter with the glaze they cooked in and were just perfect. The walnuts added a nice nutty touch.

I tried this without the liquid smoke and the meat was terrific.  I'd do it again but I must warn you about one thing.  Don't even THINK about making gravy with the droppings; unless you like turkey with syurp poured on it!

I'm not a big fan of maple or liquid smoke so I took a leap of faith on this one.  This was excellent.  I loved the flavor combination and even better this was the juiciest turkey breast I have ever made and I make a lot of them.  Not sure if it was the lower then normal cooking temp or the basting.  This took exactly an hour and a half and my breast was a little under 3lbs.  Thanks for sharing this.

This recipe was great. I used it on a half turkey breast and roasted it in the oven. I seperated the skin from the breast and filled it with the gaze also. I basted under the skin and atop the breast throughout roasting. I served it with an aple and cranberry cornbread stuffing.

One of the best turkey breast recipes I've found, but you have to work a bit to flavor the meat.  Loosen the skin from meat between the strings holding the boneless roast together.  Using a brush or similar implement, force the glaze between the skin and meat and also into interior of the roast.  Cook at 350 F but no higher or the sugar in the glaze will burn.

This was so easy and excellent.  I too am not a great fan of liquid smoke, but in this case it gave it just the right savory/sweet combination that keeps me coming back for more.  My husband said he didn't want to stop eating!

This looked so tempting and the reviews were great so I made it for Easter for four people.  We all found it very bland.  I wish I would have injected the meat with the glaze as it only remained on the skin and no flavor was on the meat at all.  I won't bother making this again.

This was really good..more like yummy.  Followed the recipe.  Only thing I did different was I injected the turkey with the maple glaze and it  was the juiciest, tastiest turkey I think I have ever had.

This was wonderful and is destined to become a regular meal here. The only thing I did different was I baked this in the bottom half of a dutch oven with 4 cups of water added and left out the salt for health reasons.

Turkey had good flavor, it was just a little on the dry side.  Liked it better the next day after it had been refrigerated.  Made the recipe as written.

The most delicious and moist turkey I've ever eaten! After reading the reviews, I injected the roast with some of the maple glaze before cooking, and kicked up the cayenne a bit....I like a little spice. It did take a tad longer to cook than the suggested 90 minutes, but well worth the wait. Nothing but raves from the crew I had at the house. Congrats on a great recipe.

This is a really good recipe!!! I absolutely loved the flavor it gave and I basted it every hour. I did omit the liquid smoke but if it’s used I can only imagine how much better it tastes. The turkey came out nice and moist too!!!

I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee, with one minor tweak; I didn't have any of the liquid smoke, but since the recipe called for paprika, and I happened to have smoked paprika on hand, I used that to create more of a smoky flavor. After reading the reviews, I decided to inject some of the flavoring into the breast because I didn't have enough time to marinate it as was suggested. Okay, one more tweak: I added some honey flavored bourbon to the seasoning. I have to say, the house smelled great and the turkey was beautifully browned when all was said and done. There was a nice amount of drippings in the bottom of the pan, so I blended that with a little more of the bourbon and maple syrup and brought it to a boil to produce a sauce for the turkey. I was very pleased with the end result and my husband said it was a keeper. Please forgive me for going into all the other details about how I changed it up a bit. I guess I'm guilty of the same thing I find fault in so many other reviews where they open up by saying " I followed the recipe to the letter" and then go on in great length about how they changed it. Simply put, this is a great recipe; I would make it again and I would marinate the turkey for a while before roasting to allow the bird to absorb the wonderful flavors. Thank you!

I followed the recipe, saw some write they used a flavor injector.  I need a new one so instead I marinated it  half the day and overnight, turning occasionally.  We don't eat the skin and It was bland, even with all that marinating. I won't be making this again, none of us liked it.

This was delicious and so moist.  My husband said it was the best turkey he ever had.  I made it with a bone-in turkey as well.  The smell was amazing and maybe because we were able to use the glaze both inside and outside of the turkey, we didn't experience any lack of flavor. I'd make this again in a heartbeat!

I made this last night and it was so juicy and amazing! I followed the recipe the exact same way and served with a side of roasted potatoes and brussels. The roast was done and they needed a little longer, so I removed the roast from the pan and tossed the veggies the drippings. Amazing!

Wow, what a great recipe!  I had two medium sized turkey breasts so I doubled the recipe so that I would have enough glaze to baste them a few times during cooking.  The skin roasted perfectly and the meat inside was moist and tasty.  So easy to prepare and keep an eye on during the cooking.  I even made my own cranberry sauce from this site to serve with the turkey and can honestly say, I will never, ever buy canned cranberry sauce EVER again.  Simple to make and a great compliment to this fantastic turkey recipe.  Thanks so much!

used fake syrup. very good and easy.  liquid was too thick to baste, used brush with little effect.  frequent basting should improve taste.

I edited this recipe for 1.5 lbs of turkey breast tenderloin strips. It was delicious and extremely easy to prepare. Despite the lack of a fatty skin, the tenderloins were moist and juicy. These are great flavors that you could use on other poultry. If you're looking for an easy weekday meal, give this one a try!

Was very tasty, just wish my turkey breast had come skinless.  Once I took the skin off there wasn't much flavour.  Took a little longer to cook as well.  Kids said it's a keeper!

WOWZA!! This was a knock out especially with the maple pineapple ham. The juices so beautiful and what a nice color. Cooked in Turkey roaster. I put out 38 lbs of meat and I didn't have left overs...THEY ROBBED ME!! A note for an awesome cranberry surprise try out the  apple ginger cranberry  chutney for side with this. No left overs!

Just made this thanksgiving 2019!  I actually made it as the recipe called for.   Just made a little more marinated for basting.   The turkey breast was moist very good.  I did try putting some of the glaze under the skin as well but did not inject any into the turkey breast .   Will use this recipe again!
Thanks

I made this and it turned out wonderful, I made a few minor changes like rubbing the syrup under the skin and letting it marinate overnight.

Followed the recipe to the letter, leaving out the 'optional' liquid smoke and it turned out great.  Served with whipped potatoes, corn and peas and the Cranberry Chutney l on this site.  Soooo good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

My rating is for the glaze itself as I made the turkey in my smoker. I made the glaze as written and wouldn't change a thing. Really nice flavor for the turkey breast, but I did inject the meat as I would not be able to open the smoker to baste it. I did have a problem with the smoking process, which is no fault of the recipe author. We'll definitely try smoking another turkey breast using this mixture as we truly enjoyed the flavor it gave the turkey. Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because it was so easy to make and quite lovely but, according to my husband, not as flavorful as it could be although I did rub the seasonings under the skin as another reviewer suggested. (I'm vegetarian so I didn't eat it.). When asked if he'd like to have this again, he kindly said, "Well, there are so many other recipes out there, why not try some of those?"

I tried this because of all the great reviews to see if it would work for Thanksgiving.  I am glad I did.  I don't know if I did something wrong but nobody in my household liked it.  I made it exactly how it was written out, with the exception of pulling the skin back and putting some of the glaze underneath.  The outside was dry  and really didn't have much flavor.

Injected the meat and under the skin.  These flavors are among my favorite and I injected the meat and under the skin; but it still turned out dry.  Very disappointed.  I will say, however, that my husband loved it and he ate it for sandwiches for two days.  I would try it again, but perhaps add some broth to the pan.  It would likely also be good in a slow cooker.

I didn't have black pepper or paprika, and I didn't use liquid smoke. I didn't substitute anything; I just left them out. I made the glaze to use on turkey breast cutlets. They were skinless, so the glaze didn't stick easily, but I added more and broiled them for a few minutes and it finally stuck to the meat. Next time I'll turn off the broiler a little earlier, because they looked sort of dry and I had to add a little more maple syrup. In the end, even though the outside was a little rough, the inside was still juicy and they had such a delicious flavor.  This recipe is definitely going to be one of my staple dishes that I make regularly. I loved it!

I made this exactly as stated on two (2) turkey breasts for Christmas dinner and from the moment my family took their first bite - there was silence pretty much for the remainder of the meal.  This was absolutely terrific!  Easy to make and easy to clean up as I sprayed the pan with some Pam and there was no scrubbing of the maple syrup glaze after dinner.  My family asked if next Thanksgiving I would do this to the entire turkey.  This is a keeper for sure!  Thank you for the recipe.

Used the exact recipe as published but I used an injector as several reviewers had suggested and it worked great . First time I have used an injector. My stepdaughter who is a small eater had seconds! Unprecedented!  I roasted at 350 for 1 1/2 hours for a 3 pound boneless breast. It was juicy and Yummy! Will make it again.

I crushed the thyme myself, two pinches of cayenne pepper, and a tsp extra syrup.  Turned out great with two boys wanting more. Definitely doing this again and doubling the recipe.

Delicious!! Next time I think I will only use 1/2 tsp liquid smoke but the flavors with the maple syrup were fantastic. Basted my Thanksgiving turkey with it.

We Love it! I made this for my first Thanksgiving with my own family and friends and it was a HIT! I also injected the Turkey with creole butter and before glazing, I rubbed the bird with olive oil and seasoned with season salt and pepper, and it turned out wonderful. That was back in 2011...it is now 2015 and I still glaze the outside of my turkey with this.

Very good indeed and I did use the liquid smoke and I did not find the gravy to be too sweet.  
I put some of the maple mixture under the skin while it was cooking so the meet was pretty flavorful.

Made this for Christmas 2013. Amazing! Family loved it. I used a 6lb bone in turkey breast and just adjusted the amount of servings to 12 for the ingredients. Only thing I did additional was brine the turkey overnight in a maple and brown sugar brine. Like other reviewers I also injects the glaze prior to baking. I'm a turkey novice so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was. This recipe is a keeper!

don't know why but at 325 the turkey breast wasn't even close to the 170 internal temp...I'll have to try it again...but I think the temp needs to be higher...I'd also like to try infusing the turkey with the marinade...

Doubled the recipe for a 7 lb turkey breast roast for Thanksgiving and we LOVED IT! Used the drippings to make gravy and it had an awesome flavor of sweet from the syrup and heat from the cayenne... My husband couldn't stop "grunting" his enjoyment throughout the meal... He's a man of few compliments and this one hit the target! :)

I read the reviews which only added the modification of injecting the marinade into the turkey rather than simply brushing it on.  (Since I have tried brushing on a marinade in another recipe, I know flavor gets lost.)  Mix ingredients as directed--the combination of flavors was perfect.  I threw in brussel sprouts and chopped red potatoes around the turkey and drizzled the marinade over those too!  To my amazement, the veggies were the first to be completely devoured by my family.  I kicked up the oven temperature to 375 for 1.5 hours, but not every oven is the same.  I simply know that my oven tends to undercook if I don't adjust the temp.  Great, GREAT recipe!  This can be used on a whole chicken as well, we found out. :)

I enjoyed this recipe in a crockpot. The only criticism I have is that you shouldn't make gravy with the drippings. WAY too sweet for gravy!

EXCELLENT!
I really don't care for smoked foods but this didn't have a smoked flavor.

I didn't change a thing and this turned out fabulously.  The only thing I will do differently the next time is prepare more maple glaze.  There were virtually no pan drippings to baste with so my basting wasn't what it should have been.  More glaze would have come in handy.

This was excellent.  I used a 6.5 lb. bone-in turkey breast, and it was done in 2 hours (had a pop-up timer).  Mom said it was the best turkey she had ever had.  Thanks Miki

Tried this recipe for a 3 lb turkey roast, we injected the roast with some of the mixture and then spread the rest on top. It came out amazingly! Will definitely do again!

Tried it on 2 1kg turkey breasts.
I skipped the liquid smoke and onion powder because I don't have them. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.

I was worried about it being dry but it came out very moist.

Delicious!

My husband really liked this, but I thought it was a bit to sweet.  That was probably my fault though because I had no liquid smoke and didn't have time to run to the store.  Chicken was very moiste and recipe was easy to put together.  I cooked in crock pot on low with 1/2 cup water for 7 hrs.  I will definitely make again when I have all of the necessary ingredients on hand.  Hubby is looking forward to turkey sandwiches for lunch this week.
