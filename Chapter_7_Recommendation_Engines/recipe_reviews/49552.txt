If I could give this six stars, I would.  This satisfies ALL my requirements for a "great" recipe!  Get a load of this, and I am not exaggerating:  it's quick and easy, inexpensive, attractive to look at, delicious, and very very healthy.  It travels AND refrigerates well and it can be eaten hot or cold.  What else is there to say?  I like to double the batch and bring it to work all week for lunch.  Sometimes I add chopped red bell pepper to the onion and garlic saute, but that's mostly for added color and nutrition.  It's also excellent just the way it is!  Two thumbs up!

This recipe was great! I served it as a side dish, but it definitely has potential to be a main course. I used one can of black beans and chicken stock because I didn't have veggie stock on hand. Next time I'll add a drained can of tomatoes with green chiles. I let my quinoa soak while I did my prep work, a total of about 10 minutes, and the quinoa came out soft and mushy (like a wet couscous). I think you can skip the soaking part for a firmer, "al dente" quinoa and that should taste fine. I think soaking for an hour would have turned it completely into mush.

This one gets five stars. We had never tried quinoa, so we weren't sure what to expect. I followed another reviewer's tip to rinse the quinoa well before cooking, and there was no bitter taste.
My changes: Added the liquid from a can of tomatoes to chicken broth to make 1-1/2 cups, added a can of Costco chicken breast, and diced a orange bell pepper I had on hand. We added grated cheddar and sour cream at the table.
The seasonings were very nice, although next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will likely add a tiny bit more cayenne pepper.
My husband really raved over this one, although he tends to be wary of new "health" foods. He was also please with how economical this recipe can be.
This is a winner!

Really good. I followed the others advise and added to the recipe. I added zucchini and tomato as well as fresh lemon juice. I used only one can of beans but I only had a half a cup of Quinoa left. We put it in tortillas with raw cabbage and avacado and it was so fresh and delish. Good for you, easy and tasty.

The proportions and flavors are mostly good, and I changed the directions only slightly. Two cans of black beans seemed too much to me, so I stopped at one. Make sure you rinse your quinoa if it needs it! Otherwise this might come out very bitter. Also, hold back your garlic until your onions are at least halfway done or it will burn, and throw in the quinoa shortly after. Toasting it lends amazing flavor. Then, add the spices and saute for a moment more, mixing thoroughly, before adding the broth of your choice. Otherwise a great recipe. Thank you!

I'd never prepared nor eaten quinoa before (pronounced “keen-wa”; I didn't even know that!). ;) It is supposed to be very healthy & a complete protein, so I wanted to try it.  This was a spicy hot dish, but not too much for us.  I used olive oil instead of veg oil, and chicken broth rather than veg broth.  I only used one can of black beans; two would have been too much; I'd prefer that the quinoa stand out more than the beans.  We really liked this dish and I will make it again.

I used bulgur wheat instead of quinoa (I'm a poor college student and the bulgur was MUCH cheaper!) but the recipe was still fantastic!!! The spices are just right! I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of corn , and partially cooked the bulgur before adding it to the onions and garlic. The recipe seems pretty forgiving and would probably work with a variety of grains. Delicious and healthy! Will make again!

My husband loved this!  I decided at the last minute to use only one can of black beans.  I put the first one in, and it seemed like another one would be overkill.  I've never cooked quinoa before, but my husband has, and he says this is a great recipe.  I did use the veggie broth, but may use chicken broth next time.  Served with salsa chicken from this site, and they blended well together.  I mixed the cooked salsa "juices" into the quinoa for a great taste experience.  Also served with an avocado and sour cream.  Delicious!

Many reviewers reported the dish ended up mushy or soupy.  Quinoa is a very, very delicate grain, so I modified the recipe as follows: I cooked the quinoa, spices and broth in a separate saucepan, according to package instructions.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet, I sauted the onions, and garlic.  Then I added the beans/corn.  When onions/beans/corn were heated through, I VERY gently tossed in the cooked quinoa & cilantro, being careful not to stir too much.  Turned out great!   I hope this is helpful for other readers.

Simple, healthy, adaptable, yay! This was a little bland for our tastes, so I'll be kicking up the spices a notch but I'll definitely make it again. I doubled the recipe except for the black beans and added a bell pepper, and it would have served at least 6 as a main dish. (We wanted the leftovers for lunches.) It was ok cold too. Btw the bulk grains section of our groceries here are starting to carry quinoa for $3.39/lb. Ask your grocer to carry it, I was told it was up to $8.99 at health food stores.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it a few times already and I love it more and more each time.  (I usually only use 1 can of beans.)

Also, a general tip for quinoa: it cooks better if you soak it in water for an hour or so before rinsing it out and using it.

Really yummy!! Good hot or chilled, simple to make. Great blend of spices. If you haven't tried quinoa, this is a great introduction to it.

This was surprisingly excellent.  I have made quinoa 2 times and hated it.  The flavor just turned me off.  But, my husband likes it so I thought this would be a good "compromise" recipe.  When prepping to cook, I googled "cook quinoa" and found that you need to rinse it before cooking it.  RINSE IT!  It made all the difference.  The bitterness that occurs naturally on the grain disappeared and I was able to fully enjoy the dish.  We used only one can of beans and canned corn, but I followed to rest exactly.  This was just awesome and made me feel like I was eating something very healthy and nutritious.  I have already recommended this to several coworkers.  Thanks!!

Agree with other reviewers that 1 can of black beans is enough.  Interesting combo, but quite light.  Would want this to be more flavorful, if it is to stand on its own vs. as a side dish.

Delicious! I had never used Quinoa before but it was expensive so I used instead couscous, which was half the price, already cooked and it looked the same after the recipe was completed. I used chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable on hand. I also added green onions and cajun seasonings for a little more punch! This is an easy and colorful recipe to compliment any main dish.

Yum.  I was a bit leary as I have never had Quinoa before but being on a diet right now I decided I needed a high protein meal to fill me up.  I left out the cayenne pepper and used one can of beans.  I'll be taking it to lunch and eating it cold for the next few days!

delicious as is! I used fresh cilantro, cut fresh corn off cobs, and "made" the black beans from scratch (used about 1.5 cups of black beans and 3 ears of corn). At the end, after adding all the ingredients together, I kept it in the pot on very low heat to blend all the flavors together, for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sugar from the corn and the taste of the cilantro are in every bite. So good!

I love this. Its healthy and versatile. I serve it for dinner with tortillas, guacamole or avacado, sour cream, shredded lettuce, pepper jack cheese, and tomato for a burrito style meal. For breakfast I will scramble eggs and add pepper jack cheese and some hot sauce for breakfast burritos. Everyone I've ever made this for has loved it.

AMAZING! and a WONDERFUL introduction for us to quinoa, which I hear is a complete protein and contains more iron than blackstrap molasses.  It's delicious as is, or doctored up.  I've added jalapeno cheese chicken sausage once, Mexican-spiced shrimp once.  We've also topped it with salsa, a little grated cheese, black olives.  Unless you're not a black bean fan, I'd leave the ratio as is.  This is a fantastic recipe!

Cracks me up when people change the recipe and then rate it less than 5 stars.   Ummmm... Maybe their adjustments made a difference. This was excellent just the way it was written.  And to whomever asked if it really makes a difference if you use parsley in place of cilantro or skipped the cumin... Uh yea. It makes a big difference.  I made this recipe as written and it is incredible. Thank you for submitting a tasty and healthy recipe!!!

This was my first experience with quinoa, and it is absolutely delicious.  It is best served cold.  Next time I make it, I will wait until it has cooled before I add the chopped cilantro-- it wilted a bit in the hot quinoa.

Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a fabulous find.  I served it as a side dish for dinner, and had the leftovers as a main dish for lunch the next day. It keeps in the fridge for days and even gets better. Great texture, great flavor.  And so healthful!  I love cilantro and garlic, so I doubled the amount of both.  Fresh corn is in season, so I used fresh instead of frozen (just added it raw when corn was called for).  For color, I recommend adding some diced red pepper when you are browning the onion, or just stir it in raw at the end.  I will make this again and again. Thank you to 3LionCubs for providing this recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I added a drained can of stewed tomatoes as some reviewers suggested and added spice to taste, making it much spicier.  So versatile and easy to make with whatever you have in the house.  I loved this recipe and will make it again and again.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!!!!! a total crowd pleaser! even my "anit-healthy food" husband asked me to make it AGAIN! i soaked the quinoa in the vegetable broth for about 15-20 minutes before i cooked it which helped it cook faster and made it softer! we also topped it with avocado which made it a very complete meal.

Delicious, nutritious, and easy to make.  You can't go wrong with this one!  Add a little salsa, top with zingy shredded cheese and bake it up for a nice casserole, too.

This was my first recipe attempt with Quinoa. It was a great success!!! I used this as a main dish, so I felt the two cans of black beans were definitely needed. I made a few minor changes to the recipes. I used less cumin, dried cilantro (Maybe a half tablespoon) and I ended up adding a little more broth. It seemed to be getting a little too dry. I also chopped up one roma tomato. Next time will add more tomato. This dish tasted so healthy. I loved it and so did my teenage daughter. She chose to add some grated cheese and a dollop of sour cream. She loved it that way.

I'd never even heard of quinoa, much less cooked with it, so I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and toddler and I all loved it!  I halved the amount to avoid a bunch of left-overs if we didn't like it. I served it as a meatless main dish and it we ate it all. I thought the proportion of beans-quinoa-corn was perfect.  This is the sort of recipe you can play around with the seasonings to suit that of your family's preference.  Definitely a keeper!  Next time I'll make the whole amount so we can have leftovers since other reviewers noted that the leftovers were even better!

Excellent!!! I added 1/2 cup salsa, doubled the garlic, and added Quorn chikin tenders (vegetarian meat substitute). It was very, very tasty!!! Try it:)

Delicious!! Quinoa is a South American seed that is covered with a very bitter coating that protects the seeds from being eaten by birds. It is so important to rinse this coating off in a strainer with plenty of  cold running water. It can turn mushy so be gentle with it and don't mix it too long when adding the beans and cilantro. I have never soaked quinoa, as some rviewers have mentioned. So yummy and healthy, thank you:)

This was really, really good. I made it exactly as written- the beans seem like they'll be too much, but it's just right. I served it with sides of chopped tomatoes and sliced fresh jalapeños. It is going in our 'favorites' folder.

Absolutely delicious! I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth (it was what I had on hand) and I also used Bush's Seasoned Black Beans. I drained them but didn't rinse. I was worried it may be a bit bland, so the seasoned black beans may have saved the day. Regardless, this is a super easy, delicious, healthy recipe. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended!

this recipe was very good as is, and even better when the store ran out of black beans and so i had to use a combination of red beans and lima beans... even the less-than-adevnturous in my family asked for seconds.

I am a college student on a budget and have sworn to a no-eating-out to eat cheaper and healthier. I have made this recipe three times and it's easily my new favorite dish. It only takes one pot, I can stock up on the ingredients to make it again and, for someone once hopelessly addicted to Chipotle, it satisfies my burrito bowl cravings.

I've made some changes when experimenting. First, the onions and garlic seem like a lot, but I've noticed the flavors aren't really present in the final dish so I put a little bit more and brown them in olive oil with some red pepper flakes for extra heat. I toss the quinoa with them in the hot oil to toast it (Never had to soak/rinse the quinoa), and use chicken broth and part of one of those chicken stock gels for extra poultry flavor and seasoning.

Because of the chicken stock, I don't use any salt, but double the cumin, add about 1.5 as much cayenne, and lots of pepper. I'll usually taste it at this point and expect it to taste like /too much spice/, too salty, too hot, but keep in mind that these spices will disperse to cover the beans and corn. In spite of the reviews, I like the amount of beans and add both cans.

I have served this recipe with avocado slices, shredded cheddar, and a fried egg on top for a huevos rancheros-type dinner, and with chipotle marinated chicken or slices of steak on top for extra protein. My boyfriend who only seems to eat junk food LOVES this recipe, and that itself is a miracle.

For the life of me I can't understand why so many people liked this recipe. I was so excited about making this for my family and they all left majority of the food on their plate! My husband hated the black beans, my nine year old son didn't want to hurt my feelings, and my 5 year old daughter didn't want no parts!  I just hated it. I do wonder if I did not rinse the quinoa well enough. I really love the health benefits of quinoa......but in another dish. My dog liked it though :-)

What a fantastic dish!  This was the perfect introduction to quinoa.  I added about half a cup of chopped red pepper for color and sprinkled low-fat cheddar on top.  I'll also try wrapping the leftovers in a tortilla.  Thanks, Hilary!

I was really excited to try this because of all the great reviews and wanting to try a different grain in my diet. I let my boyfriend make dinner one night and gave him this recipe and not knowing the difference he used parsley instead of cilantro and couldn't find the cumin and used some "other" spices. As suggested we used only one can of black beans. Overall, even if he had used the right ingredients I didn't care for this dish. We salvaged it by sprinkling a little monterrey jack and some bottled hot sauce (green and red) we had on hand and wrapped them in warmed corn tortillas. Still I doubt I will try to make this one again. Even though I love them...I can't imagine that cumin and cilantro making enough of a difference. Soooo disapointed!

This is an extremely versatile recipe! easily adapted to anyone's tastes! I made it as written with the exception of adding some green pepper as I needed to use the last of it up.  VERY healthy and full of protein/fibre! Thanks for the recipe! A definite addition to the rotation!

I just made this exactly as the recipe reads (well, I used dried cilantro instead of fresh because I don't use a lot of fresh herbs, therefore they go to waste).  It is wonderful...fantastic! My husband loves it too! It is quite spicy, so if you are sensitive to spicy things like I am, you may want to halve the cayenne. Who knew 1/4 tsp. would do that?! Well, probably a lot of you ;o) I also only used one can of black beans only because I didn't read the recipe correctly and only had one can. I must say, though that an extra can would have made this more like "black beans with a little quinoa," you don't need more than one can.

4 stars is relative to all the recipes I've tried on this site.  5 stars if I'm only comparing healthy side dishes.  I used a whole can of beef broth and a little less cayenne (to be toddler friendly).  My guests were very impressed and even my husband commented favorably the next day (high praise from a man of few words).  When I first made this quinoa was difficult to find, now it's everywhere.

Really tasty! I use a full can of broth, as I'd rather not have 1/2 cup to figure out a use for and substitute four cups of Refried Beans Without the Refry (from this site) for the canned ones, which adds extra flavor.

I wish I had a positive review of this recipe.  I love quinoa and I love black beans, but I just didn't like 'em together.  The flavor & texture of quinoa doesn't complement that of black beans, and adding the cayenne and cumin only made this dish worse.

This was my first time cooking quinoa and I am officially hooked!! This meal was so delicious and full of flavour.(I'm Jamaican, so bland food is a big no no)I read through some of the other reviews and made some of the suggested changes such as: 1) I soaked the quinoa for 20 min. then rinsed before cooking. 2) I used chicken broth instead of veggi broth. 3) I used 1 tin of black beans and it was the perfect amount, I think 2 tins would have overpowered the quinoa. 4) I did not use as much cayenne pepper because my daughter is not a pepper fan, I used about 1/4 the amount and it gave a nice hint of flavour. 

Give this recipe a try and your taste buds will thank you later!

I've made this many, many times and it's always a hit (expect with my husband and little boys who picked up their daddy's fussy habits). I always add the quinoa to the onions and garlic and "toast" it a bit till I smell a nutty fragrance and then add the broth in. I also throw in red chopped peppers with the cilantro for a sweet, colorful crunch.

I've made this several times now, and each time I think it gets better. Originally I found it to be a little bland (I double the spices and the corn), but I've discovered a couple tricks: do not be shy with the salt, and a fresh squeeze of lemon/lime before serving goes a long way to brighten it up. Little wedges of cherry tomatoes are also a great way to add flavor.   I eat it as a main course with sweet potato fries, as a side, on spinach leaves as a salad base, in tacos, in burritos, with a fried egg and tomatoes - hot or cold, it's really great for it's flexibility.

This is such a versatile recipe--it's perfect as a side dish, main entree, a quick snack, lunch or dinner! Super quick and easy, plus is packs plenty of health benefits too! I think my favorite thing to do with this recipe is to make a large batch on Sunday and portion it out for lunches during the work week... quite budget friendly and tasty!

Yum! I'd always thought quinoa was one of those tasteless foods you eat because they're healthy, but then I tried this dish. It's loaded with protein and tastes great. I've already converted several other quinoa haters!

Wow, is this ever bland. I would maybe add lemon juice... salsa would be nice if you're not heartburn-prone like me. This makes a huge pot of bland stuff. Don't get me wrong, I love quinoa. Actually, I would double the amount of quinoa and use only ONE can of beans. Two cans is WAY too much. I will try and save this by adding sour cream and/or cheese and/or avocado. Boo. Now I have a huge pot of this to eat for the rest of the week because my bf won't even try it.

This is delicious.  I sprinkled chopped cilantro over the finished product each time I served it to make it taste fresher.  Great to take to work for lunch.  Thanks!

This recipe was so easy to make and tasty, we'll do it again. I only used 1 can of beans though, it seemed to be the right amount for us.

SIMPLE AND DELICIOUS- Like others, I used dry beans, (12 minutes in the pressure cooker to avoid canned, I'm there!) and I did use fresh corn off the cob as well. Instead of the cayenne, I finely chopped a green and red jalapeno. I had to put the remainder in the freezer immediately to keep from EATING IT ALL!!! GREAT RECIPE!

What's the point of replacing the rice, it doesn't taste even close to a good plate of black bean an rice, btw I hack into my wife's account to review this, so if you love your husbands stick to the rice and throw way the quinoa

I do enjoy the original recipe, but I do add a third of a red bell pepper, double the cayenne pepper, and reduce the black beans by half a can. Only double the cayenne if you like heat, which masks the cilantro, otherwise use a third of a cup of cilantro.

So delicious! I like it spicy, so used jalokia powder instead of cayenne and it was terrific! I will be making this again for sure.

This is wonderful. I rinsed it well before cooking and used chicken stock, even without the cilantro it is delicious.  I didnt have any. I only used one can of black beans and doubled the quinoa.  Wonderful taste and I love the texture.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was so easy! I added about a tsp of cumin while the onions and garlic were cooking, and used chicken broth instead of veg broth. I used canned corn rather than frozen, and chopped up a roasted red pepper (from a jar) and added it. I used just enough cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. Thanks for posting!

This was awesome!  My first quinoa recipe and I'm in love!  I followed the recipe and the the previous reviews and added/omitted some things - used only 1 can of black beans, omitted the spices and cilantro (because I simply forgot - oops!), added a red bell pepper with the onions and garlic, and added about 1/2 cup salsa when I mixed in the corn (this must have made up for my lack of spices).  I also served with fresh avacado and pepper jack cheese on top.  It was a hit!  Can't wait to have it again for lunch tomorrow!

This is a great quinoa recipe.  It was the first time I had ever made quinoa, and I love it so much that I haven't ventured out and tried a new recipe.  I only add one can of black beans, and I add more corn.  I also cut down on the cayenne pepper as the first time we made it was too hot for us.

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a way to cook quinoa for the first time. From the moment I tasted it I knew it would become a regular. It is amazingly comforting and exciting at the same time. The only really fresh ingredient is cilantro, so it's easy to always keep the ingredients on hand. My husband and I always eat it as a nutritious main dish...and the recipe, for us, only makes 2 servings. So usually I double it (but I don't double the black beans) and we eat it for lunch the next day. It is as good or BETTER at room temperature the next day. I toast the rinsed quinoa in a hot dry pan  before I use it and I double the cayanne. I LOVE THIS RECIPE! TRY IT! I tell all my friends about it and my coworkers drool when I bring it for lunch.

This was my first quinoa recipe and I am hooked.  It was delicious.  The cumin really made it flavorful.  I did use half of the black beans because I'm not a huge fan.  I ate it with a side of sweet potato fries and it was a great meal.

Another GREAT, quick, healthy recipe. I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne ( i like it hot). I also added some lime juice as someone else suggested. I heated up some whole wheat, low carb, low fat tortillas and spread some reduced fat sour cream on it and then put the beans on top of this and.....yummy.

This was my first time making quinoa and I definitely will make it again. I used 1 can beans as others suggested and that seemed just right.  One thing I did think though that this is way too much cilantro -- it totally overpowers the dish, and I didn't even use the full 1/2 cup. Next time I will cut down a bit on that.

This is a really good recipe that can be modified to suit taste.  I only ever use 1 can of beans, as per another review.  The most recent time I made it I added frozen peas with the corn as well as chopped red pepper and diced mango at the end.  I served it cold, as a salad, and it was AWESOME!!

My wife & I love this recipe, I have now made it twice. We serve it as a main course along with a veggie, very satisfying. I think the proportions of beans/corn/quinoa is quite nice so didn't adjust them; I did add a bit more cayenne pepper to give it a bit more kick. Next time I will double the recipe as it is so good as leftovers!

This was very good. I had tried to make quinoa a couple of times before this and both times were dismal failures. This is spicy, savory and delicious. I used only one can of beans and added some more cayenne pepper. I'll be keeping this in my recipe box as THE way to make quinoa.. thanks

I really liked this recipe as a side dish. Super healthy, lots of flavor, and it tastes great. If I'd do anything different next time, I'd add one less can of beans. I like the quinoa more than beans.

First time I've had quinoa and this recipe impressed!!! I added red bell peppers and only used 1 can of beans. Also I only had packet enchilada seasoning so that's what I used. I made sure to rinse the quinoa before cooking and added a bit more veggie broth. I ended up simmering the quinoa for a bit longer because it wasn't all the way cooked after 20 minutes... 
Final thought: Delicious & Easy!!! Will be a new addition to the regular menu!!

This was absolutely amazing!  I make it all the time...I sometimes add a squeeze of lime...slice an avocado on the side and some sour cream with scallions mixed in...Quinoa is so versatile...I've also made breakfast pudding with it...so glad I gave it a chance and tried it! :)

Very good!  I added both cans of black beans and if you are wanting this as a meal, I would recommend doing the same.  I sauteed the quinoa for a bit before adding the broth.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and fresh mushrooms to add more bulk as I wanted this to be a full meal in itself.  Great combo and would be easy to tweak for individual taste.

This is a very good healthy recipe and easy to make.  I only used one can of black beans and that was plenty!  Two would be too much!  I also cut the cumin to about 1/2 tsp.  This would be good with added cooked chicken.  The next day I used the leftovers to make a cold salad by adding a little balsamic vinegrete and some slivered blanched almonds.  I think there is a variety of things you could  do to change it up.

I've cooked quinoa before, and while I liked it, I never really liked it enough to get hungry for it.  This recipe has changed all of that!  After having a second helping as large as the first helping, I had to make myself quit eating it.  This is really tasty, and I look forward to making it again and again.  I'm eagerly anticipating eating the leftovers.  I think it would also be good in a tortilla with salsa and avocado.  Thank you 3LIONCUBS for this yummy and healthy recipe!  Loved it!

So I goofed and cooked the quinoa in water instead of broth.  No Harm...No Foul though!  Everyone enjoyed it.
My modifications (what I had on hand) - 1 cup chopped green onion, 2 TBS of minced garlic, 1 C quinoa, 2 cups water, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, 1 can corn, 1 can of black beans (2 would have been too much), 2/3 cup chopped tomato, and lemon and lime juice.  :)

I followed this recipe to a T other than adding in mushrooms and omitting 1 can of black beans (that would have been way too much!)  and I don't think it had a lot of flavor. It was missing something, although I am not sure what. I would omit the cilantro too. I didn't care much for that. Very bland. Won't make it again.

Amazing recipe! I squirted a little lemon juice on top and served with sauteed spinach. So delicious.

This was my first attempt at Quinoa. It was great! Followed the recipe to the T, except I did not have broth so used water instead (but it was still flavorful). I served it topped with salsa which was delicious. Highly recommend this recipe!

Really really good. I was wondering what I was going to do with all this quinoa I bought at costco. I just started looking into different recipes. Also only used one can of black beans, two would of been too much. Will be making this one again!

Wow!!!!!  I've never tried quinoa and I was kind of skeptical.  I mean "healthy" often equals anywhere from bland to downright gross in my book.  But, in an effort to cut back on all the junk food this world has to offer and to eat more healthy food, I've searched the internet for tasty foods that are also good for me.  This recipe easily fills both categories for me!  YUM!!!  I stuck to the original recipe other than toasting the quinoa first and using low sodium chicken broth instead of veg. broth (it's what I had in the house).  The spices gave it just the right amount of kick.  I highly recommend this recipe!

We weren't familiar with Quinoa but decided to give it a try.  Boy are we glad we did.  This is an excelent side dish and my kids couldn't get enough.  Now we are anxious to try the Turkey and Quinoa Meatloaf recipe on this site also.  We did have a little trouble finding where to purchase quinoa.  Apparently Costco and Trader Joes carry it.

Sooooo Good!  Only changes I made were to sub beef broth for the veg and increase the cayenne because I like it spicy.  Oh, and I only used one can of beans, it was plenty.

LOVE THIS!! I don't follow recipes exactly and, aside from the quinoa, I don't measure much. I sauteed diced green onions, 1/2 each red & green bellpeppers, and fresh garlic in olive oil. Added pepper, chili powder, cayenne pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder (mmm garlic) then toasted the rinsed quinoa. I added a can of low sodium diced tomatos *undrained* and a can of diced green chiles then some sliced black olives. One cup of "no chicken" broth and about 1/2 cup water. I put in a mixed can of kidney/pinto/black beans because it sounded good, normally black beans would be great. One thing I haven't seen on reviews is adding a bit of nutritional yeast (1/4-1/2 cup). It makes it a little creamy and cheesy. So good. Eat with tortilla chips or as taco/burrito filling.

I made this originally for a vegetarian guest who came to our dinner party, but now I make it for myself all the time!  I double the cayenne and the cumin, because I love the spice.  I also usually throw in some red bell pepper.  I handed out 3 copies of the recipe at my party!  Everyone loved it!

Wow!  This is absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I added some additional vegetable broth because all of the broth was soaked up with 7 minutes to go.  I just dumped in what was left of the can.  My husband and neighbors raved about this and there wasn't a single drop left.  Forget "Serves 10," this barely served 4!  Thanks for a great recipe, a definite keeper!

I was so looking forward to making this. So many great reviews. I made it exactly as written, except I used chicken broth instead of vegetarian,  and cut it in half for  smaller family,which should should not have  affected the dish It's a gloppy mess like library paste with no flavor I can't imagine how it got great reviews

I added extra garlic and seasoning because I like things spicy.  I also doubled the corn because I love it.  I also topped each serving with mexican cheese blend (2%, melted) and it was fabulous!

Very good. Used only one can of the black beans, and added 1/4 c chopped red bell pepper plus half of a jalapeno, minced. Also added the juice of half a lime at the end. Very tasty, but I like things spicier. Next time I'll add the whole jalapeno and a little more of the seasonings.

This one's a winner - definitely a permanant addition to my recipe box. Do halve the beans - and yes, this is a wonderful burrito filling, especially with some melted monterey jack cheese. Make enough for leftovers, as it's better the 2nd and 3rd days.

I cooked this dish twice. The first time I followed the exact recipe. I could not have had a more enjoyable introduction to quinoa! The added texture with the addition of corn and the balance of cayenne and cumin --perfection! The second time, I added shrimp, fresh diced tomatoes, jalapenos and additional chicken broth. FINAL NOTE: i did not add any salt because of the "reduced" sodium in the broth and the canned beans. OMGoodness!!!! This recipe is a winner.

Made this several times and everyone always loves it - even the people who've never had quinoa. Zesty.  I used 1 can black beans instead of 2 and skipped the cilantro (hate that stuff).

Like some of the other reviewers I have a fiancé who is a little skeptical of healthy dishes and he licked his plate clean! (So did I!) i cannot believe how tasty this was and I even turned it into a main dish by cleaning out my cabinet.  I added 1 breast of chicken I had on hand (diced it and sautéed w the onion, marinated w some crushed red pepper flakes, garlic and pepper for a few hours prior), cut the recipe in half, used chicken broth instead of veggie, EVOO instead of veg oil, more than doubled cayenne pepper ( we love things very spicy), and use freeze dried cilantro bc that's what I had on hand.  Toyed with the idea of adding a can of garbanzo beans but decided to try it without for the first time.  May add them next time just to add some extra protein and bc I love them!  Will def make the full amount next time and keep the leftovers for lunches the next day.  5 servings turned out to be 2 and between the crushed red pepper and all the cayenne, it was super spicy! Can't wait to make this again and again! Thanks so much for a recipe I can feel so good about!

Love this recipe! I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of corn. My secret punch: squirt some lime over each serving. Brightens everything up!

This is a very good recipe. I cheated and bought a container of Pam's southwest back bean salsa which has black beans , corn, onion and red pepper in a olive oil  and added to the quinoa. Even better. Delicious!!!

This is a great recipe!  I love to add red pepper and green onion because I think those flavors go great with black beans.  This is an incredible versatile recipe.

Freezes beautifully as well.  My go-to gift for new mothers.

This was excellent!! First time cooking/eating quinoa and am definitely a fan. I used one can of black beans like the other reviewers suggest. We spooned ours into little corn tortillas, topped with a bit of sour cream... yum yum yum. A new favorite is found.

I started looking into vegan meals when my brother was fighting his battle with cancer. He asked for better 'vegan' recipes. He lost his battle last month but I know he would have loved this recipe. Very healthy, very hearty and above all very tasty! Also, made the house smell sooooo goooood!

I thought this was wonderful!  It was the first time I've ever tried quinoa, so I didn't know what to expect.  It was fabulous.  Next time I might put less spice in it, but overall it was great.  The only thing I did differently was that I cooked it in a rice cooker.  I sauted the onions and garlic as the recipe states and then put everything in the rice cooker with a bullion cube for some extra flavor.

Delicious. To prevent the Quinoa from becoming mushy keep the ratio the same as the recipe states (2/1) but simmer for 15 min. only.

Excellent dish-- I eat as a main course but could easily be a side dish. When making it as a main course I use 1 can of beans and add in zucchini to save on calories. I also up the cumin to a tablespoon because I love that spice. Fresh cilantro is best, but I've used dried and it was still good. 

If you are new to cooking with quinoa, simmer means turn it way down to low. The first time I made this I left the burner on medium heat and the liquid evaporated before the quinoa was cooked- an easy fix, just add more vegetable broth. You will know it's cooked when the quinoa looks more flat and disc shaped than small and round.

So simple yet so satisfying. I'd say the time frame on this recipe is very realistic too, I appreciate that.

This was the first time making quinoa and I have to say this recipe is AWESOME!!!  LOVE!  LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!  The proportions and flavors are great, and I only changed the directions slightly. I used one can of organic black beans (Publix brand), added the zest and juice of one lemon, half a can of gluten free diced spicy red peppers by Hunt's, and a couple of dashes of Sazon Completa. Make sure you rinse your quinoa!!!! Otherwise this might come out very bitter. I actually soaked my quinoa for about 10 mins (the length of time it took me to chop up the onions and garlic and sautee them). Also, hold back your garlic until your onions are at least halfway done or it will burn, and throw in the quinoa shortly after. Toasting it lends amazing flavor. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T. Enjoy!!! I hope you love it as much as I do! =)

This was so easy and tasty. I made exactly as stated but only one can black beans until it came time for cilantro. I didn't have enough. So I brainstormed and added fresh salsa from the day before (plenty of cilantro there) and it was fantastic.

I just tried this and it was delicious!! However, i cooked the quinoa in half cup of the canned diced tomato juice and half cup of chicken broth for more flavor. I cooked the quinoa through then added the cilantro, tomatoes, corn, and black beans. Served with shredded grilled chicken marinated in lemon juice, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper; and shredded romaine lettuce, diced avacado sprinkled with lemon juice and topped with grated cheese :) with a side of warm tortillas to make a burrito. will definitely make again.

I love quinoa and loved this recipe too. Being that cumin can overpower a dish, I cut way back on the amount. I'm also not a cilantro fan so I subbed with fresh parsley. Such a healthy little dish and thank you!!

Very, very good.  Just a note, you never have to soak Quinoa...and the recipe doesn't call for it.  It becomes like mush if you soak it; rinsing it off (if you buy in bulk it hasn't been rinsed) gets rid of any bitter taste.  Some prepackaged quinoa has already been rinsed.

I've made this about 6 times and love it every time! And everyone I've served it to raves about it, even people not familiar with quonia. The only change I've made is to only use 1 can of black beans. Try this!!

Loved this recipe - I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and it was perfect - wouldn't mind adding a little crunch to it next time - toasted pine nuts are always a good bet for that - don't leave off the fresh coriander - it really makes a difference IMO - thanks so much for this recipe, definitely a keeper.

The whole family loved this.  Even my very, very picky daughte!  I halved the black beans and used chicken broth.  I also added red pepper and green pepper for added color/nutrition. I cut an avocado in half and removed the pit, and spooned the quinoa into the avocado.  It looked amazing and tasted delicious with the bites of avocado.  I made it last night and I'm making a huge batch tonight and adding tofu.  We can eat it for lunch throughout the week!  Delicious.  OH - I also used frozen cilantro cubes which worked fab.

Update 7/23/2012
I made this again and used water instead of broth.  I also used 1/4 cup parsley instead of cilantro (not a big fan).  It was still really good!  I think next time I'll add a tablespoon of butter at the end just to make it a little bit creamier.
May 28,2012 I really enjoyed this dish!  I used a yellow pepper instead of cilantro and enjoyed the sweetness it added.  I used vegetable broth and can see how chicken broth would add to the flavor as well.  This is certainly a dish you could add more veggies to and make it even better.

The flavors were great. Even the hubby and child liked the flavors, they just weren't sold on the texture of the quinoa. The only modification I did was add only 1 can of black beans. and next time I will add more colorful veggies to the mix. I only cooked mine a total of 20 min. at 12-15 I added the corn and can of black beans and heated them thru. Overall a very good recipe base. Thanks

Had an unexpected southwestern flavor to it. Surprising but very good. Instead of chopping the onion, I added onion chunks and the garlic to chicken broth and pureed in the magic bullet; separated the solids from the broth and cooked according to directions. At the end, I found my quinoa still too firm so I added more chicken broth at the end and simmered until tender. Only used half the black beans recommended and added chopped sauteed mushrooms.  Delicious. Husband really liked it.

Excellent! When it was done, I did add a squirt of lemon juice, some chopped tomato and a little green onion.  I also used canned whole kernel corn since I did not have any frozen.

LOVED THIS!! This was my first time with quinoa and I made the recipe exactly as stated - very, very tasty!  My only thought is that it has a very "latin" flare and as such, it seemed like it should have some tomatoes and/or salsa. I think I'll try adding that, next time - but otherwise this was wonderful as is!  One note: a tad bit spicy to those who don't like spice ... Although, my husband said it could be spicier for him.  Use the cayenne to your own liking.

This was such a hit with visitors during the week my family and my husband's family came to visit. We ALL really enjoyed it! It's excellent just the way it is. For a little variation, today I am making it again adding sauteed chicken, spinach, and zucchini into it!

This was good. The spices help mellow the bitterness of the quinoa. I have made this type of sidedish with white rice, but I think the quinoa makes an interesting change. I did toast the grain before adding it to the liquid.

Nothing about this I don't like.  Delicious hot or cold, in a burrito or as a side dish.  Everyone who has had it wants the recipe, including those who have never eaten quinoa and don't know what it is.  I have found that in recipes like this one, I prefer cooking the quinoa in a rice cooker and then adding it to the other ingrediants.  The only other change I made was that I used one can of black beans and one of black eyed peas because that's what I had on hand.

We love this! It was my first time to make quinoa, and after having such success, I've started using it more. This recipe is packed full of flavor, making for a delicious and healthy side dish. I used chicken broth, because I didn't have vegetable broth, and it worked fine. I also added diced mushrooms simply because I had some I needed to use. I am interested to try with diced tomatoes, but this recipe is delicious as-is. Thanks!

Fabulous! I added red and yellow bell peppers and used chicken broth rather than vegatable broth. This was a simple, healthy delicious dish.

my brother turned me onto this recipe ... he said he added cooked chicken at the end and used it as a complete meal ... I tried it the same way and we loved it.  This will make the regular rotation in our house ... I don't buy frozen corn, so I used a can, drained, instead.

Didn't have quinoa, so I used bulgar wheat. I used fresh corn off the cob-raw and had only a little cilantro in my garden so I added oregano and thyme. Also added fresh tomato chunks. This was fantastic.  Used as a main dish meal and it felt so good and healthy!  Delicious flavor!

This was delicious and easy.  So healthy, too.  I'll admit, I grated some crumbled Queso Fresco cheese on top, before topping it with the cilantro, but that couldn't have added too much fat or calories.  next time Maybe sub parsley and feta for the cilantro and queso fresco!  I also always use frozen corn in dishes like this, it tasts fresh and sweet.  This was much better than quinoa I have had in restaurants.

My kids eat this - even my extraordinarily picky 6 year old - and ask for more.  Our Colombian maid who hated most American dishes ate this like there was no tomorrow.  Fills you up.  Definitely a keeper.

This was our first time trying quinoa and it was delicious and easy!  We'll definitely make it again.  I liked the recipe exactly as it was, but will try variations too.  My husband said 'five stars'!  Thank you for introducing me to quinoa - yummy!!

First time trying quinoa, it was awesome! I added fresh squeezed lime juice (to taste), next time I will try all fresh ~ without sauteing onions & garlic, maybe add tomato...the possibilities are endless!!

Great recipe. I've tried quinoa before, and found it to be tasteless. This recipe provided a very flavorful dish. Some substitutions I made- 1/2 tsp. curry in place of cumin, and I used one can of white kidney beans with the tomato sauce drained.

Oh my goodness---I don't think there is a word that could do the justice of describing just how delicious this dish is! I never thought I'd live to taste something so healthy and tasty at once. It is simply the best! I made the recipe as is.  The two cans of beans called for are perfect. I LOVE this dish!!!! And it's too good to just be a side dish so I like it as my main dish. It's too easy to make yet delicious and therefore, I will make it often and also bring it to the next potluck I attend. I intend to also make it a regular item around the house now since it's so good in every way possible for you!!! A million thanks to the person who submitted this recipe!!! This is my second time making quinoa (my first didn't turn out too well because it was tasteless) and this recipe has got me hooked on this power grain probably for life now! Thank you!

This was quite good, though even better the next day in a tortilla wrap. I made it exactly as it is written, and I thought the two cans of black beans worked just right.

Outstanding!  I tried a quinoa recipe that was written on the back of a box of quinoa and didn't care for it.  I decided to give it another try and I'm so glad I picked this recipe.  It made me a believer in quinoa.  I will definitely make this again!

I have tried quinoa before, but this was my first time to make it.  WOW!!!  It was better than any other I have tasted.  I have recommended this recipe to everyone I know.  The second time, I added kale and diced tomatoes just because I needed to use them and it was just as good.  My kids request this recipe all the time (even if they had it the night before).  If I could I would give this recipe more than 5 stars!!!  Simple and delicious.

Excellent! I took the advice of others and only used 1 can of black beans.  I was afraid that it was going to be too spicy but it was perfect.  I served it with bread and butter to help cool down your mouth a little, although it really isn't too spicy just flavorful.  I've cooked it twice so far and it was delicious both times.  Good as leftovers too.

I thought this was excellent and very easy. I found the amount of beans just right. I did add a little more cayenne, as well as a generous splash of cider vinegar at the end.  Also, as I am not a fan of cilantro, I used the same amount of chives instead.

A great way to use Quinoa. I doubled the amount of Quinoa, adding 3 cups of veg. broth, used 1 can of black beans and lots of fresh cilantro.
Watch out for the salt - you may need no extra if the veg. broth is salty.

Very tasty dish. Made it according to the recipe exactly - no modifications and twas delicious IMHO. It makes about 5 cups and one cup is 315 calories, 2.6 grams fat, 14.6 grams protein and 57.8 grams of carbs.

WOW!  Where's the six-star rating?! I had this for the first time at a friend's house.  Her 17 year old son had made it for dinner - he added some cranberries along with the black beans and cilantro,  and sprinkled it with feta before serving.  He sent us the allrecipes.com link for this recipe because after trying different versions of this, he said he liked this one the best.  I made it last night to accompany our tacos, but it can also easily stand alone.  This would be a perfect pot-luck side, and is easy to take to work for a quick lunch that doesn't need to be reheated in the office microwave.  Plenty of protein helps satisfy hunger and keeps you feeling full without all the calories, it's gluten free, and it's easy to experiment with in order to add your own flavors and style.  It's rare that such a healthy dish makes such an impression.  Go for it.  You won't be sorry!

This dish was simply awesome!  Easy to make too.  I didn't add the corn as I do not eat it.  The one thing I did do different is I sauteed the  quinoa with the onions and garlic.  A recent tip someone gave me and it does make it better.  The second time I did this I added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest and raw, minced garlic on top and I loved it.

I like this mostly as a side.  Love to serve it with the salsa chicken recipe on this site. It makes a lot so I usually do 1/2 cup quinoa,  1 cup chicken broth,  and 1 can of black beans, with everything else the same.

This recipe makes it easy for my kids and I to eat vegan!  I have made this over 20 times and it is perfect just as it is written, although I do usually double the amount of cumin and add 2 teaspoons of curry powder.  I have also made all types of substitutions based on what I have on hand. Rather than corn I have used peas and carrots.  I also have used edamame rather than corn.  If I want a little less sodium I have replaced half of the vegetable broth with water. At times I also use one can of black beans rather than two.  It is very difficult to mess up this delicious recipe!  It tastes great warm or cold.  P.S. To rinse off the bitter taste of the quinoa, do not forget to soak the quinoa in water for a few minutes before you begin.

This was my first experience with Quinoa. I was very hesitant to it because of the mixed reviews I was getting. This recipe was so amazing that it was directly put in my recipe book and will stay there forever. I made a few tweaks to the recipe. I added only one can of black beans and added more spices (but i love spicy food.) I also used just plain water and added in an extra 1/4 cup. You dont have to use vegetable both water works just as nice and is free. I also just added a whole can of corn instead of just a cup. I also added one cup of quinoa and two cups of water. This recipe is so good and i made pork shanks with it they complimented each other very well.

My 10 year old daughter asked me to PLEASE give this dish a 5 star review. I agree, so here it is! I took the advise of other reviewers and added just one can of black beans, which was perfect for us. One reviewer said she used paprika instead of cayenne so her young child would eat it. I added both, and loved the addition of paprika! I probably used a 1/2 tsp, maybe a bit more. I also took the advise of other reviewers who waited to add the garlic until about 1/2 way through cooking the onion. I also added the quinoa to toast a bit before adding the spices, then finally, the liquid. Yummy toasty flavors developed this way. I baked 3 chicken breasts in balsamic vinaigrette (Costco Kirkland brand) for 30 minutes while I prepared the quinoa dish. I cut up the chicken into bit size pieces, and lightly tossed it into the quinoa dish. I served it in bowls and topped with grated cheddar cheese, sour cream and salsa. Easy dish! done in 40 minutes tops!

Next time I would add sliced avocado as a garnish per my daughters request. Honestly, there are so many great ways you could vary this dish. 

Thank you so much for sharing this economical, easy and tasty recipe! That meets all of my criteria for the perfect dinner! We had no left overs, but I think the dish would be great for lunch the next day.

I love this recipe got it from my grandmother who got it from here.  I personally don't like that much cilantro so I put much less I would suggest to add to personal taste. Makes a lovely side that's even better cold.  Perfect for lunch the next day.

This was the first quinoa recipe I've tried. Made it once for dinner and another time doubled the recipe for a dinner party side dish. Everyone loved it. Very healthy and delicious.

This recipe is a winner! Definitely a great alternative to black beans & rice. I added more salt than the recipe calls for, just to taste. I served this with Cheddar Baked Chicken & Skillet Corn, both recipes from this site. I will definitely be making this again.

3/5  I did not use the soy sauce because I was out.

The dish was pretty bland for me.  I had an easy homemade salad dressing on the side for salad and my husband put it in the quinoa.  It really was delicious.

This was OK. Followed recipe to a T, tasted a small amount thought it was quite bland, added a 1/2 cup of basil pesto and what a difference! Very hearty and healthy dish.  Will make again but will make sure to have pesto on hand.

WOW!!!  I did modify the recipe a bit...  I'm a fan of quinoa, so I upped the amount to 1 cup.  Used red onion and chicken stock (in place of white onion and veg stock) and olive oil in place of veg oil.  With the increase in quinoa, I increased the liquid to 2 cups, having to add a little more while simmering.  I added a little fresh chopped broccoli with the corn, used chopped spinach in place of the cilantro and only used one can of black beans.  I also added a pinch of Kurbiskonig ("Spice Mix Pumpkin King") from Herbaria in addition to the other spices.  This recipe is so versatile.  AWESOME!

Made the receipe again...  ...this time I added some amaranth to the quinoa.  ...turned out great.

Loved it. The only changes I made were to add a red pepper and use vegetable culinary stock instead of vegetable broth.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent!  I've made it several times already for me and my husband.  I only use one can of the black beans and use chicken broth instead of vegetable.  I also like to add chopped red peppers or tomatoes.  It's very good with sliced avocado on a wheat tortilla.   Try it!

Fantastic! I used canned corn in place of the frozen corn, added chopped tomatoes and served with chicken, avocado, and tortillas with lime wedges on the side.

Wow!  One of the best dishes I have made in a long time...

I do recommend 2 cups of vegetable broth, however, to make a dish a little more moist.

After being diagnosed with diabetes I was worried I'd be doomed to a life of awful, tasteless food.  I started playing around with various grains and also thought I'd give Quinoa a try.  At first I wasn't crazy about it by itself.  But then I came across this recipe and my life was changed forever!  I had 20+ over for Mother's Day to eat.  I made just a single recipe thinking I'd be the only one eating it.  Boy, was I wrong.  The bowl was empty in no time.
I've since learned to embrace Quinoa and now love it's versatility.  I've even used it in place of rice in a rice pudding recipe!

WOW!!!! This recipe is amazing! Even my boyfriend loved it! I did make a few changes - I used red quinoa, only one can of beans (rinsed to get rid of the sodium), no corn (all starch, no nutrition), and no sodium chicken broth. I added some chopped orange mini bell peppers to the onion, sautéed, added the garlic, sautéed a little more, added the seasonings ( a tiny extra cayenne and only a tiny sprinkle of salt, some black pepper, and the amount of cumin called for). I stirred with the seasoning, added the quinoa and cooked a little more, then added the beans and the chicken broth. I prefer the beans cooked more rather than added at the end, but they absorbed some of the liquid so I had to add some more broth for the quinoa to cook enough, but in the end, I had an AMAZING dish! I served it with skinless boneless chicken breasts that had marinated in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and basil, and then cooked it in a sauté pan with no added oil. The balsamic kind of burned and blackened the chicken and it was delicious!

This was really great and very versatile.  I think next time I'll add some more citrus and some diced tomatoes.  Sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, really any veggie you can think of would be wonderful.

*Really good*, especially considering the simplicity of the recipe. The flavors all come together to create something that is really tasty, and quite kid-friendly (all my kids loved it, from the 2 year old to the 6 year old). Very easy to make, and I almost always have the ingredients on hand. Also, a one pot dish! 
The only substitution I make is I switch out the frozen corn with TJs soycattash frozen veggie blend, only because I rarely have straight up frozen corn on hand. It's delicious!

This was surprisingly good! I've tried Quinoa once before and didn't really like the way it tasted, but I prepared this way it tasted awesome. I made a half recipe with 3/4 of a can of beans and it was perfect. Me and my dad finished it off in one evening; it was awesome with some sour cream. Letting the cilantro sit with the other ingredients for a little bit longer did take some of the bite out, leaving the flavor. Thanks for the awesome, healthy recipe!

I like this!  I do love black beans and rice more I think, but this is healthier so I can make the switch.  It was too spicy for me.  I will take the cayenne down a notch next time.  I grilled some chicken to go with it.

So delicious and I will definitely make this again! But my quinoa was too mushy even though I used 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup. I will use only 1 cup veggie broth for 1 cup quinoa and add more cayenne pepper next time. YUM!

LOVED this recipe. I halved it b/c it was just for me and my husband and we still had leftovers. I topped it with some fresh guacamole and some salsa, it was super delicious, and super easy! The Quinoa i bought said pre-washed on the box, so i didn't wash and it tasted great! Did i mention is was delicious?

This recipie was absolutley delicious, I felt the flavors were all there, and complimented each other nicely, I liked the use of ingredients that kepth the dish native to its south american roots! The only thing I will do differently next time would be to reduce the amount of time i actually cook the quinoa, it seemed slightly over cooked after i simmered for 20 minutes.

Quinoa was very good. I doubled the amount of quinoa & vegetable broth in addition to the seasoning amounts. I kept the amount of black beans, onion, garlic, corn and cilantro the same. Came out nice and smoking with a hint of heat.

When I made this, it seemed highly salty and then I noticed the salt content of the vegtable broth and it was unbelievable.  I'm going to try it next with low sodium broth.

This recipe was really delicious!!  As per other peoples suggestions I only added one can of black beans, I also toasted the Quinoa for about a minute before pouring in the veg broth. At the end I decided to add about half a can of diced tomatoes for extra flavor and color!! I would definitely make this again!

Made this recipe tonight for the first time. I added only one can of black beans and it was plenty. I think two cans would be too much. This was delicious. I had about a half cup and it was very filling. I will probably add a tad bit more cilantro next time. Yummy!!!

First time cooking quinoa and based on reviews I decided to try this recipe as an introduction. It was amazing! I used olive oil and added some yellow peppers to the sauté. I also added extra garlic. I can't wait to try this recipe tomorrow once all the flavors have married together! This will definitely be a staple in my new healthy food quest!

I tried a quinoa recipe right after my daughter was diagnosed with celiac disease.  (She can't eat anything with gluten in it -- like wheat -- anymore).  Both my teenagers hated it.  After reading this recipe and a lot of the comments, I tried once more.  They loved it!!  So did my husband.  I followed the suggestions to rinse the quinoa and use just one can of beans.  Used chicken broth too since that was what I had at home.  This will become a regular dish at my home.

This is so easy and very delicious (and healthy)! I usually cut back on the beans to one can and increase the corn to 1 1/2 cups.

I got couscous and quinoa mixed up, but it's delicious with couscous too! Easier to just do 1 cup couscous/quinoa, and 2 cups broth. Loved it.

Amazing!! I joined allrecipes just so I could review this recipe. I made this for my quinoa dubious family and it was a home run. I was really excited to try this cold however there were no leftovers after my family got to it. It was a completely filling, comforting, and healthy dish. The only thing I will change next time is more cayenne and more quinoa. I thought there were too many beans in the original recipe and I wanted more nutty quinoa flavors to come through. But still an amazing combinations of flavors and a new favorite recipe.

I have been wanting to try a recipe using quinoa and this was it.  Great recipe.  Only changes I made were to use 1 can of the black beans and I used chicken broth instead of veg broth.   I ate it hot right off the stove.  Can't wait to see what it tastes like cold.

YUM!  Nutritious and so tasty, this recipe will go into my regular rotation.  We're not big cilantro fans, so I just used about 1 Tbsp dried.

I have never had quinoa before and I wanted a meatless dish to have during Lent.  I thought this was very delicious and filling.  It was very easy to make.  I followed the exact recipe, but did not add salt.  I would definitely make this again.  If you are on the Weight Watchers plan, it is 5 Points Plus for a 3/4 cup serving.

I know people get annoyed when you review a recipe that you changed but sometimes you either don't have all the ingredients or have to make changes depending on dietary needs/preferences. 

Anyway, I followed the recipe for the most part. I didn't have veggie broth so used a half cup of salsa (as another reviewer suggested) and still the full amount of water. When I added the quinoa to the onions, I did saute them for a few minutes before adding the salsa and water. The only other modification was that instead of 2 cans of blackbeans, I did one of blackbeans and 1 can red kidney beans. Very tasty recipe and you HAVE to use fresh cilantro. It adds so much flavor. Thanks so much for the super healthy and tasty recipe.

Really healthy and filling. Added tomatoes and wrapped it all in a whole wheat tortilla. Added a little extra on the spices too. Highly recommended!

Delicious! I made a couple of modifications to the recipe, based on the suggestion of other reviewers: I added only 1 can of black beans, which I thought was plenty.  I also added a finely chopped red bell pepper when sauteing the onion and garlic, and used heaping measurements of the cumin and cayenne pepper for some extra kick.  I thought the dish was excellent!  Very flavorful, with a nice spice.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  Made only a couple adjustments:  used 1 can of beans as 2 seemed too much.  I also reduced the cayenne down to 1/8 teaspoon so it wouldn't be too much for the young kids.  Tried quinoa for the fist time over Christmas and now I am wondering why I hadn't heard of it before!  Love it!  Low in calories and no cholesterol!

Awesome. I think I have taken the time to actually write a review for maybe 5-10 recipes, tops (I know, I am terrible!). However, that should tell you how good this is. I made no additions or substitutions - which never happens - and it was wonderful! The base (onion, garlic, broth and quinoa) is a great starting point...I can't wait to try different combinations. Thank you for this recipe!

Easy and tasty.  My family normally doesn't like quinoa, but they gobbled this down.  The spices were just right for my kids who normally like mild salsa.

My first time trying Quinoa and it was absolutely delicious! My husband loved it too-and the left overs were just as good. 
The best kind of comfort food--because it is good for you!

First time making quinoa.  Great recipe.  Not sure if it's supposed to be served cold or hot.  I do think 2 cans of beans is appropriate vs. other reviewers cutting back to one.  I agree with the reviewer below that adding tomato, advocado and a squirt of lemon would be good.  Going to try that version next time.

This was awesome!  First time making quinoa and I was blown away how good this was.  Made the recipe just as is, except I omitted the corn.  Thanks for this recipe, it will become a staple in my household.

I am a huge fan of cilantro, but did not enjoy it in this dish. I thought it was very tasty before I added the cilantro, but after adding it there were too many flavors going on. It tasted overcomplicated. I will definitely make this agin, but w/out the cilantro, thank you for the recipe!

I don't think it was quite as good as it could have been. I only added 3/4 of a can of beans, and wish I would have added the whole 14oz can of broth. The recipe is unique though and, with a few changes, I see it having potential in a stuffed pepper. EDIT: I added some salsa. That gave it exactly the zing and substance it needed.

WOW!!! This is DELISH! I added Red Bell pepper and used Red Onion. I also used Curry powder instead of Cayenne Pepper. And as a lot of people on here said, watch the salt! I used about a teaspoon of Sea Salt and it was a tad bit too salty for my liking. 

Overall this is a fabulous recipe for Quinoa!

This was a really simple and tasty dish!  I used a red pepper instead of onion, used only 1 can of black beans and 1 can of whole kernel corn.  I'd never cooked quinoa before, but I'd consider this first attempt quite a success!

We loved this! I did make some changes of course and my family chowed down! First, I didn't have cilantro so it was left out but I bet it's amazing with it. Second, I left out the corn due to personal tastes. I added some chopped tomatoes and used green onions (a lot, we love onion) At the end I mixed it with some plain shredded chicken and used it as a soft taco filling. It was WONDERFUL! My three year old is a good eater as it is but he could not get enough. A great keeper and something I will make again and again

Pretty good! I loved this with some grilled chicken. My daughter and niece did not like this though. They don't know what they were missing! I didn't have the Cilantro and I used kidney beans instead of the black beans. That is what I had on hand.

Seriously great!  I made exactly as stated except I rinsed and soaked my quinoa for about 10 minutes.   Delish!  Yummy hot or cold!

Delicious, simple, quick, and filling! I only used 1 can of black beans & it was plenty. I used 1/2 cup peas & 1/2 cup corn and added some sauteed spinach to the mixture. Also added 1/2 red bell pepper to the onion & garlic saute and doubled the spices. Came out colorful, flavorful, and tasty. Topped it with some chopped avocado & lime juice....Yummy!

I omitted the corn and added diced tomatoes. Very tasty. It was my first time eating quinoa and I'll make this again.

Easy, fast and healthy.  Made a large portion.  I added some feta cheese and liked how that contributed to the flavors in the dish.  I liked the hint of spice from the cayenne pepper.

4/8/2011 - This was my first quinoa experience.  I liked this dish but thought the black beans and corn were the main flavors I tasted.  Still not sure I know what quinoa tastes like.  But since it's so good for you, I'll probably make it again. *** 5/7/2013 - The 2nd time I made this, I used a packaged Garlic Quinoa. It was all I could find. It seemed to be seasoned better. It made a healthy lunch.

Ok, started the annual spring diet again!  Saw this recipe and just made it.  Holy cow, it is awesome!  The flavor is exceptional, and you can't get much healthier than this.  As others suggested, I will cut back on the black beans and will definitely add some salsa for color and flavor.  Thanks soooo much for this recipe :)

awesome. i only used one can of black beans, and PLEASE make sure you soak the quinoa before cooking. there is a detergent coating on all quinoa which can be very irritating to the GI track. 

i also added Sriracha for more kick!!

This is not only easy and healthy, but absolutely delicious!  When I'm making it for non-vegatarians, I use chicken broth, but it's also excellent when made totally vegetarian.  We like to have it in whole wheat tortillas with avocados, salsa, olives, lettuce, etc., available on the side. It's even economical!   This is one of my go-to recipes!

Absolutely yummy! I only used a 1/2 can of black beans; I thought that was enough! And I didn't have any cayenne and that was fine left out too! This was so good and I WILL make it again!

Very tasty. Husband actually commented that it was good. Only added one can of black beans. Seemed to be just enough. We are not big fans of cilantro, so we omitted that step.

This was very good, our first time of eating quinoa. I left out the cilantro as some of us don't like that and also left the corn on the side to add individually. I used chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth and only added 1 can of beans. It was really good and will serve again. Do not add the salt if you're using chicken broth, makes it slightly too salty.

I will not make again. This is edible but there is not much flavor and I expected more from this dish. I even added diced green bell for crunch and color with no success. This did surprise me with the spice factor... it was spunky and I like spice. My husband was unimpressed by this side dish too. We both like quinoa and will be looking for something else. Also, I used one can of black beans... two would have been an overkill.

Super-easy to make, and definitely a good base to start with, but it needed more flavours to be truly satisfying. I was thinking that red pepper and carrot would help to round out the flavour, and some walnuts would jazz up the texture.

Delicious!  I think it would have been even better with a can of (drained) diced tomatoes added!  However, it was great on its own.

This was my first recipe I tried on this website and my first time cooking quinoa. I made it last night and  it was so delicious I am making the exact same thing tonight!.. My fiance literally said it was "amazing" and he never says that about my cooking!  I am usually a pretty basic cook  but I feel like a real gourmet chef now!I even told all the girls at work about how good it was and I already had another friend make it tonight..!she loved it too!! thank you for sharing! 5 stars!

I loved this recipe!  This is the third Quinoa recipe I've tried and the best by far.  I didn't have cumin or cilantro, but it was still very tasty.  I will try it with all of the ingredients next time.

This was good. I'd never made it before, but I'll make it again for sure.   I doubled the recipe but not the beans, like someone else mentioned. I didn't use the cumin, but I did add red pepper flakes which gave it a nice spicy kick. I found it too salty with the broth (I used chicken since that's what I had) and adding salt, and I didn't add much either. I think next time I'm going to use 3/4 of the broth and 1/4 water to tone that down. I think that I'm going to add tomatoes next time as well.  My 5 and 7 year old kids like this a lot as well. We served it with broiled cod and salad. Yum.

This is so much better than I expected it to be. My family is trying to eat more whole grains but we can't stomach brown rice. Since trying this recipe, we know there is hope! I only used half an onion (that was all I had) plus a sprinkling of onion flakes. Otherwise I kept to the recipe exactly and it was fantastic! I will definitely make a double batch next time so there will be leftovers!

Very good.  Next time I will follow the other reviewers' suggestions and soak the quinoa before cooking.  20 minutes did not seem like enough time to cook the quinoa through.

I am always looking for new ways to use quinoa.  This is a great recipe.  You could even use this as a main course.  Will definitely make this again.

I can't believe how easy this is to make.  I forgot to add the garlic and it was still fantastic!  This recipe is now a favorite.

Absolutely delicious.  Super quick and easy.  I topped it off with pineapple salsa and sour cream (left off the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand) and was blown away that something so simple tasted so wonderful!

Used this as a filling for stuffed bell peppers.  It was the perfect amount for four medium-sized peppers.  Followed instructions exactly, except only used 1 can of black beans and did not use cilantro.  For the peppers, I cut the tops off, removed the seeds and ribs, and then parboiled in lightly salted water for about 5 minutes.  I then drained them on paper towels while I finished off the quinoa filling.  When the filling was finished, I distributed among the peppers, placed in a baking dish, and popped in a preheated 400-degree oven for 20 minutes.  I then sprinkled each with about a tablespoon of finely shredded parmesan cheese, increased oven temperature to broil, and returned to the oven for just a few minutes to melt and brown the cheese.  They were absolutely delicious.

I use quinoa a lot.  The only thing I would do differently would be to toast the quinoa before adding the broth.  It brings out the natural nutty taste of the grain.  I used shoepeg corn because I just like it better.

Great every time.  I serve it with lemon, avocado, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and warmed corn tortillas.  Try eating them taco style with everything loaded inside the corn tortilla - it's delicious.

De-lish!  This was our first time using Quinoa - so easy.  I didn't follow this recipe because rice & beans is our go-to favorite dinner and I usually just make it from memory with our favorite flavors, but I have no doubt that this one would be great.  The quinoa really takes the flavors od anything you cook it in.  We're quickly making quinoa our total rice replacement!

The quinoa went mushy with this amount of liquid. Without the addition of other ingredients, this would have been pretty flavourless. Won't make again.

Well, I sort of messed this one up a little because I was short a bit of quinoa and adjusted the broth wrong.  And I hate cilantro, so I planned to use parsley... except I forgot to get it.  But.... it's still really good!  It's really so much easier to eat healthy when there are recipes like this.

This was our first time trying quinoa and we loved it. My husband was very impressed with this dish. I made the recipe exactly as written except that I used dried black beans cooked with chicken broth instead of canned beans. This recipe is a very healthy, one-pot vegan meal, but I chose to add a simple quesadilla (made with whole wheat tortillas, monterey jack and cheddar cheeses, and some leftover grilled chicken) and some steamed broccoli to round out the meal. No more Spanish Rice for me: from now on, I'll be making this recipe to complement any Mexican style meal or as a meal in itself. One warning: the cilantro flavor was strong. I love cilantro, but it is a flavor that some people don't care for. If you prefer, you may want to reduce the cilantro. I'm looking forward to trying other ways to cook quinoa, but this recipe will be hard to beat!

This was a very bland dish. After much doctoring and letting it sit a couple days to develop flavor, I'd give this dish a 3 star. I only ate it so I wouldn't have to throw it away. I think I would've liked it better without the sweetness of the corn, as I love beans and rice and similar dishes.

Whenever a customer unfamiliar with quinoa comes into the store, they ask me what it tastes like.  It's hard to describe, but I tell them it goes great with spicy mexican seasonings, just like this recipe!  All the ingredients go so well together.  It's a great way to get protein at lunch since a lot of the time I only eat meat at dinner.  The only changes I made were using only one can of beans and 1/2 cup corn.

I thought this would have more of an equal amount of black beans and quinoa, but it is mostly black beans with quinoa.  I doubled the quinoa and cheyanne to give it a kick and added a few squeezes of lime.  I omitted the oil and used cookings spray.  I also used chicken broth because I prefer the flavor.  Very good side dish for BBQ and mexican dishes.

Hooray!  Absolutely love this recipe and have passed it on time and time again!  We omit the cayenne and add powdered chipotle peppers instead!  I also add a can of drained fire roasted tomatoes and sometimes cooked and shredded chicken breasts.  Thank you for this fab recipe!

soooo good i'd be willing to say it's one of the best dishes i've ever had!  i ate almost half the batch myself as soon as it was done (whoops).  i followed the recipe exactly.  what i might add next time is some fresh diced tomatoes & cubes of fresh avocado just thrown on top just before serving!  i think i'll also cut up chicken and cook it with the garlic/onions...would add just some protein & would taste even more fantastic (might not be possible!)!

I've now taken it to 3 parties and had numerous recipe requests.  I did make a few small changes.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in a small amount of butter, as I think onions in butter are the best.  The biggest change I made was using turkey broth in place of veggie broth.  I save juices from all meat cooked for use in gravies, roux, and other sauces.  Since quinoa particularly marries flavors of what it's cooked in, this change was key in turning it into a stellar dish.  I also used only one can of beans.  I have been using Ancient Harvest brand Inca Red Quinoa because I thought it looked more attractive than the white.  We have served this with both chicken and steak and also used it as a filling in burritos and it is excellent that way too.

This was delicious! Specially because the quinoa is such a blend grain that all these ingredients give it a lot of flavour. But please do not use so much cayenne pepper, use about 1/4 to a 1/2 of what the recipe is asking for. This is too spicy. I ruined my first batch.

LOVE this!  i usually make this with couscous, but had some quinoa on hand.  i added chicken to bump up the protein and a splash of lime juice. I left out the cilantro since i think it tastes like soap.  super dish!

This recipe was so easy, healthy and needed very little else.  I would suggest using only 1 can of beans (two is just way too much) and adding some fresh tomatoes on top.  Also, make sure you rinse your quinoa well before cooking it.  Next time I make it I think I'll grill a little shrimp with lime and summer squash to go with it.

Outstanding!  The flavors were great.  We love cilantro.  My daughter's boyfriend didn't want to try it but had seconds, which he rarely does, and wants the leftovers for his lunch tomorrow!  Healthy and yummy all rolled into one.  I served with sald to start.

Awsome meal.... I added cut up bell peppers yellow, green and red.  I usally chop up what left and freeze in small bags for cooking ease.  I also added some taco seasoning.  I did not have corn so I added jalepeno's seeded and chopped.  It is such a versatile dish that you can't go wrong.  Asparagus chopped would be so great too.  Can't wait to play with this using other types of ingredients.

Well, my young boys didn't eat it (no surprise) but my husband and I and teen daughter thought it was terrific. No bitterness from the quinoa after a brief soak (10 minutes), very easy to make and to personalize with different spices or even add other vegetables. we'll certainly make it again.

Oh wow!  Cooked up about 1/2 a green pepper with the onion, used water instead of broth (just 'cause I didn't have any) and tripled the cumin.  Added about 1 tbsp oregano and smoked paprika and used one can each:  diced tomatoes, whole corn and black beans.  I also soaked the quinoa in water while I was sauteing the onion/garlic/pepper.  Something I definitely will make again!

Really good.  I toasted the quinoa first in a dry pan 'til light brown and fragrant. Then you rinse and drain it before adding to this recipe.

This was so good, the instructions were also excellent. Followed exactly except for reducing the spices a bit as we like it on the mild side. I don't even care for black beans but in this dish it was very good. I definitely recommend this!

Everyone was silent at the dinner table when I served it, and that's a bad sign at my house.  (Nobody wanted to hurt my feelings.)  I won't be making it again.

This is a great recipe, and very adaptable.  I often substitute different beans and a different spice combo- Indian is absolutely delicious and makes this a tasty and healthy fusion dish.  Thanks for the basic recipe- until I found this, my quinoa was pretty blah.

I absolutely LOVED this dish.  This was my first experience with quinoa and I am very impressed.  I added a can of rinsed tomatoes, a whole orange pepper, and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  I will be making this again for sure.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  (I did not rinse or soak the quinoa before cooking and it was just the right texture.)

I make this all the time.  It is the best quinoa (keen-wah) dish out there.  I have made it as the recipe calls and it is great.  I have made it tons of other ways and it's still great. I just add what veggies I have on hand.  My favorite way is to add chopped bell pepper with the onions and top with fresh chopped tomatoes, sour cream and shredded cheese. Salsa also gives it a kick even if you don't have cilantro on hand.  I DO Not soak the quinoa.  My husband likes this rolled into a tortilla for burritos(you could mash part of your black beans before adding them to make it thicker for wrapping up).  If you have time to toast the qunioa (until it starts to pop) in a dry skillet, it adds to the flavor.  Don't forget that quinoa is a complete protien and the beans and corn mix to make a complete protien for non-meat eaters.  This makes a great main meal as well as side dish.

Delicious!  I took the advice of other people and used only 1 can of black beans, chicken instead of veggie stock, and added a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I didn't think I could pull it off, but it came out tasting great!  THANK YOU for the recipe!!

This recipe is delicious! I've cooked with quinoa for many years and have never heard of soaking it prior to cooking - ignore that advice from previous reviewers.  I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and juice from half a lemon. Thanks for the recipe, Hilary!

Excellent recipe!  My husband who doesn't like quinoa as a side dish loves this.  I added 1/2 c bell pepper sauteed w/ onion and garlic, 14 oz can diced tomatoes w/ green chilis in place of 1 can of beans, and also added 2 chipotle peppers (about 1 Tblsp) in adobo sauce (from a can).  Lots of flavor!  Served as entree w/ salad and bread.  Thanks for the Yummy recipe!

This recipe is a favourite at our house, but I substitute a can of diced tomatoes for one of the cans of black beans, and I use Italian parsley instead of cilantro (hate cilantro).  The kids like it the way it is, I usually add hot sauce to mine.

This was originally published in my local paper, calling for only one can of beans so that's how I've made it.  It's delicious.  We usually have it as a main dish with some raw veggies (cucumber, bell pepper strips) to round it out.

Two cans of beans would be way too much.  Also, I've wanted to mix it up with a can of diced tomatoes but haven't yet.

This is really good.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I felt it was missing a little something.  I think it would be perfect (5 stars) with the addition of diced tomatoes.  I made the recipe as near as possible to the original, except that I used 1 cup quinoa and 2 cups chicken broth (they were out of veg. broth at the store).  I did use both cans of beans and it tasted great, not overpowering.  Even better the next day with tortilla chips.  Love the combination of spices.  Nice balance.

EXCELLENT!  Followed this recipe as written (minus cayenne, add paprika).  Also only used dried ingredients I had on-hand for everything except the onion.  Used dried beans that I'd made fresh today.  This will be a staple in my rotation.  I can already tell this will be amazing the next day!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was wonderful, thank you.  I found a box of "Red Quinoa" at my health food store, and it was a vibrant shade of cranberry, so I wanted a color dish to make.  The cranberry colored quinoa, with black beans and yellow corn, heavily spiced with cumin and garlic, was excellent.  I didn't find it needed two cans of beans -- I used one regular can of beans, and one regular can of corn. I used chicken broth instead of the veggie broth, but had I stuck to veggie, it would have been a good Vegan meal.   That said, I found it so delicious and attractive, that the next night, I reheated it and mounded it on a plate, and topped it with a skewer of grilled prawns with a side of sliced limes.   Finger licking good. Thanks again.

This is fabulous!  You must rinse Quinoa very well before cooking it or it will taste awful.  Just wanted to warn those who have not cooked with it before.  I topped with sliced grilled chicken, shredded lettuce, cheese, and sour cream on the side.  It was a big hit and very flavorful. A very healthy dish (if you go light on the dairy)and great for those who are gluten intolerant.

Wonderful!  This was my first crack at quinoa and I'm hooked.  I made the recipe as stated then chilled it a bit before adding a little chopped avocado.  Just....WOW!  I will have lots of leftovers to enjoy over the next few days..........

Absolutely delicious!  I used Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn which, at the risk of sounding like a commercial, is the greatest, adding a much more interesting flavor than regular frozen corn. If you haven't tried quinoa, now is the time and THIS is the recipe.

We can't stop eating this!  At first we tried it as a main dish, but now we prefer to eat it as a base for burritos, adding avocado, scotch bonnet pepper sauce, diced tomatoes, and cheese all wrapped up in a tortilla.  Super fantasic!

I think this is the recipe that got me hooked on both allrecipes *and* quinoa.  Very delicious and nutritious.  I, following the lead of many of the other reviewers, use only one can of black beans, and I normally use chicken broth since that's the staple at home.  Last time I made this, I also added some chopped scallion to the onion and garlic, and it seemed to make the dish particularly flavorful.  Also nice with some Sriracha on top!

With 2 vegetarians in the family I'm always looking for something new and quick to fix. We all loved this! I made it exactly by the directions. The only thing I might change is to use less cilantro since some family members are not resl fond of it.

Excellent and so healthy. I vary the proportions slightly and only use one can of beans, also increase the spices and add some chili powder.  Good with some canned tomatoes added, topped with salsa and sour cream, or just as is.  A good way to get to know quinoa.

What a crowd pleaser! Simple and quick to make. I just made as stated (we like more garlic and used canned corn). Served with tortillas w/sour cream, black olives, jalapeño peppers, grated cheese, hot sauce, et al for garnish. The 20 minute cooking time was right on but I would check @ 15 min to make adjustments if needed. Can't wait to make again & try some of the suggestions from the other reviewers!!

This is a permanent addition to my menu.  I use just one can of beans and omit the cilantro but the Southwest flavor still shines.  I've used it as taco filling, it makes delicious burritoes, and is a great dip for the new guacamole Doritoes.  It keeps for days and just gets better for sitting in the fridge.  Thank you for such a wonderful and versatile recipe!

I love this recipe. It’s on my regular rotation. It’s easy, healthy, nice to look at AND takes good. What more could I ask for? I make this as  written and sometimes I change it up a bit. I was told I needed more protein in my meal. So sometimes I add 1lb. chicken breast or you could use rotisserie chicken. I also add  1/2 red bell  pepper and  some broccoli at the end so it doesn’t over cook. I increase all the spices by 1/4 or so. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

My husband was diagnosed with Celiac disease not long ago. We thought this was delicious the first day but, the second day, my husband asked me to top it with cheddar cheese and raw onions, chili style. He said, that dish is great plain but, when you top it with cheese, you don't know it's healthy and, it tastes even better!

This was so easy and it tastes sooo good!
I followed the recipe as is except reducing to one can of black beans and omitting the cilantro (because I hate cilantro). 
As it was my first time making quinoa I didn't realize how small quinoa is when straining and lost a little. Next time I'll have a finer strainer ready. 
This is going to be a great base recipe for tweaking to your own taste. We added crumbled feta cheese to it afterwards and it was very complimentary.

I used chicken broth because that's what I had on hand.  I also added a small can (4oz) of mild chilles for some extra Mexican flavor.  I only used 1 can of beans and that seemed like a good amount.  I also increased the called for amount of spices and garlic because we like it spicy!  It was very good, we all loved it.  I also had salsa on the table and it was good with a little of that on top too!

This is wonderful!  I used red quinoa as it was all I had on hand and used only one can of black beans and I added 1/4 Tsp of ancho chile powder and it was so good!  Once it was all mixed up and the ingredients had a chance to get happy I then threw in some chopped jalapeno and some red pepper and now it is even better!  This would make a very good filling for burritos or tacos too.  I'm considering trying to do a batch of nachos using this.

This was AMAZING!! This is the second time I made it and this time I added only one can of beans and was much happier with it. I added bell pepper with the onions and garlic and served it with grilled chicken and roasted vegetables. It is perfect hot or cold, keeps very well and super easy to make. My husband doesn't usually like "healthy" foods but he liked this so this is definitely a must do, easy and healthy. One modification is soaking the quinoa for about 10-15 minutes whilst preparing anything else and it makes it very soft. Enjoy!!

This is yummy, light, and refreshing. Just what I need for a healthier lifestyle and to help me on my fitness journey. To make it more substantial, I had added Chipotle lime chicken pieces for lunch. This time making it without chicken, I juiced less than half a lime to the broth (I used chicken broth) for it gives the salad a nice tang to the spices and sweetness of the corn. I have made this recipe twice so far for my weekly lunch meals.

This is delicious! I made a few small changes. I used 1/2 can of beans (instead of 2 cans) and I served it with fresh avocado cubes. The avocado really lightened the dish. This recipe is great in a soft tortilla with grilled chicken strips!

Followed the recipe except for I only used one can of beans as others have suggested. Next time will add tomatoes to the dish. This would be a great side dish served with a Mexican meal instead of a Mexican rice. Both my husband and daughter thought this was a great tasting recipe. We all liked the "Best Greek Quinoa Salad" recipe on this site better, but both recipes have a unique taste to them depending upon what you are serving as the main course.

This recipe was a great start. I had quinoa on hand all cooked up, added black beans, the corn and spices but then added some sour cream, cream and pepper jack cheese. I mixed it all up and popped it in the microwave to heat through. Delicious!

I've been looking for tasty ways to include quinoa in my diet and this recipe did not disappoint . The cayenne may add a little too much heat for some, but I enjoyed it. I may try adding shrimp or chicken next time.

Delicious!  My kids loved it.  We did not change anything other than soaking the quinoa and using black beans that I cooked myself so I had to add a little bit more salt.

Amazing flavors in his dish! It is my go to dish when I am home and want to make the houses smell amazing while I cook. I also use one can of black beans and have added peppers and also a dollop  of sour cream to make it even more delicious.

It was so easy to make! I absolutely love it; and it was just so versatile- I added roasted chopped Brussel sprouts and mushrooms! I am so pleased with this recipe! My only question would be how to add a kick of spice to it?

I admit it. I struggle with Quinoa. It always seems so bland. But I love black beans, and I love corn so I tried it just now. 

I found this to be a very yummy combo and an easy dish. I will definitely make this again and again. How many things are delicious AND good for you?

Don't bother to answer...I will be in the kitchen dishing up another helping.

DELICIOUS either hot or cold.  Changes I made: 1 tsp. olive oil instead of veg. oil.  I substituted 1 c. bulgur grain which I poured 1c. boiling water over & let sit until water was absorbed. I used 1 1/2c. chicken broth in place of veg. broth and also added 1 chopped red pepper for color.  One can of black bean was plenty.  I did not have cilantro so I used fresh parsley. When served warm, I put shredded cheese over top and put in microwave to melt the cheese.

This is really, really good! I substituted fresh parsley for the cilantro and olive oil for the vegetable oil. Also, only 1 can of beans is needed – 2 would overpower the whole dish.  Easy to make, healthy and filling!

I think this is tasty!  I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and omit the cayenne (too spicy for baby) and cilantro (only b/c I don't have on hand).  I've made this many times- go to recipe for quinoa!

This has made it into the rotation. We always follow the recipe exactly and it's so good and filling. I've read other reviews and think I'll experiment with adding more veggies next time, just for added nutritional value, and color. It's hard to find such easy, and delicious dishes that are gluten-free, dairy-free, and sugar-free.  This dish is a definite winner!

This is a great recipe. Full of flavor.   The first time we made it alongside a crockpot pork recipe from this site and it was the perfect combo. Now we make the extras into burritos with a little cheese added add pop them into the oven for a fast weeknight spin on the leftovers (since just two of us).  I have also made the burritos up and froze them 4 to a freezer bag so they can be put in the oven frozen too.

Excellent.  I've been looking for a vegan recipe to take for Thanksgiving dinner so I'd have protein and that the rest of the family will like.  I did a test run this evening.  Thought I had black beans but was out so I used red beans.  Still great.

Love it!!  We used olive oil and skipped the corn the first time. We added one poblano pepper to onion/garlic mixture.  Added spices included garlic and onion powder and a dash of hot sauce.  We added one drained can of diced tomatoes to beans.  This is so versatile.  Will make again!!

Perfect!  I didn't have enough quinoa so I used half red quinoa and half couscous.  It was absolutely delicious! I made it with the Allrecipes recipe for Salsa Chicken.  I all used the Taco Seasoning Recipe from Allrecipes instead of the taco mix in the Salsa Chicken.  Served with tortilla chips on the side, this was a perfect meal!

I like to make a dish exactly according to the recipe, before deciding what changes I would make. In this case I wouldn't change a thing! The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because my son didn't like it - but the other three of us did! I didn't find 2 cans of black beans too much, rather it makes for a good, filling main dish. I was a bit nervous about the spices, since I don't have much experience using them, but stuck to the recipe and found it leaving a pleasant warmth in my mouth rather than gagging for a glass of water.

This recipe is perfect for my taste. It definitely has more heat then I was expecting but I enjoy that. This is a great alternative to rice. The quinoa came out perfect. I ate this as a main dish and it was just as satisfying as having a dinner with meat and more fat. I'm definently adding this to my regular menu cycle.

This was my first time making quinoa and it was amazing! I used one can of black beans instead of two. I also followed another reviewer's advice and added the garlic towards the end of the onions cooking and toasted the quinoa with the onions before adding the spices and liquid. I still can't get over how amazing this was!

Liked the Quinoa and Black Beans however it needs to be spiced up a bit.  I used chicken broth instead of the vegetable and added greek black olives and crushed red peppers.  Yum!!!!

I made this last night to accompany tacos instead of the usually rice dish. I did add one can of beans as others have posted. That was plenty I think. I did also add about a half can of Rotel tomatoes. I think this recipe would make a great suffed pepper. This was a GREAT side dish but would serve as a meatless main dish too!

My family and I loved this recipe.  I made it twice the first time I made it, having a tasting party with friends.  I used chicken broth and one can of beans and felt that was an adequate amount.  I am encouraging others to fix this marvelous recipe.  Clara Schrader

LOVE LOVE LOVE. I omitted the corn, but added diced ginger root, celery, mini bell peppers and mushrooms, sautéed it with the onion and garlic. I didn't have cilantro, so put in parsley. And added a touch of chili powder after I removed it from the flame. Totally awesome.

This is a good basic recipe but needs to be upped a level. Since the ingredients have a Mexican profile, I added lime juice, crushed red pepper ( fresh jalapeño would be good too), and cumin.

It's not a main dish in my mind. Probably a good side or burrito filler, as others have mentioned. I would also halve the beans next time.

I added 2 cups frozen chopped kale (at the same time as the corn) instead of the cilantro and it was awesome, plus more nutritionally dense.

Turned out a lot better than I anticipated. The seasonings make this a great side dish. I simmered this on low heat for almost 20 minutes. I made this using only one can of black beans, rinsed, which was more than enough. It went great with a Mexican themed party!

We love making this recipe! It was my first time making quinoa and the first time didn't work out for me. I wasn't watching the quinoa and it burned to the bottom, I only had to cook it for about 15 minutes before it was good. After making it a few times, I have doubled the cayenne pepper to make it a little hotter and now we have it weekly! It is wonderful to make ahead of time and keep in the fridge. It microwaves great! I like 2 cans of black beans, it didn't seem like too much for me.

This recipe is great and very versatile. I have made this about 3 times and each time I did a little something different. One time I put it in tortillas with chicken and sliced avocados and it was really good. Last time I put it in some light flat wraps to make it a little healthier and also added chicken, sour cream and salsa. Like other reviewers, I like to just use 1 can of black beans. I also use low sodium chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. All of my friends who have tried this have liked it. It's super easy to make and I feel good about eating it since it's so healthy.

Wonderful! Great recipe for trying quinoa. My family loved it. I used chicken broth as I didn't have vegetable. Served over spinach leaves and added halved grape tomatoes and feta.  Yum. My husband asked if I would cook it again tomorrow night. This is a winner.

Absolutely my favorite quinoa dish...DELICIOUS.  I followed recipe except only did one can of black beans.  I think two cans would have been way too much.  This dish had tons of flavor.  We had left overs and it was even good cold.  If you think you don't like quinoa I urge you to try this.

My husband really liked this but I gave it 4 stars because it was a little bland and he doctored it up with some extra spices. Also, I added a can of diced tomatoes and cut the broth back to 1 1/4 cup. I also added some shrimp to make it feel more like a meal and not just a side dish. I will probably make it again.

This was my first WARM quinoa recipe.  Very good.  My boyfriend gobbled it all up.  It definitely only works as a side.  If it had had a little more depth of flavour, I would have given it 5 stars.  Still very good.  And so easy!

Mmmmm mm! This one surprised me... totally delicious! I ate it as a side dish with steamed salmon, but it could have stood alone as its own dish. I changed a couple of small things out of what I had on hand... I didn't use frozen corn (didn't have any) and added a can of rotel... the entire two cans of black beans was a TOUCH too much for me, so I added a can and a half. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because that's what I had in the pantry. OH and I used two shallots instead of one onion. I absolutely loved it and plan on making it frequently when I need a quick healthy meal. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe over and over again exactly as written and it is always a hit.  I've made it with and without cilantro depending on whether or not I've had it on hand.   Great quick and easy recipe!

This recipe is sooo good and healthy! I have made this several times and my entire family loves it. I also added a red pepper with the garlic and onion and used chicken broth instead of vegetable. The 1st time I made this I accidently added double the quinoa and I have made that way every time and it's always perfect. Some of the reviews said the quinoa was a bit mushy, mine has never been, maybe because I use 1 1/2 cups quinoa instead of 3/4 cup.All the other ingredients I use just as the recipe says and it's wonderful!

Made recipe as stated with no substitutions (well no cilantro). Big hit with the family and very filling as a main dish or as a side. So good making another batch tonight. Will be in our meal rotation.

I LOVE this recipe and will eat it hot or cold.  I have had it with and without the cilantro but if you are going to have leftovers, leave out the cilantro and just add a bit right before you eat it, adds that bit of fresh to leftovers.

This was so easy to make and it was excellent. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: water instead of veg broth, added some cilantro salsa because I didn't have cilantro but wanted to add the flavor, and added a little bit of frozen kale with the frozen corn. As per another reviewer we put it into a tortilla with chopped avocado - delicious!

I've been making this for years, but forgot to review it.  We all love it. It's a staple in our house.  Sometimes we eat it as is, other times we serve it as a filling for tacos with corn tortillas, sliced avocado, salsa, and sour cream.  Delicious!

Made this dish today and was very pleasantly pleased with the end result!  Paired it with the Mexican pot roast that I made for shredded beef tacos and burritos. The whole family liked it...coming from the kids that is a compliment as they were introduced to quinoa before and did not like it all!!! Some of us chose to eat it as is; some had in in their beef buritos; some topped it with homemade salsa and avocados. It was yummy either way and I am sure there will be many other ways to serve this dish in the future! I followed the recipe with the excepion of using only one can of black beans  (two would  be overkill in my opionion).  We liked the flavor overall but next time I will add a teaspoon of homemade taco seasoning and a little less cayenne to broaden the flavors a little more. Maybe even try adding some peppers for color and some salsa or tomatoes in the cooking process for an added level of flavor.  An easy recipe to add some variety to it!

First Quinoa recipe and my family loved it! I made a few changes:
1)Used Olive Oil
2)Added 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
3)Added 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
4)Added 1/4 teaspoon red pepper seed
5)Cooked all spices/herbs with the onions & garlic
5)Used 1 1/4 cup chicken stock
6)Used 1/2 teaspoon salt
7)Used 1 teaspoon white pepper
8)Only used 1 can of well rinsed & drained black beans
9)Used 2 Tablespoons dried cilantro - I had used all of my fresh:(
I cooked it an additional 5 minutes before adding the corn. I served it with homemade turkey burgers for a nice healthy dinner!

This was delicious!!!  We had it for dinner last Friday and I'm making it again tonight!  I may be bringing this to a pot luck get together during the week too!  Wow!  So many excamation points!  Two cans of beans was perfect (my kids LOVE them!) and it was great with the suggested lemon juice and diced tomatoes! Will make this again and again!

I thought this was excellent with 2 cans of beans, I don't really understand what people are saying about it being over-kill. I felt the amount of quinoa and beans were balanced very nicely. I would say to buy 2 cans and if you find it's enough, save the next can for next time, but you don't want to be disappointed with it being under-beaned. If I could make any suggestions, it's fantastic with avocado and chopped red bell pepper. 10 oz of this stuff was only 200 calories, it's extraordinarily low-cal and it's delicious.

Just great!  Soak the quinoa first, then drain it, to get rid of the saponin which can make it bitter. For even more nutrition, one could sprout the quinoa first.

Wow! A 10 not a five. Amazing flavor packed in so few ingredients. Skip the rice & beans - eat this:) I lacked onion and cilantro so was forced to use onion powder and a squeeze of lime. Can't wait to try it with the listed fresh ingredients. Thanks 3LIONCUBS. The photo and video rocks! Oh, I also added the cumin near the end of sauteing the garlic. It enhances the cumin flavor (as does frozen sweet white corn). For vegans out there I made the broth with nutritional yeast.

This is s.e.r.i.o.u.s.l.y. amazing! I tried it after reading many of the glowing reviews (of which I was highly skeptical). But it is very easy to prepare and the results are incredible. Please try this, you won't be sorry. Don't leave out a thing! I almost left out the corn, thinking it wouldn't be missed. Instead I ran to the store and grabbed a bag of frozen kernels. The corn imparts a delicate sweetness and a little pop when you bite into it. I love to eat this dish with a heaping dollop of plain greek style yogurt, green onions, cilantro and bit of finely minced hot pepper (a red one is especially pretty) Thank you thank you thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe.

Love, love, love this - thank you!!!   I have varied it a bit - no corn (not a lot of nutritional value) and have added green peppers, brocoli and zucchini - my family loves when I make a batch of this - we mostly eat it in a tortilla but  it is just so versatile, healthy, low in calories, and easy to make!

Quick and delicious. The one thing I did differently is to fry the spices in with the oil, onion, and garlic for about 10 seconds right before you add the quinoa and broth - it heightens the spices' flavors.

My husband has been wanting to eat more vegetarian because of high cholesterol. He's a real meat & potatoes kind of guy, but we really, really liked this recipe! I used chicken brother instead of vegetable and cilantro oil only because we didn't have any cilantro and it was just so tasty we decided this will be one of our "regular" recipes. Also, super easy to make!

This is a great recipe; the only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of vegetable and add some chicken to make a main meal.  We enjoy black beans so used the entire amount; didn't find them overwhelming at all.  Next time I will follow another reviewer's advice and saute the quinoa slightly before adding the broth and spices.  And once the quinoa is almost done will add the remaining ingredients so that the quinoa doesn't overcook.  Thanks, 3LIONCUBS, for a great dish.

I am not a big reviewer, as I don't think I am educated enough to be one.  BUT, this dish is wonderful.  I took one suggestion and added a can of tomatoes with green chilis-oh my goodness!  This is a keeper.  My husband, who could care less about nutrition, asks when I am making it again.  Well done!

I really liked this!  I doubled the recipe but added 3 cans of beans instead of the suggested 4 and it seemed like a good amount, though I'm sure more would have been fine, too.  I added some tomatoes and lemon juice per other reviewers but neither seemed to add any noticeable flavor.  This was a great, easy, quick, healthy recipe.  I really liked it!  Also, I forgot to rinse the quinoa first and it still came out great.

This is my new favorite dish!! With a few tweaks...with all the disgusting things about meat in the news right now, I was looking for a vegetarian dish I could turn to a couple times a week..this is it..

First, I eat like a child in that I don't care for chunks of veggies...so, I blended up a can of rotel adding enough water to make 1 1/2 cups. I added that to my rinsed quinoa along with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, cumin, chili powder, and a few sprinkles of chipotle tobasco pepper sauce...I brought it to a boil, turned the heat down and simmered 25 minutes..then I added a drained can of mexicorn and drained/rinsed black beans...I topped it with a little cheese and sour cream...perfection!!!

We ate this over spring mix salad for a vegetarian dinner.  My husband commented that it would taste great as a burrito filling along with some shredded chicken.   The cayenne was masked by the sweetness of the corn, so next time I will up it to 1/2 tsp.

It was delicious!!! Now I understand what other people meant when they said it seems like a good recipe but it's really awesome... This was my second time using quinoa and I'm in love. I added some diced red peppers and used only one can of beans because its all I had...

I am a college student and I love it! I would put only one can of black beans, though. Maybe one cup more of corn would be nice. This dish is delicious even without any beans. In that case, I wouldn't add any salt. 

This recipe has good potential to be something else that is also tasty. I was tempted to put some tomatoes but I didn't. It probably would be also tasty.
My roommate walked in when I was cooking this dish and she totally loved how delicious it smelled. I am eating it right now and it is so yummy!

LOVED this!  I didn't have cayenne pepper so I use chili powder and smoked paprika.  I also added a little chipotle in adobo sauce.  Yum!!!  My 13 month old loved it too :)  This will be made again and again in this household.

Served as a "taco" salad with sauteed peppers and onions on top of lettuce with sour cream. YUM!

YUMMY!  I have been looking for more vegetarian recipes (especially with quinoa) and this is by far the best! I top with plain greek yogurt and add jalapenos and a little hot sauce (I like it spicy).  Kids enjoyed it as well (sans spicy).  Will definately make again and again!

Delicious!  Added a little chicken to make it a main course and used chili powder instead of cayenne since we don't like super spicy.  My 2 year old ate so much!  Great as a leftover in a tortilla with cheese.

I took the advice of others and soaked the quinoa for about an hour prior to making. I loved it; hot or cold was great. So many dishes like this are bland and this is not. I didn't add the cayenne but other than that, I made it exactly as the recipe said and will make again.

Prepared recipe as written, but scaled down to 2 servings...required additional broth (used regular vegetable broth because didn't have the low-sodium variety). Broth amount per recipe evaporated and the quinoa mixture nearly burned before I caught and added enough additional broth to have a moist mixture. Also, added 1/2 seeded and de-veined habanero pepper. With these revisions, the recipe was really good with just the right amount of heat for my taste.

AWESOME!  Added Field Roast Mexican Chipotle vegetarian sausages crumbled and browned and used as a filling for tacos. Was a huge breakthrough for my omnivore husband who usually turns up his nose at my vegetarian dishes.

I make this with coconut oil, red quinoa and curry powder replacing cumin. It is one of my husband's favorites and he is a committed meat eater. He even asks me to make it :-).

Awesome recipe. The only thing I did differently is cook the quinoa in a rice cooker with the spices and veg. broth. Sauteed the onions and garlic then mixed it all together.

Delicious and nutritous (and extremely easy to make).  Do not fear the quinoa!  It's as quick and easy to cook as rice.  This dish has wonderful texture and flavor.  I served it with green beans and berry pie for dessert - extremely satisfying.

I added 2 small fresh chopped tomatoes and 1/2 of a zucchini, chopped, at the same time I put in the corn.  I omitted the cayenne pepper and only used one can of beans.  This dish was the meal, no side dishes necessary!  It was FABULOUS!!!

Very good and easy to make! We'd never had Quinoa before and this was a great way to make it. Very flavorful. It makes a lot so be prepared for leftovers or perfect for serving a large group.

Absolutely delicious.  This makes a great lunch, full of protein!  It also freezes and heats up well.  My fiance cooks and entire batch, freezes half of it, and then eats it for lunch for the next couple of weeks.  He loves it!

WOW!  Another quinoa virgin bites the dust (am I allowed to say that on AR?  Hope so).  First time trying and I'm in love.  What a great recipe!   Simple, full of flavor - just wonderful.  Made exactly as directed with the exeption of rinsing quinoa first, substituting chicken broth,  and omitting cilantro (didn't have).  A new favorite.

Love this recipe, but had to make several change because of food intolerences. No onion, garlic or corn; replaced them with chopped sunchokes (onion like texture) and broccoli. Quinoa is a staple in our gluten free, dairy free household - very filling and microwaves well the next day for lunch.

Very good.  My daughter thought it looked strange, but it tasted great.  I added rotel tomatoes and used chicken broth plus only 1 can beans and 1 cup cooked ground chicken.  Served with shredded sharp cheddar and sour cream at the table.  I have a nice rice cooker that I sauted and cooked it in, so it was very quick and easy.

This is one of our favorite recipes since we switched to a plant-based diet. I made it exactly as printed here, but it is the type of recipe you can adapt to your taste easily & use what you have on hand. Easy & nutritional!

I'm currently eating this while staring at a blizzard and study notes.  It's perfect!

Like most people, I only used one can of black beans.  I also threw in a can of fire roasted tomatoes (drained) when the onion and garlic were almost done, as well as added a dash of cinnamon.  I omitted the salt since the tomatoes contained enough for me.  Can't wait to take this with me for my lunch tomorrow!

Something's missing; it's kind of bland and pretty dry.  Gets better with time in the refrigerator, though, so if there's a next time, make it at least one day in advance.

My ten year old gave it a 10 as well as myself!!!  My husband not a healthy eater gave it a 5 or 6.  After reading some reviews I changed broth to 1 1/4 and added 1/4 lemon juice.  Gave it a salsa twang. Also, added red and yellow pepper with onion and garlic.  As well as a 1 tsp chili powder.  NO CORN & CAYENNE PEPPER!!!  WILL BE MAKING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN! ! !

I used chicken broth and stirred in a diced fresh tomato at the end with the cilantro.  Couldn't ask for better flavor and a more satisfying dish.  I like just having it in the frig this week to eat for a quick lunch, as a side-dish with dinner, or as a complete meal when the family is not home.  Thanks!

This is really, really good and so healthy.  I sauteed a yellow bell pepper with the onions and I used red quinoa because that is what I had.  I replaced a can of black beans with a can of red kidney beans.  Oh and I used parsley instead of cilantro because I don't like cilantro.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and the dish came out awesome.

Quick, healthy, easy to prepare, uses ingredients I usually have on hand, works well with substitutions if I don't have an ingredient and SO TASTY! I'm usually not a cumin/cayenne girl, but this is amazing!

Delicious!  Here are my additions and alterations: once quinoa was cooked I added half a can of both corn and black beans.  I then added a can of drained rotel, green onion and lots of lime juice.  Served with Cilantro Lime grilled Chicken and sliced avocado.  Will definitely make again!

This was so simple and delicious.  I followed the directions as they were, substituting red quinoa, and it turned out great.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It's healthy and filling, and you get a pretty large serving for relatively few calories.  This would be great for someone trying to stick to a New Year's resolution ;0)

This was my first time cooking quinoa. It's really easy and the blend of spices is perfect. The cilantro really keeps the cumin from overpowering the dish.

Superb! The only thing that I will do differently next time I make it this dish is not to use quite so much cayenne pepper. Outstanding dish!

This was GREAT!! Very tasty and healthy. And so easy to make.  The first time I made it was for a New Years Eve get together my husband and I were hosting at our house. It served as one of the main dishes.   The second time I made it and took it to a friend's house for dinner.  This time I served it as an appetizer, with Tostito's Multi Grain scoops.  It was a HUGE success both times.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This is a TOTAL score!! I was AMAZED! My kids gobbled it up. I made some substitions -  black quinoa, chicken broth and edaname instead of the black beans. I put in a can of drained tomotoes (with green chili's).  I have this wonderful grapeseed oil that is chipolte flavored so I used that instead of the vege oil and omitted the cayenne.  I didn't have cilantro..  Anyway, my daughter asked if it will be good cold so she can take it in her lunch tomorrow!!  Weight Watchers points - 7 points for a cup (and it is filling!).

I believe the nutritional information is incorrect, specifically the calories.  When I calculate the calories I end up with around 340 calories.  This recipe was good, but not great, when made as written.

Seriously Yum. 

I added I little barley before the quinoa it gave the dish a touch of just right chewiness.  Cooked in a Dutch oven. I added a few extra spices here and there. It is fantastic. I added two bags of frozen southern style veggies and made my first intentionally vegan main course dish. Okra is awesome with this awesome little recipe. two thumbs way up!!

Perfect for lunch leftovers too.

Amazing, healthy, and filling. Like another person suggested, I like to add in a chopped red bell pepper for more color and nutrition. Other than that this recipe is perfect!

We added green onions, tomatoes & avocado.  It gets more delicious after a few days! We like it cold, like a salad.  Didn't add as much cayenne as it said to, but think I will next time because it needed a little punch.

Yum! Great vegetarian alternative to beans and rice. It was great as is, however, I added some smoky salsa and Chipotle Tabasco as well. Oh and some red bell pepper. Fantastic!

This was my first attempt with quinoa and it turned out great! It was spicy without being overpowering. I made it as the main (and only) dish this time- which would be fine for me but next time I will make it as a side.

This was my first time ever making quinoa so I was a bit leary plus my husband had had it in the past and hated the texture of it but I decided to try this recipe anyway and we both loved it! It's a great recipe for newbies to quinoa. I did have to cook mine a bit longer til it was transculent and did add a bit of water to get it there (could be because of my altititude) I also left out the cilantro cuz I didn't have any on hand and didn't feel like I was missing it and I only used 1 can of black beans and 3/4 c of corn. I think the full amounts would've been overkill. I also used extra virgin olive oil vs vegetable oil. Definitely will make this a regular side dish in my menus plus the health benefits of quinoa are an added bonus!

Delish!  And easy to customize.  Like me: I didn't use corn and added bell pepper instead.  Threw it in when I added the quinuoa.  I added broccoli when the recipe says to add corn.  I also slipped in some avocado when it was all done which really made it awesome.  I have tons leftover (just made for a dinner for two) and so am excited about future meals.

Awesome recipe! It was my first time making this and I loved it. We ate it as a main course and it was great as leftovers. 
I agree with many of the reviewers, only one can of beans is needed. I also used chicken broth instead of veggie broth and then added in a red bell pepper and sprinkled it with just a touch of cheddar cheese at the end. Loved it!

Great idea and twist on a new recipe but the cumini (which I normally love) was quite overpowering and intense. Minimize next time.

A great recipe that can be served up either cold or hot.  I doubled the recipe, adding 2 cans garbanzo beans, 2 cans black beans, 1 red pepper (diced), 2 bags frozen white sweet corn, juice of fresh limes, olive oil, etc.  I first cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth for the liquid, let it cool, then combined it with the other ingredients.  I mixed the olive oil, spices and lime juice together and tossed with the quinoa and veggies.  Very quick, healthy, and tasty!  I plan on making this regularly because it is so healthy.

This was great. I did not add cilantro as I don't care for it. Used pinto beans as I didn't have black beans. Added diced raw onion to give it some crunch and also added jalapenos.

This was sooooo good. I'd been looking for a recipe to try quinoa and this was the only one that really sounded appealling. I cut the recipe in half and used it as a side dish. I added some chopped grape tomatoes with the black beans and added a squeeze of lime. We will definitely be making this again.

5 stars because you can make this as is or add in just about anything you feel like and it's still great.  The first time I made this my 10 year old was about six bites into it when she said "can we have the left overs tomorrow night?" ... She never says that.

Very good! I reduced the cayenne, because we're wimps, and used frozen cilantro cubes, because it's what I had on hand. I also added about 2T of chopped nopalitos (cactus). We really liked this and I will definitely make again!

My sister-in-law made this for us and it was amazing.  She added shredded chicken and it was one of the most delicious dinners I have ever had.  The next morning we scrambled some eggs and added it to the leftovers and it was again wonderful!  This will definitely be a recipe we make again.

We are not vegetarians, so when we invited guests who were and also were gluten-free, I was a little panicked about what I would make.  This dish fit the bill perfectly!  This is a wonderful dish, and we will serve it as a side with chicken or pork as well as a vegetarian option.  I made it just as the recipie calls for, that the spices were perfect.  Thank you!

The seasoning is just right.  First time eating quinoa...have always been hesitant to cook it but tasted this at a potluck.  I made it tonight for dinner and husband liked it too.  Only put one can of beans though and will add red pepper next time like someone suggested just for color and nutrition.  So easy to make. Great recipe

My husband, father and brother gobbled this up! I would have given it five stars but it turned out a little too salty for my taste. Next time, I will add half as much salt and then add to taste at the end.

I read what others posted and soaked the quinoa for about 15 minutes and it was a bit mushy.  I followed the recipe, using olive oil instead of veg. oil) but found it a little bland. I put it in a whole wheat pita, added some fresh cut tomatoes and some shredded mexican cheese blend and that added a lot of flavor and made it pretty good.

Very easy to make!  Didn't have cumin and ended up substituting extra dash more of cayanne and chili powder, turned out well.  Went along very well with the "Grilled Tilapia with Mango Salsa" recipe.

Amazing! I left out the corn and used a red bell pepper instead. I also skipped the cilantro and added more cayenne. When it was done, I topped it with avocado, lime juice, and cheddar daiya cheese. Would make a great taco filling!

Fabulous! My husband wasn't too sure about eating quinoa for the first time. After trying this recipe, he said "you could make this for the guys"! I added a few fresh tomatoes during the last few minutes of cooking (they needed to be used).

Love this recipe!  I brought it to a potluck at work and everyone loved it, even though most had no idea what quinoa was.  I added some sriracha (hot sauce) while it was simmering and it gave it a nice little kick when it was done.  Will make this again and again!

This was yummy! Full of protein.  It could definitely be a main course, add a veggie.  I will double recipe from now on.  It was more like 2 1/2 servings in our family.  One gigantic one for my husband = no leftovers.  Leftovers would be really good too.  I made it with salsa chicken and was delish.  If I was making it as main course I would want just a little more flavor (add more seasonings except for cumin, it was enough for me).  Great, fast, easy dish!

Thank you for sharing such a versatile recipe. Ready for anyone's preferences. I added 1 shredded zucchini, a drained can of diced green chiles, and doubled the spices to serve it cold. It's better the next day, so make it ahead. When I subbed couscous, it just wasn't as good. So get the quinoa in bulk.

This was EASY, Healthy, and we LOVED it. We took advice of someone else and chopped up 1 red pepper added in with the corn, kicked up the heat with additional cayenne becasue we like it HOT, and served in honey wheat tortilla shells w/ chopped organic cabbage, blue cheese crumbles a squeeze of lime and a dollop of sour cream. Oh my goodness! This is a keeper!!

I accidentally jumped the gun and added all the ingredients after the onions were cooked. I think it was a great error because this dish was delicious, not gluey like some other reviewers claimed. I think it has great flavor and is a perfect basic recipe that can be altered in soooo many ways.

Deeeelish!  This is fabulous and my whole family enjoyed it.  I used about 1/2 t cayenne and used canned corn and one can of black beans, but otherwise followed the recipe.   It was just right.  No way it served 10 at my house though.  4 of us eating it as a main dish polished it off.

This delicious and easy to make. I cut back on the cayenne pepper because I thought a 1/4 tsp might make it a bit too spicy for the kids.  I added about 1/8 tsp and it still had a little bite but was just right. Will make again

Amazing!!! I didn't have enough quinoa at home so I substituted rice and it was fabulous!  I only put one can of beans instead of two. I made this last week and my children (7, 9 and 11 yr old) loved it and are already asking for it again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Yummy! I did find it a bit bland at first but it was much better with a dash of taco seasoning. I only used 1 can of black beans as other had suggested. 2 cans would have been waaaay too much!
Tastes better the next day.

This was my first time making quinoa. This recipe is a keeper! The flavor is excellent and the texture is wonderful. We make a lot of rice and beans and I think this will become a favorite at our house. This could easily be a main course when served with something like a salad as a side dish.

As others have noted, this is the perfect recipe, especially for a broke 20-something cooking for one. First and foremost, it's absolutely delicious hot or cold. It refrigerates well, which is a plus (for lunches during the week). Also, it's super cheap (especially if you make smart substitutions, like vegetable bouillon for vegetable stock and chopped garlic from a jar instead of fresh garlic. But definitely spring for the fresh cilantro--that's essential). It's also really good for you, with great protein from the quinoa and beans, and it looks gorgeous. I have been raving about this recipe to my friends, and I'm sure you will, too. Enjoy!

Delicious!  I made it as the recipe suggests and though it called for cayenne pepper, it comes in at mild at best, but I will admit, we enjoy jalapenos and serranos regularly.  I think the next time I make this I will add roasted red pepper to the mix just to liven up the color scheme.  What a great weeknight meal!

Very good recipe for quinoa! I served this with Beef fajitas and the family loved it! I rinsed the quinoa, didn't soak, and it turned out fine - not bitter, and not too mushy like some posts mentioned.  I added some of the extras mentioned and it was delish - green pepper, diced tomatoes with green chilies(drained), and some taco seasoning to give it a little more kick...felt the heat factor would be fine to start off with re: cayenne pepper. I doubled the batch, but only added the two cans called for in the original recipe.  Will definitely make this again and could totally see this as a stand alone meal! Thank you Allrecipes!

Accidentally added twice as much cayenne as recipe called for,  so I added a fresh peach and tomato to calm down the heat. Served it on warm tortillas and it turned out wonderful! Will definitely make it again, WITH peaches and tomatoes!

Excellent as written!  Wonderful flavor and healthy too!  My 2 year old declared "its delicious!".  I ate it cold the next day with some chopped tomato and a bit of sour cream.  Very versatile dish!

This was good but came out too watery. I will reduce the amount of water next time by 1/4 cup.  I also only used one can of beans and added halved graphe tomatoes for color.

Tastes great hot or cold - makes great leftovers! I added some mini peppers at the same time as the corn (I used canned corn because I didn't have frozen). Adding avocado also adds to this dish.

I usually find that quinoa is a bit bland a bitter whenever I make it at home, even if I soak it prior to cooking.  However, this recipe is wonderful!  Per others' suggestions, I soaked the quinoa before cooking.  I did not have stock on hand, so I substituted using water plus 2 tsp chicken bullion.  I also doubled the spices.  It was great!

This rocked!  My new favorite food is Quinoa.  I followed the recipie exactly as written except I added 1 small package of cooked chicken (Hormel in the deli section) and I added a handfull of chopped up cherry tomatoes.  Yum!
Even my meat loving husband said it was great!

This recipe is awesome. Prepared as is, it's a great core and is really tasty. However, the second time, I added a can of no-sodium-added diced tomatoes and it made it even better.

The third time, I added the can of tomatoes and also entire bunch of spinach. I chopped the bunch coarsely and steamed it for about 5-7 minutes while the mixture was cooking in the pot and I added the wilted spinach at the same time as the cilantro and stirred it around. It's excellent and super-nutritious.

Defiantly added to my vegetarian surviving happy list!           I make it with 1 can corn at the end and 1 can beans,also some med hot chunky salsa at the same time as the vegetable broth. serve with sour cream~so good even my big hungry meat eating hubby loves it.
(I make it in a big deep sided frying pan like you would use for making Mexican rice and i saute onion garlic and quinoa all together then put spices on,mix then add broth)freezes good too!       THANK YOU

nice change from the quinoa with soy sauce, but seems like it needs some sort of light sauce.  maybe vinegar or lemon  juice. I'm  just not sure.

I've made this a few times now -- great recipe. I agree with the changes recommended by other readers and usually halve the beans (1 can instead of 2) and add fresh diced tomatoes and lemon juice. The lemon juice is a must for me.

Yum and YUM!  I added a teaspoon of coriander (i use it a lot) and a teaspoon of lime juice.   I did add any salt. I'm going to fill tortillas with these and make them veggie tacos.

Absolutely delicious vegetarian dish!  I only used one can of beans (that's all I had on hand, but I thought it worked very well with just that), and left out the onions and cilantro (matter of personal taste).  This is perfect for a vegetarian main course!  I just made it for lunch, and ate almost half of it on my own!  SO YUMMY!

Delicious! I'll definitely make it again. I was cautious adding the spices but next time I'll add more cumin and maybe a tad more cayenne. I tossed some frozen cooked shrimp on top in the last few minutes so my husband wouldn't pout about the lack of meat, and it worked great.

A little bland.  I did add a cpl tbls of med salsa and a good sprinking of chili powder.  Also, because we aren't supposed to eat corn I used red and orange peppers.

Very good. I used 1 pint of home canned black beans so about 1/2 of what the recipe calls for. Also, if you dry toast the quinoa first it brings a more nutty flavor.

My first experience using/eating quinoa and it was fine... but nothing special.  Made according to directions and it's surprisingly bland.  I liked the quinoa+beans+corn texture, but I'll keep playing with the spices.

This was my first time preparing (or eating!) quinoa. I used chicken broth, since that's what I had, and stirred in some cut up chicken sausage. My husband and I both really liked it, though my 9-year-old didn't really care for it. It was very good and I'll make it again!

I had never even heard of quinoa until I saw this recipe, but decided to give it a try.  Since I didn't have fresh cilantro, I used dried.  Loved it and will definitely make again!  It's good as is, but I also tried it topped with shredded cheddar cheese.  Yum!

This was very good.  My husband liked it and so did my kids.  It was healthy and that was what I was looking for.  I think I'd prefer more Quinoa in the recipe, since I felt the black beans & corn overpowered it.  Otherwise it was good; nothing exceptional but I'll probably make it again.

I also had bought a big bag of quinoa at Costco and was happy to find this recipe.  It was very good, and I look forward to having it for leftovers tomorrow.  I only thing I changed about the recipe was leaving out one can of the black beans.

This is AWESOME!! I would give this more stars if I could!!  As a new vegetarian, I am always looking for new recipes and feel like I have found a winner in this one!  I made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand in my cabinets - 1 can of black beans and 1 can of pintos, 1/2 of a low-sodium taco seasoning packet, and added some Ro-Tel that was open and needed to be used.  I put a little fat free shredded cheddar and sour cream in it just before I ate it - AMAZING AND SO EASY TO MAKE!  Thank you so much for this recipe; I will be making this MANY more times!

I love this recipe and it’s always a hit! Couple of things, I make it spicier than the recipe calls for. I also add turkey sausage sometimes or put it over a bed of lettuce and put avocado and tomato on top. Mmmm. Great recipe!

this was my first time making and tasting quinoa and it was really good! i was only making for 2 ppl so i just used the measurements here as a guide and eyeballed it. i used olive oil instead of veg, chicken broth instead of veg, and also added some chickpeas and other beans to the black, as well as some green onions. not only did it taste good, but knowing how healthy this is, i will be making it again and again!

This recipe is very good. It doesn't look pretty but the taste makes up for that. When I made it I didn't have corn so I used mixed veggies and it still was delicious.  I will defiantly make this again.

Yummy! Added grated cheese and ate as a taco-style filling in corn tortillas. SO good. Good enough to be it's own main dish by itself. Excited to make it again!

I made this recipe for a "healthy eating potluck" at work and it was fabulous! Everyone gave it rave reviews and wanted the recipe. As others did, I had a few small modifications including upping the garlic and cayenne a bit and adding some diced tomatoes with green chiles. I cannot wait to make this again (but this time the whole batch will be mine)!

Delicious!  This was the first time I have made quinoa and it was very easy.  My husband loved it and we will start using is more as a side dish and in soups,etc.  I did use chicken broth because we that was what we had in the pantry.  Enjoy!

YUMMY! This was my introduction to quinoa. I substituted crushed red pepper for the cayenne pepper because that's all I had in the house, only used 1 can of beans. Very tasty!

I love this. I eat this as a meal because it's so hearty and filling. The sweetness of the corn with the other flavors, just perfect! Next time I will definitely make a double batch so I can have more leftovers! I didn't use a whole onion because I thought it would be too much, so I used about 1/3, then added some green onions which were yummy with it. Thankyou so much for this keeper recipe!

Amazing. I used about half the cayenne and it still had a little heat but was suitable for my son. I would use the full amount if it were just for me.

Very good! This was my first experience with quinoa, and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and it turned out just fine. The spices gave it a nice taste that wasn't overpowering. I will make this again soon!

This was the first quinoa dish I've ever tried, and I'm hooked! I used chili powder instead of cayenne pepper and I added a can of diced tomatoes, drained. I also skipped the cilantro. So good!

This recipe was great! Used a can of both black and small white beans and threw in some sausage to make it a full meal. Didn't have cumin and cayenne so used a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash seasoning. Will definitely make again!

Added some extra corn and used 1 1/2 cans of black beans.  Loved it!  I thought it didn't look great, but sure did taste great.

This recipe had a lot of potential and I likes the idea of incorporating different textures of food into one dish. However 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper is entirely too much. It came out so spicy that enjoying it was nearly impossible. I would suggest using a pinch of cayenne for flavor or not using it at all.

Awesome! We left out the cilantro and also the cayenne since the kids don't like spicy food, but everyone in our family loved it.  I never follow recipes to the letter, so I like this recipe due to the ability to adjust to taste.   Next time I will make it with chicken broth and add diced tomatoes.

Love, Love, Loved this!!  I have to mention I hate cilantro so I used parsley & sprinkled in about 1 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro. Without fresh corn available I had to use canned.  Awesome dish I will make over & over!!

This was actually good!  Really good!  My very last attempt to make anything palatable with quinoa worked out.  

Reading the comments helped, especially rinsing the quinoa.  How to accomplish that is a trick, since it floats and sticks to everything like dog fur.  But I figured it out.

And I used chicken broth, can of corn, and, the best part a can of Rotel tomatoes.  Ate with corn chips and sour cream.  Even my husband liked it.  :-)

I didn't have cumin or cayenne, but I put in some red pepper flakes and some salsa. Also, I only put in one can of black beans. Snowed in and it was so awesome. Definitely going into regular rotation as a main dish!

This is SO GOOD. I looked up this recipe for something healthy to eat. I didn't expect it to be DELICIOUS. I did make the following changes: increased to 4 cloves garlic, I used 1tsp lemon pepper, and no cayenne, used 1 can black beans, and 1 can diced tomatoes. I WILL make this again!

This is an excellent recipe!  I've tried quinoa before and wasn't too impressed, the first recipe I tried was pretty plain, just had a little ginger and green onions.  So, I was a little skeptical on trying quinoa again, but I still had half the package left from my first attempt and decided to give it another go.  I figured you can't go wrong with a black bean/corn combo.  These flavors go together wonderfully.

This dish is amazing!  I follow the recipe exactly except when done I add a dab of sour cream and salsa on top.  Perfect for a meal!

Very tasty!!  I used chicken bouillon instead of vegetable broth, bulgar instead of quinoa, (I didn't soak it), one can of black beans instead of two, and one can of corn, instead of frozen corn.  I can see that it would be delicious in a tortilla as well!!  We will definitely have this again!!

To be honest, I wasn't familiar with quinoa at all..but the picture caught my attention and looked like something I'd enjoy. I'm glad I made it! It was very flavorful and I'll definitely be making it again.

Unfortunately, my family didn't care much at all for this recipe. It's not so much that it was "bad" but more that it lacked the flavor we were hoping for. The texture also left a little to be desired as well. I may try again and tweak it a little in the future, but for now this one is sadly at the bottom of our list.

This was my first experience with quinoa. I'm in a weight loss competition at work and am trying to eat better. Quinoa is easy and delicious and fits right in with my "better choices" model! I love this recipe.

I made this with Red Quinoa (lower calories, higher protein) and this came out very satisfying. I added some extra red pepper for more of a kick and only 1 can of black beans. I did add a can of rotel as well. I made extras for lunch and it tastes great reheated. Highly recommend!

Loved this!!  Quinoa is so good for you and I was looking for a good way to prepare it.  This is it!  Really easy and it's addictive.  I couldn't stop eating it when I was putting the leftovers away.  I will definitely add this to my list of regular sides.

This was excellent. Even my picky husband who is not used to "exotic" foods liked it. I was nervous about the cumin as it is not my favorite spice, but it blended with the other flavors beautifully. The only thing I find questionable is the number of servings the recipe says it yields; I halved the recipe as I was serving it as a side dish just for the 2 of us and we only had a tiny little bit leftover...and I am a very light eater. I don't think that the original recipe would yield 10 servings, maybe more like 6.

This is a great recipe! I had everything on hand, except veggie broth, and it was really easy to make and tastes fantastic.  I have been eating it all week for lunch and get lots of questions and comments from coworkers. I did add three chopped tomatoes once it was done cooking, but this wasn't *needed*, just wanted to use them up.  I will make this again. Thank you for the recipe, OP. Edit - I agree with the popular comment that 1 can of beans is plenty.

This is FANTASTIC stuff.  Easy, tasty and great for you.  Unlike some, I didn't find two cans of black beans overwhelming.  I added extra cumin and a lot of black pepper; as I'm not much of an onion fan, I just left that out. I also used dried cilantro instead of fresh (and of course less of it), adding that with the rest of the spices at the beginning.  The end result is still terrific. Might eventually try stirring in some diced tomatoes near the end.

SOOOOO delicious!  I only made a couple of changes and that's because I keep black beans cooked and in my freezer, so mine had extra garlic, onion, and some sausage.  Will definitely make again, and again, and again...

I have never reviewed anything on here, but this recipe deserves it.  My wife and I are trying to eat healthier due to the fact we are starting a family.  I made this last night, which could of easily been a meal in itself.  With the leftovers, I am making a healthy version of stuffed peppers, and later this week will probably use the rest in lettuce wraps.  Like others on here, I added diced bell peppers.  We also enjoy a little bit spicier food, so I added more cayenne pepper.  Next time I might add some chipotle chillies, just to add some kick.  Thank you very much for the great recipe!

This was a yummy, healthy, easy to make meal.  I added 1 diced red pepper for color and put some shredded cheese on my kid's servings to make it more attractive to them and they did eat it!  Good cold as well.  Will definitely make again.

Fantastic! I didn't have cayenne so I added a few dashes of tabasco, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and added a little lemon juice at the end. Had it with an avocado on the side and it was the perfect lunch! I'm a vegetarian so I eat beans almost every day and this was a great alternative to my typical bean dishes, plus it has a ton of protein. Love it!

I thought this was very good.  My husband found it a bit bland, but I added salt, and ate with sour cream and thought it was pretty good.  I also enjoyed the cold leftovers the next day.  I may try to tweak it again in the future to better suit my husband's tastes.

I made this over the weekend and it was great!  When I got to the store they were out of quinoa so I used barley instead, was still very yummy!  I also added a chopped pepper after sauting the onion and garlic.  Like others I only used one can of beans, and it was plenty!  Will definitely make again, thanks!!!!

This is a great dish!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I used only one can of black beans, and added some diced up chicken.  It was delicious.  My boyfriend who has never had quinoa before loved it, and asked if I could make it every day!  I won't be doing that, but  I'll certainly make it again and again.

I made it as is except for cooking the quinoa with chicken broth and only adding one can of beans.  I topped it off with cheddar cheese.  Yum!  Everybody loved it!  Even my picky 3 year old ate it after I picked out the beans for him.

YUM! This is the first time I tried quinoa and wow am I glad I tried this recipe. I didn't change a thing except that I only put in one can of black beans.  I let my quinoa soak in a dish of water for a couple of hours, then strained it with clean water. Such a wonderful grain!

I had never had Quinoa before but I had been wanting to try it for some time. I am VERY pleased that I found this recipe! It was DELICIOUS!! Here at our house we are trying to lower our cholesterol so this was a perfect substitution for meat as a main course. I found that once I added one can of beans it looked to be plenty so I just put the other can back on the shelf. ;-) We like a lot of spice at our house so we found this recipe to be a little bland as it is written. I had a pack of southwest spice blend so I added a few tablespoons of that as well as some lime juice to it before I served it. This is going to become a staple recipe at our house!! Highly recomend it!!

I love this recipe and have used it several times.   I usually add a can of diced tomatoes and sometimes a little lime juice.  It's important to rinse the quinoa to get rid of the bitter coating.

I used can corn and 1 can of kidney beans, left out cilantro because I didn't have any. This came out great, and my picky vegetarian son LOVED it!  I had him eat it as a salad with a little salsa and shredded cheese in his school lunch. It is a mild dish with mellow flavors that would be good with something spicy.

Sorry, guys. This just didn't work for me.  And I so wanted it to!  I love quinoa and black beans, plus with all of the rave reviews, I figured it was a slam dunk.  Unfortunately, it wasn't... at all.  I found it an extremely boring and bland dish.  The only flavor that came through at all was the cumin and I used double the garlic.  I definitely won't be making again.

I'm glad I chose to use this recipe to try quinoa for the 1st time. I liked it cold for lunch or a snack. I kept it in a plastic storage container so I could grab it whenever. I chopped some thai chili's from my garden right before I ate it cuz I love spicy stuff.

This is great! DH was dubious -- sounded WAY too healthy for his tastes -- but loved it.  Following other posts' suggestions, I cut the black beans back to 1.5 cans, but made up some of the volume by adding a bit of extra corn.  And I used chicken broth rather than veggie.  But otherwise it was as written, and it was a huge success.  Quick, easy, yummy, inexpensive, and fabulously healthful -- what more can you ask?  This was my first experience with quinoa, too ... but it certainly won't be my last!

As written, this recipe gets four stars for taste, health, ease, and overall appeal.  However, with the addition of a little cheese (I tried Monterey Jack), fresh diced tomatoes, canned green chiles, and by using fresh corn cut off the cob, this recipe skyrocketed to 5+.  The quality of ingredients has such a huge impact on this recipe - use fresh ingredients if at all possible - fresh garlic, onion, etc.  Home cooked black beans would be even better - kicking the "canned" taste while reducing the sodium.  Thanks for a really great recipe that I'll surely repeat.

I made this exactly except I added diced red pepper and did half black beans and half pinto beans. I thought it was pretty gross. I ate some of it because it is healthy and filling, but I couldn't eat much.

I've made this twice.  The first time I served it as a side dish and then using the leftovers served it as a main meal adding a formed toasted small floor tortilla shell with the condiments for a taco salad (e.g., sour cream, salsa, tomatoe).  I typically use fresh corn and per suggestions of others, I use only one can of black beans.  Tomorrow, I'm bringing this as a side dish for a work party.  I've found this recipe to be forgivable and adaptable - you can add any enhancements you want.

We loved this recipe.  It was delicious as is but I have some Costa Rican Salsa (Salsa Lizano) in my refrigerator and it elevated the dish to out of this world.

Fantastic and alterations are very easily made.  I made mine in a rice cooker and doubled the quinoa leaving the beans at the same amount along with the rest of the ingredients. i used water instead of vegetable broth and olive oil instead of vegetable oil and forgot about the cilantro and its still great.  i will add more veggies i think next time.

This was my first time trying quinoa! It was really good. I used only one can black beans and olive oil instead of veg oil. I used a little bit less veg. broth than it called for but next time will use the full amount. I forgot to buy the cilantro-- didn't miss it too much, but hope to try it with it next time. YOU MUST USE FRESH LIME JUICE! Squeeze some on before eating-- it seriously adds so much to the dish.

I made according to the recipe, and the quinoa came out fairly mushy.  Next time I will decrease the broth a bit and not cook quite as long.  Thank you for sharing :)

This was an excellent, easy, one-pot quinoa dish.  I served with salsa and probably could have used some cheese and avocado.  Quinoa is always better cold the next day, so it can only get better!

Love it! I didn't have any broth on hand so I just used water. Kicked up the cumin and cayenne a little and used one can of beans plus a little that was leftover from a can I'd already opened. I also added an orange bell pepper with my onions and garlic. Very easy recipe to adapt to your own tastes.

Love this, but it needs more spices or it could wind up being a little bland. The second time I made it, I added andouille sausage to make it spicier and heartier.

This was great. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes w/ chilis in place of 1 can of black beans. I think it would be way too many beans otherwise. If you are a fan of Chipotle's burrito bowls, try this quinoa topped with fajita style green peppers, onions and chicken, along with some salsa and sour cream. It makes an excellent meal!

I loved this. I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of the vegetable oil and increased it to 3 tbsp. I also used 3 tsp of refrigerated chopped garlic. I substituted 1 tbsp of Creole seasoning for the cayenne pepper, salt and pepper. And added 1 14.5-oz. can of diced tomatoes. It was a HIT! I will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty, but not my favorite dish ever.  I think I'd leave out the corn, because the sweetness didn't go well with dish, for some reason.  I normally love corn, because it's flavor always comes through so well, despite spices, etc., but I just didn't like it with this.

I doubled this recipe to use as a main dish for my family of 4 (husband who just ran 16 miles, hungry 4 yr old boy, 8 yr old girl, and a very hungry Mommy) and we still had leftovers for lunch (or side dish at dinner the next night).  Changes:  Did NOT double the beans--2 cans was plenty, even when doubled.  Added a bit of chopped orange bell pepper when sauteing, and then a can of Rotel tomatoes w/ the liquid.  It was a delicious meal.  Served w/ tortillas and avocado.

My husband and I really liked this!  I used about 1/2 of red pepper,2 small chicken breasts, chicken broth, and only 1 can of black beans.  We topped it with shredded cheese.  I think I'd like to try adding some chopped tomatoes next time.  Quinoa is my new friend!

Very yummy! We had to use less liquid & watch your quinoa so you don't overcook it & it becomes mushy. Added Feta & it was fabulous. We will make again.

I did add salsa to the broth but this deserves 5 stars for making me love quinoa and for making the pickiest of all eaters: my boyfriend enjoy it. It is absolutely great with these Mexican seasonings, beans and corn. Salsa is a great addition too. Thanks!!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. I've made this atleast 5 times, and I hardly cook. Each and every time, it turns out wonderfully. I usually use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, sautee the onions with red bell peppers for added color and flavor and sometimes I substitute the corn for frozen peas--these are changes that I opt to make, you definitely can't go wrong if you follow the original recipe exactly.

This was a good main dish, however it was a tad bit on the spicy side for me, so next time I may use less cayenne pepper. I substituted 2 chopped plum tomatoes and used only 1 can of black beans, as dh is not a fan of corn or beans, plus I thought that 2 cans would be a bit too much for this dish anyway. I also added the beans with the tomatoes and let it simmer for a few minutes instead of waiting till the end to add them. DH seemed to like it and I will be making this again in the near future.

We are new to the vegetarian front and this dish was an absolute hit. We served it as a main dish and prepared a sauteed kale salad to go along with it and it was delicious. No changes here but I will say that the fresh cilantro is what made it so special so don't skimp on that!

wonderful substitution for rice or couscous!! this had a nice southwestern taste to it...not too spicy but a little hot.  i used about 19 ounces of black beans rather than the suggested 30 ounces.

This was excellent. I made it as a quick 1 dish dinner for my family. The kids (3 and 1) loved it. My husband and I enjoyed it too. I am recently diagnosed with celiac and it was nice to find an alternative to rice. The only change I made was to use 1 can of black beans rather than 2 like many of the reviews recommended.

Excellent!  I discovered quinoa only about 2 years ago, and I love it.  It's not only simple to cook, but it's also incredibly good for you.  The light fluffy texture of this powerhouse of a grain is wonderful, but it does need some sprucing up in flavor, and this recipe does that perfectly.

Excellent and very easy/efficient recipe! After reading the reviews I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, added more cayenne, halved the beans and added crumbled goat cheese with the cilantro. Delicious!

MAKE IT A MAIN DISH! ADD SHRIMP! So Good! I made this as directed, but added 1 red bell pepper in with the onion, and 1 lb. of raw shrimp just before the black beans. I added 1/2 cup of water with the shrimp and put a cover on it until the shrimp turned pink, stiring a few times. SOOO DELICIOUS! I do not eat meat other then seafood, so I have tried a lot of shrimp recipes, and this one is the best, and also the healthiest! I will be making this ALL the time. It is my new favorite recipe, yeah, it is that good!

This is the first time I had quinoa.  I love rice and beans, so figured I'd like this.  It was wonderful.  I had it for lunch yesterday and warmed the leftovers up for breakfast.  I will definitely be making this again.  I only used one can of black beans, and used chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable broth.  Other than that, I made it as directed.  SUPER!  Nice introduction to quinoa.

This was my first meal with quinoa and this recipe did not dissappoint. My husband, who prefers mashed potates and gravy, absolutely loved it. My Mom, very traditional and not always open to try new things, came back for seconds!! We all love it as written and will not change a thing. My husband even asked for leftovers for lunch!! A total hit. Thanks

This was great, but agree with 'kaz' that the quinoa was a little lost in the dish.   Finished the dish with juice from half a lime and served with a dollop of sour cream, diced avocado, chopped cilantro and the green parts of a bunch of green (spring) onions.

The reviews I read prior to preparing this gave me higher expectations than the meal delivered. I followed the recipe EXACTLY (which I seldom do). I really like Quinoa, but this was a strange combination and drowned out most, if not all, of the Quinoa's contribution to flavor. This reminds me a little of Cowboy Caviar except heated. I think I will stay with the Quinoa Side Dish recipe, also on this site.

I am giving this a 5 star based on my vegan's daughter review.  She told me this one is a keeper so I will surely be making it for her again.  I omitted the cilantro (her preference)and the red pepper (my preference).  I thought it was tasty but the quinoa had a grayc color to it that kind of turned me off.  It has been awhile since I made quinua but I don't recall it having that hue,

Three letters: Y.U.M.!!! I have made this recipe without any changes twice this week and it is delicious! This was my first time making a dish with quinoa, and my whole family enjoyed this recipe and the nutty flavor the quinoa seems to add. It reheats well and we even like it cold. If the nutritional information is correct I counted out (10) 2/3 cup servings. This is a great recipe, goes well with chicken and beef, probably just about anything!

I love this. It's so healthy which makes it even better! The only changes I made were to use hot sauce (like Crystal or Tabasco) instead of the cayenne pepper, I added about a 1/2 cup of salsa, and the juice of half a lime. It's got a fresh taste. It's good hot or cold, as a dip with tortilla chips or stuffed in a Burrito. A real keeper!

Much better the second day, and as a filling for burritos.  I tried to eat it hot with sour cream... like chili... and it was not so good.   Good cold, in a wrap.

This was a hit. Easy to prepare, easy to make, easy to eat! No crazy ingredients necessary, and pretty affordable too! I followed the recipe exactly-ish: except I took everyone's advice and used one can of black beans instead of two. I will most definitely be making this one again!

This was really delicious.  I made the recipe and added sauteed cherry tomatoes and a hot pepper from my garden.  My husband loved it.  I roasted the corn on the grill and it added to the flavor. Delicious!

I love this recipe.  Used chicken broth instead of water and added a some chopped Hatch Peppers and RoTel Tomatoes.   Also just 1 can of beans.     I could eat this every day!

I added fresh squeezed lime juice to this and it really made the dish. With lime, it gets a 5. I also added chopped squash since I happened to have it.

Really great recipe! I think it's easy to personalize to add according to your personal preferences. Was unexpectedly slightly sweet! Nice touch. With bolder seasonings, it would be a 5 star easy!

We really liked this recipe!  I did add about half of a chopped red and orange pepper each for some color and to make it more of a main dish. I am looking forward to having the leftovers cold tommorow for lunch!

This was my first try at cooking quinoa and this recipe was great!  Easy, healthy, filling, flavorful and inexpensive.  Like others, I only used 1 can of beans which was plenty.  I added a tomato for color and added some lime juice which really worked well.  I used chicken broth instead of veggie.  I ended up using the whole can of broth (2 cups).  I should've kept to the 1.5 cups the recipe recommended as the quinoa came out a bit mushy.  Something I'll keep in mind for next time!

So yummy and wonderful texture! I might reduce the cilantro a bit (boyfriend is not a fan of it generally) and I might increase the cumin a tad next time I make it but even as is, it's so so good. I used only one 19 oz can of black beans and I felt it was enough and I used red quinoa which tastes the same as the normal kind but looks pretty in case you feel like a change.

GREAT!! I never had quinoa before so I  tried this recipe last week because I've been reading how good it is for you.  The more I ate it, the more I liked it.  As others suggested I used only 1 can of black beans and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I just made it again today and the only addition I made was to add l/2 cup of chopped water chestnuts along with the beans.  Not only did it add more fiber and protein, but the crunch made it really yummy.  Next time I'll add the whole can of water chestnuts.  I've added this to my breakfast menu!

AWESOME recipe!  Try this: Instead of 1 1/2 cup broth use:  1 Cup broth, 1 Cup of diced tomato with juice (I used my own bottled tomatos). My first time eating quinoa, this will be a regular dish at my house.  Try with "Authentic Mexican Tortillas" from Allrecipes.  A perfect and easy dinner.  Cook 30 minutes

Like others I used only 1 can of black beans and added a half can of diced tomatoes, a diced green pepper, and a squeeze of lime.  I cut the cilantro in half.  I subbed chili powder for cayenne pepper since I didn't have any.  I also didn't soak the quinoa.  I thought it tasted really good.  I might even take down the cilantro a bit since I'm not too keen on the taste. My mother didn't like it but she doesn't like anything that's not meat and potatoes.  She's Scottish and we know the Scots are not known for their culinary prowess.

This recipe is as good as its almost five stars deserve.  I gave it to several quinoa newbies and they became instant fans. I did make a couple of slight changes.  I used coconut oil because it just seemed right- and it was!  It was a perfect and wonderful edition. I also used pinto beans and chipotle pepper because I was out of cayenne and black beans.  I would do the chipotle again, but it needed black beans (duh).

I made this early last week and have been thinking about this dish everyday since.  I cut in half, soaked the quinoa for 20 minutes or so.  I used about 1/2 the cumin and toasted it with the quinoa as it sauteed.  I love cumin, but not everyone does.  A smaller dose is just enough to add a delicious flavor, and no one has any idea that the flavor is cumin.  Added the corn and beans at the same time - cooked the whole dish about 10 less then suggested.  Also subbed parsley for the cilantro - love cilantro but was using what I had on hand.

This is SO good. I love quinoa and dont have a lot of recipes. I dont like vegetable broth, so I  used 1 can of chicken broth and just 1 can of black beans. I totally forgot the cilantro, but it was still great. Next time. Nice little bite w/the cayenne and cumin.

So delicious! Unfortunately I didn't have any cilantro, but to give it a little more taste I added about half a teaspoon of Santa Maria seasoning (normally used a barbeque rub but I put it on a lot of things). I started eating it right out of the pot, it was so good. Also good on a toasted whole wheat pita and with baked tortilla chips. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

An excellent recipe as is and that's also very adaptable. At various times I've added chopped winter squash, extra veggies (whatever was on hand), and used this as the filling for a tortilla wrap or a hollowed-out zucchini or acorn squash. Always terrific. 

I do usually add more cayenne or a chopped fresh chili pepper, because we like things a bit of the hot side. Frying a crumbled hot Italian sausage and adding it to the mix is a good addition for the carnivores in the family.

DELICIOUS! I didn't have any corn on hand so I used edamame instead and only used one can of black beans as others suggested.  My husband devored this and went back for seconds. It's great hot or cold, and even better the next day! Thanks!

This is a great dish.  It's easy, cheap, healthy, and very tasty.  I agree with the consensus about the black beans--one can was definitely enough.  And I put in extra cayenne pepper for a little extra pop, but otherwise I was impressed with it.

Very good dish!  I only used one can of beans and think 2 cans would have been way to much.  You can play with the spices and make it to your liking.  You can also add some peppers when sauteing the onions.  I look forward to making this dish again.

Good! I never cook, but this was easy, the ingredients were cheap, it's full of flavour, and it's filling. I used brown rice instead of quinoa (which I couldn't find in my local grocery store). I also used only 1 can of black beans, and did not use cayenne pepper.
Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe warm or cold. I make a batch as my standard summer salad for the kids to grab from the fridge. Can't say enough good things about it. Often add whatever veggie is in season. Bulgar or cous-cous can be used instead but quinoa is the best!

I love this recipe! I usually make a big batch at the beginning of the week and eat it for lunch/snacks all week. Its a complete meal in itself, I'll add a dollop of fat free sour cream and 1/4 an avocado. I don't use cilantro (hate the stuff), and to give it even more nutritional value I'll add a can of diced tomatoes and 1-2c chopped fresh spinach. I only use 1 can of beans and add extra cumin, delicious and healthy!

I love this recipe. I've made it a lot of times, and vary it somewhat each time. I've enjoyed it no matter how it has been made.

Some modifications I've made on different occasions: 
Chicken Broth instead of Vegetable Broth or half of each.
Added Water Chestnuts, and red and yellow peppers right at the end.
Canned corn instead of frozen
1 can of black beans instead of two (in fact I've doubled all the other ingredients and still only used 1/2 the black beans)
a splash of soy sauce (note: i've only done this on the occasions where i've used primarily veggie broth and not chicken broth)

I once even used 1/3 couscous when i ran out of quinoa.
No matter how you change this recipe you can't mess it up.
healthful, and delicious every time.

I love black beans and rice, and this was very similiar. The only thing I added was a Sazon de Goya packet, just because I like that extra little mexican spice kick when I'm eating black beans.

I love this recipe! Super healthy and delish. I followed pretty much exactly, except that I used frozen roasted corn from Trader Joes, which added a nice flavor. Oh, and I also used only one can of beans and that was perfect. I like to serve on warmed corn tortillas with a little sour cream and sliced avocado. Mmmmmmmmmmmm.

This was a really good dish and will definitely become a regular! I followed the advice of other reviewers and only used one can of beans and that was definitely enough. Also, I added fresh lime juice and diced avocado at the end and it was so incredible! Next time I'll try adding diced tomatoes as well. Thank you for the recipe and the suggestions!

This was my first time making quinoa, and I'll definitely be making it again.  Even my carnivorous husband loved it, although he wanted a bit of cheese on top.  I'm amazed at how quick, easy, and tasty this was!

--I did add some diced tomatoes which I highly recommend both for flavor and attractive color. (Only use one can of beans! That's perfect!)
--I did not do any special preparation to the quinoa.  I was afraid it would be slightly crunchy or nutty, like brown rice can be, but found it to be soft and pleasingly palatable instead.

MMMMM...I really liked this!  It was my first experience w/ quinoa and I'll definately make it again.  I only used one can of beans and ate it as a main course, maybe 3 hearty servings.  As many people have suggested, I think adding tomatoes would be good.

So yummy!  It made a ton! So far I've had it warm, cold, in a tortilla, and by itself.  All delicious!  I definitely suggest adding a can of diced tomatos (drain well first) and I do NOT think it is necessary to soak the grain first...it got mushy.  The flavor is excellent though.  I also doubled the amount of cayenne because I like it spicy. YUM!

This recipe was delicious.  I read an article the other day that said quinoa is a "super food" really good for you, and is overlooked by most people. So I searched for a recipe...and found this!  Wonderful & thanks for submitting!

This was amazing! As others suggested I added some zucchini and fresh tomato and only one can of black beans. This is by far the best way I have had quinoa.

This is a very good quinoa recipe. I used one can of black beans, and that was just right. I thought it needed some vinegar to balance out the sweetness of the corn (I used fresh, which I added at the end with the beans) and the creaminess of the beans, so I added a generous dose of my favorite green hot sauce, and that put it over the edge. A definite keeper, and very easy to prepare.

This was my introduction to "Quinoa". LOVED it. My husband also. Will definitly make it again. Would be perfect for a summer barbeque side dish. Oh yea- I also used just one can of black beans- seemed the perfect ratio to me.

Tried this a couple of times now & I rated this a 4 because it is a good basic recipe. We liked it better using some jalapeno & red peppers in it, then it w/be a 5. Nice change from beans & rice.

I thought this was missing something after it cooked, so I stirred in half a jar of salsa and that did the trick.  I will also add only 1 can of black beans next time.  I love quinoa, but this isn't my favorite way of preparing it.  It will be a good, healthy stand-in for Mexican rice with the tweaks, though.

I enjoyed this recipe. I did add some diced tomatoes.  I served it with ripe avocado slices and fried green platano. I'm going to make it again this weekend with more of a southwestern feel by adding red and green bell peppers, sweet red onion, chili powder, and some chipotle.

oh yum. this was just GOOD. not too difficult either. just chopped the garlic a red onion and a red pepper, threw it in a pot while i rinsed the quinoa and chopped the cilantro, and 20 minutes later - yum! doesn't get much easier. It could be a bit spicier I think, but the flavors are really nice. I added the squeeze of lime, which always compliments cilantro so well. i used both cans of beans and didn't think they overpowered it at all (plus, for vegans, it's an extra dose of protein!). served it in south beach whole wheat wraps, with a side of veggies (baked vegetables I on this site) - an excellent vegan meal, filling and tasty. i plan to add sliced avocado for a little "good fat" too. i already ate it as leftovers, cold, for lunch and it was great. it would be delish on a bed of greens, with maybe a bit of salsa or pico de gallo. I'll definitely make it again; it will likely become a lunch-for-the-week staple!

Outstanding. This is one of my new favorite dishes. As others have mentioned, it's easy enough to modify (I like to add red peppers) and build on, but you won't go wrong with this one.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first time making quinoa, and it was delicious. Easy too, since the only chopping was the onion. I only used one can of beans, and thought the proportions were just right. I will be making this  again, and often.

Made this last night, and it was great.  Followed others' reccomendations and only used one can of beans.  I think next time I will make this ahead and serve it cold.  It seems like it would be a great summer salad, maybe throw in a diced mango.

I decided to make this since I am trying to incorporate more whole grains in my diet.  I had never treid quinoa before and I was pleasantly surprised.  This was a really easy and very tasty dish.  I did leave out the cilantro because I don't care for it much and I added an extra 1/4 cup of corn, but otherwise I made it as written.  It has  a mild but pleasant flavor, it's filling, and it's very good for you.  I stir fried some snow peas and bell peppers to serve with it.  Yum!

I give this five stars both for its flavor and nutrition content.  I had never tried quinoa before, and this was a great recipe for trying something new.  I would probably add a little more cayenne pepper to taste, but I like things spicy!  I would also probably use the whole can of vegetable broth, since the beans could use a little more moisture.  This dish seems to be best eaten right after you fix it, since the cilantro is still fresh and flavorful, but it also works well for lunch the next day.

Great recipe!  It was my first time making quinoa and we loved it!  I left out the garlic, corn and cilantro since I just used what I had on hand.  It was still left with great flavor.  This will definitely be made again and again in my household!

What a lovely, versatile recipe!   I added red peppers and tomatoes and served on tortillas with salsa, sour cream and shredded cheese.   I can imagine adding all kinds of fruits and veggies  or just enjoying as is.  Definitely a keeper!

Impressively healthy - a agreat first experience with quinoa. I've passed this recipe on to several people. The original recipe serves 10 but we wrapped them in tortillas as a main meal and it most comfortably serves four or five.

We made adjustments based on taste and what we had on hand: no cayenne, 1 can black beans, added can of tomatoes with jalapenos, and, much to my dismay, no cilantro - we love cilantro, so I know that would have made it better. I ate it with blue chips. It was good, a little mushy, but I've never made quinoa before so I didn't know what to expect.  The flavor was very good, though, and was filling enough for main dish leftovers for me.  Will make again.

This was my first time using quinoa and it turned out great!  I brought it to a party and it was the first thing that was gone.  I had to make it again so that I could eat some!

This was very good and very different. I served this to a group including my mom, who can not eat corn. I substituted diced red bell pepper for color and some sweetness. It was a hit. We did not find it too beany for our tastes, but our family is big on the black beans. I could certainly see reducing them as others have mentioned (or possibly just increasing the quinoa by 50% or so). I served a little diced avocado for garnish/topping, and it went really well with it. Recommend this touch.

I will definitely make this again.

This was my first time cooking with quinoa.  Mine turned out pretty mushy and soupy.  It could be the pot I used, it doesnt cook rice well either.  This dish was just ok to me, I added a bunch of salsa (Sarah's salsa) and it tastes better.  I'm wonering if I'd like it better if I cooked the quinoa separate, then added the ingredients.  I think it would be good with green onions and red peppers, black beans, corn and garlic...that would be my preference.  ETA:  so its a couple years later and I've finally learned how to quick quinoa correctly.  I will have to give this recipe a try again, I've learned to watch the quinoa as it may cook quicker and then I can dump out the extra liquid if need be.  I bet this recipe is good done correctly.

wow ... need i say anymore?  this was absolutely fantastic! i used only 1 can of black beans and added 1 can on tomatoes (drained), which in my opinion, was perfect.  i've never even heard of quinoa before, but the reviews were so great, i had to try it.  and i'm so glad i did!!!  we had it as a side-dish with blackened chicken and chips and salsa and it was a FANTASTIC meal!  thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful meal!  I'm 21 and end up cooking a lot for my boyfriend/roommates/friends.  Everyone who has tried this recipe LOVES it and can't beleive they've never had quinoa before.  I have to sub Chicken broth for vegetable broth because of availability, but otherwise I follow the direction.  It serves a great meal for about five people.

This was my first attempt at quinoa and it was a hit.  Two of my 3 kids loved it, the 3rd is only 2, so her opinion doesn't count, LOL.  My husband liked it, mother in law loved it and as far as I know, my father in law liked it as well.


What I did different: added carrots, omitted cayenne for kids, increased cooking time and vegetable broth out of neccessity.  I ended up having to cook it an additional 10 minutes, which is no biggie.  I also omitted the cilantro  mainly cause I forget but the people in my family aren't crazy about it anyway.

Yummy.  Here were my changes:  Chix broth instead of veg. broth cuz that's what I had on hand; I added one coursely chopped carrot about half-way into the cooking time for the quinoa (for color and crunch!); added only one can of black beans (I felt that was plenty); added one can of diced tomatoes w/roasted garlic; and used dried cilantro instead of fresh, and threw in a couple of dashes of "Mexican" seasoning along with the cumin.  This is a good dish, and one in which you can try lots of different variations on.  The quinoa itself is a very soft, light grain.  I'm glad I tried it!  Thx for the recipe!

This was my first time trying quinoa and it was delicious!  However - I found myself wanting more quinoa and less beans (and I LOVE black beans).  Next time I will add just a little bit less beans.

A fantastic twist on the traditional red beans & rice. I didn't have cilantro so I substituted dried parsley which worked fine. I ate it until the leftovers were gone!

I really liked this!  I added some fresh salsa at the end for extra spice and color.  My family didn't care for the quinoa, so the second time I made it, I used half wild rice and half quinoa.  They liked it better that way.  I also used canned corn (drained) and it was fine.

This was a very exellent recipe!  Unfortunately I had to substitute millet for the quinoa because our local grocery was out but it still came out wonderful.  Tasted great wrapped like a taco in in lettuce leaves.  Can't wait to try it again with quinoa!  Thanks!

A little bland, but good overall. Doubled garlic, and cilantro, added 1/4 tsp Cajun spice, used 14 oz. chicken broth and served with diced jalapeño to add more kick. Had to cook quinoa at least 5 minutes more.

I’ve made this so many times and it’s always a hit. I add a red bell to the onion garlic sauté, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. I recommend not adding the cilantro to the whole dish if you want leftovers. It gets wilty. I chop and add as needed.

I'm testing this recipe as a meal prep potential and so far it's excellent! The ingredients are cheap and easy to prep, the simmering time made it excellent for me to work on another dish as well as clean up a bit and drink tea. It makes enough for 4 days and I get the macros im looking for (weightlifter here). I don't have a lot of time, but this only took me about 40 mins to make (in which I could finish my other 3 meals for the week). This will be a staple recipe for me from now on.

This is a light, flavorful, easy-to-make dish. My husband and I like quinoa and this has become one of our go-to weeknight recipes, especially in the warmer months. I follow the recipe, adding a good dollop of salsa at the point where you mix in the beans and cilantro. Then I serve with avocado slices and a squeeze of lemon, which really brightens the dish. Nutritious, yummy, and light!

This is great! Fast, easy, tasty, and flexible. I only had mixed frozen vegies so tossed that in for the corn. No cilantro - reminds family of stink bugs! Still delicious and makes a lot. If any leftovers it would be great as enchilada filling.

This was my first time cooking with quinoa.  Since I had leftover vegetables, this recipe looked promising.  I followed the recipe for the most part, but I did not have corn or cilantro, and instead added in a small amount of diced hot pepper, diced carrot and diced celery and sauteed them with the garlic and onion.  I followed another suggestion and put it all in a whole wheat tortilla (heated in the microwave) and sprinkled with slices of fresh cabbage.  It was excellent!  This recipe is a keeper!

ok i'm not sure what i missed. Followed the recipe to the T. ended up with some seriously bland dinner. I had to add in tons of curry powder and eat it with a side of yogurt to be able to ingest it. It really makes me wonder how my palette is so different from all the people who love this.

This is hearty and flavorful and healthy.  I added a chopped red pepper and served with diced avocado as someone suggested. I used this as a meatless entree.  I cook quinoa separately - I find it gets sticky when I cook it with anything else.  Be sure to rinse thoroughly.  I "toast" it until it's dry before adding water, then simmer 20 min.  I sauteed the onion and garlic and then added the spices and sauteed 2 minutes before adding the chopped pepper to saute a little longer.  I added the corn and beans and heated through.  Then I stirred in the quinoa and cilantro.  We'll make this again.

Never tried a quinoa salad before but after so many rave reviews I took the leap of faith and made it for a Labor Day potluck.  It was a big hit!  Lots of people were asking about it. I did not make any changes other than doubling the recipe. Used organic Trader Joe’s quinoa, organic canned black beans from Sam’s Club, canned sweet corn,  organic vegetable broth.  I liked that this recipe was also vegan so it worked for some folks there who would otherwise have slim pickin’s. I did place a bowl of shredded cheddar on the side for people to throw in there. Because is a staple food for me. :) I will be making this again.

This was my first time trying to make quinoa.  I did add more liquid before the quinoa finished cooking and it came out nice and moist.  this recipe made much more than my husband and I could eat for dinner.  My husband came up with the idea of using the leftovers along with taco leftovers in a burrito and it was delicious.  Clearly this is a versatile dish.

I really loved this recipe as is.  I made a side salad and at this as the main course.  I did also cube some chicken thighs and add those in when I cooked the onions and garlic.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  It was flavorful and wonderful.  Don't forget to add the salt and pepper.  It did need that little bit extra, but it was still wonderful and easy to make.

It's okay.  It's something different.  I will likely make this again.  But, it's probably not going to be something that I put in my regular rotation.  I think the beans could use more cooking.  Next time, I'll try cooking the beans longer and try adding more flavor somehow.

Really great recipe...easy to make and pretty fast.  I added one diced carrot to the sautee along with the onion and garlic.  Adds some texture and color.

I made a few modifications on this recipe to turn it into a main dish.  I call it a "Southwest Quinoa Bowl".  I added a pound of ground turkey that I seasoned with Flavor God's Taco Seasoning.  I also added a little shredded cheese on the top once I finished and a dollop of sour cream on the very top.  It tastes absolutely amazing.

Solid recipe. However, I feel like there's more that can be done with the spices. I added some red pepper flakes and some bell peppers for some extra color and flavor. Turned out very good!

This was really yummy! I ran out of frozen corn so I used a can of corn. And black eyed peas instead of black. But it was very very good! I also added a few splashes of lime juice and went easy on the pepper since I'm feeding kids. There were no complaints here!

Pleasantly surprised! I am trying to start eating healthy so I found this recipe. It's day two of my healthy eating journey and I was nervous to make this dish for two reasons: #1) I've never cooked with quinoa before; and #2) I did not have vegetable broth so I had to use water instead...To my surprise, it came out really good! I like the infusion of flavors, the pop of color from the corn, and the mild heat from the spices. This one's a keeper!

Great basic recipe.  It's very adaptable to your individual taste.  We made it as a main course by adding chunks of ham and using some home-made ham stock.  My wife liked hers with some cheese on top.

I like to use taco seasoning for the quinoa, and I like to add some peppers to the onion and garlic, and make a sort of meatless taco/ burrito. This is going to be a staple food for me. its quick, easy and delicious.

This recipe is probably very good as is, but I used red quinoa cooked with chicken stock, grilled fresh corn (oiled with salt & pepper), and pink beans (since the red quinoa wouldn't contrast with black beans).  I used 3 ears of grilled corn.  I added some feta cheese as well. Everyone loved it.

I've been cooking this dish for 6 or 7 years now, and it's a constant favorite in our house. Pleases vegetarians/vegans and omnivores alike, and everyone who "doesn't like quinoa" gobbles it down after they try it. Every time I make it, I say aloud, "Why don't I make this more often?!" because it's just that yummy.

I make this as either a starchy side dish to accompany grilled meat/fish, as part of a Taco Tuesday spread, or to bring as a potluck dish. It's a great alternative to salad for vegetarians, as well as safe for those who are gluten free (we have several of those in our family, and I always bring food they can eat to potlucks).

My tips: 
*Always rinse your quinoa well, even if the bag says it's been washed; this helps eliminate the bitter taste that can accompany this grain
*1 can of black beans is enough; 2 cans felt unbalanced 
*Use fresh or (defrosted) frozen corn; canned does not provide the same crisp texture that this dish needs to keep it from having a mushy mouth-feel

I loved this.  It's quite versatile as well.  I will add chicken and/or shrimp sometimes to make it into a more filling meal.  I will probably add some bell peppers to change it up sometimes.  I did rinse the quinoa  and only used one can of the black beans.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Yummy!  Will make this again.

These were the modification I made based on what I had on hand...

Used EVOO instead of vegetable oil 

used chicken broth instead of vegetable

didn't have cayenne pepper so I sprinkled in crushed red pepper

used one can of can (drained) in place of the frozen corn

used 1 can of black beans - as suggested by other reviews

had to use dried cilantro because I didn't have fresh

Tasted it when it was done.  Was good, but felt it needed something.  I added one can of petite diced tomatoes.  That hit the spot and for me made it perfect!

Really really good! I took everyone's advice and only used one can of black beans. Next time I'll use less cilantro as well but overall it was very flavorful. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this but changed it a bit to make a main meal out of it. I used chicken breast, and cut them into 1 inch or so cubes. Then sautéed them in oil. Then I set them aside. Then I pealed and diced one sweat potato. I combined the spices and oil and poured that on the sweet potato in a bowl. Using a foil lined cookie sheet, I spread the seasoned sweet potato on the cookie sheet and baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. While the sweet potato was cooking I continued with the recipe.  I used one can drained and rinse black beans and one can drained pinto beans. I added the cooked chicken to the main recipe and cooked as directed. When almost done, I removed the sweet potato and added it to the pan. It was very good. I did use more broth by maybe a 1/2 cup. This recipe makes a lot of food. Can easily feed a family of 6.

This is a go-to pantry meal for my family. Mild enough for kids. Good with red beans or pinto beans too. Avocado on top. Yum.

This became kind of a last-minute, throw whatever I have available together thing, but it was a fantastic base to start with. Ended up using beef base to make broth, pre-seasoned "Garden Vegetable" quinoa, black and pinto beans... Yeah, strayed pretty far. But was still delicious!

This is a wonderful dish.  I only used 1 can of black beans because that is all I had.  With that being said it was the perfect amount.  I didn't have ground cumin so I used Chili Powder instead. My very picky hubby who wants meat and or bacon in practically every dish said he really liked it and that he wouldn't mind me making it again.  That deserves 10 stars if you ask me!

Easy, delicious, economical - this recipe is great. I sometimes add chopped carrots or squash to eat more veggies. This is also good as a burrito filling, with sour cream even more delicious.

I've made this several times and always get asked for the recipe.  I only use 1 can of beans - 2 seems to be a bit too much for me.  I also only use 1/4 of the cilantro, as I find cilantro to be a bit overpowering.   But these are just just my personal taste preferences.  Other than that, this is a great recipe to either leave as is or build upon to make your own!

Didn't have veg broth, used chicken.  We don't like cilantro, so used parsley.  Added only 1 can of black beans.  Was good hot but liked it better the next few days cold as a salad.  The spices were perfect, not to hot.

Yummy. Made this for an in town vegetarian friend. She loved it. My carnivorous family loved it (with a side of shredded chicken, of course). You could really add whatever veges you want with this. It's pretty versatile. Good flavor and always up for a one pot meal! Thanks.

This was a marvellous option for both my vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
I substituted parsley for cilantro & also added a generous dash each of turmeric & paprika, leaving out the cayenne pepper.
Will definitely be adding this to my repertoire!

I absolutely loved this dish! I substituted a can of black beans for a can of diced tomatoes.  After I made the dish, I decided to turn it into a casserole. I followed the recipe as is, but at the end, I put everything into a casserole dish and topped it off with Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese. I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees until the cheese was melted. It was exceptional! I definitely recommend this dish! :)

Easy and delicious.   Recommendations: use half the black beans (one can would do); 1.5 cups of corn; cook the quinoa in chicken broth.    We served the cilantro on the side since half of our crew is anti-cilantro.  Definitely making this again.

This was delicious!  I took the advice of one reviewer and added cheddar cheese and sour cream.  I had to use extra chicken broth (substituted for vegetable broth) and some water to keep the quinoa from burning.  The next time I make this, I will definitely add some green peppers, can of tomatoes with green chiles, zucchini, fresh lemon juice, and maybe mix it up with other vegetables after each iteration.

Also, I liked one of the suggestions from another reviewer: hold back your garlic until your onions are at least halfway done or it will burn, and throw in the quinoa shortly after. Toasting it lends amazing flavor. Then, add the spices and saute for a moment more, mixing thoroughly, before adding the broth of your choice

Added 2 more garlic cloves and 1T cumin and didn't have any cilantro so substituted fresh from the garden arugula - amazing peppery addition.  Really good.

This was a great way to use quinoa and pretty tasty! I added sour cream and blended cheese to a bowlful, which reminded me of a unique chili... Add a few toasted pita chips and it was a nice dinner. The only change was olive oil instead of veggie.

A pretty good recipe as is but I also only used 1 can black beans and, for a real protein punch, I added sliced up grilled chicken and used the dish as an entrée.  I would definitely use more corn in the future because it really sweetened the dish.

Loved it, but as some other reviewers did, used chicken stock instead of veggie stock, 1 can of black beans instead of 2 and substituted ground chili flakes instead of cayenne.  Also added a bit of smoked paprika - delish!

OUTSTANDING!!! I added 2 diced red peppers because I had them, only 1 can of beans because that is all I had, 1 can corn because that is what I had, no cilantro because I don't really like it but it would have been good with wilted spinach or other greens. The seasoning were outstanding just as written. I will make this again and again. With my recipe it came in at about 9 Weight Watchers points for about 1 1/2 cups. So, so good. Easy to make.

We have recently come to enjoy Quinoa.  This was a DELICIOUS recipe!  I made it "as stated" and wouldn't change anything.  To make it more of a "main dish" than a "side dish", I might add some shredded chicken or other meat.

This recipe will become my new staple.  You can add or alter any ingredient here and it just works.  I didm;t have two cans of black beans so I used one can black beans and a can of garbonzo beans.  I also added some Moroccan Spice Mix (McCormack).  Next time I will try adding white raisins!!

I just made this recipe with a few variations. Instead of cilantro, I chopped a small jalapeno in with the onions and garlic with no seeds. Instead of the frozen corn I added a frozen soup vegetable mix. The finished product was yummy! I found a flour tortilla and added the quinoa mix to it with a slice of pepper jack cheese and several chunks of fresh pineapple. Rolled it up into a burrito and added some hot sauce. WOW! That really sent this dinner over the top! Try it! Another variation is to use a Romane leaf like the tortilla. Great recipe!

I use one can each of black beans and "refried" black beans. I submerge quinoi briefly, then poor into strainer and rinse. Versatile recipe and yummy for everyone at the party, including kids. Can even be served as a dip!

Very nice recipe. I like to take bean salads for lunch during the week, and this one doesn't disappoint. Like others, I substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth. I also threw in leftover shredded carrot, chopped celery, half a red bell pepper, some fresh salsa and a chopped fresh jalapeño. Will make again! Thanks for the recipe. Update: I made this again, but cooked the quinoa separately. Then the whole dish came out bland. I added carrots and jalapeños, along with some diced tomatoes and extra cumin. Still fell flat. Too dry. Too bland. Then I added some chipotle mayo. That did the trick. A bit more spicy, but sure ramped up the flavour and texture. Very tasty!

Delicious!  Main-dish complete proteins and gluten-free!  I had started the quinoa in another pan before I knew what to serve with it, so it certainly came out a little different - I used a can of Mexican style corn with jalapenos in it.  I used only one can of black beans.  We love black beans but my 9" skillet would have overflowed with another can.  I used V8 for the vegetable broth (just added it in last to moisten the dish up) and substituted chipotl for the cayenne.  I added about 5 mushrooms, sliced with the onion and garlic, just because we love them.  Served with a sprinkle of shredded mixed cheeses, half an avocado (diced) and a tablespoonful of sour cream.  Colorful and wonderful.  It was only with great self-control that I did not run to finish up the leftovers in the pan when I finished before my son.

I like to add some cooked chicken and a can of diced tomatoes to this recipe. It's super good but I add my own seasoning instead. Super yummy in a burrito wrap!

We really liked this.  Yes, I made some changes/additions like others.  I had some celery wilting away in the fridge, just added a small stalk chopped up with a red onion. Chopped up a 1/2 yellow sweet pepper with that too.  Did not add the corn since I did not have any.  Made my own black beans (1/2 lb. dry).  I used chicken broth also.  But will definitely make again!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Did this and loved it! Changed some things to make it like a chili: 
Used black quinoa, fresh corn, and black beans. 6 cloves of garlic (fried in coconut oil at the beginning), and a bunch of spices: red pepper flakes, black pepper, parsley, bay powder, pizza seasoning, cumin and oregano. Also used real chicken broth (frozen from another meal). 
Next time l'll do the quinoa on the side, the beans on the side, and just fold everything together, and let it simmer for a bit... onions ended up too mushy for my taste. 
but otherwise, it was amazing!

First time cooking with this healthy grain, and I really liked it! I made a half-batch, and really kept an eye on it because I was afraid of burning. I did sub chicken broth for the vegetable broth and used ~1/4 cup more, which I'd do again. Having it warm now, but I can see this cold, too...like taking it as a lunch to the beach! Just dreaming, because we have tons of snow and a blizzard is on the way! Thanks 3LIONCUBS!

I love this recipe.  It is easy, healthy and delicious.  I leave out the cilantro because I don't like it.  I sometimes add grilled chicken and/ or some cheese and make this a meal.  Great and versatile recipe.

I had never tried quinoa before yet was quite curious.  A great alternative to basic rice and beans. I absolutely loved it. I didn't change a thing but next time I think I'll only use 1 can of black beans.

This is a great recipe. I gave it 4 stars because my family found it much too spicy (and I already didn't use quite as much Cayenne as called for) and I only used 1 can of black beans and think 2 would have been too much. I will be making this again for sure, but I will try with just a pinch of Cayenne next time instead of the not-quite-1/4 tsp that I used this time. As is, it tasted pretty good with some plain yogurt mixed in to cut the heat, but we couldn't eat it without.

There's only 1 reason this isn't a 5 star recipe to me: way too much cilantro! The 2nd time I made this, I cut the original amount in half and still felt it was too much. Maybe I'm overly sensitive to cilantro (I don't think so), but I think I'll try this without cilantro at all- I like everything else.

I loved this but I made a few slight adjustments: I added half a cup of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and cut back the broth by 1/2 cup; and I only used one can of black beans, which was plenty. Very good recipe regardless.

A favorite lunch recipe for me!  I do add red pepper with the onion to add color and veggie matter.  I also place a big spoonful of this on top of greens so it's a salad.  Tastier the 2nd and 3rd day and keeps well.

Extremely delicious, with a few changes. We used only one can of black beans instead of two, and really made it pop by substitutingTrader Joes Corn and Chili tomato-less salsa n lieu of frozen corn. Holy Cow!  It's delicious. We mixed the leftovers with eggs in the morning and was able to start our day with a delicious breakfast.

Made this recipe as a side dish.  I use quinoa a lot and in many different recipes. This is not my favorite quinoa dish but it wasn't bad.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was great! The only thing I had to change was the amount of chicken broth. I started with a cup and a half, but it absorbed/ evaporated so quickly that I ended up adding another cup and a half (or so). Overall, a great recipe with a little kick to keep it interesting!

best quinoa recipe I have tried yet!  I added a little coriander, I didn't have any fresh Cilantro and it was great.  Can't wait to try it with fresh Cilantro. I also used 1 can of black beans and thought it was perfect. Love reading the other reviews.  Now that I have tried the basic I will add in.

I've made this dish twice and can't get enough of it. I make a lot so that I can have it for lunch at work during the week. I added a green and red bell pepper and used black beans cooked in my crock pot to mine. The colors and taste of this recipe is such wonderful healthy treat!

OMG loved the recipe.  I actually added different colored bell peppers minced after the onions, and added some garlic salt, parsley flakes, fresh thyme, and doubled the cayenne.  Amazing flavors and great for just snacking

I liked this very much, with a few adjustments... Used red quinoa not white, chicken broth, red bell pepper, 1/2 beans, less cumin and added about a cup dried cranberries instead of corn. Going to do again with caramelized onions...will submit picture.

This recipe has become a frequent flyer in my kitchen. It is absolutely delicious and I love eating it with fresh avacado. I can (and have once or twice) made huge batches and eaten it for days. I've added it to chicken burritos and mixed it into salads. It is absolutely delicious and made me fall in love with quinoa.

I made this once, for myself, and I really should have halfed the recipe. I made it through eating all of it, as it was obviously delicious, but if you're making it for less than three people, definitely reduce the ingredients. My boyfriend is also a picky eater so he didn't like the dish, but he also just doesn't like quinoa.

I would definitely recommend this as a dish to try!

This dish was quick, very easy, super filling, and even my super picky husband liked it! I used freeze dried garlic and red onion (my husband doesn't like onion, and that's the only way I can sneak it in) but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I recommend serving with a little sour cream, hot sauce, and salsa! Loved it!

Fantastic recipe! Cheap, easy and delicious. Will recommend. I'm a bit of a newb, so I didn't deviate from the recipe at all. Will try some suggestions from the comments in the future.

My husband and I love this recipe! While the quinoa and other ingredients were simmering, I added the chopped cilantro the last 4 minutes of cooking time to give it added flavor. Also, I only used 1 can of black beans as I thought 1 was sufficient. Didn't have frozen corn so added 1 small can of corn instead.

Outstanding!

Loved it! I added some salsa and lime at the table and loved it even more. Would probably make a really good burrito filling. :)

Double quinoa and broth.  Add red, green, 1/2 jalapeño pepper with onion. Very good over chills with salsa, cheese and sour cream.

Made as directed except I did not have broth so I used 1 1/2  cup water with 2 bouillon cubes dissolved.  When I first taste tested the quinoa for doneness, I was worried because it was extremely salty!! That's something you can't fix! I proceeded on with the recipe, and had to add a little more water as the quinoa was not as tender as I'd have liked.  Once all the ingredients were added and simmered, it tasted fine, however, if I need to make that substitution again, I would only use 1 bouillon cube!  Also, it makes alot, I reheated some in the microwave 2 nights later to go with our dinner, and it tasted even better!  One of those dishes that gets better after it sits a day or so!  Will definitely make again!

This is a wonderful side dish or it can also function as a main dish. This recipe is definitely one of my most used! I add red bell pepper for a bit of color since the dish didn't have much variety in color. I only put one can of black beans in it.

We gobbled this up! We did omit the cayenne pepper, however, to make it more kid-friendly and it worked. The kids loved it -- so much so that I really think this belongs in the kid-friendly section as well.

Love this recipe with a few adjustments. I use chicken broth instead of veg. broth. Reduce black beans to 1 can. Reduce corn to 1/2 cup. Increase cumin to 2 tsp. and reduce cayenne to 1/8 tsp.  Fresh cilantro is the key and add grilled chicken and avocado to make is a meal;-)

I followed this recipe exactly and my family LOVED it. It was a bit hot for me, but the men in the family loved the heat. If you're sensitive to spicy foods, you may want to back down the cayenne pepper a bit.

Not one thing was altered with the recipe and the entire dish was eaten, with my husband asking me to make it again soon.

I love this recipe. It's my go-to recipe for quinoa. I serve it with blackened chicken and a sauce that's just cilantro, Greek yogurt, and avocado. My girlfriend and I love it and it will stay in the weekly rotation.

Great recipe.  My family loved it.  Quick, easy, and I had all the ingredients in my pantry.  Going to make another batch to take to work tomorrow and eat cold.  YUM!

Update:  My older teenage kids absolutely love this recipe and ask for it all of the time.  I've started adding chopped up chicken and then putting it into containers for them to take to school for lunch.  No need to re-heat as it's awesome cold.

I made this recipe last week for my carniferous husband and son, and vegan me.  It was a hit on all fronts, and I will most definitely make it again. Contrary to the taste of others, I thought two cans of black beans were just right. The beans add heartiness and more protein.  The only change I made was in the heat.  We're Texans, so I finely diced two jalapenos and a serrano, and added them to the saute mix, and doubled the cayenne pepper and cumin. YUM! (eta: edible quinoa isn't a grain - it's the seed of a grain)

I didn't follow this recipe but used for inspiration. I used a quinoa package that I had on hand spices already included.  With the onion and garlic I also added red yellow and orange peppers. To make it a complete meal I added some turkey sausage.

Made this once and then modified it the second time. Only used one can of black beans, a can of corn (it's what I had on hand) and added a little bit of lime juice. Next time I will be adding some diced chicken and maybe tomatoes to make it more of a main dish.

I had never had quinoa before this recipe. I took a chance making it for the first time as I had invited company over. They loved it and took seconds.  I am going to look for another recipe like it that will brighten it up a bit tho. Will make t again in the fall I think.

Great recipe!! Delicious and gluten-free. Could eat this every day. I cooked the onions and garlic longer, so the quinoa had more color. Will try it with corn tortillas, salsa, cheese, avocado, and hot sauce. With or without meat. This will be a staple at our house for sure!

I wasn't expecting to really like this dish as I just started to eat mostly vegan/vegetarian and have never used quinoa in anything before. So happy to say I thought this was delicious! I, too, used only 1 can of black beans and included a half of a can of diced tomatoes. I can definitely see me putting this in a soft taco shell with a little cheese or vegan sour cream, like another review mentioned doing. Thanks for sharing!

This is DELICIOUS. I didn't have any corn but that was okay. I added a couple of things; I added scallions because duh, scallions, and I boiled the beans separately. I put everything (except for the beans) together in my rice cooker and, for lack of a better term, I set it and forget it. When it was done I chopped up some avocado and tossed it with the quinoa and the beans. I also added a packet of sazon for color but the sazon isn't necessary. Color in my food, it's a Latin thing. I can't tolerate rice, this stuff is just perfect. In the morning (like today), I'll scramble an egg or two and mix it in and voila! Breakfast. Yessss.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, so full of flavor and I had all the ingredients in the pantry.  Score!  The recipe doesn't state it but make sure to rinse your quinoa to avoid a soapy taste. This recipe will be in regular rotation in our house.

P.S.  I only added 1 can of beans, but this recipe doesn't make anywhere near 10 servings, between me & my 2 year old we only had a little bit leftover.  Thats how good it was!

This did not have as much flavor as I was hoping for, although I dumped some salsa in with the leftovers nd it was yummy!

Fantastic! Next time I think I will reduce the cilantro as it came out a bit too strong for me.

So I accidentally put too much broth and mine came out a little more soupy than the original recipe. With that being said, this recipe is freaking delicious!! I followed the advice about the beans from other users and I'm glad I did. I also diced up a tomato and threw it in at the beginning of cooking. Came out yummy!!

This recipe does rate 6 stars.  Very good!!!  I cut down the amount of onion to 1/3 onion, used olive oil, fresh black beans and low sodium beef broth.  I omitted the added salt as well.  I have made it twice in the past week as a side dish; has gotten rave reviews!!!!

I have been making this recipe for almost 4 years.  I make it on Sunday's to have for my daily lunch because the quinoa combined with the corn and black beans make it very filling and healthy.  The cilantro combined with cumin and a little bit of cayenne gives it a lot of flavor while the cilantro makes it feel fresh.  It's also a great side dish! Like the others I only used 1 can of black beans, but this recipe is still a 5!

An absolutely perfect dish! Easy, inexpensive, makes a TON, and healthy. I followed this recipe exactly without any changes, and my whole family just loved it. Both my five year old and two year old ate everything that I put on their plate. I can't really think of anything that I would change, but I did read one reviewer that said they would add avocado, which would make this even better...if that is possible. Yum! I just ate this a couple of hours ago, but I am really looking forward to lunch tomorrow at work so I can eat some leftvoers. Thank you for the recipe, 3LIONCUBS! This will be made many, many more times.

Found this recipe when looking for ingredients I had, very easy and great tasting. My husband and 16 year old even complimented the dish. I added a can of rotel.  And only used one can of black beans.  Will make this one again!!!

This was great! I used black beans that I cooked in the pressure cooker with onion, a bay leaf, cumin and a little salt. I didn't have cilantro, but added a couple handfuls of fresh spinach. I did rinse my quinoa before cooking, and browned it for a couple minutes with the spices prior to adding the veggie broth. It turned out great, and my husband loved it too!

This is my go-to recipe when I have no idea who I'm cooking for-- lol! the cumin and quinoa are a superb combination. I like to leave out the corn and add a meat, like chicken or steak. I then use the leftovers for enchilada filling! It's the meal that keeps on giving... Top it off with avocado, fresh salsa, and some pepper jack cheese... everyone will be begging for more :)

P.S. Throw in that random zucchini, tomato, spaghetti squash.... whatever veggies might be left in the bottom of your fridge. They blend awesomely! I usually only use 1 can of beans because I only cook for two... but it's easy to make this a one-pot recipe your entire family will love!

This recipe is perfect as is. Many people said they only used one can of beans? Well that means you took out a lot of flavor and fiber and ended up with a bunch of quinoa. I love typical black beans and rice cajun style so instead of corn try a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis and add a tsp of tumeric, the tumeric makes it taste exactly like the black beans and rice you will get in the south at restaurants and the tomatoes are a must at our house. Very good and healthy, this is now our regular Meatless Monday dinner!

Cooked this the other day. Like others, I added some color: Red peppers while cooking and tomatoes at the end. I also used less beans because I cooked them from dried (so it was only about half or 16 oz). I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. It was so good and tasty, even two picky kids appreciated it. Rave reviews from entire family, and left overs are super tasty three days later. Just the right amount of spice.

I love this.  I have made it several times and it is so....good. I do not use vegetable broth but use chicken instead.  I did not care for the cilantro so I skipped that. I have had this plain as a salad but have also made a tortilla with it. I, then put salsa on it. Sometimes sour cream, sometimes not. Very healthy, very good, very easy and I give it 5 stars.  Thanks for this recipe.

I love this dish! I read the reviews to get some tips. This is what I did differently.... I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil; and, I cut the black beans down to 1 can. I then added 1/2 c. Salsa to it. I've made this using either chicken broth or vegetable broth - it's great either way. I've also used canned corn instead of frozen - that works well too. When it's done, I've sqeezed some fresh lemon or lime juice on top to add to the flavor. 
TIP:  The dish is great fresh but it's even better once it's had a chance to sit for a while. The flavors marry together and mix well!

This is an excellent and healthy recipe! I added a bit of flavour by sauté onion and garlic in the pan first as well as added in some red and yellow peppers! I make a double batch and take it for a nice and easy lunch every day!!

Really good!  I think it'd be good with chicken, too, but for a totally vegetarian recipe, definitely a keeper!  I made it as written, except I used chicken stock instead of vegetable.

I made this to go with a quiche I made the night before. It was awesome. I added the lemon juice as others had suggested and the green chiles. I will make this again and again. It is in my "favorites" list. Thanks for all the tips to make it even better.

Love this recipe. I made some additions as per other reviewers. Can of diced tomatoes  can of green chilies, along with a variety of vegetables. (Peppers, onions, mushrooms). To make it a complete one dish meal I sometimes add chicken. I've made this several times and have passed on to many friends. Absolutely delicious!

It was made exactly as the recipe called. I made it for the only vegan in my family. He enjoyed it and I had a little taste. I thought it made a great one dish meal or as a side. Would eat with a salad. I don't have a picture, but I think the best picture is the one chosen as the main image or avatar. It gives a realistic approach to how it looks in the pan. I will make this recipe again.

This is a great recipe!! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's easy and totally versatile! You can follow the exact recipe (which is great), or you can totally add or substitute different ingredients! I made it last night and added grilled pineapple and green peppers to it and it was a hit!! Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

Just 1 can of beans is plenty in my opinion. Other than that:perfect! We also use it as a base for wraps adding shredded chicken with lettuce and diced tomatoes…..yummy!


For the record I NEVER review no matter how good it is for lack of time but after having my kids begging for this over and over today I had to. Enjoy!

Only thing I changed in the prep process was to use chicken broth. After I garnished with avocado, a bit of cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. It even tastes better the next day! I had a bit of hamburger left over and crumbled and added that when I ate for lunch the next day.

This is great. It makes a great lunch with some blue corn chips! Easy to make and good flavor. I only used one can of black beans and it was just right.

Added a bit of balsamic vinegar and replaced the cumin with oregano and garlic powder, also omitted the corn - it turned out delicious :)

I'm not a very big cook, but I love reading and saving the recipes on here.  This is the first one that I made that I am actually writing a review for, it was great!!  I really like quinoa and have had multiple versions (homemade and restaurants) of it and this is by far my favorite.  The flavor was really so good, though with the sweetness of the corn I would add a little more cayenne.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (for health reasons) so had to saute the garlic (used onion powder since I didn't have an onion) on a lower heat.  I also didn't add any salt, used chicken stock (what I had), added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and a can of chopped artichoke hearts.  Didn't have any fresh cilantro so added some dried parsley.  I am SO glad I doubled the batch, I am going to enjoy this for lunch all week!

This was great! When my other vegetarian meal didn't work out, this was a very quick, tasty save for our dinner. I halved it for my small family, and made it as written except I added a little bit of extra broth halfway through when it looked like it might burn before the quinoa was soft (and mine was done at 15 minutes). I used up a half can of southwestern corn instead of frozen (about 2/3c), and I used some parsley to bulk up the cilantro when I didn't have enough. The corn mix had a little red pepper in it, so I might add some diced red pepper in step one the next time; the color was very nice. It seemed very hot when I first tasted it, but the flavors mellowed after it sat for a couple of hours. I served it with the last of some sour cream and guacamole in flatbreads at room temperature, and it was delish!  This will be a go-to as I keep trying to serve more vegetarian meals. Thanks! UPDATE: the next day, I took about half the leftovers (about 1-1 1/2 c) and mixed them with half a can of black beans, mashed as smoothly as possible, one egg, and breadcrumbs (about 1/2-2/3 c., whatever is needed to reach consistency), and formed the mix into burgers (I got six, but yield will vary). I baked at 365, ten minutes per side, and they were delicious!

Good recipe. Instead of veggie broth, I juice 2-3 limes (3 if they're harder = less juice) put the lime juice in a measuring cup, then fill the rest of the way with water, up to the 1 1/2 cup mark. It makes it taste like Chipotle's lime rice. You're welcome! :D xoxo

One can of black beans was enough. Use less cayenne if you don't like a lot of heat. I used chicken broth, but felt it was a little too much liquid. I like my quinoa dishes moist, but nut mushy.Drizzle of lime as a nice punch.

Loved this. Like everyone always does, I made some modifications:  I only used one can of black beans, and used a can of sweet corn instead of frozen corn. I also I used chicken broth, and olive oil instead of vege oil and vege broth. I cooked the quinoa about 10 minutes longer, because it simply wasn't ready yet. Since my husband refuses meals without meat, I added some shredded chicken as well. Superb!!  I will definitely make this one again.

I'm relatively new to using quinoa, and was surprised this recipe was so good. I served it at a Christmas gathering, specifically trying to come up with a side dish for my vegetarian nephew to enjoy. He liked it, as did all the omnivores. The next day, the leftovers were just as good right out of the refrigerator. One of the other reviewers said that they thought it could be served as a main dish. I don't disagree. I'll be making this again. Thanks, 3LIONCUBS!

I made this for Meatless Monday this week. A lot of recipes are challenging to make since I'm allergic to cow's milk, soy, peanuts, fish and shellfish; so I'm always looking for recipes that are vegetarian. This one was absolutely delicious! I DO have to say that I think it needs to specify one large onion or two medium ones though. And I could have been a bit happier with a bit more corn in it. I made notes in my "keepers" folder, so next time I make it I can be sure to remember that. And, I WILL be making for us again, because Hubs said to make sure I kept the recipe!

This is a great recipe to use when trying out quinoa for the first time. I use the leftovers as a taco filling. Tastes great with cheese and salsa in taco shells! Only thing I change on this one is using one can of beans.

I love quinoa recipes!  It has a ton of protein, so it really is healthy.  I, too, rinsed the quinoa and used one can of beans, added yellow and orange bell pepper and chopped tomato for added nutrition and color, and I also added  a bit of powdered adobo seasoning for a bit of smoky flavor.  You could also use a teaspoon of canned adobo sauce.  But I found that what it really lacked was that pop of acid.  A healthy squeeze of lime juice on the finished dish really helped take it to the next level.  I freeze my quinoa dishes in 1 cup servings in ziplock freezer bags laid flat.  You can grab a frozen bag, smack it on the counter to break it up and zap it in the micro for a quick meal.  Throw in any diced or shredded meat you wish, if you are a carnivore.

Great recipe and so healthy. Definitely a keeper. I did change the beans though since I prefer the taste of white beans and they have more potassium.

A healthy, delicious way to use pantry (and freezer) staples and dinner is ready in a flash.  Next time I will add red peppers to saute with the onions and garlic - and there WILL BE a next time!  Yum!

I'm not quite sure what I did right, but mine turned out pretty watery.  It had really good flavor...but texture-wise, it was pretty odd.  I made it for just myself...but I'm not sure that I would've wanted to serve it had I had any guests.  I may try it again if I feel like playing around with it.

Thank you for introducing me to quinoa! The package said that it was pre-rinsed, so I didn't rinse. I didn't soak either. I subbed chicken broth, doubled the cilantro, halved the beans. So good! The texture seemed right (although I have no prior experience) soft but not soggy. Add a spoonful of salsa on top and it's perfect!

Great!  I followed the recipe exactly for the first time, but I'm already planning what I can add to it to make it even better. I found it had a perfect little kick, not too spicy but lots of flavor. This is definitely a meal I'd make again!

This dish was just okay.  Nothing spectacular about it and it was kind of bland.  My family ate this as a main dish with roasted cubed sweet potatoes and a side salad.  I ended up mixing the sweet potatoes in to the quinoa, which helped a bit.  Overall, I may consider this as a side dish but definitely not a main dish that I would repeat again.

Didn't have any cumin (how did that happen!?), but cut the cayenne and substituted 1.5 tsp creole seasoning - 'twas yummy! I also only used 1 can of black beans, which allowed the quinoa taste to come through.

Delicious! Great recipe.  I made a batch for my co-workers to taste and they loved it!  

While it's best to rinse all grains before cooking, pre-washing is especially advisable for quinoa in order to remove the bitter white coating on its outer hull that sometimes remains after processing. To do so, simply run cold water over quinoa in fine-meshed strainer, gently rubbing the seeds with your fingers. (Avoid soaking quinoa, however, as the bitter coating can leach into the grain.) After rinsing, place one cup of quinoa and two cups of water in a covered pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 15 – 20 minutes, until the grains become translucent and the germ appears as a thin white ring around each grain. Fluff with a fork.

I usually cook extra quinoa and keep in the refrigerator for up to one week.  Just scoop out what you need for each recipe.  It's delicious cold, hot, in soups, wrap sandwiches, etc. 

Quinoa has the highest protein content of any grain.  It contains all nine essential amino acids, making it a complete protein.  With that in mind, it makes a good substitute for meat and is a less expensive, healthier choice.

So good!! Try stuffing it a bell pepper, sprinkling a little cheese on top and baking! Yum! I also used just a tiny bit of Spanish Smoked paprika!

This recipe is great because it is so versatile!  I change it up some days and add chopped chicken and make it the main dish. Other days I use it as a side but add fresh chopped tomatoes, asparagus, or other veggies I have on hand. One day my daughter ate it cold and topped it with salsa. So many options!

This recipe is great! But it definitely does not make 10 servings (maybe for 10 tiny sides). I increased the amount of quinoa and only added 1 can of beans. Turned out WONDERFULLY, and everyone absolutely loved it! The next time I make it, I think I'll set aside a small portion of the sauteed onion to add when the cilantro is added for a little extra umph. Definitely my new go to recipe!

I loved this recipe, but next time will probably use less cumin & cayenne pepper. A bit too spicy for my taste. Also used 1 can of beans like the others suggested. Thew some teriyaki chicken in there as well !

Great recipe! So flavourful. Tastes even better after one or two days. Made it with baked chicken breast,  went great together! On the third day for leftovers I put some feta cheese crumbles and it was so yummy!

I love this recipe! I add 1 Tbsp of Cumin and 1 tsp of cayenne. I like just a little more flavor than this recipe achieves for me. And I only use approx a can of black beans (although I use soaked dried beans versus canned). A great, frugal, fall recipe.

This was excellent! I read a lot of the reviews which said to use only one can of black beans, so when I started this up, I opened only one can but had the second on hand just in case. After adding the first can of beans, I could see why some people were saying that adding the second would be too much. BUT! I had faith in the recipe and decided to add the second can anyway. Definitely worth it! The beans and quinoa balanced out perfectly. 

My husband wouldn't stop raving about it! I will definitely be making this recipe again. And again. And again.

I really liked this recipe the first time I made it, as is, but I thought it needed a little bit more "pop." The second time I made it, I added a touch more garlic, added coriander, and added a bit of onion powder. I found it to be a better stand-alone dish if you're generous with the seasoning.

I made this on Friday afternoon, put it in the cooler and my family of 5 took it camping to eat for lunch on Saturday. It wasn't quite enough, no way is it 10 servings if you're eating it as a meal like we did. But it traveled well. The seasoning wasn't all that I'd hoped but I will make it again and experiment a little. The only change I made to this recipe was I used a can of corn instead of the frozen corn as that is what I had.

Just starting to get in to cooking and this was a fun easy recipe for me to try.
It makes quite a bit, so you'll have leftovers for a few days, it's filling and extremely healthy.
The recipe is forgiving, definitely hard to mess up.
I added tomatoes and lemon and lime juice.
Only use 1 can of beans!!
Two would be way too many.

Use just 1 can of black beans.  Dried basil worked well in place of cilantro - just sprinkle a couple of teaspoons into the recipe.

The perfect recipe. Healthy, easy, and delicious. I like to double it since it is just as easy and it reheats well. Using fresh cilantro is a must-- I've made it before with dried cilantro since I didn't have any fresh on hand and it was still good, but the fresh cilantro makes it really stand out. Like other reviews have noted, 1 can of beans is enough for the recipe as written.

OMG!!! This was DELISH!!!  My husband LOVED it!!  I am going to add this dish my staple list.  I did use only one can of black beans and 1 3/4 of quinoa (added an extra cup of quinoa and of course more broth to boil).  Over all AMAZING!!!

This is absolutely going to be a staple at my house!  Maybe I simmered it too fast, but I ended up needing almost a cup more broth than the recipe called for.  I also tossed in some fresh mushrooms at the same time as the corn, and it added an earthiness that I really liked.

Turned out good, wasn't bland like some quinoa recipes can be.  Nice side dish for anything with southwestern/mexican flavors.

WOW! So light and versatile! Had my doubts of it turning out because I never use exact measurements but estimating worked great for this recipe. I even used water instead of vegetable stock and it turned out delicious!

Amazing recipe! I added 2 strips of crumbled bacon and quartered 20 grape tomatoes and added them at the very end and mixed in.  I took the dish to a cook out and EVERYONE wanted the recipe.  Is good warm or cold.  Such a winner!!!

I've made quinoa before & my husband politely asked me not to do so again.  With this recipe everyone loved it!  Not a single spec left in the pan. I did add one diced roma tomato & a few olives just to use them up.  Delicious!!!

Wow! This was amazing. I added chicken and it was SO good. I was feeding an 8 year old so did back off a little on the cayenne and he loved it. I was amazed at how the corn meshed this recipe. I will definitely share and make this again. YUM!

So yummy and so easy to make! I have to admit, I was terrified of trying to cook quinoa for the first time... I thought it would be difficult and time consuming, but I'm surprised at how easy it actually was! I read through some of the comments before attempting and made only two changes. I added red pepper in with the onions (gave it good color and flavor!), and only used one can of black beans. Advice to new cookers (like me!), just because it says let it simmer for 20 minutes does not give you the excuse to not check in on it! I think mine would have been done after 12-15 minutes, and at 17 mins some of the onion, pepper, and quinoa were a bit burnt on the bottom. Oops! Now I know for next time, and there will most certainly be a next time. Gave this recipe to a coworker and she's excited to try it this weekend!

I needed a recipe using quinoa for lunch that my sister would eat because she is practically vegan now. I made this for lunch and all 4 kids as well as 3 of us sisters had it and loved it.  I didn't have black beans but used 1 can kidney beans and it was just fine.  Will be trying again with black beans soon however.   Also added zucchini and fresh grape tomato's.  It was great warm or cold.  Happy to have found a new recipe that's worth keeping.

I've made this several times and love it! I wonder if the people who say this is bland or mushy are doing it right?!
I make it for breakfast for the entire week, and because I want it to be hearty (and because they are nature's nearly most perfect food) I do add two cans of beans. I've also started to add a drained can of rotel for color and a more complex flavor. Perfect start to the day and absolutely delicious! Thank you so much 3lioncubs!

Used this recipe for my first trial of quinoa... it was fabulous!  The only thing I had to change was the amount of vegetable broth... I needed a little less than double the recommended amount...

The recipe as listed is good, but a tad too bland for me.  However, it's a Fabulous base recipe to doctor to one's liking.  I added bell peppers & extra spices.  It's fantastic with chicken ( that I marinated in lime juice, chili powder, cayenne, and dash of Worcestershire &  chipotle Tabasco).
It works well as main dish, side dish, served hot or cold.  highly recommend.  great on top of salad with diced tomato & avocado, too.   versatile & delicious.

One of my favorite meals! I always add some red pepper for color and some more flavor. It is also great topped with cheese and a small amount of sour cream... And tapatio sauce if you like it spicy.

Made it tonight, loved it. Good flavor and texture, and healthy. I only used 1 can of black beans and it came out perfect. I also used the full can of vegetable broth (just a little over 1.5 cups). Paired well with pork tenderloin.

This was super tasty! I added 1 cup of quinoa instead of 3/4. I also didn't have cilantro so I used a combo of red, green and yellow peppers. It was still yummy!!!

Delicious and filling! It wasn't as big of a job as I thought it would have been at first, also. 

Changed: Definitely one can of beans is plenty. I squeezed some lime juice into it for a little zip, and added some mexican blend cheese on top in the bowl. I also skipped the cilantro.

My first time eating quinoa and what a dish! I will definitely be making this again.

Very good, but I took off a star because I had to add extra cumin and cayenne. Didn't add any extra salt because of the vegetable broth. I also took about 5 minutes off the cooking time. Just keep an eye on it when it gets close to 20 minutes.

This was good.  I added chicken and squash and it made a meal for my meat loving family.  I like the fact that you can use the basic recipe and switch it up to meet your needs.  Will make again!

This is a great recipe either as a side dish or a light meal (all by itself).  I add sliced red pepper when the onion is almost done and I use a small can of corn instead of the frozen.  This has become a favorite in our house.

WOW, yum yum yum!!  So, I hate making alterations to recipes before I've even tried them, but for this one I did just from reading others' comments and suggestions.  I cut up one red bell pepper and cooked it along with the onions and garlic.  Also, I used chicken broth.  When I began cooking the quinoa and had set it to simmer, I think I had it too low so the quinoa wasn't cooking, so I added about 1/2 cup more chicken broth, turned up the temp to low-medium, and cooked another 12 minutes.  After that, it was perfect!  When I "stirred" the quinoa, I actually kind of folded it over on itself to prevent it from becoming mushy and it worked great!  Added the corn, black beans and fresh cilantro and then squeezed juice of one lime.  Seriously, delicious!  I love how the sweetness of the corn goes well with the spice!  I will be making this over and over again!

This meal was a great main course meatless meal. My whole family ate it with no complaint.... with little ones, that is quite the feat. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable, added red pepper with the onions, soaked the quinoa while I prepared the onions & peppers & then toasted it with the red peppers & onions before adding the broth. I doubled the meal & it served 6 people as a main course, with some leftovers. I also used all 4 cans of black beans & thought it was perfect

Good recipe, only 2 minor chages, as other reviews have said, used only 1 can of black beans, 2 cans would be way too much. Also used chicken stock instead of vegetable.
Had it as a side dish with hamburgers and was full afterward.
It's good cold as well. I brought my leftovers for lunch anf wrapped the filling in tortillas.

This was great.  I made it last minute as an additional side dish because we had more for dinner than I expected.  This receipe is great as written, but versitile enough that you can add/swap whatever you like.  Personally, I wouldn't change anything.  I did use chicken broth for the veggie broth because that's all I had, and used one can of black beans (that's all I had on hand).  Next time I will definately use two cans of beans just because we enjoy them.  Thanks for the great receipe.

This recipe deserves more than five stars, for how great and versatile this quinoa dish is! It's a great spin off of the traditional rice and beans dish and goes great with most chicken dishes you can think of. The dish is somewhat bland (great for people who don't like spice, but if your like my family we like flavor but without burning our mouths), we remedied this by adding a touch more garlic and cilantro then called for and once paired with a flavorful chicken recipe is was great comfort food. The great thing about this comfort food is that people on a low carb diet, diabetic, or simply wanting to eat healthy (but tasty food) adults, teens, or children its a one stop wonder.

Loved it! We eat a lot of quinoa and I needed a new recipe to change things up. I used chicken broth (it was all I had) and only one can of beans (I think two would be overkill). Served it with BBQ chicken. Yum!

Loved this recipe! I slightly toasted the quinoa with the onion and garlic before adding the vegetable broth. This really brings out the flavor! I also added grilled chicken at the end. This meal is very low fat, nutritious, and tasty!

I had never used quinoa before but really wanted to try it.  This recipe is fabulous!  Wonderful flavor and very filling.  I have made it with one can of beans and two as the recipe calls for.  Either way they are both delicious.  I add fresh tomato and avacado with shredded cheese and fat free sour cream and voila you have a one dish meal.  I will make this one for years to come.

Surprisingly good! I had told my husband not to add the cayenne for the kids (7 & 3), but he forgot. Good news--the kids liked it! They said it was spicy, but they just kept eating it asking for more water. Definitely a keeper. (Plus it was REALLY simple!)

I've had this twice now.  The second time, it tasted bland to me and I couldn't figure out why.  Then I finally remembered that the first time I had it, I added some fresh squeezed lime and put a big dollup of "Greek Gods" delicious greek yogurt on top.  That added just the right amount of extra flavour!  Yummy and healthy!

This a staple at my house. I always at least double it so I have left overs. Canned corn tossed in with the beans at the end works just as well as frozen. I tend to add a bit extra cayenne and rarely add the cilantro(because I rarely have it on hand). Kids LOVE it. Great as a side with most chicken dishes or hamburgers. I like it as a main with a salad. Definitely a keeper!

This was such a great recipe! I like to tweak recipes to my liking, so this is what I did: First, I washed and soaked my quinoa for an hour, drained and set aside. I fried my onions until they were just getting soft, then threw in my chopped garlic to fry. (I put the garlic in after so it didn't burn.) I also chopped up half a jalapeno pepper really tiny (about the same size chunks as I had the garlic) and fried that as well. I added my quinoa to the mixture and fried it for a little while to get all the flavors melding together. I then added in water (in place of vegetable broth) and one chicken bouillon cube. I added in my cumin,cayenne (just a touch of cayenne because I already had jalapenos for heat - I didn't add any pepper), and salt (for those who are bad at estimating salt, one level teaspoon is what I used). Then I stirred, covered, turned down the head and let it simmer for 15 minutes. I then added half a can of black beans and half a can of corn (I like equal parts of beans, corn, and quinoa on my spoon). Stirred and let it simmer for another 5-10. And last but not least, I chopped up my cilantro and mixed that into the dish. TA-DA! Deliciousness in my mouth!

First time cooking with Quinoa - it was easier and more delicious than I expected! Fresh, light and yet it fills you up. The Quinoa was fully cooked after 10 minutes, and I used 1 can of black beans and 2 cups of corn. Can't wait to make this again.

I really liked this a lot. I added a can of green chilis and next time I'll add more corn and probably some diced red and/or yellow peppers. I also used chicken broth because I didn't hav vegetable broth. I will definitely make this again and again...

My family and I really loved this. Btw, two cans of rinsed black beans is not overkill in my opinion. We've never had Quinoa  it and found it was very tasty. This is recipe is exactly how I fix my black beans except I add the juice from 1/2 a lime. I never thought to add quinoa or rice. Left overs are actually better after the flavors blend and like the other folks I do enjoy it cold.

This recipe is great, I made a couple of minor changes, just used one can of black beans and upped the corn to a full can, but other than that followed the recipe and was surprised by how flavorfull the dish turned out.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Pass this recipe around immediately, it's a keeper! I served this as a main dish for 7 people, we needed 2 cans of beans for sure. I have 2 picky eaters, and both had seconds. I would love to serve it with a splash of my sister's fresh salsa on top.Healthy and yummy is a great combination for my family. I would love to try this as a cold dish during the summer with all the great garden vegetables.

Love Love Love... I even made it for super bowl party and the kids went for it. I didn't make that much thinking it would just be for the adults, but surprise - not much left over.

This is the best tasting vegan meal I have made.  I am just 1 month in to my vegan journey. However, if any one tells you vegan food is bland.  Make this for them and I promise they will change their mind.  Great recipe.

This is a great meal in itself and was my first time making quinoa. I doubled the quinoa and soaked it in water for about 10-15 min because i prefer the quinoa soft. Sauteed crushed garlic cloves in the oil until they turned brown and discarded them before i added the onions.  Added a half a cup of diced mushrooms and a whole red bell pepper diced to the onions and sauteed for another 5-7 min and added a little salt.  Added the quinoa and about 3 and half cups of chicken stock along with the cumin and some paprika. Brought it to a boil and simmered for 20 min.  I let it cool before I added a can of corn, can of black beans, squirt of lemon and some fresh cilantro.

So good!! But you definitely only need one can of black beans.
The second time I made it, I topped it with homemade guacamole. Amazing.

Fabulous! I added more cayenne pepper since we like spicier foods and did not add the cilantro (not a big fan of it).

I read the negative reviews first and I must say that the 5 stars is accurate. If you over cook quinoa it will be mushy. Mine was perfect. good heat, filling and my 13 yr old raved about it as a first time taste. will be making this again and will do variations as it is a basic recipe. Yum!!!!

Easy, fast, delicious, economical, healthy and nutritious, kids ate it.  I couldn't ask for more in a recipe.  I did add a 14.5oz can of undrained diced tomatoes in at the end and simmered for 5 minutes.  Sprinkled with cheddar once served.  Next time I'll double the recipe as this made enough for 2 adults and 2 kids for one dinner, and I want leftovers next time!

Served for our weekly Meatless Monday dinner, this was better than I expected. Quite flavorful for just a few ingredients, plus it was very filling.  It was also a hit with my DH, who is a self-professed black bean hater! I used a 5.46 oz bag of pre-washed roasted garlic quinoa (which was actually 3/4 c...score!) I used only 1 can of cumin & chili-spiced black beans, which jazzed up the flavor factor. I still added 1/2 tsp of cumin since I like it. I only used 1/8 tsp cayenne and still, my 4 year-old DD found it too spicy. Sadly, no fresh cilantro tonight, so I had to sub the dried stuff, but it was fine in a pinch. I highly recommend topping your portion with diced (or sliced) avocado....holy delicious! I'm SO looking forward to cold leftovers for lunch tomorrow! This will most definitely remain on the Meatless Monday rotation. Thanks for an excellent, healthy dinner!

Really yummy, we used this as filling for a tortilla shell and ate it like a taco. I used 3/4 cup white wine and 3/4 cup broth since I had some open wine to use, will make this again!

Excellent! I made some substitutions, however. Used olive oil, it's healthier. Also you can use 1 whole fresh diced tomatoe instead of the corn for a fresh salad taste, add it at the end. This dish is definitely a perfect side dish and so much healthier than rice or pasta.

Made this for the first time this morning...fabulous.  I could eat 3 servings in one sitting.  The flavor is rather mild, so I added a bit more salt (like, a half tsp), but I anticipate that after it sits for a day the flavors will meld and be move developed.
Here's hoping it lasts that long...  :)

This is an easy recipe! Tasty, filling, and wholesome. I made the following changes: Chicken broth instead of vegetable, 1 can black beans instead of 2, and omitted cayenne pepper because I can't handle spice very well. Be sure to rinse the quinoa to avoid bitterness. The rest is just chop, add to pot, boil, simmer, and serve!

What a great recipe for someone new to quinoa!  I left out 1 can of beans and still had plenty (as a main dish) for 2 adults and 1 child.  This is such a flexible recipe and I can't wait to make it again.

I like this recipe, just made it ten minutes ago! It was my first time and I didn't have black beans on hand, so I used Chili Beans instead, and used dried cilantro for fresh. Fresh would've definetely been better, and the quinoa also has a slight bitter taste, I would reccomend to wash it before you cook it. Next time I'll add tomatoes with lemon juice and real black beans, because I didn't get the fresh flavors but instead got a southern, American spice chili taste. (Chili beans!) but overall, yum. I'm glad it's so healthy and maybe it'll be better cold.

This is a really good recipe.  I did add more of the spices this time since the first time I made it I thought it was a bit bland.  Fresh cilantro is the key to this recipe so if you don't have any on hand I would hold off until you can take a trip to the grocery store.

This was very good!!! I will definitely make again! I used green onions instead of regular, because that is what I had. I also used only 1 can of beans. Flavor and texture was delicious! I might add a little more spice next time because I like the extra kick- but as is, fantastic recipe! I also mixed one TBSP of lowfat sourcream to my personal serving. Yum!

Yum! I added one tomato, lemon juice from one lemon, zucchini, red pepper and when I serve it (hot or cold - both are delish) I slice some fresh avocado into it. I used more cumin and cayenne pepper. I also just used one cup of black beans, it was enough. It was really good :)

The recipe is pretty good, I felt like something was off so I added sour cream and it made the meal.  After having some sour cream as a dipping sauce it was spectacular.  I highly recommend this recipe but with some sour cream on the side!

I had never eaten quinoa (much less pronounced it correctly!) before trying this recipe. I made it according to recipe (except used dried minced onion) when a vegan friend was coming over. DELICIOUS! Am trying to eat healthier, so this is going to be one of my go-to recipes!  Salsa is great on it, too.

I can't have wheat or rice, so I was happy to find this recipe using quinoa, which I love. It was very easy to make and went well with slow-cooked pernil pork and braised collard greens!

This is fantastic!  Great added spice from the cayenne.  Being that I am on a diet, I weighed the total recipe once I made it and divided by 10.  According to my calc, 1 serving is 4.32 oz., which is a nice sized side dish.  Double that and you've got a 300 calorie lunch!

Satisfying and healthy!  Instead of 2 cans of black beans, I used only one can and added one can of drained rotel.  I had enough for 4 main course large lunch portions, which were served cold. The salad was equally as good cold as it was warm.

YUM!!  I added chili powder for more spice and some diced tomato and the end.  Next time I think I will add some diced chili pepper to kick it up a notch.

Vegetarian, nut-free, gluten free, and casein free!!!!  This recipe is really good warm or cold, and is a great filling or topping for anything Mexican.  Keeps well for several days in the fridge too.  Word to the wise, do NOT substitute beef broth!  It's gross!  Chicken broth was okay, but the vegetable broth really is the best.

This is a regular favorite at our house.  My only changes:  use one can of black beans instead of two, one can of veggie broth works perfectly, and I double the cilantro and garlic, because we love both.  We eat this hot and cold.  When we eat it as a left-over, we use it as a dip with blue corn chips.  YUM!

Soo good! Very simple and fresh, I did make some changes though... I prepared the quinoa and let it cool, then I mixed it with the veg. I also added an anaheim pepper and some lime zest. I kept the veggies raw and used sweet corn. This is by far the best quinoa I've made :)

I'm experimenting with healthy cooking, and this was very good as a side dish to pork tenderloin (although it would also be a good light main dish).  I had never cooked quinoa before, but it was quite easy.  I rinsed it before cooking.  I also used about 3/4 of a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles, and I really liked the addition of tomatoes.  I will enjoy having the leftovers for lunch!

This was every bit as good as I hoped it would be (maybe even better).  Definitely worth all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, and this is a great side dish, and could totally work for a main dish, taco filler, whatever else you could dream up, etc.  Very tasty and I will be making this again soon!

Very tasty and easy to make! You could use other veggies in there as well that would be good, red or green peppers for example, maybe cherry or grape tomatoes.

This was fantastic.  We made tacos out of the mixture, and added avocado, cheese and sour cream.  But it is so good on its own!  The only thing we really changed was adding a bunch of lime juice.

My husband and I both loved this recipe and can't wait to have it again. I didn't have vegetable broth so used chicken broth. The next day after reheating the leftovers for lunch I added a dollop of Lite Sour Cream & a little grated Cheddar cheese on top, as someone suggested, and it was amazing! Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm always looking for healthy ways to remake my favorite recipes. Since I love black beans and rice, I decided to give this a try. I used chicken broth, as that's what I had on hand, and I only used one can of beans. Overall I think this was a great first attempt, but that it was a bit soggy. Next time I will try cooking the quinoa, broth, and seasoning in one pot and the onions, garlic, corn, and beans in a separate one, then combining once the quinoa is cooked to the proper texture. I served this with cheddar and sour cream.

Cooked it exactly as written.  Served it with sour cream and shredded cheddar.  It just seemed to be missing something so I added a can of rotel.  Maybe it will be better tomorrow in a tortilla.  I'll try and kick it up a notch with some more spices, but I was disappointed overall.

It was our first quinoa and everyone loved it. I used green onions from my garden, chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, and a red pepper in place of the second can of black beans. Even my 6-year-old ate it without complaint!

Loved it! Our son who isn't very experimental with his food choices dished himself seconds! However, I used chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth; I think that that added a nice flavor.

Loved it, even my twins girls did. I messed up somehow because I read in a past review I should rinse and soak, but then I read on the quinoa bag it was already rinsed and air dried to remove the bitterness so whatever I did wrong made it sort of a soup texture it didn't dry up so we had it as a soup. Also next time I would't put so much cumin in it...otherwise DELICIOUS ....LOVED IT

This was my first time cooking quinoa.  I mostly followed the recipe as written with the following changes:  1 can black beans (that's all i had) and i was out of cayenne pepper so i added a mix of chilli pepper and paprika.  My husband and i ate and enjoyed.  This was a lot for two people, though and with some leftovers I made wraps.  I took some of this quinoa mix and added left over diced chicken (about 3/4 of a grilled boneless, skinless....it had been grilled with just oil, salt and pepper) and salsa.  Heated the entire mix and put it in a wrap.  We topped with guacomole and it was delicious. I don't have any measurements, just eyed it to out to our tastes.

This was AMAZING!  I left out the additional salt and pepper; it really didn't need it.  We put these in tortillas with guacamole, and the non-vegans added cheese.  It was so delicious!  Even my husband, who doesn't love black beans, loved it!

Very good and easy recipes.  I had a lentil/quinoa mixture I used and good it in the vege broth separately. Then I sauteed the onions, garlic together with canola oil.  Once lightly browned I add the frozen corn and cooked it with the onion mixture. Added the black beans to the onion mixture; heated through then added the cooked, fluffed, quinoa/lentil mixture then add the cilantro.  Very good and healthy. High protein and fiber.

Quinoa is my new favorite food, so I wanted to try this recipe for a main dish.  I really liked it.  I couldn't find my cumin, but I added a tiny bit of finely diced jalapeno with the onion and garlic for a bit of heat.  You could add a lot of things to this.  I will definitely make this again, but may add some diced zucchini and green pepper to the vegetables when I saute them, just for a change.  But it's very, very good as written.

I love it! Everyone I've made it for has loved it! This is a great recipe for quinoa and is extremely healthy. I would suggest reducing the amount of black beans if you make this exactly as printed, it will NOT look like the picture. The ratio of black beans is off. I think it's perfect with half the amount printed. This recipe is great because it's very forgiving if the ingredients aren't "just right" and it allows the cook to change it up easily to suit their taste. I love adding extra garlic (triple the amount) and quality paprika.

VERY tasty and healthy :)  I followed the ingredient proportions as directed and did not find the beans to overpower the dish.  The spice level was just right, too.  Just a tiny kick.  I used chicken broth in place of vegetable broth. I also sliced 2 chicken sausages, sauteed them and added them into the cooking quinoa during the last 10 minutes or so. Yum, yum.  A new go to recipe.

This is excellent. We add a sliced avocado to the top when we serve and it takes it to the next level.

I love this recipe! Its great for the warm summer months. I have made some changes.... I use 1/2 tsp cumin as opposed to 1tsp. and I only use a few shakes of cayenne. I use only one can of beans ( otherwise its like a black bean salad with some quinoa. I also use a whole box of frozen corn which probably equals 2 cups. I also just use chicken broth as I am not a vegetarian.    I have also added a couple extras to jazz it up a little for my daughter who didnt love it as much as I did..... I cut up an avacado add some  reduced fat feta and squeze some lime juice over it!!! ( I also ommit the cilantro in her portion since she is not a fan)  delicious- enjoy!!

The calories are incorrect.  There are 364 calories in one serving - not 153.  That being said, it is a very good recipe.  I did cut back to 1 can of beans and didn't miss them.  Enjoyed.

This recipe was just okay. I expected it to taste a lot better based on the reviews. I'd leave out the corn for sure next time and maybe even make this with diff veggies like bell peppers and asparagus or broccoli. It was just missing flavor....i dont know exactly what more it needed....

This is my first attempt on quinoa and it turned out great, my husband who is vegan love it, and would eat it at least once or twice a week. I cook my own black beans as he does not like the canned. I also added more cayenne. Now I am going to try the black quinoa for breakfast!

This dish was delicious! I had never tried quinoa before and was happily surprised. One thing though, I think that the nutritional information is based on this dish without the black beans, so it is a bit off.

The quinoa is full of flavour and simple to make. The recipe could use more vegetables to add colour. I added sun dried tomatoes to mine.

This recipe is great. I like it both hot and cold. I've made it a couple of times to take to work for lunch. I add lettuce and spinach to make a salad. It's so flavorful, no salad dressing is necessary.

Delicious, easy, and healthy. We loved it served hot with dinner, and then I ate leftovers cold for lunch that week.  Can't decide whether I like it better hot or cold - I love it both ways! I did use only one can of black beans, and that was enough for me...

This was a good recipe.  I think it would have received better reviews from my family if I had made this with chicken.  We put everything in tortillas with Colby-Jack cheese and they were good.  It just tasted like it needed something else to me.  I think using this as a side for taco night with chicken, salsa, and lime would make this dish outstanding.

I used farro; so after the broth was used up I added a Saranac Caramel Porter beer (similar to how you would make a risotto) it's great! I also used light and dark kidney beans as well. Will definitely make this again!

This is fantastic!! It's practically addicting. It has just the right amount of spices and I love the corn in it. I've brought it to potlucks several times, and people always comment on how good it is. I've even been asked for the recipe a couple of times. Plus I love quinoa and am always looking for ways to use it. Thanks for posting such a great recipe!

Really great, really healthy and super easy to whip up.   I had THREE helpings when I was just supposed to test it out!!    I added some chopped tomato to lighten up the density of the dish and it was a wonderful contrast.   You could really add whatever you want or just leave it as is.

this recipe is delicious! I just made it literally 5 minutes ago! I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth, and I only had one can on black beans so I added a can of pinto beans. For me, personally, there are too many beans and corn. I most likely will make this again but tweak the recipe just a little. more quinoa and less everything else. DELICIOUS!

This dish is so fantastic.  It's flavorful yet not over powering.  Its really easy to make.  I'm an onion-lover so I added more but other than that, I followed the recipe as listed.  I will certainly make this dish again.

I thought this was a great recipe. Normally, I don't like the weird aftertaste of quinoa, but it was not even slightly detectable in this dish. I couldn't give it 5 stars because it was too spicy for my kids. I thought 1/4 tsp. wouldn't make it spicy, but it definitely was spicy. Next time I'll just leave it out.

I'm pregnant and working and I've been looking for something nutritious that I can make on the weekend and take throughout the week for my lunches. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. This is delicious and I love how healthy it is. I recommend only using one can of beans. After making it originally, I added an additional cup of quinoa cooked in just water because the beans were too overpowering. Also, I didn't have the spices listed so I've been adding sriracha to taste. For anyone interested in tampering a bit and trying something new, I highly recommend adding avocado, salsa, and some pepper jack cheese and using it as a dip for chips. Amazing!

This was alright - a good starting place I think. Perhaps some tomatoes or additional spices would give the flavor a bit more depth.

I give it five stars with some very simple additions.
I rinsed and then soaked the quinoa for 10 min. Meanwhile, I sauted the onion until translucent and then added the garlic until both were lightly browned. Because my family likes a little Xtra heat, I doubled the cayenne pepper and added a can of medium Rotel tomatoes with chilis. I also used a can of drained and rinsed corn rather than frozen.
We really liked it and will be making regularly. May add some blackened chicken.

This was very good.  I will certainly make it again!  It was spicier than I thought with the cayenne and onions and garlic.  Very filling and made for a good meal.  I had already cooked quinoa earlier today so I added some veg stock and followed all the other instructions.

This was delish.  Did not have black beans so used pinto beans.  Will try black beans next time.  Increased the quinoa to 1 cup and used chicken broth.  Increased cumin 1/2 tsp. because of increase in quinoa also I really like cumin.  Reduced cayenne by half.  This is a keeper.

This was excellent and my husband loved it,too. I used chicken broth and olive oil as some suggested. The texture is wonderful and the fresh cilantro is a must. I served it with meat and bean burritos. I soooo appreciate the suggestions from other cooks. Thanks!

This was soooo yummy.  I never had quinoa before this dish and everyone loved it, even the kiddies!  I did rinse the quinoa as some suggested by putting a paper towel in the bottom of my colander and added a can of tomatoes with green chillis.  I also stuck to 1 can of beans.  Everything else was exactly from the recipe.  My hubby wanted a little spicier so he added a little salsa from the jar to his plate and that did the trick.

I made this as directed and added a chopped fresh tomato to enhance the flavor. I also used only a half a can of black beans, and added Tyson fajita seasoned grilled chicken (frozen section) to make it a full meal.  Also made some cheese quesadillas with whole wheat tortillas.  It made for a hearty, enjoyable meal with plenty of leftovers for tomorrow:)

I made this using the exact ingredients.  The quinoa does come out a bit mushy but it got a bit drier the next day.  I think it tastes really delicious and will definitely make this again.

A delicious recipe, but it should be noted that the calorie count here is way off. It should be somewhere closer to 150-170 calorie per serving. 76 is incorrect and very misleading.

I've eaten quinoa before and wasn't impressed because it just didn't add much.  This recipe, however has all the depth and flavor you could ask for in a delicious and very nutritious dish.  YUM.  Oh, and I only added one can of black beans.  I felt that two would be overly mushy for my taste.

This is probably a 4.5 for me, but since it turned out a lot better than I thought it would! I've been wanting to eat more quinoa because it is supposed to be so healthy, but I haven't had such positive experiences with it in the past. I'm glad I stumbled upon this easy and delicious recipe for quinoa.

I thought it was excellent! Even better as leftovers. I might try adding tomatoes next time for a little extra kick.

This was very simple and very good.  This recipe was the first one from this website that I did exactly as written.  I'm a complete wimp when it comes to hot/picante so I probably will lessen the cayenne to 1/8t.  I tasted it before giving to my toddlers and then knowing that it would be too hot for them I put some sour cream in it and it toned down the heat and was quite yummy.  This might be my new favorite quinoa recipe.

excellent...I added cooked sausage...b/c my kids five, under 8 try things very quickly and enjoy them if there is bacon or sausage in them.  This was a hit two had seconds and all said that they wanted me to make it again.  We had it with a large garden salad.

Very very good. and very very easy. i doubled the amount of quinoa (wanted to finish it up) and used 15 oz of beans but doubled the rest of the things. i didn't have corn but i didn't miss. i thought this was really tasty - added a little sour cream and ate it on its own. could see putting this in a wrap with some meat, adding some fresh red onion and tomato and serving cold...many possibilities!

I made this yesterday and it was AMAZING! I tweaked it a bit to my liking. I used Swanson's 100% Fat Free 33% Less Sodium Chicken Broth instead of vegetable broth, substituted fresh asparagus for corn, made my own black beans and squeezed a bit of lemon juice on top. The aroma in the house was to die for. It was delicious and I look forward to eating some more for lunch today.

I was hesitant to try this recipe after my first experience with quinoa was a flop, but I'm so glad I gave it another try! I did only use one can of black beans, I did not have any cilantro, and I added a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles. It is delicious and has just the right kick! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Very hearty and healthy dish, but seemed like it was "missing something".  Added a small can of diced green chilies to balance out the nutty/salty flavor, totally did the trick!

Excellent recipe! Quick, easy to make, vegan, and very healthy, this has everything I was looking for in a lunch or dinner recipe.  I made this for dinner last night and brought it for lunch today, served cold, and it was great both ways.  I might add a little more cayenne pepper and cumin next time to make this a little spicier.

Delicious! From now on, this is going to be my go-to mexican side dish. The spice level was perfect for my husband and I, but next time I will cut the cayenne in half, so that my kids will eat it. I might also try and add a faux meat product, like the Quorn chicken that one reviewer suggested.

This was the first time i made Quinoa. This recipe was awesome! The only change i made was adding red pepper to the onion/garlic, and using heaping spoons of the spices it called for. definately in the rotation!

I only used 1 can of black beans which was more than enough.  Next time I think I'll use a little less cumin also as it was really strong for me.  Overall, super tasty, especially the second day!

Very suttle flavors to this recipe. I modified it a bit for fun. First I recommend soaking the quinoa for 30 minutes or more to reduce bitterness. I added kale this time I cooked it to make it a nutritional powerhouse and even the picky kids ate it! My husband added some "Voodoo sauce" to make it extra scipy. Next time I think I'll try switching out the corn with some red or yellow bell pepper and add some summer squash or zucchini instead. Great core recipe to be eaten as is or with substitution! A++ thanks!

Very good.  Based on other reviews, added less black beans and a red bell pepper and that was just fine.  Squirted some lemon juice on at the end. Next time will add some cayenne pepper or some spices for an additional kick.  Watch that you don't over-do the broth or over-cook - it can easily get mushy.

I made this when we had company who are vegan, with a side of fried platains.  Yum!  I did leave out the cayenne to make it a little more kid-friendly.  We added tobasco to ours at meal-time and it was fantastic.   I would recommend using a 3 to 1 broth to quinoa ratio (ie 3 cups of broth for every 1 cup of quinoa).  This recipe says it makes 10 servings, which may be true if you are serving it as a side dish.  As a main course, it probably makes about 4-5 servings.

Yum!  I made a half recipe and served it topped with a chopped avocado and several dashes of Tapatio hot sauce...it made a delicious meal.  My husband (who is from Guatemala) said it tasted like "Moros y Cristianos" a traditional Cuban recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

This was really good.  I have been searching for the quinoa black bean salad I had found a year or two ago and this still isn't quite it, but its very close!  I add a splash of lemon juice or lime juice to it as well.

Great with sour cream and cheese on top. A bit low on liquid to start with but otherwise pretty good. Hearty and filling without the need for meat.

This was fabulous! I did not have corn but otherwise followed the recipe to the T and my husband, kids, and I loved this! Our oldest son is allergic to rice (as well as a million other things) and finding new ways to prepare quinoa is tough. This is definitely something we will make often!

Made this to bring to a small party and it was a huge hit.  Suprisingly most of them had never liked quinoa before, but even went for seconds with this recipe.  I will be making this often!

THIS IS A TERRIFFIC RECIPE. I MADE A FEW CHANGES TO IT:
I TOASTED THE QUINOA IN A 350 DEGREE OVEN FOR 20 MINUTES
I SERVE IT WITH SLICED AVOCADO AND SALSA.
WE ALSO PUT THE MIXTURE IN A CORN TORTILLA AND EAT IT LIKE A TACO.

VERY, VERY YUMMY.

Perfect vegan meal.  Good with corn chips on top.  It's a little boring though..

Great recipe. I added some chopped red bell pepper at the same time as the corn for additional color and crunch, but otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely make this again soon.

I'm only giving this four stars "as-is".  I do a similar recipe, with quinoa or barley, depending on what I have on hand, but always add green pepper, in place of corn, green onions as a garnish, and I 
ALWAYS use a splash of fresh lemon juice to get a nice fresh flavor at the end.  Sometimes adding a little lemon zest also.  This is a favorite, as I prepare it...  without the lemon, this is a little bland for us.

Excellent...First though, when you rinse this you need a very fine colander. Rinse well...then follow exact recipe, using only one can of black beans. I had to use chicken broth but other than that followed exactly. Really liked this! I can see how versatile this could be.Update: I have made many times since and have added green and red pepper and even added cooked chicken. Use your imagination.

I used what I had on hand beef stock and didn't use corn but diced peppers and one can of beans.  It was great like that but better after I used it to stuff bell peppers.  Will have to use again to make stuffed peppers. I added Marinara sauce around peppers when I put them in the oven. Also made the Quinoa and beans in my rice cooker.

This was surprisingly good. We haven't done much quinoa and this was a good way to fix it. My 8 and 11 year olds and my husband liked it. We used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, added a few veggies and browned ground hamburger and a few leftover chicken sausage bits. Topped it with a dollop of Greek yogurt, shredded pepper cheese and cilantro and had an excellent one-dish meal. Thank you!

great recipe - never cooked quinoa before altough I bought it twice, one bag of the regular kind and one bag of the red quinoa - I used the regular kind this time around = I did not use the corn (too hard on the colon), used chicken stock, and added half a red pepper and half a yellow pepper, diced right after the onnions and garlic had cooked- added to the mix some coriander that I had dried myself from fresh previously- at the end, added one tiny can of black beans, and 1/3 can of kidney beans - all came out superb - maybe too much cumin for my taste, but all in all, if I eat it cold, it will not feel so spicy - I really love the crunch of the quinoa and the added texture of the sweet peppers - very nutritional and once made, easy to just dig in if I open that fridge door looking for something comforting and interesting

This is the first time I have ever eaten or cooked Quinoa. I made this recipe exactly as written as I always do the first time around so I can give the true recipe and author a chance. The one and only thing I did not mentioned was rinse the quinoa before cooking. I thought this was very good and will definately make again. Though the seasonings were not as strong as I had hoped for so I will double the garlic, onion and cayenne pepper. 
Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night and it was fabulous.  Plus, it fits so well into my busy schedule.  Took about 10 minutes to prep.  That means a lot, since my rule is, it can't take any longer to make than it takes to eat -- at least on weeknights.  :>)  This had a ton of flavor, spicy but not too spicy.  It could be a side dish or a main dish.  And quite frankly, for fiber and protein, I think I got my daily recommended amount just out of this one dish.  I only used one can of beans, since so many reviewers recommended that.  I could have used a few more, but not an entire can, so it wasn't worth opening another one.  I brought it to work today for lunch, since so many people said it tasted good cold.  If it does, this is definitely a dish I will do over and over.

I was a bit leery of how much I would like this since quinoa can be sour-tasting, but it was DELICIOUS! I wish I had doubled the recipe and frozen half for the next week too - definitely do it! It was great with avocado slices and tortilla strips! Also, add a red bell pepper or roma tomato wedges if you have - lovely!

Added a red bell pepper which made it even prettier. Super yummy - can tell it's going to get better as leftover. Used an entire can of chicken broth since there was so little left after 1.5 c. Thank you for the recipe.

I love this recipe! I've used fresh ingredients, powdered spices, a mix of fresh and not and it is always fantastic!! I always use beef bullion for the liquid base to give it a better rice and beans type flavor.

What a GREAT recipe! Cooking for one this gave me a lot of leftovers which I heated on the stove using just a bit of vegetable broth in the bottom of the saucepan.  By the time the broth was gone, it was heated through and ready to eat.  Definitely a keeper!

I have been doing a lot of research to find different ways to use quinoa and this recipe came up.  And holy smokes batman it is DELICIOUS! I made this recipe for a family who just welcomed their baby girl home and needed something healthy and gluten free.  The only little things changed were I used only 1 can of black beans, used canned corn (drained) instead of frozen and added diced sugar plum tomatoes, red onion and freshly squeezed lime juice to take it up a notch. I thought the amount of seasonings that it called for were just right.  I also served it with shredded chicken over a bed of greens to make a complete meal out of it! LOVE!

If you like cilantro this is a no brainer! So good! I put a dollop of sour cream on mine. Next time I plan to use this a vegetarian filler in a tortilla with some chopped tomatoes and lettuce and wrap it up like a big 'ol burrito. Giddy up.

Never had quinoa before and didn't know what to do with it... this was a perfect start. I sauteed the onions and garlic with a red pepper and added about a 1/2c of that to the boiling chicken broth & quinoa along with about 1/3c of soffrito. While that cooked I browned 1lb of ground chic breast seasoned with adobo, garlic powder, cumin, salt & pepper in canola oil. When the quinoa was done I poured the entire contents into the pan with the chicken and the sauteed veggies. I used 1 can of black beans and the leftover corn from our frig (about 1/2c or so). Mixed it all up. Seemed a little dry so I added another 1/2c of soffrito. It was yummy! Thanks for the inspiration :)

It's good, but I was expecting exceptional.  It reminded me of Chipotle and so my mind kept wanting it to be something from Chipotle.  So after tasting it the way it was written (except with only 1 can of beans), it was good.  I then chopped some jalapeno peppers and mixed it in.  Better.  Then I chopped some tomatoes and mixed that in, even better.  I think next time, I'll chop some red and green peppers and saute that with the onion and garlics.  This was my first time cooking quinoa.  The texture is rather unique.

Delicious as written, but even more complex flavors noted when you add fresh lemon juice, chopped fresh tomatoes, etc.... Can be served hot or as a cold salad type of side dish.

the first time i made this following the directions exactly and it turned out very good. However the black beans were too much and the over all consistency was too gooey for me. I made this dish again tonight with slights changes. 1 can black beans, one can corn, sauted the quinoa with the onions, garlic and spices for 3 minuts then added the vegitable broth. Heres where I changed things around a bit more. I boiled the quinoa for about 5 minutes before reducing the heat and covering it. I also put a paper towel under the cover to help absorb more moisture ( a trick most persians use when making basmati-jasmin rice) this helped it not have that muddy consistancy at the end. I also microwaved the beans and corn before stiring it in. Too much stiring can cause that muddyness again. Hope this review was helpful.

This was quick and easy and came out great.  I did have to add some salt and pepper and just for fun I stirred in a little jarred salsa to make it seem more mexican.  My family enjoyed it and we will make it again!

It was my first time cooking quinoa but it won't be my last. This recipe was delicious,nutritious,easy to make and low fat! I only used 1 can of black beans and that was plenty for us. It is going in my family favourites folder.

This was delicious!  The only change I made was to saute the onion and garlic in coconut oil.  Next time, I think I will only use 1 cup vegetable broth and 1/2 cup water so it's not quite as salty.  This definitely satisfies...can't wait to reheat some for lunch tomorrow!

Served this tonight in homemade Whole Wheat Tortillas topped with shredded cabbage, fresh zucchini, bell pepper, spinach, green onion, tomato, and drizzled with lime juice.  I also added a can of pinto beans instead of two black beans.  We could not stop eating this!

This was a nice side dish. Tasty but didn't distract from the main dish. My husband especially liked it. It made a large amount, enough for several dinners with plenty of leftovers to take to work for lunches. I doubled the cayenne, used 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup quinoa (increasing the veggie broth to 2 cups, accordingly), used a full package of corn instead of just 1 cup, and added a chopped zucchini for a little veggie punch. Nice dish.

Wow, wow, wow! This is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I cooked the recipe as stated and only add a dash of cayenne (to my preference). This will now be my go-to salad for easy, low fat lunches and also to take to potlucks, etc.  What a great tasting recipe! Yummy!

Very good! After hearing a lot about quinoa and it's health benefits I was skeptical but excited to try it. After searching for many different recipes I decided on this one and I'm glad I did! My family loved it! I made just a few changes:
Used just 1 can of black beans. 
Added one red pepper.
And trippled the cumin and cayenne. (We like the flavor)
I think that it's missing something to be considered a meal (maybe chicken) but it does make a great side dish.
Will definitely be making it again!

Very good! I doubled the cumin and added some coriander since I didn't use cilantro (not a fan). Omitted the corn and added two small, cooked and cubed sweet potatoes. Yum! Will make this again and maybe use more/different spices and veggies.

Made this a hundred times and it is tried and true.  I usually skip the corn and opt for chopped spinach and canned chicken instead (added when the corn is called for).  I also use chicken broth (low sodium) instead of vegetable broth, and olive oil instead of veg.  At this point I just eyeball the seasoning, but I almost always go more than what is called for.  I rarely have cilantro on hand, but when I do, it really sets this dish off!

Great and versatile recipe! My non-bean loving husband enjoyed this, with the addition of some cheese and salsa all rolled in a wrap. I used one can of black beans which was plenty for us and substituted zucchini for the corn. I can see how guacamole would be a good addition as well.

This recipe is delicious!!  I love making this because we always have leftovers and I eat it for the lunch the next day.  It's one recipe that I don't mind customizing for my picky kid and husband.  I scoop my husbands portion out before I add the corn and beans and scoop my oldest daughter's portion out after I add the corn.  My youngest and I love it just the way it is!!!!  So easy!

extremely simple and tasty recipe! i love quinoa, but this is the first time that i cooked it on the stovetop and mixed it with other ingredients. i didn't have any cumin so i added more cayenne pepper, and it give it a really good kick. i didn't include any fresh cilantro since i didn't have any on hand. also, like what others suggested, i used one can of black beans, and it was plenty. i used a cup of chicken broth instead of veggie broth, and it was the perfect amount as well. i nixed the salt since the broth already had sodium included. you can eat this as a healthy main dish, but i used it as a side dish along with some baked salmon. DELISH!

This is fantastic!  I wasn't sure if there would be enough flavor, so I put salsa on the table just in case.  None needed.  I made a few changes based on the reviews: 1) I soaked the quinoa for about 20 minutes.  2) I used one can of black beans and 1 can of drained rotel.  3)  I put sliced avocado on top.  YUMMY! :-D

this was delicious and so easy!  It seems to be a pretty flexible recipe as to what you can add to it, I threw in frozen peas with the corn. It comes out a little mushy but I love it that way, if you prefer drier use maybe 1/2 cup less liquid.

This was delicious! The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, though after simmering it for 20 minutes I added some water to it. It had all evaporated/been soaked up and it said to simmer the corn for another 5 minutes.

The second time I made it, I used 1 can each of garbanzo, kidney, and black beans. I also left out the onions but added more garlic. It turned out just as good as before.

This is really a healthy dish and thanks so much for bringing me to quinoa.  Actually I liked it better before I added the black beans and I love black beans.  Next time I will cut the cumin in half and add some turmeric.  I added a small amount of Mexican Chili seasoning, onion and garlic powder.  Just the right amount of hottest for Nancy and I.

Totally yummy... I have made it a couple of times. The first time I made it exactly according to the recipe... now I use chicken broth and cut the beans to just one can, and make them kidney. I also cut the broth to 1 1/4 cups because I wanted it a little drier.

LOVE THIS RECIPE but two cans of black beans is WAY TOO MUCH so I use about 3/4 of a can. It's delicious and nutritious.

was encouraged by all the positive reviews but the result was less than stellar.  the mixture of quinoa was sticky and looked and tasted like slop.  I wonder what i did wrong or is this the way it is supposed to be.

This was my first time cooking Quinoa and it truly is a delightful accompaniment to a meal or filling enough as is! This recipe is easy, colorful, and totally satisfying. I love the texture and nutty subtle flavor of the quinoa. I made the black beans from scratch in my pressure cooker and replaced the vegetable oil for olive oil. Quinoa will be a staple item from hereon :)

I loved this recipe. Ive been wanting to try Quinoa for quite some time now, and this was the perfect opportunity. I cut out the corn because I dont believe there is any nutritional value in it, and replaced it with Lima beans and diced up carrots. It was phenomenal!

The only thing that I am interested about substituting is the broth. The sodium content in these cans of broth are outrageous, even the reduced sodium cans. Is there anything wrong with using water? Has anyone done that? I'm sure you could season it to taste. The meal is so healthy, it didn't feel right tasting that much salt content in it.

Aside from that, I served the dish with roasted string beans, sprinkled with parmesan and it was a huge hit. Excited to try it cold for leftovers tomorrow!

Not only healthy but super delicious.  I didn't have black beans so I added red kidney beans.  I also tossed in some stewed tomatoes and served with grilled chicken.  Very, very good!

This was inexpensive, easy and very delicious!  I followed someone else's suggestion of adding 2 cans of Costco Chicken breast, one 15 oz can of tomatoes with green chilis and increased ground Cayenne Pepper to 1/2 t.  I made it one night for dinner for myself, husband and son, had some leftovers and it was finished off the next day.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I really liked this.  I doubled the cayenne and omitted the cilantro to suit my taste.  I think it could use another punch of flavor too.  Thank you for this recipe, it was my introduction to quinoa and I'll be making it again.

SO delicious. I never have a bad review after making this. The default serving size for this recipe is 10, so I normally have plenty left over....which is fine by me because it makes a healthy and hearty lunch or side for dinner over the next couple of days.

It may be because I'm from New Orleans and like spicy food, but this was a bit bland. My wife thought it was too "peppery" so I just added some lemon juice to wake it up a bit.

I am vegetarian and always on the look out for tasty, protein filled vegetarian recipes. This recipe was amazing! It was tasty with a lot of flavour, filling from the beans and quinoa. yet healthy! i am totally making it again.
I did use red quinoa (more nutrition) and had to add some more water for it to fully cook. It tasted lovely.

How could you not love this recipe!!  The quinoa turned out perfect and the flavors are so spot on!  I only had one can of black beans so I just used that, but it worked out better!  I would actually suggest to only use one can unless you just want to use 2.  This will definitely be a keeper!

A little bland.  Better with lots of toppings.  This was my first time trying quinoa.  I think I like the quinoa but I probably won't make this again.  I am going to try a breakfasty quinoa recipe next.

This dish is absolutely amazing!!!! I'm vegan and always looking for a good quinoa recipe. I made only a few slight changes: I only used 1 can of black beans and added a little lemon juice. Then I heated up a whole wheat wrap, spread avocado on it and put the quinoa on top. It was super delish! Will definitely be making this again!

Last night was the first time we've eaten quinoa. This recipe sounded too good to pass up. I followed some of the comments and added red and yellow bell peppers and a whole zucchini. Also, instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil.  It was so delicious and tasted even better tonight after letting the flavors 'marry' overnight! I will definitely be cooking this again!

This recipe is great! So simple and so tasty. I stuck to the recipe and it was an instant hit. My three year old loved it with avocado slices as a chaser to offset the cayenne. Next time I will add some bell peppers and maybe tomatoes.

I don't usually rate a recipe when I haven't made it exactly as written. However the alterations I made likely made little difference in the outcome. This is by far one of the best quinoa dishes I've ever had! I made minor substitutions...used only one can of beans, used canned corn (didn't have frozen) and used dried coriander instead of fresh cilantro (also because I didnt have any on hand) I think the flavors would probably be close would I have made it just like it was written. Perfect texture, spice and sweetness!

This is the first time I made quinoa and it's pretty good. Reading some of the other reviews I decided to increase the heat and used 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper. I think that was a mistake and I like spicy food. The extra cayenne overpowered the other flavors. I also oven roasted the corn and used chicken stock but everything else I did per the recipe. I'll make it again but next time only 1/4 cayenne paper.

For a little zest and flare, I add in some chopped tomatoes, avacodos, and drizzle with a little lemon. SO GOOD!!!

I had this recipe saved in my recipe box for a long time since I've enjoyed quinoa by itself. And mixed with other veggies stuffed into green bell peppers etc.

I gotta tell ya, this one kicks! This recipe can take you to the next level of your choice. Play with it and add whatevers and it still more than satisfies.

It was so simple that I was hesitant.  I had quinoa before and didn't really care for it, but this was GREAT!  We put some cheddar and plain yogurt over it....mmmm!!  Delish!  I will be making it again! I agree with previous reviewers that you should always rinse quinoa before using...it even says in on the package.

This is a great recipe to try if you're new to quinoa. I used only one can of black beans and also added a can of rotel, and served as a side dish to enchiladas. It was awesome! It also reheated well the next day. I will definately be making this again.

DELICIOUS!!! The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars is because I thought it should have had a little more spicy flavor to it. Next time I will make this with some more cayenne pepper. I also added some lime juice and zest, it was sooo good!

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I had never even heard of quinoa before accidently coming across this recipe.  The texture is different, and it's a bit of an acquired taste, but excellent.  I doubled the recipe the second time around and only used one can of black beans, which was plenty.  I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil, did not add extra salt, and used a little extra garlic.  I highly recommend trying it.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I just love this recipe.  I do however use chicken stock instead of veggie and omit the corn.  I only use 1 can of beans and on occasion I have added a can of rotel or chopped cherry tomatoes.  I love it with avacado slices as well.  This is a great recipe you can enjoy as is or you can change it up according to what ingredients you have on hand.

SOOO delicious!  I swapped out the corn for another can of black beans and from another recommendation paired this with the 'salsa chicken' recipe on this site.  Yummy and keeps well in the fridge - it was dinner and lunch the next day.

This is a good recipe. I have made quinoa a couple times and was looking for a quick fix. Usually I made it mexican flavored, but this was a nice change.
After tasting it at it's completed stage, I decided to add some ground beef, a little tomato sauce and 2 laughing cow cheese wedges and voila! a family meal instead of side dish.
Great recipe!

This was so easy and delicious - and quick!  Its challenging to find dishes that are not only healthy but tasty and simple to whip up.  Definitely a keeper for a weeknight dinner.  I replaced the vegetable broth with chicken broth and served with sliced avocado.  Its also great cold the next day.

Heard that quinoa was great for you with lots of protein. Bought some and had no idea what to make with it. This is amazing! I only had 1 can of black beans and no corn, and it was very very tasty. I did add fresh lime juice to mine. My whole family loved it!

I was looking for a different way to use up some of my quinoa and came across this one, basically decided to try it because of the number of positive reviews, which I will add to.

I followed the recipe to the T - except, I added green peppers (which were delicious), no extra salt, and didn't have chili flakes so used chili paste instead for a kick. I didn't have cilantro, too bad, would have been nice.

I wouldn't have thought of making such a dish but am now glad I did - it is a fresh view of the typical rice and beans and also a fresh view on quinoa. Highly recommend especially since you can make it your own.

This was REALLY tasty! I did tweak it a little though. I only had whole cumin seeds, so I used 1/2 tsp of those. Added a bit of lime juice. Didn't have cayenne, so I used plain chili powder, instead. I will have to try it with the cayenne, next time.

Loved it!  I had never used quinoa before.  It reminds me of a bigger couscous texture.  I omitted the oil and sauteed the onion/garlic in white wine.  I used my rice cooker and put everything but the veggies & beans into that.  Once the cooked seasoned quinoa was ready, I added it to my veggies (sauteed onion/garlic and rinsed corn and rinsed beans), and cilantro.  

The cooked seasoned quinoa was even good without any veggies or beans!

Very good, and so easy to make. I sauteed some boneless skinless chicken breast cut into thin strips in olive olive, garlic and cilantro. It was very good together. Next time I think I'll put some jalapeno slices in while it's simmering.

This had an amazing taste and I will definitely be making it again. My only small complaint (thus why it's 4 not 5 stars)is that the last TBS or so of liquid never absorbed-which tells me the ratio is not a direct 2:1 water:quinoa. Next time I will undercut the amount of water called for by just a touch so that the grain isn't mushy.

I actually found this a bit bland.  I needed to add a fair bit of salt.

Wow. I had no idea this would be so good! I could have sat down with the pot and big spoon and chowed down. I made this for a vegetarian friend who just returned home from the hospital. I added one small, diced sweet potato because I had it on hand and thought it would be good. Also a touch of chile powder and oregano, and only one can of beans. Our friend absolutely loved this and I will definitely make it again!

I've made a few other quinoa dishes and this is by far the best! So tasty! I only added 1 can of beans and added a little hot sauce (wasn't quite spicy enough) and lime juice and a bit of avocado but it's great just as it is too!

I love finding new ways to make quinoa since its a regular in my house and I loved this recipe! I made some adjustments: I used 1 1/2 cups water and added 1 an 1/2 tomato cilantro boullian cubes YUM! instead of veg broth. At the end when you add the cilantro, I added 1 diced fresh tomato and a little fresh jalapeno to give it some kick.

My first time making quinoa - and it turned out fabulous!  This has now become one of my favorite go-to dishes when we have guests.  I make one tweak now though - I substitute Mango Salsa for the cumin and cayenne.  Seems the kids like it better that way.

Very easy and good flavor.  I think next time I'll add some hot sauce when the quinoa and broth are added... just need a little more kick for our taste.

Very good!  I made mine just like the original recipe except just used 1 can of black beans and I used fresh corn.  I didn't have any for left-overs, I'll have to make a bigger pot!  :)

Love it love it!! This was my first time making quinoa, and next time I won't soak it first, as it got too mushy for me. I added diced zucchini to the onion, only put in 1 can of beans as suggested, and added bell pepper at the end. The flavor was excellent!! will definitely be making it again.

This is a great basic recipe for the newly-exploring 'granola' eater.  Having converted away from processed foods and only eating "real" food for many years, I added on to this one.  I added zucchini and Kale to the quinoa mixture prior to covering and simmering.  I also subbed the corn for edamame.  I also added 1/2 a jar of roasted (in garlic and olive oil) red peppers I had on hand.  Because I added more "stuff", I doubled the spices.  This is a great one, especially for a filling lunch after a hard yoga class.

This is the best quinoa recipe I've tried yet! The flavor is wonderful! My husband even liked it, and he's not too keen on quinoa. This is easy to make and a healthy choice. We used it as a side dish, but could make a great meatless meal.

Very Good. Added chopped zucchini with the onions and added a bit of chilli powder. Topped with sliced avocado and salsa.  Turned out great. Next time I may add some diced tomatoes.

This was easy, tasty and most all, my husband liked it! I read throught everyone's reviews but had already purchased a 30 oz can of black beans so went ahead and used them. I added 1/4 cup additional quinoa and I thought the parts were equal. I have jalapenos in my garden and we like things a bit spicier than most so I sauted 3 of them in with my onions and garlic. I also used the fire roasted frozen corn from Trader Joes. I HIGHLY recommend that - it added an additional dimension to the dish. Will definately make again. THANKS!!!

I have made this recipe several times as a main dish and even my kids love it. 
I do make a couple changes but it is good as is. I usually only use one can of beans and also add in a can of diced tomatoes (drained) I also go light on the cayenne because only my bf likes the extra spice.

This was fabulous and my husband also loved it.  We are trying to eat less meat so this will be a vegetarian staple for us.  I needed 3 t oil to saute the onions/garlic, added 1 c edamame and used only 1 can of beans as another reviewer suggested and this was just the right amount.  I also added a couple splashes of rice vinegar at the end which gave a nice flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Also great for lunch the next day.

I made this last week and it was so good I ate it almost every day. It's super easy and super quick to make, I scaled it down for one serving and used about 2 Tbsp quinoa. It's very important to soak your quinoa for about 15 minutes before you cook it, or at least rinse it to make it fluffier. This recipe will definitely keep you "regular" if you know what I mean with all that fiber! Super good, I'm going to be making this again very soon!

I think this was the first dish I tried with quinoa, and I love it! I like that it's very adaptable to whatever you want... you can add or take away veggies, change up the spices (I sometimes will add my homemade taco seasoning), etc. If you don't like cilantro (I love it, but hubby hates it), the dish is still good without it. I also use chicken broth, because that's the only think I keep on hand. This is perfect as a side dish or a main dish, hot or cold! And unlike many salad-type dishes, this one keeps well in the fridge.

I loved this recipe!! I also used bulgar which I loved ! The only thing I changed was the cilantro and it was better without it because ifelt like it was to strong in it. I also added tomato and zucchini which someone had suggested and it was incredible!! Loved this recipe and it was even great leftover!!

What a great combo. Black bean and quinoa were made for one another. I soaed myt quinoa for about 1/2 hour before as another reader suggested. I also used only one can of black beans, because that was enough for me. I only had dried cilantro available. Of course, the freshe would be better, but this did the trick. Loved the dish! This will become a regular for a nice, quick vegetarian dinner on work nights.

Great Recipe! Made it exactly as directed. I did add a little to much salt. Be conservative on your salt the chicken stock contains salt as well. This would be great in tacos or as a dip with salsa. Yumo! Will definitely make this again!

I make this recipe often and usually as a quesadilla filling.  I like to add sweet red pepper along with the corn and beans for a bit of crunch, and I omit the cayenne when serving it to my toddler.

So, so good!  I used what I had on hand -flavored olive oil instead of veg.oil, jarred garlic instead of fresh, water instead of broth, 1 can drained sweet corn instead of frozen, 1 can of black beans instead of 2 and some sweet paprika instead of cumin.  Delicious, quick & healthy!  I made extra & with the half of the leftovers I added lean ground beef & made tacos and added the other half into my meatloaf!  Delicious!

Was very tasty.  Have used a couple of times.  I eliminated the cayenne pepper after the 1st try b/c it was too spicy for my kids.

This is an excellent, easy recipe.  It keeps well in the refridgerator - and actually tastes even better the next day.  You can dial up or down the heat (cayenne) according to your tastes.  I use more heat for my husband and I and less if the kids are eating it.  I add other veggies that I have on hand and want to use (peppers, tomato, etc), but it is great as is as well.  You can use 1 or 2 cans of beans, depending on your taste preference.  I love the flavor and heat of this recipe!  It works as a side dish, salad, main course, appetizer, etc.

This so fantastic. Best quinoa recipe I have tried. Easy to make and hits the spot. It is good as a side dish or just by itself. Pretty good too when you sneak a forkful out of the frig.

Love this recipe! This is the first time I've made quinoa. I've read so much about its nutritional benefits and have always wanted to try it. Now I'm hooked! I used olive oil instead of veg. oil, didn't have cayenne, used red pepper flakes and canned, not frozen, corn. Delicious!

Fantastic! I used two different types of bean and I was impressed.  I cut up some tomatoes to sprinkle on top. It was my first time cooking with quinoa.  The recipe was inexpensive, simple and tasty.  Thank you for posting it!

This was awesome! Went by some of the reviews and added tomatoes. I did omit the red pepper flakes since this was a multi-purpose meal that my 10 month old was going to eat too...and I couldn't put it in her mouth fast enough! I did have to add more chicken broth as the quinoa was cooking. I did half the recipe and it made A LOT!

I'm updating this to 5 stars, I love this salad.  I really liked this, especially with some chopped avocado.  I like it best cold or room temp. Next time I will add some fresh chopped tomatoes and a bit of lime juice.  This is a great vegan dish!

LOVE this.  Only gave 4 stars due to what was in my cupboard.  I didn't have any corn, so I eliminated on of the cans of beans and added red & green pepper.  At the very end added some diced tomatoes...a little salsa and mmmm what a grand dinner.

Not a bad recipe, but it definitely needs a bit more flavor. Also, I followed the recipe exactly and 2 cans of beans is WAY too much. I'll definitely try this again with a few changes.

This is sooo good!  And easy, too!   I wasn't sure my husband would be satisfied with this and a salad but he was, and he loved it.  Made it exactly as written just to test the recipe, next time I will feel confident in playing around with the ingredients a bit.

Delicious, healthy meal or side. The only thing I did differently was use one can of black beans versus two. My husband added shredded chicken breast to his, which he said made it even better.

Used vegetable juice instead of broth and left out the cayenne for my daughter's taste.  Neither of my children liked it very much but my husband and I enjoyed it, especially since it is a healthy dish.  I have not used Quinoa much and thought this was a good recipe to start with.

This was delicious! As a vegetarian I'm always looking for new high protein recipes and this is a great one! It was slightly more spicy than I would prefer, but I have a very sensitive stomach. If you don't like spicy things I'd advise you to go easy on the cayenne pepper.

This was so tasty we finished it all between the two of us. I did add red peppers, tomatoes, more cumin, lemon juice and instead of veggie broth ( just didn't have any on hand) I used chicken soup base with 1 1/2 c water. I was craving chicken so even throw in some in and it was fabulous. I can definitely leave out the chicken and it would be just as tasty.

Excellent! I served this today as a side for Easter dinner to a large crowd and most were quinoa-fearing people... It was a HUGE hit! I spent quite some time printing this recipe due to so many requests! The only changes that  I made were adding a little chopped red pepper to the onion and garlic saute and I used chicken broth because that's what I had..This will be a staple in my home! Thank you!

I put a good sprinkling of Taco Seasoning I in here, and still I think it could have stood more. I only used 1 can of black beans, but I wish I had used the two...I am just getting used to the taste of Quinoa, and kind of wanted to mute it a bit more than it was with just one can. That being said, the flavor was good, and I would probably make it again.

This had very good flavor.  My quinoa pkg. was marked pre-rinsed, but I soaked it for 10 minutes in the broth while I was sautéing the onions.  The finished product was a little mushy.  Next time I will not soak it.  My family enjoyed it as a side dish and it was very healthy.

This recipe, as written, is fantastic! To quote my husband, "I'd eat this every day!" I suggest trying it as originally written first, then adding on subsequent meals to suit your tastes. Some tweaks that we really enjoy are a squeeze of lime juice, about 1/2 cup of salsa, and 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded diced and sauteed. Yummy! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the chopped onion. After i added the black beans, I also added chopped green onion and tomato. Then topped it with fresh parsley as I did not have any cilantro.

What a great recipe, this is a keeper.

Not bad for my first quinoa attempt, but it was more bland than I was expecting, compared to quinoa dishes made by my friends and family. Maybe it was because I substituted cilantro for parsley (I despise the taste of cilantro). Also, I'd rather have more corn and other veggies in the dish, and less beans.

I  love this recipe!!!!  I didn't have any cilantro on hand so I did without and it was still very tasty.  I did add a little bit more garlic to it, but I love garlic.

This was my first time cooking Quinoa...this was awesome.  1 can of  black beans would have been plenty.  I finished with lime juice and avocado---yummy.

This recipe is great.  I first made it several weeks ago and we are going to have it again this week. We were quinoa virgins.  I added a zucchini to it but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My boyfriend and I love this recipe!

I am not a huge quinoa fan but I am trying to like it. This recipe definitely helps! The flavor is wonderful. I don't know if it was just me but I found that without sauteing  the quinoa before adding the broth, I had to cook it a lot longer than 20 minutes. I think next time I make this, I will let them open up before adding the liquid.

This was really good. Best quinoa dish I've had so far. Remember to rinse the quinoa very well (2-3 times). I was out of cayenne, so I used paprika. I didn't have any cilantro, and I used less onion. Unless you are doubling it, only use ONE can of black beans. I would say this serves 5, not 10. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is only the second time we have had quinoa and this was good.  We thought it could have used more spice (cumin). I only had 1 can 19oz black beans and that was enough for us.  I used chicken broth.  Added diced red pepper.

**update** i've just made this again for the third or fourth time and still can't say enough about it.  each time i've played with it in a couple of different ways and it turns out so good every time. this time i actually burned some of the quinoa (oops) and added a full can of diced tomatoes and i still couldn't stop eating it. granted, it looked more like goulash or something but soooo good!

original review: fantastic...and super easy! this was my first time cooking with quinoa and i am hooked! i added some chicken that i cooked in a tomato/chicken broth mixture and then diced up. sooo good!

I loved it! My only changes were that I used only 1 can of black beans, omitted the cilantro because I just don't care for it, and I used chicken stock instead of vegetable because I had it on hand. I also added about 1/2 cup of asst. bell peppers and topped with each serving with not quite 1 tsp. of regular crumbled feta. My mom loved it and was a little sketchy about trying it to begin with! The cumin definitely made the recipe in my opinion. Definitely will make again and again!

This turned out very well and I would definitely make again!

The seasoning was nice and subtle and the texture was very pleasing.  We ate it as a main dish with bread as a side and I would serve it again as a main, but it also makes for a filling and healthy side dish, perhaps with a flat grilled steak.

I loved this recipe.  I omitted the corn.  I was also worried how the black beans would taste since they are put in at the very end, but it ended up great.  The 6 other adults eating it really liked it too.

I loved this, so did my 6 year old twins! I added a bit more cayenne than the recipe calls for to accommodate our family's spicy palate, tri-color quinoa and double the cilantro. I think the only thing I'll add next time would be diced fresh tomato, as it was missing a "round" flavor.

As an inveterate meat eater, I have to say recipes like this make me think I could easily survive as a vegetarian. This is hearty, filling, delicious, visually appealing, and relatively cheap/easy to make. Added to my weekly rotation.

this was amazing! a few minor changes: didn't add cilantro cause i didn't have any on-hand. instead i added about a 1/4 tsp of ground coriander at the end. also, instead of cayenne i added about 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper. added these to burritos or tacos to make a delicious, satisfying, and healthy meal!

Very good, well balanced meal. Next time I might serve with lime wedges to add a little brightness. I had some extra red & yellow bell peppers that I chopped up and added. Lots of flavor & texture. I would make it again.

My family doesn't like to try new things and especially things they haven't heard of, so when they heard Quinoa, they weren't excited.  But, once they tasted this, they wanted seconds immediately and asked when I was going to make it again!  Everyone loved it, including me.  This was great.

I love quinoa, and I love beans.  I had a lot of both, so I searched for a quinoa and black beans recipe, and I'm so glad that this came up first!  As most reviewers noted, the recipe is pretty much perfect as is.  The only thing you might want to do is tweak the spices to your own preference.

This is so delicious that I made an account here, just so I could add it to my favourites!! The cayenne pepper adds just the right amount of spicy. I didn't have onions, and I only used 1 cup of beans. Fantastic!

Absolutely fantastic! Delicious.  The 10-serving recipe makes about 7 cups.  I'm taking it to work for lunches this week.  Also, I used 1 can black beans and 1 can dark red kidney beans.  Tastes great.

LOVED this!  Even got my, not so open minded, family members to fall in love! Easy recipe and one that I will me making regularly.  I quesstimated on the seasoning measurments and think I added more cumin and cayenne then the recipe calls for.  I love spice so it was perfect for me... a nice little kick!

Fantastic!!  I halved the recipe and 1 can was a little too many beans, but the flavor was excellent!  I added a few chopped, pickled jalapenos and put it on a tortilla w/ mexican cheese... WOW!! Thanks for the super healthy delicious meal!!

SO good!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  This was my first time cooking quinoa.  I have been eager to try it since learning about all of its health benefits.  This recipe is FULL of flavor and so filling!  Maybe even better leftover.  I was so worried to try it at first, but that was all for nothing!  My husband went back for seconds!  I added more cilantro because we LOVE cilantro & I didn't "measure" the salt, but boy did it come out with the most perfect well-rounded flavor!  So satisfying for such a healthy food when you're trying your best to eat well!  Can't thank you enough for posting this!!!

Love, love, love it! I added more cumin and other spices to suit my taste, I omitted the corn because I didn't have any and I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used dried. This is definitely a keeper. I can imagine several variations like adding soy sausage, red/yellow bell peppers, other beans, etc. and I will definitely use fresh cilantro next time. Thanks for sharing!

Very nutritious and easy to make.  I halved the red pepper the first time, but will add all of it from now on.  We ate it on tortillas with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  Easy enough to add chicken or other veggies to as well.

Delicious! I made this for some friends who are on the RAVE diet- so I sauteed the veggies in a little sherry and water (no oil allowed on RAVE). I also added some red cabbage and red peppers and doubled the seasoning. For non-vegans its great with some sour cream and/or shredded cheddar.  I served it as a main dish with whole wheat pita bread and a green salad. Leftovers are great hot or cold the next day! highly recommended.

Love it! I've made this a few times and love it more and more each time. It's a meal for me (with a salad) and I grill a little meat for my hubby. I don't use corn but substitute a can of tomatoes. I also never have veggie broth at home so chicken broth it is. Made with kidney beans and it's still just as delicious. Always gotta top it with cheese!~

This recipe is wonderful.  Didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth and used a little extra.  The cilantro made it delicious.   I wish all healthy recipes tasted this good.

This is one of the most fantastic side dishes I have ever tasted.  The only thing different I did was use chicken stock instead of vegetable stock and only used 1 can of black beans.  It is the first time I ever used Quinoa and I will be making this again and again.  I am going to stuff it in won ton wrappers now and bake them, then eat them with a roasted red pepper and cilantro dip.  Oh my mouth is watering as I type!  Thank you for this recipe!!!

This was delicious! I had never had quinoa before and this was a great first dish to try it out on. I did add a can of No Salt Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic, and Oregano. Otherwise, kept everything else the same. Definitely will make this again!

This meal is cheap, nutritious and absolutely delicious. I don't usually like cilantro but in this dish is it amazing. So much flavour. I did make the mistake of adding 38 oz of black beans opposed to the requisite 30 oz. Regardless, it was great.

It was just ok. Nothing to write home about. I made it with chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I thought 1 can of black beans was more than enough. Those were the only changes I made. I didn't really care for the cumin in it. I think I may try it with a different spice. This has potential but I need to make changes to suit my taste.

Yum!  Did not have two cans of black beans or frozen corn, so I substituted a can of black eyed peas for one of the beans and used canned corn.  Also added some green pepper.  My kids loved it as a soft taco filling with a little cheese and some salsa.

Excellent.  This was my first time with Quinoa and the whole family loved it.  I served it as a side dish with grilled tilapia and it was perfect. It had PLENTY of flavor (I did add salt & pepper to taste as the recipe stated... so maybe others weren't as generous with that if they thought it was bland).  Definitely a keeper.  Very easy too.   (Oh, I did throw in some red & green pepper with the onion)

This was awesome!  I made it with chicken stock, olive oil and dried cilantro because it was what I had on hand otherwise didn't change a thing.  It didn't even make it to the table, my daughter and I ate it at the stove for lunch from bowls with fried cheese as it came hot of the skillet.  YUMMM!  This is a keeper as is, but we are looking forward to trying it with a can of fire roasted tomatoes substituted for some of the broth as well next time for a different variation.  Thank for the awesome recipe!

Made it as a side dish for Christmas for a healthier alternative to stuffing.  I loved it and most everyone else did too!  Added it to my favorite recipes! But I put the whole thing of corn instead of just a cup.  It was delish.

Tasty but I would add jalepenos for more of a kick especially if this is served with mexican dishes.

I think that this recipe was alright.    Granted, I used black beans, peas and did not use cilantro-- I still felt that something was missing.  My BF thought that the use of tempeh may be good in this.  I thought that might be a protein overkill.

This was delicious!  Sure to become one of our regular meals.  I added spinach because I didn't have corn, and added sweet potato and some salsa.  Sooo yummy!

I love how filling and healthy this is! I did double the spices because I like my food pretty spicy and it was rather bland for me with the measurements in the recipe.  I also used 1 can of black beans rather than 2 because I felt that 2 cans would result in too many beans and not enough quinoa. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making this one often.

I used it as a side dish.  It was very very good.  Also, I didn't have any quinoa so I added barkey instead.  It came out great.  Thank you for sharing!

Loved it!  I don't like cilantro, so I skipped that.  But I do like heat, so I add jalapeno and squeeze a little lemon on top just before serving.

This was really easy, fairly healthy (low fat but not as much protien as I would like), and tasty. It could be a side dish or a main course. It's also a very asthetically pleasing dish. I added extra of all the spices and garlic. I substituted some of the broth for water and used low sodium broth. I also added diced red peppers and zucchini when I put in the corn; this worked really well and added nutrition and color.

I thought this dish was great. I used red quinoa and only 1 can black beans. Flavour could be kicked up a bit, but I did still really enjoy it. It is an extremely healthy, high protein vegan dish which is a winning combination to me.

Deelish! The only change I made was doubling the cilantro. It made a very tasty burrito with chicken, sour cream and salsa.

My new favorite side dish - this is delicious! it can be customized in many different ways (no corn, add peppers, more spice, etc) but it is really wonderful just the way it is, a very satisfying dish. Even good inside of a burrito with a little chicken and sour cream - YUM!

This was just okay (if you overlook the fact that it turned out as a gloppy consistency)... I eat quinoa regularly and I found that this did not have much oomph to it. The spice was lacking, even with my addition of a Mexibell pepper.    I substituted pinto beans for black beans, but even that difference could not account for the general lack of excitement in the dish.

This was my first time cooking quinoa.  It turned out fantastic and now I am hooked. Even my husband liked this recipe - and he had his reservations at first, since it was a new thing for us.  I didn't have any cumin, so I substituted chili powder instead and it turned out great. It reminded me of Mexican rice. Served it with sour cream and salsa. Soooo good! Try this recipe! You won't be disappointed.

This was DELICIOUS! Like a lot of the other reviewers, I mixed things up a little. Cut it down to one can of black beans, added more cayenne, added chopped cherry tomatoes and a splash of lime juice. I took it to work and people who had never even HEARD of quinoa were raving about it! This may be the best thing I've tried on AllRecipes yet. Thank you, 3LIONCUBS!

Loved it!  I added chipotle in adobo sauce (just a little for spice) so I did not add the pepper.  I also used a little bit of fresh lime squeezed over.

This is absolutely outstanding. Others said it was bland so I doubled the spice portion. I thought it was a little spicy but others who ate it liked it fine. A very nice healthy change to rice and potatoes. The cilantro was in perfect proportion but I like cilantro. Very good as a snack.

So good. I added some lime juice, and green chili's - along with another reviewers suggestion to add bell peppers -  and ended up not having cumin (not sure how THAT happened) so I added allspice instead. Very tasty, the only other thing that I would change is to use just a bit less black beans, as that element dominated the dish and flavor a bit too much for me to rate this as 5 stars.

I tried this recipe tonight for the first time and was a little dissapointed. We love garlic so I added more than it called for..I didn`t have any cumin so subbed it for garam masala. I found it very bland. It had a tiny bite to it....but otherwise quite tasteless. I WILL try it again but I think I`ll add lime juice to it and see if that helps.

This is amazing!!   I had never heard of quinoa until one day it was on the Dr. Oz show.  I then searched allrecipes and found this recipe.  I followed this recipe exactly the first time I made it, then changed it up the next few times.  I add lots of other veggies to it, red, orange, yellow and green bell peppers, frozen sweet peas, zucchini - I also like to put it in a bowl or on a plate, top with shredded mexican blended shredded cheese (or taco blend) and zap it in the microwave to melt the cheese then sprinkle on Frank's Red Hot sauce - it's SO GOOD!!  Absoultely delightful!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

Great recipe.  I used red kidney beans, having no black ones and it was yummy.

I use either olive oil or no oil at all when I do this recipe and I leave the liquid from the black beans in the recipe. Some alternate ingredients I have tried is using tomato bouillion to make the veggie broth and lipton's veggie soup mix (so I dump the salt) instead of the veggies. This is great to do when I am at work because I can't chop veggies and the soup makes a decent substitute. If I use the soup and bouillion, I use 4 cups of water and 2 cups quinoa. At home, this recipe is perfect just like it is written!

After years of using all recipes, I am now joining just to review this recipe.  I could eat this for days!  It's that good!  I made this with the whiskey mojo marinade from this site and it was a great dinner.  The only thing I did was add a red pepper with the onion and garlic.  If you have never tried quinoa, try this!

This isn't bad! I didn't have any cumin & don't care for cilantro so didn't include either, also, I used chicken broth. Very easy & good. Even my carnivorous husband liked it. UPDATE: I froze some & it was great defrosted.

not your typical bland quinoa, this was packed with flavor.  I don't think the corn added much though; the flavor was better before adding corn.

Just finished eating this as a main dish and I'm impressed.  It's a nice deep flavor with the spices and black beans.  I added some shredded carrot to the onion and garlic, but that was the only change I made.  I kinda want to go back for seconds now and I should have made more!

This recipe was very delicious. The only thing I changed was the amount of oil to saute the onions and garlic, and the amount of vegetable broth. I used only one tablespoon vegetable oil and then sprayed the pan with cooking spray (for less fat content). I also used a whole a 14.5 ounce can of vegetable broth because my quinoa was not softening up as it should. Other than, this was a great and tasty recipe for my dieting needs. Definitely 5 stars!

We absolutely love this recipe.  Have been making it with variations now for almost a year.  We enjoy including chopped jalapeno and red bell peppers for a little more flavor, but its very good as written too.

This recipe is certainly hearty and healthy, but low on flavor. I'm sure there's a way to turn this into something delicious, but I haven't figured it out yet.

Yummy!!  I really enjoy quinoa and this was a perfect recipe to pair with my Chicken Kabobs Mexicana from AR.  This recipe definitely only needs one can of black beans, I think two would be overkill and take away from the grain!  I used chicken broth and swapped out the cilantro for parsley as we are not fans!  Excellent!

I rarely comment or review recipes but this one was so delicious I had to put my two cents in. I made this recipe as listed except I only put 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper in as my family doesn't like things too hot. My 11 year old daughter and I made it together for lunch and thought it was fabulous (and she doesn't even like black beans)! This one is definitely a keeper!
UPDATE: Leftovers taste great stuff into a pita with some tomato!

For my first experience with quinoa, I chose this recipe. It is fantastic!! I did follow the suggestion to only use one can of black beans and I can't imagine adding a second one. One was perfect. I also added some leftover, cooked chicken at the end to make it more of an entree instead of a side. It worked really well. Next time I might add a can of green chiles. Yum!

Great stuff. I would add a tad more garlic and some lime juice. Maybe a little less corn. Serve with slices of avocado or some pico. Yum.

Excellent side dish! Made it as stated here without the onion. First time trying quinoa and it is a nice nutty grain that is a great base for whatever you want to add in. This is a southwest flavored combo, but there are tons more out there. Sundried tomato and cannellini beans with italian seasoning or chickpeas and curry powder for indian. Thanks for sharing this!

This is a good mexi side dish, but I also think it would be awesome as a burrito. I'd add salsa or chopped lettuce and tomato in it for a burrito, but... it's still good the way it is.

Excellent! Made this last night and my picky husband really liked it. He was turned off at first by how it looked--said it looked like boiled bird seed. However, once he tasted it he changed his mind. Made the following revisions - used jalapeno-infused grapeseed oil instead of vegetable oil, omitted onion (hubby & I don't like), used all natural chicken broth (didn't have veggie broth on hand), and southwest style frozen corn. Really pleased with the way it turned out. Husband went back for seconds. Will definitely make this again.

Excellent. It says it's make's 10 servings, but there was maybe a serving and a half after 5 adults had it as a side dish.   We did need to use a bit of extra liquid (after 20 minutes of simmering there was none left). Also, we pre-soaked the quinoa for 15 minutes and only used 1 can of black beans (plenty).

I also added red pepper, mostly for nutritional value, and since I didn't have veggie broth I just used water. It was still delicious. Since we were in a rush, the quinoa only simmered for about 10 minutes. In spite of all these change, this was great meal. A very forgiving recipe that takes lots of changes and still tastes great!

Very tasty vegan meal. I gave it 5 stars for being the perfect food  - low fat, low cal, high fiber, high protein, fairly inexpensive and filling without making you feel bloated. This is the perfect meal to make after maybe a weekend of eating more extravagant meals. I made this as a main dish, served with a salad and red wine. If you like black beans and rice, you will like this. Did not change or add anything. You could adjust the spices in the quinoa to your liking. Unfortunately, hubby will not eat this (sigh).

Best Quinoa recipe I have found. I also added chick peas and edemame and served chilled. It made a huge amount that I could eat on all week and enough for nieghbors to have some also! Do make sure you follow package instructions when cooking your Quinoa.

This was a huge hit at the church potluck and not just with the vegetarians!  Had leftovers the next day and co-workers came to see what was giving off that wonderful smell!  Very filling and healthy and full of flavor.  Will make again and again.  Thank you!

YUM. Made it exactly like the recipe, and it was delicious. Perfect. Would be good with fewer beans if you want the quinoa to be the focus. I would love more onions, too. As it is, it'd be a great main dish. We had some sour cream on the side, which was also delightful. This makes a HUGE skillet full, so plan on enjoying leftovers for a while if you don't have a big family.

I used this instead of rice and beans in our burritos last night and everyone LOVED it!  We are all having the same thing for lunch today. Yum!

Great recipe!  Easy and flavorful.  I topped this dish with grilled chicken tenderloins which were seasoned with cumin, garlic, salt and pepper which complimented it very well.  My husband who is not one to speak up about food actually said "wow" when he took his first bite.

We made this for Mother's Day BBQ and everyone loved it. Substituted celery for the onion (my husband can't eat them). One of my guests threw some feta cheese on his and said it added a nice flavor. Definitely plan to make this again! It is very versatile, I plan to make it again and play with adding different ingredients.

Delicious! I sauteed mushrooms with the onions and garlic, and added a chopped tomato with 10 minutes left to simmer. Flavourful, and easy to make. Will definitely make again!

I always pre-washed quinoa for 2 1/2 min. I have found the grain tastes better. I cooked the quinoa, (red and white)  in beef broth, it is what I had. It came out hardy but needed something, so added turkey franks cut up and had spicy brown mustard on the side. The mustard made this recipe outstanding.

Yum!  I've been wanting to make quinoa for awhile now because I've read so much about the health benefits.  This recipe was so easy to make and turned out delicious!  I wanted to serve this as a cold salad, so I let it chill for awhile and also added fresh lime juice to it.  So fresh!  Because some reviewers mentioned the quinoa got soggy, I kept my eye on it, and only cooked it 12-15 minutes (serving for 5).  This will definitely be a summer staple for me.  (I did try this warm, and it was very good served warm too.  I just prefer it as a cold salad).

We liked this, but didn't love it - we used it as burrito fillings, with cheese and Frank's Red Hot.  The acid in the Frank's really helped; I think if I made it again, I'd add a squeeze of lime or lemon to brighten things up a bit.  I followed the recipe exactly, with two minor technique modifications:  I added the spices to the pan when the onions were half-cooked, hoping to bring out the flavors a bit more, and added the beans with the corn so they'd heat through.  I think part of the problem was that I used canned black beans; I always do, but I think for this recipe it might be worth making my own, since the beans are pretty much straight-out-of-the-can.  Thanks for the recipe!

The cilantro really makes this dish great! I have made this many times now and everyone that's tried it loves it! That includes the potluck I brought this dish to. The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Tastes great hot or cold.

I have made this before and the family loved it!  I thought the recipe was great just how it was, but I'm making it tonight and thought I'd try some of the suggestions - red bell pepper, olive oil, one can of beans.  What I did with it the last time I made it was make enchilladas out of some of it.  I shredded some boiled chicken breast, added it to the mixture, wrapped it in tortilla shells, placed it in a baking dish and poured enchillada sauce and some shredded cheddar cheese over the top.  I baked at 350 til the enchillada shells were baked and the cheese melted.  I can't remember how long, but I think between 30-45 minutes.

My family loves black beans and rice, I've been trying to get them to eat something a little healthier so I tried this on them. What a hit it came out perfect, and they all loved it. I didn't have onions are fresh garlic, so I substitued garlic and onion powder and it still came out great.

SOOOOO delicious!  I have been wanting to try Quinoa since embarking on a diet and this was fantastic.  My husband and I love spicy food, so I did add a little crushed red pepper; and I only had 1 can of black beans, so that's all I used.  It was fabulous!

This is delicious! I made a couple of changes after reading previous reviews. I used chix stock instead of veggie and increaded amount by 3/4 cup. I added a squirt of lemon juice. I left out the corn, as I don't really like it. I used only one can of beans, and did not drain or rinse them. It added a moisture and taste, and deepened the color a bit. I also simmerd about 30 minutes. Yummy! I will definately be making this again!

This dish was fantastic, versatile, and nutritious. I used beef broth and 1 can of black beans, as well as dried parsley rather than cilantro. The only thing I'll change next time is the amount of liquid -- there was still about 1/4 cup left over after the quinoa cooked.

I've made this countless times and it's never disappointed!  So easy, delicious and protein dense.  Quick tip though - presoak quinoa to minimize the bitter taste or flash boil (is that a technique? hah!) to achieve the same.   Also it never hurts to double the garlic count . . . makes it totally even more tasty!

Excellent flavor!! I didn't add cilantro because I didn't have any on hand, so I zested a lemon for a little brightness. The next day, I warmed it up and put in a soft shell tortilla with fresh chopped cherry tomatoes that had a little lemon zest and cracked black pepper add to it. Next time, I think I might add a orange pepper for texture and flavor contrast and I would locate some cilantro but otherwise this was awesome.

Quinoa is my new favorite food!  This recipe is really great.  I made it exactly as said with the exception of the corn and beans.  I just used some frozen southwest corn/bean mix instead of what the recipe called for.

This is my first time making a quinoa dish, and I'm enjoying it!  I used chicken broth, but I had to add extra because it seemed the quinoa was a bit on the dry side.  I gave it some extra kick with a few dashes of red pepper flakes.  The cilantro gives it extra flavor, so don't skip it.  What a nourishing meal!

This was delicious! I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth, and a shallot instead of an onion but it turned out great. Next time I would add diced tomatoes and see how it turns out.

Wow! This was awesome! I made it exactly as written (though I rinsed the quinoa beforehand), and this is a wonderful, wonderful dish. Flavorful, healthy, filling, easy to make... both my fiance and I loved it. This is probably the best recipe I've found on here!

yum and easy! only change, I added some green onion. Might be good w/ a little crumbled goat cheese, or something to give it some red color: either top with some fresh pico de gallo or add red bell with the garlic onion saute.

This recipe was so so good! I halved it and used half a can of cuban black beans from trader joes. I also used a little more cumin than called for because I loved the flavor. I have never tried quinoa before but this was a great introduction to it, and served just fine as a main dish meal. I will definitely make again and cant wait to see how it is cold for lunch tomorrow.

I LOVED this.  Very similar to a recipe I make in the summer with couscous instead of quinoa.  Quinoa is healthier and I wanted to give this one a whirl.  Not only did I gobble it up but my husband (who abhors healthy eating) liked it too.  We each had a big bowl for lunch and I'll be making this a staple to keep in the fridge.  I like it hot, cold or at room temp, it's all good!  I did use only one can of black beans and added one red bell pepper (uncooked), minced.  I may add some lime juice next time if I'll be eating it cold.  Very easy, and very good.

The only changes I made to this were to add a red bell pepper and to use only 1 can of black beans. It was absolutely delicious! The leftovers are great both cold and reheated. I will definitely be making this again, and I like the idea of doubling the recipe to have extra for lunch the next day.

LOVE quinoa; always looking for good recipes for this yummy grain.  This is also really great rolled up in a flour tortilla with a little sour cream, and cheese.  Sometimes I even add a little grilled chicken.  Great for lunch!

I cannot believe how many people are serving this an accompaniment to meat!  Quinoa is one of the few COMPLETE proteins found in nature!  Why not take this delicious opportunity to enjoy a meatless meal?  Just a thought.    The recipe itself is good, but could use a squeeze of lime and maybe 1/4-1/3 cup of diced tomatoes.  It could have used the extra liquid.

This is really good! Very simple to make and it makes alot. I have used it as a side dish, wrapped in corn tortillas with a little salsa, and mixed with some grilled chicken as an entree. Healthy and I feel like any extra veggies added would be great.

Easiest Quinoa recipe I've ever made! I added a bit of chopped celery with the corn to add some extra crunch. My boyfriend loved it! Easy to make substitutions, such as peas or diced red pepper instead of corn. Add some tofu, lean fish, chicken breast,nuts or beaten egg (at the last second) to up the protein. For the fresh cilantro I sustituted the tube style herbs, much better than dried! Also, used college inn low sodium chicken broth instead of a salty vegetable broth, to keep it blood pressure friendly.  We will definitely make this again!

Since my daughter gave me this recipe, I have made it a lot.  I love it even as a Main Course. I love the cumin flavor and sort of kick it up with a little more than it calls for.  Even just a tad more cayenne pepper.  All the flavors marry together and simply srumdillyishous.  Aside from adding a little bit more to spice it up.  I followed the recipe to a T. Thanks for the recipe.  Ps. I had to buy the Quinoa at Trader Joe's.  It is also pronounced Keen-wah.  For those who try to pronounce it like I did at the grocery store incorrectly

This was good! I added red bell peppers and corn. I had it as a side dish to chicken breast I cooked in salsa. For left overs I cut up the chicken and mixed it in for lunch the next day. I wish I would have added more spice thought. I will make this many more times.

I don't think I've ever written a review before, but this deserves one! It was the first time I'd made quinoa and it has become my new favorite. I could eat this meal once a week, at least! The only changes I made were to use canola oil instead of vegetable and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Also I added a bit of chopped red bell pepper. Excellent! Thank you, "3LIONCUBS" :)

Very tasty, even kids liked it.  But, needed more seasoning.  Doubled the amt of cumin and added halved grape tomatoes.  That also made it look "prettier".

This dish was rather disappointing.  I can't help but think that the proportions are off!  I followed the recipe exactly except using 1/2 of the black beans called for.  It turned out soupy and I had to cook off the excess moisture, which then turned the dish rather mushy.  It had great flavor, but the texture was off.  I think next time I'm going to use 1 C of broth to 3/4 C dry quinoa, which is what quinoa recipes usually call for.  And definitely use 1/2 of the black beans called for.

Love this recipe! My little town doesn't have quinoa, so I substitute cracked wheat bulgur (and I use chicken broth because that's what I have on hand). I also add a chopped green pepper and a can or two of diced tomatoes, extra cumin and garlic. I serve this with Salasa Chicken (super awesome recipe). With the leftovers, I use it as taco or fajita topping in place of salsa. We don't really make things over and over in our house, but this is an every week dish!

I was excited to find this recipe. Black beans and quinoa are nutritional powerhouses and in my effort to follow a whole foods based diet (staying away from processed foods) I was pleased to run across this recipe. It was easy and relatively inexpensive to make and is a hearty meal.

I loved it, so did my husband, he just doesn't like as much cilantro as I do.  I mixed red and white quinoa for more color, added red peppers and green onions and a zucchini.  Will make again and again.

I added cheddar cheese at the end of the cooking process, and used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock.  This was very tasty and was a very different texture than I'm used to - thanks for sharing.

This is a great dish. I added a little less cumin and a little taco seasoning in it's place. I also added two diced (pre-cooked) chicken breasts. I used one can of reduced sodium chicken broth instead of vegeatable broth to help flavor the quinoa, plus a little diced red pepper. It was excellent with cheese and sour cream on top. I think we're gonna use the leftovers for burritos!! Thanks for this healthy(well a bit less healthy thanks to my changes ;), delicious recipe! =)

1st time with quinoa and it was easy to prepare.  Made this for a pot luck at work and it was hit or miss with my co-workers.  I will make this again for my family.

Great recipe--easy, quick, healthy, and delish! I added a bit more cayenne pepper and also some garlic powder as well, and it turned out great! It's kinda Mexican-ey, probably from the cumin, and I loved it! This is stuff you can make all the time, and it's very satisfying yet not too heavy. Wonderful!

Delicious! One quick tip: I use Knorr cilantro cubes instead of fresh cilantro. I hate buying a whole bunch and using only a little bit for my recipes... it always ends up rotting in the fridge.

Nice and filling. I did cut down to one can of beans. For color and more of a spicey taste I added and cooked right in red chopped onion, a can of diced tomato and a small can of chilies. It made plenty, even tasted great cold, spread on a whole wheat wrap as a sandwich filler.

This is an awesome recipe. This is my first time trying quinoa. I doubled the cayenne pepper and cumin. I used chicken broth because it is what I had on hand and I only used 1 can of black beans. I served this with chicken and it went very well together, even my very picky daughter liked this. This a keeper. I will be making this over and over again. Thank you for a great recipe.

Cilantro is best added just before eating or it loses its flavor so I leave it out during cooking.  For variety I cut up a hot pepper, used mushrooms instead of corn, added cubed cooked chicken, used hot chili beans instead of black beans, used spiced black beans, it's pretty easy to vary.  I'm always on the lookout for quinoa recipes and this is tasty and easy to make!

I realized at the last minute that my quinoa was no good.  It was flaked quinoa for making hot cereal.  So I substituted 3/4 cup of barley, browned it with/after browning the onion/garlic & used 2 cups of vegetable stock and cooked for about 35 minutes before adding the corn.  I still do not know what quinoa tastes like, but this recipe works well with barley.

Amazing dish!  A perfect trifecta- healthy, quick and delicious :)  It was bland for our tastes so next time I will add a bit more cumin and cayenne pepper and possibly some red pepper, paprika, etc...otherwise terrific!  Thank you for a keeper!

Great starter recipe.  I added a squeeze of lime and a dab of sour cream to give it a kick.  Next time I will throw whatever veggies I have on hand into the onion saute -- diced carrot, zucchini, bell pepper, etc.  A bit more cayenne might be a good thing too.  Overall, a healthy, hearty, quick, and tasty recipe.

This was the first time I had worked with Quinoa.  One important thing to note, I did not see mentioned in the recipe, make sure you thoroughly wash the quinoa before you cook it to wash off the bitter coating.  The only changes I made to this was I shaved the kernels off fresh ears of corn, and I added diced tomatoes.  It was quite delicious.  As I am discovering quinoa seems to takes on and absorbs the seasoning and flavors of the food it is cooked with very well.  I really couldn't discern it's own individual flavor.  It looks to be a very promising grain to work with.

Very easy, cheap, and healthy vegetarian option for weekday nights. Also it is easy clean up, which is nice. We put a small amount of light sour cream on top and it really helped.  I think next time we will add red pepper. We will be making this again.

Pretty good; nice nutty flavor. If you like heat, I'd recommend increasing the cayenne.  (It didn't seem to stick around.)  Keep an eye on it, too, so you don't run out of liquid.

We love this! I needed a quick recipe to make and take to a party and I didn't want to go to the store and buy ingredients. Luckily I had the quinoa in the cabinet along with everything else. I'd been looking for a recipe that used quinoa and appealed to me for quite soem time.  I was very pleased to stumble across this.  It was quick and easy. I took another reviewers advice and soaked the quinoa for a bit.  It was a big hit at the party. It does make a lot so we had leftovers. No one seemed to mind. My 4 year old and 1 year old both loved it.  I've mad it again several times since and have enjoyed it each time.  Depending on my taste for the day, I do add a bit more cumin and adjust the cayenne. If it's too hot the kids won't eat it. This is a great recipe and definitely recommend it!!

Really liked quinoa! Added a little montery shredded cheese and sour cream as toppings. Would make a good stuffing with chicken. Will definately make this again!

This recipe showed up just in time for my post Labor Day vow to eat healthy.  The combination of the cayenne and fresh cilantro was delicious.  I used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne, as I feel it's a little easier to control the heat and went a little easy on the pepper.  You can always add more later. I didn't have vegetable broth, so used a small individual serving can of V-8 juice and added water to make up the rest of the liquid.  The only other change was just one can of black beans.  I found that to be plenty for me.  I'll definitely make this again.  This recipe lends itself to lots of changes with different vegetables, grains, etc.

Keeper!  My favorite thing about this recipe is that you can really change/substitute/omit ingredients and it will still turn out great.  Like it better with (1) can of beans and used chx. broth and red onion instead. I don't find soaking quinoa necessary, but I definitely do rinse it.

Excellent recipe, I loved it. I personally subbed out one can of the black beans for a can of pinto instead. I've seen people say they only used 1 can of beans instead of 2, but I really like beans and didn't find 2 cans excessive. Maybe using two different kinds helped.

Delicious.  I even screwed up and opened a can of kidney beans so I used them and a can of black beans.  This was tasty hot and cold.  I put it on a green salad and loved it and I had it with a fresh tomato cut up on top with hot sauce.  Very versatile dish and pretty fool proof.

Delicious and oh-so-healthy!  I chopped up some spinach I had and added that in with the corn, just long enough to let it wilt a bit.  Other cooked vegetables can be added to make the dish more colorful.

Thise was very easy and delicious! Some minor changes I made included a little more cumin and I replaced one can of the black beans with kidney beans for more color and flavor.  I also added a whole can of corn and it didn't over do it at all (like I thought it might). I brought leftovers to work and had several people ask me for the recipe!  This one is a keeper!

This was so good. I am attempting to use all of the ingredients that I have in my house but never use. I have had half a bag of quinoa for a while so when I found this recipe I decided to give it a shot. I made the recipe exactly as is and...yum!!!

My kids loved this recipe.  It is also extremely easy and versatile. I have used chickpeas in place of black beans since that is what I had on hand at the time. My son loves to use the leftovers to make meatless burritos.

Great flavor and easy to make!  My 7 year old son loves it as well and he is EXTREMELY picky.  I was surprised he even tried it!  I only used one can of beans and it was more than enough.

Excellent recipe and excellent grain. I can see that it is going to be very versatile. I added chopped up tomatoes as the last ingredient before I put it on the table. Not necessary but did add an option.

Our first quinoa experience - and it was DELICIOUS. My 3-yr-old ate his whole bowl and he doesn't normally like things "mixed together". I admit that I added a couple things, but the recipe would truly be great as written... My changes: Only used 1 can beans. Added 1 chopped poblano, 1 chopped tomato, 1 TB chipotle en adobo sauce (from can), and 1/2 cup cooked chicken. Served with avocado and sour cream/yogurt mix.

This is delicious.  The only change I made was used only one can of black beans instead of 2 (I am a huge fan of black beans, but 1 can was plenty).  My 6 year declared that this recipe was "to die for"!

This quinoa recipe is amazing!!!  My fiance and I have made this countless times.  Great flavor.....fresh ingredients...and healthy!  A great meal to take for lunch or use as a side dish. It's so good, we've made 2 batches to last us the whole week.  If you're new to quinoa....and like the ingredients listed...make this dish!

This was our first time having quinoa.  I added 1tsp chili powder along with a can of rotel tomatoes.  I also sauteed 2C shredded carrots with the onion and garlic.  EXCELLENT!!  I also used 1 can black beans like others suggested.  I did not put corn as hubby does not like corn mixed in with his food.  Will make again!!

This was my first time cooking/eating quinoa. My family and I thought this was a great recipe! Our vegitarian neighbors gave it 5 stars also. I did add a can of diced tomatoes and a can of mild green chilis - I think it would have lacked flavor otherwise. But it turned out excellent! This will definitely be on our meal plan in the future. Cheap and easy to make.

This dish was yummylicious!  I'm still very new to cooking with quinoa, but it was so easy and turned out great!  I followed some advice I read here and added zucchini and tomato.  I also sprinkled some fresh grated parmigiano reggiano cheese before serving, for that extra kick!  Will definitely make this often, thank you! :)

This is, hands down, the best quinoa recipe I have ever tried!  The spices are fantastic.  I add a chopped red pepper and kick up the spices a bit to suit my palate, but it's just as good when it's a bit bland.

This is pretty good, but not great.  I added additional garlic (I'm a garlic fiend) a minced carrot, and a small can of sliced black olives, and served with grated parmesan.  I think the recipe is missing a basic flavor of some sort but I can't place what that is.  I think I'll use the leftovers as a burrito filling and serve with cheddar and salsa verde.

Thankyou for this absolutely delicious recipe!  In another quinoa recipe on this website someone suggested toasting the quinoa in a dry pan after rinsing to avoid the bitter taste.  When making this recipe I let the quinoa cook with the onion and garlic for a few minutes before adding the broth with good results.  I also only used one can of black beans.

We make this EVERY week in our house... so yummy!  The first time I made the recipe exactly as stated in the directions, but found that the black beans over-powered the dish a bit.  Now when we make it, I just add one can of beans instead.  This dish will convert ANY quinoa skeptic!!

This is a very easy and healthy dish.  I thought it lacked flavor but that is easily remedied.  Topped off with avocado, lime juice and a sprinkling of cheese it was enjoyed by all.

We really liked this! It's very easy to make, and you can throw in whatever you want. I added tomatoes, and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. This is the first time I've ever had quinoa.

The first time I tried quinoa I really disliked it but I decided to give it another chance and made this dish. It was delicious, even my cousin who "hates" it said it was good. I think the cilantro is the best part because it makes it smell soo good. It's so easy that I know I will be making it again. Oh I also used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans because I like kidney beans :)

Absolutely delicous, easy and extremely versatile.  Since I discovered a tomato allergy, I have really missed having corn chips and salsa - this makes an excellent salsa substitute.  It made a great side dish, and with any added meat, it makes a wonderful meal.  Thank you thank you thank you.  Oh, I used red Quinoa for the salsa, which made it darker.

This was my first experience with quinoa so I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with this dish.  The flavor is excellent and we also liked the texture.  Cut the recipe in half for four of us and that was plenty.

This is the first time I've ever had quinoa.  We liked it, but it didn't really wow us.  I'm not a big rice fan, and although this is nuttier than rice, I didn't taste much more flavor.  I have to say, though, that I completely forgot the cilantro, so it's probably my fault.  I would still like a few more spices, though, so I'd add those next time.  I didn't have frozen corn so I just left it out, and I used only one can of beans--I agree, 2 would be too much.  I have a ton of quinoa, so I'm sure I'll come back to this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  This was my first time trying quinoa and it was wonderful!  I added a couple of chopped fresh tomatoes at the end which I think really made the dish.  It was so colorful and fresh-looking, I'd serve this at a bbq or for company.  I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth, and ended up adding some more (maybe 1/2 cup) because the quinoa dried out before the cooking time was over.  I also soaked the quinoa for 10-15 minutes first as other reviewers suggested.  This is going to be one of my new staples from now on!

Wow, this was really yummy.  I wanted to try quinoa and picked this recipe as it generally sounded good and what a good choice it turned out to be!  I made this recipe exactly as is, but added 2 chopped tomatoes as that is one of the things I really like when I have black beans and rice, and who can argue with a slightly higher veggie count anyway?  I will make this over and over again as it can be served as a salad, as a main for vegetarians, as a accompaniment, as a work lunch, and it can be served hot or cold.

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I added a red bell pepper with the garlic. This was amazing! I know it looks bland, but it really isn't. I plan on making this at least once a week, adding other veggies (tomatoes, maybe carrots). Try it!

Yummy hot or cold!  We are very picky, and my vegetarians and omnivores all loved it.  I added julienned bell pepper, a squeeze of lime, and used 1 can of beans.  Raves! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was one delicious salad! Even my sister who doesn't like black beans and quinoa liked it! The flavors are wonderful together. I especially like the sweetness from the corn. The only change I made was to use parsley because I was out of cilantro. I think this would taste even better with the cilantro! Thanks for sharing!

All my favorite ingredients! And now a favorite recipe!  My husband and I loved it.  Yes, I did change a couple of ingredients...used half the amount of cayenne and, following the advice of other reviewers, used only one can of black beans.  This recipe feeds 4, though, as an entree, even if you use the second can of beans.

Very tasty and easy. We've been looking for quinoa recipes. I used one 19oz can of beans instead of two 15oz cans. That was more than enough. The fresh cilantro is a must and really makes the dish. This will be a family favourite for sure. All ingredients we have in the house most of the time.

A great way to liven up Quinoa. I added a red bell pepper in w/ the oniona and didn't mix the cilantro in but just garnished w/ it. Next time I would add a 1/2 teaspoon more cumin and some dried chilli pepper flakes.

Very tasty. This was the first time I made quinoa so I had to ask the recipe exchange if my crunchy quinoa was cooked after 20 minutes. Someone told me to cook longer. After I did, this turned out to be tasty.

Excellent, easy & quick meal.  Didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used about a 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro instead.  A little hot for my kids, will try 1/8 tsp of cayenne next time.  Very tasty and awesome nutrition!

A great recipe. At the last minute I got too lazy to open the cans of corn and black beans so I left them out. I crossed out "and Black Beans" on the printout first to make sure it would be ok. It still came out yummy! My wife has asked for me to make it again every day since.

never tried quinoa before ...but i'll be eating it regularly now.   this recipe is so versatile and easy!like other reviewers, i used 1 can of black beans.  i also used a few shakes of ADOBO (orange) and about a tablespoon of chipotle chili powder.  makes a ton!  first night i used in soft shell tacos, then as a side.   I'm now enjoying it cold mixed in w/ some field greens, avocado slices and FF ranch dressing.  SCRUMPTIOUS!

We've been using quinoa for a while but I never followed a recipe, just cooked it in my rice cooker and added some oil and or balsamic vinegar. Now this is the way I'm going to be making quinoa from now on. The only bad thing is my daughter (21 months) still prefers is pretty plain but I can do it both ways. Thank you. PS: Didn't do garlic, used half of all seasonings and 1 can of beans because I wanted to try and get my daughter to eat but can't wait to do it like posted, maybe tomorrow.

I'm a new-comber to quinoa and after reading reviews, I decided not to soak the quinoa for more than 10 min.  I like my pasta al dente and this came out that way too.  My 8 year old didn't like the "circles"-quinoa and my partner want me to eliminate the black beans.  So... Next time, I'll add only one can of beans to half of the recipe.  I love cilantro and will triple it next time and possibly add sauted red pepper at end for color.  Served it with the slow cooker carnitas from this web site and a fresh fruit salad.  Very pretty on the plate!

Loved it with the addition of red bell peppers!  Very filling, so pay attention to the fact that the recipe listed here is for 10 servings.

I followed the recipe fairly close but used canned mexicorn and veg. better than bouillon. I thought this was a bit bland although I could taste the cayenne,it was an after taste. I sprinkled chipotle seasoning on it and it was really good. I think this recipe has a lot of potential and you could use a variety of vegies to make it more colorful and healthy.Overall, I think this is a good basic recipe and I look foreword to adapting it to my tastes.

Fabulous! Personally, I enjoyed it best with just a few teaspoons of ranch per serving to give it a little "kick" - this actually reminded me a lot of the stuff you order @ Chipotle's, but is way better!!

So good and healthy! I used only one can of beans, and I increased the cayenne a little. When I ate it leftover, I added some salsa, and that was great too.

The flavours in this were perfect, although while I made this as a main course, it's probably better suited as a side dish. Next time I'll also add tomatoes as some other reviewers suggested.

Thanks for such a great and easy weeknight recipe.
Never had quinoa before and I am so glad we tried this.  I loved it.  My daughter (2)loved it. Hubby was gone, but he would have loved it too.  We make blackbeans and rice often and this was a nice change.  Only thing I changed was used chicken broth instead of vegi broth because that was what was in the pantry. Also decreased the cayenne due to my daughter and added a sweet red pepper with the onions and garlic.  Yummy!!!!!!!

This dish is amazingly fresh and healthy. Perfect as a light main dish, or a side. Heats up really well as left overs up to a week after! I added extra cilantro, and served as a main dish with fresh baked corn-bread. Delicious!

This is an excellent recipe.  It has become one of my staples.  I like to make a pot of it on Sunday and then have it for lunches all week.  It is inexpensive, healthy, cruelty free, and delicious!

Great recipe! A little spicy for my toddler, but plain yogurt cooled it down nicely. Will make again fo shizzle. UPDATE: I add fresh lemon or lime juice and that really makes the flavor fab. Everyone loves this.

I asolutely love the flavor of this dish, unfortunately the two times that I have made it, it was too watery. I figured the measurements were correct (2 cups of liquid for every cup of quinoa), b/c it's similar to rice. I will try to reduce liquid to see if that helps.

This recipe is easy, cheap, and nutrious, as other reviewers said, but I thought it was tasteless. Granted, I did not have any cilantro on hand, which would have helped, but it was still pretty bland. If I make it again, I will decrease the amount of beans, add tomatoes and cilantro, and serve it in a wrap with sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and lots of hot sauce.

Fantastic.  Just enough spice.  My kids ate it up and asked for seconds...and thirds.  Next time, I'm making twice the amount.

My fiance and I made this recipe as written except for the addition of a red bell pepper and fresh lime juice. It is easy, delicious and nutritious! What more could you ask for? We served it with a bowl of avocados as an optional topping, and had a bottle of Tabasco sauce on the table in case people wanted more spice. This recipe is a winner, hands down. Five stars all the way!

Very yummy, the whole family liked it, even my husband!!  We all practiced saying Quinoa (Keen-Wa) correctly while eating. I used only 1 can of black beans and canned corn. I added a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce to it.  Did not serve it hot, loved it cold and even better the next day!

Made it again and this time I added Edamame....extra health kick and looks even prettier!

We all loved this!  We took the advice of others and added a can of drained diced tomatoes and some chopped orange peppers.  We did not soak the quinoa and it cooked up just fine, but we prefer it to have a bit of texture instead of being mushy.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe - I've made it many times.

I add shrimp, pineapple, and a few tablespoons of lime juice -- excellent variation on the original.

I exchanged the onions for carmelized leeks and equaled out the corn and beans (1 15 oz. can of each) and this was delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

Loved this dish, as did my teenage vegetarian daughter.  Took it to work for a potluck lunch and everyone wanted the recipe.  It's quick, delicious and inexpensive.  I made a healthier version by using a non-stick pan & 1/2 t oil to sautee the onion & garlic, eliminating the salt, and using reduced sodium beans.  The 2nd time I made it, I added a small can of green chilies and used it as the filling for vegetarian enchiladas.

While I've heard a lot about the healthy properties of quinoa, I had never had a chance to try it.  This recipe was easy and delicious.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who is curious about quinoa and looking to take advantage of its health benefits.  Thanks for a great introduction!

Wow.  My first time cooking with quinoa, and it is so very good.  Just a few notes--I'm from a small town, so it took me a while to find quinoa--it was only sold at my local food co-op/health food store.  I soaked the quinoa for 20 minutes and rinsed it twice because some non-boxed quinoa apparently can have a bitter flavor from not being rinsed.  (I learned this from asking a woman at the co-op how she prepares quinoa.  The quinoa there is located in food bins, not pre-packaged boxes.)  I added some tomatoes with green chilis at the end, and those made it too spicy, but that's my fault.  Other than that, I kept it as is, and it is fantastic!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was my first time making Quinoa and I just love it! I soaked it for 45 minutes and simmered it for a half hour plus, and it turned out great. I added diced carrots for added crunch. It would also be great with peppers, celery or tomatos. I also did a soy-lime vinegrette on it as I plan on having it as a cold salad. I am going to have it at work with some marinated tofu. This was so quick and easy, and so versatile!

This was a very good recipe.  However, I think my expectations were too high.  Based on all of the glowing reviews, I expected to think this was AMAZING, which I didn't.  It's very good, easy, and healthy, though.
Update:  Made it again and was more heavy handed with the spice.  I also added some garam masala.  This time I love it.  It just needed to be a little spicier for my tastes!

What's not to like?  The tasty and nutritional qualities of quinoa, included as a variation on the classic black beans and rice, makes for a delicious staple dish that I intend to make again.  I look forward to trying a few variations, too.

This will be going into weekly rotation in my house. It's delicious. I added a can of diced tomatoes as one reader mentioned and it was good with and without them. In fact, I think you could add various veggies to this and make it your own. I would have thrown in shredded carrots if I had any. Alas, it was grocery-shopping night and the cupboards were near bare! I didn't use cilantro or onion (ran out) and it as still perfect.

A great way to make quinoa! I'm a fan of quinoa as is, but this was tasty and different. A great transition meal to make for people who may be leery of quinoa. 
I used veggie bouillon, lemon juice, 1 cup quinoa, 1 can beans, fire roasted corn from Trader Joes, drizzled a little olive oil at the end, and red pepper flakes. Good stuff!

This was great!  Even my picky 4 yr old loved it!  So healthy too.  We had it in tortillas with cheese, avocado, salsa, sour cream-like a burrito filling.  The leftover were great on lettuce with some cheese and salsa to make a salad.  Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious.

Like some other reviewers I added some diced tomato and lemon juice.

I also did not presoak my quinoa.  This will become a regular dish in our household.

I wished I had some fresh diced avocado to add.

Very good. I followed the recipe and at the end when adding the black beans I also added a can of diced tomatoes drained. When adding the cilantro I sqeezed one lime in the mixture as well. We ate it on corn tortillas with avocado.

This recipe ACTUALLY yields about 4 servings. This was shockingly easy, healthy, and tasty-- like a vegan southwest one-pot dinner.  I added a few diced tomatoes.

Came out great!  I'm going to make this again later this week with grilled chicken.    Also I didn't have any frozen corn so I just added some drained/rinsed canned corn the same time as the black beans, and was perfect!

I could not locate quinoa anywhere in our area, so I used brown rice in it's place.  This was a good and easy recipe to assemble and I'll definitely make it again.
Updated review - I located quinoa and made this recipe as stated (minus the cilantro - do not like it).  I thought it was good, but just a tad on the bland side.  I am curious about others adding canned tomatoes.  Will give that a try next time or perhaps salsa.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious.  I remember making quinoa a while back and not liking it.  I heard it was healthy so I tried this recipe.  Wow, loved it!  I only used a little onion and 2 cloves garlic.  I made my own broth by boiling left over chicken bones in water.  The finished result is even better mixed with salsa and sour cream... yum!

This was FABULOUS! I tasted it as I went, and really liked it before the addition of the corn and cilantro. I love cilantro in my salsa, but think I liked the quinoa better before I added it. My husband is weird and had texture issues with the corn, but once he got it into a tortilla, he wolfed down most of it himself. I made it with the nopalitos con papas on this site, and we all stuffed ourselves silly last night.  Thank you for a great recipe that reminded me of my grandmother's cooking :).

This was truly excellent.  We just learned how good quinoa is for you so this was our first taste.  The whole family loved it and the leftovers were great the second day as well.  A very delicious combination of flavors and easy to make

I have made this recipe several times, it tastes the best with one can of beans instead of two, cool it overnight, and add zesty Italian dressing.

This is a great recipe!  I did make some modifications based on what I actually had in my cupboard and on other user recos.  I used Trader Joe's Harvest Grains Blend (1/2 bag), as it does have some quinoa mixed in, and I didn't have quinoa.  I followed the package for cooking time and broth measurements      (1 3/4 cups chicken broth and 10 minutes). I used only 1 can of black beans, added in 1 can of diced tomatoes, and omitted the cilantro b/c I didn't have any. It was delicious!  My husband, 17 month old son (fairly picky eater) and friend loved it! I've made this a few times, and it's a great side dish.  I've also eaten it for lunch by itself as it's very hearty.

This was my first time cooking with quinoa and I was very pleased. It has a wonderful flavour. I soaked the quinoa for an hour beforehand and it was a bit mushy, but not too bad. Next time, I will use just one can of beans and add a can of tomatoes to make it less dry.

I followed this recipe making one substitution. I replaced the veggie broth with chicken broth because I didn't have any veggie broth. It was delicious. VERY flavorful! It would be really good garnished with some avocado. YUM!

I thought this was a tasty, nutritious side dish. My first time cooking with quinoa.  I used only 1/2 of an onion, 1 1/2 cloves garlic, used chicken broth instead of vegetable, italian parsley instead of cilantro and only 1 can of the beans.  I also did not have any cayenne pepper so I substituted that with some chili powder and spinkled in some crushed red pepper for some heat.  I thought this was really good and I will definitely cook it again.

I've been eating this for years, it's one of my favorite staple foods--however I don't bother sauteing the onions/garlic--I don't think you need to unless you just can't stomach raw garlic and onions.  In fact I don't cook anything but the quinoa, and for the last two minutes of cooking it, I throw in the frozen corn and it comes out fine.  Then just let it cool, throw it all together, and pour the dressing on--saves time and it's very delicious.

I have been trying to serve a vegetarian meal once a week and this one went over pretty well.  I threw some spinach in and they didn't complain. (yay)  I think next time I will add tomatoes and maybe saute some diced carrot with the onion and garlic.  Very nutritious!

I thought it was fine. I only did half the cayenne thinking it would be too spicy. NOPE. Use it all. But, hubby and kids wouldn't touch it. It was fine. Not something I can't live withouth. Hubby says it would taste fine if it was with regular brown rice.

I tweaked the recipe quite a bit to make it a meal, but I LOVED it!  My 5 year old didn't care for it, so I think I'll stick with the recipe next time.  We used the Trader Joe's fire roasted frozen corn.  The amount of beans was good...I didn't think it was too much at all.

Even better than I had expected. After searching all over, I found my quinoa at Trader Joe's (organic market). I used fat free/low sodium chicken broth instead of the veg broth. I increased the cayenne pepper (like it spicy) and only added 1 can of drained/rinsed black beans (thought that was more than enough). Loved the flavors of the cumin and the fresh cilantro...a must add for the freshness factor. I ate this as a main dish with some organic cherry and grape tomatoes (red,yellow,orange,and
green). Delicious.....this is my first time with quinoa and won't be my last, this is a healthy and hearty dish.....even my 1/2c. serving (I'm currently maintaining on Weight Watchers)was completely satisfying. Good,healthy, organic and full of fiber to fill you. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This recipe served as our introduction to quinoa after my husband read about how healthy it was in one of his men's health magazines. We loved it! I made it exactly as recommended. It was very easy, flavorful and delicious. In fact, it's taste made us forget about how healthy it was. I will definitely make it again.

I also used only one can of beans.  I knew this was a keeper when my 12year old son asked when I was going to make it again.  Everyone loved it!  And it's sooooo easy to make.

Wow - this was excellent. I even forgot to rinse my quinoa and it still turned out good. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to try quinoa, or even to someone who has had a bad experience with it. It doesn't really need the cilantro.

This was my first experience with quinoa and it turned out delicious!  I didn't have any cilantro and didn't miss it, but I'm sure it will add complexity to the recipe.  This will definitely be a repeat!

Yum! Much more flavorful than I expected. This is great by itself but would also be great as the base for a burrito, which is how I plan to use the leftovers. I think I agree with other reviewers that 1 can of beans is plenty (unless you really just like a lot of beans!).

This was terrific.  I used 1 can of black beans per the other suggestions and thought the balance was just right.  I also stirred in fresh chopped tomatoes at the end which added a lot of color and nice flavor.  I served this with the slowcooker Kalua Pork, sliced avocados and fresh limes.  That meal totally rocked!  I will definitely serve this again.

This was pretty good, a very healthy and low fat salad. I will make it again, I used canned corn since I find it sweeter and better tasting.

This was delicious.  Made as recipe stated (except a shallot for the onion).  Added tomato and shrimp seasoned with cumin, pepper and lime juice.  Ate these in corn torillas topped with avocado and taco sauce.  Will definitely make again.

This was delicious as is, but I definitely think it could have some more vegetables.  Next time I plan on adding some red bell peppers, tomatoes, and possibly some green chiles.  Can't wait to make this one again!

I made this for wine club with mole tacos and got rave reviews. We were tasting South American wines. I have not cooked with quinoa before and do not like really spicy foods, so this was perfect. Will definately make again. It was good as a side dish and the rest of the week as a main dish.

This is soooo good, and so healthy!  I served it topped with prawns cooked in salsa and taco seasoning.  Then finished it off with homemade guacamole and some sour cream.  It reminded me of something you would get in an authentic mexican restaurant.  Yum.

I really enjoyed this dish. I made a quinoa dish before and I wasn't overly excited about it, but this recipe came out awesome. My only problem was that I was all set to make this and I realized I didn't buy an onion! I put in some onion powder and it was still great, but I want to try this with a real onion next time!

Good base recipe.  After reading other feedback, I added a couple of more tablespoons of quinoa along with a can (15 oz) of diced tomatoes with chiles. Quick and easy recipe with items kept on hand.

This recipe has very little flavor for me. I like the idea but it needs more work. Maybe some salsa stirred into it. I started off using only one can of beans, but after I stirred it in, I added the other can because the quinoa really cooks up to be quite a bit.

Tasty, healthy and easy to make, what else could one ask for? If you have never tried quinoa before, as I hadn't, don't worry you are in for a treat! I used 3 cups of just made black beans instead of the canned, doubled the cayenne and omitted the cilantro since amazingly I did not have any in the fridge! This will definitely become a regularly made dinner.

this seems to be about a 3.5, as far as my son and I are concerned.  We liked the quinoa and black beans, but the serving size was way  small.  I scaled it down for 3 people and it was barely enough for us--and he is 8.  It would probably be ok as a side dish I suppose, but we were happy to have it as a main dish.  I also used mint because I didn't have cilantro, and I think cilantro would have been better.  It could also have used a little lemon or lime juice at the end--something to brighten it up.

Terrific dish.  Added minced jalapeños and some red pepper.  We had a lot leftover so we had if for breakfast the next day.  We just scrambled some eggs and made a breakfast taco with this great dish and some Colby-Jack cheese and pico de gallo.  Yummy!

This was just okay.  Nothing special.  I have made it twice. The first time I followed the recipe but only used one can of black beans.  I agree with others that one can is enough.  I was the only one to eat it in my house so each time I ate it I tried variations, the original as is, with salsa, with fresh tomatoes.  Something missing.  The second time I made it I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 V8 juice and 1/2 beef broth to cook it in.  I also added crushed red peppers and some Italian seasoning. I will continue to make this, primarily because of the nutrition and calorie factor (trying to lose those darn 10 lbs I gained in the last year).  I think next time I will use spicy V8 and maybe try some worchester sauce and play with some spices.  Of note, I do think it always tastes a wee bit better the next day and it does make a quick easy lunch for work.

This was great, a tasty and hearty dish. We don't particularly like cilanto, so I substituted parsley. It definitely doesn't need more than one can of beans.

I am trying to eat healthier but want to enjoy my favorite tastes.  I love rice/beans/corn combinations in tortilla wraps and I could tell I would like this and I was not disappointed.  Quinoa is something I am new to but I love grains so I wanted to try it. I found it at my health food store although I mispronounced it when I asked for it. I liked it in the wraps, but it was even better using corn tortillas fried crisp and left flat like a tostada.  I topped them with fresh tomato and shredded cheese. Sprinkling a few drops of tabasco sauce on top gave the little extra flavor I love but not too much to make it HOT!

We LOVED this.  My husband was uncertain at first, but after a few bites he was raving about it.  We even had an unexpected visitor who stayed for dinner and he loved it as well.  I added much less cilantro (I am someone who can never have enough of it, but even for me, 1/2 cup seemed like a lot in this) and I added half a can of spicy diced tomatoes.  I used much less onion, and in the end needed to add some extra water.  Still, we'll be making this often in the future!  The leftovers were really good, even cold from the fridge!

This was great as a side dish, then later on as a filler for tortillas!  I love the taste!  I, too, reduced the beans to 1 can...  Thanks!

Excellent side dish, or main dish for vegetarians.  I used reduced-sodium black beans and Basic Vegetable Stock from this site to reduce the sodium by about half.  It tasted just fine to my salt-loving family.

Agreed, much better the second day as cold left-overs.  I only used one can of beans, this seemed like a good mix if you want equal parts quinoa & beans.  If you want more beans, then go for two cans.

What a great recipe! My whole family loved it. I wrapped the leftovers in a wheat tortilla and added fresh tomatoes and cheese. It was wondeful. Next time I make it i'll add tomatoes to the whole batch.

The only changes I made to this were to throw in some green pepper and 1 can of Ro*tel.  I also only used 1 can of black beans.  I like it, but something's missing.  Next time I think I'll add some fresh pico de gallo and some more seasonings.  It's good though.

This was the first time I ever cooked with quinoa, and this recipe is awesome!  I made this for my boyfriend and I because we are trying to eat more vegetarian meals, and we both really loved it.  My changes: one can black beans, chicken broth, and a can of drained diced tomatoes when quinoa is cooking.

I was so happy to see some recipes with Quinoa on this website, and this recipe didn't disappoint.  I thought this was a wonderful side dish.  I used 1 can of black beans as previous reviewer's had suggested and used granulated onion powder instead of real onion so the husband would eat it.  The spice level was perfect and the sweetness of the corn combined with the earthiness of the black beans was wonderful with the quinoa.  This will become a regular side dish in our home.  Thanks!

Perfect as is, but I added more garlic and onion (to my taste) and used flat leaf Italian parsley.  This recipe is proof that vegetarian food does not have to be tasteless and boring.  Delicious.

First time trying quinoa and this recipe was great.  Very easy to make and tasty!  Followed others' suggestions and used only 1 can of beans for the full recipe.  Also added some chili powder and onion powder to the spice mix.  We had it with a dollop of sour cream and the cilantro.  Though next time, I will skip the cilantro...the strong taste overwhelms the flavors in this dish.  And we don't normally mind cilantro!

This is really yummy. I only used one can of beans, I think 2 would have been too much. I added addtional seasoning... some garlic powder, chili powder and more cumin. I think it was a little bland without it. Very healthy and tasty. I definitely recommend it!

I enjoyed this dish - excellent blend of flavors (spices are perfect!) and very interesting texture.  I couldn't decide how to eat it so I piled it onto a plate, had half on it's own with a fork, and used the rest as a sort of dip for tortilla chips.  I'll be making this again!  Thanks, Hilary.

I finally took the plunge and tried quinoa. I halved the recipe and it turned out great. The quinoa did a wonderful job of absorbing the flavors. The black beans and corn kept it from being too spicy hot. And I love anything with cilantro in it. Easy, flavorful, different and healthy!

We are not vegetarians, but are trying to eat healthier.  Bought my first box of quinoa three weeks ago and have had pilaf twice which we liked.  Today I made a 1/2 recipe of Quinoa and Black Beans for lunch.  Served it with corn bread and a side of tomatoes.  Enjoyed it very much.  Will not be my last time to make this for lunch.  Next time I will make the full recipe so I will have some left over.

Tasty, easy and flexible. I halved the cayenne for my not-so-spicy husband and added dried cilantro at the same time as the quinoa to simmer, which gave it a very fresh taste.

This is a delicious recipe. I had in in a wrap with sour cream and shredded low fat cheese. I'm not a big fan of cayenne, and I found it had a bit of a cayenne aftertaste. Definitely will make it again.

This recipe is very tasty. I only omitted the corn kernels, but followed everything else to this recipe and it is awesome. I will definitely make this dish again. It makes a good side dish with grilled meats, but I've been eating it by itself for my lunches. Very heathy and tasty. Vegetarians will love this dish. If you like couscous, you'll love quinoa.

I used this recipe to make the Make-Ahead Lunch Wraps, adding some zucchini and shredded cheese. They are very good and it makes tons of them. I am still eating them 6+ months later! The quinoa was a bit too wet after the stated time.

Delicious!  Next time I will use only one can of black beans so I can taste more of the quinoa.  Introduced it to a friend who never ate quinoa and now she's searching every grocery store and whole foods market for some!

Delicious!  This was the first quinoa recipe I ever tried. Since then, I've brought it to picnics and it's always a hit because it compliments other dishes well.  It's a great vegetarian recipe. The only thing I'd do differently is cut the amount of beans in half, as someone previously suggested.

Yummy!  Due to availability, we used red quinoa and replaced the frozen corn with half a can of creamed corn.  
This recipe is really good, fast and flexible.  I'm so glad to have found it.

I have made this dish several times.  My picky 6 yr old tolerates it, my 2 yr old gobbles it up and the grownups like it too.  I like to use fresh corn because raw corn is so tasty.

This recipe was super easy to follow and made a very tasty dish. I used dried Cilantro, instead of fresh and it worked okay. It would probably be better with fresh. I thought this was a very nice introduction to quinoa, which I had never before cooked.

This recipe was good I thought I made it as directed. But I found I needed more liquid and that the quinoa was cooking fast.  Then I realized that I had used couscous instead of quinoa.  It was still very good.

This is one of my favourite recipes and it’s so simple! Another thing I like do is, with any leftovers I turn them into healthy black bean burgers! I just add breadcrumbs, an egg, chilli powder (optional), salt to taste, mix together and pan fry. Serve with your choice of toppings and voila! Now you have a new easy meal!

This is a fantastic recipe. My husband, who had never tried quinoa before, truly enjoyed it as well. Great texture and plenty of flavor. We added a little shredded cheddar cheese to the end product and gobbled it up. :)

Oh my gosh!!! I followed the recipe completely. This recipe is always a hit with my vegan friends. It goes well on a soft shell tortilla as well as by itself. I did add just a little more veggie broth as the quinoa soaks it all up.

This dish was a huge hit at my house. Even my picky eater ate it and had a second helping. It was also very filling. I took the advice of others and rinsed my quinoa, used chicken stock because I didn’t have vegetable stock, rinsed canned corn and left out cilantro (I really dislike cilantro and that’s why I left it out). It’s going to be a new dish in our dinner lineup.

Loved it, and loved that it's so healthy, too! I would make it a tiny bit spicier and add a little salt, maybe 1/2 a teaspoon. Like others, didn't even use a whole can of black beans, and it was already too much for me. Left out the cilantro because I can't stand it, but I'm sure that's what gives everyone else an extra punch. Great little side dish, and it makes a good amount, too.

This was amazing, easy and quick!!!  I did use chicken broth, what I had, and a full bulb of garlic, we are garlic lovers.  I also waited to add the garlic until shortly before adding the broth.  Because I watched the video, I learned that I should rinse the quinoa to remove the oils that can make it bitter.  That was a great help!  Love the tips in the recipe videos!  My husband loved this and I will definitely be making it again.  I will probably give some of the review suggestions a try as well, but definitely yummy just as it is.

I was skeptical of this recipe but it was surprisingly delicious! I omitted the corn because I'm not a big fan of it and it's not much nutrition wise anyways. Would highly recommend this recipe!

It was fairly easy to make, and it tasted good. It did remind me of the protein steamer bags I buy from the grocery store. I would probably just buy those next time.

Made as directed and it turned out great! I used dried black beans so I had to soak overnight, then cook the beans. Canned beans come already cooked. Since the corn was frozen and the beans were not warm, I feel like the dish could have been hotter. You can’t really cook it for much longer when you add those ingredients because all of the liquid is gone. Needs more salt than I added, and could use something extra to top it. We topped ours with slices of avocado and Himalayan sea salt. It was delicious! The avocado added just the right amount of fat.

Turned out great! But the quinoa cooks a lot faster than in 20 min. I’d say 10 min tops or you’re looking at a burned bottom of your pan/pot. I added only one can of black beans. I’ll be adding some chopped bell pepper to the onion mixture at the beginning!

This was excellent! I did do a bit of tweaking with seasoning to taste, used chicken broth, and added some sauteed celery, tomatoes, and finished with queso fresco, no cilantro  but next time will definitely include! Will definitely make over and over!

So yummy! Made some minor adjustments... Here’s what I did: I added 1 teaspoon of dried oregano with spices listed. I also omitted the corn (my son doesn’t like it) but used a diced red pepper instead. I put this in after quinoa was cooked. I also added a can of roasted, diced tomatoes with garlic (and all its juices). I added the can at the same time as the red pepper. I let this simmer to help soften the red pepper a bit. That’s it! My husband and son both devoured it!!! Super yummy. :)

Loved this recipe!
I agree with 2 previous reviewers suggestions: 
1) only one can of beans is necessary 
2) cook the quinoa and spices separately, and add it at the end with the beans and cilantro.
Also, I separate out a partial batch without cilantro for my family members who have that gene that makes it taste like soap. Me - I can’t get enough!

It was a huge hit at our family gathering.I think I tripled it and it was nearly gone ! It also fit well into my Noom diet. I never had quinoa before, but this recipe started me on the road to making it my favorite, better than rice.

Really tasty, great for lunch on the go! I used no salt added chicken broth (what I had on hand) and only one can of beans. I think with the lower sodium broth it would be much reduced in the sodium dept. the flavour is huge for just a few simple ingredients. I will definitely make again! Thank you!

This came out great and was super easy to make. I did not have frozen corn so I used a frozen mix of corn/edamame/red peppers. Can't wait to make this again.

I loved it. Used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and added sauted green and red bell peppers at the end because I left out the cilantro, which I dislike.

I already had some basic quinoa made so I wanted to spice it up. This was perfect. I just added about a half cup of broth and didn’t need to let it simmer the whole 20 minutes. I only had one can of black beans but kept all the same amount of spices and added in about a cup of the cooked quinoa. I served it in a bowl with a scoop of mild organic salsa on the side to help cool it down, then put some avocado on top. Loved it and now there’s some left over for the next couple of days.

Delicious. I halved the recipe as there are just two of us.. I was out of cilantro, but added a small chopped jalapeño with the onion. Will certainly make again. Served with crisp snow peas.

I made half the recipe, just the two of us, and it's plenty, plus left overs.  I sauteed the onions then added the quinoa and let it toast a bit then added the garlic,  I used a can of red kidney beans, because that's what I had, and added a can of green chili's.  Plus the corn I used was a leftover grilled corn on the cob. Very yummy!  I've made this dish many times and it always come out great

I followed the recipe exactly. Some reviewers only used 1 can of black beans but 2 cans is just right. Enjoyed it. Will make it again.

I started Vegan about two months ago and this stuff is constantly on hand.  I eat it cold with crumbled Feta and half an Avocado.  Afterwards I pay homage to the food God's for putting this in my life.  Oh, and it's healthy.  Pretty much a trifecta here; delicious, easy and nutritious.

Mmmmmmmmm!  This isn’t the kind of dish I’d normally make but since the only ingredient I had to buy was cilantro I decided to give it a try.  I used homemade turkey stock instead of vegetable and one can of black beans, those were my only changes.  I was surprised at how much of a kick the 1/4tsp of cayenne brought to this dish - I’m glad I didn’t go with my instincts and add more!  Absolutely delicious.

I made some modifications, but this was delicious. Started everything as instructed (heavy on the garlic), but instead of straight Quinoa, I got the Minute Rice Quinoa & Wild Rice mixture... two envelopes of that required more vegetable broth than above, but I just eyeballed it... maybe 2 1/2 cups? Also, changed the add-ins to one can of black beans and one can of corn. Added some covered cooking time in 5 minute increments until the rice/quinoa was the desired tenderness, I think it as a total of 25 or 30 minutes. Finally, added dried parsley instead of fresh cilantro (we don’t like cilantro) and added about 4 oz of Feta cheese in the last 5 minutes which bound everything together and smoothed out the taste. Delicious!

Great recipe, and easy (even for me!). I varied it a little bit - used only 1 can of black beans, and chopped up some walnuts to give it a nice crunch. Will definitely make again.

Be careful with the salt. My first effort was too salty. Next was better - about 1/2 teaspoon and I used (cooked) dry beans which are less mushier and more salty than canned beans.

I used vegetable  broth instead of oil and reduced the amount of spice to suit my family's tastes. Really good served with sauteed mushrooms and a salad!

Either I used the wrong measuring spoon, or this is meant to be quite spicy. I love it, but will make it less hot next time.  Adding chicken would be nice too.

I love this recipe, but found that at least another cup of fluid is needed to expand the Quinoa fully. Vegetable broth and a bit of parsley really helps to bring out the flavour. A bit of Hosin sauce is a wonderful addition drizzled on top before eating.

This was a good way to get tons of fiber and protein into a dish. My only complaint is that the spices were very muted. I also like in-your-face flavor, so maybe the spice ratios are perfect for many. I topped it with salsa and it was pretty good.

I doubled the quinoa and broth but left the other ingredients as they were, which made the perfect ratio. We added a bit of Frank’s to our bowls and it was awesome! My meat-loving husband even agreed that this can go in our regular dinner rotation!

I made this for a work potluck because my co-workers are mostly Indian vegetarians. Everyone loved this recipe. I used tri-color quinoa and slightly less beans because it looked like it was going to flood the pan.

My wife LOVES this with salsa.  I have to admit it is made for salsa.  I however made it for the nutrition content, and salsa would wreck my intent.  While I liked the dish, it's not my favorite (really don't like cumin spice).   High in fiber (7.8g) low in sugar (2g) this is exactly the kind of foods my internist wants me to eat (to keep diabetes and hypertension at bay) 

So yeah - I'll be making this again.

One of my favorite recipes. I always cube a chicken breast and cook it with the onions. We like spicy, so I add some peppers too. Quick and easy meal

I added chopped tomato. I would add more cilantro next time. Easy recipe to add or subtract. I didn’t have any cayenne pepper in hand but it was yummy anyway.

I recently discovered a Southwest Black Bean Quinoa mix by a company called Urbane. The store I bought it at can't ever keep it in stock, so I was desperate to find a replacement. Enter: This recipe. I made it exactly as written (reduced it by half), and it's freaking PERFECT. Reminds me of a Cafe Rio or Qdoba or Chipotle burrito mix. I put mine on a whole wheat tortilla with some cheese and sour cream and it makes for the best vegetarian burrito ever.

Not flavorful enough to be a side on its own. However, with the addition of some salsa or by adding it to a morning omelet, it has some potential.

Never cooked Quinoa before, but based on my family's feedback, I will make this yummy dish again!  I severed it as a side dish with lemon pepper, garlic and rosemary baked boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  The leftovers can be eaten as a meal.  Thumbs up!

Super tasty and easy!  Like many others, I feel one can of beans is plenty.  Love bringing leftovers for lunch...it tastes just as great cold!  Nice on those hot summer days.  I also like to add a squeeze of fresh lime to brighten it up a bit.

Absolutely delicious in the photo I may have adulterated it a bit with eggs and a little sour cream but I wouldn’t have written a review at all if I didn’t like it perfectly fine by itself. I did make two swaps 1 was the oil. I used coconut and 2 was chicken broth as I didn’t have vegetable broth on hand at the time. Incredibly delicious and very nutritious this one is a keeper. Herbs on eggs are dill and parsley. No salt was added other than what was in the canned beans and the broth.

I changed the measurements to 1 cup quinoa and one can of vegetable broth. What was I going to do with half a cup of vegetable broth? Then I upped the spices accordingly.  I usually read reviews and consider changes but did not this time.   Rinsing the quinoa would probably be a good idea.

I made a few changes, used beef broth, and added precooked chunks of beef. And added some extra corn, some spices. But all-in-all this recipe is delicious.

Have made it many times. Got a lot of compliments.  Once added chicken thighs that have been baked with a chicken rub, then cut up in small pieces.  Good both ways.

Excellent work week lunch solution! I’ve made this several times and packaged it into 5-days worth of lunches. Also, I have made this with farro as well (instead of quinoa)—makes it a bit more substantial as a stand alone meal.

This  is absolutely delicious.  I added a little more broth, and I used chicken broth as opposed to vegetable broth.  The cayenne pepper adds great flavor.  This is one of my new favorite recipes and I will be making it often, it makes a great side dish.

I add a little paprika to mine, and a little less beans.  Sometimes I make it with chicken broth and put chili lime chicken on top which I think adds a good flavor, but is no longer vegetarian as the downside.

I did not have vegetable broth, so I used chicken broth.  My husband used wheat thins to scoop this up.  He ate it!!  Great as a meal by itself.  Will make again.

Really good recipe. As others stated, this might not be substantial enough for a main dish. I also added some lime juice after tasting it, it sparked it up a little bit. Also, don't add 2 cans of black beans. One is just fine, especially with the extra protein in the quinoa.

Great combination of ingredients. I liked it but my husband wasn't too thrilled. Its different but healthy so I'll be eating the rest. Its an acquired taste for those trying to change eating habits for the better.

Excellent. It’s a go-to for my wife and I. We serve it as a side dish for Tortilla Lime Tilapia. Paired with a Corona! 

Question: What quantity is a serving? Need to add to MyFitnessPal.  Thanks

I’m so excited to find this recipe! Everyone in the family likes it, it’s healthy, its easy. It’s a make-ahead and reheat, and definitely make extra for leftovers. Like others, I rinsed the quinoa—something I wish I’d known a long time ago—and there wasn’t any bitterness, and I increased the spices, garlic, and onion to 1-1/2 the recommended amount and it’s just right. I added half a cup of medium chunky salsa along with the cilantro—it gave it just a hint of tomato and I’m sure I’ll be trying many more variations in the future. It’s a keeper.

Super easy and very tasteful. My wife showed me this recipe and has made it at least a half dozen times. The only recommendation I would make is to only add one can of bean. Two cans seems to be overkill (Oh, two suggestion...can corn works just as well as frozen corn). But with one it gives the salad a nice balance of flavor, texture and color.

As many reviewers have said, this is a very easy, quick & tasty recipe.  I didn't have vegetable broth on hand so I used chicken broth in it's place.  My husband is not a fan of quinoa but he actually liked it.  I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe is very delicious. The only thing that I altered was that I used a bit more cayenne pepper because of my love for spicy food. I’m doubling the recipe next time for my meal preps.  Two hymns way up!!

This is great side dish!  I made a few changes based on past cooking experience.  I set aside about a 1/4 cup of uncooked, minced onions and soaked them in red wine vinegar.  Then after cooking the quinoa and letting it cool off, I strained the uncooked onions and added them to the quinoa along with black beans and canned corn.  The vinegar soaked onions gives this dish a little zest and texture :)

The hubs and I loved this dish.  My daughter is 8 so it's still in her DNA to hate new things.  I used a pad of butter instead of oil and only used half of a large onion.  I tripled the garlic and added garlic and onion powder as well.  ONE CAN OF BEANS IS ENOUGH.  I actually wanted to taste the quinoa.  We'll definitely be adding this to our regular side dishes.

WOW,  Today is the first day of our vegan diet and I choose this meal as your main dish. I'm very full now. I didn't even know what quinoa was.  I didn't add all the corn because I'm not crazy about it. I also added a can of rotella instead of the second can of beans.  I added some fresh oregano. I also added a lot more water while it was cooking because it didn't seem like it was tender enough.  Many reviewers  said it need more flavor so I made sure there was enough cumin, salt and pepper.  I added the cumin late but not sure if that made a difference.  At the end I served fresh cut tomato's and lots of avocado on the top. My boyfriend SHOCKED me when he said it's one of the best meals I have ever made including all the beef and chicken that he loves so much.  I can't wait to make it again.

I found this looking for new whole grain recipes and am really glad I tried it. I only used one jar of beans and added a diced bell pepper, but other variations are easy to imagine. Very satisfying, nutritious, and really tasty!

There is no where on the directions where it says to soak the quinoa. Unless you watch the video, then it briefly mentions something about soaking it but even then it’s so quickly said you may miss it. This has a lot of things in it that are normally very hard without cooking a LONG time. The black beans, the quinoa and even the frozen corn. So to throw this stuff in a pan and not have it already cooked a little makes it come out quite crunchy or in my opinion....disgustingly hard. They call it “aldente”. I call it uncooked and nasty. So although this was a HUGE problem for me....I still opt to give this recipe 4 stars bc I don’t want to discourage anyone from making this. It has very good seasonings and tastes wonderful aside from the hard thing I just explained. So if I made it wrong....I apologize. I don’t know how I could have not made it correct though because I followed the instructions well and to the “t” so to speak. Idk what else to say. lol.  Good recipe. Just know that if you like your veggies cooked and not hard and gross you should maybe precook some of these ingredients first.

It was healthy and good tasting but I don't think I would make it again.

We added 1 cup additional Vegetable Broth just before adding the corn because the quinoa was drying out and was sticking to the pan.  Our family used spicy black beans and felt it didn't need any salt or pepper added.  We will be making this again.

I've made this several times and it's always very popular. I don't usually change a thing, except that if I'm feeling lazy I use garlic powder instead of garlic. So easy, healthy and tasty.

It was great!  Made it many times now. If you love black beans use the amount here but I used 1 can (15.5 oz) and it was perfect as well. I tried it both ways and the recipe is delicious.  Each time I made it for company the entire dish was GONE... the best compliment any cook can have for a recipe!

This is soooo tasty and healthy. I don't feel guilty going back for seconds. Best thing is it is so versatile that if you don't have ingredients it's super easy to substitute or omit all together or add what ever you like

I liked everything about this recipe. I followed other's advise and added only one can of black beans, and I used beef broth instead of vegetable broth because it is more flavorful. This could be made with rice just as well. You can leave out the cilantro, but I like it.

This recipe is good.  The favor is a little bland but not surprising for quinoa.  Overall, I was very pleased with this healthy recipe and will definitely make it again.  I will probably experiment with adding a bit more zest, perhaps red pepper, to provide just a tad more zing!

This is a fast, delicious and healthy recipe! I have made it several times the 1st time I omitted the cayenne pepper because I didn’t want it to taste spicy and it was still good but I added it the 2nd time as well as a 1/2 can petite diced tomatoes(with juice) because I like tomatoes! The cayenne pepper does not make it spicy but really gives it more flavor! I love this recipe because it’s both healthy and fast!

It was good.  Needs more spices as it was a little bland for my taste.  I would also add one can of black beans instead of two.

I used less cayenne pepper than the recipe listed because I have "overdone" the cayenne pepper on other recipes I have made in the past.  
After reading the reviews, I followed the suggestions made:  I rinsed the beans well to avoid bitterness.  I also used just one can of black beans.  This tasted great hot and cold!

Not bad, just painfully bland.  Even after I added green chilis and some tomatoes.  Might be a good base/starter, but needs something to zip it up.

Great recipe, I followed it completely except only used half the amount of black beans, and added one medium chopped sweet potato (before the onion/ garlic).  Turned out great, but think next time I will double the cilantro and cut the onion/garlic cook time at least by half.

New to quinoa and loved this recipe! I cut the beans to 3/4  can and reduced the cayenne to taste. For my picky husband, I thinly sliced leftover steak. Rolled it up in a burrito. Perfect for vegetarians and meat lovers. Yum!

It was wonderful! I severed it with steak and it was quite tasty. I only used a pinch of cayenne pepper and used parsley instead of cilantro as that is our choice.

This was a really good dish. For a minimum amount of work. The only change I made was to add a little bit more cayenne, but we like spicy.  The dish would be fine though with the suggested amount.  It makes a lot! I will make it again.

This is a very flexible recipe. I add some chicken and whatever veggies i have on hand (bell pepper, tomato, etc) and it is always good. I went extra heavy on the spice once and it came out with a very pleasant heat.

Great recipe, I made it and served it cold at a picnic, everyone loved it. Several people commented they never ate quinoa before and really like this recipe! The only change I made was substituting paprika for cayenne pepper (I was out) and two ears of fresh corn instead of frozen.

Easy to make! I had some friends over and this recipe was great with the honey mustard chicken I prepared. I used fresh basil (2 teaspoons vs. 1 teaspoon dried) and light red kidney beans  vs black beans. I think that I would prefer this version because of the meatier taste of the beans in comparison to the black beans. I also left out the cayenne pepper (because I don't like spicy, hot stuff).

Too dry and too tasteless.  Needs much more flavour - not necessarily hot but flavour.  The quinoa soaks up a lot of the broth and while it flavours the quinoa, it leaves the whole dish wanting and dry.

Very nice healthy option for a southwestern side dish and amazingly simple to make! Used fresh parsley instead of cilantro and gave it a squeeze of lime. Perfect accompaniment to some southwestern/Mexican grilled chicken! Will definitely make again and again.

It was so delicious and simple.  I did use 1 can of kidney beans and only 1 can of black beans because I didn't realize the one was red until too late!  I  like the black beans better, but for a huge crowd and doubled or tripled recipe,  I think I'll substitute one can of red beans for the color.  I also added 1 tablespoon of lime juice same time as the frozen corn plus garnished with a chopped avocado, borrowing from another recipe.  I can see where the additions weren't absolutely needed, but my husband and I really liked these additional flavors!  Plan to make this for a party coming up!

We LOVED this!  I  just used 1 can of black beans and it was perfect.  Both my husband and I felt if there were 2 cans of black beans, they would've overpowered the dish.  I rinsed the quinoa briefly, but didn't let it soak and the flavor was great.  I did notice the quinoa was a little more dense, so I'm not sure if it was because I rinsed it or because it cooked too long?  Either way, it was delicious and really good cold as well!  I'll be making this a lot more!!

This was easy to make and very delicious. The onion and garlic and cumin were perfect in this dish. They did not overpower the quinoa. This has become a fast favorite.

We are trying to cook meals that are healthier. I have a hard time with quinoa it's difficult for me to get used to but I will say that this recipe is very flavorful the cumin is very prevalent and is tasty. The cilantro adds good flavor as well. I do miss my rice but this is a good healthy alternative. Only gave three stars because it just didn't hit a home run for me because I am used to eating very unhealthy.

This one's a keeper. I need to accommodate vegetarians, gluten free people, dairy free people, and kosher people, and this is one of the few dishes they all agree is delicious. It's a go-to veggie entree for me now.

This is a great dish, I make it all the time. It's delicious and very easy. I only use 1 can of beans, it's enough.

this recipe is fantastic. I really enjoy cooking, but find i have limited time now a days. I read several of the reviews and heard concerns about it being bland so I too used the chicken stock for the base instead of water, I doubled the amount of spices and added two packages of sliced mushrooms to the dish during the simmering process. Let me tell you it came to fantastic and I will be sampling other vegetables with it in the future like shopped broccoli. Thanks for a great recipe

I substituted vegetable broth for two teaspoons of Mrs.Dash with two and a half tablespoons extra of water. Soaked in hot water and strained. That was vegetable broth. As other reviews, I increased the quinoa by 1/2 cup. I put the beans and  quinoa in at the same time. Oops. Then... I read the reviews one I dumped the beans in out of sequence. It was a hit and loved by all at my work potluck. This dish was cleaned out.. Mixing the beans with quinoa together gave it a bit of a texture change (smooth) and blended the flavours together. I will try this recipe again, and cook quinoa first. I believe it will be a completely different experience . Enjoy!

Will most certainly make this again but will half the recipe unless I'm making it for a large group. I use 1 can of beans and find that is plenty.

Delicious! My husband doesn't like cilantro and he thought this was "pretty good." That's a high rating from him. We served it with boiled shrimp and it paired well. I had it for lunch the next couple of days and it was filling and tasty.

My first time making anything with black beans and this was  fantastic. I rinsed the beans and I eyeballed spice amounts. I will absolutely make this again.

Btw for people who get upset about others who don't follow the exact recipe should relax a little. Cooking is a free form art and people are allowed to admire a great base recipe in which they played off. Some people need a little less or more flavor. Or they don't have the exact ingredient, that shouldn't stop them from admiring a great base recipe.

Really enjoyed this.  Only added one can of black beans.  I think I overcooked the quinoa and onions a bit, they were beginning to get a little mushy.  Overall a great, tasty recipe.  I'll cook it again.

I did follow other reviews by rinsing the quinoa I also only used one can of black beans.  Since I cook with chicken broth a lot I substituted for the vegetable stock.  Very flavorful and easy to make.  One of my new favorite recipes!

This was my first time cooking quinoa.  I live at 7200 ft, so there was no way it got done in 20 min.  It took 45-50 min. and it still didn't look "popped open" like the picture shown.  I kept having to add liquid and cook it more.  Now I know.  Other than that, I thought it was really good.  The flavor went well with the chicken I served it with.  I can see mixing some sort of meat with it for a main dish, putting it into a wrap or pita with meat and/or veggies....the possibilities are endless!  Oh yes, I did substitute chicken broth because I didn't have veggie broth.  Certainly will make again.

Okay, don't laugh, but when I printed this out and made it, all the time I thought I was making a salad! Although the cooked quinoa was delicious with that cumin added, I ran with it because I wanted a cold salad. I cooled the quinoa, folded in the already chilled corn and beans, and diced a tomato for good measure. Surprise! A versatile dish! Very good cold! I'm giving only 4 stars because I goofed in the first place!

We loved this! I followed the easy directions but added about 3/4 c chopped red and green bell peppers and subbed chipotle powder for the cayenne. We like pinto beans so I used those. 1 can. Frozen corn. It was delicious!  I went back for seconds!

For someone who hates quinoa, I thought this recipe was quite good. I left out the cumin because yuck. I left out the cayenne because I don't care for the taste. I added a bunch of fresh red chili and lime juice instead and only used one can of black beans. I ate it for dinner tonight and can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Really really good dish! My husband is even liked it and is going to eat it hot. I like it cold. I used Trader Joe's low sodium vegetable stock and quinoa. Spicy black beans and sweet canned corn. Will be making this again and again!

This is the first time I've made quinoa and I have to say we really enjoyed the nuttiness of it. What made it even better was the addition of spices and onion, as well as the corn and beans. To be honest I thought I had done something wrong when, after 20 minutes of simmering the quinoa, it wasn't translucent like it should be and there was quite a bit of liquid left.  But I just simmered it a little longer and then added the beans and it turned out fine.  The three of us really liked this (oh yeah, I halved the recipe) - my brother even put some of it on his baked potato and loved it.  Will be making again!

This is fantastic!  I made a couple of changes; mostly due to what I had on hand:  I used only one can of black beans, changed the veggie broth for chicken stock, I used red quinoa (rinsed first), and only about ¼ cups of cilantro :-( as I ran out in the middle!  Even with the small amount of cilantro this recipe is a keeper!  Next time I'd like to add red peppers. Yum!!!!

Well, I followed the recipe but mine didn't turn out that great. My daughter enjoyed it somewhat, but I guess it's mostly my fault. This is definitely one of those recipes where you need to have everything already out and prepared. It didn't turn out terrible, but I thought it was kind of whatever. Of course, this was my very first time making quinoa... I'll definitely make it again, though, since my daughter enjoyed it.

It WAS more flavorful than just black beans and rice. I used red Quinoa instead of white....just because I already had it and I used (1) can of  Cannellini Beans and (1) can of Black Beans because I only had (1) can of Black beans. I also used (1) can of corn instead of (1) C of frozen corn........Even with all the substitutions, it turned out great

This was a great side dish for our halibut dinner.  I used chicken broth because that's what I had on hand, and based on other reviews, reduced the black beans to one can.  I thought this was plenty.  I thought it was delicious, but my husband's response was "It tastes like any other quinoa dish."  I will be making it again, anyway.

This recipe is the bomb and it's actually pretty filling with the beans and quinoa. So tasty, super easy, very quick, extremely healthy, and easy on the wallet. 5-10 servings for like $20. Make this!

Made this last night for a side dish with Salmon. Both hubby and I loved it. I made it exactly as written, and the flavors were perfect. This side dish would taste great in a tortilla, a lettuce cup, or rolled up as a spring roll in rice paper. I will be making this again for sure!

This is a great healthy recipe! My boyfriend loved it and I had plenty of leftovers for the week. For enhanced onion and garlic flavor (which I prefer), cook them for 2 minutes before adding the quinoa instead of 10.  I also used one can of beans instead of two which turned out to be the perfect amount of beans for us.

I didn't have onions, so I used chopped carrots instead. I used powdered onion (1 tablespoon) to try and get that onion flavor that was missing. I wasn't sure how it would turn out since I've never had carrots with quinoa, but it was great! The sweetness of the carrots balanced the spiciness of the cayenne pepper well and replaced the crunchiness that was missing from my omission of the onions.

I used olive oil and only one can of beans.  I also had to add extra liquid. Everything cooked faster for me than the times that were listed. My stove & pans are brand new so this could be the reason. Garlic & onion ready in 5 minutes. Quinoa was done in 12 minutes. I served this with cilantro/lime guacamole, plantain chips, and chicken breast slow cooked with taco seasoning/broth. Very good.

Very delicious! I omitted the onion, garlic &  green bell pepper. Instead I used red, orange & yellow bell peppers. Added lime juice, red wine vinegar and olive oil, not vegetable oil. Soooo good! This makes a lot and I'm the only person in my house who will eat it, so I  put half in freezer in 1 cup portions for lunches later. Not sure how the quinoa will freeze, though.

Loved this recipe! Easily adaptable to an Instant Pot, too. I used a bulgar/quinoa mix I had on hand, and used 1/4 tsp of salt and pepper each.

This was very very good! Clearly surpassed my expectations! The kids and the wife said "That tastes exactly like Chipolte!" Have made it with pimentos and a little lemon juice and it is very hard to quit eating!

This was great. I have an 8 year old picky eater, and she had seconds! This was the first time I made quinoa, and I will definitely make this again.  I did take the advice of other reviews, and cut the beans in half.  But, I followed the rest of the directions exactly.

This dish is absolutely amazing! I was in the market for something a little different than my basic (but equally amazing) grandma's recipe. I also wanted to try to cook something that I've never had before, which would be the quinoa. I'm so happy that this is the recipe that I chose. The flavoring from the spices were perfect! The original recipe's ingredients were reduced to accommodate feeding my fiancé and I.  We had this as a side dish paired with a couple of baked lemon-pepper chicken breasts, and WOW; I look forward to cooking and eating this again, and my fiancé was equally pleased with the result of the dish. We both agreed that this dish could easily be a main dish on its own. VERY GOOD! WE BOTH HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!

Love this! Gave it 4 stars because I ommited the second can of beans as per recommendation and turned out awesome. Two cans would have been too much.

We are hosting a dinner, and one guest is gluten-free, so I thought I'd try this recipe has a side. I only had red onion, so I chopped it finely and added it with the beans at the end. Delicious, my family and guests loved it, and they are picky.

First time making Quinoa.
Somewhat disappointed with the grain as it does not swell up at all. This recipe is useful as a side dish - not a main Vegan course. I was not impressed overall.
Suggest limiting diced onion to 1/2 cup.
Suggest limiting cayenne to 1/4 tsp per recipe - or less. I like spicy food and this recipe is pretty spicy as it is.
Cumin amount is perfect.
I used only one  15 oz can of black beans and it was enough.
Did not add Cilantro as I detest it's taste.

The whole family loved it including the little ones! It has a little spice but they didn't mind. I topped mine with a little extra cilantro and followed others that said one can of black beans and it was perfect. 2 would have been way too many!

This was super easy to make and super delicious!  I only needed one can of black beans.  I cooked the quinoa ahead of time so I could just throw all of the ingredients together and it was amazing!  I always cook my quinoa in some sort of broth and all a little olive oil.  Maybe that's why some people were saying it was bland.  Anyway, I don't like rice too much but this would be good with rice if you prefer.

I will definitely be making this weekly.. I am dairy-free and vegetarian but this is a dish that my whole family loved! So happy I had every single ingredient in my house to make this tonight. Wow.. So good! Although I only had red quinoa, it still was so yummy. 
I mixed the cilantro with the black beans and lightly seasoned them with salt & pepper.

I've made this recipe so many time and people just love it!  The only change I've made to it is I add a little cilantro to cook with the quinoa and I use chicken broth half the amount and the other half I add coconut milk.

This is ok but better if you let it sit in the fridge overnight .
It's kind of bland following this recipe to the T so give it your own flavor
I replaced one black bean with a garbanzo bean can.
Also I added a 1/4 cup cider vinegar at the end.
I'd also recommend cutting back on the cayenne a bit
And of course enjoy a few beers with any experiment

My family loves this recipe!  Quinoa is an excellent source of protein and goes very well with the black beans, which is also full of protein! The cumin gives it a great flavor too!  We meal prep very Sunday in our house and this is a great recipe for that process! Easy to make!

I think it taste great! I only did half an onion, and no fresh cilantro, but everything else was the same. I'll definitely make again.

I can't decide if I like this better hot or cold - it's great both ways!  For dinner, I have it hot and serve with some veggies and a salad.  For lunch, I have it cold and serve with a salad.  I use olive oil and I've made it with and without the corn and I prefer it without. I think the cumin and cayenne really make this dish!  Delicious!

this was sooooo delicious! taste like a Mexican dish, very flavorful. I was worried it would be to spicy, but it wasn't. will most definitely make it again and again!  the only thing I did different was I used a can of corn rather than frozen corn.

This has a very solid, southwest feel, with the cumin and cilantro playing well into the black beans and quinoa. Not too spicy, not too bland. Would go well with a seared chicken or in a crunchy taco shell, either alone or with ground beef. I fought the urge to add in a cup of fresh, chopped roma tomatoes and a handful of lettuce to round it out into a southwest salad. I think I will do that next time with the chicken-very very good!!

YUM! I used all organic, non GMO ingredients. My only substitute was chicken broth instead of vegetable just because that is what I had in the fridge. It was easy, inexpensive (even going organic) and SUPER tasty. I loved the kick the cayenne pepper gave while complimenting the sweet corn. I am wondering if some of the folks that gave a bad review didn't rinse the beans? It really is a must do! Play with the amount of seasoning as you go along! I added garlic and onion powder as it is my belief that you can't go wrong with a little extra of both. Thank you for this wonderful and healthy recipe!

My family's favorite way to eat quinoa!  After preparing as written, it was great, but a bit spicy for us. Now, I only use 1 can of black beans, no cilantro and 1/8 t of cayenne pepper. It had just a hint of spice and is delicious!

I used chicken stock and charro style beans which added flavor. Otherwise prepared as directed, did not rinse or soak quinoa and it turned out fine. Will make it again!

I had a tomato I needed to use up so I added it to the chopped onion in the first step - it dissolved so much I barely noticed it - along with the spices and a bit of broth. I added the garlic in the last minute of the 10 minutes (to avoid it becoming burned and bitter). But otherwise followed the recipe as written - except, like others, using only ONE can of black beans. Not sure I will make it again.

Very good. Mine was slightly different because I don't cook with salt and I didn't have cilantro. But the rest was the same and I added some old fort cheese for some zing!!

Very good for healthy food.
I left out the cilantro and added about 50% more cayenne pepper.
I'm a novice cook and this is easy and fast and tastes pretty decent.

An excellent flavourful meal. I followed the recipe exactly as it is the first time. I cut back on the Cayenne pepper the second time making this because it was a bit spicy for a few family members. Don't be afraid to play around with the spices to get it just right for you.

Recipe is generally good, but agree with others who said the recipe lacks flavor.  I added a half cup of white wine, but it still needed more punch for me.  Agree with others that one can of beans is more than enough.  The prep time far exceeds what is stated.  I might try it again.

Loved this! Didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken instead. I don't buy  beans in cans (I cook them from dry), so used a cup and a half of cooked beans.  Added some extra cayenne because I like a bit more bite. Yumm.

A hearty meal and freezes well. I switch up the beans and the veggies and often through in whatever is in the fridge (peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, etc.). I also add chilli powder and some cayenne for spice. Works with other grains as well.

I Love this recipe! I made it exactly as is and it was Awesome!  I made this 4x already and would recommend it to anyone who loves quinoa and black beans. I went meatless for 40 days and this recipe saved me when I thought my life was doomed without having any meat. My Husband even loved it :)
Thank you for sharing 3Lions! I'm "Roaring" to make this again!

Made it as directed except I used chicken broth with no added salt and I added lime zest. 2 cans of beans is perfect. It is spicy so if you're making it for children keep that in mind when adding spice. Definitely a keeper and taste better the next day cold!

I did reduce the amount of black beans and boiled some dried beans instead of canned as that is what I had on hand.  It was flavourful and delicious.  I would certainly make it again.  Loved it!

I love this dish!  So healthy and tasty. I triple the amount of cumin, because I love cumin.  I reduce the black beans to one can, and add one sauteed yellow pepper and a can of Rotel tomatoes if I have them.  When I have zucchini, I add one small chopped zucchini too.  

Like someone else said, it's good hot or cold!  I had it hot for dinner last night and cold for lunch today.  Good stuff!

It was okay.  Next time I will put only one can of beans.  Two of them were a little too much.  It was just ok not a wow dish.  Great for the side dish.

This turned out even better than I expected! I followed the recipe pretty close, just added cajun seasoning and some tapatio. Then I made it into a main dish by putting some carnitas into it and making it into tacos. I will be keeping this in my arsenal for taco nights.

I had two changes. Due to not having fresh cilantro I used dried basil and I sauted chicken thigh and threw that in. It was great! This will be a staple meal in our household.

I made it without onions, cause I'm allergic. It came out excellent. I only used 1 clove of garlic, only a half a can of black beans,  a can of strained sweet whole kernel corn and NO cilantro. This is a perfect vegan dinner dish or a great side....

I used 1 tbsp of oil, a tsp seemed too skimpy. I added a red bell pepper and a small zucchini, I had them and wanted to bulk this up a little. I also used fresh corn, it's summer, I'm sure frozen will work fine in the off season. I only used one can of beans. I just realized I misread the cayenne pepper and added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper. It was spicy, but really good. I love this recipe and can't wait to try it cold tomorrow.

Loved this dish! Prep very easy! I used Rainbow quinoa because its what I had.  I think white quinoa is better for presentation.  My only change would be a little less Cilantro next time!

Love this recipe!!! Made it for dinner and it was a wonderful and refreshing dish. The only thing I changed was that I added some chicken which had been cooked in vegetable oil, cumin, and cilantro, to give it some extra protein.

This was a huge hit.!  I think it would make a delicious cold side too.  The only change I made was olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Will definitely make it again.

My husband and I love this dish.  
I use a cup of quinoa to two cups of water. 
I use canned sweet yellow corn in place of the frozen corn.
One can of black beans.
I use red pepper instead since I normally don't have cayenne pepper in the house.  I add it after the quinoa is cooked, and taste as I mix it in to our liking - we like it a spicier than the recipe gives.  
I also add more garlic and onion for more flavor. 
We normally allow it to cool in the refrigerator before serving for optimal flavor.   
I have made this many times and only once did it not turn out because I over cooked the quinoa and it was pretty mushy.  This is a go to meal for us, as its quick, easy and fairly cheap!

I couldn't love this anymore! I make it once a week and use it as a filling in veggie tacos, sprinkle it in salads, put it in celery sticks and it pairs amazingly with almost any chicken dish. I've even added chicken right to it! If I hadn't have discovered this recipe my super restrictive diet would have been torturous! Give it a try, then adjust it to your own liking even though it's perfect as-is!

This recipe was such a nice surprise.  I did cut the black beans in half and added a little green bell pepper. I only had chicken broth but I'm sure it would have been perfect just the way it was written. This will be on my favorite list.  Great flavors and healthy, too!!!

Second time I've made this but has to make little modifications each time but both were great! Made enough the second time around to eat during the week :)
I only used one can of beans since I saw using two cans would be too much. Using red onions every once in a while also adds a bit of a different flavors and color to it.

I  reset the ingrediants for 2 people, but added a whole can of black beans and a whole can of corn. Loved it more than I thought I would. It's full of taste, hearty, and fills you up.

I made this and it was pretty good! I used chicken broth instead of vegetable. I have made quinoa in the past with black beans but with this recipe the broth, onion and, especially the garlic gave it more flavor.  I used a larger can of black beans and a regular can of corn. I made this a second time without the broth (using water) and it was still just as, possibly even better, than with the chicken broth.

I will definitely make this again. I made some changes though. I didn't have any cumin on hand so I used chili powder. I couldn't find any cilantro so I used a few sprigs of rosemary. I added a fresh diced tomato at the end and some lemon zest. This is definitely one to add to my book.

This recipe is tasty! I followed the recipe except I used less beans. I also rinsed the quinoa. Definitely a new favorite. Super simple and quick. Topped it with a liitle shredded colby cheese and served it with grilled chicken.

I added a bit of lime and some more salt to it, it turned out perfectly and the lime added a nice zest to it which made it even better than it was before. Defiantly recommend putting lime into the quinoa. Made twice in a week

I made this recipe as written and love it.  To change it up just a little I'll sometimes add a squeeze of lemon or lime which is also fantastic!  I make a full batch (both cans of beans) and then put servings into small containers for an easy grab lunch.  It's just as good cold over top of lettuce as it is warmed up.  Easily becoming a standard in my home.

Frozen corn comes in a 12 oz package.  Since I didn't want leftover corn, I used the whole package.  I increased the quinoa to 1 cup and the veg broth to 2 cups.  I used a large Dutch oven on the stove so that it would easily hold it all and I would be able to mix it.  I added extra broth as needed so it wouldn't be too dry.  I used cilantro.  If you're not a fan of cilantro, you could use parsley instead, or maybe half of each.  For me this is a very good main dish, and I will be making it again.  Also, I used 2 cans of rinsed black beans and I browned a large chopped onion and then added the garlic.  It's very good !

I really enjoyed this recipe. If I made it again I would do less cayenne pepper (not for me, for my kids). I would also cook the Quinoa with a little more liquid. Overall, good recipe.

Really delicious! Only changes I make are to use one can of black beans and 1 cup of corn from a can or fresh (not frozen). I also add tomato sauce or fresh red bell pepper or diced fresh/canned tomatoes for color/taste! Thank you for the recipe!

This was wonderful.  I did saute a red bell pepper with the onions and garlic.  After that i added the seasonings to the saute pepper, onions and garlic.  I allowed the seasonings to intensify with the heat. I believe it makes a difference.  Before i ate it i sliced an avocado on top. Yummmmmmy.   Thanks so much for this recipe

This was a good easy meal for a busy night.  It wasn't  the family's favorite.  But we will probably have it again.  Next time I'll add more spice to it.

This was fantastic! My bf didn't think he would like quinoa but he thought it was great too.  I rinsed the quinoa, though with much difficulty because my mesh strainer wasn't fine enough, so I resorted to swirling the quinoa in water and draining as carefully as possible.  I added bell peppers  (one half) to the onion, (half), then garlic.  Then added the quinoa with some tomato chicken broth (1-1.5 tsp granules). After the quinoa was almost done at 20 min, I added  shredded chicken (1-2 c), chopped tomatoes (2, could try a can of diced ), half a can corn, and 1 can of black beans.  I omitted the cayenne for my taste.  Sprinkled with cheese and sour cream to serve, would be great without it or just cheese (cheddar/mont jack).  Will make again for sure!

This was good but a bit too bland for my taste.  I made it as written but with one can of beans.  I tried adding some additional cumin, cayenne, and salt and pepper, then some paprika and lime juice as suggested by other reviewers.  What finally pulled it together was the addition of some chopped cherry tomatoes.  It's tasty and healthy.

Great recipe that needs a bit of refining: Halve the amount of beans, double the spices, consider using smoked paprika instead of cayenne, and add 1/2-1 tsp of turmeric. Also, when cooking quinoa, always rinse and soak it for 30 mins, then drain before using. Do this and you'll have no bitter or grassy taste, and the cooking time is shortened.

This dish was a hit with my picky family. I followed the recipe, but omitted one can of beans and added one diced red bell pepper at the same time as the onion. It looked beautiful and tasted even better than I expected it to. My kids thought it was a little spicy so I diced a couple of tomatoes and had them eat some tomato with each bite. That solved the problem and they gobbled it up. I will definitely be making this regularly!

This is a great veggi dish as a side or even a main.  I have made it several times and to different spice levels. I just made a large batch and have frozen some of it.  Will see how the Quinoa holds up.  Its simple and a great mix of fiber and protien.

We loved this meal. Agree with most others that one can of black beans is all that is needed. Also would only use about 1/2 an onion. We added chopped avocado and ate it wrapped in tortillas. Delicious!

Fantastic. Used sprouted quinoa and added roasted zucchini as another user suggestion. Didn't change anything else. Will be making this often for sure. Might try adding different veggies to the mix, but this is a fantastic base. Ate it by itself for a nutritious and filling meal.

It was okay, but not as flavorful as reviews led me to believe.  Just tasted like a bunch of things tossed together, as opposed to a real dish.  I won't make it again.

This dish was great. I added diced tomatoes with green chilies to the simmering quinoa and squeezed some lime on top to finish. I will definitely make it again.

this was so good! I did not have fresh cilantro so used dried. I am sure the fresh would be much better.  This was loved by even my 11 and 13 year old. We used chicken broth since I did not have vegetable on hand and only used 1 can of beans and it was perfect- so good! Served with shrimp tacos.

It was absolutely delicious! I used chopped cooked carrots instead of the frozen corn and added mushrooms to the sautéed onions/ garlic. It was incredible! I haven't finished eating and I had to write a review. Mmmm?? I love it. Enjoy??

This recipe tastes fantastic! I was a bit afraid to try and make it because of how much ingredients it required, but it really wasn't so bad. I only used 1 can of beans vs 2 and I'm glad I did because I think it would have been too much. It had just the right amount of spiciness for someone who doesn't like spicy foods. My boyfriend loved this dish and literally had 3 bowls! Really great, super filling and easy to learn.

I think this is a great healthy dish.  I added some diced chicken breast and some hot sauce while cooking to give it extra lean protein and a bit more of a kick.  Family favorite.

I liked this a lot, only it took more liquid than the 1 1/2 c of broth to completely cook the quinoa.  And unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought the seasoning was a little strong.

This is a lovely recipe! I made it the other day as a main dish, but it could also be served as a side dish. I'm not a big fan of cilantro so I left that out, but you could also add some fresh parsley or avacado slices on the top for some color. I used one small onion, but will probably use half next time. I could also see adding only one can of black beans, and maybe some grilled shrimp in the summer. Simple but wonderful, I plan on making this many times.

Love this recipe. I have made some adjustments which I think really add a nice zing and color to the dish. 

-I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth.
-I added some chopped up cherry tomatoes for a pop of color and nice flavor. 
-I also added a little squeeze of lime for some zing

I absolutely loved this. My wife however said it tasted "too healthy" and wouldn't eat it. So if you are a person who loves earthy flavors and healthy stuff, you will like this. But if not, it maybe "too healthy" for you too. I thought the flavor was amazing and this dish worked very well.

This is an excellent starter recipe.   I use 1 cup quinoa  2 cups water.  Add 2 smashed garlic cloves.  Cook 15 minutes.   Sauté 1/2 red onion, chopped garlic, chopped carrots in olive oil.  Add 1 tsp. cumin, dash of chayanne, salt, pepper after veggies are sautéed.  Drain beans and 1 can chopped tomatoes.  Mix all together when quinoa is done removing smashed garlic from the quinoa. Mix in cilantro if you have on hand.   I've also added chopped green chilies.

First time making quinoa. The recipe was easy to make. Turned out very flavorful even though I left out the cayenne pepper and cilantro, plus  I only had 1 can of black beans. Will definitely make this again and again.

So I deleted the cilantro, and corn and added chicken thighs cut into strips.  subbed chicken broth for the veg and didn't strain or rinse the black beans.  That made it pretty thick and savory.  Also, I think you could double up the cayenne pepper.  I garnished it with light sour cream and an avocado and holy  was it good!!!

This was delicious!  I served this with the tangy chicken fajita  recipe from this site and I ate mine like a burrito bowl.  I only used one can of black beans and chicken  broth because that is what I had.   My 10 year old asked me to please tell him I would be making this again!  So it's  keeper!

I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and green chiles to spice it up.  I then put some grilled chicken on the top with some grated cheese and baked until the cheese was browned.   Very good and works for a friend on a very limited diet.

Excellent. I enjoyed it as a stand alone meal. I used 1 can beans, 1 can corn, 8oz chicken broth, 1tbs butter, powders, but no cilantro in house. Really easy and zesty. Adding it to my rotation.

Absolutely amazing.  I could literally eat this every day. Is also good with home made taco seasoning, and I have added shredded chicken, also.  SO GOOD.

This was my first time making Quinoa. I made this recipe just as written except for the fresh cilantro because my local supermarket didn't have any. It was very good. My husband and I both liked it. My husband thought it had a little too much cumin for his taste so the next time I made it I only used 1/4 teaspoon of cumin.  I will continue to make this as a side dish. It tastes good and the quinoa is really good for you.

This recipe is perfect as written. I made no changes. I had not cooked with quinoa before so I was a little hesitant. We paired the black beans and quinoa with a fabulous steak. Such a wonderful change from the plain old steak and potato. Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe.

I followed the recipe with the exception of 1 of the two cans of black beans called for (per other reviews). Two cans would have been way too many black beans! I found the recipe to be very bland and disappointing.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make. It is great on it's own or in a tortilla shell substituting for taco's . I add more Black beans but that is because I love them. This is easy and inexpensive to make. Throw everything together and let it sit on the stove for about 20 minutes. It does make a decent amount so if it's just for two people I would cut the recipe in half.

I was looking for a quick meal with ingredients I had on hand. This recipes was AMAZING as written with exception of black beans...I too stopped at one can.  This was my main meal and was quite satisfying; healthy, filling, moist, flavorful with a little kick. I used a twist of smoked alder salt for added depth of flavor...delicious, will make again and again.

Kept the amts. the same as recipe and wasn't too much left over between the 2 of us as an entree.  Added juice from 1/2 lime at the end.  Used 1 can of rinsed black beans and EVOO instead of veg. oil

Like many others, this was my first time cooking and trying quinoa. Many of co-workers enjoy it so I was excited to try it. This dish was very flavourful and healthful. I love the combination of black beans, corn and cilantro. I'm crazy for cilantro so I added double of course, and I didn't have cumin so I used just a bit of curry. It still had a great flavour and my husband and I enjoyed it a lot! I topped it with some avocado but I also had the idea of serving it with a poached or fried egg as well as the avocado.  Definitely will be making it again.

This was very good, very flavorful. Simple list of ingredients, great results. Really quick to make too. Makes an excellent side dish. Only thing I changed was adding a little less than ONE can of beans. Two cans seems like too much.

After reading other reviews, I cut back to one can of black beans (it was plenty) and I used EVOO in place of vegetable oil.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. This was very tasty and was enjoyed by all, including my husband who is not a fan of quinoa!

Made with 1 can corn (341mL) and 1 can beans (540mL), turned out pretty good. Original would definitely have too many beans.

I've made this 3 times and it's now part of the weekly rotation. Like other reviewers I only used 1 can of black beans. I also added a can of Mexican style stewed tomatoes and a tablespoon of dried oregano, and substituted paprika for the cayenne pepper since my girlfriend doesn't like spicy. I combine the corn, beans, and tomatoes, and season with the oregano and paprika and cook in the microwave until heated through, then add the quinoa. I also add the cumin and quinoa to the onion mixture and let it cook a minute or 2 before adding the vegetable stock.

I always double the corn and saute it separately so it somewhat carmelizes and adds a nice sweet crunch.  I also add the salt at the very end.

It is really good. I didn't have cayenne so maybe that's the thing that's keeping this from being a 5 star. Didn't wash quinoa and had no issues with bitterness. Splurge for the fresh cilantro. It makes all the difference. Cheers!

SLAM DUNK!  This has instantly become a biweekly staple alongside spaghetti and meatballs and tacos!  It was easy to make, delicious, and healthy. 

I also used 1 can of black beans and that was enough.  Left garlic out :( for husband and taste was fine.  My teenage boys ate it, and they don't like anything!

This dish was pretty good . It had a nice flavor although we did up the spices as a couple other reviewers suggested . It tastes good cold and hot and is very simple to make . It can be used as a nice side dish or a main dish . It is something that I would make again . I think if I did I would add more corn ! (We also used a mixer of white and yellow corn , that gave it a nice flavor )

I made this for my family of 4.  (I did omit the beans because of of the kids), oh and I used Chicken Broth in place of Vegetable broth (it's what I had on hand).  This was such a big hit - I'm going to add this to my favorite recipes.  I can't believe how much everyone loved it.  I'll definitely double the recipe next time to have leftovers for a second meal.  I think I'll add the beans next time too- but with or without this was excellent!

I just love this dish and have made it 4 or 5 times, twice this week alone. Being a vegetarian, I am always in search of quality protein alternatives. This dish is so delicious as directed, cold or hot, but I used red quinoa, some chopped red bell peppers, a dab of sour creme and 1/4 or so avocado. It is so flavorful and nutritious. You can eat it as a main course or as an appetizer with some crunchy low cal chips, or even pile it on a tostada shell. It's very "Tex-Mex" fresh. Don't forget the cilantro if you like it...it makes it so delish.  Make sure to properly rinse and drain (a few times) the quinoa through a fine sieve before adding to the pot.

This is the recipe we've been looking for!  Simple and functional and healthy. After reading the reviews, we made the following variations to the recipe and it came out delicious! We rinsed the quinoa first. We doubled the batch for leftovers, so we used the two cans of black beans and doubled the quinoa (we used tri-color). We used 4c of vegetable broth when all was said and done for cooking the quinoa. We upped the ground cumin and cayenne pepper. We added a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes. At the end, we squeezed lemon into our individual  bowls as well as added chopped/crumpled feta cheese. We also sprinkled more cilantro on top. Amazing depth. Yum!

I LOVE this recipe! My husband thought he didn't like quinoa until I made this dish for him. Now he asks me for this all the time! 
Here are our changes to the recipe though:
•We use the water that you typically drain out of the corn and bean cans instead of broth.
•We add lightly-seasoned shredded chicken.
•We eat it with tortilla chips for a little crunch and extra saltiness.

This was actually tasty.  It's not spicy at all, so up the cayenne if you want more of a kick.  I used only 1 can beans, and chicken broth because that's what I had.

Easy, delicious, and can be frozen too. However, I seem to have trouble keeping quinoa in the liquid without it being too soggy.

Four stars only because I didn't  totally follow the recipe, but I'm sure it would have been good. I used brown rice because I didn't have quinoa. I only made half, and didn't measure anything besides the rice/broth ratio and I added bits of turkey sausage to make it a main course. I made the rice, added a sautéed onion and garlic, microwaved beans and corn, and spices. It was really  good!

always make this dish once in a while. using only 1 can of black beans is more than enough and I also use corn cream can instead. it gives a nice sweet and cumin mix kick with rice.

This was my first time cooking/tasting Quinoa, it was also my first time using fresh cilantro and/or daring to put a black bean in my mouth. But even with all my "firsts" this was simple enough to make and tasted pretty good (I do think I used to much cilantro because it overpowered the cumin -- so will  cut down the next time I make it. I am a VERY picky eater and the fact that I will make this again say's A LOT!!! I only used one can of black beans and it was a lot so for me I think 2 would be too much.

Love it! I made a few changes: put in one can of black beans instead of two and substituted parsley for the cilantro. Also added a pinch of cinnamon. I served it in tortilla wraps with avocado and grated cheddar and a touch of hot sauce. Delish!

Tastes good AND healthy?  Yep, I've found that in this recipe.  I've made this recipe twice now.  The first time was made exactly as written and was great.  The second time, I cut the beans to one can, used more cayenne and cilantro, and added a good squeeze of lime at the very end and it was excellent (to suit my preferences).  Served with sliced avocado and a dollop of sour cream (thumbs up to whoever made that suggestion!).

This is the first review I'm writing.  This was so good!  I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth.  Delicious as a main dish or as a side with some roast chicken or put shredded chicken mixed in.

Wonderful healthy recipe. I used unsalted vegetable broth, doubled the amount of corn and added baked chicken breast and turned it into the whole meal.

Absolutely delicious! In a separate pan I sautéed some shrimp in fresh lime juice, cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper. When done, add to quinoa mix to make it an even more substantial meal! Our family loves it this way.

Made it today.  Didn't make any changes this time, but next I think I will use more corn, not much, just a little. and use less cilantro.
But really enjoyed the meal.

This was my first attempt at cooking (and tasting) quinoa, and it was great! One can of black beans was enough. But it does need more of a kick and I added hot sauce to my plate. My family thought it was too bland, but I can't wait to try it cold tomorrow! Thank you!

This base recipe is fantastic. Re-configure it to suit your tastes. But you won't go wrong following this recipe. I always prefer a bit of heat, so I often tweak it that way. But when I served it to a table of pre-teens just as listed here.... well they all loved it!

I thought it was very good.  I had the ingredients and was trying to figure out what to make.  It was good.  I did add more garlic and a spicy salt mix.  I will make it again. Also Quinoa is a new food for me.

Easy, delicious, and healthy. I too only use one can of black beans, and I add chopped green pepper (3/4 a cup) to the   quinoa/broth mix 10 minutes into the simmer. I top with lots of avocado and hefty squeezes of lime.
SO. GOOD.

I love this recipe! It's very simple to make. You can add a variety of additional vegetables if wanted, but not needed. It tastes amazing. This latest time I added some canned green chilies and loved it. You really can't go wrong with this. I often have these ingredients just sitting in my pantry anyway, so it's a perfect quick meal any night of the week.

We loved it in our family, even the picky eating child.  I used 1 can of beans and 1 can of corn-it's what we had, don't judge :)   Worked out just fine and was even good the next day for leftovers.  This will be added to our week night meals.  Easy, cheap and healthy.  Couldn't ask for more.

This dish is in our regular meal rotation. I add a can of diced tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes, if I have them on hand) and serve as a main dish!

First time to use Quinoa. Made recipe as written except only used one can of black beans. I used Edens organic black soybeans to cut down on the carbs. Served with sour cream, avocado and picante sauce and a squeeze of lime. Great recipe. Super tasty. This is a keeper. Thanks!

I love this salad and make it regularly. I made a few adjustments to it to make it perfect for my taste. I cook the quinoa in chicken broth with salt, pepper, cumin and a drizzle of olive oil in a pot first. Then I let it rest for about 15 min. In a seperate pan, I saute the onions and garlic, then add the corn and black beans. I add a pinch of salt, pepper and cumin into this mix as well. Once it is cooked, I combine the mix with the quinoa and let it cool off before I finally add the cilantro into it. I add  half a lemon or lime juice as a final step. Delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly , it was great but decided two cans of black beans might be too much. Will definitely make again but with one can instead of two.

Yum! I make this as a side dish on Taco Tuesday ~ my 7 year old like to put it right in his taco. It's hearty enough to stand on its own so I always take the leftovers for lunch the next day. It's great hot or cold. My favorite black beans are ones I get in the Mexican food isle that are seasoned with cumin and chili spice so I don't drain them. Possibly my favorite quinoa recipe.

I will cut back on the beans next time, they overwhelmed the flavor for me.  Would be good with some nuts mixed in or maybe veggies.

I am fairly new to the vegan lifestyle (for a season) and as I searched for vegan-type recipes, this one was good. Instead of the salt, I used Vegeta. Other than that everything else was the same. I also need to learn how to effectively cook quinoa because it was a bit on the seed side and not fully fluffed. I added some more vegetable broth and let it simmer some more, which I think helped to make it fluffy. All in all, I will definitely be making this dish again.

Made this according to recipe with the exception of the cilantro because I did not have any. Absolutely delicious!  Even persuaded my quinoa hating husband to try it and he loved it. Have tried other recipes but always come back to this one!

I used only one can of 19 oz black beans, not two.  A bit more garlic and onions and cilantro then the recipe called for.  Easy and so yummy - a new side dish.

I have made this several times. It's 5 stars with the few tweaks I give it. I used 1 can of corn instead of 1 cup and only used 1 can of beans like a lot of folks suggested. If you like beans I'm sure it would be just fine with 2 cans. I also squeezed half a lime into it once it was done cooking and I like tripled the amount of cilantro (love that stuff). Once I put it in a bowl to serve I garnished it with a small lime wedge, some avocado and a dollop of plain Greek yogurt. I absolutely love this dish with those additions, I prepared it exactly as stated once and found it bland and boring. Thanks for this recipe, it will be enjoyed in our home for many years.

My first quinoa recipe and I loved it.  I had it as a side dish with a veggie burger.  I used both cans of  black beans and did not find this dry at all.  All I changed was a little more heat with the spices, glad I found this receipe!

This is really delicious. I've made a lot of quinoa in my day and this is a nice change of pace from the way that I make it. I didn't have vegetable broth, so I just used water in its place and added half of a Chicken bouillon cube. I also didn't have cilantro but it was just fine without. Thanks for the great recipe!

Definitely a go to in our house when looking for something healthy and easy. It is a fabulous recipe that should be made just as is. Make sure to add the cilantro because that just tops the whole thing off. Family favorite!

Very good. I think I simmered on a higher heat than I should have (but that's purely user error). Very filling and tasty.

My husband and I loved this! We often have Quinoa as a side dish and sometimes I add some vegetables into the Quinoa (peas etc). In this recipe I used only one can of beans and there was still more than enough for both of us. I also used chicken broth as I had no veggie broth at the time.  I used frozen peas instead of corn as I'm not a lover of corn. I did not soak the Quinoa beforehand, instead I do as i always do and held the strainer  with the Quinoa in it and ran the water from the tap over it for about three or four minutes making sure it was well washed. Always works for me. Will be having this again for sure!

I think this dish is great - really good flavor and perfect amount of "crunch."  I think it benefits from having a red pepper (or two) added at the beginning with the onions and garlic.  My husband, however, thinks this dish is a little bland, so you might want to try adding some jalapenos or something if you like your food a little spicier.

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I used fire roasted frozen corn. It probably didn't make any difference in taste but that's what I had on hand.  I hesitated about adding two cans of black beans as several reviewers thought it was too much but I always want to make the recipe as stated to give an honest opinion.  Looking at the cooked Quinoa then looking at two freshly rinsed cans of beans I wondered if I should add all of it. 
Well "we" say DO IT.
It blended very well and evenly and in our 7 opinions the two cans were “right on.”
The black beans didn't overtake the dish or taste and it looked beautiful. There was a little spiciness to it due to the cayenne pepper and the browning of the onions and garlic gave the Quinoa a nice flavor. The cilantro is a definite. It added an additional flavor that was very good. This was a great recipe and we decided we could make burritos with any left overs and change it up by adding some tomatoes and jalapeños to it. Thoroughly enjoyed it, thank you for posting the recipe, I can agree with others it is a five star!

I love this recipe every time. I add both cans of beans because I happen to like beans. I don't ever have veggie broth on hand, but chicken broth works fine. Also, if you don't have frozen corn, don't fret. The canned stuff works well also. I did add a green bellpepper and a red jalapeno with the seeds removed. Someone suggested adding salsa and so I added a little to it as well. This was excellent and super easy to make. It just might be one of my favorite vegetarian dishes!

I loved it!  I went heavy handed on the Cayene pepper and corn and beans because quinoa is bland.  I also substituted the vegetable oil with olive oil because that's always better.  Great healthy meal.

So tasty!  I added a chopped orange pepper and a can of diced tomatoes (upped the quinoa a couple of tablespoons for the extra tomato juice). I did use two cans of black beans. Served it with avocado and sour cream on corn tortillas.  Really, really good, and made great leftovers. My husband and our 1 1/2 year old liked it too.

Quick, easy and delicious! What more can I say?! I made it for a small get together and everyone loved it. I used chicken stock as that's what I had on hand, otherwise followed as is.  I would add more cayenne and cilantro next time.... I like it hot and love cilantro with beans.

I agree about reducing to one can of beans. Canned black beans must be drained and rinsed in a colander before adding to anything (except soup) because it adds a purplish stain.
Aduki beans would be a good substitute, add a pretty red color.

I have just made this, and it is just delicious!  Unfortunately, quinoa is not readily available in all shops here, but someone mentioned that Bulgar Wheat could also be used, which I found, and also used for the very first time.  I have never seen black beans locally, so added 1 tin of red kidney beans and 1 tin of black eyed beans.  Otherwise did exactly as instructed.  I will be making this again and again!  Thank you!

It was my first time ever making quinoa and this recipe totally rocked! Will definitely make again!
I did follow a few of the reviewers' advice and washed my quinoa before cooking. Afraid of turning my quinoa into mush, I cooked it separately and then carefully folded in the veggie mixture afterwards. 
Instead of using frozen or canned corn, I grilled fresh corn and cut them off the cobb. Also I only used one can of beans as two would have been overkill. I did not have cayenne pepper nor was it available at my grocery so I used a bit of sriracha instead. Came out great!

Stupendous flavor! Best quinoa recipe I have found. I did take recommendations to cut black beans down to 1 can; I think 2 cans would have been a little pasty, but I absolutely love this as an main course or side dish.

I didn't have corn on hand and used low sodium black beans.   It was excellent and will be made again!

I added zucchini, chorizo,  a dash of chipotle powder, and the juice of a whole lime to give bit give it a more Latin flair.

I love this!  I made a couple minor additions - just added some rosemary and squeezed lime juice over the top - about 1 lime - and you can even eat it cold like a salad!!  Yummy, light and refreshing!  Oh and yes, 1 can of beans is plenty

This is one of my favorite vegan recipes!  It's so easy to make and SO flavorful!  I also loved that it taste even better as leftovers.  I add a few slices of avocado on top and I have a nice healthy flavorful lunch for the week.  I would recommend this recipe, hands down!!

This simple dish is surprisingly tasty. Have made it numerous times now. I add chopped kale and red pepper to the quinoa while it's cooking.

This is a great and easy recipe and a good way to be introduced to quinoa if you have never eaten it.  I use only one can of beans and add chunk or shredded chicken.  Top with sour cream and sliced avacodo.

This was very good...I tweak every recipe. I cooked with sunflower/coconut oil. I added dash of Mrs. dash (I add to everything)
I did not use cilantro or corn. I used 1 can of beans, chicken broth. At very end a splash of chardonnay.. I also added to the first bowl I had, a tablespoon of Greek yogurt. Also with a dollop of homemade guacamole relish. Is delish this way!!!

Easy to make and nutritious.  My ingredient proportions were mostly based on what I made up or had available but this recipe is so versatile, it still tastes great.  This also tastes great as a cold salad, consider adding fresh chopped tomatoes.  Thanks so much for posting a great recipe!

Yummy!  Made no changes.  Certainly hearty enough for a standalone main dish.  We liked the smokiness of the cumin too.  I will definitely make this again.  And again.

A great recipe!!!  I made this one exactly per the instructions and next time I will probably use about half the amount of Cayenne pepper that this recipe calls for.  Just a bit too hot for us.  Even with that...my family loved this and we finished it off the next day as cold quinoa salad...super yummy

Very delicious.  I give it 4 stars because I did add to the recipe.  I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, used canned sweet corn as opposed to frozen corn.  In addition, we topped the dish with fresh salsa, guacamole and sour creme.  The meal was gobbled up in minutes!

I have a daughter who's not fond of corn, so we put that on the side. That was a perfect decision because the recipe was a little warm for my younger girl, who heaped the corn on!

Excellent, easy, and economical. I had all of the ingredients except for parsley on hand. I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. And next time I make this, I will use less cumin and probably more herbs for a fresher taste. (I am not a big fan of anything spicy). This was great cause it's easy to make and learn from.

Great dish, first time trying out quinoa.
First time I made it was good, second time I only use one can of black beans and I added four Roma Tomatoes and it came out even better.

Awesome recipe! I had never tried quinoa, so this was a good introduction. I added a can of diced tomatoes, and fresh spinach instead of cilantro. I did have to add more broth than the recipe called for. I will definitely make this again!

This is great. Super flavorful. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and made the following changes. I added in 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 yellow pepper to onion and garlic. I also added the juice of a can of stewed tomatoes and used vegetable broth to make 1.5 cups of broth. I used garbanzo beans instead of black beans and added the cut up stewed tomatoes in the end. Love the flavor and taste. Can't wait for leftovers.

5/15/17 - made this again tonight, but made it a cold salad. Cooked the quinoa and let it cool. Then added one can of black beans, 1/4 cup red onion, 1 cup corn, 1/4 red or yellow pepper, cilantro, and cumin. I loved the crunch of the raw onions and peppers. I also topped it with an avocado. Really yummy.

Liked this recipe because it doesn't use a lot of oil like some others I tried. The quinoa stays light and fluffy. I used 1c of quinoa. I added just one can of corn, one can of black beans, used scallions instead of yellow onion and lime to compliment the cilantro! Also, a cup of halved cherry tomatoes. And yellow, green and red peppers! Added some feta cheese. Excellent! E

I love this! Based on other reviewers I changed it a bit. I add a can of diced tomatoes at the same time as the beans and corn. I drain the tomatoes and use the tomato juice to cook the quinoa. Others mentioned using one can of beans but I prefer two.

This is one of our favorites. I use chicken broth instead of veggie broth (just don't keep that on hand) and I use 2 cans of black beans. This is so simple and delicious and I love that I always have the ingredients on hand. It makes a great quick easy weeknight meal.

This was my first time making/using Quinoa as well and I am very pleased with how this turned out. My 4 children 2-8 y.o. all enjoyed it even with the spice added to it. Hubby said is was a success! Thank you for this recipe. I really appreciate it! And the reviews!!

I have made this recipe for a couple of years now. If you love cilantro like I do it is a wonderful recipe. My family loves it hot or cold so the leftovers make a great lunch. Without the cilantro it might need another flavoring to give it that special taste. As is, one of my favorite recipes on this site.

Everyone loved it, except for my two boys 2 and 9 months. The cayenne pepper made it a little too spicy for them.  Next time I will set aside black beans and corn for them so they can partake.  Maybe when they're a little older they will like the spice more.

Made this recipe and thought it was awesome! I added organic chicken, bell peppers, and mushrooms to make it a more full meal, and I must say it came out great! If you feel it's a little bland, add a couple tablespoons of salsa and you're good to go!

Good, but I feel like this is missing something flavor wise. Used peas since I don't eat corn often. Added hot sauce, then used this as burrito filling with a tequila lime salsa in tomato low carb tortillas. This makes a lot if you're using it this way. I'll make this again.

Great recipe. Added some ingredients, a carrot, celery and tomatoes. It is usually a good idea to make it your own and work with what you have.

I would have liked to have more flavor in this recipe. I will think about what kind of veggies would add flavor to it. But nevertheless, it is quick easy and healthy. I can make it once in a while for these reasons.

I added a bit more corn. For me that was a bit to much cayenne pepper. a read a review where someone added lemon juice, so I did to my dish and I really liked it. This recipe is a keeper :)

Something is off here .. I had to cook a second cup of quinoa and mix it in to make this palatable. And the quinoa came out mushy .. the 'plain cooked' was texturally fine ..

Easy and refreshing. My personal preference is for a bit less heat so I would cut back cayenne to 1/8th tsp. will make this again. It's a nice side dish warm or cold the next day.

Makes quite a bit of quinoa. I suggest 1/2 cup quinoa, 1/2 onion, 3/4 - 1 can of beans. Really really good though!

This was my very first quinoa recipe. I didn't prepare the quinoa separately before trying this recipe out, and am still unsure if I need to. The recipe didn't turn out the first or second times, with my second time preparing the quinoa separately.

I halved the recipe and omitted the corn - not a fan of canned corn.  I just tasted it and it is delicious.  I love quinoa as well as black beans and the blend of spices and cilantro is great.  Looking forward to dinner.  I plan on pairing it with some salmon cakes(Chef John's) I made from this site.

I had to use frozen peas because I didn't realize I ran out of corn.  I think the black beans needed to be cooked a bit.  I could have gotten away with using 1 can of black beans instead of 2.

The whole family loved this.  I used chicken broth in lieu of veggie broth.  I think it would make a nice burrito filling with some cheese or sour cream.

I just can't even... I mean seriously... THIS. IS. FANTASTIC!!! I've tried umpteen amounts of quinoa recipes to try & incorporate healthier foods and NONE have come CLOSE to tasting this great. I added a bit more cayenne since Hubby & I like spicy. It didn't take away from the flavor at all. Hubby also used all my lime so that wasn't added and even without - very tasty and delicious. Testament to the flavor is Hubby is eating it right out the pan, hasn't waited for me to plate it! PLEASE - if you've never made quinoa - RINSE IT BEFORE COOKING. Great recipe as is that will be made again & again. I can't wait to try it with avocado.

I generally don't like quinoa, but this salad is great!  I like to add it to a green salad, a few tortilla chips and some salsa and have a "taco salad".

Really flavorful and filling! I have served this as the main dish many times. It's loaded with protein and has a good kick to it! As many reviewers suggested I only put in 1 can of black beans. I also leave out the cilantro but that's just to make it even simpler.

This was incredible! The only things I did differently was make the quinoa separately using low sodium chicken broth instead of water , and a little hot sauce in place of the cayanne pepper.  Its delicious, easy, and budget friendly. Will absolutely make this again and again !

This is a side dish that I often end up eating as a main course when needing something easy that I can bring for lunches the next day. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and squeeze half a fresh lime over the completed dish.

I had all the ingredients on hand (surprisingly) and wanted to make something with quinoa since I never had. This was absolutely delicious! Used 1 can of black beans, 1 can corn drained, 1 can rotel chili. DELICOUS! I have become a major cilantro fan because of this dish.

I added quite a bit to this recipe, my favorite thing being mangoes. Yum!! I only used one can of beans, and added chopped mangoes and a bell pepper. The mangoes give it a great sweetness that goes well with the onions. The white quinoa I used didn't fluff up quite as much as I thought it would, but the rest of the ingredients kept it hearty enough that I didn't feel like it was missing anything (even with less beans). The spices were great, and really boosted the flavor. Next time I make this, I will definitely use mangoes again, and maybe add some avocado.

We love this but aren't cilantro fans so we leave that out but we do cook shrimp in a Cajun seasoning and add that!!!  So good and I use leftovers on salads during for lunch.

Loved it. Quick, easy, delicious, make ahead, vegetarian recipe. I had to make a few modifications because I didn't have some of the ingredients at home. I didn't use onions and instead of two cans of black beans, I used one can of black beans and one can of chickpeas. It came out delicious. Next time I will make some coriander chutney or have some greek yogurt on the side.

This was my first experience with quinoa and this dish is SO good! I used both cans of black beans, which was not too much for me, but I love black beans. I rinsed my quinoa but didn't soak it, and the texture was perfect. I used slightly less cilantro than called for because I don't love cilantro, but that's just my preference. The recipe is perfect. I will be making this again!

This is my second time making this. 1st time I made this I did not have corn and cilantro, so it was ok! But today I followed the recipe exactly and added little of lemon juice at the end. It came out really nice! My husband who disliked quinoa, liked this dish.

I've been vegan for about 6 years now, and I have to admit, I find a lot of recipes overwhelming. Yet me being the novice I am was intrigued by the substitution of quinoa in place of rice, (and the simplicity of prep) so I decided to get my toes a tad bit wet and go for it. And MY GOODNESS, not only does this recipe take little to no time to prepare but, it's sooo hearty and delicious....what have I been missing out on all of this time?!!

I only used 1 can of black beans which was just right. Two cans was way too much. I don't like cumin or cayenne pepper or cilantro so it seemed tasteless to me and a little dry. I added some tomato juice and trocomare which is natural sea salt infused with organic fresh herbs and vegetables. It tasted
much better but still not one of my favorties even though I love quinoa.

A little nervous.  Make sure to rinse it as stated in previous reviews but turns out amazing.   Great on a vegan diet

This recipe has been a staple in our house since discovering it a couple months ago! I double the recipe so we have leftovers. I use 1 can Pinto and 1 can Black beans, just so it's not so many black beans. I also add 1 chopped zucchini to the recipe and shredded chicken. It is great in a bowl or in a tortilla for a burrito!

Excellent recipe.  I made only minor changes and it turned out great.  Used chicken broth as it was on the shelf.  I substituted a seeded and devained jalapeno for the cayenne pepper, added a little salsa and some sliced black olives.  YUM.  Especially good topped with sour cream.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

I liked this. I could do away with the cilantro and think it would be better.  I even did about 1/4 c. of cilantro - still too much.

I really enjoyed this. I did use what I had on hand. I used organic chicken broth instead of vegetable and only had minced onion. I  seasoned with garlic salt and a pinch of sea salt. I did double the recipe. I agree that one can of black beans is sufficient for the original recipe..if you double it,add two cans. I also used sweet white frozen corn. This is a recipe that you can play with a lot. Adding different vegetables and beans can give you a nice array of flavors.

I've made this dish about four times already, it has become one of my favorite dinners! I had to replace the cilantro with parsley because I didn't have any at hand but it still came out really good, other than that, followed the recipe all the way. I recommend this to everyone! It's easy to make and very filling, 5 stars!!!!!

It was a great start.  I used freshly cooked corn and black beans, and a minced fresh jalapeno.  Added fresh tomatoes for both color and flavor, and topped the dish with a brined and sauteed chicken breast with avocado slices as a dressing.  Pretty awesome.

1 can of black beans is more than enough. I usually omit the corn as well, totally unnecessary. This is a wonderfully delicious and nutritious recipe.

Added cooked diced chicken and a can of diced tomatoes. Used it as a taco filling with fresh tomatoes and a bit of ranch. It tasted like a chipolte burrito. Soo yummy!

This is amazing! I love quinoa and this is such an awesome recipe! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Also used chili powder instead of cumin(didn't have any in hand). Added Creole seasoning for taste instead of salt and pepper. I didn't rinse/drain the beans, I just dumped the whole can in, cooked for another five minutes and put in the oven for another 10 minutes. It turned out delicious, taking some to work tomorrow!

I just wanted to let everyone know this was the first time I've heard of quinoa. After watching the video and rereading most of the reviews for a week, I finally made this dish. I added Garlic powder like some of the other reviewers. I was planning on using only one can of beans but decided at the last min to add the second can, I'm sure glad I did. My meal came out perfect , the cilantro was a nice touch. I paired the meal with chicken breast. I will b making this awesome dish again, especially Because of the all healthy benefit of quinoa. I finally found my substitute for rice.

Liked this a lot.  I added more cumin (1/2 T) and cayenne (1/2 tsp) and probably could have used more.  I thought the 2 cans of black beans were just right.  Most people think of veggies as being the "small" part of their meal, but it really should be the major part; the grain should be less.  Corn is a grain too, so it's best to add the second can of beans for a well-rounded healthy meal.  I think 15 min prep time is not correct.  Preparing the cilantro (plucking from stems, washing, drying and chopping) took 15 minutes!  Worth it though.

Really delicious. High flavor and nutrition in a very healthy dish. It is now in my rotation often. I like to serve it with sliced avocado and tomato. YUM!
Update: I do prefer to make it with one can of black beans instead of two, which makes it pretty dense.

Loved the flavors.  The next day, I actually made a burrito with the leftovers.  I added cheddar cheese and tomato to the wrap and had plain yogurt on the side.  Delicious!  Thank you to those who tweaked and posted, and thank you to the developer!  This will be a new staple in my kitchen.

So yummy! Hubby loved it so much that he asked for it as a filling in a burrito for work the next day. Took his suggestion and rolled up a few with some smoked Gouda. Yummola!! This dish is really tasty and super versatile!

I made this last night for 4 adults and 2 children.(children 9 & 11yrs) My father can't eat corn so I substituted red bell pepper. Used 1 can of black beans as other reviewers suggested. Oh, also used Chili powder instead of cayenne because that's what I had. It was a huge hit, going to make again and again. Super healthy and low in calories.

Great recipe. I threw all of the ingredients into my rice cooker (except the beans and cilantro, which went in at the end), and it was delicious. I only used one can of black beans.

Variations are endless with this recipe.  One can of black beans for sure.  Other than that, it's a great base.   I stir fried some green squash and baby spinach, chopped up some fresh tomato and added at end.  Had to add a little more liquid, but that was it!  Any veggie would be good. Thanks for sharing such a healthy one!

I think that this is a really good basic recipe but I found it a bit bland. I think with a few additions, it would be a great recipe. I haven't worked out what the additions should be but one of the other reviewers probably has!

Very, very filling, even with a small part, and low calories too! Perfect for a evening meal when the rest of the day has been a bit high calories. (note to self, less onions is better)

Made it almost exactly according to the recipe, except I did not have cilantro. We all enjoyed it. However, in the future, I'd likely only add one can of black beans. But there will be a future, as it was quite good!

My family loved this and it was really easy to make. I used chicken broth instead of veg since I didn't have any, and I used canned corn instead of frozen. I'll use less broth next time so that it doesn't turn out mushy.

I made this as written except I used canned corn and a quinoa blend with brown rice.  I must say that I was amazed by how delicious it was.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was fantastic.  My S-I-L made it as a side dish and served it cold.  She added zuchinni and sweet peppers.  My daughter and I loved it so much that I made it a couple of days later for supper and served it hot - my youngest (age 9) looked at it and said it looked gross, but I made her try a a bite.  She ate FOUR servings and loves it.  Dear hubby ate it and said it was delicious too - so the whole family was pleased with this one.  You can add whatever veggies you have available and you like and this dish can take the changes and still be excellent.  Would work great for work potlucks as it's also vegetarian but loaded with protein.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

So simple! Probably one of the easiest and most delicious recipes I've ever cooked. I doubled the recipe and only used one can per other reviews suggestion. The ratio was PERFECT! I added a generous amount of fresh squeezed lime juice and upped the cayanne a bit. Turned out wonderful. I give this one ALL THE STARS!

This was a really great dish and so filling. I did add lime juice, to taste, before serving to go with the cilantro and chicken broth instead of veg. It made a huge difference! Also, one can of black beans was enough for me.

I was excited to try this as I love anything with quinoa and/or black beans.  We felt it was ok at best.  With all the ingredients, I felt it would have had more flavor.  It was somewhat bland and very dry.  I'd maybe make it again due to the nutrition value, but didn't love it.

This was delicious - the best quinoa recipe I've tried!  Will definitely make again.  I had two cans of beans ready to go, but it just seemed like WAY to much, so I ended up only using one can, which ended up being plenty.  I knew my eaters were not big on cumin, so I cut that down to a 1/4 tsp.  Other than that, I did as directed, and it was a perfect side dish.  These measurements made a good amount of side dish for 5 people.

Made this tonight for dinner. I added a can of black beans and thought it didn't look like it needed any more, so I stopped at the one can. That's all I changed.... this recipe is great just as it is.

Every intention of making this recipe as written; however, I was missing ingredients.  Here's what I put in:
Garlic powder in place of garlic cloves
Beef broth in place of vegetable broth
1/8 tsp of cayenne
Canned chili beans (rinsed and drained) in place of black beans
Canned corn in place of frozen corn

I think I would have preferred the black beans, but it was still very good with chili beans - just had more of a chili flavor.  Thank you for the recipe!

Love this recipe. I dont soak the quinoa but I do brown it in the pan before adding salt free, chicken broth (Swanson low fat) and I add a can of rotel diced tomatoes and chillies.  Use one can of black beans.  I actually use this as a main dish. It is so good (even cold).

I decided to make this as a summer salad. I used a box of roasted garlic quinoa (made with veg broth) and leftover corn cut off the cob. Like others, I used only one can of black beans. I added a chopped avocado and a squirt of lime (to help keep the avocado green) and chilled the whole thing. We loved it!

I didn't have frozen corn so I drained a can of whole kernel corn and put it in a heated & oiled cast iron pan to get some of the moisture out of it. I also drained and rinsed the only 1 can of black beans and added them to the corn to heat through along with cumin, salt, pepper, and garlic powder before adding it to the quinoa mixture. I served it with beef fajitas and sangria.

I made this tonight for dinner. It was FANTASTIC! Next time I make it, I think I'll only use one can of beans. I also squeezed a little fresh lemon juice on top just before serving. Can't wait to nibble on the leftovers:)

I was a little reluctant to try this recipe because of all the rice and bean recipes I've tried with cumin and cayenne pepper... the spices always seemed to be far too strong. This recipe, however, is perfect! The ratio of spices is just right - not at all bland but not overpowering in the slightest. I only used one can of beans and upped the corn to 1.5 cups to partially make up for it. My husband, my 13-month-old and I all just gobbled it up! This is definitely one that I will make again and again. Thank you 3LIONCUBS!!! :)

I liked this recipe, but I feel like it was missing something.  Next time, I'm going to try adding tomatoes and see if that will make it go from good to great.

We tend to eat mostly vegetarian and this is our go-to taco filling.  We usually cut back on the beans to 1 can and add extra cilantro because we like it so much.  I will typically use some chipotle powder if we're in the mood for some more spice.  We also use 1 cup quinoa and a whole 15 oz can of vegetable broth.  Also use olive or coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Little modifications aside, this is a great side but stands out for us as taco filling and I eat it cold on top of a salad the next day since it always makes leftovers.

I loved this recipe so much! It is quick and easy to make, although I would make it without cilantro next time as its flavour doesn't go well with the spices. I also did not follow the recipe directions the same. I first started out by cooking my quinoa in water and while that was cooking I sautéed my onions and garlic. NOTE: Put your garlic in when your onions are halfway done cooking of the garlic will burn!. Once the quinoa was done I put it into a large bowl, added the onion.garlic mixture, my corn, and I used kidney beans because I did not have black beans, I added my spices and cilantro. I decided to mix it all together and put it in the fridge to eat it chilled and let the flavours marry. Overall it was a lovely recipe, just next time I will not be using cilantro.

Made this yesterday and we loved it! Here's what I changed: subbed evoo for veg oil, added and cooked mushrooms before putting in the quinoa, mixed the seasoning together (added 1 tsp oregano, used 1 tsp of salt and pepper too) and stirred it into the onion/garlic mixture to coat before adding quinoa. Added rotisserie shredded chicken when the corn and beans go in. Used 1 can of beans only. Topped with avocado, Tapatio, and sour cream. It was perfect.

First time making this I made for a dinner party/open house for 50 people! It received rave reviews and out of the huge quantity I made I had two servings left.  The fresh cilantro is a must as it makes the flavors pop. Second time I made it for a smaller dinner party and had enough left for my husband to take to work as leftovers...I guess that makes it a hit! I did not have vegetable broth and substituted with organic chicken broth and it tasted great.

Very flavorful.  We love black beans, so 2 cans was just right.  Especially if you are eating this as a main course.

I followed the recipe as written, only reducing the amt of beans to 11/2 cans. It was delicious, however, after I refrigerated it overnight and added avocado tossed in lime juice, it was AMAZING! I plan to make it again, adding both avocado and cherry tomatoes. I highly recommend trying it either way. After everything is tossed together, taste it and adjust salt and pepper as needed. A little more salt made a big difference too. I love this recipe!!!

The nutty flavor of the quinoa lends itself nicely to the spice in this dish.  I followed exactly as written, it was good - husband even liked it (he's a tough critic!).  My only thought while chowing down on this was, next time I may add some peas.  Makes an excellent side dish for for mexican chicken!

Made it 3X before rating; once for my MIL, once for a teacher luncheon and once for a home tennis match.  All attempts were overly successful which surprised me because it was too easy.  Made exactly as written.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

amazing recipe. great hot, even better cold, and even good in the morning with eggs. I cook this recipe once a week and I usually add avocado, tomatoes and chicken. Honestly, one of the most versatile recipes I have ever came across and it's also delicious as is!! Great with hot sauce! yum yum yum :)

I absolutely loved this!  I followed the recipe but only used one can of black beans as recommended by other reviewers.  It was almost almost a 50/50 ratio of quinoa and black beans, slightly more of the quinoa.   If you want to give it more kick, use more seasonings but if you want to taste the quinoa, the seasonings as directed give everything a nice balance of flavor!

Very easy to make, great blend of flavors and a world away from ordinary. I didn't use corn but even with just the black beans and cilantro, I'd definitely suggest this dish. 

I paired it with steamed green beans for a healthy vegetarian mean with loads of fiber and protein

This is a pretty good recipe as is.  It has a nice light, healthy feeling to it when you eat it and is tasty.  I just need to remember to add a bit more salt next time if I use a low-sodium vegetable broth.

Definitely a wonderful recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 1 can of black beans.  Like many others I think 2 would take the spotlight away from the quinoa, which I'd prefer to have as the majority in the dish.  Tastes great hot and cold.  I love making a big batch and eating for lunch the whole week.  Definitely a keeper.

Very solid side dish that can be used as a main dish in a pinch. Fresh cilantro is an absolute must. I halved the black beans and added some fresh jalepenos and green onions.

Yummy!  I took an excellent recipe (thanks 3LIONCUBS) and bent it to my needs.  After softening the onions, I added the spices to toast, adding an extra 1/2 tsp of cumin since I'm a fan. I then added 1lb of very lean ground beef.  Once browned, I added the rinsed (and patted dry) quinoa to the skilled to toast.  Due to the extra volume and since I don't like my quinoa too crunchy, I added 1 1/2 cups of beef broth and 1/2 cups of water.  I exchanged 1 can of pinto beans for 1 of the cans of black beans since that is what I has on hand.  A very delicious dinner!  Next time I may add 2 tsp of cumin and use cooked chicken.  This is such a simple recipe with so much potential for change. It has been added to my monthly rotation, a high honor indeed considering the sheer number of highly rated recipes at Allrecipes.

This recipe is amazing and easy! My 11 year old granddaughter helped me make this and we BOTH loved it! I used Swanson's Fat Free, Reduced sodium CHICKEN Broth in place of the vegetable broth and Reduced sodium black beans which cut the sodium content of this recipe down to 251 mg per serving. That is less than half the sodium content! I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!! **********

What a terrific recipe and a tasty way to consume the very healthy quinoa!! The recipe gets five stars - stand alone!  I did use chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, and I found that I needed to add a little more while the quinoa was simmering to keep it moist.  I really like black beans, so I used two cans. This comes down to personal taste and I really liked it with two cans. I WILL be making this dish often!  It's a perfect side dish, but can readily suffice for a light main course!

Fantastic! My sons, husband and I all loved this recipe.  I made it for the first time tonight and it was great. I followed the recipe with the exception of two things, 1) I reduced the overall cooking time by 5 minutes - I added the corn after 15 minutes, rather than 20, because the liquid seemed to be nearly gone by that point, and 2) I added a can of diced tomatoes and the end with the black beans.  My kids agreed I should make this again tomorrow - so needless to say, this will be new regular.

Healthy, delicious, and it reheats beautifully. My husband and I make this the night before and take it in tupperware the next day for lunch. It is seriously such a beautiful dish. We're living on a budget, and we don't want to eat unhealthy, processed food, but we were also getting REALLY tired of rice. But this is wonderful! And Quinoa, although a little pricier than rice, is super filling and has better flavor.

Absolutely delicious! As recommended in reviews, I used one can of black bean (it's plenty) and topped it off with sour cream, chopped tomatoes, and avocado. Then I squeezed some lime juice on it. Heaven!!

Turned out very well.  I would use less onions as I am not a huge onion fan.  Also, great the next morning in an egg scramble with some cheddar cheese!

This was amazing!  I was out of cumin and used taco seasoning instead.  It turned out just fine!  The only suggestion I would give, is that if you plan to reheat this for the next day, to hold the cilantro on the side until you are ready to serve.  (as in...don't "cook" it in initially.  We ate the leftovers anyway, but it would have been better if we had added cilantro separately.  This was also a bit spicy for my 8 year old, so next time I will cut the cayenne in half.

Easy, hearty and healthy. One can of black beans IS plenty and I agree that adding some drained canned tomatoes with green chiles would just top this off! Will make it again. Thanks!

I'm new to using quinoa, and loved this dish!  Even my picky child likes it although my husband won't try it!  I used chicken broth because I didn't have veggie broth. Will definitely make again.  Might try some chopped green or red pepper in it or diced tomato.  Might try just 1 can of beans, but it's still great with 2!

I made this with left over chicken last night. This was the first time I have served Quinoa to the family. They loved it. Everyone had second helpings of this. The only thing I changed was I replaced the frozen corn with frozen mixed veggies only because that is what I had on hand

I just made this for lunch for me and my girls and it was fantastic!  I followed the trend of only using one can of black beans and it worked out great.  I've tried to make quinoa before with bad results but this was quick, easy, and delicious. I will definitely make this again soon!

This is delicious. Great combo of flavours. Followed the recipe almost exact, the only thing I did a little differently was added a bit more corn, a bit less beans, just to suit my preferences. I LOVE IT. Since discovering the recipe just a couple of weeks ago I have already made this 3 times. Thanks!

I had no vegetable broth so I made this with water and it was totally fine. It was a huge hit. I put the leftovers in a tortilla with salsa and cheese and they raved about that too. Definitely a keeper.

This has quickly become one of our favorite dinners.  Quick, delicious and healthy.  I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, a bit more garlic...4-5 cloves.  And we've experimented with different broths, vegetable, chicken, turkey and beef.  All work fine.  Love, love, love it!

OMG sooooooooo good!!!!  This is my second time eating Quinoa and the 1st time was a disaster.  Since this had such raving reviews decided to give it a go.  I took others suggestions and washed Quinoa before cooking, used chicken stock (since I didn't have any veg stock), used 1 can of black bean (definitely more than enough), and used 1 can of corn (since I didn't have frozen corn).  SUPER good!!!!  I hope my toddler and my hubby will like it too.  If not, oh well more for me :D

This was my first attempt at cooking quinoa and this recipe turned out great.  Even my daughter who has texture issues liked it a lot.  I didn't have garlic or cilantro and used only 1 can beans and 1/3 can corn but even with that it was still delicious - even addictive! Those who didn't like it either were expecting it to take like chocolate cake or didn't have fresh spices or did something wrong.

Made as written only 3 stars. I thought 2 cans of beans was 1 can too many! Think if I make it again I will throw in some tomatoes for more color.

I made this last night, so good! The only change I made was to add some finely diced red and yellow pepper. I served this with grilled hake. My husband ate probably half of this so 10 servings might be a stretch, but we had it more like a main dish. Thanks very much for the recipe!

Made recipe as is except I substituted 3/4 tsp. chili powder for the cayenne and added a little extra garlic since we're garlic-lovin' folk. Really delicious! Great as a side dish, or my hubby and I both like taking this as a lunch. Thanks for sharing!

I have never tried quinoa before and I thought I would give this a try for me and my boyfriend. I didn't have any beans so skipped that part, and instead of using broth I used 2 cubes of chicken bullion and skipped the salt. We both LOVED it! It was flavorful and delicious, I just love the way some of the quinoa pearls pop in your mouth. We will defiantly be using this as a healthy alternative to rice and heavier meat dishes.

The only can of black beans I had was a can of Bush's  Black Bean Fiesta.  They gave this side dish a nice little southwestern flavor!  A great side dish!

I tried this recipe for dinner tonight. I did tweak it a little, I left out the cayenne due to a 5 yr old, the only other tweak I would make is increase the amount of quinoa. I'd like more quinoa in relation to the amount of beans, other than that I thought the flavor was great. Definitely will make it again with my tweaks!!

I used 1 cup of quinoa, 1 can of broth, and white wine to finish up the 2 cups of liquid. I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes, and 1 can of diced chicken. This is very similar to the CBW Power Bowl so next time I am going to add some Romaine and make the jalapeño cilantro sauce to put on it.

Delicious! I opted out of the cayenne pepper and cumin and used a pinch of chili powder instead. Also I added some sweet peppers to it and regular greens in substitute for cilantro because I'm no fan of it. Amazing! Going to be a regular for me now!

Made this as my first quinoa recipe and I must say it is fantastic.  I love all the flavors together and the cilantro just tops it off.  Knowing how well this turned out, I cant wait to try another quinoa recipe.

The recipe directions should include soaking the dry seeds for 10 minutes and rinsing through a fine wire strainer before adding to the saucepan, this removess any unwanted residue and improves the taste. Good and easy to adjust ingredients to your tastes.

This was great! I cooked it in my pressure cooker and added the beans and corn at the end. I am in love with this recipe. So versatile. Next time I will add veggies and fresh basil for a change and omit the black beans. Thank you!

Yum! I love making this recipe. I only use one can of black beans, since two would be too much. My 18 month old eats it right up every time. I've brought it to two different potlucks a and it was all gone in minutes with lots of compliments and interest in getting the recipe. Delicious, healthy and super easy!!

I reduced the amount of corn, and added a bit more vegetable broth to keep it moist.  The kick of cayenne did the trick to bring out the flavor.  Served it with some lime tacos, and the family loved it!  Very easy dish to make.

I made this exactly like the recipe stated, I've never tried quinoa and after all the excellent reviews thought I'd try this. For me it just tasted strange, so its hard for me to say if its the recipe that's bad or I just don't like the flavor of quinoa.

I too would give this 6 stars.  I had a dish similar to this at a luncheon and have been trying to duplicate unsuccessfully.  Until now!  This is worth trying.  Even my husband likes it and he is not a fan of quinoa or cilantro.  I also used chicken broth instead of veg. broth.

This is so good! Using advice from others, I rinsed the quinoa and let it soak for ten minutes.  I used one can of black beans and added half of a red bell pepper.  I waited for it to cool a bit before I added the cilantro so it wouldn't wilt.  I also used vegetable broth and felt it had more than enough flavor.  The colors were beautiful and the spices perfect. It's good both warm and cold. I will make this again and look forward to different variations perhaps adding halved cherry tomatoes or sun-dried tomatoes!  Lot's of options!

I don't use cilantro, just because I don't like it. I added a chopped red bell pepper and I sometimes add a drained can of chopped tomatoes.  I only use one can of beans. I love this recipe and often make it as a side dish which also acts as a main dish for my vegan friends and family.

You definitely only need one can of black beans. This recipe does have a little bit of a kick…but it tasted a lot blander than I thought it was going to. I like this recipe because it is very healthy and I feel good about everything in it; however, it's not the tastiest quinoa recipe I've had. It is fairly easy to make (I cook it in a rice cooker and didn't sauté the onion or garlic —just threw it in). So I like that I can make a bunch and store it so I have meals for the next couple days.

I was looking for some quinoa recipes and saw the amazing reviews for this one... Sadly disappointed. It wasn't bad but I would make the quinoa plain before I would make this again.

I made this recipe last night. I had read a lot of the reviews. So I used some of those ideas. I drained the beans well I used 3/4  cup quinoa. My twist to it was I used flaxseed meal as a egg substitute. 1 tbsp. flaxseed meal add 3 tbsp. boiling hot water, mix and let set, then add to mixture. Hubby and I enjoyed this recipe. I think this will become a favorite.

I was excited to try this recipe with all the positive reviews. We took the advice of others and only used one can of black beans, I could see how two would be way too much. However, when it was finished, my friend and I could barely eat it. It was disgusting.

Excellent.  I added red pepper and zucchini.  Also, I used just one can of beans.  An addition of halved cherry tomatoes at the end--just heated through--would also be good.

This recipe is really good!  I used only 1 can of black beans, 1 can of corn, about half of a large red onion, and a very small amount of cilantro.  I also added some fresh tomato, bell pepper, avocado, and paprika.  Very high in vitamins and low in fat. Not only was this dish tasty, but it was a sight to see with all of the beautiful colors. Definitely will make this again!

This is an excellent recipe. I am a die-hard fan of Mexican food so this was a fabulous alternative. I made a double recipe of this tonight. I used tomatoes, instead of using a separate can of green chilies. It took a little while longer to cook, but it was great. I'm sure the leftovers will reheat well, and this should freeze well, too. My family is going to go on Whole Living's Action Plan next week, so I'm trying out a few new recipes beforehand. Your website is great!

What a great alternative to having meat....I too used only one can of beans, but added more corn.  I found this dish very tasty and hearty and will absolutely make it again!  ** I didn't have any cumin so I used chili powder instead **

Absolutely delicious. I always add an extra half of a red onion, 1-2 cloves garlic, and 1-2 bell peppers. An extra pinch of cumin and cayenne pepper help to spice it up.

We all enjoyed this dish,  even the kiddos!  I prepared this according to the recipe, I agree one can of black beans would have been plenty.  Another note, the ingredients were all easy to find  in the organic versions at Publix!

This is by far the far the best quinoa recipe our family has eaten.  The recipe makes 10 servings, but between the four of us, there were only about two servings left.  Once a week, we try to eat a complete vegetarian meal, so this recipe pay a regular visit to our table.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy and delicious.  I followed the recipe except did not measure the spices, just sprinkled them in and then at the end I also spritzed a little lime juice.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent dish! I am definitely going to make this one again.  I had never tried cooking quinoa with cumin, but it went really well together and the cayanne pepper gave it a nice kick.  I used only 1 can of black beans and that seemed to be the perfect ratio of quinoa to black beans.

This was simple, delicious and healthy.  I made two tiny modifications.  I only used one can of beans and I used the cilantro paste that comes in a tube in the grocery store.  Will definitely make again. Yum!

I love this recipe, remember to "wash"quinoa before using in recipe to remove soapy surface. I also browned the quinoa, to add a nutty flavor, if You have the time. A really good recipe, make extra and use as food on the run,

This is my favorite recipe! I actually now use this recipe as a base when I am making a quinoa dish. I usually modify it due to personal preferences. I add 1/4 of jalapeno diced and 1/2 to a whole red pepper diced to the onion and garlic as well. I remove the corn for dietary reasons and add fire roasted green chiles when I add the black beans. Everyone I have made this for raves about it!

I thought this was a good meat-free dinner but it needed something to add a little zing.  I added some tomatillo-salsa verde that I made on top which was spicy and really completed this dish.  I also added in a garden-fresh sweet bell pepper that I grew in my garden.  That added a nice crunch.  All in all, very good.

I love  this recipe, keep it in bookmarks. Tonight at the end I added a chopped yellow pepper, some halved cherry tomatoes and lime juice. Served cold with broasted chicken. Spices are perfect.

I followed the recipe and used 2 cans of black beans because my husband loves black beans. This is really good! I love quinoa alone and with all the added ingredients, it just made my quinoa more interesting and delicious! If you could get a Village Harvest golden quinoa, it's best to use it for any quinoa recipe.

I am experimenting with Quinoa to figure out if i really like its flavor.  This is one of the best recipes I have tried so far.  I would recommend, but be careful with the cayenne - a little can go a long way in this recipe.

This was really good! I took other reviews into account and added some orange bell pepper. SO yum. I also added some Rotel (diced tomatoes and green chiles) which jazzed it up a bit (spicy!) and topped with a lil sour cream. I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I left it out.. but might try it next time. Will def make this again!

New to using quinoa ("keen-wa"), i decided to start with this recipe. i had everything on hand. It was simple and delicious.

This is my first experience with quinoa and I loved it! I served it as a side dish with key west chicken and it was fantastic! I only used one can of black beans and it was plenty. Next time I make it I will probably saute more vegetables with the garlic and onion and add more cayenne pepper to it.

Delicious!  My first time with quinoa.  I did as others suggested and soaked (about 20 minutes) and rinsed the grain before cooking.  The texture was perfect.  I used leftovers with tortilla chips and cheese and made nachos the next day!

I sometimes have trouble coming up with good vegan recipes, but I made this at the suggestion of a friend and it was excellent!  I substituted a can of red beans for one of the cans of black beans.  Good flavor, good variety, not too heavy, and easy and cheap enough for a college student.  I will definitely make this again!

I make this as a half recipe as it makes a big serving.  I cut everything in half but the canned corn and beans.  It's a great meal on its own!  LOVE it!  Omit the cayenne pepper if you don't like spicy.

This was our first time eating quinoa. This recipe was great. I did everything the same except I only used 1 can of black beans and I used chicken broth instead of the vegetable one. This recipe makes for a lot of food if you just eat it for a side. It is only my husband and I so we actually had it on 3 different occasions before we were done with it.

This is hands-down one of my favorite recipes now.  I've made this many times and it has become one of my staple dishes.  I make it to take for lunches, serve it as a side dish, and take it to potlucks.  The recipe is perfect as is and only needs adjusting for personal tastes.  e.g., sometimes I crank up the heat on it when it's just for me, and sometimes I'll add chopped grape tomatoes just to add a little something.

This was fantastic!!! I followed a few others suggestions and 1. rinsed the quinoa before I used it 2. used only one can of low sodium black beans 3. added a red pepper 4. served it with grilled shrimp on the side. It was the first time I ever made it and even though my husband is a picky eater, he devoured it!!! Makes awesome leftovers!

Overall a good recipe. My husband said it was good, but a bit bland. I thought it was fine, but I was in the mood for something lighter. I think it really depends on your personal preference. I was surprised that my 2 year old ate it despite it having "green stuff" in it, lol. I did change a few things: added a diced tomato from the garden, used only 1 can of beans, and reduced the cayenne for the kids sake. I would make again, but might increase the amount of cumin, salt & pepper.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!!  I had to cook it a little longer b/c I still had a lot of liquid left over and the Quinoa was still seed-like.  My 3 boys ate it up quickly!  I added cooked chicken to it and sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top.  My 8 year old was literally shoveling it into his mouth and quickly requested seconds!  Even my picky hubby ate it!  Love this recipe :) I served this as a main dish.

YUM! First of all, I don't understand reviewers that complain about it not being flavorful. Everyone's tastebuds are different and the person who wrote this recipe can't predict your taste preferences. It was perfect for me though! I thought it was super flavorful and so yummy! I make it all the time. I like it as is and I put the 2 cans of beans in because I love black beans. One can definitely wouldn't be enough for me. Follow your instincts.

Delish! My whole family liked this. The only changes I made was to use red quinoa because that's all I had and I also added a sprinkling of smoked chipotle chili powder. Served it with cornbread and sour cream.

This was amazing.  I let the onions start to caramelize and cooked the quinoa mixture on a little higher heat. Right before it burns I took it off the burner. This created a caramelized flavor throughout the dish and really spread the other flavors around! Insanely delicious.

This is my ultimate quinoa recipe! I love it so much. The only thing I do a tiny bit differently is I don't buy broth. I use a whole vegetable bullion cube with 1&1/2 cups of boiling water.  My husband doesn't like cilantro (I know that's crazy)  so I serve up his quinoa and then add the cilantro to the rest.

It was good but I expected it to have a lot more flavor based on the ingredients. I used the recommend two cans of beans, this seems a bit much and 1 can would suffice.

This was the first time I prepared quinoa.  9 minutes left of simmering and the liquid was gone so I added a little more veggie stock - possibly too much.  I also only had one can of black beans so I also added a can of butter beans.  Those were a little too big to absorb the flavor.  But in the end, a delicious recipe and I plan to make again!

I'd never had quinoa before, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but now I'll be searching out other recipes with this ingredient! This turned out fabulously. So delicious! We all loved it. One small change--after adding the first can of black beans, I decided not to use the second. One can was plenty. We will definitely be having this again.

I use this recipe all the time. sometimes I make it exactly written for a great side dish or I  add to it for an entire meal. In the summer I add squash, zucchini, and top with a fried egg and cheese for lunches.

Seems like a great starter recipe. We added some canned chopped tomato with peppers, and a can of chunk chicken and served in corn tortillas (heated with a little oil) for yummy tacos! Some sour cream on top was good too.

Delicious!  I've been waiting for the right time to make this dish, and it went perfectly with fish tacos.  So. Good.  Made it exactly as written, in a dutch oven.  It had a funny grey color -- not sure if I didn't rinse the beans enough or if it was from the dutch oven.  Either way, it was a hit and will become part of the regular rotation. I may even increase the cayenne a tad to give it more kick.

What a wonderful recipe. Cut the serving in half, and added fresh corn instead of the frozen stuff. Turned out so amazing that my boyfriend enjoyed it (he would not even touch quinoa beforehand)

YUM, I'm so happy to have found this recipe!  I bought a big bag of quinoa from Costco and have been looking for delicious ways to use it up!  I agree with the other reviewers who say that 2 cans of black beans is overkill.  Unless you want beans to be the main ingredient in this dish, definitely stick with just one can so you get a perfect balance of the quinoa, beans and corn.  I also used chicken broth because I don't ever have vegetable broth on hand and I subbed paprika instead of the cayenne since my kids can detect even the slightest amount of heat!  As a result, even my two picky eaters loved this recipe, it made a great and filling lunch for us.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

We liked this a lot. I omitted the black pepper, added a tiny bit more cayenne and saved the salt for a sprinkle at the end. I also used a can of white Northern and a can of black beans because I didn't have two cans of black. I think it could use a bit more cilantro than called for. The listed cooking time was perfect!

I am not a quinoa fan, and I had high hopes for this recipe. It was super healthy, but I do think only one can of black beans is fine. I had a bite, and I really thought the quinoa was.. full of beans!
I will make this recipe again, but with one can of black beans instead of two.

This was my first time making quinoa and this recipe was so easy and so good! I am not a fan of cilantro, so I left that out. Also only added one can of beans as others have said. Two would be way too much. If you are on the fence about trying this recipe, I strongly suggest you try it! I got the quinoa in a box and I didn't have to rinse or soak it, and it turned out perfect each time I have made this by following the recipe's directions. Not bitter at all. Hubby & picky kids even ate it! Tastes good cold too!

I've made other quinoa dishes before, and I love it. I expected to like this recipe. I made this exactly as written except for backing off on the cayenne a bit. Still, all I could taste was cayenne and bland, unseasoned black beans. The flavor of the onions, garlic and quinoa all got lost. The real killer for me, though, was the texture. Just not enough variety. Sorry to pan it.

I had never had quinoa before. WOW!  I only added one can of black beans and added a bit of extra vegetable broth.  I will be making this again for sure!

Great recipe! I used chicken broth since I had it on hand, fresh cooked black beans, fresh corn cut from the cob, and added some zucchini and jalapeños. I would add some more spice next time but the cumin adds a good flavor. Tasted great with plenty of leftovers for tomorrow.

I'm always looking for something good for lunch and this dish will fit the bill. I used one can of the black beans instead of two, and right before I ate, I added some cut up avocado just because I had it on hand. I also added a little squeeze of lemon juice. I like quinoa and this is another recipe I'll add to my favorites.

Great and flavorful!  I didn't even use all of one can of black beans so agree with other reviewers.  Served it with grilled shrimp and veggies last night.  Great summer dinner.

Awesome.   Could eat it for days and days.   I followed one rviewer's advice and had it with avocado and raw cabbage wrapped in a whole wheat tortillas.  Also added lime while making.  Will definitely make again!

Yum!  I used 1 can of beans, which was enough.  I tried substituting frozen Brussels sprouts for the frozen corn.  I love Brussels sprouts but didn't work in this recipe.  Inexpensive, healthy, and delicious!  I will make it again and again.

Flavorful, healthy, looks good on a plate and doesn't take long to make... what more could you ask for in a recipe!?!? 

The cumin and cayenne give the dish flavor. I used the amount called for in the recipe as I have a 4 year old and she's very vocal if something is too spicy and won't eat it. It was a LITTLE spicy for her but it was also so good that she ate the corn, beans and red peppers that I added anyway! Will definitely make it again.

First time I have tried quinoa and wow am I impressed. Bought a bag of quinoa awhile back after having become a WeightWatchers member and seeing it listed as power food! This dish is outstanding.....eat it as is after cooking; refrigerate and eat cold; eat with chips, sour cream and cheese.....no matter how you eat it.....you will be pleased. We added a can of diced tomatoes for taste and color.....nice that you can try additional ingredients and it stays tasting great!

I make this as written, except only use 1 can of black beans.  It is delicious and I make it regularily for my lunches at work.  One recipe (one can of beans) makes 5 decent sized servings about 300 calories each.

This was tonight's dinner.  I used red quinoa for the first time.  Loved it!  This was a great dish.  Very easy to prepare and quick.  Because it's 90 degrees here, in South Jersey, it didn't take long to prepare and didn't heat the kitchen.

This was good - nothing exceptional, but a tasty enough dish.  I added the spices to the sauteed onions and garlic to bring out their flavor, and used homemade chicken stock.  I also adjusted cooking time according to the quinoa I bought.  I will probably make a version of this again, adding more spices and/or other veggies, such as green chiles, to the mix. I do not think 2 cans of beans were too much, as others did. Overall, a good recipe, and a very filling, healthy dish.

Really like this one. Simple and easy, and I already had the ingredients in my pantry and freezer. I didn't have fresh cilantro and used dried, which was just fine though fresh would be that much better. This is going to be a new staple in my cooking.

Very very good! Thank you for a new favourite! I found the recipe for Zesty Quinoa Salad first, so I sort of combined the two recipes. I added half a cup of quartered cherry tomatoes, the juice of one lime, and substituted crushed chili peppers in place of the cayenne. I also used no salt added canned corn, and didn't bother adding any salt. Otherwise I followed this recipe completely.

This was a hit with the whole family - a very satisfying entree.  I did add some green onions, and used 1 can of black soy beans and 1 can of garbanzo beans in place of the 2 cans of black beans.  I agree with the many other reviewers that a less bean/more quinoa ratio would be even better.  Can't wait to make it again trying more alterations and variations!

I cook once in a blue moon because I never have the patience for it...I tried this and it was so easy! And it tasted great! I love it - definitely making it again. The only change I made was use one can of beans...I think it would have been fine with two cans too. I just wanted fewer servings of it.

My family loved it. It's very tasty, if not terribly interesting, and the inclusion of the cayenne definitely makes the dish. I, too, added only one can of black beans, and that seemed to be just the right amount. I also didn't use cilantro (having none on hand--this is an excellent  "Augh, I have no fresh veggies" emergency dish), and it didn't seem to need it.

ETA: also, this made more like 5 servings (as a main dish) than 10.

The first time I ever tasted quinoa was a couple of years ago and it was not seasoned. It was so awful I swore off it immediately. I thought it looked like cooked birdseeds! 

  Well, today I was feeling the need to cook something healthy and this is the recipe i tried.  I did not have the corn, and instead of 2 cans of black beans I added one of black beans and one of pinto beans.  OMG! This is so delicious.  I wish my husband was home from work so we could eat dinner NOW.  Someone else thought it was bland, but I'm not sure how they could think that. All taste buds are not created equally, obviously!  To me, this is amazing.  I know my hubby will love it as well.

Excellent!  My husband has rated this his favorite quinoa dish!  Used chicken broth instead of vegetable (I don't think it really matters), one can of white beans (what I had on hand) and half of a red pepper.  It was very good.  The cayenne gives it a litttle kick.  I also think two cans of beans would be too much for my family's liking.  Will definitely make this again (and again)!

We all loved this recipe! My son especially enjoyed it and asked me to make it again.....
One thing I did differently than the recipe was I omitted one can of the black beans. If you put the left over in the refrig. you can put this in a wrap with hummus and veggies for the next day! Yum!

I love this recipe.  I make it and take it to work for lunch.  I've added diced tomatoes, green, red and yellow peppers and chicken.  Sometimes when I eat it I add a little Mexican cheese.

Good dish, but I found that there were too many beans using two cans. I also found it a little cilantro-heavy, but that might be because I removed ingredients and didn't compensate re: cilantro concentration. I scaled back a bit on the veggie broth because I'm watching my sodium intake and could not find a low-sodium option at the time. I just subbed in some water and it was still very good! I will be making this again.

I love this recipe almost as much as I love potato chips!  I substituted 3 cups of dry black beans. I soaked them overnight, then cooked them for about  1 ½ hours before adding them to the recipe (I may have lost some vitamins by cooking them so long – I need to research black bean cooking). I also added a fresh half cup of cilantro right before serving. I love cilantro and it added some nice color and spark to the dish. The next time, I might add a bit of avocado to top it off.

Even my husband liked it and he hates quinoa. (He would've given it 3 stars.) My daughter wanted seconds and my son started eating it with his hands so he could get more in his mouth. I halved the entire recipe to make 5 servings. I doubled the quinoa  and used double chicken broth and I used one can black beans and one can corn. Next time I will triple the the quinoa or add less beans and corn because I personally like a lot of quinoa. The other reviewers are right, there's more than enough black beans. I left out the cayenne pepper but added more black pepper.

Absolutely delicious. Makes a large batch. My husband isn't a fan of quinoa in general, but I am a huge fan-this smells great while cooking.

First time ever making quinoa, huge success. My guests and kids devoured it. I didn't have vegetable broth or cayenne pepper so I used chicken broth and chili powder in their place. Will definitely make this recipe again.

I love this but the spices are a little heavy, so I cut them down a bit. I also added chopped fresh cucumber and loved it, but only on the portions I served because otherwise the dish won't reheat well.

Loved this recipe!  I doubled it and did make some changes that pleased my New Mexican Family's taste...I doubled the cumin and instead of Cheyenne pepper, I added 2 Tbs. of red chili spice, 1 red bell pepper, 1 Tbs. of chili lime spice, 4 diced green chili peppers (2 with seeds and veins), and substituted chix broth for veggie broth.  I also halved the amount of black beans, as I didn't want it to overwhelm the dish.  I served this to my family as a "no meat" main dish, and THEY LOVED IT!  I am attempting to change their diets without a lot of whining and this meal is definitely going to help me to do that.  I don't think there is any veggie that you couldn't add to this dish to improve it!

Great Recipe! I added a packet of Goya without Annatto which gave it more flavour I thought. Also, I needed more chicken stock than the recipe called for. Everyone in my house loved it!

This recipe, was mixed with likes and dislikes. While my husband and I thought it was really good with the flavor and texture was different, no one had ever eaten it in our house. Only one child liked it fine, while the other 3 children wouldn't touch it after one bite. I'd make it again because my husband really enjoyed it and he asked that I find away to use it like rice. ;-)

Yummy! I can't believe I haven't put these ingredients together before. I added about 1 cup of chopped cabbage and I only had one can of black beans on hand, so I added a can of white northern beans as well. I left out the cilantro because I didn't have any and used chili powder instead of cayenne. I will definately make this again.

Very good!!  I hadn't used Quinoa before and I was weary of the texture, but got over that after first bite.  Perfect spices for us.  I only used one can of black beans and felt that was plenty.  Thanks for the healthy recipe!!

Very good. Others suggested adding only 1 can of beans, I agree! I did add a little bit of tomato sauce as it seemed to need it for some reason. Otherwise, VERY EASY, quick, tasty.

I found that this recipe was a little bland.  I made it again, and ended up adding double garlic and onion, and sauteeing the onions, garlic, cumin,and cayenne together until the aromas were quite strong...maybe 3-5 minutes or so on low heat...

Also, made a difference if you cooked the onions muuch longer on a very low heat so they were quite sweet and caramalized...

To make it a little healthier - I finely chopped kale and added it at the last minute with the corn... and it also made the flavours a little heartier - almost a "nutty" taste...

First time trying quinoa and loved it! I used 2 cups freshly boiled black beans and did not use salt or oil. It was still great.

I'd never had quinoa before and didn't know what to expect at all; I also don't really trust myself to properly prepare things with which I only have passing familiarity. I was pleasantly surprised, as it turns out: this was awesome! I know the recipe doesn't call for any particular type of frozen corn, but I used white and am really glad that I did. (Incidentally, now that I think about it, it's the same story for the onion: white onion = a good choice.) I halved the recipe and ended up using a whole can of beans, which I didn't think was too much...but then, I'm a pretty big fan of black beans. The only other place I deviated from the recipe was in adding avocado and grape tomatoes after cooking; getting a bite with a little bit of everything (quinoa, onion, corn, beans, cilantro, avocado, and tomato, all together) was pretty perfect.

The best quinoa recipe ever had!!! I add some penne pasta and make it a pasta salad.  The pasta could absorb any extra juice and add some texture.  As final touch I added some chopped parsley and basil for I love the freshness of any basil dish.  We just love this recipe, it's easy and flavorful.  It's packed of nutrients and will not add any burden to your body.  You could also add  some chicken sausage or diced chicken/turkey for more protein.

With all the great reviews I thought this would be so tasty.  It was not in my opinion.  I am sure the nutritional value is worth it, but it does lack flavor.  I did make with one can of beans and that did seem like plenty.

Wow this was soooo good!! The whole family loved it, even the kids.  My husband wanted more, but it was all ready gone.  I will be making this again real soon. The only thing I did different was I used only 1 can of beans, and it was the perfect amount.

I first tried this recipe a couple of years back and have made it several times. It is now one of my go-to recipes for several reasons: 1. Versatility.  I have cooked this with and without broth, with and without cilantro and cayenne and have added ground turkey several times to make it a main dish.  It is fantastic any way you do it. 2. This is a pantry meal.  I generally have everything on hand to make this delicious, nutritious option. 3. It is fast and easy.  Both the hubs and I work full time and having this recipe in my arsenal has made for several tasty dinners after a long day at work. I can't say enough good about this one.. eat it.  You will love it!

I made this recipe twice. First as written, second, with a few changes. I used only one can of black beans the second time as two cans made the bean taste too overwhelming. I also added additional garlic and used tomato based chicken bullion. The family thought recipe as it was written was just okay. The second version received rave reviews! This recipe is a great basic starting point to tweak according to the specific tastes of your family.

This is the first recipe I've made using quinoa. I really love this recipe.  I doubled the recipe but like some of the other posters I didn't use the amount of black beans it called for just because of preference.   This would really lend itself to using a variety of other add ins which I plan to try.   I only had chicken broth and I thought it gave a great taste.

Surprised my husband with a very flavorful vegan meal. It is also very filling. I made the mistake of thinking one onion would be too much and only used half an onion, I should have followed the recipe. If you want more flavor, you can also eat it with salsa on the side.

This is one of my favorites!  It reminds me of the flavors that you get at Chipotle, with a fraction of the cost. I bring it for lunches and a small amount fills me up and keeps me satisfied for the rest of the work day!

We tried this, and my parent's insisted on adding ground beef. It was very good. Making it tonight without beef. We personally love black beans, so two cans was perfect (although,  the beef may have evened it out.) We like more flavor too, so we added more cumin and more cayenne pepper. It is definitely a keeper for my family!

even without the beans, just followed the recipe more or less and it came out great, it was the spices and the vegetable broth that really gave it good flavor.

This was awesome, I did change it a little also. I added chicken broth instead of vegetable and red pepper instead of cayenne pepper. And just one can of black beans. This went along with my meatloaf perfect.

This was AMAZING! I added ground turkey for the kids and the carnivorous husband. I LOVED it without the meat and the kids asked me to make it again tomorrow. My extra picky 9 year old had seconds and was going to have thirds except he was too full. This will be a new go-to meal for us.

I actually loved this!  I left out the corn (diet) and used 1 can pinto beans instead of 2 black- what I had on hand and also I think 2 cans would be a lot of beans.  This had kind of a kick to it- the kiddos thought it was too spicy.  I think it had the right amount of spice.  Will def make again- possibly using 2 cans black beans b/c I love black beans- either way will be enjoying this one again.

This is a great side recipe (I served it with blackened chicken). I only used one can of black beans and a small can of corn. I also added bell peppers and a bit more cayenne pepper. My family really enjoyed and I will make this recipe instead of using a box beans and rice dish.

Even I loved it, and I'm not vegetarian - I cooked it for a large group where there were a lot of vegans, they all really liked it as well. It is a great recipe if you are looking for something pretty easy to make for a large group of vegetarians.

I made this with a mix of bulgur wheat and quinoa and tasted delicious! Even my boyfriend liked it and wanted me to pack it for his lunch, which is a rave review from someone who lives off of fast food. I have already forwarded this recipe to my sister. Looking forward to making it again!

This is a great recipe! I didn't have vegetable broth, frozen corn or cilantro. So I used chicken broth, canned corn and parsley. Everything else was the same. Thanks for a tasty and healthy recipe.

I love how simple this recipe is! It was extremely flavorful and tasty. My husband really enjoyed it too, who normally likes meals more with meat in it. 

I omitted the cilantro though because we don't like it, and I didn't have corn on hand - but I'm sure the corn would've made it twice as much better.

This is so very tasty and satisfying. My son is a vegetarian and I love to find new recipes he will eat. But you do not have to be a vegetarian to love this recipe.

Simple & nice blend of flavors.  I used half the amount of beans, a bit more corn, and double the amount of seasoning (it's seriously bland without the extra spices, I even added some chili powder for a hint of heat.)  I made some siracha/soy sauce marinaded broiled tofu, and it's a nice healthy meal.

Delicious! I used frozen peas instead of frozen corn-for more nutrition. Also, I added too much cumin so a good way to counteract the spice is to add some honey. This recipe is good cold or hot! I served with baked sweet potatoes

AWESOME!!! The whole family loved this recipe, and we will put this into our regular side dish rotation. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable and didn't use cilatro (we didn't have any) but otherwise as written.

This is a really great side.  Very tasty.  The only thing I changed was I only added one can of black beans. It was plenty, I think two may have been too much but that's just our tastes.

My whole family loved this recipe. First time eating quinoa. I bought a box of quinoa with the brown rice and cilantro seasoning packet at Wal-Mart it was total FAB. Just left everything the same except didn't add cilantro at the end since the package add that season included. Yummy.

Made this for lunch today and It was delicious! I made the recipe exactly as stated. Some of the reviews say that this would be way too many black beans, but I disagree. I think it turned out perfectly. I was expecting it to be fairly bland, but I was pleasantly surprised that it had a lot of flavor. I am putting this in my recipe book and will be absolutely be making it again. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This is my favorite recipe!  I changed my diet for the better about 6 months ago and this has been a staple in my diet.  Sometimes I add some ground flaxseed but otherwise I make it as is - delicious warm or cold.

I made it just as the recipe stated with the exception of the vegetable broth. I used beef broth because that is what I had. My husband and I both liked it and I plan on making it again and again.

Quinoa, black bean, and corn are not my fave, but in this recipe, they totally work!! Delicious. Will make again. I followed recipe exactly except I used only 1 can of black bean, which is definitely enough. And I didn't bother chopping the cilantro but threw them in whole. This way I can have the cilantro flavor but could pull out the leaves before eating.

I made this and it was okay.  I made it again with 1 can of black beans and adding 1 pound of ground beef and 1 can of Hot Rotella tomatoes and my whole family loved it!  It would also be awesome to make stuffed peppers.

First time I ever cooked with Quinoa and it was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted one of the cans of black beans with a can of diced tomatoes. I also added avocado just because we had some left over. Add to the recipe, but don't take away. Awesome!

I have made this recipe half dozen times now, and it always turns out great!  Use 1 can of black beans and double the cumin and cayenne pepper - the spices and flavor are perfect.  This tastes good cold or hot, tastes even better a few days after it's made, and freezes well.  It's one of my go to healthy weeknight recipes.

Absolutely amazing! Not only am I impressed with the ease of creating this dish, but the flavors. Yummy. There is nothing that needs tweeking at all. Only things that I have done because of the lack of ingredients or time. IE: Uncle Bens Ready Rice--brown rice with quinoa worked in a pinch and saved me 15 minutes, or using black-eyed peas or white beans in place of black beans. I could honestly eat this everyday. Bravo!

Super yum!!  You can buy quinoa at Trader Joes (it comes in red, multi-color, and white).  I used the white quinoa.  I cooked the quinoa in a rice cooker in vegetable broth PRIOR to starting the recipe.  Then, I sauteed the onions and garlic.  Then, threw in the quinoa, stirred in cumin and some oregano, and black beans and corn.  2 cans WAS a bit too much, but I thought 1 can wasn't enough.  So maybe 1 1/2 cans?  It was really really delicious - my hubby, picky 4 year old, AND baby all ate this complete protein-packed meal.  (Mom heaven!)  I cooked this with the Salsa Chicken recipe on this site (in a crockpot).  Also, served with soft avocados.  what a wonderful meal.  Thank yoU!!

Good dish, but I did a little tweaking. -only one can black beans, 1.5 cups corn, and .25 cup cilantro. I like cilantro but not much since it such an overpowering herb. We ate this inside of a vegan spinach wrap with salsa spread and vegan sour cream! SO good!

My family all loved this.  It was our first experience with quinoa.  I didn't have any canned black beans and I forgot to soak and cook my dried black beans so I used 1 15oz can of pinto beans.  I only used 1 can of beans after reading others reviews.  I thought 1 can of beans worked well.

This was great, and really easy to make.  We used red quinoa, which was pretty.  The only thing we did differently was using just one can of black beans instead of two.  For us, that was a perfect proportion-- I think two cans would have been too much.  Highly recommend this recipe, especially if you're trying to use more quinoa but are having trouble finding a quinoa dish you like.

Great flavor and easy to make.  This was my first recipe using quinoa and we were very pleased with the turn out.  Followed the recipe exactly as written and my husband loved it (was a bit spicy for me and will use 1/2 the cayenne next time.  Give it a try - it's a wonderful healthy alternative to a starchy side when you are trying to eat healthy!

Absolutely incredible!  Every recipe for quinoa I have tried, my kids have hated!  Even the super picky one had seconds while the others had thirds!  I used chicken broth instead of veggie and cut back on the beans like people suggested but the kids said that it could have had more beans.  I also used dried black beans and cooked them up first.  Awesome recipe and as the kids put away the leftovers, they were claiming "dibs" on this!

A keeper! The lid to my skillet broke so I had too put some extra broth in it. I made it as is and it is good. Second time I added a chopped green pepper so I could get rid of it before it went bad. and omitted the cilantro because I hate it (tastes like dish washing liquid to me). I also threw in a couple of slices of bacon and fished them out when it was done and the family raved. This is good as is and fun to play with!

The best recipe for Quinoa I'v tried, and my teenage kids loved them!
I tried the second time with double portion of Quinoa and broth, and we loved it even better! I did not put Cayenne pepper because we do not like anything too spicey, and they were still good.

Absolutely delicious!! I loved everything about it.. I'm amazed that so many people though it was bland.. I did use more broth flavoring than it called for because i wanted to use the whole bouillon so I'm sure that helped but  its not that hard to add more flavor if you think something is bland... I did only use 1 can of beans. I will be making this on a regular

This is a terrific recipe!  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It has a hint of heat but if you like it a little spicer I would recommend add a bit more cayenne.  This one is a keeper!

made this to have for lunch all week, and it is awesome, healthy & hearty. you can also do what you want with it! for the non-vegetarians out there, you could probably throw some chopped chicken or  steak in it to make it even more hearty. 

I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, chicken stock, extra spices (including a bit of chili powder), and only one can of black beans--everything else as-is. I put a bit of chopped avocado and shredded sharp cheddar on top for serving... so good!

Fantastic! The sweetness of the corn (I used canned) really offsets the other spices. You definitely only need one can of black beans, though. This was good with simple grilled chicken. I chopped up tomatoes and avacado on top. Yum!

great ingredients, decent flavor, but really lacking in any substance to stave off hunger. Added sour cream and cheese over top of lettuce and that made it pretty good.

I like this recipe ( I love black beans and corn anything!) but needed a little more spice.  more garlic and cilantro next time.  I also added some salsa to it to spice it up and it was good.  will make again, but with more spices.

I love this recipe too! It is my go to recipe for potlucks and whenever I have to bring a dish to share. I usually make double so I can have some for myself.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  Except I only use 1 can of black beans and that is plenty.  Only question, what the heck is a "serving"?!  How am I supposed to measure nutritional content if I don't know what a serving entails?  Is it 1 cup, 1/2 cup?  What is it?  I journal my food and want to make sure I am doing it accurately.  Please and thank you!

I thought this was a wonderful side dish!  Much as I love black beans, I did decide to forgo the second can as it just seemed to be a bit much.  It's light, spice is just about right for us and it was simple to put together.  I've also made this into an entree by adding browned ground round for my carnivore husband and cooking the quinoa in beef broth - also delicious.  And try a little shredded cheddar on top.  Very versatile.

This is DELICIOUS!!! Even my boyfriend, who is very finicky about eating healthy foods ate it right up and wanted seconds. I only used one can of black beans and used about 1 more cup of frozen corn than what the recipe called for. I also used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3. So yummy and I think I will make for a daily healthy lunch at work!

I only used one can of beans and that was plenty. I also didn't have any corn, but didn't miss it. I wish I had a clearer idea of how big a serving size is, though. I guessed about half a cup.

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a heartier preparation of quinoa than the popular cold salads. It definitely fulfilled my wish! I was amazed by how flavorful it is, and super easy to make. I didn't have any onion, but I thought it still tasted great without it. Also, I used just one can of beans. Thanks for a great recipe, I can't wait to make it for my gluten-free friends!

This was my family's first taste of quinoa and they loved it! And coming from a family of picky eaters, that's saying something! I found the recipe great on its own, though lately we've taken to cutting down on the cilantro a bit and adding some lemon for taste.

Fabulouse recipe.  The cumin was a little strong for my taste, so I cut it back a little the second time around. Used Chicken Broth instead.

First time I've made Quinoa. While I did like this recipe, especially the subtle spiciness, it was somewhat bland. I will make it again, but next time I think I'll use super sweet corn and maybe a bit of creole spice.

I've been needing more fiber in my diet and this is the perfect, tasty dish for that. Two superfoods in one meal! I'm sure we will try tweaking the spices over time, and maybe even try some kind of sauce or curry on it.

This was delicious! We had it lastnight. I didn't have vegetable stock, so I used water and a tablespoon of the chicken flavored low sodium 'better than bouillon.' I know this made it not completely vegetarian, but it got the chunk o' meat off the plate for one evening. My family is used to meat most nights, but my 7 year old asked when we can have this again. He said it tasted like a taco pizza in a bowl. Thank you for sharing this!

This is so delicious! I used chicken broth, and only 6 cilantro cubes (because those are what I had). This dish is savory, and aromatic, and scrumptious! I bet it is amazing with a the full 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro. I'll make this again per recipe!

My new favorite way to prepare quinoa! I think of it as southwestern quinoa. It's very tasty, but not so strong that my 4-year-old wouldn't eat it :)

This had a good flavor but was not great. However, it is very healthy.  I will probably try it again but add some additional spice to it.

Registered in here just to review this amazing recipe!  It was my first crack at quinoa, and I was desperately seeking a vegetarian recipethat would still satisfy a meat-eating me.  The cilantro makes this entire dish. I prefer green onion in these types of meals so I used that instead and I feel it really lived within the mexican-type theme of ingredients.  I used a little bit less than 2 15.5 oz. cans - perfect amount and kept it a hearty dish.  My mother and I ate this entire thing in one sitting.. so make lots!

This recipe was okay. I used plain water instead of vegetable broth, though, which may have led to the lack of flavor. This is the third time I've ever tried quinoa. Still not sure if I like it or not. The plus side of this recipe was that it was a cheap and easy way to stretch out the quinoa, which is expensive compared to rice/pasta.

This could have been better than is was.  Need to soak the quinoa so that the hard skin comes off, for hours!  Even then, not sure how it strains off.  The seasoning was good, may try it with couscous next time.

D-lish.  It is so easy to make.  I made it for myself since I am eating differently from my family and it was enough for 2 days.  Of course, it could have been more but I ate really healthy servings. I did use the 2 cans as stated but was concerned when I read the others saying they used one.  I am glad I used the 2.  I really like the beans so it was fine for me.  Great recipe!

The only reason I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars is because cayenne pepper was a bit too much and turned this dish a little too hot for our taste and wasn't able to give it to my daughter. I'll simply add a pinch next time. Other than that, this recipe is great. I've just discovered quinoa and needed ideas to cook it. This turned out just great (barring the cayenne pepper overload) my husband tried it for the first time and loved it (he's a cilantro addict so I knew it was going to be a hit with him). I'll be sure to incorporate this into my recipe rotation.

Well... I've been trying REALLY hard to eat a healthier diet, and this was a top rated recipe, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm sorry to leave a less than amazing review, because I have a feeling I just don't care for quinoa altogether. I tried it hot, I tried it cold, I tried it with more spice but it just didn't do anything for me. I had to mix it with the side dishes just to eat it. I could tell my boyfriend didn't like it either, but didn't want to hurt my feelings.. He said, "It's good! Just doesn't have as much flavor as last night's dinner.." :( So.. with that comment, I doubt I'll ever be making this again.

I have made this a handful of times.  Sometimes I find that it gets a little dry so I add the juice of 1 lime to the mix as I add the quinoa.  It adds a fresh flavor and keeps it from getting dry.  Delicious!!!!

I must have made this recipe at least 5 to 6 times already.  I normally use green peas in place of frozen corn but will one day try the recipe using the corn.  I really like quinoa so I use one cup instead of 3/4 cup.  Doing that I also changed the amount of vegetable broth to 2 cups.  I thought the 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper was a little much just because I'm not a guy that likes too much spice.  For anothers it may be just right.  Thanks for posting!  All the best!

Can use chicken boullion powder mixed with water according to directions in place of broth.  Only used 1/8th tsp of cayenne and kids still found it a bit spicy but they liked it.  I also added paprika, just a little less than 1/2 tsp.  Only use 1 can of beens as 2 is too much.  Make sure to simmer covered on very low or liquid is gone before quinoa is cooked.

Yes! this one is a keeper!  but i'm not sure where other reviewers are getting the 'soak quinoa' from?? perhaps it says it on their bag of it?! either way, definetely a healthy yummy hit!  made for main course - and my hubby is a big meat eater. loved it!  'why didn't you make more?" yay! i did accidently forget the corn, but was very keen to make sure i had cilantro. a big one. chicken stock and no cayenne, extra cumin (for the kid's sake), SO yummy!! SO !! yummy!!! thank1s

Huge hit with my family! The only change I made was to omit the cayenne. I served diced salsa style tomatoes (fire roasted) on the side to add the "heat" instead. I also served shredded sharp cheddar cheese on the side for my kiddos to add and they loved it! Will definitely be adding this one to the recipe box!

My first quinoa recipe EVER, and what a fantastic introduction!! My only changes were cooking the grain in plain water, and I substituted fresh roasted sweet corn off the cob for frozen. The sweet corn made a big difference as it was this added "character" to the dish with the little pops of sweetness with each bite. I also finished the dish off with a squeeze of fresh lime to add brightness. Totally making again!!!!!

I do not like quinoa by itself, or black beans, and I definitely don't like cilantro.  However, my husband and I are trying to eat healthy, so I sucked it up and made this.  For being so healthy, it is delicious.  I mixed shredded baked chicken into it, and we both enjoyed this recipe very much.  My only comment is that the two cans of black beans is way too much!  Only needed one.

4 stars for being just the taddest bit bland.  I added some roasted pasilla peppers though and it brightened right up for a dish my whole family was quite surprised by.  My kids balked at it immediately, and my husband said he'd go get something later and not to bother serving it. BUT....they all were pleasantly surprised by how delicious it turned out.  Definitely will be making againl.

This recipe was awesome. My husband and I had never made Quinoa before and much to our surprise it was so good. I read the other reviews and must say I agree that the next time we make it I will add some additional veggies. We give it 4 stars :)

This was delicious and simple.  The only changes I made were to add half an orange bell pepper chopped to the the onions and I also followed some other advice on here to simmer 15 minutes instead of 20.  It was such a good meal and lasted me all week.  But I didn't get sick of it and can't wait to have it again.

This was a very tasty and fairly quick meal to prepare.  I put mine into a whole wheat tortilla with a little vegan sour cream on top.  Perfect for a healthy lunch!

Delicious! Even my incredibly picky husband liked it. I only put one can of black beans in which was sufficient. I also put a little more cayenne in as I like the heat!

I added a drained canned of diced tomatoes, otherwise I followed the recipe. We put it in Corn tortillas with chopped avocado on top. It was yummy! I will definitely make it again. I might try adding a can of green chills next time for added flavor.

I like to add some Lime Juice and White Wine Vinegar at the end to make the taste a little brighter.  It also helps keep it fresh in the fridge!

Fantastic base!! Naturally I don't ever follow a recipe exactly and measuring isn't in my vocabulary but this recipe deserves recognition.  I also add juice from half a lemon after the salad is made and chop up cucumber and tomato...actually the lemon, tomato, and cucumber is a definite addition in my home but still again, GREAT BASE RECIPE!!

I follwed the recipe exact.  I even used the 2 cans of black bean that it calls for.  Some people are suggesting 1 can but I think the 2 cans was ok to use.  I thought it was great.  I will definately be making it again.

This recipe was SO delicious!  I haven't used quinoa for many recipes but I will use this recipe over and over.  My only change would be to use less black beans (and I love black beans).  Also next time, I will double the recipe!  Thanks!  :o)

I used one can black beans and one can corn (misread the recipe).  Added 1/2 t taco seasoning.  Next time I might add more spices.  I enjoyed this dish.  I thought it had a nice flavor.

Add Lin's Cilantro-Lime Dressing from Allrecipes and WOW!  You will want to lick the bowl !  
Eat it cold, warm... next day... delicious!
Changes I made to spice it up:  add chopped jalapeños and red bell peppers, bump up the cayenne pepper.

Yum!  What a fresh-tasting, healthy dish!  I omitted the cilantro as I don't like it, substituted chicken broth as that's what I had on hand and used fresh corn cut off the cob.  I halved the recipe and it was a perfect three servings.  This is a great recipe that enables you to put your own spin on it.  Will be making this again!

I made a few changes since some reviews claimed it was bland... 1/8 tea cayenne, 1/2 tea cumin, 1/2 tea coriander, 1/2 tea mustard, 1/2 tea curry powder.  I added fresh corn and a chopped green pepper.  I also used chicken broth, rather than veggie.  It was good.  Nice flavor & texture.  It would be good cold as well.

I made this as a sidedish for a party and it was my first time making quinoa. I really liked it but didn't get many compliments there. Maybe because it was the 4th of July and people would rather have the unhealthy sides.  I followed some other's advice and added zucchini and red bell pepper. It's a great recipe to alter to your liking.

This is a keeper. We ate it as a main dish.  The only comment I have is by the time it simmered for 20 minutes the onion was pretty mushy. Next time I will just very lightly saute the onion and add other veggies as others have suggested. The seasonings were just right.

Great side dish! I had to substitute chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable broth and I left out the corn because I didn't have that either. Also, I only used one can of black beans which was more than enough. I think 2 cans would have been too much. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was wonderful. Could have been a meal in itself, but I served it as a side to our dinner of chicken quesadillas.  My husband even liked it, and he doesn't usually like quinoa dishes.

Fantastic!  I've been trying to find a quinoa recipe that would please everyone and this is a winner.  I added about 1tbls of chile powder for extra spice and diced a zuchinni for extra veggie.  Was a big hit and will make again.

This is a GREAT recipe. I couldn't find plain quinoa in the store so I had to buy one that came seasoned.  I never had Quinoa before and I have been missing out.  Quinoa is great rice replacement.  I would definitely make this again!

This is a fantastic recipe! It's quick, easy, healthy and filling. I like this even better than my go-to recipe for rice and beans. It has more flavor, even without the traditional addition of pork (which also makes it a lot healthier than my rice and beans too).

I think the recipe calls for too much onion. I think it  would have tasted much better if 1/3 of the called onion was prepared.

This is a very impressive dish!  It is easy to make and has a wonderful presentation.  We made this as a main dish and were left satisfied after the meal (something that doesn't always happen with one dish meals).  I would eat this dish hot or cold, for lunch dinner or even a snack.  For my own taste I cut the cayenne pepper in half and added only 1 can of beans.  I could see adding a little more corn or chopped carrots for sweetness.

Perfect!  The only things I did differently were to cook my own black beans (reducing the sodium), I used vegetable base (just a teaspoon) to 1.5 c water (instead of the broth), and I did add a little red bell pepper to the sautee process.  So yummy...we're not vegetarians, but eating like this could easily turn me into one!

I made this for just me, hubbie and son are on a fishing trip!  I didn't have quinoa but I had exactly 3/4 cup of Jasmatti rice.  I didn't have cayenne (don't know why) but I had Penzys' chipotle seasoning I had recently purchased to try.  I threw in my last few fresh asparagus spears to steam at the end and had it with a Boca burger.  Wonderful flavors, definitely a do over!

I love this stuff!  I cook up a batch on the weekend and then take it for lunch during the week.  Makes me feel like I'm eating something really healthy and yummy too.  Hint: I add a little broth before reheating it in the microwave so that it doesn't taste too dry.

I already had quinoa cooked up, so my cooking steps were a bit altered.  I started with the cooking the onions & garlic in the pan, then added the seasoning, corn, black beans and cooked quinoa. And right before removing it from the heat, I added the cilantro.  It was quite tasty!

This was excellent!!  So easy and so yummy.  Like others, I omitted one can of black beans and just upped the amount of corn.  I used this as a side dish to Chipotle Marinated chicken skewers with veggies and it was perfect.  If I was using this as a main dish, I would definitely keep the 2nd can of black beans for the protein.  I also omitted the cayenne since I was serving this to my kids.  Instead I used about a teaspoon of Chili powder.

We love this, as a side dish or in a burrito wrap. And more importantly, our little girl (15 month old) loves it too!

I followed the recipe, but believe the time for the quinoa is off by about 5-10 minutes.  Unless you like it undercooked, I would add extra time.  I also substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  It was pretty good, but not a household favorite.

This recipe is fantastic. I just used 1 can of black beans, and added some Eastern ethiopian spice a friend gave me, called berbere. It was amazing, and I used the mix in stuffed peppers! Really flavorful and filling!

This was a great recipe. I added some roasted hatch chilis, because I love the extra spicet. I hadn't made quinoa before, and wasn't sure how it would taste... Honestly, it looks a little weird, but tastes fabulous. My partner even liked it, and she can be kind of skeptical of new things. Thanks!!

This was pretty tasty.  I used a bit more cumin and cayenne, doubled the garlic and corn, and also added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes.

My family really enjoyed this. Next time I will double the recipe because we ate it as a meal. The recipe states 10 servings so that must be side dish portions. I made it as is and it was  excellent. I think you could change it up from time to time with peppers, tomatoes, etc but it is really nice just like it is.

I'm very picky, but even I liked this! I used less beans (lessened the servings to 7 and then only used 1 can of beans) and cut down on some of the spices since I tend to like plainer foods. It was delicious on a tortilla.

Great recipe!  I made this for myself and gave some to my neighbor's teenage daughter.  She loved it so much she didn't share it with her family.  I did add chopped Roma tomatoes and added with the black beans and cilantro.  I also reduced the beans to (1) can and used canned, drained Mexican corn.  Will make this again

After hearing about these raging reviews I decided to take a shot at this recipe. It was yummy, but no where near the flavor I was expecting. I will say the best thing about this recipe is how cheap it is and how filled we were after eating it. My 6'4" man was even full after one bowl.

I've been making this recipe for years. It's good just as written, but also very versatile enough to "play with." We like to use the finished product as a filing for burritos. I do like to add bell peppers to mine.

I enjoyed it, but my husband and kids thought the cilantro was much too overpowering. I might try only 1/4 cup or less next time. Also, 2 cans of beans were too much. 1 would be better.

This was my family's first quinoa dish and they really liked it. After reading some reviews I rinsed the quinoa really well, only used one can of black beans, used chicken broth instead of veggie, and canned corn instead of frozen. I added some chopped green chiles and one diced tomato.  Nice that the recipe is flexible. Served with chicken tacos. Will definitely make again.

This was great for a quick weeknight meal. I used a red onion, omitted cayenne (for the kids), and replaced one of the cans of beans with some leftover rotisserie chicken breast that I had on hand. I also used chicken broth, since I had a carton open. Very flavorful and a hit with the family!

I love this recipe.  I use it every time I am introducing someone to quinoa and I always get rave reviews.  I only use one can of black beans and it is enough I feel.  I'm also not a big fan of cilantro, so I don't bother with it.

Unpleasant texture. Not the recipe's fault, though. I find quinoa to be mushy.

Love this!  Like many other reviewers, I cut back the black beans to one can (and used the no salt added variety).  Next time I'll probably add more cumin and cayenne.  I like the flavor but would like it a little bolder.

This is an easy and very tasty recipe.  I like spicy, so I upped the amount of spice and added coriander. This dish is good cold as well. Don't skimp on the cilantro.

This was easy to make and delicious! Every one loved it! The only thing I did was add some diced green peppers and tomatoes! I'm always looking for new recipes with Quinoa and I have another great one to add to my list!

I normally try to make every recipe as stated the first time THEN modify, but I'd already started when I realized I didn't have it all.  My imagination is good enough to know I would've still rated this 5 stars, because my variations = 6!!

Here are some things I had to do that might be tips if you find yourself in a similar bind (some due to suggestions of other reviewers - thank you!).

I did not have vegetable broth (though I'd thought I did).  I didn't do chicken broth & tomato juice from canned tomatoes, I did do chicken broth with black bean and corn salsa.  I also upped the quantity of liquid to what the quinoa box said (vs the recipe).  

I added lime juice because it seems like a sin to use cumin without it, also added adobo and chipotle.  I only had Red Inca Quinoa.

I also only had freeze dried garlic and red onion, so I used a hefty one.

I didn't have enough black beans so used a can of chick peas.  Hubby liked them - I wish I had used less because, and I can't believe I'm saying this, the quinoa itself was the star.  1 can of black beans was probably okay, the corn was great (I LOVED having added salsa and even added more - gave great depth) but I started to get mad at the chick peas for getting between me and this delicious, delicious quinoa.

Last time I made quinoa we HATED it, and we're both health nuts and decent cooks, so we didn't have high hopes.  

This.  Was.  Awesome.

Trust it!

It's going to be a new staple in our house! SO good, cheap, and healthy!

This was really good!  I doubled the recipe and made a couple changes after reading through some reviews: added 3 cans of beans (instead of 4 which would have been double) - and there were PLENTY of beans, used 2T minced onion and ~5 to 6 tsp of the refrigerated minced garlic, and added 1 can of original Rotel.  It was quite spicy but good, REALLY delicious with some diced avocado on top!

Loved this recipe.  Very basic but lots of potential. My changes:  rinsed and saoaked quinoa for about an hour then toasted.  I also lightly "roasted" corn with a teaspoon of whole cumin with a minimal of olive oil in a non stick pan prior to use.  Added 1/2package of frozen spinach.  Squeeze of lemon before serving

Very good. First time I've had quinoa and it was wonderful. The corn adds just the right amount of sweetness.

Not sure the nutritional value is correct, specifically the calorie count. Quinoa alone is 172 calories for a 1/4 cup.

This was wonderful!    I made a few substitutions and it was still excellent.  I substituted water for vegetable broth, canned corn drained for frozen and at the advice of a friend I added a can of slightly drained Rotel tomatoes.

Love this....this is so filling and delish I ate it for dinner 3 nites in a row.  I only used one can of black beans but that seemed like plenty.  Such a great way to add grains to your diet.

This was my first attempt at making Quinoa and I was pleased with the result.  The recipe was easy and the outcome, well 'tasty' and nutritional.  My husband really liked it.  We are wanting to cook healthier food and this has low calories and is absolutely yum yum.

Very tasty and healthy! I added corn, chilli powder, and fresh lime juice to give it a bit more of a southwestern vibe. The lime pairs really well with the cilantro and gives this recepie an extra kick!

This was EXCELLENT! I didn't have the frozen corn, but I had a can and just used that. I also didn't use the cayenne since I am not a fan of very spicy food, but I sprinkled a teeny bit of red pepper flakes in, a little bit of heat which my tastebuds can handle. I would think this would be amazing with some lime sprinkled on it, but I have not tried that yet. I will very soon!

I am not much of a cook (understatement), but this dish was simple and so so good. Healthy too! I added bell peppers and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I'm definitely going to be making this a lot!

This was my husband and my first time trying quinoa. He is on a diet, so we were searching for healthy, low calorie foods. This definitely pleased us both. It is full of flavor and easy to make. I used one can of beans instead of two and thought that this worked out well.

Made this two nights ago. I'm attempting to become Vegan and trying not to starve my husband in the process, so I'm being careful on what I make to feed him. I really liked this recipe as is... However, to him, it was a bit bland, so he went and found a can of Original recipe Rotel Tomatoes and dumped those into the saucepan as well. The Rotel Tomatoes did add a bit more flare into the taste! (He also covered his portion in queso.) I've still been eating the leftovers for the last two days, and it was much spicier today than before!

This recipe was sooo good!  I was hesitant to try it fearing my expensive quinoa would end up as chicken feed but it was great.  The only change I had to make was substituting canned corn for frozen and I found that I really liked the tender sweetness of the canned corn.  Cilantro is a strong flavored herb that people either love or hate so add with caution.  That being said, since it also turns brown quickly, instead of adding it to the dish I just spinkled it on individual servings to taste so that leftovers wouldn't have slimy brown leaves the next day.  I will definately make this again!

This tasted amazing! It was my first time making quinoa and I was very happy with the outcome. The only changes I made were that I used chicken stock instead of vegetable broth because that's what I had in the fridge. I used 1 teaspoon of cayenne becuase I love my food spicy and I only used1 can of black beans.

LOVE THIS!  Was my first attempt at make quinoa and I picked a winner!   I used organic red quinoa from Whole Foods and did NOT rinse it.  I only used 1 can of black beans and 1 whole can of Mexicorn (instead of frozen).  Next time I’ll probably add both cans of beans as it would have made it go even further.  But it makes a ton!  My hubby has never had quinoa before and he LOVED it.  Went back for seconds...and he never likes anything healthy!  Can't say enough great things about this recipe!  Thanks, Lioncubs!

AWESOME recipe! It's fast, healthy, and goes well with chips, tortillas with melted cheese, etc. Added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies to up the health/taste factor. Seasonings were just right. THANK YOU for this keeper!:)

This was the first time I cooked quinoa and I loved it!    I used chicken buillion instead of vegetable broth and minced a whole red pepper along with the cloves of garlic.  Also, I used canned corn and kidney beans.

This is a staple in our home.  My kids love it with red quinoa for a heartier flavor.  I use 1/2 cup of quinoa, one can each of corn and black beans for a healthy side dish or quick snack.

Easy, Delicious and liked not having to going to  the store. Didnt have an onion or garlic so I used garlic and onion powder. Added a can of no salt diced tomatoes for color. I enjoy lots of flavor so i doubled cumin, cayenne and added about a tbsp of taco seasoning I had on hand. Finished with a dollop of sour cream and a bit of shredded cheese! Will add to repertoire!

This was a very simple and very delicious recipe. Like some other reviewers, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil (it's really only to saute the onions and garlic so either will work), added a red bell pepper with the corn for a little extra sweetness and crunch, increased the amount of cayenne pepper (i like my food spicy) and only used one can of black beans. For my first experience cooking with quinoa, I'd say this was a success! Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for the first time today and it was wonderful!  I did soak and rinse the quinoa for about 10 minutes before cooking and I only used 1 can of black beans (because that is what I had on hand).  Great dish - I will make it again!

Very yummy! Agree with others that only 1 can of black beans is needed. We used the leftovers in some turkey burritos and it added good flavor & texture. I cooked chicken breasts on the side, but I think next time I will add chunks of chicken to make it a complete meal.

I am I the last person out there to find quinoa?  Better late than never.  I added some fresh zuchini and tomatoes with the black beans.  Fabulous!  It was even better the next day when the spices had time to settle absorb.

Delicious!  This was our first experience with quinoa, and we're in love!  We didn't soak the grain, and it was fine.  Fresh tomato at the end was the icing on the cake.

First time with quinoa, absolutely fabulous! Served as a side dish with chicken, we couldn't get enough of it. It could totally be a whole meal...I added a little cajun spice because we like it hot and it was to die for!

AMAZING. I've made this several times with all different variations depending what I have on hand(no cilantro, leave it out still delicious). Too many tomatoes on hand chop and add with the beans. This is one of the best recipes ever. Even my meat lovers love it. Vegetable or Chicken broth works just fine. Sometimes I serve with reduced fat shredded mexican cheese blend and whole wheat tortillas to wrap it in.

This is an awesome vegeterian recipe that goes well with many other dishes. I would personally put less corn into the dish and add more beans and spices.

Hubby and I like this, kids did not care for it.  I think 2 cans of black beans would be a little much.  Added 2-3 teaspoons of lime juice at the end.

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  This will be on weekly rotation for a long while.  We skipped the corn as we did not have any and it was still unbelievably good.  In the words of my fiance.. "this is dynomite...oh my god..."  :)

Great Dish! I added some peppers to the saute, and used an organic bean medley instead of just black beans (chick peas, red beans, etc). Simply delicious - thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first time cooking quinoa - I was a little worried about the hubby liking it but he thought it was fantastic! Stuck with 1 can of black beans, used roasted corn from Trader Joes and served with a few slices of avocado and a dollop of sour cream.  YUM!

Loved this recipe.  I roasted fresh corn and red peppers and added before serving. I used just one can of black beans, for the kids sake.  I would have liked it either way.

This was my family's first intro to quinoa.  We don't like cilantro so I left that out and had to use beef broth instead of vegetable, but even so this was a huge hit!  It had great flavor.

I prepared this as a side dish to steaks and my bofriend and I really enjoyed it. He is a very picky eater so I was skeptical to make it, but really wanted to try a healthy alternative to rice. I ended up using just 1 can of beans and added red bell pepper. We were both surprised at how flavorful it was. There was plenty left over. I will definitely make this again!

Really tasty dish.  Very easy to make.  I used fresh corn that I cut off a cob which was leftover.  That worked out fine, and mixed together frozen corn as well.  It is a bit spicy, but everyone who I served it to, liked it, and my niece, who thought she didn't like Quinoa...asked me for the recipe...so it must be good.

FANTASTIC! I love a recipe that's open to interpretation. I didn't have any veg. broth, so i used beef since i had already started and couldn't turn back. I agree that 1 can of black beans is more than enough. I also added a diced yellow pepper, and have about a cup of fresh salsa, just to use it up. I was also EXTREMELY liberal with the cilantro, but I love it. Like I said, open to interpretation! Go wild with this one, you'll still love it in the morning!

This is a good basic, simple quinoa recipe.  An ideal start for first time users of quinoa.  I'll add chilis and a few other aromatics next time.

This is so great!  Reading the recipe, I was skeptical, and I mostly made this because I needed to use up two ears of corn and happened to have the rest of the ingredients....best decision to make!  The recipe is deceivingly simple.  I used two ears of fresh corn instead of frozen corn, and like other reviewers, I only added one can of black beans.  I also didn't have the cilantro but it was great anyway :)  I ate it warm for dinner last night and cold for lunch today and it's great both ways!!

Very Yummy!!!!

I followed the recipe, but decided to add a can of tomatoes and green chilies at the last minute.
Tastes good and healthy as is, or with a small dollop of sour cream.

Thanks! So yummy!!!

Love this recipe! I prefer it warm/room temp. I added roasted red peppers for color and flavor, and usually serve it over greens with avocado as garnish and make a cilantro dressing to drizzle over. Leftovers are great right out of the fridge.

Good, but bland and texture was all the same.  I had it one night and it was good enough, but wanted it next day, and was not looking forward to it.  So I added half a diced red pepper, half a diced green pepper, pignioli nuts, a nice fresh field-grown tomato, diced, 2 celery sticks, red wine vinegar, olive oil and more tabasco, and more corn.  Gave it more of a crunch.

I wish I could give this dish more stars!  The first time I made it, I put in half of the amount of cayenne pepper.  I am terminally "Caucasian" and I was afraid it would be too spicy.  It was delicious, but could use a little more spice.  So, the 2nd time I made it, I made it exactly as written and ohmygoodness!!  It's my favorite thing to eat!

Unbelievably good! And low in calories and fat. Easy to make. The whole family loved it! I used the two cans of beans which seemed just right. The only addition I made was a yellow pepper which I had on hand.

I made this for a family barbecue and it got rave reviews! My mom even asked for the recipe the next day so she could make it for visitors. It has a nice flavor that makes people guess what's in it but it's not too overwhelming. It even tastes good served cold the next day. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe!

This recipe was my first experience with quinoa.  I love it and every time I make it I get asked for the recipe.  My husband had bought a box of quinoa and after moving the box around on the shelf for about six months I found this recipe and love the southwest flavor.  I tried making it with chicken broth when I did not have the vegetable broth available and was disappointed in the flavor.

Oh My G-d!  This is my first time making quinoa and I was a bit nervous.  I took comfort that the flavor profile is one that I love and that there were so many great reviews.  Nothing could have prepared me, though for how great this is!   I used quinoa beads from Trader Joe's and didn't rinse or soak them. Just tossed them in  with a little more onions and garlic than called for.  I also upped the cilantro a tad because I chopped a little too much.  I added the beans I had on hand, 1 can of black and 1/2 can of white with a cup of canned corn. It seemed like it needed just a bit of color so I also chopped some red, yellow and orange mini sweet peppers. Delish!  We will be adding this to our regular recipe rotation!

This was the first time I ever tried Quinoa and was surpisingly pleased with it.  I also made a few changed to the recipe, using red choli pepper, coriander and fresh oregano since I didn't have any cumin on hand.  I also only used one can of beans and substitued pinto beans.  I had seconds and served it as a side dish however could definately be a main dish.  It was flavored just perfect and can't wait for the left-overs tomorrow!

This was my first attempt at quinoa. After looking at other cooking directions I believe this cooks too long. Mine was over cooked. Other than that, I loved the flavors. I did add about a half can of drained rotel. Loved the cilantro. I will definitely make this again with less cooking time.

Delicious, healthy and very filling. I served it with grilled salmon, but it could be a stand-alone meal. Quinoa can be very bland - but you would never know it using this recipe!

AMAZING! I've never cooked quinoa before, but now I'm sold. My changes: 4 cloves of garlic and chicken broth (UPDATE: 2nd time I used slightly less than 1.5 cups, and it was less liquidy; UPDATE2: 3rd time I used 1 cup of quinoa and 1 can of 14.5oz chicken broth... that is the PERFECT PROPORTION!), no corn, 1 can black beans, 1/2 bunch cilantro chopped (stems and leaves). I made sure to rinse quinoa well before cooking. Simmer covered for 20 minutes, then uncover and cook for 5 minutes (whether or not you add the corn - I don't). The quinoa should be slightly moist when done/there should still be a hint of broth at the bottom of the pan.

Super easy, super healthy.  Added (brace yourself) blueberries and nectarine pieces to offset the cayenne for my son and wow- what a wonderful idea!  It really gave it a nice summer salad feel at the end of a hot day.  I also used black quinoa instead since that's what I had on hand and 1/2 cup chicken broth with 1 cup water since that's what was in the pantry.  It was a huge hit with my husband, four-year-old, one-year-old, and me.  And now we have lots of leftovers as well. Give it a try!

Absolutely amazing! I didn't change a thing, though I only had one can of black beans, and it turned out to be plenty.  The cumin and cayenne pepper mixed with the sauteed onion and garlic makes this dish something way more exciting than the usual black beans and quinoa. It's mildly spicy, flavorful, cheap, and really easy to make. I paired it with rainbow trout and it was one of my favorite meals. I will definitely make this over and over again!

I love quinoa and I have been looking for new ways to include it more meals.  This will be a new addition to my rotation.  I think it will please everyone in the house.  A little bit of heat, flavorful and healthy.  This will be a bbq salad, main dish and burrito filling.  Awesome!

Great meatless dinner option.  We both really liked this.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and just one can of black beans.  I served this with cheese quesadillas on the side.

This was a very quick and simple recipe. My daughter has many food allergies but this is something she could eat, minus the corn. I only had one can of black beans on hand so I used it and one can of chickpeas. Instead of corn, I used frozen peas and carrots. This recipe is a keeper.

Really excellent. I've made this recipe twice so far and have loved it both times. I don't think it needs any changes for it to be perfect but it's one of those dishes that you could add millions of different spice combinations and it should work fine. I've had it both hot and cold and I think I prefer it cold. I'll be making this for a long time. Thanks for the recipe.

Great first recipe for quinoa! If you would like to try this terrific grain, I would strongly encourage you to try this recipe. It is a family pleaser. My husband loved it.

my family's first attempt at quinoa was a success!! thank you!! was scared of the saponin and set in water for 15 then triple rinsed. not a hint of bitter. my boyfriend actually ate it and our picky 2 year old asked for more! topped with some salsa and sour cream (because it was way too healthy for us anyway..:)). didn't have cilantro or cayenne and still was awesome! made a hugeee batch. should have scaled down for the three of us. planning on adding some taco seasoned chicken to make it a main dish. if you're new to quinoa too, its a great place to start!!

Amazing. This goes with a lot of meats. We've had it on the side of beef, pork and chicken. Best part? Next day, chopping up the leftover meat and throwing it in the mix. Didn't change the recipe, it's great the way it is.

A little bland...would definitely add more kick next time.  Maybe I'll follow others' suggestions and throw in a can of tomatoes with green chiles.

The reviews were all spot on. This dish is AMAZING. I followed the directions adding a bit more cayenne pepper and garnishing with fresh avocado and it couldn't have come out more delicious. This was my first time eating and cooking quinoa and I couldn't have thought of a better intro to this delicious grain.

I NEVER rate or review things, but this was just so good that I had to add my praises! The only thing I differently was double the cumin (we really like cumin). I will be making this again and quite often! So so so yummy!!!

This came out pretty good - I had fresh corn off the cob, so I sauteed it a little with the onions and garlic.  Would have been great with grilled corn, but our grill was out of commission.  I added another teaspoon of cumin after mixing everything together.  I may stir in some chopped tomatoes and a squirt of lime juice with the leftovers.  This was good as stated, but missing a little something, I think.

This was my first time using quinoa, and it turned out perfectly. The recipe was simple and straightforward. The ingredients were cheap and easily available at the grocery store. 

I had to use much more veggie broth than the recipe called for because it started to dry out as the quinoa was cooking.

I think in the future I will try putting some fresh tomato or avocado top. For a side dish, this is great, but as a meal it's missing a little oomph.

This was very tasty. I added some diced tomatoes as one reviewer suggested. It didn't come out quite as I expected, but we used it as a filling for burritos and were really happy with the way it worked out.

This recipe is a masterpiece.  Subtle spice with a hint of garlic.  The black beans, corn and quinoa blend perfectly into a main dish or a side.

Wow, this was way better than I thought it would be.  I omitted corn & cilantro since I don't like either.  I only did one can of beans and added 1/2 lb of Italian sausage.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is delicious just as written, but I also like to add diced tomatoes and avocados. It's also very versatile. We like to eat it as the main dish served with chips, on top of lettuce for a taco salad, or rolled into tortillas and baked for healthy crisp bean and quinoa burritos.

This is one of my new favorite dishes! I switched it up a bit - I took out the corn, added peppers and mushrooms. I also squeezed some lime on it at the end, which made a huge and delicious difference. It is also an amazing addition to put a dollop of homemade guacamole on top after serving it. Try it!

I made this as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  I did use canned corn, it's what I had on hand.   I made this several times and used red quinoa.  It's a great vegan dish.

This is deicious! I added red pepper and some hot sauce. Sadly, I didn't have any cilantro, I imagine that would only make it better! This is an easy, healthy dish that I will definitely make again.

this was my first time trying quinoa and it was rather tasty. i only used about 1/4 cup of cilantro as i find it rather overpowering, but it does add a good touch. i also added a a little bit of mexican blend cheese on top when serving it. but i'm definitely going to make this again

We loved this at our house.  I used olive oil and chicken broth instead and only one can of black beans.  We're already thinking about how to make tacos with it.

I made this as-is except a few tweaks because of what I had on hand: olive oil instead of vegetable oil chicken broth instead of vegetable broth  I also used 1/2tsp cayenne pepper, omitted the corn because of personal preference, and only used one can of beans because of user comments.  I also bought chopped onion from trader joe's and used a cup of it.  Overall, a good recipe, but I think the original recipe called for too much cilantro.  I will definitely make again, but next time with only 1/4c cilantro, and maybe more of the chopped onion.

This recipe is SO delicious! I try to make this once every couple weeks- but I could eat it at least once each week. It is so versitile-I have added red pepper, anaheim peppers, grilled chicken, lime, and tomatoes to different batches and it all tastes great!

This recipe is fantastic! I leave out the corn because I don't care for it in my dishes. Otherwise I make it exactly as written. I made this for my mom who's on a gluten-free diet and for my friend's family who's mom has cancer and is on a high protein, low fat diet. They all raved about it! I consider it an especially high honor that the meat-lovers who ate it said they didn't even miss the meat! What a find, thank you!

This recipe was delicious!  I added an extra can of beans, black olives and red bell pepper for a more filling meal.

You can use this as a base and add anything besides the corn and black bean.  I've tried adding broccoli in the last 5 min and then cashews at the last minute and it was great.  Nice side dish but also kind of bland so I'd try different combinations of veggies and nuts to punch up the flavor.

This was fantastic, but don't let the picture fool you. I thought it would be quinoa with some beans and corn, but it's all about equal parts. Still, it was a fantastic combination! I think I will use green onions next time instead of white onion as it has more flavor. I ate the leftovers cold for lunch today and it was even better than last night!

Love this recipe! The flavors go together perfectly and it has just the right amount of spice. I used one can of black beans and about a cup of quinoa and served as the main dish with a salad. So, so yummy!!

1st time cooking quinoa and i am SUPER happy with this recipe.  I only used 1 can of beans and I used chicken stock... added sauteed zucchini and tofu.  Perfect for a cold Chicago night!   thank you!

I thought this dish was just "ok".  Kinda bland for my taste.  I have never eaten Quinoa before so maybe I just didn't know what to expect.  My 3 year old son loved it!!  I made it with chicken broth instead of veggie broth, only one can of black beans, leftover roasted chicken cubed and I doubled the cayenne pepper.  This recipe however has great potential!  I plan to make it again, but add more spices and more veggies.   I will double the spices and add a can of tomatoes with jalapenos undrained, red bell pepper and I thought it needed more cilantro. My husband and I love spicy spicy food so I will definitly kick it up a few more notches, maybe add some red pepper flakes.

Excellent recipe, though I agree with a lot of other reviewers in that it needs a bit of tweaking.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the spices.  I like it on the spicier side, so after trying it a couple times, I tried adding in a teaspoon of chipotle/adobo sauce which lended some smokiness to the flavor. I also added a squeeze of lime at the end and melted a little bit of cheese over each bowl and YUM!  A definite new staple in our house.

I could not believe how bland this dish was after reading the reviews.  I did not have fresh cilantro, but didn't think it would make THAT big of a difference.  Decided to add curry, much better!

Delicious, quick and easy! All the things I look for in a recipe. Oh, not to mention healthy. You can also add other veggies and I find chicken works really well too.

Delicious. I, too, only used one can of black beans for fear of overpowering the quinoa. But this was one of the best things I've ever made. So easy but tastes like you worked HARD. Plus, even my non-vegetarian husband thought it was fantastic. Thanks!

For my first try with this recipe I thought it turned out well and would definitely look at how other people added their own touches to it.  I am not really a vegetarian but am trying to eat healthier foods, this was very tasty and full of flavor.  Next time maybe a little chicken breast or pork would be nice to try.

Awesome!  I love the flavor the quinoa adds.  I doubled the recipe but used 2 cans of bb.  I also added 1 orange pepper and a can of diced tomatoes.  I used the liquid in the tomatoes in place of some of the veggie broth.

Very good!  Meal in and of itself!  I didn't add corn.  I added chopped tomatoes and avocado instead.  Also added chopped parsley (didn't have cilantro) and chives.  I like it cold for lunch the next day!

This recipe tasted great and was very easy to make. I substituted roasted red peppers for the corn. You also only need one can of black beans. The cumin and pepper added just the right amount of flavor. I highly recommend this recipe.

Wow... I am usually not a brave person to try new recipes. Glad I did this one. Followed it almost exactly. (I rinsed the quinoa - sort of....soaked them - need to find a tiny mesh container to rinse them next time! The little boogers went everywhere!) The flavors were incredible!  Easy enough even for beginners. YUM

i thought this was very good but i didn't use  a half cup cilantro it would have been way to strong. if your not a fan of it as i'm not, then i used only a tbsp. also i only used one can of black beans I think 2 would have been way too many. I loved it and will make it again

We love this dish!  I make it as written except for the cilantro and adding a dash of chipotle powder.  It's a great vegetarian main dish (we add some cheese on top).  My veg son takes it to school for lunch and eats it cold (w/o cheese).  He says it's great.  It is easy and tasty - what more could you ask for?  Thank you for this recipe!

I made this recipe twice.  Both times it turned out very good.  Made it almost exactly except substituted spinach for cilantro.  Really liked the texture and combination of the ingredients.  I think I should have added more cumin and pepper - just didn't have much flavor due to the other more bland ingredients.  Added "Priya" Garlic Pickle sauce we got from the Indian Market after it was cooked, and it was delicious!

Though I have used this site for years, I have never written a review... until today.  This recipe is amazingly delicious!  My husband & I could not stop eating it.  The only change I made was adding a little liquid smoke because I didn't have any cumin.  Other than that I followed it exactly.  I can't wait to make it again!  Yum!

We found this to be a fabulous dish. It was spicier than I expected (so much so that I went back and checked to make sure I had indeed used the 1/4 tsp and not something else). The only changes we made were using water instead of broth (we were out) and we decided to only use one can of beans. It was a bit too spicy for our 9 year old. She added sour cream to it and then she loved it. We found it to be a very pretty dish as well.

I am in the process of switching to more vegetarian eating and this was my first dish that I made using quinoa and I have to say it was fabulous! It was much better than I expected it to be. My husband liked it and my 5 and 2 year old even ate it. The flavors are great, although I would maybe use a little less cumin but that is just my taste. I will for sure be making this again!!

First time to cook with quinoa.  Read up on it- an amazing grain and so good for you.  I only had one can of black beans on hand so substituted one can of purple hull peas.  Also used chipotle chil powder instead of cayenne because that just sounded right to me.  It was pretty darned good- I am thinking it will be even better tomorrow when cold.  I will make again for sure.

One of the best recipes on this site, hands-down.  Thank you 3LIONCUBS, you have made my boyfriend and I into healthy aztec warriors.  We make a big batch of this on a sunday night and divide it into tupperware containers for ready-made lunches to take to work.  So good!

Excellent! My husband was skeptical about this dish, but he had seconds and went on about how tasty this dish was. 9yr old LOVED it too. Do try this recipe as you won't be disappointed. Definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good the first day...then after that it was freaking awesome. It is even good cold! My 1 year old who is somewhat of a picky eater loved it. I find myself craving for it. Weird huh??Yummmmmm!

This was really good and a very different flavor. i substituted 2 cups brown rice for quinoa because my local grocery store didn't sell it. i also used chicken broth instead of vegetable. Everything blended well and was delicious. next time i will cut back on the cilantro, it has a very strong presence in this recipe but that is just personal taste. i will be making this again!

This recipe is fantastic. The dish is delicious, healthy, and easy to make. I kicked the spices up by half and added some red pepper flakes, but I like my food spicier than most. The spice levels in the recipe are probably right for most palates.

I had to use more vegetable oil - more like 1 tablespoon and a half. Also used kernels from one ear of fresh corn. Two cans of beans would have been too much - 1 was just right. next time I will toss in some diced tomatoes at the end. YUM

This was pretty decent with some salsa chicken I made last night.  I added a little lime juice (1/2 of a lime), but I thought it was still a little boring.  Next time, I will probably add a can of Rotel, as I think that would give it the punch it needs.

I prepared the dish per the recipe and it was good, not great. I just felt it was rather bland and one level tastewise. I think I would have preferred it with a can of Rotel or maybe something crunchy like a bell pepper or maybe come crunchy green onions. Overall, it's a good recipe, but one I probably won't make again.

This was my first experience with quinoa and now I am a believer.  I agree that this recipe only needs one can of beans, but other than that, it is perfect.  Although, in my house it would not feed 10 people, more like five, because we could not quit eating it.  Yum.

Perfectly Protein!! This is such a yummy recipe! I didn't have cilantro and it didn't make a difference without it. I also put a little chicken in it but it is packed full of protein without it. Can't wait to make it again!

Very good.  I added chopped fresh red pepper and shelled edamame and therefore needed to add more spices, but was great as a side dish with grilled chicken.  Yum!

This was a little bland but still very good. It has HUGE potential. This is my first time trying quinoa so I followed the recipe except subbed chicken broth for veggie broth. I will be making this again, with some additions to kicked it up a bit.

As newly diagnosed with celiac, I decided to give guinoa a try to give us another option to rice and potatoes. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was great! My minor changes to the recipe....used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and added chopped green peppers when I added the frozen corn. I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch at work! Also looking forward to trying other quinoa recipes! This is a keeper. Thanks!

This is the first, and only, recipe I have tried using quinoa I am so glad, it was delicious! My BF even thought is was great and he hates healthy food.  I did add a red bell peppr, used chicken broth instead of vegetable and squeezed lime juice from one lime in at the end. Also, I didn't have cayenne pepper so I substituted chipotle powder. Tastes like a mexican dish and I was VERY pleased! I will DEFINATELY make this over and over again!

Cooked this up today for lunch.  It was really good.  I had it with a high fiber tortilla, low fat cheese and sour cream.  My 14 year old son had it in a bowl.  It passed the test and is now going to be a regular around our house! Low fat, nutritious, and yummy!

This was the very first Quinoa dish I've ever eaten and I was very impressed.  My husband and I have cut most of the meat out of our diet and we were a little afraid this wouldn't be satisfying enough on it's own but it works beautifully as a main dish.  Very satisfying and overall fantastic!

This is one of the best tasting quinoa recipes I have ever made. I used only 1 can of black beans and fresh corn as some others suggested and added a couple of squirts of fresh lime juice.     One thing I might also add is that if you are not familiar with cooking quinoa, you need to fluff with a fork after cooking so it separates.

A great, easy recipe. I used leftover Quinoa that was already cooked and can't wait to make it the way the recipe says to get even more flavor. I omitted the cilantro and used one can of black beans. This a great meal, snack or side dish. Will definitely keep this one.

My apologies to 3Lioncubs, I followed the recipe and did not like this dish. I love quinoa and have tried/experimented with many different flavors. However, my sister and I both found it to be  bland and very beany tasting. I feel like there is a key ingredient/spice missing that could make this Quinoa dish pop, but I will not be trying to figure it out.

Very tasty and simple to make. I used chicken broth, added some red bell pepper, and went light on the cilantro. I also only used one can of beans. And I wouldn't say this is anywhere near "10 servings" if you're using it as your main dish. The backburn you get from the cayenne is really what made this dish. Great served with fresh, cooled avacado slices!

First time cooking quinoa, and I'm so glad I found this recipe!  I'm going to add avocado and eat this for lunch.  I think next time I'll try it in a burrito.  Yum!

Great!  My neighbor recommended this recipe.  I left out the cayenne because of my kids. I also used about 1 1/2 cans of black beans rather than two. We made burritos with it - served in tortillas with shredded cheese, chopped avacado, sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes. It was incredibley good and all three kids ate it!

I don't like onions, garlic, cumin or cayenne pepper, but with over 1,100 positive reviews, I had to give this recipe a try - and boy am I glad I did! It was amazing! Only at the end did I realize I had bought kidney beans rather than black beans... it didn't matter - it was delicious!

This is my first time cooking with Quinoa.  I was very pleased with the flavour and texture of this dish.  My husband likes to have some meat with every supper so I added some cut up grilled chicken breast and grilled a half yellow bell pepper on the BBQ.  The results were great.  He had seconds and is taking the rest  to work for lunch tomorrow.

Awesome recipe!!  I didn't change a thing, only thing I needed to do was add a little more veggie broth after about 15 minutes of cooking the quinoa and onion mixture because it dried out, I added the rest of the can (another 1/2 cup) and it all eventually cooked away also.  I LOVE this recipe and this is my third time making it, makes a great summer dish!

This is wonderful!  It was my first time using Quinoa and it was so easy.  I wanted something different to do with the cilantro from my herb garden and found this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and the end results were perfect and really yummy!

So yummy!!  I didn't have cumin or paprika so I just used 2 Tablespoons of Mrs Dash all~purpose seasoning and left out the cilantro and corn.   I only had one can of black beans and one can of black-eyed peas so thats what I used.  So yummy!!!

My boyfriend and I love this dish! We too only used 1 can of black beans, he was surprised that the recipe had called for 2. Other than that small change, this recipe is one of our household favorites now!

Very easy - very delicious received raves at a Memorial Day BBQ where I served this as a room temperature side.  Used chicken broth as I did not have any vegetable broth handy and was out of cilantro, but still very flavorful.

Delightful! One of the best recipes I've found online. So simple and delicious, and easy to mix and make. I brewed this up with some Red Quinoa, then put it in the fridge overnight and mixed today with a green salad with tomatoes, then topped with a bit of Siracha chili (I like it spicy), peanuts, and chia seeds, and it was unbelievable!  Modification: I added a glug of olive oil when cooking the onions and garlic because I'm so used to using way more than a teaspoon of oil in sauces.

LOVED IT! I have little kids so I skipped the onions and cayenne, but added a little mild taco sauce and tomatoes. I didn't have anu cilantro but added some fresh lemon juice and served it with quacamole and taco chips. This is VERY good! Definately will make this again. Kids loved it!

This is my first time reviewing a recipe.  This recipe is so good that I felt it was worth the time to write the review.  Its easy, healthy and has become a weekly main dish in my home.  I took the advice of the other reviews and added veggies and sometimes even tomato sauce.  It's good as a side dish or by itself.

This was a great recipe !! I liked it even when it was reheated, and had a great flavor. Really good with sour cream and my husband put nutmeg instead of cumin (mistake) still good but next time I'll try fixing it the original way !

This was fast, simple and SO TASTY! This will definitely become a staple recipe for quinoa, and something that is easily build-able. You could change the veggies up, or change the beans. SO awesome! thank you for the great recipe!!

This is a delicious recipe! We have made it with both chicken broth and vegetable broth. We added more hot sauce and cayenne than it called for, since we love spicy food. You'll make this again and again for sure.

I actually thought this was very good, but no one else in my family cared for it. 5/10/10:  I upgraded my rating to 4 stars.  I took this to work for lunch everyday for a week and it is delicious.  So what if my husband and children don't like it.  I think it is excellent and will make it for myself again.  It keeps and reheats very well. 4/1/12:  I've upgraded to 5 stars.  I don't care that my family won't eat it.  It's delicious and healthy.  A perfect dish in my mind!!

Oh so good and easy to make.  This is a keeper for me.  The only different thing I did was squeeze a little lime juice right before serving.  Thank you so much for a great way to enjoy quinoa!

This was fantastic and it makes a HUGE batch!  My bf has decided he is not a fan of cumin, so next time I'll have to try another flavouring, but all in all, this is a keeper.  Should be good with add-ins like tomato, zucchini, etc.  And only use 1 can of beans, perfect ratio!

I love this dish.  I discovered quinoa while shopping in a whole foods market, and was curious to try it.  I prepared this recipe as written ... no changes are needed in my opinion.    I have eaten this as a main course and have also served it as a side dish.  It has a lot of flavor.  It's great when you find a dish that is healthy and tastes really good.

This was GREAT!!  I had to sub chicken broth as many others did.  I think one key is to follow the instructions of your box of quinoa for cooking time.  My quinoa cooked in 8-10 minutes, so had I cooked for 20, it would have been a mushy mess!  I topped mine with some Mexican chicken (breast boiled with bay leaves, oregano, garlic, onion), chopped tomatoes, avocado, and sour cream!  YUMMY!!!  Would definitely be great in a tortilla, too!

I omitted the cayenne & added 1 diced red bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper, 2 small tomatoes & lime juice.  This recipe is A-MAZING!  And very forgiving--I'm looking forward to playing around with it more as I think it'll be a regular dish in our gluten-free vegan house!

Delish!! I make this a lot and have started squeezing the juice of 1/2 of a lime over the mixture just before serving.  Sharpens all the flavors nicely.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Add the juice from 1 can of tomatoes and then chicken broth to make 1 1/2 c.  Add 1/2-1 c of chopped chicken.  If you don't have cayenne pepper, add red pepper flakes.

This was my first time making quinoa and we loved it!  Easy, delicious and healthy complete meal - what else do you need?  Used 1 full cup quinoa, 1 can of veg broth, 2 cans of beans, 1 cup of corn, 1/4 cup of cilantro.  Next time I'll use a bit more corn and a bit more cumin, cayenne pepper and cilantro.  Wonderful dish!

Awesome awesome awesome. this was so easy and delicious. When cooking the quinoa i would suggest leaving them on a little longer and adding a little more broth, mine didn't open all the way in the 20 minutes. great recipe though and so simple. will definitely make this again

This  didn't quite turn out as well for me as it did for other reviewers.  I found it bland and may up the spices next time.  I think I undercooked the quinoa because it was a bit mushy for me. I also found 1 can of beans to be plenty.

This was pretty  good! I saoked the quinoa for about 30 minutes in the vege stock before I put it in the pot. Only took about 10 minutes simmer time. I used marinated blackbeans instead of canned. Only need a very small amount otherwise the flavour swamps everything.

I couldn't believe how good this was!! I didn't have black beans, so I used red kidney beans and it was wonderful. My picky 6 year old and even my one year old like it. THis was our first taste of quinoa.

This is excellent!  I can't believe how good it is.  We had it as a side dish but could be a main dish.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and chopped up fresh tomato instead of corn.  I will make this again and again!

WOW! Quinoa, where have you been all my life?!  Very tasty and satisfying.  Being nutritious is quite a bonus!  I used just one can of black beans and substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth. It was perfect. Thank-you!

Tastes great! My husband loved it. I would say only add 1 can of black beans, but otherwise the recipe is great.

I didn't change the recipe at all. I like the color and the textures. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I thought it was a little bland and had to add more seasoning at the end.

I was really surprised by how much I liked this. This was my first time trying quinoa, and it was easy to make and tasty. If anything I would say it was a little bland so I might add more spice the next time I make it.

I thought it was ok, much better as leftovers.  I didn't care for the cilantro, I will cut back on it next time and chop it very small.

This is a great recipe - hot or cold.  I used the two cans of beans called for, added orange and red bell peppers for color and flavor, and definitely needed more cumin to suit my tastes.  I will continue using this recipe!

Much better than expected! Added fresh chopped tomato and sauteed some red peppers. Didn't have any fresh cilantro so I just skipped it.

My husband, who is a total non lover of natural healthy food, LOVES THIS. I also put half the amount of black beans, and added just a bit of tomato to wet it up... dismissed the corn, and the plus that I do and that my 6 year old love is adding sliced avocado on top when served... YUM!!

Very good recipe.  However, I only used 1 19oz can of beans and I used canned corn instead of frozen.  I also added some Red Pepper and Mushrooms to the mix.  I rinsed the canned beans first too to remove some of the sodium used for preserving them.

I served this at a dinner party this weekend, having never made it before, and it was a real favorite.  It's easy and tasty, as well as being healthy.  I can't wait to make it for my college-age vegetarian daughter when she comes home!  I made it exactly as is, but I like the substitutions of peas for corn, or the addition of tomato.  Will try the adaptations on future efforts.

Was really good!  Didn't have to cook for 20 minutes like it said...  took maybe about 10.  Served it with salsa on top.  Can't imagine it would make 10 servings though... would have to be really small servings.  Will defiantly make this one again though!

This was my first introduction to quinoa and still my favorite quinoa recipe.  I have made it several times.  It presents great for bringing it to gatherings.  No changes to the recipe were needed.

Our first try at Quinoa and we loved it, especially with some avocado chunks on top.  I only used on can of beans and a can of corn and chicken broth.  Also went a little light on the cayenne for the kids.  I will definitely make again and I will likely add some diced tomatoes.  Husband LOVED it.

A nice mix of flavor. I used a small can of corn instead of the frozen. I cut the amount of black beans to 1 can and added 16 oz of fresh chopped mushrooms. Overall my family and I enjoyed it. I felt that the quinoa was a bit more cooked than I would like. I cooked it on a timer, I probably should have taste tested it for doneness instead. Will definately cook this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous recipe!  So yummy warm, and then the leftovers are good right from the fridge.  I added about 2 tbsp of fresh lime juice to mine and it made it even better!  Thanks for the great recipe.

YUMMY!  I never write reviews, but this dish is so amazing.  Simple, healthy, tastes great, and so economical.  I use extra sweet corn, and a great Wolfgang Puck vegetable broth.  Plus I go heavy on the cilantro.  YUM! I eat this cold,  on a bed of lettuce with salsa, cheese, and sour cream...or hot with chips and salsa.

MMMMMMMMMM...i'm trying to incorporate more grains into my family's food and this is the second time i've tried quinoa.  the first was the turkey quinoa meatloaf from this site and it was alright.  but THIS...this is awesome!  little spicy for my kids but i can adjust for that.  i made just as specified except i added some chopped grape tomatoes and some crumbled cotija cheese.  this is going into the rotation.  will be great wrapped up in tortillas too!

Yum Yum Yum.  Quinoa has quickly become my favorite grain (and possibly food), being a vegetarian it is high in protein and keeps your full and energized all day. This recipe is by far the best I have made.  It is so flavorful and satisfying.  I also only used one can of beans and added a red bell pepper for color.  Soooo yummy.

Made this last night, and it was excellent! I followed recipe exactly...Will definitely make this again, though next time I made add something more, maybe some chopped peppers. I did however eat with fresh avocado slices, and was amazing!

Not bad!  This was my first exerience with Quinoa.  The family liked it.  I cooked my own black beans, then rinsed before I added them.  I doubled the recipe, and served it with salsa and sour cream. I thought this was a great meatless dish.

Simple and I love it - so does my 3 year old! I've made it a few times and haven't used fresh garlic yet (keep forgetting to buy) and I don't use vegetable broth (can't have MSG and haven't found a vegetable broth I love), so I use water then sprinkle on Braggs Liquid Amino's to taste. Very yummy - as a vegetarian, this is a wonderful recipe.

awesome! brilliant flavors that mesh very well. I doubled the corn just for sweetness, added a zucchini and a portobello mushroom cause I needed to use them up and put a touch more cayenne pepper and cumin seed. Will definitely make it again! Thanks!

I have to say, this is a very interesting dish. I JUST made it, and I am having a bowl right now. I've never had quinoa, and I think it's a nice change. There is SO much flavor in this dish.

I doubled the recipe so that there would be enough full servings for 6 people.  I didn't double the black beans though.  I added a diced red pepper, a can of diced tomatoes and some lime juice at the end.  I think that next time I will add a bit more spice as it was a little bland.  When eaten warm it definitely feels like a hearty meal and it is very filling.

We had never tried quinoa until tonight. It was so good! My husband raved over this. We rinsed the quinoa. And at the end we added a can of petite diced tomatoes and half a squeezed lime. We ate it with fried corn tortillas and cheese. We also dipped corn tortilla chips in it. It would be fantastic layered over chips, with cheese and avocado. We will definitely be making this again!

I really enjoyed this dish - I used navy beans because that's all I had and I left out the cayenne because the kids don't like things spicy.  It was a little bland without the cayenne and one of my sons made a stink about eating it anyway so I should have just left it in!  I ended up eating it with some salsa, guacamole and sour cream and it was delicious!  My husband enjoyed it and he usually isn't into vegetarian meals!

This was the first time I have tried quinoa. I tasted it before adding the beans and corn, and actually thought it may have tasted better than after adding them. I only added 1 can of beans, and still thought there were too many. Overall, I still really like this dish, but I will definitely add less beans next time (or maybe leave them out altogether).

Just made this for Saturday afternoon lunch. It is so good; especially with a little sour cream on top!! I think cilantro and stock can make anything taste good. I had tried quinoa before and didn't like it but I think the flavors in thise dish changed my mind. I took the suggestions of others and cut back on the black beans. Will make this again soon!!

Love this recipe!  The first time I made it for a potluck and have been asked for the recipe by many people.  This was the first time many of them had tried quinoa.  Since then, have made many times.  Tastes good warm or cold.  My 2 year old inhales this dish!

This was an excellent dish! I brought it to a potluck and everyone loved it. You can add any vegetables and it will taste great. I added red bell pepper - chopped. Also doubled the amount of cumin and cayenne pepper for extra kick, and only used one can of black beans, which was plenty. This is a keeper!

My first time making quinoa and it was absolutely delicious!!! However, I substituted chicken stock for vegetable broth and tripled the amount listed in the recipe. By tripling the broth, my quinoa was much more tender, and the chicken stock gave it a wonderful flavor, although I'm sure vegetable broth would be just as tasty! Five stars for quinoa AND for this delicious recipe!

Whoops! I accidentally added a teaspoon of curry because I wasn't paying attention. I still added the cumin though, what could it hurt, right? This was delicious! I diced and added half a red pepper for some color, and served it in fresh tortillas.

This was the first time I ever cooked quinoa. I like how simple and tasty this recipe is. I also chopped up some red pepper as others had suggested and cooked it with the garlic and onions.  With the seasonings I added some chilli powder and extra cumin and cayenne. I used canned kernel corn and added it at the end, along with some green onion. I only used one can of black beans too. I didn't add any cilantro though. I love it but others don't like it at all, so I didn't try it. It was enjoyed by all.  I especially like the subtle nutty flavour of the quinoa. I am going to be cooking with it a lot more now. Thanks for the recipe :)

amazing, so flavorful!  I think the key was to let the onions brown so that they take on that sweet and salty flavor.  I also added green onions and grape tomatoes at the end.

There are too many beans in this salad, and not enough corn. Doesn't taste that great, so I wouldn't make this again.

I wanted to try this but had trouble finding quinoa. I finally found it in the bulk food section at Winco. I followed the recipe to the letter. This made an excellent side dish to grilled chicken. I used chicken broth rather than the vegetable broth. I only used one can of black beans. Great alternative to rice. Thank for sharing.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  I throw in a pablano pepper (for a little extra heat), a chopped red pepper, and some grape tomatoes at the end.  I serve with a bit of cheddar cheese, sour cream, and avacado.  This is so easy to make - you just can't mess it up.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was great. I cut back on the cumin just a little, didn't use beans because we didn't have any, but it was still great. Used half the cayenne called for so it wouldn't over take the dish and used a small 1/2 t. of salt and 1/4 t. pepper. Wouldn't change a thing. It was great!

Easy and a nice side dish. I have just started using Quinoa and my husband didn't think he liked it until this recipe. I had to add a bit more vegetable broth than the recipe called for as it seemed a bit dry when I added the corn.

This was the first time I ever had quinoa.  I followed the recipe exactly hoping it would taste good.  The dish tasted as weird as it looked.  Not a big fan.  :(

First time I ever ate Quioa.  After trying this I want more.  Verry good.  I made it with chicken stock as well.  I also added chicken for my husband.  The spices were perfect.  Yummy!

This is a great, easily adaptable recipe. I threw in 1/2 green bell pepper and 1/2 can diced tomatoes that I had on hand needing to be used. We ate it as a "one pot meal" for dinner and everyone was satisfied. Even my 2 yr old liked it.

This was SO good! I omitted the cayenne and swapped out the broth for plain water to cut down on salt and it still had great flavor.

I like to try new recipes and love the information I get from other reviewers.  This looked so good, and didn't have quinoa; but I did have bulgur cracked wheat, which another reviewer used, so I used that instead.  It was great!  Very tasty and satisfying with a side salad.  As I was eating it, I thought perhaps some salsa and avocado would be great with it, too!  I will make it again.

Was excited when I found a new recipe using quinoa.  This is sooo good.  Next time will add more spices as I would like it hotter.  This recipe is a big time winner.

Excellent recipe for quinoa!!  My (gluten intollerant) nephew loves it and so does my husband (who thinks that he doesn't like quinoa).  Easy, flavorful, and healthy!

Wow!  A healthy southwestern style dish.  I used only 1 can of black beans and I rinsed them with water before added them.  I love cilantro so I doubled the amount required.  Will definitely make again!

Fabulous.  Delicious and easy and healthy.  The color is a little bland in appearance, but a little salsa on the side really helped.  Love it!!  Will definitely make again and often.

I doubted this recipe at first- but it was pretty tasty!  Filling and pretty healthy.  I made some changes (Like I halved the recipe and added brussel sprouts, yellow pepper and mushrooms, and didn't add cilantro) and let the beans and corn simmer for a bit longer than it asked, but the result was pretty good!

My first time making quinoa, and I was quite impressed.  I didn't read all of the review first, and if I had I might have cut it down to just 1 can of beans or would have increased the quinoa, liquid and spices a little.  It just looks a little disproportionate with all those beans.  I did not have any cilantro and I really missed that.  It also would be good with some halved grape tomatoes like other reviewers did. Will try that next time!

Great recipe! I added a few things to give it a Southwestern twist. I added a can of tomato soup and spicy diced tomatoes with jalapeños in it. It turns it into a little more of a chili soup for cold winter days.

I added cooked chicken to it, wasn't very happy with the end result.  Could have been the veggie broth I used, it was homemade and not very strong.  It was my first time using quinoa and was bad timing as my puppy had just gotten over a case of roundworms and I couldn't look at it without thinking about worms.  :(

This is my favorite quinoa recipe.  I use frozen roasted corn kernels and 1 can black beans.  The 2nd can of beans probably makes for a heartier meal, but my family isn't that keen on black beans to begin with so I don't push my luck.    We love this vegetarian, but as an alternative, you can add precooked sliced chicken apple sausages or smoked sausage at the end for a heartier 1 dish meal.

Excellent dish.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  We served it in tortillas.  I am looking forward to eating it cold for lunch tomorrow.  We didn't have quinoa, so I used orzo and adjusted the simmer time down to 8 minutes.

This is excellent. I havd been using quinoa with steel oats for a while but this is now my new fav. I didn't have corn so I replaced it with sauted mushrooms and it was just great. I will make this often.

I've made this a handful of times, and it's turned out great each time. I think it's good both hot and cold, but my young kids ONLY like it cold. I only use 1 can of black beans, as many have suggested. Otherwise, I keep it exactly the same!

This is the first time making quinoa and I had my reservations how this would taste. But it is great!! Packed full of flavor. I did not soak the quinoa and I don't think it needed to be soaked. Very good, thank you!

I seriously love this recipe.  The first time I made it, though, I burned the quinoa (not good).  But subsequent trials have been successful.  The cumin with the fresh cilantro is awesome.

LOVED LOVED LOVED this! First time having quinoa and what a wonderful introduction! All of my kids loved it and my youngest who's 5 had 4ths he loved it so much! I did make two substitutions from the original recipe and that was chicken broth as that's what I had on hand. I don't think it would honestly change the flavor all that much either way. And I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. This is a keeper and a new regular to our meal rotation!

Delicious! Added pine nuts half way through my 2nd bowl of it and it took it to a new level. First time I've had quinoa and it won't be the last! The onion seemed like a lot, but it wasn't. I added some ground flax seed.

If you have never made Quinoa & are a little hesitant to try it....try this recipe! I have never made Quinoa (or even tasted it) prior to making this recipe. I have been seeing Quinoa in a lot more recipes lately so I decided to give it a go. I added a 1/2t more cumin as recommended. I also diced up a tomato & added it right before serving. It added a nice pop of color. This recipe is delicious cold or warm. It also makes A LOT so you will be lucky enough to have leftovers. I added shredded chicken to it the following day & turned it into a burrito filling for lunch the next day & it was a great hearty addition! I can't wait to make more! This recipe definitely earns the 5 stars.

Fantastic recipe. It was even a hit with my picky eater in the family! I used only one can of beans and chicken broth since I had that on hand. I served it with baked tortilla chips and grated cheese.

This was amazing! Instead of frozen corn, I cut the kernels off of three cobs of fresh corn. The added crunch it gave the dish was out of this world. A keeper.

This is one of the best recipes I have tried in a long time!! It is great hot or cold and is fantastic as a leftover! The only change that I made was to use a can of corn instead of the frozen. Awesome!! Thanks for the submission.

Our family likes this served with some cooked chicken on tortillas.  It somewhat reminds us of Chipotle's burritos.

This was also my first time trying quinoa. I made it for a vegetarian pot luck and everyone loved it. Not a fancy dish, but definitely full of flavor and easy to pair with other vegetables and sides. Yum!

Tasty, healthy dish.  I cut the black beans in half for my girls sake.  My husband felt the two cans would have been fine for him.  Have made again and again.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times now and have taken it to work and enjoyed the conversation with coworkers about the little known grain quinoa. I've eaten it as is off the fork, as well as wrapped in a tortilla or served on crackers.

Excellent & nutritious recipe! In addition to the great stuff already it in, I DOUBLED the cayenne pepper, increased Cumin to 1 1/2 tsp, increased Quinoa to 1 cup, and added some fresh diced tomatoes & diced zucchini for extra veggies. Not only good for lunch or dinner, but as a nice warm breakfast helping too! Mmmm good!

yum!  Very light, healthy and delicious.  My only qualm is that I would be unable to eat this as a main dish because it doesn't make me feel 100% satisfied...I like a bit of fat in my meals hahaha.   But its great! WIll add to the regular daily menu!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I followed it to spec... but it could have used more heat. Next time, I will add a little more cayenne pepper. Also, I served this with a salsa/sour cream sauce on the side in case it was too hot. This was a good combo! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I loved this, however, I did not find it very economical.  The only quinoa available at our grocery store was $4.67 for a 14 oz. bag.  This was great with the Key West Chicken on this site and sliced oranges.

My mom made this recipe, but didn't include the cilantro, and only one can of black beans.  It was absolutely, to-die-for, delicious.  One caveat: my mom initially didn't like it at all. I think she though the cumin was too much.  But, after one day in the refrigerator - which is when she served it to us - we all went bananas over it.  Super good!

Very tasty! Would serve to company. I prefer to use dry beans rather than canned, and I didn't have quite enough black beans on hand, so had to supplement with some pinto beans. I just soaked them all day, then rinsed and cooked when I got home. Also I added a little celery (during the sauté phase) and zucchini that I needed to use up. Seems like a recipe that could be made ahead and served as a side salad the next day -- will try that tomorrow, maybe alongside a veggie taco!

Quick, easy and delicious. I too reduced the beans to 1 can. Quinoa is so light and then when you add to it, it really takes on the flavor.

First time trying Quinoa and who knew there were so many varieties.  I liked this dish, it's different, looks pretty and tastes good, just looks kinda weird.  I did reduce the beans to 1 can and add a can of tomatoes with chilies.  Nice and spicy as written.  Makes a nice lunch.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  We liked it better cold.  Could use a little more spices.  Will try it again.

Delicious.  Used only 1/8 tsp cayenne so not too spicy for kids, but still had good flavor that we enjoyed.  Kids liked it OK.  Will share this recipe and make it again.

My husband and I loved it.  Made minor modifications used different oil and added more spices and added raw corn.  I love how the cayenne pepper gives it a kick.

Incredibly versatile recipe.  I make this recipe all the time.  The original recipe is fantastic!!  Because I I add diced tomato or salsa to add extra flavor.  I also like to add chili powder. I also like to make it at least the night befoore so the flavors have time to elvolve.  Just a fantastic recipe!

Very yummy. I realized I was out of corn so I had to modify the recipe slightly.  I threw a chopped carrot in with the onion and used chicken broth.  We had leftovers and mixed in with chicken soup which was very good as well.  This recipe will definately stay at the top of the pile.

We thought this was just excellent.  I did add a can of Rotel tomatoes with chiles (this will kick the heat up a bit more), and we squeezed lime juice on it before eating.  A very healthy, tasty dish, economical, and it's going in the regular rotation.  Just a note if you're unfamiliar with quinoa - be sure to RINSE THE QUINOA WITH WATER before putting it in the pot. Quinoa has a natural substance on it that acts as a repellant to birds and such, and it has a bitter taste to it. While it won't hurt you, it will adversely affect the flavor of the dish.  Rinsing with water before you cook it removes this substance. While some brands may be pre-rinsed, others, like the brand we can get, are not.

This was so great! I followed the recipe, except i doubled it. I still only used one can of black beans, and i also used chicken broth because that's what i had. I made this today to have for lunch the rest of the week...and it makes PLENTY!!! I will make this again and again! Next time i'll follow other's reviews and add a red pepper or something. Very Very good!

Excellent recipe! I only used one can of black beans because that's all I had and I skipped the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand. This is such an each side dish or meal! I ate some hot and plan to try it cold tomorrow. Yum!

I had to omit the onion (mine was rotten when I cut into it) and it still turned out great! This was the second time I made quinoa, I wasn't impressed with the first recipe and I'm glad I gave this one a try! I used a cup of canned corn instead of frozen and only one can of beans (which I rinsed). I think the two cans of beans would have been too much. Thanks for the recipe!

I recovered it and it came out well.  It needs twice as much liquid as suggested. I cooked it carefully, and added water as needed--about two more cups. I used one can of black beans in order to appreciate the quinoa and cilantro more fully. Found plenty of quinoa locally at Whole Foods, in bulk, at $3.76/lb.  My Mexican friend, especially, was surprised and pleased with it and gave it a full two thumbs up!!  I repeated it a second evening. Will offer it frequently.

Awesome!!  First time I tried quinoa and I luv it.  Stuck to the recipe the first time and 2nd time did a little variation by adding yellow and red peppers, and red onion.  Great both ways.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I usually experiment with different vegetables in Quinoa.  This one is great.  Love the taste and very quick to make.  My son loved it.  I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of corn and added some zucchini and diced tomatoes.  And only used a dash of cayenne.  Very tasty!  Great to use as a main dish with a side salad.

Wow, I was really surprised with how good this was.  I didn't have any fresh parsley or vegetable broth, so I used water and addded a bunch more spices including savory, time, celery seed, etc and a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce.  I also added some chopped bell pepper in with the onions.  I might add a bit more cayenne next time.  I put a little sour cream on top - yum!  Easy, cheap, healthy, vegetarian, and very filling.

This was my very first time with quinoa.  I thought it turned out very good.  A little too spicy for the kids so next time I'll put in less cayenne.

Delicious. Made as is except for over-spicing w/ cayenne (you try to eyeball it and bam -- too much) and adding a handful of halved orange cherry tomatoes. My first rodeo with quinoa -- great stuff. Sweet, nutty flavor still shines through. Heavy rotation from here on out.

I used this as stuffing for some spicy red peppers, topped w/ pepper-jack cheese.  I used barley instead of quinoa (yum) and added 2 cans of drained Rotel tomatoes (yum) and only used one can of the beans.  Enjoyed by all.

This is my 1st time eating Quinoa - I liked this recipe, but I liked it more about 3 hrs after it'd been cooked - the flavors really came out then. I used g.pepper and snow peas instead of corn and used only 1 can of black beans - Its a good recipe when you are looking for a change.

This was very good. My kids did not enjoy it, but my husband and I devoured it. I used only 1 can of beans, used chicken broth, omitted the onion and cilantro (didn't have any) and added some lemon juice and oregano. Very versatile dish.

My first cooking experience with quinoa and we loved it! This is an easy, delicious recipe - I substituted chicken broth and used olive oil for browning the onions and garlic. Also, squirted in some fresh lime juice at the completion and topped with fresh tomatoes - yums!

i added a can of costco chicken breast - only becasue my hubby refuses to eat a totally vegetarian meal!! i would have prefered it without the chicken. the flavors were excellent. i served it with a plop of sour cream and shredded cheddar. it made so much that i ate it for lunch the rest of the week!!

Great, easy quinoa dish. I have never had quinoa before, and this is a great and simple introduction. I did not have cayenne pepper, but it turned out delicious nonetheless. It should probably be renamed to black beans and quinoa with the amount of black beans in the finished product. Still, wonderful and it makes a large amount, which is key for me to store and bring to work throughout the week.

I liked this recipe but it had a funny taste; I used vegetable broth but had to add some water and tomato paste to calm down the pungent taste.  Overall, it tastes good and refrigerates well.  Also, 2 cans black beans would have been too much so I stuck to 1.

Very tasty. I added a red bell pepper and subbed chicken stock for the veggie stock, and served with sour cream and avocado. This made up our entire meal, so for us it made 4 meal-sized servings, not 10 side dish-sized servings. Will definitely make again, but might up the spices a bit - good blend of flavors, just not enough. I got quinoa in the bulk section of our local supermarket for $3.99/lb, and I needed less than 1/2 a pound, so it was very economical for us. Also, I only soaked the quinoa for about 3 minutes (just while I was getting the chicken stock ready), and it was perfectly cooked according to the recipe's directions - if I'd soaked it for an hour I would have had slop for dinner!

This was really good. Like others, I used only one can of black beans - two would have been way too much in my opinon. Should mention, I think it needs salted at the end, but otherwise very good! Thanks for the recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this dish was.  When I make again I am going to try adding a chopped tomato, serrano pepper and fajita chicken.  This is a great base recipe and will be fun to play around but is definitely good as is!

Needs more color if its going to be a main dish, has decent taste just needs some more color (tomatoes, peppers, etc.)Used hot sauce to give it a little extra flavor once it was in the bowl.

Quite a good recipe, although I would prefer a bit more spice and perhaps a little squeeze of lime.  I also added some finely chopped orange bell pepper I happened to have in the refrigerator. I think it could stand up to maybe a half of a seeded jalapeno for kick.

I didn't have the veggie broth, so I just used water.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used just 1 can of black beans, and I threw in a can of garlic, basil diced tomatoes.  Yummy, yum, yum! I definitely will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted one can of cannelli beans for one can of black beans as I didn't have two cans of black beans. I found this recipe to be exceptionally bland. Maybe I'll use it again, but if I do, it will only be as the base for something else.

This was my first time cooking with quinoa and it won't be the last. This is a great and easy recipe. I added mushrooms and diced tomatoes to mine but otherwise followed exactly. The fresh cilantro was a great addition. This one is saved to my recipe box for sure!!

I usually do my quinoa with a tomato/garbanzo bean mixture, but this was dang good.  And, as usual with quinoa, it's better cold a day or two later.  I only did one can of black beans.  I also did a cup of quinoa, 2 cups chicken broth and added half a chopped green bell pepper to the onions.  At the end I mixed in some lime juice too - only about a tablespoon.   Next time I make this I think I'll add a tomato and a little more lime juice.   I think it will be perfect then.

This is great.  I had nothing to make for lunch and received the email with the link to quinoa recipes. I remembered I had some quinoa and made this using chicken stock, frozen sweet peas (no corn) I added red pepper, used the cilantro as suggested by another reviewer, instead of black beans I used aduki beans I had just gotten for the first time.  They're even healthier than black beans.  It made for a very yummy lunch and leftovers!  You can't go wrong with quinoa you can mix it with just about anything. Make it a side dish or whole meal.

This was a great base recipe.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I did change/add to the recipe a bit.  I had never made quinoa before, but have been wanting to try it for a while.  I did not rinse or soak the quinoa, as a previous review suggested, but I did add it to the sauteed onions and garlic.  I also added carrots to the onions and garlic (for color and nutrients).  In addition, I added fresh peas when I added the broth and spices.  I also used paprika instead of cayenne as I was feeding my 1 year old (who absolutely loved this.)  I also added some edamame at the end to bump up the protein.  I left out the cilantro because I didn't have any, but think it would have been a great addition.  This was a great meal, and probably would have been awesome as written.

This recipe was a good one.  I didn't have frozen or canned corn so I didn't get to add that in. Next time I make it, I will be sure to have corn on hand.  I think I may add some chopped bell peppers next time too.  Great dish.

Simple, delicious, and healthy...this is a great recipe that is now a favored addition in my recipe box!  I made it tonight as a side dish with grilled chicken kabobs, and it was amazing.  I did as other's suggested and used one can of black beans.  I added fresh corn from the cob too, which give it a nice fresh sweetness.  My husband loved it.  This was my first time making quinoa.  Thank you!

Delicious!  Will double the recipes next time.  I did add some pepper and only used 1 can of black beans - 2 would have been too much.

I like quinoa and black beans, but I really dint care for them mixed. My boyfriend who will eat anything didn't really care for it either. If I make it again I might add less quinoa.

This is great!  It was the first time I used Quinoa, and it turned out well. It is very easy to make. I added  a can chiles and used it as the base for a vegetarian taco salad.  Everyone loved it!  I'll definitely use it again.

Fabulous! Fabulous recipe! I used pre-rinsed quinoa I found at the store and did modify the portions of beans, corn, etc. to my liking. It is really easy and foolproof! Love love love it!

The mixture of flavors works extremely well, and I think it actually tasted better overnight, after the spices had time to cure a bit more. A very healthy and fulfilling vegetarian dish! I already have some ideas for the next time I make it, like using half black beans and half pinto or black-eyed peas, or throwing in some squash or tomato in the last five minutes of cooking.

This is so delicious and easy! I'm afraid of "spicy" so I skipped the cayenne. I prepared it with rinse-free quinoa, rinsed a can of black beans and a can or corn and threw it in at the end. I served it up with some salsa. I can see this being a versatile dish. I'm a new gluten-free vegan, a lazy cook, and a picky eater, so finding good recipes has been tedious. This will be a new staple in my diet. Thank you for sharing it!

I like black beans and quinoa so this was a fun recipe to try.  I think I will spice it up a bit also and maybe add some tomatoes and black olives.  I also only used 1 can of beans, it seemed to be enough.

This was great for a picnic and was eaten up very quickly! Lots of people asked for the recipe. I added fresh chopped tomatoes at the end and used about 1/4 c. cilantro rather than 1/2 c.  I will definitely make this again.

This dish is excellent. I only had 3/4 cup of quinoa in the house and used 1 can of black beans.  I seriously couldn't stop eating it. Then once my DH got hold of it, it was gone. I need to get some black beans, I am dying to make it again, so good.

This was really good!  It was my first attempt at quinoa, and I used it as lunch.  Very tasty - and I was craving more after I was done.  I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  (I followed the recipe exactly as written.)

This is so good!  I used chicken broth instead of veggie (all I had) but all the other ingredients were common to my pantry.  I loved it!  Makes so much that there will be plenty to take to work for leftovers.

This is an amazing recipe!  Definitely a keeper.  The scent of it cooking woke my room mate up this morning.  I'm not a cilantro fan, so I put in only a 1/4 cup of cilantro... and it was still a little too much for my tastes.  Next time I might not add any, but it does add some color to the dish!

I LOVE this recipe, as does everyone I have made it for, I totally give it 5 stars...However, one word of warning: It has to be eaten quickly. It does not seem to keep for any more then 2 days. One time I made it on a Thursday, took it in to work Friday to share, accidentally left what was not eaten in the fridge at work, walked in Monday morn, the entire HUGE office smelled like a dead body was there, opened the fridge and almost passed out. Made it again this weekend, Friday morning to be exact, and Sunday at noon it was very smelly and made my entire kitchen stink, in sealed bowl in the fridge. Great salad, but must eat the day it's made only, in my opinion. BTW, I have not made much w/ Quinoa, is this a Quinoa thing, is it known not to keep for long?

If you are concerned about substituting ingredients, make sure to read this review! I didn't have any quinoa, so I used brown rice (cooked it for 30 min first before adding to onion mixture). Also, didn't have corn so I ended up using a trio of peppers-also because I wanted a kick. Ended up being delicious.

I served this with a tangy broccoli slaw on the side.  Added green pepper and used one can of beans, which was plenty. My first experience with quinoa and am now a fan.  Great recipe!

Incredibly delicious. I was determined to eat quinoa because of its health benefits. I tried it cooked plain and hated it. This recipe did the trick. I even eat a small bowl for breakfast and it's warm and filling. I used fiesta corn because it was all I had. I used only 1 can of black beans.

Fantastic!  I made this in a smaller size, for four.  Based on other reviews, I added in 1 chopped tomato, 2 tbsp green chiles and 1/2tsp smoked paprika.  I didn't have cilantro so I substituted oregano.  The one thing I'd mention, which might be because I made a smaller serving, is the quinoa is sticky when wet so it's hard to mix in the seasonings after - next time I'll add them to the broth beforehand.  This dish is amazing!!!

Definitely a great recipe for quinoa.  I did only use 1 can of beans, and I also thought it was spicy enough as written. The cilantro is a must.

This was delicious!  Would have given it 5 stars but let's just say it tasted better than it looked.  Three notes - the quinoa should be rinsed first to remove any powder.  Also, when it was ready I topped with crumbled feta cheese which added a great flavor.  I also used just one can of beans - two would have been too much.  I plan to use the leftovers to make wraps with grilled chicken.

Made this tonight, it's wonderful! I used chicken broth because that's all I had, and next time I might add some diced chicken, but it doesn't need it at all. I LOVE the little bursts of sweet when biting into the corn kernels. Mmmm.  Can't wait for the left-overs!

Great taste, but agree with others who thought there were too many beans.  Will make again using only 1 can of beans.

This is the second time I've made this recipe and my family loves it. Nice change from potato and rice side dishes. Only used one can of black beans this time and didn't have vegetable broth so used chicken broth instead. Still turned out great!!! Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe.  Just starting using quinoa and was thrilled to find this.  I only used one can of beans and agree with other reviewers that two would have been too much.  I also added red pepper.

Very Yummy! I had left over quinoa that was already cooked so I just cooked the garlic, threw in the spices, black beans, corn, and cilantro and heated it up. It was done in no time and tastes great. I will try adding fresh chopped tomatoes next time.

This was pretty good; my first time cooking quinoa and it went very well.  The quinoa itself I've just become a big fan of, but the recipe could use some work.  The beans lend a pastiness that could be cut with some more fresh veg like a chopped bell pepper or something.  The corn just wasn't enough.  I also didn't use as many beans as was called for as it looked like too much.  I'm glad I held back a little, too.  Definitely has lots of expansive possibilities.

I invited some friends over for dinner, 3 officially certified meat-eaters and one vegan. I found this recipe and decided it sounded perfect.  It was received very well by both the vegan and the omnivores. It was hearty, tasty and easy to make. For four people as a main course, it wasn't quite enough though. I will double the recipe next time. Try it, you'll like it!

I made this exactly as directed.  It smelled fantastic as it was cooking, but the beans ruined it.  Next time I'll add half the beans and maybe take other's suggestions of adding other veggies instead.

This is fantastic! My husband and I loved it. I added in some largely chopped red bell pepper just after the frozen corn, as well as some browned slivered almonds. Served it with wheat tortilla, and bought roasted chicken. Fantastic! I'm even planning on making it for my inlaws!

Even my picky 2 year old ate every last bit on her plate!  We will be making this part of our weekly menu.  I did cut the recipe in half as 10 servings would have been too much for our small family, but it made an excellent side dish.

this was delicious! it tasted like a more veggie-heavy and nuttier (and healthier!) black beans & rice. a few things i did differently: 1) i added more cayenne pepper 2) i added a chopped green bell pepper 3)i also added a can of diced tomatoes. it came out wonderfully and definitely hearty enough for a main dish! we ate with some grated cheese, avacado and sour cream on the side. i recommend you try it; it can't be beat! :)

I enjoyed the quinoa and black beans.  It was a lot lighter than I expected, more of a salad than a main dish.  I will be making it again, but probably not as a main dish.

Followed recipe exact except for adding only one can of beans instead of two.  We ate it in whole wheat tortillas like a burrito and we both really enjoyed it, except that it seemed a bit dry.  Next time I will serve it with sour cream and probably some salsa.  Very good though!

OH MY GOSH, this is sooooooo good! I've never made Quinoa before, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but this recipe is fabulous! I didn't change anything about the recipe, except for use one can of black beans and one can of white kidney beans, because I didn't have two cans of black beans. But regardless, this has excellent flavor and the combination of textures is perfect! Thanks for submitting this!

Wow! this dish is absolutely delicious. I didn'd have all of the ingridients on hand so I used rice instead of quinoa, i also used mixed vegis instead of corn, and i also used green onions instead of parsley. Overall, I thought that this dish is really good.

This is a great dish. We added diced cherry tomatoes to it which complimented the cilantro nicely.  Didn't have any cayenne so we substituted Tapitio hot sauce.  It was awesome!

I went with the group and only added only one can of beans. I tossed in a little salsa for color and a little extra flavor too. I really liked the result. It was sweet because of the corn, but had a nice bite to it because of the spices and fresh cilantro.(I am a fan of cilantro) My boyfriend wasn't as thrilled about it.

Definitely a keeper. Discovered at the last minute I was out of cayenne so substituted about a teaspoon of hot sauce. Also, only added one can of beans, and used a can of corn instead of frozen because that's what I had in the house. Delicious!

DE-LISH! Cilantro gives it a very fresh, summery taste. Doubled the cayenne and it was spicy and tasty! This is a GREAT staple meal that will help you lose weight; something you can nosh on all day at your desk.

This was the first time I've made quinoa and it was GREAT!  My husband loved it too.  However, I did add some lime juice, which I felt enhanced the flavor even more (still 5 stars without it though).  This is really good hot or cold.

amazing recipe! very easy to make. i would recommend adding the cumin and cayenne at the onion and garlic stage. it's nicer to have the heat work the spices with the onion and garlic. i also added a cup of extra-firm tofu for additional protein.  fantastic!

Meh. Its not bad, but I don't feel like it rates the 4.5 stars that it is averaging. I prepared it as written and it was somewhat bland to me. Missing something. Maybe some lime juice? It is a good base recipe to build off of.

this recipe was good.. definitely use fresh corn if you can, it adds good flavor. i used red quinoa, and it was just fine. i do think it could use more cayenne than was called for.

Great recipe! I added about 1/2 a can of tomato/chile mix and it turned out wonderful. My husband (who wont even eat brown rice) asked for seconds! Also makes a perfect stuffing for mushroom caps!

Our first time using quinoa.  It was good, but needed something more, like some lime juice for acidity.  It was filling, we used it as a main dish.  I would make this again as a side dish.

This didn't work for me. It may have been the combination of flavors or the quinoa, I thought the quinoa was odd. I did rinse my quinoa too. Quinoa was hard to find. I finally found it at Whole Foods for around $3. The prerinsed was around $5. I think this recipe might be better with brown rice. I would halve the recipe, it makes ALOT.

Thank you for the recipe. It is great the way it is written. It is also great with or without onion and garlic. Add the things you like leave out the things you don't like. Now quinoa is one of my favorite things to make on a regular basis.

I think this recipe is tops!  I made it almost as is, I replaced the 1 cup of corn with diced yellow and red bell peppers and increased the cayanne pepper to 1/2 tsp and added an extra 1/2 tsp of cumin. Also, like many of the other reviewers I only used 1 can of black beans and I'm glad I did.  The consistancy is just right.   At this point I am kinda obsessed with this recipe.  It is a satisfying and tasty, HEALTHY meal that doesn't *taste* healthy.  So far I've only had it wrapped in a tortilla with hot sauce but I plan on making enchilada's with it next week.  PS~ If you're using canned broth, don't be tempted to use the whole can or your dish will be kinda soupy.  Only use the 1 1/2 cups called for.  Thank you SO much for the recipe!

Tastes great prepared almost as is (we only added half of the cilantro, just because my husband doesn't like it).  It was a big hit!  Very easy to prepare, and our first time experimenting w/ quinoa.  Will make again and again!

REALLY good.  This was my first time using quinoa and since I bought it in bulk, I soaked and rinsed it.  I did not use it until the next day and found that it had sprouted.  It was still good but probably less crunchy.  I used more corn and fewer black beans than the recipe called for but otherwise followed it exactly.  Great as is or wrapped in a tortilla.

This was very good. Excellent use of Quinoa, great source of high-quality, healthy proteins. Very healthy and satisfying. I used two differnet types of beans because my quinoa was the red variety - so I used white beans to stand out and make it more colorful.

I loved this recipe!  The flavor was great and Runner's World always has quinoa as a must eat food.  I added red pepper with the onions and garlic.  It needed another veggie.  I had it cold the next day and it was delicious.  We ate it in tortillas and with multi-grain chips -- great!

My 4 year-old complained before dinner that he didn't want to eat this (and I wasn't sure that he would even touch it), but after the first bite, he told us that he really liked it; AND, he even wanted seconds before he finished the other food on his plate.

Excellent. Very flavorful and filling. It's good both hot and cold so it works great as a dinner side dish or salad. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wonderful mix of flavors and textures.  Recently found the benefits of quinoa and have been eating it plain.  I just knew there was a more festive way to enjoy it and this fills the bill.  Add to that the benefits of the black bean and I think I found a regular staple in my diet.

this is a great, easy meal, that we frequently have all the ingredients on hand to make... although sometimes we skip the cilantro.  also, i like to make it with i can of beans.  enjoy!

My whole family LOVES this recipe (even my 3 year old!).  I make it a one-pot dinner dish by adding some low-fat turkey kielbasa.

This was my first time trying Quinoa and I am so happy that I used this recipe; it was simply delicious. I did have to make some changes based on what I had on hand. I only used 1 can of black beans (19 oz can), and as others have noted, I do think 30 ounces would have been too much; substituted the veggie broth for low-fat/low sodium chicken broth; and used 1/4 tsp chili powder instead of the cayenne. I also did not add cilantro because I don't really care for it. Last, I ended up adding some leftover chicken, which I needed to use up. I will definitely be making this again. It is a nice and hearty protein-packed dish, yet it does not feel heavy. I went back for seconds, and am trying to resist thirds. This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent vegetarian dish!  A favorite on those "craving comfort food" nights!  I generally make the recipe as written except only use 1 can of black beans when cooking for the two of us.  Gives us two hearty portions plus leftovers for lunch the next day.

This recipe is sooo easy to make and sooo delicious!!!  The second time I made it I did make a few adjustments to give it a little bit more pop.  

I about doubled the cayenne pepper
I sauteed red/yellow/orange bell peppers with the onions.  
I did about 2/3 of the beans.

But as a base recipe this was delicious, and I will make plenty of variations of it in the future.  I imagine you could add meat to it and make it the main dish....mmmm!!

What a great recipe! There are so many flavors and textures - it's become a family favorite. Like some others, sometimes I add one or one and a half cans of black beans instead of two (for personal preference). This dish also goes great with soy sauce!

I really thought this was a great recipe, esp. b/c it was easy to make.  It made a super side-dish and we had it in taco shells with sour cream the next day.  Awesome and will definitely pass on the recipe link to my friends!

This recipe was great!
I had to make a lot of modifications due to the fact that I didn't have all the ingredients.
I used kidney beans, chili pepper, chicken stock and added zucchini and red pepper.
Loved it!

My dad and husband loved this dish and my dad hates anything "foreign."  I found it too spicy for my liking, but I am a wimp.  I left out the cayenne and the spice was still just too much for me.

I used 2 cups of chicken stock, a full cup of quinoa and added a bell pepper.  Also increased the spices by 50%.  I used canned corn and just threw the whole thing in.  Should have held back - it was a little overwhelming.  Overall healthy and tasty.  Looking forward to trying it cold tomorrow for lunch!

This was the first time I ever cooked with quinoa. This recipe is fab. Very delicious. I've made it twice now and it satisfies every time! I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used hot sauce (2 tbls) and I really like the combo of kick and subtle sweet the hot sauce gave it. Loved it!

Bingo!  Just what I was looking for.  The husband and 4 kiddos LOVED it.  I added diced avocado and a dollop of sour cream as suggested by some other reviewers.  Otherwise everything else was the same.  I could see adding some orange or red veggie for color, but I wouldn't want to mess with the flavor.  Yum, yum, yum!

This recipe is something truly different!  It's good as a side dish or main course, it's very healthy, it has  a clean, refreshing taste, and it's good hot or cold (I ate it both ways).  I made the recipe exactly as described, and it worked perfectly.

This recipe is a great starter but the two cans of beans is overkill unless you add more to it. I added pico de gallo and some fat-free plain yogurt which ended up tasting amazing.

Really great tasting.  Like others, I only added one can of black beans and I didn't use frozen corn since I didnt have any at hand, but instead used a whole can of white corn. I also sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on it at the very end. I didn't add any other veggies, but it would definitely be great with zucchinni/squash, carrots, etc.

I have never cooked quinoa before and this was the perfect recipe to start with!  Very quick, very easy, VERY satisfying and delicious!!  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I would also follow others suggestions and add some red peppers or zucchini for added color - but great nonetheless.  I also used several dashes of the green Tabasco sauce.  

Thought I'd have plenty for leftovers for lunch... son loved it and finished it off.

I made this with inca red quinoa and added a squeeze of lime!  It was absolutely delicious!  I definitely call this one "a keeper"!

This was the first time my husband and I ever tried Quinoa, and we loved this recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and soaked the Quinoa for an hour before cooking it to eliminate the bitterness. I only had one can of black beans but it was perfect. I think 2 cans would have been too much. Instead of cayenne pepper, I used coriander (didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand). It was delicious. We will definitely be eating this often! Thanks for this great recipe.

I love this recipe! I doubled the recipe. I also chopped half of a green pepper and sauted it with the onions. Next time I will use red bell pepper for a better color contrast. After I prepared everything I thought it needed a little more flavor and spice. I added about 1 tsp extra cumin, 1 tsp corriander and 1 tsp crushed red pepper. I took it to a pot luck and work and everybody loved it! Thanks!

This was delicious!  Like others, I added tomatos and a red pepper.  I also used only one can of black beans.  

I put this on top of a fresh tostada with some gucamole and it was a huge hit!

Light tasting but filling, flavorful and easy to make.I'd never thought of adding cilantro to my black beans but it was a really great combination.The next time I make this dish  I will add more quinoa. I was a little unhappy with the quinoa to beans ratio

My friends and I LOVED this dish.  I took others' advise and added a chopped red pepper and sliced zucchini (sauteed in separate pan and added once quinoa was cooked because I didn't want it to get soggy) and a fresh tomato.  I served with tortillas and had sour cream, sliced avacado and grilled chicken (for the meat eaters) on the side.  We all ate way too much.

I love this recipe! I like using red quinoa; it gives it a great variety of colors for presentation. I've shared this dish with several groups of friends and family and they all love it. It tastes great stuffed in a warm whole grain pita!

Not horrible, but definitely not amazing. I added green peppers and a few more seasonings because it just tasted rather..well, tasteless. Not sure why it has such a good rating.

This dish was okay, but not something I would make again.  We ended up eating it with some sour cream mixed in...which husband really liked.  I think I would have liked it better with tomatoes.  Thanks

Oh my, this was way better than I thought it would be. I picked this recipe because of its high rating and it looked pretty easy to make, and it was! My only thing was I added half a red bell pepper along with the beans and cilantro which I thought made it rock. My family and I love this recipe and highly recommend it to everyone!

Can't wait to try this! I used Quinoa for the first time in a Stuffed Zucchini Recipe. I loved the taste and I'm looking for other recipes to use it in. It took me a couple of weeks to find it,since the local markets don't know what it is. I had to go to Trader Joes!

This is our new standard dish.  We can't use corn, but we add diced tomatoes with the black beans.  I have also made it without onions, and I think I like it even better!  Great as leftovers the next day!

I only did 1 can of beans and that was plenty.  I also added one large tomato (diced).  We made burritos and added the quinoa dish to whole wheat tortillas with a little sour cream, tobasco, and shredded cheddar.  Delish!  Serve with cornbread on the side.

Love this recipe and have shared it with many people.  Like others, I usually add more color with red or orange peppers or a can of green chiles.  And the cayenne, oddly enough, is undetectable unless more is added.  But my biggest change is to use only 1/2 can black beans.  I really like the quinoa to shine in this dish, and with the suggested 2 whole cans of black beans,IMHO the quinoa is overwhelmed.

Delicious, easy, and very healthy!  I added a chopped green pepper and doubled the cayenne pepper.  I disagree with some of the other reviewers who said to use only 1 can of beans--I think it definitely needs two.

I've never had quinoa before and I loved this.  I added some mexican blend cheese on top and this complemented the beans nicely. I'll probably try adding a sweet pepper in with the onions and garlic next time to balance the flavors and change it up.  This is heart-healthy, vegetarian, economical, and easy to make.  A real winner.

this simple recipe is awesome!  it made a filling dinner and many tasty lunches.  i usually only dutifully eat leftovers as not to waste food, but this was so tasty that i looked forward to them!
i just made a few small changes based on the suggestions of other reviewers and personal preference: i only used 1/2 an onion (i'm not too big on onion), replaced one of the cans of black beans with diced tomatoes, and topped the tasty concoction with a squeeze of fresh lime juice and some chopped avocado. YUM!!!

This recipe is great.  I substituted a tablespoon of medium curry powder in the water instead of the vegitable stock to reduce the sodium.  It was really good.  I think next time I will also sub red pepper for the corn to make this a super healthy meal.

This recipe is SOOOO good!  I recently have gone pescatarian (vegetarian still eating seafood) and have been having a hard time finding some really good recipes for quinoa.  On occasion to mix it up a little I wait to add cilantro and grape tomatoes until it has cooled and I even add some lime juice.  You can also substitute other beans or even chickpeas.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is a new favorite recipe for my family, with a few changes.  I use only one can of black beans. Add one small jalapeno pepper, finely chopped and sauted with the onion and garlic.  During the last 10 minutes of cooking, I add a red and green pepper, and fresh corn rather than frozen.

I don't like cilantro, so I cut it out; instead I  added some chopped red bell pepper (just after the onions start to turn translucent) for color. I also serve it with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Every time I bring it as a "covered dish," I get compliments and recipe requests.

I started making this recipe before I realized that I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used one can of black beans and one can of pinto.  I also used ground ginger instead of cumin.  I didn't have any stock on hand, so I used water instead.  In spite of all those modifications, it tasted great and was very filling.  My husband, who is quite picky, said I could add it to our rotation of meals.  Next time I'll try it according to the recipe.

Obviously, I liked this as I prepared this recipe for the second time.  I adjusted the liquid to a 1:2 ratio and soaked the quinoa for ten minutes - as per the advise of many reviewers.  This time I added drained tomatoes and red, green and yellow peppers.  Even better!

Really great meal! This was my first experience cooking with quinoa and it certainly left a great impression. I loved every bit of this recipe and everything came out perfectly. I didn't have any corn or canned black beans. I cooked my own beans and added some chopped up heirloom tomatoes and red peppers and it turned out great!

Delicious!  It's also good without the beans, if you don't have any (I've done it both ways).  It's just a little spicier.

Great Burrito filler - we rolled this mixture up in wheat tortillas and ate with salsa and sour cream - I'd also suggest quacamole but we didn't have any avacados on hand.

This was a great recipe.  Easy, cheap, nutritious!   Would definitely make this again.  My husband loved it too.  I made half a batch for a main course and we had about 1/5 of the recipe leftover.

A friend told me about Quinoa which made me want to try it.  This recipe is not difficult to prepare and is very good.  It was served with a spicy chicken dish which seemed to compliment the flavors.

Mmmmmmm!  I had no idea what quinoa was  or where I was going to get it and was just going to substitute in brown rice instead.  However, lucky for me I have a friend in LA who shipped me some to make for my birthday party.  Everyone was a little frightened, but it was quite fabulous and everyone ended up loving it.  I added some diced tomatoes in with the cilantro and topped with diced avacado to serve.

Great dish. It's filling and yummy. I found that I had to add more corn to offset the beans since it seemed like they were overpowering the dish. Like other people have mentioned, there are a lot of beans--so maybe 1 can would be enough. I like black beans so I would still make it with 2 cans next time but just double up on the corn.

This was so delicious!!!  My meat and potato husband even suggested we have this again and use it as taco filling!  I ate the left overs on a bed of spring greens with a fresh lemon vinaigrette-  it was even tastier!

I made this without the cumin and it was completely flavorless. With the cumin, the dish is much better -- zippy with flavor -- but the first taste is still bland.

I love this recipe. I used it the first time I made quinoa and my husband and I loved it. I also made it to take to a dinner party with friends and it was a big hit. I added diced red pepper both times and used only one can of beans as well and it was wonderful!

This is absolutely delicious.  My whole family loved it.  I substituted chicken stock for vegetable stock and black soy beans for black beans because it's what I had on hand.  And I doubled the recipe.  It made a lot, which is great because everyone had seconds!

I made this for work for a group of 25.  I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes and the juice of 3 limes.  I also toasted the quinoa before using.  At work we get a blend of frozen corn and black beans that has onions, green and red peppers and Cuban spices in it, so we used that plus 2 cans of black beans.  It was delicious and I had 8 people ask me for the recipe.

This was my first time trying quinoa, as well. I did not rinse it or soak it and it turned out fine. I did not have veg.broth, so used chicken instead. I also used mixed frozen vegies. I tried kidney beans and pinto beans, in place of the black beans, and agree with other reviewers that it is a little bean-y with 2 cans, and will try just one next time.  I liked the suggestion of the tomatoes.

This was very good!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I only used one can of black beans.  And I used chicken broth since that's what I had.  I didn't have frozen corn, so I used a can of the Summer Crisp corn - it added just the right sweet note to the dish.  My husband even had seconds, and said how much he liked it.  It was our first experience with quinoa, and I'm so glad it was good!

I substituted brown rice for quinoa because the local supermarket isn't progressive enough to carry it.  The flavors in the recipe were good and I will try again with the called for quinoa and re-rate at that point.

I wasn't exceptionally crazy about this recipe. I don't like corn, so I didn't put it in. I actually didn't really put all the exact measurements of spices in, I just kind of eyeballed it. Its very good for you, so its worth it to give this recipe a try.

Absolutely delicious. I like to make this to have for lunches during the week.  It's fast, easy and good for you.  I do only add one can of the black beans.  That's plenty.

I caramelized the onions and followed the recipe as written.  This is a home run!!  The sweet browned onions and the corn balance nicely with the cayenne pepper. I will make this again and again!!

I rated this 5 stars because it's the only quinoa recipe I've found that I enjoyed.  Everyone else really liked it, and I'm sure it's very healthy.

This is by far my favorite recipe I have found on here. Like the others, I only used about 1 can of beans and it was plenty. I have made it several times now, and it's always a hit. I also added more cumin after the first time as I like it spicier. Also delicious with some cooked broccoli thrown in, by the way.

I love this recipe.  My meat eater boyfriend does as well.  It is good as-is, but I do add a couple of things.  I love red bell peppers, so I add 1/2 to one whole one diced to the onion step, and I make sure to add extra cumin and  cayanne pepper as well, since I like lots of flavor.   This is good with either 1 or 2 cans of beans, whatever you prefer.

Really really good.  I used chicken broth instead of veggie and added a can of tomatoes.  I'd made the "Authentic Mexican Tortillas" recipe earlier and we ate taco-style with avocados, cabbage, and fresh lime.  Great meal!

I've recently discovered quinoa & black beans (beans make great brownies) so happy to find recipe combining the 2.  Only used one can of beans as others suggested. Added a little lemon juice, didn't use cilantra, but the flavors and the spice amounts were just perfect.  I'll be making again, and sometimes altering to add zucchini and maybe tomatoes, too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a big hit in my house. I only added 1 can of the black beans, substitutes Italian parsley for the cilantro and added a bit more cayenne.

I've never cooked quinoa before and I have a question: Is it supposed to turn out translucent?  Just curious.  Anyway, I have been trying to find a whole grain that my husband likes, and I think this is it!  I used chicken broth, and followed the advise of other reviewers and added some zucchini with the onions and a can of Rotel. One can of black beans seemed sufficient.  We liked this very much.  Thanks, Hilary!

This was my first experience with quinoa and it certainly won't be my last.  This is an excellent recipe that is also easy to add to (as I love to do!).  I used one can of beans, the Rotel tomatoes and julienne zucchini as per others' suggestions...delish!  I also used chicken broth instead of veggie, which worked perfectly since I served it with broiled chicken.  The key was definitely the Rotel tomatoes...added just enough kick and a really nice flavor.  I also cooked the quinoa with some Sofrito and Recaito in the broth (I'm a BIG Goya fan).  All in all, a HUGE success. My husband adored it!

I enjoyed my first experience with quinoa.  I used this as a taco filling AND the next day I stir fried it with breaded tofu leftovers and spinach.  Good stuff! I will say it took longer than recipe stated for the quinoa to cook.

My first time cooking quinoa and it was great!  I somehow forgot to get the black beans so I used some cannellini beans instead.  Still very yummy! I would definitely like to try adding some zucchini and tomatoes in as well.

Delicious and nutritious. I added a can of Rotel tomatoes for some extra spice. My teenaged boys both enjoyed this with some shredded cheese. An easy and inexpensive recipe.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I had some roasted chopped pablano pepper that I through in.  I only used one can of black beans, because that is all I had.
I served it with salmon that I topped with a balsalmic vinegar, evoo. salt pepper, more of the pablano and cilantro.  My family really liked all of it:)

This was delicious! Having read some reviews, I used only have the black beans, which seemed perfect. I also used about 1.5 tsp of the Taco Seasoning I mixture (recipe on this website) instead of cumin and cayenne pepper. Thanks for the great recipe!

I am just learning to cook with quinoa and I thought that this recipe really looked good.  I used one can of beans and one can of drained corn.  I thought it was a little bland.  For my meat dish I was making "my kids favorite pork chops" (a recipe I got from this site)and so I took some of the juice (BBQ sauce and beer) from that pan and added to the quinoa.  I thought it was pretty tasty and hubby didn't think it was that bad.  He said it needed some rice in it for texture so I might try it again.  None of the stores by me sell quinoa so I called Bob's Red Mill company and ordered it (you don't have to rinse theirs).  I think this is a good base recipe that can be tweeked to your particuliar taste.

Maybe it's just my own personal taste, but this didn't really work for me.  I just didn't like the combination of flavors.  Seemed off to me.  It got a little better after sitting in the fridge for the day, but I won't be making it again.

Everyone in my family hates cilantro, but they gobbled this up. It was my first time to use quinoa and it was really good. Will try soaking it for an hour first next time. I may add a pinch more cayenne next time for a little more kick but was good as is. I fixed as the main  dish but would've been better as a side dish especially for my husband who was still hungry afterward.

I thought this tasted great. I found the finished product a little wet. I thought it would be like rice, but this was definitely more wet. Maybe I just need to cook it longer.

Quinoa is such a great alternative to rice or pasta.

This dish was pretty good, however I think I may have misjudged on the cumin and added a little too much, as it had a strange aftertaste, which pepper helped to mask. I'll make this again, and be more careful about that. We had it as a meal, but both agreed it would be better as a side to something. I used a can of corn instead of frozen, and also only used one can of beans, but I think it would be good with one or two, depending on your liking of beans.

Soooo easy to make. Tasted great even without the onion and cayenne. Even my picky toddler ate some. Used the leftovers for lunch in a taco.

Used chicken broth instead of veg., extra cumin & cilantro, added chili powder & fresh diced anaheim chili. Topped with lowfat cheese, fat free sour cream, avocado, & diced tomatoes. Kids loved it too!

I didn't have quinoa so I substituted wheat berries.  Also added chopped red pepper, one can beans and extra spices.  Very good and salad held up well in refrigerator for several days.  As we ate it cold also.

Like another reviewer, I also used Trader Joe's fire-roasted frozen corn.  I also followed previous reviews and used only one can of black beans, and I'm glad I did.  I liked this dish but I'm not giving it 5 stars because I feel like the flavor was lacking something.  Next time I might add some diced red pepper and top it with some cheese.  This is a great recipe, though.

This was excellent, and very easy! I used fresh cooked black beans instead of canned ones, and had to substitute a short grain rice (Calrose) for the Quinoa because I unfortunately couldn't find it at our local grocery store. But it worked very well! This was so good! I also used a frozen corn that had been fire-roasted (from Trader Joe's), and that added a nice smokey flavor as well. Thanks for the great dish!

Delicious! I changed it a lot, but still a great starting point. I halved the recipe but used 1/2 cup quinoa and 1 cup chicken broth. I didn't have garlic or cayenne so I used about 1/2 t Emeril's Essence and a dash of red pepper flakes. I steamed 3 diced carrots and added at the end with the corn. I also added cut up vegetarian chicken nuggets and mixed them in my portion for more protein. Amazing, well-rounded meal!

This was easy, very little chopping which is nice. 
My one complaint, the cayenne! I felt it just really overpowered all the other flavors, even the fresh cilantro taste was missing because of the pepper.
Next time I would omit the cayenne or add just a VERY small sprinkle.

This is absolutely FABULOUS. My brother, 17 years old, even found it tasty...and he generally eats nothing but pizza. I eliminated the corn and used a yellow pepper instead due to a corn allergy. I also used half the beans required, and that was perfect. This is also a great dish for those allergic to wheat/ gluten.

I am new to cooking with quinoa, but I'm sure I will prepare this again and again... : ) Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this the other night and added 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes and I about died it was so good. No, really. This is the most fantastic dish I've made in a long time. I left out the cilantro and added the tomatoes while simmering the quinoa, but otherwise kept everything the same. Absolutely phenomenal.

It was pretty good,
I think it could use more in it.  I put in some fresh tomato after and I think next time I'll add in some bell peppers as well.  My toddler thought it was wonderful though.  I will make this again, just with my own twist on it.  I like more flavor.  I ate it in a wrap.  I think next time I'll have some fresh avocado to go with it also.

Wow, first time cooking with quinoa. This was amazing and healthy. I used 1 can of beans, I could see using another if you are needed more filling, but if not great with 1 can.

Really great taste and cooking method of cooking the grain in broth instead of water -- I'll remember this method for other quinoa recipes. The texture was a bit gummy, though, moreso than other quinoa recipes I've cooked. The taste was wonderful, though! A keeper!

I used a quinoa-rice-millet mix and added some chopped tomatoes. Also doubled the spices (I am a spice wimp, and it was fine).  Nice side dish and can be a conversation dish at parties because most people have never had quinoa before

Very easy recipe - it turned out great, although I think I would kick it up a notch as far as the seasonings go.  I added a touch of salsa and next time, will add tomatoes for flavor and color.  Very healthy dish with little fat and lots of fiber.

This is great! Even my husband, whose tastes are less adventurous than mine, enjoyed this. It was my first time making quinoa, and he asked me to find more recipes that use it. I halved this recipe for the two of us and still had some leftover. Very colorful, flavorful, with just the right amount of "zing" from the cayenne.

We enjoy this recipe.  It does seem to be missing something.  Quinoa is so good so you can't go wrong with this one.  Great recipe for making alterations to your taste.

Absolutely delicious! Definitely a keeper. Since we're not vegetarians, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I served this with chicken smoked sausage.

This may be my new favorite food! I added half a jalapeno, chopped fine and sauteed that and the quinoa a couple of minutes before adding the veggie broth. I used canned corn instead of frozen. I think I would add some chopped red pepper and tomato if I were serving this as a main dish.

I just made this and it's delicious!  I added chopped red pepper just before the quinoa and used canned corn (drained) instead of the frozen.  It turned out great.  Next time, I think I might add some chili powder.  Very good!

This was my first attempt at making quinoa & it turned out pretty well.  I added red pepper and fresh jalapeno after it was done cooking.  Really nice flavor.  Next time I'll add fresh diced tomatoes as well.

I've made this 3 times and it's always great. I also add in a chopped red pepper after the garlic/onion phase, and a few tablespoons of a tomatillo salsa during the quinoa phase. The one can of beans is totally enough. As a main course this recipe serves four people, not 10.

First time I try quinoa and I am delighted! This recipe is delicious and fool proof. Following the advice of other reviewers, I only used one can of black beans - it turned out great. A new staple in my house. Thank you!

This was an excellent recipe!  I added a can of organic diced tomatoes and also used one can of black beans instead of two.  And I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Terrific and satisfying dish I'll be sure to make again!  Thanks!

Good - I doubled the cumin, but it still could have used a bit more.  Added a tomato & green pepper, and served with shredded cheese and sriracha.  Only used one can of black beans.

This is a delicious dish.  I would make it a touch spicier next time.  Leftovers were used the next night as the base for vegetarian tacos.  These were even more delicious.  This will defiantly become a regular meal in our house.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great and I loved the mix of quinoa and black beans.  The only thing I would change is to increase the seasoning for something was missing in the flavor.

This was amamzing. Took the advice of others and used 1 can of beans..perfect. 
Also, served with a side of Pico de gallo and light sour cream and let everyone add to thier taste. Id say the pico de gallo is a must. Also only used 1/4 cup cilantro as I didnt want to over power the other flavors. Perfect. :)

EXCELLENT! My first taste of quinoa won't be my last. I followed the suggestion of others and used only one can of black beans.  I also subbed parsley for cilantro and omitted cayenne. This recipe can be varied in a number of ways but was a big hit with the entire family. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

OMG - I don't understand how something so simple can taste so good!  The only thing is this is only 10 servings if used as a side dish.  I used it as a vegetarian main and will undoubtedly finish it on my own in no more than 3 days.

Good.  Thanks for the tip to add a can of tomatoes and halve the black beans.

Very good.  First time I tried quinoa and I'll definitely make this again....I usually don't like corn mixed with food but this was actually really tasty.

This is the first time we've tried quinoa. This recipe was mildly flavoured and tasted good. We ate it with cheese and salsa.

We didn't like the texture of the quinoa, though: it was similar to cream of wheat. Next time, I'll use part rice and part quinoa (for the health benefits).

Well.. I had a bit of trouble with this recipe as I used a sauce pan as specified and my vegetable stock absorbed too quickly in the recipe. The quinoa was a bit chewy as a result.  The flavour was good but instead of cayenne I used chilli powder and added some curry.

Tastes really good and is very easy to make.  This is the second dish I've made with quinoa.  The first one was a disaster I think because of wrong directions.  I didn't cook it completely maybe.  But this one was perfect, easy and so healthy too!  Even my 4 year old liked it.

I cooked it with 1 can of black beans like others suggested and that ratio was perfect for me.

Great recipe.  Very easy and tasty.  Much better than the standard Black Beans and Rice.  This will go on my rotation of recipes.  Thanks, Hilary!!

Very good recipe. I used red quinoa. It tastes the same, but it adds a nice bit of color.

This was a very tasty recipe! I have to admit I did not follow the amounts specified exactly (I sort of "guess-timated.") but it was very delicious!

This was quite good.  I'm a big fan of black beans so I'm always looking for new ways to eat them.  My only complaint is that the cilantro was a bit overpowering.  I think I'll use less next time I make it.  I will definitely keep this one around though, good stuff :)

I had never heard of Quinoa till this week. I did a search on the Web for a recipe to use it and found this recipe. I can't believe it - it is FANTASTIC and I can't wait to make it again. I added a chopped carrot with the onion and garlic and used chicken broth. Otherwise I made it exactly as written and won't be doing any more substitutions. I can't wait to try it as an omelet filling as someone suggested.

This was my first time cooking quinoa, and I will say that I scorched it a little bit.  The dish is very pretty and tasty, although 2 cans of beans is too much I think.  Also, I think you might need additional broth because it dried off too quickly and burned.  I'll keep trying, though.

Very Good.  Next time I will use at least 1 cup of quinoa. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

I use quinoa often and found this to be a delicious and versatile addition to my recipe book.  The proportions of quinoa/corn/beans are perfect.  I made this in August and used 1 ear of fresh corn, also had some finely chopped celery and green pepper around, so tossed those in, and used parsley instead of cilantro.  I also browned the quinoa before adding the liquid.  It made a great main dish, good for wraps and scoops, and will try using wine for some of the liquid next time.
