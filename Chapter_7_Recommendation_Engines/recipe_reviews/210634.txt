Delicious! But please do NOT confuse CURRY LEAVES with curry POWDER - they are NOT interchangeable!  The leaves give a unique & great aroma & flavor to Indian dishes. You will have to seriously search Indian grocery stores (ask about ordering it) & possibly online stores. When you do find it, freeze the fresh green leaves in a plastic bag to have it around for 1+ years. To clarify: curry powder is a mixture of several spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander powder, etc. The curry leaf is a green aromatic leaf.

Delicious! I substituted ground curry powder for the fresh curry leaves, and some hot fresh chili pepper for the dried chilies. Added seitan near the end for some protein and served it with sauteed greens and mexican sour gherkins.

This is as close to what I found in India as I have ever found here in the States.

It's good, but not amazing. I'll probably make it again.

Very good. I added onions and multicolored carrots for variation. Only recommendation is to add another flavor combo to balance to spiciness.
