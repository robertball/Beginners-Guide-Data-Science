I really love roasted Brussel Sprouts and this sautéed version with Bacon and Balsamic is Delicious. I threw in about 2 T of dried Cranberries at the same time I added the Vinegar and let them rehydrate with heat turned off and lid on the pan for a few moments before serving.

I never write reviews because I really don’t want to waste the time. My 12 year old daughter was just diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and she is extremely picky when it comes to anything food! So the fact that I got her to not just eat these but to even have seconds is just short of amazing!!! We are a family of five and everyone ate them and equally loved them. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written because I am no chef. Thank you for this delicious recipe!!!

I also love this. I used turkey bacon as an alternative because I don't eat pork. I also put about 1 tablespoon of honey in with the vinegar to cut the sharpness of it. I also put all the vinegar in at once so it could reduce a bit. Delicious with the changes!

I used a cast iron skillet, started heating it up on low, then increased to "6".  Must have been mistake as I have a very unattractive dish of black brussels spouts. dried cranberries and bacon.

Great recipe!!!  Did it for Thanksgiving.  We used lots of bacon bits, instead of bacon.  Used a wonderful balsamic glaze I picked up in a spice store.  Will definitely do again.

WAY too much balsamic, and I love balsamic.  The rest was good but it would be awesome to know what is the recommended stove top cooking temp.  I typically roast mine but didn’t want the oven to heat up the house.  That was a  shoot.  They were seriously undercooked at 15 minutes at 7.5 on an electric range.

I’ve never enjoyed Brussel Spouts until I made this recipe.  I make these at least once a month.  They are fabulous cold the next day.

Following another’s suggestion, added some honey to the balsamic to tone it down a bit. Also limited balsamic to 1/2 cup and added it a bit early to reduce it a little.  Delightful served over rice, and Cabernet Sauvignon makes a fine pairing!

I cooked the brussel sprouts and balsamic vinegar for about 5 minutes so the vinegar would reduce.

I’m a wee bit lazy and added chicken breast to the pan.  I also didn’t want to reduce the vinegar so I drizzled balsamic vinegar over it before putting oven and voila- it reduced itself.  Quick and easy enough for a weeknight meal and will definitely make again.

I have a couple regrets in cooking this recipe and one addition to the recipe. I added two rings of a white onion, chopped finely, and added it to the bacon. In hindsight, I wish I had added more liquid, with a bit of olive oil, to create more moisture. Or covered my dish with foil. I chose to use the oven method when it may have been better to use the stove top method instead.

I loved the brussels sprouts made this way. My husband liked them, but would prefer without balsamic next time. Didn't have bacon, but had prosciutto. Used half the amount of balsamic called for and felt it was perfect! Great and simple way to give the brussels more flavor. The balsamic gives them just a hint of sweet, not a strong vinegar taste. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
