Do not be afraid by the liquid ratio! I was seriously scared but after cooking most of the liquid was absorbed. Definitely flip the cake over onto a plate over a sink...it will catch any dribbles that may be there. Served it for dessert and then warmed it for breakfast the next day. I hear NO complaints either time! Similar to monkey bread but less cinnamon more caramel...which is fine by me!

I'm not a fig fan of sweet stuff, but this is amazing. My daughter is mad because we didn't leave her any, oops. But, I've got plenty of reasons to make this again.
