This time I added the spinach. Still delicious and just a light shade of green. 7-16-2016 I made this per the recipe but without the optional spinach only because I didn't have it. I'm sure it would be delicious with it since spinach is usually undetectable in a smoothie. The protein powder makes this a filling breakfast.

I made this without the protein since I didn’t have it and added 1 tablespoon of peanut butter. I also did 2 tablespoons of stevia and 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk, half of an unfrozen banana and added a few ice cubes. It was delicious! Will try with protein next time. I didn’t have any protein handy.

Didn't like the flavor at all!! It wasn't very sweet, which some may like, but I like my coffee sweet! It also had a very strong coffee flavor which I didn't like either. I don't know if it was the coffee I used or what.

This is a great smoothie.  I didn't add the stevia, It was sweet enough without it!!!
