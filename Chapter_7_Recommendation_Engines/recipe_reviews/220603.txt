Easy recipe and easy to tweak! Since I didn't have lime, I used lemon (lime is best but I didn't have it on hand unfortunately) - I omitted the cayenne (kids) and added garlic powder. While the chicken was marinating I started cutting up my veggies, I didn't have a red onion but yellow did just fine. Once the chicken was cooked , I tasted... it needed some salt and a little more chilli powder, cumin and garlic. AH yes that did the trick! :D IF you don't like the dryness of chicken breasts you can mix it up and cut up both chicken breasts and boneless skinless chicken thighs. YUM! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

WOW,really tasty,simple recipe. This was recipe group selection this week and I'm sure glad I made it.Since it is just hubby and me this worked out perfect.The one thing I did different was to do a combo,so I added a small sirloin steak,thinly sliced and alittle more cayenne pepper.I really liked the use of only one skillet,genius.I served with a side of Mexican rice and sliced avocadoes,and will use this recipe in our regular rotation as we love Mexican food!!Thanks Huge!

Enjoyed preparing this for the Recipe Group.  I did enhance a bit, added more seasoning and added some smoked paprika as well.  I also had a zucchini on it's last legs, so I cut into strips and added, too.  Simple and delicious.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

Very good and easy to fix for a quick dinner provided you do the prep work ahead of time.  It even pleased both of my picky sons!  I will definitely make this again.

I ended up cutting these in thicker strips because I was grilling them. After grilling I cut them thinner. They were very good & enjoyed by all of us.

Recipe Group: This was great! Followed the recipe pretty much as stated, except my limes were teeny so I used two, and threw some lime zest in the marinade to boot. Loved the lime flavor and how the veggies got a bit of it as well. And for the record, we went through a ten pack of tortillas :) Also, juuuust realized I forgot the lettuce in the fridge :(

We liked it, but we didn't love it. I let it marinate overnight, so I was expecting big flavor and it just wasn't there. It was definitely quick and easy, but I doubt I will make it again.

I made these hoping for much more.  But I found that the chicken didn't have much of the yummy marinated taste that I thinking it would have.  Albeit, I didn't have lime juice, so I used lemon juice, but i figured with the cumin, paprika, chili powder and cayenne it would be quite flavourful.  Maybe I need to up the amount of spices.  Will try again, however.

I gave it an upgrade.  In MY OPINION you should never microwave tortillas that just leaves them slimy  so I used a tortilla pan, but an iron skillet or griddle work just as well.

This was a lot better than I expected.  The flavor was very good.  For a low sodium alternative, Iâ€™ll be making this again.

There wasn't enough liquid from the limes I used, so I added beer. I marinated the chicken overnight and these came out pretty good. Thanks for the recipe:)

It was good. I will try it again and brown the chicken more and add more seasoning. Added green and yellow pepper.

This is a good basic recipe for fajitas.  I substituted beef sirloin for chicken.  Next time I will double the marinade, because 1 lime did not generate very much juice, and I could not taste the lime at all.  We like to pile on the toppings and the salsa, so this turned out pretty well despite being short on marinade.

Good, but not what I'd consider fajita-tasting.  'May be my cooking, too.  I followed the marinade & it was a little lime-y (not too much) &, surprisingly, not super spicy either.

Loved that this was all done in one pan and it was simple enough. My son thought it was a bit boring (gave 3 stars). A few shakes of some hot sauce did the trick for me. I also added a couple more peppers.  Thanks Huge.

Recipe Group Selection:  03, May 2014 ~ Simple and delicious.  Loved that this was a one pan deal!  The marinade had very good flavor, but the next time I think I will double it, to give the meat a tad more flavor.  Along with the red peppers, I add yellow, orange and green peppers.  Served this with corn-on-the-cob and a fresh fruit salad.  We enjoyed dinner very much.  Thanks Huge, for sharing your recipe.

Recipe Group selection for May 4, 2014 â€“ We loved that it was not too spicy and very tasty.  In addition, it was simple to prepare and healthy too.  I added avocado and a little cilantro as a personal preference.

Recipe group 5/4/2014.  Love the almost fussless prep of fajitas any way, and these were very good.  I am knid of a wuss when it comes to spicy, and these were not over the top, just a nice blend.  Thank you for this recipe.

I had a small amount of chicken pieces so I scaled this down to two servings. I froze the chicken in the marinade and later thawed it in the refrigerator. I lost a little of the marinade to leakage so the moisture evaporated pretty much upon placing it in the pan. The flavor was subtle but good and worth marinating though it got a little lost amongst too many toppings. The lime juice came through the most upon tasting just the meat. I would perhaps add more seasoning next time but maybe not since it was quite good and we will certainly use this again. I was cooking outside so I wrapped the tortillas in foil and warmed on the grill rather than use the microwave. It only takes a minute over the gas burner.
