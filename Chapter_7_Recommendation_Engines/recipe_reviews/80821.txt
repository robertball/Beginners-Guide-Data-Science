I used this recipe as a base. I didn't use the onion soup mix or the tomato soup(way too much sodium), but I added fresh yellow onions, plenty of celery, lots of garlic powder and basil. I used extra ketchup and bbq sauce since I didn't use the tomato soup. Instead of Worshirshire sauce I used balsamic vinegar for a good zing...and added chopped garlic to the sauce as well. As another reviewer suggested, I used wheat germ instead of bread crumbs (now I think I will do that w/ every recipe that calls for bread crumbs for the health benefits!). Everyone liked this one!

This was very easy to make as any meatloaf is. I chopped the mushrooms very fine in a food processor, my finicky family never even knew they were in there, they also had no idea it was Turkey. Very moist and very flavorful. I would make it again.

I have made this a number of times and everyone in my family likes it. I'd never really liked meatloaf until I made it with this recipe. I've made it both with and without the mushrooms, either way has been fine. I love it!

I used this as a base because my husband is diabetic & has high blood pressure. I hide veggies in everything that I make, so I processed onion, celery, bell pepper together then added the mushrooms for just a bit. I make my own whole wheat bread crumbs & used onion powder for the soup mix. Added cayenne, cumin & garlic powder for spice. Mixed it all in my KA mixer. Used A-1 on top because ketchup & bbq sauce are high in sugar. Kids ate it with ketchup on top, the whole family raved about it. It was moist & delish! Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good!  I have tried plenty of meatloaf recipes, and this one is a keeper!  I followed the recipe exactly, and will do the same next time.

My husband and I found this a bit mushy. Maybe because of the bread crumbs when we are used to broken up pieces bread. Overall, easy to make and pretty good flavor. Liked the BBQ sauce.

This is wonderful, best meatloaf I have ever had. I did change the recipe just a little due mainly to what I had on hand. Instead of using the seasoned breadcrumbs I used a cup and a half of cooked white rice. Also I did not have the tomato soup so I used a can of no salt tomato sauce. Using the rice instead of breadcrumbs made it a little harder to handle so I just put the mixture in the pan and then shaped the loaf. I made the sauce for the top just as stated but with the tomato sauce and I added Parmesan shaker cheese to the tomato sauce. This helps thicken the tomato sauce and adds a little zing. Thanks for sharing as this is really great. muzz2005

This was my first time making Turkey Meatloaf and it was great! I also added 1/2 cup each of finely chopped onions and green bell pepper. My family loved it and i plan to make this meatloaf again. Thank you so much for this delicious recipe.

I'm fairly new to making meat loaf cause I always hated my moms.  Anyway, I thought this had a really great flavor.  I did change a few things.  I had some left over crushed tomatos so I substituted those for the soup.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of green onions and about a third of a yellow bell pepper for color.  Turned out great!!

I was suprised with how good this was only because after the 45 mins I checked it to see if it was "done enough" and it looked undercooked.  I baked it for another 20 mins and it still had that under done feel so I figured that's how its supposed to be.  My meat thermometer had just broke annd I had not had a chance to get another one.  I also thought the texture would be a little mushy but it wasn't.  My husdand and I have been working on eating healthier and moving on from ground beef and using ground turkey instead and this was the first recipe with ground turkey that I have used.  My husband is a huge meat loaf fan and is very picky and he absolutely loved this.  The only thing I did differently was add more mushrooms.  I definitely give this 5 starts!

It had too much of a barbeque taste and waaaay too much bread crumbs. I feel like 1/2 to 3/4 cup is enough. I'll give it a try again with modifications, but not one of my favorites.

way too much bread crumbs. As a general rule no more than 1/2 to 1 cup per lb of meat, onion soup may need adjusting also if crumbs are reduced. this recipe was just ok

This a wonderful meatloaf. My family doesn't like mushrooms, so i left them out. Some turkey recipes taste like a weak imitation for beef. But this is delicious on it's own!

Really enjoyed this recipe. My husband said it was better than his Mom's meatloaf! I made 4 mini loafs so they would cook quicker. Next time I might use a little less tomato soup.

This stuff has really improved my view on turkeyloaf! My mom used to make this...stuff...that was basically a big ball of turkey...YUCK! so i convinced her to use this recipe, and my family was verrrry thankful! I thought the texture was just a wee bit...weird...coulda' just been the turkey...but yeah, EVERYBODY in my family loves it! it's their favorite meatloaf recipe now.
I didn't have the onion soup mix so i added a bunch of finely minced onions. I also added garlic powder and basil. And i think next time i'll cut the stuff on top in half...it's a little bit to much barbque-y stuff.
Rachel, thank you EVERsomuch for posting this! :D

Besides the fact that my name is Rachel as well, this turkey loaf is AWESOME. I added a bbq sauce I had in my fridge, which ended up being a spicy one, and it actually gave the turkey loaf a little kick.

Delicious!  My wife and little boy enjoyed the meatloaf very much.  It was moist and delicious.  The meatloaf had a unique taste and was very good with a side of cous-cous.

When my daughter was small (she's 30 now) I was cooking some ground turkey and she came into the kitchen and asked me what I was cooking because it smelled like Joey (Joey was the dog).  I've never cooked ground turkey since.  Instead, whenever a recipe calls for it, I substutute ground chicken breast which I did here as well.  I used 8 oz of chopped mushrooms and sauted them before adding them to the meat mixture.  I also didn't have any Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, so I used Panko instead.  I also added a bit of sriracha to the meat mixture and to the glaze along with a bit of ground coriander (to the glaze only).  This came out great!  Nice and firm and not mushy at all.  I think the next time I make it, I will leave out the barbeque sauce because we thought it kind of overpowered the other flavors and use some mustard and brown sugar in its place.  Thank you for the recipe, RACHELLUARK!

This was awesome. I added some more veggies than suggested, as well as a little garlic and it came out amazing. It seems a little mushy, but don't be discouraged. It requires a little more time to cook, but it turns out so moist, and if you add more bread or bread crumbs, it really hikes up its modest calorie count. Can't wait to make again!

This meatloaf is really good!  My (normally picky) kids even loved it!  I didn't use fresh mushrooms or tomato soup.  It came our really tasty and moist.  Will definitely be making this again!!

This was good. The texture was a little too soft, but the taste was good.

I wanted this recipe to work, really. Unfortunately, it didn't. The only way we were able to redeem it was by mixing it with our side dish (corn) and eating as quickly as possible. It was too mushy and too bland, and too much work will need to be done with leftovers in order to make them edible. I guess turkey loaf just isn't for me. Sorry! :(

This didn't satisfy our tastebuds, it provoked them. When I made it last night, my husband thought it was fine, but I couldn't even get past the 3rd bite. We tried the leftovers again for lunch today, and this time my husband had a hard time getting it down while it tasted a little better to me. It helped me to cover the whole thing in ketchup, which is how I like to eat my meatloaf anyway. I think I'll go back to using ground beef and look for another recipe.

Just Okay.  I think our taste buds didn't care for the tangy flavour.

By far this is one of the best turkey loaf recipes. The others had no flavor. This loaf came out of the oven moist and light. It smells wonderful while cooking too. Using the turkey meat omitted the gristly or toughness that ground beef has sometimes.  loved this recipe rachel, thanks a bunch!

The only change I made was add about 1/2 cup more of the bread crumbs since the mixture seemed very wet. We both liked the flavors but the texture is nothing like beef so be aware of that.

I used a cup of mushrooms because I chopped too much, and I also used a tomato because I didn't have canned cream tomato soup.  I followed the other directions, and the meatloaf was very delicious! It wasn't mushy as some reviewers stated.

I prepared as outlined without modifications. It was my first time making a meatloaf and it was amazing. My boyfriend typically eats red meat and he loved it - think it was the addition of the bbq sauce. Highly recommend.

Wasn't pleased with this at all.  The onion soup is overwhelming for turkey.  I've been looking for a turkey-loaf.  This one isn't it.  The wife thought it was fair.

I thought this recipe was very tasty.  I didn't put Bar-B-Que sauce because I thought it  might be too  spicy.  I did put diced bell pepper and that gave it a nice flavor. My family really liked it and thought it was my best meatloaf so far-and I really like the fact that you use turkey instead of beef.  I could not tell it was turkey!  It was moist but stayed together and sliced perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for dinner last night, pretty much followed the recipe exactly. It was really good. My only comment would be it was a little salty. With adding the soup mix, ketchup, bbq sauce, etc., it was a bit much. I will probably look for a low sodium dry soup mix or use low sodium tomato soup next time. But, there definitely will be a next time!

My husband & I really enjoyed it. It was very tasty considering the meat was turkey. I would definitely make this again.

I thought this was very good and tangy. I love meatloaf and this is a good recipe to throw in the rotation.

This was good. I didnt miss the ground beed.  I made 4 mini loaves and they were a little mushy but not sure if that is because it was turkey.  The flavor was great but the next time maybe I will use a little less liquid to make it a little more dense.  Very good though.

This was the first time I'd ever made any kind of meat loaf- and this recipe was very easy to follow.  The turkey loaf was fantastic- tender, flavorful,and my husband thought it was beef!

Awesome, full of flavor even when using extra lean turkey.
