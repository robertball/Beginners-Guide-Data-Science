Great method for cooking hash browns.  I grated the potatoes into my salad spinner full of cold water - used that to triple rinse the potatoes and then drained them and spun the water out.  The clarified butter is perfect for these as it can cook at a higher temperature than whole butter.  I used a cast iron pan and don't flip or stir until you get a nice crisp bottom - then flip and stir and crisp up the rest.  Excellent!

I watched Chef John's video on this recipe & realized that my fresh taters always turned brown. I had given up on using fresh potatoes for hash browns & had turned to frozen. I used my food processor to grate an entire big yellow onion. Next I grated 8 russets & added that to the onion. Yum - I kept flipping these to make sure all of it turned brown & yummy! Rinsing potatoes in cold water, like rice. Who knew! Love that I learn something new all the time on this site!

I cooked them longer than the recipe calls for because i like my hash browns crunchy. Easy and very good.

While I thought the recipe was wonderful, I found that the inside of my hash didn't cook very well at the times specified. I chose to cook it for 10 minutes and then bake it for another 10 minutes and chose to sprinkle some cheddar and mozzarella cheese on top while it baked. I served it with fluffy scrambled eggs and a little ketchup!

Very good. A tip that I learned long ago is to press the shredded potatoes in a potato ricer, after soaking & rinsing time, while holding the ricer upside down, you're pressing a lot of water out this way. Then pat dry with paper towels. You're not going to press the raw potatoes through the ricer, you're just pressing more water out of the potatoes more efficiently. I used 1/2 shortening and half butter to fry the potatoes in, like my mother always did.

very good! I didn't have paper towels to pat the potatoes dry so after draining the cold water off of them the second time I just put a bowl under the strainer with the drained potatoes in it and used a small plate to press them down some and squeeze some of the excess water off. This worked fine. I added some red and green pepper strips and onions (had a bag of frozen ones), some chopped ham and a little shredded cheddar cheese. A few minutes before they were done I poured a couple of eggs that I had previously scrambled in a bowl with a little milk over the potato, onion, ham, and peppers mixture and cooked up while mixing some and made one of those breakfast bowl type dishes, with rye toast on the side. Thanks Chef John!

I tried this the way it was printed but found we like it better with the salt and pepper mixed in rather than sprinkled on top. Also I  always grate an onion into it. I make a huge pan of these and cook them just until a little brown and hot all the way through but not real brown. then I  cut it into 6 to 8 pieces and wrap in foil and slide them into a storage bag. That way I  have some made ahead and can save time by just getting one out of the fridge every morning and browning it in butter or bacon grease. My husband eats them every day so there is no spoilage. We use them up fast.

Yeah, i can finally make yummie hash browns, now more wasted potatoes! Mine didn't get as brown as the ones in the video, but they tasted great. (And even better with a little ketchup.) Will make again.  Thank you Chef John

Rinsing out the starch and squeezing the moisture out with a ricer worked great. Didn't even need to pat dry.  Always wondered why my fresh hash browns got so mushy. Used canola oil and seasoned salt with great results. Thanks for your tips!!

We liked these a lot.  I accidentally got a little heavy handed with the cayenne, but this was still pretty darn good.  I served this with the acapulco margarita grouper recipe on this site (but used tilapia instead) and the spiciness of the hash browns really complemented the fish dish.  (I know, I know--totally bizarre pairing, but hubby wanted hash browns today, so I made them for supper --lol).  We would definitely make again!

Ahh... Thats the key! Cold water rinse to get the excess starch out. I put my shreded potatos into a large doubled over cup towel, fold it up and then ring it out like a washcloth.  Makes 'em nice and dry then just bag it and pop it into the freezer for that next quick impulse meal. Also I do not peel the skins. Nice and rustic. Thanks for the insight!

Update:  I had made these going by the written recipe only back when I was not able to play the accompanying video. In viewing the video now I see my concerns were included in the video. I will try this recipe again following the video, as I do love and enjoy Chef John's recipes!

I enjoyed making these, and they taste great. These classic hash browns were enjoyed by the woke family. Do to the large amount of hash browns I used a kitchen towel to obsorb the extra moisture instead if paper towels. In the future however, I think I'll stick with frozen hash brown due to the amount time required to make these. Thanks for sharing, now I know how to make hash browns in a pinch.

A nice basic hash brown recipe.  I added a few yellow onions to the butter and we liked the addition of the cayenne pepper.  I did have to cook longer than 5 minutes per side.  Mine took about 8 minutes per side.  A good recipe that I will be making again.

Great recipe, worth watching video!! PATIENCE and that goes especially for those who make MORE than the recipe originally is intended for. We have a family of 6 and I made it with 7 yellow potatoes since that was all I had and they are a bit smaller than russets, so I just went with that. It was time consuming for me due to that, but if it were just my hubby and I , then it would have been a lot faster. Clarifying the butter is a great idea, I will continue to use that method, and add enough salt, potatoes do require more salt at times than expected, I did add enough, and the spicy addition of the cayenne is good. Maybe a little garlic or onion powder would be a nice addition, but not fresh, or it may add too much liquid to the recipe(??), not sure though. It is delicious just the way it is! REALLY Let it stick to the pan though, and I mean it when I say that, really do it. I had my electric burner on 5 (med heat) and it was just right for me, left it for a few minutes while stirring the potatoes on top of the crusting potatoes as they softened up and it was just right, if it is cooking too fast, just turn it down a notch, I also used a stainless pan, would have preferred a cast iron or stick free, but it came out clean in the end, and NOT BURNED as I had worried. My hubby kept saying I was going to burn them, he even grabbed the spatula and said he was going to "hack at them" and I scolded him (ha ha!), took it away, kicked him out of the kitchen and they were phenomenal!

I had all but given up on home made hashbrowns and resorted to the overly infested with sodium and preservatives frozen stuff.... Thank you so much for this recipe! I seasoned mine with a little lawry's seasoning salt and they turned out PERFECT!

This is an absolutely terrible recipe.  Anyone who rates this recipe 5 stars is not being honest.  You are not supposed to put the potatoes in water before you cook them!  It calls for WAY too much butter.  You also don't put cayenne pepper or paprika on it.  How could anyone recommend this recipe?  Don't even think about eating this if you cook it, just throw it away.  It is not edible.

Good basic recipe but had to add 2 tbsp. shallots with the shredded potatoes and cooked for a total of 20 minutes to get very crispy. 

If you want to take it a step further, add 2 cups of cooked, shredded corned beef five minutes before removing from the stove.

Excellent!  As per one review, I used my salad spinner for rinsing and drying the potatoes.  Worked great, and the hash downs were seasoned just right!!

Just like Mom made except she grated in some onion for flavour and didn't use any cayenne.  Reminded me of my childhood but I will go back to her version.  The basic recipe is great.  You may have to work in batches to avoid having the potatoes go brown.

I loved the recipe!! Though I feel that mine came out wrong due to using regular butter and an old pan (so the food got stuck), nonetheless I can't fault this recipe! Will retry this when I have got the time again.

I have tried to make hash browns for years with limited success.  Rinsing the potatoes and clarifying the butter made all the difference in the world.  The timing was perfect.  It resulted in crispy outsides and soft tender insides.  A great basic recipe! Thank you Chef John.

Finally! I've been successful in making great hash browns from fresh potatoes! The first secret was grating the potatoes into the cold water and then rinsing them repeatedly to remove the excess starch. Then drying the shredded potatoes was extremely valuable. Lastly, the cooking technique described by Chef John in the video produced outstanding results. I had made enough to have leftovers for the next day, but my husband snarfed down the entire amount, leaving nothing!! Thank you!!

This is how I always make mine. Simple, with no egg, flour, etc.  The only difference is I make separate "patties" or layer the bottom of the whole pan and when crispy on the bottom, I flip them. Crispy on outside and soft on the inside. My family loves them. You can add other things like bacon, onion, etc to your own liking. The key is do not turn them until crispy. Be patient while they brown.

After viewing the video I couldn't wait to try these. I am an admitted lousy breakfast cook, but still I try. Well today I made these hash browns with bacon & eggs, and man-o-man, my dear husband loved these. He remarked several times how good they were. Loved the tip about putting in water and rinsing and patting dry. These are things I have never done with my potatoes. I will be having these again. Thank you Chef John.

Super tasty! Just like I get at my favorite diner down the street. I usually stick to frozen hash browns at home but I had a couple of extra potatoes on hand and wanted to try my hand at these. They were much easier to make than I would have thought, and the taste was definitely worth the effort.

Yum, I just made these not long ago and this is now one of my favourite recipes for hash browns, not overly complicated or finicky to cook.  I couldn't be bothered clarifying my butter first, I just made sure to be careful so it wouldn't burn.  I used some nice red skinned potatoes so I kept the skin on because I like it.  The only problem I had was I picked a rather old and worn non-stick pan to cook them in so the potato stuck like no tomorrow!

Excellent, they tasted light and fluffy and were crispy. The trick was soaking them in the water.  If you like crispy hash browns, cook them longer than 5 minutes before flipping.  I was a little disappointed that I flipped them at 5 minutes but I just added time to the other side and kept flipping them.

I never had hash browns before (it's not common in my country) but I really wanted to give it a try. This recipe seemed simple, and really is. It's very nice, very classic, and I think I'll just add my personal touch next time, but other than that, it's a great simple recipe. You can add whatever you want (I think I'll try onions next time, according to some reviews I read) Thanks for sharing.

Tasty and kids couldn't get enough! Also, thank you for not blathering for 500 words about how much you loved it growing up, or how potatoes are so versatile, or how "no one likes soggy hash browns." Food blogs suck - you gave us the goods right away and I appreciate it!

Seems like I always give 5 stars but this deserves six if possible! A perfect way to cook hash browns. I also grated a sweet onion in  the potatoes which tasted great. Cooked them a little longer for added crispness and used some smoked paprika for flavor. And of course the rinse in water which I had never done before topped perfection!! Another great Chef John receipe!

I don't know what clarified butter is... I substituted for regular butter.  I also used sweet potatoes.
DON'T DO THAT.
I could be half brain damaged... but this turned out absolutely awful.  45 minutes into this ordeal, the shredded disaster that made it into the pan (the remainder was all over my kitchen) was not brown at all.  The end result was mushy sweet potato.  I tried to save it by frying in some oil, which didn't help.
Making substitutions in the recipe will result in a terrible kick off to your Sunday morning, and you'll still be craving hash browns.

my hubby said these were the best hash browns he had ever had!!  I tend to agree.  I added onion to the potatoes, and grated cheese on top of the finished product.  But the potatoes themselves were great!

Really great! They didn't turn as brown as I had hoped, although that is probably because I included a little less butter than the recipe called for... still turned out tasty. :)

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I let the potatoes cook longer than the recipe states, as I like crispy hashbrowns. I no longer need to buy frozen hash browns from the grocery store.

I have tried making home made hash browns before but they always had an odd taste. After reading through the directions and rinsing them with cold water..wow what a difference. Everyone gobbled them up!

I had never do homemade hash brown cause I thought it was imposible. I tried this recipe and so easy and tasty. It's better than the frozen ones. And my family loved it.

Super easy and tasty! I think the cayenne & paprika are optional. They tasted great with just salt & pepper. I didn't shred mine. Instead, I diced them up real small. They took longer though. (About 30-35 min.)

This recipe was awesome.  I had tried it plain before, but this past weekend I added diced ham, onion, and cheese  with excellent results.

I've made these for years only (and I know not the healthiest but very good) is to use some of the drippings from bacon.  I like mine to be browned on the outside and a soft center.  I'll make one large potato cake or 4 smaller ones.  If the large one I'll let it get crispy brown and then flip it over or if too large, cut it into 4 sections.  Let them get crispy on the other side & put them on a paper towel to drain when done. Sometimes if making them for dinner, I'll also add chopped onions into the raw potatoes before cooking.  I salt & pepper before turning them over.

Really good! I mixed the salt in with the pototoes just before putting them in the pan so it would be mixed in more evenly. Instead of cayenne and paprika, I liberally sprinkled in some “Slap Yo Mama” Cajun seasoning. Delicious!

Solved the mushy (undercooked) centre problem by putting a cover over the pan for the first half, so the potato was both steamed and fried.

Hashbrowns have been my Achilles heel- until today! Rinsing shreds until clear made ALL the difference. 
I also added 1/4c flour & 1 T cornstarch, then browned in bacon grease. I kept the first batch warm in the oven on a cast iron griddle & they stayed crispy for seconds.
Thank you for this recipe & finally helping me make yummy hashbrowns!

Made April 2019 for Easter brunch. 
Tasty and easy.  Good go-to hashie recipe. Don't forget to dry off your shredded and drained potatoes like I did, though, 'cause you'll lose crispness.

I make these hash browns all the time, exactly as stated in the recipe and they turn out great every time.  I have tried and failed to make hash browns many times until I discovered Chef John's recipe.   The only issue I ever have is when I try to make too much at once.  But even then they are very good, just a little less crisp then when using the amounts that the recipe calls for.

These were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-! This recipe should say 1 serving! LoL. Crispy, tender and buttery! I cooked a tad longer than the recipe called for.. 7 min per side, they were perfection.. Oh, and I added the smallest sprinkle of onion powder! Good stuff.

Delicious, if you like the taste of raw potatoes. I rated this 2 stars instead of 1 because technically 1 star means "I couldnt eat it", which wasn't true for me. I just didn't enjoy the result. At the recommended cooking time, I had potatoes that were barely beginning to brown. After MUCH more time, I ended up with shredded potatoes that tasted like baked potatoes that had been baked for much too long. Not technically inedible, but nothing close to proper hash browned potato. If you choose to give this recipe a go, my advice is to arm yourself with either a package of store bought hash brown potatoes, or bag of potato chips, to mitigate the craving for properly prepared potatoes that you'll be left with.  The author of this recipe must have a lot of friends willing to give fake reviews, for this recipe to have over 100 five-star ratings.

I scrubbed instead of peeling my potatoes. I grated them in my food processor, and as per someone else's suggestion, used my salad spinner to rinse them off 3 times. All three of these things made prep for this a breeze!! I'd never thought of using clarified butter for this but oh my gosh was it delicious! I made my own by heating a stick of butter and carefully removing the solids on top with a spoon. I saved them and put them over the eggs I served with the hash browns. Yum!!

These hash browns turned out great.  Rinsing the potatoes a couple of times kept them from sticking together in a starchy mess.  I cut my potatoes into small cubes and didn't pat them dry.  It took longer for them to cook, but they were perfect.  I added fresh chopped chives during the last couple of minutes of cooking for extra flavor.   So much better than frozen hash browns!

Really good, easy to make, drain before cooking is important and throw butter in the pan it still works.

I made a few tweaks to this recipe by using regular butter on a cast iron griddle and adding minced onion instead of the cayenne pepper, but it was the best hash browns I have ever had. They were simply delicious and I will definitely make this again.

I loved these hash browns. Thank you Chef John. They turned out fluffy and crispy on the outside. Watching the video helped a ton. Removing the starch is such a great tip and using the clarified butter was great.

I don't know what I did wrong, but it made way too much, and it turned into a disgusting gray mush. I cooked it for the time described, and it came out raw. It took about 45 minutes for it to finally come out cooked. I've never been so frustrated cooking hash browns before.

I just want to say thank you! I am by no means a cook by any stretch of the imagination. Kind of sad but I am 31 and didn't really start learning to cook until a year or two ago. I love hashbrown and eggs but had no idea how to do hashbrowns so this is a life saver

Simple and delicious!  I like them crispy, so I let them sit at least ten minutes before I flipped them.  Then, let them sit another ten minutes.  Well worth the wait!

Next time a larger skillet will give more room for the potatoes to brown evenly. I used chipotle powder which worked well. Next time I will let it cook down a bit before I disturb the mixture. Some of the potatoes  did not cook well this try. A lot of work for a quick bite and now that I know how long it will take, I can better time the rest of the meal.

I will make this again.  It totally satisfied my craving for breakfast cafe hash browns.  I'll probably just stick to adding only onions next time and leave the sweet peppers for another recipe, but if there's bacon grease available--into the pan with the hash it goes.

Simple and classy for a perfect brunch. Made this on a whim as friends were coming over for brunch. Quick to make with easy clean up. Used butter/margarine combo to reduce burning and turned out great.

Can't believe I haven't tried this before.  What a wonderfully simple and delicious new breakfast  staple for the family.   The kids absolutely loved it.... so did !   

Remember to use a plate to flip the hash browns.  It was easy-pezzy.

Terrible recipe. 'Chef' John must have left out important information. Cooking times are not 5 minutes per side but closer to fifteen minutes per side. This is the second time I made these and followed the directions exactly. 0/10 Would not make again.

Pretty good! I'm going to Uni next year so I basically have started panicking trying to learn how to cook easy stuff ;; these were super good and easy to make!! I cooked them for about ten minutes longer however since the time specified wasn't enough, and used jackets instead of russets as it was all I had, but it worked the same :))

I've tried several recipes for hash browns but the results of this one were the best of my efforts, which I'm guessing has to do with rinsing the shredded potatoes. The only thing I did differently was cook the potatoes in 1 TBSP avocado oil and 2 TBSP butter (not clarified). Also, I used a ricer to squeeze as much of the water out as possible (got that tip from another recipe). They were perfectly crispy and just ... delicious. Thanks for sharing this technique!

This recipe was way too much work with poor results.  As noted by other reviewers, starting with raw potatoes is risky and messy.  I find that it is far easier to boil the potatoes the night before. Start with cold water and let them boil 20-25 minutes until almost done but still firm. Place in refrigerator overnight, scrap off skins and grate directly into hot oil and butter on medium to medium-low heat (you want to see the oil bubbling around the edges).  Depending on the stove,  7 minutes on the first side and 5 minutes on the second side. If you want them softer in the middle, pile them thicker in the skillet. Don't mess with them while they're cooking.

Why is everyone grating and rinsing raw potatoes for hash browns?  Try, just once, precook a russet potato in the microwave for 5 min, let it cool, grate the potato and fry it in butter or oil with your spices.  I think you might like this approach to fried potatoes.  The microwave pre-cook converts the potatoes starch to sugar instead of trying to rinse  it out.  Let me know what you think.

Great recipe for classic tasting hash browns. I was worried that they wouldn't stay together but leaving them in the pan for longer on each side proved this wrong.

Ok, I did not use clarified butter, but canola oil. The first time other than that, I followed these directions closely, but the hash browns were not cooked enough. The second time I tried these I made smaller batches and the hash browns came out either too brown or not brown at all.  Is clarified butter the secret? So why not attach the recipe for making it to the recipe for the hash browns? I will not make them again with oil.

The best hash browns I have ever made. I had on hand 4 baby Dutch yellow potatoes which I shredded in food processor.  The saving grace was , rinsing them in cold water three times, drying them, (I used a salad spinner twice )and the clarified butter. Since the butter can withstand the high heat the hash browns crisped up nicely in about 15 minutes. I seasoned with just a little garlic powder, onion powder, pepper. The secret was certainly rinsing, drying and butter. Thank you for posting will always use this recipe.

Great flavor and easy method all in one. Easy enough for a beginning cook as well for a seasoned cook. I made these exactly as the recipe said in my cast-iron skillet and they turned out perfect the first time.

Made  them twice, the second time I didn't peel the potatoes and regretted it - it makes them taste bitter if not peeled first, so don't skip that step.  Other than that they  are delicious but a bit time consuming to make. Be prepared to cook them longer than 10 minutes per side if you want them crispy.

I hadn't had hash browns before I found this recipe, so I figured I trust John and might as well make them. They're a bit difficult to get the right consistency going for, but you'll get the hang of it eventually, and when you do, they're lovely.  As a matter of fact, they even gave me enough confidence to try my eggs sunny side up for once! Absolutely wonderful with fresh sour cream on top.

It took a lot longer than 10 minutes to cook fully, and the potatoes lacked flavor. I will try this recipe again sometime.

Great recipe! I added Parmesan cheese while cooking it, and it added beautiful  flavor. I recommend lightly cooking the potatoes then forming them into rectangular "patties", then cooking until crispy on each side. Absolutely delicious!!!

I really did like this. It would have been fine with the actual directions but I made them into little "patties" after i added the spices then i threw them on the skillet. I also mixed in chopped spring onion for some green and onion powder. To help them stick i threw on a slice of cheese. It was a really yummy breakfast. If you're just making breakfast for yourself I'd recommend just using one potato, two left me feeling really full.

I used a cheese grater to shred potatoes,  easy on the cayenne pepper. Needs toast eggs and bacon or fried bologna with it. If you're going to cook an egg after wrap up with aluminium foil to keep warm. Keep the cheese grater to grate some cheese and bing bang boom this recipe works 5/7, would recommend. Just use butter tho

This is an eye opener.  I did not realize washing the starch from the potatoes was such an important step.  Being vegan, I cooked them in cocoanut oil.  It worked just fine.  When Chef John says a large skillet, I believe he means a minimum 10 inch or possibly 12 inch skillet.  My cast iron skillet is only 8 inches so I ended up cooking in batches,  Really happy with outcome.  Will definitely make again.

I prepared my hash browns by using my food processor. Then,  I rinsed the potatoes and squeezed out the water using  paper towels. It took four paper towels to get the water out. To make for quicker cooking, I placed the hash browns on a micro safe dinner plate and microwaved the potatoes  for two minutes. I then slid the potatoes into a preheated pan and let cook for 3-4 minutes on medium heat before turning.  Lift up a section of the hash browns to see if the potatoes are browning before flipping. After turning the hash browns watch carefully so the potatoes do not burn.

I'm a wiz in the kitchen, but hash browns have always been my pitfall -- they're deceptively difficult. This recipe finally fixed that, and I can't thank the author enough! I now know that the double-wash, pat-dry method is absolutely key to successful hash browns!

I used my food processor to shred the potatoes. I then used my salad spinner after the soaking to get all the water out. I used avocado oil instead of butter and cooked them on the flat stove top grill we have so they would be better spread out with more crispy edges. I seasoned with lawry's instead of paprika. Absolutely divine and so easy with the food processor.

Finally!! I quit making hash browns because I could never get them right. With this method, they turned out perfect! I left out the pepper and paprika for my 6-year-old, and I cooked them a little longer so they would be crispier.  They tasted perfect, and best of all, the potatoes didn't turn pink! Thank you for sharing this and saving me from further frustration.

The only problem was the cooking instructions... It reads to fry for 5 minutes, however it's closer to 15 minutes on the first side.  Other than that, good hash browns.

I made these after making bacon and used some of the leftover bacon grease instead of the clarified butter. They were delicious and so easy. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks!

These were THE best hash browns that I have ever made. I've never been able to get them crispy in the past. The only change I made was using Yukon Gold potatoes (as that was what I had on hand). I used the larger size of my 2 shredder disks and I left the skins on. I triple rinsed, dried well, and cooked in clarified butter with S&P + Paprika. Not sure if it was my large shreds, the skin on, the Yukon Gold, or my range, but it took nearly 15 min to start to get crispy and another 5+ of stirring/browning. TOTALLY worth it. This will be my go-to recipe for hash browns. In fact i'm off to the store and will buy more potatoes so I can prep them to make a small batch with breakfast a couple of mornings this coming week.

So easy and tasty! Didn't realize how easy it was to make. Used my food processor for shredding.

Very good recipe but, I did add onions to it.  Would have been just as good without them.  This will be my potato recipe to go to from now on.  I may try adding some green pepper to it next time for a little change.

Best hash browns ever!  Made exactly as written.  Used one large russet for 2 avg servings, but did use a little extra butter and had to increase cooking time.

Never been able to cook fresh hash browns until now. Great easy recipe. Rinsing potatoes in cold water  to remove extra starch made the difference between soggy potatoes and crunchy.

This recipe is amazing! I cut the potatoes into tiny little squares to speed up time and then I used course ground black pepper instead of regular. While the potatoes were cooking I put mexican cheese over it while stirring and it was beautiful to watch!

Simple, yet delicious!

The trick is  really in the rinsing, double rinsing is absolutely necessary, I think. Some potatoes can require triple or even quadruple rinsing. It all depends on the type of potato you are using really ( rich in starch or not. I recommend using a more firm and slightly waxy type of potato "yellow kinds"), Depending on the amount of water your potato strands can cold you might need to pat dry with paper towels. 

I mix in canola oil with the melted butter, this makes for a more fried texture of the patty. 

and do not pre-cook!

Lovely, lovely, lovely. Reminds me sooooo much of Sunshine Potato Stixx. Only used Salt and ground Black Pepper (not freshly ground - store bought package) to season. Hubby and Son did enjoy too!

Something you can do to avoid the undercooked potatoes problem is to bake them beforehand, but only about half the time you would normally cook them for. It makes the insides softer and the outsides crunchier. But this recipe was spot on! Delicious!

Love this recipe! I lost my grater during renovations, so I hand cut all the potatoes (which takes forever) but it still turned out perfect. I add a little onion, and cook a little longer because I like my hashbrowns a little on the crunchy side. Turns out perfect every time! Thanks chef John!

Very good, I added onions and peppers too!  Be patient when frying it, it took a while to get them crispy, I thought I did something wrong but they turned out perfect.  My husband (the usual hash brown maker) said he has never been able to do hash browns that tasted this good.  Thanks for submitting!

I love hash browns (must be the Irish in me) and usually cube pre-cooked white potatoes to make them. This however looks like the deal. I'll use Old Bay to replace all the spices. Yum!!

I cooked them for about 45 minutes on low and they got golden crispy and chewy.  Excellent, simple recipe. I will be making these to put in a breakfast sandwich since I think they will keep their great texture.

A great classic dish - delicious!  I made more potatoes than what the recipe called for, but increased the other ingredients proportionately.  I used a LOT of potatoes, but they really do shrink up when you cook them, so I could have made even more than I did, I will have to remember that for next time.  Like other reviewers have pointed out, the cooking time is definitely longer than listed here, but that could partially be because I used more potatoes.  Basically, just keep cooking until they get to the crispiness you like... and the seasonings can really be adjusted to personal taste too, this is a great recipe, you really can't mess it up!

I made this recipe and the only thing I did different was I layed the shredded potatoes long ways in a clean dish towel and twisted it at both ends to get all of the water out.it helps if you have someone at the other end of the towel this way you can twist it a little more.I have been cooking since I was 7 years and at 13 I worked in a cafe on the Redondo Beach Ca. pier.That was 55 years ago and I still love to cook for everyone.

Absolutely loved this recipe....never made homemade hash browns beforeand this will NOW be my go to recipe...I trust ever recipe that Chef John has put up...thanks John for such a great and oh so easy recipe.

I've tried this and I have a BIG problem.  I like them crisped again and again breaking them up, like you did, and re-crisping yet another (and another) layer.  To do this I start with two pans full and eventually combine them.  I can have the soft stuff in mashed.  Actually, couldn't you make a nice fluffy pot of mash at the same time? Love your stuff Chef John.  Followed you for a long time. Keep it up.
