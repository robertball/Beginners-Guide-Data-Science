I made this very quickly this morning before work as I'd read Candace's review and wanted to let it sit for a bit before we dug into it. I did make up my own ranch dressing out of my homemade dry ranch dressing mix and a third of a cup each of plain nonfat yogurt, reduced fat mayonnaise and reduced fat sour cream. The dills I used were garlic dills. We absolutely loved this dressing. We ate this with carrot chips, sliced cucumbers and broccoli "trees" but I think this would make a great chip dip and this would make an excellent quick fill in for tartar sauce. VERY dilly and the flavors blend together perfectly. I think this may be our new favorite "ranch" dressing!

I'm not a pickle fan; especially DILL pickles. After the first bite which was on a cracker, I thought, YUKE! But, being a person who doesn't like to make snap judgements, I just put it in the fridge. I went to the store the next day and purchased some veggies. Pulled out the dip and snacked on the veggies while cooking dinner that night. Yow-za!!! Really Good! We couldn't stop eating it and ate it all gone. This recipe needs to sit overnight to meld the flavors. It's a zingy, strong full bodied dip and really good. 4 stars because of the initial taste factor.

This was delicious with some ridged potato chips. We added a little of the dill pickle juice too.
