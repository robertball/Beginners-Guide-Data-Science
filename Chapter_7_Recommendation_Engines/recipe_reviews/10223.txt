I don't understand how so many people didn't get this recipe right. It is as easy as they come. 16 oz. of graham crackers isn't just one of the small plastic packages. In the box I bought, it was 3 plastic packages of crackers. I really liked this recipe. I added an additional 1/2 cup peanut butter and they turned out great! Plan on sharing because this is a big batch and they are rich.

The first time I made these I realized the butter amount should have been two STICKS, not two CUPS.  After making this adjustment, my family and I have enjoyed these bars several times.

This recipe has to be wrong or it's just the most disgusting thing ever. There is no way you can "press" this gooey mess into a pan and the unspecified "package of graham crackers" just leaves it up to your imagination, companies package their crackers differently from each one. This mess, with a HUGE waste of butter, ended up in the trash.

WOW.  REALLY SWEET AND REALLY GOOD! Had to Sub chocolate grahams and white morsels- kept everything else the same.  The ingredient ratios are correct.  I can't wait to make this with the regular grahams and the chocolate chips- although this version was really good too!

This is a really good recipe. I make it in a ready made graham cracker crust and use only 2 Cups of powdered sugar.

The taste was very good but the bottom part crumbled A LOT and fell apart! I changed the margerine to 2 sticks like suggested but seemed way too dry.  Also, good tip is to cut while the topping is still wet as it separates when trying to cut it when set. I used a 9X13 pan but would try a larger one next time because the bottom layer was pretty thick for such a rich treat!

I had great success with this recipe.  We live in Malaysia where we cannot get Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  I made these for a Christmas Open House and had RAVE reviews from it from our American friends.  I cut the candy into bite size pieces and placed them in candy cups. These will be a yearly Holiday treat at our house!

I followed the recipe exactly as it is listed and had no problems.  I think the important part is not to melt your 2 cups of butter, but to just soften it.

The cookies are wonderful and taste just like the candy.  These are very simple to make cookies and great with kids.  Since these are no bake cookies; and can use the microwave to melt the butter and chocolate; a simple classroom type treat.   I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. Bring the pan up to room temp. before trying to cut otherwise the cookie crumbles under the chocolate.

I followed this recipe exactly, but it never hardened enough to even think about cutting into bars.  We are spooning it over ice cream as a topping.  I think the recipe states too much butter perhaps.  Not making this one again.

Things to keep in mind are that if you want a "Softer" bar use less Graham Cracker Crumbs and increase the amount of butter, and Peanut butter in the mix. These must be kept in an Air Tight container at all times or they will dry out very fast get hard turn into a PB Brick. I keep mine in a "Tupperware Box" in the refrigerator and let them warm to room temp before cutting them, Also heat a knife in hot running water helps make it easier to cut candy. Never try cutting right out of the refrigerator just asking for trouble. You can substitute Butter Flavor Crisco for real butter and I use a little bit of vanilla in my mix. Adding Paraffin wax to the chocolate also help keep it shine. I buy Graham Cracker Crumbs in bulk but its best to make them in the food processor ahead of time keep them frozen for over a year. I have kept Several Gallon bags in the freezer of Cracker Crumbs for over 2 years, but make sure they are have not picked up any smells or tastes from being in the freezer that long. If they do you can always spread thin on a cookie sheet and freshen up in a hot oven at 350 for a few minutes at a time. Even toasting them in the oven before using them wont hurt but let them cool and it can make your mix more "Dry" so account as far as Butter and Peanut Butter.

I only used 2 sticks of butter and 2 cups of suar.  I pressed the batter into cupcake shells and that worked out great
