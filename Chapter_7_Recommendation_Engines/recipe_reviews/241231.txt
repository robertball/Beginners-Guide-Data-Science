Tastes like eggs and a banana. My six-year-old said it was good except for the banana. She ate a few bites, then handed it to me and asked for scrambled eggs instead.

I've been making this recipe for a while, except I use 2 brown eggs, and I do add a tablespoon of pancake mix just to thicken it up a bit. With regular pancakes, I feel sluggish and weighted down after eating them, so this recipe is great when I still want pancakes without the after effects. I normally eat bananas daily, so the bit of banana taste doesn't turn me off. I still add a little bit of butter on top, and eat them with syrup.  I've recommend this recipe all the time to friends.  :)

Pretty good, though I added 1/2 tsp each of vanilla extract & cinnamon.  May also add baking soda & a little coconut flour next time!

Made this for my bride this morning. She loved it just followed the recipe as written. I will try s Tbs of pancake flour next time because it sounds like a great idea.

So easy and super quick both picky eaters love them, as do I. Technically there are two ingredients and you can use butter for a crisp edge. Omit the butter if there's too many ingredients for ya! Lol. Tried to add a photo but all recipes is a bit behind the times and won't let me add a photo from my mobile device.

My 7-year-old and I loved these!  I would definitely make them again.  Definitely a great alternative to 'traditional' pancakes.

I took one bite and same with what HSMOM26 said taste like egg and banana. My kids also didn't really eat it a few bites only and said they were done and didn't want anymore. I'd rather stick to just a basic pancake recipe.

My brother and I tried this recipe three times.
The first time I just did 1 pancake, which worked alright. But the more in one batch we tried to make, the more downhill it went. 
        I think this is great if you are just making it for yourself, but if you want to feed a crowd with it, its a might more complicated. We had to add Gluten Free flour to the batch to help it stay together in the pan. After that point it was pretty good, but it could definitely still use improvement.

I did not try these because I personally don't like bananas, but I made these for my children and that is where my rating comes from.  One 3 year old said they were good, but only ate one of them (way less than she usually would eat).  Another 3 year old picked at them and ate a few bites, then proceeded to only eat strawberries for breakfast.  The 9 month old ate it fairly happily, but preferred his oatmeal.  Based on these reactions, I don't think I will make this again, but I do appreciate the speediness and convenience of this recipe.

I use one large egg and half a banana - much less overpowering on the banana front.  My nephew loves them!

These were good. Not very pretty but tasty. I added a pinch of salt and some vanilla. They’re also good reheated in a frypan the following day.

I make these all the time. I use 2 eggs to 1 banana and sometimes add a dash of cinnamon. They need nothing more. I make extra and keep them in fridge for a quick and healthy b’fast.

I made it with three bananas  three eggs a dash of cinnamon and had to add brown rice flour to thicken it. I used coconut oil instead of butter. But I was very pleasantly surprised. They taste wonderful.

I know some people like these, and it's not the recipe's fault that my taste buds just don't. I keep trying these recipes out thinking that I'm doing something wrong. In the past, they have burned, undercooked and fallen apart. I decided to try one more time after watching the video for this recipe. I found that I have to cook on medium low heat 3 min on first side and 2 min on the other for them not to burn and to cook all the way through. Even when they cook well, I just don't like the texture. I almost think they would be better cooked as scrambled eggs.

Good recipe, as a foundation.  I added cinnamon, vanilla and almond flour.  My family loved them.  I  felt it needed a pinch of salt.

I find using a blender for the pancake to be useful, I also use peanutbutter on the pancakes instead of the traditional syrup.

The pancakes turned out great, just the right consistency, definitely a breakfast favorite for my family and i

Made this recipe, but added 1/4 tsp of baking powder. Then added a handful of blueberries, and one diced/cubed apple. It was delicious, even had buddies at school asking what I was eating out of envy.

LOVE THESE!  Just started making these (2 eggs, 1 banana) a few days ago.  They are  filling and so very easy to make.  Think I will back it down to 1 egg (jumbo) & 1 banana, thinking that may make it less runny.  
   I make mine with coconut oil & cinnamon, combined with the banana i don't need any syrup!

My husband liked this recipe but I used way more butter than called for to get them crispy because with the amount called for they were goopy.
