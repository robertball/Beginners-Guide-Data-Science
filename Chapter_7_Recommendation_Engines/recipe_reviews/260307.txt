Delicious soup. I omitted the corn, and added swiss and cheddar cheese. This one's a keeper:)

Followed the recipe for my first time making this dish.  It was very good, and I'll make it again, but with just a couple changes.  It was a little too thick for my taste, but adding more broth should fix that.  When I made rivels for a different potato soup recipe, they were made with Bisquick and egg rather than just plain flour and egg and had a nice dumpling texture.  These rivels were dry and chewy to me, so I'll sub in Bisquick.  With those small changes, I really look forward to having this again.
