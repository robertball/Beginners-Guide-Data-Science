Hello all..I am Kristi G.  This is MY recipe.  I submitted it last year under Kristimoo1. I am reviewing myself today and giving myself 2 stars for failure to give you guys the correct recipe.  DO NOT use an entire jar of sauce.  I always use 2/3 to 3/4 of a jar.  It won't turn out terrible with an entire jar but it's unnecessarily saucey, filling up the entire glass baking pan and will then take longer to cook. My apologies for any confusion.  Please try this meal for a healthy and delicious way to enjoy more fish in your diet!!

i just made this for dinner. to tell the truth i was doubtful about the combo. but it came out very good.i did make some changes. first i sauted the onion and garlic in a little butter. I used less sauce and more haddock- just under 2 pounds of fresh haddock to 1/2 jar of sauce (i used Roa's marinara)i left out the tomatoes (if you do include them i would recommend a flavored one or add seasonings. and use a good sauce cause its the main flavor off the dish) lightly sprinkled the top with italian seasoning before baking i also did half the cheese and replaced the other  half with paremsan. i served with angel hair but larger sized pasta would work well too.

Recipe very tasty.  I made a few changes just to suit my taste. I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and only used about 1 cup of jarred sauce for the bottom and used a generous helping of italian seasoning on top of diced tomatoes. Did not use mozz. cheese just sprinkled a little parm. cheese after cooking.  I used 1 1/2 pounds of Haddock and it was still alot of sauce.  Very good base receipe can be doctored to fit anyone's taste.

Great recipe! Tastes like a fancy restaurant, but without the high price or slow service. Went over well with the family too. It was fairly quick and easy. I'm a 16 year old guy and I cooked it no sweat. I highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent recipe! I agree that it is a bit saucey, but I and my husband found it to be a perfect match with steamed Jasmin rice. Thank you!

We enjoyed the recipe and only changed a few things. I sliced the onions thinly and then added capers on top. Nice flavor

This was very good. Maybe a bit too saucey. I felt the sauce overwhelmed the fish. I'll cut the amount of pasta sause in half next time I make it.

this  was quite tasty but next time i will soften the onion and garlic in some butter before adding it to the dish - the onion was just too crunchy for my taste.

Pretty good, but make sure you use a tasty sauce because that is the main flavour in the dish. I sprinkled with parmesan cheese as well. Yum.

Reduce the pasta sauce in this by about half, definitely saute the onions until they are translucent before baking, and you can wait to put any cheese on this until the end.  Very good with pasta.

My husband and I really liked this recipe but the kids wouldn't eat it. They would rather eat baked fish with nothing on it but a little salt. I like the fish cooked in the tomatoes and sauce. It had a very good flavor.

I rarely write reviews of the food I make from Allrecipes.com even though just about everything I've made has been really good, however this recipe was so AMAZING that I had to let everyone know. I made it exactly as it was written given the additional instructions by the author herself. The only tiny, tiny criticism I have is that maybe the next time I'll use sweet onions as oppose to white onions (they were a little bitter for my personal taste) but even with that, it was still so, so good!

I don't eat fish but I made this for my parents and they raved over it and threatened me with bodily harm if I didn't add it.

i used all organic ingredients:  a 16 oz jar of organic tomato basil sauce, fresh basil from garden layered w/garlic & shallots and l.5 lbs fresh haddock from costcos. then baked as in directions, added the mozz and served w/organic whole wheat angel hair pasta.  we were so pleasantly surprised that i have to add this comment. it was easy too.  the only changes i'll make in future are to thicken up sauce a little more since this one, although very good, was a little watery.  great new way for fish filets & you can add whatever you want to change it up: different sauces & cheeses, etc.  we're eating the leftovers next day, that's how good this was.

Great recipe. Well received by the family including our toddlers. I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I skipped it and also used less sauce as the recipe submitter suggested. Topped w/ mozz and Parmesan cheeses. Next time I might try just Parmesan. Served over linguine with a spinach salad for a great meal.

THIS DISH WAS FAST AND EASY TO MAKE I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANYBODY LOOKING TO CHANGE UP FROM THE TRADITIONAL BUTTER/BREADCRUMB/BAKE DISH. I USED A JAR OF VICTORIA LOW SODIUM MARINARA SAUCE WHICH SEEMED TO WORK VERY WELL WITH IT.

I order something similar to this when I go to my fav Italian restaurant.  I loved this recipe!  I actually sauted the onions and garlic on low for about 5-10 mins, then added all the ingredients and baked.  I just used plain sauce from a jar, no chunks of tomato at all.  It was still delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

A simple and delicious recipe (even for my non fish-loving husband).  I used everyone's advice and altered the recipe a bit.  I used 1 cup of tomato sauce, drained a can of diced tomato really, really well (or it will be too juicy), added about 1 tsp. of italian seasoning, and sprinkled the fish with Kraft paremesan cheese before adding the grated cheese. Thank-you all for your tips!

LOVED THIS...Made it last night, pulled down the olive oil, used less shredded parm and made sure I used a good quality jar sauce...actually used an artichoke pasta sauce and fired roasted tomotoes and it was to die for.  Made it with an eggplant pepper relish (recipe on here) and it was a perfect, low fat, tasty dish.  I did increase the dish to 1 3/4 pounds of fish without changing anything else and it was perfection.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

A great base recipe!! I sprinkled the haddock with a little bit of dried dill and a handful of torn baby spinach topped with about 1/2 cup of rose sauce and shredded gouda. Looked and tasted fantastic.

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a new way to make fish.  I ended up adding extra spices and extra cheese, and the dish was still a little bland.  Don't get me wrong, it was good.  But probably more of a starting point for a recipe like this.

Thought I would try this for something a little different. Did not find that the taste of the fish went well with the sauce at all.     Maybe the recipe would lend itself better to chicken but my family and I did not enjoy the blend of flavors.

This dish was just ok for me. I think if I changed a few ingredients to my liking it would be better.

At first bite, I wasn't a fan.  Yet, I found myself continuing to go back for more.  The key to this dish is to get a little bit of everything in every bite.  This was super easy to throw together (I used a frozen, thawed in the frig, .8 lb haddock filet).  I used a scant amount of sauce on the bottom and, if I make this again, I'd skip the sauce and use a larger jar of stewed tomatoes, split.  THANKS for the recipe!

Delicious,  quick,  and easy!  Used flounder. And added chopped kale.  Left out the onions ad garlic because I had a nice spicy marinara sauce.  Left out the extra tomatoes because I was out. Used less sauce as suggested.  Served with buttered angel hair.

Loved it! Didn't use so much sauce as the post below me advised not to. I don't think you need to soften the onions as other people posted. I think if you just finely chop them as it says its soooo good. So basically this recipe needed no adjustments and myself and my guests loved it. Thanks!

This dish is great! I didn't have time to thaw, so I used frozen haddock fillets. I followed the recipe as written using my own from scratch pasta sauce. I baked it in a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes, then added one half of a 6-oz. can of tomato paste as it got quite juicy, and the mozzarella cheese, and baked another 15 minutes. I served it over whole wheat linguini. It was restaurant quality and a great way to get fish into your diet!

This was probably the best fish recipe I have ever tried. I used a can of no salt added, diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, but everything else I followed the recipe. I loved it and my husband (who is Italian) loved it too. Thanks for a great and easy supper.

This was delicious, it's a little too much sauce but that's easy to deal with when plating.  I put it over linguine and it was great.  I softened the onion and garlic in butter then boiled my pasta in any remnants from that pan. I'll definitely cook this again!

Thank you Kristi! I was soo bored with my haddock recipes... I was skeptical at first.  I used Rao's homemade roasted eggplant pasta sauce.. and Ohhh my goodness... my husband gave this a 10 too.. we try a lot of recipes.. and I really felt good about this one... cuz it isn't heavy, but it tastes sooo rich.. like a seafood bisque.  I actually ate mine in a bowl so as not to miss out on any of the sauce... I'm making it again tonight! Thanks Kristi!

I loved this, but did as other reviewers and made changes to the dish, so I cannot give the recipe as written five stars. I wanted to taste the fish, not a heavy sauce, so I used a 14 oz jar of simple Contadina tomato sauce and flavored it with a sprinkling of capers and sauted mushrooms. I also left out the mozzerella- I've tried that combination with fish before and didn't like it. The revised recipe was delicious. Thank you for the inspiration Kristi!

Was very good and simple!  I wasn't sure about not first sauteing the onions to soften them, but I actually really liked the crunchiness of it.  Thought maybe fish should be breaded first, but then no.  Real good  flavor balanced nicely with the fish, and healthy!  Will make again.

I cut down on the sauce because the poster of the recipe said it was a mistake to use too much of it.  Otherwise, I made it according to her new suggestion, and it was perfect.  Absolutely delish!  I really dont eat a lot of meat, so finding fun new recipes for fish is always a treasure for me.  This one is a keeper.  I had to add more fish, because my son eats a lot, lol

No changes from this recipe.  
Suggestion:  needed to cook another 3-5 mins from the 30 total.  Also the onions might taste better if sautéed first.  Served over Fettuccine and it was good.  I’d make it again with the above slight modifications.   Good dish.

It was delicious.  I'm glad I saw the note about using less of the marinara sauce.  Was lighter than I thought it would be too.  Definitely will be making again!

I did add a small can of mushrooms, and subbed a large can of crushed tomatoes (furmano's with garlic, basil and oregano) for the other sauce and stewed tomatoes. I would have given it a 5, however, because the fish, although it seemed to be cooked through, was just lukewarm in the middle. It was strange, because the sauce was bubbling. The onions were also still crunchy as if raw. If I were to do it again, I might raise the heat or add more time.

This is a wonderful recipe. I didn't have haddock, so I used some swai fillets that I had frozen. Swai fillets are thinner, so I adjusted the cooking time. For the pasta sauce, I used Bertolli Rustic Marinara sauce and I only used 1/2 a jar. My family -- including a very picky 9 year old and my mother who usually hates fish -- loved it. The only complaint was from my husband who didn't like the texture of the fish. So, for those of you who don't have haddock on hand, you could substitute with a more substantial fish like orange roughy, but swai isn't ideal. I will definitely be making this again with a different fish!

Loved this recipe.  I made a couple simple changes. First instead of sauce and diced tomatoes, I used my own homemade chunky sauce. Also I grated a little fresh Parmesan cheese on top of the sauce.

I have made this several times now. Used a jar of stewed tomatoes and 1/2  sm can of tomato paste(I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand) ,1/4 cup white wine. I sauted onions, garlic for a few minutes to soften ,then added the  paste,wine ,tomatoes,basil,Italian seasoning  and some capers. Simmered for 10 min  . I like a thicker sauce as opposed to a  runny watery sauce.Place sauce on bottom of glass casserole dish,put 1.1/5 lb of haddock on top ,then topped with more sauce. Baked 20 min,topped with parm, then baked a few minutes more till done. Love this recipe. Its a nice change from breaded fish or creamy versions of fish recipes.

Made this simple recipe for dinner and loved it.  Tasty, easy and quick.  Only change was sprinkling with fresh basil and a little oregano as well as used grated Monterey Jack with jalapeño cheese and a little grated Parmesan.  Delicious with whole grain spaghetti for an easy week-day dinner.  A keeper!

Very tasty result with instant thumbs up from whole family.  I put in about triple the garlic, used 2 lbs of Halibut fillet, one whole onion, and split it across two baking dishes.  With extra fish I did 30 mins + 10 mins.  I put non-dairy cheese on one, and cheddar on the other for the last 10 mins, with extra to sprinkle over the plated dish.  Did a rice pilaf dish and tons of broccoli.
No one complained about crunchy onion :)

I made a few minor adjustments to this recipe - I did what others advised and cooked the onions & garlic first in EVOO - when they were see through I added a can of mushrooms.  I seasoned the, I used cod, very lightly in a rub called Nantucket Off-Shore Rub and then follwed the recipe as advised and added a can of garlic/onions diced tomatos.  Served it over angel hair pasta and it was amazing!  Thanks for the head start!
