I used homemade salsa in this dip and pepperjack cheese only because that was all I had on hand. My husband and kids INHALED this dip. They absolutely loved it. NOTE: I baked my dip for about 20 minutes, maybe a little more.

This was tasty. Simple to make. I served it at a get together with friends. The only thing I would suggest is make sure you leave it in the oven until the cheese is bubbly. I took it out a little too soon and I think it would've been better if I would've left it in longer.

I made this tonight for a get together. It was devoured. I should have doubled the recipe. I used southwest style salsa and only half of the cheese (8oz). It was still really good.Added nacho cheese to the top of a little bit and it makes it even better. I will make it again. Thanks!

I have read this recipe to day and as per my experience the recipe appears to be lovely and yumy. In India I may not get all igredients in packaged form. Can I use fresh ingredients? Can I use other chese then the mexican chese mix?

very quick and very easy - but also very plain. If you need something super fast, this is it! I only used half the cheese, and it formed a pretty thick barrier over the beans and salsa. This is nothing special, but great when you are in a pinch!

This *sounded* good.  My belly isn't usually happy about corn chips but I even got those special (instead of tortilla chips) cause it sounded good together.  It was OK - nothing extra special really.  Although it is simple and I normally would have all ingredients on hand.  I used a mix of cheddar & Jack cheeses cause I usually have those on hand as well.  For a party where there's a million dishes I could see 16 servings, but for a really good like movie snack or something, maybe only half that.  This definitely needs eaten warm - had to nuke it a couple of times. There was some left over after the chips were gone, so I added some refried beans and made a quesadilla out of it.

This is yummy, especially straight out of the oven. I am planning it again for Super Bowl, more likely. I could just keep eating it hot. I followed the directions exactly. I just added some chopped drained jalepenos from a can to the top of it after pulling it from the oven. The jalepenos were a must.

I chose to add some garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and black pepper to the refried beans and used medium salsa for a little extra zing!

This recipe is 5 stars for the ease, and 4 for the taste.  It's not anything super exciting but, is certainly tasty and a winner with kids.  I found out last minute we had to attend a potluck picnic and this was a lifesaver and enjoyed by all.

This was easy to make and just the snack my husband wanted. I used less cheese and stirred everything together so it was evenly distributed. Then heated in the microwave. Fast and easy!

I made this a couple days ago exactly as specified in the recipe. We really liked it. I'm planning on making it again this coming weekend, however, I will use less cheese -- 16 oz was too much (did I really just write that???) and it solidified into a thick mass that broke the chips -- and will bake it for maybe 18-20 minutes instead of 15. I may consider introducing a little sour cream on the side. Still, I recommend it. It's quick, inexpensive, easy and thoroughly awesome.

This was fine - nothing spectacular but a good basic dip for when you need something quick and easy.

This is great! Very easy. My boyfriend who really doesn't like "tex mex" or refried beans couldn't get enough.
