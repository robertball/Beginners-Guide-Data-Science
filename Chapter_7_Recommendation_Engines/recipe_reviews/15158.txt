Hi all!  Thanks for trying my recipe.  Just a few things that the "recipe' people changed from my original recipe: 1) I always use butter not margarine, 2) I always use roasted garlic flavored chicken broth so if you use regular chicken broth try adding a few cloves of minced garlic, and 3) recently I've substituted 1/4 cup of the liquids with 1/4 cup sherry cooking wine.  Of all the recipes I've created, this one is by far my favorite!  Take care!

This is a delicious recipe. I made a few changes to suit what I had on hand: I used 3 stalks celery (not a big celery fan), a small bag of carrots and two onions, all medium chopped and only 1 1/2 cups white rice. As other reviewers mentioned, I replaced 1 1/2 cups water with 1 1/4 cups more broth (I didn't have any boullion) and 1/4 cup sherry. When making the roux, I added 3 tablespoons of store-jarred minced garlic for extra flavor. After simmer, it was a bit too thick, so I ended up adding more milk, using almost a half gallon in the whole recipe. I seasoned with lots of salt, pepper, garlic and poultry seasoning. Rather than poaching the chicken like I normally might, I seasoned a couple of chicken breasts with salt, pepper, Old Bay, garlic and onion and cooked them on a flat top grill in a bit of olive oil. It was a great time saver and added an extra flavor boost. This recipe is definetly a keeper. I look forward to adding other ingredients for different flavors. Great!

I thought this was a pretty good basic recipe for chicken rice soup. Here are my chenges: only 1 C white rice, no water - used all chix broth, added carrots and 2 Tbls. Old Bay toward the end. I also sauteed the veggies in butter/oil first before adding the broth - this gave it a great "cooked all day" taste.
This soup gets very thick, very fast, so be mindful how much flour/milk you are adding. I will make again with these adjustments!

I didn't have time to read the reviews and made this recipe exactly as the recipe states and didn't like it at all.  It had the potential to be good if you were to made adjustments.  Firstly, if you use 2 cups of rice, this will not be a soup it will be a ricey stew, I would cut it to 1 cup of rice.  You need to add your own seasonings as it is very bland as is...I would put 5x the bouillion and garlic in it next time.  Once cup of margarine is crazy, I used 1/2 and that was enough.  I won't make this recipe again as I now have a pot of gloopy rice stew that I am tired of seasoning and reseasoning...now the dog gets it.

A good basic recipe, a few changes make it great. Saute the chicken in olive oil, set aside the chicken, then saute the celery, onion, cut up mushrooms and 2-3 garlic gloves, just until tender. Followed the recipe after that, although I cut back the amount of rice to 1 cup. Added some freshly chopped parsley and a few sprinkles of Old Bay Seasoning a few minutes before serving.  Sprinkled some freshly grated parmesan cheese onto each bowl at time of serving.

AMAZING!! I used alot of the changes people suggested. 1/2 cup of butter, 1/4 cup sherry, 1 cup of rice, a ton of garlic,  4 T of flour, all chicken broth instead of water. I used 1chicken bouillon cube, shallots, carrots & an already roasted chicken from the store. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I have been looking for a soup that's good enough I would pay money for it and I finally found it!  I didn't change too much; instead of simmering the celery, etc. in broth and water, I used 4 cups of water and 4 tsp of chicken base.  I also seasoned with Tony Cachere and some good garlic salt.  It did get a little bit thick so I just prepared another cup of broth and added it before serving.  Went over very well in my house.  Will be making it again!

this was very yummy! turned out more like a casserole even after adding lots of extra water.  Next time I plan on adding only 1 tbs of flour.  I also added carrots and garlic, 1 cup of rice, and more chicken.

With some changes suggested by the review this recipe was fabulous. I reduced rice to 1C, reduced margarine to 1/2 C, skipped the celery, added several cloves of garlic, added probably 5 C of milk.  It was just wonderful.  Keeper!

Good basic recipe. I didn't quite follow the order, but mostly used all the same ingredients. I sauteed garlic, onion, carrots and celery in butter in pan. Removed to bowl. Added whole chicken breasts to pan and cooked in oil. Chopped up. Made the roux in my soup pot, and added crushed rosemary to that. Added 4 cups milk, added chicken and veggies. Cooked until veggies were almost soft. Added one more cup of milk. Added 3/4 cup uncooked white rice (wild would have been better but I didn't have any) and added salt, pepper, pinch of dill and a little extra garlic powder. Simmered for 20 minutes. My family could not stop saying how delicious it was. I know I strayed from the original recipe, but it was my inspiration. :)

This was very good!  I cut the recipe in half and there was still a lot left over!  It did turn out more like a stew than a soup, so if you like it soupier, add more milk.  I happened to enjoy it as a stew.  The only thing I did was use white rice instead of brown as a personal preference and I used all chicken broth versus water.  I also added minced garlic as I am a garlic fanatic!  The only thing I might recommend is adding a vegetable like carrots or brocolli for color.  My rice-phobic 13 year-old stepson even really enjoyed it!  Thanks! It's an awesome recipe!

Delicious!  It is very thick and you can certainly thin it with milk if you like.  Adding garlic, as others suggested, really made it great.  Thanks for a great recipe!

the idea of this recipe is a good one.. i definetly had to make a lot of changes though.. I put brown,white and wild rice in this plus carrots, 5 garlic cloves,...Hint: I saw this somewhere and i always do it... keep garlic cloves in their shell and put in frying pan.. roast till little brown spots all over(couple mins. dont let burn!) and then take off shell and press them on a flat surface... make paste and add them to your Rue.... Had to add a ton of other stuff... Thyme, fresh parsley and simmered 2 bay leaves with rice..definetly only put 4 Tbls of butter and a Tbls of flour...Very good.Thx

This was a very good cream soup.  I added some red bell pepper to add a little color.  I didn't add the extra two cups of milk so it was more like a casserole instead of soup.  Next time I will add more soup.  Diffently a keeper.

After reading a few reviews I made the following changes:  1 cup rice, all chicken brother, 1/2 cup butter, only 4 cups milk, sauteed the veggies with garlic, and cooked for 45 initial minutes.  It was a good basic recipe.  Nice change from chicken noodle soup.

This was the perfect comfort food.  My husband and father-in-law loved it.  Only problem is that there were not enough leftovers.  As with others, I used white rice because that is what I had on hand, and instead of bouillon and water, I just added an additional 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth.  It was thick and fantastic.

I was having a craving for Chicken and Rice Soup. I lived in North Carolina and just recently moved to Washington. We would eat at Logans fairly often and they had one of the best versions of Chicken and Rice Soup. I just HAD to find a recipe to mock theirs. SUCCESS!

This turned out so nice. It was creamy and rich and hit the spot on a night I wasn't feeling well. I threw the leftovers in the freezer for another night and I can't wait.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I added 3 carrots chopped and 3 garlic cloves to recipe.  Start by sauteeing veggies in 1/4 stick of the total butter used (I reduced to 2 sticks) and then add rice (1 1/2 c.) and sweat them a bit in up to 1/2 c. sherry or madeira.  I only used about 5 c. of the milk, and did not use bullion or water - instead used 5 c. chicken stock and at the end, seasoned soup with poultry seasoning, salt and pepper to taste.

This was pretty good. Next time I will skip the flour though, this became so thick I had to double the amount of milk. I added garlic, peas, and carrots and left the salt out.

Made this for the first time today. Couldn't wait 'til it was done to taste. Added more salt and pepper. Also Lemon amd Pepper seasoning salt. Used broth from the cooked chicken. Thinking about adding a bit of shredded cheddar cheese! Next time I may decrease margarine and rice. Really yummy!

I made this tonight and it was YUMMY - however, I only used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 flour, and it was still very rich and creamy.  It ended up being allot thicker than I anticipated. Yummy soup for a cold night.

The family LOVED it! I made one change that I didn't seen any other reviews had: I added the 4 cups of milk and then instead of adding more milk, I added about 2 cups of my homemade chicken broth to it, then it still had rich flavor but without as much of the calories.  I also changed a few things that I saw other reviewers had done, I added 1.5 cups of diced carrots and sauted the veggies in the butter, and I cooked 1 c. white rice in chicken broth. This was excellent and I didn't feel near as guilty when I had a 3rd bowl later in the evening!! Absolutely delicious!

This was good.  My rice didn't cook all the way but that was my fault.  It tasted a lot like Captin Jack's Corn Chowder that I make, just with out the corn.  My kids all ate it so that is always a plus!

Delicious -- even a picky 3 year old enjoyed it.  I did modify it a bit.  I sauteed the onion and celery in butter/olive oil, and added 2tsp of minced garlic.  Then I poured the broth and water into that, added the rice and a bit of dried thyme, and brought to a boil.  Instead of doing the roux, I just added the 4c of milk to the cooked rice mixture and let it simmer for a while.  It thickened up beautifully and was less labor intensive and lower fat.  Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!

This was good, but very thick.  You could actually serve it on a plate!  I will definitely make it again, but I will use more liquid than what the original recipe calls for.  I also added a tablespoon of sugar (hubby loved it)!

This was REALLY yummy!  With one cup of butter how could it not be? LOL!  However, I did substitute  1/2 cup of butter with 1/2 cup of Smart Balance.  I also added carrots and used only water instead of broth.  I cooked the onions, carrots and celery for a few minutes before adding the rice and water.  I then added 3 chicken thighs and let them cook in the water.  I had to add addtl water and ended up only using 4 cups of milk.  I loved it!  Thank you!

This worked out really well. We eat mostly vegan so I sub'd the milk with soy milk (plain flavor), chicken with tofu and everything worked out really well.

Make sure to add fresh garlic or garlic salt and a lot of pepper or else you will have a bland starchy soup.

This was just okay

This was a great soup.  Very tasty and hearty.  The only drawback for me was the lack of color... I know it shouldn't be important so long as it tastes great, but a bit of carrot or peppers as others suggested (I should have read all the reviews) would have helped the appearance.

To save time, I cooked my chicken the night before. I didn't have enough brown rice, so i threw in some basmati rice, which was fine. I also added some grated carrots and a bay leaf before simmering for 1 hour. This was absolutely delicious!!! Makes a large amount, so I froze about half of it. Will be making this one again!

This was a great recipe--so full of flavor!  It wasn't exactly soup like, but my family and I didn't mind.  I don't like whole pieces of onions or celery, so I substitued with onion powder and celery salt, and it was still great and full of flavor.  I made it yesterday, and what was left over has already been eaten!

I did a modification of this which turned out great - pressure cooker!  Combined all in first steps to the pressure cooker for 15 minutes.  While that was cooking, the second steps finished about the same time.  Combined in the the pressure cooker pot and we couldn't stop eating it.  Try it in a bread bowl for an even better meal!

Soup was creamy and flavorful.  I halved the recipe and it still made 4 good sized portions.  I didn't have celery or anything celery like and I think that would have added a nice subtle layer.  
At the very beginning I added some chicken wings and bones I had from last nights roast chicken and left them all the way to the end.  I also added about a half a cup of sauvignon blanc at the very end that I think added a nice touch.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made per the recipe, I thought this was a bit bland and tedious (use 2 different pots for 1 pot of soup?), but second time with some tweaking it was delicious. Second time around I sautéed veggies (and added carrots) in HALF of the butter (I subbed butter for margarine), then added broth & cooked rice. I used white rice because that's what I had. When rice was cooked, in a jar I shook together flour & +- 1/2 cup milk & added to the broth mixture. This needs to come to a boil to remove the "floury" flavor. Then added milk to the proper consistency. Both times I used  canned chicken, as I have a family member with chewing issues who needs absolutely soft chicken. Added 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning, and a little more low sodium chicken bullion cubes to add depth of flavor. Second time around it knocked everyone's socks off!

This has become my go-to comfort food recipe. After making as written and tweaking several times since, my usual modifications are now: 1. Use 1 cup rice. 2. Add 1 1/2 cups diced carrots. 3. Halve the roux. 4. Sub broth for the water/bouillon. 5. Add all of the milk, every time. I also add broth to the leftovers before reheating to make up for liquid absorbed by the rice. Delicious, filling, and works wonders on my sensitive stomach when acid reflux kicks up.

Very thick, I had to add lots of additional broth, chose veggie broth in addition to chicken broth. Added milk & broth each time I reheated. It reminded me so much of Greek lemon soup that I added lemon juice - nice variation, especially if you're a fan of Greek lemon soup.

This is a great, hearty soup! I only gave it four stars because I made some changes. I only used 1 cup of rice and I cooked the rice in 2 cups of chicken stock. I cooked the chicken in a pan with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Then, I drained the fat and used the same pan with a little olive oil and butter to saute the vegetables with a little salt and pepper just until the onions are soft but the celery still has a little bite left in it. Then, I added the rice, chicken, and vegetables all into a large soup pot together. I added in some chicken stock and milk. (Probably about 6-8 cups of liquid all together) I made the roux in the same pan that I had cooked the chicken and veggies. I only used 1/2 a cup of butter and 1/2 a cup of flour. I added a few cups of milk to this and cooked until thick. Then, I added the roux into the soup pot, stirred in some minced garlic and some herbs and seasonings and simmered it for about 30 - 45 minutes and then added a little more milk towards the end to get the right thickness. It turned out delicious! Very flavorful and just the right consistency. I will definitely make this again.

This is such a good comfort food for the 18 degree weather we are experiencing!  I read all the reviews, and made the following adjustments: This is for half a recipe. I first sauted then cut up chicken in about 2 T olive oil with some bottled chopped garlic, and seasoned it with salt, pepper, some red pepper flakes, and a shake or two of Creole seasoning I removed the chicken and used the remainling oil to saute  about 1 1/2C each chopped onion and carrots ( I use a Mandolin dicer) .  I cut the amt. of rice in half, ie.1/2C and here's a hint.  Brown rice takes forever to get tender!  It took extra liquid to get it soft and fluffy.  I used only about 3T of flour in a half stick of butter, and cooked it slowly until it had browned a bit.  I thought it made a nice amount of soup, but 4 of us (3 men, 1 woman) cleaned it up!

As a starting point, this recipe was good - with my alterations it was great and my husband RAVED about it.  Instead of celery, I used carrots.  I omitted the bouillon (simply bc I didn't have any).  I only used 1/2c. butter and 1/2c. whole wheat flour with 4 c. skim milk.  While that was thickening, I added thyme, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste to the rice mixture.  IT WAS AWESOME!  And just for more texture, I added 1/2 bag of frozen corn at the very end.  Yummy!

This was a wonderful dinner with a loaf of warm fresh bread.  Next time I will add carrots and saute the veggies before adding the liquids.  I added poultry seasoning but I think garlic is needed also.  I only used 4 cups of milk because I like my soup thick.  Yum!

This soup is very thick and filling.  I think I used almost a whole gallon of milk!  It was very good though.  I didnt have any celery on hand so I used small diced carrot for an extra veggie.  I also used regular long grain rice because I didnt have brown rice.  My kids loved this!  I think this recipe feeds more than 8 people.  More like 10-12.

This was SOOO good. I simmered some carrots in the broth and already had some leftover rice I threw in at the end of the recipe. Those were my only changes.. This was very good thick stew.  The only time it could get too thick is during the reheating/leftover period. But still, just add milk and its just as good or better as leftovers!

As the comments said, it's REALLY thick and very milky, so it may have been better to cut the roux in half and use more chicken broth instead of milk.  It also has no flavor.  I added a couple cloves of garlic, but just didn't seem to have enough taste.  So I added some thyme and that seemed to work.  This recipe makes enough for a small army, so I would suggest making half when you are first trying it.

This was really good. I did make a few changes to add some flavor as some reviews had suggested. I cut the rice in half and replaced the water with chicken broth. I also added 1 cup finely chopped mushrooms and 1 clove garlic to onion and sauted then added rice and broth as well as 1 cup finely chopped carrot. Then followed the recipe from there.

This was fabulous.  I read the review from Heidi's sister-in-law and there were a few errors in her ingredients. SHe said to use only 1/2 cup of rice not 2 cups.I did alter the ingredients somewhat to make enough for leftovers.  I certainly will make this again.

I was happy to find this recipe, especially since I hate the wild rice versions. I did have to keep adding seasonings and it never was just right but overall I would make this again with some adjustments. I did add 1 cup of chopped carrott which I will increase to 1 1/2 - 2 C next time along with the celery and onion.

This was very good!  I used garlic flavored chicken broth, as well as adding a little extra garlic for more flavor.  Used only 1/2 c rice as suggested - great way to use up leftover chicken!

Yum!  My family loved this soup.  It was very thick, as it says, and I had to keep adding milk and then water.  I added carrots also.

I added all the milk and it was thick like chicken and dumplings, so I added some dumplings and lots of salt and pepper. The results were a chicken and dumpling with rice. I also added 1 1/4 cup of chopped carrots. VERY GOOD.

Yum, yum, yum!!!!  I followed this pretty much to the 'T' except: I used white rice instead of brown, added shredded carrots, and used some precooked, frozen Sweet Chili chicken breasts. I also did not add additional milk; I left it thick and we ate it more as a casserole type dish instead of a soup. Makes a ton; I will definitely half this one next time!!  Thanks Heidi!!

Wonderful recipie when you have chicken left overs, a little bland so I added garlic and vegeta (a wonderful croation spice sold at regular markets). I chopped the chicken and onions very fine and added carrots. I also used skim milk and added one cup of half/half.
Yummy!

This was super thick, too much for me.  Maybe cut down on the flour.  Also, thought it was pretty bland, and I even added carrots, mushrooms, and sherry.  Was disappointed after all the great reviews, maybe I did something wrong, I do have a 1 yearold and a 2 yearold that make following instructions difficult at times!

This soup was so wonderful I made it the first time as written and again as chicken noodle soup, the second time I added egg noodles at the beginning of the simmering time.  I used 4 chicken bouillon cubes and added carrots. I cook the chicken using the Spicy Rapid Roast chicken recipe also posted on this site.  Served this on a cold rainy night the whole picky family ate it up. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty recipe, but if you are watching what you eat, this has a little too much butter then I like.  Maybe using olive oil as a substitute.  Otherwise, my husband and I thought that it was a good meal.  He compared it to chicken ala king.  Think that it would taste good over toast.  Might add carrots next time.

Delicious!  I cut the butter to 1/2 cup, the flour to 1/3 cup, and the milk to 4 cups. I added chopped carrots and crushed garlic. It turned out perfect. My whole family LOVED it.  Will make again and again.

This was excellent! I used egg noodles instead of rice and a bit of cooking  wine. I plan to make another pot today for my 89 year old father. Thanks for this great recipe.

I wanted to love this, but unfortunately I didn’t.  Three others in our family did though. They are glad I have leftovers. I took everyone’s advice on adding other things to make it better but it still was too bland for me. Sorry :(

What I did differently , i didnt boil the onions with the broth I actually sauteed the onions with a little bit of garlic in real butter. I didn't use any water just replaced it with more broth as someone suggested.  I added carrots!

The additional milk was a must when I prepared this recipe.  4 cups of milk was insufficient; the consistency at that level was much too thick.  I added the 5th cup of milk , but it only thinned it out marginally.

I also thought the recipe needed seasoning, so I added 4 tsp. of refrigerated minced garlic, and 2 tsp. of rosemary that I ground in the herb (coffee) grinder.

I like to make a recipe as written the first time. I’m so sorry I didn’t read the comments first. This came out the consistency of very thick  oatmeal, even after I added two more cans of broth. I would definitely have halved the amount of rice if I had know. That said, it’s very tasty and is like a casserole more than a soup. But I’m only giving three stars because the basic recipe doesn’t come out as soup and all the comments make significant changes to the proportions.

This recipe is a go to in my family. I've been making it for almost 5 years now, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon.
My family like our soup with a bit more substance so my changes were:
- Add carrot (about 1/2 - 1c.) and 1 minced garlic clove
- Saute carrots, garlic, and celery before adding rice and broth.
- Substitue water and chicken bouillon with 1 can of chicken broth (1 3/4 c.)
- Cut brown rice down to a little over 1 c.
- Saute the onion in the butter
- Cut butter down to 1/2 c.
- Cut flour down to 1/3 c.
- Saute chicken in olive oil and season with black pepper, salt, and garlic seasoning.
- Once everything is combined, add poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper.

For best results let this soup sit for longer than an hour, it deffinitly helps enhance the flavor.

This was really good and creamy! I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of a whole cup, but stirred in 1/2 cup of grated parmesan at the end. I also used jasmine rice instead of brown, and seasoned with 1/2 tsp of seasoning salt. This is a good "stick to your ribs" recipe, and I will make it again.

This is a great dish.  I dropped the celery, and added 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I was going to add one mushrooms but only had three left in the ice box.  Next time though I will get some more.

The flavour was good, but it was way to thick, I had to keep adding more water and milk, I think I would add more chicken stock and only 1 cup of rice next time, I also sautéed the onions and celery first in olive oil them added other ingredients, when the rice was cooked it was full of rice and no liquid so I added more water and boulin powder, after putting in the rue I still needed to add more milk and water, I had to switch pots to a bigger one, I needed up having to add 8 cups of milk, and kept seasoning it with salt and pepper to taste, I should have read all the reviews before starting this recipe, all in all when I added my agustments it was good and now I have enough soup for the whole week.

This had an amazing flavor, but it was WAY too thick, even cutting the roux in half. I used butter instead of margarine, because I REALLY don't like to cook with margarine. I went to culinary school, and they drilled into us that it was horrible to cook with. But next time, I'll cut that in half, or quarter it, so it will be a lot less thick. My husband is still talking about it, and asking for it again, many months later, so it was extraordinarily good, that was the only problem.

This is a good recipe but I did make some changes. That's why I only gave it 4 stars.  I used all low sodium chicken broth and no water. I added roasted garlic and shredded carrots. I only used about 1/2 C. butter to saute' the vegetables. You don't need anymore than that. It would otherwise be a greasy waste. I used salt, pepper, roasted garlic, onion and a little lemon and baked the chicken breasts. They turned out very tasty just by themselves. My family usually drinks skim milk but I bought a gallon of whole to make this so it would be richer. Well, my kids started using it in their cereal and then for chocolate milk. So I didn't have enough.....darn kids!!! But I did have some heavy cream. I used the whole milk, some of the skim and heavy cream to equal 4 Cups. It was a little bit thick so I added some more skim. I only used 1 Cup of rice too. I always add more chicken for the protein. It was a thick soup, not quite a casserole like others said it was. My family loved it. I'll be making it again. Thanks!

I halved the recipe as there are only two people in my house, and only had a little more than 3/4 cup brown rice so I added enough white rice to make 1 cup.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor is fabulous.  Exactly what I had in mind when I read the recipe.  The only issue I had was that my rice didn't cook all the way, but I think I turned the heat too low when I was simmering.  I added some water to thin it a bit so it wouldn't burn, and then I turned the heat up to finish cooking the rice.  A delicious comfort food recipe for a cold night!

Excellent, made some changes, by reading thru reviews took advice from others and then added my own items.
Used 1 C rice, and used about twice as much broth as what is called for making it a creamy soup vs it being too thick. I also used 1/4 C sherry and lots of garlic. When I made the Rue, I used the 1/2 C margarine and 4 T flour and 3 C milk. My family all loved it. Thanks for a great soup!

I have this simmering right now and it taste awesome! Wish I had added in some diced carrots to give it some color. The 4 cups of milk is just perfect I think, not thin at all and not super thick, it's a nice filling soup, serving it with some fresh made cornbread and zucchini bread for afterwards yum!

This is a good base recipe, but I agree with many of the other negative reviews.  It needs only half the rice and half the roux.  I also had to add a ton more chicken granules, lots of extra broth, extra milk, and garlic salt.  I do still prefer this base to many of the other options because of its simplicity.  It just needs tweaking.

Delicious!  Like most, I altered it a bit, both due to comments and because...well, my pantry needs restocking! ;)  Sounds like a lot, but I think overall flavor not altered much except more seasoning.  Flavor was amazing and would not have changed this much if I had everything on hand.  For example, I had no fresh celery, so I threw in a small  handful of celery seed...no problem, tastes great!  Had no Cream of Chicken Soup...so MADE MY OWN from recipes readily available online (this likely made it better!). Used about 1/3 c. butter only, but again soup was so yummy, so this didn't hurt and saved some fat and calories.  Use MORE CHICKEN BOUILLON than called for, only 1 c. brown rice, and ALL SIX CUPS MILK!  And substituted my fresh chicken's broth for the water.  This is the most amazing stuff ever!  thanks!

Yum! Great soup. I made a small change. I used less roux, only 4.5 tbs flour and butter and maybe a cup of half and half and a few cups water. I didn't want it overly thick. I sauteed onions, carrots, celery in butter before adding water and bouillon (Better than Bouillon brand). I cooked white rice separate and added to the soup with chicken and roux. I poached my chicken in a separate pot as they were still slightly frozen.

Great soup on a cold day!

This was really good. I only gave it 4 stars for not following the whole recipe. I'm not into creamy soups (too much fat), so I used water to make the roux. It came out really well. I did 2 cups brown rice (it's a lot, but we love rice), chicken that I first browned in olive oil, onion, garlic, carrots, peas, and corn (per my son's request). I added lots of spices and it was really good.

It simmering now and looks good.  But, I agree that backing off on the rice or adding more broth/water works better at altitude/dry climates.  The roux turned out good, but that is a boat load of butter (1 cup).  Suggest backing them both down.

I really enjoyed this dish. I put a whole, cut up chicken in my pressure cooker and then pulled the chicken off the bones. I used the broth as part of the broth the recipe calls for.  I also added some carrots. I used two cups of brown rice. Brown rice takes longer to cook and it absorbed a lot of liquid. Mine turned out more like a stew or casserole but I'm sure if I added more milk or broth it would have become more soup-like. A very hearty meal with some warm bread.  We had a lot of leftovers but I put some in the freezer for a quick meal this winter.

My family loved this! I did make the following changes though. I doubled the amount of celery and onions and added 4 cups of sliced white mushrooms and 4 or 5 sliced garlic cloves. I sauteed the veggies in some olive oil before adding the broth (and used all broth and no water and skipped the bouillon). I also seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, ground black pepper, onion salt and garlic powder and sauteed it in olive oil (using about 4 1/2 cups of chicken rather than 3). I also added 4 chopped cloves of garlic to the roux as well as some ground black pepper. I did stick with the 2 cups of brown rice and did not add the 2 remaining cups of milk. It does turn out very thick, but it is hearty and delicious!!

Great recipe and very simple.  I made some small changes; used butter instead of margerine and only a 1/2 cup and 1/2 of the flour.  I also added some poultry seasoning, garlic & parsley as well as some carrot and broccoli.

Great recipe. Never made a cream soup before and this was a great start.  Added garlic and onion powder for more flavor, but otherwise very filling and delish. The kids loved it. Great winter meal.

This was best soup ever.  I made with turkey instead of chicken (was Thanksgiving).  I used left over turkey broth instead of bullion and threw in a little extra gravy left over into final pot.  This was great soup.  Next time I will add sauted mushrooms and possibly shredded carrots, just for color.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have any bouillon cubes on hand so I used tumeric and curry - spices that are flavorful and good for you. I also did not use celery. I cooked chopped onion, carrots and garlic in olive oil before the first step.

Yum!  Just made this tonight and I cut the recipe in half.  Mine ended up thick and rather than add more milk than the recipe called for (even by half) I left it and we ate it with cornbread.  I can see myself making this again and again, maybe adding a veggie or using boned chicken.  Thank you!

Excellent! Left overs didn't last 1/2 a day in my house.  My family rated it an 11 out of 10!  The only personal touches I made was I used white long grain rice, added about a 1/4 cup of lemon juice and a couple dashes of tyme and a bit more milk to thin just a bit.  Thanks for sharing.

This was really fantastic! I love the texture of the brown rice. I did add carrots and three cloves of garlic and I let them sweat together in the pot in some olive oil for a few minuets before adding the chicken broth. (I did not use the bouillon and instead used a 32 oz box of chicken broth instead.) I also cooked my chicken in two more cloves of garlic, parsley, salt, pepper and butter. The trick with this soup in definitely in the roux...  I used much less flour (about 1/8 of a cup) and added the milk very slowly... it will eventually thin out if you are patient. we will be eating this again for sure!

This was so good!! I didnt use chicken broth from a can, I used fresh chicken broth so its not as salty. Ialso used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I put some ritz crackers in the bowl before I served it and it tasted like chicken pot pie.

I cut this recipe in half, used 1 1/2 C precooked wild rice, deleted the water, used 1 c skim milk, finished with cream, salt and pepper. The wild rice kicked up the flavor quite a bit, and other than pre-cooking the rice was pretty easy. Also, I only used 2 TBS of flour for the roux and it was plenty thick.

Delicious! I prefer a richer soup so I subbed 1 1/2c cream for the milk. I also used sherry & garlic.  Thanks for a great soup to warm up on this cold October evening.

This is a really good base soup.  However, I'll agree with some of the other reviewers in saying that it sincerely needs spices added to it or it is BLAND.  Cook the chicken in garlic, pepper and seasonsed salt in butter.  Add spices to the rice mixture as its cooking.  Add pepper and salt to the rue.  If you do all that, when you put it together it should taste WONDERFUL.  I'm not exactly sure why everyone is saying this recipe is too thick though...its a creamy soup...its supposed to be a little thicker than a normal soup.  I had no problems whatsoever with it being so thick you could put it on a plate!  Great recipe with a few alterations.

This is fairly good and can be accommodating to adjustments.  I only had a little over a cup of butter on hand, so I supplemented with heart-healthy margarine.  I also added about 3/4 cup carrot diced small to add color.  Only had a cup of brown rice, so supplemented with white.  Used skim milk because this is all we have on hand.  Still good!

I had a hard time reviewing this recipe. I liked the "soup" I thought it had a good taste after seasoning, but it was not soup at all! I added a whole 36oz of chicken broth and it was still so thick! Next time I will use less rice and do as another reviewer said and only use 1 tbsp of flour. This could have been served as a side dish, but not soup.

Made this for our family Christmas get together. Made pretty much as directed except only used 1 cup white rice, added garlic and carrots and added A LOT of seasonings.  I roasted my chicken in the oven after marinading in an herb mixture and that added to the flavor of the soup somewhat.  I would definitely make this again due the creaminess - real comfort food.  But I need to work on the seasoning to get the flavor I want.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this, and even made adjustments to lighten it up.  I used half the amount of butter and 1% milk.  It still ended up being very rich.  I used half the amount of rice.  I also only simmered it for 15 minutes instead of an hour, and thought it was fine.  I recommend seasoning the chicken well before cooking it...I used salt, pepper, and thyme.

Yummy!  I used a packet of Lipton long grain and wild rice with seasonings for the rice - the soup was delicious!

Very very delicious! We added a bit more milk to make it a little less thick. It hit the spot on a cold day. I passed this recipe on to all my friends! I especially love that the ingredients are things you already have in the fridge or pantry!
