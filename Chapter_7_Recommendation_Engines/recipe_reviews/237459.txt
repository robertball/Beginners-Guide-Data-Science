I'm sure the recipe is great but when I made it the chicken did not absorb ANY flavor so it was flavorless chicken on salad greens = boring.

Great easy recipe.  I know I should not rate a recipe when I don't exactly follow it, so sorry.  I actually just used some taco seasoning instead of combining all of the spices listed.  Dish turned out great.

I have to give this 5 STARS even tho I only made the chicken part of it.  Everyone in the family loved it.  We will make this again and again.  Just the right amount of heat and spice.  Made as directed in this recipe, it turns out very moist.  My husband and I ate it on lettuce with tomato, avocado, jalapeno, cheese.  I had French dressing and taco sauce on my salad and he put Caesar on his.  Our son, age 12, at the chicken on heated up tortillas.  Everyone was extremely happy and said this was one of the best meals we have had EVER.

I made this Paleo style, so no cheese and no tostada shells :)  Also made my own Paleo friendly ranch.  My husband could not stop raving about the chicken rub!  He said he could eat it everyday!  Thank you so much for sharing a fantastic salad recipe!
