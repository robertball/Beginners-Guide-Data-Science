I changed the cheese to cheddar and added 3T diced onion and 1/2t minced garlic 1t salt omited the egg and cooked all the ingredients in a skillet. I had fresh cherry peppers that needed to be used so I stuffed mixture into the peppers and baked in oven on 350 for approx 15 min or until peppers were soft. My husband loved them!

I made this recipe for a large birthday party and everyone was floored by the zingy tasty flavor and at how unique this dish is. Small children may not care for it but everyone else will simply love these little yummies! I always stuff my mushrooms with this same recipe. Wonderful!

I stuff cherry peppers for appy's quite often and for those who were bothered by the heat I use sweet cherry peppers in the jar. This way if you want it a little spicier you can add it into the stuffing. When purchasing your peppers look for the jars that contain more of the red peppers as they're even tastier than the green. Happy cooking!

Living in Texas we love "hot" food but I have to agree this recipe is missing something. Made for a party and people ate them but no-one raved about them and no-one went back for seconds.

I added garlic onions and additional parmesan and I still thought this didn't taste good...the sourness of the cherry peppers was very overpowering.

These are demanded for every family gathering. I use all sausage (no ground beef) and add black pepper. The jarred peppers tend to be mushy so I ger the marinated ones from the olive bar at the grocery store. I like to garnish with fresh parsley.
