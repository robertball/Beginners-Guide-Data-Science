I made this and gave as gifts.. but only on the second try... as much as it was flavorful. the first try turned out gummy. It is a little tricky to get it to the right consistancy, but I thought it was worth the effort. The first batch I used to cook with... it was tasty, but the texture was not so good. The second batch turned out great, and I got good feedback from my friends and neighbors.

overcooked, that's why it is slimy.
