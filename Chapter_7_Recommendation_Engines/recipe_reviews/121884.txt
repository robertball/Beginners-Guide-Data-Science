I wasn't happy with this dough at all while I was making it.  It seemed saturated with oil.  I chilled the dough awhile but that didn't seem to help and even as I scooped it onto the cookie sheets I expected the cookies to be a complete and greasy disaster.  But as the first reviewer of this recipe I thought as long as I came this far I'd follow through, then give this recipe my honest review and rating, good or bad.  SO glad I hung in there! These are one of the better cookies I've made in awhile!  I wouldn't sub or change or add or omit ANYTHING in this recipe for fear I'd change how good they are, made just as the recipe dictates, complex as it is with its unusual variety of ingredients.  When I noticed the oil and cream of tartar I knew to expect a light and sandy textured cookie, which I love. The oatmeal adds a rustic, chewy contrast in texture while the potato chips make these delightfully but delicately sweet/salty.  To my surprise they held their shape, and didn't spread out flat as I half expected they would.  They are not a hefty or sturdy cookie and crumble somewhat easily - very similar to the commerical Pecan Sandie cookies.  A very surprising reward for what I expected  would be a real disappointment!  Loved your cousin's recipe Stephanie!

I am known for my cookies and I have to tell you these will now be my signature cookies. I doubled the vanilla extract and subbed King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour for half of the all purpose flour.  I bake cookies, eat one, and then give the rest away.  I am sending half of these to work with my husband but the other half will have to be ripped out of my hands.  Delicious, unique cookies!

We love this cookie. DH likes them chewy and I like crisp (baked longer for crispy), eitherway this cookie is a winner! UPDATE: These are a little sweet for us, so next time I will cut the sugar some. I froze most of the dough into balls, and have since made a batch. I took the dough balls out of the freezer and put them on a cookie sheet, then I turned the oven on to preheat. I did bake them 1-2 min. longer but they turned out great, and the chips were still crunchy! Thanks for posting Stephanie :)

These were disappointing just because the reviews were so high. They were okay, nothing special.

Okay, this is an amazing recipe. I did tweak just a tid bit though. I left out the milk and vinegar. I didn't have the oats, so I sub'd with Rice Krispies. I also used 1/2 bag of chocolate chips and 1/2 bag of Reese's Mini's (that's all I had!) ANYWAYS, they turned out amazing! I'm so glad to have found this recipe - i'm going to double it for a cookie exchange :)
