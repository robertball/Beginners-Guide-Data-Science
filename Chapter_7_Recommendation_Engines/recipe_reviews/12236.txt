This is the exact recipe my family has used for generations. The only thing we do differently is to use a gingersnap crust, instead of a regular pie crust. To make gingersnap crust, make like you would any other cookie crust. Smush up 22 cookies until they are very fine, and add 1/2 stick melted butter- the consistancy should be like wet sand. Push in bottom and up sides of pie pan and bake at 350 for 5 or so minutes with pie weights, or other way to keep the crust flat.

My family has been making this recipe for three generations at Christmas and Thanksgiving.  VERY GOOD recipe.  Make sure when cooking over double boiler, that you let all of the water cook out.  My mom uses a paper towel to absorb some of the water.  It helps to keep the crust from becoming soggy.  THIS is the ONLY recipe for pumpkin pie that we have ever used.

A small difference in my recipe is the cooking  directions.  They are...
Beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar (add gradually) until thick. Add pumpkin, milk, salt and spices.  Cook in double boiler until real thick.  COOL. Add gelatine stiffened in cold water (stir until gelatine dissolves. Add egg whites with remaining 1/2 cup sugar (merangue) Fold into pumpkin mixture. Pour mixture into cooled baked shell and chill. If desired, top with sweetened, whipped cream.

Very good.  Give it a try.  Might take a few times (practice) to get it right, but don't give up because this is the Best when done right.

This pie was a big hit at Thanksgiving.  My family isn't big on traditional pumpkin pie, but they LOVED LOVED this pie.  It was light and smooth.

People who don't like pumpkin pie will like this. Delicious. The first time I made it, it looked bizarre and I almost threw it out - but the next day it looked fine and tasted delicious! Every time I have made it since then, it has looked normal...not sure what happened that first time.

My great-aunt has made this pie for our Thanksgiving lunch every year since long before I was even born. I don't like regular pumpkin pie, but this one is different--so light and fluffy. Plus she makes an impossibly thin, light crust that complements it amazingly (I don't know how she does it). The ginger snap crust another reviewer mentioned sounds delicious as well!

Perhaps I did something wrong, but having made chiffon pies numerous times in the past, I cannot see what could have happened.  I made this exactly as written, yet the pumpkin flavor was far too mild, and all we could taste was the gelatin.  We actually threw the whole pie out after a few unhappy bites.  I really wanted to like this, so if it's better the second go around, I will definitely update my review!

Fluffy and smooth consistency.  Nice flavor.  Made this twice so far, once with ginger snap crust and once with pastry pie crust.  Either way, very good.

Really good, not exactly what I expected.  But like I said it was good.  It was a milder, sweeter version of a pumpkin pie.  The texture was light and creamy.  I would have liked a little more filling, as it filled up a little low, next time I will try to use a smaller pie tin.  I just boiled water in a large pan and cooked the egg yolk in a smaller pan on top of it and it turned out great.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a nice variation for pumpkin pie, lots of light airy flavor and texture.  My family is still going to stick with traditional, but this was very good.

Its a really easy and not overly time consuming recipe to make.  The only thing is, you'll need to add about 3 times as much spice for a good, full flavor.  I just smell the mixture after every little I add until I'm happy with the smell.  Oh and it really does behoove you to add the egg whites to the pumpkin mixture rather than the other way around.  You'll have to whisk it to get rid of the lumps!

Deeeeeeee-licious recipe! The only change made was that I used only 1/4 currently sugar while beating the egg whites, tasting as I added it. I don't enjoy overly sweet desserts and this smaller amount still tastes perfectly sweet to me!  Thanks for sharing!?? Easy to make, too!

Made it just as written and it was perfect.  Nice and light with a good spice tone.  I then made it a second time, altering it so that it wouldn't have the raw egg whites.  I took the 1/2 sugar that goes into the egg whites and put it in a small pot with 2Tbsp water.  I then boiled it until it reached soft ball stage and then, while beating the egg whites, it drizzled the sugar into the egg whites.  The super hot sugar mixture cooks the egg white while it beats together.  Beat until cool and then fold in the pumpkin.  It changes the texture slightly (a bit puffier) but it avoids having to warn people regarding the food safety aspect of the raw eggs.

This is a traditional pumpkin chiffon pie, but the instructions are lacking.  Its a little bland, I prefer to use 2-2 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon ginger and nutmeg.  Or you could double the cinnamon and add a bit of allspice.  Also, this recipe could benefit from a decrease in sugar.  I use 1/2 cup brown sugar in the pumpkin filling and 1/4 cup sugar beaten with the egg whites.  You have to cool the pumpkin mixture before adding the beaten egg whites or you will have a mess.  After you fold in the egg whites, it has to refrigerate for several hours.  It's best to make this the day before, since it is fairly time consuming.  Good luck... it's worth the effort in the end!
