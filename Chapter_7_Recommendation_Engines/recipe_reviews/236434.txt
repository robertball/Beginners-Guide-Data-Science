Loved this dressing! I did omit the optional salt b/c I didn't think it needed it. Also, I reserved the oil from the anchovies and added a bit to the dressing to thin out, so it would blend smoothly. Great flavor and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I have never made Caesar dressing before, nor had I ever purchased anchovies - hah! I did both today, and was happy that I did. This dressing is so much better than store bought Caesar dressing, and it's very easy to make. I did leave out the jalapeno pepper, because I didn't have any on hand. Delicious dressing Father Mark, even without the jalapeno!

OUTSTANDING Caesar dressing!!  I doubled this for a party-sized Caesar salad, following the recipe, other than omitting the salt (it was plenty salty w/the parm and anchovies).  I used all of the oil from the anchovies, as well as the EVOO to thin it out a bit (and it was still nice and creamy).  This came together in minutes in our blender and I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers, soon.  THANKS for the recipe, Father Mark!

WOW! Amazing! Followed everything, except for the anchovies because I didn't have them on hand. I used several splashes of Worcestershire Sauce (it has anchovies in it) and it was /is GREAT! I used this dressing for the "The Best Parmesan Chicken Bake" by Chef John also on here. 
Thanks for sharing Father Mark! Now I'm going to rate his recipe and spread the word about your amazing recipe!

Used in our café, looking for a more traditional Caesar so eliminated jalapenos and cut down on the anchovies due to not all customers are anchovy lovers, trying to make more palatable for a crowd. To cut down on work, use anchovy paste, much easier to use. Did not add salt.  Anchovy is nearly a salt itself, none needed.

I was worried (or I should say others in house were) of using all the anchovies, but it was really good!  I did not blend as I didn't want to clean blender, and garlic cloves I used were large & strong but we love garlic so we liked it!

This was fantastic! My husband loves Caesar dressing, but store-bought is riddled with all kinds of things you can't pronounce. So I decided to give this a try. It was easy and REALLY good. My husband talked about this dressing for days afterward. Seriously, days.

Love, love this dressing. It is my favorite. I put a very large jalapeno, with out the seeds for more flavor. It is as good as any fine restaurant dressing I have ever eaten.

I made this exactly as directed, for a dinner party. Was a little concerned because I'm not a big anchovies fan; so I made a second "back-up" homemade ranch dressing just in case. I needn't have worried...the dressing was such a hit no one went for the back-up! I will definitely make it again.  The jalapeños gave it just the perfect "kick."

This salad dressing is amazing.  I doubled the recipe for a large group but kept the amount of anchovies at 2 ounces.  I let it sit overnight and took it out of the fridge about an hour before serving so the consistency loosened up a little.  Everyone kept saying how delicious it was. Even two days later, it's still fabulous.  I will never make Caesar salad again without using this recipe.  I'll even keep the dreaded anchovies on-hand just to make it. :)

Wonderful. I also held back on the salt because of the saltiness of the cheese and anchovies. I seeded my jalapeno and loved the flavor. I will never buy bottled dressing again.

this recipe is great! i only give it four stars because it is a little on the fishy side with how much anchovies it calls for. Also, id put slightly less garlic in the mixture as one of my guests said it was a little overbearing. However, we loved it, and i did too!

We tried another recipe but this one beats it. I only uses 3 anchovy filets and 1/2 the garlic, it was more to our taste. also added a little mik so it would pour. I make caesar salad by making my salas in a bowl with a cover so I can add the dressing, cover, then shake to coat the lettuce.

I made it as shown, except I used canned sardines in olive oil instead of anchovies, since it’s what I had. Bonus: sardines were skinned and deboned, which made this easier for me to deal with - less “ewww” factor for me. The dressing has a good garlicy zip to it that I love about caesars. Will make this again! Much better than the bland, store bought varieties. Letting it sit a few hours to overnight definitely brings out the flavors.

Absolutely delicious!! I made it exactly as written...definitely let it sit at least a day to let the flavors set in and it will blow your mind if you love a TRUE Caesar dressing. I will make this again and again!

This is a very flavorful dressing. I made it as written except I used anchovy paste because that's what I had on hand, and I subbed a few dashes of cayenne for the jalapeno. My guests and family raved; will make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is EXACTLY the Caesar dressing I was hoping to make. Full of garlicky savory flavor, love the anchovy and how creamy and rich it was. I did omit the jalapeño because I didn’t have it and didn’t really want that flavor anyway. I can’t wait to make it again. A crisp salad with this dressing and some homemade croutons is perfection!

Pretty good. Next time I'd omit the salt, to see how it tastes first. The oil and cheese add a saltiness already. I diluted some with water/olive oil to make it less salty.

great recipe, a little to much anchovy for my taste, I'd half the amount or use a paste to regulate the amount. Also i'll add more garlic, i like it hot. I'm trying to emulate a cesar dressing served at J.B.'s resturant in Ainsworth B.C. Canada.

this was SUPER delicious.. we used the oil the anchovies were packed in for the additional olive oil and left the seeds/vein in the jalapeno.. we enjoyed this with some bok choy for a quick caesar salad style coleslaw.. we used the dressing right away and devoured the coleslaw almost as quickly.. i'm curious how much better this could be if we would allow it to sit.. maybe next time.. ty so much for the recipe!

First time making Caesar dressing, and I love it!! I had no anchovy paste, so I used Worcestershire sauce instead! Didn't bother blending because I chopped the Jalapeno super fine. Definetly reccomend as an easy, homemade Caesar dressing!

Number 1 husband-pleaser!  Like others, I omit the salt.  I reduce the lemon to 2 T.  I empty the entire can of anchovies - including the oil into the blender.  Perfect consistency!  Dressing improves over time - but best to use 1 - 5 days after making.  Enjoy!

Excellent dressing! I'm glad I used my own judgment and did not add salt to this. It was plenty salty already, between the cheese and anchovies (I used paste). Thanks - a definite keeper!

This is a perfect dressing! Be careful not to add more garlic than it calls for. The recipe is perfect the way it is!

Flavor turned out fantastic with the anchovies, but next time will use less garlic.

I love this dressing.  I didn't add the anchovies because I didn't have any but the taste was still wonderful.

My husband loves Caesar salad and thought this was the best. Paired with the "Best Croutons Ever" recipe from all recipes.com, it was fantastic.

I halved the recipe and left out the anchovies (didn't have them) and the jalapeños (didn't want the heat). I used one giant clove of garlic and it was almost too garlicky, even for this garlic lover. It's delicious as a salad dressing or as a dip.  I've used this recipe before (with the anchovies) and it's always a winner... even if you need a mint after!

I've been making this dressing for over a year now and my wife and son both love it. The jalapeno with the anchovies provides the right kick to make this really stand out. If you do not like really flavorful Caesar dressing, look elsewhere, the flavor of this dressing is thrilling!!

Great dressing- I love garlic and use it very often in the kitchen, but, I cut the garlic down to 3 cloves and it was still much, much too overpowering. Next time, I will add 1 clove at a time and keep tasting after each to make sure that it doesn't happen again. Other than that, it would have got 5 stars from me. Side note to keep in mind: a little of this dressing goes a long way.

This dressing is delicious I have made it two times. Because I thought it had a little too much garlic (even though I am a garlic lover) I cut back on the garlic the second time and liked it better. My husband thought it was too thick. Next time I will try some of the other suggestions to make it thinner like using all of the oil from the anchovies and EVOO or lemon if needed. Thank you for this terrific recipe.

Good recipe. It is a little fishy and cheesy, so I added more lemon juice and about 4 heavy splashes of red wine vinegar. It gave it more zing, and evened out the cheesiness and fishiness.

Good stuff.  A little thick, but would make again.  This is a garlic lovers Caesar dressing, stands up very good with grilled shrimp or grilled chicken.  Next time I might thin down with a bit of heavy cream.  Used 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce in sub for anchovies because little market had no chovies.  Use GOOD parmesan cheese not the kind from the can.

I too omitted the the salt as the anchovies have plenty of their own and we LOVED IT!  It tastes like a very traditional Caesar Dressing with a zing.  I served it at a gathering in my home and others asked me for the recipe.  Also, if you don't have a food processor a hand blender or table top blender works fine.

Good dressing!  Omitted the jalapeño as I am the only "heat lover" in the family.  Liked the more pungent garlic and anchovy flavors you get in this recipe.
