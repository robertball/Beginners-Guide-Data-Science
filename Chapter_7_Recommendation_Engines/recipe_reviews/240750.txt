This recipe was delicious.  I added two eggs and sprinkled the top with sanding sugar.  My family ate the entire loaf.  I also added about 1 1/2 cups walnuts and a tsp. vanilla.

I thought this was pretty tasty banana bread. It has a nice sweet flavor and almost tastes like a mix between carrot cake and banana bread, but definitely still a banana bread in overall flavor and texture. I was confused by the 2 loaves suggestion. I changed the servings to 9 to make one loaf in-case that was an issue. Next time I will make the recipe exactly as is. I baked the reduced version in my 9x5 pan and it was a little short. I think that may be a misprint. The carrot amount is equivalent to about 1 large carrot. That was the most consuming part of the recipe, as the walnuts I had were already chopped. The one I made I baked for about 50 minutes, in a pan sprayed with Bakers Joy. It came out nicely. I sliced it with my bread slicer and got 16 slices. ty, I would make this for others as a food gift as suggested.

No eggs, no oil, this was done exactly as recipe called for.  It was awful.  Carrots and bananas in this recipe didn't go together!!  I think she left out the main ingredients eggs and oil!

Batter was so dry- added 2 eggs as recommended- was still quite thick, and had to spread it into corners of pan. 

It baked up nicely, bready textures bit dry. And not as sweet as cake. We just ate ours warm with ice cream! Delightful!

Next time I think I'd make a slightly bigger batch. It calls for 8x4 bread pans, but mine are 9x5. So my loaves came out very short. But that's not the recipe's fault, that's mine for using the wrong pans. Next time I'll just beef it up and make 50% more batter. Oh and I added a cup of raisins. Yum. And I went hevy on the cinnamon (used twice as much). Very moist. Family loves it. Good recipe. =)

Made the bread. Followed the recipe to the letter. It called for two 8 x 4 loaf pans. Loaves came out about 2 inches high. Very dense and heavy. Did the toothpick test, which tested done and the bread had pulled away from the sides of the pan. That says done to me. It was the worst bread ever. Would never make it again. Even the flavor was terrible!

Very moist! Turned out just like the pictures. The consistency was dry so I added another banana. I also substituted dark chocolate for the walnuts. Turned out great!

We liked it. I omitted the walnuts due to an allergy and made it in one pan. The dough is very thick but the end product is very moist and tasty.

Mine turned out moist and delicious, though a little dense. I might try modifying the receipe a bit next time to get it to rise a bit more.

Turned out great. I was out of ap and used bread flour and cashews instead of walnuts. Next time I will add All spice as I prefer a more spicy bread. Bananas were small to medium which worked great. Used carrot pulp from the juicer. Next time I will add 50% more.

I didn't get a strong taste of carrots or bananas. I used some of the  suggestions in reviews. 
Added 1 egg for moisture , sprinkled super fine sugar on top of muffins(made about 18) 
Not sure what would be good to bring out the favors

I LOVED THIS BREAD! The texture came out unlike most banana breadsâ€¦it was almost moist and chewy! I added less brown sugar, didn't add baking soda and baked for 45 minutes instead of 50. GREAT TASTE! LOVED!

I used this recipe but didn't add the banana's! I just wanted the carrot flavor! I used 2 1/2 c shredded raw carrots as that was all I had. I added milk to replace moisture from banana's along with dried buttermilk.  Also added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. Will make again.
