I grew up in Germany and love this dish. You can have it in the morning like a hot breakfast or as a dessert. We used to add fresh fruit like cherries or berries to it. My grandmother served a cherry soup with it. Delicious!

Great little breakfast! I only made 1 serving, I knew the hubby wouldn't like it. If you grew up, like me, eating cream of wheat this is what it reminded me of. It was very easy & good. Had it with wild blueberries. Thanks for a tasty breakfast.

Well you learn something new every day! Firstly I didn't have any semolina in my cupboard so I used polenta instead. Is it not the same thing? Lo and behold it worked, though I had my doubts as to whether it would thicken as I whisked madly away. Alas, it did and was devoured by my kids instantly. They especially enjoyed the last minute addition of chocolate chips that melted through nicely!

This tasted suprising similar to semolina au lait, just add a tad bit more sugar to taste and a dash of vanilla.

Loved this!  It is like cream of wheat as one reviewer said.  I added a smidge of Dr. Oetker's vanilla sugar and blueberries.  Even my picky 4 year old liked it. Thank you for sharing this one.

This is a good recipe and very easy to make. However, it tastes much better with some vanilla flavor.

Oh my gosh. I didn't know other people ate it like this, too. My mom made this for us when we were kids. And for our kids too.

After this cools down i put it in the food processor and add about 3 spoons of fresh cream and third a cup of wipping cream and a drop of vanilla. Process for 3 minutes then pore on cups. No one can make a different between it and a real ice-cream. Try it with nuts on the top.
