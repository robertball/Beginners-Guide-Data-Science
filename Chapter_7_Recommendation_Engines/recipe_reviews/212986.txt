For a soup the measurements seamed off. Used 1.5 lbs shirmp. I used a lot more liquid than suggested. Seasonings, peanut butter- needed more of everything. Peel the egg plant-which perhaps was a given. But I didn't know. I thought it was good. But will continue to experiment to make it "pop". Sesasme oil while sauteing the onions and garlice was a yummy adjustment.
