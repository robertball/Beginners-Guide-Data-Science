This type of coleslaw has become a staple of our Mexican/American cooking.  Great on tacos, burritos, tostadas or as a side.  We have made this with regular vegetable oil and white vinegar as well and it works well.  I would however add a little sugar to the oil/vinegar to sweeten the slaw just a bit.  A bit of fresh ground pepper never hurt either.  All in all a great recipe.

I made this exactly as written and found it to be bland. I added one teaspoon cumin, 2 chopped jalape√±o peppers, seeds removed from one, the juice and zest of one lime.

I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.  Searching for foods that would be diet helpful, several sites (academic sites as well as homeopathic)mentioned that raw or lightly cooked cabbage is a good choice.  It also mentioned olive oil so I looked for those ingredients.  I happened to have rice vinegar with basil and oregano seasoning so I used it. While it is not my preferred cole slaw recipe, I think it fit my needs and I will be having it a lot.

This is a nice change from the mayo-based coleslaws.  Every time I bring it to a potluck the dish is empty.  It is best used the same day, but given an hour or so to marinate.  I do not use the cilantro.  I have added a tablespoon of lime, a couple tablespoons of grated onion, 2 tablespoons of sugar, a teaspoon of celery salt, and a sweet pepper chopped into bite-sized pieces.

This is a good base but it lacked flavor. I added cumin and some pickled jalapenos and it made the dish much better.

I don't like leaving negative reviews, but we really couldn't stand this. I even tried to fix it with the other reviewers tips...still pretty bad.  The only thing "Mexican" about this is the cilantro, as written.  Very little flavor, and the flavor it has is not good.
