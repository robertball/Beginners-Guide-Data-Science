These were tasty! I only had canola oil, so I used that, but to be fair, the recipe submitter says they taste way better when frying them in peanut oil, which I had none of, so I just went w/ what I had and they were fine. I only had a few artichokes to use up, so I made a small batch. These would be wonderful w/ some sort of dipping sauce. I plan to try these again using peanut oil to fry and making a sauce for dipping. Thanks for sharing. :)

These were amazing! Very flavorful. I didn't have a deep fryer but I heated up the peanut oil in a pot and dipped them in for a few minutes until the bacon looked crisp. They came out perfect! Will be making these again.
