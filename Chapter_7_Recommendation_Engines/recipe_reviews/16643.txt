This is delicious.  I pureed half of the corn to make it creamier.  I recommend melting the cream cheese a little first so that it melts into the soup easier.

Very good soup!  I used a sweet onion, unsalted butter, 1% milk, and low-sodium broth.  I added about a cup more broth than called for (and it made just enough for 3 adults and 2 kids as the main course of dinner).  I also used Neufchatel cheese, and was afraid it wouldn't work, but it did.  It was actually very thin until I added the cheese, and I was worried.  At first, the cheese broke up into little chunks, but I wisked it really well and it worked fine.  I don't use canned corn so I used 3 cups frozen (a mix of white and yellow).  I used garlic powder and just a sprinkle of the garlic salt.  Served with crackers and a nice green salad.

Yummy soup!  I made exactly as instructed, velvety smooth and filling.  I can see adding some grilled chicken breast to it but it's good for me as is.  I made this on a stormy night.  :)

THE BEST!!! I LOVE creamy soups and this one is the pinnacle of a great cream soup.  I was a little wary about trying a cream soup on my own, but WOW! It does not get any simpler than this. Don't let the ingredients fool you, they combine to make one tasty dish. ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS*****!

Such great flavour for such a simple soup! I loved it.  I added 1/4 pound of imitation crab to this soup for a bit of a twist and it was delicious.

I really enjoyed this soup.  Next time I will follow the advice of someone else and melt the cream cheese before adding it.  It was difficult to get it fully incorporated.  

This soup has a lot of options.  It would be great with crab, bacon, cheese, or just about anything else.

I thought this tasted okay. I was looking for a corn soup or chowder to use some corn I had just cut off some cobs. I did use no sodium broth and fresh corn instead of canned. I am glad I did because, with the added garlic salt, this would have been way too salty. I ended up using corn from 4 cobs for the 2 12oz cans. I subbed 1 Tblsp. of dry parsley for the parsley and it worked fine and just did a pinch or so of black pepper, as I don't really care for it. I tasted it and thought it was missing something and a little too thin. I ended up adding a Tblsp. more of flour, and whisking that in, and chopping up a couple of sprigs of green onion and adding that also. It much improved the taste and texture. I had no bacon like a lot of the other corn soups and chowders tend to use as garnish, etc. but we did sprinkle it with a cheese blend. It was filling tonight and quick for what I had in the house.

This soup is delicious! Very simple and easy to make. I substituted some ingredients for lower fat versions and it was still creamy and amazing.

Wow!  I steamed a couple of large crab claws & added them (broken up) at the end, rather than the chicken suggested in the recipe header.  I also prefer a smoother texture, I blended most of the soup as other reviewers suggested (before adding the crab).  So creamy & filling, with loads of flavour.  Wonderful!

I was pleasantly surprised with this soup. I wasn't too sure about the cream cheese, having never put cream cheese in a soup before, but in the end, it turned out fabulous! My husband even wanted seconds!

I give it four stars for being a great base recipe, but thought my version was great, five stars!  I started by sauting two very thinly sliced chicken breasts, removed and then proceeded with the recipe.  I used 2% milk and two cans of Campbell's chicken broth I added the second one after I saw how it lacked the extra "soupy-ness" I like.  It was more like a stew.  I did have to thicken it a bit after this with a flour slurry.  I also used frozen corn, added diced pimentos and the chicken back in.  Next time I'd cut back on the corn.  I was very surprised that you could taste the cream cheese, there isn't much in it.  Served it with oyster crackers and cheddar cheese.

I made this as directed, with one exception...I used an immersion blender to purée it at the end.  Served with a selection of "toppings" to choose from....cheddar cheese, green chiles, crumbled bacon, hot sauce...it was really good with these additions.  It's an excellent base but a bit blah when eaten plain.

I really like this--I agree very easy and lower in fat!! I stuck the veggies in the food processer and had the soup ready start to finish in about 15 min. Next time I will probably substitute one diced potato for one of the cans of corn...a little too much corn for my taste...In my opinion, though, this would be a great base for any creamed vegetable soup.

Great base recipe! Instead of fresh parsley I used a tablespoon of italian seasoning. I also used 2% milk, whipped lite cream cheese, but then at the very end added about 4 oz of shredded jack and cheddar cheeses to thicken it up! Yummy!

This is probably my favorite soup that I now make. If you want it thicker than it turns out you HAVE to use an  equal ratio of butter and flour!  So use at LEAST 3 Tbsp of BUTTER to your flour.  I also use fresh or frozen corn, never canned, unless that is all I have.  If using canned, Definitely drain it!  Also I always add in a good amount of cheddar cheese to my own bowl and I think that helps with the taste. Also if you can, go out of your way to use fresh parsley, it does help and you notice the flavor tremendously.  But I love the soup

My youngest daughter who is 12 loves to help me cook and made this soup almost entirely by herself.  It was delicious.  Creamy, rich tasting without mega calories. She will be a wonderful cook one day.

Good recipe!  I used Granulated Garlic, dried Chopped Onions and an additional Tbs of butter.  I used frozen corn and added extra to make the consistency I wanted.  Used 4 oz of cream cheese, and used Crushed Red Pepper flakes instead of the powdered cayenne pepper.  As directed by the recipe, spices were added to taste so the flavor wasn't bland at all.  Great soup, easy to make.  Will make again.

This is definitely a keeper ... with a couple changes to my taste! I added a little chili paste to pep it up some ... and I used frozen corn since I really don't care for the taste of canned corn. I also pureed the soup and then added an additional cup of corn so that it would have whole kernels.

Very simple to make...I used water in place of chicken broth to reduce the salt content and it still turned out amazing.  I also pre-boiled the 2.5 cups of milk which allowed it to have a more creamy consistency...last tip, I boiled it all together, and then took all but .5 cup of it and blended it up... oh by the way, I didn't put any cream cheese and it was a huge hit!

This was good, but it needed more thickening.  I also didn't care for the garlic in this.  I do like the idea of the green chili pepper though.  I think that it would have given it a little zip that it needed.  Perhaps even some shredded cheese would have been good too.

Good recipe but it lacks a VERY important ingredient. SOY SAUCE! when my family tasted it without the soy sauce they all gave me death looks!! After I suggested adding soy sauce, everyone was fighting over the very last drop. Great recipe but you HAVE to add some soy sauce at the end.

Delicious comfort food!! I added 2 chopped celery ribs to the onions and added some fried bacon at the end. Wow, I will make this again! Some complained about it being bland.....it's creamy and comforting. Add some salsa or jalapeno peppers, but it's not that kind of soup, really.

I scaled this up to 5 servings.  I'm not sure if the calculator didn't work correctly, but the soup is way too watery even after adding extra flour.  Not sure how this got so many good reviews because I think the final product is awful.  I have no idea how I'm going to eat a pot of this  myself...

This was easy, fast and delish.. I made it for dinner on a cold night here in NY. I also added a can of crabmeat and alittle bit of Tonys seasoning (but I Tonys in everything) Definately a keeper.

This recipe was not very clear.  The corn did not specify whether it was to be drained or not.  (I assumed it was.)  Also, I assume the soup is intended to thicken some - I'm assuming that's what the flour is for.  However, I wasn't sure WHEN it was supposed to be permitted to thicken - before or after adding the corn and cream cheese.  We weren't crazy about the finished soup.

This was okay. I consider it more of a base recipe to work from. It needs more seasoning and stuff added to it. I added diced potatoes, carrots and tarragon. The additions helped, but it still needs something else. My 2 recommendations when making this soup are to make sure the onions are finely diced and make a sure that you have a good roux, otherwise the soup is really thin.

This soup is amazing. It’s quick and so yummy. I’m vegetarian and would have used veggie broth but was out and used water. I always use frozen versus canned. I can’t getover how delicious this is!

Really good. I didnt have fresh parsley so used 1 tsp of dried.  Added a little corn starch as a thickener and a little cheddar cheese at the end.

I tweaked it a lil bit by adding crushed red pepper flakes & shredded Mexican Cheese, using both frozen & canned corn, using half & half cream (added water 1:1) instead of regular milk and it turned out good! I also melted the cream cheese in the  microwave as suggested by many. Will definitely  be cooking it again.

I followed the recipe as described, I just doubled it and added an extra garlic clove and 3 more tablespoons of flour to make it a thicker consistency. It was very flavorful and delicious, my family loved it.

Really good. It was a perfect balance of savory with a little bit of sweet. I didn't have cream cheese so I substituted for 2 slices of American cheese and a few slices of Colby jack and it still turned out delicious. I also blended half of the corn per the suggestion of another review and the flavors blended a lot better.

Perhaps it's only my taste, but it was too sweet and funny. With some on-the-fly modifications, I was able to make it good. Great starting point, but not recommended if recipe is gospel.

This was the second of two soups that I made for a holiday luncheon.  I used frozen corn that we cut off the cobs and froze last summer.  I made approximately 1 1/2 times the recipe and didn't measure either the chicken broth or the milk (which I used half and half for).  I used 4 ounces of cream cheese (half an 8 ounce block).  I also added a healthy dose of dried chives and half a jalapeno diced small.  This soup was a hit and will be made again.  Thanks!

I absolutely loved this soup.  I added a little bit of Cavendar's because I love it in everything but other than that I changed nothing and it was great but next time I will probably add either chicken or crawfish because it seems like it would be an awesome base for either.

It isn't as thick as I would have imagined, but with a little extra flour, it was alright. I pureed the corn and added it to the soup.

I love corn soup so much. This was a wonderful recipe. I always add chopped up tomato, and whatever meat I feel like; whether ham pieces or chicken. Remember with soup you can add almost anything. My mom likes to put potato in it as well.

Very nice soup...I used whole milk and while you can tell it isn't cream if you put enough flavors in it isn't bad. I also used dried paresley instead of fresh (can't stand the taste of fresh unfortunately).Used frozen white corn instead of canned to cut down on sodium and added my own salt to the mixture.  At the end added some cheddar (mild) and melted through because the milkiness alone was    not enough flavor for me. I think tabasco, worchestershire, or Old Bay would be nice additions as well. Almost a 5 but not one of the best I've had. EXTREMELY EASY... and anything I don't want to puree is tops with me.

I had to stretch this recipe when I learned we would have extra dinner guests. So, I doubled the cream cheese, added 2 cans of cream style corn and a package of polish sausage, diced. It was delicious. I served it with a revised version of this site's "Savory Sausage, Cheese and Oat Muffins" since I thought a corn muffin would be redundant. ;)

Wow, maybe I did something wrong, but this had a really strong garlic taste!  My whole house smelled like garlic for the rest of the day.  But good thing I love garlic!  I added 4 small chopped red potatoes with the corn and cream cheese, brought to a boil, and then covered and simmered for 20 minutes.  This softened the potatoes and melted the cream cheese.  But remember to stir often or the roux will thicken on the bottom! I also used dried parsley and omitted the cayenne pepper.  Will definitely make again!

Great taste, almost exactly like my mom's Crema de Elote! I don't remember any onion chunks in my mom's though. Not a problem for the taste, but as we got to the bottom of the pan the chunks were unbearable to some in the fam... (also, if you didn't try this with ritz-type crackers, you must!)

I made it exactly as written except for using fresh corn off the Cobb. It was a very good soup except for me it was way too peppery. I only added a small dash of cayenne so I knew it wasn't that. I will make again except cut the pepper at least by half or even less. If you like a spicy soup it may be fine for you.

I really liked this.  I had to use dried parsley, and we did a 1:1 of the butter to flour.  I used fresh corn cobs and cut off the kernels because I'm trying not to use canned foods.  My daughter put 1/2 of the corn in the food processor to make it creamier, and it did not disappoint.  I tried to get my husband to walk down the block for a rotisserie chicken to add some to the soup but he wasn't feeling it.  It was creamy and yummy anyway.

Thanks for the great recipe it really is easy and delicious. I wanted a thicker tangier soup so I added  heavy cream instead of some of the milk, some mashed potatoes a cup of sour cream and fresh lemon juice. I blended it and it was perfect- creamy and tangy. It disappeared instantly!

Good flavor  next though I will puree half the corn as another reviewer suggested.  The cream cheese I heated in the microwave with 1 cup of milk then whisked it before adding it to the  soup.

Simple, have all ingredients on hand and very tasty.  Like others, I pureed  (1)  15.5 oz can of corn ( along with all of the packing  juice) to thicken it.  I also added  a medium cubed potato, a stalk of celery, a large carrot, a tsp of Chervil and used a half stick of butter to sauté it all together.  I'll make this again and might add a can of cooked diced tomatoes or sweet red peppers.

Would be great with chicken in it.  Hearty, but not very thick (I used skim milk and low-fat cream cheese - at room temp).  May try to puree half the corn next time.  Good flavor - added a jalapeno to spice it up. Doesn't need any more than that for a kick.  For the corn, I thawed frozen corn, but will try cutting corn from 4 fresh cobs next time.

This recipe really is good, but because one reviewer mentioned it was bland, I played with it just a tad.  I used fresh corn, cut from the cob instead of canned corn.  I put in a small smoked ham hock and a couple of the corn cobs while it simmered.  The fresh corn (3 ears worth) with the cobs and the little smoky flavor from the ham hock made this perfect.

Thank you so much for your recipe(^_^) I just found yr recipe and went to supermarket right away. Lol I didnt put the cream cheese in but I did some grated mozzarella in. The soup got thick and creammy. I thought I did too much of garlic salt. Have to cut down next time. Anyway. my gf and I love and enjoy this recipe.

I loved this soup!! It was quick and easy to make and had lots of flavor. I only had whipped cream cheese and it still turned out great. Also I added an orange bell pepper to it to give it a more southern taste. I would definitely make this recipe again. Awesome Soup!

I love this recipee!!! I just made it now, and even took some progress pics. I went a little weird and added breaded chicken that I baked in the oven (and scraped the breaded pieces that are left on the bottom of the baking pan), and a small amount of carrots, not enough to overwhelm, but enough to add a bit of extra flavour. Total comfort food

I agree that this soup makes a great base for other soups...I made it twice already and each time made it differently.  I always add 1 can of corn, 1 can of cream corn, 1 can of mix veggies and 1 can of whole potatoes cut up.  this time I also added a small can of peas..it was loaded with veggies and was sooooo good.   Next time I think I will add ham!

Good recipe! I followed recipe to key- I used homemade chicken broth instead of canned & it was good! A little more watery texture than I was expecting so I added some more flour-probably about 1/4 C. Also, I found to help with this that I whisked often while the soup was cooking

I'm a fan of Cajun Corn stew, when I saw this I just had to try it. The taste was Delicious; however maybe smoke sausage, salt meat, or some chicken would taste good along with it.

I made this last week and it was a hit!.  I used a combination of mexican corn and cream corn.  I didn't add the flour.  I used 1% milk.  I thought it was even better the next day.

This was sooo good! I added some leftover shredded chicken breast and sauteed a large carrot and 1 stalk of celery with the onion in a little more margarine.  I added the garlic when the veggies started to soften to avoid burning it. Otherwise kept everything the same.  I'll be making this one all winter long.  Served with crusty rolls.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe, until the end when I added a couple handfuls of pepper jack and sharp cheese. I was not impressed after testing a spoonful... Added more pepper. Came back to it after almost an hour and it was much better! Thick and flavorful, and slightly golden colored from the cheese. Yum.

This soup is great!  I screwed up a bit with the flour, and didn't have any garlic salt....but what the hey, this turned out really tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was excellent. Creamy, thick and tastey. I added 1/2 cup of salsa for a bit more mexican taste, but it was still excellent before the salsa. The only thing omitted was the parsely because I am currently out of parsely ;p

This was a very easy and quick corn soup.  My whole family liked it.  I pureed half of the soup to give it thickness.
