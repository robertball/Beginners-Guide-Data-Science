This recipe is excellent!  

Beware of the:
 1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce

That's 1 pepper, not 2 ... not a can. 

I placed 2 of those bad boys in 1/2 batch size.  Hot, Hot, Hot - but really good. 

This is good so people will scarf this up at a party ... use the hot peppers to slow them down.   :-)

I served this with toasted Pita slices - split in 1/2, cut into triangles, brushed with olive oil, granulated garlic, salt and Pepper to taste.  Toasted at 450 in the oven until crisp.

This hummus was delicious.  Very flavorful with a hint of spicy - not overwhelming.  I used the ingredients as listed - except no tahini as my store does not sell it.

The only change I made to prep was a tip I read on another hummus recipe to make a creamier mixture:
Drain the garbanzo beans and pour them into a bowl of water.  With fingers, gently rub the beans to loosen the hull.  Hulls will float to the top and you can easily scoop them out.  When you've removed them all, drain off the water and use the beans as directed.

Very good recipe, don't make the same newbie mistake I made.  I was running back and forth from the kitchen to the computer to read the recipe. In brief glancing, I read it as "1 can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce."  Just so nobody else makes the same dumb mistake.  It's ONE PEPPER, not ONE CAN of peppers.  For what it's worth, it turned out really good, but super spicy.  If you like really spice, dump the whole can in, it's super flavorful.  I remade the recipe correctly and I love it.

I have never reviewed a recipe before but I had to for this one.  This dip is delicous! My new favorite. It is a battle letting it marry in the fridge for a whole hour. The only things I did differently was omitting the roasted peppers and using the liquid from the garbanzos in place of water.  That was before I thought of using the water I soaked my homemade sundried tomatoes in.  I will try that next time. 
This is good stuff, perfect snack on a hot summer's day.  

Thanks for posting it, I use chipotle and cilantro all the time and would have never thought of adding them to hummus, which is another favorite.  5 stars.

Oooooh my! This is soooooo good! I made a couple of alterations- Instead of 1/2 cup water, I used water and a splash of the juice from the bottle of red peppers as well as a healthy dose of the adobo sauce from the chipotle peppers. I used lime as weel as lemon, left out the tomato. I used dried cilantro as that is what I had. I tasted it prior to adding the tahini, and it was great without, although it does add depth to the flavor. You can fiddle with this recipe to suit your taste. It's winner for sure, and will be going to our next office party! Thank you for sharing!

I made this for the first time last night to serve at an after-work party tonight.  As other posters have noted, it tasted a little bland with just one pepper, so I threw in a total of three (they were small) and about a tablespoon of the adobo sauce.  I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight, and this morning, the flavors had really come through wonderfully--it is delicious!  A couple of co-workers have sampled it and also think it is really good.  I can already tell this is one I will make again and again.  I followed the advice of one poster who said to rinse the beans and get the husks off them, and I can see the benefit of doing that. I'm really glad to have found this recipe!

My husband gave me an empty container and said he will never eat it again..... yeah right! He didn't like hummus until today and now he loves it!!! Awesome recipe. Just the right amount of kick. Great for dipping veggies, pita chips, and Triscuits. I use this as a spread in my veggie wraps instead of dressing.

Yum! Made it for a party and served it with carrots, celery and wheat crackers.  Later I ate some leftovers with tortilla chips and it was really yummy too.  The one chipotle pepper in the recipe goes a long way, I definitely tasted the kick, but I liked it. For some people in the group they would have liked it with probably only half a pepper.  Either way, two thumbs up from us!

I am so glad I found this hummus recipe!!! I usually buy the tiny containers from a local grocery store and a favorite restaurant so  I was happy to give this a try. I have to say that this a fantastic recipe as I love roasted red pepper hummus!!!! My husband who has never eaten hummus is now sold on it. I will no longer purchase those tiny containers. And for those of you wondering if you need tahini, I absolutely think you do. It adds that nutty hummus flavor that I like. Yeah it's expensive, but you can make several batches from a 15 oz. can using this recipe.

This hummus is amazing!!!  We've made it a number of times and it is always a hit.  Plus it is perfect for summer get togethers since it doesn't need to be refrigerated or heated, and can be served with pita chips (Bare Naked from Sam's Club are the best!) or veggies.    To make it spicier, add some adobo sauce (also gives nice color) and/or another chipotle pepper.  For a less expensive version, omit the roasted red peppers and/or the sun dried tomatoes.    Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

Bravo Bravo Bravo!!! This was the best hummus I have ever had! I've made a couple of hummus recipes off this site, and my boyfriend and I both agree that this is the BEST ONE! I wish I had made this earlier but was put off by the amount of ingredients in the dish but this is AWESOME. I was out of lemon juice so I used lime juice. Also I used one can of the beans but put in the whole pepper and about an extra teaspoon of the adobo sauce in. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

This is delicious.  The recipe makes a TON and I'm glad because there is plenty left over after a large party :) I made it as is except added a bit more cumin and a half can of chipotle peppers to up the heat a bit.  Its fun to eat, sweet and smokey at first then the spice kicks in at the end- yum!  It took a long time for me to de-husk the beans as recommended in reviews and I would NOT repeat that step again since the hummus is already kind of coarse from the red peppers and tomatoes.  But will definitely make it again.

Excellent. I just recently started making hummus. I didn't even think I liked it till someone at a work party had me taste it. I've been playing it safe with more "traditional" recipes. I finally found actual tahini in the store (next to the peanut butter) and was anxious to try another batch. This one packs much more flavor. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes but I had a jar of pimentos (not sure why I had them). I threw a few tablespoons of those in with the rest of the igredients. It's the best batch of hummus I've ever made at home. I think even my "hummus hating" husband might be willing to try this.

Wonderful! Didn't tell my husband and friends what it was until they tried it.  The responses I received were A+, and I was told "I don't eat garbanzo beans, except for this now"! The second batch I made, I put the sundried tomatoes in the food processor a little earlier so they were chopped more, and not so chewy.

The flavor was pretty good, but the consistency was much too watery. If I make this again I would add more garlic and a lot less water (maybe substitute some other liquid).

We like it.  Although, it is quite spicy, and we like hot.  So, you may want to lighten up on the Chipotles or at least sample the product as you add the pepper/adobo.

My husband and I have tried the top rated hummus on this site, but in our opinion, it cannot be compared to this chipotle hummus. This is definitely the best hummus recipe we have tried and we have been making it ever since. Thank you for contributing this recipe!!

This is a great dip!  I skipped the Tahini because they didn't have it at the store, instead threw in a tablespoon or so of sesame seeds.   I have made it twice and both times got rave reviews.  Easy and quick to make, also great because you can make it a few days ahead of the party and keep in the fridge.  Great with crackers, pita chips and veggies.  Would make a great spread on a sandwich too!  Like others have said, please keep in mind you are only taking ONE chipotle pepper out of the can with adobo sauce...one is spicy enough for a general crowd!

Tastes great, but with all these ingredients, it actually is cheaper to buy hummus pre-made. I have also made without the sun-dried tomatoes, and it was still very good hummus, and a couple bucks cheaper. Also, the liquid overflowed my (Kitchenaid 8 cup) food processor's blade height, so if you have the smaller food processor, you should halve this recipe. I used 2 chipolte peppers. It turned out 'medium' spicy:perfect for me.

Yum-O! This was super delicious!!! My hubs and I were invited to celebrate New Years Eve with our neighbors. All we needed to bring was ourselves and an appetizer. :) I tinkered with the idea of preparing a hot dish, but didn't know if there would be any way to keep it warm on the buffet. Of all the cold appetizer ideas in my recipe box, this one seemed most interesting to me. I am SOOOO glad I gave this a try! This was simply fantastic, healthy and made a TON! The only downside is that it is a tad expensive to prepare. I pretty much followed SAAVY's directions to the letter except for a couple of minor changes. First, I used most of my roasted pepper juice in lieu of water (I only needed to add a little bit of water to measure 1/2 c.). Second, I added 1/2 T of chipotle sauce and an extra (small) pepper to my hummus (I could barely detect any heat as is). NOTE: Although not necessary, removing the hull from your garbanzo beans will ensure a creamy hummus texture. As M2MIN's review explains, simply rinse your beans, then add them to a large pot of water. Gently rub all of the beans to loosen the hull / skin. The hulls will float to the top of the pot and all you'll need to do is scoop them out, drain and proceed with the recipe. Served with cucumber slices, carrot nibblers and pita chips. To my surprise, out of the three "dunkers," I like the cucumber the best! Thanks for sharing, SAAVYHOSTESS! My neighbors now want your recipe! :-)

Super good! While we’re not hummus connoisseurs, this one is far better than those we’ve had before. Much better than store bought versions sold at WF. A minor point of confusion was with “6 oil-packed sun dried tomatoes”; not sure how to interpret a quantity of 6 as store bought not packaged this way. Deviated by going w/ California Sun-Dry Fat Free Smoked Sun Dried Tomatoes (used 3/4 of 3 oz. pack), and this worked out well. Thanks SAVVYHOSTESS for sharing & we’ll be making this again.

Nice flavor and really easy to make. I did use the juice in the cans of beans in lieu of water and added a bit more Adobo sauce and chipotle peppers since I like extra spice. Great dip with carrot sticks and celery.

Ok, I made the  mistake of adding the can of chipotle in adobo sauce; since I can handle the heat, I don't think the rest of my family can.  It looks like I'm the only one eating this.  Great recipe.

Yummy recipe! Suggestions: make sure to scrape out the seeds and membranes from the inside of the adobo chipotle (wear a pair of those disposable kitchen gloves and take them off by peeling them off your hands from the inside), it will make the heat manageable and more uniform; skip the oil, you're saving 200 calories and no one will notice.

It was good, but not amazing.  I don't know if it was worth the extensive prep and the waste of half jars of several speciality ingredients.  I made this exactly as written and just wasn't very impressed.  While it was edible, I don't think I'll be making this one again.  I guess I much prefer "regular" hummus.

I hate to be a downer, but I really didn't like this. I'm not even sure why: I like all the ingredients that go into it. Maybe it's because not a single ingredient really stood out in flavor. It tasted vaguely like red pepper with a slightly smoky aftertaste. I don't think the cilantro did good things for it either, and I love cilantro. Thanks for sharing anyway!

This is the very best hummus I have ever had anywhere as well as the easiest to make.  I love it.  It works well for pita chips and things...but what my husband and I most often use it for is to make sandwich wraps.  Smear this hummus on a tortilla with romaine lettuce, thinly sliced onion, and sandwich meat of your choice....extremely delicious but most importantly, it saves a lot of calories and fat to use this instead of using mayo anything.

Yummy. Much cheaper than buying it from the store. I think a second chipotle would kick it up a notch, but my hubby can't eat too much chile. Next time I'll do a side batch.

This was delicious!  I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used 2 frozen cilantro cubes from Trader Joe's.  I also roasted my own peppers and left out tomatoes (because I didn't have any on hand).  I will make this one again and again!

This recipe was very tasty but way too spicy for me.  I like spicy foods but the chiptle peppers were just too much.  I would cut way back on the peppers if I made it again.

I used fresh garbanzo beans for this recipe.  Half of a one pound bag is roughly equivalent to the 2 15.5 ounce cans it asks for!   Either way, the recipe is hard to mess up, and most of the ingredients can be altered to personal preference.  Love this recipe!

This is, by far, the best hummus I've ever had. It has a beautiful color to it, and the spices all compliment each other very well. I brought this to a potluck and it was nearly gone by the end. Even people who hate hummus liked this recipe!

I've made this several times. If you don't have tahini, no worries, toast some sesame seeds and grind them in your spice mill, add a little extra olive oil, or use some sesame oil. I used the water from the roasted red peppers for the water. Today when I made this I had no fresh cilantro on hand, but had parsley and the flavor was still good. Definitely add more than one chipotle or extra adobo sauce if you like it hotter. My valentine doesn't like food too spicy so I make it as directed and add my own heat to my serving with a little Dave's Temporary Insanity Sauce. I won't waste my money on store bought any more by choice! Warm some pita bread and dig in!

I've made this recipe at least 4 times now and it is a definite keeper.  I made only a few changes; I do not add water, instead I add a little of the water that the roased bell peppers are soaked in.  I do not add any salt and do not miss it at all as there is a "fiesta" of flavor going on with all the other ingredients.  I also add an additional clove of garlic as we all love the spice.  This recipe is a crowd super-pleaser!! Thanks so much for this recipe.

This is delicious, best hummus recipe I've tried and I've tried A LOT! Be sure to use ONE chipotle pepper, NOT one can! The wording is a little unclear. My extended family wouldn't eat something called "hummus" because they think they don't like new things. I called it bean dip and a double batch was gone in one afternoon! Perfect with pita chips, on a wrap with veggies and as dip for about anything you can dip!

Wow - this is fantastic!!  I've had regular hummus and I think the chipotle and sundried tomatoes really takes this dish to the next level.  I served with grilled pita bread and it was a hit - even for those who never had hummus before.

This was fantastic... my friends thought it was much better than store-bought. The second time I made it I used less tahini (I could really taste it in the first version), no roasted red peppers (didn't have any) but threw in an extra sun dried tomato.

My husband and I agree that this recipe is a keeper. I upped the chipolte pepper to one and a half for a little more heat. Perfect! Our Latino BIL couldn't stop eating it. I had to send the leftovers home with him! Now that's an endorsement! Thanks, SavvyHostess.

Shopping for the ingredients for this recipe had some challenges.  I had no idea how many different kinds of roasted peppers and sundried tomatoes even existed and I had to hunt to find the "Chipotle Peppers"  Thanks to Unico and Casa Fiesta I found products I thought would work.  My hummus is so hot!  I keep walking back to eat more (with pita bread) as I type this, but hot!  Oh my!  I used "Flame Roasted Pepers" by Unico and I bought the 370ml jar - which I think was close to double what the recipe called for at 7oz, so I used about half.  I accidently bought Julienne cut sundried tomatoes - so I guessed at how much "6 whole" would be.  Chipolte Peppers from Casa Fiesta.....I used two of them because they looked small.  I don't know about chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, my grocery store didn't seem to have it. I am glad I tried this recipe.

Delicious!  Tahini was not available when I first made this recipe so I toasted 1/2 c. sesame seeds on the stove top until very fragrant then added to garbanzo beans. (Just be sure to thoroughly pruee this mixture before adding remaining ingredients)  Per other posters I use the bean juice instead of water and removed the skins.  Omitted the tomatoes, and substituted Italian parsley for the cilantro.  I  use the remaining garlic and spices as written and think the heat and flavor are spot on. Have had many compliments on this dish.

I just started making my own hummus last summer, but I got so stuck on this recipe that it's the only one I've tried so far!  I also made the mistake of adding a whole can of chipotle peppers, but I love the spiciness, so I now make it that way each time!

I get raves every time I bring this to a function. It's super-easy to make and it is always a hit. 
I like to have a batch on hand for snacking on at home. 
This one will stay in my regular rotation!

Sooo good. I think it had a touch too much garlic, but the first comment my friend said was that it needed a touch more. So go figure...I guess it is up to individual taste.

This dip is amazing!  I omitted the bell peppers and cumin (personal preference), and doubled the tomatoes and cilantro.  Used lime instead of lemon, and oil from the tomatoes instead of plain olive oil.  Had to put this in the fridge before I ate too much of it!

I strongly dislike hummus and garbanzo beans, but this was fabulous.  I made some using a dry hummus mix for a base, and it was wonderful.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Delish! A new staple in our house! On my first attempt, I made 1/2 the recipe which was plenty! I also left out the sundried tomatos (I did not have any on hand) and it was great. I was sick of spending $4 for a small container of Sabra chipotle (which I do love). I make this new once a week! This is a simple and very adaptable recipe!

This is really good. But I think to be fair, you need to let it sit in the fridge for several hours to give all the flavors a chance to blend. If you eat it right away it's bland. But if you give the peppers and seasonings a chance to mingle, it's awesome!!

I have to say this recipe is absolutely DELICIOUS! I, just like many others above me, also added extra chipotles because I also love spicy things. I made some oven toasted pita chips brushed with a little olive oil and some mashed garlic to eat the hummus with. I brought it to my family reunion and just about everyone that ate some asked for the recipe. Needless to say, I didn't leave with any left-overs though which I was very dissapointed about. The only couple things I did differently is used some of the different sauces instead of as much water (a tiny bit of adobo and sundried tomatoes oil as well as some of the garbanzo bean juice). And the extra chipotles. I just kind of eyeballed the ingredients the second time and it still came out just as delicious. It's practically a foolproof recipe. I would probably make this everyday if I could.

Ironic that I had every ingredient minus the tahini.  I added 1 TBSP toasted sesame seeds to make up for that.  This was my first time making hummus and I think I hit the jackpot with this recipe!  I served this with tiny pretzels!  Thank you!

I can't seem to keep this around long. Everyone loves this recipe.  My daughter takes this with rice crackers in her backpack to share at school and hubby gets requests at work for me to keep sending it for the guys to munch on. Even some non-hummus eaters like this one.

I made this exactly as the recipe indicates, but found it a bit bland.  I then added another chipotle pepper, upped the salt by several pinches, added another clove of garlic, upped the lemon juice to 1/3c, and included the juice from the roasted red peppers.  The result was the best hummus I have made yet, but the original recipe needed a fair bit of tweaking.

It's not a bad recipe, but I think it helps to have a taste for hummus before making it. 

I added some sour cream and loaded up on the spice. It turned out great. 

I would also recommend this as a condiment on sandwiches to replace ketchup or mustard depending on your tastes!

Loved this recipe. Served it at a couple of Holiday parties and it got great comments. One occasion I added an additional Chipotle pepper for additional kick. I also followed a suggestion found here to toast the Pita with a little cumin....EXCELLENT!

This was good!  I added extra garlic because it seemed bland at first, but once it sat overnight, it could clear up a headcold.  It was still very good, but stick with the recommended amounts :).

I made this and it came out GREAT!  I did rinse the canned beans under fresh water, however, to reduce the salt which the canned beans seem to have plenty of.   Oh, and I added about a teaspoon of honey as somebody else suggested and it was extra delicious, too.  Rich and flavorful!

The recipe is a whopping 5. Thank you for the fantastic recipe. Luckily I love spicy. It would have been a great idea to specify one chipotle pepper in adobo sauce and omit the wording canned. This would have probably avoided some confusion. As several other people have mentioned, by mistake they read one can of chipotle peppers, so did I - but as I said I love spicy. So please be for-warned - only use one chipotle pepper not the whole can if you do not like spicy

Best I ever tasted.  The only changes I made was that I roasted the red pepper myself and garlic cloves. I did leave out the tahini as my daughter is allergic to sesame seed. It was still really good. If serving immediately go with what you taste now. But if chilling for tomorrow, hold up on how much chipotle pepper/sauce you use.  It gets spicier as the ingredients marry.

I'm with Savvyhostess why buy overpriced hummus at the store (Wally World store brand chickpeas are only 68 cents a can)when it is so easy to make plus it tastes better.I made it pretty much as written but of course not exactly.I see no point in draining the beans and adding water back to it.Why not just use the liquid that is in the can?I also puree a can of chipotles in adobo sauce and add one teaspoon at a time until i get the heat level i want.So much better than that bland stuff premade from the store ; )

This is the first hummus recipe that I have made.  I did add two of the chipotle chili because we do like spicy foods.  It was easier to make than what I had always envisioned.  I just let the food processor do its job.  Definitely is a keeper in my file.

This is exactly what I was looking for and is soooo good! It tastes like the one I get from Trader Joe's that used to be my favorite. I like that I can customize this recipe to suit the tastes of my husband and kids - some of us like it spicier and some like it milder.

This was my 1st attempt at making hummus, and it was a hit. I loved the balance of flavors. I used roasted peppers and sun dried tomatoes from the olive bar at the grocery store and it worked out great.

Good recipe but it can get expensive to make with the whole can of red peppers and the sun-dried tomatoes.  When I made it the 2nd time I omitted the red peppers and tomatoes and the taste was just as good if not better.  Try omitting these 2 ingredients for a more cost effective recipe. Hummus also turned out too watery when following the directions as written - be cautious and add the water little by little.  You really don't need an entire half cup.

I love this hummus.  I served it with crudites and crackers for a Ladies' Night In, and everyone liked it.  I did not add any water, but probably doubled the olive oil.  I roasted my own red pepper, and that was plenty of flavor at a fraction of the cost.  Also, I only had dehydrated sundried tomatoes on hand, so I soaked those in some water before adding to the mix.  Oh, and I used 2 chipotles.  It was spicy, but not prohibitively so.  It does make a ton, but I used the leftovers in a wrap with feta and veggies for lunches throughout the week.  Delish!

The trick to creamy hummus is shelling each garbanzo bean.  It's a little tedious, but soooo worth it!

Yum!  I really enjoyed this.  My husband was looking for more of a chipotle smokiness, though.  I actually added one and a half chiles, but next time I will probably add the full two or three.  I have never made hummus before but we eat it all the time in our house.  This made a huge batch!  We will definitely save some money with this one.

I made this for lunch this week to go with celery and carrots and it turned out fabulous. Perfect amount of kick. Pay attention to chipotle pepper part - it's one pepper from the can, not the entire can itself.

This was a great recipe! We eat quite a bit of hummus at my house, which is kind of pricey, but aside from that, the flavors get repetitive, so I decided to venture out and make a few different flavors myself. One thing I don't like about hummus from the store is that it can get pretty calorie and fat dense, so in making this one, I actually eliminated the oil and the tahini to make it almost fat-free. I also left out the sun-dried tomatoes (I just forgot to write them on my grocery list). I actually used 3 chipotle peppers (I like things quite spicy), and some extra cilantro as well. The consistency was not quite as thick as most traditional hummus, but the flavor is so much better it is well worth the trade off. I also love the fact that with my modifications, I am eating something so much lower in fat and calories plus less expensive. A fun and different twist. I will definitely be making this again.

This is awesome! I have made it several times and it never fails to make me smile. Today I was out of chipotle so I used Chipotle Cholula sauce. I started with 1 Tablespooon. It is a great sauce but mild compared to a canned chipotle. I added more for my taste but it made a worthy substitute although it is far better with the real thing. Love it with vegies.  Also, the sun dried tomatoes in oil can be expensive so I heated up some olive oil and added sundried tomatoes I found in bulk foods then let it sit for a couple days . Worked fine. I have also used just the dried tomatoes without soaking in oil, just chopped them up a bit first.  The roasted red peppers can be done in your oven. Just use 2 small or 1 and 1/2 of med size peppers. Char under the broiler and skin before using.

I used the recipe as a base and it turned out great.  I halved the recipe, used 3 garlic gloves, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of cumin and a ton of sun dried tomatoes, 2 chipotle peppers and a few drops of siracha sauce.

This is my go-to savory dip recipe; I'm so glad I found it!  It's great for parties, snacking, and as a sandwich spread.  For those who do not have a full-size food processor, you can chop/puree the roasted red peppers, chipotles, sundried tomatoes, cumin, cilantro, and black pepper in a small food processor and mix it all into a party size tub of prepared hummus.  Make sure to include some of the adobo sauce out of the can of chipotles for extra smoky flavor!

As you can see from my snazzy new username, I'm an excellent cook'er-upper of names.

Now, I have to admit: I forgot to buy cilantro, I plain forgot to add the bell peppers, and I accidentally used tumeric instead of cumin (hey, they are the same color!--kinda) but this hummus still turned out fantastic. 

So my rating really is based on my accidentally awesome screw up, but I have full confidence had I paid attention, it would have tasted even better.

Five stars especially because I really dislike all food handling, and have resolved to use the Magic Bullet that has been sitting in my drawer for a year. (For anyone using a MB, you'll have to turn the whole unit upside down and shake the contents as people talk about elsewhere). This one is going down as a go-to staple to get me through the kitchen hassles associated with eating. Thanks!

Definitely 5 stars! This has some similarities to a Chipotle Hummus recipe I've made before, but this one tastes even better!  The only substitution I made was a slight one - used 1 TBSP of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes jar and 1 TBSP of olive oil. So delicious!

I have made this recipe countless times and always receive many complements.  This is the only hummus my husband will eat.  It is so much better than any store-bought ones I've tried.  I usually leave out the sun dried tomatoes and roast my own red pepper (super easy).  I also often remove the seeds from the chipotle pepper before adding it, as sometimes the blender doesn't get them all.

Not bad, but not what I was expecting and takes some odd ingredience that I wouldn't use in other recipes, so they'll probably go to waste unless I make a ton of hummus. I'm going to try other recipes. If I do make this one again I'm going to try leaving it in the food processor a little longer on the last step to get the sun dried tomatoes good and small. I think mine was too lumpy. I would also cut down on the lime, it was a little strong with the citrus for my taste.

Excellent. I made the recipe as written, then tweaked it to personal preference by adding the rest of my 12 oz jar of roasted red bells, a second chipotle chile, and a bit more salt.

This is a great hummus recipe. I only used 1 chipotle pepper for heat and it is perfect for all. Would add another for heat, if serving at a cocktail party.

Awesome! I've been trying lots of hummus recipes and this is the best so far. I didn't have roasted red peppers so omitted that and added extra sun dried tomatoes. The result was still delicious. Smooth and creamy; the lemon juice and cilantro are a great balance to the chipotle.

This recipe was SOOOOOO good!! My boyfriend and I made a full batch and we'd finished it off in about 2 or 3 days (and this recipe makes a LOT of hummus). We like it spicy so we added 3 or 4 chipotle peppers instead of just one and it was perfect! We can't wait to make it again!

I really like this hummus after making a few changes (I'm sure it is excellent as written as well).  I did not add the water as I like my hummus chunky.  I also did not add the sundried tomatoes or the roasted red peppers.  Instead I used a roasted red pepper flavored tahini.  Lastly, instead of adding a chipotle pepper, I added about 1/4 teaspoon of ground chipotle powder (much easier).  Great recipe; thanks for posting!

Great hummus. I ran into a little trouble because some of my sun dried tomatoes had been out of the oil and were a little too tough to be chopped in the food processor. Make sure the tomatoes are submerged before using them!

I like most all hummus recipes but I have to say this one is outstanding. I added three chipotle peppers instead of one.  Add one at a time and taste. This is so good, you could even eat it with your fingers and skip the crackers/bread.

Wonderful! I used the suggested water from my own sundried tomatoes' soak. Otherwise, I kept to the original.  The big chill at the end is so important; glad I was able to hide the container even a couple of hours. Highly recommend this hummus.

This is outstanding!  My only "real" omission was the sun dried tomatoes -- I didn't want that flavor to compete with the roasted red pepper.  I also omitted the additional water called for, and instead added the liquid from one of the cans of beans.  I made it previously with both cans undrained and it was a little runnier than I prefer, although the flavor was still excellent.  Make this!  It's great with corn chips as an appetizer!

This had tons of flavor and is far from boring hummus.  I enjoyed the addition of chipotle and roasted red peppers.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was awesome! I've been a big fan of Sabra's Supremely Spicy Hummus for years now but I'm not the biggest fan of the consistency, and the preservatives they add so my girlfriend who is a chef suggested I make my own. 

I followed this recipe except I didn't use water, I used a bit of the reserved liquid from the beans. Additionally I removed the hulls from the beans. I used 6 chipotle peppers which I blended, and minced one more and stirred in for some added punch. I added cayenne pepper, and chili powder and did not have cilantro.  

I used the adobo sauce from the peppers which definitely added some smokey flavor. Next time I will probably use half the peppers, and add red pepper flakes, and pimento and chili peppers to turn up the heat. 

For the cost of one 15oz Sabra container, you can easily make 60oz of your own, free of chemicals.

Delicious Hummus dip! I will use this again and again.  I made the same mistake as another reviewer did... The recipe calls for 1 "canned" chipoltle pepper in adobo sauce- NOT 1 "can" of chipolte peppers... My hummus was very spicy since I used the whole can. (I still liked it but my husband isn't into spicy stuff).  I read the reviews after I made it and read how a reviewer already warned us of that mistake.  Lol I never read directions first.

Sooo good! Since I live in The Netherlands, I couldn't find chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. I substituted it for some 'sambal badjak' (Indonesian seasoned chilipaste), and it turned out great!
Loved it, and I'm sure I'll make it again!

This is oh-my-stars good! I've made plenty of hummus before, but I think it is the dried tomatoes that give this particular hummus a different kick. I used smokey chipotle powder rather than the peppers in adobo because that's what I had on hand, but it was still excellent!

Fantastic!  I used two chipotle peppers instead of one for more kick and it was great!  (Thank you for the tip that it was one PEPPER, not one CAN!)  Probably my favourite flavour of hummus, and it was a hit at an event I cooked for the other day!

One of the best Hummus recipes around!  The only adjustment was I increased the chipolte peppers to 2 and poured some of the "sauce" from the can into the chickpeas and added about 1/2 tblspoon of sea salt.  So much can be done with this - will try adding garlic next time.
Will definately make again.

Splendid!  I left out the tahini and used less water; used ground chipotle chile pepper and extra sun-dried tomatoes.  Love it!

Absolutely delicious.
This will remain a staple in my household. Removing the seeds allows us to add in a bit more chipotle without getting blown away with the heat.

Absolutely Delicious! I've been on a hummus kick lately and I found this recipe and thought I would try it. I followed it exactly and it is better than any hummus I've bought in stores. I use it as a spread on sandwiches (instead of mustard or mayo), on pita bread, crackers or any type of veggie. It is simply delicious.

I doubled the cumin and left out the oil and tahini since I had just recently run out. Everything else I left the same and it was really good, even without the tahini.

Excellent, much better than any store bought. Adjust the "heat" to your preference. I used half can of crushed chipotle peppers. Everyone raved about it. It is a bit chunky from bean hulls and is not store bought smooth.

I loved this recipe. The only change I made is I hate cilantro and used parsley instead. This is a great recipe and I will use it again!

This was good, very flavorful but not my favorite. It needs to set in the refrigerator to develop the flavor fully.  Eat this with plain chips due to its already spicy flavor. I would probably make this again if I wanted a spicy hummus.

Somewhat tricky for this novice vegan.  I did make mistake of adding a CAN of the peppers---hot, hot, hot!  Saved it by adding corn, and an extra can of  chick peas.  
It is absolutely delious and enjoyed by my diverse group of family & friends...

Realized the recipe said 1 canned chipotle, not 1 can.  But wasn't hot enough for me.  Tried 2, 3, etc, then just tried 1 whole can.  No black pepper or salt added.  Perfect!  But I am one who eats the entire wasabi ball with 12 pcs of sushi so beware.

This is the best hummus! The second time I made it I didn't have any tahini, so I used peanut butter instead. I put in two chipotle peppers and a tsp. of the Adobe sauce. I roasted two red peppers and put those in. My friends all wanted the recipe.

Great Recipe. Family and friends loved this. 1000X better than the store bought stuff and you know what's in it. 
 I used 2 chipotle peppers instead of 1 and deseeded them. I also put in about 2-3 tbsp. of the adobo sauce.  2 peppers gave enough heat that lingers at the end and makes you want more. Will make again and again!

Due to personal preference, I left out cilantro and did not include the bell peppers... This hummus, which I made to go with a meat and cheese board, was absolutely amazing. 

I added quite a few more chipotle peppers and sun-dried tomatoes. After making it according to the directions and tasting it, I just added more until it was where we wanted it. My family doesn't really find chipotle peppers spicy and we love the smoky flavor that they impart... I doubled this recipe and I think that I used all but maybe a couple of the peppers in the can and probably another 6 or so tomatoes.

This recipe is definitely a keeper and won over people that haven't liked hummus in the past.

I love this! Instead of water, I used the garbanzo bean water. And instead of plain olive oil, I used the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. I have gotten raves over this at tailgating and parties.

I agree it was a bit watery, so next time I will add less liquid.  The consistency didn't hurt the taste one bit.  It has an awesome smokey taste!  Love it!

I followed the recipe w little to no changes really. Great taste!! Brought it to work with me and am now asked by co-workers any time I come to a function to bring this. It is excellent with hint of lime chips, but good enough to be used with plain veggies also.  Will be a make again recipe for sure.

This just miss the mark for me. It tastes nothing like hummus. I added the liquid from the can instead of water. It was really runny. I ended up adding 2 cloves of roasted garlic and more chipotle and a lime.

If you like hummus with a kick, this is for you. I make this often in my blender since I don't have a food processor. It takes a bit of stirring but it is well worth it. The only thing I do different is that I add the whole jar of roasted red bell peppers because they don't keep and I do not want to waste them.

I prefer white bean hummus vs garbanzo/chickpea hummus, as it provides a much creamier textured hummus. So, I used white beans for this recipe. I also halved all the ingredients. I did use 1/2 a sweet red bell pepper I roasted on my grill. I did not have the sun-dried tomato or cilantro, and cut lemon juice back to 1 tablespoon (personal taste). This was good, but I should not have cut the chipotle pepper in 1/2, but should have used a whole pepper, just not spicy enough. Next time I will add the sun-dried tomato and cilantro, too. I think these ingredients would have added more complex flavor, but this was a very good hummus even though I did not include all the listed ingredients.

I read the recipe wrong too and since I was making a half batch I used half the can of chipotle peppers.  But I like hot so it was awesome.  I normally make roasted red pepper but this is my new fav.

This was very good, with a little tweaking to suit your own taste. I ended up adding more garlic as well as a little more tahini. Next time, I will try some lime juice and omitting either the tomatoes or roasted peppers, and the cilantro. Sometimes less is more. Also, be sure to rinse the garbanzo beans before using.

Amazing dip! I loved this dip as did everyone who tried it. I only added one garlic clove as mine were huge. Slightly less tahini as I can find it overpowering in some hummus. I only added one roasted red pepper as I only had one left in the jar. I couldn't find the pepper in adobo in Australia so added some chopped jar jalepenos for spice. This may mean I didn't have the smoky flavour but we all still loved it.

Outstanding hummus. You and your guests will love the texture and flavor from this recipe. I made it for a party and everyone asked for the recipe. Serve with Naan or pita. I subsitute the liquid from the garbanzo beans for the water.

Very spicy.  Made one batch without the pepper, and it was too bland.  But mixing the two helped.  Mild and flavorful.
Could not find sun dried tomatoes anywhere, and that would have given it some good flavor.

A great recipe! I added more chipotle peppers and adobo sauce, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, and cilantro. I played with it till I thought it had enough flavor but I think I pretty much doubled up on all of it and I left off the sun-dried tomatoes. I made it last night and I'm going to make it again tonight. YUM!

I would have given it 5 stars but I wasn't completely happy with it's consistancy. It was mealy. I like a very creamy hoummus. No matter how much i blended it in my processor, I couldn't get that effect. Tasty though but a bir watery. Great combination of ingredients though.
