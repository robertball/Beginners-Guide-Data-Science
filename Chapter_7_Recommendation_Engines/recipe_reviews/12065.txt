After reading through the reviews I decided to give this one a shot, and it came out wonderful.  I made the following changes:

*added 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 2 cloves minced garlic and 2 tablespoons regular cream cheese
*used a full cup of fresh grated parmesan, no romano
*I whipped the egg with a little half-n-half and then added it a little at a time

Be sure to let the butter and cream simmer until it's a little thick, before proceeding.  Also, simmver over low heat at the end and keep stirring it.  I ended up with a highly delicious HEAVY alfredo sauce.

You can subtitute 2% milk for heavy cream, if you start with a roux of 1tbsp butter, 1tbsp flour. Good for reducing fat a bit, or if you realize at the last minute you don't have enough cream!

I liked this sauce, it had a nice, mild flavor.  My guests felt it lacked something, even though I minced and sauteed garlic and added it in.  Perhaps I would add a touch of garlic salt or garlic powder the next time.  Salt & pepper are definitely in order for this recipe.  Remember that anytime you are incorporating egg into a hot liquid, you need to take care that it doesn't immediately cook the egg so that you end up with tiny egg bits.  Take a small amount of the hot cheese/cream sauce (1/4 cup or so) and put it in a bowl.  Slowly add the egg yolk, stirring constantly.  Once you've mixed the egg with that small bit of hot cream sauce, you can add it all back into the pan.

*** Update.  Recently, I made this recipe and I used all parmesan cheese because that's what I had in the house.  What I used was shredded parmesan, rather than the container of grated parmesan (you know it, we all have it in the house).  What an amazing difference this made, the sauce was thick, rich, and amazing.  I went right out and bought the ingredients to make it a few more times!

People need to remember that restaurant style Alfredo Sauce is NOT LIKE the bottled stuff!  I had tried some homemade Alfredo Sauce recipes before this one, but none turned out as close to what I expected as this recipe did.  First, the taste was absolutely scrumptious!  I only used fresh grated parmesan cheese with no romano, as I did not have that on hand.  I also grated about 2 cloves of garlic in, which made the sauce, in addition to a little dried parsley flakes for color and texture.  I used half and half instead of cream, so I'm not sure how thick this would have turned out if I had used heavy cream.  Because I like my Alfredo Sauce just a little thicker than standard restaurant style sauce, I don't know if this sauce was just a bit thinner than I'd like because I used half-n-half or if maybe I could do something else besides adding more parmesan, which is what I did this time to thicken it up a bit.  Next time I'll use the parmesan and romano, real cream and I think I'll follow the advice given by several other reviewers by adding a tablespoon or two of whipped cream cheese - just to get the texture and thickness closer to what I want.  Hands down, this is the best homemade Alfredo Sauce recipe I found.

I wish there were more than 5 stars! This is THE BEST alfredo I have EVER made. It is SO easy and SO SO rich. Every person I have served it to has begged me for the recipe. I do not use any romano. It is too strong. Instead I doubled the parmesan and even added a 1/4 cup more! Break up the egg and add it in a slow steady stream. I had no problems with the sauce being too thin. Boil the cream mixture for a few minutes stiring constantly until it thickens up before you add the cheese. Try try try!

I made this sauce one night for a dinner party.  The next day I had to promise to send it out in emails to all that had it. It was a hit 7 times over. Very simple - Quick and easy to make. 
Thanks for helping make my dinner something my friends are still raving about. :)

This is so darned easy to make its unbelievable.  I'm a 19 year old male college student.  If I can make it - you can.  It works well if you use parmesan instead of the romano as well (just double the parmesan).  Tastes good too!

How pleased I am to see this recipe online, for it is the 'EGG YOLK' that gives 'Alfredo Sauce' that 'something' that is always missing from other Alfredo Sauce recipes that do not incorporate them.  In short, it is the 'EGG YOLK' that gives that 'restaurant' taste one is always looking for.  I cook my Sauce a little differently, but in method only. I whip my egg yolks for a minute first, ('plural' becasue I always make a double or triple Alfredo recipe), then, once the cream and butter are hot enough, I pour that mixture into the egg yolks to temper them. Back onto the stove at the lowest heat possible, I immediately add the cheeses just to melt, and then pour the Sauce right over whatever noodles I'm using.  Every single 'Alfredo Sacue' online that doesn't incorporate 'EGG YOLKS' cannot call itself a 'true' Alfredo and should, in my opinion, be thrown off the web! *lol*  Because 'Alfredo' is such a basic egg/cream sauce, you can tweek it to your heart's content... a little garlic, a little tarragon, a little basil, rosemary, or thyme... whatever is floating your boat at the moment.

This sauce smells so good, I knew this recipe was a winner before I even tasted it!  I added some cracked pepper, minced garlic and chopped Italian parsley and I was completely impressed with the flavor!  My second time around, I added steamed broccoli and carrots - YUM.  Thanks for sharing this one!!

I like the flavor.  I followed the recipe to a T.  Ive never understood how you can rate a recipe you changed before trying as written.  Anyway, this one was good.  No better or worse than any other I've had.  The all taste about the same to me.

I liked the flavor, but would like to find a smoother sauce.  Mine was a little watery.  Also, be sure to break that yolk and stir it quickly!

Used all parmesan, added lots of garlic and pepper, and doubled the recipe but only used one egg yolk.  Turned out perfect!  Will try using cheddar & jack cheeses instead of parmesan for a sinful mac & cheese.

Some tips if your sauce is runny or grainy:
1.  After adding the cream and spices to the melted butter, slowly heat the mixture until it starts to bubble.  
2.  Whisk it until it thickens slightly.  You will start to see lines on the bottom of the pan where the whisk has been.
3.  If you are using the egg yolk, stream it in while whisking vigorously now. Turn off the heat.
4.  Gradually add the cheese while whisking.  If your sauce is lumpy from partially melted cheese, turn the burner back on VERY LOW.  Using a low temperature to melt cheese results in a gooey texture instead of a grainy one.
5.  Enjoy!

This is the first sauce I have ever made, and I am a new cook -- as in, I had to look up the word "colander." It turned out better than what one gets in most restaurants. I will never buy sauce in a jar again.

I've been making this for years. It's so good and creamy and rich! It's the perfect recipe.

On a side note, tonight I made a boo boo. I didn't beat the egg yolks. Just dumped them in without thinking. So I'm stirring and stirring and thinking to myself. Why isn't that cheese melting. So finally I scoop the lump out and realize it's a completely cooked egg yolk. LOL

I've been making alfredo sauce for years, and this is top-notch, just the right amount of cream and a good zip from the cheese. I didn't have Romano so used just Parmesan; would probably have even more of an edge with the added Romano. Great consistency just as it is. Quick to make but with huge flavor. As the others say, definitely put the egg yolk in a small cup, add a few large spoons of sauce to it and blend well prior to mixing with the sauce. The egg WILL be cooked after combining with the sauce, it just won't consist of big yellow flecks! Favorite use for this is with gnocchi, cubed leftover ham and frozen peas & carrots that have been added to the gnocchi pot during the last minute of cooking. You can eat it just then, or place it in a casserole and bake it.

my bf and i made this the other night. we added spinach, some sundried-tomatoe cream cheese, and lots of garlic.  we agreed that it was probably one of the best sauces we'd ever had.  Amazing.  Although - we had a ton leftover and it wasn't as good when reheated.  It thickened up a lot too. We spread some of the leftovers onto pita bread (thats how much it thickened in the fridge lol)and baked it - made hot sandwiches - it was still amazing.. very good flavor.  This is going into the recipe box! :)

My husband and I have been married for three years and he has never raved about my meals as much as this one.  He LOVES meat, but this has become a favorite.  I just steamed some broccoli, califlower, carrots, and squash and placed them on the bed of pasta and poured the sauce over it. This recipe has become a regular for this family!

I loved this sauce and it was so easy to make.  I even added some chopped chicken breasts to the sauce and served over noodles.  I have made this sauce a couple of times now and it's a definite keeper.

I added mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers.  Then I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I also added shrimp and this is like one of a well known restaurants main dishes.

This recipe is a keeper!  I'm anxious to try it again using all of the ingredients listed in the recipe.  I made this on the fly and had to improvise with what I had on hand.  I also made some changes based on the reviews.  My whole family loved this - even my youngest who adamantly HATES alfredo.  I was expecting to give him leftover meatloaf, but everyone else was raving about the alfredo so he took a small taste and then filled up his plate! Here are my changes:  added 2 cloves of minced garlic, only used pecorino romano as I had no parmesan, used half-and-half in place of heavy cream.  I let the half-an-half and cheese cook a while so it would thicken as it was very thin, then spooned some of that into the egg so the egg would not cook.  I also added some fresh chopped parsley.  The sauce thickened very nicely, so I would hesitate to use heavy cream due to the added calories.  We loved this!

Made this sauce for a Spinach and Artichoke chicken lasagna, and it was a HUGE HIT with EVERYONE at my Christmas Eve dinner!! I did add some cream cheese to the sauce, and was amazed at the great flavor and texture it gave!! My husband has already asked for me to make another one!!

A very good recipe. Keys to this recipe are to use FRESH cheeses(grate it yourself). I recommend some chopped FRESH parsley over the top.

I was very disappointed; watery and dull; not rich and creamy.  I wouldn't do it again; altho' it was very easy.  I would take the time to make a better tasting alfredo sauce.

I am not the biggest fan of pasta but my family is.  I doubled this recipe.  When I was comparing recipes, this one looked the best to me but I did use 1/4 cup butter for the recipe as written and added parsley & garlic.  Garlic went in at the start with the butter and the fresh parsley 1 minute prior to serving.  I served it with a egg noodle tagitelli ~ absolutely wonderful!!  I served it with Spoon Rolls from this site and a thin cut chicken breast breaded in panko and rubbed thyme (dried).  I will repeat this meal for company adding a ceasar salad.

This is a rating on the original recipe, no alterations! It was hard to find the romano at the store, but I did, and I followed the directions exactly. It's sooo goood! It's mild like I like it, and tastes just like professional alfredo sauce. Like from a good restaurant, but less greasy. It has that hint of sweetness and the cheese balance is just fantastic. It's not overpowering and it's easy to appreciate. I've tried other recipes for it and it turns out heavy and greasy and makes me feel kind of gross afterwards, so this is great. Yum! Thanks!

I thought this was great! I added some minced garlic to the butter as it was melting, threw in extra parmesan because I didn't have romano, and a touch of flour. Super easy and yummy! Thanks for sharing

I thought this was excellent.  I did use some minced garlic in the butter as well as salt and pepper.  I used about 3/4 cups fresh grated Parmesan cheese (no Romano) and added a couple tablespoons of cream cheese, as others had suggested.  Made sure to temper the egg white before adding it to the sauce.   I didn't check the servings until after I made it, so I made another batch using 1/2 & 1/2 and then mixed the two batches.   I served over fettuccine with chicken and broccoli.

This is great in a tuna casserole. Note: The easiest way to make sure the egg doesn't curdle in the hot mixture is to beat the egg yolk slightly and add it when you add the whipping cream. That way the egg cooks along with the cream and butter and will not lump. This is good to remember when you are making puddings, cream pies, creme brulee, and any sauce that requires an egg.

The recipe didn't specify how much pasta to use.  I guess I used too much because the sauce basically disappeared into the pasta.  You should probably start out with a small amount of pasta with this sauce until you figure out on your own how much pasta you're able to coat with the sauce.

This was very good and very easy to make. I served it over spinach pasta - very tasty. One small caution when adding the egg yolk - turn down the heat to low and wisk/mix thoroughly to avoid egg yolk clump.

This was an ok simple alfredo sauce-a good base to add to. one tip though-mix the egg BEFORE adding to sauce (otherwise it will cook a little and be very chunky)

This was so easy for a first time sauce maker!  The only thing I should've done was made double sure the parmesan was melting because it was a little thick on the bottom.  My husband was so impressed I made it, he assumed it was store bought!

I added a tbs of cream cheese - which made it similar to Olive Garden but even better.  This is a fantastic, rich alfredo sauce, perfect with grilled garlic shrimp.  Very very good.

This sauce was easy to make and very creamy. I definitely recommend adding some cooled off sauce to the yolks before adding them to the whole pot. Get them to warm up slowly or else the yolks will cook too fast and harden. I added some garlic and shallots to kick it up a notch. I also mixed a tablespoon of flour with a 1/3 cup of the sauce and then added it to the pot to thicken it.

This sauce is AMAZING! I stay away from any recipe that is compaired to Olive Garden's alfredo as I think theirs is horrible. The other reviewers are spot on egg yolk and nutmeg do make this recipe top noch! If you are substituting milk for the heavy cream you will need to add some cornstarch to thicken it. I added garlic as well and did a mixture of odds and end cheeses that I needed to use up and it still was amazing. This is the only alfredo recipe I will use from now on. Do make sure to beat the yolks in a seperate bowl and add some of the cream mixture to them before you add into the pot to ensure a smooth texture. Enjoy!

OMG so good! I would def. say this is better than Olive Garden. It took me no time to make and I even subbed the heavy cream with whole milk so I didn't have to make a trip to the store. I started with 1 tbl of flour and 1 tbl of butter to account for the substitution as another reviewer recommended. This will become a bi-weekly favorite for sure.

This recipe was fabulous. It tasted really good. For those that said it tasted bland, add the garlic like someone previously recommended about a tsp of sugar and a dash of white pepper.

Awesome! I was skeptical about the egg, however it turned out so well- deffinatly temper it first those as suggested by another reveiwer. I only wish this recipe were low cal!  I sauted sliced baby bella mushrooms and shrimp in garlic and butter and tossed that with fresh fettuccine and the alfredo sauce.  I also used 4 oz. Buttoni Brand pre shredded Parmesan cheese (no Romano)!  It was muy bueno!  Thank you for the newest addition to my favorites list.

fantasic recipe.  added 3 cloves garlic, and other than that, followed exactly.  I used fresh grated romano and parm, and whisked the yolk in at the end. It thickened beautifully. Will most definately make again.  Make sure you use the nutmeg though, as I almost omitted it thinking it was weird, but it really made the sauce!

DELICIUOS! I loved this recipe. I will never buy alfredo sauce again. I have pasta at least once a week, so I made a HUGE batch and bottled it in mason jars so that they will last a long time, and I just have to grab a jar and heat it. I will be giving it to my friends, as they love my pasta and the sauce. I already have to give 5 away! Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I accidently spilled 1/2 jar of the Classico four chees sauce and had to make up the difference.  This recipe was so good that I threw out the rest of the jar!  I added about 2 tbs of Temptee Whipped Cream Cheese,used a cup of milk instead of cream (because that's all I had) and it turned out great.  Next time, I will try it with the heavy cream.

I love this sauce. I never liked alfredo until my husband made this for us one night and I was hooked. The flavor is incredible and the consistency has always been just right. Sometimes we just add a little shredded cooked chicken and that helps with consistency. My husband often doubles the recipe and he stresses that heavy whipping cream be used rather than regular whiping cream. Also, beat the egg before adding and stir it immediately after adding so that there are no egg chunks. It's definitely not for those watching their calories or waistline but it is worth the indulgence once in a while. In all honesty, I haven't found a restaurant, canned, or alternative alfredo that can match this one.

Sauce tastes great, but use fresh cheeses, not the kind in the shaker can you get off the shelf.

The egg yolk is the key to the richness. This is how the chefs made the alfredo in the private country club restaurant where I used to work... so good and so easy. They used to just put the egg yolks right into the carton of cream and shake it up. I did that and whisked it straight into the pan of butter/garlic. I also used only parm. My husband, who hates parm, and son, who has never been a fan of alfredo both love, love, loved it!

When I saw nutmeg in the ingredient list I knew this was the one to make. This is the real deal! My husband is overjoyed that I'm making this homemade now, and so am I. Alfredo sauce in the jar has this oily, gross texture and a fake taste to me. But I get it because my husband loves alfredo and I never bothered to learn how to make it since it's not something I eat a lot of. For health reasons, I still won't eat a lot of it but that has nothing to do with this recipe. If you want easy, genuine alfredo, this is the recipe to try.

WARNING: May be habit forming.
I have made this a few times now and this recipe is fantastic! I use Parmesan cheese only and do add 1 small clove of garlic when melting the butter. My kids and I love drowning the veggies and fettuccine in it. Not something you want to make on a weekly basis, unless you are trying to gain weight. Love it.

It was simple and great tasting.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used a reviewer idea about using the milk I had on hand with a tablespoon of butter and flour.  I did add one glove of garlic and a tablespoon of onion as a made the milk mixture to add more flavor!  I know people hate when people add or change, but those suggestions have helped me out in the past so oh well...

Super fabulous! While I was tasting it, I was afraid the sauce was too salty. However, I mixed it in with some cheese ravioli and veggies, and it balanced out very nicely! Well done with this recipe. Definitely a staple for my recipe books.

This is my go-to recipe for alfredo sauce. I make it as writtten every time with two exceptions. I use all parmesan because I never have romano on hand. Second, I think it's sinful to make alfredo without some minced garlic and a little pepper, but that's just personal taste ;). The egg yolks can be left out altogether if you're really having trouble with egg yolk bits in your sauce. I usually have my hubby either pour or stir really fast when I add mine.

This is my "go to" for birthdays and special occasions. I do make a couple of changes. Because of the salt content of the hard cheeses, I use unsalted butter. I saute one clove of minced garlic in half of the butter before adding the rest. Make sure you never bring this to a boil, as the cheese will separate. Temper the egg yolk before adding(mix in about half a cup of the warm sauce, also separate the yolks and leave on the counter at the beginning of prep to let them get to room temp). I add a couple of pinches of nutmeg(instead of just one) because it gives it that "something special" taste. The better quality cheese you use the better your sauce will turn out.

I read the reviews.  1 never, ever add salt to taste to Alfredo Sauce.  The cheese already has a lot of salt in it.  2.  Always use unsalted butter, and egg yolk in Alfredo?   I use 1/8 garlic powder, pinch nutmeg and 1/8 white pepper only.  Increase the butter to 1/2 cup and use a wisk, always stirring. 3. When you add the cheese turn off the heat and keep wisking until smooth no lumps.  Sauce is thin, add little more cheese.  I use 1  cup of freshly grated parmigiano.  Maybe that is why I don't use an egg yolk.

This was restaurant quality sauce.  Did not have parmesan but used Loccateli Romano.  Sooo good.  Do not put the meat in the sauce.  Add it to the plated noodles and sauce.  Yum!

Awesome recipe! The only thing I added was a couple cloves of garlic. As another reviewer suggested, I took out 1/4 cup of the cream mixture and mixed it with the egg yolk before dumping it all back together.

Loved it!  I used freshly grated parmesan because I don't like grainy sauce.  Melted so smoothly.  Tempered the egg yolk and it thickened the sauce beautifully.  Tasted just like a restaurant, minus the graininess :)

I've made several alfredo sauces and this is by far the best! I did not have Romano, so I doubled the amount of Parmesan.  I think garlic is a must for alfredo, so I added a clove of chopped garlic.  Delicious!!!

This is a really nice recipe.  The only thing I would do differently is to maybe add a little black pepper to it.  It made up easily, although I did have a couple of moments when I was not sure.  The first was that my cheese formed a huge lump, which did eventually dissolve, as I kept stirring.  The other is that I was leery of putting the egg yolk in whole, so I did beat it lightly and made sure I was stirring as I poured it in, since eggs tend to curdle when put into hot mixtures.   I did do one thing different - I decided to double the recipe after I realized it made only two servings, and had to use milk for the other half of the liquid.  The sauce still came out very nice, and I may do that next time, too.  Actually, for our tastes, doubling the sauce made enough for 6 servings.  My husband and I both like this sauce better than the one I used to make which was from my favorite chef!  I made the sauce for linguine, to go with the baked garlic-parmesan chicken from this site.  A perfect combination.  Thanks for a great recipe.  We will be making it again.

OhMyGawd.  If I could, I'd rate this 1,000 starts.  It's absolutely amazing.  I did add garlic and used only Parmesean cheese {no Romano}.  I wanted to drink this sauce straight!  LOL

I made this one night while nine months pregnant because I had a craving for fettucine alfredo. I had to alter the recipe a little bit. Since I did not have heavy whipping cream I substitued half & half and added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to make it thicker since I was afraid the sauce might come out too soupy otherwise. I also put in 1/2 cup of parmesean since I had no romano but from reading the other reviews others did the same to suit their tastes. I added one clove of garlic, a dash of black pepper, and some parsley (I didn't measure it but I would say it was approx. 1/2 teaspoon). This I believe made it taste really good. When I first took a bite of my fettucine alfredo my first thought was that I was glad I added in the garlic, it gave it just the right amount of extra flavor and seemed to complemented the other seasonings well. The sauce came out thick, which is what I like, and was creamy. Very yummy and I would definately make this again, as a matter of fact it will probably be my lunch tomorrow. Very easy to make too, it took more time to cook the pasta than to make the sauce.

I would give this recipe 5 stars with the addition of sauteed garlic.  I mean, how can you make a classic italian sauce without garlic?  So, changes I made were: added 3 cloves garlic (I know, that's a lot but I love it), used only parmesan cheese, and added 2 oz cream cheese to make the sauce a little creamier.  In my humble opinion, a perfect recipe.  As other reviewers mentioned I made sure to slowly add some of the warm sauce to my egg before adding it to the sauce.  Next time, I'll add some fresh parsley as well.  This will be our standard alfredo sauce from now on.

I tried this recipe out with my boyfriend, and I found it very easy to make and a delicious meal. I work in a restaurant, and this alfredo sauce was easily better than the one they serve there.  I used milk instead of heavy cream though, and started with a roux of 1Tbs butter/1Tbs flour. Mostly because I didn't have cream.

Had this for dinner last night and it was good, but did make some adjustments.  Didn't have cream, so used half and half.  Started out melting the 3 tbs of butter and a tbs of cream cheese in skillet and then added in the half and half and let thicken.  Chopped up 3 cloves of garlic and added to the mix along with the nutmeg, ground black pepper, a pinch of white pepper and a few drops of lemon juice.  For the cheese I just added 3/4 cup of a shredded mix of asiago, provolone, parmesan and mozzarella.  Next I added in the egg yolk and let it simmer.  To achieve a less thick sauce I added a tsp of the noodle water and also the rest of the leftover stick of butter from the 3 tbs I had used.  This created a decadent sauce that worked very well over the noodles and had such nice flavor.  Topped with fresh parsley and fresh grated parmiggano reggiano.

The flavor was great, the texture wasn't.  I think because I used the cheap bottled grated cheese, it was very gritty!  The fresh shredded Parmesan I added melted smooth. I used half and half and added probably another 1/3 cup of real shredded Parmesan, which made for a decent thickness.  Edited to add: Tried this again with fresh grated cheeses, and still gritty.  Must be the Romano. I'd skip it next time to achieve a smooth sauce.

This was a great, basic alfredo recipe, much better than others I have tried.  I altered it slightly, adding three cloves of minced garlic to the butter for about 2 minutes, before stirring in the cream, cheese, etc.  I also threw in some chopped fresh spinach towards the end.  I had earlier diced fresh chicken and cooked it up in a little garlic, salt, and pepper, and then added this in right at the end to warm it back up again.  It was wonderful!  My husband, who isn't a huge pasta fan, asked for seconds and even took it for lunch the next day!

The sauce tasted great, authentic alfredo taste. I changed the romano to mozzarella just out of personal preference. Definately add 2 chopped garlic cloves. I forgot to add the cream cheese like some people said to do but the sauce came out great. If it becomes to thick just add some milk to thin it out a little.

This came out well.  The only things I did different were:
1. Finely mince two garlic cloves and simmer briefly in the melted butter over low heat (lowest setting on the larger of my gas burners, so perhaps more like med-low), prior to whisking in  the cream,  freshly grated nutmeg and white pepper.  I did not add salt, as the cheeses can be salty and all I had on hand was regular, salted butter, but this is a personal preference. 
2. Sprinkle in the cheeses a little at a time until fully melted, simmering and whisking a couple of minutes until smooth.
3.  Whisk the yolk in a separate bowl and slowly temper it with the hot cheese sauce, to prevent curdling, then add back to the main pan and heat thru another minute or two to fully "cook" the egg. No high heat or it might curdle/separate!
I wonder if those who had clumping or incorporation issues  used higher heat, curdling  the eggs and cheese?

Total awesome sauce. Delicious, rich taste but not too heavy, and stands up well to minor variations: for example, I've done it with aged Asiago as the only cheese and without the egg (based on what I had), threw in some lightly fried guanciale, and served over linguine. One warning: it's so amazingly simple and tasty, you'll never use store-bought stuff again.

I loved this, it tastes wonderful and is so easy to make.  As someone else mentioned, be sure to use good cheese, not the sprinkle stuff , it TRULLY makes a big difference in the texture. I have made it per the recipe, and I have made it with a bit of minced shallot, not that it needed it, just because I really like the added flavor. Thanks for such an easy delicious recipe!

This recipe is excellent but it you chop some chicken into chunks and lightly cook them with a teaspoon of garlic and then add it to the simmering sauce when there's  2 minutes left on the timer it adds more flavor.

I've made this recipe for YEARS and love it! I also use it as a base for my cheese sauce in Turkey Tetrazinni, My Philly Cheesesteaks and to top baked potatoes with  broccoli and cheese sauce. I just add 1/4 cup of shredded Mozzarella, Provolone & Asiago or a good store bought blend containing that blend. It's delicious & easy!

Although I did like the original recipe, after I made a few changes it turned out fabulous! I only used parmesan cheese, added three cloves of minced garlic, salt and pepper to taste and then I added parley flakes (about 3 tablespoons). This recipe is very quick and easy and VERY good!

This recipe is AMAAAAAZING!!!! I made this for the first time last night for my hubby and son.  They could not get enough!  My husband is not a big alfredo sauce person, but I have definitely changed his mind!!  Thank you so much for sharing!  Oh...I also added a little cream cheese because I prefer my sauce a little thicker. :-)

This Alfredo sauce came out fantastic. I didn't have Romano so I just doubled the amount of Parmesean and added a little fresh Parsley. Awesome.

This recipe is as delicious as it is simple to make. I use fine grated Parmesan only, as I do not keep Romano cheese.

I LOVE THIS SAUCE!!  I have been looking for a sauce like the restaurants and this is it!!  I did add minced garlic to the sauce and it is perfect!  I either serve this with pan seared chicken seasoned with garlic salt and pepper or shrimp.

I think one thing that you must note when making alfredo is to NEVER use pre shredded cheeses.  They add something to them to make them not clump this causes your cheese to not melt nicely and is clumpy and will not thicken. As for the flavor I am not huge on nutmeg so I omitted.  Also I LOVE garlic so I sauted a little garlic in the butter before adding everything else.

This recipe is phenomenal, but I do tweak it a little. I add garlic to taste and double the recipe, using 1/3 c parmesan, 1/3 c romano, and 1/3 c asiago.  Asiago takes forever to melt (and frankly some of it never will), so here's how I deal with that: I cook it longer, over lower heat than the recipe suggests, and then when as much of the asiago has melted that WILL melt, I take the sauce off the heat and force it through a fine mesh strainer or chinois to get rid of the lumps. Yes, it's kind of a pain to do this, but the asiago adds such a nice dimension to the flavor that it's totally worth the effort!

This is the first homemade alfredo sauce I have ever made, and I LOVED it! I was surprised by how easy it was. 
Things I did differently were, I followed what some others said by just using parmesan, I added an extra 1/4 cup as well, and I added 2 cloves of garlic. 
I served it over fettuccini noodles with some smoked turkey sausage (because my man wont eat anything without meat!) and sauteed mushrooms. SO good!
I wont make alfredo out of a can again.

This sauce needed a lot of doctoring and it still tasted like it was missing something. I didn't like the gritty texture that the parmesan gave this sauce.

Just made this recipe and I'd have to say it's pretty good. Taste is very similar to a few popular restaurants in town. I did find it a bit salty most likely due to the romano cheese, but then again,  I am very salt sensitive so other may not find this salty. I did make a crucial mistake while making this though, I let the sauce briefly start to boil over and this made the cheese turn grainy. Make sure you keep the mixture on low heat until the cheese has all melted!

I was looking for something a little richer and thicker. It could be my fault 'cause I was a little short on the cream and added a little half and half. Also, I think I'll try using a little more butter. I will, however,  be giving this another try. Thank you!

I really liked this and so did my alfredo loving daughter.  I mixed it up quickly at lunch and served over frozen ravioli.  Yummy!  Oh, I used milk because it was all I had and we still loved it.  Not as authentic but a little healthier. :)

I make this at least once a month. I don't use nutmeg and I add a tablespoon of flour to thicken it up a bit. I found that without the flour it was too watery. I also took the recommendation to whisk the egg yolk before adding it to the sauce because you
 will end up finding "scrammbled eggs" in the sauce. I also add sea salt, ground black pepper and garlic salt to add more flavor.

I love this. It is quick and easy when making for a family of 4 on weeknight.  I have also made for a big party of 30 and there was none left.   I added garlic to the butter, omittted the Romano and doubled the Parmesean cheese and left of the nutmeg.  Still tastes just as good.

I had never made Alfredo sauce before and was pretty nervous, but this recipe is great! My family loved it! I did add garlic powder instead of the ground nutmeg, but other than that I follow the recipe. I also made Grilled Garlic and Herb Shrimp to go with it. Prefect combo!

This was an easy, tasty recipe!  Simple enough for a week night.  I added in one cup of peas and about 5 slices of prosciutto that was cooked until crispy (cook for 5 minutes at 350 degrees on a cookie sheet with a quick spray of non-stick spray - once it cools it's crispy).  Delish!

Really good sauce.  It needs to simmer for quite a while before you serve it because parm cheese doesn't melt well.  Saw a suggestion of using gruyere cheese instead, I will try that.  I also used asiago instead of romano.

My family LOVED it! I added some lemon pepper, garlic pepper, season salt, and one slice of American cheese. I had enough for about five adults.

Super easy and very delicious! I made this recipe tonight on a fluke because it was the only one I had all of the ingredients for but I was delightfully surprised. It was very rich and filling - even the kids loved it. 

I did use only parmesan (doubled) and will definitely be adding some garlic next time. But there will definitely be a next time since it was such an easy to follow and delicious recipe.

Thank you for sharing it! :) xo

I love alfredo sauce but never ate it at home because the bottled stuff is all TERRIBLE!  I also thought it would be hard to make a good home made sauce.  This recipe proved me wrong!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was super easy and so delicious.  I will continue to use this recipe and experiement with other ingredients (just because that's what I do ;-)

Made 10 servings, a little much for 10 people. However, this was an amazing alfredo sauce. I did add a little garlic powder but other than that did not change the recipe. This sauce does need attention when you are melting the cheese so it doesnt burn on the bottom but the end results are worth it!! I used both cheeses and didnt find the Romano to be overpowering. Definitely give this a try, its worth it!!!

I just could not get the cheeses to melt.  The flavor was also a little heavy/overpowering for me.

I made this for a crowd. Everyone said it was awesome. I actually made one batch of sauce and then divided it between Chicken with Fettuccine and Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta. I was also running short on time so I made it in a hurry. I don't think I made it right. The Shrimp sauced up good but the Chicken dried out. It did taste better than a jar sauce but presentation was another story. I will make this again but only on a smaller scale so I can make it right. I did add garlic and cream cheese as other reviewers suggested.

I love alfredo sauce, but, have never made it myself. This recipe in my opinion is great! In fact Im eating it right now as I rate it!! Yum!! :)  It was fast and basically easy. I doubled the recipe which is needed for more than 2 servings. I did not have heavy cream avail, so I used 1/2 and 1/2, I also pressed one garlic clove into the sauce as it cooked, I found one clove to be sufficient for my taste, I thought anymore would have been too garlicky... Im sure I added more than a cup of both cheeses, I just grated som extra in as it cooked and it thickened up nicely. Looking forward to getting some broccoli and chicken next time. Its a keeper and will keep me out of restaurants for awhile! Thanks for sharing your recipe.!  :)

This was good, I made a couple of changes to the recipe.  I added one clove of finely minced garlic (sauteed to cut the strong flavor) and substituted a can of Evaporated Milk instead of cream.  I also substituted 1/4 cup Gruyere for the Romano cheese.  Family loved it!

I've made this twice now. I think this is a great base, but like most others I read the rewviews and made a few changes. I dropped the romano cheese (don't really care for the flavor) and doubled up on the shredded parmesan. I added a 1/4 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 tsp fresh cracked pepper, 1 crushed medium garlic clove (I did two the first time and that's all you could taste), 3 tbsp plain cream cheese, and 2 tsp of all purpose flour. The flour really made it thicken up! 

Like others have mentioned I whipped the egg yolk with a splash of heavey cream then slowly added a small amount of the hot cream while stirring before returning all to the pot. If you just dump it in you'll end up with cooked egg bits throughout. I put it all on fresh made pasta and topped with crushed red chili flakes. It was awesome! 

This recipe is also great when topped with two boneless-skinless chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces, then fried in a splash of olive oil, a touch of garlic powder and a sprinkling of crushed red chili flakes. OH man!

This was a quite good alfredo. I did make a few alterations: I crushed a few cloves of garlic and dropped them in there while the cream simmered, and I simmered the sauce a lot longer than called for. It thickened up really nicely after about 15 minutes, but 3-5 minutes in it was still too thin to stick to pasta. I used mine in an experiment involving eggplant parmesan with alfredo instead of red sauce, and it turned out really well!

We sopped up the leftovers with the bread, because this had fanastic flavor. I wondered about the egg yolk, since the consistency was looking fine to me before that addition. But I went with the recipe, and sure enough, the egg really richens the sauce. The only variation I made was to use garlic salt in place of regular salt. Probably a little garlic on its own would be yummy, too. Way better than a jar sauce and so easy!

This sauce was awesome! My niece and I made it together (since she LOVES alfredo sauce with pasta). She had fun grating the block of Parmesan cheese :) but I did do some changes and took some suggestions the others made. I bought 32 ounces of whipping cream to make alot. I added 8 garlic cloves I minced (let that cook with the 12 tablespoons of melted butter), 8 tablespoons of cream cheese, parsley and some scallions for garnish. It was delicious! Both my husband and niece said it tasted restaurant style! I also served it with a side of garlic bread. YUM!!     Oh and I also left out the Romano cheese and put in 5 cups of Parmesan cheese!

This is a really good recipe. I only gave it 4 stars though as it was rather bland. I made as directed minus the egg yolk and then added 2 cloves of garlic (minced), a half tsp of parsley, oregano, basil and thyme. (each) My suggestion is add the herbs/spices you like and taste test the sauce before you simmer for the 3-5 minutes.  The additions I made to recipe made it a 5 star in my family and we will be using this as our staple recipe for fettachine.

Delicious!!! I make this at least once a month with fetuccini, chicken, and broccoli. My whole family loves it. And I just buy a package of shredded "Italian cheese blend" from walmart, since it's SO much cheaper than the grated parmesean. And it still comes out awesome

Pretty easy sauce!  As is, it only tastes like a '4', but the goods are all there so I'll give it a '5'.  I decided to add garlic powder and pepper, but those are just my taste buds.  Served with gnocchi and sauteed chicken - delish!

This was excellent.  I didn't have cream, so I used another reviewers suggestion and used milk/butter/flour.

This tasted really great, but mine came out very thin even though I used heavy cream and grated parmesan. I used a tip from another reviewer about taking 1/4 cup of the sauce and putting it in a separate bowl and combining the egg yolk with that amount, stirring it together, then putting the egg yolk sauce mixture back in the main pot. Overall, I thought this was very good and I will most likely make it again despite its thin consistency.

OMG! This was so delicious and simple. I just used parmesan instead of romano and added minced garlic to my butter when cooking,  but it was absolutely delicious! Thanks!!

Absolutely delicious! I used a full cup of Parmesan instead of with the Romano. I also seared some chicken with salt, pepper, oregano, and chicken seasoning and added the cooked chicken to the pasta just before topping it off with the sauce. It exceeded my expectations. Now I will tweak this recipe as I experiment with alfredo sauces, because this was the perfect start.

The only thing that I do differently is garlic.  Powder or fresh which ever you prefer.  Of course use it to your tastes.

DELICIOUS!!!! My family raved about this. I made it to go on top of shell pasta with shrimp. It was so good. I upped the serving to 6 and it was the perfect measurement. It is EXTREMELY important to temper the eggs before you put into the hot sauce or else you will end up with scrambled eggs. Thank you very much! This will be my alfredo sauce of choice from now on.

My husband doesn't like alfredo sauce but he loved this.  It is so easy to make.  I use home made noodles and have added chicken and shrimp the two different times I have made it.  Both were great.

I finally decided to try making my own alfredo sauce, and picked this recipe.  (And I'll never go back!)  After reading a few other reviews, I doubled the recipe, and made just 3 small changes.  1) I didn't have quite enough heavy cream, so I used some half and half also.  2) While melting the butter in the saucepan, I added about 2 cloves of diced garlic.  3) I used only parmesan cheese.  I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!  It was SO good!  Scrumptious!!  I'm craving it again just typing about it!  :)  It was easier than I expected it to be, and the results were fantastic!!  The texture was great for me - definitely not too thin or watery as others' turned out.  It was thick but smooth and creamy, and the flavor was rich and full, but not overpowering.  I did take the advice of a reviewer not to add the egg yolks in directly, but to mix them with some of the sauce in a separate dish, and add it all back in together.  Also, when adding any ingredient, I added it SLOWLY, while stirring.  I'm SO glad I found and tried this recipe - I'll use it over and over - it got RAVE reviews around our table!  Thanks for sharing!  My alfredo-eating life has been changed!

This sauce turned out very good. The reason I am only giving it 4 stars is because I changed it a bit by using all parmesan, not romano, and I doubled it, so I was going to use 2 egg yolks, but ended up only using 1 1/2 ( if that makes sense)and I'm glad I did because I think it would have been to "eggy" for my own personal preference. I also didn't have any problems with blending the egg into the sauce, I recommend having the heat low while doing this.  I think this may prevent the eggs from scrambeling and not blending properly. I will definitely use this recipe again.

It got raves by my family and friends! I give this 5 stars,but it needed a little bit of garlic, parsley flakes and cream cheese, as suggested by other reviews. It was easy and delicious! I can see using this recipe for years! I used it to top organic whole wheat pasta, chicken breast and organic broccoli, for a complete healthy meal!

Very good!  I was sure to add some garlic powder and a couple tbsps of cream cheese- a worthy addition.  I add fresh parsley to all my sauces, so I did that too, which is also very nice.

I used to cook for a well know Chicago Italian restaurant. This is the recipe they use to a T! You can even mix all the ingred together and heat stirring constantly over low-med heat until thick. Romano is KEY for flavor! (if you use only parm, it will be bland) Nutmeg brings out the creaminess and also importaint!. If you want this thicker, add 1 extra yolk.  It really does not change the flavor and will thicken much more, and quicker. (we did that on really busy nights:) You can use any pasta and add broccoli, garlic, shrimp, chicken... anything you might want! The possiblities are endless! YUM!!!!! try this recipe! I NEVER had this sauce break once! Belive me I have made this sauce HUNDREDS of times! Stirring constantly over a med or low heat will do the trick! TRY THIS YOU WILL LOVE IT!

Very easy and REALLY delicious.  I didn't have heavy cream, so I used FF half and half, and it was still very thick and creamy!  I will definitely add this to my frequent dinner line-up.

This recipe tasted fantastic! It smelled wonderful and it had a great color. The only drawback was that is was VERY thick. Too thick,  I think. Next time I make this, I will definitely cut back on the cheese a little. I used 1/2 cup fresh Parmesan (yeah, the good stuff) because I didn't have Romano and it was very rich and very creamy. Great recipe though! It had good flavor!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!!! I have never been so please with a recipe that I have made a comment before but I just HAD to.  I am eating the leftovers of the dish right now.  I made it exactly like stated except traded garlic powder for salt.  Make sure you DO infact use fresh nutmeg, the taste is like no other. Thank you so much!

Wow. I made this using 1% milk (added a tiny touch of cornstarch to thicken it), let it simmer 2-3 minutes with just the butter, stirring constantly, and I am totally blown away by how great it turned out. I love the nutmeg... and romano cheese, my favourite! Thanks for the recipe - never did my alfredo sauce come out so well - no need to buy it anymore! :)

I thought this was a great basic sauce. It was my first time making alfredo from scratch and it came out really well. Thanks to the reviewer below who suggested separating some of the sauce, mixing the egg yolk into that, and then readding it. My husband and I both enjoyed it. We serve it over portobello stuffed tortelloni so the flavoring was perfect. However, if using plain pasta then some spices may be desired.

Halved the recipe (just me) and poured the sauce over fusilli, yummy!! First of all, sautéed 2 huge finely chopped garlic cloves. Added chicken breast cut into bite-sized chunks and cooked for about 5 min. Then added the heavy cream and the rest of the ingredients. Substituted emmental cheese for the romano that the recipe called for. Sprinkled with dried parsley plus a dash of granulated garlic (hehe, i do love garlic!!). Next time i'll left out the egg yolk. Thanx!

Delicious! The FRESH grated parmesean is the key to making this one. Don't try to use the pre-grated stuff in the shaker, or your sauce will be very dry, lumpy, and ruined.

Yum!  There's a restaurant in Chicago that has the best Alfredo sauce in the world.  This is a very close second.  I added a little diced garlic to the butter at the beginning, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was delicious!

The nutmeg lends a wildly sophisticated flavor to this sauce.  The cream is really heavy, so I used half milk.  I also added mushrooms, and I don't think the sauce would survive w/ out some extra texture.  Very nice flavor!

Great base to start from.  Added some mushrooms, spinach and broccoli in some white wine and butter and added to the alfredo.  Then added some black olives directly to the sauce.  Awsome.

Wow, this was so easy to make and it tastes delicious. I also added a pinch of black pepper and used the whole egg instead of just the yolk. It gives more protein. I beat the egg, than added a little of the hot cream/butter mixture to it and added it slowly back to the pot. After cooking a couple minutes it looked grainy and wasn't smooth so I pureed it and it came out perfect. Yummy. My picky 3 year old gobbled it up.

Best Alfredo sauce ever. I followed the advice of other members. I used cream cheese and parmesan. I also added some pepper and garlic. I used sundried-tomato-pasta.        And I added some shrimps. Wow. What a meal. Very rich and tasty. Thanks.

As recommended by others, I added 1/4 C. whipped cream cheese and 1 clove of garlic. I only used parm and the recipe turned out great. Served with 8oz (about) fettuccine, asparagus and grill sliced chicken breat on top. Easy and quick!

THANK YOU - I have been searching for an Alfredo recipe of this standard!  Will admit I tweaked it by adding a clove or two of minced garlic and about 1/2 cup of whipped cream cheese and it was perfect!

Very quick, very easy.  This recipe is simple to alter - it can handle a lot of changes.  I made it with a lot less cheese and a little less cream.  PERFECT!

Made the alfredo sauce according to recipe and it came out perfect.  However, I would omit the salt altogether.  Other than that, it was a success!  Thank you.

I have tried several sauces on this site but this one was by far the best tasting, the sauce was thick and creamy unlike other sauces that were watery.

This was SUPER tasty, even after reading the reviews I was still surprised. I used the kraft grated parmesan cheese you put on spaghetti and it turned out a little grainy so I'll use better quality cheese next time. When you cook this, make sure that you have people to share it with because you'll want to eat the entire pot.

Made this for dinner yesterday and had leftovers for lunch. Awesome ! Better than the other popular version I tried from this site. Added lots of garlic to the melted butter before adding the cream. Also, used shredded parmesan, had no problems with cheese not melting. Do the "tempering" with the egg yolk.Added it to sauteed mushrooms,carrots,zucchini and cooked pasta.Will dafinately make again. Thx Mason !

I am a connoisseur of alfredo, and I just want to say that this is the BEST alfredo I have ever made or tasted.  I have been using the recipe for over a year  now and everyone I make it for loves it and wants the recipe!!  I have still not found any recipe to compare to it and I have tried tons of recipes.... By the way, I made just like in the directions and it was thick and cheesy.. PERFECT recipe!!

AMAZING! This is by far the best Alfredo sauce I have ever had. I let the cream simmer and thicken quite a bit before I added the cheese. I also used about 4 oz more of Parm cheese and no Ram

The sauce was excellent!  I omitted the egg since it sounded tricky and didn't seem necessary.  I also doubled the parmesan and omitted the romano based on what I had on hand.  I used it as the base for a white pizza, and it came out perfect.  This sauce had the perfect consistency.

My 4 yr. old had two helpings of pasta and this sauce!! She loved it!! Next time, I would add a bit of sauce to the scrambled egg yolks in an effort to "temper" the eggs to they won't get cooked into yellow tiny bits. Or maybe, I'll take someone's advice (above) and omit the yolks.

The only alfredo sauce recipe I will use from now on!  I didn't have heavy cream on hand, so I made a roux of 2 tbsp flour & 2 tbsp butter (since I doubled the recipe), and used 2% milk.  I also didn't have Nutmeg, and only used Parmesan cheese.  It was still very very tasty.  Even my picky boys absolutely loved it.

Loved this. I'm not a big fan of Alfredo but this was good. I added a hair of white wine and the pepper like someone else said. I think I let it cook down a little too much though. It was very thick. But the taste was great. Put it over fettuccine, chicken, and broccoli.

Gotta use the fresh nutmeg.  I would say half a pinch to a pinch is plenty.  I did use half n half instead of heavy cream and slightly less butter.

This was amazing. I didn't have any heavy whipping cream on hand, so used half and half instead. Also didn't have romano cheese so I used havarti for that, and threw in some garlic. I think I really liked the lack of flour in this recipe.

The ONLY good alfredo sauce always has egg yolks. I have tried making so many others without the eggs and it is never as creamy or as luscious and silky. Excellent!

Made this last night to go with left over grilled chicken.  This was better than anything I've had in a restaurant and so fast and easy.  I had GOOD cheese in a block, both parmesan and pecorrino romano, that I grated myself.  I made sure to grate the parmesan fine as some reviews said the parmesan makes the sauce grainy.  It took a little longer to thicken up than I expected but I was careful with the heat.  Turned out perfect, creamy, and so delicious. Hubby and teenager agreed.  This will be a regular.  Can't wait to try it with peas and proscuitto, or fresh broccoli. Add garlic bread and a glass of wine and this is heavenly.

I just whipped this up for my daughter for a quick lunch. It is fab~!
Just freshly grated parmesan and I used half & half as I always have that on hand. I added a couple tbsps. of flour to the butter and half & half, just to thicken. It is very rich, thick and creamy! 
Just a hint...use very salty water for the pasta and use a bit, about 3/4 cup to temper the egg yolk prior to adding to the sauce. Just let it cool then slowly whip in the egg yolk. Delicious~!

This recipe for Alfredo sauce was good, but I made some changes. Changes that make your taste buds explode. I didn't have Parmesan or Romano cheese, so I used All Cheddar cheese. Also, when I used the salt and nutmeg, I put in a sprinkle of garlic powder, a sprinkle of ground cloves, and a sprinkle of oregano. Add some shrimp to it to. DELICIOUS!!! It may be a little bit junkier, but it sure was delicious.

Very good! After making this sauce we followed the Peppered shrimp alfredo recipe and used this sauce instead of the jar alfredo sauce it calls for. So very good!

My family gave this three thumbs up! Comments include, "This is the best sauce ever!" Only thing I did slightly different was add more Parmesan and Romano cheese for a richer flavor. Next time - I'm going to double the recipe!

I followed the directions to the T and added a few different things. No Romano (didn't have any LOL) and fresh chopped garlic simmering in the butter until it melted. It came out a little thick when I did it (used heavy crm) but I added a little bit of milk and that helped. I loved it and so did my husband!

Very good sauce that is very versatile.  I did not have nutmeg and instead used thyme and basil.  I used only parmesan.  It turned out great and my picky four year old devoured it.  Will definitely make it again.

My sister, my sister's boyfriend, and I all loved it! It was the best alfredo we have ever made!! Unfortunately, I made it for my boyfriend and he did not like it at all. He said the texture made it inedible. :( It was pretty embarrassing. I wonder what I did wrong??

Excellent recipe! I use it nearly once a week. The trick to the recipe is to keep stirring. I have used both heavy whipping cream and half and half. Both work great and I did not notice a different in taste or texture. I always have an Italian blend of freshly grated cheeses on hand that contains parmesan, romano, and asiago- I use a 1/2 cup of this instead. I always add salt and pepper. I believe the pinch of nutmeg really makes this recipe stand out.

Extremely easy. Fixed it last night over linguini and watched it disappear. The only thing I did was to change the number of servings. Will definitely use again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  I've been looking for something differant other than how I usually make alfredo sauce which is with cream cheese, I thought this recipe was really rich,and tasted great!  I used half n half instead of heavy whipping cream, and added some garlic powder and it turned out great.  However, my family still prefers my "old way" of making alfredo sauce....

We've tried a couple different alfredo recipes, but this one wins by far. I used bowtie pasta and added some spinach. I wish it wasn't so fattening because I could eat this once a week lol.

I added 5 cloves of fresh garlic, substituted the required cheese(s) with a store-bought intalian-blend (mozzarella,ariago,provolone,cheddar) that cost $2.99, and sprinkled the pasta/squash/asparagus/shrimp with black pepper and a bottled brand of Parmasan; this beat the store bought brand of Ragu's Garlic Alfredo! Delicious!!!

I made this dish with a few changes and it was perfect! My entire family loved it (even the ones that don't like Alfredo)! My changes were...4 cloves of diced garlic added to the butter and I used Pecorino Romano cheese with the Parmesan  so it added a much stronger flavor. Good choice if that's what you are looking for.

Quick and easy!  Use fresh cheese not the Kraft stuff.  The kraft stuff won't melt properly and leaves the sauce grainy, but fresh is awesome.

Yummy! The Sauce I have been searching for!  The beauty of it is you can make it exacty as written and it is great, or you can add your own little somethings to change it up.  My additions: Sauted some finely chopped onion and garli in the butter.  I added some chopped sundried tomatoes once the cheese went in and then I added strips of left over turkey breast.  At the very end I added a can of diced tomatoes, drained and a little pre-heated.  Mixed it all up and served over penne. BF raved!  Have a little left over for lunch, we will see how well it re-heats.  Next time I plan on adding some red pepper flakes for a kick!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy to make, takes little to no time and tastes delicious! I didn't have any nutmeg so I didn't add it. I also added a handful of black diamond four cheese blend (pizza mozzarella, asiago, smoked provolone and parmesan). Even with these changes it tasted great and the texture was thick and perfect.

I love this recipe!  Its very easy to make and tastes great!  I only made two changes to mine:  I did not add extra salt as the cheeses had plenty and I added a dash of oregano.  Definitely worth the effort of making a real sauce rather than buying a jar at the store.

Tonight was my first attempt at making an alfredo sauce so I followed this recipe. I did however make some changes. I added 1/2 cup white wine, sauteed garlic, and chopped basil. At first it was a little too watery, so I added some corn starch and it made for the perfect consistency.

Not to my liking...although my husband ate it.  And it was probably my fault...I didn't use nutmeg cuz I was out.  And I used whole milk instead of cream...and I think the milk curdled a little...and my cheese wasn't melting quickly.  It was weird.  It was shredded and when I put it in, it would just clump up and not melt.  I stirred constantly (or so I thought) but it was totally lumpy.  I wish I had some cheesecloth to try to strain it, maybe that would have helped.  I was just so put on by the little bits in it.  Plus it was really salty.  Oh, and I should probably mention I'm not a big fan of cheese in general.  But I've tried a low fat recipe of alfredo and it was great and I thought I'd indulge myself a little and make the "real" stuff...but alas I will stick with my low fat alternative.

Amazing sauce!! Turned out just like the restaurants. I used quality ingrediants though and grated my own block of parmeseano/reggiano and added the garlic that everyone suggested. So yummy!

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I only change two things: 1) I just use fresh grated Parmesan, no Romano, and 2) I use waaaay more cheese than this calls for. It's hard to tell how much cheese I use, because I just add it by the handful, but I'd estimate that I probably add between 1.5- 2 cups of Parmesan to the heavy whipping cream before adding the yolk and letting it simmer.

Excellent!  I have made some Alfredo sauces that are WAY to stout for our taste.  This one was perfect.  I did not have any Romano cheese so I added cream cheese instead it was wonderful.  I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe! Thanks so much. I also added minced garlic and a tad cream cheese. I served it with noodles and chicken parmesan (pan fried).

This was my first attempt at homemade alfredo sauce, and I loved it! This recipe was very easy to make, and tasted wonderful. I used all parmesan cheese, rather than romano, and also added more parmesan than the recipe calls for (to thicken up the sauce). I also took other reviewers' advice and beat the egg with some of the cream separately before adding it to the sauce. The only other thing I added was freshly cracked pepper. It was wonderful! I'll be making this a lot in the future!

This recipe is awesome! I doubled this recipe. I only used grated parmisian cheese and about a cup and a half of it. I also added 1 minced garlic clove. Everyone loved it and this is the closest that I have gotten to Olive Gardens alfredo sauce.

It was alright.  It was a bit mild for my taste.  I have another alfredo recipe that uses all parm and no eggs which is much tastier and richer.  I will not make this again.

This is wonderful!!! This is the best alfredo I have ever had! I did not have the romano cheese so I just doubled the parm, but next time I make a grocery run I'll pick some up and try it that way too. Thanks so much for sharing this one!

Wow this was so EASY! And so delicious! I have attempted making homemade alfredo sauce before & it hasn't turned out. So I was so happy when this recipe did! I made a couple changes for what I had on hand. I only had whole milk so I used 3T. butter & 2 T. flour & made a roux. Then I added the 1 cup whole milk & a pinch of nutmeg & salt to taste. Then I added 2/3 cup grated parmesean cheese & then the egg yolk. I wasn't going to add the egg yolk but it made it so much more smooth & creamy! I ended up having to thin it a little with some more whole milk because it was so thick! Wonderful recipe! Thanks so much!

AWESOME!  I've made this several times and it is extremely tasty!  I've dressed it up a few times with some pre-cooked bacon, or drizzled it over chicken on top of the pasta.  I'm about to try a shrimp version tonight.   I'm sure it will be delicious!

I used half and half, maybe that's why it wasnt as creamy as I would have liked. Be sure to double this, because I didnt notice until it was too late that this was for only 2 servings so then I went back and made another batch.

Doubled the recipe.  Used more cheese and sub. the Romano for Beecher's Flagship.  Just used a pinch of salt for the double recipe.  Used whole wheat penne pasta - just didn't taste right, paired with the indulgent sauce.

Very good.  I tripled the recipe.  Added 3 cloves garlic and a  1/2 tsp parsley. Used all shredded Parmesan cheese.  To add the egg yolk, I followed other reviewers suggestions and removed some liquid from pot, slowly added yolk to it, whisking constantly then slowly added back into pan, while whisking.  It took longer than stated to make - closer to 45 minutes before I was happy with how thick it was.

Made this last night and wow. I used double the amount of Parmesan because I didn't have any Romano. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it. I made this only with noodles and will definitely add chicken or shrimp next time to the mix. Follow directions EXACTLY and you're in for a treat! Delicious!!!!

This was a good and pretty easy sauce to make.  I added 1 large clove of garlic (crushed) when the butter was melted.  I added a TBS of flour to the butter and used 1 1/4 cups milk instead of cream.  I upped both cheeses to 1/2 cup.  I was serving myself, husband, and toddler so I needed a little more sauce.  I didn't add the egg to it - forgot.  It tasted great anyways.  I'll definitely use my altered version again.  Great springboard for your own variation.

I've always wanted to learn how to make Alfredo Sauce. I'm so glad I made this one. It's delicious and creamy. I did add grated garlic as some people here suggested and it turned out great. I also added dry parsley flakes and a little pepper. Will make this once a week. Since my husband has requested it. Oh, it's great with breaded chicken breast.

This turns out good, but a few important changes make it better.  Use 2 egg yolks instead of a whole egg, and make sure you temper the egg by pouring about 1/4 of the cream mixture into the egg yolks, then pour the egg mix into the cream.

This sauce is simply wonderful! As others have noted, it has that restaurant flavor that we all crave. I didn't have cream, so I used a mixture of half & half and whole milk. I took another reviewer's suggestion and mixed in 1 TBSP of melted butter and 1 TBSP of flour to the milk mixture. I didn't have any trouble with thickness. I also doubled the parmesan because I did not have any romano, and I wouldn't make it any other way. It was absolutely delectable! I will make this again & again.

Very good!  I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic to the butter at the beginning.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Don't think that it made much difference.... my sauce came out delightfully thick and creamy.  Next time I will use all freshly grated parmesan.  The "shaker style" parm cheese was okay but gritty at times.  I added a sprinkle of black pepper and italian seasoning at the end for color.  It was served with parmesan-baked chicken and cheese/spinach ravioli.  FANTASTIC!!

Tastes like Alfredo sauce, fast, and easy! That gets 5 stars. I used milk w/cornstarch instead of cream and grated Parmesan Romano cheese (from the jar). This still came out great. Added a little garlic powder to taste.

I prepared this recipe for dinner last night, and my husband absolutely raved about it! It's easy to make and has a wonderful flavor and texture. Definately a keeper, absolutely no more bottled alfredo sauce for us!

This sauce is way yummy!  A big plus is that it is super easy to make.  My family loved it!  I will never buy the Alfredo sauce from the store again.  I did make one substitution because I could not find Romano cheese (I went to two stores).  I bought a small 5 oz. tub of freshly shredded 3 Cheese Italian (Parmesan, Asiago, and Romano).  I added a half cup of this mixture into the sauce.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe! (0:

This was  excellent. After it cooked and got thicker, I did remove about 1/2 cup of the sauce and add some cornstarch to it to thicken and this helped alot.

We really liked this sauce, though I didn't have any heavy cream so I used half & half instead.  To thicken it up towards the end I added an additional 1/2 cup of finely grated parmesan to the sauce and a little Wondra flour.  Sprinkling with garlic salt to taste made it perfect.

Delicious!  Even my Cousin's super picky son loved it!  Rich and creamy and fantastic!  I was afraid that my parmesan cheese was not going to melt, so I turned the heat up just a bit and didn't stop stirring.  Turned out just fine!  Awesome recipe!

I loved this recipe! I did everything the recipe called for and when everything was finished I heated about a tablespoon of olive oil and sauteed jalepeno slices that come in the jar and then added all the alfredo sauce to it giving it a little kick. You can also add cooked cubed chicken pieces. Pour over penne pasta and top with cheddar cheese! Delicious!!

If I could give this a zero I would.  I must have done something terribly wrong but I followed the directions right up until it says add the cheese.  I added the cheese and the cheese immediately started clumping and ended up in one big clump with the melted butter and some other kind of thin liquid around it.  It smelled sour too.  I tried another recipe.

Very tasty!  I added almost double parmesan and Romano cheeses. Also, the parmesan and romano cheeses need to be sifted before placed in the mix; it makes a big difference!

Made so many changes, my review is a bit skewed.  Used Kraft Parmesan, so it could be tons better with quality stuff.  Added the pepper, garlic, and cream cheese reccomended by others as well as a roux since I added 1/2&1/2 instead of heavy cream.  Ironically I did have freshly grated nutmeg :) Served with store bought tortellini and broccoli.  Great fast family dinner with what I had on hand.

I tried this recipe and was very satisfied though I did tweak it a bit. I didn't have whipping cream so I used 1/3 cup butter and 2/3 a cup milk mixture instead. I also added one teaspoon garlic powder, half a teaspoon black pepper, and two tablespoons cream cheese and I nixed the nutmeg. It was very delicious. I will use this recipe again soon.

This sauce is amazing!  I make it all the time.  A double recipe for a pound of pasta.  I add garlic sauteed chicken and broccoli.  I do let it simmer really low for about 10 extra minutes to thicken up the sauce and I add some extra parm. This one is always a request from the family.

I followed the recipe (doubled the parmesan like other reviews suggested) and it was really delicious.  However, it still came out a bit watery, but a friend suggested that I add a bit of flour next time to thicken it if I add too much creame.  all in all, still a good recipe.

Very good, just takes patience. I actually forgot to get whipping cream and only had half and half. Worked just fine. Turned it down to medium-low and stirred frequently for about 1/2 hour, then let it sit for 10 minutes off heat. Really thick and tasted good, 3 stars good. After tasting, I also added garlic, pepper and a few tablespoons of cream cheese. I noticed the recipe on the pesto ravioli I was going to serve it over was similar...they used 2 egg yolks and a little chicken stock. I added a small dollop of Better than Boullion. It's a pretty flexible recipe, my additions bumped it up to 4 star.

I made this recipe with more butter but with whole milk instead of cream. And frankly, it turned out terrible. I used fresh parmesan, adding it slowly, but it turned out nasty and lumpy. i ended up draining a lot of the fat, and just dumping the mixture into my blender to get a smooth consistency. That significantly helped, as did some extra pepper and cilantro, but still I would over all definitely not recommend this recipe.

I made this with 1 cup asiago and 1/2 cup parmesan; also added some fresh chopped spinach. Used 14oz of light cream instead of the 8oz of heavy and it came out great! The secret is using all fresh ingredients.

Fantastic, rich sauce!  I did as some had suggested and added garlic and pepper. I used it on manicotti which had plenty of red sauce.  If you are going to be using this sauce for an alfredo dish, you will have to double or triple the recipe.

Really great sauce.  I did add a small amount of mozzarella and, of course, garlic to this.  With cooked chicken and broccoli on homemade egg noodles, it was fantastic.  The sauce itself was slightly runny; however, it soaked into the noodles.  Don't know if it would soak into store-bought noodles as well.  I'll make this again.

Not that this needs another review, but it was quick, easy and cheaper than bottled sauce. I cheated and used evaporated milk and also didn't have Romano so used all Parmesan. (I needed a quick side and it was what I had on hand!)

Good sauce. Try using different hard cheeses and experiment. I use olive oil instead of butter. Make sure the whipping cream is at room temp and poor it into the pan slowly while wisking constantly. If you don't the sauce will break. I add pasta to the pan instead of pouring the suace over the pasta. Sprinkle fresh Italian parsley.

Wonderful!
I didn't have romano on hand but I had some monteray jack.  I shredded about 1/4 cup of it and it all turned out great.  I took the advice of a fellow reviewer and mixed the egg yolk with the cream before adding it.
Great recipe.

I loved this recipe and it was very easy to make. I used pepperjack cheese instead of the romano and it was delicious. It tasted just like a meal I had at my favorite restaurant. I also added some chicken, sauted onion and garlic, and bacon. My husband absolutely loved it.

This was an EXCELLENT alfredo sauce recipe and topped some of the delicious alfredo sauces I've enjoyed in nicer Italian restaurants. I added 2 large cloves of minced garlic, and will reduce the salt next time, as the parmesan cheese made it salty enough as it was.

This is absolutely yummy and sooo easy to make! I had it with "al dente" (brand name) spinach fettuccine (takes just three minutes to cook after you add it to boiling water) - it was wonderful. This sauce is the perfect creamy indulgence after a long day at the office. I VERY HIGHLY recommend it.

This is a fantastic recipe. Although I wouldn't call it "heavy". I did however have to change it slightly to make 6 servings. I didn't have enough cream so I added a can of chicken broth and cloves instead of the nutmeg. The family loved it and I will definetly make this again. We wanted to just eat it with a spoon.

The funny thing is that my boyfriend bought Asagio instead of Parmesan! I didn't notice until after I mixed it in, but the sauce still tasted great!

Yes, I know I should have noticed the difference between a very hard cheese and a very soft cheese, but I was a glass of wine in already :)

This is my kind of alfredo. I don't like thick creamy stuff like the rest of the family. This is how it should be to me. I have to alternate between this one and the Easy Alfredo Sauce recipe on this site.

I made this for a party and, while it was very tasty, the consistency was somewhat gritty. I remade it again, following the recipe exactly like I did the first time, and it was...still a little gritty. I used very good quality cheeses, so I thought it would've been smoother. The overall taste was very good, but the texture wasn't as smooth as I would like it. I would definitely make again, but probably not for company. Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)

I didn't have any heavy cream, so I substituted 2% milk. It didn't get as thick and creamy as I imagine it would have with the cream, but it still made a surprisingly nice alfredo sauce. I think the Romano cheese really makes this recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  I've tried a couple times in the past to make alfredo...which never turned out very well.
My whole family absolutely LOVED this!!!
Changes...I did add garlic powder and I didn't have plain romano so I used the grated romano/parmesan/asiago mix from walmart.  Also added in some fresh from frozen spinach

Wow! This recipe is so easy to make and it tasts great! I added a couple extras because friends wanted us to come for dinner. I only used what was needed for two people and then added some milk (skim milk) to add more and make it less thick. I also just used parm cheese instead of both. Last I grilled up two pices of salmon, cubed them and then added it to the sauce! It was enough for four or more and VERY good!!

THE FLAVOR WAS WONDERFUL, BUT MY CHEESE NEVER FULLY MELTED. The texture was terrible.  I don't know what I did wrong!  Maybe I didn't measure my cheese right.  What a dissapointment this was.

This recipe serves up rave reviews every time I make it! It's easy to make, fairly quick (make it when you're boiling the pasta), and goes very well with most anything you toss into it. I suggest adding sauteed spinach and roasted garlic, and serving with fettucine and grilled chicken - dinner will disappear in no time.

This is a great Alfredo sauce. I halved the recipe because I made it just for me.  Only used parmesan, added fresh chopped garlic and black pepper. Perfecto!

Easy and great.  I added 1-2 cloves fresh minced garlic to the heavy whipping cream. Also added double the amount of romano and parm cheese-my husband likes thick sauce.  Very easy.

I wish I would've read the notes submitted by B. Mason - Next time I will get fresh nutmeg and grate it to the sauce, as suggested.  I think that would make an already delicious sauce even better.  I served this over tortellini and added cubed ham and peas to it.  Got 5 stars from my husband.  Thanks.

This was very good. I liked it better than the one made with cream cheese from this site. I didn't have romano cheese so I subbed for 1/2 cup of manchego. It had real nice flavor and was really creamy. Hubby says its a definite keeper..I would also like to add some bacon or diced tomatoes.

Oh my goodness! Today I made this for the third time, and realized that all along I have misread the ingredients, and have used Ricotta cheese instead of Romano! So, clearly, this recipe also works with that substitution. I have also skipped the egg yolk once, and that was fine. Not as rich, but still good. DEFINITELY needs a big injection of garlic -- I added four cloves, but could use more even. Very good recipe, and very, very easy.

I have made this twice for two different parties, and it has always been a hit. I do add 2 Tbl spoons cream cheese and 2 cloves crushed garlic. I simmer longer on a low heat which thickens it up nicely at least 10 mins.

Good basic recipe, however I had to add much, much more of the cheeses in order to thicken it up, otherwise it would have been way too thin with not much of the cheesy flavor I look for in an alfredo sauce. I'm not a big nutmeg fan, so I left that out.  Don't forget for temper your egg before you add it to the sauce.

This was a terrific alfredo recipe.  I had never made it from scratch before.  I added asparagus, broccoli, onion and garlic after steaming the vegetables.  I also used smoked salmon and fettuccini noodles.  I doubled the recipe in order to have enough sauce for the added ingred.

Definitely an excellent sauce, very traditional way of doing it. It's not too thick, which is the more authentic sauce version. I love it baked with cheese tortellini and grilled, shredded chicken. I usually coddle the eggs when I make it for a group or for clients, just to be on the safe side!

This is a excellent sauce. I don't add the egg yolk though. There are so many variations of this sauce and it is nice to experiment. Another thing to try adding to this sauce is pesto sauce (powdered or fresh) add to taste and minced roasted garlic.

Excellent Alfredo! I did add the ground nutmeg, garlic and black pepper suggested in another review- I also had to triple the recipe for the 6 adults we fed! I made a mistake adding sAlt to taste before I added the cheese (I know better!) the first time I made this, but corrected that the second time and it came out beautifully!!

I had no idea quality alfredo could be so easy. I added sauteed garlic, broccoli, and mushrooms to the last step for some extra flavour and to get a few veggies in there. This made a rich creamy sauce that I served over fresh fettuccine.

Made this 3 times! First time just like the recipe. Second time I didn’t have Romano so I used only Parmesan. The third time same as the second and also are used half-and-half and it still turned out wonderful. Great recipe!!!

This is one of the best, authentic Alfredo sauce recipes I have come across. I made a few changes. First, I doubled the recipe. I am allergic to garlic (I know, it’s terrible!), so I often use an onion salt with parsley blend, which I did here. I used about 1/2 teaspoon. I also squeezed in the juice of 1/8 of a fresh lemon. Took the suggestion of

Wow!!  I have made alfredo sauce many times before using a very basic cream, butter. and cheese recipe but this one was by far superior.  I added lots of garlic (we love our garlic!!)  and a teaspoon or more of onion powder.  I have never made it with egg yolks before and I will never make it without it now!!  super yummy. the whole family raved about it!!

This is one of my go-to recipes. Note that as-is, it will be a little more runny than the kind of alfredo you get in a restaurant. To address this I typically add 1 tsp flour at the same time I add the egg yolk and then stir while simmering until it has the perfect consistency. I highly recommend fresh grated parmesan and romano, but you can also use the Kraft parmesan & romano you find in the pasta isle. It is super easy but you can taste the difference. This recipe works great with fettucine but my personal favorite is tortellini. I have also experimented with adding Italian sausage. It is okay but I am guessing any meat would work better (I want to try this with steak next!).

This recipe was OUTSTANDING! Probably the best Alfredo sauce I have ever tasted. I made grilled shrimp scampi with it and kept the recipe exactly as it is written.  I even ate the leftover for breakfast the next morning (don't judge me). It was even better the next day.

This was so, so wonderful! I did make a couple changes to the original... I cooked Italian seasoned chicken in the pan first, then removed and started the sauce in the same pan. Gave it wonderful flavor! I doubled the amount of cream, added an extra tablespoon of butter and about 2/3 c. more Parmesan. We ended up with enough sauce for 2 generous servings over fettuccine, chicken and asparagus. The consistency was perfect and was a nice rich sauce you’d expect from a restaurant. Thanks for sharing!

I’ve made a lot of Alfredo recipes and never have found one that knocks our socks off UNTIL now.  I used all parmasean and added a teaspoon of garlic.  It was amazing.  My 13 year old son and 75 year old mom loved it.  It was the perfect amount for 3 people.

Was an ok base recipe. Like others, I sautéed some finely chopped yellow onion and minced garlic. I did not have heavy cream so I mixed a little melted unsalted butter to 2 % milk, added a little extra parm ( about 3/4 cup rather than 1/2 cup), nutmeg and about 3/8 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. once heated I added a flour and water slurry to thicken, then about 2-3 tbs of the pasta water. I then mixed with egg noodles topped with some grated parm and chopped parsley, and served along with a choice sirloin steak. Was delicious.

Wow! So hard to find an alfredo sauce that has just the right taste, but this is PERFECT. On top of that, it's super fast and easy, and doesn't take too many ingredients. I'm a relatively new cook and this turned out wonderfully for me.

Made this for my hubby instead of using jarred sauce. I used shredded farmers cheese, because that is what I had, along with the parmesan.  Lovely flavor with the nutmeg giving it a little nutty flavor. Very easy and very good.

Made minimal changes. I skipped the nutmeg. It just sounded gross to me. I added a 1/2 T of fresh garlic to the butter. I used  all shredded parmesan vs romano cheese. This came out awesome. It was super easy and absolutely delicious.

This was my first attempt to make alfredo sauce and I was nervous but it turned out great! I did add 2tbls of whipped cream cheese to make it a little thicker and 1 tsp of minced garlic. Used it in an artichoke spinach lasagna in place of a red sauce. Everyone loved it!

Excellent.  I didn't have heavy cream, so had to use 1/2 and 1/2 instead.  It still came out beautifully.  Family loved it.  I wanted to try a different sauce on gnocchi, and this was perfecto!!  Thank you.  We had chicken and peas with it, and its going to be a new easy delish dinner I'll make again, with different types of pasta.  TY for great recipe.  When I go food shopping I'll get heavy cream for next time..lol.  I don't use it often, so a splurge now and then would be a treat!!

Delicious. The only changes I made were adding one clove if garlic to sauté with the melted butter and I only used Romano cheese. I didn’t have Parmesan. I like this recipe because it calls for Romano. Romano is what gives this recipe full flavor!

This recipe tastes better than Olive Gardens Alfredo sauce. I absolutely love it. I have used this recipe for over 10 years! I didn't change anything.

Delicious. It was too runny, so I added a cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken it up. I made it with crab meat to replace the version you can't get anymore at the Olive Garden. Everybody here loved it.

The kids LOVED! They even called my husband who was out of town to brag. I added bacon and some leftover chicken breast that I cut into small pieces so it would heat quickly in the sauce. This will definitely be a go-to recipe for a quick, delicious dinner.

Had to use immersion blender to make sauce smooth.  Quadrupled the garlic, needed a pinch of salt.  Sauce (of course) broke on reheat in microwave next day.  I continue to search for the Alfredo Mecca.  Egg yolks didn’t make much difference btw.

I do not recall making any changes and I hope I have an opportunity to make it again- I loved it.  My kids, on the other hand, did not like it as much.  Maybe it is an acquired taste.  I loved the cheesyness of it.

Followed the recipe exactly, aside from the cream. I did as others have done and made a roux and added milk. It turned out soooooo well. Very rich and so much flavor. Definitely saving this recipe.

In just a month since I found this recipe, I've made it five times for family because I rave so much about it!   Perfect just as is written.   Be sure to use fresh cheese & grate it yourself.  Garlic lovers can go nuts with extra too.   Thank you for the extra something (egg yolk or nutmeg?) that ups the taste to awesome!

It is pretty easy to make. I added  2 cloves garlic while melting the butter which I used half of recommended. I added 1 teaspoon oregano and  asiago and romano( instead of parmesan). Served mine over zucchini spiralized noodles and my husbands over spaghetti pasta.  It was delicious over spiralized zucchini!

Next time I'm gonna chop a fresh banana pepper into the cream and butter at start. I love spicy food and banana peppers were great in my lasagna. I'll let everyone know with an update. Thank you for the great sauce. Used it to top 3 cheese stuffed giant shells on top of meat sauce :) better than the restaurant

My new go to Alfredo recipe. I only had one 8oz Trader Joe's whipping cream on hand so to double the recipe I added 8 oz milk. I made a bit of a roux with one glove of garlic to start with the butter and a couple TBL flour then followed the rest of the recipe as written. Added one yolk only. Very rich and creamy. Great Flavor. Doubling the sauce was the perfect amount for one lb of pasta..

Great Alfredo! I was looking for something low carb to go with my zoodles, and this was a winner. Very tasty. I added a clove of garlic while the butter was melting because we make everything with garlic in our house, otherwise followed exactly as written. Would make this again.

I loved this sauce as is.  However based on other reviews I added 1/4 black pepper for my personal taste. I also mixed the egg yolk into the heavy cream before adding to the butter.

I make it as is. I have made it many times since adding it to my favorites. I never liked any of the jarred alfredo sauces, now I only make this one! I usually double the recipe and use it on corkscrew pasta with chunks of ham or do a carbonara :) yum!

I used 1 cup real butter, one tbsp. of Lowry's garlic powder mix, 1 quart heavy whipping cream. 3 bags Kraft Italian 5 cheese mix.  came out amazingly cheesy and delicious nice mix of garlic and other seasonings.

No butter needed if you use heavy cream (it may make the sauce oily). Add the other ingredients with a bit of cracked pepper & garlic -- EXCEPT the egg--it's NOT needed.

After making it and doing a quick taste test, I added a couple of pinches of garlic powder. It was the missing seasoning that it needed for my taste.  Yummy and I will make again.

Review (changes I made are to follow):
I found it had a delightful flavor and just the right amount of creaminess and thickness. I will be making this again and, although I don't feel that my alterations were necessary, I will make it the same way I did tonight.
Changes I made:
I bought blocks of fresh Parmesan cheese and Romano cheese from Whole Foods and grated them. I find that when I grate them myself, they are fluffier so I used 1/2 cup of each to compensate for the fluff.
I was in the mood for some fresh garlic, too, so I minced 3 cloves up and added them to the melted butter before adding the cream.
The Romano cheese is a bit salty, so I omitted the salt and added pepper.
I also tempered the egg with some of the warmed up cream before mixing the egg in. (Not sure if that was necessary)

I was a little skeptical at first but I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out exceptionally good.  I added shrimp and mushroom to the sauce and everyone raved about it.  It is a definite re-do in my books.  Excellent as is!

I liked it but its very mild as if its missing something, can't tell what. Based on a review I read I added garlic but will omit that next time. I did have to add some of the left over water so sauce wasn't so thick - great tip in recipe.

Wonderful! This was just right and not too anything for my taste. I followed other viewers' advice and reserved some of the cream to mix whisk in with the egg yolk before blending the egg into the hot sauce. It worked perfectly.

Really liked this recipe. I did use it for Summer Squash Chicken Alfredo on Allrecipes but tasted the sauce before adding into that recipe. Didn't have regular milk so I used soy milk.

Made even gluten free pasta taste good. I had trouble finding a good-tasting alfredo sauce - most seem to add flour of some sort - and with this one, I didn't have to. It was thick and rich. I also have used this with meat and vegetables, and it worked well, especially with chicken and asparagus.

My favorite alfredo sauce yet.  It's thick and rich.  Plus, it takes all of 7 or 10 minutes to cook.

I added chicken and sautéed mushrooms (cooked separately and added in at the end). This was a hit! Very rich and tasty.

Nice Alfredo sauce. Pasta night at my house constitutes three sauces and Alfredo is a staple. I usually omit the nutmeg and add some mozzarella cheese to it to thicken it up if I don't have cream. One of my daughters won't eat pasta without Alfredo.

Cream, egg yolk, lots of cheese (Parmesan or similar), lots of pepper.  All in the blender.  Cook pasta.  Drain.  Put back in pan with a little of the cooking water.  Add sauce and stir on heat for a minute or two.  Delicious!  NB fettucine all'Alfredo were simply butter and pecorino cheese.

My family has been begging me to make a homemade pasta alfredo for quite some time now.  So, we gave this one a try.  It was fabulous, and easy to make too.  My eleven year old daughter actually made this with my help.  We doubled the receipe, used only fresh Parmesan Cheese and added chicken that we had cooked prior. The chicken, which we browned on the stove top seasoned with pepper and garlic salt add a little more to the meal.  We will have this one again for sure.

I loved this! Whole family loves it in fact (2yo, 5yo and dad). I added garlic salt and some garlic powder in the beginning. I kept the heat low so as not to overheat the cream or brown the butter. I took about 3tbsps of the heated cream mix out and put aside in a bowl where I whisked in the yolk. Then slowly added the yolk mix to the rest at a low heat and whisked together. The yolk did not cook. It emulsified beautifully, like a buerre blanc. Went great on sautéed broccoli and penne pasta!! Definitely adding this to our weekly menu rotation :)

I made it without changing anything. Then I made it using other reviewers changes. My advice. Do NOT make the changes. Leave the recipe as is.

This was terrific!  I think the egg yolk is the magic ingredient.  Usually my attempts at alfredo are somewhat grainy or clumpy - this was velvety smooth.  I did add a little fresh chopped garlic to the melting butter and a dash of white pepper to the finished product.   I served half as is and added some pesto to the other half - super!

After reading almost all the reviews, I had to try this (with a few changes-of course). I changed the serving size to 6 & printed out the recipe. Used 1 stick of butter (I think I could have gotten by with just 6 Tbsp.) and 2 garlic cloves, added the whipping cream. Did the salt, pepper, and nutmeg. I used a whole bag (1 1/2c.) of finely shredded Parm cheese, bc I didn't have Romano. Next time (yes, there will be a next time), I plan to grate my own Parm cheese and try to get Romano. I kept whisking it but the Parm cheese never really melted all the way. My fettuccine noodles were done (12 oz. box), so I had to get the eggs in there. I tempered them first and then whisked them in the sauce in the pan and continued to cook (low) for another 3 or so min. It was good! My only problem was the fine little pieces of Parm cheese that didn't melt. Hopefully, when I grate my own block of Parm cheese it will melt better, and I will stick to the amount stated in recipe. Had a med. bowl of sauce, noodles, and chicken left. I served 5 people. My son and I have found that leftover alfredo sauce is pretty darn good over a piece of toast.

This was a great hit in the household, I made a few minor adjustments though. I used 3 cloves of garlic to make the flavor a bit stronger (being Ukrainian after all) also a dash or two of garlic powder and about a teaspoon of black pepper. Wonderful recipe I have it with fried ravioli or fettuccine at least twice a month

Made this for the second time.  Again, Excellent!  This time however, I lowered the heat and stirred the heck out of the sauce as the cheese was melting.  I cut back on the butter as well and this time the sauce was smooth (did I mention excellent????)  FIRST REVIEW:  Excellent!  I prepared exactly as stated and loved it.  I did add broccoli to the pasta as it cooked and cubed ham to the sauce just before serving.  It really was wonderful!  I have a question and hope someone here can help.  While this tasted excellent, it looked awful.  I couldn't get the cheese sauce smooth.  How do you get the cheese to thoroughly melt so that the sauce is smooth???

I made a roux as another reviewer suggested and used 2% lactose free milk and Earth Balance (my son is lactose intolerant). I added a clove of minced garlic to mine, too. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between what I made and the jarred stuff, yet mine was lower fat. Great recipe! I'm sure it would have been even richer if I could have used heavy whipping cream.

Absolutely the best sauce I've had!  Bettet than my own. Wanted to experiment with something different and I'm glad I did.
The ffirst time I made it, I followed the recipe and it was GREAT.
To add a little something extra add a alttle Asiago cheese, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Be sure to use good quality cheese. It makes all the difference in the world.

Very good, easy alfredo sauce. This may sound a little strange, but I doubled and followed almost exactly with the exception of ground mustard powder in place of the nutmeg.

I made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious! I added a bit of flour to the butter to help thicken it because I only had half and half. I also added a minced clove of garlic to it. It was fantastic!!! It was so quick and easy too. I used freshly shredded Parm and Romano. It was creamy and didn't clump at all.  Highly recommend this one!

So creamy I could die....... Only changes I made: used close to 1/4 cup unsalted margarine instead of butter, added 3 cloves of garlic and half an onion (minced and diced) while melting the margarine, and grated parmesan cheese only. I love how smooth the texture of the sauce is! I topped my linguine alfredo with canned tuna flakes and canned sliced button mushrooms (both drained). My hubby went back for seconds! Oh, and this was already enough for 12oz uncooked weight of linguine, just enough for 3. Thank you, B.Mason!!

My kids want to make this 1 million stars!  The whole family loved this recipe.  Instead of using heavy cream, I used roux (1 tbsp. butter & 1 tbsp. flour) to thicken the sauce.  Followed the recipe otherwise.

We had some leftover chicken, so I cut it up into bite sized pieces.  Sautéed 3 cloves of garlic and added the chicken.  Then combined pasta and sauce to the chicken.  Excellent!

This is one of my OMG recipes.  Seasoned, sliced grilled chicken with a cup of steamed broccoli over a bed of fettuccine and a side of garlic bread, salad and of course a nice glass of red wine and a couple of candles, what could get better than this.  Well, Italy but.......

Easy and very tasty. The only difference that I made was that I sauteed shallots in the saucepan before adding the butter and cream, etc.

Thank you so much! I had no idea that Alfredo sauce was so quick and easy.  Fresh shredded cheeses have the smoothest texture, but the average grated stuff is just as good flavor-wise.  I also substitute the cream with evaporated milk when penny pinching.

This was delicious!  I used actual parmesan reggiano that I grated myself (not the stuff in a green can) and it was amazing.  I used all parmesan, no Romano.  I will definitely make this again.

In the past I have only tasted great alfredo sauces at fine restuarants.  I followed the recipe as suggested and it is great.  I could I drink this stuff!  I believe the nutmeg and egg yoke made this recipe exceptional.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this. I added some cloves of garlic. I didn't have Romano cheese so I added an extra 1/4c park, and a tiny bit extra. I also added some parsley for colour. We were having a seafood dinner that night so I put a bit of crab in the sauce as well. it's turned out fabulous!!!!! I will make many many times. Thank you for sharing . :-)

I originally found this recipe while looking for a way to use up an egg yolk. The flavor was pretty good, mild and a little sweet. The texture is where I had problems. The butter separated from the rest of the sauce and the whole thing is really thick. Actually, the sauce came out really thick before I even added the egg yolk, so I'm wondering what the point was to the egg yolk? I would've used that for something else! Anyway, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rave about it. Might try another alfredo sauce and compare.

Great alfredo sauce!  For a family of 5, I did double the recipe.  I only had 1/2 the amount of cream needed, so I did add some flour to the melted butter initially to thicken things up a bit.  Also didn't have both kinds of cheese, only parmesean (and I used a little more than called for).

My girls loved it! A very simple and quick recipe. I didn't use Romano as too strong of a flavor for my kids so I doubled the Parmesan. My only additions were to add fresh grated garlic and black pepper. I will add this recipe to the rotation.

I am a 20 yr old college student who is just learning how to cook. After reading a bunch of reviews I decided to try this recipe and was amazed at how well it turned out! 

In addition to what this recipe called for I also added *2 Tbsp of Cream Cheese*1/4 tsp of black pepper*and some crushed basil (because basil is awesome!)

My sister who doesn't even like Alfredo said it was amazing and don't listen to all the reviews that said you need to grate the cheese yourself. Just stir the cheese in well when you put it in, I used shredded and it came out beautiful. 

I will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you!

this was rather delicious and extremely easy. it works really well as a way to rid your fridge of some leftover dairy too. i did use a bit more fresh parmesan cheese than suggested, and sauteed quite a bit of garlic in the butter as it melted. it did come out slightly chunky, but that really didn't bother me. it's difficult to find a decent alfredo recipe i have found, and this one definitely COULD, with a little tweaking, rival olive garden! yum yum!

Excellent flavor.  It is basically heart disease sauce - just how we like it.  Just make sure to get unshredded parmesan, otherwise it will never melt - the pre-shredded stuff can be too dry.

I really enjoy this easy sauce - sometimes I make it 2-3 days before I'm going to serve it since it keeps well in the refridgerator. I just reheat in a saucepan stirring frequently with a whisk. Thanks for this recipe!

Very, very good...will never use anything else for alfredo sauce but this.  HOWEVER, it does seem just a tad too thick so i always have to add alot more milk.  Also, I add 1/4tsp of garlic salt to mine.

This was so so good!!   I started with a roux then added half&half, 2 cloves of garlic then turned the heat down while adding (very!) finely grated cheese. I used only parmesan (double amount). The finer the cheese is grated, the easier it melts. Sauce came out nice and thick!! Perfect!

Made this twice already and its awsome. The first time I put the nutmeg in and I liked it. But then I omitted the nutmeg and took some ideas from everybody else and doubled the recipe and also put cyanne pepper and Italian seasoning and bacon bits over top and man SO GOOD!! MMMMM!! This is a keeper! Never buying the jar stuff agian!

This sauce taste very good and is easy to make. I actually forgot to add the egg yolk but was still happy with the results. I added minced garlic and salt and fresh ground pepper. I omitted the Romano cheese and doubled the parmesan cheese instead. Yummy! I'm going to make this sauce again but this time I'll put in the egg yolk!

I made this sauce tonight for dinner and I loved it!!! I have been looking for a recipe I can make at home so I can control was goes into it, I think I can stop looking now.  I didn’t have Romano cheese so I just doubled up on the Parmesan. I also added some cayenne pepper, garlic and onion powder because after tasting it I thought in needed a little "kick". Overall, this was a great sauce and I will be making it again.

Delicious!!  I have tried other Alfredo recipes and none compare to this one!  Even Olive Garden can't compete with this sauce.  Very easy to make.  Even though ground nutmeg seems like a strange ingredient, it totally completes the flavor!  Will definitely make this over and over!

This sauce is excellent! I followed the recipe exactly except that I threw a clove of fresh minced garlic into the butter and let it cook briefly before adding the cream. I also let the butter and cream mixture thicken a bit before stirring in the rest of the ingredients. It was fabulous enough on its own, and I used it in the Bertolli's Chicken Alfredo with Plum Tomatoes recipe on this site (instead of their jarred sauce). The results were, in a word, fantastic. This one's a keeper for sure.

This was awesome.  I did make a little adjustment.  I used a mix of cheeses: Romano, parmesan, and asiago.  Added garlic, salt and pepper to taste and did not add egg yoke.  I poured it over spaghetti squash and it was a hit!

Me and my sister really enjoyed this alfredo sauce on our mushroom, spinach and onion pizza. I used the remainder of the sauce on some pasta a couple days later. Does well as a left-over. Thanks for the recipe!

Have tried quite a few recipes and this, by far wins in my book.  I didn't have the heavy whipping cream, so I made a roux with 1tbsp butter and 1tbsp flour.  Then I added the milk and rest of ingredients.  I used garlic salt, pepper, and nutmeg....also I used all parmesan and no romano (only had parmesan on hand).  My only complaint it that it was SUPER thick....which could be because I didn't use the heavy whipping cream.  HOWEVER, the flavor was amazing!!!

I have made this twice and it's really good.  Only issue was ensuring that the eggs get blended in rather than cooking in one solid lump of yolk.  It doesn't need salt.

Everyone loved this recipe.  It was really tasty when the sauce was freshly made.  The only problem or question I had about the recipe was when I increased the serving size to 8 the recipe called for 3/4 cup of butter or magarine.  The caused the leftover, overnight, to be hard and when I microwaved, it was really oily, so much so that I had to drain it before eating.

This alfredo sauce was delicious!! We loved it so much. I didn't want to go to the expense of buying parmesan and romano cheeses, so i just used parmesan, which worked out fine! also, this isn't very much sauce as one recipe- doubling it was necessary for our family of 5!

Yummy, rich and creamy sauce.  I made as is but without the butter and romano cheese since I didn't have any on hand.  Next time I will add these ingredients I bet it makes it even better!  Will use this as go to alfredo recipe from now on.  Thank you!

Quite possibly the best Alfredo we've ever had.  I also added some pepper and a couple of cloves of fresh garlic, as FUNDER recommended.  Also, since we didn't have romano cheese lying around the house, I used some Sargento brand "Classic 6 Cheese Italian" shredded mix instead.

Delicious. Had a dinner party of 30 last night and was able to make dinner in 30-min. I added broccoli and grilled chicken and had so many compliments. LOVED IT!!

It tasted good, but was too thin, almost watery.  I followed the recipe but only had one egg yolk.  I am wondering if that is why it was too thin.

Great recipe!  I add chopped fresh parsley at the end.  I've served this sauce over pasta and chicken and also steak.  This is the only way to eat alfredo--the jar stuff will never do!

Delicious!  Like several of the previous reveiwers, I added grated garlic.  I also used shredded parmesan cheese rather than the grated parm/romano.  It gave the sauce the perfect consistency.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed the directions to a T the first time I made it and it came out great. The 2nd time I must not have stirred it right b/c it was a little clumpy but not too bad. It still tasted good. I really like this recipe.

I made some edits due to what I had on hand - I doubled the recipe, sauteed onion in half the butter, added the other half of the butter and some fresh crab!!, I didn't have quite enough heavy cream so I subbed in whole milk, otherwise I followed the recipe.  It was amazing!  My partner doesn't like Alfredo sauce with cream cheese and he really enjoyed this sauce! We will be making this again.

This was fantastic!  I made a few modifications as I didn't have the cream on hand so I used a roux and milk, letting it cook for a bit and thicken up.  The texture ended up perfect.  I also added minced fresh garlic and some cracked black pepper.  I ended up with a silky, creamy, mildly garlicky, utterly delicious sauce.  My 3 1/2 year old daughter couldn't get enough either and that's about the highest praise I can give.

Oh my... I had a feeling this was going to be good, and it certainly exceeded my expectations.  I had no problem getting the sauce to thicken up; I think the key is slowly adding the cheese and egg yolk.  I used 4 oz. cream and 4 oz. half and half and a combination of Parmesan and Italian blend cheeses.  To make this a little "heartier", I sauteed some mushrooms and garlic and added those to the sauce before serving over fettuccine noodles.  Sooo good!  I wouldn't want this everyday due to its high fat/caloric content, but every once in awhile, it's nice to treat yourself.  Thank you so very much for a wonderful recipe!

Absolutely perfect. I grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and Romano cheeses, and used half-&-half because I didn't have any heavy cream. Still turned out perfect. Doubled the recipe to use it to make the "Lasagna Alfredo Roll Ups" recipe from this site. Dinner turned out amazing and the family loved it.

This sauce is absolutely delicious- I substituted heavy cream for fat-free half&half and added some cornstarch as a thickening agent.  Next time, I may try to put some fontina,gorgonzola, or a different kind of cheese.  Delicious& easy!

This was a great basic Alfredo recipe to find after looking for one that didn't call for cream cheese (ew).  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and added a clove of garlic and a sprinkling of black pepper.  I also didn't have Romano so I just doubled the Parmesan-- it could've used the Romano's extra kick, though.  Do not omit the nutmeg!

This is the best recipe that I have found!  I changed a few things, because of other reviews.  I added pepper and garlic and used regular whipping cream instead of heavy, I didn't want it too thick and thought half & half might be too thin.  Also, I live in a small town and try to use fresh ingredients so instead of grated Parmesan cheese I used Kraft's Italian blend cheese (we don't have a lot of cheese options).  Very good and will make again!!!

Very good, my husband licked the plate clean! Next time i will use freshly grated parmesan & romano, possibly that will improve the texture. I found no need for salt, the cheeses provided enough flavor...you can always add it at the end if needed. Tempered the egg yolk before adding to the saucepan as others suggested. Added garlic wile melting the butter and garnished with fresh parsley.

the recipe didnt work for me, not sure why... the butter separated from cheese - it looked bad... so I had to fix it with canned seafood sauce and milk, added garlic powder. Then it was good with pasta "Fusilli". may try one more time and see if it will be better.

This was an awesome recipe, but I changed it a lot... my husband was so happy with the result, I know I'll be making this again! I added garlic and mozzarella, left out nutmeg and ricotta. I didn't have nearly enough parmesan, so it was loose at first, but it was so creamy after a little settling and the mozz added a wonderful taste/texture. I also skipped the egg altogether. It ended up a alfredo/garlic cream sauce, and it was SO good! Great starting recipe, even if I didn't follow it!

Great recipe!  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and combined the egg yolk with about a quarter cup of the heated mixture first, then added that to the rest of the mixture.  Also, fresh grated Parmesan (I too skipped the Romano) made it so creamy.

I tried a couple other alfredo sauces on this site (marked 4.5 stars+) and this one was the best. Scrumptious! I made it once on its own, and mixed it twice with homemade marinara for a pink sauce. It is great! I only used fresh parmesan all times, as I didn't have romano on hand, but eventually I'll try it with that, as well. The only thing I did differently was add black pepper and a little garlic powder. :)

Love this!  And so so easy.  This is such a great sauce on its own or I also like to add 1/2 pound of shrimp to make it extra special.  I use raw shrimp and add them when I add the egg yolk.  I also use a little garlic powder (cause we like it).

Pretty good, although I tried substituting evaporated milk for the cream and that didn't work so well. But good flavor - I added garlic as suggested.

This sauce was so yummy! I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream (its what I had). I was extremely satisfied with the result.

Delicious! I used only parmesan cheese & added fresh minced garlic and pepper. My husband said it was better than any restaurants Alfredo sauce that he has ever tried. I will definately make again.

ive tried making alfredo sauces many times in the past, but it was never thick enough or just bland... this one was very good...  a great base... some tips- after i boiled the pasta and drained it, i melted the butter in the hot pan, added the cream, seasonings and egg... once everything dissolved, i then turned the heat on and let it simmer while stirring... beautifully thick and rich... i also added some garlic salt, parsley, dill and black pepper... very good sauce!

this was not as creamy as I was hoping for.  It also needs some additional spice, its fairly bland, though maybe it just depends on the type of cheese you use...

WOW.  I have been dying to make a restaurant quality Alfredo sauce for so long, and this is DEFINITELY it!I sauteed some shrimp in a separate pan in some olive oil with some garlic, and then put the shrimp on top of the pasta and poured the sauce over it.  I made sure to not pour the pan full of shrimp and broth over it, I forked out the shrimp and placed them onto the pasta.  This avoids the fishy taste. It was fantastic.

Great, easy recipe! I made it with asiago cheese and learned a lesson. Do not add any extra salt with asiago!!!!! I added an extra 1/2 cup of the heavy cream to correct and it was wonderful! I'll try the parmesan and romano cheese combination next time.

I love love love this recipe.  The nutmeg gives it that unmistakable flavor that you find in every Italian restaurants Alfredo sauce. I do have to say that I like mine a wee bit thicker though. Perhaps I'll try a little corn starch or flour as a thickener next time.  OTHERWISE this sauce is DELIGHTFUL!

This was very easy and delicious. I didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half and 4 oz cream cheese. I also added garlic, onion, petite peas and crab meat then mixed it with small shells. My husband and I love it.

Very lovely recipe.  I added minced garlic, black pepper, no salt, a little more nutmeg, some cream cheese and margarine because I didn't have butter. I added some flour to it because I like it a bit thick.

I am a huge alfredo fan.  I can't stand sauces that taste store bought.  I found this one online and thought I'd try it.  I loved the flavor but it was too runny for me.  I like my alfredo sauce a lot thicker.  I've seen where people add cream cheese to the recipe.  I might try that next time.  Other than that I really did enjoy this dish.

I thought this sauce was absolutely delicious! I used all parmesan (shredded) since I didn't have any romano and it was perfect. My fiance thought it was boring, but what does he know? :)

Big hit at our recent party! Since we had 20+ people, I adjusted serving size to 12 and added chopped carrots, broccoli and zucchini 10 min. before sauce was done.  It was enough to yield 2 lbs. of pasta and everyone raved about it!

Fantastic recipe! Let young kids help grate cheeses -with supervison (fresh grated cheese is way better than the pre-packaged grated stuff) Add a bit of grilled chicken over some pasta.

I was having ten people to dinner, so I quadrupled this recipe.  The only modification I made was to cut the butter down to 1 stick, which seemed like plenty.    This sauce was delicious and my guests raved about it.  It was creamy and the flavor was great.

yum! when I have time, I make this over the quick and easy recipe. This sauce really makes closer to 4 servings (at normal portions) Added a couple tbs of cooled sauce to egg yolk and whisk thoroughly and then add that to rest of sauce and cook per directions (you may cook egg otherwise)Only thing I did differently is,I added fresh minced garlic

Excellent! I did not have the nutmeg but it was still very tasty.  I cooked diced chicken breast, a minced fresh clove of garlic, and five fresh mushrooms (sliced) in a skillet.  I mixed them with the sauce, added some fresh spinach leaves, then served over penne pasta. It took about thirty minutes.

Everyone in the house asks for it weekly now! Simple, and perfect. I highly suggest pouring a 1/4 of the sauce into your egg yolks and premixing, or the eggs are cooked by the sauce. Also, using shredded cheese (we usually use Sargento) is superior to the grated. -Spend a little, live a little!

WOW!  This is the best Alfredo recipe.  My family loved it!  I will make this sauce again and again.  I made it with Pecorino Romano b/c that's what I had on hand.  I used the sauce as a base and then added fresh spinach sauted with garlic and sundried tomatoes to the pasta.  Amazing!!

This recipe was the best.  My girls loved it.  Said it tasted as if they got it from a restaurant.  My son had some the day after and called me and told me that I had make some for him ASAP.  I made a few changes to stretch the sauce.  I doubled the heavy cream and had a cup of the cheeses vs. 1/4 cup.  I also added minced garlic (I love garlic).  I used it to top over sauted chicked with broccoli and zucchini.

This recipe is so delicious & not to mention one of the easiest alfredo sauces to make.  The only thing I add is some fresh ground pepper.  We have it over pasta, chicken, veggies, & even baked potatoes.  Great recipe!

Made it as directed except for: adding in 1 tsp minced garlic and mixed in egg yolk in a cup of cooled broth and then added it in, as a previous reviewer suggested. This worked well. Added it to fettucine, sliced chicken sausages, and broccoli. A rich and tasty dinner. Sauce is just like those found in country Italian restaurants. High saturated fat and calorie content will keep it on the once in a while splurge list, but it's worth it.

Very tasty. I've always been scared to make cheese sauces but this turned out perfect. Now maybe I'll be more brave and try others! I roasted garlic in the butter and that imparted a nice flavor but I also added a bit of garlic powder to kick up the garlic flavor more.

I love forgiving recipes like this.  I never made it before and tweaked it a little (using ingredients i had on hand) and it came out great!  I used lowfat milk, added some white pepper, red pepper, black pepper romano and asagio cheese and some salt - this was sooooo good!

I doubled the recipe, added garlic & herbs seasoning, only used parmesan and it turned out great.  My whole family loved it inlcuding my 7 year old picky eater.  It was also very easy.  I mixed a little sauce in the eggs before adding them to the pan, but it still didn't have the smooth consistency we are used to from a jar.

This was so easy and delicious.  If you have problems with consistency, you have to keep it hot enough so that the parm and romano cheeses melt while you're adding them.  Add them a little bit at a time, and don't stir with a spoon, use a whisk and whisk the entire time you're cooking the sauce so it does not get lumpy.  
This sauce is very versitile too,  you can add any veggies and some grilled chicken too.  Thanks you for a great recipe!

It was good, probably the best recipe  I've found so far, but still not restaurant quality. To me this recipe isn't worth the indulgence of the fat and calories.

I made this last night and added some chicken, mushrooms, and onions, dumped it all on top of some home made noodles then topped it off with the alfredo sauce. Couldn't have been better. My wife took the leftovers to work today and fed 3 other people....they all ask for the recipe. Thank you so much. Yummy!!

Excellent recipe! I did add a pinch of garlic but overall the recipe was great. It was also easy to multiply for bigger servings.  The nutmeg was a good touch.

This was really good. I used this recipe when the Betty Crocker one I was using failed miserably--it looked like someone had hoarked up alfredo. But this one turned out perfectly! I used 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese instead of half Romano as I had none, and I added chopped parsley at the end. YUM!

I've been searching for a decent Alfredo sauce recipe I wanted to make again, and this is it! I used 1/2c of freshly grated Parmesan, because that's all I had. I found it thickened up very nicely. And I did temper the egg before adding the mixture back into the rest of the sauce - otherwise it might not have been pretty. We served it over tortellini with roasted zucchini, mushrooms, and red bell pepper. Excellent!

Love this recipe. I increase the cheeses just a little for a thicker sauce.

Yummy sauce but it could be a little thicker.  I used all parmesan because it was all I had on hand and it turned out really good.  I will use this again!

I have prehaps tried thousands of alfredo sauces and this one is better than the olive garden resturant, someone needs to tell them of this recipe. Make sure you have enough bread and plenty of appetite with this one also make double if you like heavy sauce!!! Next time I cook it, I will add seafood. Wonderful, THANK YOU
