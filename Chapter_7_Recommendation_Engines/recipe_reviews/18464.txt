Problem rolling out pie crust? Here's a simple solution. Years ago I could not roll out pie dough for anything! I hit upon this idea thru trial and error and it has worked well for me over the years and it's very easy to do. On the surface you plan on rolling out the dough, wipe the area with a wet cloth and IMMEDIATELY BEFORE IT DRIES, sprinkle with flour and rub it around. Then roll out your dough. It works every time and you can use the same area for all your pies you want to make.....

I made this pie for St. Patrick's Day and it looked great and was so tasty! I may go slightly lighter on the nutmeg next time, but it was the crust I couldn't stop thinking about for days! Sour cream was the secret ingredient that made it wonderful. I don't think I've ever made a homemade crust before (I always get the Pillsbury folded up kind) but it was easy! Also, I used a shamrock-shaped cookie cutter to cut three shamrocks in the top crust. I didn't remove the cut pieces, I just scooted them over slightly. These acted as decorative steam slots. I also like to put any leftover rolled out crust dough in a small pan, sprinkle it with cinnamon and sugar and put it in the oven with the pie for a few minutes.

Thank you all for your kind reviews. It's just fantastic to see so many people enjoying this recipe. I have made this pie many, many times and would agree with all of the reviewers who say to cut back on the nutmeg. I would recommend that you use no more Â½ a teaspoon of nutmeg when you make it, in fact if you can get hold of mixed spice (not 5-spice!) that works even better! You can use just all-purpose flour for the crust too and it works just as well, also 1-cup of butter is two sticks :-)  Hope you all continue to enjoy the pie.

This was rated by my husband as "excellent pie, baby."  I did make some variations and let me say right now that this is my second pie this week and I am NOT good at rolling dough.  It didn't look as good as it tasted because I can't seem to make the dough as thin, pliable and uniform as others can. I don't think this has as much to do with the recipie than with my inability to do proper pastry.
My variations include: Jonagold apples (next time I will use granny smith because these were too sweet) and instead of 1/2 T of nutmeg, I used 1 t. of cinnamon and 1/2 t. of nutmeg and a tiny dash of allspice.  Also, I cut the apples into chunks rather than slices and put the pie into a 425 degree oven for 10 mintes and then reduce to 350 for another 35 minutes.

I have to admit that I just made the crust last night.  I used it to top my chicken pot pie and it was amazing!  I upped the salt a bit and cut back on the sugar and it was the best savory pie crust I have ever had.  I am not a pie crust fan, but this was so delicious that I was saving the crust for last and picking at the kids left overs.  The apple pie filling seems pretty solid and would make a great pie, especially with that crust.  My husband and I agree that this will be "The Crust" recipe for savory and sweet pies from now on.  BTW- I did use only All Purpose flour and substituted vinegar for the lemon juice.  I also put my butter/flour mixture in the freezer for about 15 mins before adding the liquids.  The dough was pretty easy to work with considering my kitchen was an inferno.  If you have a food processor the dough is such a breeze to put together.  I'll never buy ready made crusts or look for another recipe again.  Thanks Brian!

I love to make pies and the crust texture and flavor is one of the most important parts to me & the filling is basic work. So I love to try all differnt crust recipes.  Being born in Ireland and this crust being different from usual I wanted to try this one.  I did change right away the nutmeg amount thinking it was a print error as I hadn't read the reviews just looked at the star rating.  Nutmeg is a very strong spice. I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar over the top crust and used a crust ring to prevent over browning. Placed a round cookie/pizza pan in the oven, preheated to 425 and placed pie on the sheet reduced to 350 after first 10 min.  I changed nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon and that was acceptable for my taste.  This is more of a crumbly texture crust than flaky break apart one and I found that it had to much butter or oily texture, taste.  If I were to make it again I would use 1 1/2 sticks of butter and a 1/2 cup more flour and see if this would help take some of the greasyness out of the crust and give a more pleasing crumble,flaky texture and good taste.  This much butter/crisco makes for easy rolling and handling for beginner pie makers but not so good taste/texture. Great pie crusts and fillings take lots of practice with a delft (light,fast)hand,the coldest of just the right amount of ingredients. My little Grandaughter is 12 and just starting to practice making pies! Happy Pie Making to you all.

I used a frozen crust because I was short on time, but the filling for the apple pie is great. Next time I'll make the crust too.

This pie was great, and it was the first time I ever attempted something as difficult as an apple pie. The crust was amazing and looked beautiful coming out of the oven. The lemon juice had a great flavor to the pie. Would put in more cinnamon next time.

This is, without a doubt, the best apple pie EVER. I don't need to keep looking for a better one. Some tips: I added a little cinnamon, a bit more lemon juice, used an assortment of apples (ESPECIALLY local apples!! They make a difference!), and used coconut oil as the shortening. It has a very light flavor, you won't taste any coconut in the crust, and it's so much healthier for you than crisco. I add a tablespoon of water to the egg wash, and bake the crust blind first...Incredible.

This recipe makes an absolutely delicious pie. I tried the crust when it first came out of the oven and I was afraid it was too buttery, but combined with the filling, it is a perfect mixture. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Oh my gosh, this apple pie was *WONDERFUL*. The crust was the best crust I have ever had on a pie before and I will try it with my other sweet pies. I must admit, I too had my doubts about the crust after reading it, but have no fears, it's first class. The only thing I did change was that I followed an earlier review and added cinnamon and a pinch of allspice, and cut down on the nutmeg by about a pinch. I will definetly be making this again. Thank you Brian for letting us all enjoy your mother's recipe!  :)

Actually, the pie overall for me was 2 stars... less than average.  But, after a family vote, we gave it 3 because the problem that I had was that I put the pie in my 350 degree oven for 40 minutes (it's a true 350 degrees, as I have three thermometers inside the oven checking)... and the top of the pie burnt to a crisp.  This wouldn't have happened, if I had been checking on it - not the recipe's fault - all mine.  If you make this recipe, be sure to start checking after 30 minutes.  The rest of the pie was absolutely fine, including the sides and bottom crust.  The filling was a bit too tart for our taste (I would use maybe pink lady next time).  So, we rated it better than average, but there are other apple pies better suited for my family's taste buds.

Your mum knew her stuff!!  This pastry is wonderful and similar to one my mother taught me how to make.   I still make a similar one but not too sweet.  Nutmeg is not necessary and, if you are fortunate enough, buy the tartest apples possible.   Thanks for submitting - now our readers know there are other apple pies that are good too.

My expectations must have been high after reading all the great reviews as I wasn't all that impressed. This apple pie was good, but I thought the pie crust would be super, especially after all the work I put into it and it wasn't anything spectacular. I'm going to try this filling with the Best Pie crust recipe from this website - I enjoy that crust and its much easier to make. This crust was super crumbly and difficult to work with and roll out. Once you get it rolled out though, then it is like regular pie dough and it works fine. I sprinkled sugar on top of the pie crust before baking it - gave it a nice sweet touch. I cut back on the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon and added a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.

Excellent pie.  This is by far the absolutely best pie crust I have ever made.  My husband says it's the best crust he's ever tasted.  My little boy doesn't leave any crust on his plate anymore. (darn!)  I have used the crust recipe many times now for other pies as well as for quiches.  It's like mom makes, but these aren't the ingredients she uses.  Thanks - we all love it!

This is the first pie I've ever made, and it turned out much better than expected.  I was having difficulty getting the dough to hold together, so I doubled the sour cream, and it came out very rich but still delicious.

This recipe turned out great!  So delicious when served warm.  Pastry was easy to work with and turned out great.  I used 6 apples and added an extra tbsp flour to the filling, and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  Will definitely make again.

The crust to this pie was DELICIOUS!!! It was sweet and a little tangy thanks to the lemon, and oh so flakey! WOW! As far as the middle it was about so so, knocking this recipe down to 4 stars. Using granny smiths made it a bit too tart and the filling wasn't moist at all, but perhaps I'm not considering that this recipe has a different origin than those I'm used to. Overall, good, and you can't beat this crust recipe!!!

This pie was delicious.  The pastry came out crispy and melted in your mouth, like shortbread.  I added cinnamon to my nutmeg mixture.  Will make again definately.

To me the pie was just ok but I must add I only used one stick of butter--two seemed like a lot to me. The bottom crust came out soggy and I think it was because the temp of the oven was so low.(But could have been the lack of the rest of the butter) I did like the way the crust rolled out and handled but didn't feel it was anything special. I will stick with my usual recipe which is the french pastry pie crust from this site. For my own taste, I prefer this one better. Thank you.

This is an excellent pie! The crust can be a little tricky to work with - and have found the BEST results are to roll it out between two sheets of well floured wax paper. ALWAYS a big hit wherever I take it! THANK YOU!!

I just made this pie today and must say this I the best crust I have ever tasted. The dough was a little difficult to work with, but well worth the effort. I did change some things with the filling. I used 5 Granny Smith apples and 1 Honeycrisp apple. I used brown sugar instead of the white sugar and the juice of one lemon. Thanks Brian for a great recipe. I have gotten rave reviews from all the pie lover at my house.

Okay, even though I didn't have nearly enough flour for this recipe and my dough wouldn't roll (due to the lack of flour) and I dropped the top half of the pie in my oven and had to spatula it out and replace it, this pie (even though it wasn't all that pretty after my abuse of it) STILL tasted good!  I would try it again, with all the ingredients next time.

I baked this pie yesterday to accompany an Irish dinner. I substituted a wee splash of Half and Half for the sour cream (none in 'fridge), and I had Gala apples on hand which worked well. I used the suggested half teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg. The crust is amazing with it's buttery flavor.  (I used Irish butter which is, in my opinion, simply delicious.)  I do think a little allspice or other favorite pie spice might add a nice touch.  Still, it is excellent!

Fantastic!  The crust is so flaky that it is almost like a phyllo dough.  This pie got my husband and daughter to eat cooked apples, both of whom really dislike cooked apples!  The pie was so beautiful coming out of the oven I almost took a picture.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe.  Like others, I reduced the nutmeg; I just grated some fresh on top of the apples until it looked like enough.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon on top of the apples before adding the top crust.  Thanks for one of my new favorite recipes!

By far one of the best apple pie recipes I have ever
followed including my Mom's!   I love the pie crust, it
was so easy to make and roll out.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I made it for Thanksgiving, came home from work yesterday to find apples from the market and a request from my hubby to make it for Xmas.    Merry Christmas!

This was the best apple pie ever! I did go with what one reviewer said for the apple topping and I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and I changed the nutmeg to apple pie spice. The crust was soo delicious! It tasted like shortbread cookies. Yum! My husband liked this apple pie so much that he joked that he wanted me to make this once a week. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It's a winner and a keeper!

I made this pie for St. Patrick's Day, and while I found the crust a little difficult to work with, it was very flaky and tasty, which I liked. I baked the pie for 45 min exactly, and I thought it was done, but when I cut into it about an hour later, there was a lot of moisture in the bottom. It probably could have cooked a little while longer. The apples were also a little crisp, but I like it when there's a little "bite" for the texture. Overall, pretty good.

As I was afraid that the base would be soggy, as previously mentioned, I made a different paste for the base (200 g all-purpose flour, 100 g butter, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, the minimum necessary of water to make a dry paste). I replaced half of the flour in the apples with sultanas placed on the base before placing the apples and less sugar in the apples + 1 teaspoon of ground cinamon with no nutmeg). It was excellent. Also just made a one paste pie with just apples, sugar & cinamon and simply the top crust. It was DELICIOUS and lighter.

Sooo good!  The crust is so much better than the usual.  5 times 5 stars. (I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Found the crust a tad difficult to work with; ended up "patting" it on instead of rolling it).

This crust was awesome! I had some problems rolling it though (90 degrees here yesterday) so when I rolled the top crust I did it between two sheets of waxed paper and that worked much better. I cheated and used a can of Comstock apple filling adding nutmeg-1 tsp and lemon juice. I plan on making the crust to use on my chicken pot pie, also want to try it for a quiche.
Follow up: As good as this crust is and it is, the bottom crust just doesn't hold up the next day so plan on eating this the day you make it. I still want to use this for a top crust on my chicken pot pie.

I think with all of the changes the reviewers have made it will be a great pie.  I found that you do need to go lighter on the nutmeg and bake it about 10 minutes longer. I only needed 4 large apples and also had a difficult time with the crust being too sticky...even after I refrigerated it, but the crust problems could be just me.  All in all it was a pretty good pie.

This is a very good pie recipe, the crust was fabulous.  The pie needed to be cooked about 5 additional minutes and the recipe calls for just a touch too much nutmeg.  But otherwise it is very good, a definate must try!

Wow!  I've made apple pie in the past with very little luck at making a really good dessert.  This one was just perfect!  My guests raved about it!  They were so impressed at its sweetness that they compared it to other homemade pies made with tart apples, saying that mine was the sweetest ever (and I made this pie with Granny Smith apples)!  I loved how simple this pie was to make, and I will definitely repeat it from now on!  I may make just one change to the original recipe and stir the filling together before placing it in the crust to create more of a sauce, but that would be my only change if I tried it.  This was just right for St. Patrick's Day!

I'd give the crust a definite 5! The filling was lacking in flavor though. It seemed to need more sugar and maybe some cinnamon? I'm going to use the crust recipe in an apple pie baking contest though!

This was my first time making a pie and it came out incredible!  It tastes just like the store-bought apple pies.  I did reduce the amount of nutmeg though and added some cinnamon, as another reviewer suggested.  The crust came out incredibly flaky and just perfect.  Thank you!

For a rookie cook, this wasn't the easiest thing to make... I was covered with flour and looked white as the Pillsberry Doughboy when I was done with the crust. The finished product, however, was outstanding. The only thing I changed was to make a 10" pie instead of a 9" because I had so many apples cut up. I should have made two pies because my wife and I ate half the pie before it cooled.  This was my first attempt at making any kind of desert. Best apple pie I've ever had!

This pie was AMAZING.  The crust was easy to make and was the perfect flavor and flaky.  I only made one change to the recipe, and that was to sprinkle the top of the pie with turbinado sugar, which made its appearance really nice (tasted good too!).  I will definitely be making this pie again and again - BEST APPLE PIE I'VE HAD!!  Thank you!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving--the crust was excellent, and came out a beautiful golden brown.  I will surely make this again; however, I think I'll put sugar on the top crust to give it a sweeter flavor.

This recipe was a hit! This was my first attempt at making a quality pie crust and I was worried that it would come out poorly. The crust was *perfect*. It came out flakey and a beautiful golden brown. The filling was tender but still had a nice crunch.

I made this recipe for a friend who normally did not like apple pie and he loved it.

I highly recommend this recipe.

I've made a similar crust before but without the shortening; it doesn't need it.  This crust can be rolled if it's well chilled but it can also be pressed into the pie plate rather than rolled out, so this recipe will make 2 single crust pies.  It is outstanding to use for pumpkin and pecan pie where you cook the filling along with the crust.
 I like the apple filling sweeter with granny smith apples, so I add an additional 1/4 cup of light brown sugar to it.  I only use 1/2 tsp off cinnamon in my apple pie; a little bit of those warm spices go a long way in flavoring apples..and I like to taste the apple in an apple pie.  Enjoy this pie..the crust is really wonderful.

This was absolutely delicious.  I used granny smith apples and organic unsalted butter purchased from Costco.  This recipe made two pies using two 9" disposable pie tins from WalMart:  one to eat and one to give away.

I mixed the pie crust using my Kitchen Aid - so easy.  The pie was a winner and the crust was flaky and delicious!

It was really good.  Family and friends say it was wonderful and please make again and share recipe! But next time think I'll add a little cinnamon as I love that flavour.

This is by far my familyâs favorite apple pie recipe! As mentioned by others use 1/2 t of nutmeg. I think it was a typo in the original recipe. 
   Iâve made this pie nearly a dozen times and my kid brother requests it for his birthday each year. Now my own children insist that I make them one when I make their uncle his.  :)

I think the crust on this pie is absolutely scrumptious!  I would also reduce the nutmeg a little the next time.....but overall, very, very good!

This was the first pie I have ever made from scratch. I agree with everyone else that the crust was very delicious! I made this pie the night before, and by the time we were ready to eat it the next day, it was very soupy inside. I have no idea why, but everyone agreed it still tasted good.
