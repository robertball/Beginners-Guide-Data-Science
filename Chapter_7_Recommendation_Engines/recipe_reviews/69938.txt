These were delicious! I didn't change anything in the recipe, except I sprayed them with butter spray, and baked them for 20 minutes at 425* My end result was 14 rolls, all of which were gone in less than an hour. My coworkers said this is the best thing I've made so far. Guess I'll be doing this one again real soon!

These were served to me recently when I lunched at a friend's home.  Her filling included the ground beef nicely spiced with taco seasoning, but also included cooked rice, black beans, and the shredded cheese and diced green chilis.  She mixed all of the ingredients into a large bowl and put a quarter cup of the mixture on each egg roll wrapper.   This saved a little time so as not to top each egg roll individually with cheese and green chilies.   The rest of the directions were identical although she sealed the edges with an egg wash and it was a great lunch accompanied with some chips and guacamole and a mixed greens salad.

My husband and I tried this but used shredded chicken instead of beef and added black beans, corn, mexican cheese, fresh cilantro and spinach.  It turned out great.

As written, not bad, but a little bit bland. I halved the recipe, but used about 2/3 of the taco seasoning packet. I also added some sauteed onion, and a wee bit of cumin. I think maybe a little corn and some white rice might really improve them. It's definitely worth playing around with. As with all egg rolls I make, I squirted them with butter-flavored Pam, and did them in the oven. We had them with salsa. Thanks!

I tried this as written the first time. The second I made some changes that we thought made this even better.  I added some corn and black beans to the meat mixture.  Didn't fry with the lettuce inside, instead topped with the lettuce.  We liked the way it worked just a little better.  Thanks for the post.

My son made this recipe for his girlfriend and we were lucky enough to be included. They were wonderful. A nice change from regular tacos. We didn't have any green chilies, so he substituted about 1/2 cup salsa instead. He doubled wrapped the rolls so they wouldn't come apart. Served with sour cream, salsa and a salad, it is a great meal.

When I made these I was afraid I wouldnt have enough filling so I added and extra taco seasoning and some refried beans. Well instead I  ended up having extra which was great becuase I turned the extra meat into a taco pie. It was a perfect way to get an extra dish with out a lot of fuss. Will do this one again. My company raved over both :)

These were really good! Loved the concept. I added chopped onion and can of green chilies to the browning meat. Served with mexican rice and dipped the egg rolls in salsa and sour cream!

Recipe was great.  Quick prep and cooking.  The time consuming thing was rolling the egg rolls, but that was fun to do.  Nice twist on the traditional egg roll.

These are great but only if you add more stuff, salsa or rotelle tomatoes is /are a must, black beans and corn are also good but not a must.   Less taco seasoning and more salsa, onions, garlic and cilantro.  I baked them 400 20 minutes turning every 7 min or so. Served with salsa/sourcream/guacamoli, excellent!!

I made these because I had extra ground beef and my husband mistakenly purchased egg roll wrappers. These are horrible for you! I did not care for the taste of these egg rolls.

Very tasty!  I added some rice to them, served them with salsa and sour cream, and we really enjoyed them.  In case anyone doesn't know where to get egg roll wrappers (we certainly had to perform a hunting expedition):  if you go to an Asian grocery store, we found them in the frozen food section.  This past week I was at our local grocery store and found them in the produce section with the tofu.

I was skeptical when I set these down in front of my family...they thought I had lost my mind. I cooked a whole batch of 14 for my 4 kids and hubby and within 15 minutes they were gone! These were fantastic and my family begged for more! I will def. be making these again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!

Good but a little bland. I added some roma tomatoes diced and a little extra cheese and it turned out very good. I also baked with a little drizzle of oil instead of frying for a healthier alternative.

Baked instead of fried. It was still good. Probably would have been even better with some black beans.

These were yummy!  Whole family enjoyed them, although I made them with just hamburger and cheese for the kids and the remainder of the goods for us adults.  Make sure to not overcook and drain well or will be GREASY.

Very good and fun. Be sure to brown properly. In the Deep Fryer, I fried each one by one on the metal spatula with the seam down. It kept them together better. Also, after frying gently shake the egg roll vertically to drain any excess fat/oil. I did not use the whole package of wraps for this recipe- The last 4 wraps I filled 1 T with my favorite strawberry jelly (in a bucket jelly), fried, drained and topped with powdered sugar. Yum!

Egg Rolls were really tasty.  Have a friend who doesn't like much of anything and I finally surprised her with an appetizer she loved.
9/7/12:  To the meat mixture, I add about 1/2 of a jar of salsa con queso, mix everything together and roll in the wrappers.  This saves on having to use shredded cheese and gives it a little more of a bite.

My family really enjoyed these for dinner with fajitas and chips with mexican white sauce. I htink next time I will put some salsa inside the eggroll because I prefer to dip them in sour cream.

These were really simple to make and very tasty. I used shredded chicken and black beans in mine. They were delicious and fried up in about 2 min. each pan. They do tend to get a little soggy so eat them right away!

awesome.  I put green and red pepper and onion in my turkey ground meat and some low fat mexican shredded cheese.  Plus some refied beans.  We ate them with guacamole, sour cream, salsa, corn bread, tostito chips and mexican rice.  SO SO SO GOOD!

I made this recepie and added a few extra items to add more flavor. I baked these as I did not want to fry my food. I thought it was just okay and I would not make again.

These turned out simply great! I used one pkg of ground turkey.  Once that cooked I added a little diced onion, diced red and green bell pepper, and frozen corn, along with a packet and a half of taco seasoning and a little extra salt (needed due to the extra ingredients.  Once it cooked, I added the diced chilis to this mix along with a little cilantro.  Rolled them with some pepperjack cheese.  Splitting them into two batches first I tried baking them, but really they didnt turn out to great. The tops and bottoms were cooked, however the sides felt really chewy. I took the second half and fried them.  They cooked all the way through and tasted just great!  Served with a side of fresh guacamole.    Will make again without a doubt (fried not baked!)

Be sure to roll the wrapper tightly around the filling so there will not be an air pocket.

I cooked two onions in a pan with 2TBSP of butter, then I added 2lbs ground beef, 3 packs of taco seasoning, 1 can of green chiles, i jar of southwest salsa(cheap $1.98 found at walmart) cooked for about 3o minutes, put in egg roll deep fried and enjoyed. It was awesome. Kids loved it, hubby loved it. The salsa really gives it the flavor. Oh yeah and 1 can of corn.

We made this for dinner tonight.  I added 1/3 c each corn, chopped onion and chopped green pepper as per other suggestions.  I ended up making 15 egg rolls with stuffing for 1 more left over.  I used the Melissas egg roll wrappers found in the produce section.  I did add the can of chilies to the whole mixture.  I only had sharp cheddar and it was great.  Hubby LOVED this1  I served it with a salad, re-fried beans, sour cream and salsa.  It is a great base-you can make it as hot or mild as you want.  Hubby ate 5 of them!  Next time, I will add garlic and some chopped jalapenos for some spice.

I thought these were wonderful! I added a can of black beans, made some cumin/cilantro rice to the mixture as well. I wrapped mine in 6" tortillas. Sprayed with Pam and baked in the oven at 400 for 20mins so the were nice and crispy on the outside. Served with salsa and an avcado/sourcream dip.  Loved it!

This was the first time ever that I tried a new recipe and all five of my family members liked it. I took the advice of several others and added mexican rice, black beans, corn, and salsa. The only thing that I would suggest is to add some extra spice somehow. Otberwise these were a hit!!! Thanks for the great idea!

Great with the addition of salsa to the meat mixture.  I also butter sprayed and baked them for about 15 minutes which browned them nicely.  Will definately make again!  Even my 22 month old loved them!

The only changes I made were adding corn and black beans, and although these were delicious both my husband and I felt there was still something missing.  I'll have to play around with the recipe.  Also, I made a sour cream and avocado dipping sauce that I felt was essential.  Without that, I think the egg rolls would have been too heavy.  I made the sauce by blending two avocadoes, 8 ounces of sour cream and the juice from two limes in my food processor until smooth.

This was pretty tasty. This filling seemed a bit bland so I added a lot of taco seasoning from the packet, as well as some cumin and a few other spices. This wasnt hard to make, but it did take me quite some time!! however, the end result was flavorful and tasty and both kids really liked them, so I would make them again on a day I dont have a lot of other things to do. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't make this exactly like the recipe.  I used shredded chicken instead and added black beans, corn and some carmalized onions then cooked it all together in the taco seasoning and rolled them up in the wraps with cheese.  They were super good.  We dipped them in sour cream and some teriyaki/bbq sauce.  Next time I will try the recipe as written, but I can already tell it'd be super good too! Thanks

These were outstanding. A MUST try recipe. The kids thought it was a little spicy, but honestly I didn't think it was all that spicy. Next time I may throw in some jalapeños for my husband and myself. If worried about the heat, just use mont. jack and it would be just as good. Thanks, we love it!

These did not wow me.  They didn't have any special flavor and the filling was spilling out as I was frying them.  They were very messy to make and not easy to serve hot at a party.  I will not be making these again.

Made these for dinner last night - so good!  I have never worked with egg roll wrappers before, so I guess I impressed myself with how good these turned out. Very Yummy! Served with a side of refried beans and dipped in salsa and sour cream.  Kinda like mini chimis!

This recipe was good and easy enough.  I mixed everything together instead of layering and I baked  at 400° for 30 minutes instead of frying.

Delicious!  I just used the idea in general.  I filled them with ground beef and taco seasoning.  Made some with corn and black beans and cheese, others with just beef and cheese.  I baked them but sprayed the cookie sheet first then sprayed the egg rolls with cooking spray and they got nice and crispy.  Very good dipped in sour cream, salsa or nacho cheese.  A family  (kid) pleaser for sure!  Would be good with chicken too.

Yum. Everyone loved them. I threw in the green chiles when the meat was cooking. Big hit! Put an egg roll wrapper in the oil to check the temperature before I started frying them to make sure the oil was adequate. Thank god for Pepcid!

This was excellent!  Stuck to the recipe 100% and couldn't be more pleased.  Even my picky 4 year old wanted more.  These would be easy to adjust based on taste and personal preferences and could be really fun to modify in the future.

Love this for NYEve - rarely fry and always do it outside so it has to be an occasion! Add black beans, corn - make my own taco seasoning as the packaged mix is way too salty.  Like a ranch chipotle dip with these!

Quite tasty, especially when prepared with the most popular taco seasoning recipe on this site!  Those who have Celiac Disease or are gluten-intolerant can substitute rice paper for the egg roll wrappers- they won't brown up like traditional eggrolls, but they will get quite crispy.

I love this, but I use Queso cheese and enchillada sauce. This is a big hit at school functions. My older daughter who is a picky eater, loves these! Its hard for me to make them because I will eat them all day and night long!!

I took these to a party and everyone raved.  I didn't have egg roll wrappers so I used wonton wrappers.

These were a hit w/everyone, even tho I actually made them for the kids. I served Amy's Cilantro Sauce & sour cream & salsa as dips. The kids didn't even use a dip, they loved them "as is". I used cheddar & monterey jack in each egg roll & mixed the chilies right into the taco meat. Super easy to make. Thank you!!

My husband says these are one of his new favorites. I didn't have pepperjack cheese, so I just used cheddar/jack mix. Will definitely make them again!

HMM still pondering why I can't give a better rating? Perhaps it's just me and the combination of the eggroll wrappers and mexi ingrediants just didn't click. I love testing new recipes. After reading the reviews I decided to add some fresh onion,greenpepper and garlic to the ground beef. I used a taco seasoning recipe from this site as I do not keep it on hand. Served with some refried beans and spanish rice. I felt for all the work it just didn't have enough kick and the eggroll wrappers were not a good combination with the filling mixture. Good idea but I don't think that I will make again.

I loved this recipe! You can really mix it up and put your own flavor in it.  Made fresh salsa with it.

I thought it seemed like something was "missing" on these - they were good but not five stars for me.  We will keep searching for THE Mexican egg roll recipe of our dreams....

This was suprisingly good! My hubby is a huge Mexican food fan and LOVED these! One tip, make sure your oil is heated before you add them, then turn it to a med high heat so they do not cook to fast! I have small kids so I ook out the chilies and replaced it with a salsa, which everyone seemed to enjoy.

My husband loved these served with all of the normal nacho/taco/burrito condiments.  Easy to make ahead and freeze, then cook whenever you are in a hurry for dinner
