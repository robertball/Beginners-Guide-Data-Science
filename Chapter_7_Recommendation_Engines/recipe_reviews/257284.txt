It doesn't get any easier than this! Sometimes less is more and this recipe is a perfect example of that. While I'm not a huge fan of rosemary, it pairs nicely with lamb and is quite good in this. The only change I made is that I let it marinate for  an hour just to make sure everything got acquainted. Excellent recipe!

I scaled the recipe down to 1 serving as my lamb steak was close to a pound. Marinated in a zip-top plastic bag for 1 hour and cooked it stove-top. Took out of fridge for close to an hour to bring to room temp. In hot frying pan using high heat, seared for 2 min per side. Then 3-4 min per side on lower heat, to reach 145degF. The pieces of garlic started burning  and I was removing while steak cooked.  Maybe garlic powder would be better cooking this way. Removed steak fromheat and topped with a few pats of butter which helped to make a  sauce. Let rest for about 10 min. Had with Fried Broccoli from this site. Thanks Nichole....nice recipe!

Very tasty and easy! I did change it a little as I used Roasted Garlic Powder instead of the minced garlic.  Definitely a keeper.
