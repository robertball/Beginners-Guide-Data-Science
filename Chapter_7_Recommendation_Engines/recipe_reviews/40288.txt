We really enjoyed this recipe.  Threw 2 cups flour and everything else in the kitchenaid. Didn't have any caraway seed, so omitted that.  Because it's so dry where we live, I added the rest of the rye flour until the dough was nice and soft but not too sticky.  Then I hand kneaded the dough for a few minutes.  Nice dense loaf, can be cut thinly without crumbling.  Have made many times.

Wow! I have never been a big rye bread fan until now.  I made this for my honey who loves rye bread and now we both do.  I have made twice,adding extra gluten, bread machine yeast, and water, honey/molassas (substituted honey for half the molassas) and butter (instead of shortening) (was Way too dry to form dough ball and properly knead without).  Even with all these substitutions/additions, it comes out fantastically! Wonderful crunchy crust, very nice texture, can slice very thinly without crumbling, and makes great toast.  This is my current favorite bread even though the dough is so heavy that during the kneading cycles of my Sunbeam machine, I have to stand and hand turn the dough ball. When cooked,it is not too heavy. It is perfect!

Fantastic!  I've been wheat free for over two weeks and I was beginning to think I'd never have soft, fluffy bread again!  What a treat to find this recipe!  Thank you!

I was really hungry for a rye bread and this one looked pretty good acording to the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a brick, same as another reviewer.  Since others have had obvious success, I still gave this a four star.  I thought it may have not risen because of my yeast, however I made another recipe and the yeast worked perfectly.  Maybe Lisa could share what type (brand) of rye flour she uses?  I used Hodgson Mill.

I thought that this turned out really well.  The bread was very light and fluffy.  I don't know what the guy that said his was a brick, maybe he didn't use the right recipe?  A+

i used 4 cups rye and 1 cup AP flour because i had no gluten.  followed everything else to a T.  first rise didn't do much, so after 1 1/2 hours, i kneaded it some more; at this stage it was quite "brick" like as others have stated.  after working it for a minute or two, i set it for its second rise.  it finally rose to an acceptable level.  i then baked it off.  the end results were a crispy outer crust and a gummy inside.  since i am not a bread maker, and did not follow exactly, i find this to my fault.  the only one who liked it was my DD.  i'm afraid she is going to have to eat the whole loaf...:-)

I tried to make this bread two days ago.  It was the worst cooking experience I have ever had.  The "dough" was not dough, but more like concrete.  I don't know what happened, because I followed the recipe to the letter.  When I stirred the ingredients, they became a solid, firm mass that could barely be pressed in with my hands.  I used rye flour from Cobblestone Mill.  Perhaps it was not the right kind.

It tastes good. It is a very compact source of nutrition. 
I needed to add about 1/2 cup of water more than the recipe called for to get a knead-able dough. The dough was very stiff and the bread was very dense

after stirring it all,does not look anything like a dough. It's more crumbs and small and medium size pebbles,I could not make it come together. One star only, but it could be my fault.
