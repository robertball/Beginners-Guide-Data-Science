I was skeptical of the cinnamon in this recipe, but followed the directions and voila! I loved it, and my friends loved it. I've since made it for pot-luck dinners and always get raves. I use a little more lemon over the meat mixture, and add more if I reheat. A bit more salt sometimes brings out the flavor, too. One of the other reviewers said they found this dish bitter so I was worried -- maybe their cinnamon was old? In any case, I didn't find it bitter at all.

I couldn't eat more than a few bites of this, and you should have seen the hilarious "gross" faces our 16 month old twins made while spitting this out.  However, my husband thought it was ok and ate a full serving of it so I'll be generous and give it 3 stars.  For me, it wasn't the cinnamon or the lemon.  In fact, one of my favorite recipes on this site is a cinnamon lime chicken dish so I definitely like the combination of those flavors with meat.  I don't know, maybe quantities were off.  I didn't like this enough to experiment, but if these ingredients really appeal to you, go ahead and give it a try.  Only thing I would definitely change is to use greek yogurt.  Thanks anyway for the recipe.

A good staple recipe, not fabulous but easy, healthy, and yummy.  If you love Stroganoff but want something a lot healthier but equally filling, this is a great substitute.  I find myself making it about every two months or so simply because it is a healthy and easy recipe for ground beef.
Edit 4/14/12: Just made this again last night and was reminded that 4 cups of yogurt is way too much--I think 2 would be sufficient, with the amount of garlic you plan to use halved, too.

Don't add too much lemon juice... I believe this is what caused this recipe to be a 2 in the end.  It ended up being too sour.  The temperature was strange too... adding the yogurt really cooled it off, and I prefer hot (heated) dishes.  A few tips: 
- More chopped onion is a good thing!  -- More cinnamon is a good thing! 
This was very easy to make, but I probably won't make it again.

I tried this recipe because it reminded me of a Turkish dish that I love....my husband really liked this - I used what I thought was a lot of garlic and it was still pretty bland for my taste.  I might try this again with some adjustments - I can see it has some potential....thanks for posting this recipe.

I figured this would be a recipe I either hated or loved but I found it too different to really give a fair rating to. The cinnamon was odd as I am not used to it but was not too bad. I used some homeade Amish noodles that seemed to add to the dish. I also think I would use regular ground beef and not the lean kind. The meat mixture was a little dry. It was not my favorite but I suppose could become so if I try it a few more times. I also like a large amount of garlic in the yogurt but can see where others might not. It was also odd to mix the hot beef/noodle mixture with the yogurt mixture but again, I think it's just something I am not used to. All in all, i am glad I tried it and will try it again.

I was looking for a fast dinner to make (I live alone) and I thought the ingredients were odd, but reminded me of eastern recipes which I liked (and I love garlic). Not only can I do this in 15 min but the amounts are so easy to remember I only needed the recipe once. It reminds me of stroganoff but not as heavy with a zingy taste. I did not have the bitterness problems like stated in one review. I can't get enough of it!

I was very tentative about using a garlic/yogurt mixture as dressing, but I tried this recipe and my boyfriend found it very enjoyable (he wished that I had used more cinnamon!).  In any case, overall a very easy and pleasant meal.  Try it sometime.

I decided to try this recipe as it reminded me of one that my Turkish stepmother-in-law makes.  Her recipe uses tomato sauce, and after eating this meal (following the recipe), I can definitely say that the tomato sauce is a very important ingredient! Not a winner for us at all...

This is simple to make, and the fragrance wafting through the house was so inviting. Still adhering to Georgian cuisine, yet so easy to make. Delicious!

We liked this - I put the  yogurt right on top of mine and served it on the side for my picky fiance. Very easy and yummy.

My husband and I did not enjoy this dish...we couldn't even finish what was on our plates and ended up throwing the rest of it away.  I thought the cinnamon, yogurt, and lemon together would be great, but it was just too bitter.

Very unusual! took a moment to grow on us but we decided we liked it. the only changes I made were that I used spaghetti noodles instead of regular noodles,(that's what I was trying to use up) and I added the yogurt and garlic to the skillet just before serving. It was quite sour and next time I might add a little sugar to offset that.

I have never rated a recipe before but felt I had to. We have a family of 6 who are in no way picky but no one ate this. I was disappointed. I gave one star cause it could of been good, but I did not care for the cinnamon.

Interesting to the taste, not the kind of thing I usually cook (I am more of a tomato person.) Very tangy. I liked it "some" and will put it in my recipe box. I gave it 4 stars for the ease of making and for the quality of taste considering how simple it was. I don't care for it enough to take it out to a church funtion or serve it for company but I can see how poeple would like it. I would definately make it again for a quick easy meal for the family.

The flavors in this dish seemed interesting, but they don't ever meld together real well - even with the  yogurt sauce, the dish still tastes like separate flavors of lemon, cinnamon, yogurt, and garlic. It was worth trying something new, but I probably will not make it again without serious adjustments to both ingredients and amounts.

Good stuff.  The yogurt sauce was a good way to get my toddlers to eat dairy, and the inclusion of pasta made certain it was well received.  Unique taste, but make sure you use plenty of cinnamon so the taste isn't lost.

I didn't love it, but I liked it. I do love the cinnamon and lemon in the ground beef. It was a good different. I added sugar to the yogurt so it wasn't so bitter tasting. I will use this recipe again!

I tried this recipe just to try something new. My family had a hard time with this.  It was a very easy recipe to make but not very good to eat.  I would not recommend this to mothers of young kids.  I won't make it again.

I thought this was OK, but my husband really loved it.  Personally, I would use a little bit less garlic, but that is all to taste.  In general this was a really easy, fast good recipe.

I didn't like this, but knew going into it that is was going to be an unusual dish compared to what we normally eat. However, I try to appreciate different styles of food, so I rate it in the middle.
