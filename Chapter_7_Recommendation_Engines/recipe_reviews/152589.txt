This is our main holiday fudge recipe. Only differences is that we double the recipe, boil for 5 minutes, and put it in a 9x13 pan to have a thick dense piece of fudge. Our other variations are
Peanut Butter Fudge: Substitute peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips; add chopped peanuts. 
Vanilla Fudge:Use white chocolate chips; chopped pecans, and vanilla or almond extract.
Maple Fudge: Use white chocolate chips; chopped walnuts (black walnuts are good), and maple extract.
Cherry Fudge: Use white chocolate chips; 1/2 cup well drained chopped marachino cherries, 1/2 cup almonds chopped, vanilla or almond extract.
We give these out to lots of people from the teachers to neighbors, friends, mailperson, ect..... DELISH and foolproof! Just don't make it on a damp day or it won't set, and use a WOODEN spoon, and have the stirring arm ready! ;o)

My standby fudge recipe too, like many other reviewers--only change I make is to use a 12 ounce bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the baking chocolate.  Chopping all that chocolate is a messy, time consuming hassle, and baking chocolate is much more expensive than chocolate chips when it's the same darn thing!  I stock up on chips during the holidays when you can get them for 99 cents a bag, and the baking chocolate is like $2.59 for an 8 ounce package.

I had high hopes for this fudge based on the reviews and the fact that it's also on the back of the marshmallow creme jar. Therefore I went ahead and made a double batch...big mistake! I didn't realize how much sugar was going to be used once doubling the recipe, 6cups is an insane amount of sugar, it filled up my medium mixing bowl!!  I tried to follow the instructions exactly, but something must have gone wrong. The fudge was very gritty, it felt like you were crunching on sugar. Even if the consistency had been good, it was just too mind numbingly sweet. I just hate the thought of wasting things, but the entire two-batches went in the trash. I tried another recipe (Aunt Teens Creamy Fudge). It used a lot less sugar & butter, but it was fabulous. Smooth, creamy and the perfect fudge taste.

Fantastic Fudge.  Use 1.5 cups white sugar, and 1 cup brown sugar, and you'll find it a lot less sweet, and a little healthier.  Have been using this exact recipe for 22 years.  I usually pour a third of the recipe in a loaf pan without the nuts, then add the nuts and dried cranberries to the remaining fudge, and cool that in a square pan.  Pleases everyone!   Lining the pans with wax paper makes it a breeze to remove.

I make this every year, and every year I come back to the internet to look it up.  You might become famous if you make this fudge a couple of years in a row- I did.  The secret- use a HEAVY pan and heat it SLOWLY on MEDIUM.

This is a very good, tasty basic fudge recipe, although VERY rich and sugary. I've always had a difficult time making fudge, as I live at high altitude, because boiling points are different. 
In the past, when making fudge, I've tried to bring it up to 234 degrees, and ended up with dry, crumbling fudge. With this recipe, the sugar/butter/milk mixture reached a rolling boil, and when it had only risen to 225 degrees after ten minutes of boiling and was starting to scorch despite constant, active stirring, I did a cold water test and found that it was at a hard ball already. I took it away from the heat and continued to follow the recipe as directed. In the end, the fudge ended up just the right consistency, but until it set, I was still nervous.

I have used this recipe before, when my children were young.  it's the only way I make fudge, so I was glad to find it again on the Internet, as I have not made it in years.  It is basically foolproof!

This was my first time making fudge & this turned out GREAT! Everyone says it just melts in their mouth. I also doubled the recipe & put it in a 9x13" pan lined with foil. It was very thick. I used real butter because that is what I had on hand, boiled it for 4 minutes once it was at a steady rolling boil. I was afraid I wouldn't get it to the soft ball stage it needed to set - but it did! Thanks!

This turned out to be a favorite on the candy trays I made this year. It was my first time making fudge, however I accidentally bought unsweetened baking chocolate, fortunately I had an extra bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, which thankfully the fudge still turned out great.  Will make this one again next year!

I love this recipe! It's easy and always turns out for me. And you can use pretty much any kind of chocolate chips or white chocolate chips and etc. Great recipe and has been my all time fave for 6 years now.

I have tired other Fudge Recipes ,and with those other recipes they failed miserably, I never was able to make any kind of fudge turn out right, Until I tried this one, I almost had givin up... until I thought I will give it one more shot, and I guess this shot was it, because this recipe is not only easy, but it also is very good, and it came out, I set the fudge out for the 4 hours needed, and though it wasn't fully ready I could tell that it was working wonders, I and my family sampled it after the 4 hours were up and though again I say it wasn't fully ready, it was wonderful. I wanted until morning before we tired it again as it was late by the time the fudge was done. That morning it was completely 100% done, and I mean it was wonderful, Never tasted better fudge in my life time. I would recommend this recipe to all even if you hardle bake like myself, A 9 year old could do it with proper supervison all alone and it would come out great.

I make this fudge EVERY Christmas and I had to find people to hand it off to because it's SO good and quite addictive. I make one variety with pecans and one with crushed candy canes, peppermint extract and Baker's white chocolate. Both are amazing and you really can't eat just one. I will pack this fudge in pretty plastic lidded containers with green or red tissue paper as a buffer. Everyone flips for it. Much more personal.

I was amazed that this fudge lasted so long because it tastes so good. The answer to why it lasted so long though is because it is so rich that you can only eat a small piece at a time. It was easy to make and tasted fantastic!

This is my Christmas dish for all family get togethers, its awesome!! You can also substitute the semi-sweet chips with other flavors and make different kinds of fudge. I make white chocolate, peanut butter, butter scotch and even peppermint with just using the basic recipe and swapping out the chips. Also with the peppermint, I use peppermint extract instead of vanilla, it's amazing!

I am a HUGE chocolate addict, as many are, but my big weakness is fudge.  I have eaten plenty, and made my fair share, and this was mostly definitely the best fudge that I have had.  I melted some caramel and streaked it along the top of half of the cooled fudge, I was thinking it might be good with caramel swirled in to it.

I have been using this recipe for several years.  The only difference is that the recipe I have you do everything in the microwave.  I have misplaced my recipe so I guess I'll have to go to using the one you cook on the stove.  If anyone has the microwave recipe let me know.  If I find my recipe I will post

If I may offer the following admonitions:    1. Pay attention to the cocoa content of your chocolate.  The original recipe called for semi-sweet chocolate chips, which are 58% cocoa.  Given that the recipe already calls for marshmallow cream and a high amount of granular sugar, this results in my opinion in an excessively sweet end product without enough distinctive flavour.  Best use dark chocolate:  Lindt 85% bars work very well and will give off a hint of that "cocoa dust" mouthfeel, but in the States you may have to settle for 70% chocolate.  I have not yet tried 100% cocoa and am reluctant to do so due to the lack of emulsifiers (see below).    2. The original recipe called for 3 cups (600 g) of sugar and this will result in a texture slightly more brittle than what will come from the blend I have provided above.  However, this also means that there is not quite enough emulsifier to overtake all the butter and you will likely see a few butter flakes on the final product.  This might be fixed by reducing the butter content slightly; however, I am reluctant to do so as I am unsure by how much to reduce it without the milk overpowering the butter; experience has taught me that when the butter is not forcing the milk to put forth ALL its resources (I put in too much milk that time) into emulsion, the texture turns out slightly waxy.    3. Use salted butter in this recipe.  Given the high sugar content of fudge, you really need salt to balance things out.

This is my most favorite fudge EVER! I make this every year and usually end up having to do several batches (all different flavors), to accommodate everyone's demand for it. I originally got the recipe from my mom who got it off of the marshmallow creme jar. It's wonderful and you will not be disappointed with this AT ALL! :)

DEFINITELY use semi-sweet or even dark chocolate chips!  Ding dong me had everything on hand, but had milk-chocolate chips and that's what I used and it was just too sweet.  Kids liked it, though, they didn't mind.  Also used Trader Joe's organic sugar which was a little bit on the grainy side, so the fudge had a granular texture.  I will make again wtih the RIGHT ingredients and I will update my review!  ;-)

Incredible!  I used a 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet chips instead of the squares (per other reviews).  I also "stole" an idea from another reviewer for a different fudge recipe and added 4 chopped up bars of Snickers instead of nuts (I think next time I'll use 6 bars).  After lots of experimenting, I've finally found my fudge recipe!!

Love this recipe. Easy and doesn't seem overly sweet to me. I use 12 oz. of chocolate chips instead.
