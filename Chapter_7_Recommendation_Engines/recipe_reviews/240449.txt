Very good soup!  It was pretty easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding some cubed ham at the end.  I think next time, I would use less broth, maybe 5 cups instead of 6 as I'd like it to be a little thicker.

The flavors of this soup balance so nicely.  The sweetness of the potato against the lime and salsa were delicious.  I did make three small changes.  I had fresh salsa so instead of pureeing it, I left it whole to add texture to the soup.  Also, since I love the chili lime flavor instead of black pepper I used chili flakes I dried from my bumper crop of peppers this year and instead of plain salt I added chili-lime flavored salt.  Heavenly on a cold gray day!

Very easy, got lots of good reviews. Went very light on the lime juice.
