This was very good! However, I baked the venison tips in the oven for 3 hours to get it just right tender. As you know, wild game is tough unless you take special care with it. A crockpot would cook it tender, too, but I didn't have all day to wait. I then added it to the rice mixture. My huband loved this and so did I. Thanks!

This was an excellent supper.  Very easy to throw together.  I substituted the beef rice mix for Zatarain's Dirty Rice mix which was on hand and has more flavor.  Will make again and again.

This recipe couldn't have been easier!  I followed the recipe exactly and my 7 year old ate 3 helpings! Venison always sits in our freezer because I am too lazy to do all the weird things people recommend to get rid of the gamey flavor, but this recipe was sooooo easy that I will probably make it again soon. Thanks for the simple easy dinner idea!!

This is my husband's favorite for the old deer meet in the freezer.  Because deer meet cooks very fast (at least here in texas) I barely browned them and let them finish cooking with the rice.  I also finely chopped up onion and pablano peppers and added them (sauted first).

This recipe is great I used Zatarain's Dirty Rice mix plus Zatarain's Creole seasoning and also added one jalapeno pepper.

This recipe is great! I had frozen deer meat and didn't know what to do with it and decided to fix this! It's quick, easy and tastes great! Even my kids loved it.

We eat a lot of venison, and I am always looking for a new way to prepare it.  We loved this!  Even my toddler ate two servings.  I replaced the onion & peppers with frozen pepper stir-fry for convenience, and served it with bread and salad.  The entire meal was ready in 20 minutes.  You can't beat that!

Having grown up on beef, it has been hard to adjust to eating the deer meat my husband brings home. I been looking for good venison recipes and this one takes the cake! It's simple, quick, and very yummy! Thank you for posting it!

Great recipe when you don't have much prep. time.  After making this a few times over the last year I have tweaked the recipe so everyone in my family likes it better.  I started the Zatarain's beef flavored rice with just the water, not adding the butter listed on the box.  Then I cut up a venison tenderloin into bite size pieces.  In a seperate pan I put a little olive oil and some garlic letting it cook for just a minute, then I added the venison and some worcestershire (1 - 2 T).  I let the meat cook about 15 seconds then start turning the pieces over -- the trick with venison tenderloin is to barely cook it, over cooking makes it tough fast!  After turning over each piece (total cooking about a minute) I added all the liquid and the meat to the cooking rice (10 - 12 minutes cooking time remained).  I opened the vent on my pot lid (or set the lid a little off center) to allow the extra liquid to evaporate while adding the garlic and worcestershire flavors.  My teenage boys had friends over who ended up eating with us.  They both thought it was steak and almost did not believe us when we said it was venison.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I thought it was very good but not great, however, I used moose instead of venison.  Typically moose is much more tender but it didn't seam to be tender at all in this recipe.  I will cook it again though for my family.

I would have rated this only as a 1 star if it were only me eating it, but my hubby and 2yr old ate it up. 

I needed to use up the deer that has been in our freezer for awhile and I liked the idea of the fresh veggies. It really didn't suite my taste buds at all. I do not care for venison and tried this because several people commented about how they don't like venison but enjoyed this dish. I can't say I'm among that group. Not a fan - won't be making this again.

Very good flavor, but I would use venison steaks next time as it was rather tough. Will definitely make this again though.

When my boyfriend got home, I was just beginning to brown the meat and he commented that it smelled a little "gamey".  But by the time I was finished cooking it all the word "gamey" was no where to be found in our house!! This recipe will definitely be used again and again!!!
As a side note, I also used the Dirty Rice mix (after browning I added the water for the rice, 3 beef bouillon cubes, and the rice mix directly to the pot; covered and simmered it all together for 25 minutes).  I started cooking before my boyfriend got home so I wasn't sure which cut of meat the tips came from so I used a shoulder roast and cut it up... it was a little tough (to be expected) but still tasted great!

I really loved this recipe for the flavors and changes I made, however I DO like the taste of venison so I missed that.  I did love cooking the meat with the rice and water. That did really help to tenderize the usually tough deer meat. Changes I made: Used Tony Cacheray's Red Beans and Rice mix, added a chopped jalepeno pepper (with seeds cause we like it spicy), canola oil instead of veggie (which doesn't make a difference), and used ground venison sausage as well as sliced vension tips. Started to brown the tips a bit before the sausage as I knew the sausage would brown quicker. We had sliced squash and zucchini on the side.  This ended up more like a gumbo/stu although I only used the recommended amount of water that the rice called for. So although we ate it out of a bowl it still tasted divine (minus the venison flavor).

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I was looking for some way to start using up the venison in my freezer, and almost passed this by. I'm not a big fan of peppers, my husband absolutely loathes onions and doesn't care for the gamey taste of venison. Still, the description intrigued me. Because of our personal tastes, I used only 1/4 of a small onion and 1/2 each of one red and one green pepper. We both loved the results! Next time I will try it with the Dirty Rice as another reviewer suggested, just to save myself the trouble of having to cut up veggies.

I made this for the 1st time last night with some venison I had in the freezer.  I used the Zatarain's Dirty Rice instead of the Beef as well.  My 12-year old said "Mom - This is one of my new favorite dinners!"  My husband loved it as well.  I liked it very much too, although the rice was kinda spicy for me, but I still went back for 2nds!!!

Used Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix. Gave it five stars based on the fact I don't care for venison and this made one of the six gazillion pounds of it I have much more palatable. Thank you much!

This was pretty good, but throwing the venison in with the rice to finish cooking seemed to dry everything out too much - all of the moisture was sucked up and the meat ended up a little dry. I would probably add a little bit extra water to the rice mix before adding the venison, peppers, and onions next time.

This dish was excellent.  My husband and kids all loved it.  For sure will make again.  I just want to add that I didn't have any dark/beef rice so I just used Chicken rice and it still was great tasting.

Super easy and great tasting.  The only thing I did different was saute the onions and peppers seperately...that way they kept a bit fo crunch.  I think I'll try this with other meat as well

My husband is very picky when it comes to his deer meat.  He was very impressed.  My kids even ate it without asking whats in it.  I used Zataran's Dirty Rice mix instead of beef rice mix.  Also, I sauted my onions and bell peppers first.  It was very tender and I even used shoulder meat.  Will definatly make again!!

I can my venison, so it's already cooked. I brown the onion and add mushrooms. I however omits the peppers so the kids will eat it. Sometimes I add beef broth instead of water when cooking the rice.

We love it using Zatarains.  Try Worcestershire with meat, maybe mushrooms.  See note

very nice recipe.  I soaked my venison in milk for about 8 hr prior to cooking. I think it helps.  used "dirty rice."  simple recipe on a busy night.

This was a nice way to use up some Venison cubes I had in the freezer.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and slow roasted the meat for a while to make it tender.  It turned out very well.  I added some spices (Lawry's seasoning salt, mainly) and liquid smoke to add some flavor and kill some of the "gamey-ness" of it.  I served the rice on the side instead of mixing it all together because of diabetic family members.  I'd use this recipe again.

Good use of some of that venison in my freezer.  I am looking for more recipes to create new ways to prepare it.  I also used the Zatarain's Dirty Rice mix, and I left out the peppers.  I followed another reviewers advice and added beef bouillon cubes.  I felt it was too salty, tho.  I will make it again and leave out the bouillon cubes.
