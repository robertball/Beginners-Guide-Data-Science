My husband loved this dip!!! I followed another recommendation and used 1 package reduced fat philly cream cheese, 1/2 cup lowfat sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo and it did not turn out greasy at all.  I also added half swiss cheese and half cheddar and that made it perfect!! Would highly recommend!!

Try baking this dish in a "bread bowl".  I have found that the bread absorbes the oil.  The dip itself is very good!

This was great.  I made changed based on other reviews.  I cut the recipe in half.  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I used 4 ounces cream cheese and 4 ounces cheddar.  It was wonderful and not greasy at all.  I will definatly be making this again.

This recipe is quick, easy, cheap and incredibly good. I made this one Saturday afternoon for friends who were coming over to watch some t.v and just hang out...it was gone within a good 15-20 minutes. For those that complain about the grease, I suggest doing 1 cup mayonaise and 1 cup sour cream to cut down on the grease. You could also use reduced-fat cheddar cheese and mayonaise. Excellent recipe

I used a monteray/cheddar blend for the cheese and it was not greasy.  Be sure to cut the recipe in half for a small crowd as it makes a lot!  Otherwise great!  I also added the leftovers to a cheddar rice soup for added flavor.  Great!

This is a really quick and easy dip to prepare. I whipped the ingredients together in no time before a New Year's party, and then jumped in the shower. When I was out of the tub, the dish was ready. I wish reviewers would stop complaining about the grease. There is mayonnaise in the dip, of course it's greasy. Very easy to repair the grease issue, though-just get a few paper towels and sop it up. This dip was gone in about an hour. Thank you for the recipe - and Jamieson loved it.

Absolutely awful. I used light mayo and still had literally 1-1/2 cups of grease just swimming in it. (And that's what I could drain.) The mayo curdled during baking. I couldn't eat it.

I really loved the taste of this dip but it was way to greasy. I was hoping that using low fat cheese and mayo it would be ok..but it wasnt. I doubt I would make this dip again.

People at my party loved this dip.  I must have five people ask me for the receipe.  Lot's oohh's and ah's.  I followed one of the reviewer's suggestions with half cheddar and half swiss and mix in parm cheese, plus added it on top.  It was very good!!

This dip was a HUGE hit at our family Christmas!! If you loves hot cheese and onion, this one is the BEST! I served with crackers and it went quickly. So easy too. Would work well with chips too. I used old cheddar and white onions. Mmmmmmmm!

Instead of being unhappy with the greasiness, consider that it removes the grease for you.  Just, pour, spoon or blot (with paper towels) the grease off!  That makes it lower fat than others.  We make this every year for our New Year's Eve party.  I originally saw it years ago with swiss so that's what I use.  Top it with sliced almonds and it's pretty and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe again!

I made this recipe at a family gathering and it was a hugh hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup mayo instead of the 2 cups mayo.  I did not have any grease what-so-ever as others have stated.  I would rate higher if I could.  Will be making it again.

My mom makes a similar dip... unfortunately she was out of town during my Christmas party so I had to use all-recipies to improvise and it turns out great! 

Better, in fact, with the helpful tip of halving the mayo and adding cream cheese... no oil whatsoever! Amazed. 

Also add some chopped garlic, Worchester Sauce, parm cheese, old cheddar. Sprinkle some extra cheese on top for a brown and delicious layer. 

Huge hit, even with those who do not like mayo or onions (strange enough).

This dip is delicious!!  And SO EASY!  I made this this weekend for my niece's birthday party and it was a big hit!  I used light mayonnaise and garlic parmesan on top.  It was gone in minutes and several guests asked for the recipe...I will definitely make this again.  :)  Thanks!

I thought that this was just okay although other people really liked it.  I found it very greasy and a little curdly.  I wonder if using a lower fat cheese (eg. part-skim mozza) would make a difference?

This dip (with a few tweaks) was fantastic! I also cut down on the mayo and added in about a cup of sour cream. This made the dip really creamy. A houseful of college students (even onion haters) went crazy for this dip at our Super Bowl party!

I've been making this dip for years- only I use 2 cups of swiss cheese along with 2 cups of Mayo and 2 cups of SWEET onion- sprinle paprika on top. The brand of mayo makes a huge difference on the grease/oil factor.  I usually use Hellmans but used with Kraft last night it was great- not too greasy at all.  Everyone loves this stuff!

This is so easy and I had people raving about it at the party.  It was a small gathering so I cut the receipe in half.  I baked in my GE Advantium oven for 13 min on Upper 7, Lower 9, Micro 2, Conv oven 6.  It was bubbly and browned with a crispy top.

no stars enough, a huge hit on my Xmas buffet! and no time at all to prepare. The advice of substitute mayo with yogurth or sour cream, a part at least, worked wonderfully well for me. Definitely a keeper!

YUM!  Big hit at party!  Used 1/2 lite mayo, 1/2 lite sour cream, 4 ozs lite crm chz, and 6 ozs cheddar jack, then parm on top.  No probs w/greasiness.  Baked closer to an hour by accident but loved how golden it got so will bake that long again!  Served in Italian boule (but will serve in a bowl next time) with Baked Lays.  Turned out that I actually preferred it refrigerated!  EXCELLENT.

I made this dip for a superbowl party and was well received.  I do have to agree with other reviews - I will definately use less cheddar next time.  Although, with cheddar cheese, I was not surprised it was very greasy.  I actually reheated the dip at the party because it did get curdly (expected from the mayo).  I served it with pretzels but everyone was eating with chips, etc.  I will make again but take other reviews into consideration!

Good dip! I made this for the superbowl and turned out very well. I used a little less onion, but added some bacon bits. The bacon gave this appetizer a smoky flavor as well as a little more substance. Was a well-recieved dip by all except my boyfriend (who thought this was too "oniony"). Thanks!

delicious tasting, but it was substantially oily as others have indicated. that being said, using large chunks of french bread to mop it up was very tasty! i will try light mayo or maybe a mixture of it and sour cream or something next time, though.

A good variation to cut down on the greasiness is to use swiss cheese.  Also, a few dashes of paprika on top make it look pretty and adds a touch of flavor.  Your guests will love it!

I misread the recipe and thought that the first ingredient was cream cheese.  I think the addition of cream cheese made this less greasy.   I added one pkg of cream cheese, maybe a 1/2 cup mayonaise, and a hand full of shredded cheddar.  Used 2 cups onion.  Dip turned out WONDERFUL.  We have a family full of onion lovers .. and they gulped the dip down.  A success given my accidental modifcations.

This was very good.  I got A LOT of compliments on it.  I did change it a little.  I only used about a 1/4 cup of mayo.  1/2 cup of sour cream and a block of cream cheese.

I used Colby/Jack cheese instead of cheddar.  I can't stand parmesan cheese, so I just used a little more of the colby/jack.  

It was not greasy AT ALL with the adjustments that I used.  I will be making this again for family functions.

Watch out......loads of grease.  I followed what it said and although the flavor of the recipe was good it was hard to get to because of the grease.

This onion dip was AWESOME! Everyone loved it.  I took the advice of others, used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 low fat sour cream.  I didn't think it was overly greasy.  I had about 1 1/2 cups left, so I thinned it out a bit with milk and stirred it into about a/2 a bag of thawed frozen shredded hash browns and baked it as a side dish for tonight's dinner.  Yum!

So easy to prepare.  I did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Also added one small can of chopped green chili's drained. These chili's are extremely mild so don't be afraid to try.  Super awsome comfort food snack.  Will make again and again.

Great dip Dan! We had it with crackers but I'd like to try it with tortilla chips next time. The Boy even licked it up (he hates onions but I think I'm starting to convert him). I was surprised at the amount of people who complained about the grease though. You'd have to expect it when the main ingredients are cheddar cheese and mayonnaise... Like another reveiwer suggested: Just blot it with paper towel. A lil grease every now and then won't hurt ya. ;-)

This recipe is the tops!  I made it for a luncheon and served with a variety of crackers and tortilla chips.  Every single person loved it and asked for the recipe.  After reading the other reviews I made some small changes in that I used light mayo and less than required and increased the onions.  I found that the recipe was not greasy and was pleased with the results.

This dip did taste good but I could only eat so much of it in one sitting. The onion flavor is great  but I found the dip to be very heavy and rich overall. I served it with mixed crackers and multigrain tostitos. I also found that 45 minutes was too long to leave it in the oven for. Next time I will check it after 35 minutes. My oven does seem to cook hot though so I would just keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't get too brown.

Very good. I substiture 1/2 of the mayo for sour cream. It makes it less greasy. A very yummy and easy dip but is a little greasy. Just skim off with paper towel after finished in oven. Taste is still good. CALORIE LOADED!!

I liked it ... needs a little something else. I had no problems with extra "grease" ... used colby-jack mix along with some swiss cheese.

Ok, follow the recipe exact...but it is incredibly greasy.  I was literally using the turkey baster to get out all of the grease.  It makes you sick to look at it.  Confession---it tastes soooooo good....

Very quick and easy to make.  I substitued half the mayo with sour cream, totally forgot the parmesan (but would like to remember that next time, as I bet it makes a nice final touch) and blotted it with a paper towel after the oven, and my guests raved about it.  People who generally aren't big on onions couldn't stop eating it.  It was devoured. Only made a half batch, which was devoured--no leftovers.  Figure it would be good served in a bread bowl.  Will definitely make again, and I know my friends will request it. Great recipe, and a pleasant surprise!
--Made it again, in a bread bowl, forgot to sub half the mayo with sr crm, and remembered the parmesan.  Not greasy at all.  Once again, fantastic, and my guests just raved about it.  Couldn't be easier.

Totally scrumptious! Everyone ate this at warp speed! I followed some of the other suggestions and made it with 1 brick of low fat Philly Cream chese, 1/2 cup light mayo, and 1/2 cup low fat sour cream. I didn't find it greasy at all, and neither did anyone else! Great easy fast recipe.

I made this for New Year's Eve, and my friends loved it.  I used the tips for making it less greasy, and I did not think the dip was too greasy at all.  Also, what I did was scooped the dip into the middle of a hollowed out rye bread, and searved it with rye bread and cut up onion bagels for dipping.  Perhaps serving it in bread was what helped the grease factor, maybe the bread sucked up some of the grease.  Also, I had chopped up the onions in my food processor, and diced them down so small, that I thought it might not come out very good, but I think the finely diced onions helped evenly spread the punch of onion flavor throughout the dip.  My one friend nearly ate the whole thing, she thought it was so good!!

This dip is delicious!  Everyone who tried it asked me for the recipe.  The best part is that it is very, very easy to make.  The second time I made it I was in a rush, so I baked it at 450 for less time and it turned out great.  Yes, it is greasy, but I found that sopping up the grease up with a paper towel worked just fine.

I love this dip. I don't think there is any way to make it so that it doesn't come out greasy though. I know a caterer who has this on her menu, and when she serves it (in a chafing dish to keep it warm) I've seen her come out an blot the surface from time to time with a paper towel to soak up some of the surface grease. It really is good though! Especially with home made, thick cut potato chips for dipping.

I was surprised the read so many reviews about the grease--with 2 cups of mayo and 2 of cheese, how could it not be? Overall, I thought it was great. I have had it with swiss cheese as well as cheddar. Serve with corn chips.

This recipe is great! I've made it for 3 parties now and everyone has wanted the recipe and there's never any leftover! It is a bit greasy, but if you drain the grease off before you serve it, it's perfect! We serve it with the Tostito Scoops Tortilla Chips.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tweaked this recipe - I used parmesan, swiss, cheddar, and mozzarella cheeses (all shredded). Don't make the mistake of using Miracle Whip - I did that once. Though I like Miracle Whip, it's taste overwhelms the ingredients - use regular mayo.

I used half sour cream and half mayo, and this was delicious.  I think next time I might add garlic powder or salt just to give it a little more zing. :)

Some people liked it but I didn't think it had much taste - very bland.  I would maybe try spicing it up again but add cayenne pepper to kick it up a  notch.

Excellent for impressing guests.
I tried one of the reviewer's suggestions to do halfmayo/halfsourcream.   I accidently dumped all the parm in and mixed before baking.  AND YET...
All the women at the dinner party wanted this recipe!  AND I have to bring it to our Thanksgiving dinner by mom's request!!!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!  I used one cup mayo and one cup sour cream instead of all mayo.  Everybody loved it in rye bread bowl.

I am sorry, we did not enjoy. Too much grease from cheese. I had to drain the dip before serving.

I’m glad I halved this recipe.  I made no ingredients changes.  It wasn’t well received.  Sorry, I won’t be making this again.

This recipe was great!  It was not greasy at all. It is better baked a little longer and the onions chopped finely.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of the onion.

I made this for a party this weekend.  I scaled it down for 12 people.  I also did half mayo/half sour cream to cut down on some of the grease.  The cheese I used was the shredded Mexican blend and for the topping I used a 5 cheese Italian blend. It was very yummy.  2 of the girls ate that the most.  The little bit of grease that was on it, I just blotted with a paper towel. My husband didn't care for it too much, but he is not an onion person.  All in all, a very good recipe and super easy.  I will definately make this again.

To say this is greasy doesn't even begin to describe it--mine was absolutely floating in grease--even with continual sopping up the grease with a paper towel.  I does have good flavor, though--I think I'll try some of the suggestions in earlier reviews about cutting down on the grease.  Everyone at my party ate some--but I told them all to go home and take 2 or 3 Zantac!!

This reminds me of some artichoke dip recipes I have made in the past.  I really enjoyed this recipe...everyone (people who liked onions)  complimented me on it.  Thank You, Dan for a great recipe. :-)

Served this at a child's birthday party and 
everyone went nuts!! It's the best hot dip I've
served in a long time.  Right up there with
the best artichoke dip. Try it you'll love it.
Thanks Dan!
