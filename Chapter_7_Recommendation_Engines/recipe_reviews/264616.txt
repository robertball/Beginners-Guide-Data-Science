I was very tempted to brown the beef before adding it to the slow cooker but I stayed true to the recipe except for a splash of Worcestershire sauce which did not help, This came out more like a beef stew than goulash. I suggest doubling the paprika and browning the onions and beef before adding to the slow cooker.
