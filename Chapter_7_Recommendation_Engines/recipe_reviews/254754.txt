Super tasty! Made as recommended. You can add a sprinkle of Italian Seasoning for a slightly different flavor. Thanks for a great cold salad idea!

As we make it in Peru, skip the cucumbers and tomatoes, use ají amarillo instead of jalapeño; if you can't find ají amarillo, use Cayenne pepper.

This salsa is ambrosia, I like how even though the vegetables are pickled they still remain relatively crisp, when I make it I always use it as a condiment to Peruvian-Style Roasted Chicken. I always have left over salsa which I sometimes put on a sandwich or toss it into a salad.

Killed the cucumber. Used 2x the amount of Lime juice. Jalapeños were substituted with aji Amarillo. Sacrilege to use jalapeños btw. Use aji Amarillo, Habanero or Scots Bell. It had a good kick and great flavor.

Loved this! We had it with grilled steak and potatoes and it was the perfect compliment to a summer meal. The only change I made was to add about a T of superfine sugar (only because I like pickled things a little more on the sweet side) but it would probably be just as good without it.
