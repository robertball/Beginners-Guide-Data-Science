I've been trying for years to find a recipe to duplicate "Edward's Pecan Pie", which is my favorite and which I can no longer find in the market; this is very close.  It has that smooth buttery flavor - a filling that doesn't over power the pecans, but compliments them.  I made it to take to a party and everyone loved it.

This is a great pecan pie recipe, however I would not recommend going with a store bought pie crust it comes out much better with the crust recipe listed plus it is much tastier.

I'm from England and I made this recipe for my friends in america this thanksgiving, having never made a pecan pie before. The recipe was easy to follow and the pie tuned out perfectly. Was loved by all. It makes a very pretty presentation.

This pecan pie is very easy to make and tastes wonderful. I never knew making a pie crust from scratch could be so easy. Even i couldn't mess it up!! Hint - if you don't have time to make the crust and want to use frozen premade - make sure to use the "deep dish" ones because this recipe yields a large amount of filling.

I will say that my Fiance is from the south (GA) and loves Pecan pie. When I followed this recipe to the "T" he fell in love with me all over again! I have made it 3 or 4 times for him already and it has only been 2 weeks. This recipe is GREAT!!!!

This recipe was the 1st pecan pie I had ever made and it made me look like an old pro!  I made it for my father in law for his birthday because it is his favorite and he LOVED it!  My husband said it was a close runner up to the "name-brand" pecan pies I order at Christmas time - no more ordering for me! :)

I made this as a "gift" for someone who loves pecan pies and he loved it. It was very easy to make, recipe was really easy to follow. I will definitely be making this one again- for me next time.

I used a different filling, the Unbeatable Pecan Pie recipe because it used maple syrup.

A lot of reviews on this recipe made mention of how good the crust was.  It really is a delicious crust.  I will probably use this crust  for all of my future pies.

I dont know what I did wrong but, the consistency was awful. It was like pecan pie soup....The flavor was good so I gave it 3 stars.

My husband LOVES pecan pie.  Tonight he said this pecan pie was the best ever. Excellent recipe. I didn't make the homemade crust in the recipe.  I'm sure it would be even better with that.

Very easy to make and delicious. I used a pre-made shell and substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup. Excellent!

GREAT! Very traditional, and a lot of flavor.  It is EXACTLY what you picture as a pecan pie.  I had to add an extra Tablespoon of iced water to the crust mixture.  Also, it took about 20 extra minutes to bake, but it was no big deal.  Just make sure when you give the pan a slight shake that it doesn't move like jello.  I would also suggest putting aluminum foil around the edges of the crust, so it doesn't get too brown.  Overall this pie was awesome and not difficult to make!

I followed this recipe to the letter, it turned out more like pecan cake rather than the gooey pecan pie I was craving. I will continue to look for another recipe

I am use to a sweeter pecan pie. This pie is "thick" I think too much egg? The crust is DELICIOUS. It still tasted ok. I am looking for a better recipe.

This recipe was fantastic!!! I will definitely be making this pie again. I've had very little luck making good pie pastry in the past. (I had to get pastry from my mom or her sister!) However, this pastry recipe worked very well for me. I'll be using it for all of my pies in the future. I did have to add an extra tablespoon of ice-cold water but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and the results were wonderful.

This was my very first pie ever and it was very easy to follow. The filling was delicious but I think I just need more practice with pie crust because mine came out a little dry. It was still good but I don't think I have the art of pie crust making perfected and I didn't have a food processor to mix it like some places suggest. But overall is was a great pecan pie!

Very delicious pie! Not too stiff and not at all runny. One thing I would suggest is to mix in the pecans with the mixture, not put them on the bottom because then when the pie is baked, the pecans tend to come off the pie more easily because they are not mixed in with the mixture. Overall, very delicious and I will be sure to make it again!

Lighter than my normal recipe. I used dark corn syrup out of personal preference.  Turned out great. This will be my pecan pie recipe from now on... until another recipe takes the title.

Mine turned out runny. I'd read the reviews that said the same, but figured they must have done something different, right? Well, I followed the recipe to a T and it rose really high and was runny in the center - then when I took it out, it collapsed in the center. My husband says he'll still try it, so I guess we'll see. Christmas is in two days. Thankfully, I made another one with another recipe and it turned out perfect.

I love this recipe. The only thing I did different was instead of using 3/4 cup white sugar in the mix, I used 1 cup of brown sugar.

This is the first pecan pie I have made that we did not have to pass out the straws to eat it.  My husband ate 3 pieces.  It was not overly sweet.
