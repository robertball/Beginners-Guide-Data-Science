This is a favorite for the kids from Hawaii. However, we don't bar-b-que it. We do basically everything you say but we put a bag of frozen chicken thighs in a big pot, bring it to a boil and let it simmer for an hour or so (the longer the better. We then serve it over rice. It's one of those meals you can make when you forget to defrost something... dinner in an hour!

OMG.  Wow.  I made the Shoyu Chicken using chicken legs and served it as one of the main dishes for a family/friends cookout.  I personally don't care for chicken legs, but they seemed like the perfect food for a cookout for a large crowd.   I was so sorry that they were eaten up so quickly!  I marinated the chicken legs overnight in a ziplock bag, then grilled them slowly over a gas grill.  Meanwhile, I boiled the marinade for about 10 minutes and added just a touch of corn starch.  When the legs were about done, I brushed them with the marinade and heated through.  I can't believe how great they were.

I would give this 5 stars, but I did not grill it, because it starting pouring rain when I was going out to get the grill ready. So instead I placed the Chicken and the Marinade in a 9x13 baking dish, and baked it for 45 minutes at 400 degrees. I liked it, it was a little spicey for me, but my older boys loved it and thought it was not too spicey. I am going to be making this again when our weather here decides to stay a sunny.

YUMMY!!!!  My family loved this. I will make again.  I only had one package of thighs, so next time I will make the 5 pounds from the recipe.  We all could have eaten a lot more!!!!  Make this - it's good!!!  (I put in the paprika and the cayenne pepper)  Oh and I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes.

I made this for my husband's birthday luau and I received so many compliments from our guests.  The chicken even got rave reviews from the polynesian dancers that I hired for the event. I have also made the marinade and put it on salmon and mahimahi and both were fabulous

I'd give this 6 stars if possible!  Fabulous bbq chicken recipe worth  making over and over again.  I marinated 5 skinless, bone-in chicken thighs for 18 hours in the sauce (proportioned to 6 servings) in a ziploc bag, making sure to turn over halfway through so the meat was thoroughly marinated.  Grilled on low-medium heat for about 15 minutes per side, and served with veggie fried rice and a spinach sidedish.  While making the sides, I reduced the reserve marinade over the stovetop for about 20 minutes.  It made a super yummy sauce which was fantastic with the rest of the meal!  To sum up, the chicken turned out beautifully -- moist and flavourful with nice grill marks.  Even though it was not spicy at all, we still think it turned out perfectly.  :)

Oo, so good! When I saw the picture, I had to try it. These are ingredients that are always in my house, but I never would have put them together. I'm so glad I did! Only change I made was the use of ground ginger (because that's what I had).  I cut back on the cayenne pepper just a bit because I'm a wimp when it comes to spice, but this just had a slight bite. Next time, I will let this marinate over night. One hour was good, so more must be better. We did this over low heat on the grill, about 25 minutes on each side. It was super moist. I think this marinade would be GREAT on ribs. Next time, we will probably throw this on the smoker and let it cook all day.Think it would be great served with grilled pineapple. Thanks!
Edit: We marinated ribs in this for several hours and then smoked it. Absolutely great flavor, but if you're going to use it for ribs, I would suggest doubling the brown sugar. 
Do yourself a favor, make this recipe! We made a huge batch for a BBQ and everyone couldn't stop talking about it!

Totally a misnomer... this is not shoyu chicken, but this is normally how people make teriyaki chicken in Hawaii... shoyu chicken involves it being slow cooked... it's like a Hawaiian version of the Filipino dish Chicken Adobo...

This is so, so good. I marinated the chicken for one hour, put the chicken on the BBQ and brought the remaining marinade to a boil on the stove and then basted the chicken with it while it was still grilling. I am making this again tonight and I am going to skewer some veggies and brush them with the marinade as they grill. A+. ... p.s. whoever gave this recipe only 4 stars and then stated, "couldn't get enough," needs to add one more star to their review!

I used low sodium soy sauce, used half pineapple juice/half low sodium chicken broth instead of water (for more flavor and oomph), increased the garlic and used a whole package of green onions (recipe didn't specify which kind of onions, so I just went with what sounded good). This marinated most of the night and almost all day in this wonderful, fragrant sauce and it's in the oven now, making my house smell AH-MAZING. I'll update my review once we've had a chance to taste it. EDITED: Good but quite salty, even with the reduced salt soy sauce. I didn't like the oregano in the chicken, next time I might try something else. Maybe cilantro.

Fantastic and easy, made with a lot of staples, so it was quick to pull together. Make a little extra marinade to set aside before marinating the chicken. Use this extra, boil about 10 minutes, turn off heat. Stir in one tbsp. peanut butter and whisk until smooth. Pour sauce over unseasoned ramen noodles. Makes a great base for the chicken. I also added carrots and green onions to the noodles.

Excellent! I did leave out the optional seasonings as my children are not fans of anything remotely spicy. And I baked it at 400 for about an hour. I will definately be making this again, perhaps with the additional spices next time! Thanks for sharing!

This not Shoyu Chicken.  It is what people in Hawaii make as Teriyaki Chicken.  I should know I am from Kaimuki on Oahu.  Shoyu Chicken is chicken braised in a sauce like teriyaki but milder because of the chicken broth you add to it.  It is cooked on the stove and simmered until done. You can add green onions also.  Real shoyu Chicken is onolisious!

This is super good. I actually make this about every other week. We like spicy and so for us adding the optional spices give it the perfect hint of heat. I make the sauce as described, except I never add the oregano and I use ground ginger (instead of fresh) and green onion (instead of a normal onion), and will marinate 4 large chicken breast in the sauce for 12-24hrs. I put the chicken breasts on the grill and then boil down the left over sauce on the stove with 1 tbsp cornstarch to thicken it up. Then when its time to flip the chicken over, I will brush the top with the nice thick sauce. Cook a little longer and then flip one more time and brush that side with the thick sauce. Then I add a pinapple ring on top. and cook until done. Super yummy! We serve with white rice.

ALOHA! Great job. In order for a recipe to earn 5 stars from me, the recipe MUST either yield a good classic taste or put a new tasty twist on a classic dish. Growing up spending a good deal of time on the main island of oahu, this is a classic. Just like my grandpa use to make it!  The only advice I can give to others for the recipe would to grill the chicken as the recipe says. Grilling the chicken adds a depth mof flavor that makes shoyu chicken so good to eat.  Mahalo

This was REALLY good; might just be my new favorite way to eat grilled chicken! I didn't use cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes, but I did use about a teaspoon of McCormick's hot shot pepper blend in addition to the black pepper and that gave it just the right kick without overpowering anything. I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs and I also boiled down and strained the marinade to make a great sauce. It was great without the sauce, but I'd definitely recommend making the sauce for anyone trying this recipe.

I don't grill, I just throw the ingredients into a pot and cook on med/low for 45 minutes. Use a can of chicken stock instead of water. I use green onions thrown in about 5 minutes before serving instead of chopped onion. Give it a more asian taste by omitting the oregano and adding Chinese star anise to the pot (The spice looks like a star).

My husband and I made this recipe with the following exceptions: left out the oregano (it did not seem to mesh well with the other flavors to us), halved the cayenne (this gave it just a slight kick) & left out the red pepper flakes because we were out, substituted 1/2 cup pineapple juice & 1/2 cup chicken broth for water, upped the garlic to about 6-8 cloves (hard to tell because we used minced garlic), and let the thighs marinate for about 6 hours, then grilled. We also cooked the leftover marinade to reduce it and thickened with a bit of corn starch.  All these were suggestions made by other reviewers. We cut up the chicken when done put it over white rice and then poured a bit of the sauce over it.  OMG! was this ever good!! It may not be true blue Shoyu Chicken according to some, but you know what?  Whatever it is, it is well worth the time and effort!!  We had leftovers the next night and could not wait for dinner!! This stuff is good over rice, with pasta, in rollups, even sandwiches!! Do your taste buds a favor and try it, especially if you can grill it.  Happy Eating!!

This was wonderful.  I baked it in a 400 degree oven for about 30-35 minutes since it was too cold to grill outside.  Next time I would use Chicken breasts.  I will be making this again and again its my new favorite chicken recipe.

Grilled chicken never had it so good!  For such a short list of ingredients, this marinade packs in major flavor with the fresh ginger and ground peppers.  I did find it lacking some type of acid, so I'll replace half the water with citrus juice or vinegar in the next go-round.  The leftover chicken also makes for a delicious addition to a cold salad the next day.  Thanks to The Big E for a future repeater!

We have a similar version that everyone loves !!  Use green onions rather than regular onions.  Add a tablespoon (or less) of sesame oil.

This is delicious!  I halved the recipe and made it in a Crock Pot, low heat for 8 hours.  When it was done I shredded it so it looked more like pulled chicken.  I also took some extra marinade in a saucepan and whisked in some sriracha sauce, bringing it to a boil. Served it over the chicken.

Very tasty. My family loves the flavor. I made this using some cheap steak cut up and marinated, and then made into kabobs. It was super. Served it to company. A big hit.

Fantastic! We just got back from Maui (where we did have shoyu chicken on our mixed plate lunch) and the chicken from this recipe is as good or better than what we had at the restaurant. I did leave out the optional seasonings.
I will definitely make this again...and again..and again!

Sooo Good. Followed the recipe exactly...except my husband was late getting in so I put it in the oven at 300 degrees for about 45 minutes. It was so tender and moist...oh my goodness, what a treat!

Delicious! Tamed down the spice for the kids.  Remember that there is no substitute for fresh ginger.  Don't think you can use a powdered version and get the same taste.  It makes all the difference!

I baked the marinated thighs. The rest of the sauce I cooked it till boiling, then I simmered it for about 20 mins. Next i added 2T of crushed pineapple, and 2T of starched mixed with 1/4 of cold water. The baked thighs I returned in the sauce just before serving.

As one family member cannot eat spicy foods, I omitted the cayenne and red pepper flakes in the marinade.  I did make an extra batch, to which I added the cayenne and pepper flakes.  I marinated all my chicken (b/s breasts cut into strips and skewered) in the mild marinade.   Grilled it for 5-6 min. on each side.  I took the spicy batch of marinade and boiled it down to a syrup and served on the side for those who like spicy.  This is a delicious marinade, with or without the heat.  Thanks for sharing.  I will be making this one again.

It was OK.  I put everything in a crock pot and it came out a bit runny.  Maybe i will eliminate the water next time if I put it in a crock pot.

Altho this looks like a yummy recipe & I will be making it, this is more like a spicy teriyaki chicken. The shoyu chicken I know & make all the time has just equal amounts of shoyu (soy sauce) & water, that's it. You can cook it on the stove or bake @ 425 for 20 or 45 minutes depending on whether you have boneless or bone in chicken.

Fan-tastic! Really reminded me of Maui.
I've made this recipe twice now - first time with all of the optional ingredients and the second time significantly reduced. I broiled my breasts, boiled my marinade, and served with short grain (sticky) rice for true authenticity.
My advice:
1) cut the spices in half the first time you make it. They really add a KICK I wasn't expecting. You can always adjust the spiciness later because you will...
2) Boil your marinade for 10 minutes while the chicken is cooking. This gives you a wonderful, slightly reduced BBQ sauce that you can serve with the chicken. Add corn starch carefully to adjust thickness.
I will be making this recipe over and over again!

The recipe as it is calls for way too much oregano, garlic and onions and these falvours overpowers the dish. For future reference, I think you're better off by not going by the exact measurements for the seasonings, onion and garlic, and just judging it by personal preference.

This was one of the best marinade recipes we have ever tried for chicken.  Everyone loved it even our picky 6 year old.   We wouldn't change a thing.  When grilling the chicken, the charring of the chicken makes it so delicious!!

This is an AWESOME recipe, I only give it 5 stars because they don't have 10! I make it over and over...the oregano brings a delightful twist on it.... my family loves it! I marinate it at least 24 hours when I make it, and results are great... this is a great slow cooker recipe as well.

This is a delicious recipe, I lived in Hawaii for 7 years, and even though some would say this is not Shoyu chicken, it is very, very good.  I have made it several times when cooking out and it is a great hit, every time, very tasty and easy.

My mother makes almost the same marinading for her steak and ribs.  Instead of using water, my mother use's half a can of sprite or white wine.  Great tasting.  Loved the taste on chicken and goes great with steak....thanks again

Baked mine in the oven instead - turned out excellent. There was nothing spicy about this dish at all even with the red pepper flakes and the cayenne so fear not. Served mine the way we got it in Maui with some of the drippings poured over white rice. Excellent!

This was really tasty!  I followed a tip from another reviewer to just throw everything in a pot, bring to a boil and let simmer .  I simmered for about an hour and served with rice and steamed veggies.  The meat soaked in a ton of flavor and the sauce went over the top.  It was so good that I didn't even have any sauce left in the pot.

Only had two chicken breasts and not alot of time so threw it all together, incl optional ingredients, without really measuring due to rushing to be able to marinate 1 hour before grilling on the George Foreman.  It was amazingly delicious!

This receipe was good.  My husband is not a person who likes spice so I left the cayenne out of the marinade.  Then I added the cayenne to marinade, boiled, and reduced.  This allowed me to have the spice and him to enjoy the flavor.  I made the recipe as is and it came out amazing.  Great post!

I tried making this with both thighs and boneless chicken breast and don't waste your time.  Thighs are ten times better! I made it non-spicy but I could tell the flavor would be delicious super-hot! A new favorite.

Grill time  is off to me -  I grill for 60 min on Med  to Med Hi heat turning every 5 to 7 minutes. When grilling chicken always start with meat side down -  that way the skin side either will not stick or if it does will not tear off. Let sit in marinade for at least an hour. Very tasty marinade!!

Maybe how much I had to adjust this recipe makes my rating a bit unreliable but let me explain how I made it. Same seasoning rations. First, I used boneless thighs. Second, I baked them. And third, I cooked them IN the marinade - covered in foil for 20 minutes at 425, then uncovered them, reduced the heat to 400, and flipped them every 10 minutes for about a half an hour. I think that I will try it next time with some pineapple chunks. While I realize not all hawaiian dishes are made with pineapple, I do think that it might jazz it up AND i LOVE pineapple. :-)

I grew up in Makaha, HI, I have ate this on many occasions to say the least. Another way you can make this is by using the same ingredients as listed above. However; use 3 bottles of soy sauce (DO NOT use Kikkoman)Your first choice should be "Aloha Shoyu Sauce" and your second should be LaChoy, NEVER Kikkoman. Pour your soy sauce in a large pot and add all ingredients (including chicken).  Add enough water to make sure all chicken can be covered (probably around 5 cups or so). Bring to a boil, then simmer for 2.5 hours (3 hours if you want the chicken falling off the bone).  Serve over sticky white rice and add some of the soy sauce mixture for added flavor. You can play with the Hot spices and brown sugar to your liking. I usually add about 3 cups brown sugar and 1/4 of the red pepper and cayenne measurements, it will still be plenty spicy.

I've made shoyu chicken in the crockpot before, and that was good.  This was also delicious.  I marinated it for about 10 hours....really good flavor.  Made it almost exactly as stated, but I only had powdered ginger.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was very good.  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and marinated the chicken all afternoon (5 hours) in a zip-top bag in the fridge.  I used the food processor to blend all the marinade ingredients together.  While my husband was grilling the chicken I put the marinade in a saucepan and brought it to a boil, then thickened it with cornstarch and let it simmer to thicken (as another reviewer suggested) just before serving the chicken I spooned the sauce over.  It was great!  The reason I gave this recipe 4 stars and not 5 is that without the extra sauce upon serving the chicken would not have been very flavorful.

I thought this was REALLY good, I give it 4.5 stars.  BF thought it was ok and gives it 3 stars (little too spicy for him).  I used boneless chicken breasts - was out of thighs but this sounded so good that I wanted to try it anyway.  I made half the recipe and then also used lesser amounts of the optional spices (1/3t red pepper flakes, 1/8t cayenne, 1/3t paprika).  Oh, I also reduced the black pepper because I knew that the amount called for was going to be too much for us.  Cut the chicken breasts in half, used half of the marinade on the meat for about 5 hours, reserved the other half.  Later, seared the meat on both sides using my grill pan (too hot outside today to grill); then reduced temp to low, covered, and cooked for about 15 mins.  Looked beautiful while cooking.  Meanwhile, simmered/reduced reserved marinade in saucepan, then added 1T of cornstarch dissolved in 1T of cold water to thicken.  Basted the chicken pieces on each side near the end of cooking.  Served over white rice, drizzled just a little of the basting sauce on top (don't spoon on too much, very flavorful sauce).  I thought the heat was perfect, great meal!!  Definitely making again!

I made this with boneless thighs and a couple of legs and it was delicious!  I did add all thhe pepper flakes and cayenne and we found it a bit too hot.  I'll add them again next time but will cut it down by half to allow the sweetness to come through.  I boiled up the marinade and mixed in some  corn starch and served as a sauce on the rice.  Soooo tasty!

I made this for the first time, being that i'm away from my mum's cooking ... and it turned out de-lish-ous! I didn't have chicken thighs or ginger and dried oregano so I just did without but I used chicken breasts instead and they turned out Great and my chicken were moist and tasty! I will make this dish again and this time use all the same ingredients-I'm sure it'll be so much tastier and better! a THUMB up to "The Big E"! Thanks!

This was pretty good - I used just a few shakes of the cayenne and paprika and left out the optional red pepper, because we are not fans of spicy. Next time I would leave out the oregano too, I don't think it blended well with the salty sweet asian flavors of soy, ginger and sugar.

Great flavor,great combination of seasonings. I was a little unsure of the oregano,but used it anyhow. I baked the thighs in the oven instead of grilling and while they were baking, the oregano made the whole kitchen smell like pizza :) I will try this on the grill next time. Very good.

Amazing! So good with the sweet and spicy combination! 
Left out the ginger and used reduced sodium soy sauce. Also baked,not grilled but only because weather did not permit.Left marinade in the pan,laid thighs skin side down and baked for half hour, flipped and drained the juices, uncovered,then broiled until crispy. Served with fried brown rice and sauteed whole green beans. Huge huge hit!

I didn't add the cayenne pepper, but followed the recipe otherwise. I only marinated it for about an hour, but then I threw it all in a pot and simmered it for another hour. It came out fantastic! A definite keeper.

Tonight, I made the Shoyu Chicken...WHAT A HIT!  This is an awesome recipe and simple to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked the chicken on my charcoal grill.  I made enough to carry us through the weekend just in case Hurricane Irene knocks out the power.

I was really excited to make this.  I let it sit in the marinade overnight.  It was very good however the smoke from it just killed my eyes while BBq'ing it.  I liked the stickiness of them from the marinade.  Next time I think I would use boneless.

I did use some boneless chicken breast instead of thighs and was still a winner. I did marinate all day, didn't discard the leftover marinade, cooked it on the stove with a tablespoon of cornstarch and hubby used it to coat the chicken while grilling on charcoal indirect heat. We read that as long as you cook the leftover meat marinade on stove to boiling you can use it to baste while cooking. Chicken was so moist and the glaze very tasty...I especially like the ginger root flavor along with the bite of hot spices.

I let this mariante overnight and it was very tasty. I was hoping for a bit sweeter taste so next time I'll cut back on the soy a bit and/or add more brown sugar

AWESOMESAUCE! Love these! I followed someone else's suggestion to put frozen thighs in a pot with the remaining ingredients and simmering for an hour. Turned out amazing! I think I may need to add a bit more water or cut the brown sugar by a bit next time though, because it got just a tad too thick. Otherwise it was perfection. :)

Made this exactly as written and it was very good marinated on bone-in skin-on chicken thighs. Our grill wasn't working so I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, then switched to broil for 3 minutes. My fiance' said it tasted better the next day after the flavor has had a chance to sit.

This chicken was delicious! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs, but followed the rest of the ingredients exactly. Marinated for about 5 hours, served over a jasmine rice recipe I found on here as well. Boiled the marinade after I took the chicken out, basted the chicken as it grilled, and drizzled over the chicken and rice. Will definitely make it again!

The flavor was delicious! I baked the chicken since it was too cold outside to grill, so the seasoning made a funny texture on the chicken. However, the juice in the pan was so delicious, I poured it over the rice on my dish. Thanks for the recipe : )

AMAZING!!!! So I didn't totally follow the recipe because I had to go off what I had around but it turned out perfectly! I used ground ginger instead of fresh, and dried chopped onion instead of fresh but other than that, I followed it to a T. The optional ingredients are a must, it has to have some heat to give it the right balance. I saved the rest of the marinade, boiled it for 5 minutes, then added about 1 to 2 T of cornstarch and it was an awesome sauce to pour over the chicken and rice. Great recipe, Thanks!

#1 SHOYU CHICKEN RECIPE ONLINE... PERIOD!!!

THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT LOOK NO FURTHER. 

THIS IS HOW ALL THE HAWAIIAN DO IT!


I AM IN SHOCK AT SOME OF THE OTHER STUPID RECIPES FOR SHOYU CHICKEN THAT RANK HIGHER THAN THIS ONE. 

THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT... Simply just add as much extra brown sugar as you want to taste. Up to double if you like. 

Personally, I like low sodium Aloha shoyu as compared to the norm, but that's just me. Other times I like it with the regular shoyu. It just depends :)

Most important thing is the plain white rice that you cook to go along with it.

Just love this recipe chef :) Thank you for sharing it with the world... You are awesome for doing so. Much Koukua :)

Ftom Maui,

Tyr

HELPFUL TIPS:  I had some boneless thighs I had to get rid of, and we never grill.  So I lined my casserole dish with nonstick foil, then laid the chicken down... and then 3/4 of the sauce.  Then after baking it at 350 for 40 min, I mixed the remaining sauce with 2T of cornstarch (mix together well).  Then baked for another 30 min.  Ohh my goodness... had that yummy chicken with sauce that stuck to it.  Servced with pineapple tidbits and rice.

We tried this last evening for the first time, and my husband cannot stop raving how fantastic these thighs are! This is a KEEPER!! And so easy. I typically read several reviews to get ideas for any tweaking so I listened to the many who said marinate this the longer, the better. I followed recipe verbatim for first try. I adjusted the serving amount to 4 portions and used 6 boneless skinless thighs. This actually allowed us leftovers. I also used Splenda Brown Sugar to cut the sugar content and did use all the optional spices which all appeal to us. Not to spicy at all. When I did remove the thighs to a plate for grilling, I reduced and thickened the remainder of the marinade on stovetop with small amount of corn starch. My husband used this during grilling to baste. This is a DELICIOUS recipe!! Thanks so much to "The Big E" for sharing!!

This was good.  I only added 1/2 cup soy sauce but made it as is otherwise.

Since I don't have a BBQ and fantasized about this recipe for a while I decided to use a pan to cook the chicken. I marinated the chicken with all the ingredients mentioned above except the onions and garlics, and I reduced the amount of brown sugar to no more than half a cup ( this depends on how sweet you prefer it to be). I let the chicken marinated for about an hour ( but i'm sure if I let it marinated longer it would be even better). In the pan, I first fried the onions and garlic, then added the marinated chicken and sauce. I let it cook slowly first covered for about 20 minutes then uncovered to let majority of the juice evaporate on med-low heat while flipping the chicken every 5 minutes and covering the chicken with sauce every now and then to make sure they remain moist and flavorful. The chicken came out PERFECT! It was a real REGAL! My husband licked his fingers. Definitely recommend trying it out.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. However, there are a few things I do differently now to make it more like the local shoyu chicken (I live in Hawaii). I omit the oregano, (or at least tone it down) Oregano does not seem to mix with the teri style taste. Also, I slow cook the chicken in the oven for at least an hour. It lets the meat absorb the flavor and makes it really soft and tender. Shoyu chicken is supposed to be slow cooked and not grilled. With the changes, my boyfriend says this chicken is "so ono!" Thank you for a great recipe.

Next time, I'm going to reserve some unused marinade so it can be poured over the chicken after grilling; it's that good. I made it with boneless breasts, which I preferred, and boneless thighs, which my wife liked better. As others have, I suggest using low sodium soy sauce. Skipped the hot pepper, as we don't like "heat". I used Penzeys California Seasoned Pepper Blend in place of the black pepper. This was delicious served with Jasmine rice and that sauce.

Excellent marinade for last minute chicken thighs. Use leftovers for chicken on cesar salad the next day. Will definitely use again. (Omitted onion, extra fresh ginger and garlic). Yum!

Followed this recipe to the T, it was so good, so good. New family favorite! Now I am updating.... I followed other reviewers and boiled the remaining marinade for 20 minutes, added some cornstarch to thicken. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. What a compliment to this recipe.

I was excited to try this, from the ingredients and reviews I was sure this would be right up our ally. We really loved it! Definite repeat recipe. I would have made this as written but I did not have any oregano. I added red pepper flakes and smoked paprika to taste and we didn't really miss it, though I'd like to try making it with the oregano as there arn't any other herbs. I also adjusted the cooking method: stovetop for an hour with frozen thighs fit much better into our schedule, and it seemed to work perfectly. Thanks so much for sharing!

I gave the recipe five stars but my first attmept was only worth three starrs. I did not have freash ginger so used powered ginger and homemade soy sauce. Next time I will use double the homeade soy sauce and no water. Can't wait to try again the skin on the chicken was stiky-sweet.

Shoyu and soy sauce are two different things. You can get shoyu at a specialty shop if you dont live in hawaii. Usually locals add ginger green onion and hoison sauce.

This chicken was awesome!  I left out the red pepper flakes and it had just the right amount of heat.  (The kids and I both don't like very spicy foods.)  I marinated it for a few hours and then baked it at 425 for 30 minutes and it was perfect.

The marinade tasted great but some how the chicken was a little disappointing. I marinated it for 2 hours and I added all of the optional ingredients. It was o.k. but didn't knock my socks off. I probably won't make this again.

My wife does not like chicken thighs at all, I LOVE them.  This is the FIRST recipe I made with chicken thighs that she LOVED.  Everything came out with a balanced flavor.  The chicken was moist and tender.  I will definitely be using this recipe at my summer party.

This recipe was a hit at my house of picky eaters.  I followed another users suggestion and put all of the ingredients (chicken thighs were frozen) into a pot and simmered for an hour.  The chicken was so tender and well flavored.  We fought over the leftovers!

This is fabulous, but as a marinade, it needs a bit of acid and oil to tenderize and moisten the chicken. I used half a cup of fresh lemon juice and half a cup of red wine vinegar in place of the water (why would you add water to dilute a marinade?), but you could substitute pineapple juice to keep the Hawaiian authenticity. I also added half a cup of vegetable oil.

This was fantastic! I used only 1/2 cup soy sauce and added a 1/2 cup of Dales seasoning. We served it with sauteed aspargus w/sliced garlic along with grilled fresh pineapples and grilled Georgia peaches. Absolutely NO leftovers

Absolutely wonderful!!  I followed the recipe exactly but then realized the marinade might be a bit too spicy for the husband, so I added 1 more cup of water and the juice from 1 can of Dole Chunk Pineappple, packed in it's own juice, about 1/2 cup. I was going to grill the pineappple along with red and yellow pepper chunks, anyway.  It was absolutely NOT too spicy.  Wonderful recipe.  Can hardly wait to marinade a slab of baby back ribs using this recipe.

I made these last night.  Almost followed the directions to a tee...the only thing I changed was that instead of a cup of water, I used 1/2 c. chicken broth and 1/2 pineapple juice.  I used very thin chicken and cooked it on the barbie...OMG...sooooooooo good.  I also rendered down the sauce and added some pineapple tidbits...and gave the leftovers to my hubby for lunch served on a bed of rice.  Very good recipe..will make again.

This was soooo good! I ended up baking at 350 degrees for just about 1/2 an hour, boiled the leftover marinade in a small pot for 12 minutes and spooned some over each piece when it had only about 10 minutes left to cook. I'm sure it's even better on the grill!***** I'm usually someone who marinates as long as possible- usually 1 to 2 days but I only had about 6 1/2 hours and it was still perfect! Thanks for a great recipe

I scaled this back making only two servings and used  chicken breasts rather than thighs.  I reserved about half the marinade for basting, and marinated in the other half for about 7 hours before grilling.  This was very good and both Hubs and I enjoyed it.  I will make this again, but I will try eliminating the water and replacing it with about a tablespoon of olive oil.  I think the oil would give this a little more “cling.”  Made as written this is very thin.  Good flavor, though, and a nice amount of “heat.”

My family has used this recipe for years.  We marinate chicken wings for up to 12 hours and then spread them on cookie sheets.  Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 hour, turning every 15 minutes.  Bake them on foil lined pan or clean up is a mess.

This was good but not amazing. My chicken did turn out really juicy. I used chicken breast because I didn't have legs. That might have made a difference.

Awesome recipe. I did cut the pepper and oregano to 1 teaspoon and omitted the red pepper flakes and cut the cayenne in half. I also skipped the water because I didn't want it to be watered down. With those cuts, I give it 5 stars. I made this for the Allrecipes Las Vegas blowout and it was an amazing hit. Thanks for sharing. I will make this over and over.

This is so good, I ate a leftover thigh cold for breakfast the next day!  This reminds me so much of the shoyu ribs our good friend in Hawaii makes for us when we visit. One of my favorite recipes on this site.

Very easy and tasty! Had to cook it in the oven because the grill was buried in the snow, but will try next summer. It was so good in the oven, I imagine it will only be better.

Great recipe, made this a couple of times for dinner. As most of you know, the longer you let this marinade, the better it tastes, but if you're short on time, at least an hour like the original instructions say  as a side note, make sure you stick to boneless and skinless. One time i only had drumsticks, so I figured I'd experiment. they took a lot longer to cook, and began to dry out. If you have to use drumsticks, try to use smaller ones, rather than the thick ones.

I made this recipe as written except I omitted the cayenne pepper (because I didn't have any on hand), and I baked the chicken instead of grilling it.  My husband and father-in-law both said they really liked it, and I liked it too.  I wasn't blown away by it, but it was good, and really easy--and that's good enough for me.  :-)

This chicken was super good.  I'm sure it would have been better with the red pepper but my daughter hates spicy food.  The marinade smells soooo good.  Thanks!

This is now one of my favorite chicken recipes! I didn't have a lot of time to let it sit in the marinade and it still tasted fabulous! Leftovers the next day were even tastier. I will definitely be making this often.

I loved it. I marinated the chicken thighs for a day. It was really soft too. Could someone explain to me why the 1 cup of water was added? I gave this a four because I believed it could have had more flavor of the soy sauce or something.  But still! It was good and I will continue to make it. I will use it on boneless chicken thighs or chicken breasts!

I cut the recipe in half, and used dried ginger since I didn't have any fresh.  I used the optional spices except for red pepper flakes, which I was out of.  The recipe turned out fabulous and even my picky teen aged daughter asked for seconds!  Like some others, I boiled the mairnade and reduced a little to make a tasty sauce.  The only change I think I'll make next time is to cut the black pepper down a little.  I thought the black pepper was a little heavy handed.

This was AH-MAZ-ING! It was moist and tender. Served with rice, it reminded me so much of the chicken served at asian place in the food court at the mall...which I've been desperately trying to replicate for years! I followed the ingredients to the letter and let it marinate in the fridge all day. I took another reviewers suggestion and boiled the remaining marinade for basting while grilling and also to serve on the side.  Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe!

Thanks for the recipe! I did not have chicken thighs so I used chicken breast. The marinade was excellent. I will definitely use this recipe again, and will also try on other meats such as spare ribs and lamb chops.

I made this chicken yesterday for Memorial Day at our annual family picnic. It was awesome. I made it exactly as the recipe said. I could not have asked for a better recipe to make chicken new again for the family. They all loved it. I got asked for the recipe more than once and I was very happy I took copies of the recipe with me. Excellent recipe. I will be making this a lot this summer. Thank you for a most delicious recipe!!!

I think the flavor in this marinade is so good! I cut the amounts of all ingredients in half, as I didn't have all that much chicken to marinate. I marinated two large chicken breasts in this for two hours. Wish I could have done it longer but ran out of time! I used dried ginger, as I had no fresh. This is delicious when paired with Pan-Fried Asparagus from this site, and some boiled baby red potatoes. Awesome!

ono! we're surrounded by great food and culinary adventures every day, but to me shoyu chicken always gonna be one of those comfort foods! this recipe is great. now it's a toss-up between this grilled kine and the slow-cooked/stewed kine (with more of a five-spice flavor) for me. love it!

I made a few substitutions, because thats what i had one hand, and used half the soy sauce, because i ran out (oops) but it was incredible! it marinated for just under an hour and even with the short time soaking, it was moist and delicious.  a keeper for sure!

You follow this recipe and I will shoyu some awesome chicken! I added the optional crushed pepper and used quarters instead of just thighs. Grilled until done about 25 mins over medium. Started basting with the marinade I boiled about halfway through. The chicken developed a beautiful mahogany color and thin crust that it was almost like the skin was still there. The flavor was a hint of sweet, some soy, and little kick from the crushed pepper and was so good. Definitely a keeper recipe and can’t wait for the leftovers!

I used an immersion blender to combine all ingredients. I added chopped dried chipotle pepper (1/4 pepper) for more smoke and fish sauce (1tsp) for deeper Asian flavour. Finished with lime juice and served on pineapple rice.

This recipe is awesome! So tasty, great sweet flavor. I decided to throw in some Garlic Sriracha spice instead of the optional spices and it was great. I will definitely be saving this recipe and using it again!! Marinating was also worth it.

This is a great marinade.  I toss it all in a blender and whirl it together.  Instead of red pepper flakes I use Sambal (Chili Garlic Sauce - careful, a little goes a long way!)  I usually use boneless skinless thighs because the cook so quickly.  If you are using a thicker cut of chicken I would suggest cooking over indirect heat so the sugar doesn't burn.

I don't add anything spicy.  I've never had it that way in all my years in Hawaii. I throw everything in a pot and boil the chicken and sauce.  The sauce reduces while cooking and it great over rice.  Serving this with Mac salad is a MUST!!!

I made this one night at my house and everybody loved it. They said it was really good.  We had kids over so I had to skip the red pepper. I loved it. Will definitely have again. I saved the marinade that I didn't need to cover the chicken and used it to baste

I have now made this recipe about 10 times, all kinds of ways, the first time i made it was in the oven, and it was soo good I just had to try it on the grill,OMG!!! the best thing out there, the consequent times i added 1 tablespoon of each of the spices (im mexican so i like it spicy) and it was just the best, ive also done this in the stove and slow cooker, but the grill is by far the best. the longer you marinate it the better, this is my favorite recipe i have found on this site. MUST TRY! i actually already know the ingridients by memory lol.

Scaled the recipe to 8 for 3 pounds chicken. Replaced water with pineapple juice. I only used 1/3 of the spices (cayanne and red pepper) because I was afraid it would be too spicy. It was just right. Served this chopped in lettuce wraps. Also marinated 24 hours and baked it in the marinade for 45 minutes. Topped the lettuce wraps with pickled cucumbers and shredded carrots.

We are not teriyaki fans, but we really enjoyed this.  I boiled two frozen breasts in the sauce for about 30 minutes and then finished them off in the oven while I let the sauce reduce.  Served over quinoa and broccoli.  My 16 month old could not get enough broccoli because it was covered in sauce, bonus!  Thanks for sharing.

Skin lovers don't fear! I loosened the skin so the marinate could get trap between the  meat and skin. Secondly the finish product didn't look as wet when finished. To over come this I sprayed a little olive oil on the chicken as it was finishing. I severed this wedges of oranges to squeeze on the chicken. My wife loved it! She added that it kicked it up a notch!

I cooked this in the oven about 6 months ago.  Came out very good.  I will make again and have the grill master of the house prepare it on the grill.

I really, really, really liked this alot! I don't have a BBQ and after reading some reviews, I actually slow cooked it. (hey, can't pass up an opportunity to use my slow cooker!) I didn't use the cayenne as I thought it would be too spicy with both the cayenne and pepper flakes. Had a good "bite" to it and came out soooo good! I thickened with a little cornstarch too, since I wasn't using it as a marinade. Delish!

The BEST chicken for the grill!! Used chicken breasts and let 'marry' for about 30 hours. Cut back on the water, soy sauce and brown sugar,but keep the spices the same.Wonderful!

Delicious!  I cooked mine in the oven at 375. The first 15 minutes uncovered, then covered with foil for another 10. It came out very juicy and well seasoned.

This recipe was fantastic!   I marinated both thighs and chicken breasts that I pounded to 1/4" thick in this marinade overnight and grilled it.  Ran out of propane and finished under broiler- chicken was moist and very tasty!  My guests gobbled it up!  I served it with pineapple skewers and white rice with diced pineapple and shredded coconut stirred in.  A hit!

We really liked this, and enjoyed the layer of slight flavor of oregano.  I cooked a breast for me and a thigh/leg for DH and served with broccoli.  I did use pickled ginger and not fresh root.

It's a great recipe. You can actually make chicken adobo, Filipino style chicken with these ingredients with addition of 1 cup vinegar, some water and bay leaves. Cook everything in a pot for 30 minutes and open the lid continue simmering until most liquid evaporates. It is delish!

This was really tasty... in small portions.  It was really very salty to me.  If I were to make it again, I would use the low sodium soy sauce in it.

MMM my favorite!! I used the exact same ingredience as the recipe calls for but instead of marinating and grilling I just threw it all together in a crockpot before I went to bed and when I woke up the chicken was fully marinated and so tender and juicy, I just shredded it up and ate over rice. I could live off this stuff! Just make sure to add some more water so the chicken is pretty much submerged, I also added a couple spoonfuls of chili paste to give it a little heat. Delicious!!

My husband said this was "the best chicken I ever made".  Whoa. What? Beep, beep, back up.  I've been grilling chicken for this man for over 30 years!  This is huge!  Epic!  Incredible!  It is an excellent, excellent dish.  I made the marinade as directed, and let the chicken marinade for 24 hours before grilling it to perfection (I used thighs and legs).  Served it with white rice and cooked carrots.  Thanks for the recipe (what a find :)

This was really easy to fix and tasted great. I let this marinate for almost 6 hours and used chicken tenders. I hated not using the marinade though for a sauce so the next time I'm going to try the stovetop method like another reviewer suggested. I used a quarter of the cayenne and crushed red pepper called for. This had barely any heat/spice to it so I will probably do half the next time. I used ginger paste instead of fresh grated.
I really liked this, DH wouldn't try since there was soy sauce and ginger involved. Lucky me, that means more leftovers for me! Thanks this was good and I would fix this again.

Would have given this 5 stars, but for me the oregano ruins it.  I think it would be perfect without the oregano because it takes the Asian essence out of it.  I should have relied on my instincts.

This was a hit with my family BBQ!  I marinated the meat the night before.  The only thing I may change next time is adding less (or none) oregano.  The 1st time I used all ingredients except cayenne pepper.

This is one of our faves. Ideally it should be done on a BBQ - it tastes exceptional but is still very good baked in a conventional oven. The chicken turns out so tender and juicy.  I also add a splash of worcestershire sauce b/c I love it. I usually serve it with Island Fried Rice from this site (leaving the meat out of the rice recipe).

Loved this one - there was a great balance of sweet with some spice.  I did add in the 'optional' cayenne, red pepper and paprika (used smoked spanish paprika too).  Despite there being no oil in this marinade, the chicken stayed juicy and moist.  Amazing recipe :)

This was ok for us. I think i left it in the oven too long. Since we don't own a grill we could not grill it. I am sure if i had not overcooked it that it would have been much better. The overall flavor was good, Someone suggested using a crock pot. I might do that next time.

I make this once a week. Its budget- friendly, DELICIOUS and it makes the house smell so good!! My boyfriend whose Grandma is a real hawaiian.. LOVES it!!! He says its exactly how his grandma's chicken use to taste like..I dont marinate it or grill it. I took  lisa thelen advice and I just put all the ingredients into a big pot and throw the chicken in without defrosting. Let it come to a boil and then I just simmer it and let it  cook in its sweet juices for 1 hour or until me and my man are ready to eat(the longer it simmers the better).  I serve it with rice.. winning combo! Also, sometimes I don't have chicken thighs So I just throw whats ever in the freezer..drumsticks,wings,breast and it comes out delicious still.. and if you're in a pinch ginger seasoning will do.. This recipe will be with me and my family for YEARS!!!

This "screams" Asian at me, and though that isn't a favourite of mine, the boys like it. I used bone-in chicken legs (with thigh) as that is what I had on hand. Reduced the soy by half and replaced it with "Mama Sita's BBQ Marinade/Sauce". Also reduced the brown sugar somewhat. Increased the garlic, and used all the optional ingredients (though I switched the oregano for marjoram). I baked this in the oven at 350F for 45 minutes. Served with rice. The boys loved this!

I did make a few changes...but just because I wanted to use what was on hand rather than make a trip to the store. I halved the recipe and made it with BS chicken breasts. I cut them in half and grilled them on the George Foreman to make sandwiches out of. I skipped the optional heat elements as my family does not like things too spicy. ((I would have enjoyed it though...)) Everyone LOVED the flavors. My kids ate more than they normally ever do so this is a definite keeper! Thanks

This dish tasted very much like traditional Hawaiian BBQ. It is cold out so I cooked it inside. I seared it first on the stove and then put it in the oven at 400. While it was cooking I added a little sake to the sauce and then reduced it on the stove until it was the consistency of teriyaki sauce. Half way through the cooking, I glazed the chicken with the sauce.

This was delicious.  I omitted the red pepper flakes, as we don't like spicy.  I also reduced the marinade to put on the chicken and rice at the end.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Next time it would be good to use Pineapple juice in place of the water and some small pineapple chunks in the marinade for the rice.

Mmm, so good!  I tasted the marinade before adding the chicken and didn't think it was all that tasty, but boy, did it cook up good!  It didn't seem Hawaiian necessarily, but it's really good!  I added the cayenne, paprika and red pepper flakes and used skinned thighs and legs.  The flavor really gets into the meat.  Hubby loved this.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good!!!  I didn't grill though, instead I threw it all together in a pot and cooked it on my stove top until the chicken was ready, about 30 minutes.

This was the best marinade ever.  I was only able to marinade for 2 hours.  I bet longer would be even better.  We are going to try this on other types of meat.  Kids and husband loved it.

Yum.  I had to cut back some of the pepper because my husband doesn't like it spicy and it was still very good.  I marinated it most of the day and it gave the chicken great flavor.

Oh so yummy... I cubed my chicken breasts for skewers in this marinade as well... The entire family loved it! Left it in the fridge before cooking for about 18 hours. Used the left over marinade for sauce as others mentioned and the kids loved putting that on their steak!

W.O.W.  What an absolutely lovely dish.  I let our marinade for about an hour and a half - I wish I had gone a bit longer, now.  I made a half batch of sauce to go with 4 thighs and saved about 3/4th of a cup of the marinade which I later reduced down to serve along with the chicken.   Fantastic marinade - I mean absolutely killer.  We grilled some pineapple to go along with meal and served with peas and yellow saffron rice.  Thank you SO much!

Awesome recipe! I skinned the chicken thighs,  marinated them or 4 hours,  baked them in the oven on 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then finished them on the grill. I boiled the marinade, as suggested by others. I used half the marinade to baste the chicken & the other half as a sauce for the stir fried snow peas I served on the side. I can't wait to make this again. Thanks!

I wanted to love this - all the flavors really sounded like they'd go together really well to create an extraordinary chicken dish and I marinated extra long (24hrs +) due to change in dinner plans. While it was good, it certainly wasn't great or memorable in any way. I thought adding all the brown sugar would make it too sweet and the soy sauce too salty, but it did end up balancing nicely. It just didn't excite the palate!

Fantastick!  I cut the recipe in half just to try it.  I can't wait to make it again.  This is just great as is. I stuck to the original recipe but made in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes and 400 for 15 minutes. We loved it.

I made kabobs for my husband's fantasy football draft party.  I used the Shoyu recipe as the marinade for my chicken, peppers, and onions.  I marinated them overnight (in separate gallon- and quart-sized bags), included all the "optional" ingredients, and got rave reviews!  The guys loved the spicy kick from the marinade in contrast with the sweet, fresh pineapple. This was definitely better than any teriyaki marinade we've tried!

Yummy!  I made this chicken last night for the family.  As someone else suggested, I put everything in a big pot & boiled it for an hour +.  The boys loved it!  So easy. Not too spicy ~ although I did not include the cayenne.  :-)

This is a very good marinade for grilled chicken, followed the recipe with the exception of a little extra garlic because I like it. Halved the recipe and used it on three pounds of hindquarters. I was worried it might be too spicy, but actually think I will add a little more cayenne next time.

I made this exactly as stated (but in a smaller quanity) along with the options.  I marinated it for several hours and baked it in the oven.  Served it with brown rice and baked sweet potato - it was a great combo. Our first bite seemed like it was going to be way too hot - second & third bite was heavenly.  Our mouths must have gotten used to it - we have really just started to use hotter spices - and enjoying them!! Oh yes - I used bone in chicken thighs - cause thats what I had.
THANKS

This was a fantastic grilled chicken dish. My husband and 21 month old daughter both loved it. I served it with grilled corn on the cob, fried peppers, and couscous. I will definitely make this again!

This has been one of my family favorite for years.  I have just a couple of things I do differently. I use a 1/2 cup each brown sugar and pineapple juice and reduce the water to 1/2 cup. I also use green onion, and have never added oregano, or paprika. We usually get enough heat from the crushed red pepper and haven't had a need for the cayenne either. Everyone raves and wants the recipe. Enjoy!

Absolutely yummy!  We had to broil it (400º F) for 6 minutes on each side and then leave it in the oven (which we turned off) for about 15-20 minutes more instead of grilling it, but it was delicious.  We had bone-in thighs, marinated for 1 day, and I used Tamari sauce to keep it gluten-free.  It's delicious cold, too!

I marinated the chicken in a large glass bowl in the fridge over night.  At first my husband tasted the marinade & said it tasted a little plain.  I told him to leave it alone, that it was a new recipe & I didn't want him messing with it.  Then my husband grilled it.  My husband said it was best chicken he's ever had!  It was totally delicious!  We will make this again for family & company.  Thank you for this recipe!  : )

Delicious.  I used all the spices labeled as optional but did not find this overly spicy at all.  Served with white rice and green salad.  This is a keeper.

I got this recipe this week and made the Shoyu Chicken tonight and it was so moist and tasty my husband and I both raved about this recipe.  Again I find a winner on Allrecipes and will be watching for more great recipes to try.

I scaled the recipe to 3 servings as I had only 1.5 lbs of thighs. I used green onion for the white, ginger and chili paste for the grated ginger and red pepper flakes. I let it marinate overnight so the meat was very tender and flavourful, I just felt something was missing maybe lemon juice or a spice? I have been to Hawaii numerous times but don't remember eating this there so I have nothing to compare to.

Excellent.
Found this recipe and had to try it.  Tried some Shoyu Chicken on a vacation in Kauai, it was the best food of the trip.  This recipe tastes just like the original on the island. 
Marinated overnight and baked the chicken in the oven until it fell off the bone. 
Definately a keeper.   Thanks for sharing.

Tried this without changing much.  Marinated for about six hours and grilled.  Careful when grilling as it burns very easy.  Will definitely be doing again.

It was delicious the first day I let it marinate but OUTRAGEOUS the second day!  It truly brought out the flavor and down some of the heat.  I am definately making again but with half the hot spices and letting it marinate for 2 days!

I loved this flavor combination!  I cooked my chicken in a cast iron, and the sauce reduced beautifully into a yummy glaze. The recipe calls for way too much black pepper, so I cut down on that.  Served with jasmine rice.  SOOO good I wanted it the next night!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! I used breast which I marinated for at least 5 hrs. I also used the marinade as a sauce by boiling, adding a little cornstarch slurry to thicken, then shimmered until the meat was finished on the grill. I served it over jasmine rice. Rave reviews from my husband, but I thought it was a little too spicy (and I love spice)I’ll probably tone it down some next time, but definitely adding this meal to the regulars for rotation.

All I can say is wow! This recipe was great! I use chicken leg quarters and I marinated them for an hour and then grilled them at medium heat for 20 minutes on each side. This recipe was a hit with my family. The only bad thing was I didn't make enough chicken and they wanted seconds and possibly thirds for the next day! The sauce was a little on the spicy side but my kids and husband love spicy anyway. As long as you don't put any extra marinaid on the chicken it's all good as far as spiciness is concerned. I served it with white rice and mixed vegetables and the kids actually poured some of the sauce onto their white rice. This recipe will be a hit and I know that my family will request me to make this over and over again thank you so much for such a great recipe!

Great taste.  I gave it four stars because shoyu makes a lot of smoke in the oven and I live in an apartment.  I placed ingredients in the crock pot and cooked on high for 4 hours.  Yummy!  I will make this again.  Thank you.

Fantastic! My husband doesn't like Chinese food, but he loved this chicken.
- Omitted the oregano and red pepper flakes. Any more "spicy" would have been too much.
- Used 2 Tbs powdered garlic
- Marinated a pre-cut whole fryer chicken, about 3.5 lbs., for about 2 hours.
- Baked on 400 for 20 minutes and then 375 for 40 minutes. 
- Reduced leftover sauce to BBQ consistency. 
- When chicken had about 10 minutes left, I applied thickened Shoyu sauce.
- Served with rice and pineapple. 

Hubby gave it a big "thumbs up" and said the recipe is a keeper! He even took the leftover as a chicken sandwich for lunch today. :)

This was really good and so easy! I made it exactly as it suggested. I just marinated it overnight and then the entire day while I was at work. Then we grilled the chicken on the grill that evening. It was delicious! I usually need condiments or sauces for chicken, but this turned out so good I didn't need any.

I had to use ginger & garlic powder, but I don't think this made much difference - the chicken was delicious. I used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and cooked them on the BBQ at low heat. The skin side will burn due to the sugar, but I remove it anyway.

I also followed the advice given by another reviewer  and boiled down the marinade in a pot over low heat - after an hour or so it thickened right up and made for a delicious sauce to pour over the cooken chicken. I'll be making this recipe again (and again). :)

When I made this, I made the marinade, stuck it in a zip lock bag with frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs and took it camping.  The chicken thawed in the marinade, when I was ready to cook it, I took them out of the bag, threw them on the grill, came out exactly perfect and delicious.

Absolutely loved it.  I probably won't use so much pepper next time though, it was a bit much for me.  I also left the skins on the chicken.

This recipe was awesome, followed it to a tee and it turned out perfect. The sauce is a nice balanced flavour but very robust. This ones going in the personal cookbook.

Cooking chicken on the grill is a "thing" for me. I do it year-round, at least once a week. Based on the many positive reviews, I made this recipe as written. It was good, but even for a guy who loves hot/spicy, the amount of cayenne overpowered some of the other flavors. To bring things back into balance, I'd suggest using 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne, rather than a full teaspoon. I'll be putting this recipe into my regular grilling rotation.

Thighs WITH skin!  This would make the ultimate wings. I marinated for two hours. I can see marinating for longer as some did for the grill treatment but I didn't do that. I put the chicken and the marinade in an oven safe roasting pan and simmered on the stovetop for twenty minutes, turning once, then put it in the oven at 375 and started my rice.  When the rice was done I had a tasty reduced sauce laden with carmelized onions and beautiful chicken with skin to tell your friends about. Paired it with a store bought ginger back choy salad.

My husband and I both LOVE this recipe!  Matter of fact, I just shared it with a family member who had it while visiting with us some time ago.  I pretty much make the recipe exactly as it says, and it turns out delicious every time.  My husband requests this quite often!

This is good. However I would not discard the marinade, I would reduce it on the stove then baste it on the chicken while grilling. I opted to cook it in the marinade on the stove, adobo style. The sauce was great over rice as well. I'll have to try baking it in the oven with the marinade when it's cooler out next time. Instead of the  tsp. of cayenne pepper and tsp. of chili flakes I used two tsps. of sriracha sauce. It was not too spicy that way and the whole family loved it, even the kids!

I changed nothing. Thank you. It was perfect and made the chicken very moist.  Served it with pineapple and rice.  I reduced the leftover marinade by boiling it and poured it in the rice and chicken.  Yummy !!

My family loves this recipe, I make it at least twice a month. I pound out my chicken pretty thin first, and make an extra batch of marinade to thicken and use as sauce when serving. I cook it on the George Foreman grill, and scoop out the onions and place them on top of each piece.

Son likes borboun chicken from Asian chao. He claims that this taste just like that. He is always asking me to make this when I ask him wut he wants for dinner. I use low sodium soy sce and ginger pwdr. U can use drippings over rice to incorporate flavor throughout entire dish.

This is a keeper! Everyone I've ever served this to raves about it. It's excellent cooked over a Weber or baked in the oven. Everything is better over fire, right? :-) I served with sauteed asparagus and baked sweet potatoes. Pretty colors - but the star is definitely the chicken. Also, it's much better with thighs. Thanks for a great recipe!

Whether it is "authentic" shoyu chicken or teriyaki chicken is unimportant.  What is important is that this recipe ROCKS.  The marinade is a sublime blend of sweet and savory flavors that we all loved.

Can not say enough good things about this! That sauce is the best thing I ever had. Loved it all. I'd just add maybe a ciabatta loaf of the side for that sauce because of how good it is. Unreal!

This is one of my favorite grilled chicken recipes.  I have no idea if this can be considered traditional Shoyu.  Regardless, it stands very well on its own.

Easy and super delicious recipe! Only marinated for an hour bc I was rushed and  I cooked them in the oven on 375 degrees for 15 min each side. Made for a Hawaiian themed potluck and I felt like I was eating from a legit Hawaiian bbq joint, will use again!

We really loved this marinade on our chicken thighs!  Grilling the meat creates a nice caramelized/sticky coating on the chicken, making it super yummy!  I didn't expect to like this marinade as much as we did--definitely going to be repeated in our house often.  Also, the leftovers taste just as yummy the next day!  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious chicken recipe! I added a handful of star anise, shakes of Worcestershire sauce, tons of red pepper flakes and let it marinade for 3-4 hours. Before putting the boneless, skinless chicken inside, save some extra marinade to cook on the stove top with cornstarch to thicken it up. After grilling, pour the cooked sauce over rice and vegetables...and of course, the chicken. Love!

Other than going easy on the heat, I followed this recipe, but baked it at 400 degrees for about a half hour.  Very good! Started the whole process at 3:45, and we were eating by 6.  I don't think the short soak (just about an hour) is too little - it was well seasoned.

Meh. Don't know what I'm missing. This was just another teriyaki-ish chicken dish with an added overwhelming onion element to us. We ate it, but not the leftovers. Don't think I'll bother repeating.

This recipe is so good and easy. I marinated the chicken, and planned on baking it. I read some of the reviews and others put it on the stovetop so I decided to try it. The flavors were amazing but I'd bake it the next time to brown the chicken more instead of boil. I served with rice and steamed broccoli and cabbage. Definitely a keeper!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and marinated for about 5 hours and then grilled.  During grilling, I basted about 3 times each side.  Great recipe, thank you!

Loved it. Threw a can of pineapple chunks in the marinade and let it sit overnight.  I also thickened the leftover marinade with cornstarch as some of the other reviews suggested.  Brushed it on while grilling.  Amazing. Served it with "Sweet Corn Cake" and"Hawaiian Mac Salad".... both recipes from this site.  My 8 year old son asked why I'm not a "professional cooker" :)

If you replace the shoyu sauce with fruit punch concentrate it makes a less salty yet still a hawaiian taste.

I made this for my husband and my in-laws and they really liked it, so I made it again for my side of the family and everyone LOVED it.  My mom and brother even asked me for the recipe!  I reserved part of the marinade and thickened it on the stove with cornstarch, and then I brushed the chicken with it towards the end of grilling.  Delicious.  Thank you for such a crowd pleasing recipe!

I love this recipe, as does my family. We haven't grilled it yet, however, we are cooking it on the stove, with all ingredients it is so yummy. I would love to try it grilled, but we live in the desert and are waiting until cooler temperatures to grill it. We serve it with jasmine rice with fresh green onions sliced on top. Sometimes with assorted vegetables cooked in some of the seasoning sauce is very good. Since first trying it, we have had it every weekend, it is addictive. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this several times. I have used boneless and bone-in chicken thighs, and both taste great.  I bake these on a broiler pan @ 375 degrees for about 30-40 mins. However, I would recommend basting the chicken with a pastry brush about every 10 mins, otherwise it can dry out. When marinating, remember to rotate the chicken half way through.

This chicken was a hit. Instead of grilling, it was baked in a pan with the marinade.  It turned out juicy and tender.  Thank-you for this flavorable recipe.

This was delicous, I used 5 lbs chicken drumsticks and thighs and marinated for a day and a half.  I cooked on low heat on the grill for longer than the time stated.  Will make again I'm sure, but will probably scale the recipe down, as I won't be cooking for a crowd next time!

I unintentionally marinated it for about a day and it tasted fantastic! I was in a hurry when making the marinade and used garlic powder, onion powder and ginger powder and halved the recipe as I didn't have 5 lbs of chicken. Great marinade! I will be making this again for sure! Thank you for a great tasting and simple recipe!

I have made this several times using suggestions from other reviews.  It is good grilled but if you really want the intense flavor of the marinade you have to boil the chicken in it. This is so good served over rice with alot of the marinade.

I followed the recipe exactly, and surprisingly enough our chicken was very bland. I will try this again, but I will definately add salt and some more seasonings. BTW I let our chicken marinate for two days.

My family has some very picky eaters and everyone liked this dish.  That is pretty amazing in my book.  I followed the flavors exactly but I used boneless, skinless chicken breast cut up into large chunks and cooked it on the stove top.  I also boiled the marinade and cooked it down, thickening it with some corn starch and serving it over rice.  I am adding this to my regular rotation, because I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE FLAVOR OF THIS DISH.

We really enjoyed this.  We don't care for chicken thighs very much, so I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead.  Because some of the reviewers mentioned that this was pretty spicy, I omitted the red pepper flakes and reduced the amount of black pepper.  I did add about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little heat.  I also didn't have any fresh ginger root, so I used about a teaspoon of ground ginger.  With these modified measurements, the flavor was fantastic without the heat being overpowering.  I also want to try this marinade on salmon sometime!

Awesome!!!  I made with chicken breasts in the slow cooker, I also marinated overnight in fridge.  After cooking in the slow cooker for about 6 hours I shredded the chicken and served over steamed rice with veggies.  I reserved some sauce to thicken and drizzle over the top.  Because I was serving to kids I used 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and no paprika.  The kids and I thought it was great, my spice loving husband wanted more kick.  So, next time I will add the spice in a portion of the sauce I thicken for him.  :)  I marinated with 12 breasts and cooked four.  We had plenty for lunch the next day and I froze the rest in baggies to use later. Thank goodness we liked it!  And I can't wait to share with all my family and friends this summer!

Made as stated except used bonless skinless breast and dried ginger as that is what I had.  I did use all the optional seasoning.  Marinaded for about 4 hours.  This turned out pretty spicy- Hubs and I loved it but the kids wouldn't touch it.  I boiled the marinade just before grilling for about 15 minutes and used it for basting.  Will make again!

This marinade is delish!  I have used it with chicken both b/s breasts and thighs.  Also big kabob sized cubes with the chicken.  Enjoyed it so much we marinated pork chops in it as well and grilled.  Yum!

This recipe is AMAZING!!  I live in VA but spent a lot of time in Hawaii for work and everytime I make this chicken it brings me back!  The perfect mix of spicy and sweet.  The only thing I do differently is use the low sodium soy sauce.  I love when it gets a little extra char from the grill... that's when it's the best :).  Great paired with some grilled pineapple rings.  Props to the creator, LOVE IT!

Big Hit!!  My daughter made this as part of a Girl Scout badge step where she needed to make a regional recipe.  Everyone really liked it, we found it quick and easy.  next time I will probably make it a little easier, I don't usually keep ginger root on hand so will substitute for ground.  I don't think we used all the garlic but our cloves were quite large.  I might use a little less oregano.

My husband asks for this ALL the time.  He loves it and so do I.  The flavors are simple but very complex.  We use chicken breasts, cut into chunks and then marinate for at least two hours.  We then put them on Kabob sticks and grill them on the BBQ.  We eat it with Fried egg, sticky brown rice, and cabbage -- excellent!

Thanks Big E!  I only used the shoyu, brown sugar and water and boiled until falling apart.  It was broke da mouth!  Next time I will add a bit of grated ginger.  The kids say thanks for this recipe too.

We've made this twice so far and really enjoyed it both times.  The first time we made it we used 3 chicken breast and halved the marinade since it seemed like a lot.  We grilled them and they turned out really well.  The second time,we cut 3 chicken breasts into chunks, added the marinade and let it sit over night.    This time though I used the full amount for the marinade.  We skewered the chicken grilled it.  My husband and I liked it even more the second time.  The flavors were able to set in even more and it had just the right amount of kick to it.  Not so much that we were miserable, but enough so that you could feel the heat.  We didn't find it that spicy the first time.  Served with grilled mixed veggies and grilled sliced pineapple.  Made a great meal!

This was my first time using thighs & I was a bit grossed out by them raw, truth be told. They were really moist & tasty tho. I did feel there was something missing in the ingredients & I think I would replace the water with pineapple or apple juice if I were to make this again. My DD commented to her dad that they tasted just like the frogs legs they had at a restaurant on vacation, which promptly ended my meal, but the rest of the family really liked them :)

We loved this recipe!   The flavor was wonderful!  The only thing I did different was add a little less black pepper than it called for and marinated it for about 12 hours so it would have more flavor.   We will definitely be making this again.

After I made this & tasted it, it made me homesick for Hawai'i. The flavor of all of the spices together is indescribable!!! I let it marinade for a day and a half and then barbequed it. Next time, think I will make extra marinade aside from the chicken, reduce it, and use it as a sauce to pour over the chicken. Was ecstatic with this recipe!!!

I left the skin on and it came out great.  I left it on a few minutes longer because of that, and it came out juicy and tender.  I also marinated overnight to get more flavor in the meat.  The chicken was very flavorful.  

Good recipe!

I'm really surprised by the reviews based off my dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly, however, I agreed with the reviewer who replaced water with stock (why miss a chance to add more flavor).  I found the chicken infused with color and moist overall, but the flavor was anything but bold...despite many cautioning the 24 hour marinade.  It desperately needed salt and had little heat (I did add the crushed red pepper and a pinch of cayenne).

Amazing!  Marinated for 48 hours in everything except the cayenne pepper and the onion (I subbed in dried onion flakes as I has no onions on hand), and cooked in the oven for 40 mins @ 350F.  It is DEFINITELY a spicy dish!  My other half insisted on making another serving of the marinade to use as a sauce - not a bad idea, though our mouths were on fire for a while!  Next time, will just serve the chicken as is, with no extra marinade, to keep the spiciness down a bit :)  Excellent recipe, definitely a keeper!

This was a good marinade.  I marinated my chicken for almost 24 hours based on what some other reviewers said, but it was too long.  I will make this recipe again, but only marinate for 3-4 hours and I will leave out the oregano.

Made the marinade as directed (used paprika, but did not use cayenne or red pepper), but did not marinate or grill the chicken. Instead, i poured the marinade into a medium pot with four chicken thighs (the marinade was just enough to cover the four thighs), brought to a boil, and then simmered for 45 minutes or so. The results are fall-off-the-bone chicken in a delicious sauce that's awesome over rice!

We loved it! I couldn't grill it so I baked it in the oven @ 400 for an hour. I used a whole cut up chicken with no skin and left a little marinade in the bottom to baste chicken as it cooked. I poured the rest of the marinade into a sauce pan and cooked it for 10 minutes then thicken it with cornstarch like other reviewer suggested. It was a perfect sauce and the flavor was amazing. I only changed 2 things. I didn't use an onion but onion powder and I used ginger paste not root.

Delicious! I didn't put any option spices for kids.Used boneless skinless thigh meat.Oregano makes it little different than usual teriyaki chicken. This will be on my regular menu now!Yummy!

my son called it the "best chicken ever!"  I did cut the optional ingredients in half because I was worried it would be too spicy for my kiddo's tastebuds.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe turned out amazing and was real crowd pleaser!  Extremely flavorful and moist!!  This will definitely be a recipe that I make over and over again.  I made it with chicken breasts to cut some calories, but I'm sure making it with chicken thighs would be to die for.  Enjoy!

Really great and much tastier alternative to terriyaki chicken.  I am a pretty good cook but always have trouble finding tasty grill recipes especially with chicken but this was AWESOME.  Definately a keeper especially if you like spicey foods.

I tried this recipe and my family loved it,the only thing i did different is i added crushed pineapple to the mix and insted of putting it on the grill i put it in my rotisserie,and i think it turned out better then on the grill,it stated very juciey and moist. i do think that the longer you let the chicken sit in the marrinaide,the more flavorful it is,i let mine sit over nite, just simply deliciouse,we have had it 3times this week.

Awesome recipe, I added a small can of pineapple chunks and juice to marinade and after removing chicken to grill I boiled the remaining marinade for 5-10 minutes and added cornstarch to thicken.  It made a great sauce over the chicken and jasmine rice.  YUM!!

I thought this was good. I did marinate over night and I think it took away from the recipe. The flavor was great I will make again but not marinate for so long.

Used 4 large chicken breasts and cut recipe in half. Used ground ginger since I didn't have fresh. I did include the red pepper flakes and paprika but didn't have the cayenne. I added all the ingredients into a large gallon size ziploc baggie sealed it, and squished to mix. Then added the 4 breasts, sealed it, laid it flat so breasts didn't overlap on cookie tray, and put it in fridge. After 2 hrs I flipped bag over and let set 2 more hours. Grilled breasts on stove top grill about 10 minutes each side and boiled leftover marinade for at least 10 minutes. Then added about 2 tbsp corn bread mix (didn't have corn starch) to thicken it up.  Plated it up on white rice and spooned sauce marinade over the top of the chicken. Added a side of grilled bell pepper to complete the dinner.  Very tasty with a little kick to it.  My husband loved it and the bell pepper seemed the perfect veggie to go with it.  Leftovers heated up well the next day but seemed to have gotten spicier.

We followed this recipe exactly, and did not care for it at all. We let the chicken marinade overnight and then grilled it; the chicken had a really strong oregano taste, and we actually ended up having left over enchiladas. We will not be making this again.

i'm not from hawaii so i don't know what 'real' shoyu chicken tastes like, but this came out REALLY tender and flavorful!! it's rare that i get these recipes right on the first try which is why i have to give this five stars. i left out the ginger root, red pepper flakes, and paprika since i didn't have any at home, but it still tasted good. the cayenne pepper really gave it a kick. i think if i added the red pepper flakes it would've been way too spicy for me.

i also decided to marinate this overnight, and i believe that's the best way to do it because the flavor really soaked itself into the chicken. since i don't have a grill, i followed another reviewer's suggestion and cooked it in a big pot for 45 min - simmered it on medium/low. i also used low sodium chicken stock instead of water. i also cut down on the soy sauce b/c i thought it would be way too salty, and it still came out perfect. i will def be making this again! so fast and easy!

Absolutely, positively the best chicken recipe I've come across in a very long time. My family keeps asking when I'm going to make "that awesome chicken" again. Other than adjusting the level of heat, no changes - sheer perfection!

I used boneless skinless chicken breast and while I thought it was a very good Asian marinade, I wasn't as blown away as most of the reviewers.  I'm not so sure a bottle of teriyaki wouldn't yield much the same result with much less effort and expense.

I didn't change one thing about this recipe and it was fantastic!!!  I lived in Hawaii for 6 years and boy did this bring me back.  I actually marinated my chicken for over 24 hours and the flavor was wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.

Yummy!! I used 10lbs of chicken so our family of 5 could all have leftovers but I only scaled the marinade to 1 1/2 and found it to be plenty. I marinated over night and all day and rotated the pieces half way through. Followed the recipe exactly but used less of the spicy stuff so it wouldn't be to hot for the youngest. Looked as beautiful as it tasted. Served it with fried rice.

Yummy! I even had a little accident with the grill and a few pieces of chicken got burnt and it was still super yummy. My bf says it reminded him of a bourbon chicken.

I recently moved from Hawaii to Delaware and I was craving Hawaiian food, so I was really excited to find this recipe.  When I mixed it smelled like I was hoping and before I let the chicken marinate it, it tasted fine.  However, the flavor of the chicken didn't come out like I was hoping.  I did bake it, so it might have been the reason.  Thank you for having this recipe, but it didn't quite work out for me.

I also cannot give this 5 stars because i did not grill it, i put it in the oven at 375 for about an hr.  It didn't taste like the shoyu chicken i had growing up on Maui but it was still very good, and i didnt even have the ginger or the oregano.  It made a good sause for the rice too.

I made this last night. I gave it 5 stars because my husband loved it. I personally did not. But that was just a matter of personal taste. I thought that the ingredients' flavors very nicely complimented each other, though. I followed the recipe to a t, pairing it down for 8 servings. I also cut the cayenne in half, and even then it had too much heat for me (I'm a wuss though!) Overall, it was a good recipe. Worth making again. Hubby liked so much he ate 4 pieces for dinner, and then 2 more later in the evening. Kids even liked it...THAT surprised me, they are super picky. I made fried rice to go with it, and saved the marinade (gasp-call the food police!) to make a sauce. (just a bit of advice, boil any marinade juices for a bit so kill any weird raw-chicken funk hiding in there) I had to add some vinegar to the sauce to counter the sweetness. Again, daddy liked :)

This was pretty good, but I wish it had a little more flavour. The marinade just didn't seem to penitrate very far into the chicken. I actually marinated it for about 10 hours instead of just the 1. The flavour it did have was very yummy, though.

Fantastic recipe.  Added all of the optional ingredients.  I used the marinade for chicken kebabs.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and marinated them for two hours before cutting into chunks for the kebabs.  I set about a 1/4 cup aside and used it to brush on the kebabs when they were about done.  The kebabs had pineapple on them and the marinade did wonders for it.  Really good recipe.

I thought this recipe was great! The only things I did differently was try chicken thighs and breasts (both came out tender with an overnight marinade) I also pan fried them, then threw in the extra marinade at the end to make a nice sauce to put over rice. Also added some chopped fresh pineapple at the very end. My 3 little boys and husband all loved it too!
*after making it a bunch of times I no longer use paprika. I caramelize onions and sautée mushrooms add them in at the end. I still use fresh pineapple to go with. I make coconut flavored rice to go on the side. Fantastic!

Maybe it was the oregano I used, or maybe how long I marinated (overnight), but though this was good, it just didn't win any awards. I may add pineapple juice and omit the oregano and see what that does.

Okay, made this again with good oregano and all the correct ingredients. Marinated for 2-3 hours before grilling for a potluck Served with sticky rice and WOW. Everyone was quite impressed and wants the recipe! Should I share? :D  Tip: DO boil the marinade and reduce, then strain. So good as a sauce on rice!

This marinade was EXCELLENT!!!  After removing the chicken from the marinade I cooked the marinade for a while, put some corn starch in cold water and then added it into the marinade to thicken it and while it was grilling I brushed on the marinade.  EVERYONE LOVED it and asked when I was making it again!!!!!

This is a family favorite in our house! I use boneless, skinless thighs and marinate for the day until ready to cook. The chicken always comes out tender and flavorful with just the right amount of crispy, carmelized goodness around the edges. Great with yellow rice or jasmine/lime rice and steamed broccoli.

Great grill recipe using chicken wings and overnight marinade. Using a Weber kettle, place wings over drip pan opposite medium fire of lump charcoal. Set top vent to 50% and let run 45 minutes to 1 hour. Wings will be done perfect and no charring.

This recipe as made on the bbq is great. I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. However, the way to make it on the stovetop, as suggested by another reviewer, didn't do it for me. I tried and the texture of the chicken wasn't nearly as good, nor was the seasoning (too sweet). So this recipe still gets 5 stars because when made as per directions, it turns out fantastic.

Very tasty recipe and a different flavor than just teriyaki. I made a major change which I think made it better. I did the wet marinade as directed. But then I took the dry ingredients and made a rub out f it. So once it was done marinading, I dried the chicken, and then rubbed them down with the spices. I thought it came out pretty good! If you go this method I would definitely cut back on the brown sugar though! Something to try next time.

There are two things to keep in mind when reading my review.

1) I'm a foodie. I can decypher taste, smell, texture, etc.
=but=
2) It takes a lot out of me to want to cook. I'd rather my meals prepared for me by a chef, or alternative.

With that out of the way; THIS DISH IS SO EASY TO MAKE AND IS SOOO GOOD, OMG! It instantly became a fan favorite and I've made it twice already.

I baked it in the oven, separated the chicken skin/fat, and then broiled it to crisp, Pro-tip; service with coconut rice and buttered carrots.

BOOM! First review on here ;)

We enjoyed this a lot! I've made it a few times now and it's been a hit every time. Plus, I usually really dislike leftover chicken, but this one works great for lunches the next day. My only tweak was to use Coconut Aminos instead of soy, due to an allergy. Coconut Aminos taste just like soy but with less sodium. I also baked the chicken in the marinade and then finished them on the grill. By baking the marinade with the chicken, it was safe to use as a sauce. I separated the onion s and solid bits from the juice, added corn starch and honey to what was left and had a great "teryaki" type sauce for spooning over the finished product. Delicious!

Grilling boneless chicken thighs for 30 min? When internal temp reaches 163 degrees, pull them off.  That usually happens about 7 min per side on my Weber grill.

This is delicious!!  I used the suggestion of substituting pineapple juice for the  water and I used green onions for the onion.  I also used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano, since that was all I had.  cooked it on the grill, very yummy!!  I omitted the pepper flakes, but did add 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, which I think I will omit next time.  Also I prefer it a bit sweeter, so I may add more brown sugar next time or possibly honey.  Either way I will definitely make this again!!

This was delicious.  I upped the red pepper flakes and cayenne by half again and it wasn't too spicy for us.  Marinated about 6 hours and cooked on the grill.  I boiled the marinade and thickened it up with cornstarch.  Served with Jasmine rice with the sauce drizzled over it.

Great marinade made the chicken tender and juicy. I grilled on the BBQ and the tender meat started to fall apart (perhaps it was bc I used a boneless skinless thighs) for next time I will use bone-in skin-in thighs and a grill grate. Added a little bit of corn starch slurry to the marinade and reduced it. Tasted excellent. Thank you for the recipe!

I didn't have brown sugar, so I used molasses.  I also threw in a splash of limeade.  It apparently was so amazing that there was no chicken left by the time I arrived home!

I made this with chicken tenderloins, and since it's winter in the midwest, I put them in the broiler on high for 6 minutes per side.  5 minutes would probably do, but they were still great!  I'm thinking next time I will then cook the left over marinade to serve over the chicken and rice.  I did not add any of the optional ingredients, but did everything else exactly as it said...maybe a bit less ginger.  I did 2 tsp worth, I believe.  I only had barely an hour to marinade, but it was very well received by all.

Saved marinade. Added toasted sesame seeds. Cooked asparagus, pea pods, pineapple, broccoli in Mirin, rice wine vinegar and soy sauce. Put mango on top. It is quite delicious, would make again.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breast because that is what I had on hand. Also used low-sodium soy sauce. Marinated for 3 hours and grilled. OH MY! Sooooooooooo good! Will make again and again! Thank you for sharing!

Thanks for the delicious recipe!  I seasoned the chicken just like the recipe, only I didn't bbq because it was raining for days here.

I marinated chicken overnight and put chicken and all marinated sauce in slow cooker the next morning.  I cooked on low for 5 hours.  When get home from work, i just broil chicken in oven for 5 minutes each side to get better look and flavor.  Pour all the sauce to sauce pan, add 1 TBsp of cornstarch and boil to your desired thickening. Pour the sauce over chicken and serve with white jasmine rice.  Yum! "It's tasty!"  That's what hubby said (without be asked :) )

This is my favorite marinade for chicken thighs. I put all the optional ingredients in and marinade it overnight. The whole family loves this chicken! After the chicken reaches 165 degrees I like to put it over high direct heat and carmelize that yummy marinade.

Ok. So one of my pet peeves about this site. I wish they had used dry seasonings throughout the recipe vs the actual vegetable. Yes i know fresh is best. But some sort of conversion of dry to fresh would be nice when you are making the dish.

Made it in the oven at 400 for 45 min. Cooked the marinade on the stove top with T of cornstarch. Served with rice and poured the sauce over the chicken and rice. Served with roasted veggies and pineapple and it was a huge hit!.

Yummy! I made a few changes. I used almost 3 1/2 lbs of chicken, so I had to half all the ingredients. I didn't have ginger root, so I used ground ginger instead.  After marinating the thighs in the fridge for 24 hours, I put them and all of the marinade in a 9x13 casserole pan. I did not cover them. The thighs were done in 45 minutes at 375. I poured these bad boys and the marinade over white rice and called it a day. My boys loved it. My son, who loves spicy food, said to add more spices next time. Trust me, it doesn't need more spices! ;)

Delicious and tons of flavor!  I marinated the chicken overnight and used green onions instead of white. It was cold and rainy tonight so I baked it in the oven for 40 min at 375. Next time if I bake it, I will only do 30 min as it was a bit over cooked but still tasted wonderful.  I can only imagine it being even better and more flavorful on the grill. Who cares if it’s really a teriyaki or shoyu chicken, this is fantastic chicken that I’ll be making regularly. Thank you for sharing!

So good, have both baked it and put in slow cooker (because too cold and rainy to bbq) and it turned out great. Used boneless skinless chicken thighs and slow cooking them made them fall apart similar to pulled pork. Yum!

I made this for friends  on New Years Eve and it was a huge hit! 
I included all of the optional ingredients and I let the chicken marinade for 6 hours. I was thinking of making this for my daughter's bridal shower...it is definitely on the menu!

Great recipe, I understand critics feel it is not original if grilled but it came out excellent and is on my winter rotation. Easy to make  and there is something about chicken thighs that  unlocks  a lot of flavor that you do not get with white meat.

Fantastic.  The more it is marinated the better it tastes.  Making it the same night won't have much taste, but a day after or later it is fantastic.

I made this in the slow cooker rather than bbq. I also used low sodium soy sauce as the amount of sodium in this recipe is huge and concerning for ppl watching their blood pressure. Otherwise, it was ok. I think next time I might use less soy sauce and tweak it with some peppers and pineapple.

The recipe is very good. Although, cannot stress enough that the longer you marinade the chicken, the better the taste. 1 hr minimum does it no justice.

Very delicious! We don't have a grill because we live in an apartment, but they still turned out great in the oven.  Also, used this recipe for some meal prep and froze some of the cooked chicken thighs. The chicken reheated great as well.

YUMMY! What a treat! Followed the recipe exactly but baked for 35 minutes at 400?. I followed the suggestion by several reviewers of simmering the marinade for 10-15 minutes after adding 1/2 to 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Basted the thighs twice during baking; once near the beginning and once again 4 minutes before done. The chicken was succulent, tender, and delicious with a bit of tangy kick. Wonderful! Will be making often. Thanks so much.

I followed the recipe except for adding red pepper flakes & let the thighs soak in the marinade for a couple of hours. Then off to the grill. 15 minutes on each side & done! My husband was crazy for it & said it was the best grilled chicken thighs he's ever had. This is a keeper (& so is my hubby) :) By the way, I use a grill mat for all my grilling & it's super easy clean up.

I thought this turned out well. Grilling gave a nice crispy result. Preparation was very quick and easy. As personal taste, I’ll reduce brown sugar by 1/2 next time. Thanks for Recipe.

This was a winner!  I didn’t add the water, or the  oregano and skipped the paprika.  Poured everything in a ziplock bag and added the thighs. Marinated in the fridge 2 days,  my hubby cooked about 20 min per side, on low on bbq. He turned the heat off when they were done and closed the lid while I finished preparing the rest of the dinner. Wouldn’t change a thing

I made this as-is and used it with some bone-in chicken thighs and some boneless/skinless breast’s.  This did a good job as a marinade.  Would make again.

Really great depth to this chicken - part Asian, part USA barbeque, part Hawaiian. I paired 5 pounds of chicken thighs with brown rice, and a veggie combo of pineapple, carrots, celery, and yellow red pepper that I sauteed in olive oil.  I agree that 5 pounds is good for 4 servings. This recipe is going on regular rotation!

This recipe was a big hit it was very flavorful and juicy. I marinated it for 5 hours and made one change, instead of using 1 cup of  brown sugar  I substituted 2/3 cup of maple syrup for the low glycemic index and it was delicious. This is now one of my favorite ways to cook chicken. I will be cooking this for many years to come!

Loved this recipe and will definitely make it again soon. Added about 3 more cloves of garlic (but couldn’t taste the difference), omitted the pepper flakes (the cayenne pepper added enough heat), and cooked in the oven (@350 for about a hour) with a little of the marinade. Served with white rice. Definitely want to try on the grill when the weather permits.

Excellent recipe! So much flavor and so easy! I did omit the red pepper flakes and it had a good balance of salty, sweet, and spice. I baked boneless skinless chicken breasts at 350 for 15 minutes covered in foil, and uncovered for another ten. Changes for next time: reduce the Black Pepper a bit, cut the water in half and mix in some cornstarch so it’s a bit thicker and adheres to the chicken better.

I made this chicken last night and I really liked it. I made it with chicken breast and baked it in the oven. I also made a simple sauce out of the leftover marinade. I’ll definitely try this one again!

This chicken is the BEST! I want to find the person who posted this and hug them for bringing it into my life. This is 100% going to be a regular dish for me and my family. I did a little of my own twist. I was already mincing ginger for another dish we were having with dinner, so I used minced ginger instead of grated. I also put about 2 or 3 tablespoons of oyster sauce in the bottom of my measuring cup before filling it the rest of the way with soy sauce.

In all fairness, the recipe called for thighs but my family only eats white meat so I used breasts. Maybe thighs would have earned more stars. I did everything else as specified. It was okay. I think I would have liked it better on the bone with the skin.

Chicken had really good flavor! My husband and I like spicey, but the sweetness of the brown sugar gives it a nice contrast. Marinating it for at least an hour is a must. Really easy to make.

So instead of thighs, I used boneless chicken breasts. And sautéed it in bite size pieces. Some steamed broccoli and brown rice; tasty takeout Chinese has nothing on this dish.

Made as is, was a little spicy but overall excellent.
BBQ unavailable in my Québec winter cold I cooked in a pot, in all the sauce in the oven for 45 minutes at 400
It would be (and will be) amazing on the BBQ.
Will be using this sauce for salmon...

After marinating, I baked the chicken in a 425-degree oven for approximately 20-25 minutes. It was tender and moist but expected it to be more flavorful.

This will be back on the table.  Although I baked it instead of grilling it.  It turned out very tasty with the jus.  Probably because I didn't discard the marinade and also marinated it for two nights.
During the baking I turned and basted the chicken with the marinade and added some butter on top of the thighs.

Made it exactly as is for my family... I didn't care for it and when I finally prompted I got shrugs all around.  I've had similar but were far more superior to this.  Will not make again.

This was very good, and even better on the second day. We omitted the onions and the cayenne pepper, but otherwise made it as indicated, marinating for two hours. Next time, we will definitely use low-sodium soy sauce.  I also think we will try reserving some of the marinade at the beginning and simmering it down to make a serving sauce.

This is an easy and delicious recipe! I recommend puréeing the marinade ingredients in a blender to increase the flavor.  Also, you might consider trying drizzling with honey just before removing from the grill, then letting it "rest" for 5-8 minutes before eating.  Don't skip the "optional" ingredients as they really pack a lot of flavor. It also goes really well with coconut rice!

I made this from a different recipe source and it was a HUGE hit!   We like heat and this had a good punch of heat (maybe I added extra red pepper flakes...)  I will definitely make this again!

I used thin chicken breasts and marinated for 2 hours adding additional spices.  I went by what was recommended in the reviews and substituted 3/4 cup chicken broth and a 1/4 cup pineapple juice. I also left out the oregano since I decided to go full on pineapple.  I baked in the oven with fresh chopped pineapple. For a side veggie I sautéed a red, orange, and yellow bell pepper, along with pineapple and onion and served over steamed brown rice.  I also boiled down the marinade for a sweet sauce to baste/add for extra flavor. Prep and cook time was a bit long, but was well worth the trouble. Hubby actually took left overs to work. Yay!!!

This was really good.  My husband who does not like any kind of BBQ or sauce on his chicken loved it. I added two tablespoon of pepper to the marinate to make it extra spicy.

I don't care what it's called, it was good! I made it exactly as written but will modify it a bit the next time. I also did not care for the oregano flavor and agree with another reviewer that cilantro would be complimentary. I only had time to marinate for an hour but will plan ahead next time and marinate overnight since it was not as flavorful as I was hoping. I may add pineapple or create a kabob with pineapple and onion...maybe red bell pepper too? I served it with brown rice. Husband loved it.  UPDATE: I took another reviewers advice and threw my frozen thighs and all ingredients into the crockpot (sans oregano) and cooked it for 6 hours. It was excellent! The meat fell apart. I drizzled the sauce over white rice and sprinkled fresh cilantro over it.

Awesome recipe.  Very tasty.  Turned out a bit spicy as written, so if you are looking for a milder taste, recommend reducing amount of cayenne pepper.

Really great flavor. This recipe is going into our regular rotation. I used skinless boneless thighs, put in all the optional spices but only about half of what was called for, and baked for 35 minutes at 350. Next time I'll bake for about 30 minutes. My 6-year-old could definitely taste the heat but she liked it a lot.

I used all the ingredients (substituted chipotle chili powder for crushed red pepper) and also added 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch and half a can of tomato paste to make it more like a BBQ sauce and not just a marinade. My boyfriend LOVE IT and so did I. Will definitely be making this again in the future.

I made this recipe, except; I did it in a slow cooker for 4 hours.  Added a little water and cornstarch at 15 minutes before serving to thicken up the sauce.  It turned out amazing, served it over rice.

This marinade was quick and easy to make. I threw this together before I left for work and let the chicken marinate all day. Instead of grilling the chicken at the end of the day, I just cooked it in a pan on the stove top. It turned out to have a nice flavor but I think it wouldnt have been strong enough if I had only marinated it as briefly as the recipe suggests.

This meal came out really good! However, I baked it instead of putting it on the grill. I set my oven to 375 and baked it for about 40-45min. I turned it every 10-15min, also I poured some of the juice on top of it as I turned it. Very good dish, paired with homemade mashed potatoes and veggies. Two thumbs up!

This is one of my favorites that I've made yet! I made the marinade exactly as instructed but used it on chicken breasts and baked them instead. I heavily coated the top of the breasts with the marinade and onions, cooked them half way, turned them over and coated the other side and baked the rest of the way. Served it with fried rice. Everyone loved it!

One of the best chicken dishes I have ever made.  Some sweetness with a hint of oregano.  Highly recommended

Great recipe but way too much pepper. I will cut out the pepper completely next time. I marinated in for 4 hours and then slow cooked it for 4 hours on low...just fell apart...turned out perfect...except that our tongues were burning.

My 3 kids & husband loved it! I could not marinate for the full hour (30 min) as I did not had that much time, and it still came really flavorful! I made white rice and t balanced the bold flavor from the chicken just perfect! Will do this again.

This gets a solid 5 stars from my family.  A little sweet, a bit spicy and totally delicious.  Followed the recipe as written except I used boneless chicken breasts.  Can't wait to make this again!  Thanks for posting this fabulous recipe.

I made this for a friend's  Luau themed birthday party. It disappeared from the pan! Even the  kids liked it (left out the cayenne for kids' taste).  Had brown and white rice.  Definitely making again.

I have made this a few times now. It has been a hit every time. I also tried this marinade on a tri tip sliced thin on the grill. I would say although it is very tasty on the beef, it is way better on the chicken.

Super easy and yummy!  The first time we didn't marinate it long enough (a couple hours).  The last two times we marinated for at least 24 hours.  Big difference!  I made this as the recipe directed and then realized I had only 1 lb of thighs rather than the 5 lbs the recipe called for.  So I put some in freezer bags, froze them and used them later.  Worked great!

my family loved this!  I didn't BBQ it, I marinated it in a pot for 3 hours and then just stuck it on the stove for an hour - never heard of BBQ-ed shoyu chicken... 

Next time, I'm going to decrease the soy sauce and sugar by 1/4 cup..  and don't use fresh ground pepper - too peppery!  

going into my rotation...

Very very good and perfect for a weeknight meal.  The only changes:  boneless chicken breast instead of thighs, fresh minced ginger and garlic instead of powdered, and the addition of citrus juice to the marinade: I've used lime, lemon, blood orange, grapefruit.  I liked grapefruit the most, which surprised me.

Prepared by the recipe except for the boneless, skinless thighs. Bummer. Should have paid better attention at the grocery. Very flavorful, but I think the bone adds a distinct flavor. Otherwise, it browned nicely on the grill and tasted great. Will do again for sure.

Excellent dish. The longer you marinate it, the better. I have made a healthier version with chicken breast tenderloins that is almost as good as the thighs.

I marinated half the amount of chicken this recipe calls for, thus slashing all the ingredients amount in half.  I also had to use Golden Mountain seasoning sauce since I forgot to get soy sauce.  Even though it's sunny 75°, I didn't want to go outside to barbecue and saw in another review that they baked theirs.  I threw in the chicken thighs and marinade in a ziploc bag to sit overnight and made it today.  I dumped the ziploc bag's contents into a glass dish and baked it for 50 minutes at 400.  It came out great and I scooped up all the onions and goodies from the dish and mixed it into my rice.  Yum.  My partner already requested this but with chicken breast.  I'm sure that it would taste better with soy sauce and I might try it on the grill next time.

I changed the recipe by using 2/3 cup water and 1/2 cup or so of soy sauce so it came out a little spicy.  Next time I may try cutting back on the peppers.  I marinated it overnight.  Oops, I also added 3 spears of pineapple for some added flavor.  I crushed the pineapple in the garlic press.

This is definitely a keeper! I marinated my chicken all day. So flavorful and juicy. Next time for my grill, we need to check the chicken at 10 min and then turn it over.

This chicken is fabulous!   So easy to prepare and grill.  Made it with rice and baked beans.   I did not use cayenne pepper or paprika.  Big hit with the whole family.   Will make again very soon. Thank you so much!

This was SO good!! My family doesn't do spicy at all, so I left out the red pepper flakes and cayenne. And I forgot the fresh ginger so used about a 1/2 tsp. ground ginger.  I will definitely make this again, but before I put the chicken in the marinade, I am going to reserve so of the sauce to thicken and put over the chicken and rice I served it with. This tastes so much like the chicken dish I get at a restaurant that I don't have to go there now!!

Made this and my husband wants to know ... Where it's been all his life? It Is very good. I used my food processor to chop the onions, garlic, and ginger into paste. Set aside some of it for brushing the chicken while grilling and the rest to marinade the chicken.

This was really good !  I baked mine, so I think grilling it would have been better but  my grill went out so the next time I make this I will definitely grill it.  It was good baked though  too so thumbs up for the recipe itself!

5.26.16   Have never had shoyu chicken before, so I can’t really say if this measures up.  I marinated the chicken for about four hours and was expecting a more intense flavor.  I thought the flavor was a bit on the weak side, but that just could be how it' supposed to taste.  I  had pretty good size chicken thighs, and if grilled 15 minutes per side as listed in the instructions, they would have W-A-Y overcooked.  This was good, but I didn’t find it quite as satisfying as some other similar  Asian chicken recipes I make.  Served with grilled fresh pineapple slices with a chili sauce glaze and a Trader Joe’s basmati rice medley. Will be having the leftovers today in a chicken wrap.

Huge hit!  All three kids, ages 3-10, cleaned their plates.  I used skin on thighs because that's what I had and marinated all day in the fridge.  I put a little oriental twist to the marinade by not using oregano, substituting 1-2 T chili garlic for the assorted peppers, 1 t sesame oil, and 1/4 c rice wine vinegar.  I held back 1cup of the marinade and simmered it for a few minutes just before I served to top the chicken which I served on rice.  I cooked this on the grill on an indirect heat.  The soy and brown sugar in the marinade gave the chicken a great color and a little caramelization on the skin.  This will definitely go into our quick and easy dinner rotation.

Measured everything exactly as written except for the onions because I didn't have any.   I did, however, change the cooking method.  Per reviewer Lisa Thelen's suggestion, I added everything to a large pot, brought to a boil and let simmer for an hour or so.   The chicken was tender and delicious!  I was concerned that it might be over flavored because it ended up being fairly dark but it was perfect!  Everyone loved it!  Will try it in a crockpot next time for even more convenience.

Yum! I marinated my chicken for roughly 12 hours and it certainly picked up all the yummy flavours of the marinade. The only thing stopping me from rating it 5* was I found it a tad spicy with the cayenne, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spices. Will definitely make this again, minus the cayenne.

Didn't have a full hour to marinate, so I basted a couple times with the marinade.  We have a 2 and 3 year old, so didn't add any hot stuff.  Was awesome.

Used only a pound of chicken thighs. Marinaded for 3 hrs. Halves the recipe, Used chicken broth instead of water, and only 1/4 c sugar. Powdered ginger, 4 cloves garlic , and no onion. Delish! Will def make again.

I thought it was great. The sauce is a little thin but the flavor is awesome. I've made this a few times and will make again.

This recipe was delicious!  My sisters and I were preparing a Hawaiian dinner, and this worked very well!  Slightly sweet but also a little salty, this was a wonderful recipe!

I marinated it overnight and cooked it on my George Forman grill. They came out beautifully and very tasty! I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe use a half an onion. It was a hit with the hubby and 9 year-old too.

By far my favorite chicken recipe.  I prefer breasts instead and I marinade for several hours.  I love ginger, so I always add more than what's called for and I would definitely sub the broth for water. Once I flip the breasts on the grill, I add more of the Shoyu marinade.  The brown sugar and onions carmalize on the open flame, it's delicious! I often serve with coconut rice (cut water in half and sub coconut milk as other half)... perfection!

Amazing! Loved it! I made few changes though: cut sugar to only 1/2 cups and baked chicken in the oven for about 40 minutes, then broiled slightly. It turned out great!

My family really liked it. I cooked it on the stove top and I would not do that again. Next time I will cook it on the grill and use low sodium soy sauce. It was pretty salty.

This was very good and very easy, with ingredients I have in my kitchen all the time. I made it with drumsticks since that's what I had, and didn't really measure any of the spices, just eyeballed them. Marinated overnight. Also added pineapple tidbits and some pineapple juice. Was so good! Used extra sauce over rice. Will make this again!

This is my go-to dinner when I need something fast, easy, and tasty! I have all the ingredients on hand, and I can use this recipe with frozen chicken for those days I forget to set meat out to defrost! You can use this recipe as a marinade for bbq chicken, but I usually make it on the stove top.  Place ingredients & chicken into a pot and bring to a boil, then simmer for 45min- 1 hour (or longer). Living in Hawaii, this is how I am used to it being served. I actually double the amount of sauce so we have enough to serve over rice.

This is a keeper!  I accidentally put in a tablespoon of red peppers instead of a teaspoon -- a happy accident it turned out to be.  Also, instead of marinating and grilling, I put everything in the slow cooker and cooked for 6 hours on low.  At the end I put the chicken pieces under the broiler for 5 minutes.  Thickened up the sauce with a little cornstarch and served over rice.  Delicious!

When it comes down to it grilling this is a hassle, I think this would be better cooked in an oven over a long period of time. For all the sugary sauce you have to clean off the grill, this isn't worth the time.

Marinated for about 2.5 hours and had great flavor.  Despite all the peppers added, really not spicy. Only change we made was to sub honey for part of the brown sugar and leave the skin on the chicken thighs. We basted once with the remaining marinade after flipping the chicken.

I made this for our dinner group. I used some thighs and some breasts, only because the store didn't have enough thighs that day.  Everyone said it was great. I thought the thighs were best,  maybe they soak up the marinade better. Took advice to use pineapple juice instead of the water. Definitely use some of the marinade to baste while grilling, and hold back some marinade mixture for a sauce! I boiled down marinade for 10 minutes and then added 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with a little water, cooking until thickened. Spooned that over the chicken, then garnished with pineapple slices and chopped green onion. Great as leftovers, too.  8/2015 update- tried this with boneless pork chops, was excellent!

I made 65 pounds of this for a luau I had.  It was absolutely perfect.  Everyone at the party loved it.  I marinated the chicken for two days.  I started the thighs on Thursday frozen and cooked them on Saturday afternoon.  You must have skinless thighs or the flavor is not there.  Did not change a thing and everyone thought they were sweet and spicy!!

I was expecting the brown sugar to balance out the soy sauce but it was still a bit salty for my taste.  It was still eatable though because I mixed it with rice. The crushed  & cayenne pepper gave it a nice kick. I did use a little less cayenne pepper. For those who have a bit of a salt sensitivity,  you should consider modifying this recipe. I think that it would have been much better if it wasn't as salty.

My wife and daughter loved it. This one is going in the keeper file. I reserved a bit of the marinade and put it over a low flame to reduce it while the chicken cooked.  I add just a pinch of corn starch to thicken it so it would stick to the chicken. Just before the chicken was done I applied it as a glaze.  In the marinade because I was short on time I used about 2 table spoons of onion powder rather than dicing up an onion.  For the glaze I did dice up a about a 1/4 of an onion.

Fantastic all-around recipe, although personally grilling it came out relatively plain. The sauce, despite marinating for around 6 hours and 30 minutes, did not flavor the chicken thoroughly. Even if this was due to bad marination tactics, no way would grilling it be able to make the chicken as shown in the picture. The sauce is too watery, and won't stick to the chicken as the picture suggests. My second batch I made in the oven at around 350 degrees, and cooked it until it seemed done (Around 40 minutes for me). I simply put the chicken and marinade in a casserole dish and cooked it, soaking. This turned out much more flavorful and saucy, albeit softer.

I've been looking for a great flavorful, tender "bento style" recipe and found this.  I make it without changing anything and it's been a huge hit with friends and family.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars due to the sheer versatility of the marinade .... I doubled the ingredients for the marinade and used half on the salmon filets that I baked for 25 min at 375  . The salmon turned out amazing !!! Not too sweet, not too spicy just perfect ! The only change I made was adding extra ginger  ... I just love ginger . I then used the other half for chicken legs, as I had no thighs on hand and froze them with the marinade on them and I will b using them for another nights dinner . I will b using this recipe again and again ! Thx

Not Shoyu chicken. In Hawaii, you would not marinade and BBQ Shoyu chicken. Totally misleading. This recipe is more like Teri chicken or BBQ chicken

Just made this tonight for my boyfriend and I, and we loved it!  It was the easiest part of dinner: make the marinade, throw the chicken in, let it sit, then cook.  I used a Foreman grill, it took about 20 minutes with the lid down.  The marinade can easily be tailored to different tastes, and the chicken was so juicy...we're looking forward to having the leftovers tomorrow!

Admittedly, I have no idea what Shoyu Chicken is supposed to taste like, but I do know that this marinade tastes delicious! I've made no changes to the recipe and have made it twice now. Both times it was out of this world good!I served the chicken with veggie kabobs and brushed the marinade over them while they were on the grill.

I loved it but as a matter of prinsipal cut half the sugar out. Not needed. Like others, I skinned the thighs and marinated for an hour. Put all of it in a dutch oven, brought to a boil and RTS (reduce to simmer- Anne Burrell). Let it simmer for 30 min and took out of sauce and put on foil sheet under broiler for 7 minutes. While that cooked I thickened sauce with corn starch and put in some steam stir fry veggies. Other than sugar, recipe is good. Thank you!!

Good marinade.  I just put in a dash of all of the optional spices since I was worried it might be too much, and the chicken still had a nice zip to it.  Not my absolute favorite of all time, but still good.

A friend and I made this and absolutely loved it. Made a few changes - almost halved the marinade ingredients and added chilli flakes. We boiled the chicken in the marinade til it had reduced down. 

We served it with egg noodles and stir fried broccoli, green beans, mini sweet corn and bean sprouts. 

Definitely will be making it again.

I wanted to love this recipe but it was a salt bomb. I feel like I must have done something wrong because of all the great reviews. But I followed the recipe exactly and even bought fresh ginger root for it. The result was so salty we couldn't finish it. Huge waste of time and money. Sorry :(

I know I have made this in the past and loved it.  This time I fixed the marinade exactly as written and whoa was it hot and spicy!  Definitely opened everyone's sinuses!  Of course, my spicy hubby loved it, but I did notice he drank more tea with dinner!  Served with just plain white rice which did help with the super spicy chicken.  Next time I'll try cutting the cayenne in half versus the full tsp.!

This chicken was excellent. My husband had not made it home by dinnertime and my 7 year old decided that Dad had forfeited dinner by being late. Therefore he reasoned he could eat Dad's serving of chicken and rice. I almost agreed and split it with him but calmer heads prevailed (Dad walked in during the discussion). I will try to see what I can do to reduce the amount of brown sugar...but this was very tasty. I grated the first part of the fresh ginger. The second part of the ginger, I sliced. The sliced ginger pieces turned out nicely and were a treat to eat in the sauce. Next time, I will finely slice all the ginger (similar to garlic slices).

Made it as directed, marinated for about 4 hours but couldn't grill outside so it went in the oven at 350 degrees for 35-40 mins.  The sauce has a really nice flavor.  I'll make it again but on the grill next time!

This was lip smacking delicious! I followed the recipe as written (just left out red pepper flakes) and rather than cooking on grill, cooked slowly in a covered cast iron dutch oven until tender.

Delicious! The only changes I made was omitting the cayenne pepper (kids don't like anything too spicy) and baked the chicken instead of grilled. Took the leftover marinade and reduced it down to a nice glaze. Brushed it on the chicken the last 10 minutes of cooking and drizzled it on the plate. This one is a keeper!

This recipe is amazingly good - AS IS,  this is now my GO TO chicken marinade.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and boiled the sauce down (without a lid) to reapply to the chicken 5 minutes prior to it being done; I also brushed some on my piece of chicken after cooked, although it was  tasty without it. I'm saving the remaining cooked sauce to use over tomorrow night's sautéed vegies.   FYI:  THE SPICES DO NOT MAKE IS OVERLY SPICY, AS MY HUBBY WHO DOESNT LIKE HOT AND SPICY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST RIGHT.

Also,, those who make changes to a recipe first try, then rate the results down, should not even review the original recipe.

This recipe is amazing, thank you for sharing! Although I read the recipe wrong at the end and instead of teaspoons of the chilli stuff I added tablespoons! Was hot hot hot! We don't have a bbq in Scotland as the weather isn't that great at the minute, so instead of bbq it we just baked it for 45 mins at 200 degrees and it came out perfect and juicy. Also uses breasts instead of thighs. I bought to much chicken breast so left it in the marinade for an extra day ans this enhanced the flavour! NOTE; POUR MARINADE over chicken whilst cooking for a better taste and extra juiciness :)

Tried this on the grill today with drumsticks,  it was great!  The only change for me was cutting up a hot pepper and putting it in the marinade,  tasted wonderful.  Next time I think some grilled pineapple would be great on the side.

My family loved this recipe!  I didn't have any soy sauce on hand so I substituted Worcestershire sauce and it turned out excellent.  I also doubled the amount of hot water in order to make it cover all of the chicken (I used 5 lbs. boneless, skinless breasts).

I would have given it 5 stars, but my kids said 4 and since I can't do 4.5...4 it is. It was really good, and will make this again. Made it with rice and some stir fried green and red peppers, large green onions and zucchini with teriyaki sauce. A good recipe for company...pile the rice on a big platter top with the chicken and line the edge of the rice with the vegies.

This recipe was delicious and I will be using it more often. I baked the Chicken at a low heat since I did not have a grill and it was still fabulous. My daughter who is 8 had no problem mowing it down even though it was fairly spicy which says something about the great taste of the chicken.

This is such a great recipe! I tenderized my chicken first, and cook it on my George Foreman grill. The chicken gets almost a crust on it... It's wonderful. I don't keep fresh oregano or ginger root. So I use Italian seasoning and ground ginger. Its a weekly dinner at my house, I'm so glad I found it!

Yum!  I modified the recipe a little and used 1 cup of pineapple juice instead of 1/2 cup of water (6 servings) and cooked it in a dutch oven for about an hour.  I did not marinate the chicken as there was really no need.  I also browned the chicken thighs a little in oil before adding the "sauce" ingredients.

I think the hubby might leave me if I did not add this to our permanent cookbook. I think it needs half or only 1/3 the amount of black pepper (for toddlers, SERIOUSLY take down the black pepper otherwise they will think it's too spicy), 3/4 or less of the brown sugar (and a little less ginger because I'm not a fan) but this was so delicious following the recipe exactly otherwise.  Marinated overnight - the chicken was stained beautifully the next day so clearly the marinade took!  Don't throw away that delicious marinade! Strained the leftover marinade and pulled out the onions; cooked it down with the onions to make a sauce. Served it with steamed broccoli (steamed then caramelized in a few spoonfuls of the marinade), and brown rice with a bit of the sauce. It was a PERFECT meal. If I wasn't already married, I would have been proposed to after this meal (he's still talking about it)...

Made recipe exactly as directed except spicy items with children sharing. I saved some marinade and boiled with corn starch to add extra baste at end of grill time. I will marinade meat longer next time. Thinking a pork tenderloin would be good option. Yum!

I guess I should have read how much chicken before making the marinade. It still worked out great because I only used about 2 lbs of chicken and marinated it in about half of the marinade then saved the other marinade to heat up and brush over the chicken while cooking. I then put some of the hot marinade over rice. Delicious!

This recipe was so delicious. Everyone loved it. I thought the marinade would be a little too salty at first but after laying the chicken on plain jasmine rice, it blended out perfectly! I loved the hint of spiciness. I baked the chicken instead of grilling it and it was still wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

I used Lisa Thelen's advice and cooked it covered on the stove with half the sauce. I made a sauce with the other half ( thickened it with maizena).

My family loves this recipe! Definitely has a kick but so yummy. If you like spicy food but can't handle a lot of spice, I suggest a subtle side dish like white rice or baked potatoe.
I've also made with bone-in thighs and cut off the skin with my kitchen shears.

I only had 4 fairly large chicken thighs (2 lbs) so I cut the marinade in half.  I let them marinade all day. Not sure what the onion added but these were absolutely delicious.  Granddaughter and I cooked them on the gas grill.  They were delicious.  They do have a little "kick" so if you don't like spicy, leave out the red pepper.  I think next time I'll use pineapple juice in place of the water.  I will cook these many more times.  UPDATE:  I have made this recipe over and over. The biggest challenge is planning ahead for the time to marinade.  Last few times I mince the onion instead of chopping and that seems to work better.  I also add a little more fresh ginger. This is one of my favorite chicken recipes.

I love this recipe! I have made a similar version (without a true recipe) for years, but have used it as the sauce for a stir fry, which pairs well with either chicken or beef. People often ask how I make it and are surprised at its simplicity. I do, however, make two slight changes so that family members who must limit their intake of sugar/sodium can enjoy the recipe as well. First, I use low sodium soy sauce and, second, I substitute Cary's Sugar Free Syrup (to desired sweetness) in place of the brown sugar. (Cary's Sugar Free Syrup can be found in the pancake syrup section of the supermarket.) Even with these modifications, the recipe turns out delicious!!

I lived in Hawaii for 10 years and shoyu chicken was a staple dish that we ate every week. This recipe can hold its own against any chicken I ate all those years!  I add sesame seeds and slightly more sugar to mine to make it more 'island like'.

When I go up to visit my family I cook dinner for them. This caught my eye and glad we tried it! It was pouring outside and they did not have cover fur BBQ. We baked in oven and they loved it. Were eating leftovers ( I had doubled the amount called for the number of people showing up) before leaving on their fishing trip. Very, very easy and tasty!

I agree with yumyum, this deserves more than 5 stars.  This is so good.  I use boneless skinless breasts and I like to slice them in half and make them just thinner so they absorb all the flavor, it is soooooooo good.  I have made this multiple times and everyone that I have made it for loves it!

This recipe is awesome.. Japanese shoyu chicken simple , easy but the taste is so good. My friend love it. although I didnt grilled it coz i dont have bbq grilled instead i bake and grill in the oven and i made it perfectly. When i serve as a main dish for dinner to my friend they think i grilled it but i said nope i bake it with his own sauce and i didnt expect the shoyu chicken will more saucy and yummy ever i made. It was my first time to try this recipe, it was easy and i cant imagine that they really love it and they really want to try this to their home.

Great easy marinade. I let my marinate for 24 hours and it made the chicken so tender and deliciously flavorful. I cooked it on a grill pan on my stove because it was pouring outside, but it still came out great. I bet on a grill it would taste even better. I'll be saving this one for the future.

My teenage son and I thought this was very good.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ginger power.  We were also in a rush and didn't have time for it to marinate so I baked it with the marinade.  I will make it again not changing anything as I think all the spices and amounts work well together.

Excellent!  I made it exactly as the recipe suggested except we used chicken breasts.  I pounded them out and cut into 2 inch strips. Perfect blend of sweet, soy and a slight kick from the red pepper and cayenne.

I used boneless, skinless breasts.  Saved some of the marinade to use while grilling. Used low sodium soy sauce.  Served with white rice cooked in chicken stock with butter, salt and pepper.  This was outstanding!!

I did boneless, skinless chicken thighs in the oven at 350 uncovered for 35 minutes. I flip them once... they are amazing... I leave out the cayenne and this dish is so good! I love it with lemon-garlic rainbow chard as a side. Perfect meal - my husband LOVED it!

Husband loved this!!! He couldn't stop raving. I served it with rice, zucchini and sweet potatoes. I halved the cayenne and red pepper flakes to suit the taste of my kids. I also poured sauce off the chicken after baking it 30min and added cornstarch to it on the stove top then basted chicken last 15min with the sauce.. Yummiest!!!

This chicken was PERFECT! If you don't like it too spicy cut the red pepper, cayenne and paprika in half. Interestingly, I found that doing this the chicken itself wasn't very spicy at all, but the boiled marinade was! My 10 - 15 year olds had seconds. Served with steamed rice and a spinach fritatta also from this site. NOTE: I had to bake the chicken (was out of propane for my grill, dangit) and it was soooo tender and yummy. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes, turning once. Probably basted it but can't remember cuz I had a glass of wine cuz I was so mad I couldn't grill it. Maybe 2 glasses. Doesn't matter.

This was amazing! The spices in this recipe is what gives flavor. I did tweak the recipe to what I had on hand, that is the joy of cooking.
Only had 2 tablespoon soy sauce, added (7)ounce jar of Hosin Sauce (1)Tablespoon of Oyster sauce. followed as is.  I highly recommend this.

The chicken was not as exciting as I thought it would be. I think the water dilutes the sauce too much and drowns out the shoyu - on to try other shoyu chicken recipes.

Marinated it for 3 hours but used a whole chicken cut up in pieces. Skin on and I think that helped. Grilled indirect for 35 min and then direct heat 10 more. We ate it so fast forgot to get a picture. Had a few pieces left over so may take a picture. Skin did "blacken" in the direct gas flame.  I think the same marinade without the Oregano would work with pork ribs. Will definitely do it again in some form.

I marinated this overnight and then with a little olive oil browned the chicken then added the rest of the marinade and cooked slowly until tender and done. Luckily for me I omitted the hot pepper flakes and used less cayenne pepper than called for and to us it was so flavorful but still a little too hot. Could be because I marinated it so long. Next time I will add even less cayenne. It is a very good recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is so awesome. I took the advice of the Hawaiian review and put it all in a pan and brought it to a boil and then simmered for an hour. Since I was feeding my grandsons I decreased the black pepper to 1 tsp and the red pepper flakes and cayenne to 1/4 tsp and it was perfect for them and still had a little kick for the adults.

Definitely a keeper! Marinated 4 leg quarters for 16 hours. Boiled down the marinade and used it to baste. Started this on the grill - 15 minutes, then flipped them and cooked 10 more minutes. The wind came up, so I transferred them to a 350 F oven for another 20 minutes, covered with foil.
The only changes I made were to cut the cayenne and red pepper flakes down to 1/4 tsp. each, and I used ginger paste and garlic paste.
I saved the marinade and will try it on boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a few days.
We loved this recipe and we say "thanks" to Big E for sharing!

I have made this recipe at least 6 times in the past few months and it's FANTABULOUS every time!!!  I take all the ingredients and mix them in a bowl and pour the contents over chicken thighs in a pot and simmer for about an hour with the lid on.  Easiest and tastiest recipe I've tried so far on this site!!!!

I use this recipe for the Banh Mi sandwiches (found on this site). They are fantastic - if I had a food truck I would be rich! Living in the PNW we are limited on grilling, so I have always baked them. Kids love the chicken too.

amazing!  Used ginger powder and onion powder instead (short on time), left out the red pepper and cayenne for the kids.  Served over rice!  Definitely keeping this one handy.

Regardless of whether this is Hawaiian Teriyaki or Shoyu, it's still a great recipe and super super easy.   It was way too cold to grill outside, so I pan cooked it in it's marinade about an hour on simmer until the sauce thickened as others had suggested.   I can only imagine it would be even better grilled.   Can get fairly spicy.   Go easy on the optional pepper items if you're concerned about that.

Cut recipe in half since I only had 6 thighs, marinated overnight and grilled to perfection. Very nice taste, very easy to prepare using ingredients already on hand, will make again.

I thought this was just okay. The onion taste was overwhelming until I knocked the onion pieces off, I couldn't taste any garlic, and it was kind of juicy (it wasn't dry). I think this marinade is more suited for burgers, which I am going to try it out. All I can say is I'm happy I only fixed one piece of chicken this way or I would have felt like I really wasted it.

I saved this recipe to my folder back in 2010 but I couldn't quite bring myself to try it because while I love both soy sauce and oregano, they did not sound right together. Well, this past week I let my two sons choose what we would have for supper and the son who was in charge of selecting the main course, chose this recipe. All I can say is WOW!!! This is what I have been missing for TWO YEARS! I made the recipe exactly as written and it is a keeper, for sure! Served it with homemade macaroni and cheese and Caesar salad for a home run!

Made this for dinner tonight with a few minor variations since I live in an apartment in Peru. 

Like many others, I baked it, and made a reduction sauce from the leftover marinade which I spread over the chicken before serving. I used ground ginger instead of fresh grated, and I used plain white sugar instead of brown because brown sugar is difficult to come by down here. Used boneless chicken breasts cut into strips, skipped the oregano, and served over vegetable fried rice. It was delicious. A very nice hint of spice but not overwhelming. I'm sure it would be even better cooked on a grill! Will be adding this one to the recipe book and making it again.

This is so super good, I recommend it to everyone.  I added a few additional ingredients, and have now made it twice. I have added lots of cracked black pepper, cider vinegar and a little bit of mustard and honey into the marinade.  I cook the chicken on a shallow rack to roast all sides.  It is so delicious, you have to try it!!

This chicken was excellent!  Since I don't have a way to grill, I cooked it in a pan (covered) with the marinade, which made the chicken very moist and full of flavor.

DH wanted terriyaki steaks--so I came to AR and found this one.  Followed recipe exactly, except I used low salt soy sauce--marinaded my steaks while at work, then cooked them on the grill....YUM!  Plan on trying this on chicken next!  thank you!

This was okay, but seemed to stop shy of being "wow."  I'm not sure what it needed--the flavor profile was just average.

This is one of my favorite dishes ever! It is the best grilled chicken I have ever had! Keep an eye on the grill, flare ups are common. Great, cheap meal!

Delicious! I am pregnant, and this gave me heartburn (not surprising). However, it was yummy and I will still eat the leftovers. It's the perfect mix between sweet and spicy. I was actually expecting it to be salty because of the soy sauce, but it wasn't at all!! I'd love to try it with fresh ingredients, I'm sure it would be even better. I used powdered ginger, onion, and garlic because we were out of fresh. Still yummy, my husband and one year old both loved it.

This was a very falvorful chicken and perfect for the grill.  I don't like how soy sauce can take over the flavor so I only used 1/3 cup (I halved the recipe to begin with).  I made this with the mushroom stuffed zucchini also from allrecipes for a great summer night meal on the grill!

Excellent, very tasty.I made the recipe exactly except I used less cayenne pepper. I marinated for only a half hour as I came home last, and was hungry.
Vey easy to make. I have all the ingredients on hand.
This is a keeper, will marinate longer next time

Our family LOVES this recipe. I've made it a couple times now. Once with thighs and once with breasts. Works well for both. I didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand, so that was the only "optional" ingredient that I've yet to try with this recipe. Def will make this again and again.

I followed the recipe for a serving of four.  Everyone has their own "spice" preference so I added more pepper flakes and cayenne which didn't turn out spicy enough for me (I like 6-7 on a scale of 10). I also used low sodium soy sauce.  The flavors were so good after marinating in a zip-lock for three hours and they turned out very moist and juicy!

This sounds great. I make a simpler version with soy sauce, brown sugar, honey and 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/2 cup lime juice and some black pepper. It is truly awesome marinated overnight and grilled the next day. I will try this version minus the spicy stuff (kiddos to feed) next time.

I love this recipe!! It was such a hit with my dad and son...the only thing is, I flipped my chicken about every 5 minutes..on low(my grill runs hot) and I saved some of the marinade and just drenched it every time I flipped....My dad was in awe...he has never been able to cook raw chicken on the grill.....really good recipe, I shall use it again!

This was awesome.  My son who only eats chicken legs and chicken fingers likes it!!! I only buy chicken breasts so that is what I used. I also only had about 1 1/2 lbs of chicken so I just used a 1/4 of the soy sauce, water and brown sugar.  It was wonderful and will be a regual in our home.  I have celiac diesease so I used gluten free soy sauce.  A  must try!!!!!

Amazing!  Delicious!  Easy!  I marinated for maybe 3 hours, but I'd try one hour if that's all the time I had--I think it would still be great.  I used thighs and drums, but wings and breast would be great too.  With breasts I'd leave the skin on though.

This was simply fantastic! We just couldn't stop saying how good it was....long after the meal was over! I marinated the chicken about 18 hours(from noon, overnight until dinner then next day). I think it makes all the difference. It definately goes into my favorites file!

Delicious, and very reminiscent of the Hawaiian chicken at my favorite Tiki Teriyaki restaurant. I think the marinade would be a delicious enhancement if the chicken was stir-fried in it or else drained off and then reduced in a saucepan. I did stir-fry it with veggies and then we ate it over sticky rice - just like the restaurant! Delicious...

Thoroughly enjoyed this! The weather didn't cooperate for a BBQ so I tried one reviewer's suggestion to throw it all in a big pot and simmer for an hour. It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!! I will definitely try this again, grilling next time, weather permitting. Other than grilling, I followed the recipe to a T - wouldn't change a thing!
