These were easy and turned out absolutely perfect, the only thing I did was bake them for only 20 minutes will try 18 the next time as my oven is old, the edges were a little browner then I like them, I was doing a "trial run" trying to find rolls to make for fathers day and this is it!!!!!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!!

Delicious rolls! I followed directions except used oil (my flakes were butter flavored).  I rolled them crescent roll style-no leftovers!

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the warm water, buttermilk (that I warmed with the water) and sugar for ten minutes, melted butter, egg and all the dry ingredients. I did need just a touch more flour than the recipe stated to get it to form into a ball and jump on the bread hook. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or more, I had a little bit of an issue with the bread hook actually wanting to knead the bread dough in the mixer bowl. It kept wanting to kick the dough out! I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll?), covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. I did get 12 large rolls, not nine out of this recipe. 400* for 15 minutes was absolutely perfect. HUGE dinner rolls that were a little different texture and flavor-wise from your typical bread rolls. That's not a bad thing, it's just different. Next time I make these, I might use another egg, just to see if that will get it to where it needs to be for me. It's almost there, flavor-wise. It's got the flavor of a croissant. I think it would be perfect with another egg.  NOTE: Watch these in the oven, they do have quick minute or two where they could burn. I almost had that happen but I caught it just in time.

I love these rolls. I have made them three times now and they just keep getting better. Light and fluffy and huge. I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so this is what I used. I used two cups all purpose flour and one cup bread flour. Warm milk instead of buttermilk and Idaho loaded instant potatoes. They were wonderful. Please give this recipe a try you won't be disappointed. Either way as written or little changes this is a terrific recipe. Thank you.

Excellent roll recipe.  they were very easy and so tasty.  the only change I may make the next time is to skip the additional salt as the potato flakes I used had salt already added and the additional salt made them just a bit too salty for my taste.

I made these for New Year's Eve to serve with crockpot soups that my guests brought.  I changed the recipe by using dry milk, not buttermilk, softening the yeast in all of the required water and adding the powdered milk with the flour.  I also used canned dry eggs by the same method:  the powdered eggs go in with a cup of flour, and the necessary liquid is added as water at the beginning.  Then I use my Bosch to knead the large amount of dough.  The rolls were fluffier than most rolls and browned beautifully.  I will make this recipe often. I quadrupled the recipe and sent dozens home with my guests for New Year's Day sandwiches.  The rolls were huge and worked for sandwiches and dinner rolls as well.  This is a new standard recipe.  I think they will roll out well for cinnamon rolls, too.  I complement the chef.  My husband said they were a triumph at our party.

Just wonderful. I don't normally like using wholewheat flour in my rolls, but the buttermilk does something amazing making the rolls soft and excellent. We had these with Texas BBQ pulled pork. Perfect.

Good rolls. I cut the sugar by a tablespoon and didn't use all the flour. A larger pan than an 8x8 is definitely needed. I started with that then tried a 13x9 but ended up using a larger pan again. I only made 9 rolls and they were large but that was ideal as I wanted to use them for barbecued beef sandwiches. Thankyou tullius these were just what I wanted.

Great recipe! I made these today and they came out perfect. Yield was about 15 rolls and cook time came out a bit below 15 minutes in my old world oven. Next time I make these I will add extra sugar since I like my rolls to be a bit sweet and these didn't come out with a sweet flavor.  They still came out ever so soft and uber delicious and I'm eating one with coffee right now. I'll upload pictures in the next day or so. Thanks for this great recipe=) !!

Great rolls. Mixed the dough in my bread machine(as I was busy at the time) .Still turned out great. Went well with the soup I made for dinner.

good basic classic dinner roll.  Used whole fat buttermilk, and butter flavored flakes.  surprisingly, I didn't get the tang of the buttermilk.  Good crumb, and dough came together nicely.  I do however, knead my dough for more than 3 minutes by hand to get the gluten moving. made smaller rolls for dinner and got 24 rolls in a 9x13 pan.  Flours may vary so I did have to add a bit more flour but not alot.

Made these last night for a neighborhood Thanksgiving dinner.  I've already been asked to bring them again next year.  I've never been much of a baker but found these to be easy and rewarding to make.

These were delicious, and made twelve rolls that fit perfectly in a 13x9 dish.  The kids made short work of these and they were gone the next day.  Excellent recipe!

Very good, but a word of warning: If you make more than 9 rolls, which, if you make normal sized rolls out of this, you will get more like 17, bake them for much less time than listed here. Maybe 15 minutes would be enough for smaller rolls. But the taste is wonderful!!

I made this tonight with dinner. This was the first bread recipe I've made with yeast And it came out amazing! The rolls taste best right out of the oven. This is a very simple recipe and I will be using this recipe very often.

Followed the recipe and they turned out GREAT! Love them. I did add a little extra sugar in my second batch. Don't pack down flour when measuring it. Used my kitchen aid mixer with dough hook to knead the dough. The dough will be sticky but just oil your hands when forming the buns. I baked in a deep dish round pizza pan.

These rose well and looked nice.  But for all the ingredients used, I thought they were a bit bland--they did not go over great at the big family dinner.   Plus the recipe would have them way too big.  I used a 9X13 pan and divided into 12 rolls and they were still a bit too big.  I will try again-- maybe I didn't do something quite right since the others say they taste great.

My new favorite dinner roll recipe! Luckily, I always have 2 things on hand....instant potatoes (to thicken my homemade Minestrone soup) and my homemade buttermilk. I used half bread flour and instead of using melted butter just used "I can't believe it's not butter".(I have it in a convenient spray bottle).  Worked great!!!  Also, I used fructose in place of unrefined sugar; plus cut a plastic produce bag down one side to cover bowl, then covered with a dish towel.  I always set my bread bowl on top of my tv satellite box, as it emits just enough warmth to ensure every loaf I bake to rise beautifully!
(I live on the Oregon coast,... can be rainy and chilly a lot!) Also covered rolls with loose foil last 10 minutes as they were getting almost too brown. Beautiful recipe! arnetage68

Wonderful! I used bread flour in place of whole wheat and baked for less time!  The recommended time was way too long.

These were absolutely delicious. I didn’t use the potato flakes because I didn’t have any. When I pulled them out of the oven, I smeared the tops with softened butter. I then melted another stick of butter and poured it over the tops. The butter seeped into the rolls, making a buttery, crusty crust. So yummy. My husband took a bite and said, “Did YOU make these rolls?” I was proud to say “YES!!!”
