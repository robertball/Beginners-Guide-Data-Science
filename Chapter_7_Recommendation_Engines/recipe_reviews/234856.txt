When I find myself taking the easy way out of making dinner by picking up a roast chicken at the market, I try to make up for it by making the leftover chicken taste like something new. This recipe totally works for me. The only thing I add is a big squeeze of lime juice. My husband likes to put sour cream on his, but that's just how he rolls. Oh, and I heat up the tortillas.

These are so easy and need to go into the regular rotation.   A great use for left over chicken.

Great use of leftover chicken, and something I've been doing for years, using taco seasoning. I wanted to see how I liked this spice combination, so made it as written, but found it incomplete. With cumin and maybe some paprika, this will be 5 stars.

Easy to prepare, very simple, and tastes great - perfect for a quick weeknight meal! Plus it's a great way to use up leftover chicken. For the seasoning, I used McCormick's Perfect Pinch Fiesta Citrus salt free seasoning blend along with a pinch of cayenne and a little fresh squeezed lime juice. Perfect served with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, a little sour cream, sliced avocado and sliced black olives!

This is the first time I've had chicken soft tacos.  It had a nice flavor to it.  I might fix this again but probably doctor it up a bit more.

I've made this exactly as written.  Very quick and easy to make, this recipe can be tweaked easily to suit your tastes.  I gave a 4 star because I thought it could use more spice with the chicken, maybe cumin.  Otherwise, this is a keeper for us.  Next time I might add a touch of guacamole and/or sour cream, just for variety; otherwise, it is good as is.

This was quick &easy, but can easily be made w/your own bbq or roasted chicken, breast or whole. Also, I prefer them on corn tortillas,pan fry them in Pam to soften or heat in a ziplock Baggie in the micro for 15-20 sec. Squeeze a little lime juice on them and add cilantro & mini-diced onion for garnish.

It was ok. We added the "usual" taco toppings as well (lettuce, avocados, sour cream, etc).

Very good.  Only thing I changed was to add chili powder and cayenne pepper to oil before adding chicken.  Topped with Pico de Gallo from this site and cheddar cheese.  Probably use corn tortillas next time.

the canine pepper way too much. The recipe itself is very good but it needs very little of that pepper then in the recipe itself. Other than that it was really good.

I liked it a lot.  The pico de gallo really makes it.  I added guacamole and lettuce and sour cream to the tacos.  Delicious.

This is a quick and easy way to do tacos a different way.  I add poblano, jalape√±o or Serrano peppers for added spice and great flavor. I also heat the tortillas before serving.

I cut back a little on the seasonings to suit our tastes and added our usual fixings.  It made a healthy and tasty meal.

i had to dial back to cyanne pepper because 1 whole teaspoon is actually a LOT but it turned out really good!  we cooked out chicken instead of a rotissere, and it worked perfectly

Very tasty. Personally, I'm a wuss when it comes to heat, so I cut the cayenne and chili powder amounts in half, and used cumin instead of chili powder. I agree with other posters that some lime juice over the chicken would be great.

I'm not sure how you can use "Left over" rotisserie chicken because I used a whole one for this recipe! Only 4 stars because it doesn't mention Paprika or Cumin in the recipe and I used it- also saw a lot of other reviewers using it as well. Other wise, quick easy and delicious!

Great concept and recipe. I love the leftover use of the rotisserie chicken. 
I added a cup of water to this to simmer to permeate the meat with the spices. Added
a half teaspoon on cinnamon and paprika as I always try to expand to our taste.
I used soft corn tortillas as recommended by others. Sour cream lettuce tomatoes and onions were a great
compliment as well.
Everyone loved it!  A plus on an easy recipe. Thank you!
