For what this is, I gave it five stars.  It's not something you'll see everywhere, and it's easy (if you use a processor for shredding the cabbage) and surprisingly delicious.  We ate this with fresh grilled brats, pickled eggs, beer, and German potato pancakes (from this site). Since the bacon is crumbled, I used bacon end pieces, which are considerably cheaper than regular bacon.  I also used white wine vinegar because that's what I had.  With the high fat content of everything on the menu, smaller portions came naturally, were enjoyed and satisfying.  For something unusual for your guests, this one is a winner!

Between baking, shopping, working, additional Christmas decorating and spending more time than I should trying to get our cat "Nikky" OUT of our Christmas tree, I haven't spent a whole lot of time on dinner this week. This great recipe was a good starter for our soup. I don't like tarragon, so I used cider vinegar instead. Thanks Barrett and happy holidays to all!

I made this for a freind's parents who are Chinese.  I was worrying that the vinegar flavor would be too strong, but they liked it.  So I am giving it a five for pleasing both the western-inclined and eastern-inclined palate.

This is a great side dish for a fall supper.  I served it with corned beef and boiled potatoes with cracked pepper.  It was a good compliment to the meat and starch.  I think this is a great, easy salad to make!!!

WELL NOW, I HAVE BEEN EATING THIS FOR AT LEAST 50 YEARS OR SO. SAUTEED ONIONS GO WITH THIS RECIPE. VINEGAR WAS NOT A ROUTINE STAPLE BUT IS GOOD IN IT. AND I AGREE WITH THE OPTIONAL ADDITIONS. SO GLAD TO SEE THIS IN PRINT. I HAD TOTALLY FORGOTTEN THE RECIPE......(UMMMMMMMY FOR THE TUMMY). BUT YEARS AGO IT HAD THE UNGLAMEROUS NAME OF JUST PLAIN OLD 'FRIED CABBAGE".  GREEN ONIONS ARE GREAT WITH THIS TOO.

This would be good as a side dish.  Unfortunately, I tried to use it as a main dish, and the vinegar cabbage taste was too strong for that use, and I gave my family tummy aches.

Great recipe. I've been making a similar one for 45 years. I leave out the garlic because I can't have it. Wonderful side dish. Versatile. Try the other versions with the sour cream, for instance.
My family never cared for cabbage, but they enjoyed this.

When I have a head of cabbage in the house I tend to try several different recipes to try from this website.  I love wilted cabbage and bacon but have only had it with a dash of sugar.  That being said this had a stronger vinegar taste than I would've like.  It did balance out the meal with grilled kielbasa.

This is a good comfort food but I wouldn't recommend using all the reserved bacon grease and am not even convinced that's what the author had in mind.  That's an awful lot of fat!  Use common sense and do what you think you should do.  For me, I use the bit of grease left in the pan after removing it and a drizzle of olive oil.  I don't have tarragon vinegar, so use raspberry vinegar, which I like with this better than apple cider vinegar.  I also like to add 3 or so TBS. of brown sugar and water so mine comes out more like a southern collard green recipe.

We all really enjoyed this recipe, but I couldn't give it five stars because I tasted it as is and it wasn't quite right to me.  I added a packet of Splenda to it after making it as per the directions, and the Splenda made a huge difference.  It wasn't sweet at all, but it helped to cut down on the zing from all the vinegar.  If you're eating low carb, I would definitely try this recipe.  The only thing is, I did not save the bacon fat to cook the onion and garlic in.  I used olive oil to make it healthier, and it tasted absolutely fine.

I changed a few things after making it the 1st time exactly as recipie is, I do not use the vinegar (as it is not a flavor we care for that much) I also add more garlic and add fresh sliced rings of onions. I cook the onion and garlic in coconut oil, not the bacon fat. It is a lot of work for me, because I do not own a food processor, but well worth it, as it has become one of my favorite veggie dishes.

I LOVED THIS, BUT I ALSO DIDN'T PUT IN THE VINEGAR, AND IT WAS GREAT!  I COOKED THE BACON AND SET IT ASIDE.  I PUT A TABLESPOON OF OLIVE OIL IN THE PAN, AND THEN PUT IN THE ONIONS AND GARLIC AND ALSO 1/4 TEASPOON EACH OF SALT AND PEPPER,  AND SCRAPPED THE BITS OFF THE BOTTOM AS I SAUTEED THEM.  THEN I ADDED THE CABBAGE AND BACON AND SAUTEED IT ALL FOR ABOUT 20 TO 30 MINUTES ON LOW HEAT, STIRRING EVERY 5 MINUTES.  YUMMMMMM

Delicious country cooking.  My only strong suggestion would be to throw out the bacon grease and use olive or canola oil.  By far the biggest health problem with bacon is in the grease, particularly because the carcinogenic nitrosamines concentrate in the grease.  That's why we don't cook our eggs in saved bacon grease any more--it's particularly unhealthful!

I do not like cabbage, but my husband does, so I tried this.  It needed salt&pepper and slightly more vinegar.  That said, I did use home made tarragon vinegar as I did not have any other store bought.

this was good, but I can honestly say that my grandmother from Ireland made this a lot.  Some times more than my father would have liked.  We used the ends of salted pork to make it and no garlic.  I really enjoyed the changes

I grow my own cabbage and always get a LOT.  Since my husband doesn't like overcooked cabbage, I'm always looking for something new, simple and yummy.  This is perfect!  The kids adore it.

I used apple cider vinegar which sweetened it just a bit and I seasoned it with creole. I also drained the dripping to save on fat calories, still tasted amazing. I have made this recipe with ground beef.

This is a great dish. I have not had it since I left home. Actually have not thought of it in years. My mom use to make it (god bless you & miss u) anyway.... Not sure about the review from the person that said they "didnt want to loose wait that bad" well if you want to rest assure you dont want to be eating this. BUT, if your looking for taste of home and comfort...This is the ticket. Thanks so much for the reposting of it since some of the reviews are rather old.. THIS IS A GREAT DISH!!!!

Maybe it was because I subbed rice vinegar for tarragon, but this had kind of a weird aftertaste.  For convenience, I used 3/4 of a bag of coleslaw mix (and about 1/2 the bacon grease.)  Probably wouldn't make it again.  Edit: I've changed my stars, because like another reviewer, this gave me a stomache later.  Will not make again.

This is a great side dish. I keep cabbage in the refrigerator all the time.  It seems to keep a really long time.  I call mine fried cabbage, whether you put vinegar on it, sour cream, or plain it is good.

Very good!  What I did different was use seasoned vinager and then added some dried terragon and switch to turkey bacon.  YUM.  A nice change for a side veggie dish.  Thanks.

Yummy and quick!  The tarragon vinegar inspired me to throw in a little leftover fennel stalks I saved from another recipe which gave it a little more of an anise flavor.  Also added chopped red and orange peppers instead of green.  I used a little turkey bacon with left very little grease in the pan and it was just right, just added a few sprays of olive oil.  Cooked this in a hot skillet over the coals on the grill while they were still too hot for searing the pork chops and set the pan off to the side while I grilled the meat.  Perfect timing and my house did not smell like bacon.  (The cabbage was the star.)
