Interesting for a small group and a different flavor. Each seafood has an ideal cooking time and should be cooked individually, cooled, mixed with other ingredients, and refrigerated at least overnight turned every six to eight hours. Lots more garlic and lemon juice!

Changed this a bit.  I skipped the olives and used diced red peppers and diced celery instead to appeal to the masses. I also served it without the lettuces.  It was a hit.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I left out the olives and had no scallops but otherwise very tasty and fresh for summer will definitely add this to my repertoir.
