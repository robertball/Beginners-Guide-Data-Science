Turned out great! I can’t do the no measure method though. Maybe cuz I’m an engineer, I need measurements! I used 3 eggs and 2 cups of flour. Did not strain the spinach egg mixture cuz my blender did a good job of liquefying. Came out darn near perfect. Made fettuccine noodles with my Marcato hand crank pasta machine. Topped the spinach ferruccine with a tomato based meat sauce. Yummmmm!

Beautiful pasta.  I did have to add an additional egg as they were medium size.
