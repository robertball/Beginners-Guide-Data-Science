Really a great way to fix brussels sprouts!  Sometimes I use lemon-flavored sea salt and add bacon bits for added flavor.  I have baked this mixture in the oven at 350 until done with same results.  Thanks RUBYJI...love your recipe!

I really liked this recipe, and I don't even care for Brussels Sprouts!  My husband loves Brussels Sprouts, and he really enjoyed these tonight.  The simplicity of this recipe will make me try them again. They were served with 'Mimi's Slumgullion' from AR, homemade applesauce and bread sticks. Thanks, RUBYJI for sharing your recipe.

Why soil a bowl? Just put the oil in your pan, place the brussel sprouts cut side down, and cook! I added butter a little at a time, because the brussel sprouts seemed to be drinking it. I turned them over and added more butter and they were very brown when I stopped cooking them. I didn't use any other seasoning. They were outstanding!

Oh my gosh, I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving after looking at many "fancy" recipes.  I'm so glad I went KISS!  These looked gorgeous and tasted delicious.  I will never, ever make brussel sprouts any other way.

I have made this recipe several times and it always a wonderful addition to our meal. My husband never even knew he liked brussels sprouts and hesitantly tried them, loved them and has asked for them several times since!

Love the simplicity and taste. I added a touch of butter half way through cooking.

So tasty & so easy! Made as-is, except I skipped the bowl & threw everything in the frying pan! Mmm! Will definitely make again!
