Great starter sauce!!  Basically, this recipe gives you a good base and then you add extras depending on your tastes.  I read some of the previous reviews and used less stewed tomatoes and added a can of tomato paste.  I also added red pepper flakes for a nice kick and a pinch more sugar.  NOTE:  You absolutely have to simmer this for 3-4 hours, minimum.  I tried a taste after about an hour and was disappointed.  I waited four hours later and was blown away by how much difference the simmering made.  A definite winner!!

I make a double batch at a time of this sauce. It freezes well and seems to actually taste better when re-heated on the stove. (Not microwave.)

The recipe makes a delicious sauce without many changes. I usually add meatballs when it's nearly done and omit the sausage. Sometimes I increase the ceyenne pepper for more of a bite. I've added fresh mushrooms, black olives, and fresh tomatoes. They all work well. 

Also it REALLY benefits from a long simmer: I simmer it on very low heat for up to three hours and the flavor is drastically improved.

Excellent recipe. But give it time to cook!!

Brian, you done good.  I read all the reviews for this recipe and made it yesterday in a crockpot.  As with any recipe, we modify it to suit our own tastes.  The result: the best I've ever made.  I didn't want the fat from the meat so I made a meatless sauce. Taking others' suggestions, I doubled all the seasonings.  I added 1/2+ cup of red wine, a can of tomato paste and I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 4 cans of tomato sauce vs. the opposite.  It's the best consistency and flavor ever!  Thanks. It's a keeper.

Thanks Marian for submitting this recipe...it really is delicious.  I used hot italian sausage instead of sweet and didn't add the cayenne.  I only used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes...and still had quite a bit of sauce.  I do agree with other reviewers that the longer you let this simmer the better it will taste.  That is usually the case with a lot of pasta sauces.  Thanks again!!

My husband and I love this recipe.  We have followed others suggestions and let it simmer longer in a crockpot and have doubled the spices.  My husband can't get enough of it and refuses to eat any other kind of sauce.

This is great sauce!  I doubled the meat (1 lb. Italian sausage and 1 lb. ground beef, browned in a separate pan and drained) and added a bay leaf.  I simmered it for about 4 hours to cook out some of the water to make it thicker.  I found it a bit salty and will halve the amount next time.

This sauce was wonderful. It was nice and sweet. Next time I will add even more sausage! I let it simmer for 4 hours as others had suggested and I believe that made all the difference. YUMMY!!

Yummy sauce!  I have just one recommendation:  Let sauce sit for 10-15 min. before serving so sauce will thicken.

Since it is just my husband and I, I halved the recipe.  That night, we feasted on the BEST spaghetti I have had in a long time.  The best part is, we still had lots leftover so I froze half and we were able to make 2 more meals out of it!

Sorry, but *my* Brian rates this 3 stars. This is due to the brand of sausage I used - Meijer's  sweet Italian sausage links. This was the first time I've cooked with them, and quite honestly, they were horrible - gristly, tasteless, nasty texture. They spoiled it really. Otherwise, the taste was pretty good. I might try this again but with sausage I know we like. Thanks, anyway.

I love this recipe so much I don't even bother wasting the calories on pasta. I do make it a little thicker by draining the diced tomatoes and making up the difference with an extra can of tomatoe sauce.

This is a terrific sauce.  Very hearty!  I added a can of tomato paste instead of the 2 cans of sauce and extra garlic as well.  I also added chopped black olives.  This makes a TON of sauce, but the leftover freeze well.

I just realized I had never rated this recipe and I have been using it forever it seems!  This is a fantastic sauce recipe and a good building block to add your own ideas!  I always add extra spices, a mixture of hot and sweet italian sausage, plenty of garlic, a touch of sugar and depending on the family mood - mushrooms, onions, etc.  The only change I make to the original recipe is I do not use diced tomatoes, we used crushed (hubby refuses to eat sauce that has chunks of tomatoes in it).  I have found that the longer this simmers the better it tastes!  It's so easy to make - no more bottled sauce for my family!

My wife was skeptical, but when I made it she said it was absolutely fabulous.

As a twist, the second time I made it she added in some small meatballs as well, which gave it a different but still good taste.

Very good sauce, and very easy to make.  I simmered it for about 90 minutes to bring out the flavors and thicken it up a bit.  I liked the fact it wasn't pasty.  The only negative:  I found it too fatty, the sausage grease was a little overwhelming.  Next time, I will boil the sausage first, then break it up into the onion and garlic, that way the grease will be tossed out with the water and won't go into the sauce. The seasonings were just right, and it truly is a very good recipe!

I served this to 24 hungry little Bible Quizers last night and they kept comming back for more.  My pot was empty when I left the church.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Marion.  It was a BIG hit!

This looked too easy to be so good, but it was fantastic.  I let it simmer several hours and it was  a great flavor.  It made a huge batch, so I froze half of it and will try it when making lazagna this week!  YUM!

Woo! This tasted great! I added fresh herbs, bell pepper, and mushrooms...which made it absolutely incredible. It froze well and provided me with plenty of meals throughout the month.

Yummy, Yummy, yummy, We loved this sauce. My 18 yr old daughter made this for us and it was great. She added hamberger meat, hot sausage, worcestershire sauce and wine then cooked it all day at a low simmer. Will definatly make this again.

This was a FANTASTIC pasta sauce.  I added a quarter cup of red wine, and was pleased with the result.  A great recipe for folks who are tired of the way-too-sweet bottled pasta sauces, but don't want to spend all day making one at home.

I came across this recipe a few years ago and I love it. I grew up with my grandmas rich, dark sauce which I loved too but this sauce is more my style. I don't change a thing but I usually cook it for a few hours. It's even better the next day.

Brian's Favorite Sauce Haiku: "Please simmer longer. (Too many tomatoes too.) But we still liked it." I followed the recipe as written (should've read the reviews more thoroughly about reducing the tomatoes, and adding tomato paste, b/c it was just too chunky and not sauce cling-ey) - on the other hand, I did note that many reviewers were unanimous on letting it simmer for much longer than 15 min. It was much tastier after 3 hrs., b/c when I tasted it at 15 min., it wasn't so great and I ended up adding more of the herbs. I'll make it again, but definitely reduce the diced tomatoes, double the herbs, add tom. paste, and of course, let it simmer all afternoon.

Excellent recipe for the crock pot! I made a few small changes.  Omitted the onion, used 42 oz of diced tomatoes, added a 6 oz can of tomato paste and half a cup of red wine.  Cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours.  I live alone and had NO problem eating this for five nights straight.  Nummy!

i love this recipe and have been making it since 2006! - I sometimes add green peppers chopped very small ( so my children won't hesitate to eat it as much) but to get in just a little more flavor and vegetables.  DELICIOUS!!!

I made a vegan version of this sauce.   I used a package of Field Roast Italian Sausage and it worked great.  Everyone loved this "meaty" sauce!  It's easy to make too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband didn't say a word, just grunted a lot, as he inhaled a whole plate in about 30 seconds flat. (This is high praise). 

I added some yellow and orange peppers I had to get rid of, and it was a little sweet, so maybe I'd reduce the sugar a bit and add a few more pinches of cayenne. Yum!

WOW!!  I would give this 6 stars if I could!!  This sauce was absoutely delish!!  I did double the oregano, basil and cayenne pepper as some reviewers suggested.  I also pureed 2 of the cans of tomatoes, only used about 1 tablespoon of the olive because thats all I found was needed and let it simmer for about an hour.  It turned out perfect.  The kids loved it!

Finally, a sauce my family likes!  The recipe is easily modified.  The first time I made it I used a little less sugar than the recipe called for, and also used hot sausage, and that sauce turned out equally tasty!  I personally like to add a can of black olives to it as it makes for more interesting color variation.  

Oh, by the way...sugar is essential for a sweeter sauce, but don't overdo it here, as the sweet taste easily becomes overwhelming when you're eating a lot of this stuff at a time (which I can't help but do).

I made this for dinner and cooked it all day (from about 10 am to 5 pm).  Delicious!  I did follow everyone else and double the spices.  Even my picky(self proclaimed) brother in-law said it was good.  He compared it to Macaroni Grill sauce.

I make this once a month for my husband and he loves it!! As other reviewers have mentioned you must let it simmer for at least 3-4 hours. I also double the spices, add mushrooms and use Italian seasoned tomato sauce and Italian seasoned crushed tomatoes in place of the stewed tomatoes (my husband does not like chunky tomatoes in his sauce) and it comes out perfect!!

Fabulous recipe!  I added 1 green bell pepper (chopped in the food processor so my kids can't identify it), 1 package sliced mushrooms (cooked with the sausage before adding the rest of the ingredients), used tomato puree instead of sauce (that's what I had on hand) and a pinch of baking soda.  After sauting the onion, garlic and sausage, I put everything into the crockpot and let it cook for the day.  Wonderful!  Husband, kids, inlaws, everyone raved about it!

This is a GREAT sauce!  The only thing I add is a bit of tomato paste to thicken it
up.  I also let it simmer a while longer to let the flavors mix.  I found that if you want
to add wine to this sauce for something different, it works great!  This sauce also 
freezes VERY well.  BRAVO - This one is a definate keeper in my house!

I loved this sauce!! I used the recipe to use up our crop of LaRoma tomatoes and canned a bunch of the sauce.  A little thin, I added a can of tomato paste and 1T cornstarch.  I let it simmer all day, put it into hot quart jars, and voila!  No processing needed, all the jars sealed themselves.

I did add sweet peppers and sliced mushrooms and used spicy sausage.  I also browned the sausage, onions and garlic and then put everything in the crock pot and let it cook for several hours.  Only 4 stars because I like my sauce thicker, and this is a little thin.  I need to try and work on it again, because I do like the taste.

The older the sauce gets, the better it tastes; it just still feels like its missing something.  Good, but missing a little 'something.'

I pan fried hamburger and onion, then added that and all other ingredients in crock pot and cooked for about 4 hours - very yummy!

I just made this sauce for a family birthday party...it has been simmering for 3-4 hours and I plan to let it go the rest of the day.  I did use alot more meat than the recipe called for (5 pounds ground round & 3 pounds Italian Sausage for a triple batch).  I also put my diced tomatoes in the food processor....It is amazing!!!  It may not last long enough to use at the birthday party on Sunday!!!  This is deserving of way more than 5 stars.  I will never buy jarred sauce again!  EVER!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious. I did not add the onion, but did add extra cayenne. I simmered for a couple of hours on top of the stove. There are only two of us so I was able to freeze some for a quick dinner later. My boyfriend Brian says this is the best spaghetti sauce ever. I agree.

I didn't have any Italian Sausage but found lean ground beef with some additional seasonings worked well.  This recipe stood out for me because my husband's name is also Brian - and now this is a favorite sauce of his too!

This was very good.  I used turkey sausage to lighten it up.  Instead of tomato sauce I used San Marzano crushed tomatoes (they're the best). I was always skeptical about putting sugar in tomato sauce, but it was good - not too sweet.

I love this recipe!  I now use it as my homemade sauce.. I like a lot of veggies in my sauce, so I add carrots, peppers, and mushrooms in addition to the onion.  It makes a lot, which is great-we eat some for dinner and freeze some.  I also have been using Italian Seasoned Lean Ground Turkey.  Does change the taste a bit, but it's still great!!  My husband loves it too!!

So Good. Made it with hamburger instead of sausage, cooked it for 3 hours and added a little more spice along with some crushed red pepper.

Great sauce! Let it simmer all day for great flavor. It does make a whole lot of sauce. I like my sauce a bit thicker. this is a somewhat watery sauce. So you may want to thicken it.

I was shocked at the taste of this sauce after reviewing all of the 5 star ratings. I'm always looking for a good spaghetti sauce, and I was a little leary of this one, but after reading the great reviews I figured it was worth a try. My instincts were right...I think there is too much tomatoes and not enough spices. I ended up doubling the spices and adding a can of tomato paste, and that helped a little. However, the taste just never seemed right. I used a large crock pot on low all day. It also makes a lot more than the recipe claims...my large crock pot was filled to the top.

My husband liked this a lot, but it wasn't my favorite. All I could taste was Italian sausage and tomatoes. I only let it simmer for about 20 minutes. Maybe that was the problem. My own sauce is much better, although I may try a quarter pound of Italian sausage in addition to ground beef in my sauce next time for a little kick.

Yum! This sauce is easy and just the thing if you're looking for a filling, hearty sauce. I've made it with the sausage and also with ground beef....both are good, although the sausage was my favorite.

This has become the only spaghetti sauce I make. When I was young, my parents often took me to a favorite Italian restaurant. This sauce tastes like that restaurant's. Even my picky father agrees that it is delicious and does indeed taste like the sauce of his favorite Italian restaurant. To me, the longer it simmers, the better the taste. Iwish I had some made right now!

This was my first time making homemade pasta sauce, and it was great! Great recipe to get rid of all the tomatoes in the garden. I did make a few changes though. I roasted the garlic, used hot italian instead of sweet, added a little bit of tomato paste to thicken it up, and added some red wine. I will definately make this again!

My husband really liked this recipe--he declared it a "keeper".  Personally, I don't like Italian Sausage, so I didn't care for it too much.  However, the overall flavor was good.  Quite tangy at first, so I added additional spices, and it turned out great.  Fed it to my husband's friends, and they liked it.

This sauce was alright - It was not meaty enough for my family and it needed a little extra seasoning - I cut down on the amount of diced tomatoes and used extra tomatoe sauce instead - Also took some one elses advise and added a can of paste.  It definetly made alot (froze some).  I would recommend to people - you just may need to adjust it to your own pallet a little bit.

We loved this sauce. I simmered it for hours and it smelled and tasted great. I made it for company and everyone raved about it.

I liked the recipe but it lacked enough gumption as far as spices are concerned. Over all very good, but you have to work around own spice desire

This was worth every bit of time with was not all that much time.  I used this sauce with the Meat Filled Manicotti recipe instead of jared sauce. What a hit!!!!!!

This was my first attempt at homemade spaghetti sauce and it turned out flawlessly!  My husband 3 year old, and dinner guests love it!
