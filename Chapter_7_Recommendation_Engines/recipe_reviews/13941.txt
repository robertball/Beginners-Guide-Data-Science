This is a very good recipe which I will definitely use again.  After reading other reviews, I made a couple adjustments.  I salted the grated zucchini first and let it sit in a colander to draw out the excess moisture.  Then I patted it dry with paper towels.  I also added some fresh chopped garlic and Italian-style bread crumbs to the mixture.  Then, after forming the patties, I patted on more bread crumbs.  They fried up nice and crispy.  I served them with marinara sauce, which my husband and I both thought was the perfect accompaniment.

These are delicious! I substituted instant mashed potato flakes for the flour, which I think makes for better taste and consistency!

WOW! These are soooo good! Very easy to make. I tweaked the recipe a bit though since it seemed a little bland as is. I added some black pepper, parsley and garlic. I also threw in some chopped mushrooms since they go so well with zucchini. I think next time I'll try different cheeses and other complementary veggies like red bell pepper. These would probably go really well with some marinara sauce too.

These zucchini patties are AWESOME!! My husband and I both loved them--I can't wait to make them for others. I did tweak the recipe a bit and followed the suggestions of others. The liquid from the zucchini absolutely needs to be squeezed out to make this work--otherwise it will be much too runny. Here is what I did: used 3 eggs instead of 2 (i had a bit more onion and zucchini than what was called for), added 3 cloves of pressed garlic, a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, 3/4 to a full cup of italian seasoned bread crumbs, and 1/2 c. of cheddar (on top of the other cheeses). Also, I lessened the amount of flour to maybe 1/4 c. Lastly, I sprinkled the patties with bread crumbs before frying. Will definitely make this again--can't wait in fact!

These are great with the recipe as is, but they turn out a little better if you drain the excess water off of the Zuc first. I've also used just a Tablespoon of flour and a 1/3 cup of seasoned bread crumbs to replace the 1/2 cup flour, to add more flavor and they were fabulous.

I make these patties all the time. For a more healthy way I bake them in a jelly roll pan at 375 for 20 min then turn them and bake for an additional 15. Time depends on your oven, the size of the patties and thickness. I spray the bottom of the pan with PAM. I squeeze as much water out of the zucchini as possible and I don't use salt. The salt makes the zucchini more runny. There is enough salt in the cheeses and you can always salt them after they are baked. I also use 1/2 cup of pepper jack cheese and 1/2 cup of feta instead of the mozzarella cheese. These cheeses give the patties a better taste. I don't use any oil or flour in my patties. I use Italian bread crumbs I also double the recipe but don't double the eggs.

Hey, this is Sherlie!  Thank you so much for all your kind reviews and thanks for trying my recipe. I am so thrilled that it is so popular and that Allrecipes has put it in several of their cookbooks.  It is a versatile recipe and can be varied with any indgredients except of course the zucchini.  One of the best tips for making it is to drain the zucchini as it makes the batter runny if you dont and doing that in a couple of paper towels works wonderfully.  Just wring it out.  Thanks again, readers.  You are a great bunch!!!

Wow, what a great recipe for zucchini.  We just ate these up.  They even look just like potato patties.  I made these even lighter by adding reduced fat shredded mozzarella cheese and frying them in a spray marjorine.  I also added some garlic for extra flavor.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will surely use over and over again.

This recipe was simple and great tasting!  What I also did was make the full recipe, made enough for my fiance and myself.  Then I put the remining mixture back in the fridge to use again a few days later.  It was fine, just drain the accumulated liquid from the settling.

These were very delicious, my husband was surprised at how much he liked them!  I did as someone else suggested and drained off all the extra juice I could from the zucchini and then placed it in some paper towels and squeezed out all the juice that was left.  It helped make these patties nice and crispy with a yummy cheesy inside!

This recipe was great.  I ommited the mozzarella cheese because I didn't have any on hand but they were still great.  My husband loved them and told me I might have to make these every night!  My sister and her 1 1/2 year old son loved them too.  I will definitely make these again.

Wow, a versatile recipe for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike. I love them crispy and hot right out of the pan, and my husband prefers the flabby, soft, reheated leftovers. Here's a few tips:

1. Make sure you squeeze the excess liquid out of the grated zucchini. Salting it helps, then let it sit in a strainer for a while, then squeeze out the rest with paper towels.

2. I think they taste much better when you don't use plain flour. Bisquick, mashed potato flakes, and even whole wheat flour give a much better flavor.

3. Try adding a bit of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes... yum!

4. These are great for using up that last bit of whatever vegetable you have on hand. I've added some grated carrot, yellow squash, or chopped red pepper. There's a million ways to change it up; try one of your own, then share the results with the rest of us!

I used this recipe more as a baseline of how to make knock off's of Ruby Tuesday's zucchini mini's.  I added roasted red peppers and feta.  I also grilled mine on a George Forman Grill, so I didn't have to fry them.  I was very pleased with the outcome.  So if you want to cut some of the fat and calories, grilling these is an option.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I thought these were good, although my children didn't care for the amount of red pepper.  I'll try again and tweak the spices.

This is such a good recipe!  I agree with another reviewer that it's hard to fry them fast enough!  I make them every chance I get and they are a staple at my house! COOKS NOTE...Be sure to use a grater with BIG holes.. grating too fine will result in mush!

4 stars as written, but it's a definite 5 star with a few changes. It's really important to squeeze as much excess liquid out of the shredded zucchini before mixing it with the rest of the ingredients - otherwise, these would be too mushy/wet. I used about a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/8 cup of flour. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and a small bunch of fresh basil to the mix. They are soooo freakin' good. Just like crab cakes, but without the expensive crab. We'll be making these a lot.

Fantastic! To puff up the zucchini a bit, I added some baking powder, just like in potato pancakes. I made these for my DH who is low-carbing it instead of making potato pancakes. You couldn't even tell the difference. They are fantastic - serve them with sour cream (my fav) or applesauce (an old German tradition with potato pancakes.) I shallow-fried these first then finished off in a 425 oven for about 10 minutes. Yummy!!!

As I'm sure others either know or have learned, draining the zucchini really does ensure the success of this recipe.  To give it a little kick beyond the fairly quiet taste of the mozzarella, I used Pepper Jack cheese and we both loved the little surprise of "bite." I loved these and even tho' I pretty much forced them on tonight's menu despite knowing Hub is not fond of them,  I was quite pleased when he reported he liked them.  I served these with the suggested little plop of sour cream and  some fresh chives, but I think the tomato sauce idea sounds good and tempting too!

I added fresh garlic and basil and fried in butter.  I don't know exactly what was wrong with it, but it just wasn't that good.  It was ok at best.  The bf liked it tho.

These were REALLY good! I guess I used the recipe as a "base" because I added 5 chopped baby port mushrooms, 1 chopped sweet red pepper, potato flakes, garlic, black pepper and paprika. I didn't drain the zucchini, or add salt until it was in the pan, I also omitted the flour. I switched out the mozz. for sharp white cheddar and added an egg. I let it sit for a minute or two while the pan heated up to allow the potato flakes to absorb some of the zucchini juice. These were so good. I served them with smashed (lightly seasoned) avocado.

taste wise it's probably more like 3 1/2, but it was easier than i thought it would be and I DON'T think the zucchini needed to be strained. i simply blotted my shredded zucchini with some paper towels and DIDN'T use bread crumbs. They fried up just like pancakes. (and i'm not an expert fryer) Bread crumbs might have bumped up the flavor though...

These are delicious. A great recipe that we will use often due to great zucchini success in the garden this year. After shredding, I put the zucchini in a colander and sprinkled a couple of teasp of kosher salt on top. Let this hang out in the sink for approx. 30 min to drain and then used clean kitchen towel and squeezed out the remaining moisture. I diced the onion very small to make sure it was tender in the short cook time and used 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs. Perfect. Grandbaby, young adults, teens, hubby, everyone loved them and insist that we at least double the recipe next time. Thanks for sharing!

These were great! I used corn meal instead of flour and added bread crumbs, cheddar cheese and carrots. Rather than fry them, I sprayed with olive oil and broiled them for about 6 minutes each side. They heat up well!! I also ate them with applesauce spread on top.

These are Wonderful!!! I let them set in a colander to drain and added garlic powder to them. My kids hate zucchini and could not get enough of these. I also used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella.

So delicious. They came out so moist and everyone gobbled them up. I followed other reviewers' advice and used paper towels to squeeze out the water. I didn't have parmesan cheese so I substituted plain bread crumbs. And finally I chopped up 3 cloves of garlic and added about 1/2 cup of other mixed vegetables like red peppers, green peppers, and sundried tomatos (whatever I had on hand) just to spice things up. I absolutely loved this recipe!

These are OFF THE HOOK delicious.  Seriously, I don't ever want to eat anything else again. I squeezed the zucchini out really well, added a few shakes of Italian style bread crumbs, and 2 dollops (maybe 2 tablespoons?) of pesto to the mix.  Some had said they were bland, so really only did it to ensure flavor.  Perhaps they were fine without!  I served them with spinach and squash pasta and vodka sauce.  DELICIOUS!!

Yum!  This may sound gross to some people, but I like to put syrup on these because they remind me of an omelet and I like syrup on my omelet.  Delicious!

Excellent!  I followed suggestions others listed here: sub instant mashed potato flakes for the flour, add garlic and italian seasoning.  Delicious!  Everyone devoured them.  I offered a variety of accompaniments: sour cream and green tobasco sauce, salsa and chunky marinara (from this site).  Each topping got rave reviews. So, these are basically excellent no matter how you choose to serve them!

Very yummy, very easy.  My kids weren't crazy about them but my husband & I thought they were fantastic.  After I mixed everything, the batter seemed really loose so I added a bit of extra flour (few Tbs.)  It still didn't hold but when I dropped big spoonfuls into my hot cast iron skillet, they stayed together.  I just patted flat with the back of spoon & flipped when golden brown.  I only used 2 Tbs. oil for the whole bunch.  Delicious!  And they really do look like the crispy brown cakes in photo.

I made these zucchini patties as a side dish for tonight's dinner and got nothing but rave reviews from everyone at the table. After grating the zucchini I used a clean cotton dishtowel and squeezed the excess moisture out which helps keep the zucchini from becoming mushy in the middle. I did tweak the recipe up a little by finely chopping the onions, added 2 cloves of minced garlic, a little black pepper along with the salt and substituted dried potato flakes instead of flour. I did used olive oil to fry them in and they came out perfect. This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be making these as often as I have zucchini.

I had extra zucchini shredded after I made a loaf so I decided to try this.  I made my with bread crumbs after someone had suggested that.  Everyone liked it very much.  I think I cooked them up a little to small, next time I will try to make them larger in diameter.

only modified slightly: used freshly grated pecorino romano   (vs parm), some fresh parsley, chopped fresh mozzarella (vs bagged shredded) also used 1/2 bread crumbs like some suggested and after I made about 1/2 of the fritters I added a little fresh dill... Highly recommend the dill!!  Very good recipe made as written but also good changed up a bit... I think a slice of fresh tomato on top would have made these even better but I didn't have any...

I have been making these patties for a few months now. I have even made copies and handed them out to almost everyone I know. 
Recently I tweeked the recipe slightly. I normally use two little zucchini's, this time I used one zucchini and one small yellow squash. My family won't let me go back to the original way of cooking it! They love the yellow squash addition. It is less bitter and sweeter than the orginal. 
Thank  you for your wonderful recipe!!!

great! changes:

added a clove of chopped garlic, used instant mashed potatoes instead of flour, drained the excess water from the zucchini and pressed in paper towels, used fresh grated parmesan, dubliner, and pepper jack cheeses (to equal 1 cup), and cooked in olive oil. i ate these with spicy marinara sauce and they were delicious! also can be eaten as veggie patties on toasted buns with some tomato and lettuce for crunch.

Wonderful! You must drain the zucchini! I just put the shredded zucchini in several paper towels or a clean kitchen towel and squeeze the excess moisture out.  My super picky teenager ate several of these! Thanks!!

I really wanted to give these more than three stars. To make them a little healthier, I used whole wheat flour, 4 egg whites and lowfat mozzerella cheese. I also used one whole leek that I'd bought at Trader Joe's the day before. These were a pain in the behind to cook. I didn't use any oil or butter, just cooked them on my griddle. First couple I made they were WAY too wet to cook right so I had to add another 1/4 c. of whole wheat flour. Then, they did cook up firm but weren't what I was hoping for. My husband and I thought these weren't bad but my youngest kid who's normally picky about everything I make INHALED these (and I did fib, I will be honest.....I told them they were Pizza Pancakes!) and asked for seconds. I took a couple other reviewer's suggestion and served it with a marinara sauce (The Best Marinara Sauce Yet, which is also from this site.) I think this has potential and I would love to make them again but I want to play with the recipe. Maybe add some spices next time. Good base recipe and I love that my picky youngest inhaled it. Thanks for sharing.

This is our favorite zucchini recipe because it is very good in addition to being pretty quick and easy. I also feel it is more nutritious than zucchini bread. I have made it many many times over the past few years. A few of my recommendations: Hold the salt because the cheeses are salty and only add salt at the table if necessary. I added the salt in my first batch and it was way too salty for us. I prefer to use small zucchini as they have a better texture and flavor than the large ones. I fry these in coconut oil because it is not hydrogenated like shortening and gives food a crispier outside than oil does.

These are awsome! But I thought It still needed something to add some flavour so I added garlic powder, black pepper, 1/2 C. italian bread crumbs,celery salt and I used marbled cheese instead of mozzarella. The patties fried up nicely.  I used a small dusting of bread crumbs on the patties before frying and it made them crispy. I made them in advance, so to rehaet/warm them up I put them on my BBQ!  My 5 year old LOVED them too!  I will make these again for sure. THANKS for a great recipe.

This recipe is similiar to one I've used for many years, with the exception of the mozzerella.  Can't wait to try it! I also add fresh parsley and mint from my garden. Sometimes dill too!
Unless in a hurry, I shred the zucchini into a colander, sprinkle on a 'little' salt. After about 15 mins. squeeze out the water and you're ready to go!

Making these for the third time in as many weeks.  Everyone loves them.  I did substitute cheddar cheese for the mozzarella - I didn't have any mozzarella and we really like cheddar.  I think this may have added extra flavor.  I also added garlic, because we eat garlic in just about everything.  One night, I added fresh basil, because it was on the counter.  Other times I did not. We liked it both ways.  I used the exact ratios of flour, cheese & zuchini from the recipe.  It was just the right consistancy.  For those who are finding it too wet, if your zucchini is very large, try removing the seeds and pithy middle part before grating.  I have been using very fresh,  medium sized zucchini.

I did not like the taste of the raw onions in the patties and they were way too watery even after I squeezed a lot of the liquid out of the zucchini before mixing the ingredients.

Made these yesterday for my son and I and they tasted great.
My boy hates zucchini but he scoffed these down and asked for more.
Do drain the zucchini well as suggested by others, otherwise it will just be a sloppy mess.

These were pretty good. I thought these were a touch dry and bland. It's a good starter recipe. Next time, red chili pepper flakes and more cheese for moisture.

Since I have a BlendTec it was easy to grate the zucchini, so this turned out to be easy and delicious. Before BT, i avoided these kinds of recipes, like potato pancakes, because the grating was so time consuming. Now I will glad trade potatoes for zucchini. 
Thanks.

This is a great base recipe for using up vegetables. I'm a fairly novice cook, but I popped half a zucchini, a patty pan squash, half an onion, and some garlic in the food processor (not all at once, of course) and then mixed that with some mozzarella (no parmesan on hand). Two eggs and 1/2 cup of flour seemed to be good to get the right consistency - you're looking for something that holds a heaping spoonful well. All I can say against it is that as is, it's bland. It definitely needs some salt, both to draw out moisture from the zucchini and for taste. I added some paprika, cayenne and black pepper to it, though you could take it any number of directions with a different spice combo.

cooked with "shreded zucchini",or other squash
should know to Drain Well !! My only change was a
little fresh garlic. As I am a galric and onion fan!
 Came out Perfect !! Everyone Loved It !!!!!! My
suggestion,( not just mine.) For a drink, a mellow
Daq. Beer just didn't get it,Wine was Too way out
for this dish !  Wine doesn't go well with fried food's !

I made these for dinner tonight and they were just delicious.  Thanks so much for posting.  I read a review where someone used instant potato flakes instead of flour.  I also want to try it that way.  Hard to just eat one or two or three.  I think I had four and I made them large.

Sorry guys....  I'm usually pretty handy in the kitchen but when it came to these, all was NOT well.  The patties fell apart completely and we ended up with a mushy mash of zucchini hash.  It didn't taste very good either.  I may try these one last time because so many people love them but so far, NOT impressed.  Too bad!

I had really high hopes for this; I was so looking forward to it!  I was a little disappointed.  I did not really care for them; I think the texture the egg added turned me off a bit...I'm not sure.  However, Mr. LTH LOVED them, so I decided to average my "3" with his "5" for a solid "4".  I followed the recipe as is and found it awfully watery, too.  It was difficult to form/flip the patties.  I think I might have preferred them w/cheddar, perhaps, instead of the mozzarella.  Thanks for an interesting recipe!

We liked these, but mine were super wet & I had a hard time frying them up. I also added a lot of fresh garlic & pepper. For the onion, I used a mix of celery, onion & carrot (hiding veggies).

We really liked these.  I cooked one to taste and thought it could use some garlic, which gave these a really good flavor.

This was sooo good.Had a few minor adjustments. First I peeled the zucchini,the shredded it,let it drain for about 15 minuetes,then started putting everything together. I substituted garlic and herb bread crumbs instead of flour and kept everything else the same. I formed 10 patties and wasn't ready to cook them up yet, so I let them hang out on some parchment paper in the fridge for a couple hours. When I took them out, I just took some paper towel out to absorb any excess liquid. Instead of oilt to fry, I used butter flavor cookong spray. I also added a little bit more bread crumb to each patty. My husband almost ate all of it and he hates veggies.

These were amazing!  Really really good.  I put in more zucchini than the recipe called for and I used dry TVP in place of the bread crumbs.  They don't change the taste and add lots of protine.  I added chopped red onions too.  The only problem I had was the mixture didn't hold well.  To fix it I mixed in the flour rather than dredging the patties.  I made a ton of them and froze them for future use.  They are such a good idea for all the extra garden zucchini that my boyfriend's country grandmother asked me for the recipe.

Very yummy! I put my shredded zucchini in strainer, salted it and let it sit for about an hour then blotted with paper towel. I used potato flakes instead of flour then coated them with panko bread crumbs before frying. My husband who won't eat zucchini loved them.

I don't usually have zucchini, but someone gave me one yesterday and this recipe showed up in my mail today.  I followed the repipe, which I like to do the first time before I start changing the next time.  I will not have to do any changes it was just great as it was. Oops I did squeeze out the liquid from the zucchini.

These were good- but the recipe needed tweaking, namely the addition of spices (garlic, onion powder, red pepper, ground mustard). Used mashed potato flakes as suggested by other reviewers- I think this made a big difference in the consistency of the patties. We dipped the patties in sour cream. Not a super healthy side dish, but a good way to use a large amount of zucchini- I would make them again.

These were delicious and a snap to make. They were crispy on the outside and soft inside. I may try adding some shredded carrot next time to make them even prettier. Served with sour cream. Thanks!

These were amazing! I have made them twice now and the first time I followed the recipe exactly. They turned out a little gooey inside so the second time I did what others have suggested and drained the zucchini, huge difference. The second time I also added a clove of minced garlic and some finely chopped bell pepper. They were soooo good, I definitely recommend making these, just make sure to drain the zucchini:)

These are delicious.  With all the salt in the cheese, no additional is needed.  I've made it with or without onion, it is optional.  I usually add fresh herbs from my garden such as basil, parsley, oregano, and dill.  My husband absolutely LOVES these things.  I like to serve them with lightly steamed veggies (whatever in my garden is ready to eat), and sometimes rosemary red potatoes.

These are SUPERB!! I like them with cheddar instead of mozzarella, add pepper, Johnny's Seasoning and some italian breadcrumbs to the mixture. I then rolled these in a mixture of italian breadcrumbs and cornmeal, and fry them on a pan greased with shortening. SO GOOD!

Great!  I made these last night exactly as the recipe read except for the addition of some garlic powder.  Served with marinara sauce on the side with a cucumber/dill salad and cottage cheese for a nice light supper.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.  Thanks for a winner.

This is a very forgiving recipe, you can substitute in other cheeses if you don't have the mozz & parmesan on hand, quantities don't need to be exact.  Have used it several times and will use it many more.  Thank you thank you thank you!

Great recipe! Just had them for lunch today and I had to make a total of two and a half batches. My husband loved them and because I subbed potato flakes for the flour it was gluten free. I served with Southwest dipping sauce and sour cream. Also minced a bit of hot red pepper in the mix for our preference. Yummy, thanks for the recipe, Sherlie.

Made these last night, they were great!  They taste just like the potato pancakes my mom makes.  I ate the mushy leftovers this morning for breakfast with a little butter...texture was kind of strange but still tasted good.  Next time I will definitely squeeze the liquid out of the zucchini after I grate it though.  Yummy recipe that I will keep using!

I cooked these exactly as given and found them bland, though, I did like them. Made another batch with 1/2 tsp coarse black pepper and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Worked for me. Added a little flavor without really detracting from the blend of ingredients. Liked it enough to make two more batches and froze them in Foodsaver bags for later.

good and easy recipe! my husband and daughter both enjoyed this. this time i used cheddar cheese instead of mozzerella an parmesan. i added a dash of red pepper flakes. to cut back on the fat, i sprayed a cookie sheet with pam, dropped the mixture on the sheet, dusted the tops with a little corn meal and resprayed the tops with pam.  i baked them for about 20 min. at 400degrees, then finished them under the broiler to crisp them up, turning over halfway through the broiling. wonderful. my daughter used hers like a soft open faced burrito, putting shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoe, onions, taco sauce. she loved it!

I made these after finding a great price on zucchini at the market.  I didn't have any parmesan cheese, but added a combination of mozzarella and monterrey jack.  As per the suggestion of another reviewer, I added extra onion, and squeezed the excess water from the zucchini by placing it all in a clean cotton towel and twisting it up until the extra water dripped out.  This actually needs very little oil in the pan, which is great.  I topped them with a little kosher salt and they were yummy even without any other toppings!

I've made this recipe many times now, my whole family loves them. Most recently I needed something vegetarian to serve at a family dinner. I had these leftover from a previous meal so I topped them with pasta sauce, some parmesan and shredded mozzerella, heated it at 350 F. for about 20 min. and served them with pasta on the side. My vegetarian family members loved it! Thanks again for this recipe! 7/21/03Really great taste... the whole family ate these up! The only change I made was to substitute cheddar cheese for the mozerella because that was what was on hand. Will definitely make these again.

I added old bay seasoning to mine because I thought it lacked flavor, but other than that they were the best zucchini patties that I have made.

These were excellent!  Much more flavorful than I had thought.  The cheese and onion adds a nice flavor and they are still light.

Delicious patties!  I may try a sharper cheese next time, like cheddar, so that I do not have to dip these in something else for added flavor.  This has the greatest texture though, thanks!!

With the grating and chopping, this isn't a recipe I'll make very often, but the flavor is nice.  One way my family will eat zucchini.

I had to give it a 3 for kid rating because I have no idea how kids would react to it, my daughters are too young to appreciate the flavour!
This recipe is GREAT! I do highly recommend that you wring all possible water out of the zucchinis. I do this by wrapping them in a clean tea towel and squeezing as much water I can. I also found that making this recipe in advance and leaving it in the fridge 1 hour or more, enhances the flavour.
I will DEFINITELY be making that one again, and again, and again!

I first found the recipe on a Bisquick box many years ago and have made it with cheddar or Swiss cheeses, too. I absolutely love them! I actually got my zucchini-hating husband and children to, not only eat the vegetable, but ask for more and for me to make it often. During the summer, when zucchini is plentiful, I grate as much as I can and put it in the freezer so we can enjoy these all year long!

Very good use of zucchini.  I did substitute instant potatoes for the flour, as one other rater suggested.  Also added some garlic.  I sauted mine in a very good quality olive oil. I could not have been more pleased.

Yum! This is now a favorite in our house even with the kids and I'm asked to make it every week. They taste amazing! Make sure after you grate the zucchini that you soak up the extra moisture with paper towels or whatever you usually use for that. You need to get rid of the excess water before you cook these. I used mostly zucchini and then one squash. Because other people said it tastes kind of bland with just the 1/2 cup of flour, I seasoned the mix with garlic powder, smoked paprika, and salt and pepper.

Followed the most helpful positive review and added potato flakes instead of flour. I'm terrible and frying things in general so I portioned it out into ramekins and baked them for 375 for 20-30 minutes as little single serving casseroles. They turned out awesome. My two year old even ate this. Great recipe.

I've never made any zucchini patties/cakes before. I burned the first batch and had to clean out the pan and start over! However, the rest of them came out fine after I made some adjustments. To start, the recipe should state that you need to drain and squeeze out most of the water from the zucchini. I added about 1/4 c of potato flakes because the first batch was too runny. I really liked the flavor the potato flakes gave it. I also added some garlic powder and a little Italian seasoning. These really cook better when they are small and you only use a heaping tablespoon of batter as the recipe states. The first batch I tried to make too big. Also, next time I won't put the whole 2 T of oil in at once. The directions indicate to just put a "small amount of oil," and they cooked much better once I cleaned out the pan and just put about a tsp or so in. Then I added a bit more oil before cooking each batch. DH and I liked these with hot sauce on top, served with hummus and veggies and some cut up watermelon.

This recipe was so good! I have a few minor tips to add: 1) use "drained" ziccini (shred it and salt it to remove a lot of water then give it a rinse to remove any surface salt) and do not add extra salt to the batter and 2) use a 1/4 cup measure (or smaller!) or disher to measure out the zuccini-batter as it is very soft and easy to flip/fold over onto itself and a smaller patty flips better.

Unsure how such a great group of flavourful ingredients turned out to be so bland.  Removed some of the water as recommended.  It also stuck to the pan (That'd be the cheese!) so was a pain to cleanup from.  Will not be making again.

With a couple of adjustments based on other reviews, the result was a super delicious, super healthy meal that I will definitely be making again in the future! I subbed the flour with bread crumbs. I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs as others suggested, so I used plain ones and added Italian seasoning. I used a low fat 4 cheese Italian blend for my cheeses because it's what I had on hand, and added a bit of garlic powder to the mixture. I also made sure to squeeze the excess moisture out of the zucchini as many others suggested. To cut back on fat I baked the patties on a non-stick pan at 375 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. Hubby made a face when I told him I'd made a veggie meal for lunch, but changed his mind after his first bite!

Terrific basic zucchini pancake recipe to start with.  I added ranch mix to half the batch for a little more flavor and they were great.  Will try experimenting with different seasonings each time.

Made these the first time exactly how it says too except I added shredded carrots. Second time i made them was two days later and this time I added the carrots again and because I didn't have any garlic I added 1/2 a tsp of garlic powder & a squeeze of lime some black pepper and little bit of salt. There are a lot of reviews saying theirs was to runny...the only thing I can figure is they were useing oversized zucchini that were all seeds. My zucchinis were straight from the garden and were maybe 7 inches long 2 1/2 inches around. The mix was nice and thick not runny at all. Going to make them a third time in a couple of weeks for my church potluck.

Tried these for supper tonight, followed the recipe as written. Hubby didn't really care for them but I enjoyed them. I dipped them in a fresh salsa which I thought went really good with them. Paired with some steamed carrots and a fresh oil & vinegar salad and it made a great vegetarian meal.

I found these to be really delicious. I grated 4 small, thin zucchini's and added some salt and just tried to squeeze as much water out as possible by hand. Instead of all the flour, I used 2 tbsp flour and 1/3 cup italian bread crumbs. I also added 2 small garlic gloves. Other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe the same. I don't know if it was because of the changes I made (which I got from previous reviewers), but the patties ended up tasting like omelets lol. They were really, really good, I just did not expect to taste so much of the egg. But I don't mind! I will definitely make these again!

I have used this recipe for 4 years; it is delicious! However, I too made some changes. I use way less flour, so it's not as pancakey; I find if it's more like a pancake, you don't get to enjoy the flavors as much. I also use more onion & shred with food processor instead of grate. Sometimes I add garlic.

Ok - I made this Greek style!  Substitue crumbled feta instead of the mozzarella, sprinkle of dried mint and your are set!  A definite must is to drain the liquid from the zucchini first!  Trick:  use a potato ricer to squeeze out the liquid and this eliminates the time waiting for your zucchini to drain in the fridge!

My boyfriend and I love this recipe! I've made it twice. Both times I left out the flour and substituted some Italian style bread crumbs. I also added some pepper jack cheese, mostly just as a preference. I also created balls with the "batter" and coated them in more bread crumbs before cooking them. They turned out great! My only complaint would be how difficult the patties were to flip in the pan, which could be because I eliminated the flour and added extra cheese.

I thought these tasted really good! I have another go to recipe for zucchini patties, but wanted to test this recipe. This one has a little more cheese and the added onion. I thought it would take longer to make then it did, but it was actually really fast. They cook up real quickly to. I grated two kinds of small zucchinis and I ended up with 2 cups really packed when measured, and it worked fine. I also grated my own mozzarella cheese. I was only able to get 9 patties, instead of the 12, but I am the only one eating them anyway. I might try butter instead of oil next time as that is what I have always used, when I made them, and they normally seem a little less greasy. Either way, this made a nice lunch today and I may even have it for dinner.

These are AMAZING. I was looking for recipes to use up all the zucchini from my garden and was getting tired of breads and muffins. Bonus - my daughter thinks they are pancakes and will eat them, even with the hidden veggies! YUM. A new favorite in our kitchen.

These were incredibly good! I didn't have mozzarella so I substituted cheddar-jack. 
These are a crowd pleasing way to use up that seemingly endless zucchini crop! Fry them ahead of time and keep them warm on a cookie sheet lined with paper towels in a very low oven. My kids dipped them in Ranch, of course. Great recipe, thank you!!

I hve been trying to like zuchinni all my adult life, and now I have two recipes - this one and Zuchinni chips - that make this vegetable good enough to eat.  This is a great recipe!  Definitely give it a try!   [I had to use grated Romano and shredded Swiss but I look forward to trying it with the Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses.]

I make zucchini patties often, but this recipe looked so much better than mine that I decided to try it.  I made a number of alterations (mostly based on other reviews), but the recipe was such a great base that I still had to give it 4 stars!  My husband gobbled these down and said they were *much* better than my original ones!  Here's what I did: Replaced 1/4 cup flour with one slice of bread's worth of fresh, toasted breadcrumbs; added an additional 2 oz. shredded carrot to the mix for color and flavor; added 2 large cloves of fresh pressed garlic; added 1 tbs. salt-free Italian-seasoning plus 1/8 tsp. red pepper flakes and 1/8 tsp. fennel; and used basil-&-tomato-seasoned feta cheese in place of the parmesan.  I salted the zucchini and allowed it to drain in my collander in the sink for 30 minutes, then squeezed out the excess moisture.  I will be making these all the time now, for breakfast and dinner both.

Good base for a recipe, but you definitely want to add flavor or these patties are very bland.  I chopped up the zucchini in a small dice instead of grating so you could taste it, also added a diced tomato (seeded w/as little juice as possible), also added garlic salt (real garlic if you have it) and onion powder as well as a big squirt of Sriracha (be careful it's hotttt).  With the larger zucchini the texture was much better, but didn't hold together as well.  Also dipped in a tiny bit of Sriracha to eat.  Next time I will add red bell pepper.

Used 3 cloves garlic, subbed cheddar for parm. ( I was out) and used panko instead of flour. Cooked on cast iron pan with olive oil. Delicious!  My zucchini -hating husband, and 5 yr old left me a measly two (made about 9 small-sized cakes.

I squeezed the zucchini dry in a clean kitchen towel, increased the onion, added minced garlic and lots of fresh ground pepper, and baked them in the oven on cookie sheets coated in cooking spray. Less mess, less oil, and they held together better! Great recipe~!

I made these last night for dinner they are so good that it's worth planting zucchini in your garden just to make this recipe! The only thing that I did different was to add 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and added 1 clove garlic. I can't wait to make them again. Thank you for sharing you wonderful recipe.

I added a bit of salt to the shredded zucchini put it in a stainer and let the moisture sweat-out.  I used panko in place of flour and used 2 large cloves of garlic.  I served this with salsa and we loved it.

I don't know why I was surprised that we liked these so much but I was.  They have lots of flavor.  I used these as my side for pork chops along with a tossed salad.  How nice to not have potatoes or rice especially on a hot day.  Will definitely be making these often.  I did use EVOO and not the veg oil otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks

i was pleasantly surprised by how yummy these were.  i used potato flakes in place of the flour and decreased the cheeses a bit for personal preference.  will definitely make again.  i just sprayed the skillet with Pam in place of the vegetable oil to make it a bit more healthy.

These are delicious.  I am only rating it 4 stars because I made a lot modifications, but I would rate my final product 5 stars.  I grated my zucchini and then spun it in the salad spinner to get rid of excess liquid (I emptied the liquid out of the salad spinner twice, and the zucchini was still plenty wet.  I used 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs and 2 tablesoons flour instead of 1/2 cup of flour.  I also added a generous grinding of pepper, and 3 cloves of garlic, minced.  I dropped a "ball" of the mixture into additional breadcrumbs, and patted it flat to look more like a patty, coated all sides in the bread crumbs and fried in the pan.  My husband LOVED them.

Easy, fast and yummy! I omited the flour and used bisquick the moisture from the eggs and veggies worked perfect. I mixed a bit of  ranch with sour cream for a more zippy dipping sauce.

these are delicious! I made a few changes to make them a little more heart-friendly: i substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose. I also substituted 3 egg whites for 2 whole eggs i added 2 tblsp of minced garlic, 1 tsp red pepper flake, 1 tblsp of italian seasoning. I also lightly pan-fried them using olive oil PAM instead of vegetable oil. Very delicious with a side of marinara sauce and so nutritious, too!

LOVE THESE!!! The flavor is perfect! I did allow the zucchini to drain of excess water after shredding to cut down on moisture. Made the recipe exactly, except I also added about 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and about 1/4 tsp. black pepper to the mix. YUMMY!!! This will now be my new go to recipe for zucchini patties! Thanks for posting. :)

Some of the different things I have tried at different times to change it up a bit are to add a little cayenne pepper, use potato flakes for flour, added cheddar cheese in place of mozzarella, once I add a little Italian seasoning, and have even top it with just a little Bruschetta. Just pick a flavor that matches your meal.

These were really good and enjoyed by all! I used a combination of Jack and Cheddar cheeses along with the Parmesan, because that is what I had on hand. Also added garlic, a small amount of finely chopped bell pepper, black pepper,and seasoned salt. This was served for dinner with spaghetti, prego, and extra mushrooms. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing.

Definitely get as much liquid out of the zucchini as possible first (a little salt and paper towels work for me); these patties are gobbled up quickly by my guys.

These were delicious...After reading other reviews, I used half the amount of flour and substituted bread crumbs for the other half. Also, forming the patties a little bit and patting them with some breadcrumbs before putting them in the pan will help them stay together.

We ate these constantly last summer! I can't wait for the zucchini to come up so we can eat them again this year.  I made just one change, and that was to use Italian bread crumbs instead of flour.  Also, after dropping the dough into the oil, I flattened it with my spatula to make it a patty which was much easier to cook. I really love these zucchini latkes.

Made as directed for the first time and they were pretty good.  A little bland, though.  Definitely go with THINNER patties.  

I am going to make the following changes next time (but they have been requested again!)
1.  Half seasoned bread crumbs and half flour.
2.  More spices.
3.  Cook in electric skillet for evenness.
4.  Different cheese - cheddar/mozz mix.

I really loved these. I made them with Extra Sharp Cheddar cheese because that's what I had on hand, and they were excellent. The recipe is extrememly versatile I think, so you could modify it if you like, and I'm sure most modifications will be tasty (although the recipe is great in its original formula!) 

The batter surprisingly held together really well, I didn't have any problems with them falling apart. My only problem was that they were still slightly soft on the inside, so next time I think I'll make the patties a bit smaller.

For those that freeze these, how do you reheat them? Thanks!

These are awesome and so versatile. Made as written and servered with marinara sauce they have an Italian flavor. I made them with pepper-jack and sharp cheddar cheese with a dash of cumin for a Mexican flair. There is also a recipe on this site that adds Old Bay seasoning for a seafood flavor. I think just about any cheese combo would work with this recipe.

These were really great.  I have so much zuccini in the garden I am always looking for new recipes.  I did add 2 Tbsp. of garlic to this recipe and baked them at 425 degrees for about 30 minutes instead of frying them.  Delicious!!

We basically liked this recipe but it was not spicy enough to suit us.  To the recipe below we added 2 fresh (shredded) jalapeno peppers, 1 heaping tablespoon minced garlic, 1 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper, and 1/2 onion (chopped).  We used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour, and 3 egg whites instead of whole eggs.  That gave it some kick!

These are wonderful...although I did make a few changes...After shredding, I patted excess water out with paper towels.  I added cornmeal (for crunch) and bread crumbs along with the flour.  I also added shredded carrots (for color) and chopped fresh parsley, along with grated romano, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses).  I skipped the salt and used pepper.  I formed patties then added additional bread crumbs/cornmeal to get the right consistency.  I patted additional breadcrumbs on them before browning in olive oil.  With the three cheeses and additional changes, they were packed with flavor.

I combined tips from other reviews, which were very helpful.  After grating the zucchini I squeezed out the excess moisture, it was amazing how much liquid came out.  Also added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar.  All of us including the kids loved these.  I couldn't make them fast enough.

Delicious!  My 7 year old will not touch veggies, but found this one to be worth eating.  I used shredded cheddar and a little of onion powder instead of the onion (he would have seen those!) and everyone enjoyed them.  I will definitely make this again!

Very easy to make but a little bland.  Should have read some previous reviews ahead of time.  I think I would cut back a little on the 2 cheeses and take IYENGAR21's recommendations, along with a few others.  Will try again.

These were really good.  They turned out crisp on the outside and creamy inside.  I used a moz. cheese mix with colby-turned out great.  I shaped them into a ball in my hand, placed them in the pan, then pressed them down with my hand into a pattie.  Very quick, will make again for sure.

Delicious!  To us it tasted like a "fancy" potato pancake.  I used eggbeaters, low-fat cheese, and cooking spray in place of oil for reduced fat version.  We'll be having these a lot this summer!

This is a great recipe!  The flavors really meld together when left in the refrigerator for an hour or so before frying.  They were delicious, and my husband is already begging for them again.  Removing as much liquid from the zucchini is a good idea, making them crispier when frying.

Try placing the grated zucchini in clean dish towel and wringing it to remove excess liquid before mixing. I buy plain white cotton dish towels at one of the big box stores for uses such as this in the kitchen.

Like others suggested I added salt to grated zucchini and left in colander to remove the excess moisture. Mixed in black pepper and 1 garlic clove (no more than 1). Put in fridge until I was ready to use. I only had cheddar cheese to use. Sooooo yummy!!!
Next time I'll cut down on raw onion and garlic as I'm feeling quite garlicky and oniony after this.


Next time:
1. Can substitute flour with instant potato flakes or whole wheat flour. (I wonder if I could just add a boiled potato instead)
2. Add any other veg. - grated carrots, yellow squash or red bell pepper.
3. If I don't have cheese it's still good.
4. Add Italian style bread crumbs to mixture and coat patty before frying.
5. Can fry, broil, grill or bake
6. Serve w marinara sauce or sour cream w chives
7. Things you can add to mix up - mushrooms, parsley, fresh dill, pesto, red pepper flakes
(Not good for freezing - tastes bland once thawed)

These were excellent! I made a few changes based on the reviews. I soaked the shredded zucchini in salted water for a few minutes and then drained it in a strainer. I then squeezed the rest of the liquid out by wrapping the zucchini in a paper towel and ringing it out. Instead of the 1/2 cup of flour, I used 1 Tbsp of flour and 1/2 cup of Panko breadcrumbs, I had pre-shredded nacho cheese blend, so I used that instead of mozzarella. I also added salt, pepper, oregano and garlic powder. I served it with marinara sauce for dipping. They were delicious! If I didn't put the zucchini in myself, I wouldn't have known I was eating a vegetable. I will definitely be making them again.

4 stars as written but with a few tweaks it's a 5! 
Definitely squeeze out excess moisture from zucchini, and if your kids have an aversion to all things green like mine do, peel the zucchini first! Potato flakes are the way to go instead of flour and garlic and onion powder help amp up the flavor. 
They are great for a quick breakfast, pull them out of the freezer and reheat in a a super hot toaster oven for a crispy, quick breakfast!

I needed another recipe with all the zuccini I have in the garden.  This is wonderful.  I used potato flakes instead of flour.  I think next time I will add Italian seasoning for a little more flavor.

Extra spices are definitely required. I didn't care for the consistency though. Perhaps making them with bread crumbs instead of flour would help.

I'm a picky eater going vegetarian so trust my review- they're very good! Followed the advice of MALIBUMEL and used instant potatoes for a better texture. Also added salt & pepper. The final taste is similar to hashbrowns. Yum!

I absolutely love this recipe. Instead of serving with sour cream, I use hummus.

This is the only vegetable recipe I have that my children will eat willingly.  The last time I made this I fried them up ahead of time (they reheat just fine in the oven) and my kids kept sneaking into the kitchen to steal patties as they cooled.  I'm not making this up.  I pretended not to notice because I was trying not to pass out from shock.  We have renamed this recipe "Zucchini Patties of Awesomeness" in my house.  Thank you for sharing it with us!

These were delicious! I thought shredding and draining the zucchini might take be more than I wanted to do, but the shredding was quick, and I rolled the shreds up in a dishtowel and squeezed out the excess liquid in no time at all.  Easy recipe and yummy!

This recipe is very good.  I did substitute jack cheese for the mozzarella.  I assembled the mix a little different.  I did drain the zucchini after I shredded it in the food processor.  Just a few paper towels in a glass pie plate, changing a couple of times.  I placed the zucchini in a mixing bowl with the diced onion and flour.  I mixed w/a fork to coat the zucchini.  Then I added the Parmesan cheese and mixed again.  I then added the shredded cheese and mixed one more time. I added the beaten eggs and all came together just fine.  I cooked these in a large non-stick skillet with a little peanut oil.  I used a soup spoon and a fork for dropping into the skillet, and then I spread them out a bit.  Wait till they firm up before trying to flip or they will fall apart.  When you see the edges beginning to turn golden, take a look and if the bottom is golden and firm, gently flip over to cook the other side.  I could do four at a time, and I placed them on a cookie rack to drain. I had wax paper and paper towels below it to catch any drippings. This is when I added the sea salt for flavoring.  Adding salt to the mix will only cause the zucchini to weep more water.  These can be kept warm on the rack in the oven with a cookie sheet below it to catch any drippings.  All in all, a very easy recipe to prepare, and I believe these can be cooled and frozen on a cookie sheet over night, then individually wrapped, & frozen in the FoodSaver bag.
Just reheat in oven & serve. ThkU Sherlie

Good recipe to adjust to your liking. Like others I salted and squeezed my zukes to remove excess moisture. Only used a couple tbsps of flour and added 1/2C or so of panko. Used feta for my cheese. Added a microplaned garlic clove, red pepper flakes, chives, and black pepper. It made 6 larger sized patties using my #16 scoop. For a topping I mixed greek yogurt, dill, lemon juice, and cumin together. Not too shabby!

I thought these were wonderful! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added my own seasoning.  I used my favorite stand-by, garlic pepper, and some red pepper flakes.  I cooked them two ways: first, I tried the recommended way of frying them in oil; second, I just cooked them in the skillet with a little bit of cooking spray.  As I'm usually partial to any food that is fried, I was surprised to find that I preferred the cooking spray method.  I garnished with a few halved cherry tomatoes.  Yum! Yet another wonderful way to use all that dang zucchini!

These are awesome!  I did half flour and half panko bread crumbs and used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  This is the first time I bothered to rate a recipe but they were so good I had too!

We really loved this!  I made a few alterations: Added 2 cloves of garlic.  Tore one slice of bread into crumbs.  Used 1 c. "Italian Blend" cheese shreds.  Used 3 eggs.  Flour as needed.  I did NOT salt/drain the zucchini - No problem.  We topped it with a blend freshly chopped tomato and basil, salt and pepper, and an olive oil drizzle.  Yum!

I made these today and they were delicious.  This is a great bisic recipe that can be tweaked to your individual tastes.  Based on some reviewer suggestions, I substituted sharp cheddar for the mozarella cheese and used panko crumbs intead of flour. I also added a couple of jalapeno (seeded) peppers finely chopped.  After they got crispy, I moved them to layers of paper towel and also patted them on top to soak up excess oil.  I served them with spicy salsa (I like spice).  A great way to use up this plentiful vegetable in the summer.

I processed the fresh zuchinni in my food processor and put it in a bowl with paper towel on the bottom for a day to draw out the excess moisture.  The zuchinni was given to me by a co-worker.  This is a keeper and give it five thumbs up!!!

These are AMAZING.  No, really.  They're out of this world and I don't give a recommendation like that lightly.  I did remove the excess moisture from the zucchini by lightly salting it and pressing between paper towels.  I upped the mozzarella to about 3/4 cup and added about 1/2 c bread crumbs, 2 tsp of minced garlic and 1 tsp of oregano.  I tried making the patties the same size as the recipe states as well as making larger ones, and I'd stick with small ones.  Served with marinara and parmesan.  Will be making this a LOT!

The only thing I did different was to grate the onion along with the zucchini so there were no onion chunks.  Also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added a little nutmeg to the batter.  These were pretty darn good.

Another husband fave.  First attempt too greasy. Second, used a griddle with no extra oil/butter (cheese provided enough) but was too soggy.  Third try NAILED IT! Squeez the zucchini as dry as possible and cook the patties in a dry pan. Comes out nice and crispy. Great to play with spices too.

I blotted the shredded zucchini, added bread crumbs to the mixture, rolled the formed patties in bread crumbs, and made sure the oil was hot before putting in the pan. Also, I added red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and parsley to the mixture.

Wow! These little guys turned out fabulous! I added a dash of garlic powder and red pepper flakes to the batter for an added kick, and served them with sour cream. For my first time making these (and eating them, for that matter), I fell in love. Thanks, Sherlie!

These were fantastic! I made them so my vegetarian hubby would have something to eat at our last party. I was so rushed I forgot to make a sauce or garnish so it was served plain, but EVERYONE (even my 3 and 4 year old) loved them! They were all eaten immediately, I wish I had made a double or triple recipe! People were literally hounding me the next day to send them the recipe. I made it exactly as written except I used a Romano and Parmesan blend instead of just Parmesan. I don't have a food processor so I used a cheese grater to grate the zucchini. It was fast, easy, and simple to clean up. This was so easy to make and so delicious! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

To me a 3 is slightly below average... I didn't hate them, but I didn't love them. The only change I made was using Italian bread crumbs instead of the flour which should have only made them more tasty. They were just very plain and bland. I like the concept so I might tinker and add some garlic and jalapeno. Maybe some parsley or basil? Something...anything...

These patties were a huge hit with my family.  I did let the zucchini sit for 40 minutes before i added them in with the other ingredients.  I made enough to send leftovers in my husband's lunch but there were no patties left - my boys couldn't get enough of them! A great way to disguise vegetables for picky eaters! My husband thought these tasted similar to potato pancakes.

My family loved these! I coated them in panko before frying and they were so crispy.I served them with marinara sauce. Next time I make them I'll be adding a bit of chopped red pepper and old bay seasoning.

These are great. The kids love them.  I use less cheese than this calls for just to make them a little more healthy.  The kids still like them a lot.

This was an awesome recipe even though mine didn't come out as expected.  I basically followed the reciped but sauted minced onions, mushrooms and garlic which was added into the mix.  They were very tasty but mine came out a little mushy.  All my fault.  I have plans for another adventure into this one.  Might try deep fried zucchini balls!

Very good. After grating the zucchini, I found it very wet, so I put it in a clean tea towel and then squeezed out the excess liquid.  I also added in minced garlic, basil, oregano, red pepper flakes, and Mrs Dash.  Tthen served with sour cream and salsa.  A great way to use up all the zucchini.

Okay, I will be the first to say that maybe I did something wrong.  It was just okay to me.  Now, my husband LOVED them.  He said they tasted like fried squash.  I think frying squash is easier and less mess.  I would love to give a suggestion but I don't one.  Like I said, they were fine just not for me.

Yum.  Made just as written, but sauted onions.  Neither my husband or myself like to crunch into onions.  When they were reheated the next, they were not crispy of course, but they were quiche-like.  I am sure I will make again and again.

WOW, this is good!  I had to use cheddar because I did not have mozzarella and, as I always do, I subbed half of the flour for whole wheat.  I grated the onion, cheese, and zucchini all on the same grater.  The first batch stuck to the pan so I turned the heat to medium-low, used my misto to lightly spray olive oil and let them sit for several more minutes to crisp.  Again, WOW...and the kids loved them, too!

I have made this recipe all summer! My advice is to salt and drain the shredded zucchini before mixing. I like to use cheddar cheese instead of the mozzarella. Sometimes I serve them with ranch dressing.

These are fast and easy and a great way to use the zucchini from your garden. I always wring out my zucchini in a clean cloth to remove excess moisture before adding it to the batter.  Other than that I made them exactly as written.  They were very good, but next time I will add more jazz and/or serve them with sour cream.

I made this as written, and they turned out perfectly.  I have tried to make these in the past with other recipes, and have had trouble keeping the patties together. I do think the flavor needs to be tweaked a little, maybe some onion powder, more parm, no mozzarella, and butter added to the frying oil.

I followed the recipe as directed but took the advice of other posters and drained the zucchini.  My family did not enjoy this patty.  It reminded me of a pancake with zucchini in it but it had no flavor/taste. I will not make this recipe again.

I tried squeezing some of the water out of the shredded zucchini but didn't get much out that way.  I went ahead with the recipe and found that the patties would not stick together.  Next time I will let the zucchini sit longer, and perhaps squeeze them in a cloth, to try to get more water out.  But even though the patties did not stick together, they were still delicious!

Quite enjoyable, and very easy to make! My only suggestions is to drain the squash and use panko breadcrumbs instead of the flour. It's really fine with the flour, but the panko just gives it a different texture that I tend to like. Finally, don't be afraid to adjust the seasonings to your liking. It's a very flexible recipe.

Love It!! I made this with breakfast in place of hashbrowns. I was very surprise how good it came out. My 7 and 3 year old thought it was really hashbrowns! They had no idea they were eating zucchini !!  
I then tryed it with potatoes and that was good but I like ZUCCHINE better. Thanks or sharing and God Bless!!

These are wonderful! Have made them twice now with rave reviews. Great recipie I add a wee bit more mozzerella cheese and a wee bit of garlic, then coat with bread crumbs. Great way to use up the stores of zucchini that I have in my freezer fom the summer! Tastes good dipped in marinara sauce.  Will make again for sure cos my father is always asking for them.

I was very disappointed after reading such good reviews on this recipe.  I even added in a few extra spices-- garlic, black pepper, parsley, and thyme, but it just tasted watery and bland.  We were able to force it down by loading it with salsa.  I won't be making this recipe again.

Fantastic. Like everybody else it seems I modded these a lot mostly involving a ton of garlic, celery salt, and extra cheese (included cheddar). Yummy. Will be trying endless variations of these (or until the zucchini from the garden runs out ;)

I followed the recipe because I'm a firm believer in not tweaking it until after I've made it once.  I measured and did not eyeball any of the ingredients and had to add extra eggs to get everything incorporated.  I urge everyone to make one pattie, taste it then adjust for salt and consider adding pepper as they are on the bland side.  My mother made something similar and I lost her recipe over the years and this one is the closest to hers.  They were a big hit as a side dish and there wasn't one left and I doubled the recipe.  All in all it's a 5 star recipe.

These are very, very good and as easy as they were tasty. Made exactly as described except we threw in two pinches of granulated garlic. Thank you, great recipe. I do think its important to grate ahead, salt and let the excess water drain/sweat out. I also really squeezed the grated zucchini to remove what water I could.

Fantastic!  Probably the best zucchini patties I've ever had--and so quick and easy!  I used a gluten free flour blend in place of the all-purpose flour and added a sprinkle of garlic powder.  I will make this again for sure!

Easy and delicious. I salted the shredded zucchini and let it sit in a colander for 10 minutes to soften and drain, then squeezed out extra water. Added 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. Go light on the garlic and the onions, otherwise they will overpower the lightness of the other flavors. We topped the patties with homemade bruschetta and they were fantastic. These would be a great addition for brunch, instead of hashbrowns or home fries. If these freeze and reheat well (I have a few test patties in the freezer) this recipe may be the answer to the glut of zucchini from our garden...

My husband gave me that "I wonder what I can snack on later when I'm hungry" look when I told him I was making zucchini patties for dinner.  He loved them!  First time I made them, I didn't have mozzarella but had a bunch of freshly-grated parmesan.  Tasted great.  Making them again tonight with the mozzarella-parmesan combo.  My suggestion - if you have a "salad spinner" sitting in your cupboard, use it to get the excess moisture out of the grated zucchini!  Worked REALLY well!

These were okay!  They were a little too wet though.  Next time I will try adding some flour.  I did however take others suggestions and used chopped peppers in half and that added great flavor.

It doesn't say in the recipe that the zucchini needs to dry out some. As a result I followed the recipe exactly and had some mushy patties that were burnt on the outside and unappetizing on the inside. IF I do make this again I will definitely let the zucchini drain in a colander like others suggested.

Flawless.  I was given a 3 lb zucchini and looking for ways to use this.  My dad ate all 12 patties in an evening, so I made another batch.  Served it as a side with some gazpacho.  Great!

I made a couple adjustments. I salted the grated zucchini first and let it sit in a strainer to draw out the excess moisture. Then I patted it dry with paper towels. I also added some chopped garlic.

This is an awesome recipe.  They are very tasty.  I did add a shredded carrot for color & taste.  I also used some potato flakes as someone recomended.  This recipe is a keeper for sure. Thanks so much for sharing this with me.

Excellent recipe. I used 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, but I'd up the salt a bit. I squeezed out the zucchini to make it dry beofre making the pancake batter. I added one garlic, finely minced. The next time I make these pancakes, I'll add one scallion, finely chopped for more color.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used potato flakes instead of flour.  Added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp salt and pepper.  HA!  I just realized I left out the cheeses!!  But they tasted really good.  They would probably be heartier with the cheese. :) I buttered a pan and baked them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, turning once midway through.  I sprayed the tops with butter flavored Pam, but I think brushing with a little melted butter would be better for taste and browning.  My butter side browned beautifully.

The flavor is great, but the "batter" is quite thin when following this recipe as-is.  In fact, I added bread crumbs to the recipe & it was STILL too thin.  The trick is probably in salting & draining the grated zucchini before use.  I found also that refrigerating the batter & dropping fairly small amounts of batter into the pan helped them cook through & be more manageable.  Again, very tasty; served with tzatziki sauce.

These were good. I  made them for a party so I quadrupled the recipe - 8 cups zucchini, 6 eggs, 1 cup onion, 1 cup flour, 1 cup seasoned breadcrumbs, 2 cups parmesan, 2 cups mozzarella, 2 tsp. kosher salt, pepper, fresh parsley and 4 cloves minced garlic as per suggestions by other reviewers. I made them on my electric griddle drizzled with a little olive oil to save time and excess oil. They came out great. I made them ahead of time and froze them. I plan to pop them in the oven to reheat and serve them with marinara.

I followed this recipe to the hilt - made sure to "dry out" the grated zucchini a bit between two paper towels so they wouldn't give off too much liquid when combined with the other ingredients.  Even my small (toddler-aged) children DEVOURED these.  Will definitely become a staple during the summer months.

I made this following the recipe pretty carefully, but I decided to bake them instead of frying them in a pan. It didn't work *quite* as well, but it wasn't a failure. I baked the patties on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven, turning every 5-8 minutes, until browned. they didn't come out crispy, but they were good. The next day, I reheated some leftovers in the toaster oven using the "toast" setting, and they were much better.

This was a nice base recipe, but like some others reviewers we found these to be a bit bland as written. Added chives, scallion, garlic, and some lemon pepper to the mix and they were amazing. Next time I may try some pine nuts or capers too.

This is a very good recipe which I will definitely use again. After reading other reviews, I made a couple adjustments. I allowed the zucchini to drain on some paper towels and added garlic powder,pepper and about 1/2 cup of Panko bread crumbs.  My husband wasn't sure he would like them but he was pleasantly surprised will double the batch next time and try some other cheeses as well.  We tried them plain and with sour cream. I thought both were very yummy but the husband liked them with sour cream! Thanks for the recipe, Sherlie.

Didn't have any trouble with wet zucchini, just grated it and threw it all together. After I made it to the recipe, which is tasty, I did add some garlic powder and pepper. Easy recipe to change up or add to for spices and cheeses. Good stuff! Thanks.

These were excellent, I did use potato flakes in place of the flour and I really think it makes the biggest difference. I also squeeze most of the liquid out of the zucchini. I've used Italian Blend cheese when I didn't have mozzerella and also a combination of that with cheddar. We really liked a few warm sliced roasted red peppers on top. Great way to use zucchini.

Good but getting excess water out of the zukes is a must!  My mix sat in the fridge for a couple hours and appeared more watery,  so I added 1/4 c. of bread crumbs right before frying. Next time, I'll try baking as another reviewer suggested-great taste for a foundation recipe!

Are you looking for a different way to enjoy zucchini? Give this a try. Great flavors and so easy to make. I rarely deviate from the original recipe on my first try. But, I couldn't resist adding about a tablespoon of minced garlic. I also sauteed the patties in olive oil. My garden keeps producing zucchini so I will be making this again.

I thought this recipe was good. Instead of flour I added 1/4 c. Italian bread crumbs and 1/4 c. instant potato flakes as per others' recommendations. I also added a little garlic and sweet basil. Instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil. Yum!

These are really good.  I did add a little salt to the grated zucchini and let the water drain off for about an hour before mixing it in.

I used bread crumbs in addition to a smaller amount of flour (1/4) cup. These were awesome with additional seasoning. I used garlic, creole seasoning, salt and pepper.

This is a real keeper! I used a smoked mozzerella and it really gave them a nice flavor. I would recommend mincing the onion. All in all these were fantastic with just a dollop of sour cream on top.

So good and easy! Read the other reviews, made a few minor changes/additions and served with "best marinara sauce yet" from this site. I used 1/4 C wheat flour, 1/4 C seasoned breadcrumbs, 1/2 t garlic powder, fresh parsley and 1 shallot. Last season I had shredded giant zucchinis and froze them in 3 C portions. Now all I had to do was take 1 bag out, put in colander and put under hot water to thaw it very quickly. Then squeeze the moisture out and it was ready. My 3 year-old and 18-month-old kids loved this for dinner.

I have made this recipe before and I really like it but I make it a little different. I use garlic instead of onion and I also use a small amount of Italian breadcrumbs. You have to squeeze the zucchini to get out the excess water so it will fry nicely. I serve this with spicy ranch or tomato sauce!

Very good, but seems to be missing a little something.  It's hard to get all of it crispy.  It does have a  lot of flavor. I usually add garlic powder and bread crumbs.  Maybe some shredded carrots and onion would be good.  I'll try that next time for more flavor.

I did what other reviewers suggested and salted the zucchini, washed it out and then squeezed it dry with a potato ricer, making the zucchini much easier to work with.  I also added garlic powder and black pepper to combat the blandness.  Although it tasted ok, I didn't like the end texture of this patty - it felt kind of gummy and too cheesy.  I think if I ever make these again, I will use bread crumbs as well to give it a more solid texture and try to flatten them as much as possible.

I absolutely adore this as a fall side-kick to our fish dishes!  I use twice as much zuccini and half of the cheeses.  In addition I use seasoned salt rather than regular for an extra kick.  Picante is a fabulous topping!  I will use this through out the fall!

made these for dinner tonight with grilled steak.  Delicious.  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and substituted the flour with mashed potato flakes.  Precooked the onion before adding to the zuchinni mixture and added a garlic, bell pepper seasoning. Served with a dollop of sour cream.  They were delicious.

These were very good. Even my picky husband liked them. We only wound up with 1 1/2 C of grated zucchini so we added 1/2 C shredded carrots that we cut up to make them even  finer. Thanks, we'll be making this again.

I don't know why everyone is trying to make these stay together or is worried about mixture being too wet. They are supposed to be dropped by spoonfuls onto a hot griddle, like pancakes, not shaped like crab cakes. I followed the recipe exactly and we LOVED them. This is the best "what to do with all that zucchini" recipe I have seen. I have also experimented with using peeled eggplant instead, and it tastes even BETTER. I have also used Old Cheddar instead of mozzerella. I have a bunch frozen for quick lunches. Will probably try adding garlic or Italian seasoning next time.

This recipe has to be played with a lot. Spices are a must. I added a bunch of garlic, pepper and paprika. I did drain the zucchini but still had to use more bread crumbs and flour than the recipe called for. Eventually it ended up being pretty good with sour cream on top. I felt the italian bread crumbs left a funny aftertaste, next time I'll try flour and instant mashed potatoes like one person suggested. You have to make them small so they'll flip without falling apart (in a non stick skillet), I used cooking spray instead of oil and that worked just fine.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added fresh ground black pepper and a little garlic powder.  The mix did seem to get watery as I went on, next time I may sprinkle zucchini w/salt ahead of time, drain, & then fry.  The trick to them staying together was to spread them thin, and not flip until golden brown on bottom, then turn.  The thicker ones were mushy inside.  But a good idea for zucchini.

The recipe I created for zucchini patties, contains some potato flakes which does keep them together better, also try adding some herbs like chopped parsley, or oregano.You can also try baking these in a cookie sheet and cutting into fingers for dipping. These are good with pizza sauce, or yogurt dill dip. Also try using a blender or chopper to get the zucchini finer otherwise you may get a stringy texture, the sane goes for carrot cakes.

This has become a family favorite for both me and my daughter's family. We use the recipe as is but also add variations such as different kinds of crumbs instead of flour. We also add herbs and spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg if we want a sweeter taste or italian seasonings or greek seasonings if we want a less sweet taste. We have even tried it adding a teaspoon of hot chili oil to the recipe and like that too. We have used gravy, sauces and fruit syrups. We love this. Our four zucchini plants are having a hard keeping up with the demand.

Amazing! Oh My God! These Veggie Patties are delicious! I can't say enough about them. My husband and children loved them also. They were so good I sealed a bunch up with my Foodsaver and through them in the freezor for a quick snack or as a meal. Yummy!

YumYUM, these were great, the only change I made was using some grated mexican cheese blend and added celery salt.  And they were easy to make. Will try this one agian.

YUM!  These were fantastic.....and a really easy way to use up some zucchini.   They tasted almost like egg foo yung, maybe next time I'll add more flour to make them more like a cake, but even as is, these are excellent served with some sour cream.  I WILL be making these again!

don't really like onions, so this was a bit dissapointing to me. My roomate on the other hand loves onions, but she still thought these were a little weird. They took a while to cook right and had a weird texture. But if you like that sort of thing, you might love this.

These zucchini patties are incredible.  I tried just dropping the mixture into the pan, but that resulted in  undercooked crumbles.  Try forming thin disks first.  You'll get amazing zucchini hashbrowns.

Very good. However they are heavy duty---they would be better served as a vegetarian meal than a side dish. I added Old Bay seasoning.

The grown-ups loved it!  I used a shredded 6 cheese mix instead of just mozzarella.  The first batch didn't seem like the egg was cooked all the way through, so I reduced the heat & cooked longer.  Unfortunately the kids saw the "green" & were ready to say "yuck" before they tasted.  I will try yellow squash next time in hopes to fool them.

Very yummy!  It's a battle to stop everyone eating them as they come out of the pan (despite the molten lava cheese) so that I actually have some to put on the table.

Bless you Sherlie!!! I've finally found a veggie dish my kid will eat (with gobs of ketchup)!! I made these ahead and froze them on wax paper lined (sprayed lighlty w/ cooking oil) cookie sheet. I made half of the recipe without onion for my little one. Next time I think I'll make them with montery jack cheese and a diced hot pepper or pepper flakes added. I did make sure to get out as much water as possible like everyone recommended - these were very crisp.

My kids and husband loved the recipe.  
I used lowfat cheeses and egg substitutes
to lower the fat content!  What an easy way
to have them eat their veggies!  I will
make up a bunch of them and freeze for 
quick meals.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family. I made a few changes: I used two egg whites, panko bread crumbs instead of flour, green onions, and the best of all, I threw in a handful of jalapeno crisps. Topped them with a cilantro mayo. Mmmm!

I used all cheddar cheese in this recipe with grated zucchini and it was so good! A touch of powdered garlic and onion powder. There were no leftovers, even with my zucchini haters. Topped it with sour cream. You won't be sorry!

As suggested by another reviewer, I baked them at 375 for 20 minutes and flipped and baked another 15. Also used 1 T flour and 1/3c Italian bread crumbs. I only had about 1/3c pepper jack cheese and a small bit of left over feta but suspect would be with any kind of cheese on hand. I shredded the zuc then squeezed out water then packed into measuring cup until I got 2c. I got about 5 cakes out of the mix. I am freezing 2 to see how they hold up to a quick thaw for a quick breakfast.

I did scant 1/2 cup of flour and split mozzarella with some sharp finely shredded cheddar. I also added a splash of dry white wine to thin down. they were fantastic!

It’s an ok recipe but how do you not put seasoning? At the very least you use salt and then you can add Italian or any other seasonings you like. Maybe salting and draining it squeezing the liquid out of the zucchini in a towel would help too. Otherwise follow the recipe as is and it’s fine. You could add grated onion or red bell peppers or even jalapeños if you like spicy food. Get creative!

Really like these. One batch made 6 large, palm sized patties. Very versatile, allowing lots of options for what you would like to add. The recipe is 5 stars because its a wonderful base. These came out firm, browned up nicely, and i froze them. The oil in my pan is Coconut oil. which browned them up great. Also BIG TIP - I wrapped the shredded zucchini in papertowls for a few hours which i think really helped control the water level. will be making these again.

This is a very versatile recipe.  You can add herbs and spices if any origin and they come out great.  If you want sweet just leave out the onions and add cinnamon,  sugar and chopped nuts. Yum

I'd forgotten how wet of a vegetable zucchini was until today. It's been a long, long, long time since I cooked it b/c my husband doesn't care for it. Hwr, after years of refusals, he laid out half-a-row of the garden we plant with my MIL to seed zucchini for me. It had been so long since I made zucchini patties that I had to look up a recipe. (outright embarrassing) This was the closest to my late mom's recipe & the one I'd memorized so long ago. 

Not sure how it happened but our 21yo daughter actually loved it & came back for 2nds & 3rds! It needed a bit more salt, which I forgot to add before putting in the eggs & flour, so it wasn't to taste. Still turned out well. Hubby even had 2nds too!  Great recipe! Thanks for helping me bring a bit of Mom back into my life after so many years without her. I'll be making more & remembering to pick up paper towels to better dry the zucchini before mixing.

This has become a staple in my home - easy to make and tasty.  I've not really changed the recipe - other than changed up the cheeses depending on what I have on hand.

I did take advantage of the other reviews with regard to getting the excess liquid out of the zucchini.  What I like about this recipe (aside from how good it is) is that as a person with very modest cooking abilities, they were not only easy to make, but even I could make all sorts of substitutions (yellow squash, almond flour, sheep cheese) and they still came out perfectly.

Excellent!  But because I often add to or change recipes, and because I live in NM: I added a little medium (hot) green chile, pepper, and garlic powder (next time will use fresh garlic), and I sprinkled a little paprika on the patties. I had 2 for lunch with 2 peppered turkey breakfast link sausage, and they were great.

Amazing recipe! Love how easy and quick it was to prepare. I did add two cloves of garlic, black pepper and crushed red peppers for a little more flavor. I did substitute Italian-style bread crumbs for flour and I loved the end result- so flavorful. I know many have also used instant mashed potato flakes and will definitely incorporate it into the recipe next time. 

PS. I ate 3/4 of the batch in less than 24 hours. They were that good :)

I made this as the recipe is written.  It went together quickly and had a light taste, although fried. I did use a seasoned cast iron frying pan.

These are so good that i almost ate them all before my husband came home for dinner hahaha!  

I made some changes:instead of flour i used oatmeal and i greased and floured a baking pan and formed them into balls baking instead of frying.  I also put a little basil and oregano in them.  Served them with pasta & red sauce with a side salad.

We forgot to squeeze the juice out of the zucchini before mixing in the ingredients so we spent the rest of the time making up for that.  However, with lots of additional spices, breadcrumbs and cheese to thicken it enough to fry, they were good with marinara.  My husband really liked them.  Would be awesome as small fritters in a deep fryer!

I didn't have any cheese at home so tried this recipe without cheese and it was still good. I also did not drain the excess water from the zucchinis but added the salt just right before frying. Yummy!!

Great flavor and easy to put together! The only substitutions I made were using green onion, bread crumbs in place of flour, and Italian seasoning. Will definitely be making this again.

Can this recipe be adapted for baking?
Great recipe, but don't make the mistakes I made
1. I didn't drain the chopped zucchini before I mixed the ingredients, so I had to add a lot of Italian bread crumbs to dry up the mix.
2. I started frying with olive oil, thinking it would add flavor. But it burned at too low a temperature, and so did the patties. When I switched to canola oil the patties sautéed just fine. Golden brown instead of black!

i have been making this for years but had lost my recipe. I remembered that I used to add cornmeal instead of flour, liked the texture better.  I used the one suggestion of adding some potato flakes, which I did tonight & liked them even better.I used half flakes & half cornmeal.  I cooked four for my son before adding the onion because onion upsets his tummy. Then I added the onion & cooked the rest. I cooked mine using coconut oil on an electric griddle at 400 deg. This is a versatile recipe which give room for lots of variations. We serve with a dash of soy sauce. We have used left overs for sandwich in stead of bread

I did make a few changes. I used grated BelGioioso  parmesan and and provolone cheeses. I sprayed my griddle with Pam instead of oil mostly because I didn't want the zucchini to soak up too much oil. Also, I used my own homegrown zucchini. I had it frozen from last year and drained it and then used my salad spinner to take some of the extra moisture out. I did not chop it. Served with sour cream, it is delicious! I'd make it again. It's easy and makes a great snack.

I decided to go on a ten day meat fast and needed a recipe for some zucchini I had in the fridge. I followed the recipe with these few changes. I added one tablespoon of minced garlic, and some chopped cilantro to the mixture. I also added a dash of Old Bay, lemon pepper and 21 Salute seasoning from trader Joe's. I didn't use any salt and instead of two eggs I used one extra large brown egg. Once they were finished I topped them of with marinera sauce. They were delish!

Instead of using a grater, I ran the zucchini through the food processor to a course chop, then squeezed it out as much as possible in a kitchen towel before mixing with the other ingredients.  I will chop them ahead of time next time to allow more time for the liquid to drain off.   As suggested by other reviewers, I added garlic - A LOT of garlic - and substituted 1/2 of the flour with seasoned breadcrumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe.   Having not read the directions completely, I tried to pat these out like you would a tuna patty, and that clearly was not going to happen (it was quite "runny").  Once I noticed the direction to drop it in the pan by the spoonful, they began to cook up nicely and the runny consistency was no problem.  I think if you made them without seasoning them generously, they would be bland, but being forewarned by other reviewers, I went heavy with the garlic and black pepper, and used about 1/2 tsp (approx) of salt, and they were delicious.  Another Meatless Monday hit!  I am eager to try some of the other reviewers' variations  (like potato flakes for flour).

Needs more flavor or a sauce to get 5 stars.  Use some ranch dressing and it really tasted great

How does zucchini taste so good?  Seasoned, cheesed, and pan fried!  I will be making this many, many times!

**EDITED: to add that the next morning, I had a couple of these patties left over so  I refried them in a little butter to warm and dipped them into plain yogurt (sour cream would be same) for breakfast, and they were awesome! **

The flavor of these was very good. I did add a little chopped red bell pepper simply because I had one I wanted to use up, and it tasted very good in there. The only issue I had was the texture of the mixture was a little hard to work with. It was fairly gloppy (even after following the suggestion to salt and "bleed" the zucchini before using), and I really wanted to get a little breading (panko + italian breadcrumbs) onto the outside of them. I ended up sprinkling breading on a plate, spooning out a blob of mixture, and then sprinkling breading on top. It was a sloppy process to then transfer that to the hot pan. However, they held together just fine for flipping and then serving. I served them with warmed jarred marinara from Costco (my fav because it's delicious and has no sugar). My family liked them a lot. I'll make them again, but I'll toy with the ratios a bit to see if I can make them easier to manage.

We love squash but zucchini not so much. Was given two HUGE zucchini so I tried this recipe. They were GREAT! Easy to make and they fried up quickly. We tried both sour cream and pasta sauce but decided we liked remoulade sauce the best as a dressing for the patties.

These were really great.  They had a nice flavor and reminded me somewhat of potato pancakes but lower in calories.  Will be making them again. I used Italian bread crumbs  instead of the flour.  Next time I will draw the water out of the zucchini.

These were wonderful and so easy to make! I used this last minute to cook up some zucchini before it went bad.... due to my daughter's gluten intolerance, I used gluten free flour which is usually difficult to keep from falling apart but it held together very well and tasted delicious. I'm so glad I found this!

I ended up adding more flour, because the zucchini was very wet. I see another cook dried it in a paper towel. I'll do that next time. Great dish though!

I forgot to squeeze the moisture out of the grated zucchini so the patties were a bit wet inside, but we loved the final product.  Will definitely make them again.  Delicious.

I made this but I made a Paleo version of it. 1 lb of ground beef. A 1/2 cup of almond flour instead and no cheese. I seasoned with salt, chili powder, minced garlic, and pepper. Freaking awesome!

They were very tasty but a bit too wet.  Maybe a little more flour or some breadcrumbs would help. I plan on making them again when our garden starts producing some zucchini.

Great recipe. I did add 2 minced cloves of garlic as others had suggested. The patties came out lightly browned and crisp on the edges and moist and tender in the center.  I will definitely be making them again and will be experimenting with some fresh herbs from my garden in the next mix. Thanks for submitting the recipe.

Great recipe. They came out lovely and brown and very tasty.  I'm not a fan of parmesan (since I learned what it is made of), so I used 1/2 cup sharp cheddar and a  1/2 cup mozzarella and a bit of cayenne for flavor. 

Thank you for the recipe

First round, We made these as written. A bit heavy. Second time, instead of frying the patties, we put the batter on the George Foreman Grill. Oh My Gosh! What a difference! I'll NEVER go back to frying them again!

This are fantastic!  As suggested, I added seasoned bread crumbs, a bit of garlic powder and just a touch of red pepper flakes, but I think the original recipe would be fine as written.  Next time I will try to bake them to make them healthier..... when the weather is cooler or we have the A/C running.

This recipe was perfect for lunch with a cup of potato soup and some home grown sliced tomatoes!  I didn't have any zucchini's on hand but did have some fresh cauliflower "rice" which was just as delicious!

OMG, what to do with all that left over zucchini?  Make these patties!  They were delicious.  We had them with our supper but they were just as good at breakfast time in place of hashbrowns.  One of our new favourites!

These are great! This is the third time I've made them with these modifications:  Reduce flour to 1/4 c. and don't salt until they come out of the frying pan.  I have never drained the zucchini or had an issue with wetness.  I do add:  2 Tbs. of chopped jalapenos (sliced from a jar),  2 sliced green onions (white and green),  1 cold baked potato, peeled and grated, and 1/4 tsp. baking powder.  Cook nice and golden and salt to taste.  They're the bomb!

So good!  The eggs and cheese almost make these taste omlette-ey.  Chop the onions finer so that they fry better, and are not hard/undercooked.

Great recipe and alternative vegetarian dish.  I substituted the flour with potatoe mix (this is the mash potatoe in a box) and it gives it a better texture and flavor. Highly recommended.

I love these patties. I have been making for years and got many requests for the recipe.
My way of getting rid of the zucchini juice is quite simple and efficient. I use the larger hole side of the box grater. I grate the zucchinis ( 2 medium size ones ) on a plate that I double line with paper towels ( good quality kind, not the cheap stuff) and wrap the paper towels around the zucchini shreds and press with my hands until the juice stops  coming out. Then, I mix all the ingredients in a bowl but don't add the salt (3/4 teaspoon is the right amount for my taste) until just before starting to fry the patties. I use a small cookie scoop to drop the mixture in the pan and the back of the scoop to flatten that little bit.
I sometime like to add some herbs, about 1/4 teaspoon of dried thyme or dried dill. Yum !

Followed recipe and loved it. Reheated the next day and served as a side dish to our fresh caught swordfish and it was even better! Delish and a compliment to the rest of the meal!

We grow lots of zucchini.  I'm always looking for good recipes to use it fresh.   My only  ingredient change was instead of salt, I added 3/4 tsp. garlic pepper (the blend I have includes salt). Drain zucchini after grating, and everything will come together well.   I did not drop these into the pan, instead, I spread the batter into the pan all at once, pressing it thin, and really let it brown before I flipped it.  I then cooked it to a golden on the underside, on med. low.  This was mainly because I didn't want to attend to all the little patties, and it came out really delicious.  I cut it like a pie in the frying pan and served it up.  Kids and husband wished I had a second pan.  Salsa is a great topper for this.

This immediately became a family favorite. I followed prior reviewers' ideas and swapped potato flakes for the flour. Because we like our fritters crispy, I sauteed at the higher end of medium-high skillet heat, and left the zucchini moist so that the outside was dark and crisp but the inside was moist. This was absolutely delicious, easy and the leftovers will be perfect for a side dish with dinner the next night.

I made this recipe last night.  It was absolutely delicious!  I would have made it exactly as stated, but when I finished chopping, I had extra onion so I threw it in.  I also had just enough Parmesan cheese left over to do nothing with.  You know how it is...not enough to be useful, but too much to throw the jar away.  So I threw it all in!  The rest I followed as written.  I used just a little Crisco in one of my cast iron skillets and they came out perfectly.  A little crusty on the outside and soft and cheesy on the inside.  I highly recommend.

I forgot to pick a zucchini from our garden and it was humongous so I peel some of the hard skin off cord it out and was able to use the sides. I Hate waste.
Pushed it  through the food processor and...ready too go.  I spiced it up as I notice so many others do.  Our Garden had chives and big leaf thyme and added a little more flour. So overall this is just a starter recipe lol.

Delicious! Kids loved them too! I didn't drain water out of the zucchini properly because I was in a rush. Because this caused the mixture to be too runny, I threw in seasoned bread crumbs (I also thought that the extra seasoning would be a plus as the original recipe sounded a tad bland). Terrific outcome. Next time I'm going to cook them in olive oil for fun!

This is an essential recipe; the reason being is that the RATIO of the ingredients are right.  When you tweek it, remember that the dry flour and egg is how it is held together so if you put extra stuff in it you need to increase egg and flour accordingly. It should look like a sticky batter that holds its shape.  Also, as many other reviewers mentioned, it is a must to put the shredded zucchini in a strainer with salt and let the water seep out. Then squeeze and press the bejesus out of it and for good measure use paper towel to push more water out.  This will ensure success.

I drained my zucchini first and used potato flakes instead of flour as suggested by another reviewer.  Also added some hot red pepper flakes & garlic.  We liked them and it was nice to find another recipe to use up my prolific zucchini!

My husband and I followed this recipe pretty closely (we added chopped fresh chives and used shallots instead of onions) and it was delicious! It's a total winner and we will be making this recipe all the time from now on.

They were OK, I'd eat them again but they aren't the kind of food I would crave. Definitely more a side dish or appetizer than a main dish. I agree with other reviewers in that they can be tastier if you add more flavorful ingredients like flavored bread crumbs, potato flakes, or herbs and spices. One thing to beware: the fresh zucchini doesn't cook much during the frying process. The frying mostly just melts the cheese and sets the egg. Eating fresh zucchini causes gas and bloating because the cellulose isn't weakened yet like it is after a thorough cooking. When your body digests cellulose the by-product is methane gas. I was intensely uncomfortable the evening after we had these with dinner. I recommend limiting consumption to 1-3 patties at one sitting.

I've used this recipe a bunch of times now to get through our abundance of zucchini from our garden. 

1. Grate a clove or two of garlic into the mixture.
2. Add pepper
3. Salt and Drain the zucchini for a while after grating. 

Primarily I eat them for breakfast or lunch. So tasty!

These are excellent.  I like that there is wiggle room.  I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, added dried parsley, salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper.  I used the full amount of parmesan and then half the amount of the other cheese (cheddar in my case), and used the potato flakes instead of the flour.  Hubby is not a huge zucchini fan, but he gobbled up his patties and asked when I am making them again.  Really great recipe.

The key to making successful patties that don't turn to mush is to SPIRALIZE the zucchini.  DO NOT put them in food processor.  Keeping them in spaghetti like strands will ensure quick cooking, without falling apart or taking a long time frying.  Once you make them correctly you can increase/tweak the ingredients to suit your taste.  Definitely worth making again if you blended the zucchini the first time around.  Great with spaghetti meat on top, or scrambled eggs, or chicken, or even as buns for turkey burgers.  So versatile!  This one's definitely a keeper in our house!

I made into a casserole. I cooked 375 until bubbly. I pulled out and put a light coating of tomato sauce we had left over in fridge on top and sprinkled more cheese on top. I placed back under the broiler until melted. Kids and Husband ate!! 

I will make this again and may even play around with adding in mushrooms and/or some hearty rice.

Very easy to make and had a splendid flavor.  I didn't drain the zucchini beforehand, I only read that after it was all mixed.  Added a dash of garlic powder and fresh flat leaf parsley that I had growing.  Will make again!!

This was phenomenal. I added diced orange bell peppers, chopped baby spinach, parsley, pepper, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, and some red pepper flakes, and used half as much flour (and used whole wheat flour) and it was delicious!

Currently making these as I type this review. Going by the recipe, it turns out too liquidy and they don't turn out like patties at all..more like mush. I added probably about another 1/2 cup of flour to see if it made a difference or not. So far so good..not sure taste wise as they are still cooking.

If you're going to make the recipe, double the flour in the recipe to 1 cup instead of a 1/2 cup.

This is a great and affordable recipe! I've been making them in a waffle iron which is quick and adds some texture. I also add some cheddar cheese and use Old Bay to season.

This was okay.  I made it as is, but I think I expected it to be crispy since it was pan-fried, but it wasn't.  I think there was just way too much cheese for my liking.  I think I would try to make these again but maybe with just a bit of parmesan.

These were really tasty, but really messy to make.  I squeezed out as much water as I could and they were still sloppy to form.  Also by adding so much cheese and frying them you kind of ruin the nutritional factor of the vegetable.

Great idea for zucchini.  I added a few more spices to give it more flavor.  Needed to drain teh zucchini and add some more flour...it was very runny.

My husband liked this recipe a lot better than I did. I'm not one for fried food, so after frying 2 of these, I decided to bake the rest. They tasted pretty much the same, but with less oil. I think I'll stick to zoodles.

Absolutely loved it! I added about two tablespoons of garlic salt with parsley in it and some black pepper along with a dash of basil after hearing that it can be a little flavor less. It was amazing and my entire family loved it.

This was delicious!! I followed the recipe and it turned out great! You HAVE to drain the excess water of the zucchini first though! I also added some fresh minced garlic and a little adobo to the mix. Served it with homemade marinara sauce. My husband keeps asking me when I will be making it again... definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

The patties were runny and bland even though I drained and squeezed the zucchini. I think one egg would have been plenty.

Pretty good recipe and probably would have been good as is except for we like spicy food around here and have dietary restrictions, thanks. However, I'm not sure how this would have turned out if I hadn't squeezed the water out of the zucchini first. I have a gluten free house, so I took advice from one of the earlier posts and used instant mashed potatoes in place of flour and put in one tablespoon of baking powder. I also microplaned two cloves of garlic and finely chopped two tablespoons of onion and one whole poblano pepper into the mix. One last addition: 1 teaspoon each of garlic and onion power, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Everyone loved it -- I probably should have doubled the recipe. Oh and I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, which I added a squirt of lemon juice, some dill, cayenne pepper, and some garlic and onion powder.

Good recipe but we just thought something was missing.  Not sure what but we will try it again. I did allow the zucchini to drain a bit after I grated it but I don't think that made a difference.

Great recipe if you've been over-run by your garden zucchinis.  I made some adjustments based on reviews and used less flour & added bread crumbs. I also added a little garlic powder, parsley, and basil for flavour. Most importantly I put the shaved zucchiini in a colander, added salt and let it drain for about 10 mins, this is a must.

Desperate to use up the abundant supply of zucchini, we gave this a try. Followed recipe exactly. Yummy! We liked them best with sour cream and spicy salsa, or, even with ketchup. With ketchup you could've fooled me that they weren't potato patties.

This is a super Scrumdiddlyumptious recipe that is easy to follow and flexible with what you have in your fridge. I omitted the onions (I don't like them) and added some chopped garlic, Italian bread crumbs and shredded mozzarella cheese. That being said, I'm not sure there is going to be any left for dinner tonight. Did I mention how good these are?

FANTASTIC!! I omitted the flour and used Italian bread crumbs (3/4 - 1 C), I did 1/2 C onion instead of 1/4 C, and I added garlic and dill.  I also covered my patties in bread crumbs prior to frying in a spray oiled pan.  Topped these with marinara and a little mozzarella.  They were a big hit.  Will definitely make these again!

Loved it!  I am the only one in my house that likes zucchini, but my husband and two teenagers liked these.  My son loved them!  Changes I made were  that I used Locatelli Romano instead of Parmesan & Colby/Monterey Jack cheese because that is what I had on hand.  Also added some minced garlic.  I have already made them twice and the second time I doubled the recipe.  Now I have something to do with all the zucchini growing in my garden.  Thanks for the recipe!

As written the ingredients are a good base allowing you to be as creative as your palate would prefer. 

My tweaks: I used 5 cups of shredded zucchini. Mixed it in a bowl with a bit of kosher salt then poured it into a colander to drain for an hour.  In a food processor I put about 12 baby carrots, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 small red onion, an assortment of 8 luncheon size red, yellow and orange peppers. I pulsed the veggies several times and then put those into a tea towel to squeeze out excess moisture and put the veggies in a mixing bowl. Then I squeezed the excess water from the zucchini in the same way and added it to the veggies. 

To the bowl I added Italian bread crumbs and instant potato flakes, Italian seasoning, a bit of black pepper and paprika.  I added about 1 cup of fiesta mix shredded cheese and 1/2 cup of fresh shredded asiago cheese and finally 3 beaten eggs. Mixed it all well and placed the bowl in the fridge to chill for about an hour.

I lined 2 half sheet pans with parchment and sprayed with olive oil Pam. I formed the mix into burger size patties, covered one side with a mix of panko and grated Parmesan and placed the panko side down on the tray. I patted the panko mix on the top side of each of the 13 burgers and then sprayed each with the olive oil Pam.

These baked in a 375 degree oven for about 40 minutes flipping 1/2 way through.

The family loved them with sour cream. There were 3 of us and only 4 of the 13 burger size patties were left after dinner.

Loved these!  The only changes I made, were using garlic salt (1/2 teaspoon) instead of regular salt, and Asiago cheese instead of mozzarella since I had no mozzarella on hand, and grated the onion with the zucchini.  I cooked them in olive oil (personal preference).  The were so good, there was no need to use sour cream or sauce.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I LOVED this recipe! BUT the suggestion I would make is to squeeze the water out of the zucchini first, it was really juicy, I had to squeeze the excess out before I could even cook them or else they will fall apart but after you do that, they are really delicious!

This tasted great! I would definitely want to make again and especially for brunch. I used Italian Panko bread crumbs instead of flour. The grinding of the zucchini and the straining took a while as well so this is a labor intensive recipe. Also a lot of mine fell apart and weren't too firm. I'll try this recipe again and will maybe use half flour and half bread crumbs. But over all they tasted wonderful!

After reading the comments concerning this recipe, I just knew that I had to try it. This past summer I had an abundance of zucchini, so I shredded and froze some of it for future use. After defrosting, I did as many suggesting, draining the zucchini. I did make some changes, such as corn meal instead of flour, cheddar instead of Parmesan, garlic salt and red pepper flakes. I used 1/2 of a large onion and grated it as fine as I could. I also added some garlic. My husband and I both love this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.

WOW! These are so tasty! I made a major change- I used the leftover vegetables from making stock and mashed them up with the other ingredients. Then I had to leave out the mozzarella because I didnt have any, I also added 1 tbsp of flax seeds. I made them a bit larger and made them into veggie burgers! Amazing!

This was fabulous!  I followed a couple of suggestions by other folks, like patting the zucchini dry, and made a couple modifications based on what I had.  Did not add salt and subbed sharp cheddar for mozz.  Used potato flakes instead of flour and added some crushed red pepper flakes for a bit of zing.  Cut the serving size down for 2 people and used two zucchini.  Would totally make this again and maybe add mushrooms for some variety.  They came out nice and crispy and cheesey.

VERY, VERY GOOD.  I halved the recipe and that made 4 pretty nice sized patties.  The only change was that I added a couple of TBSP of seasoned Italian bread crumbs.  GREAT!!!!

I hate rating recipes when I change them a bit, but I did change this.  I added potato flakes as suggested by others.  I think regardless if it was flour or flakes, it was too much.  I'd probably cut it by 1/2 cup next time, because the consistency was a bit soggy (mashed-potato like) for me.

These were wonderful!  They were so similar to the potato pancakes that I used to eat at the church picnics in Northeast PA.  I loved them just as the recipe is written.  My family and I ate ours with sour cream and applesauce.  I used my food processor for the grating--huge time saver.

Wife really liked these, but they are a LOT of shredding and then there is so much grease involved in the frying process that the whole kitchen smells like grease.  If you can get over that, then they taste pretty good.

This recipe is a keeper.  i seasoned these with some garlic powder and original Mrs. Dash and coated with italian seasoned bread crumbs so that i wouldn't need the vegetable oil.  i cooked them 4-5 minutes on each side until golden brown in a non-stick skillet sprayed with non stick cooking spray to reduce fat and calories more.  so good.  to those that added fresh garlic and basil or fried them in butter, that's probably what was wrong with it...

Very easy to make and so yummy! I did add a bit extra onion (by accident) but it did not seem to matter. Also added a little extra flour because it seemed a bit watery. FYI, take it easy on the salt, with the cheese it really does not need much additional salt at all. I served it with tomato sauce on top and it was absolutely delicious.

My 6 and 3 year old children LOVED these!!  I did make a few changes after reading the other reviews. I added an extra egg but I think I had more that 2 cups zucchini anyways (i didn't measure). I used green onions instead of white because that is what I had on hand but would do it again since I like the texture better, used a mix of bisquick and panko bread crumbs instead of white flour and added garlic.  Served it with a side of pizza sauce!  To make it dairy free for my son who has an allergy, I separated the mixture before adding the cheese and used Trader Joes VEGAN mozzarella shreds and cooked his first.  Will make this recipe again and again!!

My five year old asked me if I could make these all of the time! Anything with cheese is good in our book. The only thing I changed was that I only used 1/4 c flour and and added 1/2 c seasoned Panko bread crumbs. I did try to dry the shredded zucchini as well. This was a nice side dish for something different.

Just made it for my kids and they loved it and so did I!  I added bread crumbs (1/2 cup) and minced garlic to the recipe and it turned out very yummy.  I found that adding the flour (1/4 cup) really helped to bind it together and it fried up nicely into golden brown patties.  Definitely a keeper and could add other veggies like grated carrot and minced mushrooms...

So Good! Easy too! I substituted rolled oats with a teaspoon of baking powder for the flour(healthier this way). Turned out really great. I could taste the eggs though not sure if that was because I didn't use flour so it didn't mix up the same...

This was a good recipe after some modifications, first off the consistency was very very watery, next time I will drain the zucchini first. Because it was so watery, I used bread crumbs to help it along
I tested one pattie before cooking the others and like other reviewers said it was bland so I added additional salt, black pepper, fresh garlic and some chipotle pepper for an additional little kick. They were much better.

These are GREAT, and will definitely become a regular staple in my house. But also, don't limit yourself to zucchini - my local store was out of zucchini, so I made two versions - one with cooked spinach and chard, another with portobello mushrooms. Both turned out great! I kept everything else the same, just changed the vegetables. 

I will probably play around with a variety of vegetables going forward.

Used whole wheat flour instead of white, and added a bit extra of mozzarella because I didn't have fresh parm. Added a couple shakes of dried/shaker parm for good measure and they were fastastic!  A definite keeper!

As written this recipe is about 4.5 stars.  Adding some garlic and "sauteing" them in olive oil knocks it up to a 5.  I had to make a gluten free flour (basically I used equal parts buckwheat, sorghum & brown rice flours).  These were extremely well received by even my non-zucchini loving family members.  I think adding mushrooms will knock them out of the park.

Kids loved it! Followed advice of IYENGAR21 by adding garlic, parsley, black pepper. 3 zucchini's made the 2 cups grated, and the kids helped grate it. Used onion powder instead of onions due to fact my hubby hates onions but I sneak the taste in through powder.  Was out of mozzarella so used small cubed white american instead.  Served with chicken stuffed pasta and topped with a portabello spaghetti sauce. Delicious!  Will make it again!

Good recipe, but needs quite a bit of tweaking as it seems a tad bland to me. Added fresh chopped garlic & italian bread crumbs to the mixture. May pat the patties down with more bread crumbs to see if they come out crispier.

The only reason I gave this recipe three stars was due to the texture- I don't know what I did wrong- but I'm going to have to try this one again sometime. The flavor is great, and they did cook into nice patties, ( though there was no way I would be able to form them into patties before placing them on the griddle,) but the inside was very mushy, even after they had been cooked for a good amount of time. I squeezed out as much moisture from the chopped veggies as I could, and even added a little more flour...maybe I used too much flour? In any case, although I couldn't get the texture right this time, the flavor was nice enough that I will try again!

Very tasty.  I used 1/4C flour + 1/4C Panko and cooked the patties in 1 Tbsp oil oil + 1 Tbls butter.  When I make these the next time I will add 1/2 tsp Old Bay for a little kick.

I made this recipe exactly as described, except I added some more bread crumbs as some of the reviewers suggested.  The patties wouldn't cook - they were complete mush.  I put them back in the bowl and mixed them with more flour and bread crumbs until they would cook solid; then they were really gritty and just tasted like flour.

These were delicious!  My 5 & 9 year old picky eaters LOVED them!  They were perfect as is, although I used onion powder instead of fresh onion as I didn't have one.

I am terrible when it comes to frying things...I just don't have the knack. So, after trying a few and wrecking them, I decided to pour the whole gosh darn mixture (I doubled it) into my pan, and cooked it. The result was like a yummy, creamy, veggie mashed potato dish (without the potatoes!) I would have loved the crunch of the cakes, but the mix was enjoyed by adults and kids alike, the way I ended up.

I made these for dinner tonight.  I had made them exactly as written before and would rate them that way as a three.  This time I read all the other reviews and the only change I made was to drain the salted zucchini for a few hours then pat dry, and substituted an equal amount of seasoned italian bread crumbs for the flour.  This makes them MUCH better, they hold together and crisp up better.  Mine really does look like the ones in the picture with the cherry tomatoes and I would serve them that way next time for a light lunch.  We ate them with a chicken sausage and mushroom ragout and a glass of the reisling I used in the ragout.  Delicious!

I've made this several times with various cheeses and all are good.  One suggestion for the person who said the batter was too runny.  Wait until the last thing before adding the salt, or better, salt while frying.  Salt draws the moisture out of the zucchini.  If it's added too early, you can end up with a very liquid batter.

I tried this recipe recently and I would strongly suggest that the zucchini is drained for 15 minutes before making the patties so that the patty mixture won't be soggy.  I added Italian dried herbs and garlic powder and used 1 tsp. Kosher salt.  I fried the patties in a mixture of 1/2 oil and 1/2 butter.  They tasted really good.

These were easy and delicious!  I used one whole zucchini (about 2 1/2 cups of grated zucchini), but I kept all of the other ingredient measurements the same. I produced 5-6 patties that came out perfectly!  I served them with sour cream and marinara sauce.  I will certainly make these again!

Excellent.  I substituted goat cheese for the mozzarella, dewatered the zucchini and added a bit more flour because the goat cheese is wetter than the mozzarella.  Addictive!

Second attempt was GOOD!
One egg only.
1/4 C rice flour instead of standard flour.
No salt, but used ~1T Bragg's aminos.  
YUMMERS!

Yum! These are so good. I used cheddar and colby jack cheese because it was what I had on hand. I was out of onion so I added onion powder. Also added 1/2 teaspoonful of Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Pepper just because I could. ;)

I only give 5 stars when it deserves it and this recipe certainly does! It was delicious and SO easy!  Definitely room for improvisation too!

This recipe is a regular favorite at our house.  With squash being so plentiful,  I tried this recipe subbing some of the zucchini with yellow squash.  To our amazement,  it turned out even better!  It had less water than if I had made it a purely zucchini version.

Oh my! These are SO good! I was looking for a quick recipe to use up some zucchini and came across this one! I shredded it in the food processor and squeezed the water out like others suggested. Also, added some garlic and used an Italian mix of cheeses since that's what I had on had. I dipped each patty in Panko crumbs before frying... YUM!! These were like a fried cheese/fried delicious treat! Will definitely make again.

I used a little more oil to shallow fry them, but they were delish! Even got a thumb sideways from my picky 13 year old (which is like 2 thumbs up for anything made out of vegetables). The only problem was that I ate too many!

Excellent recipe! A few modifications were adding chopped red bell pepper, breadcrumbs as suggested by others, and using tomato basil feta instead of mozzerella. Also, draining the zucchini first is a must! I scooped these into balls, fried them and served as appetizers at a party. They were gone in minutes!!

These are so good and easy! I'm low-carb so I use about 2 TBSP almond meal instead of flour with great results. This is a great recipe to use up extra veggies - I used some red bell pepper that I had left over and the patties were still delicious and pretty with flecks of red. I also add fresh parsley for an extra fresh flavor.

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used IDAHOAN potato flakes in place of the flour.  I also added an abundance of spices -- lots of garlic, salt, ground pepper and parsley.  I added some chopped crimini mushrooms and about 3/4 of an onion.  I used fresh parmesan but didn't have enough so substituted some romano and upped the mozza to 3/4 cup.  I found that after adding the listed ingredients, the mixture did not stick together well enough.  So, I added more potato flakes.  This did not help.  I ended up using 3 eggs and about 1- 1 1/2 cups of potato flakes just to get them to stick together.  The patties took a nice form but after the first bite, I wasn't wanting more! It was fairly flavorless, which was surprising considering the amount of spices I used!!  With a considerable amount more spices and less potato flakes (though I don't know how else you could get them to stick together) these could be good.  As for now, these are far too bland!

Very good!  Blotting dry zucchini is very helpful!  Didn't have Mozzarella cheese so used Colby Jack  added a nice flavor!  Instead of just salt I used garlic salt instead!

Delicious! I'm trying out being a vegetarian and this really hit the spot. I used mozzarella and colby jack cheese, (both reduced fat) instead of parmesan and added in seasoned bread crumbs. I topped it with reduced fat sour cream and salsa and it is awesome!

Good one, Sherlie!  My husband and I both loved your recipe.  This thrilled me because he doesn't usually care for veggies once they've been cooked.  This recipe was easy to assemble and fried up quuickly.  Wow...this one's  a keeper!!!  Love it!

I could not believe how delicious these were! But...I screwed up and added the oil to the mixture, so it made it pretty loose. I added more flour to balance it out. I think reviewers who said they were mushy may have done the same thing. I added some crushed red pepper b/c I like food spicy. Even w/my goof up, they were YUUUUUMMMMY! I will definitely make them again. Oh...and I didn't fry them- just non-stick spray (maybe that worked b/c the oil was in the mixture).

These were very good!  I added some ground pepper, garlic & a smidge of Mrs. Dash for flavor and I'm glad I did.  I also did half the flour and half italian bread crumbs.  These will be a regular in our house!

Very good! Just a hint, fry these as soon as you make them. Otherwise, the salt starts to drain the water from the vegetables and you end up with a wet patty!

Yum, yum, yum, so good!  I added garlic, italian seasoning and pepper and used Panko crumbs just because I like their texture.  Didn't have mozzarella cheese, so I used pepper jack which added a nice spice.  I drained the zucchini but didn't salt it; it was definitely a little runny, but cooked out okay.  Hubby really like it too!

Very easy to make, quick simple meal- going by other's suggestions, I squeezed the water out of the zukes first, sauteed chopped mushrooms with the onion before stirring into the batter.
They were very good as is, but still a bit bland for my taste, so next time I would add more herbs, probably basil, garlic chives- and up the mushrooms/onions. 
I topped with fresh marinara and parmesan- love the quickness and ease of this recipe, it's a keeper- my bf who doesn't care for zukes loved it!  I only got 6 cakes out of the recipe, we ate all of them!

I was making zucchini breads so I just kept grating and made these for dinner.  My 11 year old wouldn't eat them, but my husband and I liked them.  I fried in a combo of oil and butter.  Mine stayed together fine and I didn't alter the recipe.  I tried with sour cream and liked them that way too.  PS- Had a few for lunch the next day cold, and liked them even more.  (Maybe I'm weird)

These were great - easy to make, and my whole family loved them.  The cheese gives them a bit of extra holding power - I'd consider serving them for dinner as a main course without meat.

Extremely tasty!  I found, like others, that the zucchini should be salted and the moisture squeezed out prior to adding other ingredients.  Next time, I will add less flour in order to get crispier patties. I may add some fresh chives, too.   My husband HATES squash of any kind, but ate these and was talking about "next time"!  Great recipe!

Very tasty.  Substituted half of flour with panko and salted/drained zucchini as other reviewers suggested.  Added a couple cloves of garlic, some chopped parsley and basil, and topped half with marinara sauce and half with a sour cream/yogurt/dill sauce.

I did not enjoy these.  The flavor of the zucchini was hidden and it reminded me of a pancake, instead of a flavorful way to utilize garden fresh zucchini.

After grating the zucchini, I lightly salted and let it sit in a colander for about an hour. Then, I squeezed out the liquid. I didn't have mozzarella, so I used parmesan and cheddar. After frying, I sprinkled some parmesan on top. Nice recipe.

Made some changes, but turned out pretty good! Used seasoned bread crumbs instead of flour and increased the egg to make sure everything held together. I also made some homemade marinara sauce for dipping, which went great.

These are one of my favorite new things to make.  My daughter and I go crazy over them!  The only change I make is due to taste preference and that is using mozz and co-jack cheeses.  Love it!!  Yummy!!

YUM!!!   I'm eating these as I type and they are fabulous.  As other reviewers suggested, I added some more flavor.  I replaced half of the flour with seasoned breadcrumbs, plus 1 tbs minced garlic, 1 tbs rosemary, and 1/2 tsp fresh grated pepper.  Serve it up with warm marinara sauce and you're in heaven.

I was disappointed in these.  I was very excited to try them but they really needed some spices/flavoring.  They just tasted pretty bland.

Great recipe!!!  I drained the liquid out of the zucchini and salted it  first as other reviewers suggested.  Also, if your batter is not frying up - if it is a mess resembling scrambled eggs - add more flour.  I did and they fried up beautifully!  Also added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, but I think it still taste wonderful without it.

These were good except they tasted a lot like a fried egg, and were a tad bland.   I might use a more flavorful cheese like smoked gouda next time.  Overall, they were good, and with a few small changes, I would make these again.

This is a great way to use zucchini. I did as other reviewers said and added fresh pressed garlic and italian. I also salted and let the zucchini drain in a collander.   The kids LOVED it with marinara as a dipping sauce. Thank you for the great recipe!

Yummy!  I added chopped red pepper, some herbs and used basil and garlic flavored olive oil for cooking.  Topped it with some homemade marninara.  Tasted a lot like eggplant parmesan to us.  Would be great with angel hair pasta.  We choose fresh broccoli, sliced tomatoes with cottage cheese and a fresh ear of corn.  Made a beautiful presentation.  My husband said he could eat this on a regular basis.  I substituted spelt flour for those of you allergic to wheat.

I love the concept of this recipe.  I used sharp cheddar and an italian cheese blend (because I don't like parmesan too much), and I wonder if that made it too oily.  Next time, I will probably use the parmesan and/or use Pam or bake it.  I also added mushrooms and additional seasoning to add flavor.

Pretty good; could have used some more spices or something...  Fairly easy to make and I got to use my grater, measuring cutting board, and chop wizard so I was happy!  Served with tomato sauce.  Definitely an option if you have way too much zucchini!

Love these!!! Excellent recipe and versatile, too! They are great as is, but better to drain zucchini. I add 1/4 cup chopped green pepper and 1 tsp. minced garlic, then cook in olive oil.  I made a quick creamy sauce using 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream and a tsp. of Greek seasoning. Really good; next time I will try marinara sauce.

Absolutely awesome! I drained zucchini and added 1 tsp of garlic powder and they were wonderful.  I also fried them in a large skillet with some spray margerine and they were perfect.  I thought they tasted awesome with the sour cream.  YUMMY!

DELICIOUS!  This recipes was great.  The flavor pops out of these patties.  The only thing I would change is reducing the frying temp, mine browned way too quickly not giving the inside time to set.  I will most definitely use this recipe again and again.

TASTED AMAZING... they really are great. I had some zucchini to use up in the garden and what a great way to eat zucchini. I made it exactly the way the recipe said, then I served mine with "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" off this web site and topped with Parmesan Cheese. My family just ate them up. They are very tasty.. I don't know how many more ways I can say it.

These are excellent.  I used bread crumbs instead of flour and did not use onion, because I didn't have any on hand.  I ate these with marinara.  Will definitely make again.

Made these for dinner tonight and they turned out great.  Did add the bread crumbs as suggested in other reviews, but other than that I left the recipe alone.  My roommate added a dollop of sour cream right before she ate and said that it just added to the great taste.  I paired them up with some Spanish Rice and had a wonderful meal.  Will definitely make these again.

This is a different and tasty way to prepare zucchini. It would make a nice appetizer or side dish.  I used my salad spinner to get out some of the excess water.

These were fantastic. I have been trying to find a recipe for these for a while my Great Grandma used to make them and I had the recipe with no measurements and just couldn't tweak it. Thank you! My 9 year old son loved them too which is a rare thing. He is actually requesting them now on a regular basis and fortunately they are easy enough to make to accomodate his request often.

These are delicious.  The entire family loved them and asked for more.  We ate them plain- did not feel like we needed any type of dipping sauce because they are moist on the inside.

These are so good! I think next time I will try baking them to try and 'health' them up a bit. I did use instant mashed potato flakes in place of the bread crumbs like some reviews suggested and I also let the salted shredded zucchini sit in a colander for an hour or so to 'drain'. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious. Easy. Full of Veggies--just what I was looking for.  Like all good allrecipes. cooks I had to tweak it a bit--used 2 different kinds of summer squash instead of zucchini and added a tomato and some green onion. Also used a quick chop instead of the grater.  Turned out great.  My 13 month old is gobbling them up and my hubby said it reminded him of hashbrowns and is the only way he has every really liked patty pan squash.

This is a wonderful way to put zucchini to use.  You do have to press the liquid out of the grated zucchi in order to get a nice thick batter.  These were great with salsa on top.  I did grate in one clove of garlic and added about 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.

yum-o! Loved these! I am the only one in the house who will even eat zucchini and this is a great way to use it!! I tweaked it a little bit-- added some garlic, black pepper and diced up a about 1/2 a jalapeno and tossed that in the mix for some added pizazz! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made these many times and absolutely love them, but after I grate the zucchini I put it in a piece of cheese cloth to sqeeze as much liquid as possible, I also grate my onions instead of chopping them. I omit the mozzerella cheese and add dill weed. Mmmm mmmmm oh sooooo good!

Excellent basic recipe.  I served this topped with sour cream and applesauce, as we thought it was bland as prepared.  With added toppings it works!  I thought the addition of a stronger flavored cheese with the mozzarella would help, or something to spice it up (garlic, herbs de provence, etc).  Medium heat on my gas stove was a bit too hot.  I would lower the heat to medium low to allow the center to cook a bit more.  Good recipe!

Wonderful!  My 5 year old even likes. I eyed the ingredients and used shredded cheddar (because that is what I had) instead of mozzarella. They were great. Next time I will come up with something for more crunch.

these are great, although I did use shredded swiss and gruyere instead of mozzarella, skipped the salt and used about 1/4 tsp of pepper

Well this was good, but nothing exceptional – a little bland.  However, I’m not going to give up on this one, because I like that it’s a little bit different way to eat zucchini.  I’m always looking for something out of the ordinary, so our meals don’t become boring.  So, I will definitely try this one again, but I’ll try to jazz it up, so it would be more to our liking.  I agree that a marinara sauce, or the like, would be good with this, but I also think a mustard sauce or aioli of some kind might be good also.  Hmmmmm, I just may have to work on that!

Very fast, flexible (shred and use whatever veggies you like), and tasty. I've made this recipe about 6 times now, using zuke and whatever other veggies I have on hand. I also add lots of sharp cheddar cheese and cook until outside of patties are a little crispy My family (including 1 and 3 year old boys) loves them...even my hubby who hates vegetables.

These are ok.  Sort of bland.  I drained mine in a colander in the sink but they still came out pretty soggy.  Served them with bleu cheese dressing.

They were good, however I probably should have used more cheese!  Instead of chopping the onion, I grated it with the zucchini, with our bumper crop of zucchini, I definitely will make these again!!!

WOW.  the whole family loved it!  i used R. Ray's trick for frozen spinach of putting all the shredded zucch in a dish towel and twisted to drain.  did the 1 tbs flour and then used the ital. breadcrumbs.  sauteed the onion with a bunch of fresh garlic for a few minutes.  added red pepper flakes and served with an over-easy egg on top for breakfast.  this will become a regular, esp. in the summer when we have tons of zucch from the garden!  its a keeper!

Delicious! I followed some of the other reviewer's advice and substituted bread crumbs for some of the flour and added two cloves of chopped garlic. They are great w/ sour  cream or red sauce. We are big fans and will definitely be making these again!

OMG!...I made these. and we just loved them. My husband dont like zucchini and he didntknow what they were, tried a bite and said they were really good what are they?  lol I made mine simple, squeezed all the water out after i shredded my zucchini. chopped a small onion added seasoning, garlic powder, lemon pepper and celery salt. about 4 tbsp or 5 of flour, was going to use bread crumbsbut was out, going to try it that way next time. One egg slightly beaten. They were still kinda moist but good enough to scoop up and lay into the skillet then i took my fork and flattened them. Med heat, and turned them over when they were a nice golden crispy brown and all i can say is yum yum yum!!! Our new favorite...Mix it up a lil, maybe green and red bell pepper . So many options..Enjoy people

these patties were awesome. I did add some cayenne pepper, ginger-chili paste to suit my Indian taste. only had sharp cheddar on hand, and it worked fine. thanks to all the reviewers who suggested to squeeze and drain the zucchini, I wouldn't have liked it if it was soggy. thanks again for the wonderful recipe. next time I'll make these with chick pea flour and skip the eggs so that I can share with my vegetarian friends.

These were WONDERFUL!! I added 1 cup crushed bread crumbs and a little italian seasoning. Next time I think i'll add a little Cayenne pepper. My kids gave these a 7 out of 5!! BONUS! We served them on thin hamburger buns with a little avocado and tomato on top. YUM!!

Overall, this recipe was good. I had a hard time finding the right amount of olive oil to fry these in. Too much made them too greasy, and too little made them burn. The taste was good, both fresh and cold. Applesauce on top added a little extra kick. I made these two weekends in a row which was overkill, so I would have to limit making these to special occasions.

I thought these patties had great flavor, but were a little more like a pancake than I had hoped for. I was looking for more of a hash brown/crab cake consistency, but they were very doughy instead. Next time I think I'll omit 2 of the eggs and see what happens. Overall a good recipe though!

UPDATE: made these again using only one egg and got a much better hash-browny texture. Definitely a keeper!

I did as other reviewers recommended and squeezed out the excess liquid from the zucchini before mixing.  I added a bit more spice and they turned out great!

Really good!! After reading the reviews I did what others said.   salted and wrung out the zucchini - added a bit more once wrung out to bulk up the dish. 1/4 cup flour 2 annehiem peppers diced for heat  Fresh parsley diced 1/2 large onion 5 cloves garlic pepper  (cheese wise i used what was on hand - shredded "Mexican/Jack blend" and freshly grated Parm.)   mixed everything then made patties and rolled them in italian bread crumbs.   Heated the pan, added a little olive oil to coat the pan then cooked them till brown.   Served with fat free sour cream & choula hot sauce.   We also tried it with a sundried tomato pesto.. but that didnt taste as good.   **Although yummy - it did make quite a bit of mess for such a simple dish. I am going to play with it a bit more.. needs a few more spices or something to make it outstanding.

Oh, my. These are so good. After reading some reviews I added some seasoned italian bread crumbs, 3 eggs instead of 2, garlic, red pepper flakes, and about 1/4-1/2 c. instant mashed potato flakes. Decreased flour to 1/4 c. Also added some cheddar cheese (along w/ the other cheeses). Excellent!

These were really good.  I don't like using eggs so I used flax seed with water and I thought they came out great.  I thought they were going to fall apart in the pan when flipping but they stayed together.  This is definitely a great way to make zucchini in a different way.  I will be making these again.

I used tips from previous reviews and these were delicious!  I used potato flakes instead of flour and added a little bruchetta topping to the finished patties and served with Quinoa Tabbouleh (from this site).  Definitely a keeper!

This was good - I had some problems with the first batch in sticking to the pan, so they weren't really patties. I had to had a lot more oil than I would have preferred for the 2nd batch to work. It was good  but I wasn't astounded, so I might keep looking.

I've been making something like this for years called "Pizza Squash"; only without the mozzarella but more like 3/4 cup grated parmesan, and I use about 4 cups of shredded zucchini, and used finely grated onion, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1/4 tsp ground thyme for seasoning, and I use closer to 1 cup of flour or until about the consistency of biscuit dough.  I brown them in 1 T of margarine with 1 T of olive oil.  This makes a lot but the leftovers are even better!

I grew up eating my Italian Mother & Grandmother's squash patties! Draining the salted, grated, zucchini in a colander (use a heavy weight on top of a plate) for several hours is a must! Use lots of grated romano cheese, salt, pepper and granulated garlic for a nice flavor (red pepper flakes are optional). I use a scant 1/4 cup measure to scoop the batter and flatten slightly once in  the hot oil (always use light olive oil) so they are not too thick and cook through. I even sprinkle very lightly with kosher salt or more grated romano immediately after removing from the olive oil and placing on paper towel to drain.

These were pretty good, I'd rate it five stars but mine turned out to be a little too raw in the middle even after cooking them for a while (maybe I made them too thick. I'm not sure if thats how they're supposed to be) but they were still tasty. They remind me of potato pancakes but the zucchini is nice change.

Definitely enjoyed this recipe.  Agree with other members it did a bit more spices but after jazzing it up it was great.  I tried making these all three way, baking, frying in oil and then frying with just pam.  Mine and my husbands favorite was baking.  I baked them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet at 400 and then flipped them once the top got a little brown.  Good luck to all and enjoy.

Very tasty!   Used cheddar since I did not have mozzarella.  I will also be sure to sprinkle the zucchini with salt to drain the excess water-they took longer than a few minutes per side to set, I'm assuming it's because they were a little too moist.  My hubby raved and raved about them.  A keeper.   Spanks!  :-)

I had a few zucchinis I needed to cook up and I saw this recipe.  The ingredients are simple and most people have them on hand.  I, too, added garlic and a few other misc spices in my cabinet.  I took the advice of other reviewers and dredged the patties in bread crumbs.  They were crispy and very tasty. Even my 15 month old twins liked them.  Both my husband and I agree that they need some sort of dipping sauce to accompany them.

Not bad. I think next time I will do without the mozzarella cheese. I sort of wished they were crispier. But I will attempt these again with those changes.

These were amazing! They had been tossed around the RE for a while and I thought they would be a good way to use up my abundance of zukes and boy was I right! My husband loved them but said he'd like to have bread crumbs added next time. We are also going to try them with yellow squash. Thanks for great recipe that I'll be making over and over again!

Love these!! Best way to use up abundant zucchini of summer. I added lots of minced garlic, some finely chopped fresh basil and parsley, a good shot of hot pepper sauce and subbed cheddar for the mozzarella.  If you draine them really well, they are great cold the next day.

These were good... not great.  They definitely reminded me of a potatoe cake.  I was hoping that they would be flavorful enough to not need marinara and that the zucchini would shine through, but in the end we dipped ours as well.

Great recipe and so quick! As another reviewer suggested I used instant potato flakes instead of flour and I really liked the potato flavor it added. Other than that I added a few of my own spices for personal preference. Will definitely make again!

A very good recipe. My family fixed them this evening, substituting one cup of shredded cheddar cheese for the 1/2 cups of parmesan and mozzarella. The taste was phenomenal; it has been saved and we will be making it in the future, albeit with the parmesan and mozzarella (we didn't have mozzarella in the house to use!).

very simple to put together and quick to cook. i added pepper and used oat bran and 2 tablespoons of whole wheat flour in place of white flour. great side dish, or like another review mentioned maybe a whole meal with the addition of marinara sauce! definitely a keeper recipe!!

Very creative, and tasty too! I made it as the main dish for a weeknight veggie dinner, and I served it with homemade marinara sauce, garlic breadsticks from a local bakery, a tomato and mozzarella salad, and a green salad. Given that I surrounded it with an Italian theme, I will most like add garlic and possibly Italian seasoning when I make it again. Thanks for contributing this--it's definitely unique, easy, and yummy.

These were pretty good but a little bland in flavor.  Next time, I'll add more seasonings, maybe some additional cheeses.  I will definitely use the potato flakes rather than bread crumbs and flour as I did this time.  I think that will make the texture much better and the patties delicious!

YUM! i took a chance on this recipe and seved it at a big dinner party recieving excellent reviews. I also substituted potato flakes, used a bit more zucchini and onion, and dried the zucchini first (as recommended by other reviews).  I also served it with marinara sauce - a wonderful companion here! I will definately be making this again!

I used yellow squash since it is what I had on hand, and added garlic salt in place of regular salt.  I really liked the flavor!  But I think I will turn the heat lower and make the patties thinner next time--the outside was crispy, but the inside was squishy and a little unpleasant.  Overall, very tasty.

So yummy! I made it as the recipe was written, but added just a tiny bit of cayenne pepper, and prepared them on a hot griddle with cooking spray (no oil), cooked up nice and brown.

We quite liked these.  We made them with almost none of the cheese as we did not consider that necessary and wanted the flavour of the zucchini to come through.  Added some chili flakes for lift and these were very good as a different veggie side.

These definitely needed some spices for flavor. Other than that they were pretty simple and tasty. Not one of my family's favs though.

These were sooo good! Instead of 1/2 c of flour I used 1/4 c seasoned bread crumbs and 1/4 c flour. These were so yummy. Everyone enjoyed them!

I agree with other reviewers, garlic, pepper and parsley made a big difference in the flavor. The original recipe was good but a little bland, but adding the other ingredients, gave it a more rounded flavor. I also added a half teaspoon of sugar and that made the patty taste similar to fried squash blossoms. I will definitely make this again.

This is a keeper! Excellent, delicious, moist, cheesy! You could easily serve these at breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect.  YUMMY!

Very good...We had them for dinner and dipped them in marinara sauce.  Would make a great appetizer too.  My almost 1 year old liked them surprisingly, and my 3 year old ate them up!  Like others, I substituted 1/4 c. seasoned bread crumbs for 1/4 c. of the flour, and added a clove of minced fresh garlic and pepper.   I got impatient waiting for the zucchini to dry out in the collander and just squeezed it by hand instead.  I fried the patties in olive oil instead of vegetable for flavor and flattened them out a bit in the pan as they were cooking.  I ended up with 7 and it was just enough for me and my 2 kids :)  I'll double it next time if my husband is eating too!  Oh, and next time I'd try adding some diced mushrooms to the mixture.

I added a ton of fresh pressed garlic and Italian bread crumbs and these were so wonderful. We ate them with marinara sauce on top. The kids didn't know it was zucchini, they thought it tasted like ravioli and ate it up.

oh my god these were soooooooo good!!.. I didnt think they would be such a hit, i added some pepper and garlic powder and only used mozarrella cheese.. sooo good! also, i used 3 eggs, 3 cups zuccini, 3/4 cups flour and 1 1/4 cup cheese. I had 12 patties the size of those you see in the pictures.. great recipe! no need to drain the zuccini, mine was pretty dry anyway.. but if you have excess liquid i would drain

The ease, quickness and taste of this recipe make it a 5 star. I think that they are actually pretty tasty and not bland at all. But if you add ketchup (like my 2 year old insisted), they then did seem fairly bland. 

I added a small clove of garlic and a cup of fresh parmesan rather than half parmesan and half mozzarella, simply as that's what I had. I'm sure it would be easy to vary ingredients to change things up. Thank you!

My first time to leave a rating on any recipe, but felt I had no choice.  These are YUMMY!!!  Only change I did due to not having the other cheeses, was to use pre-shredded Taco Blend cheese and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  Perfect for that Sunday Morning Brunch!

If I could I would give this 3.5.  They had good flavor, but were too eggy.  I didn't have flour, so I tried breadcrumbs.  Maybe with flour they would be less eggy, so it is worth trying again with flour.  We had them with hot sauce-mayo combo and it was a nice compliment.

These were so tasty and not heavy at all!   didn't drain squash, added jane's crazy salt, shredded parm cheese, mozzerella and cooked on a griddle sprayed w/ pam and a tad drizzle of olive oil!   Big appetizer hit!  mixed FF sour cream w/ some chives, "hot spicey" seasoning.   excellent!

By far the best recipe I've tried for all that darned zucchini!  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were perfect.  I felt the urge to tweak, but stopped myself.  We couldn't stop eating them.  I see getting a lot of requests for these in the future.  Oh and, for the record, I think that salting the zucchini and drawing out the moisture is a mistake.  It would leave them too dry.

These were good!  A different way to eat up the zucchini.  We ate them with chunky marinara sauce.  I used 1/2 bread crumbs, 1/2 flour and fried them in olive oil.

This is a great simple recipe which can be modified and enhanced in many ways.  As other reviews mentioned you should try to extract as much liquid from the zucchini as possible before mixing with the other ingredients.  If you don't have enough people to eat the whole recipe at one meal, just put the batter in the fridge.  A day or two later you can make them again and maybe add a new twist as I did by adding some fried sausage bits or whatever leftover cooked meat you have on hand.  Herbs are a good addition too, I added fresh basil to mine.

Very good! If you pick your zucchini fresh from the garden at about five or six inches, there is no need to drain b4 cooking. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

This is a great base recipe... I married into an Italian family so I added my twist to it and hubby loves it. Instead of using flour I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I also used my fresh zucchini out of my garden so grated I got 6 cups of zucchini.. and I only use 4-5 eggs instead of 6 I went with a more dryer mixture so it wasn't so cake like and you can really taste the zucchini. My girls loved this too.. my 8 year old hates zucchini but LOVED this (with ketchup...LOL)

I got a very similar favorite recipe from a friend that has chopped banana peppers and no mozzarella. I think maybe they would be too melty with mozzarella. I do not drain the zucchini either. If you want more flavor the peppers may be what that missing ingredient is for you. I also use red onion. They are so colorful & tasty. Great recipe!!

Delicious.  A good way to serve zucchini.  I followed the recipe exact and fried them until they were very brown and crispy.  I ate them with sour cream and pica de gallo, but my husband liked them plain, without the extras.

This was a waste and a disaster.  I really wanted these to be as wonderful as they sound.  I made exactly as recipe states, added some garlic powder and used onion powder instead of onion.  The patties stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I used two different pans and two different heats.  They didn't work either way.  I also used veggie oil with one batch and olive oil with another batch. I wish I could have made these work, but I won't do this one again.  Cleaning both my pots is going to be a bugger.

Excellent vegetarian recipe, high in protein. To lighten up the fat content, I used 1/4 cup grated asiago, 1/2 cup fat-free shredded mozzarella, and 1/2 cup organic egg whites. I grated both 1 med zucchini and 1 med vidalia, squeezing out much of the liquid. I used 1/2 cup organic whole grain pastry flour, and 1/2 tsp Crazy Jane's Mixed-up salt. The yield was 12 2 1/2-3" pancakes. We enjoyed these as a main course with salad, homemade applesauce, french bread and a crisp Pinot Gris. Better than a restaurant! Having worked in the restaurant business 30 years, I know what goes on behind the scenes, and with a good recipe, quality ingredients, and good company, it's almost always better at home. 'Specially for vegetarians. Thanks, Sherlie! Will be using this recipe often.

As others suggested, I squeezed out excess water from squash. I used 1 green and 1 yellow squash, added some garlic, used some cilantro that I had. These were yummy!

I have never had a zucchini patty before and wanted to try something new so I gave this recipe a try.  I followed it exactly and they were delicious.  I did follow the other reviews and did squeeze out the excess water from the zucchini.  These were so easy to make and they went great with the Marinara Sauce II from this site.  Both my husband my two toddlers loved them.  I will make this again.  Maybe next time I'll add some different veggies or cheese but they are great as is.

I make these all the time and as some other reviewers suggested, I use baking mix instead of flour. It adds a little saltiness and richness to the flavor and makes them even better. I also fry them in butter instead of oil -- it makes them a little less healthy, but just that much tastier;)  Another tip is to make sure you beat the egg nice and fluffy before adding to the other ingredients. This makes the patties themselves lighter and fluffier. This is my go-to quick recipe (provided I have the ingredients on hand), my husband and I love them!

I followed another reviewers' advice and added 1/4 c. mashed potato flakes to the recipe.  I also sauteed the onions in olive oil before adding to the mix.  And, I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter (about 2 Tbsp. each for the whole recipe, doubled) instead of regular veg. oil.  They were fabulous.  Plain, or served with marinara, we loved them.  Great recipe!

It's amazing!They tasted just like potato pancakes.They were great with sour cream.I made the mixture a few hours before cooking and stored it in the fridge and when I took it out it looked a bit watery but they still tasted good.Even my sister liked them and she usually doesn't eat anything vegetarian.I will definitely make these again.

If you are trying to sneak more veggies into your family's diet, this may help!  I don't care for zucchini, and I liked these. My 14 month old son loved them also.  As suggested by others, I did add more seasoning - pepper, seasoned salt, italian seasoning.  I also used 1/2 flour and 1/2 potato flakes. I didn't have enough mozzarella, so I threw in a couple handfuls of Cheddar. It's all good!  I can see this is a very versatile recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe was amazing!  I followed another rater's suggestion and used 1/2 cup potato flakes instead of flour, and the texture was great and really held together.  I also used 1/2 cup feta cheese instead of mozzerella, and the taste was fantastic!! Will definately make again, maybe next time I'll add some spinach?

I got the best results cooking over a medium heat and really babied them in the pan. I added some bread crumbs to about half of the mix to see if it would improve the consistancy while cooking and it did. I thought it also improved the taste too.

I grated the onions just like the zucchini, I think it blends better that way.  I doubled the batch and as they cooled I kept tasting them and then adding seasonings to the batter to make them tastier.  The first ones were a little bland without the additions.  I added lots of pepper and salt, garlic powder, paprika, italian seasoning, cumin and chili powder.  Then they were delicous.  My kids ate them with a little pizza sauce on them, I don't even think they knew they were eating vegetables.

This is so easy to make and tastes great.    It works as a good vegetarian main dish if you serve with salad, etc. I used garlic flavored olive oil to cook them, which added even more flavor.

These were very light and tasty.  I did alter the recipe a little bit.  I used 1 med. zucchini and 1 med. summer squash and I squeezed a lot of water out of them.  Added a 1/4 C. of breadcrumbs instead of flour, garlic powder, 1 egg and 1/4 C cheddar cheese as it was all I had on hand.  I got 4 palm sized patties out of this - note to self, use bigger pan next time as the patties got pretty misshapen will I was flipping them.  I cooked them about 5 minutes each side over medium heat for a nice golden color.

I had no idea zucchini could taste so good! I did change the recipe a bit but the spirit remained. I used a mix of yellow and zucchini squash and added a banana pepper and jalapeno as another reviewer since I have tons of those in my garden too. I used a third to half the cheese - a combo of cheddar and parm. Also added chopped garlic, cayenne pepper and chili powder, and fried up using cooking spray. Delicious plain!

Great recipe!  I added 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning to give it some zip.  Also added garlic powder and onion powder.  Will try Cajun or taco seasoning in the future.  As another reviewer stated, this is a very forgiving recipe.  I used about 3 cups of zucchini, and replaced the flour with bread crumbs and a tablespoon of flour.  Used parmesan cheese & a shredded taco cheese blend.  The key is to squeeze the excess liquid out of the zucchini -- first by hand, then by wringing it in a clean dishtowel.

I would actually give it 3 and a half stars. It's simple and very easy to make. I just feel like something is missing with it. But I will try it again and maybe modify a little.

These were fantastic! What a great way to help use up some of the zucchini in the garden. I took the recipe to work with me, and everybody there wanted a copy of it. I did add garlic to them, and I had a little bit of grated co-jack cheese from the night before that I threw in. We loved them...even my dear BF ate them, and he does not like zucchini at all! Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved these.  Instead of zucchini, I used a really large crookneck squash, which are out of control in my garden.  I chopped up the squash in the food processor and ended up with a little over 2 cups.  I didn't find the recipe watery at all.  I also added a little bit of extra onion and monterey jack cheese.  Will definitely make again.

I thought these were really tasty.  I don't think that they can REPLACE the vegetable on your dinner plate, but they certainly tasted wonderful.  Very easy to make.  I'll try them again, experimenting with ways to make them a bit healthier.

I've made these several times, and every time I do they're a hit.  As soon as I fry them up, they disappear!  Living in rural Virginia, we are lucky to have access to wonderful produce, and this is a great way to use up zucchini.  The only thing I would suggest is putting your grated zucchini in a clean dish towel, and wringing it out thouroughly before adding the other ingredients.  This prevents your mixture from becoming too watery.  The recipe is also very forgiving.  We luuvvvvvv cheese, so I tend to go a little heavy on the Parmesan and mozzarella, and it really doesn't matter.  This is a wonderful recipe that I will continue making for years to come.  Thank you, Sherlie!

I haven't tried this recipe exactly but it is similar to my mother's. The trick to getting a non-watery patty cooked through is to heat the skillet on med-high until a drop of batter browns quickly (like pancakes), then drop the patties. Once the pattie has formed with a good base, turn down the heat to med-low and let them brown slowly, so the middle has enough time to cook. I use no-stick spray instead of oil and I always spray again before flipping (flip only once, after the bottom is golden brown). My recipe is sans onion, using 1/3 c. Jiffy Mix (or Bisquick) instead of flour, with 1/3 c. parmesan and no motzeralla. I also add a clove of crushed garlic. I'll try it this way soon.

Overall, pretty good, but I think it needs a little tweaking.  I used corn flake crumbs instead of flour.  I also added a lot of garlic and black pepper.  Next time, I'll play around with the corn flake crumbs--I know they need some glue to make them stick together, but I don't think corn flake crumbs or flour or breadcrumbs are the answer.  I'm thinking of mashing a cup of zucchini next time and using that as the glue to hold the shredded zucchini together.  This will give it more of a zucchini taste, which is what I was hoping for in the recipe!

I really wanted to like these.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and was disappointed.  I tried again making changes other reviewers suggested, such as breadcrumbs instead of flour and adding spices, but I was still underwhelmed.  My husband ate them, but told me not to bother saving the leftovers.  The kids wouldn't eat more then one.  I guess this just isn't to our tastes.

Well, I made 'Connie's Zucchini 'Crab' Cakes' yesterday, and I have to say that 'Zucchini Patties' get my winning vote. The cheese is absolutely perfect! I also added a little freshly ground black pepper. Delicious! Thanks so much!

Wow, my husband couldn't get enough of these (though when I was making them, he was wrinkling his nose)! I found that leftover batter stored well in the fridge for a few days, it seemed easier than trying to reheat already-cooked patties.

These patties are delicious! I didn't have an onion on hand, so I added extra zucchini and used a garlic-peper blend in lieu of black pepper. Your guests (and family) will think that you've spend a lot of time on these, but they are simple to make and are a great addition to grilled chicken or fish. Simply wonderful!

Next time I make this, I'll reduce the mozarella by 1/4 c, add  some herbs (herbes de provence or a combination oregano/thyme), and spice it up a bit with some garlic chili pepper.

I liked these okay, but my husband was not a fan.  They were a little too greasy for me and he didn't like the fact that they stayed so mushy and runny on the inside after frying.  I thought about cooking them longer, but then the outsides would have been burned.  On the other hand, I didn't want to waste the leftover batter so I poured it into a greased casserole and baked it at 350 for about 40 minutes.  It turned out pretty well, though still not great.  However, I think that it would be an excellent (and cheaper) filling for a quiche.  Just pour it into a pie shell and then bake it until set.

I liked the taste of these patties, although they were a little bland.  They taste a lot like the potato pancakes I make, and my husband was surprised that these were made with zucchini but didn't have an overwhelming zucchini taste.  My toddler (who recently started boycotting all vegetables) really liked them with ketchup.  I was suprised that I couldn't really taste the cheese even though there is a lot of it.  Next time I will make these with some sharp cheddar and serve them as a side for an egg breakfast.

Wow - these were good - and rich. Was intending to have them as a side dish but we just ate them off the plate as they were cooling. Don't know why someone else had a problem with the texture; I thought they were just right. No adjustments needed!

Thank you for this yummie, quick dish.  Normally I scale down a recipe to feed two however these are so good that we keep it at four servings...we still wanted more!  We are vegetarians, so this is a great little dish that is quick to make, you should rethink the name of them because we kept saying mmmmm and yummmm during dinner last night!

After reading all the wonderful reviews I feel badly to write one not quite so wonderful but I think it may help someone.  The taste of the patty is delicious (what fried, cheese-filled food do you know of that isn't delicious?), however, the consistency of the batter was extremely hard to work with 'causing my patties to be less than appealing to look at.  Perhaps I am at fault for using the small grater holes, but the recipe said "grated" and I grated them finely which may have been a problem.

This was a tasty use of extra zucchinni out of the garden.  The recipe looked a little bland, so I "kicked it up a notch" with about a tablespoon of minced garlic, and a chopped serrano pepper.  Also, I used cheddar as I didn't have mozzarella on hand.  Will make again!

Delicious. I used marinara sauce as suggested, and added some Old Bay seasoning as suggested. I omitted the salt, but kept everything else the same. This made a few more than 12 patties, but some of mine were small. This was actually pretty easy to throw together and we ate it with garlic bread.

Great for a snack or for a side dish with a light dinner!
Very easy to make, and I loved the parmesan in it.
They're a little plain on their own, so I recommend eating it with the tomato sauce as suggested, or salsa.

this is great even as an appitizer, but you may need a little more flour so you can get thicker patties, a pinch or two, but add it in slowly and after every thing is mixed so you can see it's consistancy

Very good... did add 1 tsp Old Bay and 1 garlic clove, minced.  Served with sour cream dill sauce (sour cream, fresh dill and lemon juice). My husband who hates zucchini said "surprisingly good."
I cannot imagine adding CANNED salmon to this like the previous poster... these were good on their own.

Exquisite!!   Thank You for this one.  I followed your exact directions for the recipe.  The only change I made , was instead of using  oil in the pan, I used pam cooking spray. Topped with sour creme as suggested.  MMMM  MMMM  Good!!The next time, I will try with cheddar cheese as some have suggested, just to mix it up a bit. A Great way to fix zuchinni.

I followed this recipe with a cpl of changes. I used monterey jack instead of mozzarella and also added chopped fresh garlic. I really didn't care for the texture. I won't be making this again.

Super duper fantastic! We enjoyed this simple and delicious dish as a main course (we're vegetarians) with a scoop of sour cream on the side. YUM! Our picky mac-and-cheese lovin' 3-year old even had seconds! Thank you, Sherlie! This is a real winner!

so good!!  i used cooking spray instead of oil to make it healthier and it was delicious.  i would recommend cooking longer on a lower heat so they don't get too brown.

This is a fast and easy recipe.  The patties are even good cold...we ate them right out of the refrigerator the next day.  I also recommend using Hellmann's Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce on top, the flavor compliments the zucchini perfectly!  I will definitely be making this again.

A huge family hit!!  So simple and absolutely delicious.  They were gone less than 5 minutes after I made them.  Even my 19 year old son (who would rather walk over hot coals than eat zucchini) went for seconds...and thirds.  Way to go Sherlie!!

Excellent tasting patties.  With minimal ingredients it makes a great side dish as well as uses up your summer zuccini.

These patties were excellent!!!!  I did make a couple of adjustments as I am doing the low fat low carb thing......I used whole wheat flour, reduced fat mozzarella and pan spray instead of oil.  We dipped them into spaghetti sauce and even my picky picky kids took a few bites!!!!!
I will be making these again and again, perhaps switching the cheeses to change the taste some!!!

Oh my, these were awesome!  My husband just raved and raved! The whole family loved them. I served them alongside sweet italian chicken sausages (Shaw's Supermarket brand), and what a great dinner.  I have more zucchini, and I just might make more today as we're camping this weekend and these would make a yummy side dish that I can reheat on the griddle.

This is a great recipe!  I use Bisquick instead of flour and cheddar cheese for the mozzarella.  I also recommend adding a bit of cayenne pepper, which makes it spicy and flavorful.

These were very good. I used whole wheat flour instead and also added a little onion powder. Excellent way to use up some of the zucchini from my garden.

Tasty!  I omited the mozzerella cheese and these were still very good. I liked the suggestion of draining the zucchini.  I think these would be a great breakfast alternative!

Great recipe!  Perhaps a bit on the cheesy side.  I could imagine using less cheese to bring out more of the zucchini taste and take away some of the fat.

Excellent. We substituted yellow squash for the zucchini, and it still was wonderful. Maybe next time we will try different cheeses. Highly recommended.

This Recipe is AWESOME - I was determined to find a way to make zucchini (besides bread) that my family would enjoy - This was FANTASTIC - my 10 yr. old did pick out the small diced onions, but liked it otherwise and my hubby and I thought they were AMAZING!!  THANKS for Sharing this one!

Great recipe, was a big hit.  Like others, I recommend getting as much of the water out of the zucchini as possible, and letting it sit in the frig for a bit.  I even added 50% to the recipe, and there were still not enough.

Unexpectedly AMAZING!  I did have to turn my heat down some from what was called for, but they turned out great! Quickly became one of my and my husband's favorites, and he is not a big veggie eater. I highly recommend this recipe.

I’ve made these several times and they’re really good and versatile with different herbs. I’ve made them with fresh basil, garlic and Parmesan cheese. I made them tonight and added ginger, garlic, a bit of soy sauce and cilantro, omitted cheese. Ate them with hoisin sauce and fried rice. Yummy!

Pretty good, basically followed the recipe. I did get as much wet out of the zucchini as I could.  Added a bit more seasoning 
And 1/4 cup mozzarella and a 1/4 cup cheddar cheese., and a fresh jalapeño! 
I’ll make them again. I may try and bake them as someone else mentioned

You definitely need to drain and blot off the excess water from the zucchini or else the batter is too wet.  I added almond flour and flax seed powder to the batter to soak up the excess liquid, then dredged it in more almond flour and coconut flour and fried it in coconut oil.  To eat, I dipped it in a dip made of yoghurt, lime juice, salt and a little salsa.  Really yummy.  Next time I probably add mushrooms as someone else suggested.

I had one zucchini and one squash that I had to use before we left on vacation. I followed the recipe exactly except for using one of each veggie. I also grated the veggies and then squeezed out the liquid in them by placing them in a towel an squishing it out. Turned out great! Hubs loved it so much he asked me to make them often.

It turned out great. I added salt to grated zucchini first and let it sit for a while. I squeezed the grated zucchini after so all the moisture came out. Also I added some garlic powder to the mixture.

My husband loves these as did I.  We put marinara and sour cream on them and it tasted like pizza.   He keeps gently reminding me to make them so I'll be adding them as an appetizer at thanksgiving this week.  thanks for the great recipe.  Also I didn't have flour and used a small amount of potato starch and it worked well.

I adjusted recipe to reflect 8 servings. Was short on the zucchini, so added mashed cooked potatoes to make up for it. Also fried the onions with 1 lg. bulb of garlic. Used gluten free flour. Made 21 patties. These are delicious & ate 2 of them, before they made it into my freezer. I will use these for breakfast. Tip: make sure the oil is sizzling hot when you add the patties to fry them. Will def. make them again.

These are very tasty! I had a hard time keeping them from sticking to the pan so I tried a different pan and got a better result. I've tried them with a variety of cheeses like feta, cheddar and manchego and they are always good. Best if you can make them nice a crispy.

This is really good.  A nice way to change up the abundance of this veggie in the fall.  You may have add a bit more flour depending of the consistency you wish for.  I added homegrown garlic in this.  Delicious!   I also baked in oven on parchment paper.

Next time I will use grapeseed oil rather than regular frying oil. They were very good. I served them with maple syrup-yum! They need some kind of spice to kick up the flavor, maybe chilli pepper, not sure. They were kind of wet so next time I will squeeze the zucchini after I grate it. I will make them again and they will be a vegetable favorite, easy to make and tasty. Thank you for the recipe!

Definitely drain and squeeze out some moisture. I reduced the flour to 1/4 cup and added a little fresh garlic.  Cooked them with my waffle iron which is the easiest for zuc or spud pancakes.  Also, less than frying

I’ve made these for years. They were always my hubby’s favorite recipe. I’ve akways used bisquick instead of the flour though. I’ll be making these for my son with a few adjustments. I’ll be adding Swiss cheese and baking them since he has gastroparisis and has trouble digesting certain things along with brittle type one diabetes. I think I’m going to try ground oats and see how it turns out

These were great.  Be sure and add the onion (I forget the first time, but they were still good).

This is so good! I added a little black pepper and about 20 crushed whole wheat Ritz crackers to give it some texture.   This is the kind of recipe you can "shake up" with different cheeses.

So good! I did make some revisions, using Italian bread crumbs rather than flour, adding in some pepper and 2 cloves of minced garlic.

Great idea for zucchini!
As many other reviewers did, we grated the zucchini, stirred in 1/2 t salt, and let it drain in a colander for about 30 minutes. Then we squeezed it out. I added a little cayenne (red) pepper to the mixture, and used chickpea flour instead of regular flour. For a topping, pizza sauce was a great, but a little bit too much; plain yogurt was good. These reminded me of potato pancakes.

Made once as a side dish. My husband love them. Then made them half dollar sized, adding cayenne pepper, as appetizers. Served with salsa, sour cream and ranch dressing as dipping sauces. Big hit. Try cheddar in place of mozzarella to change it up a little bit.

My husband and I liked the flavor and thought it was quite easy to whip up quickly.  It would be a nice side at dinner or a great quick lunch for kids.  Let them dip it in a little mustard, ketchup or mayo and they'll be happy!

4.5 going to experiment with seasonings. Used 1/3 Asiago cheese, 1/3 Havarti cheese, and 1/3 gruyere cheese. Better with toppings. Added salsa verde and sour cream on top.

This recipe was super good. You will need to squeeze out excess liquid from the zucchini, as it extracts so much liquid. I added some garlic and bread crumbs in place of the flour.  Also rolled the patties in bread crumbs to hold them together and it worked out great!

I used my food processor to finely chop the zucchini instead of grating, then salted and drained the mixture & squeezed in a paper towel...I was glad I did  when saw how much liquid I was able to squeeze out!
Instead of flour, I used potato flakes and bread crumbs and added garlic powder plus a seasoning mix. I started out pan frying the patties, but finished baking them in my toaster oven for about 15 min on each side at 375 degrees, like others suggested. 

The patties turned out very crispy and delicious!

I made these a couple times now, the first as-is. The as-is time was good; good consistency, good cheesy flavor. The other time I added in some garlic powder and italian seasonings to give it a little more 'robust' flavor. What I love is that I can call these pancakes and my picky toddler will eat them with honey or syrup on top!

I didn’t have the cheese. But went for it anyway. Added minced garlic and made sure I squeezed all the juice it could. They never got to cool off. They disappeared as they came out of the pan. Yummy.

These are delicious! I made them with kraft grated Parmesan and corn flour. They turned out great and we’re a crowd pleaser!

I am not sure what happened but these were all mush. Zucchini has a lot of liquid in it so I’m not sure why the two eggs were need . Very disappointing I ended up tossing everything. I’m a pretty good cook and follow the recipe so I don’t know what happened

I love these! I was reading in the reviews here that some people were getting mushy centers. So I altered the recipe to strain some of the water from the zucchini after grating it. this I think helped in the cooking and texture of the patty to be dryer and firmer in the center.

Delicious! I wouldn't change a single thing. Sour cream was the perfect topping. I've made enough to make 5. Next time, I'll  make more.  I would make this again and again...

I used bread crumbs , not flour...I sautéed onions & garlic, added garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, red pepper flakes &  a large pinch of salt. I also sautéed mushrooms and squeezed them dry w/ the zucchini. Baked at 400 for 15 , flip, then 400 for 15 min. Note to self , batch made 20 WW points, 6 patties, 4 pts each.   I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

Made this two days ago and it was amazing! My wife loves it. As suggested by other reviewers, I first sprinkled some salt over the grated zucchini and let it sit for awhile. Then I used a teatowel to squeeze access water out. I also used whole wheat flour, added some chilli flakes and used a low-salt mozzarella cheese.

I substituted seasoned salt for plain salt which added some flavor.  The issue was the cakes never set.  I smashed the second batch flat with the spatula and put the lid on the skillet, which helped.  When I make them again, I will let the shredded zucchini drain and press them out before putting them in the batter.

Wonderful! Did not add extra salt felt parm was salty enough. Came out nice and golden brown. Can’t wait to share with the vegetarian in the family. They are really good so I made them again. I started with 1/2 Tbs oil then did not use any more with the nonstick pan.

I added garlic powder and less flower - and a handful of seasoned breadcrumbs. Delicious! 
I find if I grate zucchini early in day and drain in strainer and squeeze excess water before adding to mixture.

try this with gluten free flour instead of wheat flour.  I like American Test Kitchens homemade blend but Dove Farms and King Arthur  blends also work well.

Very delicious. I usually make the recipes exactly as written, but this one I decreased the flour by half and then added 1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs as the substitute. We ate this as a side dish for dinner, and it works great as an appetizer, too.

Yesssss these turned out so good! I didn’t have the right cheese so I used shredded cheddar cheese. They were still good, but I definitely want to try it with the cheeses in the recipe. My husband loved it, my kids demolished them. Should have made some more;)

This is a keeper! I loved it. Only thing I did different at all was used green onions (since they're my fave) and a little more salt and pepper. Will definitely go in the dinner rotation!

I added some leftover corn to the batter. This recipe is so adaptable. I enjoyed reading other cook’s adaptations, and will try the instant potatoes next time. These are good plain, but you can use sauce, sour cream or salsa. Maybe even hummus or guacamole. Endless variations.

Too much onion was the general consensus. Otherwise really good. I dried my shredded zucchini played it a little loosy-goosy with the amounts on doubling when it came to cheese and zucchini but kept everything else at the doubled amounts. Still awesome!

This is one of those versatile recipes - I had more grated zucchini, swapped cheddar for the mozzerella - still delicious. I let them get quite browned and crispy and served with homemade tomato jam. Be sure to squeeze the moisture out of  the zucchini. Good re-heated too. Thanks!

I only had 1/4 c. parmesan cheese.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I made 13 small patties since these are for my daycare toddlers . I baked at 400 for 15 minutes, flipped and baked 5 more minutes

Will make again!  Used recipe + suggestions of garlic, italian seasonings, fresh parsley.  Use 1/2 flour 1/2 breadcrumbs and sprinkled a little breadcrumbs on both sides while cooking. Delish with a little sour cream dollop or plain greek yogurt!

I just used half flour and half panko bread crumbs.  Draining the zucchini didn't seem necessary.  Really good.

Easy to make and a GREAT side dish for Italian meal, tomato sauce goes excellent.  Made a double batch and added basil, oregano, parsley , and a splash of garlic powder.  Passed around  some patties to my neighbor's and they LOVED it.  BTW  if using fresh zucchini , you can shred it ahead and pop it in the freezer.  When you take it out, thaw and drain the water off.

Okay... so other suggested tossing the zucchini with some salt and letting it sit to get rid of some of (a lot of) the moisture.  I didn't do that and regret it.  Mushy, yucky and epic fail.  I'll try again another day and listen to the wisdom of experience.

Made  Zuchini Patties tonight for dinner.  My husband said “Best  zuchini I’ve ever had!”  I had a little leftover chili  so I stirred it into the mix.  Makes enough for company.  Next time I will invite someone over.

The 3 stars has nothing to do with the taste. Never again will I fry into patties. They stuck to my skillet (oiled) with a hard time turning them. But, the taste is great. I will make this recipe again, but I will make it as a casserole. I have no patience. Oh, and I did put salt in to the zucchini and let it set for a while. I drained the liquid , but did not think about that salt would still be there. So, I added more salt, which I do not like. Plus cheese is salty. So account that and your taste. I can picture serving this at a meal as a casserole.

These are absolutely incredible as-is, but I think this recipe will also lend itself well to customization.  Based on a recommendation in the comments, the only thing I did differently was salt the shredded zucchini in a colander and let it drain for 15 minutes while preparing the rest of the ingredients.  Before mixing the zucchini into the other ingredients, I also gave them a final good squeeze to get as much water out as possible.  They browned *very* nicely!

I did not make any changes.

Well, I doubled it if that counts.

Hard to keep up with zucchini season.

Everyone that had these wanted more.

I'm back to the kitchen tonight for another batch.

Yes, it was delicious , i grated the zucchini and put all in a Colander over night . Meanwhile, i put the ingredients together except for the eggs. The next day, mixed everything, and was delicious.. i could not make these the night before, just grate the zucchini , because it felt like 90 degrees in the kitchen...so i waited until the next day... made sense to me.

I have this yesterday, and it's on the menu again tonight!  I followed the recipe except I added a hot banana pepper, finely chopped to disperse the heat. This gave the zucchini patty the pizzazz that I crave. I love this recipe. So glad I found it.

I made this gluten free by substituting gf bread crumbs for the flour.  They were very, very good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I liked this dish.  I would like it even better if the patties were a little firmer.  I will say the patties didn't look great and I was concerned about the taste.  I was happy to find that they tasted much better than they looked.  I plan to make this recipe again.

Perfect in every way! Quick to make, I had already grated 4 big zukes from my garden and so I had that part done, everything else just fell into the bowl. The next day the were great with Tomato Pie from this web site for lunch.

I also made a couple tweaks to the recipe. I did salt (kosher salt) the zucchini and let it sit in the colander to drain. Instead of using chopped onion I used crispy onion straws and crumbled them up and put it in the recipe to add more flavor and of course used a generous amount of course ground black pepper. They were absolutely delicious

Great flavor! I added green onions and shallots. Next time I need to get more moisture out of the zucchini. I also baked them instead of frying.  Yummy!

Four out of the five people in my house LOVED these!! The one that has severe texture issues & hates veggies asked for more. I was amazed! I threw in some extra cheese because, well, extra cheese.  Enough said.

This is a keeper! I did add breadcrumbs like others suggested. I also salted and drained the zucchini thoroughly before combining the ingredients. They fried up nice and crispy. I topped mine with a fried egg and it was perfect.

I made for dinner tonight, I added a little panco and garlic to the recipe, the panco to soak up any liquid, I did soak on paper towels also. Family love them, and since we have so many zucchini in our garden, this gives me something else to do with it.

I did not drain the zucchini as I should have. Instead I added a ton of bread crumbs. The result was that I had to cook it in a super thin layer and it was tedious and took forever. However, they tasted fantastic. I also had added lots of other spices as it seemed in need.

I wanted to feed it to my one year old, so I steamed the zucchini and the onions first and then put them in the food processor. Since they were so soft, instead of ending up with chopped veggies, I got a puree. I resigned myself to zucchini pancakes and they turned out pretty good! I added some creole like seasoning - 1 tsp each of garlic powder, thyme, oregano, paprika and two tsp basil and 1/2 tsp pepper. Fried them on the stove and them seemed to be gooey inside, but I just chalked that up to the cheese. The spices added delicious flavor!!

This was just ok. I didn't have Moz so i used some white cheddar I had in addition to the Parm.  I also added some fresh parsley as well as garlic. I might have had to use too much oil as the patties were very loose and wouldn't fry up like I am used to. Not sure what happened. I will look for a different recipe. These weren't bad, just not the greatest.

My other half loved these. He rarely loves any veggie dishes that are not corn related. I did add 1/4 cup more flour and also added about 1/2 cup finely crushed seasoned stuffing cubes as it was too wet to handle on making original recipe. I used Tajin as a seasoning. It goes well with all veggies.

I've made these a few times. However, instead of frying them, I bake them and they still come out great. One time, I added shredded carrots. Another time I added bread crumbs, and they are fool proof.

I love this stuff!  If you like hash browns, you will love it too!  I really didn't expect this to be as good as it is, but I had a bunch of shredded zucchini left over from making zucchini bread so decided to try it.  I did add a clove of chopped garlic and used half mozarella/half sharp cheddar plus the listed amount of Parmesan.  Because I used a two handfuls of zucchini (I had so much!) I had to add an extra egg.  Also added some black pepper because I can't imagine eggs without it.  It made 7 large patties.

I added a clove of garlic and I still feel it lacked something.  It was good, but not great.  Maybe  replace some of the flour with corn meal or add some herbs.  I also think it needed more zucchini or less breading and cheese.  I will make it again,  but with variations.

My family loved this - I added about 1/2 cup of white cheddar to the mix and it was divine.  This will definitely be a staple in my recipe box,

These turned out delicious, I added chopped carrots and topped them off with a little marinara sauce and a dollop of sour cream. I cooked them in the oven for a bit to evaporate the excess moisture and then browned them in a skillet with cooking spray. Great recipe and the kids loved it too, I will definitely make it again.

Yummy! I made them with a bit bigger scoops of batter. Also, next time, pat dry the zucchini after letting it rest a bit.

It was tasty, but did not come out like I expected. I expected it to be like a "burger" and found it more like a pancake. Not bad, tho. Goes well with salsa and plain Greek yogurt.

Very good.  Definitely need to drain the zucchini and press out the liquid.  Similar to other reviewers, I used bread crumbs in place of most, but not all, of the flour.  Good by themselves or something like marinara sauce.

First batch I made was too big. Recipe says it makes four patties so I used the ingredients to make four patties.  Unfortunately this resulted in them not being cooked all the way through.  Second batch I made them just a little bigger than silver dollar pancakes and they cooked up nice and even. They were very delicious.  Served them with salsa for a little extra kick. Will be making them again.

These were really good!  I did tweak a bit.  Like other reviews, I grated and squeezed out the excess liquid.  I didn't add salt.  Just my preference.  I substituted panko for the flour, and added garlic, some basil, oregano and red pepper flakes. along with the grated Parmesan and the mozzarella. shaped into patties and baked at 375 on a cast iron skillet.  I turned the patties over after about 15-20 minutes, and browned on the other side.  Squeezing out the excess liquid and not handling the patties much was important.  Served with a side of pear/mozzarella pasta and some balsamic vinegar.  Definitely will add to my no meat day rotation.

I used half flour and half Italian bread crumbs for the flour portion, and added a sprinkle of garlic powder. These were delicious served with a dollop of sour cream and a few scallions on top. Will make again!

These were awful. I've made similar before with good results but I was a little  leery of this recipe when it called for half a cup of flour. The inside was sticky, pastie and gummy. Yuk!

Made according to the instructions - except I wrung out the grated zucchini before mixing it with the other ingredients (see video for description), and added grated garlic (2 cloves), which was a lovely addition. Served with sour cream and salsa. Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly.  The flour really turned this into a bread-like patty.  I was expecting it to taste more vegetably.  What a waste of perfectly good zucchini.  Not my style.

Super easy to make and cheap. They aren't really enough for a main item unless you make 'em really thick; I think they'd be great for cutting in half then dipping in a spicy sauce. The original recipe is a tad bland so I added garlic and Italian breadcrumbs for flavor and to thicken them up.

We didnt' have mozarella so used Swiss cheese.  Loved these!!!!  We didn't measure the onion and next time might try a little pinko but only because we think it just might be good.  These are fabulous as the recipe is!  Great for an appetizer, especially with vegetarians.

These are delicious - the whole family liked them.  I let my zucchini sit with salt for a few hours and then squeezed a lot of water out before mixing in the other ingredients. The patties were nice and flat and still stayed quite moist in spite of removing much of the water content. I'll make this recipe again.

"Sweated" the grated zucs in paper towels. A MUST!  Did as others, bread crumbs inside and out for crunch and to hold together. Added minced garlic and maybe next time more salt and pepper. Really good dipped in marinara sauce. A keeper.

Instead of onion I put a little onion powder and garlic powder and instead of mozzarella cheese I put cheddar cheese. I will absolutely make this one again. Served with breaded chicken and salad. Awesome recipe, so easy and so tasty.

Made it exactly how it says but it could use a bit extra of some seasoning, potentially a teaspoon of garlic with bring a little more flavor. Will try it again with the garlic.

Modified recipe. Only used Parmesan cheese.  Mozzarella is to milky and wet.  I didn't have a scale or cheese cloth but the fritters came out great. The smaller the zucchini means less water. Next time I might add a little fresh parsley. Otherwise, this will be a household favorite! Delicious

Used less oil (& fried in Grape Seed Oil). Added Minced Green Bell Peppers, Black Forest Ham & Herbs  De Provence.  With fresh from our garden Cozelle Zucchini very nice. Fry high heat - treat like pancake.. Did serve w/sour cream & chives.

I made this exactly as written, (except I replaced parmesan with manchego because that's all I had.) They were delicious and the family scarfed them up accordingly, including my picky five year old. It was such an easy recipe, I had her help me which is always fun. :)

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I love that it contains zucchini. I think it makes it very healthy. Great way to add vegetables to your diet. Ate mine with applesauce and sour cream.

Excellent, although I would highly recommend adding a generous dose of garlic powder and even some paprika.  I was concerned with how wet the combined ingredients were until I began frying them.  Turned out great - great texture crispy on the outside and tender inside.

These are an absolutely great side dish and very tasty and easy to make!  I have made them twice and just used parmesan cheese.  My husband loves them, so I'll definitely revisit this recipe.

I really enjoyed these.  They reminded me of the delicious potato pancakes we ate when I was a kid.  Made them exactly as the recipe said.  Nex time, I will cut back a bit on the flour  and on the cheese.  I thought the cheese overpowered the zucchini.  When I make them again, I will update and let you know how they turned out.  Thanks for a good recipe; enjoyed using up some of the over abundant zucchini!

Probably a 5 Star recipe, however, learned many lessons in the first attempt. Lesson (1) use fiber zucchini grate; (2) follow order of mixing; (3) drain zucchini is one thing, but to press between paper towel to extract excess water is necessary

Delicious! I had a ginormous zucchini that had to be used. Made this according to original recipe, adding only a teaspoon of garlic powder and sprinkling some bread crumbs on top of each "patty" in the oil.  Soooo good!! And it had a great crispy crust after

These were delicious! I did salt and squeeze out the extra moisture from the zucchini. I didn't have mozzarella cheese, so I grated 1 cup of monterey pepper jack cheese and skipped the parmesan. Two cloves of garlic make it extra yummy!

Seriously delicious!! I just added a little ketchup and they were the perfect snack. I didn't have a grater so I put the zucchini in a food processor and drained the water. I had to switch pans after my first batch since it wasn't non-stick enough. Once I did, they turned out great!!

Be careful not to use too much oil when frying!!  I'd recommend using cooking spray or a non-stick pan with no oil so that the fritters do not become too greasy!!! Otherwise they were very good!

I followed the recipe as is.  I used small zucchini, about one to one and a half inches thick and didn't have a problem with the mix being too wet.  These were very good as a side or by themselves.

Turned out great. Made a few changes, used baking mix instead of flour, and used bread crumbs, 3 different cheeses, garlic powder, and Italian season. Didn't measure ingredients. I hate frying on stove top, choose healthier used my air fryer 390degrees for about 6 minutes per side.

Definitely use the instant potatoes instead of flour. Add crab meat and put it on a sandwich as an alternative. Has crab cake texture. Awesome recipe!

Fabulous!!! I made adjustments as per Bev's rating (salting and draining the zucchini, substituting 1/3 cup seasoned breadcrumbs for the flour) and I added some shredded carrot and fried in garlic infused olive oil. So tasty!

I'm sure this is delicious. I've been making something very similar for a while. Instead of flour I use baking mix, I also usee grated carrots and use a linen to squeeze out the liquid from the veggies first....Make sure you also add garlic or whatever other spices you like.

I would suggest to really take the time to squeeze all of the water content out of the zucchini by using cheese cloth or a paper towel. They were a little soggy in the middle because I didn't do this step as well as I could have. Also, I bacon wrapped these before I fried them, and OH MY GOODNESS, so good!!! I also used fresh minced garlic. I gave my family the choice of sour cream and chives or marinara sauce. Both were amazing!!! I will be making these again in the near future.

Drained the water out of the zucchini.

Needs a bit more seasoning.

Not bad. I made mine with whole wheat flour and added garlic.  I would make again, but I think it needs a little more of a kick. I dipped the patties in sriracha sauce.

Recipe is good but they don't crisp up like I would prefer. I put mine in over for 10 mins after. I also added some chilli flakes for some kick.

This was an easy and tasty recipe. I used a little more oil when frying them in the pan. I even added a clove of garlic in the oil to add some extra flavor. Would make this again.

Good flavor but poor directions. Made it by the recipe and it was too sloppy to fry. So I put on parchment paper and baked at 400+ degrees. They were---okay. My kids 1 and 4 really super liked them but they were chewy after baking them.

These are a great way to use zucchini.  I add seasoned bread crumbs and bake them @375 for 30-35 minutes (flipping them once). Top with sour cream.  Sometimes I also add some corn too!

I made a few adjustments based on what we had - main changes: did 1 grated zucchini and 1 grated carrot, used flax seed + water instead of egg, used handful of shredded cheddar instead of other cheeses mentioned. While family loved them. Tasty and easy, will make again!

Amazing recipe... I have made twice,, I use egg whites only X3, instead of whole egg and added onion powder as well... perfect for snacking on!! I made them small enough to be only 45 cals each. This makes about 14 patties.

These take a while to make so I suggest you double the recipe and make lots so its worth your time! Hubby and I LOVED them but found there wasn't enough. 

Pro tip: salt the shredded zucchini and let it sit in a bowl for 10-15 minutes. Then rinse and strain it, squeezing out the water. This will remove the additional water from the zucchini, making it easier to pack together.

These amazing cakes will make you taste buds sing! I stumbled across this recipe and decided to give it a go after my father-in-law grew some zucchini. I wouldn't change this recipe at all. Follow the instructions and it will lead you to a blissful stomach.

You could tell the flavor was there but no matter what I did it was turning out more like a pancake with zucchini in it. I did less oil and more oil and I added some things to it. Just wouldn't fry properly for me which made it kinda heavy and gross to eat. Was expecting something more like a hashbrown made with zucchini. I would try it again to see if there's a different outcome, but not my favorite. :(

This was good as a base, I did add some mushrooms and you could add other vegetables that you like. Made a yogurt bases sauce for it and everyone loved it. Next time I might add some pepper flacks or something to provided just a little more spice heat.

I love this recipe. My mom always used to make these. I replaced Mozzarella with Emmental, the all purpose flour with organic spelt flour , vegetable oil with organic olive oil. I used organic zucchinis too. The patties came out delicious!

My family thought these were pretty bad. Unfortunately I doubled the recipe after reading all the reviews. I ended up throwing out the leftovers and didn't even finish making the rest of the batter. I should have used my zucchinis for bread instead. There was absolutely no need for the cheddar or parmesan cheese.

This is my husband's favorite recipe! I always add more mozza to make them a bit gooey. I've found that baking the patties instead of frying them makes them less greasy and they come out with a crunchy coat.

Love  the recipe. I substituted bread crumbs in place of flour and instead of salt and pepper, I used Creole seasoning. Baked in oven, put on whole grain bread with dash of gochujang...mmm delicious!!

I know I've made this before but guess I forgot to rate it. Tastes great with sour cream, dill, and green onion dip. For some reason, I wanted to try it with vinegar. It tastes better with vinegar and makes the patties taste less oily. Oh. I did grate the zucchini and let it drip dry for about 8 hours.

I am not a zucchini fan, but when daughter made these, I really liked them, and have since made them..  So, when I was given a couple of huge zucchini, I stripped their seeds, chopped them well, and drained them, then froze in 2 cup portions.  Today I transferred these portions to food saver bags,  to have the patties this winter.

I made mini versions of these to put on cream of carrot soup. They were amazing! I would add less egg next time, as I wanted more crunch/crisp and they were more of a patty/soufflé consistency. I didn't have mozzarella, but just added more parmesan and it was great.

These are very tasty. I make them for my toddler and he devours them. I use a good non-stick pan with no oil. Only issue I have is getting them to crisp up well on the outside. Yummy either way.

Love these! I just made them and my wife raved about them. She said, "You're not just eye candy"! LOL. Anyway, we enjoyed the zucchini with a dollop of sour cream and I applied a dash of Franks Hot Sauce. Will be making these again and again! Thanks!

This one is a keeper! Loved another way to use up zucchini. I used instant potato flakes as suggested by another cook and sauteed the onion with some garlic and let cool slightly before adding it all together. Delicious and definitely making again...Maybe tonight!

This has become my favorite way to eat zucchini. It is so flavorful. I have made it with zucchini and yellow summer squash and included chopped green pepper when I have it on hand. The blend of cheeses with the zucchini is excellent! My husband can't get enough of this yummy vegetable dish.

Great recipe but you really need to drain the water from the zucchini for it to turn out. I replaced the flour with bread crumbs, added garlic and used mozzarella and medium cheddar. It is very tasty, only gave it 4 stars because I had to modify the recipe a bit based on the other reviews.

I really loved these! I added chopped jalapeños, cheddar, garlic, cumin, and onion powder. I also used 1/2 breadcrumbs/ 1/2 flour and rolled them in breadcrumbs, then refrigerated while cooking the rest of the meal to keep them firm. Definitely get out all the liquid in zucchini using cheesecloth or paper towels. They were like crab cakes, yummy!

This is one of my favorite recipes, I've been going back to it for almost a year; I never made any tweaks until I tried putting it in my deep fryer, and it was amazing! I was having a hard time really perfecting the pan fry, possibly because I hadn't been draining the zucchini, but whatever moisture is in the zucchini should be left when deep frying,  it's super crunchy on the outside and so gooey inside, the contrast is superb!

The first time I made this recipe, I followed the directions to the letter, four stars.  It was in desperate need of salt.

The second time, I added garlic salt and mushrooms, and it was fantastic.

Super easy to throw together.

I made the recipe as posted the only difference was tiny.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular.   Fresh, full zucchini taste and cheesy, too,  I might add a little extra flour next time, but I didn't try to get more water out of the zucchini.  I don't find the extra step worth my time.  What I like about this recipe is its implicity.  Quick!

These are amazing!  My children were asking for more...zucchini!  Some friends came over while I was making them and all tried them and loved them.  I added some cooked ground turkey to the mix to give it a little protein.  Excellent recipe!

excellent recipe. I did however use some other reviewer's advise and sprinkle salt on them and then squeezed out the water. I don't think I got it all, so next time I'll use a kitchen towel to help with that. I also added some bread crumbs and some fresh garlic. It was delicious overall.

I was disappointed.  The taste was a little bland and I expected at least a little crispness but that didn't happen.  It was a fast and simple side dish but it needs more flavor.  I will certainly try it again with some of the suggested tweaks.

This love this recipe.  I made double recipe, used 1/4C flour, 1/4C cornstarch, 1C Italian breadcrumbs, 2T Italian herbs, shiracha to taste, mixes zucchini & yellow squash for color, and 5 eggs.  I used my hand to scoop mixture and dip into a small bowl of Italian breadcrumbs, drop in a the pan, squish it down to about 1/4" (I used the back of my hand)

These are fantastic and even my oldest who is picky about what vegetables he eats loves these. Need to make a double batch when I make these. I don't put any salt in and we all add our own when eating them. Sour cream and chives make them even better! Great way to use up all that zucchini you have from the garden. A must try!!

Great way to use all my zucchini. I drained the zucchini as others suggested and added fresh garlic as well. Used a cast iron pan out on the grill with coconut oil to fry the patties. Very delicious

I just made these and they never made it to the table.  everyone samples and couldn't stop eating them.  we were full before we sat down for lunch lol  THEY ARE THAT GOOD!  I followed the recipe exactly and will do so again.  This is one of those recipes that I'm sure will taste great with other ingredient variations but I can tell you they are full of flavour as is.  Bon Appetite

These are wonderful!  Per the other reviewers, I added finely chopped and cooked mushrooms and red bell pepper.  I also salted the shredded zucchini, drained it in a colander, and squeezed out the excess moisture.  We had leftovers and they were still delicious.  I didn't have any marinara sauce, but they are perfect plain.  I will be making these again very soon.  My husband can't stop raving about them!  Thank you Sherlie for submitting such a great recipe!

Thumbs up, will make again.   I did not follow the quantities strictly, and the cheeses were somewhat different (pecorino and a shredded cheese mix of monterey/cheddar).  Also added a jalapeno and skipped the salt.  Made sure to squeeze a lot of the liquid out of the zucchini and onion before mixing anything else in.  Cooked 2-3 minutes per side.

Doubled recipe. Added onion salt & potato flakes. very good. A bit salty (per other tasters).  Would like the recipe to be less labor intensive (frying all of the pancakes). Was wondering if anyone has tried to put it on a cookie sheet to bake/broil...then cut it into squares....if so, would love to hear how that worked.

My family loved it! 
Instead of the chopped onion, I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of dry minced onion plus 1/4 teaspoon of powdered garlic.  Also I didn't have any mozzarella cheese so I used Sharp cheddar cheese instead.

This was a great recipe. I like spice so I used Italian bread crumbs instead of flour and pepper jack cheese for the mozzarella. It tasted awesome.  I also baked the patties for 30 min at 350 degrees, flipping after 15 minutes instead of frying. They were delcious!

Awesome! I used gluten free flour.  I made half, I recommend squeezing the zucchini with paper towels to remove liquid first,  then you don't need quite as much flour.

We are celiac so I had to make the following alterations: I used gluten free (co-op brand all-purpose GF) flour and added pepper. I also used gluten free bread crumbs in the top and bottom of each patty.  I squeezed out as much of the zucchini juice as I could by squeezing it in my hands with paper towel. Still the batter was gooey. Nevertheless, the final product was golden brown and delicious. We will make this again and again.

This did not turn out anything like I thought it would. I should have read reviews to salt/drain zucchini.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for adding garlic and red pepper) and what I was left with was a cheesy zucchini mush. Which shrunk once I cooked it so was only enough for 3 small side servings. I'm rating it 4 stars because it tasted great, and I'd make it again as a side dish, and I'm assuming it was user error since everyone else seemed to be successful  :)

Fantastic!  I followed recipe , however I didn't have any mozzarella so I subbed sharp cheddar.  I also decided to spice it up a bit and added diced jalapeño, and a little more onion. Then used sour cream and applesauce

I made these last night as a side dish, and they were amazing!! I made a couple additions to the recipe.  I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and rolled the balls of zucchini mixture in panko bread crumbs before frying.  The Panko made them nice and crispy on the outside.  I will definitely be making these again!

We used some parmesan and cheddar cheese. Added garlic pepper and salt.
We found we had to cook them real slow and later covered
them with a lid so as to cook the center nice and well done.

We enjoyed them and will make more of them. We love potato fritters , so these fit into our mew menu.

I liked the concept and  the flavor was good. But it was a little heavier than expected. Very similar to a frittata. Next time to lighten and highlight the zucchini, I plan to reduce to one egg, and 1/2 the cheese. But definitely will make again. Thx for recipe.

I followed directions but added Italian breadcrumbs inside mixture and outside patties for crispness and texture.  Also minced fresh garlic and added feta cheese.  Used San Marzano tomatoes as a side for these.  So delish!

Like others said, remove excess water first, then I added a bit of chopped jalapeno and coated in  Italian bread crumbs before frying. I followed others advice and used crushed red pepper, fresh minced garlic, and used half flour/half panko. I like my meals to have a bit of heat and this really fit the bill!

Absolutely delish! 2nd time I made these...huge hit!
Read some of the reviews and only added 1/2 cup of panko to thicken it up a bit. No other changes...doesn't need any changes...love them and saved as a fav!

These were really good, though I did make a couple changes. I didn't have any parm on hand, so I used cheddar instead (1/2 cup, still included the 1/2 cup mozz). I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt, mixing it into the mixture before cooking. I then topped with additional diced onion and diced tomato. I'll make again (and a great way to use zucchini for breakfast!). Thanks for the recipe!

We added roasted red peppers, minced garlic and Italian seasoning. I also only used 1 egg and Italian breadcrumbs instead of flour. The second batch cooked better than the first. We had too much oil in the pan for the first batch. We served chicken sausages over the zucchini cakes with a tomato basil sauce. Delicious!

These sounded so delicious!  I eat mostly Paleo, so I made the following changes:
Almond flour instead of Flour
No cheese
Coconut Oil
*Also remember to squeeze the water out of the grated zucchini. Use a paper towel, this will make it easier to form and cook
SO Good!!!!!!

So tasty! I made these patties for breakfast and they were light and satisfying.  I added Swiss cheese instead of mozzarella.  For toppings, I used basil pesto and chopped cherry tomatoes.  I can't wait to make these for guests.

After reading all the positive reviews, I doubled the recipe the very first time I tried it. Only variation was using whole wheat flour instead of the white. Being cautious to avoid having it to watery as mentioned by some of the reviews, I added the egg mixture sparingly as I mixed it into the ingredients. Amount was almost spot on. This recipe is another keeper.

i made the recipe as-is plus an additional sprinkle of pepper.  I made a 1/2 batch since it was just me.   I did roll one patty in bread crumbs (plain) but actually preferred the taste of the regular patty.  On a skillet, I did about 2 1/2 minutes per side.

I ate mine with a dill dip vs. sour cream.  This gave it a little zip, overall, for flavor.  Although my serving was supposed to be for 2 people, I ate all six patties in one serving.  Yummy lunch!

I've made these several times and they've always turned out great. I find that they taste even better the next day.

I have played around a bit with the recipe depending on what I have on hand. Sometimes I've left out the cheese if I don't have any on hand. In that case, I add more spices. Last time I added smoked paprika which was a nice touch. I've never drained the zucchini first and they always turn out fine.

This is a great basic recipe. I left out the mozzarella to save calories, but it would likely be awesome with it. In addition I added grated carrots and fresh parsley. Freshly ground pepper and a bit of hot sauce might also finish it nicely. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these Zucchini patties last year several times and even froze some.  I live alone and cannot eat a whole batch at one time, much as I would love to.  I couldn't wait for the zucchini to start to come in fresh this year.  Bought the Zucchini on Monday and am making up a big batch tonight.  I can't wait for them to be done.  Yum.

My first batch wasn't good because when I fried them, they just fell apart.  I was determined to find a way because it was an easy recipe.  I shredded the zucchini in my vita mix by adding water and chopped fine.  I drained and squeezed out the excess water.  I added the rest of the ingredients plus I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  They came out great.  I will definitely make again and again.

I loved this recipe. Normally I try not to make too many changes before rating a recipe, but after I started this became a project to use up a bunch of things in my pantry and fridge! I took the advice of other reviews and drained as much water as I could (although I probably could have drained more). I did add a squeeze of basil paste, a squeeze of garlic paste and I used up some ground flax meal I had leftover in my fridge instead of flour. Yummy!! I wish I had sour cream when I decided to make this, but they were still delicious plain. My 2 year old daughter ate several and dipped them in ketchup :)

This recipe was absolutely amazing! I didn't use exact measurements but hung in there pretty close to the written recipe. I added a little finely diced red bell pepper just for a pop of color. I also let my shredded zucchini drain on some paper towel before adding it to the mixture.  I used plain breadcrumbs instead of flour (that's all i had) and added a couple of good shakes of Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese.  This was sooooo yummy. I can't wait to make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was fantastic!  I tried to cut calories a little & only used one egg & didn't add the mozzarella cheese. I added 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (I forgot to add the Parmesan cheese ugh, next time!  I added oregano, as I only had plain breadcrumbs, garlic & onion powder, and two TBSP flour.  I squeezed out the liquid from the zucchini per others suggestion. I decided to follow another poster and baked this in the oven at 375 for 15 minutes, flipped, baked 10 more minutes, then broiled 3 min on each side. These were outstanding & I will definitely make again.

I thought these turned out great.  I did substitute the instant mashed potato flakes in place of the flour and I thought it gave the patties great texture.  I also added garlic to this recipe.  They were even good reheated in the microwave the next day.  I will definitely be making these again.

I did not make any changes at all. Except we did not use any side dressing. Had them available but did not need them. These are beyond awesome and I will be making them again. Thank you so much for a new family recipe! M. This is the second time  made these and they are better than last time! Love these soon much! M

It was delicious and very simple! I used a julienne peeler on my zucchini rather than a grater, and it worked very well. Be sure to watch the video as it instructs you also to add extra seasoning - a very smart idea.

I made it all by the recipe except I used 1/3 cup italian bread crumbs and 1 tbsp flour (instead of 1/2 cup flour) it definitely adds a lot of flavor.  I actually fried it in oil on the stove (big pan, ~1/2 inch deep of oil) instead of just dry fry- it make it much crispier.  I laid down a sheet of wax paper and used a table spoon to heap piles of the zuc mixture into wads which I patted down into "patties".  I put some more bread crumbs on top and patted those in.

These were delicious! I knocked off a star because mine really needed some bread crumbs, even after I squeezed out the zucchini to get rid of some of the moisture. The mix was just too wet otherwise. I served mine with a homemade tzatziki. Yum!

I followed the directions exactly and they came out good.  My 4 year old and 8 year old both asked for seconds and then fought over who got the last one (lol...they weren't happy they had to split it).  

I didn't give it 5 stars because the directions should have told you to remove some of the moisture from the zucchini.  Next time I will make sure to do that.  I also want to try and bake them like some of the other reviewers suggested.  I will definitely be making these again.

Be sure to drain the zucchini juices. We did not drain the juice so we added bread crumbs to help with the consistency they were good.

Me and my husband enjoyed this tasty veggie dish.  I used a food processor to mix the onion and zucchini.  Then used a paper towel to drain some of the liquid as many reviewers suggested.  I also added a pinch of minced garlic as well.  Delicious!

Quick, easy and super tasty. I mixed Parmesan, Provolone and Mozzarella Cheese. 

I would put the patties in a floured dish on the fridge for 30 mins just to gain a little firmness and so they are easy to mold and to retain shape. Will definitely do it again!

Old Bay or Mrs. Dash +  a lil bit of hot sauce makes it.  SO..... I made one, tasted it, then adjusted the seasonings in the  batter.  Easy to make- my friends loved them- said they were like latkes.  Served with veggie dip vs. plain old sour cream.

Just made this recipe and chewing as I'm writing...lol.  It's delicious.   Like everyone, I tweaked the recipe just a tad.  The one thing I did not do was drain the shredded zucchini because that is a chore I despise.  It cooked up just fine.  Still crispy on the outside!  Here were my tweaks: I am on a gluten free diet, so I subbed organic buckwheat flour for regular wheat flour.   I didn't add egg because I wanted to eat these with a poached egg for brunch.   I added a few bits of ham to the batter.   I will definitely make them again!  What I will do differently next time: eliminate the Mozzarella.  I didn't really notice the flavor present in the patty.  Use organic zucchini.  Otherwise, it's loaded with pesticides.  Use less oil.  They were a bit oily.  Try it!  You'll like it!

I love this recipe and so did my family...was a little skeptical, but it turned out great! I did follow the review of another reviewer minus the cheddar cheese and red pepper flakes and it was delicious...with or without spaghetti sauce(what I had at home)! Thank you for the great recipe!

Great! This recipe is super easy, and makes a great easy dinner. It's a little plain, so putting it in a burger, or adding some spices can liven it up. Also make sure to eat it as soon as it's finished frying or it'll go soggy.

These are really great! I followed MalibuMels potato flake advice, and I amp'd it up with patting the mixture into rings of bell peppers. Sooo filling, and great for breakfast.

We made this for our dinner tonight. I altered the recipe in the following way(s);
- I used Panko Japanese bread crumbs instead of the flour. I found that in doing so, I eliminated the sometimes pasty after taste or that "glue" effect that flour has in a recipe. It also browns up crispy better than flour.
- I added one additional egg (3 total)
- I eliminated the salt (my wife puts her own on whereas I don't use salt in cooking unless absolutely necessary).
- Finally, since it "read" Italian flavor(s) I used warm/hot spaghetti sauce as a topping. This added any missing spices that are not in the recipe and is an easy sauce for anyone's taste.
What would I do next time? I might try some fresh herbs (chives and cracked pepper) to the mix. Overall, very impressed (and for my wife that is sometimes difficult).

I've tried another recipe similar to this one and this one is much better. I added quite a bit more herbs and spices, and glad I did (otherwise I think it would be bland) Instead of using the tomato sauce for dipping, I made an avocado dill sauce. (1 mashed avocado, 1-2 tsp of mayo and chopped fresh dill) Went very well together. Will definitely make this regularly.

These were really good.  I loved the fact that I didn't have to salt, drain, and squeeze the zucchini.  The batter was nice and thick.  Great  flavor. Next time I may try more Parmesan and/ or some cheddar.

We frequently make these on our meatless dinner nights - they go great with a yogurt-based sauce.  I like to add a bit of garlic and dill, and make sure to keep the oil around 350 F.

Good!  The zucchini really does weep and the salt doesn't begin to dry it up.  I used strong paper towels to blot, and kept squeezing the towels out.  I added 1/2 green pepper chopped into small pieces and will add some thyme next time.  Drop small spoonfulls into frying pan so you can flip them without breaking.   I think topping with sour cream might make these a 5 star....

These were fantastic!  Like some others I added parsley and garlic.  I also used coconut oil instead of olive oil.  First time using a food processor.  I put the grated zucchini in a colander to drain it, but will try the dish towel method next time.

These are great! I've made the recipe twice now - once as directed, another time using the suggestion of another reviewer using mashed potato flakes instead of flour. I thought both were delicious, although the version with the flour I felt needed a little 'something' (serving with tomato sauce or sour cream), whereas the version with the potato flakes were enough on their own since the seasoning from the flakes gave the flavor more depth. I'll probably be using the potato flake version moving forward since that's what my fiance preferred.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I ended up using almost 3 cups of mixed zucchini as well as adding pepper and replacing mozzarella with lite feta cheese. I did that because it's what i had.  I ended up over salting, because I assume, the feta had enough salt. However I made a bunch of little patties and made a side of yogurt shallot sauce with garlic, dill, mint, and lemon. It was awesome. I even whipped it a bit with my hand blender to make it fluffy. All in all, this was simple, easy dish to prep and cook. I will make it again and ease up on the salt in the future.

I have been meaning to make this for a while. Well, I finally did. They are delicious my vegetarian daughter LOVED them. I grated the zucchini on the large hole side of the grater it was easier than I thought it was going to be. I put the zucchini in a strainer salted it a little to draw the water out and  to cut down on bitterness. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. THE KEY IS TO GET THE WATER OUT OF THE ZUCCHINI. It will be very mushy if you don't. I put mine in paper towels & tried to press out as much water as I could. Instead of flour I used seasoned bread crumbs I followed the recipe for all the other ingredients. I tasted it, seemed bland so I added a little garlic powder  and paprika. I cooked them up and served with a choice of sour cream or marinara sauce.  Yum! We prefer sour cream.

I made it exactly as posted and I loved it. I think I've eaten half of it. I did make a second batch in an attempt to use up all the zuchinni and added chopped up almonds to give it some crunch and they were excellent.  Have been looking to eat less meat and this is a great alternative, with or without my change. Ty for sharing!

These were easy, fast and very tasty. Don't let the photo fool you, they were in no way too greasy or heavy. The out side is crispy but the inside texture is soft and light.  I would reduce the cooking heat to medium instead of medium-high, that way the inside gets cooked  before the outside has a chance to burn. At medium-high heat I ended up with a burnt outside and runny inside. I wouldn't add salt at the end, the 1/2 cup parmesan cheese makes it salty enough.

I have made these several times and they are delicious. However I recommend using cooking spray instead of vegetable oil, otherwise they come out way too oily. I also add a cup of breadcrumbs to further reduce the moisture and help the patties get crispier.

I just added a small  pinch of white pepper and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I've already made these twice in the last week.  With a small salad on the side, this is a great meatless meal.

My kids loved it!  I made three batches because they ate them all before Dad got home from work, and they wanted them for breakfast.  The kids said they taste like hashbrowns.  I ran out of Mozzarella cheese on the third batch so I used mild cheddar plus no onions.  They loved them too.  I cooked for 10 minutes each side at slightly less than medium.

I have been making this for years to use up zucchini that I always grow.  I do it with half grated potato, skip the flour and the parm cheese.  Then I cook it with butter like hash browns.  It is a great way to get anyone to eat zucchini.  Even those who claim they don't like it.

Only complaint with these was that they fell apart when I tried to flip them but they were very good regardless.

These were very good and my husband liked them more than green onion cakes (which is saying something).  I made them exactly as stated in the recipe except that I sprayed them with olive oil and baked at 350 for 10 minutes a side.  They came out crispy and delicious with less calories than frying.  Next time I may try to add more spices like garlic or perhaps a bit of black pepper and mustard powder.

This was a very good base recipe.  It was quick and easy.    I can see adding some taco seasoning/hot sauce and dipping in salsa or sour cream or adding some basil, garlic, and oregano and dipping in marinara.  My daughter like it with ranch dressing.

I really enjoyed these. They mixed up quickly and were easy to make. I did squeeze out the water before I mixed them and it made a huge difference. I've tried to make zucchini pancakes before without squeezing the water out and they were mush. I made them just as the recipe was written and I thought they were delicious! I will definitely make them again.

So delicious!  Added some minced garlic and black pepper in mine, adding some extra flavor.  Also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  FYI that it works with 1 egg... I thought I had more and had already shredded everything so I went for it, and it worked just fine.

One word FABULOUS! 
These are similar to what I grew up eating made with potato or zucchini. However ours were more simple. Grated potato or zucchini, grated onion, salt, egg, and flour. The cheese added to these was just fantastic!!! And I like the chopped onion instead of shredding. I made them 2 days in a row.  I'm going to give it a try with potato too. Yum! The best recipie I've ever made from All Recipes.

Yummy! I used yellow squash instead of zucchini, because that's what I had on hand, and sharp cheddar in place of the mozzarella.  I made them in the waffle iron with a little non-stick spray instead of oil and a skillet. perfect fluffy, crunchy, healthy bread substitute to serve with soup.

This was a huge hit! My kids were skeptical because of the slight green color, but ended up loving it (ok, the 5-year-old did.. the younger one never really tried). I personally felt as though they tasted a lot like hash browns. Hubby was shocked to find out there were no potatoes in this at all. We'll definitely be making this again!

I'll be taking some of the advice from other reviews in the future, as the zucchini was very wet when I grated it.

I cannot eat cheese so I made it a dairy free (except a yogurt topper) with substituting a half a can of white beans mashed before mixing it together. Also added a tsp of garlic paste (it's lazy but so easy) and did half flour/half bread crumbs. I followed the other suggestion to likely salt and dry the zucchini. A little extra salt, pepper and parsley flakes and it came out well. The beans added a creaminess like latkes/potato pancakes (smelled like it too) and a little extra protein for a meatless dish. My husband loved it and said we needed to add it to the rotation for meatless Monday's (or whenever we run low on meat). Two zucchini + the beans made enough for 3 meals. I did add a dollop of Greek yogurt (I can tolerate that better than cheese) and topped with sliced red peppers for color. Happy for leftovers tomorrow!  I could see adding cumin, turmeric and chili powder for a spicier middle eastern flavor. Happy to experiment!

Easy and yummy and my preschooler loved them! Like others, I reduced the flour and added flavored breadcrumbs. I made a double batch (well more like 3.5 cups of zucchini and altered the rest by eyeballing it because it's not a one for one when it comes to eggs) and fried in a cast iron pan and freezing for those weeknight meals.

Good and easy recipe, but it ended up a not as crispy as I would have hoped. Perhaps I should have replaced the flour with bread crumbs.

Also, I added the following ingredients, which I find made it even tastier: green onions, Italian parsley, garlic, black pepper

My family omitted the onions, but it was still a good recipe! Yes, they were a little bland when plain, but we dipped them in honey to fix that. This ended up overpowering the patties a tiny bit, so I guess there's no perfect way to serve them.

Overall: Recommended!

These were really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't find them to be too soggy, too bland, or any of the other complaints I read. This is a simple and tasty side that everyone in my family loved (a rarity!).  We ate them without topping, but I'm sure they'd be delicious with marinara sauce. Definitely a keeper!

This was far better than I expected it to be. I used what cheese I had on hand, which turned out to be a little parmesan, a little reggiano, and some feta. This recipe can be very versatile--you can use any kind of cheese. I also used 1/2 cup of Panko crumbs instead of flour, and egg beaters instead of real eggs. Next time I want to try adding green onion.  It was great with sour cream on top!

These patties were good.  Easy additional side to add to a meal or just to grab as a snack.  I doubled the recipe, added fresh minced garlic and pepper, fried them in olive oil.  I will add oregano, Italian seasoning maybe or basil next time for more flavor.

Found there was too much cheese and it was mushy in the centre, flavour wasn't there either. Made smaller ones but still didn't care for taste and texture.

I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and about  a tablespoon  of of chopped  fresh  basil.  They were delicious.   I topped  them with sour cream, as suggested.   However,  I think  I would  prefer a different  topping.   Something tangier would  be my preference. ..but I'm not sure what.

I absolutely love this!!  I did substitute the flour with 1/4 cup of cornmeal mix (like Jiffy).  It made the flavor wonderful.  Thought someone snuck in a can of creamed corn (which might be a great idea!)

I am not a zucchini fan but saw this recipe & decided to give it a try. OMG! Is this delicious. I will eat zucchini done like this any day of the week. I used less flour & more seasoned breadcrumbs in making the recipe but it came out perfect. I am a new zucchin fan!

Excellent recipe! I added some garlic, and used potato flakes instead of the flour as I wanted to try them gluten free. My sister is Celiac and I'm always looking for tasty recipes that will adapt. This ones a keeper :)

Added about a tablespoon of Garlic Salt and these were delicious.  My wife who doesn't like Zucchini loved them too.
My new favorite way to make zucchini.  I will try Almond flour next time to reduce the carbohydrates.

This has become a favorite side dish for our dinner.  I too use instant potato flakes rather than flour I think it gives a better taste, a teeny pinch of red pepper flakes and a minced small glove of garlic, I say small because I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us. Also I take a grapefruit spoon and just run a line down the center of each zuke to remove the majority of the seeds.  I fry mine in a very well seasoned cast iron pan with just a dab of butter. Healthy and very tasty!

Amazing, with some tweaks!! 
Here is what I tweaked:
You have to press the water out of the zucchini after you shred it, I used paper towels. I shredded it with the large holes on a cheese grater. I used two medium sized zucchini’s that made about 2 cups shredded. 

I only used a ¼ cup of flour;
I only used a ¼  to ½ cup of fresh shredded Parmesan. I didn’t actually measure;
I only used a ¼ cup of  shredded mozzarella;
I added ¾ to 1 cup of Italian Panko – Private Selection at Kroger;
I added salt and Lawry’s seasoned pepper to the mix; 

You pan fry in a cast iron skillet in about 4 TBS of canola.
I don’t like vegetable oil. Medium heat to start and then I had to reduce it down to low because the oil was getting too hot. 4-5 minutes on each side;

I pre-formed the patties about 4 at a time,  once I put them in the oil I pressed them with the spatula to flatten them out a little; 
You will have to add a little extra oil after each batch you cook;
I was able to make 12 patties. And per the recipe calculator on MyFitnessPal they average about 84 calories a piece.

I found this to be very tasty but oily. I would have loved it if I could have made it without frying in oil. I will try it again using only egg whites and spraying the pan in place of frying in oil.

After reading others suggestions I set out to make the zucchini patties.  They were delicious and well received by my family.  My modifications were; Squeezed out excess water from zucchini, used1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs, 1/4 cup flour(instead of 1/2 cup flour), minced garlic and a sprinkle of Tajin on each patties while frying

Made this recipe today. Absolutely loved the simplicity of it. Tweaked it a bit to add a bit of spice and used cheeses I had at home. Added cilantro and red pepper flakes. Definitely a keeper.

These were excellent! At first I was going to do as some other reviewers suggested and add to the recipe but decided against it. I'm glad I did, they came out perfect just following the recipe. I can't understand how anyone could say that these were bland or lacking flavor. 
The only thing I did do differently was use  a gluten free all-purpose flour.
Edit after 2nd time making these: 
Now i understand why people were saying these lacked flavor. The first time I made these I used Bob's Red Mill all-purpose gluten free flour. I had an upset stomach and this is the second time I've had problems with Bob's products so I switched to regular flour this time. I found that a lot of the flavor came from the flour the first time. Using regular flour brought out flavors I had missed out on the first time. For round 3 I will add salt and pepper.

I made them as the recipe called for.  They were delicious.  It reminded me of when I was a kid and my Mom used to make something similar when the garden would come in.  She would make them with shredded potatoes  and zucchini.

I just made these. Mine did indeed turn out too watery but I did not despair and worry: instead, I cooked them as fritters, dropping the "batter" in a warm amount of oil in a frying pan. They were delicious. We used cheddar instead of mozzarella because it's what I had on hand. I think the Parmesan is key, because it's a cheese that provides a flavor. But I think next time I may even try to use crumbled feta, zucchini tasted nice with that in other recipes. Sky's the limit with this, and thanks for sharing :)

Replaced one of the eggs with two egg whites; replaced flour with 1/2 cup cornmeal and added 1/4 cup coconut flour. Served drizzled with balsamic glaze. Very good!

I followed the recipe exactly and they were way to runny! Decient flavor but middle was to runny.  Won't make this recipe again unless I alter it like some of the other reviewers did.

I did make some changes. Instead of reg flour I used potato flour 1/3c and instead of mozza I used feta cheese. My husband who doesn't like zucchini  just loved it. Yes I'll make it again and next time maybe with cheddar. Thanks for the recipe!

as I started to make them I tied one. It was bland. So I stopped and sautéed chopped ham until well done.   Then I added it to recipe and started making patties again. Now they are amazing.

Absolutely delicious. I took some of the suggestions from other reviewers - draining the zucchini.  I also added shredded carrots, garlic, rosemary and red peppers, plus used a Parmesan, Romano & Asiago cheese mixture. I cooked it in olive oil plus added a fine coating of Panko bread crumbs.
Very tasty! I will definitely make it again.

What a great way to use up zucchini! After reading reviews I salted the grated zucchini and let it sit for 30 min. I also added a clove of garlic. These are great right out of the pan....very creamy inside. I had so many that I froze them. They are not quite as good out of the freezer but still tasty.

I could have sat down and eaten every single morsebut I had to give some to my husband.  I did drain the zucchini with a little salt in a colander,   I added seasoned bread crumbs and extra grated cheese along with some garlic powder.  I cooked the onions in a separate pan until soft and I drained these on paper towels when I took them out of the pan.  But the shredded Provolone cheese gave it such flavor.   I'm making a double recipe tonight and I think I will try baking  them instead of frying.  You can add anything you can think of to this recipe and it will be great.  I found out that the trick is to drain the zucchini and then squeeze as much of the liquid out as you could.     Enjoy!

I make this every 3 months. My family always laments that I don't make enough so next time I will double the recipe. I tweak this recipe a couple ways; I use fresh garlic, tons of red pepper flakes, powdered garlic and dried basil, and I mix cayenne pepper (just a dash) into the sour cream as a dipping sauce. I use panko crumbs instead of flour. I also fry in coconut  oil. I have baked these several times but they don't have the same texture as when I fry them.

Good recipe and tasty. I followed the idea from others and salted the grated zucchini and let them drain excess water; I seasoned with salt and added pepper, but am going to add some parsley the next time I will try these, in my opinion that will add a good flavor to it.

Awesome! Great Zucchini recipe and very simple. The only change I made was I used shredded cheddar instead of mozzarella only because that is what I had handy - gave it a great cheesy taste!

I absolutely love this! I also tried the Connie's Zucchini "Crab" Cakes the same night and this recipe OUT SHINED the others soooooo much! The mixture seems watery if you let it sit before putting it in the pan BUT just mix it and keep moving. It is BEYOND amazing. I added some garlic powder and a bit of black pepper. But this recipe is just fine without it. This recipe is AMAZING! 

oh! I added a bit more oil to the pan, but that's it! This is a MUST TRY!

I added some italian seasoning. . because commenters said it was bland. They took about 7 minutes to brown.   My husband liked them.  I think I could have added mushrooms. 
I used 1/4 cup almond flour, probably should have used more flour.  We do not eat wheat.

We really enjoyed these on a hamburger bun with some beer mustard.  We added bacon bits, black pepper and garlic powder to the mix.  It takes very little oil to cook these in a skillet.  We will definitely does these again for a meatless meal.  We will try adding crimini mushrooms next time.

Delicious, simple recipe.  I grated them and squeezed the water out of them earlier in the day.  Used about 1/2 of the flour and added seasoned bread crumbs.  I added some home minced garlic and fried them in olive oil and butter.  They were a mo steroids hit!

Excellent and yummy! A great way to use the zucchinis!  Followed the recipe with just a few tweaks. As suggested I used potato flakes instead of flour which added flavor and a good consistency. I sprinkled garlic salt on the grated zucchini as it sat in the colander.  Added some dried basil, rosemary and oregano to the mix.  Will definitely be making these again.

Made tonight for dinner and was excellent. I love zucchini and new I had to try it. The only I changed was the cheese because I only had shredded cheddar cheese on hand. Turned out great.

Absolutely wonderful! I doubled the amount of zucchini, used 3/4 cup of flour and 3 whole eggs. I substituted cheddar cheese. Delicious!

I made this and it was awesome.  First I did add garlic, basil and oregano and some "Beau Monde" seasoning.
I also add about a tablespoon of white wine.  Then I let "rest" for two hours and pan fried it in olive oil.  I served this as a main dish with homemade (my recipe) spaghetti sauce, a fresh salad with strawberry vinaigrette  and  ice tea.  My daughter loved it.

I have been making them for years.  We have always used bis quick instead of flour.  They are delicious and we eat them plain.  The kids really like them too.

Sooo good! I've never had zucchini cakes before, but I love zucchini so I thought I'd give this a try. I was not disappointed!  The only tweeks I made, were that I added some granulated garlic and Italian bread crumbs. I put red sauce on them before trying them on their own, and it wasn't needed. They are delicious by themselves! I will be making this again!

I was looking for something a bit different because every thing I ate all weekend just did not hit the spot! I wanted something I had all the makings for which I basically had for this. I did not have zucchini so I used patty pan (I think they are so close it didn't matter) and instead of Mozzarella and Parm I used an Italian cheese blend because thats what I had. I am telling you this was the ticket! It hit the spot! It was easy to make and it was flavorful and it had that little bit of crunch and it wasn't that bad for me. I am so happy I found this recipe! It was WONDERFUL! Thanks!!!!!!

This is a great recipe with some tweaks as suggested.  As a suggestion, I had a ton of zucchini so I grated it all (food processor) and froze in 2 and 3 cup packages.  For this recipe I thaw in colander so liquids will drain off.  For my chocolate zucchini cake I thaw in bowl as I need that liquid off the zucchini.

Overall it was really good.  I followed the suggestions and let the zucchini sit in salt water for a few minutes to remove some of the moisture.  I also added bacon bits to the mix for something different.  Next time I would probably use crushed saltines instead of flour to add more texture, they are a little mushy.

These turned out great. I grated zucchini and yellow squash together and left them over night in the fridge to drain. Then I left it on the counter so it would drain some more. I added everything else in it except I used hot pepper shredded cheese and 1/4 cup breadcrumbs for a nice bite. They were delicious. A little sour cream over the top or dip in marinara sauce.

Yum!! I added black pepper and a tiny pinch of nutmeg. Green onions would be good too. Will cook a little longer next time to make a tad crunchier. Served with home made tomato sauce.

After adding my own spices to give the bland patties some flavoring, I really enjoyed them!  Even my s/o, who doesn't like vegetables and makes a fuss when they're cooked, quite enjoyed them and asked for me to make them again!  They were delicious, healthy and filling!  Will certainly make them again!

It was pretty good. The next time I make it I will have to try changing it to my liking. I wish I could have made it crispier by adding some bread crumbs or like a outside coating something. I tasted more egg than anything:/ and then I will also have ranch as my dipping sauce. I had it for lunch. I'm vegetarian so I was planning to have it with rice and gravy but didn't have time to make the rice and gravy lol!

Changes:  substitute bread crumbs for flower (equal parts or to taste)  I cut onion in 1/2. I extracted as much juice as possible by using a strainer and pushing down on the zucchini prior to mixing all the ingredients.  If its still too juicy add a TBS of flour until it gets the consistence you want.  Delish!

These are fantastic! I too squeezed off a bit of excess water from the Zuc and summer squash I used. I substituted ground flax seed and crushed almonds instead of flour. Then fried them in grapeseed oil for a healthier spin. Delicious enough to get my 17yr old son to ask for seconds! Win!

This recipe is very good! I made it for a date night w/ garlic chicken and it turned out really good! I added some cayenne pepper, and chives to the batter and then served it with Spiced Sour Cream and scallions. Would definitely make again. Would Make a great summer lunch as it is very light, and serve it with some watermelon salad.

What to do with all that zucchini when you've grown it in your garden?! How much zucchini bread can one person eat?! My family and I absolutely loved this recipe! I doubled it (because I had an abundance of zucchini) made the patties and froze the extra. Turned out great! Just popped them in the microwave to re-heat.

So good! I made this last night with a garlic lemon aioli for dipping. I also did what other reviewers suggested and salted and drained the zucchini first. I also added a pinch of cayenne and black pepper. My family loved it.

I found this to be surprisingly bland, even with the addition of garlic, pepper, extra onion, and some spices. I did, however, find that this paired nicely with either honey dill sauce or cream cheese (which covered over the blandness).

Great recipe! I have an abundance of Zucchini to use up and this was perfect. I did as others had suggested and used instant potatoes in place of flour. (I did use unsalted butter instead of oil when frying)That was the only two changes. I made sure to remove as much water as I could. It was a great side dish and will be making this a regular. Thanks for the recipe Sherlie! :)

I've made these several times but modified it each time to add flavor.  My final product gets rave reviews from the family, but the recipe as is here is unmoving.  It lacks flavor.

I use Italian breadcrumbs instead of flour and I add Italian seasoning.

Loved it! My advice would be too grate the zucchinis ahead and let them rest on absorbing paper. Your mix may be too watery otherwise. Consistency was perfect: crispy on the outside and creamy inside.

This was super delicious.  I tried it with 1/2 zucchini and 1/2 summer squash, Mexican mix shredded cheese instead of mozzarella, and Adobo with pepper seasoning instead of salt/pepper. Every bit of it that was made was eaten.

I liked the concept of these and will try again making changes. I added about 3/4 cup of Italian seasoned panko breadcrumbs, 3 cloves of garlic, and cayenne pepper and they still were bland. I squeezed the water out of the grated zucchini, mixed everything up, made patties and put them on a paper towel covered plate and put in fridge for about an hour. Sprayed them with olive oil cooking spray and baked on a parchment lined cookie sheet for about 25 minutes. Don't worry if they are soft and falling apart. They will take form when baking or frying. But they were very bland. Next time I will try different cheeses like feta or a smoked Gouda. Probably could do meatballs with these too.

These are a great way to use up all that zucchini your gardener friend keeps giving you!  My husband is on a diet to make your metabolism work better, so I tried to adjust the recipe for him by adding oats blended to a powder instead of flour, and egg whites. I left out the mozzarella but kept the parmesan, and it seemed to wet, so I grated a white sweet potato and it added nicely flavor.  I am sure made the original way is even better!  Everyone liked them.

Excellent! Definitely squeeze the moisture out of the zucchini after shredding. Did not use mozzarella, just fresh parmesan and added a dash of basil which really made the flavors pop. Can't wait to make again!

Don't be intimidated by this recipe. It's excellent and super easy. I didn't change a thing. Used a big cast iron frying pan and everything came out perfect!  I served with prepared tarter sauce. I'll make this again and may play with herbs and spices and different sauces. Thanks for this!!!

YUM! Tried for the first time last night. They came out great! Reminded me of my aunt's potato pancakes that I could never get just right. I added to this recipe 2 cloves of garlic, 4 oz of mushrooms, &  about 1/2 C of pepperidge farms Herb Seasoned stuffing mix. I also used a red onion if that makes a difference. 
Great recipe! Thanks :)

Love it, as does my BF. I usually add a little garlic powder and some red pepper flakes as suggested by other reviewers. I like it with tzatziki sauce on top, my boyfriend likes it with ketchup and his favorite BBQ dry rub sprinkled on top.

Loved this and it reminded me of cauliflower patties my mum used to make when I was little! The problem was that they were too wet and didn't cook all the way through. I followed someone else's advice and used instant mashed potatoes instead, which did make them taste better, but they still wouldn't cook all the way through without burning.

I like these and they are a nice change from the hundred other ways I fix zucchini lol.  However, they do need spiced up and I like them best using sharp cheddar cheese.

These are so amazingly good and so easy to make! I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and they turned out just fine. I just wish my little boys wouldn't turn their nose up to anything that is outside their basic 5 meals they eat. Oh well, eventually they'll try it... I'll be making this one often with the bounty of zucchini we got from the garden ;)

I really enjoyed this recipe as did my 5 year old. I added a few more spices and herbs ( garlic, dill). Also used green onion because that's what I had. I squeezed most of the water out of the grated zucchini also before cooking. Great stuff!!

This is a really good recipe-I made it the first time as is, and it turned out okay.  The second time I made the recipe I tweaked it a little bit, and it turned out even better!  I changed the following things: I doubled the amount of mozzarella cheese.  I also added two cans of white albacore tuna, which really gave it a good flavor and made it more of a "fish"/zucchini patty.  The most important change I made was adding more flour-instead of 1/2 c. I ended adding 1 & 1/4 c., which really helped when frying up the patties-it gave them a better consistency and they browned a lot more nicely than the first time.  I served over rice w/ a little mayo and they were excellent.  My kids also love these on a bun as a delicious sandwhich!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and the patties came out a little pasty. The flavor was good but next time I think maybe I should cut down on the flour? I'm not really sure, as I did follow it exactly even weighing the raw zucchini, flour and wringing the  liquid out of it. Has anyone else had this problem?

We are a gluten free household so I used cornmeal instead of the flour.  It gave another depth to the flavor.  I also used a mix of pecorino and sharp cheddar, parsley, smoked paprika, garlic and onion.  We ate them with BBQ pork and dipped them in extra BBQ sauce.  Yummy!!  We will be making these regularly!

Fabulous!!!.......I used half breadcrumbs half flour. Put your favorite seasoning right in the batter. Be careful not to fry at to high of heat!. The cheese will burn!

I followed most of the recipe as written, except I started with the grated zucchini (lightly salted) and let it sit for a few minutes and then pressed as much moisture out as possible. I used cheddar instead of mozzarella cheese (it's what I had on hand), and then fried in bacon grease. Salt and pepper was added before I fried the patties and the texture and taste was wonderful. I wish I picked up more zucchini at the farm stand.

We have had an abundance of zucchini in our garden this year. I was looking for a way to use it when I found this recipe. I can't believe it even my 18-year-old son loves this recipe. Getting him to eat something green is nearly impossible. LOL Thanks for sharing this one it's a keeper.

This was excellent! I just added some crushed red pepper to give it a little zest. I made extra and froze them so I could enjoy in the winter months too!

This recipe is excellent!  I doubled the recipe, and formed the patties on a cookie tray lined with parchment paper, and then stuck them in the freezer.  When they were frozen, I put them in a ziplock bag.  I cooked 3 from frozen tonight and they were delicious - so I made two more double batches and they are all in the freezer.  The kids love them!

Worked out great! We ate them with sweet and sour sauce which complimented nicely. I used whole wheat flour and it wasn't heavy. My heat was too high though, and the outside was browned before the inside was done. I popped them in the oven at 350 for about 7 minutes. Perfect! Next time I'll just cook them on a lower setting first.

Actually pretty good! Used about 2 medium zucchinis and drained as much liquid as I could from them. I then added a fair amount of cheese (used an Italian cheese blend) and added flour until it didn't look too wet (a little more than a cup), also added about a 1/4 cup of diced green pepper along with the onion. Since there was no exact cook time given, I just cooked them until they weren't too soft. Everyone seemed to like them so I would make these again!

The only challenge was getting them cooked all the way through. I started making them flatter more like pancakes. I did not add salt- added pepper and garlic. Yumm!

Was very good, I will make these again and again with the abundant zucchini I have in my garden. I like the ideas from other reviewers, will try potato flakes instead of flour or a mixture of potato flakes and bread crumbs, I will add carrots to my next batch and of course, I added the fresh garlic and fresh herbs from my garden in my 1st batch and will continue to do so. I'm not a fan of onions (much to my husbands dismay) but he loved these as well. GREAT JOB! Thanks for the recipe.

Just tried these. I added garlic and bread crumbs to try to solidify but the outside got crisp and the inside was like baby food. The taste was great but the texture was unappealing.

I like the concept, but I think it needs tweaked. You definitely need to strain the water from the zucchini. Mine were still a tad soggy despite doing this, so next time I will add more flour or breadcrumbs to counteract that. I also went ahead and added some fresh basil since I had some I needed to use. Very tasty with marinara sauce. I'll make again, but I'll tweak it more next time.

This was SO good. I didn't use all the cheese just made a small batch using crackers instead of flour and fried them as one batch not patties.  That was faster for me as I thought patties weren't getting done as quickly.  I served it with leftover spaghetti and red sauce.  It could not have been a better combination and I will make again as it was so quick and ready to eat in a snap!.

A very good way to use up zucchini from the garden.  I didn't have mozzarella so substituted swiss and they were delicious.  I had them for breakfast with toast and fruit - yummy!

These were ok. I felt like something was missing. I did add garlic, plenty of pepper and parsley and still felt it was a little bland.  I would try again though and play around with different seasonings.

Great recipe! My kids loved that Mom was making "zucchini pancakes!" They have good cheesy flavor like a garlic cheese biscuit sort of. I didn't have any problem with the moisture and didn't drain it at all. I did add a bit of garlic powder, some parsley, black pepper, and some Italian seasoning and they were SCRUMPTIOUS!! I enjoyed eating them all by themselves, but I bet they would be great with marinara sauce, too.  We made these a 2nd time with shredded zucchini that I froze in summer when I had too much to use. As the frozen zucchini thawed, there was a lot of liquid, and I did drain that off before adding to the recipe. (I froze 3 cups and ended up with only 2 cups after draining, so it was perfect amount for this recipe!) This time around I forgot the garlic, and while they were still pretty tasty, I missed the garlic.

Yum!  What a great way to use zucchini when there is a summer surplus. I agree with those who recommended squeezing/drying the grated squash.   My only change was the addition of two cloves of garlic.  Next time I will try adding italian breadcrumbs but this was a delicious recipe.

I replaced flour with ground flex seeds. You have to drain it for more longer hours . I left it to drain in the morning and cook in the evening. Good news is that all my kids loved it with yougurt.

I just made and ate these zucchini patties, and my whole family loved them! I doubled the recipe (didn't double the egg) and added fresh basil from the garden and a chopped red bell pepper. Other than that, the only change I made was to omit the salt and sprinkle the patties with a little bit of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning as they sizzled in the skillet. I learned through trial and error that it's best not to make the patties too large, because they could turn out a little too soft and floppy. A gentle heaping on a tablespoon should be just right. They are amazing served with some sour cream. I can't wait until my garden tomatoes are ripe so that I can make these again and top them with fresh slices! Thank you, Sherlie, for a delicious new summertime recipe!!

I, too, thought the recipe was quite runny and began to add flour and more cheese.  DH told me to stop and indicated it was probably supposed to be a pancake type batter and to fry it up as is.  I did as instructed and they turned out wonderful and moist, very similar to a potato pancake or hash brown and we both thought they'd be quite nice for breakfast.  I used sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella and did not find them bland at all.  A very nice blend of cheese, onion and squashy goodness. Any other spices would make it something's it's not.

Delicious! Followed recommendations of other reviewers and squeezed out as much liquid as possible from my zucchini. I added 2 cloves garlic, cracked black pepper, and a little red pepper.  I did not have any bread crumbs on hand, so used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 corn meal. Fantastic texture and taste!

I let grated zucchini set for 30 to 40 minutes once it was grated and put it in a colander, as it will produce lots of moisture (water) that needs to be drained and patted dry…

I also formed the mixture into patties and coated with additional bread crumbs and put in a hot skillet…. Cooked them for approx. 15-20 minutes… These are delicious as is, but you could always top with marinara sauce, sour cream or additional cheese… These are very habit forming….. 

This would be good with chopped chives, minced garlic or the tops of green onions in it….. I don’t think you can go wrong with anything you try to add to it…..

Just made this and it's amazing! I just had to add more flour because it was too wet and stuck to the pan. I definitely recommend this and will definitely make this again!

YUM!  I had to substitute cheddar shred for the mozz cheese since it's what I had but stuck to the recipe for the rest.  After frying, I let them "rest" in a 300 degree oven for about 20minutes to crisp up a little more while I was wrangling the family for dinner.  I like the extra crispiness.  Will try some of the other seasoning variations another time.  A really good tasty blank canvas.

This is the only recipe I use now, and mix a yellow squash with a zucchini.  I shred the veggies on a sheet of parchment paper, spread it out and cover it with a kitchen towel, press on top, to get excess moisture out.  I have used flour but also use Panko.  I add what ever seasonings I want, and have used a Five cheese blend.  You really can't mess this one up.  Just make ahead, refrigerate for a bit, make sure the mixture holds together and brown the patties.  Really good, solid recipe!

Followed some of the other reviewers advice and tweaked the recipe, which is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  I salted the zucchini and let it sit for a few minutes, then pressed it in a colander to drain some of the water out.  We also grated the onion and some garlic into it.  The garlic gave it a lot of flavor.  I did mostly flour (about 3/4 of the half cup full) and then added some bread crumbs.  The consistency was perfect and they fried up really nicely.  My husband mixed some dried dill into some sour cream to put on top, which worked out well.

Yummmm! So moist and delicious, we forgot to add the sour cream on top and didn't miss it at all! Also no need to add salt, the cheese adds plenty of saltiness. The one  change I made was cooking the onions slightly and letting them cool a bit before adding them to the mix. We will definitely be making this again and again! :)

Very good choice for our meatless Monday meal .. Changes I made, drained as much liquid from the zucchini as possible, used medium cheddar cheese with the parmesan instead of the mozzarella, added 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic and some Emeril's essence along with the salt and pepper. Served with some fresh fruit and tossed green salad on the side .. will make again

I prepared this as directed and put into mushroom caps and into the oven on broil until they were crispy on top. LOVED IT!! Next time I will try it with potato flakes as suggested by other members and experiment with using chives instead of onions.

these are awesome! my friends and family always ask me to make them. I tend to substitute the flour for bread crumbs and serve with sour cream. only thing is that the zucchini REALLY needs to be drained or else it WILL get watery, and they're definitely better when finely grated.

I made these for a BBQ cook off that was Italian theme. I was in tie for 2nd place against the CHEF!But he let me run with it =)And had a few people ask for the recipe. Since it was SOO simple I was able to tell them it right off the top of my head. I did add garlic,and green onion instead of reg.onion only because I goofed that.I used 1 and 1/2 cups of parm. and 1 cup of mozzarella. So yummy!!

Awesome recipe!! kids loved it.
I left out the flour and mozarella cheese. i added bread crumbs instead.
i followed other's suggestions of add salt to grated zucchini and then squeeze it out.
baked it in oven instead of frying and it was yum!!!
Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Everyone I make these for loves them! I highly recommend draining off excess liquid from the freshly grated zucchini as another reviewer recommended. I like to dip mine in ranch dressing.

YUM, YUM, YUM!  And they're prettier than a Georgia peach in a little red wagon plated up.  Served with home grown tomatoes and sour cream.  Definitely a repeat performer!  Followed recipe exactly, but did squeeze water from zucchini as was suggested by one reviewer.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe! I made some modifications: I used 4 medium sized zucchinis to grate, about 1/2 pound of chopped shrimp, added 1 tblspn of fish sauce, 1 cup flour, 3/4 c mozarella, 3/4 c grated parmesan, 3 eggs, and salt to taste, and 1/4 c onions. And for the sauce I made tempura sauce that I also found on allrecipes.com. Thanks!

I performed the recipe as written exactly.  They were very good, but would benefit from some Italian seasoning or seasoned breadcrumbs like others have suggested.  I made a triple recipe and used six eggs.  I probably should have gone with only 4 or 5.  The consistency was more like a frittata.  I will definitely play with this recipe to get a drier crisper product. They are best on the first day when they are crisp, but still very edible on subsequent days. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so good. I substituted Italian bread crumbs for the flour and baked it in a 9x9 pan for about 30 min. at 375 degrees. It helps tremendously to drain the zucchini before mixing other ingredients...very tasty.

I made this gluten-free by subbing a few tablespoons of corn starch and also added a mashed potato (no butter or milk, just the cooked, peeled potato).  I ground up some GF bread made w/ almonds and breaded the patties with this.
The non-GF members of the family rated these very highly as well as us GF eaters.  
Yum!

These were really good, HOWEVER, I used way too much oil. My Husband said they were great except for the oil taste.  I was scared they would stick!! lol

Delicious! I topped them with just grape tomatoes like the picture shows and the flavor was great. No need for sour cream or anything else as a topping.

I did make some changes, but the original recipe gave me the tools to make them!!  Added the garlic, used Italian panko and had some leftover egg whites.  Made little patties out of some of it....fried in canola oil.....made a few little "meatballs" and baked at 400 for 20 min.....just to try different cooking style.  Both were great.  Hubby loved the fried (I did,too, but didn't want the calorie!!)  Served them with wwheat angel hair pasta and thick spaghetti sauce!

Good recipe to use up some garden zucchini. I did allow zucchini to rest in frig for 24 hours after shredding so as to allow juice to settle to bottom of bowl. This made the zucchini not too wet. I added some garlic powder and a touch oregano to add some additional flavor besides the onion. I may try adding a pinch of red pepper flakes next time. To cut down on fat I used cooking spray versus frying in oil. Still came out crispy brown on outside and moist inside.

Very good and you can modify them many ways. I substituted corn meal for half the flour and substituted edamame for 1/2 cup of the grated zucchini.

We all absolutely loved it. I made it for the family that came up for my daughters birthday. There were some skeptics that weren't sure about the Zucchini. Even though I doubled the recipe, we ran out. I couldn't make them fast enough. We topped them with fresh Pico de Gallo mild salsa but they were just fine without it.

Thank you Sherlie, this was just what I was looking for to use up some of my garden veggies, and impress the in-laws.

This is an excellent idea as a side dish! I added, 1 3 oz pckg. pepperoni, chopped, 3 TBSP corn starch, and used 1/2 of a sweet onion. I didn't have any Parmesan on hand so I used 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar in it's place. I served it with diced fresh tomatoes.

Very good recipe but I do agree w/other reviewers about tweaking it a bit. I added a clove of pressed garlic and some black pepper next time I might try some paprika too. We put the sour cream on top but I think we'll try a good tomato sauce next time. Very good base recipe thank you.

Hi: 
I didn't read the reviews before making this recipe and as a result my 'patties' were falling apart as they were  too soggy/wet from the zucchini. Definitely recommend getting all the moisture out first. 
I compensated for moisture by adding some flax meal and cornstarch. Also, added some fresh crab chopped from my food processor, some Tabasco sauce, more onion and lots of garlic as others mentioned, as well as used parsley and green onions from my garden, then some very flavorful Dubliner Irish cheese along with the Parmesan and about a Tablespoon of chili powder. For the leftovers tomorrow I'm also adding some of my home dehydrated bell peppers! Although they are still falling apart from being too moist they taste TERRIFIC!

These were ok.  I made the recipe as directed and fried up a batch.  They were a little bland.  Still had some of the mixture in the bowl so I added some Italian seasoning to it and that helped.  Still not great.  probably won't make again.

Fantastic!  Might try it with some potato mixed in too, but is already good as is.

This was a delicious way to fix Zucchini.  I use to make fried Zucchini by cutting them into wheels and dipping them in batter---but this recipe was a much easier way to get the same delicious effect.

Very similar to something my grandmother made for us as kids.   I doubled the recipe and used up two large zucchinis.   Right now we are getting a new zucchini every other day from the garden.   Use panko crumbs to give it texture.   (about a half cup).  Add some garlic powder and some chopped red pepper.   My final add was chopped fresh basil.

Great recipe!  The only thing I changed was to use onion salt instead of regular salt & a small amount of bread crumbs included in with the flour measure.  I served with sour cream and my husband and I ate them all in one sitting...they were that good!

These are excellent and even better leftover! My daughter has a wheat allergy, so I used gluten free all purpose baking mix in place of the flour, and they turned out just as good. Our whole family loved them. :)

9 years later and still a great basic recipie! I did it according to directions, except I made 6 inch patties which yielded 6 patties total, did not salt (cheese has enough) and added pepper. I have a gas stove and used a very large skillet. My setting started st 7 and half way through the patties I turned it down to 6. I put the new patties on the cool side of the pan and waited until both sides were firmed up, then transferred to the hot side to brown. I am a vegetarian and have been since birth and it's rare that I get to eat patties that taste so good and don't cost so much. Home made is where it is at, and the recipe was way easy.

Eat them while they're hot!  Not near as good once they've begun cooling off.

Made these the other night with some zucchini a friend gave me from her garden and they were so good.  I couldn't stop eating them.  Next time I'll add some garlic and Mrs. Dash for a little extra flavor.

Great way to use up a lot of zucchini from the garden.  Served with fresh salsa and sour cream.  The kids even like it because they look a little like pancakes.

Very good!  I used Kentucky Kernel Seasoned flour. I did squeeze out the excess water from the zucchini.  Used my iron skillet on the suggested medium high heat. With an iron skillet, you can turn the heat down as you continue to make your batches. Iron skillets hold their heat.      Tasted like Potato Patties!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were awesome just as the recipe reads! I didn't get 12...I guess I made mine too big. I used an ice cream scoop. It made 8...but they are so good! Will definitely make again! Thanks.

Great starter recipe! I chose to use less oil which was finefor my iron skillet. Also, I used gluten-free flour but it was a little too runny for my taste so I added some leftover mashed potatoes. YUM!! I will make this again & experiment with adding other things.

I'm on low carb diet, so I subbed ground pork skins for flour. I inadvertently added too much egg, so it turned out like zucchini quiche. Still pretty good!

Very good. Nice and cheesy. A little liquidy, so I went with only 2 tbsp. flour and 2/3 cup Panko breead crumbs. Also added 2 cloves chopped garlic, oregano, parsley and basil for a bit of an Italian flavour. Will defienetely make again

These turned out okay, but seemed like too much work for what you get.  My husband liked them especially with Tomato sauce. We even used them in quesadillas which were even better in my opinion!

Enjoyed these!  After reading the reviews, I determined to eliminate as much of the water from the grated zucchini as possible... did this by squeezing handfuls of it over the sink... worked very well/fast.

My sister copied this recipe out of a magazine  about 10 years ago and she made them, they were so good. I found this recipe through my email  from allrecipes and I was so excited I haven"t had them in forever, they tasted just like I remembered :)

These are amazing! The only things different that I did was to use whole wheat flour, and I substituted grated cheddar for the mozzarella. So yummy!

Really yummy and easy to make. I followed the suggestion of the poster who said to substitute instant potato flakes for the flour, and I'm glad I did. The potato gave the patties a nice crunch to them. My only caution for those making this recipe is to keep an eye on the patties, they cook super fast and can go from done to burned in a matter of seconds.

Delicious!  I just added about 1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs to prevent them from being too runny and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  Can't wait to make them again!

I found your recipe in the Allrecipes Cookbook.  Awesome!  I added salt, pepper & some garlic powder.  I didn't have any mozzarella so I used some Mexican cheese.  They fried up perfect!  I can't wait for my husband to try them, but if he doesn't get home soon,  I'm afraid they will be gone!  Excellent recipe!!

Very good. But you must drain the zucchini very well for it to form a good patty.  I used Italian Bread crumbs as others suggested.

Excellent followed the recipe exactly except I grated the onion instead of chopped. Did not add a thing extra and did not need to drain the zucchini. Will absolutely make again.

I tried this for the first time 2 weeks ago and it was SOOOO good with marinara sauce, made it again and it was one of the worst foods ive ever tasted!  cooked it the exact same way and it never cooked on the stove, just was mush, tried baking it in the over for 30-40 min, and it was just inedible.  seriously doubt ill try this again!

I think this is a good base recipe, but is NOT good as-is. I had to smother it in marinara sauce to make it edible. Not sure why this got such high ratings.

A great idea for using zucchini, but rather bland as written.  I added black pepper, garlic powder, and parsley.  I also tried to drain a lot of moisture from the zucchini so the patties would form.  These taste great with some marinara sauce on the side for dipping.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm always looking for ways to add veggies to my diet. To make it a little healthier, I just used less cheese and oil. And I made sure to drain them well! I served them with a little pasta sauce and they were great! I think these would be a great appetizer for a dinner party!

This is an "interesting" creation.  It tastes alright but I wasn't overwhelmed.  It's not all that healthy either.  I probably won't make this again, but I would consider it.

Delicious. I love this recipe. I used instant mashed potato flakes in place of the flour. Next I am going to try adding some diced fresh jalapeno to give these a little kick.

I was trying to find a recipe that was similar to zucchini patties I'd had in LA.  This was very close, but a bit too much batter for me.  They were good, but next time I think I'll use less batter so the zucchini stands out more.  I served it with sour cream and my husband loved them.  Even my 4 and 5 year olds ate them.

Loved these! took the advice of others, drained water, more egg, half bread crumbs half flour, 3 cloves garlic chopped. I also added a chopped red bell pepper for color and flavor. Delish!

These turned out great and delicious.  I coated with Panko crumbs, which gave them a little 'crunch'.  I suggest trying different cheeses, just as some of the other reviews had mentioned.  Spice it up with some parsley, cilantro, or other fresh herbs.

loved these.  Only change was to add 1tbsp of chopped garlic.  I used a small cookie scoop to get a uniform shape. I didn't even drain the zucchini.

3 stars as-is, this is a great base recipe but needs tweaking to taste as it is VERY bland. i made a half recipe, cooked 1 patty as is to try, then added chili powder, LOTS of garlic, parsley, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and extra flour (even after squeezing the excess liquid from the zucchini) cuz it was still way too liquid-y.

Um...delicious!  I chose this because I thought zucchini would be healthy, but with all this cheese probably not, haha.  But it was worth it- so tasty!  Served with a little marinara for dipping.

I followed the recipe except I didn't add onion because of the kids, but I did add finely chopped red pepper.  It was okay, served with pizza sauce (that's what I had on hand).  Next time, I will add the onion and maybe add more salt than I did the first time.

Alot of skeptics when I tried this.  Not an everyday side dish but a nice compliment.  I made it with scalloped potatoes and grilled barbeque chicken.  Everyone agreed it turned out good.  I took the advice of others and added garlic powder.  Will make again!

Im eating them as I write this comment, they are really good and cheesy. Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. They were really easy to make and fast too, it took me less than 30 minutes to make them and start eating them... and I don't even have one of those electric shredder thingys. I recommend them specially for those days that you need something fast. I accompanied the patties with sliced tomato and I sprinkled some pepper and salt on them, yummy for my tummy!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. It turned out really well. My husband loved it (5 stars) and I thought it was really good (4 stars). I did change some things based on the other reviews. I squeezed the liquid out of the zucchini after I grated it. I didn't have any onion so I added some onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. I used whole wheat flour and only about 3/4 c of cheese total. I used only about a drop of olive oil for every three patties and supplemented with non stick spray. I'll definitely make these again.

Terrific!! I mostly stuck with the recipe instructions but took the advice of other members and doubled the cheese, added chopped garlic and mushroom, some cayenne (which really gave the patties a great zip), and rolling them in Italian breadcrumbs before frying them up. Sooo good, can't wait to try them again with different cheeses and spices! (As a sidenote, I didn't have any issues with draining the zuc, though I did squeeze out a fair amount of remaining liquid by hand after letting it sit while I made a grocery run.)

LOVED these. I substituted the 1/2 cup of flour with 1 tablespoon for flour and 1/3 cup italian breadcrumbs as suggest by other users. I used egg beaters instead of eggs, reducted fat parmesean, fat free mozarella and light margarine instead of oil to make it less in calories. Still amazing! Will make quite often. Thanks!!!

These patties were fantastic!  What a great use for all the zuccini we have in the summer.  Made them last night with only a few changes:  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the flour and added some garlic powder, s&p and tiny amount of red pepper powder.  My family couldn't get enough and told me to quadruple the recipe next time!  Thanks Sherlie for a great summer side!

Amazing!  I followed the advice of a fellow reviewer and omitted the flour and used dry plain mashed potato mix instead with some italian bread crumbs until I got a nice consistency and OMG!  My husband and I devoured it in no time.  We had it with brown rice and it needed no sauce. Eating it with brown rice made it almost like a delicious zucchini risotto. Cheesy and yummy and healthy!  I never leave reviews but had to with this one :-)

I grated the zucchini and put salt over it and put in colander to take out water (like another member suggested).  I doubled the recipe and added 2 cups of Cilantro, some basil, taco seasoning, pepper, serrano chili pepper, 2 tbsp. minced garlic.  I used pepper jack cheese in place of mozzarella. I made a sauce -- 1 tbsp - 2 tbsp butter, 1-2 tbsp flour, sauteed garlic & onion with flour & butter - added 1 - 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes, fresh oregano & fresh basil, pepper.  It was fantastic!

WOW. The family, even the kids, LOVED these. I had a bit more mozz cheese and 2 T bread crumbs. I seasoned the mixture with garlic powder, pepper and parsley and left out the onion because I didn't have any. INCREDIBLE!

Excellent!!  I squeezed the liquid from the zucchini with a potato ricer - worked like a charm.  Then rather than chopping onion, I shreded it. - This was fantastic!!

These were excellent! I served as a side with our roast beef dinner and were complimented very nicely with the strong horseradish! I did as other revievers recommended and squeezed as much of the juices out of the grated zuchinni as I could. I also added a ton of chopped garlic, fresh cracker black pepper, some parsely and rosemary leaves as we like our food heavily seasoned. I pan-fried until just golden brown in the afternoon and then just popped them in the oven on a cookie sheet to re-heat before serving with dinner.

Wonderful recipe. I didn't have any mozzarella, but I substituted some shredded cheddar. I thought I read in a review to substitute bread crumbs for the flour, but it was still very wet. I ended up adding another 1/4 cup of flour. Do not use too much oil or they don't set right. Delicious with sour cream.

Very good recipe. Will definitely make again. Tweaked the recipe a tad: as others suggested I squeezed the shredded zucchini to get as much water as I could out of them (for like 3 minutes total [don't stress about it]); I also cooked the onion (and garlic, and red pepper [and imaginably anything else you want]) a little in some olive oil before putting in with the zucchini/egg/flour/etc. Other than that, I followed the recipe and got 6 nice sized patties out of it all. I also put salsa on top of the patties I ate, which gave them a nice flavor, although they tasted very good and cheesy alone.   Good recipe. Bravo!

I love these!!!! I didn't have everything on hand, but that's what's so cool about this recipe too, you can alter it if you want to or have to. I'm sure had I followed the recipe exactly, it would've been perfect! I've been looking for a recipe like this for a while. Thank You!!

YUM! I didn't have an onion on hand so I added some minced garlic and onion powder. And in place of the Mozzarella cheese I used Colby Jack becase that's what  I had. After reading some reviews, I drained some of the excess water out of the grated zucchihi and added some Italian Bread Crumbs for extra flavor & crisp. You can really play with this recipe! My husband is a very picky eater and turned his nose up at the steamed zucchini I made the other night, but he enjoyed these :) Will make again & again!

These were delicious, but I made some changes, so I can't give 5 stars.  First, I left out the mozzarella and replaced the flour with italian breadcrumbs and the onion with onion powder.  They were just OK hot.  They were even better cold the next day!!  They remind me of my grandmother's "Zucchini Pie" that she used to make with Bisquick.  Absolutely delicious and I will be making them again with the changes that I made.

This recipe was over all pretty good! Instead of using tomato sauce to dip them in, I used ketchup.  The thing that I really liked about this recipe was the fact that you can eat it whenever, breakfast because it has a lot of eggs, or with dinner.  My best friend made these with me, she's a vegetarian and absolutely loved them, so she stole the recipe.

SO GOOD!  A really great way to use up some of that zucchini that keeps appearing in the garden.  Even my young kids liked them.  The only change I made was to substitute feta cheese for the parmesan.  It really added a nice flavor.  I also used a cast iron skillet, which got them nice and brown and crispy on the outside.  We will make again for sure.

Very tasty. I added oregano and garlic and omitted onion since the kids don't like it. They loved it. We dipped ours in pizza sauce since that's all I had. Even my two year old asked for seconds!

I enjoyed these very much. I also tweaked the recipe by adding less cheese, more flour, and bread crumbs to thicken them up into more of a zucchini latka. I will definitely be making these again.

My kids and I loved these.  I used 1/2 white 1/2 brown rice flour mixture instead of the wheat and they turned out great.  We also used red onion and as others suggested, squeezed out quite a bit of the water before adding the zucchini.  I will definately be making these again.

This is definitely one of those keeper recipes.  I found it works for yellow summer squash, too.  Thanks for sharing this!  We're at that stage of the garden where it's hard to find a use for all of the zucchini.

I REALLY liked these  - however they need some additional seasoning.  I'll for sure be making these again, great way to use up the zucchini in the garden and an excellent side dish.

These were great! I served them as an appetizer with marinara sauce on top. Even my picky husband- who HATES vegetables- loved these. I did try to drain the zucchini a bit in a flour sifter after I grated it. I only needed to use about 1/2 a tablespoon of oil.

Made these when my toddler refused to eat any veggies.  Added seasoned breadcrumbs and cubed mozzarella... He gobbled them right up.  I could not believe it!  Then I tasted how delicious they turned  out!  They are a new family favorite.

I made this recipe last night, and it is delish! Definitely a keeper. I didn't even add any toppings, it was that good. I followed a lot of the suggestions such as substituting some flour with breadcrumbs, adding green onions, garlic and other seasonings etc. I actually only had about 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese, so I used that plus some Asiago cheese. Came out pretty well. I also peeled the zucchini as wasn't sure whether the skin would be too tough. Next time I'll try with unpeeled zucchini. I'm African, so definitely had to spice it up with some Cayenne pepper, and different seasonings...a pinch of this and that. We don't measure, just eyeball and go off of taste, so couldn't really tell you what worked. Oh, and I also forgot to beat the eggs before adding, but it still turned out okay. They were soft and I had to be careful so they didn't fall apart...maybe I needed to squeeze the grated zucchini dry just a little bit more. I will definitely be making again, and adding as a regular item on the menu. And hey, the best part is, since I went off of taste and 'eyeballin' for the seasonings, it could come out slightly different each time, thus keeping it fresh and 'new'...LOL.

Delicious delicious delicious..... I did add chopped garlic, chopped green chili, some pepper and parsley. I took advice from other reviews and added some bread crumbs and potato flakes instead of flour and also spread some bread crumbs on top before cooking. Patties were so we just used little sour cream and yummmm.

So good and easy to fix.  I used potato flakes instead of flour; and I added garlic, red pepper and Italian seasoning.  I also used dried onions.  I tried some dipped in bread crumbs before I fried them, but my family liked it better without the crumbs.

Excellent recipe! They were delicious. Very easy to make, and all the proportions are just right. I'd use a little more oil, so that the patties don't stick to the pan (if you are using a cast iron pan).

Seriously AMAZING!  I had a hard time with getting all the liquid out of the zucchini so I added more flour and it worked fine.  My kids ATE IT UP!

These were super duper yummy. We have zucchini coming out our ears so I am looking for recipes to use it up. I added some garlic powder and seasoning salt and I cooked it a little longer on a lower temp. My parents and they're friends loved them and now want the recipe. Thanks for sharing Sherlie.

Such a great idea for zucchini other than the normal fried zucchini.  I did not differ from the receipe.  Perfect as is.  Family really enjoyed these!  Thanks for sharing.

EXCELLENT!  My husband rarely ever compliments my cooking and he said these were great!  I made some revisions to the original recipe and listened to the other reviews(esp. about draining the zucchini and adding italian breadcrumbs).  I also used cheddar instead of mozzarella.  Very very good and will be making these again!!

I made these to take to a cookout and everyone loved them ! I served them with blue cheese dressing to dip into. After reading the other reviews I also added a few little twists of my own which is the best part of this recipe. It is so adaptable. I added another egg and changed the flour to 1/4 C and added 1/2 C Italian bread crumbs. I also added some chopped red pepper,   minced garlic and fresh parsley. They were outstanding. I'm making another batch to freeze for later, this time I'm adding "crab"(2 cans drained), not enough to call it a crab cake but enough to make it awesome.

Excellent recipe! Make sure you really drain the zucchini. I pushed as much out as I could in the colander and then wrapped it up in cheesecloth and squeezed more of the juice out. Also make sure to add plenty of seasonings in this or it will be really bland. We loved it!

Great flavor and I loved the marinara sauce idea...but wish they stayed crispy or even got more crispy in the first place. I would dust the pattie with flour or breadcrumbs first to get a better coating so that they can crisp up.

Excellent recipe. I used almond meal instead of flour (avoiding refined carbs) and added a little red pepper. Very tasty.

So good! I can't tell you how good. Did take some others suggestions, used 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 flour mixture. I will never use all the zucchini I get from friends and family to make bread (which I love) anymore.

I improvised loosely on this recipe, I added garlic and used spring onions since that was what I had on hand... added italian breadcrumbs, and used smoked gouda instead of mozzarella (again, what was in my fridge)  came out delicious, although more hashbrowny than in the picture...  we all loved it, including my 3.5 year old daughter, she ate a ton of this

Amazing Basic Recipe. Modify and you can't go wrong. MY MODIFICATION: I had 3 cobs of corn I didn't want wasted. Used shredded zucchini and added corn as well. Used Equal parts Flour to Corn Flour. Didn't have Mozzarella, used a mild chedder.  Added Salt, ground pepper and garlic powder. Dipping Sauce: Sour Cream with salsa and a bit of fig preserve (wanted a little sweet).

These were delicious.  I did make some alterations like other reviews indicated and added in breadcrumbs.  I also cooked my onion and two cloves chopped garlic in olive oil first and then added that to the mixture.  I served them with a fresh tomato and basil sauce.  These were even great the next day.

these are wonderful! and simple to make, the only difference i made was i used 1 egg and added some garlic and onion powder.  I browned this in a few tablespoons of olive oil, they stayed crispy.  I dipped mine in little ranch dressing! yummy :) I will be making these alot!!

Delicious!  I didn't have Parmesan so I doubled up on the Mozzarella and added a few teaspoons of minced garlic.  Next time I'll try to fry thinner patties so the insides won't be as gooey.  Great way to use up extra zucchini!

It was kind of bland for my taste. Probably won't make again. Use the onions only if you like their taste, I thought they overwhemed the recipe because of the recipe's blandness.

Very good!  I used a mix of zucchini, carrots, and summer squash for the vegetables and drained them between two plates with a weight on top between paper towels after grating.  Threw in some chives and 2 cloves garlic with the onion.  I used half cheddar and half mozzarella for the cheese mix with a few tsps of parmesan.  I subbed some Panko bread crumbs for 1/3 of the flour.  I filled a 1/3-cup measure for each patty and tapped out onto the frying pan, and the patties held together very well.  Served with plain, Greek yogurt.  Delicious, nutritious, easy!

I was very impressed by this recipe.  I did make some changes that were mentioned earlier.  I squeezed out the water from the zucchini by sandwiching the shredded zucchini between sheets of paper towels and using heavy plates for weight.  Cut the flour and add italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Add some chilli flakes if you like a little extra heat.

This is a great base recipe - the proportions are good, but I think that they would be a little bland w/o the modifications suggested by earlier reviewers.  I used Itailan breadcrumbs in mine.  Though, it turned out that I wasn't too keen on how they dominated the flavor so I will probably do half Italian and half plain breadcrumbs next time.  I also added some shredded carrots for color/flavor and because I had them on hand.  Red pepper flakes and some extra garlic were a must for me.  I will definitely do these again with some more tweaking to get them just right.

These were so good! I made them as an appetizer to a pasta dish, and they were a big hit. I was surprised that my almost 4 year old devoured his. I was happy that he was devouring zucchini, but had no idea that's what it was LOL!  I will definitely make these again, but I think I may cut down on the amount of cheese to make them a little healthier.

This became our standard breakfast last summer when I was trying to find out how to hide the zucchini from the garden into as many meals as I could. For a lactose-free version, I replaced the cup of cheese for either a cup of leftover rice or mashed potatoes and whatever fresh herbs that were around at the time. Served with salsa.

I make these for every occasion and everyone loves them! I find that cousa squash (abundant in local stores) tastes better, and also use double the squash with less flour and cheese and only 1 egg to cut the carbs, but they still come out fantastic!

It is so hard for me to make my family eat out of their vegetable comfort zone. I made these a couple of nights ago for my family and I will say, they are going to become a staple in my house. They freeze well and my husband and daugher loved them. I put the pattie in a flat bread warmed up and it was a hit!

These are fantastic and way more filling than I would have guessed. I use onion powder instead of onion because I don't care for onion. I also sprinkle in some cumin.

With just a couple adjustments I really love these! I use about half as much cheese, and a quarter cup more flour, as well as filling my two-cup measuring cup just to the top with zucchini. If you only make one adjustment, just don't add so much cheese, and feel free to mix it up. I like cheddar instead of mozzarella.

This is now our accompaniment to meatballs instead of pasta!  I used several modifications to fit our needs: 1)  Used almost 2x amount of zucchini, salted for 15 min. and then squeezed dry 2)  add 2 cloves minced garlic and some minced parseley, and pepper 3)  used shredded gouda (because I had that on hand)  They are a bit "goopy" to handle at first, but I formed the patties and put them in the freezer for 10-15 min to firm them up.  Turned out fabulous with no leftovers.  Delicious with marinara.

Great way to use up veggies before they go bad! You can make them spicey or cheesey, or packed w/protein and healthy. I dipped mine in red sauce and ate plain. Both ways were yummy.

These were EXCELLENT!!! A bit on the bland side so I added some extra pepper and used a spicy tomato sauce for dipping. They were gone almost as soon as they hit the table. A great cold snack too that reheats well in the oven. Easy and fun to make. Loved it!

These were just okay.  I drained /squeezed the zuchinni well to reduce the moisture first, and I added garlic and Italian-type spices (oregano, basil, etc) to the patties.  But they were rather ho-hum.  I won't make these again.

My extremely picky 3 year old LOVED this!  I was shocked!  I like it as well, but...WOW!  He's eatting it like it's about to run straight off his plate!  I had to sub for a lot because payday is in a week, so I can only imagine how wonderful it would be with all the original ingredients!  Thank you so much!

I used an italian cheese blend instead of the mozzarella and Parmesan separate. I also added onion powder, instead of onion (cause I had none), garlic powder, and some black pepper. I used italian style bread crumbs and it turned out really well!

These came out good, however, I think I would have enjoyed more seasoning. I used two zucchini as it collapses as it sits so what start as one medium really required two to get the required amount.  They only reason I wouldn't try again was that no one else in the family would even try.

I thought this was a good basic recipe with lots of room for experimentation. I used bisquick rather than the flour and added Tony Cachera's original cajun seasoning to give it a little bite. Nice way to use up some zucchini.

I grated the first zucchini and realized that it was a waste of time because they were so wet.  So I chopped the zucchini very thinly instead.  I removed onions because I hate them, but I think some garlic would have added nicely to this recipe.  I'm going to attempt to bake them next time.  I used olive oil, but they still had that fried taste instead of accentuating the vegetable.  I will use this as an appetizer the next time I have guests over!

Good, but could use some more flavor. I will add a little garlic next time. Great way to use the summer zucchini.

Love this recipe! We eat these about once a week during the summer when our zucchini plant is pumping out zucchini. We were out of Mozzarella once so we used Jack instead. Not as yummmy as with the Mozz but still very good. We like to eat ours with apple sauce instead of Marinara sauce.

Definitely will be one of my favorites from now on and I'll make it a lot!  I did make a few changes to fit my own low carb diet, by substituting almond meal for the flour, and I added another egg and onion and garlic powder instead of the onions.  But I didn't want to give it anything but 5 stars because it was just so good!!!!

I am always looking for ways to serve the abundance of zucchini.  My family enjoyed this recipe so much they asked me to make more for the next day. I will double the recipe going forward.  They ate them plain, with salsa and with sour cream.  Sour cream was voted the favorite.

Innovatitve way to eat zucchini.  I followed the recipe, drained salted zucchini and added 1 clove minced garlic.  They were good, but still could have used more flavor so I will add more garlic among other spices next time.

These are terrific.   My husband likes everything with a bite to it so I added red pepper flakes and some chopped jalapeno.    Sometimes I add crushed up Ritz crackers or some Panko bread crumbs.  It would be hard to mess these up.  Thank you Sherlie.

Great recipe.  I added 1/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs though to give a little more body to the patties.  We're terrific!  Made a triple batch and everyone loved them.

Really tasty.  I made these with rice flour so my child who is allergic to gluten could eat these.  I'm glad I did!  These are her new favorite food - she ate 7 patties for lunch one day, then 3 more while she was waiting for dinner.  We eat them with marinara sauce.  I think they make a great meal, veggies, protein and a bit of grains all in one bite.  The cheeses are also very versatile.  I followed the recipe the first time, but was out of parmesan the next time I made them, so I subbed feta, and they were still delicious.  Thanks!!

I added garlic powder and substituted 1/2 of the flour with seasoned bread crumbs.  AWESOME!  I am going to make 200 of these and freeze them individually for quick microwave snacks all winter!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delish!!! I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to use up zucchinis and this recipe certainly fulfilled that requirement.  I did not change any of the ingredients.  Perhaps the next time I will add some garlic.  This is a keeper!!

Not sure what we did wrong- but the batter was super runny and the cakes fell apart while cooking...some we had to fry three or four times. Husband refused to eat, I had a couple, and threw the rest out. Sorry! Not a keeper for us, but good concept!

Made these last night as we have so much zucchini, this time of year.  They were really wonderful. The only change I made was I added 1/2 c chopped onion, and used Cheddar cheese in place of Mozz.  Excellent use of zucchini!

I have had this recipe for a while and would like to add a little bit to this. If you shake out some (how much is up to you) crushed dried red pepper into this recipe before you fry it up, you will see the taste improves and has a little bite or spice to it.  Otherwise it is an excellent recipe, everyone loves it, and a great way to use up a large amount of zucchini in a short time :)

These were delicious and easy, and my mother, who knows I can't cook, liked them too! I added two huge cloves of garlic (minced), and for the cheese I had the "pizzaria" Kraft blend (from making pizza, it's mozz, prov, parm) so I just used 1 cup of that. Also I didn't use up all the mix yet (make them as we want them) but I'm definitely going to get more than 4. I think they need salt/pepper though, and I might throw in some italian spices on the next. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Crispy brown crust, great taste. I added 1/2 tsp oregano and used 1/2 cup bisquick mix instead of flour. I also salted my zucchini and drained off the water and rinsed  before mixing, no watery batter. Great recipe.

The first batch was a bit bland, but after adding a bit more salt, some fresh ground pepper, garlic, and red pepper flakes, perfect! Served hot with sour cream or as a side dish to eggs, they were gone in minutes! I also used non-stick spray instead of oil on the second batch. This made them less greasy, beautiful & crispy.

So good!  I drain the zucchini very well.  This recipe tweaks very well to suit individual tastes (but we like it as written) Thank you

These are wonderful! The only thing I did different was to add jack cheese instead of mozz. because that is what I had. I husband and son who won't touch zucchini loved these. In fact I knew they wouldn't even try these had they known that they were zucchini so I told them they were potato pancakes. When they finished them off and commented on how delicious they were, I told them that they were made with zucchini. They liked them so much that they both took them cold to work the next day for lunch. Great way to use up some of the abundant zucchini! Edit: I've been making these for years and just this last time I squeezed out all the water from the zucchini before mixing everything together. What a difference! I will never skip that step again. Also, I used a couple Tbsp. of brown rice flour instead of the white flour and it worked great. Couldn't tell the difference. Now they are gluten-free!

My husband was like - "I'm not sure about these", but he thinks meat has to be involved in every meal to like it. I thought they were very good and so did my sister-in-law and my daughter (one year old). And at the end of the meal, there were none left, I even made extra than the recipe called for for 4 servings.

I shredded my zucchini in the food processor, then following Annabelle's brilliant suggestion, spun it dry using my salad spinner and gave it a final pat dry.  The instant mashed potatoes sounded interesting, but I was nervous about the substitution, so I used 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup instant mashed potatoes.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and cooked them on my electric griddle.  They were wonderful! (I even ate one cold the next day, and it was good, too.)

These were very good! I took the advice of others and added garlic and a few different veggies(red pepper, corn, mushrooms). Also, because I needed space on the stovetop to cook other things, I cooked them in the pan so they were slightly under and then put them under the griller/broiler(on medium/low) and they came out superb!

These patties were very good! I think I will play around with the seasoning in these, maybe add some cilantro. Thank You Sherlie!  Update:10-25-09. I made these again last night and the first batch did not turn out well. I had added too much zucchini and they went all over the pan plus I added Way too much oil. Silly mistakes. I regrouped, drained some oil in a bowl,for future use. I added more flour to the batter and that was the ticket! They stayed together, browned up beautifully and tasted Fabulous!! I used a Mexican cheese called Cotija. It is a dry cheese, in place of the Parmesan, really good and tasty. I served them with a pico de gallo,(fresh salsa) and Mexican crema(sour cream).

I thought the taste of these patties are heavenly.  Good as left overs also. My husband is not a zucchini lover but he did eat a few of them, with no complaints. Just a nice change from the regular zucchini recipes.

I made these last year, so when the zucchini was ready to pick my husband reminded me of these patties and requested them.  I had to log on and find the recipe again.  We love them as is, but I sometimes add some grated carrot to them.  I think I might try some other seasonings occasionally but my husband is satisfied with them as is.

Different, they were okay but probably won't be making them again. We used tomato soup and it helped as the patties were pretty bland themselves.

I would have made these as is if I had the right cheeses on hand.  I have no doubt this recipe is perfect as stated!  I only had cheddar so I used a cup of that in place of the other cheeses.  We just these patties as a side with steaks.  They are sooo good.  My son who was just complaining about eating zucchini couldn't get enough.  I would even serve these with breakfast I think the zucchini gives a better flavor than potatoes.  Thank you!  I will never lose this recipe.

These were sooo yummy! Had a GIANT zucchini from my father in law's garden and used it on these. Had a little trouble in the beginning getting them to cook and stay together, but added a little more flour and higher heat, and they came out crispy and delicious!

One word - AWESOME! These were so good, everyone raved about them. The only thing I did differently was add a touch more flour than called for and a bit of garlic salt. I will definitely be making these again and will be freezing some of our zucchini crop this year so we can have them all winter! Thanks for this yummy recipe!

These turned out really good.  I made a few changes as per other reviews.  Used some Italian bread crumbs in place of some of the flour (about 1/2 & 1/2).  Used Italian mix of grated cheese because that's what I had on hand.  Also about a tsp. of red pepper flakes for a kick.  Also, coated in the bread crumbs before frying in olive oil.  They were yummy and see lots of possibilities for sauces to put on them.  I just ate them plain the first time but I have leftovers and think I might try a little salsa and sour cream on them.

DELICIOUS!  i used bread crumbs and potato flakes instead of the flour and used a blend of parmesan/asiago/cheddar/mozzarella cheeses. Definitely drain as much moisture as you can from the zucchini. Sprinkle with bread crumbs before frying for a nice crispy crust. we served them with a tomato cream sauce along side salmon and grilled veggies. they were a hit to say the least.

Have been using a similar recipe for years. Drained zucchini, sauted onions, added garlic, but no cheeses. Looking forward to making it with cheese. This is a great recipe no matter how you tweak it.

Usually I like anything vegetables.  I'm not sure what the consistency is supposed to be on this, but I found I didn't like how it was still a little mushy inside like if you undercook a pancake, not firm like a quiche. If I hold it up vertically it flops over.  I did follow exactly, but judging from other reviews it's probably just me.

These were good. I'll preface by saying I did change the cooking method and baked instead, so I don't want to be harsh, but I think there was some spice lacking. I added the parsley, pepper, garlic and used less flour more breadcrumbs. It was good, and a good way to get the kids to eat some veggies that they could dip.

these were pretty good, although i would use only 1 egg and less flour...or try the potato flakes that someone else mentioned.  it was a little too "crepe-y" for me.  i also forgot to drain the zucchini, oops.  i think this would go really well with a cucumber dill sauce.  i will try it next time!

These were amazing, even my carnivore-loving husband couldn't get enough of these.  I used both squach and zucchini.  I also substituted whole wheat flour for regular flour.  Next time, I will try to fry in olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

These were delicious! I took another reviewers suggestion and added mushrooms, minced garlic, black pepper, and some breadcrumbs to the mix. We ate them with marinara sauce. My husband loved these. A nice change of pace for a side dish. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were OK, nothing too special (rather tasteless) but were a good side dish with some sour cream.

They were great.  I'm not giving it a 5 because they could be better.  I added a little bit of garlic and pepper to the mix prior to frying.  Good way to get a kid to eat a vegetable!

Fabulous!  With so many extra zucchini these days I'm always looking for new ways to use them and this was a great change.  Even my vegetable-hating son ate them.

Super quick and easy, made a great side dish, although I'm not sure I'd like to eat an entire meal of them.

Simple and easy comfort food that's almost good for you! When I make these, I grate the zucchini by hand and then squeeze as much water out as I can through a dish towel / cheese cloth. (My mom forgot to do this once, and the patties were too mushy.) I also use about half the recommended amount of Parmesan (a little goes a long way) and add a dash of garlic powder.

These were so good my 7-year-old grandson ate 4 of them and pushed his roast beef to the side of the plate. He said he'd rather eat these! My husband really liked them too. Very easy to make. 

I added about 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic and used shredded cheddar cheese because that is what I had on hand. Didn't add salt like someone in another review suggested, because of the salt content in cheese. 

Oh yeah...and I really liked them too. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

Wow, these are soooo good!  Following advice from previous users I dried the zuc a little using a paper towel.  Instead of frying in oil I cooked these on my Foreman Grill, they came out perfect and didn't stick at all!  I'll definately make these again, maybe bite sized as an appetizer or serve them with brunch.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! Super easy to make. I don't think you need to add any breadcrumbs as others stated, my mixture was pretty runny and it formed in to great patties once you cook them. I cooked them one at a time in a small frying pan because I was cooking other things at the time and didn't have room for a big pan. A guest didn't hear what was in them and thought they were just big cheesy patties, he couldn't believe they were mostly zucchini! We had them with marinara sauce and they really did taste like giant cheese sticks! Yummy!!

Yum Yum Yum! These were so delicious and so simple to make. I grated the zuchini, onions, some garlic (not in the recipe but thought I would add it) and the cheese all in the food processor. I did find that the mixture was a bit wet. Not so much that I wouldn't have been able to shape them into patties, but I added a few tablespoons of bread crumbs anyway. I didn't even need any salt because the cheese had enough salt in it. I served them topped with our favorite spaghetti sauce, but next time, I will serve them plain. They were really tasty all on their own. I will be making this recipe again and again.

YUMMO!!! These patties are so good. I did add a little extra flour and used cooking spray instead of oil. Very good. It does take longer than 20 minutes to cook since only 4-5 patties fit in the pan at once.

I loved it.  My husband suggested next time to chop the onions up finely, he didn't care for the larger chopped size.  I had one right after they were made and had to leave, so when I came home later that evening, I threw the leftovers into my toaster oven on the pan and set it to medium.  In the time it took the "toast" cycle, they were recrisped up and I polished them all off.  It was AWESOME reheated this way, makes a crisp crunch, not a soggy greasy mess like the microwave would have.  Will make again and again!

These are absolutely delicious!  I tried to grill them to be a bit healthier, but that was a disaster and they started melting through the grate.  I scooped up what I could a fried little patties.  Well worth the bit of oil they absorb.  My new favorite use for zucchini!

I made these last summer and my family LOVED them.  This year my husband is working for the local radio station.  The station manager always has an over abundance of zucchini so he brought some home with the request, "Can you make Zucchini Patties for the station?"  So this morning I did.  They couldn't stop raving about them on the air.  They were even eating and talking at the same time.  The recipe has been requested by many.  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

Very good, and versatile. I made mine a bit more Southwestern in style, only because those were the ingredients I had on hand. I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella and added a cup of frozen corn (defrosted) since I didn't have quite enough zucchini and tossed in a couple cloves of minced garlic. Served them with salsa -- they were a nice hearty side dish with grilled turkey tenderloin. They weren't bad warmed up the next day, either.  I have also made these with just corn, scraping the kernels off of a couple leftover ears. They reminded me of Grandma's corn fritters.

I really enjoyed these.  I made them much thiner than the picture so they were very crispy, and I added salt to each patty as soon as it came out of the pan.  A very yummy way to use zucchini.  My super picky toddler even ate some.

I just made these tonight for a casual dinner party.  Everyone loved them.  There were a few left over and I plan to reheat them and serve them for breakfast with sour cream and applesauce.  Delicious.

Time consuming and very bland, it really needs something. I don't think I would make it again.

These were pretty good but warning they are VERY heavy! Two and I was completely stuffed.  They taste good covered with marinara.

I was trying to find a better way to fry up squash quickly but with not as much mess as frying a pan of battered slices at a time and I have found the best way possible in this recipe and wonderful flavor. They go great with any meal.

My entire family,including 2 vegetarians and grandson, loved this recipe. I doubled it.  For the meat eaters I fixed fish to go along with it and used salsa as a topper if they wanted it. I also used potato flakes instead of flour, my daughter is allergic to flour, and added extra potato flakes to absorb the liquid from the squash, so no need to drain the squash. my daughter ate the 2 left over patties on gluten free toasted bread with mustard the next day and loved it.

These were tasty, but I'm not sure if the cheeses worked properly.  It could just depend on the cheese you use.  I think mine ended up a bit too wet and thin.  Tasted good, though.

These are very easy and great but to be honest--I didn't much care for these freshly made--they tasted way better the next day when I reheated them.  
Thanks for adding something new to do with vegetables and something else for vegetarians to try.

This recipe, as is, is very bland! But the flour and cheese help bind the zucchini- I will combine this with the 'crab cakes' recipe and see how it works.

My husband really liked these, but I found the cheese and the frying a little too heavy for my taste.  I think if you like fried foods, then you will approve of the taste and I could see how kids might gobble them up.

Very tasty.  I added a three cheese blend instead of just parm.  I also cooked on a cast iron skillet with no added oil.  The kids had trouble with them due to the shredded zuc and not able to take bites, but us grown ups really enjoyed them.

A tasty was to use up a surplus of zucchini.  My hubby enjoyed these.  I omitted the mozzarella and used grated parmesan cheese (not the dry shaker kind, but the bagged kind.)

These were really tasty after adding more spices.  I used one fairly small zucchini, and cut the rest in half.  I also added Lowrey's season salt, garlic powder and a dash of red pepper.  I threw the zucchini in my food processor for a quick chopping and I guess I should have let it sit in a strainer for awhile as these ended up being very wet and when I flipped them, they fell apart.  They still tasted great but need to get rid of the liquid. Update:  I tried using less egg but they still fell apart.  Anyone have any advice??

This was very good.  Nice way to use zucchini.  Husband and friends loved it.  Did as others and drained the zucchini to get out excess water. Added peppers and garlic. Used half parm. cheese and half romano.  Thank you very much.  Will be keeping this one.

These were all right.  I was looking for a way to use up my garden bounty of zucchini and found this recipe.  It was quite a bit of work for the end result.  I think next time I will just fry the zucchini.

These patties are fantastic!  I've made them several times and each time I've served them to friends/family I've been asked for the recipe!  Even my brother and my husbands best friend left my home with the recipe in hand!!

I followed the recipe minus the onions as we aren't big fans and I didn't have any on hand.

I felt the patties were pretty bland. I couldn't really taste any one distinctive flavor yet all of the flavors didnt seem 'melded' together. Not sure what it needs but it does need something.

This was excellent!  However, I did make one alteration:  I used bleu cheese instead of mozzerella.  Absolutely scrumptious!

Great recipe - just a little too much raw onion for my taste so I decided to use minced dry onion the next time.

These were good, but next time I will add some other ingredients to them as some of the other reviewers have said.  I always make a new recipe exactly like it states first, and then make any adjustments the next time.

Very very good.  I took other reviewers advice and added Bisquick mix instead of flour.  I found they were very easy to cook when formed into flatter patties first.  I also minced the onion and added garlic powder and oregano.

Needs help. We added Italian Seasoning, as suggested, but it still doesn't make the grade. These were to wet & not as good as Connie's Zucchini Crab Cakes (on this website). Connie's Zucchini Crab Cakes are 5 stars & delicious (& doesn't use crab meat).

I fondly remember my mom cooking zucchini patties each summer, and this recipe did not disappoint.  The batter was very thick and easy to work with, and the flavor was good although perhaps a bit bland for some.  My suggestion would be to add some herbs for more flavor; I will need to experiment some more....

This is one of the better recipes I've tried on the site.  This was an amazing main course.  We will definitely be having this on a regular basis.  We tried both pasta sauce and sour cream as topping and both worked well.

Pretty good, but a bit bland (as zucchini can be). I added 2 small cloves of garlic and 1/4 tsp of pepper the second time I made it and it was really good.

Amazing.  I certainly recommend using a non-stick pan to fry them up.  Great with sour cream, totally different experience with tomato sauce.  Wonderful side or entree.

We thought these were great.  I used purple onion, because that was all I had, but I think next time I might scale back a bit on the onion.  The first one I cooked, as the guinea pig, was a bit too mushy in the middle, although it was golden brown on the outside.  So I turned the heat down just a bit and let the rest of them cook a little bit longer than is stated in the recipe.  My husband even liked these, and he's not a bit zucchini fan.  Thanks for the great recipe, we'll be making these again.

The flavor was very good but I had trouble frying them- they fell apart and were really hard to flip.  I added some more flour to part of the mixture and that helped a lot.

Very good, but for some reason I couldnt get them to stick together well. I put more flour and I added some breadcrumbs and it still didnt want to stick. But other than that very very good.

VERY GOOD!  I though this recipe was very tastey.  I added half bread crumbs and half flour.  It turned out very cheesey and delightful.  I also added alittle garlic and I coated the patties with bread crumbs before I fried them.  I will be making these again....THANKS

Wonderful!  I added a little more onion and threw in a clove of garlic.  I also skipped the mozza because I didn't have any on hand.  They still turned out great.  I love potato pancakes and this was a unique alternative.

We like these. I substitute cornmeal for the flour and sometimes add green onions or a half-can of creamed corn for variety. Delicious!

My husband loved these.  I made exactly as written and they turned out wonderful....They taste like potatoe pancakes....Served with applesauce and had a lot of compliments.  Good way to use up zucchini from garden.

Easy, fast & very few ingredients.  Was tasty, but needed something. My picky 11 year old loved it paired with spaghetti sauce.  I used cheddar instead of cheeses listed.  I think next time, I'll stick to the Parm.

This cooked up well, but was a little too bland. I would add some minced garlic and red pepper. Also, some cooked bacon bits might liven it up! You probably could use a little more cheese and less flour for those who are trying to cut carbs.

My patties were almost tasteless.  I think the idea is good but they need some spice or something to make them better.  I will make again but after coming up with a few additions.

these were a great snack for watching the brewer's game (GO Brewers). my husband's not big on junkfood, so these were nice to have. he tried pancake syrup, then ketchup on them, and liked the ketchup, but i liked them plain. thanks sherlie.

I liked them, but I don't think I will make them again.  I did some in the oil and some on a hot non-stick skillet and they were both ok so I don't think the extra oil is really necessary.

I. LOVE. YOU. SHERLIE.

This recipe is probably my favorite on this site.  These patties are amazing.  I used cheddar cheese and added quite a bit of salt and pepper as modifiers, but oh my.  I'm certain my veggie-hating boyfriend will love them.  They're simple yet flavorful and satisfying.

Oh yeah! What a way to use up the zucchini in the garden! I like 'em simple, without all these additives, but a bit of garlic always goes down well too!

This was good.  I purged the zucchini with some salt and patted them dry before mixing.  I needed to add a little more flour to the mix as well.  It was good, but still needed a little something, I think next time I will use more pepper & garlic!

I really enjoyed these.  I had everything on hand and decided to try them out.  They were really tasty.  I substituted some garlic because I don't like onions and they were still good.  Next time I will definitely do as others suggested and get more of the water out so they can be crispier.  They were kind of mushy but I was in a hurry and hungry to eat them.

I loved these! I wanted to make them a little healthier so I used egg beaters, nonfat parmesan cheese, and velveeta light. They were wonderful, especially with a little nonfat sour cream. A definite keeper!
