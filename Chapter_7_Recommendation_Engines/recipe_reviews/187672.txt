This was a really excellent bean salad. I made a couple of changes. I decreased the oil to 1/3 cup and added a teaspoon of sugar. Yum!

I made this for my dad and he loved it! I'm usually not a big fan of cold bean salad recipes but I even liked this one. We are big artichoke fans so I added an extra can. Two thumbs up!

This is very easy to put together and makes a nutritional side dish that taste great. If in a big hurry just use bottled dressing.

I made this for a family get together, and I gave it a 3 out of 5 because while some loved it, others hated it. It has a very distinct tangy flavor, so if you're not really into that, I'd say this recipe is not for you.

I tried this recipe because I was was trying to use up some radishes. It seemed like an odd combination of ingredients but I was surprised at how tasty it was. I used slightly less oil and slightly more vinegar.

This was scrumptious!  We made a few small changes due to what was in the cupboards.  Instead of red vinegar we used rice vinegar.  In substitution for radishes we used green pepper and we left out the garbanzo beans.  Thinking of putting in diced avocado with the next batch.  It was SO yummy!

After reading all of the reviews, I too chose to decrease the oil. This turned out really good and is one of the better bean salads I have had. I do think the seasonings in the dressing could stand to be doubled. Canned beans are pretty bland once you rinse and drain them.  I think the artichokes need doubled as well. They are in the recipe title so you expect them to be dominant but they get shadowed by the beans. I wasn't sure how the radishes would pair with the rest of the ingredients but they work good and also add a nice crunch. This is a really good recipe and one that is perfect for a BBQ.

Pretty good. I used 1/3 cup olive oil and 2/3 cup vinegar,  to make it more tangy and less oily. Added more seasonings, too.
