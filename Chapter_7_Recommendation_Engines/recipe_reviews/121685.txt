This recipe is awesome. The burgers had just the right amount of spice (I did use italian bread crumbs)and they were very moist. My whole family raved!

Simple, Good, and Juicy. Three words that best describe these burgers. Using the cream cheese definitely added to the moisture and flavor. Thanks.

Mom used to make hamburger patties with egg in them, and this recipe took me back to my childhood. I followed the recipe exactly except I used all ground beef. Instead of grilling, we broiled ours just like Mom used to, and we ate them without the bun. Very delicious and a definite keeper!

This was pretty good. I used spicy Italian sausage. They were better than a typical plain burger, but I prefer some other recipes instead. My wife felt they were too "sausagey". The cream cheese was a nice addition though.

The taste was great, but I felt like it could have used more bread crumbs to hold the mixture together better. Still, we'll make these again.

I use all the ingredients as listed, but I substitute the pork sausage with sage flavored pork sausage.

These were just ok, more of a meatloaf than a burger. I would give them only three stars but my husband loved them so I will switch it to four.

My whole family liked these burgers and that's what counts when it comes to cooking for my bunch of picky eaters. I did use all ground beef in place of half pork sausage because it's what I had. They were very tasty and juicy anyway though. Thanks for a great recipe. (Also my grill ran out of gas when they were only half done, so I had to finish them in the broiler. Still great though. No problems with them sticking to either the grill or broiler pan.)

My husband really enjoyed this burger! I actually used hot sausage. With the cream cheese on the grill, it was great!

My family did not care for this recipe, and asked me to make PLAIN hamburgers from now on.  I decided to give this recipe a try because I was looking for a way to use up a pound of sausage in my freezer.  The burgers were very greasy and less flavorful than I had imagined they would be.  I won't make these again.

This was ok, I guess how good can you make a burger? I don't think I will make this again, too much work for the mediocre taste. Sorry:(

These were really great tasting burgers.  Cooked through but still juicy.  Used all ground beef - and only a pound of it without changing the amount of the other ingredients.  Might be why we thought they were so tasty - not so much meat overpowering all the other ingredients.  A keeper!

Always out to impress my father-in-law when he visits, I tried these for dinner one night.  I was a bit nervous, because my husband HATES cream cheese.  I didn't have any sausage on hand, so I used 2 lbs ground beef and I was very careful to fully incorporate the cream cheese.  They were a HUGE hit with everyone.  They are indeed a very moist burger which is often hard to come by on the grill.  I will make these often.

Good! I followed the recipe exactly. These burgers are very messy on the grill and would probably have a tendency to stick if you aren't careful. I cooked them on a Foreman grill, so sticking wasn't so much of an issue - but cleaning was. Still, the burgers were tasty and juicy. Thanks!

I loved these burgers.  I made them because I was in the mood for a sausage burger and this recipe made great sausage burgers. I did not use the cream cheese because my son has a milk allergy and they were perfectly moist and full of flavor. I will make these again. Thanks for a great, simple recipe!

Tasted great, but gave 4 stars because I didnt care for the consistency. Followed recipe, but burgers were very loose, some even fell completely apart.

This was fairly simple to make and tasted pretty good but didnt wow me. I've had better home made burgers. I also don't think the cream cheese was neccesary.

This recipe was awesome.  Got raves from everyone who tried one!  I did add a slice of american cheese on top about 2 minutes before removing from the grill.  We will use this one again!!

I have to follow instructions to the letter, I am not creative at all when it comes to cooking. These are the BOMB!!!!! The cream cheese makes it retain all of the moisture. I forgot how long it says to cook, but may take a little extra than a NORMAL burger with the pork sausage.

Very moist and tasty! I only used 1 pound hamburger. The only thing I changed was diminished to 1/4 cup breadcrumbs 1 tbsp. Onion flakes instead of fresh and added 1/2 tsp. Garlic powder. Grilled and topped with cheddar cheese. Thanks for sharing will make again.

These were very yummy! They are a little gooey to mix, but after they are grilled, they are very filling and super good! I will make them again..maybe use a little more onion.
