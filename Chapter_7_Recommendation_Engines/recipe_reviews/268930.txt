This is definitely going to be an autumn tradition in our house from now on.  Made pretty much according to the recipe except that my grocery store only had smaller pie pumpkins.  This actually turned out better since I filled two of them and then had more of the savory-sweet pumpkin to go with the meal.

This was a really fun, easy recipe! I had in-laws coming over and for dinner was making Chef John’s Creamy Pork stew. Since I had pork and an extra pumpkin on hand, I gave it a try. The seasonings and braising liquid were from the stew recipe. After browning the pork, I stuffed as much pork as would fit into the pumpkin and added the “stew sauce” and some extra apple cider for the braising liquid, then cooked as directed. It turned out just like the video, and was a great way to show off to the in-laws! In my opinion, the pumpkin was the best part, as it did take on the delicious flavor from the pork. Great recipe, Chef John!

Though my kids don’t like pumpkin (at all) they loved the pork and ate everything but the pumpkin. Hubby and I loved this. After mixing the pork and marinating ingredients I put the pork mix in a tub and froze it. So when I fancied eating/cooking this dish I just had to defrost and cook - no waiting for marinade time! I like to do this with a few dishes and shopping day is prep day for a few dishes that have a long marinating time just like this.  It worked brilliantly and was very tasty.

This was absolutely divine . everybody loved it even the little kids. The pork was battery tender, so flavorful with all the wonderful spices. I can’t wait to make this again.

Simple, beautiful, impressive to present.

I tested using two smaller squash.  One baked per the recipe while the second I added apple, grapes & sweet peppers so I cooked everything separately - pressure cooking the pork, convection for the squash, and skillet for the "guts".  Then combined everything and baked it an additional 1.5 hours.   Seemed to work well but the original recipe is less labor.

Easy to follow the pork was very tender and full of flavor.  The cider never evaporated like the directions said it would but it turned out great will make it again.

Happy to try this recipe and use a pie pumpkin in a different recipe other than pumpkin bread or pie. Made as written and was happy with the flavor of the meat using fennel seeds and pleased with the tenderness of the meat. My husband was surprised how nice the pumpkin tastes (cross between a squash and sweet potatoe).  Used my immersion blender on the cooked sauce with a little of the pumpkin for a smoother gravy. Don't forget to save the pumpkin seeds to bake with butter and salt.

Made it in small pie pumpkins & it turned out amazing. Didn’t need to cook as long and the meat was very tender!

I made this for my family. The meat turned out very tender and edible but we didn’t care for the flavors.
