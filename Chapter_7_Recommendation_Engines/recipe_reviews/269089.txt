Too strong. Oh my! Maybe half the irish cream and liqueur? I couldn't finish it in its current state. Had to add more coffee and regular creamer. This could just be me. The smell is wonderful though.

Made this for my husband because I'm not a fan of the hazelnut flavor and he thought it was great. I didn't have whipped cream but he said it didn't need it. This would make a great after dinner drink/dessert!
