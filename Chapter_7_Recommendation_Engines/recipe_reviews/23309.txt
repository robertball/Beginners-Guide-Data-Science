The muffin itself is great, not too sweet, which is as a muffin should be. Fluffy, tender and moist.  It is the streusel, however, that I didn't like. Even though I used chilled butter as called for, it wasn't until I added two tablespoons more of both brown sugar and flour that I got a true streusel consistency. As written, the streusel is too heavy with butter. Had I used the streusel as is, while I'm sure it would have been acceptable, it would more than likely have somewhat melted into the muffin rather than being the crumb-like streusel topping I was after. Once I "fixed" it (at least to MY liking) all was fine, and I had a perfect blueberry streusel muffin.

This is a really good classic muffin.  I used a bit more sugar, 1 Tbs. vanilla, didn't coat my blueberries with flour, and baked at 350 instead of 375 and they turned out great.  This muffin had a really nice flavor.

These were great. I added a cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup. And left off the strusel topping. I even used frozen blueberries and cut them up into little pieces. These are on the top of my list for blueberry muffins.

I made these for brunch today and they were just perfect!  It was the first time I'd ever made blueberry muffins from scratch rather than out of a box and the results were phenomenal.  I had to add about an extra 1/4 cup of milk to make the batter a little thinner, but it wasn't a problem and they cooked up beautifully - I love the streusel as well.  I'll be making these again without a doubt!

The muffins are very tasty. I used half blueberry's and half strawberries. I also replaced about 1/4 cup of white sugar with brown sugar. I believe the richness of the brown sugar enhances the taste of the berries.

I noticed right away that this uses the cake method of mixing.  Makes it richer.  My 6-yr-old and I decided to mix the berries with the dry ing, so that the batter would turn purple! Didn't try the topping; too many mixed reviews -- just sprinkled brown sugar an top. Used the lower temp suggestion. Very filling, we found. Nice muffin.

Delightful! Other users have said they used more sugar - I don't think these muffins needed it. If there are enough blueberries, these should impart a natural sweetness. I found it to be just the right level. Delicious warm with a cup of tea, and I'm sure they'll be tasty later as well. Gorgeous!!

These weren't very sweet and the streusel topping didn't work so hot either. They were edible, but I'll not be using this recipe again.

I loved these muffins! I searched high and low for a blueberry muffin recipe that did not call for nutmeg or lemon and this is the perfect one! I was leary about the brown sugar streusel, but it was fabulous. Definitely will make again!

Delicious! I accidentally forgot about the streusel topping, but they were just fine without it. I can't wait to use this recipe with other kinds of berries too. It will be my official muffin recipe for forever now! :D

I made a quadruple batch of these intending to give some to friends.  It's a good thing that I didn't just double it because within 10 minutes of the first batch coming out of the oven my son had eaten four of them and would have gone for more if I hadn't cut him off.  I had to exercise restraint to only have three myself.    Be advised, the difference between doughy and perfectly done is a matter of one or two minutes.  Check frequently once they get close.  With my oven in convection mode, it only took 18 minutes to bake these.

Just took these muffins out of the oven! They are DELICIOUS!! I also made a "few" changes as others suggested. I added one cup of white sugar to the batter and substituted brown sugar for the topping. I also had no lemons in the house so I used orange zest and it was fabulous.  I am on my second muffin now...I will definently make these again   :)

I really enjoyed these muffins - not cakey like so many other blueberry muffin recipes. The steusel on top was a nice added sweetness without making them too sweet.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was the first time I've ever made blueberry muffins, so I was a little apprehensive, but WOW did these come out great!  My family loved them, and my mother has already asked me to make a batch just for her.

I have a new love for fresh blueberries & this recipe just helped make it greater! The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly... it was pretty good, but something was missing. Second time I tried them I added cinnamon to the batter... that's what was missing the first time! Yesterday I made it a 3rd time with half all-purpose, half whole wheat flour (plus the cinnamon of course) & boy was that delicious! Can't really go wrong with this recipe... next thing to try, applesauce in place of the butter!

these are great! if you follow the directions i would recommend cooking them for 25-27 minutes instead of 30. It makes for a softer "melt in your mouth" muffin! recipe was easy to follow, too. Every part of this muffin was good! Even the batter (I liked the bowl clean!) I'm making these again fo shooooo (:

Fantastic and perfect!  Just what a fluffy blueberry muffin should be.  I made the recipe exactly (except was too lazy to make the streusel so just used plain sugar).

I think that if I made these again I would add cinnamon to the muffin mix.  Also, when you make the streusel topping make sure that the butter is chilled. I was making my topping when there was a toddler disaster, and by the time I got back to the kitchen my topping had gone from a streusel-like  consistancy to a puddle. The butter had become room temp. But I spread it over the muffins anyway, and I'm glad I did, because it brings a nice sweetness to the muffin.

These were so good! Made them exactly as the recipe said (maybe added more blueberries than called for, but I didn't really measure it). Next time would add more flour and brown sugar to the topping to make it more like a streusel

I accidentally added the cinnamon to the flour mixture instead of the steusel mix.  It was the best "mistake" I ever made.  

(I also put more cinnamon in the streusel per the recipe.)

Love it. I did add a box of small instant vanilla pudding, and a little bit of orange extract. They only lasted a day.....

Easily my new favorite muffin recipe!  I made them exactly as stated (& used fresh blueberries).  They are perfect, not too sweet, excellent consistency, & wonderful streusel on top.

These were okay but very sweet (and I LOVE sweet stuff but it was too much for me).  Tasted like cake.

I don't normally use recipes as I love to just wing it and make stuff up. But I did try this recipe and I just absolutely love it. But what's more important is that my family absolutely love them. There are never left overs. You won't be disappointed with this recipe. I do add a little more vanilla and sugar to the batter though.

My family LOVED these muffins so much that they were gone immediately! I did have to double the topping recipe since the first batch only covered half the muffins, and I was using it sparingly. That is the only thing I would do differently as they were so yummy!!

I made these the other day and I thought they were OK.  They were missing something and the streusel did not add the extra kick I thought it would.  I did substitute dried blueberries so I am not sure if that affected the outcome.

I made this recipe as per the original except I used mixed berries and they were wonderful. I found it a tad dry which is why I only gave a 4 rating.  I enjoyed the flavour though and I would put lots of butter...yum!!

I thought these muffins were ok, nothing special. They weren't too sweet though, but the streusel topping was really good, it definitely helped to make them sweeter.

Very good muffin recipe. The only change I made was adding some chopped strawberries making them Blueberry/Strawberry muffins. Very Good !
 They were done at exactly 25 minutes.

We liked these.  I feel like they need a little something more in the mix - maybe some cardamom or cinnamon.  The crumb is beautiful, and the muffins look stunning.  They just didn't taste as great as I wanted them to.  I might add fewer blueberries because they were very "wet" in the center for my tastes.

The first time I made these, they were so delicious. However, the second time I made them they were super hard. I don't know what happened. 

I don't eat eggs so I replaced the eggs with a banana.

I've been looking for a new recipe for blueberry muffins with a struesel topping and thought I would give this one a try. They didn't turn out as good as I was hoping. They aren't bad, just not as sweet and not the kind of topping I was wanting. IF I make these again I will definately make changes. They were worth trying, just not my cup of tea.

I added zest, finely chopped, from one lemon plus 2 TBS lemon juice.  I also used a cup of sugar.  For the topping I used brown sugar and added 2 TBS oats for more crunch.  Also, toss the blueberris with 1 TBS flour--turns out better.

These muffins weren't sweet enough and the batter was thick and hard to spoon into the papers in the pan. The strusel ratio of butter to dry ingrediants was off and I had to add more flour to make it work. They turned out ok, but I was dissapointed. I wish I had read more reviews and added more sugar and milk. I definitely wouldn't make them again as written.

This recipe worked well with a 50/50 white/whole wheat flour mix. I just added a bit more milk (2/3 cup total) so that they wouldn't be dry due to the addition of whole wheat flour. Also added some nutmeg to the streusel topping. Loved them!

The muffin  recipe is good, works for high altidude very well. As for the streusel, just keep adding equal amounts of flour and brown sugar until it has the streusel crumb effect. this works just fine

Very tasty muffins. I added a bit more sugar, about 1/4 C more milk and a T of flax seed. My family loved them!

I followed the recipe to a T, and they were perfect.  The batter was thick, but I resisted the urge to add more milk.  These are to die for.

This is a great blueberry muffin.  The texture is soft and crumbly.  This recipe is easy to tweek according to your preferences without compromising the main portion of the muffin.  I've made it once as written and it was great.  The next time I made it I substituted half of the sugar called for with splenda, buttermilk in place of the milk, doubled the streusel topping, and baked it in a cast iron skillet to serve as a coffee cake.  Beautiful and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins should be promptly refridgerated after cooling, otherwise the topping causes them to go moldy in just a few days.

Fantastic! These are really great muffins.  I did make a little change.  I added 1 cup sugar to the muffin mix and 1 tablespoon of white sugar to the struesle mix. I also used frozen blueberries and they worked great.  They came out so moist and really tasty.  Thanks so much.

So I cooked these for 20 minutes and they got burned on the bottom.That is why it is only 4 stars. Also I had enough dough leftover for 5 more muffins after filling each cup 3/4. I tried one and inside it was so soft and delicious. I gave them to my boyfriend and he said they are so delicious. I will try again filling 1/2 full and 1/2 recipe and 1/2 time for I hope the 5 star I know I can get.

I made these for a club meeting during the inauguration and they were a hit with students and staff alike. I also took art of the batter and baked it in a cake pan making it as a coffee cake. My boos declared it "the coffee cake of change". They are perfect for someone with a sweet tooth, which I have but they're still very breakfast-like.

Pretty good. Not quite Otis Spunkmeyer but good for being from my oven. Loaded with blueberries. I used a can of OregoN blueberries, drained and rinsed. I didn't use streusel topping, I made these for my husband and son to have for breakfast this week and they don't want anything fancy, so I just sprinkled some decorative white sugar on top before baking. I'll use this recipe again as these turned out great. Thank you for sharing this!

This recipe is great! I did what some of the reviewers said and used 1 cup of sugar and I didn't even have enough flour, I was a little short but I decided to make them anyway and they turned out great. Instead of doing the streusel on top I just mixed a little brown sugar and a few sprinkles of cinnamon and sprinkled a tiny bit on each unbaked muffin. I love streusel but I was trying to leave off any unnecessary calories. The brown sugar and cinnamon worked out great; the tops have a little extra sweet on them, but not too much. Great recipe. I will for sure make these again.

These were fabulous muffins. Moist, flavorful, and quick to prepare! I added a tad bit more sugar to the recipe and baked them at 350 for 35 minutes, rather than the recommended 375. 
In the past, I've used recipes that were featured in magazines or books and that were written by famous cooking/craft mavens....all were an absolute disappointment. These, however, were the exact opposite! :)

These were very moist and delicious muffins.  The only thing I was a bit disappointed with was the topping.  I was expecting something a little more distinctive and this sort of blended into the background.  It didn't matter because the muffins themselves were excellent.

Very tasty - made my 9-mo. pregnant wife happy!  I'd add a touch more salt and cinnamon, but those are personal prefs.  Frozen wild blueberries worked well in this recipe.

I've made these 2 times now with my daughter.  She took a batch to preschool for snack time.  Her and her classmates loved them!  We just made a batch for us here at home, this time with a triple berry mix!  We also added chopped up pecans each time.  This is our new muffin recipe!

Very delicious muffins!  Very moist, not crumbly or dry.  And it was just sweet enough, but not too sweet.  I would definitely make these again.

I just made these muffins using some of the others feedback.  My husband and I liked them because they we not so sweet. My kids wanted them sweeter. I put 1/2 sugar to 1/4 brown sugar. Added 2 tablespoons of vannila and skipped the streusel for sprinkled sugar on top. They turned out beautiful. I would make them again, if the kids don't eat them, then that's more for me and my honey!!

I loved this recipe for blueberry muffins!  I have been using another recipe on this site, but I think I might like this one better.  I did add a pinch of cinnamon to the batter, some lemon zest and a bit more sugar.   Like naples34102, I had to add more brown sugar and flour to the streusel topping to get it more like, well...streusel!  With my few changes, these were very good muffins!

I made a loaf, it is so good! I altered it slightly I use 1 cup fresh blue berries, and cooked it for 8 to 10 min longer cause the loaf took a bit longer to cook other than that I didn't change a thing. I can't wait to make another. Thank you for the recipe :)

I've made several blueberry muffin recipes and my family decided these were the best.  The muffins were light and tender.  It had enough blueberries to satisfy even my pickiest kid.  I did make two changes - I substituted 2 tsp lemon juice for the vanilla and I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the batter.  These small changes elevated the flavor.  They didn't need the topping but it added a sweet crunchy texture.  I think I'll just sprinkle with turbinado sugar next time.

Used thawed frozen blueberries, without using any  juice. Used more than recipe called for, about two cups. Delicious. Will surely make again.

I didn't make this, but I would like to point out this recipe is uncannily similar to the "Streusel Topped Blueberry Muffins" recipe. I find this strange...

The recipe was easy and quickly ready for oven baking so I was very excited with anticipation because they smelled wonderful. I was disappointed with the flavor of the muffin as it truly had no flavor, not blueberry, not sweet either. Maybe it was my blueberries that were the problem but they were nice and fresh so not sure what else to say. The topping I thought was EXCELLENT & I will definitely use this again. In all fairness, I will try this recipe again as written since I love blueberry muffins before I give up on this recipe. I definitely agree with one of the other reviewers statements that a muffin should not necessarily be sweet from sugar but from the fruit itself yes! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I liked that the muffin base wasn't overly sweet. For the topping, I used a sprinkling of sugar in lieu of the streusel. I thawed frozen blueberries instead of buying fresh berries because I had a huge bag of the frozen, and the resulting muffins were delicious.

I loved this recipe ABSOLUTELY PERFECT the only adjustment I added was I added about 1/2 cup more of sugar to the batter  to make it a little sweeter. Other than that, I LOVED IT I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

My fiancée and I gave these a shot tonight and we absolutely loved them! We left off the topping just to save on calories a little, but the sweetness is still perfect. Great with a cup of coffee in the morning.

I made this muffin,  but maybe I should add more flour to it or the blueberries  will sink to the bottom.  But the mix and the toppings are very good.

I really enjoyed this recipe! So far it's been my go-to for blueberry streusel recipes, however I've adapted it to suit my tastes. I use twice as much salt in the batter, as I feel that it plays well with the berries. I also used the zest of one lemon in the batter, as well as a small squeeze of lemon juice. It really makes these muffins pop! 

I agree with other users that the streusel is too heavy, and so I used double the dry ingredients in the streusel to make A) more of it, and B) make it nice and crumbley. 

With these adjustments this is easily my favorite easy muffin recipe!

This recipe is outstanding! I did not waver from the ingredients nor the process. Make sure, when preparing the streusel topping, the butter is cold. Mine was room temp because it was just left sitting out. However, I mixed ingredients as stated, and popped it into the freezer until it reached a workable temp. When done, the main cake part of the muffin was incredibly light amd the streusel topping as excellent! I have now saved this in my favorites. You will not be disappointed and it was relatively easy to make. Thanks for the offering!

Great recipe! I've made it twice now. The first time I used blueberries, the second raspberries, proving other reviews that you can use any fruit. It was delicious both times. I used brown sugar as some suggested instead of white for the topping, and it came out much better. I knew they were a hit when the second batch ran out and my family was all asking where the muffins were... Time to make more! Also, I made a simple glaze for the top. That really was a hit. Simply said: great recipe! Will make again and again!

I've made this recipe 2 times now! Followed the recipe exactly the first time with the exception that I added a tablespoon of White Sugar to the topping and a cup of Pecans to the batter!! They were gone... I'm lucky I got to eat one!! LOL!! So I made them again, except this time, I doubled the topping mixture!!!  AND next time I make them, I'm gonna make 2 batches!!  These are the BEST Blueberry Muffins!!  Thank You Carol!!!

I will definitely make these again.  Moist, not too sweet, perfect amount of blueberries.  I might just sprinkle sugar on top rather than using the streusel, though - it clumped together more than I'd like.

These were very good.  I halved the recipe as I live alone.  Only problem was difficulty in getting the streusel to "crumble", otherwise a great recipe.  Will make again.

This was a great recipe! My whole family loved it and it came out perfectly every time I made it. I would definitely suggest that people make this recipe. Only problem was that their wasn't enough streusel topping, so I would make more of it than what it says in the recipe. Great muffins!

I have finally found my go to blueberry muffin recipe!  These are awesome muffins!  The only thing I do differently is to melt my butter and add a bit more flour for the streusel.  Oh.. and coat my blueberries in flour before adding them.  Way to go Carol!

Terrific recipe- moist and light for a muffin ratio of flour and milk. I substituted 1/2 cranberries- from necessity since I hadn't enough blueberries. I can't see how these wouldn't plese any cook. If they aren't happy, chances are they didn't follow the recipe properly.

Amazing!  I absolutely love these muffins!  I made the recipe exactly, and the muffins turned out light and fluffy, not too sweet.  I also made a variation and made mini-muffins baked for 10 minutes- big hit for the little ones in the family!

This was one of the best blueberry muffins I have ever made.  They were moist for an entire week.  I just sprinkled with cinnamon sugar but will try the streusel next time.  I tripled this recipe and got 40 regular size muffins from this recipe.

I made this recipe and it was my first time making blueberry muffins. I used frozen blueberries and based on the reviews I read, I put in 1 cup of sugar. I didn't have enough time to make the crumb topping but they came out DELICIOUS anyway. I definitely recommend this recipe!

I have made these muffins several times, but have never posted my review until today for some reason.  I make these muffins exactly as the recipe states, and every time they turn out PERFECT!  These muffins are not too sweet (they are just perfect) which allows the flavour of the blueberries to take over.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe was easy to follow and the muffins baked up nicely but I felt they were a little dry and could have been sweeter. Next time I will add more sugar and more milk.

My hus.'s fav. dessert, so I made this for his bday as a 2 layer cupcakes tower.  Followed the recipe exactly, turned out great!  Wasn't sure how tall it would fluff up, so didn't fill the cup high enough.  will make this again!

Tasted pretty good and they were moist.  It seems the streusel topping should have been crumbly, but it was mushy.

These muffins were so delicious! My fiance and I devoured them in less than a week. In the streusel topping I omitted the butter and just used a sprinkle and cinnamon and sugar. Wonderful for breakfast or as a snack in the afternoon with tea.

These were a huge hit!  DEEELISH! The only change I had to make was in the streusel. I had to add more flour & brown sugar because 2 tbsp of butter made it too wet. It turned out better, though, because as the recipe stands, it wasn't enough topping for all 10 of my muffins.

This is a good recipe! I skipped the streusel and substituted low fat sour cream for about a third of the butter- just to try and cut out a few calories- and they still turned out great!

We made these muffins today and they were quite good. We used Saskatoon berries, which are tarter than blue berries, and so we needed a full cup of sugar. Also, we used the recipe to make mini-muffins. I baked them at 350 for ten minutes, and all told, we got 42 baby muffins that are quite tasty. The cinnamon and sugar topping is nice too; we didn't bother with the streusel because so many people didn't like it.

Yumm-o!  These are so delicious.  I did use 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar and they were very sweet.  The batter is very much like a cake batter but who cares!  They are so good!

These were very disapointing.  They came out tough and chewy with very little flavor.  The streusel was a lot of work for very little reward.  Will continue to look for an easier more flavoriful recipe.

These were just alright. They weren't sweet enough and the streusel wasn't good...I think plain old sugar would have been much better.

Wonderful. These were just what I went searching for. I added a little fresh lemon juice per my own preference and used sticks of margarine as that was all I had on hand. I doubled the recipe but did not double the streusel. I just put a few sprinkles of streusel on each muffin. You could skip the streusel all together if you prefer. Base the amt. of sugar you use on the sweetness of your blueberries and you'll be good to go.

Can we say amazing muffins!! Make more stuesel topping, possibly 25-50% the amount suggested and fill the cups 2/3 from the top to accomodate this addition. I utilized unsalted butter, and the muffins melted in your mouth...light & fluffy. More experienced cooks maybe aware of this minor advantage, but for novices,(like yours truly)it will make all the difference...yum!

Delicious! I made this using half blueberries and half rhubarb and 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4. These muffins are very much like coffee cake and would also be good made with apple pieces (yum!) or black cherries.

Yummy! I doubled the recipe because muffins don't last very long in my house. I got 16 reg sized muffins and 24 mini muffins. The mini's I baked at 350 for 12 minutes and they came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins are perfect and cakey with just the right amount of sweetness!  I used frozen (unthawed) blueberries and didn't add the topping.

They didn't rise, they didn't get cooked in the time perscribed, and the streusel sank.  Other than that! They tasted good, but I can't use them as gifts. I don't know what happened, but these were not satisfactory.  I bake a lot and usually have no problem with recipes and I'm the odd woman out for a poor report of these.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and it's wonderful. The batter is rich and creamy and the muffins turn out perfectly round and beautiful. The streusel is really unnecessary but if you use it I think you should add oatmeal or something to make it more substantial. I also tried a 50/50 mix of whole wheat and white flour and they definitely didn't have the same loft as before. They still tasted very good but they were pretty flat.

When I was making the muffin mix, it turned out more like cookie dough than batter.  It was a thick ball, and I had to add a lot of milk to get it into each muffin tin.  The muffins were edible, yes, but they were heavy and thick like cookies with blueberries in them.  They were definitely not very sweet either.  The recipe seemed much more like a cookie dough recipe I've used off the back of a chocolate chip bag than any muffin recipe I've made.  Will not be making again.

We loved them...very tasty and moist!  I too  increased the vanilla to a tbl. and the milk to scant 2/3 a cup and did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I doubled the struesel topping as well.

I used whole wheat flour, and EggBeaters and these muffins were fantastic. My whole family enjoyed them.  The streusel topping is my favorite part...use a pastery blender to "cut in", it works perfectly.  The blueberries offer just enough sweetness to make you feel like you indulging without really indulging.

Wonderful recipe. My husband loves these muffins. I used white sugar for the streusel instead of brown and doubled the amount of white sugar for a more crumbly mixture. Also added 1/4 cup more blueberries. This made 9 muffins for me. I filled each cup.

I used 1 tbsp of baking powder to guarentee they wont be too dense. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, used 1/2 cup sugar, and the listed amount of butter. The spice really helped boost the flavor. I didn't make the streusel topping though. I think I'd prefer mixing the milk with the rest of the wet ingredients next time. That way, less stirring is required, and muffins would be more tender. Tried with blackberries too!

Followed recipe, then added some cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg.  Didn't have any blueberries, but used 2 bananas and a cup of blackberries.  Excellent!  These had great flavor!  I was so proud of them; it's a dirty rotten shame I didn't have any company to show them off to! (But it's too late now... they're all gone.)

These really were great, but not the type of muffins i was looking for. It was more dense and almost bread like, instead of moist. My son is scarffing them down as i'm typing, as a matter of fact hes licking his plate. Like i said, they really were yummy, just not what i expected. I did have to add more milk because it just would of been way too thick. It made 12 muffins perfectly. Could of used a little more strusel topping but that was fine. Over all good!

These were pretty good. A little dry at first and could be a little sweeter. But I thought as they sat, they got better. Still not the perfect one I was looking for, though.

This was also my first time to make blueberry muffins from scratch.  I enjoyed this recipe because it wasn't too sugary tasting.  I followed the recipe with the exception of replacing one cup of all-purpose flour for one cup of whole wheat flour.

Made with wheat flour and added 1/4 cup of wheat germ. Turned out good if you like wheat flour, my 2 year old who eats anything wasn't impressed though, but his 2.5 year old friend loved them!

Excellent recipe!  The only thing I did different was add a packet of instant oatmeal to the streusel mixture.  I cooked half of the mixture in a regular muffin pan, and the other half in mini-loaf pans.  The whole family loved them!

This was sooooo good!!! I added two mashed bananas, 1/3 cup of toasted oats and 1/3 cup wheat germ.  I also just sprinkled wheat germ and brown sugar on top instead of the struesel mix.  They were a hit!!!!
