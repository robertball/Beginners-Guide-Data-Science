Very delicious!  The chicken came out really wonderfully moist and very tasty.  My only problem was that although I could put the herb covered butter pats under the skin, I couldn't rub the rest of them on the chicken; even though they were soft, the chicken was cold and it wouldn't adhere to the skin.  I ended up melting the butter pats and brushing the herb/butter mixture on the skin, which worked fine.  Definitely would make again; my boyfriend loved it!

I didn't have enough thyme for the spice/butter mixture but followed everything else. The flavor was very good, not too strong, but complimented the chicken nicely and the meat was nice and tender and juicy! (I will say the color of the butter mixture was very unappetizing, but it cooked/browned very nicely!)

I just made this chicken and it is so delicious and juicy!  The gravy turned out so good.  One thing I do with whole chicken before cooking it, is brine it (submerge it in salt water) for about 3 hours beforehand.  It really makes it flavorful throughout.

Requires some prep time but very tasty and moist chicken. I baked two 5 lb chickens at the same time in the same roasting pan and 32 oz. of chicken broth was plenty.

Yum! Normally I roast my chicken breast up and I've gotten pretty good at knowing when it is just done so the breast stays nice a juicy, but roasting the chicken using the method in this recipe was fool-proof. The basting during the process also produced a lovely bird. Will definitely use this roasting method again, even if I don't use this exact recipe (though I will likely use that too since it was a tasty bird).

I liked it. I don't own a rack so I used the thick slices of onion and a thick, long strip of aluminum foil in the middle of the pan to lift the chicken. 

It's difficult to rub the butter mixture on the chicken, so I think I'll melt the butter next time. The skin was crispy and the chicken was moist. 


As for the gravy, I needed more than 1 tablespoon of flour. I used 4 tablespoons. I didn't even use the full 32oz of chicken broth since I used 3/4 cup for my dressing.  The gravy was very good. I strained the pan juices first, then added the flour. After that, I noticed there were lumps and little bits of flour that wouldn't dissolve, so after the gravy thickened, I placed it in the food processor until it was smooth. Then it was ready to serve. 

I made this today for thanksgiving. I recommend this recipe. Thank you for sharing. :)

Absolutely delicious - i prepared two roasters, stuffed with sliced oranges and apples. A great way to roast chicken - makes great tasting gravy - served with mashed potato, harvard beets, candied carrots, and bread stuffing.

This recipe was excellent. My boyfriend is the world's pickiest eater and he loved it. Very moist and flavorful. The gravy was also delicious despite its green color. Just make sure to drain the fat before you try to make the juice into gravy

I made this tonight and my family loved it! Some of the herbs I had fresh from my garden, so I was delighted that the recipe called for them. Tender, juicy and delicious are the first three adjectives that come to mind when describing this roasted chicken. The skin was perfectly crisp. The gravy I made with the liquid was outstanding because of the lime juice! I will make this again. Thank you!

I wasn't sure about the herbs - seemed like they would be overwhelming.  But I always try to make new recipes exactly as written the first time and rate based on that.  This was really really good!  My husband is super picky, and gave it a big thumbs up.  I did make 2 very minor changes:  1)  I threw some onion powder into the chicken broth because I didn't have any onions, and 2) I added more flour to make the gravy (adding it to a bit of cold water first).  As others mentioned, I couldn't get the hang of coating the outside of the chicken with the butter mixture; I tried, but it just doesn't stick.  I saved some, and when I took the chicken out of the oven to turn it over, I coated the chicken with the remaining butter mixture.  The gravy was excellent over mashed potatoes!

Wow! Guys! This was so awesomely good. I cooked it as suggested (didn't have the appropriate pan so used a caste iron skillet with a crushed up aluminum foil snake  as my rack). I did half a lemon and apple instead of lime. For the butter spice I cut the amount of butter by about a 3rd and used a cajun spice as the base with paprika, tyme,  sage and a little coarse salt. Had trouble getting the butter to stick but it worked out. Gravy was also amazing served over rice with broccoli and peas on the side. SO moist and perfect.

I made this chicken recipe for my family for Christmas and it was heavenly.  Sooo juicy and tender.  I was out of sage, so I used poultry seasoning.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to a "T".  My family really liked it.  They said it was very flavorful.  I will very definitely make it again

Wow this is an incredible tasting roast chicken!!!.  The only thing I did different was use lemon juice instead of lime and I placed the chicken breast side up (how do you turn a hot chicken anyway?).  The meat is moist and although I personally like the skin a little crispier I wouldn't change a thing,

Delicious! This spice blend is a fantastic change from standard poultry seasoning and thyme mixtures. The apples stuffed inside imparted a wonderful sweetness. I'll make it again the very next time roast chicken is on the menu.

Goes really well with the slow cooker mashed potatoes.
