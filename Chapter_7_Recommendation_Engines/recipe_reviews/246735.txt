I could not find key lime juice so used 50/50 mix of fresh lemon and lime juice. This cake was not only pretty but was super moist, light  and flavorful. Loved this recipe.

This cake is delicious.  I got enough juice out of 1 pound of Key limes to make this cake and glaze.  I added 3 drops of green food coloring .  Instead of water in the glaze, I used Persian lime juice.  There was enough glaze that I used the leftovers to drizzle over the top of the cake.  The tart glaze compliments the cake nicely.  My hubby lived it with ice cream and strawberries.  This is a keeper!

This  is a very and delicious cake.  I was confused about the instructions for the glazing.  I did poke holes in the cake, but, glazed it upright out of the pan.  I will definitely be making this cake again but will glaze the cake, upsidedown, in the pan.

The whole family loved this cake! Very moist and great flavor. I did have to add more powdered sugar to thicken glaze.
