It is really a shame that people who simply did not care for the cut of beef suggested by the person who submitted this recipe gave this a low rating because the rub itself is fantastic. The blend of the brown sugar and the 3 pepper flavors is phenominal. If you do not care for flank steak or flat iron...just use a different cut.

I created this recipe and just wanted to offer a different spin on it.  Replace the brown sugar with peach jello powder, sounds weird but gives a nice back flavor to it.

Excellent & easy.  This tastes as good as any pricey restaurant steak.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Grilling tip:  leave the meat out of the fridge for about 30 min before grilling.  It's easier to get the level of doneness you want this way.

I've never reviewed a recipe on here before, but this recipe definitely warrants a review.  I cut the salt in half and used white pepper instead of reg. pepper for more kick.  I made two types of steaks: one with this rub, and one with a beer marinade.  Would you believe the the ones with the dry rub were more tender?  Excellent rub with an excellent kick!  I used a charcoal grill with hickory chips.  Definitely the way to go!

Great, simple, southwestern taste.  I didn't have chilpotle pepper or onion powder.  I used minced onion instead.  Came out great.  We used the rub also on chicken breast tenders and bbq.  My family really enjoyed both the steak and chicken

Excellent! When I cook, one of my favorite things to do is to try things that I've never thought of but seem just crazy enough to work. Doesn't always pan out, but I took Danny Jaye's tip on using peach Jello powder - and it's awesome!! Cooked these 5 minutes per side, and the rub was enough to cover 3lbs. Great recipe, thanks!!

Excellent & easy!  I put this rub on a flank steak the night before I served it and it gave the a great spicy flavor without being overpowering.  I look forward to trying this rub on other cuts of beef as well as on some chicken.

I enjoyed the recipe. I followed it EXACTLY as written ........ not amazing but good. I'm familiar with grilling Flank so this was my first venture into Flat Iron Steaks..... quite a savings and very tasty. The rub wasn't that prominent and nothing dramatically better than many commercial blends of rubs. I may still try the Peach Jello option in the future.

This was a good rub. Be sure to use smoked paprika, not regular sweet paprika, it makes a huge difference. Also I didn't "marinate" mine because I don't see how on earth dry spices could possibly penetrate the meat without an acid, and I still thought this was 5 star. Thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful.  Proportions were perfect for 2 Flat Iron Steaks.  Grilled over Mesquite wood chunks and served in corn tortilla with fresh guacamole, black bean-corn-pico de gallo, and lime.  Key when cutting Flat Iron is to cut on the bias.  Doing this makes meat very tender.  Also, don't forget to let it rest up to 5 minutes after taking off the grill to retain juices.  GREAT RUB!

I make this all the time - i add about 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the mix along with a bit of olive oil to make a paste - just enough to make the spices stick together.  You also have to be careful when grilling to make sure spices don't burn.

I took my jaccard tenderizer to it on both sides then sprinkled with the rub as listed.  I had a 2 lb cut and it was at least 1 inch thick so I knew it would take longer than reccomended to cook.  It marinaded all night and into the next evening when I brought it out to sit on the counter for 1/2 an hour.  Brought grill up to 600 (hot) slapped the meat on and brought her down to med-high around 505-515 degrees for 6 mins on the first side and flipped.  It took about another 9 mins to bring the thing up to 143 internal temp (near instant read thermometer).  Took it off and foil tented for 5 mins and it was still pretty warm so I put it on the cutting board and let rest another 5 mins.  Diagnal cross grain slices produced excellent medium cooked yummyness!  Only thing, a little too spicy for my daughter (7 YO) who is a total spice wimp.  Thankfully, I made an extra double batch of the rub for whatever comes next!  Very good!  Oh, the chipolte chili powder cost me like 7 bucks but MMMMMM good!

Wow, this is a fantastic rub!  I didn't have chipotle chili powder so I just used another teaspoon of regular but it was still out of this world.  This will definately be something I use over and over again.

The rub is really flavorful, but too salty, I use less than 1/4 the salt called for. We've used the rub on flank steak, chicken and pork tenderloin, marinate overnight when you have the time.

I LOOOVE this recipe! I didnt have onion powder and used regular chili powser instead. Also, I used it on sirloin steak and taste just as great! I had some Jack Daniels lying around, and poured about 3/4 of a shot onto the steak to condense the flavors. It turned out really well!!

Just finished scarfing down this great recipe! Both my husband and I loved it! I found it had a little spiciness, but not overwhelming at all. It had an amazing flavor! I only let it marinate for 2 hours, which makes me wonder how it would have tasted if i marinated for 5 or more hours! I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

We used Strip Steak and this rub was excellent! My son wanted to make a rub like you get in a restaurant so we went on a hunt. I'm not a big "measurer" so I wasn't exact on my measurements. We rubbed everything on really well. We were only able to let it set about 4 hrs before grilling. I didn't have any Chipotle chili powder, so left that out. I added a little extra brown sugar to off set some of the southwest taste. I also mixed up some garlic and butter in a skillet til soft (not melted), then rubbed on the steak while grilling. OMG, the flavor was incredible. This was the best steaks we've had in a long time! This will definitely be a normal rub when we want one, instead of a normal marinade! Thank you for a great recipe!

It was very spicy for me (but I am a wimp), and my children would not eat it.    I made a salsa with avocado, lime, tomato, black bean, garlic and cilantro, then served it on top of the steak with sour cream, it was very yummy

The combination of spices tantalizes the taste buds and created a mouth watering experience for our guests. We enjoyed this very much and in fact plan to use the seasonings on other steaks as well.  Thank you, BigChef

This is very falvorful and nice and spicy.  I rubbed 3 thin cut top loin steaks with this about 8 hours before I cooked them.  I cooked them in a hot cast iron skillet for about 4 minutes per side and they came out wonderful.  The next night, I used the leftover rub to make chicken for quesadillas, again it was a wonderful dinner.

This rub kicks up flat iron to gold. Made it for the Lady of my life and she loved it, got me a five star kiss. I did not have chipotle chile powder on hand so I used ground Cayenne. Used this rub on chicken breast too! A great marinate that yeilds lip smacking smiles and most likely a kiss for the chief.

Excellent!  I didn't have smoked paprika, so used regular paprika, and cut the chipotle in half only because we were having spicy side dishes.  I applied the rub then marinated in the fridge for about six hours.  The steak was EXTREMELY moist, which isn't always the case with a rub.

I cannot find flat iron steaks locally (Long Island), but found them in Ohio (Kroger) this past week during a family visit and brought some home in a cooler. Decided to try this recipe and am so glad I did! I used all of the rub on a 2 lb. flat iron steak that I cut in half (to grill quicker) prior to seasoning. We all loved rub! After letting the meat rest covered for 10 minutes, I sliced the beef on an angle against the grain. It was cooked a bit less than medium and so tender and full of flavor. A definite keeper in this house! Thankfully I bought 3 steaks and still have 2 more to enjoy! When I've used them up, I will definitely try this rub on other cuts of beef that I can get locally.

My boyfriend liked this, but all I could really taste was the chipotle/paprika. However because he liked it, I gave it three stars. I think it was good, but not great. I think next time I will use less paprika.

Nice flavors.  I ate half the steak the first night.  Used the rest with a veggie stir fry the next night.

This was an incredible rub which turned a boring ol' flat iron steak into a tender slab o' yum!  I don't know why I've always relied on marinades as opposed to rubs, but this recipe proved to me beyond a shadow of doubt that dry rubs yield very tender and flavorful results.  Thank you!

Too spicy for my kids, but I really liked the flavors. We sliced up the meat and put it in tacos.  It was wonderful.  Super flavorful.  I will definately make again.

We love this rub! I never have the chipotle chile powder in the hosue, so my rub goes without that, but even witrhout it, this rub is delicious. I use it on chicken, pork, and beef. (Oddly enough, I haven't used it on flat iron steaks yet.) The smoked paprika gives it such a nice flavor. This rub recipe deserves to be posted by itself.

This was great!  The whole family, including four teen and pre-teen girls and a 5 year old boy, loved it.  My girls have never, Never liked steak before and absolutely devoured this.  My son even had second helpings and ate almost as much as his dad.  The spices are flavorful and not too spicy, but spicy enough for those of us who like spices.  Definitely a keeper.

Great rub recipe! This is the first time that I ever made a flat iron steak. The only thing that I changed was that I didn't have chipotle chile powder so I just omitted it. I don't like things that spicy anyway. I grilled the steak and it looked as if it was going to be really dry but after letting it rest for about 10 minutes, it was out of this world. The flavor was better than any store bought rub could have been and it was almost as tender as a filet. My family will definitely be having this many more times. Thank you!!!

I love flat irons so I was looking forward to this recipe.  It was good but the chilli powder was over powering everything else.  I'll try again but cut the chilli powder in half.

I used this recipe tonight.  I think it's a pretty good recipe but much too salty for our taste.  Everyone at dinner said it was good but way too salty.  If I use this again I'll cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp and see how that goes.

Just finished eating a flat iron steak with this rub on it ... FANTASTIC!!  We'll be eating these as one of our summer staple items ... I have nothing bad to say about this recipe ... I *may* spice it up just a bit more with some crushed red pepper flakes because we like our food quite spicy ... but other than that, this is really worth the time and effort .. you won't be disappointed!

I used this recipe with mock tenderloin steaks, without the chipotle chili powder that I didn't have, and only let it sit about 1/2 an hour, and it still turned out amazing!   I can't wait to try it when I have everything right.  The only thing I changed on purpose is the chili powder amount because I do not like heat - and 1 teaspoon was just right to add flavor.  Thanks for sharing - this is a keeper!

My first review ever!  This is phenomenal!!! I absolutely loved it, and so did my husband and even the kids gobbled it up in no time.  Definitely a keeper!!  I left out the chipotle chili powder to leave it kid friendly, and no complaints... we are so going to have this again in the near future! Thanks so much for sharing a great recipe to make an inexpensive cut of meat into something sooo yummy!

My husband loved this and wants to have steak this way all the time. I personally thought it was too much rub for the amount of steak so we compromised on a 4. Next time I will rub a bit more on his and a bit less on mine and it should be perfect.

Second review added because I did something else with the leftovers.....which was even better  I liked it/didn't LOVE it as a hot dish. We had leftover meat so a couple days later I sliced it very thin and served it over greens as a cold salad. The spices were a little potent for me as a hot dish but shaved and served over salad the kick was diffused a bit and it was awesome!!!

I used hot chili powder instead of chipolte and it was mighty hot!  I let it marinate overnight and the meat was TENDER! Maybe that's why it was so hot??

A great rub for any type of steak.  Does not have to be confined to a flat iron. Actually we never use that cut or flank steak.  Going to try it on chicken - should work.  Keeps the fat content down to a minimum which is a plus.  Thanks for adding something great to my files.

Great. I discovered I didn't have any cumin, substituted cayene pepper in same amount, seemed to work just fine.

What a fantastic rub!  I did modify it a tad since we love hot and spicy.  I added 1/2 tsp cayenne and some crushed red pepper flakes.  My guests and I loved it on the flat iron steak and I cannot wait to try it on other cuts.  I think this would be great on pork and chicken as well.  Thanks for sharing!

I do not eat steak, but I am always looking for good steak recipes to fix for my husband.  I used this rub on a flat iron steak for him, and chicken for me.  My husband loved his steak, and my chicken was pretty good as well!  I did not have the onion powder or the chipotle chili powder, but we did not really miss those ingredients.  We will definitely make this recipe again.

I would give this five stars, but I made a few changes so I thought I should not rate this a 5 since I didn't really make this exactly.  What I did was mix as directed, except that I cut down on the salt by half, and omitted onion and chipotle powders becacuse I didn't have those, and instead used extra cumin and added a hot curry blend.  I also subbed molasses instead of brown sugar, again necessity.  Lastly, I used a sirloin, bone-in steak.  
But honestly, with all that - it was FABULOUS!  I plan to keep this in as a common rub for beef - it was just phenomenal.

Oh my goodness.  I don't usually fight my husband for leftovers, but with this recipe I hid the Tupperware container in the back of the refrigerator so he wouldn't find it.  SO delicious, and I didn't change a thing.  Thank you!

We absolutely LOVE this steak rub! I used sirloin tip steak and it was amazing. Served with cheese/sour cream/green chile mashed potatoes. I made up a second package of thin-cut sirloin tip for burritos this week, using the rest of the green chiles for a cheese sauce. Thanks for giving me another easy dish to add to my files!

I found this recipe when my wife was told to eat a low sodium diet and we were both craving fajitas. Pre-packaged fajitas are loaded with salt so I tried this twice so far - once with flank steak and once with porterhouse steaks pounded/flattened - they both came out great! I let the spices sit on the flank steak overnight and I think it was a bit too long. A few hours seems to be just fine - which is what I did with the porterhouse. This is what I will be using to make fajitas from now on. I made it for a house full of people and they all loved it.

This 3 pepper rub is wonderful!  I had a flank steak that I marinated for 2 hours.  My dh said thia was the best steak he ever had.  It was so tender and moist.  So glad I found this recipe.  I will be making it very soon.

Wow!!!  Used with a London Broil and it was sheer heaven.  Didn't have time to marinate long (30 min.) and pan-fried instead of grilled but it was probably the best rub I've ever tasted.  I used the peach jello substitute recommended by Danny Jaye and it really gave a unique flavor.  Leftovers were divine on a hoagie roll with horseradish sauce.  Plan to make a large batch of this rub and give in small jars as Christmas gifts.

I doubled the recipe and made it twice over a couple of weeks.   I rubbed it into the meat early in the day and let kept it in the fridge several hours before cooking. The only problem was that I should have cooked more so my family wouldn't fight over the last bits of meat.  What an easy way to dress up an inexpensive cut of meat.

I used about 1 tsp of this on two chicken breasts (and saved the reast for later use), and they turned out awesome!  Suprisingly moist, too.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because my fiance thought it lacked flavour.  I thought it was awesome and will definitely make again!

This was by far the best steak on the grill I had, short of teryiaki steak which is my personal favorite. For someone who prefers thin, well done steaks, it can't get any better than this. We will most likely only have these two from now on! so yummy.

Really good! I had to make a couple of substitutions. I didn't have chipotle chili powder, so I used a half teaspoon of cayenne instead. And I used onion salt instead of onion powder. Next time, I'll cut back on the salt overall. But this was very tender and really tasty.

The rub in this recipe is wonderful and can be used on many types of meat. However I do not care for the cut of meat. I believe I will stick to the better cuts.

Very nice flavor!  We didn't have flat iron steak, so we used steaks we already had in the freezer, but they worked fine.  Did notice the brown sugar in it (meaning it wasn't sweet). We had avocado, rice and peppers with ours.  Very good!

This was delicious!
Left in fridge 24 hours with the spice rub. 
We didn't have chipotle seasoning, so just left that ingredient out.
The taste and texture were great!
A  flat iron cut of beef has the gristle removed, and is quite tender on its own.  This was my first time using this cut, and I will definitely be using it in the future!

I made this today after letting it season for 48 hours.  I have to say it was so good, I didn't want to share it with anyone else.  I will be making this again and again and again and again, very often.

This is the best steak rub EVER. I don't have smoked paprika, so I did normal paprika and half of the salt smoked salt and then add normal salt. I like to make double the recipe also.

I don't usually use dry rubs but this one peeked my interest.  Turned out Very Nice! I left it in the frig. For two days because I couldn't cook it when expected, no matter it was great.

I agree with some of the other reviews...it tastes a lot like taco seasoning.

I used this recipe last night with a flat iron steak for fajitas and it was pretty tasty. It gave the steak a nice flavor and man was it tender and juicy. Yummy. Since I was used the rub for one steak, I used a couple of tablespoons to add to the peppers and steak strips with a 1/4 cup of water to make a sauce out of it. Turned out pretty good. I will defiantly be using this rub again.
