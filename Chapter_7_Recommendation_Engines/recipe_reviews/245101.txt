I have made this several times.  I usually just use the kale and I like to use roasted tomatoes.  I add black eyed peas that I cook from dried.  The Cajun seasoning can be very salty so I halve that and add some cayenne for the heat.  Have served to guests and taken to a pot luck.  People want the recipe.

I think this recipe is a great jumping off point, but we didn't love it as written.  The secund time I made it, I added celery, sauteed the creole seasoning to bring out flavors before adding the stock, added 2 Bay leaves, used a little liquid smoke because our hocks aren't processed,  used a mix of mostly spinach greens with a little mustard green, and added just a little splash of cream at the end... THAT soup, my family devoured and asked for again.

I really liked this recipe. I didn't have any black eyed peas. I ended up adding Eckrick smoked turkey sausage for the meat. This dish is quite good. I served corn break along with it.

Made it just like the recipe called for and I usually don't, but this was amazing southern style cooking! I take that back...I did a minor change...I used my homemade chicken bone broth. So good!

Sssooo good! My 10 month old even loved it! I used smoked turkey instead of ham hicks, and I added vinegar and a pinch of sugar. Amazing!

I simmered the ham hocks before adding them to  the soup because I was concerned about the salt since I didn't have unsalted chicken broth.  Excellent recipe. Nice change for New Years. I usually serve the ham hocks, collard greens and black-eyed peas separately.

Yum! And very easy to make. I used a piece of hickory smoked ham steak instead of the ham hocks.

Watch out for the salt in the creole seasoning!  I added this to a slow cooker pot of black eyed peas - also added some leftover rice.  Best soup I ever made.

Made it and loved it.  But I will tell you I have NO idea how much Collard I put it in .  I was a full (and I'm talking FULL) bunch.  The cooked down a lot but they were tender but not overcooked.  I added extra ham because we wanted more meat.  Also instead of using the full amount of   seasoning, I just added one  can of Tomatoes with Chilis (aka Rotel - but a larger non-branded of the same) along with the can already in it.  And also had some zucchini from our CSA basket so I added 2 of those right near the end.  

It was terrific!!!  I'm putting it on my 'go to' recipe list!  Easy and fast AND used some of those collards that I'm running out of ideas on!  Thank you!

My daughter says she hates beans but she loved this soup. I fried 4 slices of bacon in dutch oven to get the bacon grease/oil and set the bacon aside. I added some Sherry cooking wine after sauteeing the garlic and onions and put the chopped bacon and remaining recipes as listed in the recipe (except I used 3 ham hocks because that's how many come in the package).  I used dried black eyed peas in a bag so I p[repared those ahead of time and probably had about 50% more peas than it called for but I think that was okay.  I never had collard greens before and I didn't have the amount suggested but it was really good.  I will make this again and double up on the collard greens.

Woo-hoo, first review. I did make a few changes, some based on the recipe submitter's suggestions. Used olive oil and used all turnip greens. Used ham hocks but my family did agree that polish sausage sliced up would work better. Didn't add tomatoes because we didn't have any. We also agreed that more black eyed peas would be good, too. Never added the hot sauce because one family member isn't big on heat (was going to let people add it to their bowls), but the Cajun seasoning I used (is that the same as creole?) added enough seasoning for us. 
I will make it again, with the tomatoes, more peas, and with sausage instead of the hocks. But the dish got rave reviews from both parents and it's a keeper.
