I made this Pepper Sauce today, and I must say...it is the hottest I've ever had!  But here's the difference...it also has a lot of flavor.  Some people like just heat; but if there's no flavor, then it's no different than a mouthful of fire.  I didn't change anything at all since it was my first time making it.  But maybe next time I will use just 10 habaneros so some of my friends will be able to eat it without bursting into flames!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have little experience with hot sauces, but I saw this and wanted to make it for my hubby who loves anything hot. However, I took someone else's suggestion to only use 10 peppers. I was, at first, disappointed because I tried it and could tolerate it (I'm a bit wimpy). The taste was wonderful, but there was only a little heat. Then it hit me. Wow! This stuff is fantastic! I love it and it was a huge hit in my house.

I am making this sauce again today for the second time in 5 months.  My husband loves it!  So does my son and I.  It is amazing made like buffalo wing sauce.  Melt a stick of butter with a  cup or so of sauce and simmer.  It tones down the heat a little, which is not said as a good or bad thing because obviously people who make this sauce LOVE hot food, it's just simply a fact.  It just happens to be that it is an amazing combination warmed with butter, and is fantastic on crispy wings or as a dipping sauce for tenders or grilled chicken (or pork).  Trust me, try it.  Use as much butter or sauce to your liking-you can't go wrong.  Also, this stuff is amazing straight up on mac and cheese!  Wow! We are addicted to that combo.  Definitely 5 stars!

Wow, I feel just like the other reviewers, great taste/flavor to go with the heat.  My husband likes the hot sauce in the family and I usually stay away, as most are just fire in your mouth.  I made this and it was accepted by everyone.  I did not use Habaneros, I have a garden and tons of hot peppers ( 5 or 6 kinds) and was running out of things to do with them - this was fantastic.  I really think the Mango and green onion does something for these hot peppers, we have had it on chicken, fried pork chops,  with chips, I made a curry meal and we ate it with that.   My husband took it to work for others to try, it is gone and I am ready to go and pick some more peppers.  You will not be unhappy.  Thanks for a great receipe. NOTE: I tried to make this and process it in a pressure cooker like I do other things, it did not taste the same, it was not bad when we opened the jars, but it seemed to be fermenting - tiny bubble inside, not sure why, or what was reacting with what - but it altered the taste, much better fresh  - will try freezing some next time I make a batch and see how that does. WE REALLY LIKE THIS SAUCE.

I wanted this to work very badly so I followed the instructions to the letter. I even had the missus help me out.

The recipe made 4 1/2 cups and smelled putrid. I blended, mixed and even put it through the grinder to try and "thin-it-out." The concoction was still very thick.

I put it in some chili to see if I mixing it with food would eliminate the smell and add some flavor. No way! The overpowering MUSTARD taste and smell was still present.

Think about it, a quarter cup of Dry Mustard. Perhaps if it was eliminated the recipe might be good. I didn't even use the entire quarter cup because I ran out. 

The mixture tastes like a Vodka Mustard Schnapps.

This is a great recipe! Used 15 whole pepper from the garden, did not bother to seed. Great kick and superb flavour. Blended for 6 mins to make sure the seeds were crushed.Ignore the bad review, this was probably from someone who has not developed the heat tolerance or can understand how heat and flavours work together. I will be making this one again.

This sauce is easy to make, just follow the directions. The only thing I did, differently was to blanch the peppers in a half cup of vinegar first, then I continued with the recipe. My family loves hot sauce, and they love that this sauce makes you sit up and notice the food! It has the heat!

This is a tremendous sauce.   I would recommend this to anyone growing hot carib/various habenero peppers.   Very easy to make but use caution protecting your eyes, sking when chopping peppers

This is the BEST!  I modify it slightly, 10 peppers with the seeds removed, and I add about an inch of ginger root.  The mustard I go a little light on, but close to 1/4 cup (which, by the way is the equivalent of 4 Tablespoons).  Oh, and Tumeric.  It is good for you, and heightens the color. I have given jars to a bunch of friends, and they all rave about it, even the people who are somewhat pepper wimps.  One friend hates curry, so I poured some out before adding it and she has been playing around with different spices, so far likes cumin the most. The best thing is how easy it is to whip up.  I am so glad I stumbled onto this recipe.

I made this for a friend who wants a HOT sauce with LOTS of flavor. She went NUTS over this and this is now her favorite! It's awesome over fried chicken or added to almost anything! The different flavors of the curry, mustard and lime truly enhance the habanero peppers and create an amazing balance. I had 45 peppers so I doubled the recipe plus the extra peppers, but still only used 1 1/2 cups of the vinegar to bring out the lime taste more. WOW!!

Very easy to make!  Had great flavor and a good lingering heat.  It would be great with a piece of grilled white fish.  I used frozen mango chunks and omitted the oil.

Have been looking for something this spicy for a long time. Great with just about anything.I like to dip sourdough bread in it and really enjoy the flavor. Also on a hamburg instead of relish.

Definitely going into my file of favorites.  My favorite recipes are the forgiving ones, like this. You can vary many of the ingredients and still come up with an outstanding sauce.  I personally prefer the flavor of the Thai hot peppers in my garden to the much hotter habanero, and the sauce works fine with them.  You can also choose just how hot to make your sauce by how many and what type of peppers to add.  I also went heavier on the mango and the jamaican curry powder and the lime, and a little lighter on the mustard and the vinegar.  It is better if you have the fresh green onions to add to the regular onions, but it is a subtle improvement that many people would not detect.  The best hot sauces are from the Caribbean basin and this is one of the best of the best.

This recipe is excellent with some changes.  I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of mustard powder, I didn't have limes so I used about 1/4 cup of lemon juice, I also used a 16 oz can of sliced mangos drained and rinsed.  I used 12 habanero peppers.  Everything else was the same as the recipe.  Great taste and flavor and will be making this for years to come.  Try this recipe and you won't be disappointed.  Definitely do not use 1/4 cup of mustard powder, that is just silly or wrong!!!!!!

we were super disappointed with this recipe. We cut the peppers down to 10 like some of the other reviews, but it was still WAY to hot. So we made a second batch and cut this one down to 4 peppers, which made it tolerable, but we didn't care for the flavor. Sorry

I substituted ghost chiles for the habaneros, and I substituted berbere for the curry.  I also used a vidalia onion and a peach instead of the mango.  It turned out really well, and it made a large enough batch to share with some friends.  Those friends have been hounding me for more of this stuff even since I made it.  We ended up putting it on just about everything we ate, and we found ourselves inventing excuses to eat something that could be dipped in this sauce/salsa.  It was that good.

I love hot sauce and made this one. It is one of my favorites if not the number one! I've tried alot of different hot sauces and this one has the best flavor as well as having a great kick. The freshness of the lime and onions lend tremendous flavor and the curry sets it apart from most other hot sauces. LOVED IT

This is my go to recipe for pepper sauce. Its flavorful as well as hot. I love what the sweet fruit does to introduce the heat to the pallet. The other ingredients reach out to so many dishes that it uses are endless . People I serve it to  ask me to bring it to diners, and request a bottle for personal use! The credit belongs to you for this masterpiece and I give you full credit.  Thank you so much Trini. I will follow your recipes. Thank you Allrecipes for presenting recipes of true diversity, cultural value, taste and joy through cooking!

Great recipe! I used to experiment with different hot sauce recipes then I found this one and I haven't looked back. I use a variety of peppers that I grow in my garden. (habanero, scotch bonnet, Trinidad scorpion, Carolina reaper, ghost)
Changes: Reduce the amount of mustard powder to 2 Tbsp per batch. Blend the peppers whole (I don't remove the seeds). Warm the sauce up to just before boiling then stick blend to achieve a smooth consistency. When the sauce cools I put it in hard plastic bottles that I have sanitized. (Gatorade is perfect)

This is the third time I am making this sauce. I add scotch bonnet and scorpion peppers this time. Along with Carolina reaper and scorpion pepper sea salt.  It has heat but still a lot of yummy flavor .

This is a wonderful no-cook hot sauce.  It it quite hot by itself and has a very fresh taste.  The heat is not one that lingers too long either.  Once this sauce is put on food the heat kind of mellows out a bit and does not over power.  I have made this a couple of times, and it makes so much I give it out to my friends, and they LOVE it!  It is good on just about everything, but especially good on chicken, pork and believe it or not egg rolls.

OK I made it. Turned out good, it looks good has great flavour, but I wish it was hotter. My wife won’t find it hot enough and she’s from Trinidad and they like their pepper sauce surface of the sun hot.

Didnt make any changes.... might make 2 versions of it. One as the original and one that has less heat.

Anyone have any idea of the shelf life in the frig of this sauce?

I am so pleasantly surprised how this turned out.  I used 5 ghost peppers from my garden (adjusted the pepper quantity so the scovilles would just about match), and had only 2 tbsps of ground mustard on hand, instead of the 4.  It's fresh, and tangy, and hot, and has lots of flavor.  I canned the jars so I won't have to refrigerate them until I am ready to use.

This is my absolute favorite sauce. I put it on nearly anything savory, yet I find it pairs best with pork.
Minor adjustments: I add 1/4 cup of honey, 1 tsp dried ground ginger, 1 tsp liquid smoke, 1 tsp vanilla powder.
Other than that, i follow to the letter. Only fresh mango will do. If I would have to choose canned, I simply will not make it.
This is the best habanero-based sauce I have ever tried, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes spicy food.
Try it, sez me!

Used less mustard in subsequent batches, great flavor. Best with rice and beans. Next batch will be with Carolina reapers.

Incredible!
I made it exactly as written other than I used turmeric instead of curry powder simply because it was what I had on the shelf. I ate it on tortilla chips to test...WOWZA! Super yummy and not as hot as I had expected but definitely a good kick.
I have served it over both pork loin and pork tenderloin and loved it. I had it on a naked hamburger and thought it was incredible. I used it all in 4 weeks and am back to make more.

This sauce was outstanding! I didn't have any limes, but I did have lime juice, so I omitted the lime zest. Only had about 10 habenero's, so I added 6 red savina's to make up the difference. I love using fresh peppers from my garden instead of buying them from a store. I was thinking this sauce was going to be to sweet for me because of the mango, but it came out fantastic! It made more than I was expecting ... almost ran out of bottles. Will be making this one again!!

I use a mix of Habanero and Jalapeno peppers because I enjoy a hotter sauce. I added 2 carrots to the recipe and used olive oil instead. This recipe uses way too much dry mustard powder, I used 2 teaspoons instead.

I plan to make this this year.  I'm growing several kinds of peppers but plan to use my Aji Peppers (50,000 scovilles) for a double batch and then use my sweet ones plus ajis again for a second batch.  Rememebr the purpose of hot peppers is to enhance the flavor not burn your mouth, so play with the varieties!  A recipe like this is more of a blueprint that you can modify

I always buy hot sauce but didn't have any and my food was ready waiting....,I stumbled on this recipe though didn't have all the ingredients, I used: 
3 x garlic, two thirds of a white onion, 4 x scotch bonnet peppers, teaspoon curry powder, salt and apple cider vinegar, forgot to add the oil, didn't have limes etc. I didn't like the colour (my peppers were yellow and lime green, so added a big squeeze of tomato puree. I took the vinegar harshness away with a little bit of brown sugar. It took less than 5 minutes to make and it is deeeelicious, blew my head off with the heat and flavour. Amazing! thank you! I look forward to following the recipe properly next time, the ingredients are on my shopping list.  Though, not sure I need to add the oil - is it necessary?

OMG This is so good. I was completely intimidated by the amount of habeneros, but it really is tasty. It of course hot but you can mellow it out if you need to.  I used equal amounts of butter and a dollop of honey (I hate sweet wings) and it was tremendous but I did also dip the wings in the sauce straight up. I added 2 carrots and used about 10 homegrown habeneroes. I used 2 TBSP of mustard because of what others have said.  This is such a different taste for wings, I haven't been so inspired for wings in a LONG time.  I did make this outside and used all the safety instructions per earlier reviews (thank you). I did remove seeds and membranes as I didn't want my intestinal tract to revolt.

I made this tonight, and it is amazing!  Not for the faint of heart.  Don't kid yourself, now matter how few habanero peppers you use, it's going to have serious heat.  Delicious!!

Awesome! Exactly the flavor I was looking for. The only thing I changed was that I added 5 more Habanero peppers.
