LOVE it!! A HUGE hit with the entire family plus a friend who was over.  I was 1 can short on the green chilies but it was plenty spicy enough for us so I think I'll stick w/that amount again. Thank you for a new soup recipe that'll go into rotation here!!

Very good chowder.  I did make some alterations.  One thing is I would definitely parboil the potatoes prior to putting them in the pan.  Mine are not quite soft enough.  
I did use fresh Hatch green chiles so I did put chicken broth in it.  I also felt it definitely needed more liquid.  I added a can of drained Rotel (green chiles & tomatoes) and a can of cream of chicken soup.  I did not have any cream style corn so I used drained canned corn.  It was perfect!  At the end I threw some cream cheese in just to fatten it up!! LOL  It was a little spicy so that's why I added the cream cheese!!  Enjoy.

I made a few alterations to the recipe, like using way more chile because we like it really hot and making it in a slow cooker instead of in a pan. It was delicious

It was good, I made some changes the 2nd time I made it & I think it enhanced the recipe.  Cook the bacon a little longer than called for (crispy edges) , it gives the soup more of a concentrated bacon flavor. 2 onions vs 1, add a green pepper, 2 stalks of diced celery, 1 jalapeno (the cream kills the heat but you get a little bite vs only green chiles) 3 cans of cream corn vs 2, 4 lbs of chicken vs what the recipe called for. 1 can of condensed cream of  chicken soup and 1 tablespoon of better than bouillon chicken base (this stuff is amazing). The extra corn & chicken flavor really livened it up. I took one of the chicken breasts, cubed it & simmered in some chicken broth until I could shred w/fork and added it to the soup. So you get a mix of shredded & chunks of chicken. I thickened it up w/a little instant mashed potato flakes, easy trick for soups if u want to thicken. I also added some quesadilla cheese to the soup. Top w/diced green onions when serving. Next time I make this I will try some variety of white beans. I think beans would be a nice addition. Thanks Papa Dar. Thumbs up!

This has become a go-to family favorite. I do add chicken stock to thin, and half the chilis because kids. I substitute bacon bits  sometimes. Wonderful recipe - thanks!

We really enjoyed this on a cold winter night. I halved the ingredients since there were only 3 of us. I might add some diced red or green bell pepper along with the onion, just to add some color. And I will cook the potatoes a little longer as some were still a little firm. But this is definitely a keeper.
