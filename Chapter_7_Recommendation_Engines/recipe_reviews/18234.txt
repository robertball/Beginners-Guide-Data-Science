Much praise! After reading the reviews, I was nervous that I might mess this recipe up some how but even I got it right! I nixed the garlic powder and onion powder and used panko for the breadcrumbs. And even though some reviewers mentioned that their dish turned out soggy, I added extra butter anyway. Of course, the one day that I needed fresh scallops, our seafood market here at the beach was out! But frozen worked out just fine. Just let the bag thaw out in a bowl of cold water for about 30 minutes and then dry them between paper towels. The scallops turned out amazing. I am still getting compliments from my house! Thanks!

These were delicious.  I made sure they were very dry after I rinsed them.  I combined the bread crumbs and fresh grated parmesan cheese, used old bay seasoning in place of the spices.  I dipped them quickly in the butter then dredged them in the bread crumb mixture. The only thing I will try differently the next time is broilng them the last few minutes to make the topping a little crunchier.  I served this with Daddy's fried corn as another reviewer had suggested.  Great dinner.  Too bad I didn't have anyone to share it with! (b/f doesn't like scallops so I made it for myself when he was out of town).

This is one of the best scallop recipes we've tried. We used a  parmesan that wasn't as plain as usual and it added a little more flavor to the baked on crust. Also, if you don't let the scallops touch the sides of the baking dish, they tend not to get "chewy". If you're heating this up the next day be sure to put it back in the oven and not the microwave. This is a keeper!

I made this for an appetizer. I used 
el-cheapo "scallop Medallions" which comes frozen from Sam's Club.  They resemble the larger Sea Scallops and obviously are not the same quality as true fresh Sea scallops, however, with this recipe, they tasted like the real thing. To get a more consistent looking scallop, instead of sprinkling the mixture over them, I recommend you first "roll" them in the melted butter and then "roll" them in the mixture in a separate bowl. Then place them in the dish for baking.

*****DELICIOUS*****
I have made this recipe many times and it's always delicious! I usually add 1 to 1 1/2 pounds of medium to large shrimp along with the scallops and then double the bread crumb mixture.

Leftovers are great too! If there are any!  Thanks!

This was great, it reminded me of an Italian dish I used to eat back in Rhode Island. I would only suggest sauting the garlic with the butter rather than adding to the breadcrumbs (it clumps up).  Thanks for the great recipe.

AWESOME!  I made this EXACTLY as the recipe suggests, it definitely WAS NOT soggy, it was DELICIOUS!  I melted my butter in the casserole dish in the oven, with the garlic in at the same time-this took about 3 minutes.  I then took the pan out of the oven, and followed the recipe.  Outstanding flavour, and only took about 7 minutes to throw together!  With a bit of rice and salad, this is a real winner.

I added the crushed garlic with the butter and put it in the oven for a couple minutes before adding the scallops and crumb topping. Delicious. I'll be making these again soon.

I halfed the recipe and added a tsp of crushed red pepper with the bread crumbs (Me and my hubby love spicy food!). It turns out SO good! My hubby loves it! Thanks!

I used baby bay scallops, and our family likes the taste, and the crunchy topping is great.  However, we agree that as a main course, it was just a little too much.  If we make this again, it will be as an appetizer or a side dish.

Great and easy recipe! I melted the butter in a glass dish in the oven as it preheated and also added the fresh minced garlic to the butter as well.  After the butter was melted, I put the scallops in the dish and rolled them around before adding to a ziploc bag that had the breadcrumb/parmesan mixture in it. This worked out perfectly to evenly cover the scallops and save time too!  I followed the recipe exactly except for baking for fifteen minutes then broiling for two more to make sure the top was crispy! This smelled Sooo good while baking and tasted great too! The squeeze of lemon juice on each serving was a perfect way to enhance these scallops. I can't wait to make them again. Thanks so much! Next time, I might add some Old Bay in place of the paprika as another reviewer suggested. I'm sure it will be a great variation too!

Simple and quick, two of my favorite things in a weeknight recipe! I made my own bread crumbs (two pieces of eight grain bread, processed until finely crumbled, then toasted in a 400 degree oven for 5 minutes). I used garlic powder in the crumbs, not on the scallops. I also squeezed the juice of one lemon over the scallops before I added the toasted bread crumbs over the top. (The lemon really freshens the flavor.) Baked at 400 for 15 minutes. Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your scallops. **My trick - when you press on a cooked scallop, it should "give" the same way the pad of your thumb does when pressed. Perfect doneness, every time!

This was such a great and easy way to make scallops!  I kept all of the spices the same - the only thing I changed was the technique.  First I put all the spices, breadcrumbs, and the garlic in a ziplock bag.  Then I put the melted butter and the scallops in a bowl and swished them around.  Then I used a slotted spoon to fish out the scallops and added them to the ziplock bag of spices and shook the bag until the scallops were coated.  Meanwhile I poured the remaining butter into a casserole dish and then put the breaded scallops on top.  I baked them at 400 for 15 minutes and then broiled them for 5.  I served the scallops over angel hair.

This was delicious and easy.  I changed it around a bit.  I substituted bread crumbs mixture for premade Panko parmesan herb bread crumbs..found in baking aisle of Kroger.  Dipped scallops in butter and dragged them in crumb mixture. Last 2 minutes of baking broiled them to get them more brown and crispier.  Served on top of vermicelli.  Made a sauce on the stove top with 1 cup of orange juice, 1T of dijon and 1t basil...poured over scallops and vermicelli...was delicious!

I honestly had to chuckle at the many bad reviews this recipe got because it allegedly had "too much breadcrumbs." I can understand that it may contain more garlic than some people would like. However, at least here in New England, this type of dish is referred to as "baked scallop casserole." It's supposed to be bready. I'm not sure if it's just a regional recipe, but I've always had baked scallops prepared this way. Maybe people were just thrown off by the recipe's title. (PS I noticed that one reviewer said her breadcrumbs came out soggy. I have no idea on earth what she did, but I didn't get that result by far.) I worked in a restaurant for many years and believe that this recipe was very, very good. I already have plans to make this dish again -- SOON!

This was wonderful.  I added shrimp to the recipe and put it on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper so it wouldn't stick.  Wonderful flavor.  So we had a fisheman's plate with scallops and shrimp. If you make it as it is then you can't go wrong this recipe.

Company Worthy!  I dipped the sea scallops in melted butter, then rolled in the breadcrumb mixture.  I ran them under the broiler at the end to solve the "mushy breadcrumbs" some reviewers wrote about.  Served over a bed of fresh baby spinach leafs, grape tomatoes, small marinated mozzarella balls, and a homemade balsamic vinaigrette drizzed over all.

These were wonderful - after a little modification.  I coated the scallops in the melted butter and placed them in the dish. I used panko bread crumbs and fresh parsley and, what I think is important, moistened the mixture with additional melted butter rather than using the crumbs dry. I also left out the Parmesan cheese because for my tastes it didn't belong there.  The 20 minute baking time was perfectly accurate.  Delicious, but I don't think I would have cared for these so much had I prepared them exactly as the recipe directed.

Absolutely superb!  Unlike the broiled scallop recipe, this one is not so dependant on the quality of scallops. I used the cheap-o frozen ones from Sam's and they still turned out GREAT!  I used crushed stove top stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs for additional texture; and squeezed fresh lemon over it after baking.  GREAT recipe.

This is delicious.  Unfortunately my husband didn't like this.  Not because of the recipe but he doesn't like scallops.  I thought this dish was as good as any restaurant.  I used low fat marg. and left out the parsely and parmesan as I didn't have them.

I had to search for this recipe, and it was exactly what I had in my head. It was really good, but I thought it was too much breading.  More important is that I had the most gorgeous bay scallops, and their delicate taste was somewhat overpowered by the seasoning in the Italian breadcrumbs.  Next time I would make my own with subtle spices and use less. I have not tasted such sweetness since my Long Island childhood.

Delicious recipe for scallops!  I used large scallops that I purchased at Costco - about 12 - and I dipped each in butter then rolled in the breadcrumbs and placed in baking dish.  It was absolutely yummy!  I also tried this on catfish and that was just as good.  Put catfish fillets in lightly greased baking dish, drizzle butter on top and pour bread crumbs on top - both my hubby and his mom thought is was delicious.  Two new seafood recipes for me!!!!  Thanks!

This had a good flavor, but I did not like how the bread crumbs stayed dry on top of the dish - next time I would coat each scallop in butter and breadcrumbs before placing in dish.  I used the big frozen scallops from Costco and had to cook about 10 minutes longer.

My husband brought home a bag of frozen bay scallops, and I had no idea what to do with them.  I am not a seafood eater and therefore had no idea how to cook them.

This recipe was easy, fast, and delicious.  I even ate a serving of them.  They were quite tasty.  (I just can't get past the thought of eating a shellfish, but my hubby devoured them.)  The natural liquid from the scallops blends with the butter and topping to make sort of a bubbly creamy sauce.

I didn't have onion powder, so I increased the garlic powder by half.  I used California-style garlic powder with the parsley already in it, since I didn't have parsley either.

Definitely toss the garlic with the butter and scallops.  The warm butter brings out the garlic flavor, and the garlic sort of infuses the butter.

No reason not to give this dish five stars.  Will make again for a dinner party as an appetizer.

This was delicious!  Instead of adding the garlic powder, I sauteed fresh garlic in the butter and added dill weed and lemon juice.  The results were fantastic.  My kids don't eat seafood, so that's why I gave it a poor kid friendly rating.  This is the first time I made scallops, and I really appreciated how easy and time-saving this was to make!  Thank you John!

Would definately make again but with a few changes.  I cut down the bread crumbs by half and still had alot left over.  Unless you like a super thick coating of bread crumbs, it's just way too much.  I would also cut down on the amount of butter by at least half.  The scallops were "swimming" in it.  Too much unnecessary fat!
Overall, this was a very elegant and rich dish when you really want something special.

We eat scallops often and I have cooked them many ways, but this way has to be the best yet!  This recipe is very easy to make and very delicious.
Thank you!  Maguy

The only change I made to this recipe is I baked them about 7 minutes longer and did not experience soggy bottoms as other reviewers stated.  I can't wait to try this recipe on company!  Thank you for sharing!

This is a great recipe, so easy to put together.  The only thing I changed was to use plain bread crumbs and to add 3 strips of bacon, well cooked and crumbled into the topping. We loved the results! Thanks.

I prefer the large sea scallops and cooked them for 30 minutes.  This is the best baked scallop dish I've ever had aside from "Pesto/Wine sauted Scallops".  This is easy and every bit as good as any gourmet restaurant!!  Thanks

Yum.  Very tasty, my hubby even ate them (kids are out for the night).  I'm out of paprika so I used Old Bay seasoning as another reviewer suggested.  Terrific, thanks John!

This wasn't bad, but I had higher expectations based on the reviews.  I made the recipe as shown, but it seemed to have WAY too much breading (even after tossing to coat all sides with the butter), so I only used about 75% of the bread crumb mixture.  After 20 minutes, the scallops were perfectly done, but the breading was still soggy.  Maybe it's my oven.  I will try again, but either in the broiler or with a higher temperature setting, and definitely less breading.

I have used this recipe for over a year now, and everytime I make this whether it just be for myself or a guest, it just gets better and better.  I absolutely will NOT try another scallop recipe since finding out about this one.  Thank you for sharing !!!!

So I am still the world's worst cook....but this made me look pretty darn good.  I didn't use garlic - instead I used garlic salt.  I also added crab and cooked it a little longer (about 30 minutes) to get a nice baked cheesey kind of taste.  Wonderful!!!!

This was great.  Very good flavor. We used the large scallops cause that is what we had and it still came out great.  Just remember to cook slightly longer if using the bigger scallops. 
It was great with lemon squeezed on top.

EXCELLENT!! This was a hit with the hubby. It was so easy to make and even better to eat. First time I fixed it I scaled it down to serve 2 people, but it was so good the next time I had to leave it at 4 just so we could have more the next day! I have been adding some salad shrimp to the recipe also ever since. That just made it all the more delicious and stretches it much further. I will be making it for a dinner party next week and can't wait to hear the raves. I am going to go ahead and make copies of the recipe before hand, because I know I everyone will want it!!!
Keep up the good work John!

I didn't have many of the seasonings called for in the recipe so i just used powdered garlic and curry powder. WOW it was delicious! I made it for my boyfriend when he got home from work and he all but licked the plate.

the only thing i would recommend is drying the scallops really well then rolling them in the breadcrumbs, place them in the butter than sprinkle the rest of the dressing on top.

Excellent recipe, however very rich.   I made a few revisions. I melted the butter , garlic, and 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice in the oven first.  I rolled both  scallops and shrimp in the butter and then lightly sprinkled with the panko breadcrumbs seasoned with old bay.  Bake for 16 minutes and broil for the last 4 minutes.  Squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the top once you remove them from the oven. I served mine over rice noodles with a tomato saled sprinkled with seasoned rice wine vinegar.  Very filling meal and everyone enjoyed it.

This is the best scallops recipe ever.  I followed the directions to a T and served over fettucini and topped with a wine garlic butter cream sauce.  Delish!  Can't wait to make it again.

I think this recipe is one of those you can make many adjustments to and it will still taste good.  I used sea scallops and it worked out fine.  I chopped fresh basil along with the garlic and simmered both in butter (as previously suggested) before coating with breadcrumbs (Panko in my case).  I left out the onion powder and parsley and still it was full of flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe for lunch today. Since I'm a weight watcher, I ommited the butter and just sprayed my baking dish with pam.  The scallops were delicious. I know that I will definitely use this recipe again.

So I followed the recipe exactly because that's how I believe recipes should be rated. It was pretty good, but not amazing. I think it becomes amazing when you make the changes that are listed in the other reviewer's comments. It's a recipe that should definitely be tried!

These were pretty good, made as is.  When I make them again, I will use way less butter, prob only a tbsp.  Not my favorite, but a decent scallop dish; I served it w/dels, bacon cheddar mashed, and green bean bundles and they were well received.

Excellent! I did make a few adjustments to suit my fams taste. Added 1 teaspoon of garlic salt to melted butter plus 1 tablespoon Sauterne wine and 1/4 cup shallots(use 'em or loose 'em thing). Decreased onion and garlic powders to 1/2 teaspoon, omitted garlic cloves, used Panko bread crumbs with Parmesan/Ramano. The first time I made scallops, the kid didn't like them at all, this time he ate all of his and some of mine! Thanks so much for sharing your talent!

Positively delicous!  I made these for my dad for Father's Day and he loved, them along with the rest of the family.  I used 2 lbs. of sea scallops because those are his favorite.  I also used fresh parm. cheese instead of the dry kind.  The extra drippings in the dish went real well over the twice baked potatoes that I also served!

This was phenomenal!  Perfect blend of seasonings.  The only thing I didn't have was the onion powder, but I don't think it made a huge difference.  The only change I made was a tablespoon less butter, and a drizzle of white wine to the butter on the bottom the pan.  FANTASTIC.  I went looking for the left overs the next morning, and my daughter informed me she'd wiped them out the night before.  This will go on my rotation list for sure!

Made this last night with panko crumbs and tossed the scallops in half the panko crumb mixture then put it in a dish and covered the rest of the scallops with the remaining panko mixture!  Delicious!  Highly recommend this recipe!

Delicious!  Here's my consolidated recommendation of changes based on reviews:  Melt the butter.  Add 2-3 cloves of diced garlic and ~1/4 diced onion and sautee in the oven for 3-5 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup of white wine.    Pat scallops dry, dredge in egg yoke, then roll in the mixture.    Broil for the last few minutes to crisp the top.

Perfect! I followed the recipe almost exactly- instead of melting the butter I cut it up and placed it on top of and around the scallops. I used Trader Joes frozen jumbo scallops thawed first in a bag under cold water for 30 minutes.

I made this last night and really enjoyed it.  I had one pound of sea scallops and baked them using an 8x8 glass pan.  I melted the butter with garlic in the pan prior to adding the scallops.  I also dredged each scallop in the butter and then rolled them in the bread crumbs.  I had italian seasoned crumbs on hand so I used those and added garlic powder, oregano, Old Bay seasoning, and Parm cheese.  I baked @ 400 for twenty minutes according to the recipe, and they turned out great.  While the tops were crispy, the bottoms did turn out a little soggy, but it didn't detract from the meal.  I may just decrease the butter slightly in the future, but it was a great recipe and I will make them again.  Thanks for sharing!

All I can say is WOW. This was also the first time I have made scallops.  Since there were only two of us, I made just a little over 1/2 pound.  There were 12 sea scallops.  I did make the crumb mixture according to the recipe with 2 changes. I used panko for the crumbs and added a 2 tablespoons of melted butter to the crumb mixture.  Then I piled it on each buttered scallop in the dish.  They baked in about 15 minutes and the crumb mixture browned very nicely because of the butter in the mixture.  I served this with Dreamfields lo carb linguini tossed with a lemon/butter/oil mixture with herbs.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

Very good!  I've never cooked scallops before so this was a great way to start.  I didn't change anything and my entire family enjoyed it.

Made this last night and it was fabulous! I sauteed fresh garlic in butter very lightly, added it to a well greased ramekin placed defrosted and well dried Scallops (Schwann) brand into the dish sprinkled with parmesan and panko and the onion powder placed in a very hot oven and turned the stove to high broil for 2 minutes, They came out lightly browned a perfect. Might make again tonight.

Super easy and fast!  Watch the scallops closely because they overcook easily.  Used a 13x9" pan so scallops could be covered evenly with bread crumbs in a single layer.  Reduced garlic to one clove.

We really enjoyed this dish!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and combined the minced garlic with the melted butter,then tossed the scallops with the butter as I added them to the dish.  A 2-lb bag of frozen sea scallops from Costco fit an 8x11 casserole perfectly and were done in about 25 minutes.

Delicious! I will take one of the reviewer's suggestion and spray with Pam instead of using butter. There was just too much of it. Otherwise, it was delicious.

These scallops were fast & restaurant presentation worthy. I will admit that I was hesitant to try cooking any kind of fish (it seems so delicate) but this recipe made it easy. Note to those novice chefs: MAKE SURE that you dice up your garlic well. I apparently did not make the pieces as small as they could have been & got more than I bargained for on a few bites.

I made this for dinner last night for my dad and I!!  It was REALLY good, the only thing we did differently (other than cutting the recipe in half) was combining the minced garlic with the melted butter, then we dipped the scallops in that then rolled them in the bread-crumb mixture.  Then we put them onto a pan with non-stick spray.  They came out DELICIOUS!  We will definitely make this again, only when my mom is home to share it with us!

4 stars for taste; 5 for simplicity.  Worked well with either dry bread crumbs or ritz crackers.  I've only used this with frozen large sea scallops, so I anticipate an even better dish using bay and/or fresh.  OK, the bay scallops are better!  I can't get enough of this.  You can make the dry seasoning extra and keep in the refrigerator indefinately, making this dish that much faster.

Soooo good! OMG, this was easy and yummy and a will be making it again and again. My only alteration was that I had to use dried minced garlic in place of the powder and the minced. I only used about a tablespoon total...and it was amazingly yummy. Thank you for a great recipe.

I think next time I will use less topping, or more scallops.

One of the best scallop recipes I've seen.  I used panko bread crumbs and used ocean scallops instead of bay since that's what I had on hand.  Delicious, quick recipe that's impressive for guests.  Thanks, John!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!! My first time cooking scallops. My husband loves them, I hated them..UNTIL NOW!  Like a few other readers, I added exta seasonings, like Old Bay, and rolled the scallops in the seasoned bread crumbs before plopping them in the melted butter...then I simply baked them at 400 degrees in my convection oven for 25 minutes. NOW, I LOVVVVVVE scallops(this recipe only, though)...lol THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

I gave this 5 stars because my scallops came out so nice and tender. I melted the butter and garlic in the microwave, then just coated the scallops in the breading/cheese mixture. Then put the individually coated scallops in the baking dish. I did make the mistake of adding a little dribble of lemon juice in the baking dish after they baked and that did make them mushy. I don't think they were before I did that. Leftover, reheated in the oven, they were still tender and tasty. A good way to make scallops. I will make them again.

This recipe was amazing; I ended up using jumbo sea scallops. Additionally, I omitted the onion/garlic powder and used garlic herb breadcrumbs instead. Also, we dredged the scallops in the melted butter before dredging in the breadcrumb mixture (extremely healthy, I know) and drizzled the remaining butter over the top before baking. They turned out golden and brown with just the perfect hint of crispiness. We ended up making them again just a night later--Thank you SO much for this recipe!

these were just as good as a Mystic CT restaurants "Seafood Bake".  Awesome.  melted butter in oven with garlic and then rolled scallop in butter before coating with breading.  Baked for 17 minutes in a convetional oven.  EXCELLENT!

Wow! This was excellent!  This was my first time making scallops and they turned out really good.  I only had a pound of scallops so I cut the bread crumbs down to 1/3 cup and left everything else the same. I can't wait to make this again!

This dish was a hit with my husband and our friends. To give it a litte kick, I added some cayenne pepper. I cut back on the butter by using 2 1/2 tablespoons of Smart Balance and 1/2 tablespoon of butter.

Delicious dish!  I sauteed fresh onion and garlic in butter first, per other reviewers' advice.  I forgot the parsley (would have used fresh instead of flakes) but otherwise stuck to the recipe for the dry ingredients.  Phenomenal flavor, will definitely serve again and again!!!

These were SO Delicious - and SO Easy (Perfect combination :-)!
We have been trying to eat healthier lately, so I made just a couple of changes:  I used 2 tbsp. butter and 2 tbsp. olive oil instead of all 4 tbsp. butter. (I'm going to try all olive oil next time; I think it'll be just as good, plus a little healthier.) I also used 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs and 1/4 cup wheat germ instead of all bread crumbs (we couldn't even tell the difference!). I served the scallops with brown rice, steamed broccoli and a side salad; all of which went together perfectly.
I have to say again...these were some Absolutely Delicious scallops!  Thank you so much!!!  :o)

Wow.  Did not expect these to be THIS GOOD!  I used sea scallops.  Used 2 tbsp butter, and 2 tbsp olive oil.  Used crumbled crackers for the top (I bet butter crackers would be really good for this...) Added extra grlic, and some cayenne for a little bit of a kick.  Great recipe!

I used this topping with 1# of tilapia the other night.  Yummy!  I made everything per the recipe and baked it for 15 minutes.  The fish was moist, tender, and flaky.  The topping was almost excellent: I thought it needed salt and pepper mixed into it.

With the amount of bread crumbs used, I thought that this dish would turn out with a firm, crunchy topping.  My dish turned out a bit soggy.  I used bay scallops that were frozen and thawed.  Perhaps I will try the dish again with fresh scallops.

This would have been a five star if there hadn't been so much bread crumb mixture. The garlic- butter flavor was delicious on the larger sea scallops (frozen ones defrosted in the microwave, rinsed and drained well). I wonder if some of the reviews that said these were soggy was because they didn't drain well after rinsing (as the recipe stated) ??  I agreed with other reviews in using about HALF the butter, and HALF the bread crumb mixture.  
Using the larger scallops, I baked about 15 minutes longer; in individual-serving casserole dishes (maybe that's why mine was not soggy?) Served with "Daddy's Fried Corn and Onions" (from this site) with fresh chopped tomatoes; added just before serving,  canned green beans,and baked crispy potato wedges (frozen ones- and baked at same time as the scallops. From freezer to table in about 45 minutes! WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN. Maybe tommorrow!  :)

Good basic recipe, but I used only half the bread crumb mixture otherwise it overwhelms the taste of the scallops. I used it with sea scallops, next time I'll try it with the bay.

Didn't have fresh garlic so had to just use the powder - still tasted wonderful.  I did add some cayenne pepper for kick.  Will definitely make this again.

My husband and I thought this was excellent.  The scallops were perfectly cooked through. I only used a 1/4 cup of the breadcrumb mixture to coat the scallops.  The coating got nice and brown in the 20 minutes of baking. I substituted Old Bay Seasoning in place of the garlic powder and paprika, and I used 2 cloves of garlic, minced, and less parmesan cheese than the original recipe called for.  Also, we've cut down on our use of butter, so I melted "Take Control" spread and it worked just as well.  Again, a splash of lemon at the end rounded out the flavor.  Easy to make.  We love scallops so we'll definitely try this recipe again.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is because I melted the garlic and butter together in baking dish first, and then mixed the scallops around in the butter and garlic.  Then I poured a little of the mixed dry ingredients over the scallops and mixed them together; then poured the rest of the dry mix on top.  It tasted rich and terrific, and will definitely make again.

This recipe was excellent!!  I followed the recipe exactly, only thing I did was take advise from others, and tossed the scallops in the butter, then tossed them in a zip lock bag with all the dried ingredients.  They were done in 20 minutes, perfect. This is a real keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

Excellent recipe.  I substituted Yoki gluten free seasoned casava flour for the breadcrumbs to make this gluten free, otherwise no changes, and it was perfect!

Yum!  I pretty much followed the recipe, except I used panko crumbs (to add texture and avoid sogginess) and stirred the garlic into the butter instead of adding it to the crumb mixture.  Delicious....one of our new favorites!

Just going to give this four stars, it is really good just seems to be missing something.  I think I will try and throw a little cayenne pepper, or some crushed red pepper in the next time I make it.  Look for an update when I make it again.

This was the first time I prepared scallops and thought this recipe was ok.  I think I might prefer them broiled next time.  A number of reviewers mentioned that they broiled theirs and I should have tried that method.

This was AWESOME! Savory and buttery on the bottom and crunchy and flavorful on the top! I added a lb of shrimp and doubled it. I mixed the garlic with the butter to prevent it from clumping with the dry ingredients and used panko!!! YUM! Thanks for sharing.

This was great - light and tasty.  Followed other reviews and melted the butter with the garlic.  Used 1 lb sea scallops (all they had) and 1/2 lb shrimp.  Lightly coated the tops with butter, and followed the rest of the directions.  Cooked it about 15 minutes, and wish my broiler wasn't broken, because that would've added the perfect crunch.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Yum.

Wonderful and easy dish to make.  Prepared as directed and served over angel hair pasta.  Even my children loved it.  Would have been a 5 star rating but I felt the butter sauce was too heavy and needed brightening up with.  I will be making this again and adding a bit of lemon juice to the recipe to see if it cuts the heaviness.

DELICIOUS. Best part: My husband, who is a beginner cook, made these for me and they came out perfectly! Newbies should not be intimidated by this recipe!

MONEY SAVER TIP: Save $$ on spices and just add Emeril's Original Essence instead. Gave it the garlic taste we loved.

EFFICIENCY TIP: Make extra bread crumbs and store them. They also work well on chicken. We used them on frozen pieces of goat cheese (dipped in egg then bread crumbs) and lightly flash fried the pieces and served them on top of a salad. Ooey, gooey goat cheese salad bites! YUM!

Not sure what I did wrong.  I rinsed and drained very well the scallops, but the bread crumb mixture didn't mix well in the butter.  Mushy mess.  However, the family did like the flavor.  Next time I will pat scallops dry and roll in bread crumbs like others recommended.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong (this was my first time making scallops), but these didn't turn out all that great.  The texture was fabulous, but the flavor just left a weird aftertaste in my mouth.  Not recommended.

I used small sea scallops.  I also followed other reviewers' suggestions and tossed the scallops in the melted butter, then coated them with the bread crumb mixture. I sprinkled the leftover crumb mixture over the top, and drizzled the leftover melted butter over it.  Since I used the Progress Garlic & Herb seasoned bread crumbs, I omitted the onion and garlic powder.  These were delicious - I will make this recipe again.

Did not like.  Could be that I no longer like scallops?  I tried the breading alone and it was so-so, a tad too garlicky for me.  So many people reviewed this saying even if they don't like seafood they liked this so I had high hopes :(

This dish was fabulous, the only thing I changed was added a dash of lemon juice before the bread crumb mixure and some red pepper flakes. I served it over mashed potatoes. The bread crumbs I used were Texas Toast croutons and put them in the food processor. OMG hubby and I loved . loved , loved it !!!! Great recipe, I will definately be making this again.

FANTASTIC!!!!! VERY EASY & OH SO YUMMY!! I MADE A BOO BOO & MIXED THE 4 TBSP OF MELTED BUTTER IN W/THE SEASONINGS, BUT IT WAS STILL FINE--IT MAY HAVE JUST HELPED THE SEASONINGS STICK TO THE SCALLOPS BETTER...I DID ALSO PUT THE BUTTER IN THE CASSEROLE DISH THOUGH...IF YOU LOVE THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT, CARRABBA'S--THE ENTRE, SPIEDINO DE MARE--THIS TASTES EXACTLY THE SAME & IT'S MY FAVE!!

So easy and delicious! I used panko bread crumbs instead. I also used 2 TBS of butter and 1 lb of scallops. Will make again for sure!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I did tweak it a bit to make it a little lighter.  I only used a small fraction of the butter recommended and a little olive oil on the bottom of the pan. Added fresh onion and oregano to the breadcrumb mixture along with recommended spices. Ended up being too much bread crumb mixture because I did not have the butter to soak up the bread crumbs so next time I'll go lighter on the bread crumbs. I also broiled the dish for a few minutes after baking.

This recipe is awesome.  I made it just as written, and the scallops came out perfect.  I wasn't sure if I was suppose to seperate each scallop so I placed them in a baking dish touching.  The topping came out crispy.  My husband couldn't stop eating them.

I just made these scallops and they were amazing!!! So easy to make and super fast! I just didn't know what to make for dinner and saw that we had some frozen scallops... found this recipe... and YES! I GOT A DOUBLE THUMBS UP FROM THE BOYFRIEND! I made them as instructed with the only differences being that I used frozen scallops, and minced dried onions because I didn't have the powder.  I did dredge them in the butter then bread crumb mix first, then I topped with remaining mix.  They were moist, crunchy and delicious... I highly recommend.

Better than any restaurant!  I substituted olive oil for butter -- dipped the scallops in the oil, then rolled in the breading mixture -- then put in a "Pam sprayed" 9X13 pan, sprinkled the leftover breading mixture over all the scallops.  I did broil them for a few minutes once they were done baking.  These were PERFECT!  Not at all mushy (I did follow other reviewers' suggestions and blotted the scallops dry first).  We will definitely make this again!

Super good!  Be sure to use the small frozen scallops. My sister used the big ones and hers turned out rubbery. I have made this several times - my husband loves it and so have dinner guests. Very easy to throw together.

I don't eat seafood, but have to go by the rest of my family.  They loved it!  I made just a few minor adjustments. After rinsing and draining, I placed the scallops on paper towels in a dish in the refrigerator while I prepared the rest of the recipe so that they were very dry. I added about 3 tablespoons of white wine to the melted butter.  I baked them for 15 minutes, then broiled them for about 4 minutes.  I thought this was an extremely easy recipe to prepare.  Thanks!

This is the best thing we've eaten in a long time! I made a few small changes based on what I had on hand...we live on the coast of Maine, so I used fresh sea scallops (big, but fresh from the water and oh-so-flavorful!). I didn't have bread crumbs so I crumbled some Ritz crackers and a few seasoned croutons. We didn't have grated Parmesan cheese, so I used the shaker kind. I also put thin slices of Provolone cheese over the scallops with the crumb mixture. I did not have garlic cloves, but used garlic powder. And I added a bit of white cooking wine to the butter mixture. These were amazing!! We can't wait to have them again!

These scallops were good, but with a few modifications they could be great.  I am definitely cutting back on the butter next time, or using olive oil as some other reviewers suggested, because this dish was a little too rich for me.  Also, I'll be sure to dry the scallops before I toss them with the butter, because a lot of liquid came out during cooking, and things got a little soggy.  All in all, the taste was good and this recipe was super simple.

This recipe is incredible. I halved everything because I only used about a half pound of large bay scallops for 2 people. I dipped the scallops in the butter and then rolled them into the breadcrumb mixture. The cook time of 20 minutes was still right on, except I broiled them the last 4 minutes to make them crispier on top. Loved it, thanks!

Great recipe! Took the advice on another review and kept the scallops away from the sides so they wouldn't end up chewy. Dried really well to prevent soggyness of the crumbs that others have mentioned. I used 16 oz of frozen small medallions. For lower carbs, replaced the bread crumbs with crushed seasoned (hot/spicy) pork rinds and left the paprika out since the pork rinds have them. Turned out delicious. Would make again!

Did not like this at all. Probably my fault though, only had frozed scallops on hand and the final product ended up really salty. (When frozen, some companies soak seafood in brine.) Didn't like the topping either, it really did not have any flavor.  Will probably not try again, even if I do have fresh scallops.

These were great. We mixed all of the dry ingredients together, holding back the cheese, and then put them in with the scallops and mixed it all around. We then melted the  recommended butter and added some lemon juice(2tbsp) and poured it over everything. We then tossed the scallops again and coated them with the cheese. Baked for 20 minutes and they were great so thanks again!

This came together very quickly and easily.  Paired with the right sides, it would be a great quick main course for surprise company.  I used frozen scallops and they defrosted quickly and tasted great!

I'm not sure what happened, but this wasn't very good.  The breading/topping  was mushy.  I love scallops but this recipe just did not work out.

These would have been way too overcooked if I hadn't baked them at 17 minutes at 375, and even then they were still just a bit overdone.

This was deeelicious! I added a little bit of old bay to the breadcrumbs and I sauteed the garlic with some shallots (no onions on hand) It had alot of flavor and I paired it with the asparagus & angel hair pasta for a quick and tasty meal.  My whole family (including my 5 year old) loved it.

Fabulous! I used sea scallops cut into bay-scallop-size pieces, and patted them dry after rinsing. Also turned them in the butter so they were covered before adding the topping. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks, John, for such a delicious scallop dish!

This was EXCELLENT!  I added a bit extra garlic and used diced onions instead of onion powder.  I also did not include the parmesan cheese.  I will definitely make again!  And my husband even liked it as leftovers the next night - but be sure to reheat in the oven and not the microwave.

I'll go 5 stars because the flavor was rich but complimentary and yet SSOoo easy! I used Italian bread crumbs and they tasted fine. I didn't put in the extra garlic, but will next time BUT I'll saute it in the butter first!

The recipe has possibilities... but I preferr to have my breadcrumb topping wetter.  The scallops were much better the second day after the butter managed to soak into the topping.

I would recommend that you add buuter ... the topping was just too dry for my taste.

I just love this recipe.  The 1st time I made it, I added about 8 ozs. of shrimp & used 1 tsp of the minced garlic from the jar.

I didn't drain the scallops enough so it appeared a little runny. I just dumped more bread crumbs in the dish & mixed it & baked a few more minutes.

The 2nd time I made it I just mixed everything together with a cup of bread crumbs & it came out perfect.

Will HAPPILY made this over & over again.  Great & easy dish for company.

Thanks.

Excellent recipe.  It makes the scallops tender and the flavor, oh my, the flavor!  Definitely worth 5 stars!  I made one minor change and used regular bread crumbs as I don't like the seasoned.

The garlic is pretty overpowering.  Next time I would decrease the cloves from 3 to 1 so maybe more of the scallop taste could come through.

DELICIOUS!!!! I will be making this again and again. If you like scallops and garlic this is for you. I did add lemon juice to the recipe and increased the cheese slighty and decreased the bread crumbs slightly.  I baked it in the casserole dish with no lid so it did not come out "soggy". I love it and my husband loves it, Thanks for the great recipe John

I too am from new England and agree with other reviewers, this is THE way to prepare scallops.  I did use all of the bread crumb mixture and had no trouble with them being soggy.  I did add a little bit of olive oil to the butter.  It was very quick and easy to prepare and most important, my two year old and husband loved these scallops.  If it is too cold to grill them, we will fix scallops this way again!

What a great, delicious and easy recipe.  I used the large scallops and they were absolutely delicious.  I also added a dash of cajun spice which gave it a little kick.  It was great!

I took other reviewers advice and melted the butter in the pan, rolled the scallops in the melted butter after rinsing them, and then rolled them in the crumb mixture.  I had no problems with the reading being overwhelming or too mushy.

Absolutely delicious!  I used bigger sea scallops and sliced them in half.  So moist and flavorful.  Can't wait to try this with bay scallops.  I also used shrimp.  WOW!  Loved them.  We also prepared some scallops and shrimp with the sautéed scallop recipe so we had a delicious combination for dinner.  For this recipe  I added Old Bay seasoning due to personal preference.  I also prepared them a little different, following the advice of other reviewers. I rolled them in the melted butter/garlic, then rolled them on the Panko crumb mix.  Then placed them in cooking dish.  Easy and quick.  The hints that I followed from other reviewers that really helped we're:  1.  Make sure you dry them off completely after rinsing.  2.  Add garlic to the melted butter instead of the crumb mixture.  3.  Use Panko bread crumbs.  Thank you.

Winner!Made this tonight and it was delicious. Took the suggestions of cooking the garlic and butter together and tossing the scallops to the dry ingredients before adding them to the casserole dish. I also added spinach to the pasta at the end. The crumbled bacon added a nice touch.I made a wine garlic sauce to pour over the pasta. Why go to a fancy restaurant when you can cook like one!

It takes about 2min to saute bay scallops, and it's impossible to improve on the flavor of fresh scallops by adding anything more than lemon and butter. I gave this recipe a sincere chance, but it just didn't work for me. There was a slight bitterness to the scallops, they weren't as tender as when sauteed, and the breadcrumbs that got down in the liquid were disgustingly mushy. Why go to all this trouble to ruin a perfectly good scallop?

Delicious lightly breaded scallops, perfect blend of seasonings. I melted 2T butter in a bowl then placed rinsed and dried scallops and coated with butter. Poured all spice ingred in ziplock bag. Place scallops in bag, shake to coat. Baked 20 min and were prefect.

LOL second review... I signed in to rate it then saw I had completed one already 5 years ago. This time,I followed recipe exactly except melted the butter (with minced garlic) in casserole dish in preheated oven for 3 minutes. So delicious. Perfect flavor. I shared recipe with family members but can't wait to make it for my Mom when I move back East.

The flavor was ok, too much breading to my taste.  In my oven, I didn't need 20 minutes; 15 would be enough.  My kids love this dish though.

Wonderful!  I mixed the warm melted butter with the MINCED garlic and tossed with the scallops before placing in the casserole dish.  After baking for 15 minutes I also placed them under the broiler to get a crispier, crunchier topping.  Marvelous!

So easy!  So fabulous!  I used the biggest scallops I could find, dried them off with a thirsty towel, found a baking dish that was just big enough to hold them all, and used all of the ingredients as the original recipe called for.  I DID let them bake for an extra 4-5 minutes, because of their size, but they turned out just beautifully.  Served 'em up with whole wheat linguini that had a splash of extra virgin olive oil, and about 3 tsp. of Bay seasoning--it was perfect!

This is my favorite go to recipe for a last minute dinner! It is soooo simple but tastes sooo good! One thing I did change was the amount of bread crumbs. The amount the recipe calls for is a little too much for my taste, so I just eye ball it and use just enough to cover the scallops. I have also used this recipe for a few different kinds of mild white fish and it was great!

We loved them. Never tried to make scallops before, wasn't sure my fussy crew would go for them, but wow they did. Of course, I added some crumbled bacon to the scallops just before I took them out of the oven. Will definitely use again!

I made this recipe according to the instructions, slightly less butter but everything else I left the same.  It is excellent!  My husband and I were shocked that we hadn't thought of baking scallops like this before.  It is a keeper for sure!

The scallops turned out great! They were cooked to perfection, the recipe was easy to assemble, and flavour was wonderful. I used butter crackers that were were reduced salt and found that is was salty enough as it was. Thanks for the recipe!

Nice change from my other scallop recipe.  I used panko crumbs and mixed it all together, instead of as a topping.

This dish is very tasty! I took the advice of others and dipped them completely in the butter then covered them with the bread crumb mixture.. then broiled at the last 2 minutes to make the topping more crispy. Turned out perfect!

Yummy!  I melted the butter in the oven with the minced garlic for 4 minutes and then turned the scallops in that before putting topping on.  IMO, it was just enough butter.  Next time I will broil for 5 minutes at the end to give a little crunch to them.  Very, very good and so easy!  Thanks, John!

FABULOUS!!!  I had 2 lbs of sea scallops so I doubled the recipe to make sure I could coat them. I crushed onion and garlic croutons for my breadcrumbs and followed the recipe otherwise. I served them with parmesan couscous and braised spinach to make it a restaurant quality meal. The BF, who didn't even like scallops, LOVED this recipe--he even packed leftovers for lunch!

WIW!  I luckily found some sea scallops 1/2 price at the market today, came home and searched for a recipe to fix them---decided on this one and I'm glad that I did!  I prepared almost exactly as the original---substituted dill for the parsley (I like dill) and added 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I had some baby Vidalia onions on hand (similar to green onions), so I sliced them thinly and placed on top of the bread crumb/spice mixture.  I also decided to try the idea of one reviewer by broiling for 2-3 mins at end of preparation.  ABSOLUTELY GREAT.  DEElicious and DEElightful!--!  I'll be watching for scallops on sale from now on so that I can make this dish.  Some ideas for other spices:  ginger or curry---I think either/both of these would add a nice flavor--also think this would be very good with saffron rice.    THANKS for sharing this wonderful recipe---couldn't be easier and very, very good!  A keeper!

Came out great!  Thank you to the person who filled me in about not letting the scallops touch the side of the pan!  I had no rubbery spots!    I mixed the scallops in with the melted butter and then I put them in the bowl with bread crumb mixture and mixed them up before putting them in the baking dish.  Very easy and very delicious!

This was great!! I used bay scallops (the little ones), as directed.  I think I will try other reviewers' suggestions of using panko, as my bread crumbs were more gloppy and less crisp.  However, it was still fabulous.  Next time I might try a splash of white wine in with the butter.

Very good, especially after adding the juice of one fresh lime and a dash of red pepper.  Served with jasmine rice, butternut squash and a medley of steamed veggies.  YUMM!  Thanks for sharing.

I had 9 Talapia filets I put in a large casserole after the butter. I used Old Bay (too), omitted the garlic powder only. I sprinkled the talapia with the bread crumb mixture, then rolled the scallops in the crumbs and just placed them on top. 20 mins to delicious-ness! A definite '5'!

I just melted the butter (in the microwave) directly in the baking dish, then added the minced garlic, threw the scallops in the dish, and tossed them in the garlic butter. Finally, I mixed all the remaining ingredients and baked as directed. I used sea scallops instead of bay and used panko bread crumbs. THEY ARE DELICIOUS!!!!!!! ONE DISH COOKING... YOU GOT TO LOVE IT!

Delicious and I do agree with many of your reviewers, you do not need all the bread crumbs. Cut it in half and put some white wine in with the butter.

Super simple and light supper.  I prefer the bigger scallops as they aren't as "watery".  Ingredients and cook time are perfect!!

I did not care for this. I made it exactly to recipe. The parmesean and bay scallops were just not a good flavor mix. I thought the parmesean brought out the fishy flavor too much. Might try with shrimp, as another reviewer suggested.

Had a nice flavor, but were mushy even with 5 minutes broiled after bake time.  Next time I will try to broil longer - served w/ a salad, but would be good over rice.  *Added red pepper flakes - otherwise followed recipe exactly

Very tastey with very little effort I've tried it as the recipe states & with old bay as a sub it was great both ways.

great recipe and very easy.  I placed the scallops in individual au gratin dishes, added about 1/4 cup white wine to the melted butter, tossed the scallops with some diced chives and replaced the bread crumbs with panko.  YUM, YUM.  The dish literally disappeared!

LOVED IT!!!! We used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs, a shallot and fresh garlic instead of the dried spices and placed the dish under the broiler once cooked to get that extra crisp texture.  Will DEFINITELY be making this again!!!!

I made this tonight for dinner because I had scallops in the freezer.  I thawed them and dried them on lots of paper towels to get out the water.  I followed the recipe very closely.   Still, they were pretty soggy.  The taste was great, Hubby and I both liked them - I will make them again but next time, I think I'll put them in a larger container to give them more room.  Maybe the topping will get crispy that way.

I made this recipe using the exact measurements of ingrediets, except that I melted the butter in the oven in a 10" cast iron skillet.  Then I combined all the dry ingredients in a food processor and sprinkled them over the top of the scallops and baked the whole thing.  It was WONDERFUL!!

I had the small bay scallops so I dipped each one and then coated with dry mixture. I then poured remaining butter and mixture across 13x9 pan. Baked for 20 min and broiled for 5 min. I made garlic & olive oil noodles with these on top. It tasted just like you would find at a good italian resteraunt. I topped it off with a french baguette drizzled with butter & olive oil. Very pleased.

This dish was fantastic!  I made this for dinner last night and my hubby and I devoured the scallops.  I made the recipe exactly was written with the exception of using Italian Panko Bread Crumbs for the seasoned bread crumbs.  This will definitely go in my rotation recipe file.  Try it.....

Because scallops are expensive so I tried making it with broken scallops (about half off the regular price at my market).  It was absolutly delicous and so easy to make!  I've made this at 3 parties so far and each time it was a hit!  Thank you for sharing!

Very yummy.

Mine also turned somewhat soggy.  I used the dredge in butter then shake in a bag method.
 
I think I would cut the butter by about 1/2.  That seemed to be the trouble with my recipe.  This would also make it healthier.

I didn't have onion powder on hand, and they definitely needed it.  Too sweet without.

My family really enjoyed this.  I had no problems with sogginess as other reviewers claimed, I also didn't think it had too much garlic.  The amount of garlic could be personal preference, so perhaps adjust accordingly.  I did think there was too much topping, though, so next time, I will cut back on tht.  For past reviewers and future reviewers, to prevent sogginess, try blotting the scallops very dry before preparing them.  I've always had a problem with scallops turning out too watery, but this time, I drained them and then blotted them dry.  I had no problems with sogginess.

I love Bay scallops and it's hard to find good recipes for them. I love how these turned out. I can't stress enough to make sure the scallops are dry as will turn out in to a lump of goo if they aren't. This happened the first time. I strained mine and used paper towels and squeezed them gently to make sure they were dry.

I made this with no changes and it was FANTASTIC!  I have also used this recipe with shrimp-it tastes like shrimp de jonghe,  For those of you that say it is watery, try patting the scallops dry before putting them is the dish.  For those that say that there are too many bread crumbs, I just sprinkled the extra around the scallops in the butter which tastes great on crusty bread!

I had to modify this a bit, since I had some scallops on hand, but not much else on this ingredient list.  It was very easy to modify, and turned out very well.  Great basic recipe that lets you use the things you have on hand.  I tossed the scallops in 2-3 tbsp of olive oil (instead of using butter) and a dash of white wine vinegar.  Then I topped them with a mixture of crushed tortilla chips (no crackers or bread crumbs on hand), grated parmesan, pepper, parsley, and fresh grated garlic.  I left out the salt, because of the salt on the chips.  We ate it over pasta-- so good!

I used half panko, half seasoned bread crumbs and added some crushed red pepper to the recipe and then topped a combination of shrimp and scallops.  They came out beautifully and tasted wonderful with some whole wheat angel hair pasta.

Very quick and easy recipe.  I'm not a fan of scallops, but my boyfriend loved this recipe!  Followed the advice of previous reviewers and decreased the amount of butter.  Also, didn't have any Parmesan cheese but apparently it was alright without it!  Will make this one again!

These came out PERFECT.  Used fresh caught sea scallops and rolled them in the seasoning rather than sprinkling and they came out amazing.  I served over a bed of sticky long grain rice and fresh squeezed citrus sauce.  I made this for my girlfriend and her parents and if I wasn't in with them before I am now.

What's the word to describe for this, other than delicious? As a native Newfie I grew up hunting for scallops on the beach, and we went there over the summer, and did just that! I needed a recipe for frozen scallops, and this was the one! Doubled the recipe because there were lots of us, and we dipped them in melted garlic butter. Good reviews all around, thanks for sharing!

My husband and I loved the added flavor of the ingredients to the scallops. We love scallops and don't have them very often, but when we do, it's nice to dress them up a bit. This is a great recipe. I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I used crushed Ritz and they tasted great! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was fabulous. I had never cooked scallops before, baked or fried, and this tasted like something from a New England Seafood restaurant, but was extremely easy. 

I used both sea scallops and shrimp, and took the advice of another user to sautee the garlic and onion (rather than onion powder) and mix with the melted butter. I also added a few Ritz crackers to the bread crumb mixture. Delicious!

Delicious! I added extra garlic (I add extra garlic to EVERYTHING!!). I loved the bay scallops compared to the sea scallops as we sometimes find those to be gritty. I used frozen scallops & defrosted them under cold water since the fish counter didn't have any fresh ones available. I served this on a bed of garlic rice with a side dish of edamame. PERFECT meal!!

We loved this recipe. I used fresh chopped fresh parsley since we didn't have the dry flakes on hand and it worked our perfectly.  Great dish for a dinner party.

I served this with crab cakes and rice - it was very good. My husband is not a huge bread crumb fan so I will probably try another recipe next time, but I liked it. I sauteed the butter and garlic and then tossed with the scallops. Thanks!

Pretty good, but a little too much butter in my opinion. These scallops would be great served over buttered fettucini or noodles.

Thought I like to mention, that I did make a change in the recipe. I used Panco instead of bread crumbs. It was not soft, but crispy. Thanks again John

The flavor from the breadcrumb mixture was superb BUT I think that I may have used a little too much butter, because mine were a little too buttery.  Next time I will reduce the amount of butter that I use and will make sure that my scallops are spread evenly in my casserole dish.  Very good though.

I was sadly disappointed in this recipe.  I read all the reviews and took the advice of many on it, but coating the scallops and sprinkling the rest of the crumbs on top made them way too dry, broiling made it worse, and I shouldn't have cut down on the butter at all.  Way too much breading; I might as well have driven to Long John Silvers.  I can't even think of how to redeem this one except I used bay scallops; maybe sea scallops would be better.

This was Fantastic!  Best dish I've made yet! However, I did modify this recipe, just a bit. I used bay scallops and shrimp for this dish.  I also added chopped green onions and white onions.  In addition, I didn't use any minced garlic and onion powder. I just used around 2-2 1/2 teaspoons of garlic.  Lastly, I used about 2 1/2 to 3 tbsp of margerine.  I also mixed the breaded mixture with the shrimp and bay scallops as opposed to just using as a topping.  It totally helped to enhance flavour.  It tasted wonderful with the juices from the seafood mix with the breaded mixture and margerine.  I also broiled this dish for the last 2 minutes.  Thanks for this great recipe John!  I'll be using the recipe from now on for my scallops!

These turned out very salty-use unsalted butter!  The crumb mixture really overwhelmed the scallops. Too garlicky for us! I don't think I'll make these again.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  We will definitely make it again.  We didn't use the garlic cloves, only the garlic powder, which was enough for us.  I also used Italian bread crumbs which added good flavor.

Hmmm...  I don't think the bread crumbs are the problem.  The other flavors overwhelm the scallops.  This recipe would work just as well with chicken.  Would I make this again?  Probably not.

We didn't like this at all.  It tasted fishy and the scallops were soggy.  We love scallops and garlic too.  Maybe they needed more garlic and breadcrumbs.  I will be searching for another recipe.  Won't make again.

This was so easy and delicious!  I will definitely prepare it often! I served it with a rice pilaf and salad.  I thawed out some frozen sea scallops (the bigger ones) and it turned out fine. In my opinion, if you cut down just a bit on the bread crumbs and cheese, it won't harm the finished product.

I thought there was way to much bread crumb mixture.  The flavor was very good after I raked off some of the crumbs.  I will make again with half as much of the bread crumb mixture.

This was great!  I unfortunatley grabbed the onion salt instead of onion powder and it was a little too salty, but sooooo good!  My boyfriend requested that I let him take the leftovers for work the next day. I added shrimp and fresh parsley and basil, it was wonderful and SO easy!!!

The baked scallops were absolutely delicious! The ease with which this recipe is made is phenomenal! (My 4 and 5 year old have a very limited menu so I didn't bother offering this to them.)

Really a pretty good combination of simple ingredients.  I would have rated it higher except that I just like the less-sweet taste of sea scallops better.

I loved this.  Husband thought there was too much topping.  Kids were afraid of 
the scallops so their opinion doesn't count.  We would make this again but cut 
down on the bread crumb mixture somewhat.

AMAZING! Was a big hit with dinner guest! Only modifications were that 1) I used minced garlic (jarred, in water) and doubled the amount. In order to still be able to sprinkle dry mixture I simply added garlic to scallops first and coated them well. And 2) I added a final sprinkling of parmesan cheese over the breadcrumb later. I love cheese. :) 

I also noted that cook time for me at 400F was about 18 minutes, but they were pretty done at that point. I like them more on the well done side anyway, but they probably could've come out a minute or two earlier then that and been fine (cooked regular tenderness).

Great recipe and so easy!

This is a good recipe and it added to my methods of making scallops. Since I made it in a NuWave oven that generally requires less cooking time, at 400 degrees it took only 10 minutes to cook the scallops which still caused them to be a bit over cooked. I added twice the garlic and I think it could have used a little more. We like garlic. After I got it all together, it looked a bit dry. So I added another 2 tbsp. of butter. I will make this again, but next time, I think I will add more garlic and a little more butter. Either that or less bread crumbs because I use 1 lb. of scallops instead of 1 1/2 lbs.  I served this over a rice mix I make that includes. basmati brown rice, wild rice, and red quinoa.

I made this again, and this time, I melted the 4 tbsp. of butter in the microwave with 4 minced cloves of garlic. Then mixed the dry ingredients in a second bowl. I dredged the scallops in the garlic butter, and then coated each in the bread crumb mixture, and arranged them in a baking pan lined with aluminum foil. Mixed enough of the bread crumb mixture with the remaining garlic butter to make a crumbly topping, and sprinkled this on top of all the scallops. This time, I baked the scallops in the NuWave oven for 7 minutes at 375 degrees, and they were perfect.  At 400 degrees for the 8 minutes they were a bit chewy which means they were over cooked. I have also used this same recipe for halibut cheeks which have a similar texture to scallops. This is equally as good.

I used panko bread crumbs and baked for 15 minutes.  My scallops may have been a little small.   I served it over thin spaghetti with a small salad.  I felt better about all that butter because it served as the pasta sauce, also.  I will be making this again, for sure!

I really liked this but received mixed reviews in the house.  The scallops really did need to cook longer and I added some fresh Italian herbs.  It was served on spaghetti squash tossed in basil pesto.

This had good flavor, but it was soggy. I made it exactly as written, except I used panko breadcrumbs, because that's what I had. If I repeat it, this is what I'll do: pan sear the scallops in butter/olive oil and fresh garlic. Toast the breadcrumb mixture in the oven and top the finished scallops with it.

This recipe was fantastic. It deserves all of the wonderful ratings. Plus, it is so easy. If you can combine ingredients in a bowl and dump in a dish to bake you cant mess it up. YUM. I cook every night and have been cooking for years. this is the most simple scallop dishes I have ever made and by far one of the most delicious. Whole family is raving :)

Delicious!!!! I used Florida scallops and they were fabulous. Because in my mind, when I think of scallops I also think of pasta so I paired the two but there wasn't enough sauce. Next time I will definitely class up this dish with a fancy vegetable such as asparagus or brussel sprouts and garlic mashed potatoes.

Very, very good!  Cooking time is perfect.  I added garlic to the melted butter and cooked for a minute or two to infuse the flavor.  Used the larger frozen scallops.  Thawed them in cold water and dried thoroughly.  Then I rolled the scallops in the breading instead of putting the breading on top.  Absolutely excellent.  Perfect texture.  Can't wait to make these again.  Served with garlic and butter Pasta Roni.

A bit salty; maybe less cheese would help?  I used seasoned panko crumbs,  and omitted all seasonings but paprika.  Hint:  make sure you "clean" the scallops by pulling off their muscles prior to cooking.  (Each little bugger will have a little, darker white "tab" on its side; that's its muscle, and, if left on, will make the scallop tough & chewy).

Prepared as directed, only I used finely chopped shallots that I sauteed first. (Usually, my husband will remove anything that resembles an onion on his plate, but this made it impossible). I also used Panko in place of dry bread crumbs. The scallops were savory and delicious. Love the addition of fresh grated Parmesan cheese!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Good but too much butter and too much bread crumb mixture.

Went step by step by the directions and it turned out perfect! Great taste and flavor. Served it with some Pop Corn Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta

Even though I sort of screwed this up, it still turned out delicious! 
This was my first attempt at baking an entree (Usually I stick to cakes and cookies) and made sure to read a number of the reviews for tips as I was a bit leery of some of the directions. The suggestion to put the scallops in a bag of the breadcrumb mixture in order to get a nice coating rather than just on top was a good one. 
My hiccup was the dish I used to bake them in. It wasn't big enough for all of the scallops to be on the bottom of the dish, so there were some on top of others. This resulted in some of the scallops having a crispy breading and others to be rather soggy. But the taste definitely made up for it. I was quite surprised at how not terribly garlic-y this actually was and I tend to be less tolerant of that spice than most. 
Served them over spaghetti with a garlic-butter sauce and sprinkled an Italian cheese blend over all of it. Will definitely make this again.

The only thing I would change about this would be to reduce the amount of bread crumbs.  Tasted great, but just a little overboard in that area.

Loaded with flavor, but the scallops were just a little dry for our tastes.  Next time, I will add more butter (I know it adds more fat and calories) and probably take out of the oven at 15 minutes.  Delicious and easy seafood entree particularly for a weeknight. •••••UPDATE 2.14.18:    Since my original review, I’ve made a few changes to this recipe.  I double the butter, use dried minced onion instead of onion powder (simply because I don’t keep it on hand), use Italian panko crumbs for the topping, and bake for only 15 minutes.  Love this recipe because you can mix up the topping earlier in the day, so this meal is a breeze to make.  Always serve it over a bit of pasta.  A good partner for this recipe is either Spinach and Strawberry Salad or Jamie’s Cranberry Spinach Salad, both on this site.  Awesome recipe easy enough for a weeknight meal, but stylish enough to serve to dinner  guests.

I made this a few nights ago. I didn't use the amount of scallops the recipe calls for, went with about 1/2,  and made the mistake of not scaling back on the bread crumbs. That being said, this was just ok for me. I don't think having too much bread crumb was the issue as I was able to spoon around them. I like to prepare a recipe in the way it was written first (exception here was less scallops, only 2 ppl) before I change things. This has potential for me. I would probably add more garlic, maybe a smidge of wine... but then it starts to become something other than what original owner made. Probably won't make again, but this is a nice base for some other flavors.

This is an excellent recipe that I made months ago (yes, I should have reviewed it months ago, I know).  After trying another scallop recipe tonight, I will stick with this one!  The other recipe was tasteless while this one had the right blend of spices and texture that even my somewhat picky kid liked.  Thanks for a keeper of a recipe!

This recipe is great, however like other reviewer's, I dipped the scallops in the melted butter and rolled them in the bread crumb mixture instead of sprinkling on top, then for the last minute or so broiled them. Turned out so good! YUM

Was looking for a quick, delicious recipe and so glad I tried this one.  Even my son, who is not crazy about scallops, enjoyed it.  I didn't have onion powder, so I used 2 teaspoons of Emeril's Essence instead for the paprika, garlic & onion powder.  Also, instead of 1/4, I used 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese.  After baking it for 20 minutes, I broiled it for about a minute, as suggested by another reviewer.  Delicious, quick and easy.  Looking forward to making it again!

this was delicious! i am sure its awesome as is, however i try to clean my recipes these days to suit my life style. 
a few slight modifications to make it a touch healthier. i used a 1/4 cup whole wheat seasoned bread crumbs (these have a lot of salt from the seasoning) and only 2 tablespoons of olive oil and to be honest i didn't need that much of either the oil or crumbs.
i only needed enough oil to coat the scallops and i might have been able to do that with a tbsp. and for the coating mixture i didn't even use it all as i only wanted a lil breading on the top layer of the bake and the recipe yielded quite a bit even tho i reduced the bread crumbs by half. so next time to make it cleaner i might just only use a tbsp oil and 1-2 tbsp bread crumbs or simply eliminate them if i serve them with a starch such as brown rice or Whole wheat pasta. thanks for the great recipe!

so simple and flavorful!  added 1 tbsp of lemon juice to the scallop/butter mixture.  made a 1lb bag and the crumb topping was aplenty.  also, didn't have fresh garlic so added a little extra garlic powder.

Excellent recipe!  I used half of the bread crumb mix, half as much butter and subbed basil for parsley. Bay scallops came out perfectly baked for the 20 min at 400.

Used frozen Sam's scallops (thawed). Left out the garlic powder but used fresh, minced garlic in the melted butter. Dried the scallops, then rolled them around in the garlic butter and then crumb mixture. Sprinkled the extra crumb mixture over the top. 20 minutes was right on in my oven.  I will broil towards the end next time and will also try Panko breading.

We really enjoyed this dish. I found it easy to prepare, I prefer the crumb topping to be more brown than it was, so I simply put it under the broiler for several minutes, being careful no to burn

This had good flavor.  Like others, some parts were a little soggy.  I'll make it again but in a bigger dish so everything can be spread out more and get crispier.

Delicious and easy!  I followed the recipe except for some minor changes.  I used fresh parsley and panko bread crumbs.  I infused the chopped garlic in the melted butter.  I poured a little bit of the garlic butter directly on the scallops and then mixed the remainder in with the bread crumb mixture.  Bay scallops are small so I decreased the cooking time to 15 minutes and they were perfect.  I served with wedges of lemon.  I will definitely make again!

Very good, very quick and easy prep.  Only change was to add some crushed red pepper flakes.  A squeeze of fresh lemon to plate would finish perfectly.  
Came out crunchy and flavors were great.

So awesome, cooked away from sides of dish per another reviewer, and broiled the top about 3 minutes after the 20 minute bake time, also per another reviewer.  My husband and I loved this dish.  Best way I've made scallops so far.

My husband and I live in New England and so we are very familiar with great seafood. This recipe is amazing. I used minced garlic 2 tbls instead of cloves and it was still wonderful. I doubled the recipe and used 1  1/2 lbs of scallops and 1 1/2 lbs of prawns. It is great to have both.

EXCELLENT !! Did little more work by coating each scallop with the panko mixture using lightly betted egg, I did sprinkle the rest of the mixture on the top. WORTH THE EXTRA TIME, maybe even as an appetizer with smaller scallops.

I made the newbie mistake not reading the reviews - made it exactly as described and had too much liquid on the bottom of the dish. Should have dried/rolled scallops in crumbs before adding.
I substituted crushed seasoned stuffing mix for crumbs. Taste was great!

I made these last night with 6 large sea scallops and some large shrimps.  I used one of the reviews tip by just dipping the scallops & shrimp into the butter and then rolled them in the panko crumb mixture (didn't use bread crumbs).  This was so tasty and the panko didn't get all gooey but stayed crunchy on top.  Very good spice amounts but it needed a little bit more salt.  Will be making this often.

This is amazing!  I did like some reviewers suggested and melted the garlic with the butter in the oven for 3-5 minutes.  Then I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband ask me to make it again the next day!

Very very tasty!  Easy too!  I used Panko bread crumbs.  I made it for a Valentines dinner and it was a huge hit!  I have never cooked bay scallops, I have always used Sea.  But the bays were sweet and tender.  A delicious quick meal!

These were very good, but I agree with others that they would make a better appetizer than meal. Also, mine only took about 15 minutes... maybe mine were smaller than normal? I don't have a ton of experience making scallops, so I'm not sure. But I was sure to use "Bay" Scallops.

YUM!!  I made these gluten free by using corn flake crumbs in place of the bread crumbs.  Followed other reviews and cooked the garlic in the pan in the butter in the over for a fre minutes before adding the scallops.  I also tossed the scallops with everything rather than just sprinkling.  Everyone LOVED them - my cousin who was over must have said "these are great" at least 3 times during dinner.

This are amazing and delicious. I didn't use the paprika, but enjoy adding a little extra butter. I'm pouring it over pasta so it makes the perfect sauce. They were very tender and full flavor. Have made this more than once already!

Delicious baked scallops. My first attempt cooking scallops and it was great! The only thing I changed was I added red pepper to give it a kick as we love spicy food and I used Gluten free bread crumbs. Great recipe and the scallops were not at all dry. I even used the left overs on a spinach salad the next day! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe. I can't cook but still this dish turned out really well. Compliments all around.  Followed some of the advices here (put garlic with the butter, then rolled the scallops onto the bread crumbs) and worked out really well. :)

This is so easy and so delicious.  I prefer the larger sea scallops, so I used those instead.  My paprika also has a nice kick to it, so that was great in this dish.

These are so tasty. I use panko in place of the dry bread crumbs, and I think it adds just that little bit of extra crunch to the topping. I have not  added the garlic to the butter before, but that sounds like the bomb to make this even tastier!

yo this recipe was crazy good. only thing i'd do differently is cut the butter down in half and dry the scallops cuz it was very liquidy in the bottom.

This was honestly the best scallop dish I have cooked at home! I did add bacon (because scallops and bacon are a happy marriage). Used combo of panko and regular breadcrumbs and shredded romano instead of parm because that is what I had on hand. For the bacon - I diced up 2 slices and cooked and crumbled it and added with the scallops (covering all w/ the butter).  SOOO GOOD!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and no one liked it. It had a funky taste and the breading came out soggy even though the scallops were perfectly cooked. Will not make this again.

Loved this. I dipped in butter and breaded individually as others suggested. Put remaining butter in cooking dish and remaing panko crumbs on top then baked as directed. Slight crunch and then so tender and delicious. I used Canadian scallops. Will make again for sure! Best with panko crumbs and parmesano reggiano cheese.

Delicious and rich dish. I thought I had too much of the breadcrumb mixture as I was pouring it over the scallops, but it turned out fine. I drizzled a little olive oil over the top before putting it in the oven to make sure it all got cooked and also broiled it for the last seven minutes.

I have found my new favorite recipe. I always fried scallops, but never could duplicate the restaurant taste.  This recipe is so good.  I will no longer fry any seafood.  I will use this recipe on fish and shrimp as well.

I thought this recipe was good, but it wasn't one of my favorites.  I was afraid I would overcook the scallops, but that wasn't the case.  I followed it exactly, but I didn't use all the breadcrumbs, it definitely was way too much.  They did get soggy, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I may try it with panko breadcrumbs if I make this again.  My husband, who loves scallops, thought this was just ok, too.

Delicious. I know that many people wanted a crunchy top, but I like it the way it turned out....soft and buttery. Crunchy outside is almost too much for the bay scallops because they are so delicate...    I melted the butter with the garlic (minced, about 2 cloves) first, dredged the scallops in it, and rolled it in the following: Italian breadcrumbs with parsley, paprika and a hint of garlic powder (I didn't add onion powder.).....I made these with a side dish of Orzo, sauteed with spinach and a little of the minced garlic left over from the scallops.    Amazing...will make for my mother-in-law!!!

GREAT RECIPE  Rivals the best restaurants. I omitted the fresh garlic--not a big fan. I added two table spoons of PURE MAPLE SYRUP to the butter and stirred it in to replicate a dish that I  had enjoyed at a local restaurant '"Maple Baked Scallops" .This adds a light sweet touch to the dish and the maple flavor is subtle but compliments the scallops nicely. I did find , however , that 20 min. cooking time is inadequate and that a minimum of 25 min. is more like it for proper firmness. A great dish to impress company with and quite simple to fix.

I am not a seafood person but my husband loved this.  I loved how quick and easy it was.  I followed the advice of many others who rolled the scallops in butter/garlic, then the bread crumb mix.  Definitely a keeper.

Great tasting and easy recipe, but can easily become too salty.  I recommend using unsalted butter, especially if you are using Old Bay seasoning which contains salt.  Panko bread crumbs are good.  For the smaller bay scallops, 20 minutes may be too long.  Fresh chopped parsley and a drizzle of fresh lemon juice after it comes out of the oven really brightens up the flavor.

I made these tonight for dinner for my family and they were good - but not incredible.  I used sea scallops (larger variety than bay scallops, and I also minced the garlic into the bottom of the casserole dish and then dredged the scallops in the butter/garlic mixture.  The only other change I made was to use panko instead of breadcrumbs.  The end result was a nice, garlicky dish...but it didn't have a lot of "wow" to it.

Very tasty. I believe next time I will use 1/2 the amount of scallops and only 1/2 of the breadcrumb mixture. I will lightly sprinkle breadcrumb mixture as, my dish was rather mushy.

This was stellar!  My husband and I gobbled them down with a salad and the Lime Cilantro Rice. I used half butter/half olive oil instead of all butter, but didn't change anything else.  I can't wait to make it again.

Sorry but my family was not a big fan of this dish.  I used bay scallops per the recipe but we thought it would have been better using a bigger-type scallop.  Thanks for letting us try.

This recipe was very good. I only used minced garlic and instead of using seasoned bread crumbs I mixed panko break crumbs with a little butter.  After baking I put them under the broiler a few minutes until browned.  Awesome.  I use this same recipe for fresh haddock.

Excellent recipe.  Super Easy. Made it as written, and the scallops came out great. I served this over brown rice and there wasn't a single leftover.

Absolutely wonderful! I left out the onion powder since I didn't have any, and topped off shredded parmesan at the end. Also didn't have dried parsely so I substituted dried oregano. I also took another reviewer's advice and dipped each scallop with butter, then into the bread cumbs mixture, and then placed them into the casserole dish. Leftover butter and bread crumbs were added on top. I served this over a light risotto with peas mixture and it turned out wonderful.   Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe, this was my first time making scallops so I wasn't very confident on how it would turn out.  Followed the recipe but since my scallops were really large I split them into two pieces and continued following the recipe except that I dipped them in butter and rolled onto mixture instead of pouring butter and mixture above the scallops.  I wanted the whole scallop covered in the batter, it came out delicious and will make again soon

Scrumptious! I added a touch more garlic, cooked some bacon till it was crispy and chopped it into half of the mix and sprinkled on top. I also had to cook 10 extra minutes for the bay scallops to fully cook. Overall, an easy delicious recipe.

I was craving baked scallops... Unfortunately, however, this recipe did not live up to the hype.  I even followed others recommendations and ensure the scallops were well dried - and still the dish came out as a soggy disappointment!  I even had to put the dish under the broiler for a couple minutes to toast the breadcrumb mixture properly.  Even then while the top was crisp - everything down below was mush.

This recipe was sooooo good as written. Add a few spices of your choice or cut down on the butter if you wish, but it works great.  The scallops were very tender w/o being mushy.  Will make this one again! Thanks

This is an excellent, make again recipe! I had NO problems with sogginess. I used 1/2 panko crumbs, 1/2 italian bread crumbs, frozen bay scallops (patted dry). I left out the onion seasoning and parsley (b/c of the italian bread crumbs already have that in it) and I used only the 1 tsp garlic powder as I had no fresh garlic on hand. But it was plenty garlicy enough. I served it on spinach linguini which was delicious. I would like to know what others served it with?!?! Would make a great last miniute guest main or appy!

Thanks John!

In all of my life my Mother has never
asked me for a recipe until now. I took the advice to double the bread crumbs and it came out great. Thank you!

This was really great. The only change I made was to add minced garlic and shallots to the melted butter. My husband's from Boston and wouldn't dare eat bay scallops! My sea scallops were quite large, so it took 30 mins. to bake. Served with fresh lemon, which I highly recommend. Thanks so much for sharing!!

Very good - great taste - I followed the recipe as is - no minced garlic though... used powdered. Will make again. I think very fresh seafood will make this outstanding. I used frozen and it was still very tasty.

This recipe came out amazing!  I made it for my grandparents (who are VERY hard to please) and they are still raving over it!  My sister who hates seafood even took seconds!  I followed the recipe, only using a little olive oil in place of butter, and turned it to broil for the last 2 minutes to make the top crispy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were really soggy. I even cut the amount of butter and it still was soggy. I would suggest tossing the scallops with a tiny bit of olive oil before putting them in the pan instaed of using butter. Or maybe using this recipe to do a shake and bake type thing.

I just thought these were OK but my husband loved them so I'll rate this recipe a 4.  Mine came out with soggy breadcrumbs on top.  Only change I made was to use less butter than called for and they were still very buttery.  They tasted OK.  Not sure what to do differently to avoid sogginess so probably won't make this one again.

These were awesome. I made them expecting my youngest brother not to like them at all, but he had 2 helpings. I did have an issue with mushy breading, but I think I'll be able to remedy that next time by simply putting the scallops in a larger baking dish. I served this with wild rice and spinach, and I'm planning to serve this to my husband when he returns from Iraq. He doesn't like seafood "because it's slimy", but I bet he'll love these scallops!

The best!!! Easy, quick, and most importantly, my husband couldn't keep from shoveling it in!! I added 5 minutes of broiling time at the end to crisp it. Also used Progresso bread crumbs. Can't wait to make this for company and impress my friends!!!

I really liked these; they were perfectly cooked,the topping has a nice delicate flavor. I used less butter. The picky husband scraped the topping off-I don't think he even tasted it. Oh well, his loss. Will make again for other family members! Thanks a bunch!!

this is a great recipe! the first time i followed the "most helpful" reviewers ideas and it was good...second time did the same but just added pretty much more of everything...especially some seasonings and it was AWESOME!! i like rich recipes with scallops since they aren't overly flavorful on their own. served it with brown rice and it was so great. thanks for the recipe!

Didnt like this at all.  It was the first time I have tried scallops.  I used the Bay scallops.  They came out gooey even though I baked them as directed.  Not a recipe I would try again.

The only complaint I give this recipe is that it is really greasy... I may cut down on the butter next time. Other than that - it was delish! Love the idea to add shrimp! Will make again!

This was really good. I made it even easier by not combining the ingredients first and just sprinkling each ingredient over the scallops. Just as good leftover.

good recipe but I found it a bit dry so when I reheated leftovers the next day I made a sauce with half & half, a little butter and mixed it with the bread crumbs which thickened it and that I really liked.  When I make it again I will make it with the sauce.
I used large sea scallops and the baking time was perfect.

Absolutely the best scallop recipe ever and soooooo easy.  I took others advice and used a 9 X 13 baking dish and made sure the scallops didn't touch each other.  It came out absolutely perfect.  Can't wait to try this on our friend who is a scallops fan.

I'd rate a four the bf said a 5. I used the little scallops and it was nice (prefer to use the larger ones for meals where you taste more scallop).  Served with pasta. Watch cooking time closely.

This was good served with some rice.  It was kind of salty-maybe use unsalted butter as someone else suggested.  Very filling and had a good flavor.  I did NOT think there was too much breading.

This was pretty good. I dried the scallops on paper towl after washing and it was still watery on the bottom. The crunchy top was yummy. I'll try it again.

These are amazing.  Just like something you'd have at a restaurant.  I made this with asparagus (sauted w/lemon pepper and red-wine vinegar).

Made these last night for dinner, and my husband and I were really satisfied with how they turned out.  I used finely chopped onion in place of onion powder, but otherwise, stuck to the recipe, and it was fantastic!  Thanks for sharing!

Quite good - will make with shrimp next time. I didn't measure spices or breadcrumbs but just sprinkled them over in amounts that looked right. Did *not* find this too garlicy when I went cautiosly. Served with broccoli-cheddar rice and steamed vegetables.

I was a little doubtful about the bread crumb topping because I'm not a big fan of breaded scallops but these turned out great! I coated the scallops in the crumb mixture first and then sprinkled what was left over top. Love the flavor from the bread crumb mixture. Our favorite way of preparing scallops will always be wrapping them in foil with butter, minced garlic, and fresh minced parsley and then baking them, but this is great for a change every now and then. Thanks John.

This is definitely a "company" recipe.......Although it sounds like alot of spices, it is just right when baked.  I rolled the scallops in the melted butter and then rolled them in the breadcrumb mixture.  Used plain homemade dry italian bread bread crumbs.  Also added some thyme to the bread crumb mix.  Added some snipped chives to the butter and minced garlic mixture.  DELICIOUS.  Bake sea scallop 5-10 min. longer than the bay scallops.  Would be good if under the broiler for the last 2-3 min.

This was extremely fast and wonderfully delicious.
I was amazed at how great it turned out.  i used bay scallops this time, but i think id use sea scallops next time.  The small scallops got a little lost in the breadcrumb topping.  Even so, this was outstanding!!!!

Bay scallops were used and came out tasty and not chewy or rubbery at all, which had been my previous experience with scallops.

I really wanted to make baked scallops but when I began this recipe I realized I only had paprika to add to the breadcrumbs. Even without all the spices the scallops were delicious baked in butter and covered in breadcrumbs. A great quick dinner!

I don't know what I did wrong. The breading was so dry. I followed the directions perfectly. No one liked this recipe including me and I like scallops. Once the breading was scraped off the scallops were delicious and moist.

I'm not a lover of scallops, but even I couldn't get over how wonderful this dish was.  I also cut down on the bread crumbs after reading the other reviews.  My husband was a very happy camper and insisted that I make this dish again for him next week.

I did not heed the warnings of others who rated this recipe, and I was sorry!!  It has potential, but it really does have entirely too much garlic.  So unless you can pop a garlic clove in your mouth and eat it like a cashew, I strongly recommend cutting back on the garlic.  I will try this recipe again with a fraction of the garlic.

If you would decrease the bread crumb mixture by half or so and serve with some lemon juice, then they would be pretty good. I don't think the Parmesan Cheese serves much of a purpose, however, as I could barely taste its presence. All in all, an okay recipe, but in my opinion, not worthy of raves. Can't say it will be made again. Or maybe I just don't like scallops? I thought they were kind of sweet. Thanks anyways.

Very easy recipe to prepare, however, I would cut down the crumb topping by at least 1/2 as it was too much topping for us.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!!! I serverd this at a party and was asked over a dozen times for the recipe. Also, can you believe this was my first time cooking scallops ever??!! I made 4lbs of the scallops and they were all gone. There was one change I made. The scallops I bought were frozen and were already breaded(w/out any seasonings though). So, I added everything but the bread crumbs. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I used sea scallops and this came out absolutely
the best I have tasted in any of the finest restaurants I have been to. My wife and son, both excellent cooks and critics raved about this. It was great. I do not like fishey taste and this was fantastic and easy to prepare and cook!!

I doubled the sauce, and added a bed of angel hair pasta to the bottom of the  casserole did before I began layering the ingredients. Also, I took the advice of many and went very light on the Old Bay Seasoning, and used fresh spinach. Thank you for sharing a delightful recipe. I was looking for something similar a delicious meal I had in NC. This one hit the spot! Yum!

I halved the recipe since we only had 10 scallops and they turned out perfectly. I sprayed the ramekin with cooking spray, added the butter and put into the microwave to melt. Added the scallops and rolled them in the melted butter. We love garlic so I used a lil extra and more crushed parsley for looks. Even tho I generously covered the scallops with the topping, I had quite a bit leftover. I  added this during the last 5 min of baking and thought of dabbing more butter onto the topping. So glad I didn't as it may have made the topping soggy. These  were the best scallops we've ever had!

Turned out a bit soggy, even after a bit of broiling to crisp the top.  The scallops on the bottom just end up too soggy   will try again, cooking on a sheet pan

Didn't change a thing.  So much easier than sautéing them.  Next time I'll try rolling them in mixture rather than sprinkling mix on top.

Excellent! I added a little more garlic and baked as recommended. 20 minutes was perfect for my large Alaskan scallops. If using smaller ones I’d try 12 to 15 minutes. Do not overtake.

Great recipe.  Loved the seasoning!  I added half a slice of organically grown, Heritage Breed pork bacon around each scallop, which added to the deliciousness.  Eating it as leftovers warmed up was even better than the initial meal!

So good & so easy! You want to keep an eye on them in the last 5 minutes of cooking time. Scallops are good slightly undercooked but are bad overcooked. A squirt of lemon as you serve them makes them perfect.

Overall very good!  However, needs WAY more sauce.  I used only 1 pound of scallops and was craving some more of that buttery goodness.  I'd recommend doubling  the amount of butter/seasonings.  We ate over linguini noodles with salt/pepper and it was delicious.  (If not over salted noodles, would also recommend about 1 tsp salt)

I made this once and it was tasty but felt it was missing something.  I made it again however I topped it with Swiss cheese and sprinkled paprika and it was fantastic!!  I would make again but only with the cheese.

Didn't have any Parmesan cheese, so subbed with mozzerella.  Worked our fine.

I made half of the recipe, used a smaller dish and cut the time back by a few minutes.  While I enjoyed the flavour I found that the scallops closest to the edge were somewhat crispy but those in the centre were not.  I don't think that cooking this longer would have changed the outcome as the breading at the edges was very brown.

Made per the recipe...used frozen sea scallops...I only had plain bread crumbs, but I added Old Bay, Mrs. Dash and an Italian seasoning blend to them for assured extra flavor.  This dish was SO simple, and it came out perfect (the scallops were not overcooked)!

I left out the butter altogether and simply sprayed the bottom of the glass pan with olive oil spray.  Then also sprayed the top .  Top cane out crunchy and no problems with sogginess.  I thought it was five star without the butter and made for less calories and fat .

I will definitely make this again! I substituted the bread crumbs for oatmeal and the parsley with basil just because I didn't have either of those items. Turned out nice and crispy!

Really tasty!  But I find that the recipe makes too much of the bread crumb topping.  Next time, I'll reduce the amounts for that.

I did a Keto modification by skipping the bread crumbs. Also, I used olive oil spray to coat the baking sheet. Then I thoroughly dried each scallop with a paper towel before placing onto the sprayed sheet. In a separate bowl I melted 5 tablespoons of butter and added all the rest of the ingredients to it except for Parmesan cheese. The butter became a little thickened and I was able to somewhat spread it all over the scallops. Cooked exactly as it is suggested in the recipe. Result - yummy juicy goodness! Great recipe!

Made this dish over and over, always a hit. I do dry the scallops between paper towels and then air dry while I do the rest. I let melted butter cool some and then roll scallops through before pouring left over on top in pan. sprinkle breadcrumb mixture on top before baking. Never changed anything else about this recipe. Yummy.

Made this for dinner and everybody loved it. Nice blend of flavors and very easy to put together. I followed the recipe as written. Will probably go lighter on the bread crumb mixture next time. This is a winner, served with rice pilaf and steamed veges-yum!

Today I am making this for the second time.  It is actually one of the few recipes I have made more than once with absolutely no changes to the posted recipe.  Excellent way to cook scallops as they did not turn spongy or dry.  My husband cannot wait for dinner.

Used smoked paprika instead of plain. Substituted 15 ritz crackers for bread crumbs. Great recipe, it is also great for flounder!

I made this tonight for an appie night with friends and everyone who tried it loved it,even one person who’s not crazy about scallops. I followed another’s suggestions and put the garlic in with the melted butter. The local market had a fresh herb pack marked seafood herbs that contained thyme, dill, cilantro so I used that. The herbs added great colour and flavour. I don’t usually use pre grated cheeses as they have cellulose but this time chose a preheated mix of Asiago, Romano and ? Parmesan. I think this added a bit more depth to the dish. I’d definitely make this again.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I made it exactly as written, with no substitutions or modifications. It came out perfect! I used fresh scallops from the grocery - not sure if they were sea or bay. I will definitely make this again.

I used the sea scallops because those are the ones favored by my family, and added raw shrimp to the mix (as suggested by another writer) and used the rest of the recipe as written.  My entire family loved it (I used it as a special birthday dinner for one of my sons) and raved about the results!  I will certainly make this dish on a more frequent basis - it's easy to prepare and it's absolutely delicious.

Excellent baked scallops. Made them for Mother’s Day and everyone loved them. Pairs well with pan seared Brussels sprouts and a side of fettuccine and light wine sauce.

I added the following:

- salt
- lemon or black pepper

Also, I added a chopped onion to the scallops  prior to adding the bread crumb mixture.

This recipe came out great!  I did make a few changes though.  I used sea scallops because we are lucky to get awesome ones here in southeastern Connecticut - right off the boats!  I sprayed the casserole dish with cooking spray.  Mixed the melted butter, minced garlic and scallops together to evenly coat.  The combined bread crumbs, parsley, paprika and cheese and sprinkled over the scallops.  I lightly sprayed the crumb mixture with butter flavored cooking spray.  My husband and I loved it and I will definitely make it again!

Made this tonight with sea scallops. Also with gluten free seasoned breadcrumbs. You would never guess it was gluten free. Instead of one large casserole I did individual servings. Came out excellent.

I have no idea what I did wrong. Followed recipe with the exception of using sea scallops instead of bay since that is what we had. I thought it was a little bland. Next time I think I should use Old Bay too. No expert cook here, but I love scallops. They were very tender though.

MDH loved this bay scallop recipe - he said give it 5 1/2 stars! I did change it up just a little- I only had 1# of bay scallops, used Panko, minced garlic added to the melted butter, 2 T white wine added to butter/garlic and 1/2 t Phillips Seafood Seasoning added to the bread crumbs along with the other seasonings. My paprika was smoked and thought I'd taste it but did not. I served this over a wild rice boxed mix from Aldi. Yum! I'll make this again - Thanks John for a great recipe.

Only change was I made my own bread crumbs. Turned out fine. Used inexpensive bay scallops from Aldi. 
Fast meal. Inexpensive. Tasty. Served with spaghetti. Timing was perfect.

This was the first time I made scallops and they were delicious!  Raves from my guests!  After reading other reviews, I substituted panko crumbs for bread crumbs and added 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning.  I also followed the tips for melting the butter w/garlic in the bottom of an 8x8 pan in the oven; throughly drying the scallops with paper towels and then dipping them in the melted butter/garlic.  Put all the dry ingredients in a ziplock bag, shake the dipped scallops in the bag and then put the scallops back in the buttery baking pan. Bake 15 mins @ 400 then broil 2-5 minutes.

Loved this recipe...I'm reviewing because I didn't see any reviews that said that they used large sea scallops, as opposed to the small bay scallops, which is what I did.  The recipe still worked beautifully but I have to say that 20 minutes baking, with my larger scallops, was maybe just a few minutes too long.  So, beware of the baking time especially if you use the small bay scallops.  Other than that, the recipe was delicious and easy!

This was a dreadful recipe. I am confused about why this was rated so highly.  I have cooked scallops many times and this was very disappointing. Scallops were dry and the breadcrumb mixture wasn't well balanced at all. I will never make this again - not worth the time, trouble or expense.

Great, easy recipe.  I did however use panko, since that's all I use.  I also melted the butter in the micro with some fresh grated garlic and then added a splash of lemon juice.

This recipe is perfect!  I melted the butter along with garlic in the casserole dish in my oven and because I only had a little over a pound of scallops, added some shrimp. I used panko instead of regular bread crumbs and baked as directed.  This dish is delicious!

Made it last night. As a matter of personal taste, I reduced the grated fresh parmesan cheese by 1/2 and used whole wheat panko bread crumbs.  Absolutely delicious. Loved the jovial facial expression on my husband's face as he expressed his gratitude!

This was easy and very good. The prep was simple. I was a bit at a loss of what to serve with it and I didn't see others post their ideas. I did a light prep of fettuccine alfredo along with veggies and salad. It was good this way though a simpler and lighter pasta side would have been better. But the base recipe is very strong.

Fantastic recipe. I followed the recipe, except added fresh chopped ginger to the topping. I used any remaining ingredients after cooking the scallops to the noodles I served the scallops on.

I usually dredge each scallop in a bread crumb and parmesan mixture and then fry. This was not only easier but tastier as well.

This was wonderful!  After scalloping I was looking for a great way to enjoy our scallops without pasta.  I made it just like the recipe and they were absolutely delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as directed using Panko unseasoned bread crumbs. It was delicious and worthy of any high priced restaurant menu! Very easy and I will definitely make this again!

Very simple, quick and easy recipe. My variations after reading the reviews were to melt the butter in the dish add the rinsed and well dried scallops to the butter and stir to coat. For the bread crumb mixture I used old bay, fresh garlic, the Parmesan cheese and Panko bread crumbs. I sprinkled the mixture over the scallops and butter and then stirred it up really well to coat the scallops and soak up the butter. I baked them for about 15 minutes and they came out with a crunchy coating and perfectly cooked scallops. I served them over angel hair pasta coated with browned butter. As a side I had arugula, watermelon and feta salad. My family loved the salad with the pasta and scallops.

Very easy, tasty recipe for scallops. I love buttery scallops with lots of breadcrumbs, so this is one of my go-to standards.

Loved it! Didn't have breadcrumbs or fresh garlic and it didn't need breadcrumbs (bet they would have been delicious too!). Could have used the fresh garlic since u simply omitted it but even without it, dish was lovely!!! Thank you!!

The flavors were sincerely lacking. I feel like the recipe needed something like white wine, lemon or shallots. I will definitely continue searching.

I really made sure my scallops were dried before baking but the end result was still wet. I also felt like there was way too much bread crumb mixture for the amount of scallops and in the end I only used about half of the mixture. Although the flavor was good, the overall recipe results were disappointing for us.

This was delicious and easy, I added fresh squeezed lemon to it and a little extra garlic powder since I didn't have fresh.  To ELIMINATE the FISHY TASTE I SOAKED the SCALLOPS IN MILK AND LIME JUICE FOR ABOUT 45-60 MIN, THEN RINSED THEM. This was recommended and seriously worked on eliminating the overly fishy taste!!

My HUSBAND cooked these and they were delicious! the only change he made was to add a little cayenne pepper and we dredged the scallops in the breadcrumb/cheese mixture instead of sprinkling on top.  Delicious!!!!!

I thought the bread crumbs were a bit over-kill on this.  I followed the recipe but only used half the topping and still felt it was too much.  The flavor of the scallops was great.

Followed others recommendations to roll scallops in melted before rolling in crumbs.  Used panko crumbs, so they never got soggy.  Too much garlic.  Would  try 1/2 or 2 cloves next time.  Served over spaghetti, and spooned butter/ garlic sauce over.  Will make again, and try with shrimp.  Might add a little to the melted butter/garlic

Good basic recipe! Use fresh Cape Cod Nantucket Bay Scallops ,this makes the dish. Forget the frozen Chinese type. You won't even need the parmesan cheese as they are so very small and sweet! Hard to get but worth the effort when available! Good with the cheese too but I am a purist when it comes to scallops! Enjoy with a nice wedge of lemon.

Excellent! I used a thawed bag of frozen bay scallops that I rinsed and dried with paper towels. I also used buttery round crackers that I prefer over bread crumbs. I normally combine the crumbs and butter; here, I dipped the scallops into the butter, placed in casserole dishes and then covered with combined dry ingredients (including a little cayenne pepper and celery seed, a good Old Bay sub). It just looked dry to me so I drizzled an additional 2 tblsp of melted butter over it. I baked for about 18 min, and it was already browning. I love scallops prepared this way!

We love this recipe and our favorite with white fish. I put this in a bed do lemon slices and leave the onion out. I put the almonds on at the very end to toast a little and it is the perfect finish.

This had good flavour but I kind of over-cooked the large scallops I had.  400 degrees for 20 minutes, even the big scallops, is enough.  Maybe put under broil for a few minutes to crisp up a bit.

All of my family adored this recipe! I did make a couple adjustments, either because I didn't have it on hand or I needed a shortcut because I only had a small amount of time before bedtime. :) I only had jumbo scallops, and I used old bay seasoning instead of mixing and measuring everything. And I didn't have Parmesan so I used cheddar. Still came out great.

Awesome, made only one change! I sprinkled the bread crumb mixture and tossed scallops adding mixture to completely coat the scallops. Did not pour mixture on top!  It was great! Thanks

This was so good. I did what so many suggested. Melted the butter and garlic, mixed scallops in butter, rolled on bread crumbs/cheese/spices, sprayed casserole dish,baked for 15minutes. Perfect. Yum

I made this recipe using garlic bread crumbs cuz that's what I had. I also omitted the parsley cuz I didn't have any.  Everybody loved it. I'll be making this regularly. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This was so good - Only change I made was to use 2 lbs of scallops and used a bit more spices to accommodate that, otherwise did not change a thing - I will most certainly make this many more times - Thank you for the recipe

It was okay, but honestly, it was a little bland- which I couldn't figure out with the amount of spices in it!  We love scallops in our family, but couldn't get behind it.

Absolutely delicious. I baked them for only about 15 minutes because I like my scallops more tender and when I took them out of the oven they were perfect and oh-so-juicy. A little sprinkle of lemon juice on top as they come out all bubbly and cheesy and crunchy from the oven...to die for. Thanks for this amazing recipe :)

Oh, this was GOOD!  I cut the recipe down and made just enough for a couple of 2-cup Pyrex dishes for lunch at work (so, about 1/2 C frozen, thawed scallops total).  I used coconut oil in place of butter (I like the flavor!), skipped the minced garlic (it seemed a bit much with the powdered, but I might try it next time!) and used grated Asiago in place of the Parmesan.  And honestly, I really didn't measure; I just sprinkled in what looked right.  The cooking time was too long, but that stands to reason since I made 2 small bowls instead of 1 big one; I'll adjust it next time.  I didn't dry the scallops well but it came out crispy anyway.  GREAT flavor!  My coworkers, with their microwave meals, will be SO jealous!

I made these tonight with a small steak and thought they were wonderful.  I rolled them in the butter and bread crumbs as per other reviewers.  They were wonderful and sweet.  My friends tend to serve scallops wrapped in bacon, no seasoning and they usually end up dried out and salty from the bacon.  Can't wait to introduce them to this recipe!  Thank you.

Keeper! Absolutely loved them! So easy to make and so delicious! I used the big sea scallops. I didnt have any seasoned bread crumbs on hand so i smashed up butter crackers instead. Crackers and big scallops worked great! =) o yes! I sprinkled lemon juice on them too! I've never baked scallops before so i was scared but they came out perfect! No more sautéed scallops, trying to make sure you done under or over cook them! I totally prefer this baking method now. Also, My husband is so picky when it comes to scallops being cooked. He's actually picky w all food in general. Lol! He will straight out tell you if he dont like something, or if its too tuff, etc... But he said these were amazing!! =) Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe w us! =)

For the price...this was not exciting in any way.  I thought the breading had a weird flavor and it cooked too mushy with the butter.

My husband and I used Ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs, which I really think add a lot. This is my favorite way to make scallops, even over pan searing, etc. We've tried both sea scallops and bay scallops, and find that bay scallops are much sweeter and tastier than the larger ones.

We just got up from the table and I wanted to rate this while it was still fresh in my mind.  They were wonderful.  I did make one change,  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I used garlic cheese croutons that I ran through the food processor for bread crumbs.  My husband said he loved the scallops, but next time would I please put in more parmesan cheese.  This is a keeper, will print out and put in my notebook. Thank you.

I love this recipe, but I won't use butter next time. When I open the oven butter smoked, I don't think it is good for health.

This was awesome!  I was a little weary about using
garlic powder and fresh garlic so I only added half 
the amount of fresh garlic.  May try full next time.
I did cook with sea scallops.  This one is a keeper.
Thank you John

I thought the bread mixture was too much for the quantity of scallops, so only use enough to cover them.  Otherwise, these were amazing!

Good basic recipe. Just needed garlic browned in the butter and a little white wine added and reduced, a drizzle of lemon before topping with the bread crumb mixture.

Great recipe and the scallops are very delicious!  Also a very easy/fast recipe. The only thing is this recipe prob use a lot more butter than necessary, frankly.  We'll prob be tweaking it next time and reduce the fat content! But it was very delicious!

The flavor was amazing.  I followed another reviewer, and didn't let the scallops touch the edge of the dish while cooking.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  They cooked perfect but the bread topping was soggy on a majority of them.  Not sure what I did wrong, will try the recipe again.

One of my favourite recipes from this site. Turned out perfectly following the recipe as is. I have also tried using half scallops and half shrimp. So good, very rich. Restaurant quality. I prefer it as an appetizer rather than entree.

This recipe is good if you are a fan of buttery bread-battered seafood.  My husband liked it a lot, I liked it okay, but I guess I prefer scallops without the batter--it was just a bit too rich.  The only things I did differently were using defrosted frozen scallops and rolling the scallops in butter, then dipping them in the bread crumb mixture, as suggested by others.  If I had just sprinkled the mixture over the scallops as the recipe suggests, maybe I would have liked it better, but it would have been a waste--even after rolling the scallops in the mixture, I had at least 3-4 tablespoons leftover.  If you are going to follow the recipe and just sprinkle it, then I suggest you don't make as much of the bread crumb mixture.

Delicious!  I used sea scallops because that's what I had available.  Just - yum...I think next time I'll add some shrimp to it like other reviewers as I like shrimp too.  And any melted butter/seasoning that just happens to be on the bottom of the pan after you pull out the scallops is pretty tasty with a good sourdough or other artisan bread dipped into it!

These were very good.  I did have to use Sea Scallops due to the market not having Bay Scallops.  There was quite a bit of bread crumb mix for the 1 pound of Sea Scallops I used.  It was very good and I will definitely make it again.  I may place more parmesan on top of the crumbs next time.

Excellent recipe. Didn't make any changes and it was as good as most of the scallops dishes served in restaurants.  The scallops melted in your mouth.

This recipe is excellent! Followed exactly with the exception of using sea scallops and everyone (even the son who doesn't like seafood) loved it. The contrast between the flavorful crunchy topping and the delicate scallops is perfect. The baking time (20 min) was spot on in my oven. We will enjoy this again very soon. Thanks for sharing Mr. Bragg!

I don't often make scallops, so this was a new try for me.  I liked it, but it was definitely not a hit with the kids.

Followed recipe exactly, except I baked mine in a convection oven. My scallops turned out to be slightly overdone (I guess I should have reduced the oven temp & cooking time to account for the fact that I was using a convection oven). Flavour was okay, but I think it could use more herbs. Also, mine turned out soggy from the butter. Sorry, will not be making again.

I am an amature cook at best and am still intinidated by cooking fish, seafood; however I made this dish exactly as described and was very pleased with the results. I rarely eat scallops so my four star rating is only due to lack of experience with scallops. I also agree that this would be a good appetizer. I reheated the next day in the oven at 350 for 8 minutes and it was still great.

I thought this was a great easy recipe.  I used frozen Japanese Scallops and they worked fine.  The scallops were not as tender as I would have liked them to be; not sure if it is because I used frozen.  I used a GREAT bread crumb with lots of flavor: Progresso Garlic & Herb Bread Crumbs.  It added a lot of flavor and I used a bit more garlic powder and butter also.  I had no problems with it being runny.  It turned out great.  The breading was so yummy I am thinking of using that to stuff mushrooms as an appetizer for my next party.  Very easy and yummy dish to make.  A little on the heavy side for flavor the way I did it so recommend a light salad or steamed veggies as a side dish.

Very good! Like others have said, fresh parsley and a squeeze of lemon on top really takes the flavor to another level. I served the scallops over garlicky whole wheat pasta.  Thanks :)

ok recipe. A little bland as written. Next time I will cut the amount of crumbs down. The crumbs were thick in places and caused goo. I will also add seasonings.

This was awesome!!! Upon a couple of reviews I added a 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper to the breading and broiled the scallops for a few minutes after the initial twenty. This is definitely going to be made again and again in my house!

I made these for two, and followed the directions.  I did not add the minced garlice, and did not use all of the bread crumbs.  I did; however, put them on broil for about 3 minutes at 500 degrees, just prior to serving.  They were wonderful.. And listen to the person who said not to have the scallops touch the sides of the pan.  I did this and... it worked!!!  Enjoy!

This was very good.  I didn't have any onion powder so I chopped up 1/4 onion and threw it in.  Other than that I followed the directions and it came out great. Will be making this again.

Followed recipe exactly and scallops were just perfect. Everyone raved about them, they were very flavorful. I thought they might turn out too dry because there was no liquid added, but not dry at all.  Only thing I did different was to bake the scallops in individual bowls instead of one large casserole dish.

These were very easy and tasty.  I ran to the store to get the ingrediants and they were out of fresh scallops, so I bought frozen and thawed in water and apparently didn't dry well since it did add quite a bit of water to the dish when they were done.  I'll try again with fresh since this was quick and easy.

Wonderful!  Sooo easy- so tasty.  Will make again and again.  Ran out as i didn't expect my 5 year old son to love it so much.  Followed recipe exactly- used reg seasoned bread crumbs and scallops (that had been frozen).  Served with turnip greens, onions, mushrooms and garlic sauteed in olive oil.  Great side to this dish.  Thx for sharing this!

Very bland...flavors of the many spices did not penetrate the scallps and seemed like alot of trouble.  Pan frying with garlic would have been more flavorful....won't make again!

This dish was a delightful treat! The only change I would make would be to add some more butter to the bread crumb mixture so it cooks better. I rate it a 5!!!

I tried this last night. The recipe is so simple I really didn't expect much. I was quite surprised! This is flavorful, simple, and fast. The only thing I added to the recipe was a little Tony Chachere' cajun seasoning salt. That gave it a little extra bite. This was delicious! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious.  We will make one minor change & that is to drizzle some of the butter over the scallops & go alittle short on the bread crumbs.  I've had this recipe printed since 2003 & last night was the 1st time we finally got around to trying it.  Will make again & not wait so long.  Easy to make & tastes great.

These were restaurant quality! I was amazed how good these turned out! The breading taste was fantastic. However, I would reduce the amount of breading ingredients because it made twice as much as needed. The other thing you want to be careful of is the size of your scallops. Mine were slightly over cooked at 20 minutes and they were about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Other than that they were excellent!

My wife liked it more than I did... i think there needed to be more crust...  I broiled it for the last few min... maybe a bit longer under the broiler next time would do the trick.

I made half a batch last night for myself for dinner and I'm sitting here eating the last few cold for breakfast.  I ended up using Panko bread crumbs and I'm happy that I did.  Honestly, though, I probably will never use this recipe again.  The breading, in my opinion, is just not necessary.  I personally prefer my scallpos sautéed in butter on the stove top.

This is my go-to recipe for baking scallops.  I, too, dip the scallops in the melted butter and then roll them in the bread crumb mixture.  I do prefer to broil them, though, rather than bake them.

Absolutely delicious and super easy! Wish the topping was a little crisper, but I didn't mind it not being. Someone suggested putting in under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp it up. I'm going to try that next time because I will definitely make this again! Yum!

This was a big hit! I also added whole mushrooms that I stuffed with spinach sauteed with garlic and a mixture of goat cheese and parmesan cheese. I used a little crushed red pepper for some kick, too, and was glad I did. I just let the mushrooms cook with the scallops and then put it all on a bed of rice pilaf and served with steamed broccoli. So so so yummy, and I'll be making this one again for sure!

Hi, first time in rating a 5+Star recipe I used panko crumbs instead of reg bread crumbs and more garlic grated did not come out soggy I will make it again and again it was delicious.

Pretty darned good. I used sea scallops and mine were a tad overcooked, likely because of size. I also used fresh parsley. Hubby liked it... and he's hard to please! Even my 6 year old ate them :)

This was good, definitely needed to go over rice though. I made it without the breadcrumbs, which might have served the same purpose as the rice.

I took some tips from other reviewers & cut down on the butter a little bit.  I also dredged the scallops in the butter & tossed them in the bread crumbs. At the very end, I broiled for just a minute or so to crisp them up and they turned out fantastic! I served with salad and grilled asparagus and my husband went through the roof! Thanks for a great recipe!

Nice and garlicky! You can easily get away with fewer bread crumbs if you want the scallopy taste to stand out.

The taste was good but the consistency was less than desireable.  It was soggy.  Could be my error, but husband who likes everything didn't like the texture.

Good recipe.  I decided to follow some other reviewers and dip each scallop in butter, and then roll in the breadcrumb/cheese mixture.  It made for delightful little medallions that were perfectly textured.  Cooked for 20 at the recommended temperature, and then finished with a few minute of carefully watched broiling.  Would make again.

Great!  My husband loved it.  My four year old put ketchup on it and loved it!  Used Italian breadcrubs because that's all I have and frozen bay scallops.  I divided the dish to bake in 2 smaller baking dishes (like 1qt dishes)was a nice presentation and they were not soggy!! Yummmm!!

I used sea scallops, and will try bay next time. I agree that a minute or two under the broiler at the end helps crisp up the topping. I served these with salad and couscous, but since there is a lot of the breading, next time I will go with a salad and another vegetable. My husband really enjoyed them and it only took 25-30 minutes from start to hitting the table!!

We liked the flavor a lot.  The crust turned out better after we bit it for 3 minutes with the broiler.  And we did add about a pound of peeled and deveined shrimp (I chopped the tales off).  It did get rave reviews but it is a little rich for a main course.  Would make an excellent side dish or appy.

Yum yum! I usually don't like scallops, but this definitely worked out. I ended up using crushed bagel chips since I didn't have bread crumbs... probably didn't end up with the right consistency on top, but it was still really tasty.

Delicious! This is the best baked scallops I have tasted! I used crushed garlic & butter croutons instead of breadcrumbs & just used a little less garlic powder. Turned out fantastic!

My husband and I enjoyed these scallops very much.  I had decided to make them on a very hot day and didn't want to turn on the oven, so I ended up using an oval pan that I have and just put that on the gas grill which I had preheated and they turned out great!  I served them over pasta....tasted almost like a scampi.

The taste was pretty good but, like others, the breading was soggy. I should have put them under the broiler for a minute or two.

I found this recipe to be fantastic! It has been a repeated request of my family and friends! I would have to agree with the last review of drying the scallops out on paper towels before continuing. Makes a big difference! Other than that, this dish is easy and very tasty!

I didn't care for this at all. I followed the recipe exactly other than only using the garlic powder, instead of both garlic powder and fresh garlic. Even so, all I could taste was the paprika and garlic. It totally overwhelmed the flavor of the scallops. My husband liked it, though, so at least it didn't go to waste.

This recipe is just okay. I have had better and I think the breadcrumbs need to be wet before they are baked. The way the recipe is written the crumbs are just sitting on the scallops and not sticking. They aren't as crispy as I prefer. If you add a bit of olive oil or melted butter to the topping, it raises the flavor of the parsley and provides a nice crispy topping.

Very nice flavor.  I rinsed and dried the scallops.  Coated them with a little olive oil and then tossed them with the bread crumb mixture.  Placed the scallops in the butter and then sprinkled on the extra crumb mixture.  Served it with green salad and noodles.  Yum.  Nice change from scampi-style.

I made this with shrimp instead of scallops. We loved it. Next time I would half the bread crumb mixture. Otherwise, great recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I added a few spices of my own liking, the family loved it.  The only major change was that I used about 1/3 less butter, cutting down on the fat, and I mixed shrimp and scallops.  Regardless, it was very good, family enjoyed it, wants it again - soon!

\This is the second time I've made it and I now do the dipping in the butter and garlic, then in the bread crumb mixture. I was careful about not  having it touching the sides. 20 minutes is fine, after that it would have been rubbery.

The breading didn't exactly stick to the scallops like I thought it would, but the whole thing was pretty tasty, so I can't complain too much. =) Thanks!

Great taste.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only changes I will make next time are cutting down on the amount of topping and cooking only 15 minutes or so.  Cooking 20 minutes was a little long for bay scallops and they got a little tough.  Will definitely do again though and will try with shrimp.

Delicious! I also used Panko breadcrumbs mixed with italian breadcrumbs and it came out great. I put fresh parsley and paprika on top for a nice touch and presentation. Will definitely make this a regular recipe for my family.

Very good recipe - I am one to usually alter recipes so here's what I did and they came out great.  I substituted the butter with olive oil (but less than what was suggested) and broiled the scallops for about 2 minutes to brown.  I also substituted italian seasoning for parsely and added some thyme. Instead of bread crumbs, I used reduced fat Ritz crackers - a delicious alternative. Also used less garlic than what was in the recipe.  Overall - I liked it a lot and would definitely cook it again.

I loved these! So easy too. I used thawed frozen scallops, and my only mistake was not drying them well after rinsing, as another reader suggested. The topping would be awesome on other seafood as well. Thanks!

This was only okay.  I made it exactly by the recipe, but I think it would have been better with some lemon juice as others have said.  My breadcrumbs were half soggy and half crunchy, so they were okay.  It wasn't bad, but I probably won't make it again.

Not sure how I really felt about this, but it was okay at best. I used less butter and plain breadcrumbs (just due to availability). The flavor was mediocre, not sure the seasoned crumbs would have just knocked it out of the ballpark. Probably wouldn't do again, would stick with a grilled variety of scallops.

The recipe itself is quite good. However, I did halve the suggested amount of butter. But to not lose the  moisture content while cooking, I added 2 tbsp. lemon juice to the melted butter. All in all, this recipe is a keeper and I will be making it again.

This is a keeper. However, it needs a little spice and maybe more cheese. VERY EASY and the small scallops are very sweet.

WOW - this was awesome!!  My only regret is that I didn't make more.  I followed the directions exactly.  We used fresh scallops that we caught in the Gulf of Mexico.  Next time I may use slightly more garlic, but this one is close to perfect!

These were okay, but there is way too much butter.  They were very simple and quick to prepare, though.  I'd give them 3 1/2 stars if I could.

we really didn't care for this recipe as it is. I think there was too much breading, and that covered the taste of the scallops.  I believe I will try again, with less topping.

My husband and I usually prefer sea scallops over bay scallops, but after trying this recipe we have a new favorite. This recipe is fantastic, and will definitely become a regular on our menu. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us John. It was a big hit.

This was good, although I found it to be heavy on the butter.  I prefer the larger scallops usually, but this was very easy and tasty.

I don't ususally like a recipe so much as to make it a second time, but this recipe is awesome. Since I'm on a low carb diet, I would decrease the amount of bread crumbs. Other than that, the recipe is great.

I usually enjoy just about all new recipes I try. This, however, is a much different story. None of us enjoyed this dish at all. I don't think it was because the recipe was bad, though. I think it was just more of a personal taste. I've had scallops plenty of times and loved them but tonight was different. Thanks anyway!

This was a good recipe, very very flavorful, quick and easy.  My only mistake was pairing it with scalloped potatoes from a box. There was too much salt/flavor between the two.  The scallops need to be paired with something bland like rice or orzo.

Well, it seems you either love this recipe or you hate it.  I didn't absolutely hate it, but it wasn't good enough that I would make it again.  I guess it's just a matter of taste.  Followed the recipe exactly, but still didn't like it that much.

This dish turned out horrible.  I followed it exactly and the scallops were swimming in nasty juice and the bread crumb mixture was just a bunch of dry crumbs on top.  Not sure what I did wrong, but no one would even eat it...and my husband does not waste food!!

Pretty good, I've never had scallops before but I liked them in this dish. I did health it up a bit though. I didn't use butter and didn't have breadcrumbs so I didn't have those.  These are pretty good on top of a salad as well as by themselves.

HORRIBLE!!  I made NO CHANGES to the recipe ~ followed it exactly and was sorely disappointed.  The bread crumbs and parmesan cheese combination was very overpowering!  My husband and I both love garlic/seafood combinations and even I was a bit leery of all the garlic that went into this dish.  I can't even think of any changes that I would do to make this dish better except for finding a new recipe.

I got some scallops on sale at the grocery store and needed a good recipe.  This one sounded so simple and easy, I had to try it.  It turned out great!  The flavor is great!  I ended up eating it as my main course because it was so good, but it would make a great side dish too.

I have made these twice now with rave reviews from my husband. I enjoyed them but think they are slightly too garlicky. next time I will try eliminating the garlic powder and see if that's better.

Good recipe, the only complaint is that it was very salty.

This was my first time making scallops so I was nervous because they are expensive and I didn't want to ruin them. I used sea scallops and didn't add the bread crumbs just because I prefer not to; they came out wonderful. I made this for the Poor Man's Supper Christmas Eve and it was a hit! Thanx!

Thought this would be better than it was. I followed the recipe exactly and it was just ok, not bad, but not great either. The topping was mushy and not too appealing and seemed to over power the scallops.  Probably won't add this one to my keeper list.

This recipe was very good.  My husband hated scallops ever since a child, but when I made this, he actually liked them a lot.  My kids also dislikes anything seafood, but they tried it, and loved it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was so excited about making this recipe, seeing as it had received so many great reviews. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed. I sprayed the scallops with butter flavored Pam, rolled them in the breading, placed them in the baking dish, then sprinkled some of the breading on top. When we came to eat it, the topping was really soggy, and not very pleasant. I have other scallop recipes to try so I doubt I will be making this again. Thanks anyway.

I liked this quite a bit....the breading on the top did get kind of mushy, but that was no big deal to me.   They were really good when afterwards I kind of rolled them around in the juices.....yum!

This recipe was ok.  I don't think I will make it again.  It would have been better if the topping stayed crisp, but it got mushy.

I love this recipee, I found it quite a while ago and never cooked scallops any other way since.  I have had many compliments from guests on this recipee.  They are perfectly delicious!! But, if you are not a big fan of garlic just put 1 clove instead of 3.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was AWESOME!!! It was better than what I was daydreaming of all afternoon before making it. I guess some reviewers didn't like the amount and crunchiness of the topping, but I was surprised to find that it was the BOMB!!!

I'll be making this when I want to impress some company, or when my husband has been particularly sweet. (I made it last night because he scraped my car after a surprise snowstorm.)

I love this recipe!  I found it on here about a year ago, and was in heaven from the first time I have made it. The scallops are nice and juicy, this does not dry out the scallops when they are cooked, and the seasoning is perfect.  This is my favorite meal now!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so good.  We have never had scallops prepared this way.  Delicious!  We plan on making it again.  The ingredients are things you'd probably have in the house, so all you'd need is scallops.  Very very easy.

Thought this was a great way to prepare scallops.  However, thought it was a little too garlicky.  Next time I will omit the garlic powder and just do fresh garlic.

The recipe was very easy, but there was too much topping!!!  The topping was  VERY heavy and overpowered the scallops--I wouldn't make again--I think a better alternative would be to bake the scallops with some butter, garlic, a little lemon juice, and some creole seasoning.

This recipe was FABULOUS and since this is the first time I've made scallops at home, I must say, it will be the only recipe I use when making scallops...We had company the next day and had them try a few leftover scallops cold and they LOVED them....Thank You!!!!!

This is a delicious and easy recipe for scallops. We used bay scallops and they turned out perfect. Makes an elegant meal in no time (and little work).
