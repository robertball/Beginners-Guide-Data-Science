Delicious! Very rich & moist! However, the frosting is runny, too much liquid. The next time I try this, I'll cut the amount of milk in half. Very simple to make, but I'll also likely use a bowl to mix the ingredients next time. Mixing the cocoa & ingredients in a pan was too much work.

Oh what a smoking disaster. Please note, microwave times will vary! Besides the fact that in under 10 minutes it charred to become something you might expect to find at the bottom of a fire pit, it was not only too bubbly to support it's weight but also overflowed all over the (fortunately removable) rotating microwave plate. I can't say if this cake was tasty or not as I didn't dare put any in my mouth. However, it doesn't smell wonderful while cooking (even before burning).  I know I'm crazy, but I think I'm willing to try this again.
