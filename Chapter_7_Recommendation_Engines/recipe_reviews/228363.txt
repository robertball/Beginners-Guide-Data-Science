I subbed arrowroot starch for the flour for a gluten free version and it rocked the house.  I cooked the whole chicken for about 20 minutes on 350* then it was time to go for the run so I turned it down to 200* and was gone about 2.5 hours.  When I got back it was perfect. so very perfect.  scraps will make a fabulous bone broth!

This was good but I did not have the fennel, and I did cook it for 1 1/2 hrs. But over all it was juicy and very flavorful.

I made this for my family. Of course I changed it alittle bit because I always do my own thing but my family loved it. It is a great way to make oven fried chicken.

This was a big hit with my family; they demolished a whole bird--a rare occurrence!  I really liked the spices and herbs in the rub and the bird was just delicious--and crispy, as the recipe promised.  I would definitely make this again.  Thank you so much!  Oh--instead of cutting the bird in two, I just cooked it whole for an hour and a half.  Lovely.

I will be posting pix of this after dinner but I had to write this after I sliced off a bit of this heavenly chicken. This is so freakin' juicy and I love the mix of spices. The only advice I would give is to grind your spices in a blender for quicker and finer results. Other than that, followed it to a T. Love it! My pix will not do this justice but thanks for sharing Doc!

I followed this recipe exactly and I will say the seasoning blend was fabulous, I took it out of the oven when my thermometer beeped 165 and the white meat was very dry while the dark meat was perfect. I will make this again but with leg quarters only. Thank you for the recipe!

This was so tasty and easy. We did this on the grill. We were worried about the fennel overpowering the flavor but it didn't. Tastes just like roasted chicken should. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Just awesome!! I used chicken thighs instead of the whole chicken. Super easy and very flavorful. Didnt have sage but used all the other spices and added some cayenne pepper for some heat. 15 mins in a convection oven and it was ready to be devoured !!

This was great! Trying to make it a bit more healthier I ended up cutting out the flour and only using 4 tablespoons of oil. I brushed it on skinless chicken breasts, it wasn't crispy but I wasn't expecting it to be without the skins on. Next time I will cut the oil down more, as it was still a bit oily after it was cooked. Very good mixture though!

Tried this recipes and loved it.  Put carrots, celery and parsnips around the edge of the chicken and they were cooked in the juices.  Fabulous.

I followed this recipe exactly, with the exceptions of deciding to "tent" the chicken so it didn't get too brown and using a whole chicken.My family went nuts, it is honestly one of the very best recipes on this site. Excellent cold the next day too! Thanks a lot for a permanent addition to our dinner rotations!

BEST chicken marinade I've tried thus far on this site. Left out the oil since I'm watching fat intake & did grilled chicken breasts instead. Flavor was FANTASTIC.

This is a quick, delicious recipe. The only thing I do differently is double the amount of salt. It is so good.

This combination of flavors is excellent. I was initially hesitant because of the combination of ingredients but it came out great! I adjusted the cooking technique a little bit, I cooked it on 250F for several hours and than broiled it at the end to get the crispness.

This is a great spice combo. Delicious.  Thanks for posting, Doc!

I put the chickens in the oven breast-side down and roast for about 45? minutes or so.  Turn over so the breast side is up, then another 45 or so (all depending on how many and how big are your chickens.  I always do 2 at once to make good use of the energy expended).  

This method seems to keep the white meat nice and moist.

Bon appetite!!

Lots of flavor! I subbed out the flour with all purpose gluten free flower and that may be why it wasn't as crispy as I would have a liked. But, overall, delicious flavor, tender and juicy!

I just logged on to save this to my recipe box. It was excellent. In reading a review about a gluten free version I realized I totally missed the flour in the recipe. It was still great! Thanks for sharing - and the spaetzle tip - perfect supper - all that could have made it better was having beer!

I've made this several times, initially as directed then subsequently different variations due to spices on-hand (or not on-hand). I've cooked the chicken both cut up and as a whole fryer, either way it has always been deliciously moist, and so flavorful! And as added bonuses, the carcass makes great stock and the left over chicken is wonderful in chicken wild rice soup. This recipe has become such a family favorite that two birds are always cooked in order to have left-overs!

Excellent! Chicken turned out tender & very juicy. The herbs/spices were subtle, a wonderful tasty blend, next time I'll double them.

Mine didnt turn out really crispy but I really liked the spice mix and the meat was moist, if you don't plan on eating the skin make sure to rub some underneath the skin to get more flavor on the meat because it doesn't soak through much. I think im going to steal the spice mix for to make a similar rub for pork or something in my smoker bet it would go great with hickory.

Great flavor! Maybe I need to check my oven temp, but I had this in for 35 minutes at 400 degrees and it was done, so I'd watch the time and the temp. Worth the eagle eye, because this coating is wonderful!

I followed this to the letter, worked great. Took a little less time in my oven but I didn't pay attention to the weight of the chicken first, seemed a tad small but it tastes amazing. I wouldn't change a thing.

I feel the spice paste was too heavy on the paprika and way too many calories added with the oil. The texture on the baked skin was mealy (that's the best word I can find to describe it). Considering all the great reviews, we were disappointed. You should probably try it yourself at least once though. Lots of people love it.

Chicken came out delicious and juicy. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe.  I didn't cut the chickey in half and I added another teaspoon of salt. I cooked the chicken at the stated temperature for 45 minutesthen took the chicken out and poured its juices over it. After that I cooked the chicked for an additional 45 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have any fennel or kosher salt so I used regular salt.

Cooked for 65 minutes. Took it out and let stand for five minutes then sat back and basked in the glow of the accolades. Definitely a keeper. I am going to mix up a batch of the powdered ingredients so I always have them on hand. Then prep time would be reduced to about 10 minutes...just mix in the veggy oil and spread it on the chicken halves. Normally we don't eat the skin on chickens but my wife couldn't resist, it looked and smelled so good. Scrumptious.

Used this for basic cooking time. Only made one half of a chicken (2 pounds) with salt and pepper. We roasted it in an 8 inch cast iron after cooking bacon. Excellent results!

Spices were off I think it needs more paprika. Also, cooking was off too. It's hard to get the whole chicken done uniformly. Take out at 160 as it cooks out of the oven. It was over done.

Other than varying the seasonings, the only semi-major change I did was to increase the amount of the coating. I will never again roast a whole chicken. I have used several variations of the season - spicy, heavy, BBQish etc - and every time come out with thoroughly cooked, moist chicken (I'm tempted to cut a turkey in half and see how that works out). This is forever my method to roast chickens.

Really tasty. I substituted the sage with parsley and added peppercorn. I wouldn't grind spices to finely either, a little bit of texture gives the chicken a little "fried" chicken vibe.  Important, don't overcook it. I know this goes without saying but the moist chicken paired with the seasoning is key. Spoon some of the drippings over the chicken before serving.

The spice rub is nice, but the cooking method isn't.  The white meat will be WAY over cooked for that heat and time.  Either (a) spatchcock the bird and remove when 160 (which will be ~15m earlier) (b) cut up the bird and test white meat around 30-40m and remove while dark meat finishes.

Delicious.  Did not come out as crispy as indicated, and a thermometer got to 165F in a bit over 30 minutes - and I turned the oven down after 20 as the chicken was about to burn.

Next time, I'll try baking it at 400F.

The recipe turned out great, with the wonderful flavor. The reason I gave four stars is because the chicken wasn't quite done after one hour, it needed about another 15 minutes.

I guess I added a little too much spice and found I didn't need to cook as long.  First time splatting a chicken so it was probably a bit over cooked

I made this with skinless boneless chicken breasts.  Cooked in a convection oven at 425 for 15 minutes.  So juicy and tender and absolutely delicious.  I had two large chicken breasts and halved everything in the recipe.  Used 2 T vegetable oil.

Great flavor & texture. My husband loved it  I roasted it in aluminum pan on the grill outdoors to avoid heating up the kitchen.  The ingredients were a surprising taste treat.  We buy whole chickens on sale & freeze them in halves for just my husband & I and this was an easy way to prepare with great crispy skin.

This was fantastic - i don‘t think my family will ever want anything but this when it comes to roast chicken.  Used a whole chicken the first time i made it, then just thighs and drumsticks because they were on sale.  a big winner either way.  Also, I made a delicious gravy from the pan drippings with a simple flour slurry on the stovetop while the chicken rested.  My kids and husband loved it.  Will be a repeat for sure!

Good base recipe.  I liked the seasoning mixture, but there was too much oil - it was more of a liquid than a paste.  I had a 5lb chicken and it only needed 45 min. cooking time.  I'll definitely make this again, but may tweak the topping and cooking time.

This recipe did not seem to have much flavor. The amount of salt was only 1 tsp for a whole chicken and I thing that is the biggest reason for the lack of flavor even though there are many herps and spices to this recipe. Next time I think I will use a Tbsp of salt and see if that helps.

I followed the recipe exactly except I did not have any coriander so I do not add any. After reading other reviews they said an hour of baking was too long. I checked the temperature of the chicken after 30 minutes. Then I checked it again another 15 minutes later. Chicken was at 165 so I pulled it out and tented it with foil to let it rest. My husband absolutely loved it along with my kids. It was so tender and Juicy and Delicious. I definitely wants to use this recipe again. My husband is usually the cook of the house. So I was worried that it was not going to meet his expectations. But it did!

Surprisingly I had all the spices!  It was so moist and delicious I won't change anything. DH keeps asking if there is anything else I can put the spice mixture on and licking his fingers. First time he has ever raved about my roast chicken.

Turned out great. As I like spice I also added some siracha spice and African pili pili.

Great flavor...suggest doubling down on ingredients to have enough rub for entire chicken.

I didn't have the fennel seeds or onion powder, but  otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Delicious and juicy.

The spice rub was pretty good.  I used 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of  two (and that was plenty of garlic for my taste).  I used split chicken breasts and baked for 45 minutes.  I would give this recipe 3.5 stars.

Cooked with slight alterations, quartered and de-boned the chicken before broiling, was popular with everyone. Can see making this again.

This did not  turn out like I expected it to.  The  flour  oil coating burned while the skin stayed moist and not crispy.  My  oven has been calibrated and I've  been cooking and baking successfully for the past 30 years.  I don`t   know  how the other people can give positive reviews  on this recipe.  Unless they  changed it. Otherwise I can not  figure out what went wrong.

I made the recipe exactly as written and we loved it!  I made gravy from the pan drippings by adding chicken broth and flour. The gravy was wonderful with flavor from the spice rub. Will put this recipe in rotation.

Followed directions except that I made it on barbeque. Sear both sides for 5 minutes or so. Indirect heat for an hour.

We loved this, didn't have the fennel and I didn't miss it. Used legs so cooking time wasn't as long, served with rice and glazed carrots and had a wonderful meal.

Seriously delicious. I used a spice grinder for the whole spices, but followed the recipe exactly aside from that. The meat was so moist and tender, and everyone loved the flavor. I will definitely be making this again and again. I may try making a pan gravy with the drippings next time for mashed potatoes.

I made the rub per the recipe.  I did make it in an iron skillet with another skillet on top for quicker cooking.  It turned out great!

Made this tonight for the first time and it was a huge hit!  I didn't have caraway seeds, fennel, or coriander but I did use all the other spices mentioned. I also replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil which I prefer for health reasons. I basted the chicken throughout the cooking process. The breast meat turned out a little dry so next time I will take it out probably five minutes earlier.  either way it turned out to be absolutely delicious and my husband asked me to put a regular rotation!

This is the BEST roasted chicken I have ever made...  Only made a few adjustments... Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, garlic salt instead of kosher salt & garlic powder, and minced onion instead of onion powder...  Everything else as called for... The flavor was incredible and the meat was super juicy & tender... I could have eaten the whole chicken all by myself... Yummm!!!!

One of the best things I've made from this site. But watch your cooking time.  This recipe is for a 4 lb chicken. I used a 3lb chicken and should have only baked it for 45 minutes not an hour. It was a little dry but the flavor was outstanding!
