I have been making these for years now and they are always a big hit. I do offer a couple suggestions. I use the round pretzels that are usually available around the holidays. The Rolo fits nicely inside it and makes for the perfect little treat. Also, after these are completely cooled, I melt a cup of white chocolate chips with a little Crisco, place it into a zip lock bag cutting a small hole in the corner. I then drizzle it over the turtles. They turn out beautiful.

Do yourself a favor and double the recipe. As long as you're going to make them, it doesn't really add much more time and expense, and these were a big hit! I couldn't find Rolos, but I did find Dove Chocolates w/Caramel. They worked perfectly and are very good (smoother/creamier than Rolos). I also used the square shaped "Snap" pretzels. The chocolates fit very well on top. Baked the candies for only 3 min. - more than enough time. I think any longer and you run the risk of the caramel squishing out of the chocolate candy when you place the pecan halves on top. Be gentle or you'll have a mess on your hands, and they'll be sticky and messier to hold when served. Chill them out in the fridge for 1/2 hr. or so and they should pop right off the parchment paper. I also pre-toasted the pecans. Toasting/roasting nuts always makes them taste better. Coated the pecan halves with a little melted butter, and baked for 10 - 15 min @ 325 (watch to prevent burning). Let cool, then proceed w/recipe. Again - something so easy, and they're really popular!

These have got to be the simplest treat ever to make and yet are SO VERY ADDICTIVE!  Make sure that you make at least two batches... one to enjoy right away and another so that you'll have more for tomorrow or for that special event that they were originally intended for! I used the square grid-shaped pretzels with Rolos on top and to save time, I topped them with the pecan halves before placing them in the oven so that the pecans could toast slightly as the Rolos soften.  After about 5 minutes in the oven, I just pressed down on each pecan which caused the Rolos to spread out perfectly over the square pretzel.  They looked absolutely beautiful and presentable plus you can turn out hundreds of these quite fast.  They just take a while to fully cool and set up but this can be remedied too by putting them in the refrigerator on an empty shelf to cool completely before storing them in plastic zip-top bags.  These even taste great without the added nuts on top for those (especially kids) that don't quite appreciate nuts.  Just flatten the heated Rolos with the back of a slightly oiled spoon to look like little kisses sitting on top. This will definitely be a staple for the holidays.  Thank you for sharing this delightful recipe.

These were a bit too rich for me, but judging by how fast they vanished from the party I brought them to, everyone else must have disagreed with me. These got RAVE REVIEWS! I did take the advice of a few others and here's what you need to do to make these perfect... Use the square "waffle" style pretzels as they absolutely work the best. Don't buy "Rolo's" as your choice of caramel filled chocolates, but rather use the "Dove" brand instead, (they are also square and fit perfectly atop the waffle pretzel). I placed a pecan half on top of each chocolate and baked. When I took them out of the oven, I just gently pushed down on each pecan to make it ooze into the chocolate & caramel. (If you do it this way, you skip the step of toasting the pecans since they toast while they bake.) I would also suggest doubling this if you are taking it to a party. They do not last long!

These truly are delicious.  I make mine in the microwave.  I arrange a circle of 9 pretzels (topped with the Rolo) on wax paper on top of a small plastic cutting board. Microwave about 30 seconds, remove from the microwave and squish a pecan half on top of each one.  Then I just slide the wax paper off on the counter so they can cool and do another batch. The chocolate should be soft when you squish the nut on, but if the caramel oozed out of the Rolo while in the microwave, cut the time down a couple of seconds. I make the whole bag of Rolos while I'm at it.  The thing that takes the longest is unwrapping all of the candies!

Awesome.  I love making these as Christmas gifts.  They're a huge hit.   Rolos are the best to use, as caramel Hershey Kisses get messy when you put the pecan on.  Oh, and using roasted/salted pecans makes it too salty.  Delicious!

One of my students brought these to a potluck.  They are wonderful!  I made them 3 times between Christmas and New Years and everyone loved them.  They are very quick to make.  Just allow time for them to set up afterward.  I also toast the peacans in a pan on the stove before I put them on the pretzel.  It makes a big difference.

I make about 15-20 different Xmas cookies every year.  This year, these cookies were the hit of them all.  I used one bag of rollo candies and could have made another bag's worth easily.  Everybody loved these.  This will be one of the "regulars" of the cookie season.

Ok, here is the deal.  I couldn't find the choco covered caramels, so my husband grabbed reg. caramels.  We had hershey kisses, we had the reg. caramels, and we had the caramel dove chocolates.  so i made them w/the dove chocos and the square waffle pretzels and i also made a batch w/the reg. caramels on the waffle pretzels with a hershey kiss pressed into the caramel(pointy side dug into caramel, very easy to do...just take the caramel off the pretzel so as not to crush and push in) I topped each w/ a toasted pecan half.  The dove batch took 2 minutes and the caramel batch took 4.  And, I have to disagree with alot of reviewers, we LOVED the REAL caramel with the chocolate kiss so much more that the dove ones.  They were chewier, they were much tastier and funner to eat.  The caramel dove chocolates have runny insides so they don't give this a real turtle quality, though they are good....just not as good as a real caramel.  (they don't set up as good either) Try this my way with a plain caramel and a hershey kiss. YUM!!! just don't be afraid to really push that pecan into the caramel when they are done, and let the chocolate ooze all over. Perfection.

These are great and super easy!  People absolutely love these.  I gave them as gifts last year, and last weekend I cranked out 200 to give as gifts this year.  I use rollos and holiday shaped pretzels and I heat them on foil.  3 minutes is plenty of time. Once they're cooled (an open window and a cold climate help, you could stick them in the fridge too) they easily come off the foil.  I agree with the reviewer who said put the pecans on before heating.  I also like to sprinkle a little cinnamon on them before putting them in the oven.  It gives the pecans a great taste.  I do some with holiday M & Ms pressed into the warm rollos- 2 or 3 on each, depending on how big the pretzel is and how much I want the rollo to spread.  Also, I recommend unwrapping the rollos as you watch TV.  I get out one bowl to put foil in and another to put the unwrapped rollos in and start unwrapping.  Then I can just close up the rollo container and use them when I'm ready to make these.  Oh, and don't forget to recycle that foil! And if anyone is wondering, a standard sized bag of rollos has approximately 50 candies.

This was so very good! Its very expensive also! This cost $11.50 for 35 pieces. I used Dove brand chocolate covered caramels ($4.49), butter snap pretzels ($1.99) and store brand pecan halves ($4.99)...but is was easy and very elegant looking. I'll make this again, but only for special occasions.

MAKE IT SIMPLE!!!!  Put your square pretzel on bottom,  a Dove carmel chocolate next, and then the pecan half.  Bake for 3 to 4 minutes at 300* 
Put it in the refrigator immediately to cool for about 20 minutes.
Don't make it harder than it really is people!!

It says "chocolate covered caramel candies" and the only ones I could find were Hershey's with caramel centers.  Perhaps that was the problem? After 4 minutes at 300, the chocolate was not soft enough to push a pecan into and have it stay. 2 more minutes, then 2 more minutes. I finally tried turning up the temp. That caused the caramel to all ooze out and yet still the chocolate was not soft enough to hold the nuts.  All of the nuts fell off, and I was left with gooey sticky caramel pretzels. If Dove chocolate caramels are the only product that will work (as recommended by some reviewers), it would be helpful to put that in the recipe. I may try this again if I can find those.

These turned out gorgeous! I used Snyder's square Butter Snap pretzels and Dove Milk Chocolates with Caramel. I used one 6 oz package of pecan halves, which took two 9.5 oz bags of chocolates. I did follow the suggestion of roasting the pecans with a little melted butter. I think 4 minutes in the oven is a bit too long... you run the risk of the caramel seeping out the bottom. I put mine in for maybe two minutes, at the most. As soon as the chocolate is a bit shiny, you can easily press the pecan half on top without smushing the caramel out of the candy. These looked and tasted amazing, thank you!

I can't stop making these!!!!!!!! So easy & so good! I have used regular pretzels, butter pretzels, Dove caramels & cheap wal-mart caramel cups, all with great results. I like to sprinkle a small amount of coarse sea salt over the top while still warm because I love salted caramels. You can't go wrong!

Great easy recipe.  I can't attest to taste, but the Rolos were MUCH easier to work with than the Dove w/ caramel.  I made these with two bags of Rolos and one bag of Dove and also experimented with two types of pretzels (Synder's of Hanover Mini and Butter Snaps).  I followed the directions exactly (although I toasted the pecans first as other reviewers suggested).  The Rolos came out perfect and I was able to push the pecan in gently so that it all stuck to the pretzel, and none of the caramel came out.  The Dove did not melt enough, so I either had to push the pecan in too hard and ended up with caramel oozing out the side, or have the three ingredients not stick together.  I tried a second time with the Dove leaving them in the oven longer, but that did not help either - the caramel ended up oozing out while in the oven and then I had a mess that I just had to throw away.  If I was going to try it with the Dove again, I might try putting them in longer at a lower temperature, but since they taste so good with the Rolos and are cheaper to make that way, I don't think I'll bother.

OMG after making peanut butter buckeyes last night, late, late into the night  :)  I just wanted a no brainer, easy fast candy to do next on my list for my Christmas candies. I preheated my oven while unwrapping the rolos, slid my pretzels into the oven to warm them then stuck my rolos on and put a pecan half on top, then back into oven for the 3 min.  Brought them out, recentered my pecans while pushing them into the rolos and they turned out great.  Start to finish was even less than the ready time stated.  Tip here: to cut some of the cost, buy the 3oz pkg of smaller pecan halves in the baking aisle. Its around $2.50 and I'll have enough for approx 3 batches of these candies from that small bag.  Rolos big bags have about 50 pieces for around $3.00.    Altogether, nice easy fun delicious candy

Wow! What a simple but tasty treat!  I made them for Super Bowl Sunday.  It was hard to choose a dessert that people would like while drinking beer, but this one is a hit! Everyone liked the sweet and salty factor.

These are the absolute best little treats in the world!  I have been making them for years!  Because they disappear so quickly, I always buy 4 bags of Rolos and make as many as I can!  These are VERY easy to make and take no time at all.  I find it easier to unwrap all of the Rolos first and then just line a baking sheet with as many square pretzels as you can and start topping them with the Rolos.  I use a 200° oven and bake for 3-5 minutes.  If you bake to hot and too long the Rolos melt too fast and squish out the bottom of the Rolo when you put your pecan on top and then later the chocolate gets a white film and they don't look so pretty!  Great recipe but really 20 is not enough!!

These were delicious!  I used the square pretzels and I agree with other reviewrs that the hardest part of these is unwrapping the candies! You can make so many in a short amount of time.  This recipe is a keeper!

These are addictive... I toast the pecans first (dip in melted butter, sprinkle with salt, put in oven for 5-10 min @ 350), which really enhances the nutty flavor.  I used Dove Caramel chocolates and Snyder's waffle shaped pretzels and it works perfectly (there's no way to avoid having a little leakage of caramel though, when you press the pecan on top).  Delicious recipe!

Everyone who has tried these has loved them. I made them for my daughter for Valentine's Day - and she was excited to learn how easy they were and make them herself a week later. I use an entire package of Rolos (~56). I also tried them with "peanut butter pretzel sandwiches" - yum! And I made them with caramels - no chocolate - for my chocolate hating son. Worked great, and he really liked them - but they need to bake ~8 minutes for the caramel to soften enough to press the pecan into it . . . I made these for Valentine's Day again this year. I gave some "naked turtles" [no chocolate] to my daughter's chocolate-hating bf [where do these people come from?], and got a text back that said "Barbara!!! The naked turtles are freaking delicious!!!" =D

So simple, yet so good. I followed another reviewer's advice and placed the pecan half on top of the caramel chocolate before placeing in the oven so that it would toast. I then pressed the nut into the softened chocolate. Worked like a charm. Thanks for posting!

I used chocolate carmel cups from the $1 store, put thepecanhalf on top before baking, then just pushed 'em down after I removed them from the oven. These are turning out to be the big hit of my holiday treat offerings this year. Everyon loves the crunch of the pretzel & the sweet/salty flavor, & baking with the pecan on top gives a slightly ttoasted flavor - very good & couldn't be easier!

These are simply amazing!  I just top mine with an additional snap pretzel for two reasons...first, it's cheaper!  Second, it adds more salt which is key here.  My husband is working late tonight and I am so afraid I'm going to eat the whole batch before he gets home!

I throw these into my holiday tins because they're always a crowd pleaser!  I buy the UTZ holiday pretzels shaped like trees, stars, and bells and everyone thinks its amazing how they look like real mini turtles.  I buy the candy "bar" rolos so you don't have to unwrap each individually- huge timesaver!  I normally make 100/batch and I always wish I had made more!

I toasted my pecans, used Snyders square pretzels and Rolo's.  Easier than making jello.  Hubby rates them a 6!

Thedr taste good; however they are not worth the price.

Bag of Dove chocolate caramels (35 pcs) $4.49
Bag of snyder's snap pretzels (216 pcs) $2.29
Bag of small pecans $2.29
Total = $9.07 
plus tax was about $10.

of course i do have leftover pretzels to eat but don't really need them. so for 35 squares, this is an expensive recipe..next time i think i will stick with turtles.

We love this recipe.  My husband thought we should try different candies so we tried a lot of variations on the turtle.  My favorite used Mars bar minis with pecan.  Try hershey Kisses with M&M's, Dove with pecans.  He wants to try peanut butter cups with reeses pieces next!  What a fun and easy recipe.  Oh, we filled a large cooke sheet which came out to about 45 at a time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made over 300 of these today for a large party.  Today was the first time I had ever made these turtles.  I used Dove chocolates filled with caramel.  My suggestions for 1st timers:  1)  Remove candies from wrappers a day or two before actually making the turtles.  2)  Toast pecans the day before also...don't skip this step...they taste so much better when the pecans are pre-toasted.  3) I tested different oven temps. and found 275 degrees at 3 minutes to be the best.  4) Place pecan on top of chocolate piece BEFORE placing in oven.  This way, when removed from heat, all you need to do is press down gently on each pecan.  5)  Be prepared to store these in a cool/cold garage-type area after making.  This is how they store best until consumed. 6)  If making in a hot/humid climate, you will need to refrigerate these to "set" and then keep them in refrigerator....otherwise, they will be too messy.  These turned out to be more expensive than I had originally planned.  Also, very labor intensive since I had to make so many and had no help.  Still, they are quite good to eat.  If you use Dove dark chocolate caramel  or Dove chocolate with peanut butter, less time will be needed in the oven......about 2 minutes.

Theses are wonderful, but for a change I use Reese's peanut butter cups, they have mini unwrapped cups, just fit. Then after I take them out of the oven while they are still warm, I put a green and red M and M on them. Fun and Christmasy.

As someone else suggested, I used the round pretzels with Rolos. After it's melted, I press a pecan on top of each one. It's a super quick, easy treat.

Ok, so I've made these twice in the past couple of weeks...YUM!! I did as others suggested and roasted the pecans with melted butter for about 10 mins...this is a must!! It really makes a difference in the flavor! Line your cookie sheet with foil, and carefully press the pecans in the pretzels because all the caramel will ooze out the back and make it difficult to remove them once cooled. Put in fridge for at least 30 mins...they are hard to chew when really cold, but taste wonderful when let set out a while at room temp. These last about a day in my house!!

These are so delicious and the easiest thing to make EVER! People loved these little treats! I could not find Dove chocolates and used Rolos. Update-Finally found the Dove chocolates and loved them even more. I have made these numerous times and they are going in a flash EVERY time!

This recipe is so SIMPLE. I love almonds and substitute them for the pecans. I also like to use the small square pretzels designed for dipping. The Rollos fit quite nicely on top of them.

Wow!  So easy and addictive.  I tried using the Dove caramel filled squares, but Rolos work much better since the caramel filling isn't as gooey. I made a ton of these and topped with fresh pecans, cocoa almonds, roasted almonds and cinnamon M&Ms. The cinnamon M&Ms were mine and my kids' favorite :)

Super easy recipe!  The hardest part was unwrapping each candy!  Read the reviews first and used square waffle pretzels & dove caramel candies.  I made 60-70 of these which meant using two bags of candy.  I also put the pecans on top before baking which made the recipe even easier.  I stored them in the garage (in December) until making up my Christmas cookie plates, which worked out well.  Thanks for the recipe.

Last year when I first made these, I decided to experiment with different types of chocolate covered caramels.  The ones that turned out best by far were the ones using Dove brand chocolate caramels.  In addition to fitting perfectly over the little square "waffle" pretzels, the chocolate was creamy and melted smoothly.  The ones using Rolos had more of a chalky and crumbly texture and didn't melt uniformly.  Of course they all tasted fantastic!  But the Rolos ones didn't look nice like the ones shown in the photo, which may be important if you're taking them to a party.

These are great! I made mine with both Caramilk Buttons and Hershey's Caramel Kisses. I liked the Kisses better because they had more caramel in them. I also tried a batch with some Hershey's Cherry Kisses I had in the house and they were pretty tasty too!! Quick and easy recipe to make, makes great gifts!

This is an absolutely AMAZING candy! I use square pretzels and caramel Dove chocolates; I also put the pecan on the chocolate before I bake them and then tap them to set them in place. I like the slight toast it gives to the nut.

These didn't work out for me.  I used the Dove caramels and baked them with the pecan on top.  It took 5 minutes in the oven before it was soft enough to push on the nut.  Then when I pushed it down the caramel squished out all over everything, making a sticky mess.  In the end I was left with a pretzel topped with a smashed and obviously purchased piece of candy on top of it. After they cooled some of the nuts fell off.  These are easy to make but not the effect I had hoped for. I decided not to add them to my holiday assortment.  Thought about sending them with my husband to work but decided they weren't worth 92 calories and threw them away.  I wouldn't make them again.

Taste wise it worked best with Dove Chocolate for me, you have to be careful not to press too hard into the chocolate or else all the Caramel Squeezes out. I also tried it with Riesen Caramel covered chocolate which worked better during the assembly phase but I don't care for how that kind sticks to my teeth.

These are fantastic. One of the things that makes them nice is that you can make any amount you wish in minutes. (If you are dieting, you don't need to have a lot of leftovers to temp you.) We are going to a play this evening with friends. One of the attendee is fixing dinner and asked me to bring dessert. Since most people do not want dessert immediately after dinner. I fixed a bag of rolos, giving me 59 pieces. I divided them into six decorative boxes and will wrap with ribbon. Each person will have his/her own box, and thus, can have a dessert right after dinner, during intermission at the play or tomorrow. I did something similar last month with different candies, and it was a big hit.

Awsome! I made these for an office party and it was a big hit. Everyone asked for the recipe. I used the waffle pretzel, Dove's chocolate carmels and assorted premium nuts: cashews, pecans, almonds, etc...  Also, before putting them in the oven, I topped each with the nuts .  This allow the nuts to slightly roast for a few mintues while the chocolate softened. Once again, Awsome!

These are really good considering how easy and fun they are to make.  The kids could easily make them.  Just be sure to watch closely.  I baked mine for 4 minutes and the caramel oozed out everywhere.  Next time I'll check them at 3 minutes.

I used Riesen Chocolate Caramel candies that resulted in "turtles" that were cute but not good to eat.  They were way too hard to eat - could have pulled a loose tooth out easily!

These not only taste delish but they are easy to make and they look store bought!  I made mine two ways: one with the "tie" pretzel and rolos and then I made a batch with the square "snaps" pretzel and Dove chocolate covered caramels.  The square with the Dove was much better quality and looked better as well...just BARELY press the pecan onto it because the caramel will ooze out!  I have already bought the ingredients to keep on hand so I can make these anytime. You will NOT be disappointed in these turtles. OH-- I also drizzled mine with white chocolate and that seemed to dress them up.

This was is such a wonderful little treat that takes no time at all to make.  I had to hide them from my husband because I made about 3 times the size of this batch to bring to a large gathering.  They were the first thing gone!  I used both rolos and the caramel kisses to see which would work better and I have to say I will only use rolos from now on.  They aren't as messy.  Also, for some of the treats I substituted M&M's for the pecans.  They were very good and colorful too!  I will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe about three times now over the Christmas and New Year Holidays and everyone loves it! It is so easy to make and it turns out great every time. I took suggestions from other reviewers and toasted my pecans with a little butter in the oven for a few minutes. I also used the dove caramel chocolates instead of the rolo's then popped back in the oven for a couple of minutes. They turned out wonderful will use this recipe many more times :)

Oh my - way too good!  We did a taste test with Rolo and Dove Caramels and preferred the Dove.  Agree with earlier reviewer that said unwrapping the foil is the hardest part of the recipe!

These were mouthwateringly good.  My husband devoured them in a minute.  I used the little waffle style pretzels and Hershey's Bliss dark chocolate caramel.  So easy and so good.  I'm taking them to two different parties this weekend.

These are almost too easy. The most time consuming part is unwrapping the candy. I popped the candy topped pretzels in the oven, took them out as directed 4 minutes later and pressed a pecan on top of each one. They are delicious. Crunchy, salty, sweet. YUM!

I didn't have the Rollo or Dove candies so I used ordinary caramel candies, cut them in half lengthwise, and pressed four Ghiradelli double chocolate chips (extra large) into the caramel halves (upside down so the flat bottoms were on top). Bakes three minutes and topped them with pecans. Worked like a charm. It fit perfectly on the mini-pretzels, look cute (four loops of chocolate around the pecan), and taste great.

You're going to need a lot more rollos, pretzels, and pecans! These are so good & are gone in the blink of an eye at any gathering.  They do take a while to cool, so be sure to have a space ready in your fridge or freezer for them & make them at least 24-48 hours in advance.

I made these at Christmas and gave them as gifts to my neighbors. Everyone raved about them and asked for more. I had a hard time making enough to give away because I kept eating them.

Love this recipe!!  So easy and absolutely delicious!  The salty pretzel with the creamy caramel and chocolate is a perfect combo.  I make this year round but especially during the holidays.  They make perfect homemade gifts for teachers!  Thanks!

SO easy and absolutely WONDERFUL! I doubled the recipe for the eight women in attendance at my bookclub and out of the 40 it made, all but 5 were gone! I used Rolos on square pretzels.  Everyone raved over them!

I should knock this rating down a few stars for what these delectable little treats are doing to my hips!  Although not much of a sweet lover, I cannot stop eating these.  I used the Rold Gold round butter mini pretzels and toasted the pecans in the heated oven before putting in the pretzels.  These turtles are so easy and everyone seems to love them.  Thankfully I used the entire bag of rolos and would have been devastated had I only made 20.  The recipe calls for 20 pretzels for 20 servings but nobody is going to stop at just one!

I recently decided to switch the candies for caramels, and I don't recommend it!  The caramels were too hard once they cooled.  However, I have tried the recipe again, following it to a T, and they were awesome!  Yummy and super easy!!!

These are so easy and SO GOOD!  The entire family loved them.  I made 1 batch with glazed pecans and another batch with red & green peanut M&M's on top.  They were the first thing to be eaten from our Christmas Eve snack table.

You must make this!  It is so easy and so impressive.  I drizzled them with white chocolate that I colored red and green for Christmas and brought them to a party.  I heard friends commenting it was the best thing there!  I used the square snap pretzels and of course toasting your pecans is a must. Everyone always wants to know how did you get the caramel in the middle?? So fun!!

Here is another 5 star review for this fantastic recipe.  I used a number of the reviews recommendations:  square pretzels, Dove chocolates filled with caramel, toasted the pecans after tossing them in a little butter.  I also drizzled a little semi-sweet chocolate on top for a beautiful finishing touch.  My husband took these to a New Year's Eve party and even though there was too much food and tons of left overs, every one of these babies got eaten!!  There are the  perfect bite size treat.....sweet, salty, chocolate....perfection!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Holy smokes are these good. I tried these with Rolos and then with caramel filled Hershey Kisses. I think both are good but the Hershey Kisses are better.

Update: the first time I made these, They were a disaster for me.  I used square pretzels with rolos and balanced a half pecan on top of each one.  4 minutes later I had a melted gooey mess on my tray.  They all stuck to the paper and could not be peeled off without taking pieces of paper with the pretzel. Unfortunately, they could not be saved. :(   This time, I did exactly the same thing but removed the pretzels from the oven at exactly 3 minutes. I pressed the pecan on top and allowed them to cool.  Perfect!  So, watch the time.

As if this delicious recipe could be any easier; In Walmart, there is a package of about 50 UNWRAPPED Rollos on the candy isle in the grocery part of the store.  I also loved the sweet-savory yummyness created with a sprinkle of sea salt when they are still warm.  GREAT recipe. 

Senkuveddymucho!

These were sooo simple and so addictive! I took other people's advice and coated the pecans in butter and a little sugar and then I roasted them for 10min at 325. It made these candies extra scrumptious!

These are so yummy!  Perfect combination of salty and sweet.  I agree with a previous review, the "hardest" part is opening the rolos one at a time.  I will say that it's also difficult not eating them immediately!  :-)  Super easy to make, this could be a great thing to do with you kids.

I first had these at a BBQ, some were made with the pecan on top, others with another pretzel pressed into the top instead of the nut. Very good and very easy. Not sure why this recipe came up when I asked for low fat recipes as NO ONE is going to eat just one (recipe's nutritional info is for one turtle.)

WOW! Doesn't get much easier or tastier... I bet I made 10 batches this past holiday season and everyone loved them. I agree... the hardest part is taking the foil off the Rolo's!

I made these to bring into my office for Christmas and to put in little Christmas tins as gifts for some people. They were a huge hit and are soooo easy to make! I ended up having to make many batches of these because my boyfriend and I ate a whole batch by ourselves, and everyone else was asking for seconds and raving about them.

These are so great and very quick/easy to do! I doubled the recipe and am glad I did as they disappeared quickly. I used the small square pretzels and rolo's. I also drizzled caramel over the tops for extra appeal.

Super fast, super easy, SUPER delish!! These have become a Christmas candy favorite in my family. I use Diamond brand glazed pecan halves, which are a treat by themselves, but really add just a little extra oomph to this chocolately, gooey goodness!

I have been making these for Christmas for the past several years. I lower my oven to 250 and they are perfectly melted in 4 mins. I top mine with toasted pecans and plain and peanut M&M's. We live in the Northeast so I keep them in a zip lock back in the cool garage and they last throughout the Christmas and New Year holidays. I use a generic square pretzel and Rolo candy... and make a lot...they are always a hit!

These are addicting!!!! I've eaten them a few times but have never made them. So easy!!! I used the Snyder's Snap Pretzels. On the Rolo bag it suggested putting on another pretzel instead of the nut. I did those on a few since I have a coworker who doesn't like nuts. We'll see how she likes them.

Perfect for the grands to hellp with.  They loved unwraping the candies.  We waited for the pan to cool, then the kids topped with nuts of their choosing (they actually liked putting another pretzel on top best).  I like putting salted peanuts best.  Love this recipe!

Just started making these.  What a major hit they are.  I put them on a tray with assorted homemade cookies & made them with almonds, walnuts & pecans (roasted for a few minutes) so friends could chose the nut they wanted.  Most people ended up trying all the varieties.  I agree that you should make plenty.  I put them in a cookie tin & they stayed fresh for a week, so I had plenty to nibble on for days.  Ridiculously easy to make, too!

These are so delicious! I actually substituted a whole cashew on top of each candy.  So easy! Don't push too hard when applying your nut of choice, as the caramel will seep out of the chocolate candy.

More yummy and pretty when you use white chocolate covered pretzels instead of plain.  Toasted my pecans and with kids in mind, did some topped with M & M's too.

These are awesome. They taste good and are so easy to make. I followed the suggestion of a previous poster and put the pecan half on top of the rolo prior to placing the baking sheet in the oven. So easy. Thank you for sharing.

I was quite surprised by how average these tasted. After all of the reviews, I expected more. I love salty/sweet combinations, but these just didn't do it for me. They were simply okay. I probably won't make them again. However, having said that, if you are looking for a very quick and easy candy, these are right on the money for that purpose!

So easy - everyone loves these! I made two large batches. I used up my bag of pecans on the first batch, so I used broken pretzels on the second batch. Both worked well and tasted great. I used square pretzels that were labeled Waffle Pretzels. 
The other reveiwers are right, cooling these in the fridge makes a huge difference!

Super easy.  I stacked the pretzel (waffle type) rollo (I purchased the rolls to save time) and pecan as many as would fit on my cookie sheet and baked just 3-5 mins.  The heat lightly toasted the pecan and the turtles were complete in less than 15 mins start to finish.  YUMMY!

My son and I have been making these together ever since we found the recipe a couple of years ago! They are fantastic time and time again. He has taken them to school for snack day, they're a favorite snack at family gatherings, and we always make a huge batch for Thanksgiving and Christmas. :)

Delicious and sooo easy to make!  I used mini pretzel twists and ROLO chocolate.  I put the unsalted pecan half on top of the chocolate before baking to toast the pecan a little.  I only baked for 3 min.  PERFECT!!!

Easy and delicious! I've made them twice and all disappeared in about 20 minutes. I might try putting a blob of peanut butter on top of the Rolo before putting the pecan on next time.

I couldn't keep these in the house this Christmas! I used Dove chocolate caramels (couldn't find Rolos after the 1st batch) with even BETTER results. Reduce cooking time to 3 minutes, though, as these are thinner than Rolos.

We did this during a Girl Scout meeting with 9-11 year olds.  It was simple enough for all of them to do on their own, once we got the microwave timing figured out.  Dove Caramel chocolates were perfect for the square pretzels.

These are okay. From the pecan package, I made an egg white mixture and toasted the nuts first. May or may not make them again. They are not easy to handle, but perhaps I might make them again if I used two jellyroll type pans and after cooling a bit, transferred them to the fridge to harden.

This has to be the world's fastest, easiest treat!  I took 6 dozen of these to a party last night and they were GONE in a f-l-a-s-h!  We had no problems with them being too squishy.  If your oven is spot on for temps the caramels are still in perfect shape when you pull them from the oven.  We had used "Rold Gold Buttered Checker" pretzels.  They were the perfect size!  MY BIGGEST TIP?  Make them early in the day!  While super easy to make, we ended up having to pop them into the freezer on cookie sheets to get the chocolate to set up faster (so we could transport them). Also... try putting a salted cashew on top of some. We used both types of nuts and I swear... this turtle was near "Sees Candy" deeeeelish!    Thank you CACKI!!
ADDED: Tried Rolos on the second batch and they were perfect too!  I prefer milk chocolate so the Rolos were IT for me!

So simple and so so good!  I found wagon wheel pretzels made by Utz and they were the perfect shape.  I've used Rolos and Dove with good results both times, but I have some thoughts:  I found that the Rolos actually work a little bit better since they are a little smaller.  They squish and spread out a little bit more neatly when you put the pecan on top.  The Dove chocolate caramels were delicious, but a bit too big for the pretzels.  There was some definite oozy squish-out of the caramel when I used the Dove, but not with the Rolos.  I tried lowering the oven temp. to 275 for the Dove, but still had the same problem with the leaking caramel.  If you don't care about looks/presentation, then go with either one.  If you want them to be neater, use Rolos.  Either way, delicious and addictive!

Wow, great presentation, tastes wonderful, and soooooo EASY to make.  I used Dove caramel milk chocolate Promises.  I'd give this a 10 if I could!

So simple...so delicious!  If you prefer dark chocolate, try the chocolate caramels called "Riesen."  Unbelievable!

I played around with this thinking "real turtles don't have pretzels".  So I did some with and some without, I'll definitely be sticking with the recipe on this one.  I found some butter flavored pretzels and they add so much flavor to the candy it's not worth leaving out.

Awesome and quick!  I followed some of the other comments and used the waffle square pretzels, Dove chocolate carmels and whole pecans.  Love this recipe!

Made these at Christmas and gave as gifts in food baskets.  This is really nice and alternative way for me to make these than the traditional melting chocolate for molds.  Very simple and good.

These are amazing!  I can not tell you how easy these are to make.  Unwrapping the rolos (and not eating them in the process) is the hardest part!  I would caution users to watch them in the oven because my oven at 300 degrees for 4 minutes melted these too much.  I have switched to 200 degrees since then.  These are great when you need a sweet treat in a pinch!

These have always been a big hit until I started using 'Nilla Wafers instead of pretzels-- much better in every way. I turn the wafer upside-down and the chocolate seems to stick better. The texture is better than a pretzel, and the overall taste is better. I'll never go back to pretzels!

These are good using the round pretzels and then instead of a pecan, stick an M&M on top.

Made these a few days ago using Dove candies.  Instead of using whole pecans, I sprinkled coarsly chopped pecans on the tops before baking and carefully pressed in afterwards.  It's a personal preference thing; I think it looks nicer.  The taste is awsome!

this has to be the best and fastiest to make and eat. just plain yummy. i did do some things different. some i made with  the square snap pretzel toped with rolo and a reg. nut. the next one was a snap with a kisses with almond topped with a red M&M. the next one was for the ones who do not like nuts at all. it was plain kisses and topped it with green M&M . everyone is going crazy with it. i drizzled white almond bark with crisco added to make it thin to drizzle over some of them. rolos were easier to use cause the nut or M&M sat ontop easier. the kisses kinda went to the side sometimes. my 9 yr. old granddaughter and i had so much fun doing them. we want to try cashews next time. i put them in the freezer for about 10 min. or refrig. for the same time. put them in a container and put a piece of wax paper between each layer so they wont stick together before making them gifts. good luck and have fun. hope this helped

This was extremely easy and delicious. I won the candy portion of a contest at work with this one. Here is what I did...I doubled the recipe, used square pretzels and Rolo candies, topped with a pecan before baking for 3 minutes, smashed down gently as soon as I removed them from the oven and drizzled with white chocolate after they were cooled.

Fantastic! Easy to make! I toasted my pecans with a little butter 325 for 15 min first. I then followed the directions. I added a milk chocolate drizzle over the top after they had been in the fridge for an hour or so. I did this by melting milk choc chips in the microwave then placing the liquid with a tsp of vegetable oil in a ziploc bag. I then cut the corner ( very small cut) to drizzle over the turtles. It turned out so pretty. I refrigerated until all was set up them bagged for friends!

Incredible.  Read all of the reviews first and they were helpful, but this is so easy, you can't really mess it up.  I used part Rolos and part Hershey Kisses with Carmel.  My neighbor liked the Kisses since they are not as "chocolity" as the Rolos.  My Grandson ate the first batch and finished 4 more on the way to the neighbors with a plate.  Good thing she only lives 25 feet away.  Will use this one often for church and other functions.  Thanks!!

These are great!  I tried both Rolos and Dove caramels.  The Dove caramels are creamier, but the caramel spills out when you press the nut in.  The Rolos are much neater and my husband (a turtle expert!) said he liked them better because they were chewier.  Try both and see which you prefer!

Fast, I tried this in the microwave, 12 seconds....What a dream. Also, let them cool then dipped them in melted milk chocolate, let that cool then drizzle tiny strips of white chocolate. A Chocoholics Wet Dream. So easy, I did it in the microwave. YUMMO!

OMG these are amazing.  I love the candies and saw this recipe...thought "why not".  Seriously the fact that it took me less than 15 minutes from start to finish is dangerous because I know I will make these all the time.  I am going to make sure I keep this on file for Christmas gifts.  Thanks for the post.

Very good for such a simple recipe and what... 3 ingredients & 10 minutes for prep & cooking? Not bad at all. The most time consuming thing was unwrapping the chocolates.  I used the checkerboard pretzels, and a dove chocolate fits PERFECTLY on them. I tried the rolos, too.  Liked the caramel in the rolo, but the creaminess and presentation with the dove chocolate was hands down better. Will use the dove chocolates with caramel next time.  Oh, and used a roasted salted whole almond instead of pecans. A double batch was gone in under 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

This is yummy. I used DOVE chocolate filled with caramel and it was great..Then I made it again today and rather than pecans halves, I used almond slivers..and it was wonderful too. This is so easy..and everyone is always impressed!

I used great value brand caramel chocolates, which taste like  on their own but worked perfectly in this recipe. I used others suggestions to just put pecans on top while baking and then just pushed them into the softened chocolate when I took them out. Used waffle pretzels too which made it super easy with no mess.

Made these two Christmases ago, and everybody loved them!
Only thing is, I want to know if you can make these with walnuts,
as I know someone in my family who's allergic/sensitive to the pecans.
But I am thinking if I should make them again.
Oh so good...

Super easy! Totally kid friendly treat for them to help make. My daughter made the 1st batch with ease and then I made a 2nd batch. Went over so well, and super fast. We used Rolo(R) candies and not the caramel chocolate Kisses. I'd make these again and again. SO yummy!! And addictive.

Easy and amazing!  Grid pretzels are best, but mini-pretzels will substitute in a pinch.  I used the Dove caramels instead of Rolos because I prefer the taste/texture of Dove.  Also, I followed the advice of several other reviewers and baked the pecan on top of the chocolate, then lightly pressed it down when I took the turtles from the oven.  These were a HUGE hit at several holiday celebrations.  These are too easy not to try at least once.

OMG! Delicious! I toasted the pecans (since mine were not fresh) in the oven for 8 mins.; 4 mins. on each side at 350 degrees. No need for additional butter or cooking spray, the natural oils are enough for the toasting process but watch closely to avoid burnt pecans--YUCK! Immediately remove from the oven and cool on paper towels. Meanwhile, lay the preztels and rolos on the parchment paper. Bake 4 minutes. Perfection! Press the roasted pecan on top. If you use the regular shaped preztels, it will resemble a turtle unlike the squared or round pretzels. I followed the recipe and everyone thought they were cute and Delicious! A keeper! Thanks for sharing!

A huge hit! I made 50 and they were gone in a blink at a small gathering (20 people). I toasted and lightly salted the pecans before using them.  This was super easy and a really yummy "no bake" (ok, so you melt, but not really bake) dessert!

Easy to make! Put the pecan on top before baking and pressed in after they baked. Used both werther's and a PC caramel cup and I personally liked the caramel cup better as there was more chocolate.

This taste combination just doesn't work for me. The salty pretzel seems the culprit.  To each their own, but with all the glowing reviews I made several batches with slight variations.  In the end, I'll just have to respectfully disagree with y'all.

My kids don't like nuts, so I skip the pecan and cover melted rolo with another pretzel.   I had teenagers ask for the recipe because they  loved them so much!

The hardest part is FINDING the Rolo candy!!! Next year I'll stock up early :)  If you do these in the microwave experiment with your microwave - mine only took about 12 seconds to melt the chocolate.  Be sure you don't touch the caramel if it melts out of the candy (OUCH!!!).

very easy and good flavor but 4 minutes at 300 is too long for my oven.  next time I'll try a lower temp and 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.

I hate to be the "odd man out" but these were just ok.  They were very easy and very cute using Christmas themed pretzels but the taste was nothing to write home about.  I LOVE pretzels, I LOVE Rolos, and I LOVE pecans; how could I not LOVE these?

It is hard to make enough when the family gets together.  I follow the directions except I use the Microwave instead of the oven.  Use a microwave safe plate. My microwave melts 28 Rolo's in 26 seconds. I started at 20 sec. and worked up until I reached the correct melt point for 28 pretzel's. I get about 55 to 60 from a bag of Rolo's.

Easy and delicious--what more could you want?  I used square pretzels (not as much chocolate comes through on the bottom), and toasted the pecans for 4 minutes to give them more flavor.  I had pounds of pecans from a friend's tree, and this was one of the ways to use them.

These were insanely easy to make and they were ok but I just don't think they were my cup of tea.  I used milk duds and with one candy on the pretzel it just seemed too "pretzely" and not candy enough but when I used two candies they got too chewy.  for my tastes I would give it three stars but that is just my palate not the recipe.

Absolutely fantastic! As per other reviews I used Rolo chocolates and drizzled melted chocolate over the top. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of white chocolate. They look and taste wonderful. I also did half with walnuts instead of pecans. They turned out fabulous too!!

I cut the Rolos in 1/2 (caramel side down)  so it wasn't so bulky.

Made as part of a holiday tray for the officers at my officer friend's prison on Christmas. All the guys fought over them and have asked for them to be on every sweets tray.

Quick to make and these taste great, but are SO messy! Too messy to serve at a party... every time I picked one up I got sticky caramel and chocolate all over my hands. I won't make these again.

Wow. These were so easy and tasty! I could not find Rollos, so I used Riesen candies instead. I used small square pretzels and they worked beautifully. Everything was a perfect fit. The timing was right on the mark, too. I did not have parchment paper, so I used individual foil-lined mini baking cups. It reminded me of the way chocolate candies come in boxes and looked very festive and special. I doubled the recipe and only baked one tray at a time to make sure the chocolate was still soft enough to press the pecan halves into. Since the baking time is not much at all, this was no problem. Thank you so much for this easy and wonderful recipe! UPDATE: I tried using the Dove candies as so many had suggested, but they never quite hardened again. Even after I was forced to refrigerate them, the chocolate was very soft and stuck to the other pieces. The Dove has a great taste, but I will continue to use the Riesen candy when making large batches.

These are exceptional!  I used square pretzels, Dove caramel chocolates, and toasted my pecans for about 5 minutes by themselves before using them.  I was afraid the caramel centers in the Dove chocolates might not do well since it is a softer caramel than Rolos, which a lot of reviewers used.  If you use Dove, don't leave them in the oven more than 3 minutes, and press the pecans into the chocolate just slightly so the caramel doesn't ooze out.  Mine firmed up nicely and packaged well.  Delicious!

very good, however, i used dove chocolates with caramel and i baked for 3 minutes at 300 and they got way too soft and all the caramel ran out and got all over the pan. maybe my oven is hot or that kind of chocolate is too soft but next time i will try another kind of chocolate and cook for 1 minute at a time. And also, you will need to put directly in the freezer from the oven because the chocolate will continue to melt and spill over making the chocolates not  very pretty.

Excellent easy and fun! I used Rollos and the very small square pretzels. I also put them on a piece of parchment paper before cooking them.  If you don't want to have to unwrap every Rollo buy the Rollo candy bars. I took the advice of someone else and toasted the pecans first for 6 minutes on 325 then I stacked the pretzel, rollo and pecan and baked them at 325 for 4 minutes. When you take them out of the oven all you have to do is use 2 forks one to hold the piece and one to smash in the pecan. I also melted white chocolate in the microwave for 45 seconds and drizzled it on top and they look great! Take them out as soon as any Rollo looks like it is melted. They need to cool completely before you try to move them for the chocolate to set.  I tried the Hershey bar with carmel inside but the carmel is too soft and ran out all over the pan before I even put them in the oven. You really need the miniature pretzels - the Rold Gold tiny ones are too big.  I may try some with Milk Duds next...

Very easy to make, it takes more time to unwrap the candies than to bake!!I made these with the dove candies with caramel, they would also be really good with the peanut butter ones. Definitely toast the pecans.... a must!! I made them with un-toasted ones first and regretted it! Toasting the nuts gives them a great flavor! Also I have to agree that the squared pretzels from Schneiders matches perfectly with the dove chocolate selections. ( A tad more salt may be a bit more tasty for some... those who like salts more than sweets like me... the square pretzels aren't so salty!!) Great recipe thank you for sharing!!

I made this for my office mates and they loved it.  One of them made it the next night to bring to a party.  I have emailed and printed this recipe several times since I made them,! I used square pretzels with a rolo on top.  I also added the pecan before I baked it.  I melted bakers white choc. in microwave for 30 sec. incriments.  I added a touch of oil to make sure it didnt clump before i sprinkled on top.  Once i pushed down on the pecan, I drizzled the white choc. on top using a spoon in a side to side motion making the presentation perfect.  I made some without the pecans just in case, but I will put them on all next time.  Everyone was picking for the ones with the nuts.  Great recipe!

So easy to make... my 5 yr old and my 2 yr old made them! My 2 year old did the pretzels and caramels, I put them in the oven, and my 5 yr old did the pecans (would have been too hot for my 2 yr old). I used rollos and 3 minutes is enough time to melt perfectly at 300 degrees. I stuck the tray in the fridge to cool down from the oven, and then when i took them out of the fridge, I banged the tray on the counter to loosen them and put them in a baggie. Big time hit, and a great sweet and salty snack.

A new tradition for our home!  So Good and easy, I may find my husband making these in the microwave in the future.   I have had to make these 4 times in the last 3 days.  I used the original rolo candies on them the first time, then wanted to try caramel filled doves, but the grocer was out of them so I used the carmel filled Hersheys Kisses and found them to be awesome.  The rolos make them more like a traditional chewy turtle, while the softer caramel candies make them melt in your mouth.  both are very good.  I also toasted my pecans first by putting them on the cookie sheet in the oven while it was preheating.  The only think I really noticed is not to make too many in a batch because it takes too long to put them on the tops and they start to cool. So maybe only do the original 20 at a time.  I used traditional knotted pretzels for this and they worked fine.

LOVE making this candy. It is so easy.  The hardest part is unwrapping all of the Rolos.  I would HIGHLY suggest toasting the pecans in a small amount of butter....this makes them so much better.  Just put them in a pan on low and turn them alot so they don't over toast.  Everybody loves these...I have made them for three years and just never got around to a review.  Also, I use the square butter snaps and they turn out well with these.

Combined advice from previous reviewers: unwrapped candy night before; used grid "snap" pretzels;  put nuts on before oven and  pressed down when they came out; used rolos (vs Dove) and comes out just fine, taste awesome; drizzled with white chocolate; didn't have time to toast the nuts ahead of time and they are still delish! So FAST and EASY even my 4 year old helped "stack the rolo towers." Made for gifts using 40oz bucket of pretzels, 2# pecans, 10 bags of rolos(50ish per bag). Made about 500 or more and still have pretzels left.

The suggestion to drizzle melted white chocolate chips over the finished product was a good one. I just drizzled the white c. chips with a spoon rather than putting it in a bag and cutting the corner. I also used the leftover melted white chips to make some chocolate covered pretzels.

This recipe is so quick and easy and, not to mention, delicious!  I use Rolo candies and bake at 275 for 4 minutes.  I sometimes use peanut M&Ms in place of the pecan halves as they add seasonal colors during the Holidays, while keeping a nutty crunch.  These turtles make a great gift ~ put some in a cellophane bag with a ribbon ~ attach the recipe to if you wish.

These are a HUGE hit!!! All i ever hear now is "can i have some more of those candy things please?"  They are quick and easy to make by the dozens.  The only modification i make is baking them with the pecans for about 4 1/2 mins then pressing them carefully so they dont ooze caramel. I also add a candy drizzle (1/2 cup white vanilla chips, 1 tbl spoon shortening melted on low) to make them pretty and add a little something extra.  Youll definately need to make a lot!

I would like to weigh in on the suggestion to use Hersey's carmel kisses instead of Rolos- I've tried this recipe both ways and the Rolos are by far the better way to go. They are bigger and more carmel-y so they fill the top of the pretzel and you get more of the chocolate flavor when you eat them.

these are easy and quick. after reading reviews i decided to put the pecan on top of the rolo and pop it all in the oven. well i won't do that again. the chocolate melted quickly on the top which caused the pecan to slowly slide off. i had to re-assemble all pecans after taking them out of the oven. next time i will toast the pecans and wait till the pan comes out of the oven. but still delicious! a keeper!

These are simply the best! I changed the pecans for marschino cherries on some of them for those in my family with nut allergies (and picky kids). They disappeared so quick that I had to make more before the guests arrived! Lucky for me they are so quick and easy to make. Definately make these using the Dove brand chocolate carmels and the square pretzels. They make such a pretty and neat pair. Great Recipe!

This is easy, but really not very good with basic ingredients.  I used Rolos and I would not recommend them.  The chocolate part tasted really cheap and the pretzels were a strange texture (which might be tolerated if the chocolate/caramel part was good).  I may try it again with Dove Chocolate Caramels sometime, and will also toast the pecans first if I make this recipe again.

We loved these!  So easy to make.  After about 1/2 hour of cooling they seemed too sticky so I put them in the fridge.  They were perfect.  Love the salty and sweet taste.

SO EASY and SO YUMMY!  The hardest part was unwrapping the Rolos.  I followed the recipe as stated, except I made a whole lot more than 20.  :)  I used unsalted mini pretzels.  The chocolate does melt through the holes of the pretzel but I think that mixes the chocolate and pretzel tastes together better.  I put them in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes to harden and they came right off the parchment paper with no problem.  Will definitely make these again!

These are so tasty and easy to make!!  I used mini caramilk squares (couldn't find Dove caramels) and they turned out awesome on top of square pretzels.  I also toasted my pecans (at 325 for 8 minutes) prior to placing them on top as other reviews have recommended.  Definately a new Christmas favorite!

Awesome treat!  Fast, easy and a favorite of my family and everyone.  I used regular mini twists and they fit perfectly.  Took other reviewers advice and roasted the pecans first at 325 degrees for about 10 mins.  Then I drizzled them with some white almond bark that I melted in the microwave and used a plastic bag with a corner cut out to drizzle it on.  Worked great!

I used Rolos (tubes so I didn't have to do a lot of unwrapping) and put toasted pecans on half the turtles and cashews on the other half. I used the square salted pretzels. These were super easy to make and very delicious. Took them to a party and brought home an empty Tupperware. Will definitely make again!

These are just amazing! I have used this recipe twice, once with regular snap pretzels and once with butter snaps. The butter snaps made the overall flavor much more delightful.. I mean, is there a better match that butter + pecan? I highly recommend using the butter flavored. Also, I prefer the dove candies which are a little more 'presentable' because they keep their shape and look less squished.

These we awesome!  I couldn't find the snap/square pretzels, so I used regular round pretzels and Rolos.  I topped with another pretzel instead of a pecan because I didn't have pecans available and the people I was making them for didn't like pecans.

I made these with my 6yo--actually, he made them.  I just put in/took out of the oven.  I bought tubes of Rolos to avoid unwrapping each.  Cooked for 3min, and had fun experimenting with layers:  Pretzel, rolo, pretzel, pecan.  We also did pretzel, rolo, pecan peanut butter, pretzel--that tasted like a Take5! YUM YUM.

These are such a great and simple treat!  You can do so many different variations with them as well. For these I used caramel hershey kisses. My favorite during the holidays is candy cane kisses topped with a mnm...so cute!  I also like using the waffle pretzels the best but the twists work as well.

Yummy and so easy to make!  My 8 year old helped make them and eat them!  We used Rold Gold Holiday shaped pretzels.  The trees, bells & stars worked well.  I toasted my pecans like another reviewer suggested and they were delicious.  Will definitely save this one to make again!

WOW!  I just finished making these for a baking exchange and it's a good thing I made more becuase they wouldn't last otherwise!!!  I bought the bags of mini rolos because I couldn't find the big ones and they worked out great.  Got the square waffle pretzels from Superstore and put 2 mini rolos per pretzel.  Melted some white chocolate wafers in a baggie and drizzled it over top of them when done.  THESE ARE SOOOOO GOOD!!!!

Wow, these are addictive little nuggets!  They taste like turtle candies, but with the added crunch of the pretzel.  We'll definitely make these again!  It would also be easy enough to make your own turtle candies with the Rolo caramels -- two pecan halves on the bottom, a Rolo in the middle to glue it all together, and another pecan on top.

What an awesome and easy sweet snack! Definitely go for the square pretzels they work perfectly. Also instead of using Rolos, for some reason I didn't think of them at the time, I used Milk Duds which worked out even better than If I had used the Rolos

I made them topped with Rolo and Hershey Kisses with caramel.  The Rolo candy worked the best.  You can also replace the pecan with another pretzel.

Been making these for years!  I usually use round mini-pretzels, but one year I couldn't find them so I used the pretzel squares and that worked just fine.  I always use Rollos for my chocolate covered caramels.  The kids love to make them and everyone loves to eat them!

I was really excited to make these but wasn't as thrilled eating them. My chocolate pretzel ratio was off.

So easy to make and delicious!  I wasn't sure which chocolates would work better, so I tried both Rolos and Dove caramels and they both worked great. I preferred the texture and overall look of the Rolos though.  I used Synder's of Hanover "Snaps" (square pretzels).   I made these for a bake sale, packaged a dozen each into some nice festive bags, and they were the first items sold!

I cooked it at 350 for 5 minutes, used Rolo's & they turned out perfect!  I probably should mention I made an entire cookie sheet full, as I knew 20 wouldn't be enough!

I made these last year using Rollo's but they ended up being expensive and quite sweet.  I made them again this morning and used Milk Duds instead.  It gave a better balance between the salty and the sweet and per serving, ended up saving me some money.  Delicious and addictive.

Oh, I love these little treats! I use Rolo's and waffle type pretzels and they always turn out perfectly! Super simple, super delicious!! One thing that is important is to simply keep a good eye on them while they are in the oven. 4 minutes is an estimate at best. Yours might be done much sooner, so just watch and take them out as soon as they look soft and slightly gooey. And don't just limit yourself to pecans. Any nut works well. I have made these with pecans, cashews, walnuts, hazelnuts and even sliced almonds.

Very easy to make.  I had 125 made within 30 minutes.  I toasted the pecans at 275° for 5 minutes.  As the pecans were toasting I placed the mini pretzel and mini rolo on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet.  Popped the cookie sheet in the oven
 for 2 minutes and then lightly pressed the pecan on the pretzel.  I only placed one cookie sheet in the oven at a time as I wanted to put the pecans on the pretzel before they cooled down too much.  Each cookie sheet had about 30 pieces, and that gave me enough time to place the pecan on top before the next batch came out of the oven.  I then let them cool for about 1 hour then placed then in an air tight container, with wax paper between each layer.  One reviewer mentioned the cost per piece.  To cut the cost I used my local dollarama store and bought a bag of mini pretzel ($1.25 for 454gms) I used half a bag and mini rolo candy ($2.00 for 130grams)  I used 2 bags of candy.  The expense is with using the pecans.  I used the mini size as I have made these treats for my small grand children.

These were so great! I loved the caramel, chocolate, and salt taste combo. They work well with rolos or dove caramel chocolates. Roasting the pecans for about 6 minutes before putting the pretzels in helped bring out their flavor. The hardest part was trying to stop everyone from eating them all before the party!

Just made a test batch, they passed...I give them an A+. So delicious and easy to make, I followed the recipe as written using Rolo's. Does anyone know how well they freeze?...I want to start working on my Christmas goodies so I am looking for special recipes that freeze well.

These are soo good! The caramel with the pecan and pretzel was awesome. I bought the mini square pretzels and they worked great. I am testing out quick sweet holiday ideas. If you can't find the rolo bags, the ones in the candy isle have 8 each in them. These are actually pretty too. Only thing was, I wasn't sure how long to wait before moving them off the pan and know the chocolate was set. I will have to figure that out for the next time! TY

As marshmay suggested, I kept this easy.

I drizzled pecan halves with butter, lightly sprinkled with sea salt and baked for about 4 minutes.  Then I stacked small pretzels, Riesen chocalate caramels, and the still-warm pecans.  Back into the oven for 3 minutes, out again and I quickly pressed the pecans to spread the caramel, then into the freezer for a fast cool down.  Truly couldn't have been easier!
Just tasted my first and have to say that it was scrumptious.

These are great! If you use the square pretzels (like Snaps by Snyders) make sure you pick up the original! I accidentally picked up the butter flavored one, which I'm not a fan of, but other than that, it's still pretty good! Also pecan halves were so expensive when I checked! I opted for chopped pecans which were a third of the price and worked just as well :)

These are really simple and super fun to make.  You can get the kids involved as well.  Go ahead and make double.  Just be sure to store them in an airtight container or bag.  Also don't put them near hot dishes as they can remelt and slide around.  Enjoy!

A family favorite!  We microwave our turtles on a flat plate for under 30 seconds.  I have also used peanut butter M&M's instead of pecans and had RAVE reviews.  Kids can easily help with this one. Enjoy!

This is one of our family staples for the holidays.  I make it with my young nieces so they can help.  I sometimes use the square, waffle-type of pretzels intead of the mini twisty pretzels.  Delicious!!!

Have made these in the past with Rolos - so easy.  Today I've taken the suggestion of several posters and am using the Syyders of Hanover square butter pretzels with Dove caramel candies, and instead of the pecan I'm putting a candy corn on the top of half of them for Halloween.  I tried putting both on a few but think it looks better with just one.  
They taste great.  However, even after refrigerating them caramel has oozed out of the sides of many - I'm sure because the Dove candy is larger than the Rolo.  Not a great problem, just makes them a little stickier and messy.

These were good. I used small twisted pretzels w/ DOVE caramel chocolates and toasted pecans. The only complaint would be that I had to keep them refigerated to keep them from being too soft and melty!

I have been making these for years, at  Christmas time I make these with the holiday shaped pretzels and for the kids I put a red or green m&m on top instead of the pecan. I can never make enough everyone loves these

very delicious-would definitely double or even triple the recipe if you plan on making it for guests. ONLY do 3 min in the oven. I did for and because they stay on the hot tray as you are putting on pecans, he chocolates continue to melt and some of mine melted way to much and became a mess and devoured the pretzel making it not look so nice-i also toasted my peacans

Since so many people had rave reviews, we made a ton of these as gifts for Valentine's day.  I was extremely disappointed, and couldn't give them out.  I used Rolos, and the chocolate stayed moist and sticky.  There was no good way to pack them nicely, since the chocolate stuck to everything.  The kids picked off the pecans and ate the Rolos off of the pretzel.  They tasted O.K. to me, but not fabulous.  I would rather have the plain, unmelted Rolo candy too.

I've been making these for Christmas for several years and they are always a hit.  I prefer to use pretzel rings.  I have tried Rolos and Dove Caramels and I prefer the Rolos (surprisingly).  I also add a piece of Hershey chocolate on the top of the Rolo and put the Pecan half on top of that before putting in the oven- it is so much easier that way.

Made these for Christmas and used the Dove candies and cashews and almonds for the top.  A great idea that you can tailor to your favorite nut.  I tried peanut butter candies and those didn't work as well.

I made these for a Christmas party and then for gifts in small jars with ribbons. Nearly everybody asked for the recipe! They are awesome! However, I do recommend putting the whole cookie sheet directly into the freezer after placing the pecans. They set faster and are much easier to handle when frozen.

Just found out about these divine and yummy creations.  They took no time at all and are certainly worth unwrapping all those Rolos!  I have a GLUTEN-FREE guest here for the holidays and used mini caramel rice cakes instead of pretzels.  A great alternative.  Definitely place in oven for a full 4 minutes.  It makes them soft enough to easily press either a pecan on the top OR another waffle-shaped pretzel for those with NUT ALLERGIES!!!  Sorry, can't write anything further for my review.  I have to go and eat another dozen pretzel turtles!!!!

very easy. Warning -I used Riesen chocolate caramels, and they were too hard on the teeth. You need a softer caramel to go with the pretzels.

I JUST made these and boy did they turn out great!!! I used Rolos (bc they are my Mom and I's fav chocolate candy) and the non-square mini pretzels.  I places them on wax paper, since I didn't have any parchment paper on hand and it worked out fine. Also, 3 minutes was plenty of time for the chocolate to get soft!  These are definitely going to become a regular at my house!

This is the first time I've made these.  It couldn't be an easier recipe.  I had trouble finding Rolos so I tried a few caramel Kisses. Glad I only made a few...the kisses don't melt at all... they crack. Eventually I found the rolos and they turned out fine.  Thanks

AWESOME! So fast and easy. Great for gifts. I also made mine in the microwave while I was baking other cookies. Thanks for the tip!

These were pretty good. Not as spectacular as the other reviews would have had me believe. However, they ARE simple and quite tasty. My boyfriend loved them. They are certainly prettier when square or round pretzels are used. After looking in several stores, I finally discovered a combo package of triangle, square, and round pretzels in the kosher section of my local IGA. I just sort of stumbled upon them as I was half-heartedly looking there as my last possible resort.

These are very easy, and pretty tastey.  I made a batch with the Hershy's sugar-free chocolate covered chocolate mini bars.  Very good!  They take a bit longer to set up, but worth it if you are trying to make diabetic friendly treats.

Yummy! I normally use the round pretzel rings (purchase from Meijer) and drizzle with white chocolate (melt white chocolate chips w/ a little crisco, dip fork into chocolate and drizzle onto pretzels). Thanks for sharing. :-)

Need I say more than EASY and YUM? 3 minutes was perfect for me and I just stacked the pecan right on it in the oven and pressed a bit when it came out.

I made these and they were simply delicious!  I had numerous people try them and everyone I gave 1 to asked for another and another....I even made some with bite-sized 3 Musketeers, Milky Ways, half of a tiny Twix bar and they all were equally as delicious. The only change I made was letting them stay in oven for 5 minutes vs. just 4.  Maybe my oven is a little off?  Overall, definitely a keeper!  I will be making them for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year!

I made this for a little treat on the side of another dessert and they were a huge hit.  I don't know why this time I didn't look at the other reviews, thought it might be a self explanitory recipe.  However, as we ate them we were trying to find another chocolate that might offer more caramel then the hershey kiss.  I thought maybe a jumbo rolo, but never thought of dove.  Either way this recipe is fabulous.  I have seen this recipe with plain kisses with a m &m and on top for those who don't like the nuts like little ones.  you could make a batch for the grown ups and some for the kiddies.

ALWAYS  get rave reviews from this one!!! Most people think you made a huge effort, so you can smile and let them believe you did or astonish them and share the secret around! I use Jumbo Rolo's on mini pretzels to get a little extra choco/carmael aspect. I always use raw pecan halves, but I bet roasted/salted ones would also be delicious!

Stress free, delicious and versitile receipe. Sweet tooth or not, everyone loves them. 20 is not remotely enough. I toast the peacans coated in melted butter for 11 mins in 325C, follow the receipe, then put the cookie sheet in the refrigerator for 15 mins while I work on another batch. In 1/2 hour, you can easily get 100 done!  Salty/Sweet goodness :)

Oh my - these are delicious! I used the square pretzel, I think they're called Snaps and Rolos for the chocolate. I did what another reviewer mentioned and that was to brush melted butter on the pecans and then roast them, they came out SO much better than they were right out of the bag. I also drizzled some semi sweet chocolate over the tops of the finished product. SO GOOD!!!

I used the square pretzel and square Dove brand chocolate/caramel.  The first time I baked for 4 min. with the nut on top.  The caramel seeped out of several.  The second time I baked for only 3 min. and as they were cooling the caramel seeped out again, so I put them in the refrigerator.  Next time I'll bake for 3-3 1/2 min and immediately take them out of the oven and put in freezer.  I did some without nuts and they generally held the caramel in.  I also did some with the Dove brand white chocolate squares/no nuts.  All versions are really tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these for Christmas and they were a HUGE hit.  People had no idea how easy they were to make or that they were made with ROLO'S!  I had made a double batch then had to make more for New Years Eve.  Super easy, fun to make (even with little ones!) and TOTALLY yummy!

These yuMMy treats were a big hit at Christmas and in my holiday cookie baskets.  I make a batch exactly the way the recipe calls for and throughly enjoyed it and for the holidays I did the rest of my batches with a red or green M&M on top rather than the pecan.  HeLpfuL HinTs: (1) use the square grid-like pretzels ("Snyders" Butter Snaps). (2) use the square dove chocolates with carmel...they are a perfect fit and when finished baking they look great. (optional) switch the pecan for the M&M.    EnJoY-- fast recipe with wonderful results.  This will be a staple in my holiday cookie/treat baskets.

These were amazing.  I made these when the family was together for brunch. The Dove Caramels that some had previously recommended was difficult to find so I used Rolos. I made some with the mini pretzels and others with the waffle style (square) pretzels.  The waffle style pretzels won as the favourite.  Everyone really enjoyed these but said that they would definately rate them much higher if the pretzels were unsalted. Once cooled down, putting the cookie sheet directly into the fridge freezer for a few minutes is a good idea since the chocolate takes a long time to harden again and gets messy on your hands.  These store very well at room temperature.

I use square pretzels and Rolo candies.  I sometimes use M & M's on top instead of the Rolos for the grandchildren (but they aren't nearly as good). Addictive! ***12/2013 I sprinkled just a little sea salt on top of half the batch. Very good, but I wish I had the larger crystals of salt.

These are very tasty. I use unsalted pretzels, dove chocolate camels and put the pecan on the top before putting them in the oven. When they come out I just give a little press on the pecan with a fork to keep it all together.

These are fabulous and so super easy!  I used the square pretzels, milk covered caramel Dove chocolates. I put them in the oven at 300 degrees for 2 min. on a parchment lined sheet.  Then added a toasted pecan on top and put it in the fridge for 30 min.  They will come off the parchment easily.  These also freeze beautifully if you need to make them ahead of time.

I love sweet and salt together!  These are really good!  The only suggestion I would make is to use the small square pretzels if you can find them.  I used the tiny round ones, but the gaps were so big, the chocolate melted through quite a bit.  They peeled of the foil (I didn't have parchment paper) okay after they cooled though.  I used Rolos.  Yum!

This is such an easy, simple great recipe to do with kids.  The combination of sweet and salty was realy tasty.  I would recommend using pretzel squares. I sprinkled green and red colored spinkles on them while they were still warm to give it the holiday look.  It was a hit with my family and friends.  Will make them again and again.

Yummy!! These were so easy (the step that took the longest was unwrapping the chocolates)! I roasted the pecans first and used Hershey's kisses with caramel centres. I found that baking them for 4 minutes made them a bit too runny, so I cut it down to 2 minutes and they were perfect. Melted just enough to press a pecan into, but still held their shape. They firmed up nicely in the fridge afterwards. I took them to a Christmas party and they disappeared within minutes!

I'm on my fourth batch of these in less than a week!  These are addicting...I found it much easier to use Rolos...I tried batches with both Rolos and Dove candies...the Dove candies were way too sweet and too soft/messy.

Delicious and simple.  WARNING:  DO NOT USE DOVE CHOCOLATES!  They do not melt correctly and the caramel oozes out when you try to press the pecan onto the top.

Here's the perfect fit.  Get mini waffle pretzels.  Toast pecan halves 5 minutes (350). Place pretzel on parchment lined sheet.  Place Dove (caramel) on top of pretzel. Place toasted half on top of caramel.  Bake at 300 for exactly 4 minutes.  Take out and press (gently) pecan into chocolate caramel to form turtle body.  Toasting the pecans before makes them crunchier and definitely more tasty

Wonderful and delicious!  My niece and I made these together and my three boys were eating them as fast as we could turn them out.  A nice combination of sweet and salty.  I followed the directions.

Loved it.  I spent extra on other holiday foods so decided to just use the stick pretzels I had in the cupboard for son's lunch.  I snapped 2 sticks in half.  Then placed all 4 pieces side by side in a mini muffin pan and followed directions as listed.  The mini muffin pan was perfect for holding the pretzel sticks in place.  I saved money, time and they tasted great!!!

5 stars isn't high enough for these. They are wonderful. I did use the rolos on top of the pretzels, put the pecan on top of it and put it in the oven for only 5 minutes. Take out of the oven and push down on the pecan. Worked wonderfully. I doubled the recipe that should have at least made 4 batches. They will disappear fast for the holidays.

I used waffle pretzels because the "hold" more of the caramel if it melts, "Rolo" brand caramels and beautiful fresh holiday cashews.  I also had the stove at 400 degrees for six minutes- the rolos melted better that way - but not too much.  I placed the cashews in funky different "poses" on top of the caramels.  Very fun!

Ok, I wish I hadn't taken the advise of others, the Rolos work so much betern than the Dove chocolates.  The caramel inside of the Doves is way too liquidy and runs all over creating quite a mess...a very yummy mess.  This entire mess is avoided when using a Rolo, the caramel center of a Rolo is more firm and not as apt to run when the pecan is pressed into it.  Either way this is a new favorite of mine and many of my friends and family.
(Older review below)
These are delish!!  I took some others advise by using the Dove chocolate carmels and only left them in the oven for about 3 minutes and a few second.  I also toaseted the pecans.  I think the Dove candies were too big for this, when I gently presed the pecan down, and I mean gently, the caramel oozed out of the candy.  Make sure you use parchament paper, I think it works much better than wax paper.  I'll try these again with Rolos.  But they are still great.

These went faster then I could make them. I used the square pretzels with Rolos (Cut in Half, carmel side down - plenty of chocolate) and used chopped pecan (all I had). For the kids I pressed a mini marshmallow on top. You could really do a lot of variations with this!

These were great, I should've got the square pretzels, I used mini's, not the best shape.  Then I used Milk Duds and squished M&Ms and malted milk balls (for spring)  into them, everyone loved them.

What an easy and fast way to make your own Turtles!  I used Rolo candy which turned out great, but after reading so many other reviewers rave about the Dove Caramel candy, I'll use that next along with the square pretzels, just to see the difference for myself.  This is a keeper recipe!

Great easy 3 ingredient recipe.  I used Dove chocolates with caramels and square pretzels.  The first few batches I pressed the pecan half a bit too hard and caused some of the caramel to ooze out.  The key is to very GENTLY press the pecan half into the chocolate.  Also, I lightly toasted the pecan halves before putting these together and it adds another subtle flavor.

THis has to be the simplest yumminess ever! I set my 4 year old and 6 year old up on the counter. Showed them how to stck the rolo on top of the pretzel and let them go at. They had so much fun, munching on rolos and making turtles. Then once they cam out of the oven, I did the pecans. They felt like master bakers and we couldn't believe how good these were. Fantastic!!

So quick it's almost embarrassing to call it a recipe! 

Another wonderful idea: top some with a fresh raspberry instead of the pecan! I had them on hand and was short on pecans...equally good.

I thought this would be a good "beginner" recipe for my granddaughters, who are just little fledgling bakers. They LOVED making them , they are simple enough they needed next to no supervision and they were SOOO proud of thier handy work. all the kids raved about them and they were gone in  record time. Like one reviewer said "double the recipe" Its a hit ! and its somthing the kids can make for thier own school bake sales and functions !

These are the greatest and so easy.  I use Rolos and the little square pretzels.  Be sure to toast the pecans before making... adds that extra special flavor.

I made these for a small friend get together. The adults did not like these as much as the children did because they eventually got hard as the night progressed and they returned to room temp. (I used Milk Duds instead of a softer candy because I hate unwrapping the individual candies, so that might have been the problem right there). If you needed to warm them up, a quick burst in the microwave or the oven warmed these right up and they tasted excellent! I give these 5 stars for taste and how easy they were! Great recipe :)

These were a big hit at my house.  I used the small square shaped pretzels and found it easier.

These were quick and yummy. I took other's suggestions and used the Dove Milk Chocolate caramels and the square pretzels. They were done in no time.

These were very good.  I used Reisens candy, and Release foil.  I thought the pecan was bland.  Next time I will use a large cashew or almond.

This recipe is soooo easy and the candies taste just like the actual turtle candies. They were a huge hit for Christmas and for potlucks if you dont have the time to make anything. You can make 100 of these in less than 10 minutes and they are kind of fun to make. I used Rolo's candies, as I felt they worked the best and instead of regular pretzels I used the square ones like others did because you dont lose your candies and there is no mess. GREAT FOR COOKIE EXCHANGE!! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

These are so easy to make and a great combination of sweet/salty, crunchy/chewy. On a whim I decided to try Reese's miniature Peanut Butter cups instead of Rolos and WOW, everything loved those! Just a hint, that if you make them with Reese's, they don't need as long in the oven to melt so watch them. Also the peanut butter never really melts, so they don't "squish" the same way as the ones with Rolos. As a result, they don't look quite as pretty but they're sooo good.

These were so easy and tasted great! I used the snap (square Pretzels) and dove chocolate covered carmels.  The candy is square so they fit perfectly on the pretzel. While they were cooling, I sprinkled with red & white sprinkles for valentines day.  The hardest part of this recipe was unwrapping all the individually wrapped candies! Will be making often!

THESE ARE THE BEST!!!! I MADE THESE FOR THE TEACHER'S AT MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL AND WHEN I CAME TO PICK UP THE I WAS BOMBARDED WITH COMPLIMENTS AND REQUESTS FOR THE RECIPE.  YOU MUST TOAST THE PECANS AS ONE REVIEWER SUGGESTED AND I DRIZZLED THEM WITH WHITE AND MILK CHOCOLATE, FOR THAT VERY EXPENSIVE LOOK.  THIS RECIPE IS SO SIMPLE BUT THE PRESENTATION AND TASTE MAKES IT LOOK LIKE YOU SPENT HOURS IN THE KITCHEN. I WILL ADD MY PHOTOS ONCE I FIGURE OUT HOW TO UPLOAD THEM FROM MY PHONE. THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!!

Hooray for these!  They really do take like, 5 minutes to make.  I also used the Dove Chocolates with caramel and I stacked everything together pre-baking and it was absolutely a snap to just press the pecan down with the back of a spoon when they came out.

My son had these at work and told me about them. I make white coated pretzels and these are sooo much easier. One word of warning. I tried using Hersey kisses with caramel and they don't work well. Not enough caramel.

WOW! I spent 2 weeks making a list of christmas cookies and candies to make. I planned on starting my baking today, well unexpectedly was up earlier then I thought with a sick toddler finding it hard to find any time to bake. I started with these since they were the easiest....and after tasting them they are probably THE BEST! I used waffle pretzels, Rolos and I drizzled white and milk chocolate over them. They look like i spent a ton of money on them. OMG they are gooooooooooood!!!!!!!!! So pretty too. I will post a picture of them later!!!!!!!!!

Very easy. I used Dove chocolates with carmel but they were a little too big as the carmel oozed over the pretzel. Tasted great but might try Rolos next time.

I took the advice of another reader and assembled my turles as such:  pretzel, caramel candy, and then the nut on top.  I placed them into the oven for about 4 minutes, and then when I pulled them out, I was able to take the back of a spoon and just press the nuts right into the candies.  This way they got to roast a little bit in the oven without that extra step of roasting them separately.  This recipe was so very easy, and tastes great!  I also melted some almond bark white chocolate stuff in the microwave after the turtles had cooled, and drizzled it over the tops of the candies.  Beautiful!

These were OK.  Maybe if I used a better caramel candy, like Dove, it would have been better.  I just used some unknown brand and the caramel was kind of hard.

These are dangerously delicious and incredibly easy! I made both with Dove and Rolos. We definitly prefer Rolos because they give you the chew. It was hard not to eat them before they cooled. I will be making these again for Christmas (if I can wait that long).

This is an awesome recipe.  We always make them at Christmas.  Instead of just making just twenty, I would suggest to make as many as you can with a bag of rolos.

I use Rolos minis that are unwrapped in a resealable package (=fast). Used on mini pretzels with the pecans on top, they are to die for! My teenage boys ate these so fast I only got one. Had to make another secret batch while they were not looking! Delicious!!!!!

You have to rate this as a pretzel turtle, and not a real chocolate turtle.  As a quick, easy DIY candy for people that like turtles, it will certainly do in a pinch.  I prefer the square lattice style pretzels with the caramel fill Dove chocolates because it's a good fit, and better/more chocolate than a Rolo.  Make them at least a day ahead. They are much, much better the next day when things have completely settled in.

Simply perfect. These are a big hit in my Christmas treat boxes I send to family and friends. As soon as my husband sees the big bag of Rolos come into the kitchen during the holidays he know that I'm getting ready to make these and he can't wait to eat them. You can use any shape of small pretzels and if you have someone who cannot eat nuts then you can always replace the pecans with M&Ms.

I use Rolo candies and Snyder pretzel "snaps" (the small square grids).  To make them nut-free we pressed a second pretzel on top once the candies were soft - sort of a pretzel sandwich.  Delicious! Also mine were soft at 3 minutes but the chocolate was not drippy, which was good.

Easy to make and delicious. I would recommend making them the day before so the candy can cool and "harden" back up. We made ours too close to the party and they didn't cool enough so they were a bit messy. We also did half a batch using Reese's cups and they were very tasty as well.

These were phenomenal!!! I made a few adaptations 1) I used walnuts instead of pecans; just personal preference. 2) I used plain caramels and then drizzled the chocolate over top. They were kind of reminiscent of Take 5 bars to me. I will DEFINITELY be making these again soon! Thanks for the recipe!!

Made a ton of these for the  holidays and everyone just raved about them.  My family can't get enough of these.  I followed other suggestions and sautéed the pecans in a tablespoon of butter- they taste much better that way.  I also melted some white chocolate chips I had on hand and zigzagged it over them as soon as I took them out of the oven.  The chocolates plus pecans can get pricey, but it's all well worth it!

Amazingly quick and easy.  Make a lot for an easy gift.  I did most of them with pecans, but about a quarter of them I topped with a red or green M&M, for people who don't care for nuts.  I followed another reviewers recommendation and, after completely cooled, I melted about 1 cup of white chips with a tsp of shortening, put it into ziplock bag cut in the corner, and drizzled over the candies.  They looked an tasted fantastic.  EASY!

Delicious combination of flavors! We love these! I followed the temp and time and it was perfect. I put the pecans on before baking and it made it so easy when they came out to just press each one. I prefer making these with the little square pretzels but didn't have them this time and they still turned out fine with not hardly any chocolate leaking through the bottom.

Easy? Cheap? Crowd-pleasing? Embarrassingly delicious? Check.
The only problem is that you have left over pretzels in the bag, so you buy more caramels, but then you have too many caramels, so you buy more pretzels...

I've been making these for almost 10 years.  They're so simple and everyone loves them!  Some people get fancy, but the original has always worked fine for me.  They are requested at every office pot-luck!  Just a tip...for a crowd, 20 of these will NOT be enough.  I usually make two full cookie sheets at a time (probably 80-100 turtles) and they are always gone by the afternoon.  Do remember to use the parchment paper or you will have a stuck-on mess.  Enjoy!

I used rolos, and these were so easy and so so good! Kids and adults alike gobbled them up. Watch the baking time though, it really varies with each kind of candy you use; the next time I make these with rolos I will reduce the baking time a bit so the caramel doesn't run out.

With only 3 ingredients (also a plus) and very little modification it just seemed like 3 ingredients stuck together and not a cohesive treat.  However, most who tasted enjoyed.  If not bought on sale, the ingredients are expensive.

This recipe is SUPER EASY!! Love that! After reading reviews, I decided to use Dove chocolate covered caramels. I lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper, then put down my pretzels with a chocolate and then my pecan. The first batch I baked for 3 minutes on 350, and the caramel started leaking out onto my cookie sheet after I gently pushed the pecan down into the chocolate. With the second batch, I baked then at 350 for 2 minutes. Turned out perfect. Everyone that has tried them, love it!! This recipe is going into my file for easy/fast holiday treats! 

Re-review with new method - So I made this this morning for a Post Superbowl treat contest here at work.  I didnt have time to make them in advance, and after reading a few of the reviews - I saw that a few had used the microwave.  If you're going to use this method, only microwave the pretzle and chocolate for 10-15 seconds TOPS.  I put it in for 30 and there was caramel everywhere on the plate.  Maybe its cause I used Dove chocolate caramels instead of Rolos (and the Rolos have a thicker chocolate coating).

I used the square small pretzels, rolos and toasted pecans. I have a gas oven and have come to realize that it bakes quicker. I left mine in for 3 minutes and before I could get all the pecans on my rolos had pretty much melted into a mess.  I did salvage them and will make them again but will only leave in the oven for 2 minutes and see how that works. Once the cooled they were eadible but not so pretty.

These are AWESOME! So quick to make and they are delicious. If using unroasted pecans, be sure to toast them first to give them the crunch and bring out the nuttiness (275F for 10-15 minutes).  These, plus the Frosted Pecan Bites and the Cinnamon Roasted Almonds (both from this site) make up our Christmas snack bags for coworkers.  It took about 2 and a half minutes to melt perfectly - enough to let the pecan be squished in, but not enough to melt out onto the aluminum foil and for the caramel to explode out (making it really hard to rip apart and not stick to things).  Try 1 tray first and evaluate how it all worked out before throwing in the next tray.

Used Rolos instead & LOVE them! One thing tho, make sure not to leave them in the oven too long or they'll spread. I took mine out after 2 minutes & it was almost too long.

I make these ahead and freeze them every year without any problems.  You do want to make sure they are completely cool and the chocolate is firm before wrapping them up so they don't "sweat" and make the pretzel soft. I put them between layers of waxed paper and then put some plastic wrap on top.

When I offered to bring a dish to yesterday's party yesterday, this is what was requested.  (I brought them to a previous party and they were a big hit.)  The only changes I make are I bake at 350 for two minutes.  To make them a little fancier, I melt white chocolate chips in a baggie, snip the corner, (very tiny snip), and squeeze squiggles on the top of each turtle. I used gluten-free pretzels, since my friend is intolerant, and no one else knew the difference!

Also delicious with Peanut M&Ms instead of pecans.  Use red & green for Christmas.

These are quick, easy, and awesome.  The only trouble I have is hiding them from my husband! I left a pan in the fridge to harden, planned on taking them work the next day.  Came back from an errand to find them half eaten!

So amazingly easy and delicious! I used the Dove milk chocolate caramels, and they worked out lovely... minus the caramel spilling out of the chocolate when I pressed the pecans on top. They still taste the same, though!

These were really good.  I imagine using circular style pretzels would be easier, but I could only find the mini's and they worked just fine.  I used almonds instead of pecans as I am allergic, and they were really good.  I live in a really hot area, so I had to put them in the fridge to harden, and it made them really nice and chewy.  Easy to make and addicting!!!!

I highly recommend using the Dove milk chocolate caramels.  They tasted much better than the Rolos and fit perfectly on the square pretzels.  These were very easy to make, and were a big hit at the family party.

Very tasty dessert and so easy to make. I made tons of these on my daughter's 1st birthday party and whole serving tray was empty before the guests started to leave..:) Initially I needed to test and try a few to make it as shown in the pic, before mastering the technique I ate 10-12 of them myself :). But once I was good at it, I made them in the batches of 18 each on well cut cookie sheets,  refrigerated them and served them as such in layers along with the cookie sheets I used in baking. Voila! everyone was wondering if I have got them ordered from some store or bakery. With a small child home I didnt have much time to cook so I had to order some stuff from the market. Thanks Cacki, for posting such a time-saving and worth-making recipe. Cheers!

So quick and easy! I brought a tray of 40 of these to a party where there were lots of other appetizers and desserts. There wasn't one of these left after the party. I used Rolos and Snyder's Snaps pretzels. After they cooled, I put them in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes so the chocolate would set up, and they were perfect.

Perfect little treat for after school or whenever you want something sweet/salty.  Took them into the office and they were gone in a snap!  Substituted pecan for wal nut and turned out FAB!

These were soooo delicious!  My kids (3,5,8, & 10) helped and we gave them as a new addition to our Christmas cookie tin gifts.  We also used almonds.  They got rave reviews.  They only problem was we could not stop eating them!

Cheap ingredients, easy to make, tastes wonderful! First batch baked with pecans placed on top, sounded like a time-saver but no, they slid all over the place and spent quite a bit of time re-centering them. Second batch baked as directed, adding pecans after baking, worked perfectly!

My young children and I made these to take to a family get together.  We used dark chocolate covered caramels from Trader Joe's. (I guess I am a chocolate snob because that waxy brown stuff covering Rolos does not taste like chocolate.) I love that these were easy enough for my 5 & 3 year olds to assemble and were so quick to make. They were gobbled up quickly!  We will definitely be making these again.

love these! I over did it and tried putting like 50 on one pan, it made it hard to put the pecans on. I would also suggest toasting the pecans and putting them on after they were in the oven.

I made these and they were extremely popular at a function I attended. Everyone wanted to know how to make them. I put the pecans on while in the oven after making a batch and pressing the pecans on when they came out of the oven. It was much easier to just bake with the pecans on the Carmel/chocolate candy then adding after they came out of the oven. I also tried making these with Rolos and Dove chocolate covered Carmels over the waffle type pretzels, and the ones made with the Dove Carmels turned out much better.

These were excellent and easy to make.  Four minutes at 300 degrees is way too long.  I baked mine for 2.5 minutes at 280 degrees and they came out perfect.  Made great Christmas gifts for neighbors and friends.

I put the pecan halves in oven like suggested by another user so that they would get toasted and they were delicious :)

So easy to make and so very good.  I use Rolo and use 2 pretzel to reduce the sweetness of the caramel candy.  Highly recommended.

I made these for my family Christmas party this year and everyone LOVED them! Like other reviewers, I put mine in the oven for just 3 minutes and that was plenty of time. I will definitely make these again and again.

This is so super easy that it's shameful.. truly a perfect recipe.  Some friends from work and I made around 200 of these as gifts for our co-workers.  We made the mistake of placing the candies directly on a baking sheet.  The chocolate melted through the pretzel so when we chilled them to cool quickly, they stuck to the sheet.  We "popped" them by twisting the sheet and what was left we gently twisted off by hand.  Next time we'll put them on a wax or parchment paper.  But even with that setback, the end result was fantastic!  Sitting around peeling the Rolos with friends was the hardest part :)  Will most definitely make these again and again and again..

I love Turtle, but always found them a pain to make!  This recipe is wonderful!!! Very easy and oh so yummy!! I made a few with an alteration to the recipe...I have a few friends that can't eat nuts but love caramel - so, I top these with another pretzel and decorated the top with chocolate.

I made these for a staff party, and everyone loved them. My husband, who first turned up his nose at them, ate one after the party, declared them "great", then polished off the leftovers! I used Dove candies. The recipe could not have been easier, and I loved the salty with the caramelly sweet.

I love these, I used caramel kisses, and the only pretzels I could find were little round ones, but it worked out great, I only let it bake for 3 minutes and they were AWESOME.  I brought a big container to work and there isn't any left and that was a big contanier and it's only been a couple days.  I will be making more of these in the next couple days.  YUMMY. thanks for the recipe.

We made this last year as a holiday treat we passed out to co-workers. I'm not sure how my co-workers liked them... but we sure did LOVE them at home. It was the perfect combo of sweet and salty. I can't wait to make them again this year!

Adorable, easy and oh so tasty! A new favorite to add to our Christmas trays. I used the round, criss-cross pretzels and toasted the pecan halves in the microwave. The kids kept coming back for more! One bag of Rolos made about 50 pretzels - about half of my sheet pan. Next time I'll buy two bags of pretzels and four bags of Rolos to fill two sheet pans. Update: The chocolate on the last batch of these bloomed. I probably got the chocolate too hot, so next time I'll be sure to pull them from the oven when they're just soft enough to push down with the pecans.

These were incredibly easy to make and tasty as well. I really like the sweet/salty combo. I toasted the pecans, as several has suggested - and drizzled with white chocolate for even more eye appeal. A definite keeper!

Great recipe!!! These are so pretty and taste yummy too! The only thing I did differently was to roast the pecan halves before I baked the chocolate and pretzel squares, and I drizzled them with white chocolate. This one is great for the holidays!

SCRUMPTIOUS! You will definitely need to make double the amount because they go quickly.  Very easy to make. I used the pretzel snaps, Rollo candies and toasted pecans. 3 minutes is plenty of time in the oven.

Yum - everyone asked how these were made.  I put pecans on at same time as chocolates (Dove caramels) and used square pretzels.  Drizzled semi-sweet melted chocolate over them once they cooled (put in ziplock and cut off tip).

These are WONDERFUL! I used the square butter snap pretzles, they are perfect size. If you are in a hurry You can buy the individual Rolo's pkgs at the candy bar lane at check out, if you do not want to unwrap the bagged ones. I  put my pecan half on before baking, all I had to do when they came out was press down. I also cooled in fridge. to speed along. These go quick so make many and Enjoy!

This recipe couldn't be any easier.  I used mini pretzels and Rolos.  Instead of adding a pecan I placed another pretzel on top.  The result was a pretzel chocolate sandwich.  I'm not sure that I would make these again but it only took a matter of minutes to make.  Update:  People love these treats.  I've made them about a dozen times and they are usually devoured in a matter of minutes!

maybe i did this wrong, but i used hersheys kisses that had caramel centers and when i added the pecan they exploded! the caramel leaked out and i was left with a dirty sheetpan and caramel-less turtles. plus it took way too long to unwrap all those kisses. what a waste of kisses.

I used Rolos and square pretzels.  I didn't use any nuts because of allergies.  So I had to use a spoon and a knife to get the spoon off.  The oil didn't help the spoon from sticking.

How can you go wrong??  These are excellent.  I agree that using Dove chocolates improves the texture of the end product; however, the warm Dove chocolates tend to explode more easily than regular Rolos.

Very easy to make and very yummy to eat. I bought the Dove caramel candies and they worked out really good. I used almonds instead of pecans as I am not a fan. Very good! They were a big hit in my house.

I got Dove chocolates to used, and put them on the pretzels with the pecan on top. I let them bake for 1 minute. When they come out gently press the pecan down. It was very easy and quick. If you leave in oven much longer the caramel will spill out of the chocolate, when pressing the pecan in. Put into fridge to set and it is an awsome treat.

These were so easy, and so yummy.  I love the salty/sweet combination.  Hubby and I agreed, however, that next time I make them I have to finish them just before we take them someplace else so that we don't eat them all by ourselves!

Easy quick recipe.  I used rolos and small regular pretzels like the recipe requests.  I look for the grid ones, but  were sold out.  After making them I think the grid ones would have too much pretzel.  The chocolate did seep through the holes, but I baked them on a silicon baking sheet cooled them at room temp for 10 min and stuck them in the fridge still on the silicon sheet.  They peeled off perfectly after 20-30 min in the fridge, while I did my hair for the new years party we were going to.

So delicious and so easy! Very much like a turtle candy, which I love. I used square (snap) pretzels, rolos and chopped pecans. I did as others suggested and topped with pecans before baking, and only baked for 3 minutes - so they weren't too melty. With the chopped pecans, I had to put a couple pieces on each. Will try the Dove suggestion next time and also try the whole pecans so they may look a little neater. Definitely double or triple the recipe, as they are sure to get eaten and it doesn't  take much time to make more. You can easily fit 40 or more on one large cookie sheet.

these are great! everyone loves them, and they're so easy to make! (not to mention they're not too bad for the waste line either!) I made mine in the microwave. I found using dark chocolate candies for a minute worked well, also putting the pecans on before putting every thing in the micro also worked well for me. After cooking put the parchment paper with the turtles in the fridge for 1/2 hour  or so and they snap right off.

Another variation is to use Hershey Kisses or Hugs in place of the Rolo and when they come out of the oven top with a red or green M & M for Christmas or any color the rest of the year. They taste just like a chocolate dipped pretzel and disappear instantly when you put them out.

These were fast, easy and clever looking, but they weren't a crowd-pleaser from my experience. I took them to a New Years party and had four plates full from one recipe and not even half of them got eaten. Most people said they just didn't like pretzels. I felt like it was a waste. Too bad.

I've made these twice now, with Dove caramel chocolates. They're so easy to make!! The hardest part is unwrapping all the candies. I drizzled dark chocolate over these and placed them in tiny red, white & green candy/cupcake wrappers.. They looked pretty impressive, like something you'd get in a gourmet candy store :) I took a batch of these to Christmas Eve and also gave a batch for a "white elephant" gift and they were a big hit both places! :)

Boy everyone loves these!  I am in a cookie exchange and I'm not a great baker, I do everything I can do avoid baking!  These are so easy and look great on the tray!  I also used the square pretzels, dove chocolates and put the raw pecan on top, baked for about 5-6 minutes and pressed down gently after baking.  So good!  Thank you!

Excellent! I have tried this recipe with dark chocolate dove, peanut butter filled milk chocolate dove (only cook for 3 minutes) and milky ways and they have all turned out great! This is a quick, easy and inexpensive idea for coworker and neighbor holiday gifts. Thank you for submitting this recipe!

This was the easiest recipe I have ever used and they were SOOOOO good. I used Snyder's Butter Snaps Pretzels and Dove chocolate covered carmels. I found that using both of these specific items worked best. Thanks for sharing!

So good, and so easy. It really impresses people who don't know the recipe. I used Dove caramels and square pretzels. I'll try Rolos next time because the Dove caramel is softer and there's really just less of it. To me, turtles should have a thick chewy caramel, and Dove just doesn't provide that. The flavor of the chocolate, however, is superior. If using Dove, I would recommend only heating them for 2-3 minutes. That way, the caramel won't ooze out all over the place. Also, wait a couple minutes after you take them out of the oven before you put the caramel on. It will still be melty enough for the pecan to mush down and stick, but cut down on the caramel running out.

ok, i am NOT an experienced candy maker, and i'm a natural klutz, but even i managed to make these with a minimum of fuss, and they turned out terrific!!!  i used Rolos, and the little square pretzels, and gave them away to the neighbors as Christmas tokens---they slipped and slid a bit on the parchment paper, but once they were boxed up they looked really nice, and tasted wonderful!  thanks for a candy recipe that even *I* can manage!

I couldn't find rolo so used Reisen dark choc cov caramel and they just fit on the Snaps.  The pecan halves were really large so they were perfect.  The only drawback was that the Reisen have too much caramel and they are a little hard to bite and chew. I have another bag of Reisen so I might cut them in half or find another way to mix  pretzel, caramel and pecan into a cluster.

They didn't turn out very pretty. So I was a little let down however they do taste good! If I took the time to drizzle some white or dark chocolate over top I'm sure that would jazz them up a bit.

The kids had a great time helping me "make" these super easy treats. I did use the waffle pretzels & dove caramels as someone else suggested. Lightly baked the walnuts before putting them on. Took from another review & melted a cup of white choc chips w/ 1/2 teaspoon of crisco & spooned "lines" over the finished product, looked GREAT!  Will definately make again.

I have been making these for a few years now. I made trays and trays of these this weekend. I took some to school and give them as gifts. Sometimes I use cashews on  few for a different flavor. Or 1 cashew with 2 red hots to make a smile face:) So Easy! So tasty!

I have made this before with Peanut Butter kisses topped with M&M's and it too was wonderful.  Just open your mouth and pop them in.  I took them off the cookie sheet as quick as possible because they still melt a little while sitting on it.

Very easy.  I toasted the pecans on the stove in just a minute or two.  They are rock hard out of the fridge but perfect at room temp.  My package of rolos made 60 or so and all fit on one baking sheet.

I can't believe how easy and delicious these are!  I ended up following the suggestion of another rater who said they stacked the rolo and pecan half on top of the pretzel before putting in the oven for 4 minutes.  Took them out, pressed down quickly, and then slid the parchment paper with the candies off of the hot cookie sheet right away so they didn't melt any more.  BTW, 1 bag of rolos makes about 1 cookie sheet worth.  I used 2 bags and am going to do some more since they are so quick.  Honestly, the hardest part of the process was unwrapping the rolos!

I was skeptical at first.  How could something this simple be so good?  They are amazing.  I made them the first time according to the recipie and they were very good.  The second time, roasted the pecans in a few tablespoons of butter at 325 for 15 minutes and sprinled with koser salt.  The little bit of extra work really brought the flavors all together.  Awesome.  Also drizzeled white chocolate over the top.

I've made these a few times before and they're always a hit.  I usually use Hershey's caramel chocolate kisses.  They're just the right size and texture.  I've also used cashews in place of pecans, and have seen it done with various kinds of M&Ms in place of pecans as well.  They're all good, but I prefer the real turtle taste of the pecans.

OK PEOPLE!!!!! Just make them...you know you want to!!!!! I have been making these for a few years as little extras in a decorative chinese takout container or wrapped in pretty cellophane for "thank you" gifts, in a Christmas basket and football parties (and of course for myself)! There is NO easier and more delicious way to get that awesome turtle taste. I know candy making is an intricate art.  One that I am not so great at, which is why I enjoy these...they make me feel like I am doing something so great, when it is soooooo easy.  Oh, and I always get the same statement from everyone I give these to: "Your going to bring those candy turtles aren't you?" Worth your while!

If you like salty and sweet candies, these are for you!  Perfect for the holidays and so quick and easy to make.  My 8 year old son loved helping me make them!  I sprinkled a little bit of sea salt on top right after I put the pecans on...yum!

These were so easy to make and everyone loved them.  I topped with pecans that were preroasted and salted in the bag.  I used chocolate covered caramel squares sold at our local Farm & Fleet (their brand) and I used the Great Value chocolate covered caramel cups from Walmart.  Both turned out wonderful.

We love to make these, got the recipe a couple of years ago from a friend, I changed it a bit, and used two m&ms for the top to accommodate my husbands dislike of nuts. I have also used nilla wafers as the base and those are really good too!

Make sure you use Rollos or some kind of chocolate covered caramel that doesn't have too much caramel. I'd had these before with the Rollos and they were addictive. With the Reisings the caramel just dominated everything and they were kind of disappointing.

My gravy!  How cute are THESE?!  My daughter had a friend coming over without much notice so I whipped these up as a treat and they just raved.  So very, very easy and they look impressive.  I did toast my pecans first.

These went very fast at the bake sale I brought them too- I would have made more but had run out of the chocolate candies. Per advice of other reviewers, I used Dove candies with the caramel inside and waffle pretzels. I also put the pecans on before I put them in the oven so that they would roast properly. Will definitely use again!

These are simply awesome. Easy to make (most time consuming thing is unwrapping the candy!), kids can help, everyone likes them and wants the recipe!  Double or even triple the recipe. Great for holiday gifts.

These are super easy and highly addictive!  I used rollos and they are so good but the dove chocolates probably squish prettier because of their shape.  I will be making these for every get together this Christmas and they will make great teacher gifts!

These were easy to make, but messy.  I used Rolos, but I think a better candy choice would really show through.   I made them for Valentine's day and put them into cups for gifts.  The recipients loved them.

Wonderful!  I used Dove chocolate covered carmels and I tried the Dove chocolate covered peanut butter on pretzel squares.  Perfect!  The peanut butter ones need only 3 minutes because they melted faster than the carmels.  Thanks for the great idea!!

These disappear so fast every time I make them.  While rolos are good, I prefer to use Reisen for extra chocolate flavor.  Keep a close eye while these are in the oven because mine were ready a little early.

The perfect mix of salty and sweet, so good! And easy to alter for any holiday or occasion by melting a cup of white chocolate chips, a little crisco, and any color food coloring and drizzling over top!

I have made these several times, preferring the "snaps" pretzel shape.  I use non-stick aluminum foil on a jelly roll pan and fill it up with as many  pretzels and Rolos as will fit.

FABULOUS!!!  I made this for a partry and it was a huge hit.  So easy and yummy.  I used Dove caramels and the square buttery pretzels.  They took no time at all to make - unwrapping the chocolates took the most time.  I loved this recipe and will make again and again!

My mother in law made these once - without the extra chocolate drizzle on the top.  She used Rolo candies and they were WONDERFUL.  She does weight watchers and said they were only one point each!  So they are a nice snack, assuming that you don't eat 10 at a time!  Which is very well something you may want to do.

This was so EASY and everyone just loved it!!! I used Rolos and roasted the pecans (in the microwave) for 35 seconds on each side of the pecan. Big hit @ the superbowl party.

Had a friends child spend the day with me today and we made these as a treat for her family.she unwrapped candy for me (a great help).We made some with Rolos with a M&M \pressed in (no nuts for some children).We then made some with peppermint kisses and they are great.We pressed a M&M into these too.These will be great for Christmas using red and green M&M'S.We used square pretzels. Great for any occasion!!!

These are absolutely delicious and so easy to make! I used caramel kisses to make my first batch and found that one per pretzel was not enough to cover.  Then I used two kisses and had to smooth them out when melted to get the right shape.  Next time I will try to find a larger, rounder chocolate caramel candy to use.

Love these. Love the salty/sweet. Melted a few white chocolate chips in the micro and drizzled over them after they were cool. (Must let them cool completely or you will have a mess!) Great for Christmas cookie platters. Even the kids helped with these.

I took other reviewers suggestion and put my pecans on before popping them in the oven.  They came out beautifully!  Great Christmas gifts or for bringing to a potluck.

The perfect little treat, and my 5 year old did most of the work!  We would never snack on the butter-flavored Hanover pretzels, but they did add just a touch of depth to this recipe, so I'd recommend those (and use the square pretzel if you can, regardless).  I used toasted pecans that we put in place  before baking & Dove caramel chocolates.  I personally thought they looked better without any drizzle on top, although others have suggested it.  Such a hit!

I totally agree with all the rave reviews!  Excellent, easy, fun treat to make and eat.  I had to keep them in the oven for about 8 minutes before the caramel was soft enough to mush down a little.

I love these.  They are sweet, salty and chewy.  Can't eat just one.  These are so easy to make.  I put these in the fridge to cool, as they do take awhile to harden.

I used Rolo's and regular mini pretzels, topped them with a pecan then threw them in a 300*F oven as directed for 4 minutes, then pressed down on the pecan. Unfortunately I forgot to use parchment paper as directed. Oops! Still amazing anyways, just a pain to get off the cookie sheet once cooled. These were so easy, and look awesome! They taste even better too! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

I use the Non Stick aluminum foil and remove it immediately after pressing the nuts down and put it into the refrigerator until they cool - no oozing of the carmel that way.  Also - buy the ROLLS of Rolo's instead of the individual wrapped candies to save a bundle of time!

I made these today. I used Dove Chocolate with carmel centers thinking that Dove is a little better chocolate than Rolo, as others suggested. Also, I cut back on the time in the oven - 2 minutes. Worked great. Do not push down too hard on the pecans or carmel comes out the sides of the chocolates. 
It is so cold here in Colorado that I put the tray outside to see if the carmel would harden enough to put the turtles in gift boxes with other treats we made today. So just a warning, push down on the pecans very lightly if at all.

Easy and delicious! I made a double batch, so it required 2 bags of Rolos. I toasted enough pecans for both batches (about 100) while I unwrapped all those Rolos. I baked 1 batch at a time for 3 minutes. They were a huge hit and I will definitely add this recipe to my collection of "holiday treats".

WARNING!!!! Make sure you do a trial run with just a few candies first. I baked for the 4 minutes as suggested in the recipe. They looked great coming out of the oven, and seemed fine after I gently pushed the pecans down. However, as they sat, the caramel oozed out of the candy. They do actually look a little more like the traditional Turtle Candy that way, but I was hoping to keep the caramel confined. Next time I will try 2 minutes and then if needed go to 3 minutes. 4 minutes was definitely too long for my oven, which has always been very accurate.

I used the Snyder Snap Pretzels and the Dove Chocolate Covered Caramels. This combo works out perfectly. They are both square and the candy fits perfectly on top of the pretzel. I did put the pecans on before baking. I  know many recommend the Rolos, but I never thought they were a good chocolate, so would never attempt to use them for a special treat like this. JMHO.

Super simple. It only took about 15 minutes to make about 70 of these. I bought the store brand pecan halves since they were $2 less than the "fancy jumbo" pecan halves, and after making these I realize I should have gotten the jumbo fancy ones since some of my pecan halves were really small. Easy quick recipe. I used Rolo brand candies and pretzel windows. Thanks!!!

These are really pretty good!  A couple of suggestions:  Use Dove Chocolate Caramels; put the pecan half on top of the chocolate before baking.  Press gently on the pecan to "set" it in the chocolate.  Don't push too hard or the caramel will squish out and it doesn't really harden, so they will be messy when storing and eating.

Great easy recipe for holiday treats.  I drizzle some melted white chocolate (mixed with a little crisco) over the top for a really professional look.
Thanks so much for this recipe!

Great recipe and easy. The trick with the rollo's is not to wait until they melt. Cook until they look a little soft. I also tried this with the Hersey bars that have the caremal in them. They tasted the same but weren't as pretty. If you use the bars just make sure to cut them with a sharp knife and cut each small square into half. If you use a full square it is too much chocolate and they get gooey. The candy bar is cheaper, but the rollo's look nicer. I allso used wax paper because I ran out of parchment paper. I don't recommend using wax unless you grease it.Easy and yummy candy!!!

These were amazing!! I cannot express how fantastic these little treats were. I also used the grid shaped pretzels (snaps) and they were perfect. I drizzled them with white chocolate for extra affect and then gave them out as holiday gifts. Its a little time consuming to unwrap all the rolos but well worth it. If you have a helper around it makes it go way faster.

I got so many compliments today from all the teachers that we gave these to!!!  The candy cane kisses, with green m-n-m's on top, were everyone's favorite.  I highly suggest using pretzel waffles so the chocolate does not melt through.  I also only cooked them for 3 minutes, instead of 4!!!  Much better results!!!

What a great recipe this is!  The most time-consuming step was taking all the wrappers off the Rolos.   Didn't have parchment paper, but using butter flavored spray on the cookie sheet worked just fine.  Be patient in the cooling time...thought the chocolate would never harden.

These were WONDERFUL!  I, like many others toasted my pecans, and also used the Dove with caramel centers.  I made them as a Sunday afternoon snack and they lasted all of 20 minutes!  SOOO GOOD!
Thank you so much for this easy recipe!

Quick and good. My family likes them, I don't like salt with chocolate so I am going to try to find salt free pretzels or another alternative.

Great recipe! I too used the checkered pretzels, mini rolos and pecans.  I found the mini rolos saved money and still gives it the sweet taste, especially if you are going to drizzle with white chocolate too!  Great looking gifts wrapped in celophane!

I made about 120 of these pretzel turtles & tossed 6 in a celophane bag & stapled on a holiday label made out of cardstock (check out paper-source.com for a great how to!). It's a great add on to a smaller christmas gift! Instead of topping with pecan halves, I topped the chocolate with plain almonds! Delicious. The perfect combination of salty & sweet.

These are excellent!  I couldn't stop eating them.  They were supposed to be for my Christmas cookie trays, but...needless to say, not very many made it to the trays.

These are awesome.  I have been making them for a few years now.  Why spend hours on end making candy for Christmas, etc. when you can pop these in the oven and they taste as wonderful as those you spend hours making!

Well, these are good but there still seems to be something missing...I could not really taste the pacan even though I toasted them for a bit before placing on the chocolate. I used Snyder pretzel squares and Dove chocolate caramels (oh my gosh, so good) and was overall a little disapointed. They do look beautiful, like something you'd see in a fancy candy store. I will still serve them at my annual Halloween party and continue to experiment until I find the missing 'wow' factor.

These are just good, not great in my opinion. Unwrapping the rolo candies seemed to take forever and the end result was not as great as I'd hoped.

Outstanding for such a simple treat! Baked for only 3 minutes. Pressed pecans on top, then placed the entire pan in the fridge for 20 minutes, as suggested by others and it came out perfect. I too used rolos and snyders snap pretzels.

I couldn't believe how delicious these came out and they weren't hard at all to make. The hardest part is unwrapping the Rolos. I found that 3 min. in the oven was more than enough time to melt the chololates. They do take a really long time to set up so plan to make a day ahead. Mine stayed fresh in a plastic container for over a week.

Awesome!  I made these the with rolos and ended up with left over pretzels and roasted nuts.  So, I made them a second time and used caramel kisses.  They were great!  I cut the cook time to 2.5 minutes.  I didn't have time to drizzle chocolate, though, as the family ate them too fast!  :)

It is amazing how highly addictive these are! The perfect combination of salty and sweet!  I drizzled extra chocolate over the tops of mine and received many many compliments and requests for the recipe!

This recipe is a hit every time I make it.  Friends always ask for the recipe and are surprised at how easy it is to make.  Definitely use parchment paper to line your pan.  I normally use Rolos and Synder's snap pretzels (which are shaped like a square grid).  This combination works best for me.  I had to use Dove chocolate caramels recently because the stores were out of Rolos-thanks to the friends who all got the recipe recently!  I do not like the Dove candies as well.  The caramel had starting running out of a few of the candies when I removed them from the oven. They were more sticky and less uniform in appearance after they cooled than the Rolos and we did not like the overall taste quite as well.  If you use Dove candies, I would suggest leaving them in the oven for only three minutes. This is a great recipe to use with children who like to help out in the kitchen!

Very easy to make and I do agree that Rolo's work well as they turn out nice'n'chewy. Look great but you definitely NEED to drizzle something on top... i used white chocolate and "iced" on using a plastic bag which not only looked great but completed the taste.
I also experimented with leftovers and sprinkled brown sugar on... big no no! Doesn't work at all!

Very good and easy to make. I knocked about 80 out in no time. Going to put them in christmas baskets with cookies, wine, etc I made. I preferred the Dove chocolates vs the Rolo's. And I tried both. I also had my husband taste test and he said the Rolo's were salty tasting. The Rolo's also started leaning on the pretzel and melted all over, didnt come out as pretty as the Dove's.

Easy-peasy recipe! Great to make for a quick, last minute gift. I also took the advice of others and stacked the pretzel, rolo and pecan BEFORE popping these little beauties in the oven. The flat rolo is the perfect little 'podium' for holding things. (M&M's, peanuts or any other yummy little treats!) Squish down with a spoon once melted and throw them in the fridge or freezer to set. Easy for the beginner and the perfect treat for the pickiest little tummies! Thumbs up, ten stars, sheer perfection!

These are really good!  I made one batch with Dove brand chocolate carmels and one batch with Milky Way brand carmels (not typical Milky Way candy bars).  The Milky Way carmels made a better turtle because they were thicker.  The Dove brand had a good taste, but were a thinner piece of candy with less carmel filling.  I will make these again, but will definitely use a thick chocolate covered carmel. They were super easy to make and even my kids loved them!  This will be a new goodie to add to Christmas tins for friends/family/teachers.

This is a great recipe. So easy and everyone loved it. I used the square buttersnap pretzles and rolos which were the perfect size for each other. I also put melted butter on the pecans and toasted them at 325 for 15 min as another review suggested. This made the best turnout of candies. I will add some swirled chocolate over the top next time because the re-melted candies weren't that pretty.

These are a quick, easy, and tastey method. The only issue I have is that I feel like the pecan is slightly lost flavor wise because of the use of pretzels and with the cost of pecans I am not sure this is best use for them. After 1 batch using pecans I started to top them with another pretzel instead of pecans and they were still fantastic. I also drizzeled a little confectioners sugar/milk mixture on top and they look very cute and taste great.

Simple and yummy!  You can use a plain M&M on top if you don't want to use nuts.  Rolos worked better than caramel-filled Hershey kisses.

I tried this recipe because it's similar to one that my husband remembers his mother making.  It was super quick and easy...the most time consuming thing was removing the rolo's from the wrappers.  I made half without the pecan placing another pretzel on top of the candy because the kids don’t like nuts.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I first heard of this recipe from a lady who shares these treats at the blood bank canteen.  I just made 300 of these for a bake sale - they were so easy that my 5 year old was able to do a lot of the work. I bought a 6# bag of pretzels and a 2# bag of pecans from Costco - lots left over; I just need another carton of Rolos and I'll be making more turtles to give to neighbors for Christmas.

great little recipe! This is a fun one to do with kids. Just make sure a grown up puts the pecan on to squish.  They are very hot. One suggestion, don't try to make more than 15 at a time and leave plenty of space in between. It's much easier to work right on the baking sheet that way you can just transfer the whole thing to the freezer for 10 minutes to cool and set up. I ran out of pecans so I topped some with another square pretzel and called it a cookie. Thanks

These turned out really good.  I used the square pretzels with rolos and enlisted my kids to unwrap the candy.  They loved helping and were able to place the candy on the pretzels, it was very easy.  I will be making these again for the holidays.

This is a fantastic idea.  Everyone was asking me "How'd you get the caramel in the middle?"  I made some without the pecans as well and just flattened those a little with a spoon so they would loose the Rollo shape.  Thanks for sharing!  It was a quick easy thing to share with my extended family.

I usually use the small square pretzels, Rolo candy and either a pecan, an M&M or just another pretzel on top. I don't bake mine for 4 minutes though. I usually just watch to see when the tops of the Rolos get shiny (about a couple of minutes) and take them out and top them. Otherwise they get too soft. These things are addictive. So easy and quick to make for a simple snack anytime.

Easy peasy and super delicious. We do not have round pretzels here. I used Snyder's of Hanover Snaps. They are a little square and worked perfectly. The most difficult part (other than not eating the entire batch) is unwrapping the Rolos.

These are a solid yummy treat!  I made about 100 of them for my coworkers to give them at the holidays.  Very simple and well-received!  I used rolos & the square pretzels.

I just made a 10 batches of 16 turtles each and put them in the microwave on parchment paper on the flat glass microwave plate  for 14 seconds instead of baking them in the oven.  I cooled them  by an an open window.  It is very cold where I live, so they were set solid within ten minutes.  I've packed 16  up in little Dollar Store decorated Xmas tins as gifts for my sisters, brother, four of my closest friends and two for me.  They are so delicious when the chocolate and caramel is still a bit soft.  Yummy in my tummy and I think this will become an annual thing for me.

Made these guys in a double batch last night. They didn’t have the pretzel squares, so I had the mini round ones. I added some Kosher Salt at the top. Should have added more Salt, or buy Sea Salt. It was the perfect touch to an already tasty treat. My boyfriend said it tases like something you’d buy at the store.

Really nice!  Mine didn't look as pretty because I had to cut up the caramel but taste really good and it's super easy!  I used ghirardelli sea salt squares and cut them in 4's as this was all we could find in the local store

I didn't use the pecans, just another pretzel in it's place.  My son and I could eat these all day long.  We love the combo of milk chocolate, caramel and salt.  Oh yes,  we sprinkled them with sea salt while still warm.

My first batch was made with milk duds and I didn't toast the pecans.   I give my first batch a two stars....   My friend made these and my first batch did not taste the same.   So my second batch was  made with Rolos ,  I toasted the pecans w/o butter,  only 3 mins was enough to soften.  5 stars all the way.

super easy and delish.  i wanted Rollos, but store didnt have, instead went with the Dove Choco Carmels, which in my opinion are too thick and not as cute as Rollos for the waffle prezels.  But my kids loved.  I used a cinnamon almond on top.

The only change I make, is that after everything has cooled;  I melt a few chunks of almond bark and quickly drizzle over the treats to make them appear more fancy.

These are sinfully delicious & completely addictive ! They are the perfect mix of both sweet & salty flavors . Ive never come across anyone who doesn't absolutely devour and rave about them. They are also incredibly easy to make, (although if you have the choice, I recommend purchasing the Rolo's as individual candy bars (usually found at the check out lanes in grocery stores). They are not  wrapped individually in this form, unlike in the larger bags of candy. Having to unwrap each Rolo from the large bags can be a bit more time consuming, especially if you are making multiple batches. On the flip side, buying the larger bags of candy, is less expensive, & definitely much more cost effective.  I usually make at least 4-6 dozen ahead of time around the holidays and I keep them frozen until needed. I then pull out however many are needed, thaw them & then keep them refrigerated.

Super easy and delicious! Rolos are definitely the way to go. Thanks to previous reviewers for the suggestion.

Easy to make and delicious! Unwrapping chocolates was tedious, so definitely do it in front of the television as another reviewer recommended:) I used Rolos and regular pretzels. I just purchased dove caramels and the gridded square pretzels for my next batch!

I doubled the recipe.  My 4 year old made these and they were a hit.  I used caramilk chocolate bar squares and topped half with smarties and half with candied pecans.  they didn't make it through the day.

I read many of the reviews, and also watched the video.  The "chocolate covered caramel candies" were obviously Milk Duds, so that is what I used.  I chose to use the square pretzels, based on other reviewers suggestions.  They were ok, but I think I would have liked them better using a higher grade candy.  And because Milk Duds are somewhat small, the square pretzel flavor overpowered the chocolate/caramel and pecan.  I did toast the pecans ahead of time, as I always do for all nuts in recipes, it makes all of the difference.  If I made these again, I would use a higher grade candy and a preztel that is smaller.

It was good.  The recipe  called for four minutes in the oven, but that was too much time.  I would probably try two or three minutes next time.

Better than expected!!! I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, tried it & was pleasantly surprised Using small pretzels, letting Rolos candy melt 5 - 6 minutes in oven, gently placing roasted pecans spreading out the melted chocolates ended up with perfectly chocolate caramel goodness. After looking at photos, I feared it would become no more than a slightly melted & re-hardened candy on a pretzel.  Not the case with care. Appearance & taste are Great!  Thanks for the idea.

I think dove caramel chocolates are the way to go, and roasting the pecans first with butter and sea salt was really good.

I made these exactly as stated but was not impressed. I guess I had high expectations given the raving reviews on these. They weren't exactly bad, but not anything noteworthy. I think I'll look for a different recipe.

Doubled the recipe. Used the square shaped "Snap" pretzels. And Utz Caramel Chocolate Pieces (squares.)  Had extra Pretzels so I decided to experiment using some plain Hershey Kisses, they did not melt as nice as the Caramel squares, so I would not recommend using those as a substitute.

Review that I found most helpful was from 
Marshmay – “MAKE IT SIMPLE!!!! Put your square pretzel on bottom, a Dove caramel chocolate next, and then the pecan half. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes at 300* Put it in the refrigerator immediately to cool for about 20 minutes. Don't make it harder than it really is people!!”

I put these together and added a caramel slice and used a buttered praline pecan - a nice extra sugar crunch!!  Also, like many, I finished them with white chocolate couverture. Quite pleased!!

Candies tried: Dove Milk Chocolate Caramels -melts quickly (3 min), completely covers the pretzel, takes longer to cool, caramel is very soft, chocolate is light in color. Hershey's Milk Chocolate Caramels - melts quickly, takes longer to cool, caramel is medium soft, completely covers the pretzel, chocolate is darker without being dark. Hershey's Dark Chocolate Caramels - melts quickly, takes longer to cool,  caramel is medium soft, completely covers the pretzel, chocolate is dark. Rolo - melts a little slower (4 min) but firms up quickly, caramel is medium soft, leaves some pretzel showing, chocolate is a dark milk chocolate color. Milk Duds - takes longer to melt (4min) but firms up quickly, 2 leave some pretzel showing, 3 covers completely,  caramel is firm and sticky (just like the plain candy), chocolate is a dark milk.

Of all, my favorite ended up being the Rolos for ease of use, looks and taste. The caramel was soft and the chocolate was a good in-between dark and milk, and had the right balance between candy, pretzel,  and nut. That said, they are all delicious. It appears you just can't go wrong with these.

This is a fast and easy recipe that rates 5 stars! Turtle bites is a good name because they taste like turtles.  I used twisted small pretzels, Rollo candy, and whole premium pecans. Their good looks make the them seem like you worked harder than you did.

I won't melt the candy for 4 minutes again...too squishy/soft.  I used the square pretzels, but I think the round ones are heartier and may make the soft rolo stand up better...I might try them again, but I don't think they'll be a gift this time around... also, I won't let the pretzels touch next time...

These were a huge hit and so very easy. Worked just like the recipe said and I made them in like 7-10 minutes. Give it a few minutes to set up or put in fridge, ready to serve in less than 30 mins.

I, too have been making these for years and have experimented with several different chocolates. I HATED the unwrapping  and  a couple years ago I discovered that using Milk Duds worked perfectly!  No unwrapping  AND the caramel is chewier than other candies.  Another big plus is the fact that Milk Duds are way less expensive that any other candies.  Try this...you will like it!!!

Turned out very tasty! But the pretzels go stale fast, yes I would make it again but not a whole bunch at one time.

Couldn't be easier to make.  The family loved them.  I used Rolo's as suggested by some and they worked perfectly.

I had these at a potluck a few weeks ago and decided to make them at home. The recipe is simple. The chocolate covered carmels are called Rolos(the person who made them for the get together told me) 
These are simple but good tasting. 
The parchment paper made for easy cleanup.

AWESOME!! Tonight I took the time to make these six different ways to find out which would be best for a Christmas family get together.  I used Snyder's Snaps square pretzels, Dove Promise Chocolate with Caramel Candies and pecan halves. I roasted 12 pecan halves on a parchment paper covered metal cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 4 minutes. While they were cooling down, I prepared a different cookie sheet-covered in aluminum foil and sprayed with Pam regular cooking spray. For uniformity, all pretzels and candies were placed facing in the same direction. If I used them,  both roasted and regular pecans were added PRIOR to placing in the oven. Baked in preheated 300 degree oven for 3-4 minutes. With inside oven light on, I watched to ensure chocolate and/or caramel did not spread over the pretzel. Removed from oven and pressed pecans down, lightly, to ensure for a firm set and topped those without pecans with another pretzel. Also, tested with a few additional coarse granules of Sea Salt, but these were too sweet. Placed on a parchment covered tray to cool in the refrigerator.

These are great and very easy. I followed the recipe exactly and it urned out perfectly. Just as an FYI, one Classic sized bag of Rolos has 56 candies. 56 pretzels fit perfectly on my largest sized cookie sheet, 8 rows of 7. Couldn't ask for better than that!

These were quick, easy and delicious.  I found square pretzels so I used those.  My son doesn't like nuts so I just pushed down the chocolate while still warm.  I made 10 with pecans and 10 without.  This is a great low calorie treat if you are dieting.  It is nice to eat "real" chocolate and not feel guilty.  I will be making this again for sure.

I followed the advice of others,  doubling the batch and using the square pretzels, "Sydney's Butter Snaps," plus decided to stick with Rolos. A little over 4 minutes in the oven was perfect, the walnuts (not toasted or buttered) easily pushed into the center of the Rolo making them fill out to be the perfect width of the pretzel. After they had cooled, I melted about a cup of white chocolate chips (only because I happened to have them on hand and another person had suggested it) in a sauce pan with a little Crisco. Placed the white chocolate mixture in a small ziploc, cutting a small hole in the corner of the bag to apply the chocolate just like you would decorative frosting...to add  some contrast and the visual appeal, it's Christmas and all. I only used about 1/2 the melted white chocolate so you could probably get away with about 2/3 c. white choc. chips. It was a hit! Great, fast treat during the holidays. Keeping this one and passing it on. Side note: I saw a review about this being messy, this was not my experience, quite the opposite. Just be precise when placing the nut into the Rolo and you won't have any mess at all.

AWESOME recipe! Turned out perfect! Took some suggestions of others: Toast the pecans in a dry skillet 1st until they are toasty (not burnt!) dump out and set aside on paper towels & they will crisp up beautifully.
Also...this is huge: Bake them @ 225* for about 5 minutes. Check them they may need a little more. This keeps the candy from oozing out and you don't get that ugly white film on the top of the chocolate when cooled! 
These are the bomb!!

These are so EASY and always make people WOW! They also ship super well if you freeze them overnight and then ship them in a tin/tupperware (I use wax paper in between each layer). I use ROLO chocolate candies and follow the baking directions on the back of the package (350 degrees for 4-5 minutes). I haven't made these with the white chocolate before.

Quick, easy, and yummy dessert. Around the holidays, I try to keep the ingredients on hand in case I need to throw something together. I use the square pretzels. I also use the Mini Rolos that are already unwrapped in a bag. Makes it so much simpler.

Staple dessert recipe at my house.  Take a few extra minutes and roast the pecan halves.  It brings out the nuttiness and makes for a more tender pecan.  Simply pour the nuts into a dry skillet over medium heat. Stir frequently until you can smell the nuts and they start to turn a golden color.  Immediately remove from pan.  Trust me, this will make a difference.

My family loves them and they are super easy make!  I found chocolate covered caramels in Wal-Mart (Wal-Mart brand), and they only need 3 minutes in the oven.

I did these in the microwave. 30 seconds, then let sit in microwave for 10 seconds. After pressing in the pecan, I sprinkled them with colorful nonpareil sprinkles.  This is my bake sale item, done in about 10 minutes at the most!

Super easy, always a crowd pleaser.  I sprinkle a couple of grains of sea salt on top of each rolo before I press the toasted nut down... for a bit more of a "salted caramel" taste.  Wherever I take these, people rave.

These are perfect- easy, yummy and fun looking. I used a bag of mini tools and they still fit the square pretzels perfectly. Drizzled chocolate on top of walnuts, and that was the hardest part of the whole thing- which was still easy. A bag of walnut halves and a bag of the mini rolos were the exact amount needed. Wonderful!!

Did not care for these at all. I used the small pretzels and Rolo candies. I wrapped them all nicely and the day I was to gift them the chocolate had a strange whitish coating on the chocolate and the whole thing tasted dry and flavorless. What a waste of time, money and effort. If you're going to make these I would suggest not using Rolo candies. Perhaps the Dove brand would be better as someone else suggested.

I used the square waffle pretzels, half a square caramel candy on each and 2 chocolate chips on each(all I had on hand)
Easy and delicious recipe!

Flawless. I had big Christmas season baking plans but when working overtime shot those plans down, these candies came to the rescue! I like to drizzle with the melted white candy coating, not very turtle-y but I like the extra layer of flavor and prettiness it adds. I've already passed on the recipe several times. Thanks so much for sharing!

An easy, yummy candy to make during the holidays.  Don't make too many-the pretzels aren't quite as crisp and yummy if you have leftovers.  But they are still good!

Easy, easy, easy!!!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I used pretzel snaps), and they came out amazing.  I used rolos for most of them (to give away), but made a special small batch with dove chocolates, and of course the dove chocolates were tastier.  My kids tasted them and promptly melted to the floor in candy happiness.  I quadrupled the rolo recipe and still didn't have enough - they absolutely disappeared at the party we attended.  Thanks so much for a quick, easy and DELICIOUS recipe!!  Definitely a keeper.

I use Rolos and the square checkerboard shaped pretzels for these. I make them every year for my hubby's birthday. We all love them! They turn out perfectly every time.

I used rolos on the snap pretzels. They weren't nearly as good as a turtle and I didn't care for them. They were eaten all up at thanksgiving though, so people liked them. They just aren't something I'd make again.

These are always a hit both to make with the kids (age 3 and 12) and to eat. I use Rolos and Snyder's Butter snap pretzels. I've also tried it with Pepperidge Farms pretzel thins, but I prefer the butter snaps.

I just made these treats for my daughter's graduation party, and they are fantastic!  Very easy to make, and spectacularly delicious.  I used Dove brand chocolate covered caramels to add richness to the flavor.  Now to keep the family out of them until the party tomorrow.

OMG SO YUMMY!  I found these delicious candies on here a few years ago and I make them every Christmas for my kids teachers and for hostess gifts.  I get requests for them every year!  They're so easy to make, and the kids enjoy helping.

SO EASY-
I used Rolos and they were amazing. I just nuked them in the microwave for 30 seconds and they were a huge hit. 
I also sprinkled a little sea salt on top, because my pecans were not salted and it added a little kick.

Quick and easy crowd pleaser! My store was out of the round pretzels, so I used the regular minis (which ended up being perfect for the square Dove and caramels I put on top). The only downside?? No leftovers :(

Super easy and very addicting!  You can literally turn 50 of these out with less than 10 minutes of work (plus additional cooling time).  A bag of pretzels and a bag of pecan halves go a long way.  Each Rolo bag (which is the candy I used) makes about 50.  I made about 100 and still have half a bag of pretzels and pecans left.

amazing, one of the rare recipes that I hardly altered.  did listen to the advice of putting pecan on top of Rolo before baking for 4 minutes.  The pecan toasted perfectly, smushed the pecan in with an oiled spoon, as another advised. Amazing! Used round small pretzels so round Rolo fit just right. Two 11 oz. bags Rolos and One 10 oz. bag pecan halves and 1/2 of a 15 oz. bag of "mini twist" store brand pretzels made a total of 8 dozen (96)  turtle candies, plus the  few that got eaten before I could count them!   After all Rolos used up, I still have about 2 1/2 cups of pecans, of those about a dozen were not broken so could have made a dozen more candies if I would have had one dozen more Rolos. By the way, when I ran out of Rolo's but still had perfect pecans, I experimented with mini Reese's cups, which didn't work out well.  Tasty, but inconsistent melting (only in oven 2 minutes) made them not as attractive, plus the whole thing not getting hard again like the Rolo candies have done.  Perhaps they would get hard in the fridge, but unless you have a huge Reese's fan, stick to the original recipe because they are gorgeous as well as yummy.Wish I had white chocolate chips to mix with shortening and decorate with lines as another posted, bet that is even prettier! Next time... because  I will DEFINATELY be making these again! The biggest expense was the pecans, got the Rolos on sale after Christmas for $2 a bag. Thanks, CACKI for posting this! My 6 year old son had fun, too!

I tried Hersey's Kisses caramel filled.  They did not work.  Caramel squished out all over. Rolos were perfect.  My family doesn't like pecans, so I did cashews. Amazing!

These are so easy! I placed the pecan half on top before I put them in the oven and gently pressed down on each one when I took them out. It sort of toasted the pecan a bit & worked like a dream. :)

I used Rolo as per another reviewer's suggestion and these came out great! So delicious and so easy! What I did was take the foil off the cookie sheet and put it in the fridge to cool. They were taking way to long to cool and harden at room temp. If you put them in the fridge then you can be cooking another batch while that one cools and make a ton in just a short period of time. I'm going to giving these to everyone I know for Christmas. Highly recommend.

Super simple crowd pleaser, I added a little sprinkle of sea salt after I put the pecans on and made some with walnuts since my husband doesn't like pecans.  Outside of opening a box of turtles, it doesn't get much easier than this!

I make these often.  I use the snaps pretzels and place the pecan on top before baking.  For those chocoholics in the family I also have covered these in melted chocolate.  They take a bit longer to set up but are a huge hit and look more like a traditional turtle candy!  (although I prefer them without the extra added chocolate)

So simple yet so amazing! This genius little idea is very versatile... in addition to the original turtle variety, I've made them with peanut m&m's (color coordinated to the occasion), chocolate covered fruits, and a variety of Hershey kiss flavors.

Loved them! I made these to give out as Christmas gifts. After reading the reviews, I tried both the Rolos and the Dove Caramels. The Rolos came out so much better. Great recipe and everyone loved them.

If I could give these 10 stars I would!! I did not change a thing, they are the easiest thing I've ever made.  I used the Rolo's and baked for 3 minutes then pressed the pecan on and drizzled them with white chocolate YUMMY!!! The square pretzels are very hard to find so for those that live in Canada I will save you the foot work, they sell them at the Real Canadian Superstore (Blue Menu brand)  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

DON'T use caramel Hershey Kisses. They rupture and bleed caramel all over the place, making them very sticky. I imagine the Dove chocolates would be very good, but Rolos are less expensive.

Very delicious!  You have to be careful not to bake them too long or the caramel will push out pretty easily.  I made some with peanut m&m's, too.  Very good!

Tasty and simple to make! Instead of using nuts on all of them, I put another pretzel on top of the choc. piece.

These are excellent and extremely easy. I used the Rolos and one cashew on each after melted. I found oval/footbal shaped pretzels and they were a hit for the Pats game on Thanksgiving!

YUMMY! Very easy to make and great tasting. I used rolo candy, I used pecans and also pushed red and green m&m's on some for those that do not like nuts.

I didn't think I'd like the pecans but once I popped the first one in my mouth, I was ready to eat them all!  I loved smushing the pecans into the warm Rolos, too!  These are delicious and easy!

we live in europe but i needed a nice, quick sweet for a Christmas party! i used Riesen caramel chocolates in the place of Rolos...cut them in half.  i also used walnuts in the place of pecans.  They were a HUGE hit, and everyone had me write the recipe down, so that they could make them at home! It was so simple, yet they were so cute and delicious! All of my Slovak friends love the name of them too!

Just made them and agree with all the reviews. Super easy. I used the Dove chocolate caramels and the small waffle shaped pretzels. I tripled the recipe and I don't think they are going to last until company comes.

These are my absolute favorite treat to make for the holidays.  They are so easy and my son can help me out at every stage.  I like to "fancy them up" by drizzling melted white chocolate across the whole tray to add some color to the treats.  LOVE THEM!

When I made these for an event, I followed a couple of reviewers' reccomendations:  I baked for only 3 minutes, made a double batch, and drizzled them with white chocolate.  Not only did everyone love them, but some thought I bought them rather than made them since they looked like a gourmet treat!  And could they be any easier?  NO!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum!  I definitely think they would have been even more excellent having toasted the pecans first.  And the possibilities are endless.  Rolos with M&Ms and Pumpkin Spice Kisses with toasted pecan are two of our faves.  I'd use either the circle pretzels available around the holidays, or the square grid pretzels next time.

I made my first batch with Rolos and they turned out OK, but the taste was rather bland. I next tried using Werther caramel filled milk chocolates and that taste was much richer. I used regular mini heart shaped pretzels and chopped nuts (pecans and walnuts) pressed gently into the candy after microwaving the prezel and chocolate for about 30 seconds. The Werther candy oozed caramel quicker so attention must be paid to adjusting the microwave time (a little trial and error), but the candy firmed up nicely after refrigerating and tasted good ooze or no ooze. Using parchment paper is very helpful in keeping things neat.

My husband LOVES when I make these. I pretty much follow the recipe as is. The only thing I do different, is I use Dove Chocolate instead of caramel candy only because my husband is not a fan of caramel. I also drizzle white chocolate over the pretzels when they are finished before putting them into the fridge to chill. Always a hit! Def something to make during the holidays!

Easy to make, and nice looking. However, the caramel/chocolate was extremely hard to chew. Yummy though!

I made these for a bake sale and sold 5 for $2. I had someone buy every bag! Perfect combination of sweet and salty. I used square pretzels with Rolos.

Very delicious snack! I remember seeing some of these at a work pitch-in. They were certainly a  hit! Very simple and easy to consume. I used the Snyders square pretzels, rolos and pecans & almonds (ran out of pecans). Set oven to 250 and put in for 3 mins with the nuts on top already. A nice salty/sweet combo!

I used Dove chocolates instead of Rolo's, and they were amazing.  These are so fast and easy to make, and everyone loved them.  Next time I will try Rolo's though because they are cheeper.

I just took the last batch out of the oven. These are amazing and look just like a turtle!!! I toasted the pecans first (put on cookie sheet baked about 8-10 min. flipping twice 350 degree oven) Toasting the pecans make the flavor better and the pecan crispier, it just adds more flavor to this recipe. I used Snyder's  "snaps" pretzels they are square with a checkerboard shape, the worked perfect! I also used rolos and they worked awesome as well! Once I took them out of the oven I popped them in the freezer for about 10 min. just to help cool them down. These are wonderful!!! I will be making them for years to come :) Thanks for a great recipe.

Cheap. Fast. Easy. Neat.  The hardest part is opening all the Rolos.  And maybe remembering to hide a few so you have some leftover.

Guess I'll add my 5 stars to the 560 already here but they are so simple yet so good.  I didn't have pecan halves but did have some chopped ones so I baked for about 4 minutes without the nuts then pressed in the chopped pecans.  A little messy but I can lick my fingers just fine!  Popped them into the oven again for about 1 minutes and then into the fridge for about 30 minutes.  Perfect little gems of goodness.  Thanks for this recipe Cacki!

One of our very favorite treats that we make over the holidays.  For school, we pressed green and red m&m's on top instead of the pecans, but for sure the pecans are our favorite!  The sweet, crunchy, salty, chewyness can't be beat!

Used Dove pieces and the square pretzels,  had trouble keeping the candy on once they cooled even though I pressed down as far as I could without popping out the caramel.

Delicious, easy and disappear fast....but if over cooked the carmel boils out of the chocolate...still taste good but don't look as nice. I have also used plain caramels and drizzled melted chocolate over top....Everyone loves them....

I had difficulty finding chocolate covered caramels, so I melted chocolate chips and drizzled it over them.  They were a big hit!

These were incredibly easy and delicious. They disappeared faster than the more complicated candies and cookies that I made for the holidays this year.

These were excellent "cookies" and couldn't be easier.  Be sure that they sit at room temperature for quite a while prior to serving so people don't break a tooth!

These turtles rock my world. I couldn't stay out of them! Putting a blob of white chocolate on top makes them extra tasty and gives them a more appealing look. YUM!

I love these!  They are super easy and quick, and my 4 year old loved to help me-No messes!  They are really good with mini-milky ways too, you just have to leave them in the oven a bit longer for the caramel/nouget to get soft.  Enjoy!

Yum.. I really liked these.  What a great idea to use rolo's for the chocolate/carmel portion.  I liked it with the pecan, but as some of my family members don't like pecans, we also topped some with roasted almonds and some with peanut butter m&m's... all were very good!

Great and so-o-o easy!  I don't enjoy spending a lot of time on making treats for the holidays, so this recipe was something I could put together quickly for the chocolate lovers in my family.  This may become a new holiday tradition in our house!

I always look at the reviews - so I did take the suggestion for my first batch and used Dove square chocolates - they were a mess - even at 3 minutes they oozed everywhere.  So my second batch I used ROLOS and they came out perfectly! I think 4 minutes was plenty!  Thank you -delicious!

Very easy & tasty holiday candy recipe.  I used pecan bits instead of halves because that's all I had - toasted them in butter on the stovetop for a few minutes,then salted, and sprinkled the pretzel/rolo towers with toasted pecans before baking for 5 minutes.  After baking, I pressed the top with a buttered spoon, added extra pecans to some and drizzled melted butterscotch chips (with a touch of shortening) on some.  Threw them in the fridge for 20 minutes & they were hard.  Delicious combo of salty/buttery/sweet in about half hour total time!

These were extremely easy and quick to prepare.  They added variety of texture, taste and look to my Christmas cookie gift trays, and received numerous compliments.  I made 2 double batches, using the pretzel squares and Dove chocolates that others recommended. They fit perfectly together.  Thank you, Cacki, for a great idea!

Very easy to make, they were a huge hit in my house.  I prefer them with candied or roasted pecans on top, it adds a little extra sweet to the treat.  for christmas i finished them off with some green frosting drizzled across the top

Great recipe!!! I put the pecans in the microwave for a few minutes to give them a crunch. I cooked them on 200 instead of 300 for the four minutes, in my oven that was the perfect temp. and time.  I made these for christmas and put peanut butter on top and then dipped them in chocolate.  Everyone loved them and kept asking how I did the caramel.  They did not have a clue that it was rollos.

I had my 5 year old and 10 year old make them.  They made a lot more than 20 in just a few minutes.  We used rolo candies and waffle shaped pretzels.  It could not have been easier and clean up was a snap. They are sweet and salty, a bit rich, and totally delicious!  They keep well in the fridge and taste great cold

I also used rolos and regular mini pretzels and these tasted good.  I used cashews instead of pecans, I didn't toast them I just stuck them on top.  I wanted these really caramel-y so I tried this with sugar babies first, it did not work at all.  I would stick with a chocolately/caramely candy for the best results.

These are great and very easy to make.  I used Dove Carmels and cooked them at 275 for 3 minutes.  I found cooking them at a higher temp and longer just make the carmel run.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Yes!! An easy candy recipe! You can use any tiny pretzel, doesn't have to be round. A rolo bag has 56 candies in it so make 56 of these things. And, if serving to anti-nut folks, put 3 m&m's on top instead of the pecan!

I made these last night using Doves and putting the pecans on before backing.  I took them out at 3 min. and pressed the pecans slightly.  Caramel came out of all of them.  Are the rolos better to use or do they leak too?

DANGEROUS.  I made these wiith mini pretzel twists dipped in chocolate and sprinkled chopped pecans on top.  Then I drizzled carmel sauce on top (the sauce will not totally dry tho).  That's just what I had on hand.  Excellent and dangerous to have in the house......

Quick & Easy and way cheaper than the store bought Turtles! I used the Snap Pretzels & Rolos! I assembled everything at one time so the pecans would be nice and toasted! Followed the 300 degree for 4 minutes and it was PERFECT!! I also stuck them in the fridge for around 30 minutes to hurry the cooling process. I made as many as I could get onto one pan and they were gone in no time!! Thanks for the EXCELLENT recipe! Will make for Christmas plates and many times for my family!!

These couldn't be easier and they were a huge hit.  I did the square snap pretzels with Rolos and toasted pecans.  I think for Christmas I will try to replace the pecans with Xmas peanut M&M's.  I left some home and brought some to work.  They all disappeared in no time.

Easy and amazing! My daughter is learning to cook and loved this recipe b/c it was easy and elegant. We drizzeled ours with white chocolate. Perfect! You'll need to make more than 20 though! These disappear quickly!

Very good! I used square pretzels, caramel Dove candies and instead of pecans I stuck a peanut butter m&m on top. They are so cute.

I love these! To give them an extra boost I drizzle melted peanut butter over the tops. Either way, they are delicious.

These were a bit tedious to make and mine didn't turn out as pretty as the picture, but after my guests and I devoured them I have to give them 5 stars. I used waffle pretzels and rolos, and topped with crushed peanuts instead of pecans.

everyone loves them. so quick and easy to make even small batches in the toaster oven. for people who don't like nuts, you can top with another pretzel which adds a little more salt to offset the sweetness of the rolo.

Made them for a party when I didn't have a lot of time, and they were a hit.  Some things I would try differently next time would be to put them in the oven for less time and to refrigerate them after I added the pecans.  They were really melty, so they were a little sticky when people were trying to eat them.  Very tasty though.

I work at a retirement home, and have a little cooking group and we made these today. Everyone loved them and they were so easy for the residents to make. I made Caramel Frosting I from this site and drizzled that on top of them. Great stuff!

I made these at Christmas with my 2-year old daughter. I followed some other suggestions and used the Dove caramels and the snap, or "windowpane" pretzels, which fit together perfectly. I also pre-toasted the pecans. Using the Dove chocolates does not make for a cheap project, but it does taste wonderful. This also fit my daughter's skill-level (fit square chocolate on square pretzel) and attention span.

Neat idea. I used Riessen brand which I wouldn't suggest doing as the caramel became extremely difficult to bite through once fully cooled. I will make these again but next time I will use caramel filled Hershey kisses.

Great recipe.  VERY easy and a hit!  I drizzled melted white chocolate over top.  Triple the recipe and take it to a cookie exhange and parties for gifts.  Also and quick item to do for last minute dessert to bring to a meeting, party or book club.

These are so good and so easy and SO addictive!!  Love the sweet/salty combo.  I like to add a seasonal M&M on top of half of the batch instead of the pecan for something different.  These have become a family favorite!

I make these every Christmas. One year I was invited to a cookie exchange & knew that there are a lot of the same cookies taken to these, so I thought "Why not?" and took these instead! I had typed out and copied the recipe to attach to my little bags each containing a dozen...what a hit! Ladies called me all the next week telling me how their family all enjoyed it!

SO easy and a huge hit at our superbowl party...I made two large cookies sheets of them and they are ALL gone. I used the butter flavored pretzel snaps, rolos and baked with the pecan on top of the rolo and pushed down when they came out. YUM!

The best and easiest treat by far!! This gets rave reviews every time I make it. I find using whole wheat "window pane" style pretzel is best. If you can only find the bags of mini Rolos, just use two per pretzel.

Came across this recipe just in time for Christmas cookie tins.  So easy, the children can make them.  We probably made at least 6 batches over the holidays.  They were a hit with everyone who tasted them.  Rolos work the best for the choice of caramels. For those who don't like pecans, we did some with an M&M pressed into the top, but the pecans are the best.  Be sure to use parchement paper or a silicon liner, and do not press down too hard when putting the pecan half on top.  I shared this reciped with friends and family and I know that many of them have also passed it on to others.  It was our best new recipe of the season.

This recipe was such a big hit this past Christmas.  Everyone loved them.  I used snaps(Snyder brand) pretzels.  They were perfect for this recipe.  My daughters begged me to make more after Christmas.  I ended up filling up one cookie sheet with pretzels which used up about 2 packages of Rolo's candies.  Thanks for sharing this one!

i tried these with caramel kisses, because they were less expensive than rolos, but they wobbled when trying to put them in the oven.  will probably try with rolos next time.  also used two pecan halves per turtle, which also added to the wobble factor, so will try with pretzel next time.  these were great!

These are super easy to make and taste delicious! I did what others suggested and used Dove caramels, square pretzels, place pecan on top before placing in oven, finished by drizzling with white chocolate.

I made these to take for my family's christmas party.  This was by far the easiest dessert I have ever made.  I loved the salty crunchy taste of the pretzel mixed with the sweet chewy taste of the Rolo.  Everyone loved them.  My only regret was I didnt make more.

Super easy to make and tastes amazing.  I made these as gifts for the family and took them to a Christmas party and the recipients nearly finished them before they even got home.  I toasted the pecans and then put them on the chocolates before sticking them in the oven.  After I took them out of the oven, I then pressed the pecans to squish the candy down a bit.

Easy to make and tastes really good. My 12-year old son and I made this as a Christmas giveaway. 

I baked using Dove and Rolos. While the Dove tasted better and smoother, Rolos is cheaper so if you are making a lot, use Rolos instead.

I put a few of the turtle pretzels in nice small plastic bags with ribbons with Christmas label stickers to make it look nice as a Christmas gifts.

I love these! I think 3 min. at 350º is best. Toasting the pecans is a must & to top these off I lightly sprinkle a nice coarse salt over while they're still warm & gooey... Delicious!

Quick, easy, and GREAT! I followed some of the other suggestions.  Put the pecan on first so it toasted a little and drizzled with white chocolate. I stored them in the refrigerator after baking so they hardened a little bit.  Overall great recipe especially if your in a jam and need something quick.  Thanks!

I can never make enough of these. My only suggestion is to lower the heat of your oven to 250, and then the four minutes is perfect timing. Also, if you live in a humid place like Florida, the pretzel will go stale very quickly so you need to get them packed up immediately. These are sooo yummy that it's a crime!

You can't ask for a better recipe than this one!  I used the square pretzel snaps, rolo's, and didn't bother to even toast the almonds -- too much of a hurry.  They were GREAT!  I bought 2 bags of Rolo's, one bag of pretzels, and a large bag of pecans.  Still have pecans and pretzels so will buy 3 bags of Rolo's next time just to have around when unexpected company comes.  This will be a year round favorite!

Eveyone who tried them said it tastes like something from the store!  I put the pecan on top before baking and smashed it in when finished baking.  It allowed me to make 60 at a time and not worry about the candy cooling too quickly. TFTP!

Easy easy easy!!! I used the square pretzels and the dove caramel chocolates and 4 min later had a homemade treat beyond compare. They disappered from our table almost as quickly as it took to make them.

WOW! These are great and so easy! I put red and green M&M's on top of some of the Rolos and pecans on top of the rest of the rolos. Saw that some people had drizzled chocolate on top also, but these are great even without anything else on top.  Made a bunch for Christmas gifts.

By far the simplest candy recipe I've ever found. We used the round pretzels, put the Rolo candies in top down and couldn't believe they came out so easily and so great!

These are awesome!  I used mini Cadbury Caramilk squares as I couldn't find Rolos.  I put the pecans on top before placing in oven so they could roast up a bit.  I also made some using Hershey Kisses with an M&M pushed into the tops...cute for Christmas.  I drizzled some white chocolate on top just to make them look a little more special.  The best part aside from tasting like Heaven on your tongue was that they were soooo quick to make and there was virtually no clean up!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!

As I always do I took the advice of some of the reviewers.  I used the square pretzels and the dove chocolate and put the pecan on before I put them in the oven.  My niece who is 6 helped me put these together.

These are great!  Quick and easy.  I found the checker board pretzels that are butter flavored. They worked fantastic. I didn't bother with the white chocolate drizzle.  Will definitely add this one to my yearly Christmas recipes!!

I would give this more stars if it were possible! Everyone who tries them raves! I like to cook from scratch and I don't mind a challenge but when I find something that tastes as fantastic as these and are this simple to make it's crazy to look any farther.

I didn't think they were very special, but everyone else at the party loved them and thought there were dangerously addictive.  I don't think I'd make them again though as I thought they wer just ok.  Incredibly easy and quick to make.

These are great for a party. Even someone that doesn't cook can make these. Don't try to make these for a party unless you can make them in advance. It is hard to transport them if they have not cooled. This will be on my list to make this Christmas for gifts.

Used these for a party and they were gone quick!  It did seem easier to use the square pretzel snaps.  I drizzled white chocolate over to make them look nicer.

These were SO good, and so easy to make.  I must have made over 300 of them at Christmas.  I wanted some to give as gifts, but we kept eating them so I had to keep making more.  I melted chocolate and butter and used a ziploc bag to drizzle chocolate on top.  This really finished it off and made them look pretty.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

Doesn't have to be square pretzels.  The small heart-shaped ones work just as well, if not better, because the Rolo is round.

This is a perfect little treat!  I used the square pretzels with rolos and followed the recipe.  Everyone in my house loved them...I'll be making more this weekend since they are almost gone already!

This was a very simple and very tasty recipe  The only time consuming thing was unwrapping all the rolos.  I'll make again!!!

These are so good!  I also preroasted the pecans in the oven for a few minutes, makes the candy taste just like the "professional" turtles from the store.  And I would advise you to double the recipe, between me and the kids, we went through the first batch real quick!

These are amazing. In five minutes you can make about 24. I tried putting the whole thing together with the pecan, but they fell over in the oven. It is just as easy to add the pecans later, that way you can push the caramel more to the center of the pretzel. I will be making these for Easter and Halloween and Thanksgiving and Christmas. These are wonderful, only problem, can't stop eating. I did add a drizzle of white chocolate for presentation. Thanks for a great recipe.

The hardest part about these was finding the Rolo's...and not eating them all myself!  Saltine toffee crunch used to be our so-easy-but-so-good Christmas candy recipe, but this has replaced it for me.  Incredibly easy and incredibly good!

Very good, tried 5 min. in oven with pecan on top.  The rolo was melted too much and the nut slid off to the side.  I'll try the other method and place the nut on top after the oven.

I used the square "butter snap" pretzels, Dove chocolate covered carmels, and added the pecan before putting in the oven.  These tasted really good and were quite popular with the inlaws on Christmas Eve.

Fun and very yummy....gave these out as extra little gifts this year. Used little pretzel twists, plain caramels(which are such a pain to unwrap!), once the carmels began to melt, I removed from the oven and placed some melted semi-sweet chocolate on them and pressed in a pecan half, cooled in the freezer, and made into extra Christmas treats. Thanks for a great and simple confection!

Amazingly easy and disappear in minutes! I use the tube of Rolos located by the Hershey bars, rather than bag-much less unwrapping that way. The small square butter pretzels (Snyder's in our area) work out great for these.

Very good, simple to make and look nice too!. As someone else suggested double the recipe or even triple it. They won't last long. I did toast the pecans first and I'm glad I did.

I used this recipe today for my Christmas baskets. GREAT! It was the easiest thing in the baskets to put together. But beware... if your making these for gifts you'll want some for yourself. My husband sampled one & then kept sneaking them all day. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are delicious!! They are also sooo easy. I did like a few others & stacked everything together before baking. This didn't work very well for me. The pecans slid off. I think after 4 mins the Rolos were almost too melted. I will try again sometime(soon) with only 3 mins baking and put the pecans on after.

what can I say that hasn't already been said?  These are great.  I made 1 batch with rolos and 1 batch with milky way carmels.  both worked good with the square shaped pretzels but I think the rolos were just a little prettier looking.  Thanks and Merry Christmas!

I needed a new treat idea for my goodie plates we give to neighbors for Christmas - this is it! They are so EASY and Delish!  I did stack them up all at one time - need a steady hand to get them in the oven without any pecan halves fallin off - but these are a KEEPER!

I have now made this recipe 6 times in the last week. I have given away all but 20 of them and they have been very well received. I found Holiday Pretzels and out of the various shapes, the bells, stars and Christmas trees work the best. I took another's suggestion and used both Rolos and Dove w/Caramel. The Dove candies worked best on the bigger bells. I also toasted the pecans before adding to the turtles. Gave them a nice toasted and crunchy bite.

EXCELLENT! Would give it 6 stars just for being so easy- just what I need around the holidays. I tripled my recipe to utilize as many ($$$)pecans as possible. I used 3 bags of Dove  chocolates with caramel(soooooo good and creamy!!). I added the pecans (before cooking) to make it quicker for pushing into the chocolate. Cooked it for 3 min (5 min would of been way too long for me) . Drizzled chocolate on top like another reviewer, just because I liked the presentation. Makes a nice addition to the basket of cookies I'm giving to co-workers. Thank you for the easy and yummy recipe!!

These are spectacular! I cannot make them as fast as I am eating them! I used the square/checkerboard pretzels with rolos and pecans- SOOOOOO GOOD! I also used raw almonds when I ran out of pecans, but it was not as tasty as the pecan ones. I didn't have wax paper and being impatient I made a batch and they turned out fine, but the chocolate melts through the pretzel holes and onto the tray and then you have to transfer them to a plate for the freezer to set- it was MUCH easier to simply use wax paper, but the taste was never affected. I only had to put them in on 300 for 2 minutes. They are amazing! I have already made over two hundred and am going to give them out in little gift bags as Christmas gifts for my friends and neighbors! If I can keep from eating them all! This was such an easy and delicious treat! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

These are pretty good. It doesn't get much easier but you have to like pretzels, which my family isn't crazy about.

I used riesns caramels and the pretzel turtles just wornt sweet enough, the flavor just wasnt there. They were still a great hit, and I will make them again, perhaps with a difforant kind of chocolate caramel.

I made these last night to bring into my office this morning and everyone has raved about them.  They couldn't be any more simple, yet delicious.  I should have made an extra tray since they disappeared so quickly.  I did roast the pecans with some melted butter per another review and will do that again.

These were great, and very easy to make.  I didn't have parchment paper, so I lined the baking sheets with wax paper, then transferred the sheet to the freezer for a couple of minutes, after adding the pecans.   It worked just fine.

I have used both the traditional chocolate covered carmel which is gooey and the Dove's chocolate covered carmel which is smaller and not as gooey. Either way, you can't go wrong. Roasted the pecans at 350 for 10-15 minutes before using in recipe. Lightly toss the pecans before roasting with pecan liqueur for added taste. Also, try allrecipes sugar coated pecans for the pecans in this recipe. Adds a nice sweetness before crunching into the carmel and pretzel.

This was soooo easy and fast!  I looked everywhere for a turtle candy recipe to make for Christmas for my mom, as turtles are her favorite. I ended up making even more for myself! I used Rolos and square mini pretzels and they were perfect!

I made these and took them to a luncheon we were having for my niece's graduation from college, they were a fabulous success! I had requests for more of them since them.  Her boyfriend couldn't get enough of them and raved about how he loved them. Very easy to make and a big hit!

This was so easy to make, my kids devoured them when they got home from grandma's.  I can't wait to experiment with different types of caramel candies.  Next time I think I will try the Caramellow candy bar cut into pieces.

These are amazing! So easy and they look really nice, too! I topped half with another pretzel and half with a pecan half. I used small round pretzels but will use the square next time just to have more pretzel per bite. Everyone loved them!If your tired but need to take something somewhere, this is it!

I have a three year old who gets a big kick out of helping in the kitchen. He was able to do everything except press the pecans into the hot candy.  He was thrilled!  This is one of the easiest recipes I have ever tried, and it's absolutely delicious to boot!  I am thinking of giving these candies as Christmas gifts to my friends at work.

Great idea!  I went to visit a friend last christmas, and she was making these. Except, she omitted the pecan and sandwiched the rolo candy with another mini pretzel.  I took it and add this to my treat tray for my guests at christmas, everyone was saying YUMMY!!!  I love this recipe.  It's super quick, inexpensive, and different.  Best to use the handover plain pretzel squares.  You'll love it!
