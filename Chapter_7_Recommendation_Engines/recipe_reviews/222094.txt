I used FF plain yogurt instead of the sour cream and corn tortillas just because I prefer them. I also threw my peppers and onion in the pan and sauteed them slightly, but they were still crunchy, which I like. I also did not roll the tortillas but made them into a layered casserole. I love the addition of red bell pepper and black beans to this healthier version. I enjoyed this dish and would definitely make it again.

This recipe is a winner. I used whole wheat tortillas instead of white flour and added a bit more of the green and red peppers because my husband loves them. Also, I found I didn't need nearly as much taco sauce as the recipe called for, but that could just be my personal preference. The dish turned out beautifully and I swear it tastes exactly like the full fat version. I will definitely make this again!

I made several modifications to this based on what I had - we also love spicy food so I add kick to everything.  I halved and butterflied two giant chicken breasts, added S&P, cooked on a grill pan and minced the chicken. I pre-cooked the onion and peppers before adding anything else (about double the peppers), and used diced hot cherry pepper instead of red (just one).   I used fat-free yogurt in place of sour cream, added a can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce, added 1/4 salsa, and added 2 tsp. cumin, 1/4 cup taco seasoning and exchanged cilantro for oregano, and used white beans instead of black.  As with any dish like this I cooked the filling for about 20 minutes.  I used whole wheat tortillas and only used enough taco sauce to cover the enchiladas (maybe 1/3 cup).  I only had 4 tortillas, so the rest of the filling is...dare I say, delicious chicken chili??

This dish was a hit at my dinner party this weekend!  I skipped tomato sauce, onions & garlic and used salsa instead - all those ingredients are already in there!  I did as someone suggested and used cilantro instead of oregano.  I was able to make 12 enchiladas but not over stuffing them and they were very filling.

I made this pretty much following the recipe to a tee and it was delicious.  I did end up using more than 8 tortillas and using 2 casserole dishes but that just meant that we had some leftovers which was fine with me.  When I make this again, I think I'll sprinkle some fresh avocado on top to make it a little more healthy after it comes out of the oven.

I really like this recipe as a base recipe, I changed the red sauce to green chili sauce, and I used fat free cheddar cheese, cottage cheese and sour cream, also low carb whole wheat tortillas. I baked my chicken breasts for an hour then put my chopped red onion , green and red bell pepper in with the chicken for 20 mins. after that all cooked, I mixed my cottage cheese, fat free cheddar cheese, 1 package of green chili enchilada sauce and sour cream in with my chopped up chicken breasts. I spooned my enchilada mixture into my tortillas and rolled them up in rows in my baking pan. then I poured my other package of green chili sauce on top of the rolled up tortillas and then sprinkled a package of fat free cheddar cheese on top. I baked it on 350 for 35 min. turned out better than I could have imagined.

Unlike other users, I made it more caloric. I used full fat sour cream and cheese. However, I used less chicken and more veggies. I also added a couple of jalapenos because we love heat. This recipe is delicious. My daughter loved it and my husband asked that it become a staple in our household.

Mine came out a little less thick than desirable so I ended up having to heat it in the skillet for longer to thicken it up and then refrigerated it overnight and had the enchiladas the next day for dinner. They tasted great. I substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream and used organic multi-grain tortillas.

These are very good.  My husband is a picky eater who loves spicy food and hates most 'healthy' food. Even though this recipe is healthier than some of the others, this is my husband's faveorite and he requests it all of the time.

Made as directed and thought the flavor was delicious but the tortillas were grossly soggy. 
Scooped them out and used the filling and added a little corn to the mix and used it on chips with salsa and sour cream and shredded cheese on top and it made great nachos!!

I am always looking for a healthy way to cook and this was delish! I used Greek yogurt vs sour cream and I also did a version that used some of the  "inside"  on the outside and didn't use the taco sauce. That version was just as good too. Thanks for sharing!!!

This is so good. The only thing different is, I used green enchilada sauce instead of red. One of my families favories.

It was pretty good. Not nearly as tasty as full fat enchiladas, but I guess that can be expected. Very respectable recipe if you're craving enchiladas but are watching your waistline.

So how many calories is this recipe? When I convert the 384 kcal I get 384000 calories! And that is not at all healthy.  So I must be doing something wrong.

My husbands favorite enchiladas - and he's picky!  I used fire roasted enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. I didn't have fresh peppers on hand so I used canned green peppers and they were great! I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a little tomato paste.  First time I've ever made enchiladas and they were great!

My family loved this recipe! I did not have any bell peppers on hand so I used a can of diced green chile peppers instead and it was a great addition! Adding the water wasn't necessary for us.  The moisture from the chile peppers and the salsa was plenty for this recipe.  We especially loved the black beans and the combination of the spices.  I was a wonderful choice for our mexican food night.

This recipe saved me the other night b/c it assembles quickly & I had almost every ingredient either in the pantry or the freezer.  I also used NF Greek yogurt (instead of the light sour cream) & whole wheat tortillas. Family loved them and the leftovers reheated well the next day.

This was so easy to make and it was so delicious. Between my husband and I, we almost finished half of the dish... forced ourselves to stop. So yummy. Tips: make sure you have a large skillet to add all ingredients to during stove steps (I maxed mine out). If you like a crispy or browned cheese, broiled for 2-3 minutes before removing from the oven.

This turned out great. I did add a can of Rotel (we like it hot) for the pasta sauce and more cheese on top (can never go wrong with extra cheese)

Even the kids liked it! I changed to mild taco sauce the second time I made it because they thought it was a little spicy the first time.

This was good and easy to make.  The only thing I would change is baking it a bit longer, the enchiladas were not very warm.

Very good recipe, I shredded the chicken, used cumin instead of the oregano.  It took 2 pans to fit all of the tortillas.  Took about 30 mins to bake.

Excellent recipe! Easy and flavorful!! I had never made enchiladas before so wasn’t sure what to expect. I followed the recipe to a T. Other than adding some cut up grape tomatoes to the top before baking. Sprinkled a little cilantro on top just before eating. Will definitely make again!!!

These enchiladas turned out great.  As written, it is probably very good, but I did make some minor adjustments to suit my taste buds.   Prior to cooking the chicken, I used a tablespoon of vegetable oil in the skillet and seasoned the chicken breasts with Cajun seasoning  (a small dusting of taco seasoning would work here also).  After removing the chicken from the skillet, I added another tablespoon of vegetable oil and sauteed the onion in the same skillet.  When the onion was translucent I added one poblano pepper (in lieu of the bell peppers) to the skillet and sauteed until softened.  I added the water at this point so that it could incorporate all the bits in the skillet.   Then I added the chicken.  I substituted fresh cilantro for the parsley.  From there, I followed the recipe except  I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and added a teaspoon of cumin with the chili powder.  I also added whole kernel corn with the black beans.  Before serving, I topped them with nonfat plain Greek yogurt and fresh cilantro.  I served them with a side of fat free refried beans and Spanish rice.  My hubby loved it!  Now I have an awesome chicken enchilada recipe that I can work into my Weight Watchers program.   Whoo-hoo! :)

I've made this 3 times, and my family loves it.  I like the fact that it doesn't use canned soup for the base.  Instead of chopping up two different colors of bell peppers, I just use red. I have found that I need to use two 9 x 13 inch baking pans to fit all 8 tortillas without crowding them.  After examining the nutrition labels on the tortilla bags, I found that the "Carb Balance" variety from Mission is excellent.  If you don't have shredded reduced fat cheddar cheese, then shredded reduced fat cheddar jack works just as well.  For the chicken breast, I have used a $4.99 rotisserie chicken from Costco, and it was very easy to get all the meat off it after it got very cold in the refrigerator.  Chopping up the  onion and bell pepper at the start of the week and keeping them in airtight containers in the produce drawer of the fridge is a real time saver.   I am going to pre-measure the parsley, oregano, black pepper, and chili powder and keep them in small zip-lock bags to make meal prep faster.  For the 12 ounce jar of taco sauce, try a variety of products to find the one that has the desired thickness for you and your family because some products are much thinner than others.  Whole Foods has a very good jarred enchilada sauce.  Thank you very much for such a terrific recipe, MakeItHealthy!

These are fantastic!!  Only change I made was to use red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Next time I make this, I won't add the water... it wasn't needed and there was a lot of extra liquid.  But it got rave reviews and everyone wanted seconds!  This recipe is a keeper!

I will make this many more times!!  It's healthy, fairly cheap and easy to make.  I made yellow rice to go with the enchiladas, so you could potentially and comfortably feed eight people. I made a few minor adjustments.  I used a jar of chunky salsa in place of the water, tomato sauce, onion and peppers.  I also added a half teaspoon of ground cumin and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper for a little heat.  I used about one cup of stuffing per tortilla.  It was a little difficult to roll, so I used a scrapper to help keep the stuffing in place while I rolled the tortilla over with my other hand.  My very picky boyfriend enjoyed these so much that he went back for seconds!!

I made this recipe and my boyfriend and I both LOVED it! I also used corn tortillas and fried them lightly in olive oil so they were pliable and used Ortega taco sauce. Tasted delicious, filling, and is still a healthier version of regular enchiladas.

Easy recipe- kids loved it. I made the enchilada sauce, used low fat sour cream and cheddar cheese. It will be a weekly favorite- served over rice. Maybe a little more cumin and cayenne pepper next time- and spinach.

This was good but I like my other recipe better.  This recipe is probably  better for me though.  I made it pretty much as directed.  I did not feel the onion and peppers needed to be sauteed first.
