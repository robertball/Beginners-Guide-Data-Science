For those of you having trouble with the dough, remember that this is  a sugar cookie dough.  Don't try to work it like a pastry dough or a brownie.  I use this variation and it never fails.  

Use a 10x15 jelly roll pan. Drop small spoonfuls of dough evenly across the pan until only small open spaces are left between the spoonfuls.  Press everything together gently but firmly and bake for about 12 minutes.  I use 2 cups of chocolate chips (which does take longer to 'set'). For a greater taste contrast, use dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet. 

It is easier to 'pre-cut' the bars when the chocolate is almost, but not quite, hardened. Use the blade of a pastry cutter and press down, or use a heavy-duty pizza wheel.  

My bars always keep a nice 'chewy 'cookie' texture for a long time - even when I shipped them to a campus and they sat in the mailroom for 3 days before being picked up.  I think that must be because they are only about as thick as a cookie.  As far as I'm concerned, the worst part is peeling the plastic off of the candy canes! (Thus - only 4 stars instead of 5!)

Good Luck!

I did not like this recipe at all. The dough was extremely sticky and hard to work with. The directions said to bake until firm, but after the time specified it collapsed when I poked it, so I kept it in, and then it got hard on top. Even then, the dough was still sticky and dense, and greasy from having to grease the pan. I was barely able to get it out of the pan at all, let alone in nicely sliced bars. It was a terrible mess and I'll never try that again.

I absolutely love these!!  Mine don't ever turn out bad, like others have stated and I have made them several times.  I do however omit the chopped candy canes.  I just use the peppermint flavoring in the dough, sometimes sprinkle the chopped candy canes on top of the chocolate.  It's never been too sticky to work with like others have said.  I just flour my hands and spread it, its not difficult at all.  GREAT CHRISTMAS COOKIE RECIPE!!!!

I don't know what I did wrong.  I followed the directions completely and the next morning I tried to cut these into bars and it was as hard as a rock.  My son joked that we could use them for Christmas tree ornaments!

Clever concept.  Just have to be careful cooking the cookie portion if you live in a "high altitude" area.  I made that mistake on my first try with this recipe.

I totally agree with BARB72.  This recipe sounded really great and looked good, but was too pepper-minty.  After I cooked it, the dough was hard on the edges and mushy in the middle.  Also very greasy.

I followed the directions to the "T" and they turned out looking beautiful. Let it cool, cut a piece and it tasted HORRIBLE! The problem was, it had NO taste. You'd think with all the peppermint it wouldnt be lacking, but it was. I do not recommend this recipe to anyone!

We added 10 drops of food coloring, and it made them nice and red. And, I floured my hands, too, to smooth the dough down, and it helped. We also used a whole bag of chocolate chips instead of just the 1 cup on top, which made them creamy! They taste  wonderful!

These are so good!  To keep my hands from getting dough all over them, I used waxed paper to flatten the dough into the pan.  This made it so much easier!  The only problem I had with these bars was getting them out of the pan.  I let them cool completely by putting them in the fridge, but for some reason, they did not want to come out of the pan.  I will use a different pan next time.  Definately a keeper though!

A must have for our Christmas trays from now on, these are pretty as well as delicious and simple to prepare.  The only thing I would change is to leave the crushed canes out of the dough, and just sprinkle some on top of the chocolate.  I did not have any trouble with sticky dough because here's what I did: I wet my hands down before pressing the dough into the pan, and when it was all nice and even in the pan I dabbed up any excess water up with a paper towel so it wouldn't burn.

My children love peppermint but were not crazy about this recipe.  It would help to include the approximate amount of candy canes that would equal
the measurements.

An excellent Christmas treat.  The amount of peppermint candy seems excessive but when baked the flavor mellows.  A must try for peppermint lovers.

I tried these as one of my many baking experiments, and they were excellent! I actually made them gluten and dairy free by replacing the all purpose flour with a basic gluten free all purpose flour mixture, and the butter with refined coconut oil. They were a big hit and were not difficult to make!

I can't skip these bars at Christmas anymore, my family expects them each year.  They are chewy, buttery, and have just the right amount of peppermint for us.  I usually have to extend the baking time by about 10 minutes and line the pan with nonstick aluminum foil for easy removal.  We also store them between layers of wax paper in the fridge.

I had no trouble with the dough being sticky and everything seemed to be going just fine.  But when I went to cut them, they were oily on the bottom and the dough didn't seem to cook properly. Not even my kids would eat them. Was supposed to bring them to a cookie party, but ended up going empty handed.  Will not recommend this to anyone (and told the other All Recipe people at the party to stay awayfrom this one!)

I dont think they came out the way they were supposed to.  They did look pretty and they didnt taste that bad either.  But the consistency of the dough was weird.

I'm not a big candy cane fan, but this looked like a nice, festive recipe so I tried it.  I decided to try it out before the holidays because of the mixed reviews I saw.  I had absolutely no problem with the recipe at all.  I used margarine, not butter, and I left out the food coloring and the crushed candy canes in the batter.  I didn't find the batter greasy, I didn't feel the need to flour my hands, and when I cut into the bars, they were fine (I waited about 90 minutes after taking the pan out of the oven).  The only thing I would recommend is using a little more chocolate -- my icing was a bit sparse in places.  I scraped most of the crushed candy canes off the top before tasting a piece, and I thought it was quite good.  I'm taking them to work tomorrow to make my colleagues be guinea pigs!

Supurb! To tame the stickiness, flour your hands real good and mush the dough in the pan. Not to worry, no one will see the flour after baking and the chocolate has melted. These are amazing. My boss just went to 7th heaven after having one. Thank you for this wonderful new treat!

This was a delicious, festive treat.  I brought it to my work potluck and it was a hit.  One of the reviews indicated they thought the dough was sticky.  I did not have this problem.  The dough was a perfect cookie bar consistency and not too sweet.  I did add a little extra food colouring to increase the pink effect.

These cookies were delicious! I followed psychocat's instructions, and the cookies turned out perfectly. I baked them for 25-30 more minutes than what the recipe said.

Ok so it's not exactly the recipe..I know BUT the idea was great. Which is why I gave it only 4.  I omitted peppermint flavoring and used vanilla. In the dough I used the 2/3 cup of Andes White Chocolate peppermint crunch pieces. I did have to use my hand to spread in pan. When I took it out of the oven I used a bag of Andes Mint Chocolate pieces and spread it. So I got the nice shortbread bar with peppermint and chocolate. Festive and yummy. Thanks for the recipe idea Courtney.

I loved these!!!  They are so pretty and taste heavenly!  I put 1/2 of the crushed candy cane into the batter.  I am a peppermint lover and will make these again and again!  They are my favorite thing I made this year!

I ended up using white chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate chips, which came out quite nicely.  These were universally agreed to be the best of the several kinds of cookies I brought into work this year.

These are excellent and look beautiful on a tray of cookies!  If putting these on a tray try putting them in small bowl or tupperware in the center of the tray---keep them covered with plastic wrap or the tupperware lid until ready to serve so the peppermint aroma doesn't flavor the other cookies.  Cut fairly small pieces (a bit or two) as these are very buttery and rich.  Enjoy!

These were very good.  The only change I would make is cutting down the extra crushed peppermint on the top.  But overall a great dessert.

This is a new induction into my recipes for Christmas, it's great!  Read some of the other reviews and cut the amount of candy in half, it's terrific and easy to make.
