This recipes overcooks the chicken breasts terribly. The flavor combination is o.k. - using 1/4 C. heavy cream instead of the oil adds a better mouth feel,no more calories and helps thicken the sauce slightly. I found cooking for only 40 minutes was all that was needed at 375F. If you want to bake it for 1 hour and 15 minutes use a slower oven temp such as 325F.

This was a very easy recipe and was so good! I just baked it for 50 minutes only with the foil covering it the whole time and the chicken was very tender and juicy. Great meal!

Easy, lite, and flavorful. We served with brown basmati rice and steamed broccoli after broiling the chicken for one minute. This browned the chicken nicely. Next time we might cook the rice in the juices.

yummm! I just made this for dinner and it was delicious! I made a few alterations I didn't have any poultry season I just seasoned the chicken with salt, paper, garlic powder, and some seasoned salt and i made the sauce with the white wine worcestershire and i replaced the oil with heavy cream. I baked the chicken covered in aluminum foil for 30 minutes then took off the foil basted the chicken with the sauce and cooked for 10 more min and it turned out tender and delicious!

I chose this recipe because I'm on a diet, and I wanted poultry that wasn't breaded and was semi low-cal.  For that purpose, the dish was great.  However, I don't think my family would enjoy it as much - it was pretty bland!   Instead of a half-breast, I used chicken cutlets and baked them for forty minutes.  I probably wouldn't try this again, but it's an easy dish to pull together if you don't have many ingredients laying around!

The chicken was really over cooked by following the directions. Next time I would cook it for less time and add some veggies, this was a little plain for me.

This was good, but the sauce was too oily. Next time I will try another suggestion and substitute cream for the oil.

This was delicious.  Kept the oven at 375, but I cut back on the cooking time.  Cooked covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 10 minutes.  Also, I think I'd leave off the poultry seasoning - found it a bit overpowering.  Otherwise terrific!  Beth M.

The chicken was moist but not tasty; instead it was rather bland. Don't think I'd make it again.

This was boring. It was good, just kind of bland and forgetable. I left out the olive oil, it wasn't necessary. And I cooked it at about 350 for 45 minutes and they came out nice and juicy

I was not impressed by this recipe at all. The sauce was watery and not very flavorful.  It was easy to prepare, but I think it just did not have enough taste.  And what is "chicken seasoning"?  I didn't know what to add for that.  I would reccommend thickening the sauce with starch and maybe adding mushrooms and onion to the sauce or something to give it more substance.  Otherwise the sauce is just a watery mess.

This was a little bland, but I kicked it up a little by combining it with another recipe I found on this website for cucumber-tomato sauce over some whole wheat pasta. Yeah, I know, pasta isn't exactly low-cal, but all and all the dinner was great!

Was moist, extremely easy to make, smelled delicious while cooking, and tasted pretty good. I may not make this dish often but will likely make it again. A good lower cal/ lower fat dish.

This is a great recipe! I did not have poultry seasoning so I used Tandoori Chicken Seasoning. I baked it for only 1 hour in a deep covered stoneware and took the lid off for the last 15 minutes. I spooned the juice over the chicken when I took it out of the oven. It was so moist and infused with flavor.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  After an hour of baking, the chicken was very dry and had very little flavor.  I immediately whipped out the dipping sauce for this one.

This chicken turned out dry and very bland. Possibly letting it sit in the sauce overnight and cooking it longer at a lower temp might improve this. Will not be making this again.

I followed the suggestion to add cream instead of oil, baked for 45 minutes - and added chopped up some thai green chile peppers to give it some kick. Definitely added flavour and depth!

It was good! However, it needs less time in the oven. I cooked nearly frozen chicken breasts, and they needed 55 minutes. For thawed, I estimate 40 to 45 minutes if you want juicy, succulent chicken. (No need to baste.)

Ok but I think it would have been better if marinated in the wine sauce at least one hour. If I make again I will marinate it.

I made this for dinner as a last minute meal. I liked it because I had all of the ingredients on hand and it was quick to prepare. Once it was in the oven, I could walk away from it as well. Easy dinner! I was worried that it would be bland as many of the reviews said it is,  but I did not  find it to be. I made it with Parmesan Couscous (Far East brand) and the two flavors mixed together were very tasty. I served with green beans. I baked for 45 minutes, covered. Then basted and recovered for 6 minutes. Basted again and baked 4 more minutes uncovered. I would make again.

This was nice.. but 75 minutes is far too long. I knew this when I saw the recipe. I baked at 350 for 40-45 minutes. Perfect. Went heavier on the spices as I always do.
