Really easy to make; end result was a tender brisket that soothed our souls after a crushing Seahawks loss. I bought a 2.5 lb brisket, so I only did 45 minutes for the first step and baked for 2 hours rather than three, which turned out perfect. I also didn't have enough beef stock to cover, so I poured in a box of chicken broth and a couple of cheap beers.

Just finished devouring this one! Made for an awesome Father's Day meal for my beef loving husband. It was a little spicier than we're used to, though a few of us loved that, but even the ones who prefer mild enjoyed it. Next time I'll sub a tablespoon paprika for some of the chili powder & should take care of it. The only changes I made were adding a tablespoon liquid smoke and white wine vinegar to the pan with the stock. I also put sliced onions in the pan, cause I have some onion lovers too. Over all, best brisket ever! (Wish I'd thought to take a photo. Not enough left  to take one now!)

I gave it 4 stars because the brisket had a totally wonderful melt in your mouth texture!   The flavor profile was way too salty, and way too much chili powder.  Next time I will cut the salt and the chili powder to just 1 teaspoon of salt and maybe 2 teaspoons of chili powder.

Great not too sweet excellent flavor. It was a little peppery for my group so I would cut down pepper if yours don't like spicy but mine are babies :-) we had a little left over in made quesadillas from it that was fantastic too.

Beyond fantastic. I made it in an electric roasting pan, so I added 6 more cups of water & more spices, but the juice was so wonderful that I saved it to use in everything possible.

I made my very first ever  8 pound  brisket  in my life per these instructions only substituting French's Mustard  in my 2 cups of beef bullion I mixed together since I did not have  mustard powder on hand. All other spices including crushed bay leaf were followed.  I Cooked fat side up at 350 in the beef  bullion mustard  mixture for the 1st hour then I turned  the meat fat side down, added the spice mix  sprinkling well over the top of the meat sitting in 1/2 inch of beef bullion and mustard mix. Once turned over and seasoned after the first hour  I covered with foil and replaced in oven at the same temp for another 3 hours. Was very delicious, tender,  and juicy.  Everyone loved it! Would highly recommend. Especially if your a Texas brisket fan. The meat is delicious by itself, or  with drippings from the casserole dish. Or add sliced beef to your plate with BBQ sauce on the side with sliced pickles and sliced white onions, BBQ sauce, or  bullion drippings, or serve on bread as a sandwich, or just plain by itself. Or chop meat finely  for chopped BBQ beef sandwiches, or stuff baked potatoes loaded with butter, sour cream, chives (green onion) and shredded cheddar cheese.  Except for my chopped beef BBQ sandwiches or stuffed potatoes. I prefer BBQ sauce to be served on the side with a brisket. They serve baked potatoes here in Texas with 1/2 to 1 one pound of BBQ chopped beef on a massive potato that is suited for Texas.

The rub and flavor was delicious. The only thing I would change is the amount of beef broth. It seemed like too much and had too strong a flavor of canned beef broth, for me. I added more of the rub to it. Then, after all the meat had been eaten, I froze the leftover juices to use the next time I make it. I’m hoping that it will have a better flavor. The meat itself was heavenly and everyone loved it. The beef broth issue wasn’t a big enough thing that it detracted from enjoying the brisket itself. I’ll make it again.

I am so sorry, but this was really a one star for us flavor wise. I gave it two because the cooking recommendations were perfect. The meat was very tender and tasted fine when there was no seasoning on it.  There was a very odd "sweetish" flavor to it. At first we actually thought the meat may have been bad.  Maybe the mustard? Or I did add just a bit of paprika as another reviewer suggested (I didn't want it too spicy for the kids). It didn't seem like enough to really alter the flavor much. Also, the amount of seasoning was just insane! I cannot imagine putting that much seasoning on one piece of meat, even as a rub. There was not enough beef stock to cover the meat as recommended, so I had to double that. Maybe I just messed this up somehow, but I thought I followed it pretty closely. My children refused to eat it, even my husband didn't eat much. Sorry......better luck to everyone else! I had high hopes for this, but it just did not work for us.
