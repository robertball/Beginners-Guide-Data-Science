This is the best coconut cream pie I have ever eaten.  I modified it with Splenda instead of white sugar (increase it to 1 cup, I used unsweetened coconut, and no sugar whipped topping.  No one could tell the difference it was wonderful.

My husband requested a coconut cream pie for his birthday. I found this recipe and added a meringue topper. His comment to me was "You outdid yourself with this pie". I will be making this recipe again! Definate hit.

Very good, but I turned the heat up a smidge from the low setting; too much stirring.  My husband loved it!

If you like very thick, "egg-y", custard-like coconut pie, then this is the pie for you!  I do not, so I was dissapointed with this pie.  I made it for Thanksgiving and did not get a good response.  If you do decide to make it,  be sure and turn up the heat or it will never boil!  I stood there forever waiting and finally gave up and turned up the heat. :)

I really like this pie. You really have to keep an eye on it, while the cream is cooking (lots of stirring). The only thing I would change next time is a bit more sugar, I thought the cream filling could have been a little sweeter! I topped this pie with sweetened whipping cream & toasted coconut! This pie will disappear very fast!!

This is the worst coconut pie I have ever tasted in my life. I made it for my son in law's birthday. Everyone hated it.

It took awhile-with all the stirring- but it was worth it.  Best coconut cream pie I ever had! I used fat free can milk and skim milk and it was still very rich and creamy.

I wasn't overly impressed.  It's not a bad pie, but I'm not inspired to give it more than 3 stars.

Let me start by saying this, “My wife is my biggest skeptic and she absolutely loved this pie!”  I finished mine a little differently.  I put almost an entire tub of Cool Whip on top of the pie after it set up in the refrigerator for 3 hours.  Then, I added about a 1/4 cup of toasted coconut.  Just throw it in a clean skillet on medium heat and keep it moving with a spatula until it starts turning light brown.  This pie takes a while to make, but every bite makes it worthwhile.  Another option that I’m toying with is using a graham cracker crust.  It can always be sweeter!

Deliscious & rich.  Not overly sweet.  I boiled the mixture on high in order to thicken it.  Boiing on low is NOT recommended

Too salty! I couldn't share it with neighbors due to the saltiness.
It is complex to make which the directions, as written, do not  reflect.
I will make it again adjusting the salt and rewriting the directions when I put it in my recipe book.

Made it with unsweetened coconut & I substituted coconut milk in place of evaporated milk.   Made pie with a graham cracker crust with a touch of cinnamon....Delicious!

Used a can of coconut milk from dollar tree in place of regular milk. EXCELLENT!  Will make this again and again. Always made with half and half but never thought of evaporated milk before this. So now I've found the best recipe . THANKS
