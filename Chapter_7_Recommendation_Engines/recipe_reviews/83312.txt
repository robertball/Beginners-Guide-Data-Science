This is a recipe I have used since I was a little girl with one exception we would roll the biscut balls in the butter first then the cinnamon and sugar mix before putting the balls into the pan. After putting all the dough in then mix the remainder of the butter and cinnamon and sugar mix and pour it on top.  This step only adds to the stickiness.

This is a definite keeper! I had only been looking for an easy recipe that 2 seven year-olds could help me make and this fit the bill. Still, I was a bit skeptical about using the canned biscuits because that "canned biscuit flavor" usually comes through in anything you make with them. Not so with these! They were outstanding! Neither of the kids like nuts, so we didn't use them. I don't own a bundt pan of any size, so we we split 3 cans of biscuits (each biscuit cut into 6 pieces) between 2 round cake pans. To avoid cleaning burnt-on sugar off the pans, I lined them with foil, buttered the foil, and sprinkled the bottom and sides with cinnamon sugar before proceeding with the recipe. We shared them with company who popped by and not a sound could be heard while we all indulged in buttery, sugary bliss. Thanks for posting this. Love it!

This was really good - actually better than I expected. I used 1-1/2 cans jumbo "flaky" biscuits. I used a full-size bundt pan for this and baked it for 35-40 minutes. The biscuits were perfectly done. My only complaint was that my brains weren't stickier. Next time I'll add 50% more of the brown sugar/butter mixture. Thanks so much for the recipe!

The title is disgusting, but the product is great!  I used two cans and cut each biscuit in half.  I put the sugar mixture into a plastic bag and shook the biscuits in them to coat better.  Having made them now, I wouldn't put the pecans on the bottom b/c they just burnt and didn't stick to the biscuit.  When they came out of the oven, I wanted to add frosting.  I had a container of Betty Crocker Frosting I had bought, so I just heated it in the microwave for 15 seconds and drizzled that on top and sprinkled more nuts on top of that.  It's great!

This recipe won me first prize in my family's annual cooking competition.  The first time I made this I used Pillsbury's country biscuit dough (2 x 340g packages -about 40g more than the recipe called for - so I left one of the precut biscuits out) and I found it incredibly salty (4 stars).  The second time, I went with the same amount of Pilsbury FLAKY ROLL dough and it was FANTASTIC.  I used 6 aluminum foil mini cake pans with a single layer of dough balls in the bottom and they were perfect.  I used the cooking time in this recipe, although the instructions on the package of dough said to only cook 11-13 mins - and they did not overcook.  The stickiness is my favourite part so I use half again as much butter/brown sugar.

This is an awesome recipe, and I have been it this way for a couple years now.  If you really want to up the anty, add a piece of cream cheese in the middle of each ball of dough. HEAVENLY!!!!!!!!

The topping is fabulous!  Since I didn't have refrigerated biscuit dough, I used frozen diller roll dough, and it turned out great.

I followed SunnyByrd's review suggestions and I used 1 1/2 cans of "flaky" whomp biscuits and I made a recipe and a half of the "sticky" part. I also used a full sized Bundt pan. 35 minutes at 350* and it was just right. Sunnybyrd was right--a recipe and a half was the right amount of sweet sticky awesomeness with the flaky biscuit dough balls. My boys and husband had this pretty much inhaled in less than fifteen minutes. They loved it.

I made this today for our ladies group at church.  What a mess.  Im only giving it 2 stars b/c i see that it COULD be worked with and made into a good recipe.  Sadly it didnt work out so well.  Yes, i do admit i didnt do it in the 6 individual bundt pans.  I did it in one large one and the biscuits didnt want to rise b/c they were weighed down by everything, or so it seemed.  Also the biscuits wouldnt cook in the middle.  The top was about to burn, while the insides were gooey still.  So i had to turn out the whole thing onto a baking sheet and bake it like that.  Well then it was so dry and basically burnt on the outside b/c of all the sugar that it was not very tasty at all.  Good thing the ingredients werent expensive.

We love this recipe!!

It wasnt on purpose that we changed it but I thought I was minus a can of biscuits so I improvised with a package of cinnamon rolls we had.  So we incorporated the cinnamon roll dough into the biscuit dough and then of course used the icing to top off the sticky monkey brains! Not that this recipe needed anymore calories or sugar content but I think it's great for an occasional treat. And it's absolutley delicious! I also didnt have the bundt pans and had to substitute using a different kind of pan. My cooking time was a little longer by 5-10 minutes because of the type of pan and the layering. I don't recommend doing more than 2 layers or the bottom dough will not bake up correctly. Thanks much to whoever posted this...it's a great recipe!

Awesome, awesome recipe!  Talk about easy, and talk about good...if you do, you'll be talkin' about monkey brains with sugar on top!  Today was my son's 8th birthday, and I wanted something as a treat for breakfast before school.  Working on all the other stuff for his birthday didn't really leave time for something like home-made cinnamon rolls.  These were so easy to make -- and did I mention that they're good?!  One word of caution:  When inverting rolls, do so slowly.  I'm used to muffins needing a bit of persuasion to get out of their bundts; accordingly, I turned the pan over and immediately gave it a shake.  What a tasty mess, though!  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!!

Just took these out of the oven for breakfast on a snowy morning. The house smells wonderful! What could be wrong with cinnamon, sugar, brown sugar, and butter?? NOTHING! These will definitely not last long around my house. I did make one large bundt pan that baked for about 35 mins. at 350. I mixed the white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a ziploc bag. I cut my bisuits in quarters, rolled them in the melted butter, and then mixed them in the cinnamon sugar mixture. I layered the pecans as I was putting the biscuits in the pan. I did run short of butter and sugar mixture. Next time I will increase both by 1/2. Thanks for a great recipe!

We have made this same recipe at my Girl Scout day camps for years with the exception that each girl uses two biscuits and makes hers in cupcake wrappers for "Baby Monkey Bread". We call it monkey bread because the act of pulling off the small pieces of cooked dough balls mimics monkeys. This way they can decide on nuts or sprinkles or not. Thanks for another great recipe.

Perfect!! Tastes just like Dollywood's Cinnamon bread. Use yeast bread (rolls will do) instead of biscuit dough!!!!! Wayyyyyyy better! You just have to elt them rise first of course, but it's well worth the wait!

Bravo!  I added about 50% more butter and pecans to the recipe improve the gooey factor and the flavor; as suggested by one of the reviews I read.  I also had to make my own large bundt pan out of foil because I don't have one yet. The bake time was 35-40 min.  

This is perfect for company.  Just make sure you make enough because they'll be asking for a second serving!

This recipe is similar to my old favorite however the name is Monkey "Bread" not brains?ewww? Also I use a casserole dish, walnuts and I cook the brown sugar mixture to boil for 2minutes then pour over and bake. If you really have a sweet tooth (my kids do) I also make a powdered sugar/milk/vanilla glaze and pour over after I invert and cool for 5 minutes- serve after 10...YUMMY!!!!

Delish! I used a large bundt pan and baked it for another 15-20 minutes covered.  Think I'll cut back on the butter/brown sugar topping next time. Thought it made it a tad soggy and resulted in the pieces not sticking together as well. Wonderful nonetheless and makes a great breakfast bread.

Simple and very good. I made it with dough made in a breadmaker and in a regular size bundt pan at 350 for 35 minutes and it was perfect.

This was pretty good.  It's definitely something the kids can help with... sorta make a production line.  One can cut up the biscuit dough, one can drop it into the sugar mixture and one can put it in the pan.  I think it's important to make the pcs small enough because they do rise and they could be too dry if smaller pcs are not used.  This turned out well but it wasn't very good reheated... a little hard.  It is very sweet, but not like the monkey bread in the frozen food aisle at the grocery store. That one is really soft which is what i was hoping for in this recipe.

This recipe is the BOMB! I made it exactly as written, except that the "small" bundt pans I own are only about 4-1/2" deep and are all contained on one pan (6 small bundt molds on one sheet--like a cookie sheet). I'm wondering if Sugisugi had larger, individual bundt pans than I do, because she was able to use all (3) 7.5 oz. packages of biscuits that the recipe calls for, and there's no way that 3 packages would fit using my small bundt pans. I ended up just using 2 packages of biscuits, along with the full amount of ingredients for the rest of the recipe. I then inverted the individual bundt servings onto the cookie sheet when they were done baking.

These were even better than our local breakfast/pastry shop's Sticky Buns (which is saying something!). I assembled all the ingredients that I was able to the night before, set the oven to be pre-heated by the time I got up in the morning, and then in less than 10 minutes they were ready for the oven. Twenty minutes later, they were done. Perfection! Thanks for the great recipe, Sugisugi! They will definitely be a staple in our house.

Up'd everything because I am feeding teenage man/boys. I don't make mini Bundt pan sized anything. Tweaker Alert: I used four 7 oz. plain biscuit rolls and 1/2 cup of cinnamon sugar for dipping them. Up'd the butter and brown sugar (both) to 3/4 cup. Cooked it for 32 minutes at 350 in a full sized Bundt pan that is coated. 1st Teenager to arrive in the kitchen said the smell woke him up. When he saw it plated he said: "OMG YES!" Smells amazing - took a picture.

4 stars instead of 5 only because prep time was longer than noted and they kinda fell all over the place when turned out.  didn't keep the shape of the mold.  our family has christmas breakfast and they were a big hit!  so yummy!

Delicious! I followed leslie's review and dipped the balls in the butter and then the sugar/cinnamon mixture. I also cut each biscuit into 4 pieces and baked in a bundt pan.  I made this as a birthday breakfast treat for my husband and he loved it!

These taste just like cinnamon rolls. I used Kroger brand flaky biscuits and they were great. If you use flaky biscuits you can peel it off in layers and savor the goodness.

This recipe is on the package of Pillsbury biscuit dough although it calls for 4 pkgs of biscuits instead of 3.  This was DELSIH !!  Wonderful, a surprise at how good it was and how pretty it looked.  Everyone loved it and ate it up !!!  Definitely serve it warm from the oven, it's much better.

I didn't have any refridgerator biscuits so I made some with pancake mix and milk. I skipped out on the peacans because I didn't have any of those either. I made Sticky Monkey Brain Muffins instead of using a bunt pan. I found that I didn't have enough of the butter/brown sugar mixture, but they turned out yummy anyways. I'll definitely make these again.

Oh. My. Gosh. These are so yummy! I felt so fancy serving them to my husband for breakfast with his favorite coffee! :) I wasn't able to make the recipe according to the ingredient list since I only had some things on hand, so here were my substitutions: 1 can of Pillsbury Grands, used my muffin tin that makes six large muffins, added raisins, used walnuts. I also made a cream cheese glaze/loose icing for dipping the 'brains' into on the side! LOVING THIIIISSS!!! Even without having been able to make it according to the specific instructions, this still turned out deliciously! This is a keeper!

Outstanding!! Why share this with my kids when I can eat the entire hting myself!! :) I didn't have the mini bundt pans so I used a regular sized one instead and it worked just as good. Didn't have to alter the recipe (other than leaving out the nuts, my son don't like them) or cook time at all.

Fun recipe and very good tasting.  I had picked up a mini bundt pan at a garage sale a couple of years ago and had never used it.  The mini bundts turned out great.  Everyone enjoyed Christmas morning.

Unbelievable - didn't have mini bundt so I used jumbo 6-cupcake pan.  It was just about perfect, though I only used 2.5 of the 3 biscuit containers.   Great flavor and a fun food for all ages.

A quick and fun recipe! It's just my daughter and I at home this morning and I plan to make actual cinnamon rolls later in the day, so I thought I would do a small batch of these for a snack. :) I used 1 roll of biscuit dough, maybe 3 tablespoons of sugar, a few good shakes of cinnamon (she's allergic, but likes it anyway), around 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, about 3 tablespoons melted margarine (too much, next time I'll cut back), and around 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used a 1-quart Pyrex bowl instead of bundt pans, and it made a nice-size brain! :) I cut the biscuits into quarters and used a previous reviewer's suggestion of putting sugar and cinnamon in a baggie and adding the biscuit pieces. One more thing: I mixed all the nuts in with the margarine as opposed to sprinkling some in the pan. Next time, I might sprinkle some between layers of biscuits to have them spread out, but I didn't want them to burn. It turned out awesome! Thanks, Sugisugi, for a great recipe!

This sounds sticky and gooey but its good. Its fun and fast do to. I did it during school, in a cooking class. One thing though, if you dont want it too sweet dont add the remaining cinnamon/sugar. My teachers loved it, so why not try it?!!!

I used two loaf pans and placed them in the fridge overnight before baking them in the morning. The one in the glass pan was still doughy at the bottom and a bit crispy on the top. However the one I placed in the Silicon pan was perfect. This went over well and the leftovers were quickly eaten when I got home.

Great recipe!  This tasted like the monkey bread my mom makes.  I really just liked this recipe overall, and I'm not big on monkey bread.  I liked having the nuts in the mix.  Wonderful!

Mmmmm so good!  Although I didn't follow the baking method exactly.  I used a bundt pan and wasn't sure on the timing... it did take a good 15 minutes longer tho.  My favorite part was the gooey brown sugar on the bottom so next time I may try adding more of that to the middle or top.  :)

Loved it!  I rolled the pieces in butter and brown sugar to add to the stickiness.  A real treat!

Very tasty! The only downfall to this recipe was the uncooked dough on the bottom layer of the pan. I used two cans of dough and a cake pan and did two layers in the pan. Next time I'll try one layer and see if that works better.  Definitely put the sugar/cinnamon mixture into a bag and shake it with the dough inside, much easier!

Love the recipe!  Added some raisins and canned apples so that I could sneak some nutritious fruit into breakfast for the kids.  Also, I didn't read the directions exactly, so I brought the butter and brown sugar to a boil so they just started to carmelize before I pour it over the bread.  Quick and easy!

My family liked this recipe. I will say it tastes a tad like the cinnamon rolls from CiCi's pizza. I will agree with other reviewers that this is a great recipe to do with kids. My niece had an awesome time cutting the biscuits and rolling them in the cinnamon sugar. I put mine in a small cake pan and cooked for 30 minutes and it was perfectly cooked. I also doubled the brown sugar and butter mixture and came out great.

I haven't made this yet, but am planning to later this week.  I read the review by ShawnaRae about it being undone in the middle.  I think it's because she used a round cake pan instead of the bundt pan.  The cake pan gives you a solid middle that is taking too long to get done.  The outside and top are burning before the center can bake.  Make sure to use a bundt pan and I don't think there'll be any problem since there is no 'center' to bake. Hope this helps others.

Quick and easy. Used walnuts instead of pecans. I also used a casserole dish instead of bundt pans. This tasted delicious without being overly sweet...and my kids devoured it.

Excellent recipe.  Used one big bundt pan and cooked for 35-40 minutes at 350 and was delicious.  I used another reviewers idea and put the cinnamon and sugar in a bag and shock batches of the rolls before putting in pan.  Will make many more times.

NOTE: When the author says small bundt pans, she must not mean the muffin-sized bundt pans.  I made a HUGE mess of my oven; butter and brown sugar EVERYWHERE.  It has taken hours to get the smoke out of my house.  This is an awesome recipe, and I give it 5 stars, but wanted to warn anyone else who might decide to try the muffin-sized pan approach.  DON'T!!!  :)  I'll bet it's wonderful when using small individual bundt pans.

This is a great and really easy recipe, but a big key to success is using the small pans.  If you use a big pan, or even two medium size pans, you won't be able to get the pieces on the bottom baked thoroughly without over cooking the top ones.  If you don't have smaller pans to work with, then cut back on the recipe to use with larger pans.

The flavor from the biscuits was overwhelming.  I was expecting gooey sticky bun/caramel roll taste.  Not at all.

I let my three kids help me make these today and they were a huge hit! I made something similar to this in high school and had to go back to that recipe in a pinch, because I was running low on butter. I dipped by biscuit in milk and then in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Then I mixed what butter I had with the brown sugar and poured it over top. I, too, used one large pan and they needed a little longer cooking time, but they were well worth the wait. The kids want monkey brains again....soon!!!

Yummy, yummy, yummy. Made these for Easter brunch... when my brother came he immediately asked, "where's the munchies?" So, I pulled these sticky rolls out of the oven and he said, "So that's what smells so good!!" They were a big hit. I don't have any bundt pans, so I doubled the recipe and put them in a 13x9 baking dish and they still turned out good. Some of them got a little crispy, so make sure you don't over bake! Thanks for a delicious and easy breakfast treat!

This recipe is great.  I did a few things different. I made them in mini loaf pans.  I also cut the pieces very small, about marble size. I didn't have enough butter but they still turned out great!  I also drizzled frosting on top. Mine came out with an amazing crunch on the outer pieces. SO good. Weird name though! LOL

Yummy!  Didn't have the bundt pans, so used mini loaf pans instead.  Worked out perfectly...so much better than the other Monkey Bread recipe that I have used in the past.  Highly recommend this one.

My family LOVES this recipe. It is easy to create and makes the house smell wonderful! It is a regular staple for big breakfast mornings. As a added touch, we melt some regular vanilla icing in the microwave for about 15 seconds and use that to drizzle over the "brains".

Wow, these are really easy to make! And they are SO good. They taste good even without the nuts. I used a big bundt pan, because I didn't have the mini ones. The only bad part with that was that only the top pieces got really gooey. But the other pieces still tasted good. However, I just got my mini bundt pan and I can't wait to try this recipe with it. I'm hoping that using the smaller pans will make all of the "brains" gooey:) And just a tip... If you are using a big bundt pan, still use only the amount of dough given in the recipe. I thought about adding an extra "tube" of dough, but that would have been too much. It doesn't look like enough in the pan, but when the dough is cooked it raises all the way to the top of the pan.

AWESOME!  Brought this to work for Friday breakfast... Rave reviews.  Didn't have a bundt pan so I used a cake pan and doubled the recipe. Other than that I followed the recipe to a "T".  I would recommend leaving it in the pan for a few mintues to cool before dumping it out- it allows for the bread to solidify somewhat.  Will definitely bake again... and again... and again!

Thanks so much for this post!!!  My grandmother used to make this for the holidays.  I never knew how she made it until now and we all love it so much.  She is really sick now and not able to pass on all her fabulous recipes.  This was very close to what she used to make(though I think her biscuits were from scratch and also put some raisins in).  Anyway, it made the whole family feel great to have this at Thanksgiving again.  Thanks so much and everyone should encourage their little girls to grab up Grandma's recipes because they will surely want them someday!!

There was too much dough with three cans. Also, because I was trying to use all of the dough, I overfilled my bunt pans, and they spilled over. I also had to cook them a little longer because of how full they were. That did not take away from the great taste though. I will definitely make these again.

Very yummy and super rich. I made this for a party and people enjoyed it but didn't eat a ton because it's so rich. I cut the leftovers into portions and wrapped in plastic wrap and foil, then froze them. They are great out of the freezer - just microwave for a couple of minutes for a warm and gooey treat!

We call this monkey bread. I put red or green cherries and walnuts on bottom of pan alternating them and sprinkle brown sugar over it (very pretty when turned out on plate.). Use some of the jar cherry juice mixed with butter. I dip biscuits in melted butter then shake in large ziplock bag with sugar mixture layering it in large bundt pan. Pour remaining butter and cherry juice over all. When baking 45 min at 350 or a bit more keep an eye on it. If browning lay a piece of foil loosely on top. Really yummy and so beautiful.

I've made these as the Sunday morning breakfast treat for a long time and my family loves them.  The only changes I have made is to increase to four cans and up the cinnamon/sugar mixture accordingly. I do roll them in the butter before tossing into the sugar/cinnamon mixture as one reviewer stated. And to make them extra tasty and sticky, I drizzle maple syrup on top before baking.  They are devoured in minutes.

I make this all the time minus the pecans because we don't like.  Another version I make on Christmas morning is using the Grands biscuits and I lay them next to each other in the bundt pan!  Of course you must sprinkle with powdered sugar when you serve!

Tried this recipe today for our church missionary's and a sister and there were raves all around.
I did add to the cooking time as I used an old glass bunt pan and the middle hadn't cooked at all.
All in all we loved the recipe a lot . Thanks for sharing!

Used J.P.'s big daddy biscuits recipe and made two cake pans worth of monkey brains. These turned out great, took longer too cook even though it was only one layer (35 minutes) but everyone at the "potluck style" breakfast ate them up instantly. I rolled them in brown sugar and white sugar/cinnamon and then made the sugar mix again with the butter so I didn't cut back on the sugar mix at the end. Those were actually mistakes I made but the results were great so whatever, right? :)

I would give this 100 stars if I could.  Used 1 big roll of homestyle bisquits and let my 5 year old use the pizza cutter to cut them.  Followed the tip from others and used a ziploc bag to shakes the pieces with the sugar.  Used four ramakin type dishes from Ikea.  Made 50% more brown sugar butter mixture based on other reviews.  The whole family couldn't get enough.  Not the healthiest recipe, so next time I'll try a little less butter and see if I even miss it.  So Easy!!  I can't believe they were bisquits.  Tasted better than cinn-a-bon!

I've made these a few times and everyone who has tried them has loved them.  I baked them in a regular bundt pan because a didn't have the small ones.  I put half of the biscuits in and then poured half of the butter and brown sugar mixture.  I added the remaining biscuits and the remaining butter and brown sugar mixture and baked for 40 minutes.  I omit the pecans because my kids don't care for them.  I sometimes increase the butter and brown sugar to 1cup each to make them extra sticky. I invert the pan while they are still hot so that they don't stick to the pan.  Also make sure you invert into a dish that is wider that the bundt pan because the sugar runs down the onto the plate when you invert.  Give this recipe a try everyone will LOVE it.

I...cannot...stop...eating...this!!! I used one tube of "jumbo" biscuits...and scaled the recipe for 4 servings.  Being short on a bundt pan, I used one round cake pan lined with foil (based on another review) and it turned out great.  Thanks a million!!!

I used one package of generic, cheap biscuits for this recipe and cut each biscuit into 6 pieces. Tossed and coated in a zip-loc and then placed in a muffin pan. Made 6 muffin sized monkey brains. This was so easy, and was yummy. This is a no-brainer:) and a keeper.

Really good! I tried it 1st in a large bunt pan - didn't want to go out and buy 6 small ones. It didn't cook through and I ended up dumping it into a pan and cooking it an extra 15 minutes for the middle/top to cook. The 2nd time I made it, I just used a cake pan and it turned out great. I also used 1 package of Grands Cinnamon Rolls and 1 regular size roll of bisquits mixed together. Then I drizzled the icing on top just before serving. They were AMAZING and got rave reviews from guests.

Awesome recipe! Great way to use up biscuit dough. I only had two cans so I used a loaf pan. I did as one reviewer suggested and coated with butter before coating with cinnamon sugar. With the leftover butter I mixed in brown sugar and poured it over. I baked for 35min and it came out wonderful! Husband and sons gobbled it up for breakfast. Will definitely make again.

This was SO EASY and SO YUMMY!  I am not a fan of that canned bisuit stuff, so I tried this recipe using pizza dough. I bought frozen and left it out on the counter overnight.  I followed all the directions from there.  It did overflow the pan a bit, so be careful!!

This recipe is easy and delicious!  I haven't had Monkey bread in years. I use to get it in a hole in the wall bakery in Hawaii years ago and have not seen it anywhere since.  I made a couple of adjustments.  I used 2 large (8 bisquits ea.) flaky biscuits and cut each piece into quarters.  I doubled the sugar mixture then tossed the biscuits and sugar mixture in a ziploc bag.  I also doubled the brown sugar and butter mixture since I really like the stickiness.  I then baked for 40 minutes.  Perfect!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I made this recipe in one large bundt pan.  I followed it exactly as written, EXCEPT I added one pint of whipping cream over the contents to make it more "gooey".  It was wonderful and received raves from all!  Try it!

I made this recipe using one big tube pan for a brunch I had over the weekend. It was soooo easy and looks really nice when taken out of the pan. I skipped the nuts, only because I had a few people over with nut allergies.  I didn't use all of the butter and brown sugar mixture, maybe about 3/4 of it and it was plenty.

This recipe was very easy and my family & I really enjoyed it.  My only issue is that mine did not turn out sticky & gooey, which is what I was expecting.  But, the flavor was very good & mine turned out moist enough.  I did use the granulated light brown sugar (which I do not care for), and I did leave it in the oven an extra minute or two.  I will make this again, but will try with a different brown sugar and remove from the oven a little sooner.  Great simple recipe, thanks.

this a a very simple and absolutely yummy treat. I made in a full size bundt pan and used 2 pkg of grand biscuits. I increased slightly the brown/white sugar and the pecans and baked for 35 mins. A real treat!!!

Great recipe. The only changes I made was that I put the little cakes in cupcake pans. I did not have bundt pans. They look like the cinnamon rolls at mcdonalds but better, of course. Thank you so much!

This was one of the most heavenly things I've ever tasted.  I made it for my boyfriend as his "birthday cake".  I gave it to him before dinner, and when I finished cooking to go check on him, he had almost eaten the whole thing.  (I didn't have any bundt pans so I just kind of threw it into a cake pan and it still turned out great!) It's still good warmed up later.

This recipe was very good.  I would have to agree with other reviews...not quite sticky enough.  I will be making it again though.  I made it in one large bundt pan (baked for 35-40 min) and sprinkled the pecans in amongst the layers.  Next time I will try making 1 1/2 the amount of brown sugar/butter for more gooey-ness.

Gross name but oh so good.  We call it Monkey Bread or Pull Apart Bread.  I use a regular size bunt pan and invert it onto a large serving dish about 10 minutes out of the oven so it catches all the gooey goodness.

My 14 yr old son has now made this 3 times  this holiday and perfect every time!  He  used a little more cinnamon sugar to coat the dough.  Made in bundt pan for the same time.

Yummy!  Awesome with eggs and coffee/tea.  One large tube of biscuits  equally the 4 serving size.  By this recipe's standards, a serving size is very large.  We made it it a large (white) quiche/flan dish and it worked perfectly.  We cut each biscuit into 6 pieces and each piece was perfectly covered in cinnamon and sugar.  The only problem... once the pan is inverted, all the pecans fall off.  Next time we'll try not inverting the pan or putting the pecans on the bottom of the dish prior to adding the biscuits.

This was delicious! I made my own biscuits from scratch because we don't buy them from the store and I made them in mini loaf pans. I found that they weren't very sticky, but that didn't change the fact that these were simply heavenly.

needed a bit more brown sugar/butter mixture to make it more sticky.  will probably double that part next time.  Though VERY good otherwise (hubby is a sugar junkie, likes it nice and sticky!)

This recipe is delicious.  I have made it 4 times in one week because my kids love it and so do I.  I followed the recipe and did not change anything other than cooking it 10 minutes longer than recipe called for.  Could be my oven. Thanks for this great recipe.

Loved the easy and taste of this recipe!!! I agree with a couple others that it doesnt really need the extra cinnamon and sugar at the end. It's sweet enough. Delicious.. I'll be making this one for years to come for sure!!

Wonderful recipe.  We didn't have any mini-bundt pans, so we used small (6 oz) Pyrex ramekins -- turned out perfect!

My fiance loves cinnamon rolls, but store bought versions tend to be dry. He helped me make this recipe, and we thought it was wonderful. I don't have a bundt pan, so I used a bread pan, which left me with some uncooked dough pieces, but with a few alterations, that can easily be remedied. Definitely something we'll have again.

I didn't have a bundt pan so I just used a regular rectangular pan. I overcooked it a bit, but it was still a huge hit. Practice makes perfect, and I'll definitely practice this recipe again! Thanks!

I made this with my mom today and it was great. We  could not find 7.5 oz. of biscuit dough so we used  crescent roll dough sheet. We think it is lot better with the crescent roll dough. But over all my whole family loved it. My dad even said it was better than the store bought one.

My family has made this recipe for years. Only thing is, we call it Monkey Bread. There are so many changes you can play with. I like scattering raisins throughout. You can also change up completely and make a garlic Monkey Bread for Italian dishes.

I increased the butter & brown sugar to 3/4 cup - Baked it in a bundt pan for 35 minutes - PERFECT! It is absolutely, sinfully-delicious!  My daughter was a happy camper when she arrived home from school today, and my son will be too . . .once he gets home . . . if there's any left!

I used 2 cans  jumbo Pillsbury flakey biscuits, cut into 4 pieces & baked in 9x13" cake pan, made using only 2 layers (so they get done in the center).  I buttered the pan 1st, sprinkled with the brown sugar & @1/8 to 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans (about the size of a 1/3 of a pea). Then, as another had suggested, 1st roll  the cut biscuits in melted butter & then in the cinnamon sugar then followed recipe. If you have a little cream cheese frosting ready to spread, warm up @1/3 cup & drizzle over baked rolls.

I made this while on vacation.  My family loves cinnamon rolls but I love the easy of this recipe.  So I used frozen dinner roll dough and it was voted BETTER than cinnamon rolls by the family!  I used a 9" square baker and increased the bake time to approx 30 minutes.  Two layers of dough rose to the perfect height for the square baker.  I will make this recipe again.

Made this for church coffee hour and it was a real hit with kids AND adults.  Used both pecans and raisins.  One vestrymember said "This tastes like you're wrapped up in a comforter and don't want to leave your bed." =)

MODIFICATIONS: 
 - Cut biscuits into 8 pieces each to ensure that they would bake through and there was cinnamon-sugar throughout the bread.  (Was also nice for larger group of people.)
 - Baked in traditional 10-cup bundt pan at 350 degrees in convection oven. Took approximately 40 minutes total (30 minutes covered with foil and last 10 minutes uncovered).
 - Increased the brown sugar and butter (by 1/4 cup each) based on other reviews but it was NOT necessary.  Stickiness was fine.

I used Bridgeford frozen dough bread Let rise and bake

Then pulled apart and followed recipe  Used large bundt pan 

Disappointed pieces did not stick together  I even wrapped in plastic like a popcorn ball still didn't happen

I wanted a well shaped appearance that people could pull apart

But flavor was awesome

DELISH -- and so easy to make.  Was a big hit.  I intended to make from scratch - and then the time got away from me.  So -- found this recipe and gave it a try.  So glad to have it among my recipes!!

this was so yummy! I did change a few things though... instead of 1/3 c sugar I used 1/2c and for some reason i was out of cinnamon so i used pumpkin spice and it turned out so good!!!!

Yumm! Only thing I do different is make a little extra butter/brown sugar and put a layer of glaze in the middle as well as on the top. Otherwise, the middle is dry.

This was really, really good! Easy too. I thought I had pecans but did not, so I had to use walnuts. Pecans probably would have been even yummier! I also did not have a bundt pan, and when I went to buy it, it was $20!! I ran into a friend at the grocery store, she said to use a regular 9x13 pan and just flop it over into the serving dish. I did and it worked fine, probably just not as pretty! I think it is our new Christmas morning tradition!

Unfortunately, i was not very impressed with these.  I followed the recipe except omitted the pecans and subbed raisins.  I baked in a regular bundt pan but the middle and bottom was raw after the 20 minutes.  i tried to cook for another 15 minutes but still did not cook.  i finally had to move the whole thing to a 9x13, where they eventually did cook, but were a bit dry.  will try looking for another recipe, the ingredients are cheap so it is good to experiment with.

The brains were just OK. Maybe it was the ready made dough - it just didn't taste fresh.

I used 2 large (25% more than the original) flaky biscuit cans and made as written. It needed an additional 10 minutes cooking time but was well worth it.

I made this for a brunch last week exactly as the recipe stated and it came out GREAT!  It looked good, and better yet, it tasted good!  Everyone thought I had purchased them from a church or something.  I just used one pan instead of the small ones and it was fine.  I am going to make a pile of them for my yard sale this weekend to sell with coffee.  LOVE IT!

I used three jumbo flaky tubes and tripled the sauce recipe. Put everything into a large Bundt pan. The top cooked perfectly after the allotted time, but the rest was not done. We ate the top layers and then reheated the bottom half for twenty minutes. Next time, I would cook longer and maybe use a thermometer to check the temp at the bottom of the pan. It was delicious, and people kept sneaking back to the kitchen to get another piece. It was actually my 17 year-old son who put it together, and he was so proud that he kept telling everybody how he was the one who made it!

These were delicious! However, they didn't turn out sticky. I ended up added more sugar and butter than the recipe called for trying to get them stickier. I gave up and they still tasted amazing.

I cut the biscuits with kitchen shears and omitted the pecans because of nut allergies.  I used only one can and cut in half the rest.  Shake small pieces in bag.  Very good.

I made in one big bundt pan and it took forever to cook (50 min)so everyone was done eating breakfast by the time it was finished. The outside got really dark and crispy but I had to cook that long so the inside was done. Not as gooey as I hoped for. I will try again and make smaller pans next time. I think I prefer cinnamon rolls.

I have made this twice and still can't figure what I did wrong...both times the brown sugar turned into rock hard caramel prob because I used dark brown sugar both times, that was all I had...Both times I used a tube pan and it completely stuck and fell apart as I tried to remove it, which it was warm both times...Overall, very good just looked messy...I will keep trying until I get it right...

Loved it and so did my family. I made mine in a bunt pan and found I had to cook it an extra 10 min. I also added extra pecan because I just like them. Will be making this again, Thanks so much!!

Perfect start to the day, pure sugar. I used cinnamon rolls, which came with frosting. I halved the recipe and cooked it in a pie pan for 15 minutes which worked very well. This will be a regular breakfast request for my family now!

Since I don't have bundt pans I used loaf pans. I guess I didn't understand if you are supposed to put them in a single layer, or multiple layers. No where does it seem to say that. With so much biscuit spread over over multiple pans I didn't have enough of the sugar mix to make everything sticky. 3 cans of biscuits also made WAY too much even for 5 people. The gooeyier parts tasted great, so I experiment with 1 can at a time in future. I may try dipping in butter first as someone else suggested as the biscuits didn't pick up much of the sugar mix (too dry). I think this will be a great recipe to experiment with!!

i just finished eating these, and they were outstanding!  i only used one can of biscuits and fixed the ingredient measurements accordingly.  it was really great because i wanted something sweet and had all the items on hand. i was a little leery because of the "can biscuit" taste but read in a previous post that you can't taste it and that was true. can't wait to make it again in the bunt pans for company.

Oh yeah, this is awesome!  Fun to make, little kids can help roll the dough.  I did take the suggestion of rolling the dough in butter first, then in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Also I don't have mini bundt pans so I just used some mini loaf pans and it worked out wonderfully.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe.

Made this for my Mom while she was taking care of me after my c section and ended up making it 3 more times before she went home. It was a big hit and very addicting...lol. This recipe is so easy yet impressive.

Very good!  I used two cans of the jumbo grand biscuits and made one bundt cake plus two mini bundt cakes.  I had to increase the sugar/cinnamon mixture by 50%.  Very yummy!

This was so easy & delicious! I made this in a regular size bundt pan. I omitted the pecans and while it was still warm, I warmed a container of Duncan Hines Cream Cheese frosting in the microwave for about 20 seconds (enough to make it pourable) and drizzled it over the top. It was a HUGE hit for our Mother's Day Brunch!

This fun-named recipe was easy and absolutely delicious! It was a big hit at the bridal shower brunch I brought it to. I used a muffin tin rather than the small bundt pans, which worked great. Just make sure to use muffin liners and let them cool before taking them out of the tin. Thank you so much!
