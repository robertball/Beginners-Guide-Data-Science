This was so good..I added the potatoes with a little water put them in the microwave for 15 min to cut down on the time in the oven.  Turned out great!

Good but next time I'll have to make mine more creamy because the filling came out dry.

This was a good recipe. I wish I had used a little more sourcream or milk, as mine turned out a little dry.

My whole family loved these! I added a little extra milk and a little butter to make them creamier. I wish I made more!

This was great ;)  I just nuked my potato till it was soft which only took about 5 minutes.  I also threw in some chopped onion while I sauteed the asparagus.  I did not have any cheddar so I used some monterey jack.  Very good!

After reading the reviews I was cautious of the filling drying up.  I used the seasonings/wet ingredients for 6 potatoes, but only made 5.  I didn't have onion salt, so I used onion powder and salt.  I baked them for about 15 minutes instead of twenty.  These were great!

I that this was a great recipe!  However, my baking potatoes were small and when I tried to spoon out the potatoe the skins fell apart.  So I put it all in a cassarole dish and topped it with cheese.  Worked like a charm!

Made this yesterday for Easter dinner and was a huge hit! Here are the changes I made: I don't tend to measure much of anything, but definitely increased the sour cream and milk and added some butter to the filling to make sure it wouldn't come out dry. Skipped the bacon since my mom is a vegetarian. Used brie instead of cheddar and the flavors were amazing. Will definitely make again.

I wouldn't have thought that asparagus would have been this good with potatoes.

Wonderful!  A big hit at my very first dinner party.  I had tons of left over stuffing  and it was perfect as a mashed potato dish the next day.  The left overs were delish!

I Love this recipe as is. My daughter loves them too, she's 7.  Depending on size of potatoes, more sour cream may be needed so they are not dry.
