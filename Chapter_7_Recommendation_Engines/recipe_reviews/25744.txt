Very delicious recipe and easy to prepare!  I did make some additions - I added one can of diced potatoes, one can of corn, few dashes of Old Bay, and one can of small shrimp.  I also did increase the garlic to about 3 cloves and added slightly more 1/2 and 1/2 than called for. Turned out perfect!

I'm a big crab lover, and this was still not my thing. I think what really threw me off was the chunky tomatoes. Crab meat in a soup is supposed to me smooth, so everything else should be like it. I might try this again, because the flavors were there. But next time I will do a mock "bisque". Maybe use more tomato sauce or soup. Or if I use the diced tomatos, I will put the finished components in a blender and really melt it all down and together. . .

After some additions it was really good...We like garlic, so next time I'll at least double the garlic (which I roast in the oven so it's a paste).  It seemed really bland, then I realized there is no salt or pepper!  I used frozen crab instead of canned, so maybe canned crab gives it salt?? I don't know. but we added salt and pepper and dill.  Yes dill.  My husband used to work at a restaurant where they made tomato dill soup and it was awesome so we tried it and it really tasted good!  It says it serves 6, but we ate it as a meal, so three people max along with homemade wheat rolls.  A-MAZING!!  Definitely bland without the additions.

This is a fantastic soup and incredibly easy to make!  I've even tried it with fat-free half & half and it still tastes great. I can't stop making this soup!  I've experimented with sauteed portabellos, spinach, and a little red wine. I've even tried it with 1/2 of the half & half because my boyfriend is picky about creamy soups. I wish I could give it 6 stars.

Excellent.  We are on the Atkins diet so I use heavy cream and add a 14oz can of chix broth.  The recipe says it serves 6.  It wasn't enough for 3.  So I'm doubling it.

Very simple!  The fat free creamer is a winner.  Can taste the Campbell's soup and canned tomatoes so next time I'll use homemade tomato soup and fresh diced tomatoes.  Will definitely make this again.

This was very good and very easy to make!  I made a double batch and am so glad I did.  I used two cans of tomatoes and tomato soup and a 16oz can of Brabant meat.  I did not double the half and half but added some Parmesan cheese.  I also added salt, pepper, extra garlic and old bay.  I pureed the garlic, onion and tomatoes with a little of the tomato soup and am so glad I did.  I also used fat free half and half.  I will definitely be making this again, thank you!

I made two batches of this recipe. The first batch I followed exactly, just with fat free half/half and some extra garlic. It was good, but definitely was missing a little something. I followed others' advice and added salt, pepper, and dill. The second batch I used red onions, lots of garlic, better quality lump crab meat, and added some cajun seasoning at the end to give it a little kick. This batch bursts with flavor. Regardless of how you spice it up, you definitely need to use quality lump crab meat, it's sweeter and more flavorful. Very fast preparation with a comfort-food quality, I will be keeping this recipe on hand.

I am a Mom of two and need QUICK, EASY meals on the double!  This was a wonderful grown-up meal that my husband and I enjoyed.  I'm sure that my toddler would have ate this, but I decided to give him a kid friendly meal instead.  I did use a can of evaporated milk and garlic powder instead of the half and half cream along with fresh garlic.  Also, I added a small can of tomato sauce because I thought it was a little on the watery side.  This fixed it for sure.  I added dill like someone recommended previously.  Also, I added a little marjoram along with salt and pepper.  When I served it, I put mozzarella along with parmesan cheese on top of it.  It was a complete meal with focaccia bread served on the side that I got at our local grocery store.  The only thing that I may do different in the future is puree this soup and then add the crab along with the evaporated milk or the half and half cream after pureeing it.  Overall, this recipe is a keeper and will make its way to my kitchen table again:).  Thanks for sharing it with all of us.  This would also be wonderful with a spinach salad of some type.

This soup was awesome! I made it exactly how it was shown with the exception of using fat-free half-and-half and it was perfect! Next time I make it I may add more seafood to it like mussels, scallops, and shrimp. So yummy!

An excellent and very easy soup. I used Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes to give it a different spin. Wonderful!

Tasty and so easy to make.  A nice switch from the usual plain old tomato soup.  I made this on New Year's Eve to go with a sushi platter we were serving.  Everyone loved it.  I, too, used the non-fat half and half.  No one could tell the difference.  Thanks Sheri!

I made this just as written and it was really good!  It took only minutes to put together.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to add another can of crab.

This wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. We had it for dinner but did not save the left overs. Maybe I would like it more pureed before the crab was added. In any case, the crab flavor was really overwhelmed by the tomatoes. I did add a bit of old bay seasoning (after making it as described and finding it a little bland) but it didn't do much for it. One nice thing about it - it is very quick and easy.

Very good, the dill was an excellent suggestion.  A little salty for me, but I probably should have drained the crab meat more thoroughly.

I've made the recipe for years, quick, easy and good. Last night I made it great. Rendered bacon lardon, removed and cooked onions, crushed red pepper and 2 cloves of garlic. Added hand crushed San Marzano tomatoes,  organic tomato soap and vegetable stock. Add bacon back and simmered then pureed with an emulsion blender. Add fresh shrimp and simmered until cooked. Add half and half cream and lump crab meat. Warmed and served with cheese panini.

Not very good in my opinion - I thought combining crab and tomato soup would be good, but now it left something to be desired.  Not enough flavor and too fishy.

I'm on a pretty strict diet so I had to change it a bit, but this was pretty good. I didnt use any oil or cream. I heated up my onion and crab meat w/ some garlic powder while my blender did its job w/ my garden tomatoes.  Added the tomatoes and pepper to my crab mix and let it heat.  Not to shabby.

I didn't have very high expectations for this recipe but I had hoped using Healthy Request soup & crab from a pouch instead of a can, would yield good results but it was just fair, at best. I didn't bother to save the leftovers so that ought to tell you something. I added a can of small shrimp (rinsed well & drained to remove the tinny taste), I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced & I added Old Bay. I garnished teh bowls w/ parmesan cheese & parsley flakes. It was better than fast food but that's about as high a praise as I can give....thanks for the recipe though!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I used 8 oz. cooked crabmeat from the fish market instead of canned.  Also used fat free half and half.  Although this said 6 servings, if you were using this as your meal for lunch, I would call it 3 to 4 servings. Would definitely use this recipe again.
