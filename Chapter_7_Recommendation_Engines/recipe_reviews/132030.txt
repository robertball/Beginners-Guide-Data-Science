This was exactly what I needed to make my miso soup shine. Perfect! It will cook down a little though when it simmers, so be sure to add extra water.

I use this recipe for dashi every time I make a dish that requires plain water. Seaweed is high in nutrents needed, that are not common in American diets.
I chop the bulk Kombu into beef stew where it adds a uncommonly good flavor. When using any type of seaweed, I do not add salt to the dish as it cooks.

Perfect base for my miso. I did use a little more seaweed and bonito flakes for a more sea food taste.

I make dashi regularly with kombu and bonito flakes.  This time I added dried shitaki mushrooms.  This recipe is a starter, needs bonito flakes to get the best flavor.  You want it to smell and taste like the ocean.
