Super-fabulous-yummy! This was so easy I could have almost done it with my eyes closed. My husband loves cottage cheese and jello, so this was a HUGE hit with him, and with my 2 year-old. I also made it with orange jello, which was great, too. This would be great in the summer time with a BBQ dinner or as a pot-luck side dish.

This is a very different type of jello salad. Quite good, really. It was almost like eating dessert.

I made this for Xmas dinner it's much better a couple days later still a bit heavy. My sister liked it but my kids & hubby didn't because it is too dense. If I ever make it again I might add more cool whip or maybe some marshmallows to lighten it up
