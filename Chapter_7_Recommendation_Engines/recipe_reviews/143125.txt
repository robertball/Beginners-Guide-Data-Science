Easy peasy...made these with my toddler! Yummy...I didn't have canned grated coconut, I used orange flower water and golden syrup with some honey to wet the dry coconut...I added pine nuts...I tweak things...but I am sure the recipe is great by itself...it lends itself to creativity!

I once had these while visiting Puerto Rico. I had no idea how easy they were to make. Tasty little things and not too sweet. Thanks again for sharing!!! Reviewed  during the Western region Allstar Faceless Frenzy 2012

Difficult to find these ingredients in my area, but I made due.  I used fillo dough, spread the layers with a diluted pineapple preserves mixture, and put a mixture of shredded coconut, honey, pina colada drink, and a splash of rum on the layers. I pulled the corners together and pressed to seal.  My husband grabbed one right out of the oven and bit into it.  He said the insides were like coconut napalm: very sticky, very coconut-y, but very delicious as well.
