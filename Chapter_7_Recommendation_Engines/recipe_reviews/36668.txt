Great recipe. I bought some really high quality steaks from Whole Foods which I am sure made some of the difference. However, the mushroom sauce was excellent. I would definitely make this again.

I used regular shiitake mushrooms, not dried and this turned out great!

The sauce wasn't quite thick enough for me, but the flavor was great.

The meat tasted great after using the marinade, but the finish sauce was just okay. The sauce would not thicken at all, no matter how much I tried to reduce it. I don't think I'll make the entire dish again, but I will use the recipe for marinade.

This was o.k.  The marinade for the beef was good.  However, I was very disappointed with the shitake mushroom sauce.  I've made much better stir fry type of meals.  Will not make this one again for the amount of work too that was involved.

I noticed how many people mentioned the sauce being too liquid-y, so I dissolved some cornstarch (half tsp) into a bit of hot water and added it to the sauce.  As I tasted the sauce, I found it quite bland -- not enough marinade was leftover to add to the mushroom juice.   I had to add a tablespoon more of hoisin to the sauce.  The sauce then turned out quite nicely.  I was a bit disappointed with the beef.  It marinated for several hours but didn't seem to pick up the flavor of the marinade.  My husband and I both felt like something was lacking... maybe adding a splash of soy sauce to the marinade might help?  If I were to try this recipe again, I'd also pick a cheaper cut of beef rather than tenderloin (filet mignon) -- the texture seemed a little odd to us because it was so soft and flavorless.

Very tasty, with and interesting texture.  Buying pre minced garlic and ginger would make it much faster to prepare.
