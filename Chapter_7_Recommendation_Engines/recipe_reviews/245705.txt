Very simple and good.  I tripled the batch for a church event.  Because I prepared the 3 pans the night before, I did add about 2 cups extra milk to the tripled sauce recipe before assembling, to help it not dry out.  Here are my make-ahead instructions: Make chicken and cut up (can be done several days prior ).  The day before: cook the noodles for 7-8 minutes (you want them still firm but not hard), rinse under cool water and cool completely.  Prepare sauce, thinning as noted above.  Assemble the dish per the recipe instructions.  Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight.  The next day, place dish into a 350 degree oven for an hour.  Uncover and bake 15 more minutes.

Everyone loved it!  A keeper for sure.  BTW, instead of cooking my own chicken breast, to make things faster, I used the precooked grilled chicken breast strips in the freezer section (thawed first in the microwave).  Awesome!

This is now my "go to" dish for sports team dinners, pot lucks, teacher appreciation lunches and for a quick comfort food dinner.  Definitely NOT on the super food healthy list, but it is a crowd pleaser and delicious!   Only changes that I make are:  sprinkling granulated garlic on the top before baking and making 1.5 of the sauce to be sure its nice not dry.   I also use a combo of chicken breast and thigh pieces so the protein is never dry and adds a little flavor.

The recipe was very easy to follow and it turned out perfectly! I added cracked black pepper and I’m thinking of adding bacon next time, but I will definitely follow this recipe again! My only suggestion would be cooking the chicken first so that it can cool down while making the sauce. By the time the sauce is finished the chicken will be ready to cut so you don’t have any wasted time.

Finally got to make this tonight, and I'm so glad I did! Had all ingredients except all of the Parmesan cheese , so for the other half of Parm- I substituted with shredded mozzarella cheese on top.  Plus cut pasta down from 16 oz to about 14 oz. Everything else remained same. This was delicious and creamy! My husband had seconds, and for two people we have plenty of left- overs. Will definitely make this again - perfect for potluck dinners!

Much better than I expected, although definitely aimed at children since very little seasoning.  To make a bit more adult, suggest adding some red pepper flake and mixing the parmesan with asiago cheeses.  You do need to bake as this sets the sauce.  The sauce will all sink while baking, but just give it a quick stir immediately after removing from the oven to even the sauce out.

My recipe turned out a bit on the dry side. Next time, I would use 12 - 14 oz pasta and 3-4 large chicken breasts, and make
the same amount of sauce. This recipe had nice flavor and made a large pan to feed our family of 5.  With these changes I would make it again.

Outstanding!  Thank you!  I loved the way you used the melted butter and garlic to incorporate the cream cheese!  So smooth and creamy.  (I did use heavy whipping cream instead of milk).  Delish!!!  Huge hit with even picky eaters, not one drop left!  Highly recommend.  Thanks again for sharing with us!

This turned out really good.  This was great for using up leftover spaghetti noodles.   It didn't turn out too dry because I made the sauce and chicken first then added in as much noodles afterwards to still be good and saucy before putting it in the oven.  I ended up having to whisk the sauce to get the lumps out because no amount of stirring was going to break down the lumps of cream cheese.  Not sure if that's what everyone else had to do or not.

My daughter asked if I could make it again sometime.  My husband ate the leftovers before my daughter could get to them.  hahahahaha

This was delicious!  My husband told me as he went back for seconds, to save this recipe!  
I did add broccoli into the recipe, but followed the recipe as it is.  Wouldn't change a thing, this recipe is perfect!  Will make it again as it was a hit!!

Fairly easy to make, but a bit boring in terms of ingredients.  I'll throw in a once a month rotation, as it keeps well and makes enough for a few meals.

Loved this recipe! I had a smaller pan and it barely fit but it's definitely enough for about 5 individual meals. I also added broccoli to get it to be healthier, and I used non-fat milk and low fat cream cheese. Would definitely recommend this recipe!

This has a tremendous flavor, but if made as directed there is too much pasta and not enough sauce. However, the sauce is absolutely fantastic and so easy to prepare. Thanks for a great Alfredo sauce recipe that has now replaced all I have used in the past.

I added more milk and parmesan to it, then I added broccoli and cauliflower after I cooked those then baked it all together. My boyfriend said he loves it, it’s like something you get from Olive Garden so I’m pretty proud of how it turned out. ??

Turned delicious. First time I used cream cheese in a pasta dish and it won’t be the last.

Because I'm pretty lazy, I skipped baking it when I finished with the sauce and saw how thick it was. I'm an amateur cook but was easy to make and tasted like Olive Garden alfredo, a family favorite. Amazing!

This was excellent and well received in my house.  I didn't make any changes.  I can't understand how baking it makes a difference, but it really does.  My kids like this better than when I make an alfredo sauce to pour over pasta.

I make some pretty good pasta but my fiancé told me this is the best pasta I’ve ever made. The sauce is so rich and delicious that I now use it to make any Alfredo pastas. I would recommend pouring the milk in slowly, because twice now it made my sauce kind of thin so I had to add extra Parmesan to thicken it up. Last time I didn’t have any extra Parmesan so I added shredded mozzarella and it added extra flavor I think.

I made this tonight for supper. I obviously didn’t pay close attention to the directions as to I had a lot of things going through my mind while preparing it. I’m the type of person who has to recheck it before it’s correct. Anyways I misunderstood where it said to put a layer of sauce on top of the noodles at the bottom. Oh well. It turned out really good and my boyfriend likes it so I did good.  I think next time I make it I need to add a little more of the cream cheese but other than that it’s really good.

I absolutely loved this, as did my whole family! It was so easy to prepare. I took another reviewers advice and used Tyson frozen chicken strips which cut out a couple of steps. My oldest is a Fettuccini Alfredo enthusiast, and he thinks this is the best recipe I've found. He used to say my Alfredo was better than Olive Garden's. That being said, this is definitely a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe!

We thought the overall flavor was very good. However, we thought it was dry. The sauce got pretty thick also. It may have been from the Parmesan I don't know. We didin't even use a full box of pasta. Next time I make it, I will increase the milk to 3 cups then add Parmesan last not all at one time to check taste and thickness.

BIG thumbs up from my house, with a5 year old and a foodie partner!  He thinks I may have even outdone him... so that is a win for us!  I will add more chicken for protein next time and maybe more milk, but something that makes us all happy is noteworthy.

I followed recipe as indicated. I am not sure if I did something wrong or not. I used light cream cheese and 2 cups of Parmesan cheese( one in the shake able container). We found the cheese flavour overpowering.  Maybe there is a difference between freshly grated and the one in the container. I will try again but put only 1 cup of cheese.

I made this a few days ago but I doubled the recipe. I used chicken legs / thighs that I skinned, seasoned and boiled until the meat fell off of the bone, instead of chicken breast.  My family loved it and it lasted a couple of days.  This tastes so much better than using the Alfredo sauce in the jar.

Easy tasty recipe to make. I made it for a sports team dinner as well as for our family dinner. To make it even zippier, I took a few minutes and fried up pre-cooked frozen chicken with the chicken spices. When I make it again, to save more time, I will just mix everything up instead of layering before adding the parm topping - the noodles will get better coverage and tend to dry less. Definitely if you double up the recipe, add a little more liquid.

we loved this recipe it's super easy and delicious. I don't really think it takes an hour to make of you can multitask. I only had a bag of 12oz penne and I think it was plenty of pasta for the sauce, if I had used more I think there wouldn't have been enough sauce for the dish. This is definitely in the keep box. Thanks!

Turned out really good. Agree with other reviews about less pasta and more chicken though. The flavor was spot on though.

Super easy, kid and crowd friendly.  I grilled the chicken, doubled the recipe and used low fat dairy.  Lots of party goers went back for second helping!

Added broccoli to the recipe and it was a great meal for dinner.  The family lives it.  I will be adding this to the list of recipes I make for the family.

This turned out pretty dry for us.  The kids ate it, but they weren't really excited about it.

This was so easy to make and taste fantastic, I always use to buy Alfredo sauce from the glass jar now after making this I will only make home made Alfredo sauce.  My husband loved it I can't wait to make it again....I used season salt, black ground pepper, salt and crush red peppers to season my chicken breast before putting it in the olive oil, I also added maybe a 1/4 more of the Parmesan cheese for the sauce, I added group pepper, and parsley to the alfredo sauce:  other than that I followed the recipe, I plan on making this again in the next couple of weeks.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

This was absolutely amazing.  After reading the reviews I adjusted the amount of pasta so it wouldn't be dry. Instead of 16oz I put about 10-12 ( a little over half).  I also topped with Monterey Jack cheese and 4 slices of chopped up bacon. This will definitely be apart of dinner rotation..

Very good but very bad for you at the same time. That sauce was too good, and considering that it is 1/2 cup of butter and a full block of cream cheese it should be. I probably will make again but not very often.

This was excellent! The whole family loved it. I read reviews and put about 1 coins of more milk and added more Parmesan cheese. Will definitely make again!

Delicious!  I will definitely make it again.  I took frozen peas, and thawed them quickly in a pan.  Then I added the chicken, pasta, and peas into the alfredo sauce, and it was delicious!

Just made this for the first time. Only thing different I will do next time is a little extra milk. The sauce was just a little thicker than I wanted (just personal taste). But, the taste was great and it was easy to prepare. Thanks for sharing it! It has been added to my recipes. :D
