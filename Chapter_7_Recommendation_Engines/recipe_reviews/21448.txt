To bad this scale only goes to 5 it would rate a 15!!! Yummy!!!!!! This is a must try. We have had this once and we all fell in love. The 2nd time I made it to a cassarole. Mashed everything together and baked it till melted and golden...... so good. Saved time from scooping the potatoes. Awesome! thaks for the recipe!

This is my second time making these potatoes.  As written, this recipe gets three stars from me, as it is a little bland.  These are the changes I made.  After baking my potatoes and scooping out the pulp, I mashed the pulp, then added 4 TB. butter and the amount of sour cream called for.  I added salt and pepper to my taste which really helped the flavor.  I then added two cans of the drained corn and one can of the chilies.  I did divide the filling and used cheddar in half of the filling for my kids and pepper jack for my husband and me in the other half.  Then, I baked as directed, pulled them out, topped with more cheese, baked 5 more minutes and served.  YUM!!  I will keep on making this recipe with the changes stated.  Oh, I did have some filling leftover and may only use one can of the corn next time.

Dominique, this was an excellent recipe! I make stuffed potatoes all the time, but this was certainly different and very delicious! I only used one can of corn, one jar of chiles and added garlic and onion powders and a little cayenne. Thanks so much!

Delicious! I only made 2 potatoes and they weren't really huge ones either. I used 1 can of the mexicorn and a whole can of the chilies. Very veggie but the potato flavor came through just wonderfully. I baked the potatoes in the microwave. They came out fine but I scraped the pulp out a little too close to the skins and my skins sort of lost their shape. I piled the mixture into them and rewrapped the skins around them. Not a beautiful presentation but tasty anyway. Don't understand these people who are afraid to use pepperjack cheese. It only has a little hint of a spicy pepper here and there scattered among the ordinary jack cheese flavor. I could have had it even a little spicer and I'm not a big hot stuff fan. In addition to the sour cream I think I'll make them again with butter too. I liked them a lot but hubby had no comment- not a good sign. Oh well, maybe my presentation next time will appeal to him more. Maybe a little paprika sprinkled on top for color--even with the browning they still seemed a little pale and lifeless looking despite all the goodies awaiting inside every bite.

Delicious and easy to make! I did cut the corn to one can per other suggestions and added shredded cheddar to the tops of the potatoes. Will make this one again!

These potatoes were really good! They made a great addition to our grilled chicken meal! Per other reviews, I only used 1 can of corn, only 1 can of chili peppers, and added some S&P to taste. Turned out great! Would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a change in their average baked potato routine!

Even though I didn't have corn or enough sour cream, these potatoes were great.  I started them in the microwave to make the oven time shorter.  I will try them next time the right way.

This is so good - It was the perfect sidedish to my 
barbequed tri-tip, baked beans, coleslaw and garlic 
bread.

This was everbodys favorite, I am going to make
enough for seconds next time, my wife and 
I fought over the last one the next morning 
!(she won.)

I thought these were amazing!  There were just a bit spicy, but not overpowering.  For children, you could easily use regular Monterey Jack cheese instead of the kind with the hot peppers.  These were fairly easy to make and really have a delicious taste.  They also look nice when they come out of the oven.  Great BBQ fare!

These potatoes were really good and pretty easy to make.  My wife and I like spicy foods, so the next time I make them I might add a chopped jalapeno to sort of boost the pepperjack cheese.  But we'll certainly be having these wonderful spuds again

These were good, just bitey enough-but not too much. Next time I will use less corn, but over-all very good.Thanks for sharing.

These were scrumptious!  I added a dollop more sour cream into the mix, since I had the super-jumbo potatoes.  Also added some salt to taste and a bit of pepper.  I recommend buying the canned whole chiles and chopping them yourself;  the pre-chopped are a mushy mess, and I no longer use them in anything.  These 'taters were fine for me as a main dish with a side of slaw!

I am slowly learning that when I have a doubt if I will like a recipe I just have to make it and see.  These potatoes are absolutely delicious.  I was a bit skeptical about the mexi-corn, because I've honestly never tried it before. But I am so glad I gave it a try because it goes so well with the cheese and potato.  I did have to cut down on the heat a little because my family doesn't like things too spicy, but otherwise kept it the same.  This will definitely be a keeper in my house.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Great twist on stuffed potatoes.  I didn't have any Mexican corn so used regular.  I subbed light sour cream and cheese to make a little healthier.  I also made ahead of time and just baked for 30 minutes to reheat.

I cooked the potatoes my usual way - prick with a fork, microwave on high for 5 mins, bake at 450f for 15 mins - and added some s&p. Super quick and pretty tasty. This could easily be adapted into a potato salad. Thanks, Dominique and Paul!

For the amount of time that went into these, I was only mildly impressed.  Maybe because they were a little mild themselves.  I enjoy a little more spice, so I'll probably use chopped jalapeno instead of the green chiles next time.  I will try them one more time.

I needed a side dish for chipotle marinated pork chops. This was perfect! I didn't have Mexican-style corn, so I just used regular (frozen) corn and added more of the green peppers. My husband loved these! I topped them with a little cilantro, too. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were awesome!  Take to heart though when it states LARGE potatoes, or reduce the corn and peppers to 1 can each.  I like spicy but it was a bit much but well worth a second, third or forth attempt.  Will definately put this in the keeper file.  Hats off to Paul for his creativity.

I really wanted to like this, but it just wasn't for me.  My potatoes wouldn't stay together while trying to scoop out the inside, so I ended up cutting the potatoes up and mixing everything together.  I then threw it all into a casserole dish and baked it for about 20 minutes.  As is, this is pretty bland.  Definitely needs some seasoning, maybe some chili powder, salt and pepper.  I may try it again, but would need to make some changes.

I only used two potatoes so I scaled the recipe for just the two. I had frozen corn so I just used some of that. I didn't want too much corn so I ended up guessing what amount might be best. Used a whole can of green chilies. Peeled the potatoes as they weren't looking that great, then mashed them up once they were soft and mixed with ingredients like a casserole.  Added some extra cheese on top.  Is was kind of bland when I tried it at first so I added a layer of cayenne pepper. This absolutely made the dish! Next time, I'll probably add some jalapenos to the mix and definitely sprinkle a layer of cayenne on top.

These were good, but next time I will make the filling spicier. Maybe will add some finely chopped chipotles en adobo.

I mixed sour cream and pepperjack cheese with fresh, finely chopped chives. I did not use the corn and they came out very creamy and tasty. After stuffing them I wrapped them loosely in foil and put them onto the upper rack of our bbq grill and they heated while our chicken was cooking.

I made this for a block party.  I cut one can of corn in half, so I mixed in 1 1/2 cans of mexicorn, and it was the perfect amount in my opinion!  My only problem was I forgot to pick up another can of chiles, so it was a tad bland.  And I wish I'd thought to salt and pepper a little.  But I served them with a side of Medium Salsa, and it was a hit!  

My husband HATES spicy food, and loved this!  It was the perfect amount for him.  And I refrigerated the leftover hash, and nuked it for my own little dinner last night.  YUM!  The best part is it can be altered depending on spice-preference.  We ended up cutting the potatoes into thirds because of size and I only brought one small end piece home.

Will definitely use this recipe again!  Thanks!

Really great recipe, but I can't help but think that it's missing something....I didn't use the pepperjack because I dont particularly care for it (used monterey jack and cheddar instead), but I dont know if spice is what it's missing.  Did not use the green onions either.  Still good though, and I will experiment to see what's missing.  Maybe chives instead...and I think that ranch dressing might just be the answer!

These were pretty tasty.  The only change I made was to use a pepper jack cheddar blend.

My family really liked these.  I only used 1 can of chile peppers, 1 can of corn, and I used 1/2 pepperjack and 1/2 cheddar.  I cut the potatoes in 1/2, so this made 12 servings for us.  I froze half.  YUM!

This was surprisingly good as I had never thought to use these ingredients in a baked potato.  I did not use the corn (husband would not have eaten) and we simply topped our potatoes with green chiles, pepperjack, sour cream and such individually.  We really liked the flavor combination.

These were good, although a little bland.  I even tried to add some seasoning after reading previous reveiws to do so.  I added a little cayene and cumin and also salt & pepper.  Could have still stood a little more - will adjust if I make again.  My husband really liked them - which is surprising so will probably make sometime again.

Good, but definitely lacking in flavor. I ended up just skinning the potatoes and mashing them up w/ everything else because they just were not holding up to being stuffed. Stuck it in the oven for 15 minutes to heat through. This definitely needs seasoning, as it was pretty bland. Nice idea though, just needs tweaking.

I didn't have the time to re-stuff the potatoes so I baked 3 potatoes and then scooped them out.  I mixed the potatoes with the sour cream, some butter, garlic salt, pepper, 1 can of green chiles, some onion, 1 can of corn (dranined), and some cheddar cheese.  I put it in a buttered casserole dish and put it in oven for about 20 min unitl it was warmed.  It was a nice twist to potatoes, and was an easy casserole alternative.

When I make these potatoes, I only use the 1 can of corn, add a little melted butter, some garlic salt, black pepper, crumbled bacon, and melt some sharp cheddar on top the last 5 minutes of baking.

When I went to the cupboard to get the corn, I was out so I used a can of kidney beans instead.  I used just one can of green chillies.  I also added 1/4 c finely chopped onions and 1/2 tsp cumin. Next time I will just mix it all into mashed potatos rather than going to the trouble to bake and stuff them.  There is too much filling  for the potatos anyway so there is extra left over.

very good...you have to adjust ingredients based on your size of potatoes.  I did not use as much corn...used frozen corn and serendipity seasoning salt.  Great with Prime Rib.

These were incredible!  My husband said he liked them better than the regular twice baked potatoes I make.  The only think I did differently was to add some butter and salt and pepper to the mixture.  Thanks for sharing something different to do with potatoes!

I cooked the potatoes as directed, but they were not nearly cooked through. I did not love the flavor either. Perhaps it was the canned chiles. I typically don't love the flavor.

I basically followed the recipe but adjusted the spice to my taste.  I like my food really, really spicy so I added lots of cayenne pepper and extra hot salsa and it was DELICIOUS!!! I think the recipe as written would have been rather bland for me but thanks for a great idea for potatoes! I'll be making this often now :)

Very good, but missing the zest needed for five stars.  I followed the recipe exactly and found the potatoes kept their baked potato taste.  All the cheese and sour cream did not add the flavor I thought it would.  I would add a lot more spice next time, and maybe melt cheese on the top.

These are very tasty and they have quite a "kick" to them.  I wish the potatoes were easier to scoop out, but I guess it just comes with the territory.  I will certainly be making this again.

I made these for a barbeque at my house and got great reviews from all! I love this recipe because it is so versitile. I can make it just like directions call if I am serving it up as a side dish, or I can add extras like bacon and/or onions and serve them up alone. Great recipe.

This recipe I truly enjoyed. My meat eaters had a nice side dish and I, a vegetarian, had a filling meal. My family told me that this is a keeper. Like other reviewers I had quite a bit of left over filling. I am not complaining- I am excited to experiment with them and see what I can concoct.

We love this one! I find that we always end up with a lot of the mixture left, so I like to put all the mix into a casserole dish, as opposed to back into the potato skins.  Always a crowd pleaser!

My husband thought this was OK; I thought it deserved a 4* rating. His complaint was that there was too much potato taste and not enough of the veggies. I slightly reduced the corn because of the other comments saying there was too much. Doubt I will make this again.
