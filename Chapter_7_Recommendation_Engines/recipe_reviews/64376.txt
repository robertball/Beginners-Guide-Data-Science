I didn't make kebabs, but sauteed the vegetables.  I really loved the flavor of this dish, but feel like the recipe calls for way too much olive oil.  I used 6T instead of the 8 called for and still felt like the dish was too oily.  I would definitely make this again, but would reduce the oil further and perhaps even increase the spices.

This is a good base recipe, however, with my modifications I found this to be a delicious dish! 
First off, I did NOT use Tempeh. I could not find it anywhere so I used the Extra Firm Tofu that I had. I cubed the Tofu and then marinated it in an delicious sauce called "Soyaki" that I bought from Trader Joe's. I highly recommend this sauce for Tofu, fish and stir-fry's. It is a mix between Teryaki and Soy sauce but it is thicker and has ginger and sesame in it. After marinating the Tofu for 15 minutes, I sauteed the Tofu in some olive oil and Soyaki sauce for about 25 minutes, turning the Tofu to coat both sides. While the Tofu cooked, I chopped up some green pepper, yellow pepper, garlic, ginger, eggplant, carrots, 1 vidalia onion and half a jalapeno pepper. I took the Tofu out of the pan when finished and used the same pan with olive oil to sautee about 2 tbps. of Garlic and 2 Tablespoons of fresh grated ginger. After about 5 minutes, I added the green and yellow bell pepper and 1 tsp. of minced jalapeno. We like our food on the spicy side! I then added the sweet Vidalia onion and carrots along with a few splashes of soy sauce (as called for) and several more Tbsp. of "Soyaki" sauce (instead of teriyaki sauce). Since carrots always take longer to cook I simmered this concoction for about 10 min. before adding the cubed eggplant. Unless you like really sweet food I personally think 3 Tbsp. of honey is too much so I only added 1 Tbsp. and found that it was still very sweet. I

Very good!  I did things a little differently...I didn't use tempeh.  I used the veggies as indicated, plus 1 yellowneck squash, a little bit of diced green peppers, jalapeno, red onion and sliced carrots.  Basically I cleaned out the fridge.  Marinated the veggies for a little while, then sauteed them and let them simmer in the marinade for about an hour.  Very good!  Thank you!  Oh...and I was a little worried about the salt content...I thought soy sauce AND teriyaki would be too salty, but not at all.  I just didn't add salt to the couscous.  Tasty!

This was delicious and my family is not vegetarian. My husband said I could make it anytime! I cut the oil in half and used Mr. Yoshida's Terriyaki sauce. I did not add any extra salt and it was plenty salty. I also substituted zucchini for eggplant because I wanted some green in the mix. Very tasty!

This was pretty good--- I used the sauce for about 16 oz. of stir fry veggies instead of doing kabobs. I made white rice with the broth and cumin, but no garbanzo beans. I would maybe go with less sauce next time, up the ginger a bit and use it again for stir fry, although I'd like to try the recipe as written too.

I modified this recipe by switching around the veggies in the kabobs-- I used bell peppers, celery, large chunks of onion, and cherry tomatoes--and by using 2 packs of tempeh rather than one as we have a bigger family. The sauce and couscous were wonderful, but I found that the tempeh cooked up rather dry. However, that's nothing that a bit of sour cream won't fix, and all in all these were quite good. A bit time consuming, but yummy and fun to eat.

this was good.  The marinade was great and my family, who usually won't eat tempeh or mushrooms, actually ate them and said they tasted good.  It needs a green veggie, though, maybe zuccini or green bell pepper.  easy to make.

This was good, but not great.  I was thinking that the whole dish would have a Moroccan taste, but it definitely does not!  I would use way less oil next time  and the veggies could be easily swapped out for whatever is on hand.  I broiled the kabobs for about 10 minutes total, turning every few minutes.  I don't feel like the eggplant cooked enough with this method, but everything else would have been burnt or overdone if I had cooked it much longer.

This went over well at a recent potluck dinner party.  Several friends raved about the marinade and wanted the recipe.

Delicious! We skipped the kabobs and changed the veggies up a bit (just pan fried them, then the tempeh). Nonetheless, the marinade and the couscous were really good and went better together than I expected.

We loved this recipe and added to it a bit... we like a little heat so I added a bit of red peppers flakes to the sauce.  I also added minced green onion to the couscous and used diced water chessnuts instead of garbonzos.  Needed a lot of lemon, but loved it!  And we doubled the quantity to have leftovers which were great cold.

super easy and flexible.  Use any mix of veggies.  I broiled mushrooms, tempeh, grape tomatoes and kale.  The kale would have been better boiled and used as a bed for the others.

Delicious dinner! As suggested by some in the reviews, I cut the olive oil in half and the entire meal turned out wonderful. This tasty meal was also fun and easy to make and will definitely become a 'go to' in my recipe box!

Good marinade. I used some other veggies I had in the house (in the picture). Most importantly the marinade complemented the tempeh well. I used the broiler and that worked well, too.

These were delicious!  We doubled the recipe and they served 8 people perfectly.  We were out of honey so subbed some agave syrup and instead of two eggplants we did one eggplant and two medium zucchini.  The cous cous was a nice on the side.
