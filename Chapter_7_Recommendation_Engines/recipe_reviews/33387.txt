I made this recipe customized to 8 servings just to test it out. Kinda goofed and used too much fresh ginger but the results were still excellent! The curry paste I used was 'Bhuna', a tomato based paste. The whole family enjoyed it and I'm about to make up a new batch. Good stuff! :)

I make as many jars as possible of Spicy Tomato Chutney every Summer from our homegrown tomatoes.  We enjoy it on sandwiches all year long!  Simply a fantastic recipe.

ever since we sampled the "Indian Pizza" at Trader Joe's my family got hooked on them. 

There's a great recipe for "Indian Chapati Bread" on this site too. Now I can't wait to top flat breads with this chutney and sprinkle w/goat cheese!

Love it ! Thanks for posting. For the curry paste, the store had green or red. I got the red and was a little worried it might be to hot, so I put in a little less. But I think I could have put the whole amount if not a little more in. I wasn't sure how long to simmer for, so it simmered for a half hour then I boiled it quickly for about 30sec and then put in the fridge. It was just right. Served it on Trader Joes Tandoori Garlic Naan bread.

This makes a really nice chutney. I made half a recipe and it still made a huge amount (1 litre). I only had Thai curry paste, so I substituted 1 tsp of garam masala. No mixed spice either, so used the spices recommended in the editor's note. It went very well with the veggie samosas we ate. Everyone enjoyed it.

This recipe looks really good, but what is the "mixed spice"?

This chutney is sensational. I am on my second batch and sharing with friends. Bread and cheese were made for a chutney like this!

Very nice. I used allspice (assuming that was the same as mixed spice) and it turned out exactly as I thought it should!

This was delicious!  I am looking for more excuses to make this and share it with friends.  Like another reviewer, I couldn't find curry paste in my grocery store so I also used curry powder; there didn't seem to be in problems in the way it turned out.  Also, I try to be conscious of not eating too much sugar, so I used Splenda instead and used only half the amount. For my taste, I will use even less next batch.

I cooked this for some fellas at work, and I must say, half of them are now in the hospital with diabetes problems. I think the sugar was a misprint. I am now the laughing stock of my workplace and am never allowed to cook again. On top of being hungry, I used all of the sugar usually used for the sweet tea, so now nobody has anything to chase down the shitney flavor left behind. Thanks for nothing!

This works really well and makes a very authentic tomato chutney, however the instruction to "fill a saucepan with water" is mistaken as this will result in a very liquid chutney. Remember there is also a lot of liquid in the tomatoes. I would recommend reducing the water to (say) two pints.

This was delicious.

I used curry powder instead of paste, and it turned out just fine.
The mixed spice was a perfect mixture, too.
