This poor thing needs more than two ingredients to save it from death. Maybe refried beans, ground beef, onions and a little sour cream might liven it up!

This works better if you don't mix the cream cheese into the salsa... here is a better idea: soften the cheese and spread thinly over a plate, spread a layer of salsa over the cheese and then microwave for 30 seconds. It's a delicious and quick appetizer that is fancier than plain salsa.

This was quick, easy, and barely edible.  A waste of good salsa.  Just eat it out of the jar, don't bother to mix it with the cream cheese unless you like to get creative w/your salsa before throwing it away.

I have made this dip for years, but I don't make it cold. Try heating the cream cheese in the microwave until it is softened and then add the salsa and heat another two minutes or so for a hot dip. It is very good this way.
