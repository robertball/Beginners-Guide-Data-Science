It turned out so great, but with additions. I think if I did not make changes it may have been bland. I added chopped red, green and yellow peppers, I also used chopped ham and turkey bacon. I let it sit overnight for 10 hours and then after cooking it covered in a clay pot with foil, I uncovered it, added cheese and set out sour cream and salsa for my family to top it with. They loved it and had seconds! Yummy!

We made close to 100 of these babies for our hospital health fair breakfast. They went over well, and were easy to serve. Very, very tasty.

I made this recipe for my co-workers last week!  Since then 3 more have made it!  Everyone loves it!  I served with Salsa and Sour Cream.  One  person substitued browned sausages for the ham.  I made it the night before - baked it before I left for work and kept it in a thermal carrier, which kept it warm until 10:00 bruch!   Leftovers were great cold or re-heated in the microwave!  This recipe will be among my favorites!

Four stars because i followed other reviewer's suggestions and added green pepper, onion, and sirloin steak to the wrap. To the liquid mix I added salt, pepper, hot sauce, garlic salt, and used more cream/eggs so it would cover the enchiladas. Family enjoyed these at a brunch and I love that you can prepare them the day before. It is important to remember to let them sit for about 15 minutes before serving. They will still be hot; without doing so the liquid wont set properly and the enchiladas will be a bit runny (yet still delicious). Will make again and probably continue to switch up this versatile recipe.

A huge hit at my Christmas Breakfast. I id as someone else suggested and used chorizo instead of ham. I cooked off the oil from the chorizo drained well and combined it with a can of mild green chilis. It was very good.

These are quite tasty.  I just used milk instead of half and half and I added sliced mushrooms.

This recipe was pretty good, though I don't think it's something I'd want to make regularly. I added some red bell pepper to the filling and felt that it could have still used some more vegetables, maybe some broccoli or hash brown potatoes.

I made this last Saturday for brunch with my parents and grandparents and everyone loved it! I used smoked sausage for the meat and added some chopped green onions over the top before baking. I also added some cream cheese to the recipe. It was wonderful! I served it with salsa and sour cream and everyone had seconds!

A fun alternative to regular breakfast casseroles.  Easy to assemble the night before.  Delicious served with sour cream and salsa.  I used spinach and whole wheat wraps which added visual appeal.  I will stuff a little fuller next time, and maybe add scrambled eggs (already cooked).  I added chopped green peppers to my filling for more color and flavor.

This recipce was good, but it had cook much longer than indicated because it was very runny.  I also added some spices to the egg mixture, cumin, cayenne, chili powder and green chilis.  Lastly, I topped it with fresh jalapeno slices, yummy!

These were pretty good.  I made them as is the first time.  On the second attempt, I added onions, green peppers, and red peppers.  It's likely a recipe that I might crave once a year.

Really good!  I threw in some diced potatoes that I first cooked in the oven till crispy.  I also reduced the half and half to 1 and a half cups.  Even doing that, I ended up cooking for about twice as long as what the recipe said because the egg mixture was still runny.

I thought that the recipe needed more flavor so I made it with the following changes:  I cooked 1 lb corizio with half an onion and a red pepper (both diced).  After mixing the eggs with whole milk (instead of half and half) I added a can of diced mild chiles.  I followed the rest of the recipe/instructions in the recipe.  It did take longer to cook then the recipe stated.  I served with fresh salsa (with lots of cilantro) and sour cream.  These alterations are great if you love the flavors of mexican food (but it isn't too spicy so the kids liked it as well).

This was pretty good but not a great breakfast dish.  First I would cut the ham up into 1/4" size pieces instead of grinding it. (You couldn't really taste it very well being ground up).  Then it was a little bland.  Don't know what you could add to make it a little more exciting--maybe some cut up tomato bits, jalapeno pepper instead off green pepper, maybe pepper jack cheese, maybe some sausage along with the ham.  Think if I make it again, I will try some of these options.  Think I made the enchiladas a little too big, too.  Only had 8 and so filled them pretty full.  They might have been a little better with a more tortilla to filling ratio.  It took about 1 1/4 hours to bake.  I had to use more egg and milk mixture to nearly cover the enchiladas.  The milk mixture seemed to soak into them overnight, so added a little more in the morning before baking.  All in all an OK recipe--has lots of potential.

Great recipe. I made this for work and everybody loved it. I used turkey sausage and added green chiles to give it a little flavor. It took about 15 minutes longer to cook then stated. I will definitely make this again.

I changed a few things other reviews suggested. Spicy hot sausage, red peppers, and a can of green chili's. VERY delicious!! Although I would suggest not using so much half and half, maybe some milk instead.

I first had this dish at a friend's home and it was so good that several of us went home with a copy of the recipe. I've since made it twice and it was a big hit and is easy to customize to your taste.

The flavor is pretty good but it was very hard to roll them up without the tortillas breaking and it was impossible to get them out of the baking dish looking like a enchilada.     In some regards, the end result is more like a quiché than an enchilada.   My wife liked it a lot more than me.   As many know, "Real men don't like quiché."

Very Very good! I did not have ham so I used bacon bits and some left over sausage. It was still delicious! Mine took about 10 minutes longer to cook than they recommend. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

These were a huge hit at brunch!  Instead of ham, I added black beans and corn to make them vegetarian friendly.  They were so delicious and went quickly.  I was nervous about the flavor since there aren't a lot of seasonings in it, but they have a lot of flavor and the texture is great.  And they are super easy.  Thanks so much for this recipe, I know I'll be using this one again!

Very good.  I browned spicy italian sausage with green onions and red peppers instead of using ham.  I added green chilis to the meat mixture and the egg mixture.  I also added fresh ground pepper and tabasco to the egg mixture.  I will definitely make this again.

Added several cans of chopped green chiles and more green onions to the ham mixture. But otherwise, followed the recipe.  Baking time took more like an hour though, could have been our location.  We live in Denver.  Everyone enjoyed it and it reheated nicely in the microwave for lunch the next day.

It was not very good.  I made it was written and my eggs were still runny even after additional cooking time.  I won't make it again.

Delicious!  I added red peppers to the filling and served with salsa and sour cream.  Loved them!  My husband went crazy over them.

Made them with sausage and a little bacon.  I think it tasted great and I liked prepping the night before.  My husband said MORE bacon please!! Took longer to bake too - or it's perfect if you like wet eggs?? I will definitely making again!!

Love this recipe. I was looking for a breakfast casserole and this one hit the spot.  I did add more cheese and I also used chicken sausage instead. This recipe is so versatile and you can change it to add whatever you have on hand.

I thought this was a great recipe. I did take a few suggestions and spiced it up by using hot green peppers. I also made sure the half and half covered the  flour tortillas. This is just like when you make the regular mexican enchiladas and the sauce must cover the tortillas or you will have hardened edges. The same concept applies to this brunch enchilada recipe. The liquid mixture must cover and/or saturate the flour tortillas prior to baking the dish. And no I did not use more than 2 cups of the half and half because that's all I had on hand. Everyone in my MIT  prayer group really loved this recipe and asked for it too.

I loved the ham & green onion flavor.  We made homemade tortillas which was a nice touch.  I wasnt sure about the egg/cream ratio but went with it.  I am still not sure about it.  I did have to bake it a little bit longer.  Everyone seemed to enjoy them.  DH liked them alright but wasnt raving, but the younger crowd seemed to like them.  I topped mine with a local dip, called Chip-n-Dip, and some added salsa.  Thanks for sharing!

Made these for a brunch playdate and all the Moms were asking for the recipe.  They were easy to assemble and loved the convenience of doing them ahead the evening before.  Next time I will try the chorizo, as some reviewers have recommended.  They were delicious on there own, but tasty w/ a dab of sour cream and salsa.  Yum!

This not a review but a thought. I am going to make this for my Sunday School class this Sunday Morning.(There will be about 60 people) What do you think about me cutting down the size of the tortillas to about 4" in diameter? Reason...there will be so many other foods to choose from and this would be a smaller portion. Do you think it would be O.K. ? I think I am going to use sausage also as we live in the south and anything with sausage and cheese will be a big hit. Thanks for any comments

I have made this numerous times now.  The best filling we like is bacon, green pepper, red pepper, onion & cheese.  We sautee alll of those first before adding to wraps.  I do find they take longer to cook (40 min covered, 25 uncovered). We also uses milk not cream.   They are great!

I made this casserole for a ladies brunch today.  It went over really well.  The only thing I changed was the ham ( I substituted sausage, what I had on hand), and I used milk instead of the half and half.  Like others, I had to cook it for an hour, not 25 minutes.  The ladies really enjoyed it though!

I added chopped red pepper to the ham mixture and offered salsa on the side.  It was delicious!  Next time I will try milk instead of half and half to reduce the calories.

I made this for a work brunch and it was a BIG hit.  After reading the reviews I changed a few things...I used sausage instead of ham, I added chopped onions and jalapeno to the sausage as well as 2 eggs to the sausage.  I decreased the eggs (4) and half/half (1 cup).  I will definitely make this again!!

I looked this recipe up when I had some left over tortillas in the fridge. Didn't have cooked ham but I had some frozen sausage that I just cooked and chopped up. I will definitely be making this again next time we have a potluck brunch for Mothers' day.

This was a great brunch dish! I do have to admit that I altered the recipe to give it a little more flavor: instead of ham I used "hot" breakfast sausage (which I cooked in patties and then chopped so it was the same feel as the ham would have been) and added a can of green chilies (as previous reviewers mentioned) on top of the rolled enchiladas, but under the liquid ingredients and final layer of cheese. It went over WONDERFULLY at my work potluck!

These were great! Some of the guests I made them for don't eat pork, so I took out the meat and replaced it with onions and bell peppers. This created a cross between a fajita and an enchilada...my friends and I decided to call them fajitaladas! Everyone loved them.

Very good!  I wanted to make something different for a group up at my Aunt's cabin. I was nervous, but made them and they turned out great.  I made two pans of them.  One like the recipe and one I browned a 12 oz tube of breakfast sausage and added chopped fresh mushrooms to the meat while browning.  Both turned out good.  I will definitely make again!

I made this recipe for a brunch and they turned out great!  I served them along with a skewer and toast - everyone loved them.  I actually made too many so I gave a couple to my neighbor the night before...They baked them off the next morning and showed up at my door for the recipe!  Very good!

I made this for Sunday brunch.  I also added chopped red and green pepper.  I didn't read the recipe thoroughly and started making it in the morning before my guests arrived!  I only had about an hour to let it stand in the fridge but it turned out wonderful!  Everyone raved!

This recipe was pretty good and quite easy to make.  After reading other reviews I made some adjustments and additions.  In place of ham I used Spicy Breakfast Sausage and I also added both green and red bell peppers.  The last thing I changed was the cheese...instead of using just cheddar I used a cheddar and pepper-jack blend.  They turned out well and the group enjoyed them.  I still think they could use something more...maybe a tablespoon or two of diced green canned chiles???  Will definitely make these again.

We loved it.  Forgot until the last minute to pour the eggs over.  I was asked how did I get the eggs in the enchiladas.  Will be making again for Christmas.

Four stars as is, five if you spice it up! 
I doubled the recipe, using 1 lb. of regular sausage, 1 lb. of spicy sausage to help give it a kick. I also added red, green and yellow bell peppers when the sausage was almost fully cooked and let it all simmer together. I served with some jalapenos and hot salsa and no one could get enough of it! 
The chopping is the only time-consuming part - quick, easy, DELICIOUS recipe to keep for group breakfasts/brunches.

VERY good. I didn't let them sit overnight, instead I just let them sit on the counter for about 20 min. after assembling them. Topped with sour cream, green onions, salsa, red onion, and tomato...... Everyone loved them... Great recipe.

These were a big hit at a family gathering.  I made 2 trays.  To both I added chopped red pepper.  To the spicy one, I added chopped spicy sausage and minced jalapenos.   For the egg mix, I used skim milk (cream?  WAY too rich) and added white pepper. For the cheese, I mixed cheddar and monterey jack, and served everything with salsa and sour cream.  I will definitely make this again!

Loved this!  I used fresh tortillas from Costco (fresh uncooked, so I did have to cook them first, but so worth it).  I also added black refried beans to the filling.

It wasn't bad - took over an hour to bake and looked pretty bland. I poured picante on top then put cheddar cheese and swiss cheese on top. I gave it 4 stars because it's good/average, not great.

Well, I changed this QUITE a bit to make it vegetarian.  I used vegetarian chorizo sausage (soyrizo or trader joes)and substituted it for half the ham.  Then I added 1/ cup each green pepper, diced cooked potato, and chopped fresh tomato.  I used 2% milk instead of half and half, egg substitute instead of egges, and reduced fat cheese. I didn't let it soak longer than 10 minutes, not having time to wait!  Came out delicious but I kind of think it needed more of the egg milk mixture so I might increase that next time. The chorizo is wonderful in it.

I used milk instead of cream and my tortillas puffed up! But they were still good!

This is a wonderful recipe that is easy and very tasty. A suggestion, make sure the eggs are set before putting on the extra cheese. For a church outing four of us doubled the recipe and cooked 80. One of the cooks commented that this was the best simple recipe he has seen for enchiladas.

I'm a pepper fanatic so I added red pepper to the dish.  Awesome dish and it's requested to be made on any special occasion.
