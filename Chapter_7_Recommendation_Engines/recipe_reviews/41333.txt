I made this chili for my fiance and his parents over New Years and again for my mom last night.  I used one pound of lean ground beef and one pound of ground turkey and added a can of kidney beans for a truly hearty treat.  I put everything in my crockpot and cooked on high for about 6 hours or so.  When my mom came over for the Golden Globes, we had a delicious dinner.

I usually add a little more of this or that, delete ingredients that seem odd, etc.  I followed this recipe EXACTLY as written and it turned out great.  This is a crowd pleaser and everyone will like it.  Have some mild and hot peppers on the side for those who want to spice it up.  Don't forget the jack+cheddar cheese too.

Yum! Very good, very filling. Even better left over. And one of us thinks it's the best chili ever- I liked that it's not so spicy.

This chili was really good.  I love how fast and easy it was to make.  It's also mild enough for my 7-year old.  I left out the green peppers and used kidney beans instead of pinto beans.

This has quickly become a favorite dish at all of my family functions.  Even the picky eaters love it.  It's very easy to put together and gets even spicier the longer it cooks.  Wonderful leftovers!

Let’s try this again. My first review in 20+ years! I have made this wonderful chili multiple times and here’s what I’ve settled on after reading others’ suggestions and trying things out: -Left out green peppers, -Used a combo of ground beef, pork, and Italian sausage, -Used 1/3 less water, -Added a can of Campbell’s tomato bisque, -Used canned diced tomatoes with green chiles, -Added chili powder, -Added a dollop of sour cream, Mexican blend shredded cheese, and tri-color tortilla strips to the bowl when serving. OMG! My husband also loves it and I may find myself entering a chili cook off with it!!!!

This is an excellent mild chili recipe, my family devoured it! I added 2 extra cans of chili style beans (pinto/kidney)and used 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of the garlic salt. Served with fresh sourdough bread. I will definately make this again, though next time I might just kick it up a bit. Yum!!

This was a basic chilli recipe.  My husband daughter seemed to like it.  I reduced some ingredients in the recipe because there are only three of us who would be able to eat this dish (I have a six month old also).  I used one pound groud turkey and no green pepper.  I also used kidney beans instead of the pinto beans.  The only mistake I made was forgetting to reduce the water from 2 cups to 1 cup.  So, it made too much liquid.  The taste was still good, though.

This chili was easy and delicious. I will make this again and again. I love the pinto beans in it,I will probably never use kidney beans again.

Very good recipe.  I omitted the ground pork and added extra ground beef.  I also added 1 can tomato soup, 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes with chilies(Mild) and a pinch of cayenne.  Served it over wide noodles and sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  It was excellent.

My family enjoyed this one.  I made a few changes though.  Replaced water with beer, used 2 cloves of garlic rather than garlic salt, and kidney beans (I already had them) and zesty diced tomatoes.  So easy and fast.  Nice and mild for my 10yr old who panicks when he thinks I'm cooking something spicy.  Served over rice and you've got a meal.  It makes so much I am considering making this for my son's football concession stand.

This was the best chili recipie I have had in a long time. I cooked up the beef and sausage before I left for work,put in the fridge and when I got home it took no time at all to finish it up. Took left overs to work the other day and fed 6 co workers.

My family really liked this recipe.  Even my picky 2 year old finished her plate off.  Leftovers are even better the second day!

This was a very good recipe.  For the recipe, we used 1# of spicy turkey Italian sausage (lower fat), then added a handful of sliced mushrooms.  The mushrooms were browned with the onion and sausage, as well as minced fresh garlic.  We didn't add the garlic salt, since we had used fresh, and didn't want the added salt.  Green peppers were too $$$, so we skipped them, and didn't miss it at all.  Yum!

My husband says I'm allowed to keep this one and make it again.  Translates to: "Wow! This is great!" Soooo easy too.

We loved this recipe! I kept it mild for the kids and they even liked it. Using sour cream really makes it creamy. Great recipe!
