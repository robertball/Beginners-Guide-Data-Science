Wouldn't call this best ever.  If I ever make this again (which I doubt) I would use half the meat...it's just too meaty not enough flavor.  The sauce while a good idea tastes too much like tomato soup and not really thick like sauce should be, it had the consistency of soup too.

This was quick, easy and very good. There are many variations in meat loaf, and this is a good one.  The only thing I did differently was to glaze the top with the extra soup, when the loaf was nearly done, instead of using as in the recipe. I found the meatloaf to be firm, flavorful and very satisfying.

I added a few spices to the meat loaf (italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, worchestershire sauce, red pepper flake) and because I'm out of croutons, I used equal amounts Texas Toast croutons that I ran through the food processor. When I made the gravy, I sauteed some chopped onion and fresh garlic in a little butter until browned, then added the water, tomato soup and some dried basil and dried oregano. This was good, I think if I hadn't added spices, it would have been very bland. That said, this was a very moist meat loaf.

My husband was very skeptical when I said I was making a meatloaf this Christmas, as he had always found them dry and tasteless. This was a huge crowd-pleaser and my husband loved it so much I am making it again two days later. If you like traditional, dry meatloaf that mostly tastes like bread, you will probably not enjoy this recipe, but for normal human beings that like a juicy, flavorful, meaty dish, you cannot go wrong with this recipe!

The first time I made this recipe I didn't read the directions very well because I was in a hurry. I ended up putting the whole can of soup and the water in with the rest of the meatloaf. It turned out to be really good that way, but a little salty. I just made this again the right way and it was even better. I ended up putting the soup and water mix over the meatloaf about half way through the cooking process and it was great! I also added some French's onions to the top. I will definitely make this again!

I've never made meatloaf before.  This was easy.  I added a little season salt and Worcestershire sauce to add some flavor.

I made this recipe because I haven't made meatloaf in a while and I had all of the ingredients on hand. It was alright, but it wasn't the best. The glaze tasted like what it was -- tomato soup. I probably wouldn't make this again, but I do like the easy idea of adding a pack of onion soup mix to meatloaf for flavor.
