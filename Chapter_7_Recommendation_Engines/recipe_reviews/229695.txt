We made these as written and they turned out nicely.  I am happy to have a snow peas recipe that is not Asian-style flavored!

Really liked this recipe. Was happy to find a snow pea recipe that wasn't Asian food oriented for once. I used a bit more Italian seasoning than called for, but that was just personal taste.

Terrific. So nice to have another way to enjoy snow peas rather than in a stir-fry or with Asian flavours. This is going into my keeper file. So quick and easy too! Thanks Geophile

Wow!  Love how this tastes, and how very quickly it came together.  I prepped it earlier in the day--toughest part was trimming the pods.  While our steaks rested, I put this together.  Didn't change a thing!  Those of you who left out any of the ingredients made a mistake--you really should try it as written.  It's a nice balance of flavors.  Perfection!  Whole family loved this!  Can't wait to try some variations on the herbal blend, ah the possibilities!

I made this recipe from the AllRecipes Magazine which has this recipe published using olive oil instead of butter. I made the recipe with olive oil and an additional clove of garlic and it turned out delicious. I can't wait to makes his recipe again! It is bursting with flavor and makes for a great side dish or snack.

Delicious and quick. I didn't have lemon, and skipped the OO. I used 3 cloves of garlic. Be careful not to add too much water. Use a little at a time, as needed.I used snow peas from the last harvest in my garden. This recipe gives me a great reason to plant them again next year.Very good!

I thought these were okay. The Italian seasoning was a bit strong for me on snow peas. I have only really had Italian seasoning on root vegetables. It was a little over-powering on such a light vegetable. This side dish is definitely something more for an Italian meal with such a distinct taste. I used the microwavable fresh snow peas in a bag. It still took the 2 minutes to cook them after an initial steaming in the bag. So, I suppose the actual recipes would take 5-7 minutes to cook.

So simple and so yummy for the whole family. I did mine with coconut oil just to increase the nutritional value and it worked out really tasty.

I liked it, but I would cut down on the butter and oil a bit the next time, and maybe add a bit more lemon juice.

Like other reviewers, I liked the change from the usual Asian flavour.  I will certainly make it again, probably try it with different vegetables too.

Just ok.  You couldn't taste the Italian seasoning or even the garlic & I used a big clove.  It was easy to make & we love snap peas but were disappointed.

Simple yummy way to make snow peas! They keep the crispy crunch and the lemon juice makes the flavor brighter. I just eyeballed it and squeezed a little too much lemon juice though. The cleaning and de-stringing of the peas took the longest. Lol

This is a seriously delicious and decently healthy snack! My boyfriend made them first and I fell in love with them! So now I make them all the time. I don't use Italian seasoning though because I don't have any. So I typically just add a little oregano and a dash of rosemary, and they turn out wonderful.

I thought these were absolutely delicious.  It was nice to have a way to prepare these besides as part of an Asian dish (not that I don't like those, too.  I DO!)  But this was special and I didn't change a thing.

Simple recipe, great taste. I actually skipped the Italian dressing in the end.. I felt there was enough flavour and I wanted it to be more subtle among the other items on the plate.

Made this tonight with some Snow Peas that my neighbor brought over from his garden... FANTASTIC! My daughter was eating them out of the pan like they were candy! Never would have thought of preparing snow peas this way... Thanks!! Keeping my fingers crossed that the neighbor makes another snow pea delivery real SOON!!

I had dinner out about a week ago and really enjoyed the snow peas and wished I could make them.  I just happened to see some on sale a couple days ago and tried this recipe today.  Of course this wasn't the same as the restaurant's but it is good.  I will make it again.

Snow peas from our garden - delicious and simple to prepare with this recipe.  I made as written and would do so again.  Served these with - 'Mediterranean Beef Meatball Kabob', 'Molly's Mouthwatering Tzatziki Cucumber Sauce' and 'Grilled Corn Salad' - all from AR.

I couldn't figure out how to make them if they weren't in a stir fry! It was great! Very simple to make! Had all the ingredients in my fridge. My whole family loved them!

This was so easy and so good! I love asian flavors with snow peas, but needed something different for meals not centered around those flavors. I will definitely make again.
