This recipe was okay.  The marinade made the chicken stick to the grill and even after basting the chicken several times, I don't think that the taste came through all that well.  I did marinate the chicken all day thinking that the chicken would soak up more of the taste, but it didn't happen.  I will try again, but I think I will use my rotisserie and see how it turns out that way.

I made this recipe even quicker by cooking it on my George Foreman Grill.  The chicken was tender and tasty

This was wonderful!  Be sure and double the sauce, and reserve 1/2 cup marinade before adding the uncooked chicken to it.  I didn't have honey mustard on hand, so I created my own (1/2 cup dijon mustard + 1/2 cup honey, then added 6 Tbl. teriyaki sauce).  Reserve 1/2 cup marinade.  I marinated the chicken in a ziploc bag all day, then cooked the chicken in a skillet on medium-low with the reserved marinade.  What an easy, delicious dish!  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't care too much for this recipe, but my husband loved it. I will be making it again, only when he requests it.

I didn't have Grey Poupon, but I did have O'Charley's reduced fat honey mustard and it was excellent! My fiance loved it, I didn't measure out 3 tbsp exactly of teriyaki sauce, I just kinda dumped it on top of the chicken. Wonderful recipe though, goes great with rice and broccoli!!!

I thought this was very good.  I marinated the chicken over night and added extra while grilling.  The sauce was very tasty.

Doubled the recipe for a larger crowd... came out very tasty. Grilled chicken breasts on Big Green Egg... smoked with apple chips. Kids and adults loved it!
