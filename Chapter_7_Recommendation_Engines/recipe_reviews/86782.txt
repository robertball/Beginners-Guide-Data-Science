There's a difference between the terms "Authentic New Mexican" and "New Mexico Style". The first means it's prepared the exact way one would expect it to be prepared (i.e. fresh ingredients) and the second is as best as one can without the "proper" ingredients (i.e. canned sauce for those of us unable to get decent fresh chilis).

As someone who grew up in New Mexico, eating authentic New Mexican foods, this New Mexico-like recipe is great especially since I don't have easy access to the proper chilis.

this is a good, easy recipe.  and to those who rated it down because it uses "canned" things, shut up!  from one who lives thousands of miles from fresh chile, I either rely on canned or do without.

I'm from New Mexico and this recipe is not like any authentic New Mexico recipe I know of. Your red chile sauce should be made out of 16 dried red chile pods (minus seeds and ends) -- hydrated with water until plump (2-3 hrs)-use the water from hydration bowl (4 cups to 16 pods)  and blended with 1/2 tsp cumin,1 Tbl sp flour,1 Tbl spn garlic, pinch of mexican oregano and salt to taste..then you would need to blend it in the blender for 5 minutes and use something to take the bitter chile peeling from the chile sauce - I use a flour sifter. Cook on stovetop with a little bit of lard or olive oil at medium heat until it thickens. That will be used for your red chile sauce instead of your chili powder or canned enchilada sauce.. good luck!!

This is an outstanding recipe I was introduced to when i got married and is a Family favorite for special occasions especialy birthdays! This is the most requested dish we make. Yes top it with the fried eggs is the only way to go. We serve with sweet beans and rilennos ( I know i spelled that wrong ) For those of you who prefer tacos trying a two layered taco without dipping the tortilas in the sauce but just drizzeling into the taco. Try a two layered taco too.

These are like the ones my Mom made when I was growing up (I'm from Southwest Texas,) we had access to dried chilies to make fresh enchilada sauce but I've found the canned sauce is a good substitute if you can't use fresh.  These are easy to modify as well, I've made them using black beans for the chicken and meat as well.  The fried egg makes them delicious!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is a tasty dinner, and a good time-saving alternative over traditional baked enchiladas.

Those who wish to add fresh chili peppers are free to do so, I'm sure. There's no need to rate down a recipe for a slight modification like that.

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner! I really enjoyed this dish. I served this for Cinco De Mayo dinner. This required little effort and looked nice plated. I made Mrs. Espy's enchilada sauce for this. I made 2 layers for this and they were plenty big and really a meal in themselves with no side dish necessary as a filler. This was much easier than a traditional enchilada but wasn't quite the same flavor or texture either. The egg really makes this dish stand out and I wouldn't skip it seeing as it adds a lot to the character of this tasty dish. I plan on fixing this again. Gracias!

Followed the recipe exactly.....the canned sauce is a bit bitter...next time I will make my own enchilada sauce and I think I will use shredded chicken instead of the chunks......Just made this recipe for the second time..I made home made sauce and I baked the chicken then shredded it...with these changes I would give it 5 stars

This is a good jump-off point for enchiladas, but I prefer them with a lot more goodies inside (black beans, spinach instead of lettuce, etc.  I layer tortillas, beans and raw onion, tortillas, chicken with spinach and sauce, tortillas, cheese and I actually do prefer them to bake in the oven until the cheese is all melty.  The fried egg is a great idea.  I skip the sour cream, because with all the cheese it just isn't needed.  Serve it up with a side of Spanish rice.  Lastly, I would much rather use Mrs. Espy's Enchilada Sauce recipe (found here on the allrecipes site) than use a canned one.

Mmmm, these were fantastic! I've never tried eggs on enchiladas before this, but I'll definitely be eating them again! I used Hatch brand red enchilada sauce, and it tasted pretty good. Thanks!

I didnt use enchilada sauce but instead red chili (made with Hatch red chilis), I did not dip my corns but spooned the chili over the ground beef, cheese, and onions. I topped granpas with a fried egg upon request but to get the true essence of this regional dish you must go with an over easy egg, tooooo die for!!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe. Every bite was a wonderful experience of taste. I will most definatly be making this again soon.

On a side note, this dish on a smaller scale without the tortilla made a great side to tandoori chicken and tomato/cucumber raita.

I would not have tried this recipe, but my mother-in-law always made her enchiladas this way and I remembered how good they were. This recipe was fantastic. My daughter does not remember grandmas, but she loved these. I did not have canned sauce so I used  the "10 minute enchilada sauce" (also a keeper) recipe from this site. I sauted the chicken briefly and then simmered the chicken in the sauce for about 20 minutes. The egg sounds like an odd addition, but it absolutely makes the dish. Thank you for the delicious meal!

Excellent recipe and easy too.  Unlike some eviewers, I don't have access to the fresh chilis, so this recipe is great as it gives you the options of the can items, which I can get from my grocery store.  Thank you for such a great and tastey recipe.

This will be a confusing review and a bit unfair. I posted a picture of the enchiladas to this recipe using grizzlygirl711's review. Her recipe was DIVINE!!! Best I ever had.  Use her recipe for the results posted on the photo. There was a bitterness issue the first day which I found disappointeing. However, I made up the recipe (thanks grizzlygirl711 and fellow PDXer) and added 1 can Hunt's tomato paste and some honey.  Let it rest for a day and the bitterness completely disappeared! (I think letting it sit in the fridge was key a day or two). This review is a bit unfair to the original poster since I never made this recipe, but I urge you to try grizzlygirl711's version for enchiladas to die for. Thank you grizzlygirl! I used colby jack cheese. Grizzlygirl...please post recipes! Please! :)

For ease of use, quick prep time and versatility, I am giving this  recipe 5 stars. I didn't make it exactly like the printed recipe , but that is the beauty of this recipe.  I didn't have unfrozen meat, so I used some pepper jack cheese and shredded cheddar to make cheese enchiladas.  No need for sour cream, though if I had it on hand I would use  it.  I didn't have lettuce, so I chopped a little cilantro, olives and raw onions for the top, along with some more cheese.  My whole family, including the picky boys, loved this meal and I will definitely make it again.  I used the 10 minute Enchilada Sauce recipe on allrecipes.com.  I love the idea of dipping the tortillas in sauce and assembling the enchiladas on each plate, customizing each one.  The egg on top was amazing, so much so that I am going to use 2 eggs on each enchilada stack next time. You can easily make any type of enchilada with whatever you have on hand with this recipe.

This was amazing! My kids even loved it and there really picky eaters. I didn't change anything in the recipe.
