Pretty good, light salad.  The blueberries and balsamic vinegar are a great balance.  I will probably make this again.

wasn't quite a 5 but more than a 4.  My husband was quite surprised that he liked it. As he said, he loves pecans, loves blueberries, loves ba;samic vinegar dressing on lettuce(used olive oil instead of canola)but didn't expect to enjoy them all together.  Well, he was quite surprised.  I made this individually each night and kept the dressing seperate for my husband to take to work  for Lunch.   Was very much enjoyed and will make it again!

This salad was very light tasting, but very good at the same time. Also tried with black raspberries. Husband loved it.

I am really not a fan of salads in general but in my quest to try and eat better I decided to try this. WOW.  It was probably one of the best salads I have ever had.  The toasted pecans added the perfect crunch to this light dinner.

YUM!  We didn't have blueberries, so substituted blackberries.  It was perfect, light, and delicious.  Will definitely be making this again!
