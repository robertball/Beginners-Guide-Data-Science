Made this on a whim with some left over chicken I have, and so pleasantly surprised, that decided to take to work for coworkers birthday party.  This is a definite keeper!

Oh my! This is great chicken salad! I used left-over seasoned chicken in it, trying not to throw it out or waste it. Boy, am I glad I did! I have made this before and subbed lemon juice for the lime and a little regular onion for the green onion with no harm done at all.  I always use Hellman's Light Mayo. One time I tried to lighten it up even more by using 1/2 cup plain yogurt and 1/4 cup light mayo. Still delicious!

I was not exactly sure how they would turn out...but I was pleasantly surprised! Several people were commenting how delicious the chicken sandwiches were. It was great since we had over 20 people over for mother's day brunch. :)

Made this for Recipe Group. It is wonderful! I love chicken salad with curry in it, and this is my new favorite. I didn't have lime the first time I made it, so I used lemon juice. I didn't notice any difference in taste when I used lime. The second time I sprinkled in a little more curry and I peeled the apple (both just my preference). This recipe is perfect as written! Thank you pattycakes!

Recipe Group Selection:  01, June 2013 ~ A delicious, filling summer sandwich.  Family really enjoyed this chicken salad.  I did omit the pecans so that my son would eat it.  I served it on a multi-grain French bread and used fresh spinach leaves rather than lettuce as it is what I had on hand.  I liked the added flavor that the fresh lime juice gave to the mayonnaise.   I served this with a pasta salad and fresh fruit and it was so nice out today, we ate outside on the patio.

This was the recipe group selection for the week. I did use some rotisserie chicken so I didn't have to cook the chicken, which made this a breeze to whip up on a hot humid night. We served on some nice fresh bakery onion rolls since just the hubs and I. What a delicious salad, just the perfect combination of tangy fruit, creamy dressing and fresh crunchy veggies and nuts. So darn good you don't even need any bread.

Thank you Pattycakes for your delicious recipe.  I prepared the chicken salad and allowed it to chill for a couple of hours before serving. The only change I made was to serve on King's Hawaiian Mini Sub Rolls. This is a definite keeper as everyone really enjoyed. Recipe Group we hit it out of the ballpark again with this great recipe selection.

Recipe Group Selection for June 1, 2013 -  I thinly sliced a crusty baguette for my sweet little tea sandwiches.  They were appealing and appetizing, and everyone enjoyed them.  But I have to admit, I loved this chicken salad so much, afterwards I grabbed a sub roll and filled it up.  Bring it on - this was delicious!

THE saddlebag favorite! Excellent, simple & satisfying recipe!  Men & women in my circle thoroughly enjoyed this sandwich-pack lunches often for the saddlebag and this is the winner.  All ingredients on hand, quick to prepare and never any leftovers (darn!). Didn't change a thing. Thank you for a classic, easy recipe that always goes over great! Always a requested recipe!!!

Each bite of this wonderful chicken salad yielded a wonderful medley of flavors that was light and fresh, yet very filling.  I cooked my chicken in the crock pot which made this recipe a breeze to make.  I served on "Pretzel Buns" recipe from this site which was a great match although I agree with other reviewers who stated that this would be good on just about anything.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe, patticakes!

I love this recipe.  I like to make it with leftover rotisserie chicken.  I also sprinkle each sandwich with salt and pepper. Great on tortillas too!

Absolutely enjoyed this!  Nice blend of textures and subtle curry flavor.  Used two rotisserie chicken breasts.    Spread on croissants, added lettuce and tomato.  So, so delicious!  I may try it with chopped boiled eggs or tuna instead of the chicken next time.

We make this anytime we have leftover chicken . It's so good! As a matter of taste I increase the curry spice significantly and sometimes use fresh grapes in place of dried cranberries. It's great to take to the beach with crackers.

Made this exactly as written with the exception of adding a bit more pecans as per hubby and my personal preference.  It was superb as a sandwich and just to eat as a salad as well.  Will definitely keep this in mind in the future for a nice easy lunch with a tasty muffin for the two of us or for company.  Definitely a keeper, thanks pattycakes.

Used a rotisserie chicken, a Jazz apple, the juice of one lime and toasted the pecans.  Absolutely FANTASTIC!

Truly a lovely, elegant chicken salad. I made this for a party and I overhead the hostess tell one of her guests, "She's like a gourmet cook or something." That's far from the truth, but it's nice to be able to take the mundane and make it extraordinary. Lots of texture from chicken, to the mayo, to the dried cranberries, as well as a nice  crunch due to the apples and pecans. The curry, which I had doubts about as I'm not a curry fan, it added a nice subtle flavor that makes you go, "hmmmm, what is that?" and I now wouldn't even begin to consider omitting it. So okay, you probably won't want to serve this to a bunch of burly guys watching the Super Bowl, but it's perfect for those occasions when you need something elegant and delicious.  Take the time to find some beautiful tea rolls and put these out on a gorgeous platter. I think this would be nice without the lettuce and served in prebaked phyllo shells.

I make this and spread it on a flour tortilla spread with cream cheese. I slice it into small rollups. They look great as they taste on a large platter serving dish.

I make these, by request, every year for my church's annual tea.  They get rave reviews and many people have asked for the recipe.  The only change I make is to add a lot more curry powder.  I add to taste, so not sure exactly how much, but probably close to 1 tablespoon.  I also make it the day before so the flavors have a chance to meld.

This is the second time I’ve made this: scaled down for two. Both times have increased the amount of curry powder —I use a mild yellow curry blend. The first time I followed the recipe ( except for increasing the curry). The second time I left out the apple as it seemed like a lot of fruit to chicken ratio. I also substituted sliced almonds for the pecans. In all , a good recipe to have in the rotation.

Awesome.  Quick.  Easy.  Allow the chicken to cool after cooking,  just a bit,  so the mayo doesn’t melt when mixing!  Loved the curry taste.  We used walnuts, instead,  and it tasted GREAT!  We ate Maui Style Potato Chips on the side with some sweet island ice tea!  WINNER!

This is my favorite chicken salad..I even add pasta to it when I want to stretch it.  It is soooo refreshing with the apple which is a natural go together with the curry flavor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The ingredients are a good jumping off point, but the proportions are all wrong in my opinion. I used more mayo and curry spice, calls for too much apple (I'd say half a red delicious would be plenty) I used walnuts instead of pecans and left out the cranberries all together. Definitely play with this one.

I tried it with the apples and without. Liked it both ways but better with apples. Family was split on the vote. I peeled the apples too.  I also boiled my own chicken breasts seasoned with garlic and rosemary. It was a hit and home and I will definitely be making it again.

I didn't change a thing.  Used bottled lime juice and a gala apple, then served it on croissants for lunch, along with potato salad.  My hard to impress husband, a guest and myself all give it the thumbs up.  It would make a fabulous appetizer served on mini-croissants.  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!

This recipe is my go-to for potluck parties. A bowl of this and some ritz crackers and people will always ask for the recipe. My husband and mother love using it as sandwiches for lunch. The only change I make to this recipe is that I use canned chicken sometimes.

I have been looking for a recipe for these and this hit the spot! I used 1 1/2 chopped apples instead of just one as I wanted a little extra crunch and I added quite a bit extra curry than what the recipe calls for as I love the strong flavor.

Made this for a tea party I gave. I substituted golden raisins for the cranberries and used lemon juice, too. I chopped it in the food processor on pulse to make it more spreadable. Everyone liked it. It was slightly sweet, so I will use more curry next time.

I made a vegetarian version

Instead of chicken used frozen tvp chicken made of soy.
Also, modified curry to 2 Tbs.

Everything else left the same.

Made this to finish off the leftovers from a rotisserie chicken. It was good, but not great. I only had whole wheat buns on hand which might have taken away from it. I have some left over so I might try it again tomorrow, but on some sourdough instead.

Since tuna now has hideous amounts of mercury, chicken salad is THE replacement.  I use this  recipe and vary the ingredients quite often as some family members don't want the fruit.  Then it's lots of crunchy celery and onions, and sweet our dill pickle relish.
Still miss tuna sandwiches though.

Super yummy! The only thing I'd change is adding a tad more curry powder, but that's just personal preference. Instead of cooking the chicken, I used a precooked deli chicken. Turned out great. For our family (2 adults), 6 svgs = 5-6 sandwiches

Love it, but after tasting I doubled the curry and added dash of garam marsala. 
When I made it a second time I subbed chopped firm mango for the apple and replaced half the mayo with plain Greek yogurt to reduce fat/calories. Delicious!!

I just made this recipe minus the cranberries and the curry powder, which I replaced with Schiracha sauce for spiciness. 10/10, It was awesome and only took 15 minutes of my time to prepare!

Very versatile salad. We tried as sandwich, as a wrap in flour tortilla & just as a salad on lettuce leaves. The texture is great with the crispness of the apple & celery & the little lift of the curry powder in the dressing is really mild. I tasted the dressing before mixing together & thought it might've been a bit strong, but once combined & refrigerated until ready to serve, things came together really well. Next time I'll add more cranberries as a personal preference.

This is one of the best chicken salad recipes I've ever had, I doubled the recipe and served it for lunch with a few friends, I wouldn't change a thing, absolutely a 5 star rating from me.

Almost skipped over this! Came out really good! Great for leftover roast chicken. I had to change from curry to lemon pepper cause hubby gets headache from it somehow. But everything else the same! We had on bagel thins open faced, and he was surprised how filling it was :)!

I liked this. It's not too different from my favorite chicken salad but the curry powder and apples were a nice change. I used Greek yogurt instead of mayo because that's what I always do for chicken salad. I don't like the taste of it with mayo. I was out of pecans and used walnuts instead. I used whole wheat bread and didn't cut out shapes. I made this for Recipe Group last week.
