This dish was amazing!  I made a few changes to the original recipe, though.  In the marinade, I added a tbsp or so of spiced rum.  I used half as much rice since 2 cups of uncooked rice expands into an amount that I can't eat by myself (even 1 cup of dry is still a little too much for 4 servings).  I made the biggest changes in the salsa: I cooked the mango following the recipe but then I put it in the refrigerator.  I chopped up half a medium red onion, 1 avocado, 1 banana, and a little bit of fresh cilantro.  I tossed that with the mango.  On the side I wilted some fresh spinach in a little bit of chicken broth seasoned with garlic and red pepper flakes.

This recipe was excellent. I made it two ways (One with Mahi and one with Extra Firm Tofu), the tofu was excellent vegetarian alternative.  Just make sure you press it and broil it for an addition 10-15 minutes.   Otherwise prepare exactly the same.  I substituted long grain brown rice and light coconut milk to lighten it up a bit, it was very good, but I imagine it would be better with the regular coconut milk.   I cut back on the red peppers a bit and it was still pretty spicy, so be careful with this… you can always ad more; the coconut rice and mango do help to balance out the heat.   Also I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and made a salsa to go along with it, a combination of avocado, cilantro, lime and salt…. YUM!  I made a batch of the marinade and used it to sauté veggies for the side (Red bell peppers, mushroom, broccoli and red onion). It was very good and complimented the dish nicely.   This recipe is a keeper! I think I will also try it with tilapia next time as recommended by another reviewer.

If I could give this receipe 10 stars I would. This is the best recipe I have found on this site. I did not change a thing I just cut everything in half because I only made this recipe for 2 not 4. I see some people have been cutting back on the red pepper but I wouldn't and didn't. If you eat the fish on it own it would be too hot but plated the way the recipe tells you to it is perfect. All of the flavors go very well together and makes this recipe a true winner!

This was AMAZING, honestly one of the best Mahi Mahi dishes I have ever had let alone cooked.  It was very easy to make and the flavors complimented each other well.  The fish is slightly spicy, it would be wonderful served as is without the rice and Mango salsa but it really completes the dish when served together.  The only thing I changed is that I grilled the fish instead of broiling it.  I don't think it would have been nearly as good broiled.  I will be making this again, thanks for the recipe!!

Absolutely Wonderful!!! Followed the recipe with the exception of changing the number of servings to 6 and adding a couple TBS of diced red and orange bell pepper to the finished mango salsa and sprinkling of cilantro before serving.  My rice had absorbed all the water in a shorter period of time than listed (approx 12 min) so I added approx. 1/4 cup of water and cooked for a few min before adding the coconut milk and sugar. The rice was delicious as instructed but next time I will add more coconut milk/water and cook a little longer (personal pref). We are already looking forward to adding this to the rotation for our big Sunday dinners and when we have company. Thanks for sharing!

an amazing meal! i did a few changes though on how i cooked my rice...i cooked it in a rice cooker...basically i just put all the ingredients in the rice cooker stir it..and instead of using 2 cups of water and a cube of bouillon, i used 2 cups of chicken broth and a dash of salt because i only have the 25% less sodium broth and yah it turned out great...the fish i did marinate and cooked as is...and yah my entire family loved it...no leftovers at all! very yummy! will definitely make this again and again!

This was by far one of the simplest and best tasting Mahi recipes I've found. I served it for guests who all asked for the recipe, which I took as a good sign! Visually I like the look of salsa on top of the fish, so I chopped the mango much smaller than in the photo and added some cilantro and finely chopped green onion to it as well.  I was skeptical about the method of cooking the rice, worrried it may come out sticky but it was perfect and I've made it again since as a side dish to other meals.  This is definitely a keeper.

Unbelievable good!  My kids said it was the best fish they've ever had!  I made the rice & mango salsa too and added grilled zucchini as a side dish.  Only thing I changed was I added more fresh garlic to the marinade.  I couldn't find a ripe fresh mango so I had to use Doles jarred mango & it was wonderful.  Would recommend fresh if you can get it though.   Yummy!  Thank you!  I added a photo of our meal because she didn't have one on this recipe page.  Enjoy!

Yummy! My Husband, kids and niece (5, 2, and 9months) all devoured this. Felt like I made the recipe pretty much spot on, but after thinking about it I guess I did change up some things... Forgot the ginger in the marinade, used brown rice with 1 cup water and 1 cup homemade chicken stock, no bouillon. Followed some of the other suggestions for the mango salsa by adding some onion, finely chopped sweet red pepper with the mango, after it was done I threw in some cubed avocado and a splash of lemon juice. Next time I'll add cilantro, lime juice and red onion. But otherwise it was delish. Its definitely going into our rotation of dinners. I did use like a 1/4 the amount of red pepper flakes because my kids are super spice wimps. And I thought it was perfect but I still had to scrape off some of the spices left on the fish for them. Its just cuz of the hot spots left from the flakes.

This was good, but even though I cut back on the amount of the red pepper flakes, it was a bit too hot for our tastes.  The mango was a wonderful cooling accompanyment.

This was awesome!  I loved the rice, the fish was tasty (I didn't put as much red pepper flakes in because I'm a wimp) and I used mango salsa from costco.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very good-nice combination of flavors.  I doubled the marinade because I had larger pieces of fish and it was hot and spicy!

This was a good starting point for a recipe. I subbed coconut oil for butter, light coconut milk for regular, and coconut palm sugar for white to make it a little healthier.

A few things I did change:
The marinade needed more liquid so I doubled the liquid ingredients and added hot sauce. The coconut rice was a little chewy so I added some more chicken broth and cooked a while longer. And the "salsa." Butter and mango does not a salsa make! I added cilantro, tomatoes, avocado, pineapple, a healthy portion of hot sauce, and omitted the sugar, and it was delicious!

I bought 3.5 lbs of Mahi Mahi and made this for a Caribbean-themed dinner party.  The only thing I did differently was make a fresh fruit salsa to accompany the fish, which one of the other reviewers suggested.  The entire dish was devoured and people kept sneaking off to the kitchen to pull more rice out of the bottom of the pan.  They loved the fish and they loved the rice.  Since I was feeding 12, I made the entire rice batch and it was gone.  If you are feeding four, it is a lot of rice to make.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This dish is so good and pretty simple. I only used half the red pepper and it was just the right spiciness. I recommend doubling the mango. I just thought more mango with each bite would have made it even more perfect. Man oh Man this was sooooo good. I felt like I was in a Mediterranean restaurant.

Didn't try the mango salsa, but the fish marinade is out of this world! Very tasty with Mahi Mahi. I found the rice to be too sweet for us. If I make again I will cut back to 1T or less. Will keep this recipe just for the fish marinade!

This recipe is wonderful as is...no changes needed!  I was worried that it would be too sweet and I was unsure about using soy sauce with fish but WOW what an awesome surprise just the perfect mix of flavors, my husband and son are not fish fans but even they said this was a winner!

Followed recipe as written and felt it was almost too spicy (and I like spice!) that it took away from the Mahi Mahi flavor. That being said, I would make it again, but will cut back on some of the spice. Otherwise, I thought the marinade was great, and will actually consider using this same marinade on other meats. Used store bought mango salsa for convenience.

This dish was excellent. The marinade was right on...however I did reduce the red pepper flakes to 1/8 tsp. and I marinated the fish overnight instead of 1 hour. I made the rice with 2 cups of homemade chicken stock rather than the water and bouillon cube, but everything else the same- fantastic! For the salsa, I diced up fresh mango and mixed it with cilantro, red onion, poblano pepper, salt and lime juice. This dish is a wonderful blend of flavors and textures, and is also pleasing to the eye! Will make again!!

I think it wold have been 5 stars if I hadn't used real coconut milk.  the rice didn't have much flavor but my 9 year old asked me why I didn't buy more mahi mahi! It was a very welcome change to our regular routine and didn't take too much extra shopping time or prep time.  This is a great one to mix things up, or impress the in laws!

While this was good, It was very sweet.  next time I'm just making the jasmine rice without the coconut and sugar and will add something spicy to the mango salsa like jalapenos.

Overall, quick and delicious!
Did not make coconut rice, just served over plain white rice.  If you make it and have children consider reducing crushed red pepper.  Also, if you have really sweet mangos you may consider reducing the amount of sugar in the salsa!  Overall, quick and delicious!

Wow.  We had this tonight for dinner and it was awesome.  Normally I will tweak a recipe, but for this I followed the recipe pretty much to a T.  The coconut rice was a HUGE hit with my fiance, who is generally not a fan of coconut.  If I were to add anything to this, it would be some nice chopped cilantro at the end.  Overall, I rate this delicious!

Made this tonight. I did double the marinade part as I had double the fish called for. Other than that, and using a whole can of coconut milk, I followed the recipe to the letter! I did not use my rice cooker but will do so next time. It was outstanding!5* all the way! The heat from the hot pepper was perfect with sweet of the mango and coconut rice.

The review is for the coconut rice.  I used regularly Japanese rice, and put the ingredients into our rice cooker.  It was something different, if you're looking for a different way to make rice.  It wasn't bad, but we prefer our rice with sesame oil in the rice cooker, or seasoned fried rice.

I made this recipe with chicken breast instead of the fish because the fish was so expensive. It was amazing! My family of 7 gobbled it up and raved about it and also loved the rice. I served it with a side of papaya salad (shredded papaya with lime juice) for a full Caribbean meal. This is one of my new favorite recipes!

Nothing short of superb.  Flavors blended beautifully without anything overly predominant.  Had to cut the pepper flakes in half for wife's pallet, otherwise by the book.  Would serve this to anyone, anytime,

Easy to make and delicious I made it with fish for the grown ups and a second batch with chicken cutlets for the kids... It went over great!..the only change I made is that I added some diced red peppers to the mango salsa to give it some color...tasted best when you used a bed of rice then put the fish on then topped it off with the salsa...it's a keeper!

That was the best Mahi Mahi we have ever had! My husband liked it so much he was finding reasons to take the fish of our girls' plates. 'Hey, what is that?' 'No Dad. I'm not falling for that one.'

This was an an awesome recipe!  The sweetness of the coconut rice and the tart and sweet taste of the mango salsa was absolutely perfect with the spicy mahi mahi.  This recipe is very easy to make and will make you look like quite the chef between the taste and presentation!

Instead of broiling, I baked the Mahi with all the marinating ingredients! Turned out great! The flavors really compliments each other very well! Also, I used brown rice instead of white rice and less butter and sugar to cut down on some of the calories.

EAsy and delicious! Made it for a guest last night and it was perfect. Some notes:
1. Used splenda and LIGHT coconut milk but I'm sure the non-healthy version would be even better. In fact, I would definitely use regular coconut milk, maybe could get away with half-sugar, half-splenda. But everyone else thought it was delicious, maybe it was in my head.
2. Used frozen cubed mango from Trader Joe's. Couldn't be simpler! I detest prepping mango, and in a dish like this where you're going to cook the mango anyway, this is probably even better.
3. Cooked the rice in a rice cooker w/ 2 cups of chicken broth then on the stove with the coconut milk.
4. Grilled on our George Foreman grill for 4 minutes. Perfect!

Yummy. Left out the salt in the marinade as it has soy sauce. Works nice to marinate in a flat baking dish and cook with the marinade as there is not so much sauce. Left out the sugar in the rice and put the cut up green onions in with the mango to give it more salsa flavor.

It was phenomenal, the only problem was the “salsa” was just mango and sugar. I made my own salsa with diced strawberries, mango, papaya, Pinapple, jalapeño, red onion, cilantro and some fresh lime juice.  It was soooo good.  I thawed frozen tropical mix for pinapple, papaya and pinapple-and some fresh strawberries.

Amazing dish!   I used 1 tsp of the Red Pepper flakes - it  was plenty spicy for us.  Like other reviewers I added Cilantro and Avocado to the Mango Salsa because I thought it would add another layer of flavors but it is not needed.  Next time I will double the Mango Salsa because it was delicious.

This recipe is incredibly tasty.  The store did not have mahi mahi so I bought fresh halibut.  I used just a pinch of red pepper flakes rather than the recipe.  I thought that would be too much hot.   Everyone loved the outcome.

This was a hit. The only modification I made was that I made a separate mango salsa to go on top of the dish and did not use ginger on the fish simply because I did not have any and did not feel like going to the store. But otherwise a keeper. Make it, you won’t be disappointed.

I made this dish and it was excellent!!! I would give it 5 stars but the recipe was flawed. The topping is supposed to be mango salsa. I did not realize until I had already made it that the recipe only calls for mango. I will make this again but will serve it with actual mango salsa.

I love this recipe and can't wait to make it again.  When on vacation in Hawaii we found some very fresh MahiMahi and fresh mango.  I made it according to the recipe with a couple of exceptions.  When I made the mango salsa I added some finely chopped sweet red bell pepper and a green onion thinly sliced and about a teaspoon of rice vinegar.  I also toasted about a quarter cup of coconut and added it to the rice just before serving.

Very good! My family loved it. I used cooked jasmin rice made the night before and just added the coconut milk and the chicken bouillon I precrushed to a pot on the stove and heated it once the bouillon was dissolved  added the rice. I kind of wish there was more to the mango salsa, but the dish was very tasty as written and my family really enjoyed it. Even my 14 year old.  My husband said, "I loved it!" when asked how he liked it, so it's a winner! Thanks for the new recipe!!

Great fish recipe. The mango played nicely against the red pepper on the Mahi. I grill the Mahi instead of broiling.

I made this dish with some coconut shrimps as a starter and this meal made my family very happy! The marinade smells so tropical and so good and put you in a vacation mode... I needed to make a cocktail to keep on going with the cooking. ;) I feel like I have to get creative and try more recipe variations with this marinade combination. Wonderful meal idea and recipe. Thank you!

Such an AMAZING recipe!!!!! This is one of the best Mahi recipes ever. The only change I made was not using so much red pepper flakes. Maybe next time I will add onions and peppers to the salsa as suggested. Will definitely add to the rotation......

Fish had a nice flavor.  I cooked it on the grill.  Unfortunately the rice was too firm, tried to adjust the liquid by adding more water but it just ended up being to mushy.

Our family enjoyed this dish so much. It tasted light and moist,  yet it was quite filling. I loved the method of broiling, as well as its pairing of the mango salsa. Delicious!  My mango salsa was not cooked; but rather, it consisted of fresh mango, cilantro, diced red onion, and a splash of vinegar and sugar- seasoned to taste with a bit of pepper/salt and squeezed lemon.

The fish was awesome.  So flavorful with the added spice of the pepper.  The only reason for a 4 is that the rice didn’t come out as well as I would have wanted.  A little too crunchy for my taste and wanted a little more of the coconut flavor.

The rice was delicious, fish was tender and delicate, and the marinade was spectacular!  (I left out the pepper flakes as my daughter is spicy-avoidant for now.)

To make the mango salsa look a little prettier, I sprinkled in some pre-chopped basil before sautéing.  (Oh!  I found this great little find in the produce section of about 4 oz of chopped, fresh basil that lasts 4 weeks in the refrigerator!  -- a time saver).

This was so good, I can't wait for the leftovers for lunch today!

We loved the coconut rice. I made it in my rice cooker and it turned out perfect. The fish was good but the family didn't love the mango salsa. I will make again, perhaps with a tomato, onion and cilantro topping instead.

This recipe was so good that even my 2.5 and 5 year old loved it. I did not add red pepper flakes to marinade, and cut back on black pepper because my kids won't eat spicy things. They both asked for more fish, and I still loved the fish without the spice. I cooked rice in rice cooker by mixing all ingredients together before I cooked it. It turned out great. In fact, my daughter and I at the leftover rice with coconut milk and cinnamon for dessert.

Even my pickiest eater loved it.  I cut the red pepper flakes in half because I was cooking for children and I didn't want it to be too spicy.  I also added more water to the rice as mine was still a little crunchy.  I will definitely add this to the rotation.

Instead of mixing the sweet mango w/ sugar  I tossed it w/ fresh basil, cilantro, pico de gallo and lime juice.  Next time I would add fresh jalapeno for a little extra heat.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is delicious!  I've been wanting to make this dish for a while but the long list of ingredients scared me off.  I thought it would be too complicated.  But I just couldn't resist anymore and so I made it tonight for dinner.  I am so happy I did and my family loved it!  I made it just as the recipe states but reduced the amount of red pepper since we are sensitive to spicy foods.  The coconut rice was perfect, not too sweet, and the sweetness of the mango perfectly complemented the slightly spicy fish.  I will definitely be making this for dinner again.  :)

The fish marinade was amazing! Next time I would add some jalapeños and red peppers to the mango salsa. Also, I would just make jasmine rice. I couldn't really taste the coconut and it just added calories to the dish.

I added extra ginger to the marinade. For the salsa I used agave syrup instead of sugar, added some chopped pineapple, red bell pepper, mint leaves,avocado & banana. Sprinkled on a little lemon juice. Cooled the salsa b4 using. For the rice, I added finely diced mango.  Wife really liked it. It's a keeper

I didn't use red pepper flakes for the salsa, sub Jalapeno. I like the spice of jalapeno moreso than red pepper flake. One of my favorite dishes during the summer and the kids love it just as much.

Used honey instead of sugar and added a red pepper to the mango slaw on top. Also did the rice in the rice cooker using 1.5 cups. And sub sole for the fish...double the marinade recipe for 6 pieces.

My whole family thought this was delicious! The grocery store didn't have mahi mahi, so I made it with rockfish.  The fishmonger said swordfish and halibut would also work. I made the recipe as is (although I halved the rice and red pepper) and thought it was wonderful. To add just a little something, I cut up some avocado and put some kosher salt on it and served that with the fish as well. That was a nice addition.  I know other people have made salsas with avocado and lime and cilantro. That would be good if you had all the ingredients handy (I didn't). Served with steamed broccoli. ***Note: even though I halved the red pepper flakes, it was still a tad spicy for my kids. Last time I made it I cut the red pepper to 1/2 tsp. and black pepper to 1/2 tsp. It was perfect. Also, this time we used tilapia. I liked that better!

This is definitely a keeper. The one comment I have is that this is not mango salsa, but just mango. Salsa implies that there would be more than one ingredient. I would recommend adding peppers and cilantro. Also I keep my salsa fresh and cool instead of cooking it in the butter. The mahi and coconut rice were amazing as written.

Great marinade, rice was fantastic and the mango was amazing! I added some lemon mint to the mango I had in the garden :) and cut the sugar a touch but I always do that.

I made this dish on a weekday and it turned out simply delicious! Its very simple and easy to make , nicely described. If you do just according to all the instructions it can me made  within two hours (one hour marination for fish) I used chicken broth instead of chicken bouillon. Taste of rice did not change, but you need to be careful adding the broth as we are also adding coconut milk in the rice. I would highly recommend trying this recipe.

I made this using chicken instead of fish, I messed it up by doubling recipe but quadrupling marinade (wayyyy too hot with the  crushed red pepper, need to just put a dab in marinade and then brush off before cooking). Flavor was excellent, just way too hot.

Very good! Big hit with the family.  Made this a few weeks ago but for the salsa i also added red and yellow bell peppers, chopped cilantro and a little Fresh mint once it was done cooking and this turned out Delish!!  Making it again tonight using cod and trying the vegetarian option that someone mentioned in their comment (extra firm tofu- pressed dry and prepared exactly same as fish but adding 10-15min to cooking time).

this dish is super quick and easy- I recommend marinating your fish the morning of. and I think the rice recipe should be double the rice, or half the water

This was really good!   I did follow some of the reviewers' recommendations by decreasing red pepper flakes to 1 tsp, glad I did.  And for the chutney, after cooking mango, I put it in the refrigerator and then added 1/2 chopped red onion, 1 avocado, 1 banana, and cilantro to the mango.

I loved the fish, but I did serve it with a different mango salsa recipe that I found on here and I think that made it even better.  I used mackerel that I had from a deep sea fishing expedition.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Even my husband, who usually doesn't like fish, thought it was great.  I didn't broil the fish but instead cooked it at 450 degrees.  To make it even easier, I used a store-bought mango salsa instead of messing with chopping up a mango myself.

Omg de'lish. Minor changes- 1 cup of brown jasmine rice, 7oz of coconut milk, didn't have red pepper flakes so used 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. Marinated steaks for 2.5 hours.

Really good! The only thing I did differently was to marinade for 3 hours and scrapping off all/most of the marinade before broiling for the kidlets. Next time I would go ahead and make a full mango salsa recipe like Grilled Tilapia with Mango Salsa.

This was really delicious! I'm allergic to mango, so I substituted nectarine (worked well in this instance) and added red bell peppers and a hint of serrano pepper to the salsa. We will be making this again.

This was delicious!  I followed it as written except for adding a little cilantro to the mangos right before they finished.  The fish is very spicy which was fine for my husband and I but if spice isn't your thing then cut the red pepper flakes way back.  Next time I will only make half the rice as there was a lot left over.  Thank ypu for such a great meal!!  Can wait to make it again!

Great  recipe.  I made this on Valentines Day and my partner really enjoyed it.  I didn't use the chicken bouillon, Mahi Mahi or the jasmine rice, instead I  used long grain white rice cooked in the rice cooker and talipia and omitted the bouillon.  The rice turned out great and the talipia was a wonderful substitute.  I would most definitely  try this again.

Great recipe. The marinade is to die for. I don't recommend any changes. I've made it a couple times now, and I make the salsa differently (although the recipe is good). I add red pepper and lime juice to make it a bit more traditional.

I loved the coconut rice, it is now a staple in my home!! However, I did tweak the coconut rice recipe, because the Maggi cube was extremely powerful and made the rice taste like chicken and coconut. The only thing I took out the rice recipe was the Maggi cube! The rice has a buttery and a real nice coconuty taste. I didn't like the fish, but instead of making the mahi mahi with those seasonings; I made balsamic vinaigrette marinade for the fish. Extremely Delicious!

Super tasty!  I exchanged the rice for quinoa which I do for all my recipes that call for rice. We 
Ike the extra protein and lower carbs. Personal preference. I reduced the quinoa to 1 cup but left all liquid amounts the same. I exchanged the butter for olive oil as well (make sure you check the substitutes online as you don't need as much olive oil as butter). I added red bell peppers, red onion and cilantro to the salsa. Soooo good, all my kids (12,8 and 4) couldn't get enough. My four year old HATES spicy so I was worried but you can't taste the heat when eaten all together.  Will definitely make this again! THANK YOU for sharing!

I have made this twice, using frozen Mahi Mahi fillets from Costco, once broiling the fish and once grilling it.  Turned out great both ways.  I added red pepper to my salsa, more for colour than taste.  I made the coconut rice in my rice cooker using 1c of rice and 1 can of coconut milk topped up with water to make 2 c.  This dish tastes fantastic and looks beautiful too.  Definitely company worthy.

Loved it.  Added cilantro and avocado to the mango mix.  Grilled the fish and served with a side of grilled zucchini.

My husband loved this recipe, but my kids could not eat it because it was so spicy.  It was very good and my husband loved the spice.  I'd say if you have kids or are sensitive to spicy, maybe cut the red pepper to make it more tolerable.

I grilled the fish on the bar-b-que, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written and I am glad that I did. I was afraid that it would be to spicey, but the hot spice with the sweet mango salsa and the cocoanut rice was delicious!

Wonderful dish. I will be making this again. I had to make some adjustments based on what I had at my disposal. I used coconut cream instead of milk, and I skipped the lime. I didn't marinate the fish for a full hour – just until I'd prepped everything else. It still had plenty of scrumptious flavor. Also, I just put all the rice ingredients into my rice cooker and it worked perfectly. The rice was sooo good (I actually think the cream made it rich and fluffy). Also, I didn't have jasmine rice on hand (I live in Costa Rica, and it's expensive and sometimes hard to find here). The regular rice worked fine; although I'm sure jasmine would have been even better. I served it with steamed sweet red peppers and green beans (which conveniently cook in the steamer over the rice cooker). Colorful and delicious dish. Give it a go tonight!

Delicious, healthy and so easy! My husband loves mahi mahi and this is the first time I cooked it--he loved it...said I 'out did myself' haha! Only change I made was couscous instead of rice. The red pepper marinade complimented the mango perfectly! Will definitely make this again!

Made this for the first time a few weeks ago and my husband said "this is a restaurant quality meal".  Needless to say, we've had it a few more times since then.  I just make a few modifications to reduce the sugar - instead of the suggested prep for the coconut rice, I make 2 cups rice in the rice cooker with a can of coconut milk and I add another can full of water (it comes out rich and delicious, but not sweet). Also cut the sugar from the fruit, which lately I've been substituting pineapple for the mango.  Try this, it is delicious!

We thought the recipe was delicious. I used hallibut and any fish would be yummy. I used brown jasmine rice and had to cook 15 minutes longer before adding the milk.  Next time I will 1/2 the pepper flakes, because a little too hot. For four people, I think I would double the salsa.

We thought the fish was really good. I cut the red pepper in half, based on others' comments that it was rather spicy, and it still had a bit of heat.
 I enjoyed the mango, but others thought it was overpowered by the fish. 
The rice was decent, but I didn't think it was worth the calories and fat content the coconut milk brings to the mix!

This was easy and excellent!  I agree that the mango and coconut flavors balance the spicy fish.  I added cilantro and fresh lime juice to the mango salsa and it was even more delicious.  I also used white fish instead of mahi mahi. This is my favorite new recipe of the year!

I only made the rice, but it was really good. I made the rice in a rice cooker. Then I added the sugar and coconut milk and gently mixed it in. The rice absorbed the milk really fast. Plan to make it again!

This recipe is fantastic. It's simple and delicious. A great way to wow your friends without having advanced culinary skills! :)
Changes I made (or would make)… I had 2 4 oz filets and the marinade was a perfect amount.  I’d make more marinade if there are more filets (like double the recipe). I didn’t add ginger and I added the full amount of red pepper. It definitely was not too spicy. I also added the green onions and a little less black pepper than it called for.

For the rice, I halfed the recipe and used vegetable bouillion (just a little) instead of chicken boullion. That was the perfect amount for 2. If you’re serving 4, what the recipe calls for is perfect.
For the mango salsa, I used frozen mango from Trader Joe’s and followed the recipe. But like some of the reviewers said, the salsa is good if you add a few other things. Rather than adding my own cilantro and onion and avocado, I bought a mango/peach salsa and mixed it in with the mangos I had cooked on the stove. It was the perfect balance of ALL flavors!!

Happy cooking!!

Wow, this was incredible and so simple. I loved all of the flavors together! I was expecting the mango to be more of a sauce, but it still came out wonderfully for what it was. I'll be making this again for sure!

EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT.  CUT WAY BACK ON THE RED PEPPER THOUGH IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT REALLY HOT.  I PUT A 1/2 TSP OF RED PEPPER AND IT STILL HAD A NICE BURN TO IT.  PERFECT FOR MY TASTE.

Pretty easy to make although remember that you need an hour to marinade the Mahi.  The coconut rice and mango compliment the heat/spiciness from the marinade.  My wife even thought it was great and she's not as much of a seafood person as I.
