I love this recipe, I have personally made it at least a dozen times and have given it to many of my friends to try. However I havent tryed changing the recipe or altering it in any way. I dont think that you could judge a recipe poorly because you made the mistake of changing it and it didnt turn out well.

Delicious... This recipe was very tasty.The only thing I changed was that I used the Texas Enchilada sauce recipe I found on this website instead of canned.Sure to be a pleaser with friends and family.

This is a very good recipe, I would surely make it again.. however, I think I will use real onion as well as green.. and you don't need to mico the fish ahead of time. 45 minutes was more than enough for my fish to cook all the way through.

I love this recipe.  I have followed the recipe exactly, and I have also altered it.  Don't have fish, that's ok...add some spinach and corn instead and you have a wonderful veggy enchilada.  I've even made it as a casserole dish for my son's 1st birthday party to save time on rolling.  I made them without fish even, and got rave reviews.  Thanks for such a wonderful and diverse recipe!

To be honest, I wasn’t sure how the dish is going to turn out. So, I wasn’t expecting much. I was VERY surprised to find out how delicious the enchiladas are!

I microwaved orange roughy with garlic salt and lemon pepper. Also, I used about half the amount of enchilada sauce because I didn’t want them to be too spicy for my mom. Served enchiladas with store made guacamole since avocados didn’t look too promising at the store.

Really good recipe!  My microwave is the slowest oldest machine in existance so I just did the precooking step on the stovestop.  I left out the cheese because I figured it would be creamy and yummy enough with the sour cream and avocado, and so I might as well ditch the excessive calories (not that I have anything against cheese, it was a whim!).  I was also too lazy to make rolled enchiladas, so I layered the tortillas and fish "New Mexican style" but to be honest, I think this recipe would have been much better if I had taken the time to roll them, so next time I will.  Cilantro and lime on top of the finished product makes it perfect!  Thanks!

These are so wonderful. I make a bit more filling in a couple less tortillas though. I like mine stuffed! I've also toyed with using red onion instead of and/or with the green onion. And also topping with spicy diced green chiles.  I'm able to make the recipe perfectly with only one can of enchilada sauce as well. Just variations on a fabulous recipe.

I used black beans and red peppers in place of green peppers... smoky adobe chipotle peppers too!!  I had frozen tilapia fish to use up and this was such a great disguise for normally gross fish :)

Wonderful and enjoyed by the whole family. I used tilapia and added some chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (small amt) and used medium spicy enchilada sauce as we all like some heat. Used whole grain tortillas.  Put it in my "Tried and Like" collection.

Outstanding dish-perfect for a dinner party or Sunday night supper.  I made the tortillas from scratch, but flour or corn store-bought are great, too.

This was amazing!  Quite easy to cook and absolutely delicious.  I substituted tilapia for halibut, used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder, and used a little less green bell pepper.  I may try to make a lower fat version soon with fat-free mayo and light sour cream and less cheese.  It might also be good as a casserole, without the tortillas!  Fantastic!

This recipe was excellent!!!!!! I added a few pinches of seasonings to the meat - cumin, cayenne pepper and paprika. I used a 14 oz can of green enchilada sauce as my husband and I don't care for the red. I used 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 green pepper and only a 1/2 bunch of green onions. I used light sour cream and mayo. We loved this recipe and will make it many times again, even for company. Thanks for sharing!!!!

I made this impromtu for dinner tonite and used what I had on hand. I used low carb tortillas and it came out mushy.  I used sole which was what I had and left out the cilantro cuz I didn't have any.  Used plain yogurt instead of sour cream,  threw in extra Mexican cheese, chopped garlic, extra S & P into the sauce and used canned mild enchilada sauce which was still on the spicy side (too spicy for the kids). Wasn't overly impressed with the outcome. Don't think I'll make this again.

My favorite are the people who completely change a recipe. Then wonder why it isn't good. Or maybe you don't like fish? Or maybe your not a good cook!!!

These were very good.  I made them because I cannot find my other recipe for halibut enchiladas that are made with a white sauce!  I will have to find it, but these come in a good second.  I did not have to make any alterations, we all thought they were pretty good.

This was very good. I used regular onions and used low fat on the cheese and sour cream. I did not precook the fish, as a previous reviewer had said, "45 minutes is plenty of time to cook fish".

It was tasty, and I was happily suprised, although the fish got mixed too much with the other ingredients and a little overcooked--which made it seem almost like expensive canned tuna.  The flavor was good, only my fish mixture lacked texture.  I think I'll try it again with chicken, or just the cheese mixture (to save fish $)...I think it would be just as good & the mixture was tasty!

Loved it!  Was a little nervous about the combination of fish and enchiladas since it was not something I had tried before, but it was fabulous.  A very different and tasty way to serve fish.

This was my first attempt at enchiladas and it went quite well!!!  I made half fish, half chicken since my counterpart doesnt like fish.  I browned a chicken after seasoning with salt, pepper, chili powder and garlic powder and then shredded it.  Both versions were excellent!! Oh and I also used low fat sour cream and mayo and it still tasted delicious!

Ya'll can shoot the messenger, but this was very good with plain ol' cheap catfish. I questioned wasting $15+ per pound halibut on something like this so I just used what was in the freezer: catfish nuggets. Very good! I suspect cod or another whitefish would also do well. 
 
My only criticism with the recipe is not telling us the size of the tortillas. I used 8" and it was way too much filling for the 8 of them.

Really good one, Keeps fish moist. Great recipe for prep meals. 
even better after is was frozen. One thing, keep enchiladas closed to each other but not too tight.

I used slightly less green chili sauce because I was feeding it to children but I’m sure it would have been even more delicious followed exactly but it was still very good and moist. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I prefer to bake the halibut just until flaky instead of microwaving it. My family loves these!

The recipe is super easy. I love the freshness that the cilantro, bell pepper, and green onion provides. I did not microwave the fish, and highly recommend not... risk of changing texture, overcooking, and causing "fishy" taste. I made 8: 4 flour and 4 corn (Large corn, not the small ones). I would have given 5 stars, because the flavor is fantastic, the texture/tenderness and taste of the halibut is spot on, and all the flavors just melded beautifully... however, I made an error somewhere along the recipe, because the flour tortillas were soggy, and the corn tortillas were mush. Regardless, the flavor of the filling is totally worth playing with the recipe again... think I'll try skipping flour all together and go with the corn tortillas... also, I will skip dipping the tortilla in the enchilada sauce, as well as skip putting sauce at the bottom of the pan. Hopefully by cooking my corn tortillas first in coconut oil (this is what I do when making pulled pork or chicken enchiladas), just enough to make them pliable without tearing, and skipping the dipping and sauce on the bottom, I'll have the amazing flavor of the filling, with the presentation of a traditional enchilada. Again, great great flavor, I am sure I made an error to cause the soggy tortillas, so I will tweak the amount of sauce and the tortilla prep to correct this. Thank you for the recipe!

Very good and fun take on halibut. We have a ton of halibut from my husbands yearly fishing trip and this is a fun and different way to use it. We personally like spicier foods so next time I will kick it up a notch by doing our own enchilada sauce or adding jalapenos. There are endless variations to adding beans/corn. We pan seared a large fillet for a few minutes rather than microwaving.

Delicious!
I couldn't force myself to spray dimethyl silicon into my food from cooking spray. i also sauted my fish.  My experience is the microwave rubberizes fish and meats (proteins).
Microwaves zap valuable vitamins and minerals quicker than conventional cooking.
This was an excellent dish!  I'll cook it again and again!

Had more than two pounds of halibut so doubled the rest of the ingredients.  Made as directed except added some yellow onion too.  Everyone loved it!  Great recipe for coastal Alaskans because we eat A LOT of  halibut.

This recipe is soooo good. I have made it probably 10 times and it is always a huge hit. We make a dairy free version as well with daiya cheese, tofutti 'better than sour cream' and veganiese. It is seriously so good. It has become one of my go-tos.

What a great way to put fish into my kids diet.  After they finished it, they said "That was fish?"  I did make the fish ahead in a frypan with pam rather than microwave it.  The idea of slimy microwaved fish didn't appeal to me.  I also substituted white onion (which I also cooked in the same frypan) just cause I didn't have green onions on hand.

I made this most exactly to recipe and they were amazing! Halibut was unbelievably expensive ($22/pound) so I used Mahi-Mahi which is mild but meaty fish just like Halibut. It was a hit with my family and guests! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe

I made this with fresh stripper that my son caught.  I fried the fish in olive oil with onion (seasoned the fish as per the recipe).   I used a can of green chilies instead of green pepper.  I used all the other ingredients it called for inside the enchilada.  This is a bomb fish salad.   I have to give you 5 stars just for that!!  I made the rest of the dish and am waiting for it to get done.  Love this recipe so far.

I used cod instead of halibut.  I served it with Arborio rice that had black beans, cilantro, and sea salt.

I had orange roughy on hand so that is what was used for this recipe.  Good enough to make again. My husband loved it.

Great recipe. I used tilapia (definitely cheaper than halibut!) and my own combo of veggies based on what I had at home, and it still turned out delish. Can't wait to make again.
