Easy and delicious. I followed the recipe but doubled up on the lime zest and juice. I decorated with Cool Whip I piped from a piping bag, and grated lime peel. It was beautiful. Everyone loved it.

The texture is good, but you can't really taste the lime. I am not a big fan of plain cheesecake, but I like flavored cheesecakes, so I was disappointed. Hubby liked it, though, but when I told him it was a lime cheesecake, he didn't believe me.
