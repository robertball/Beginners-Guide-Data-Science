Best if left overnight to soak in all of the creamy goodness. You may find it to be too sloppy if you serve it same day.

It seems to me there has to be a typo in this recipe in either the sour cream amount or the mayo. I halved the recipe thereby requiring 1/4c sour cream and 3/4c Mayo - a total of 1 c. is a lot for 2 potatoes - the result was more like potato soup. I had to drain/scrape off as much as I could to make this palatable. It also benefits from a pinch of sugar a pinch of salt and a good shake of pepper. Overall I will likely stick with my old recipe but it was nice to try something new.
