2 thumbs up!  Of all the slow cooker roast recipes I have tried... there have been many due to my hectic schedule, this is by far the easiest and most tasty.  I added quartered potatoes and baby carrots to the cooker to complete this meal.  The coloring of the veggies due to the packet mixes were inviting. The flavor was exceptional. Thanks for such a keeper killer recipe!

4 stars for ease of preparation. I have been making versions of this roast for years. It can be made with 1 can beef broth instead of the gravy mix and water; water & gravy- or broth-, and Italian dressing mix; or 2 pkg Italian dressing mix, beef broth -or water & gravy mix-; any combination works. The sodium content will vary with what you end up using. It falls apart so you can easily shred for sandwiches. Also I've made with top or bottom round for less fat. I usually fix mashed potatoes with it and don't salt them. Leftover beef and juices are good for beginnings of soup next day- refrigerate and then skim off the fat that has hardened.

My father in law made this same roast. Really good. I always braise the meat before I add it to the crockpot and add a sliced onion or two. Phenom gravy and really good over garlic/rosemary mashed potatoes. NOTE: If the inclination takes, you can use lemon-lime soda instead of the water. Also, if you're pinching pennies, this also works with stew meat.

I made this for dinner last night (we were having a potluck kinda thing... I made this beef for sandwiches). I only changed one thing and added another. Instead of water I used beef broth. I added 1 George Killians Irish Red beer in for flavor. Holy Ale this was the most tender beef roast w/incredible flavor! Everyone fell head over heels for this! :) I of course directed them to this site! Always find gems here! :)

Couldn't find Italian packet, so substituted 1/2 cup Italian salad dressing and omitted 1/2 cup of the water to compensate... Delish!  I will never make slow cooker roast any other way again.

I made this tonight. I've been making roasts in my crock pot or pressure cooker forever with the same old boring onion soup mix, so when I saw this recipe it got my attention as being "different". It went over so well, that I won't ever make it any other way. I was concerned about it being too salty so I used McCormick reduced sodium brown gravy mix and did not season the meat with salt. I would highly suggest this because it was plenty salty enough with this adjustment. I also wanted to make sure the gravy wasn't too thin so I coated the beef with flour, browned it and added an additional tablespoon of flour to the spice/water mixture. To my dismay, the "gravy" was like water when the roast was done. I removed the meat to a plate, covered with foil, and let it rest while I proceeded with making gravy out of the liquid. I cranked the crock pot up to high and did something I normally wouldn't have done, but I was way too lazy to make a gravy out of the normal flour roux. I mixed about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with about 2-3 tablespoons water in a bowl until dissolved and smooth, whisked it into the liquid in crock pot, covered it and let it go for about 10 minutes. Worked famously. The kids and husband tore this up and when they were done, they were already talking about leftovers for tomorrow.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was truly delicious. The whole family liked it. Here's what's good:

1) It makes its own gravy; there is nothing to do but serve once you get home from work or running errands.
2) The gravy is a lovely deep brown.
3) The gravy is neither too thick nor too thin.
4) The gravy is complex (likely from the Italian salad dressing mix), unlike standard corn starch gravies that you make yourself or pour from a can or jar--yet neither is it too herby-y.
5) No pre-browning of the meat. Browning is a wonderful thing, yes. But with this recipe it's not necessary. Besides, pre-browning messes up your stove with oil splatter and creates another item that has to be washed. I don't miss it!
6) This recipe is so easy that I handed it to my retired husband, and he was able to make it without the aid of my usual long list of instructions. Now that's easy.
7) I worried it would be too salty; it was not at all.
8) I worried it would be too commercial tasting: it was not at all.
9) The meat is fork tender and infused with flavor.

Tips: Cut any visible fat from the meat before you cook it, otherwise that fat will render directly into your gravy. Resist the temptation to use more than 1 cup of water; it's not necessary. 

I used 2.75 lb chuck roast on low for 6 hours. Perfect, absolutely perfect.

Instead of the water, I use a can of beef broth and add a sliced onion. Truly delicious... my family always goes crazy for this. They like it over egg noodles as opposed to adding taters and I'll usually add carrots to the mix. Great recipe, Kerstin!

Well....I reviewed this before it was published, but they didn't move my review!  SO, here you go again!  WONDERFUL!  This recipe is the BEST Roast I have ever had! I have made it several times, and it's always perfect! I have used the packets on chicken also, and it turned out really good, and used just the italian dressing/water on a pork tenderloin for pulled pork and it was great, but I will NEVER cook a roast any other way!  Thanks Kerstin!

Really easy and the kids loved it.  Chuck can be a bit fatty, so I strained the grease out of the "sauce" after cooking and before serving

I made this following recipe exactly and thought it smelled so bad that I wouldn't even eat it.  My son tasted it and said it was "ok" but I definitely won't be trying this one again!

If I could rate this a ten star I would. I added an onion, about 4 cut carrots and a 1/2 cup of white wine. I have been married 19 years and this is the best roast I have ever made. Makes a great gravy too it is a keeper.

I've made this on several occations, although never in the slow cooker.  Always in the oven.  As is, it is extremely salty!  I like the flavor, though, so I keep trying it.  I've tried using reduced sodium gravy mix, and it's still super salty.  This last time, I replaced the brown gravy mix with cracked peppercorn gravy mix for steak (1.25 oz).  It doesn't have any sodium at all.  It was SOOO much better, and still plenty salty enough.

Yummy!  I throw in some baby carrots, a couple of potatoes and a large onion cut in 6-8 pieces.  Then I drizzle half a bottle of beer over everything. This is so quick and easy to put in the crockpot at the start of a busy day.  Delicious meal waiting for you at dinner time!

This was VERY well received in my home (and it smelled like A MILLION BUCKS)!  I prepared this EXACTLY as described, and it was so tender, full of flavor, and was used for days after in sandwiches, over rice, with egg noodles. I made this roast last weekend, and I'm making it again this weekend at the behest of my family! This time, I am serving the roast with baked sweet potatoes and cinnamon-brown sugar-butter and pancetta roasted Brussels sprouts.  Perhaps the perfect meal!  Thanks, Kerstin, for this recipe!

We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this! I think that this is the best way that I have ever prepared a pot roast...The only change I made was to season the roast w/ salt, pepper and garlic powder and seared the meat in some evoo before putting it into the slow cooker. This smelled heavenly while cooking, and tasted even better, not to mention how fall-apart tender it was. I didn't find this salty at all, and we really enjoyed the gravy over the meat and mashed potatoes. The gravy does not come out like water, either...it's a nice consistancy, which is great! This is gonna be my new go-to for pot roast from now on~YUM! Thanks, Kerstin, for such a wonderful recipe! :)

This was good. The meat was very moist and tender. The flavor was good, but not "Wow." I added potatoes to it and I would make it again.

This was the first time I've ever made pot roast and I have to say, this was outstanding!  I followed it exactly with the exception of throwing in some quartered red skin potatoes.  After I took the roast and potatoes out I threw a half cup of flour into the broth, turned up the crock pot to high and let it simmer for abouut 10 minutes.  This produced with question the most delicious gravy I've ever had in my entire life.  In fact I used the rest of the gravy 2 nights later on a baked pork loin and it was delicious!  I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!  Thanks :)

Wow.  Who would have believed this could be so easy yet so good?  I subbed a cup of homemade beef broth for the water and gravy mix.  I didn't notice a lot of seasoning flavor from the meat but it was absolutely falling-apart tender.  Once the roast was done, I removed it to my KA stand mixer and used the paddle attachment to shred it, then returned it back to the slow cooker.  Served with club rolls, sliced provolone, mayo and horseradish - yum!

Great recipe.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star because I tweaked it a bit.  Seasoning I left as is.  I added mushrooms, carrots, bell pepper, onion and red potatoes.  The kids and hubby loved it.

Wow...I am not a cook by all means. I just decided to help out my wife and do something. I never cooked beef or used the slow cooker before. What a success the meal was. I actually made a full meal in the slow cooker. I put one half of onion and mushroom cut in big pieces on the bottom of the slow cooker. I then put a 2lb piece of roast over it. I then put 4 big potatoes cut in big pieces, then the other half of onion, mushrooms, and baby carrots. I then put the mixture over it and put on Low for 10 hours. For the mixture, I substituted water and brown mix for Beef broth. I did not salt anything, including meat. The mixture alone was enough and it came out to be perfect - not too salty and not blend. Will do it many more times in the future!

This was so good and easy! I didn't have a ranch packet so I covered and "tenderized" the roast in ranch dressing instead and added baby carrots and baby red potatoes.

Simple and tasty! The only thing I did differently was to add some veggies (potatoes, onions, carrots, celery, and corn this time).

This smelled great and the flavors were good, but it is way too salty.  If I were to try this recipe again, I would have to find a way to cut back on the sodium.

tried this recipe last weekend, and I had some reservations about the sodium content, it came out awesome. I added NO salt to it, and it was perfectly seasoned and the gravy was out of this world. I only made some very minor adjustment, such as adding quartered red potatoes and some diced baby carrot, also added some thick sliced Vidalia onion to the bottom of the crock pot for the meat to rest on. It was a hit with family and friends, and used the leftovers shredded on toasted rolls for sandwiches. All in all, a great quick recipe to use.

Great idea and sounded good. I used a turkey tenderloin. Way too salty. Probably won't try it again.

I make this all the time.  I omit most of the water, however.  I prefer a 1/4 cup separately, then sprinkle the seasoning mix over the top.  Divine!

This is a 20-year old recipe, but a keeper

Made this this weekend. Best tasting roast I have had in a long time. Only thing I did different was in the last 30 min. I added 2 Tbls of corn starch mixed with water and uped the temp to high until thickend. I don't think that I will ever fix a roast any other way.

This is probably the best roast I have made in a long, long time. I used a 4 lb. boneless chuck in the slow cooker on high for 4 hrs, and then turned it to low for about another hour. There is so much broth I can't believe it. I used a can of beef broth in place of water but I would say I must have eight cups of gravy. I will freeze the leftoever gravy for later. My husband asked where I bought the roast, it had so much flavor. Will definitely be making this again. I did add an onion but I don't think it would have made any difference. Yummo!!!

ok, I have been using all recipes for sometime and have  never written a review.  first, I must say , when I read a review of someone that changed the recipe before trying it 's original version should be banned.  the whole point is to try these recipes as they are and THEN if you feel the need to change it  to your liking, so be it.  but don't take  a recipe someone has worked on and make it your own without giving it a chance. that being said, I tried this recipe exactly as  written and I found it very  good. it's simple and quite tasty.  I  commend the person that came up with it, and hope more people on this site will try the recipes as they are first. then you can come up with your own.

I used 5lbs chuck roast and pan seared all sides before placing it in my crock pot. I then doubled the water, ranch, Italian, and used turkey gravy instead of brown gravy. Cooked it for 8 hours on low in my crock pot. It was delicious, tender, fell apart easily and was melt-in-your-mouth good!! I used the extra sauce as gravy for mashed potatoes. My friends and family loved it!

Excellent recipe, but it is missing a few pieces. Add salt, pepper, and some flour to the roast before adding to slow cooker and don't forget an onion! Half way through cooking add your potatoes and carrots.

The dressing and gravy packets are a staple in my house because i make this so often! I orignally found this recipe on Pinterest. It is my go to pot roast! So easy to make and comes out great! I cook it on low for 8 hours instead of 6 and it just falls apart, it's so good! I've made it both with and without carrots and potatos in the crock pot. Both are awesome!

The BEST pot roast. 2 tips....sear your roast in a smokin hot skillet on all sides first. Locks in juices and gives amazing flavor. Use 2 cups water.  Strain the fat off after and put the rest of the liquid in a sauce pan for gravy.  I mix 1 hefty tablespoon of corn starch and water until pourable, add to rolling liquid and cook until thick.  OMG! You will never make roast any other way.

I made this yesterday and my husband and I loved it. The only thing I did differently was to flour and brown the roast in vegetable oil before cooking in the crock pot. I have problems with MSG and should avoid it so I looked for the packets without it. McCormick products never have any MSG so I used those but they do not have Ranch Dressing Mix. I used Beefy Onion soup mix instead and it was wonderful. This will be my standard roast from now on.

I also have been making this roast for years (almost 20!) When I first saw this recipe, it did *not* sound like it would be good at all - but the cookbook I got it from promised it would be amazing, and it IS! A few words of advice, though - I've tried adding carrots to the crock pot, but I don't care for how it changes the flavor of the gravy, so I cook them separately if I make them. I usually make mashed potatoes, or potatoes quartered and cooked with the roast, though, to show off this gravy! Also, I've used both store brands & the brand name mixes, and the only thing I'd recommend is if you do use the cheaper brands, splurge to get the Hidden Valley Ranch brand dressing - that one really makes a difference if you use a cheaper brand. Lastly, you *can't* substitute already made dressings for any of the mixes - it does NOT come out tasting the same, so don't waste your money trying that. You won't like it, you'll be disappointed in this recipe, and will have wasted your money buying the other packets. (I speak from experience! lol I don't know why it doesn't work, but it doesn't.) You've GOT to try this at least *once*! You'll love it! :)

I MAKE THIS ALL THE TIME AND IT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST POT ROAST RECIPE OUT THERE. I SEASON AND SEAR MY MEAT BEFORE PUTTING IT IN THE CROCK POT . I USE BEEF BROTH OR STOCK INSTEAD OF WATER. ADD CARROTS AND ONIONS IN THE CROCKPOT AS WELL. WHEN IT IS DONE I ADD A CORN STARCH SLURRY TO THE CROCKPOT AND SHRED THE ROAST BACK IN WITH THE GRAVY. DELISH !!!!

Wonderful flavor, only change I made was to use beef broth in place of water and I seasoned my meat with garlic salt, onion powder and a touch of seasoning salt. I also added an onion to the bottom of the crockpot to sit the meat on. Hubbie loved it. Said it was even better the next day.

I wondered how the three packets were going to work together, but the combination is perfect, really.  I had to thicken the gravy but other than that I think the flavor is very good.  I used 3# of stew meat and did not change or add anything else.  I'll use this recipe again for flavor and convenience!

This was very easy and delicious! I added sliced onions and minced garlic to the bottom of the slow cooker for the roast to rest on. I browned the meat before adding it. I also added Worcestershire sauce to the water mixture for extra flavor. This made very good homemade gravy. Definitely a keeper!

I made the recipe as written.  My daughter made it as written.  What can I say?  We loved it.  Even her picky teen who adds hot sauce to everything liked it!  Made it again for guests.  They liked it too!  So I added this one to my file.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Easy and delicious. All I had was bone-in chuck roast, so next time will increase the cooking time by a couple of hours so it falls apart more.

This is THE  best roast EVER!  Since I have found this recipe, I have shared it with all my friends and we all agree....this is too simple and way too yummy to not make!   This has replaced the roast recipes we all previously had!  Great recipe Kerstin!  glad it got published!

I take the biggest onion I can find, slice into rings, and place it in the bottom of the crock pot, add meat and cover with the sauce for eight hours. I also pat the meat with flour to make the gravy a little thicker.  It is  a winter staple in my home and is the best pot roast I have ever tasted.

Absolutely love this recipe. Could not be easier. Definitely on my regular rotation. I make exactly per the recipe but do add baby carrots and Yukon gold potatoes and it's perfect every time. I thought it sounded odd with the 3 different packets of ingredients too, but the flavor is incredible. So easy to toss in the crockpot before leaving for work in the morning and the house smells amazing when I get home! Serve with some bread or rolls and you've got supper.

This was great! I added baby potatoes, carrots, onions and mushrooms. Served on top of large egg noodles. I used a boneless beef chuck arm/shoulder roast. The key to this recipe is a high quality piece of meat. Absolutely would make this again.....and it makes for great leftovers!

I always read reviews for advise on tweaking and changes based on others who have tried the dish. So what I did was based on others advice. I used the Ranch & Italian packs as a dry rub. Seared the roast in olive oil till brown on both sides. Then I mixed the brown gravy (I bought the low sodium brown gravy mix)in with a big 24 oz can of beer. The flavor of this roast was like none I have ever had before. This will be my go-to recipe now when I serve roast! It was amazing!

Friends happened to drop by and I got loads of compliments from the family and visitors.  Meat was not at all dry (without searing)!  The cost of the mix packets was worth the ease of preparation...I will look for bulk/sale season packets.  The broth made an excellent gravy but was extremely salty/rich, so beware of adding seasoning.  I made a double batch of mashed potatoes and used the leftover gravy and potatoes to make shephard's pie.

The recipe is very easy, but VERY bland.  Unless you like tasteless meat, you will have to add additional seasoning while it is cooking.

It is just my hubby and me and this meal was enough for 3 meals. All delish. I stuck to the menu except i did brown the roast in EVOO on both sidesprior to putting in the crock pot. I also used beef broth instead of water like some suggested. We ate the first meal with mashed taters and glazed carrots. The second meal was the next day for lunch on hamburger buns. It was even better the next day. I steamed a couple green peppers and put them on the buns with the shredded beef. Day 3 I used the shredded beef to make roast beef hash with fried onions and potatoes. Amazing yummy all 3 times. A keeper.

We loved this. The only change I made was to let the meat marinate overnight in the sauce only because I was going to be short on time @330 am. My 9yr old is taking the leftovers to school for lunch tomorrow.

This was great. I was worried at first that the roast would have too strong of a ranch flavor, but it was perfect. There was no overwhelming flavor they all just blended together for an overall delicious roast. I did not have any brown gravy, so I subbed a can of Au Jus I had in the pantry. My picky 5 year old that never eats roast cleaned his plate. This is a keeper for my family.

This was super delicious and way tender.  I couldn't get it out of the crock pot in one piece!  Wasn't sure about the 3-packet thing, but it works.  The only thing I did differently, was salt and pepper the beef, added a thin layer of flour and seared well in a skillet before adding to the crock.  Really terrific flavor.  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe.

Super Delicious!!!!! I browned the meat with a little seasoning salt and lots of pepper and put a little Worcestershire sauce and milk into the sauce and the meat turned out fork tender.  I also added red or Yukon gold potatoes with onions for the last hour.  I have tried this recipe again and this will definitely be a repeat recipe for meals to come!

This roast is good, but I was surprised that the dressings and gravy didn't give it a more distinctive flavor. Just a personal preference, but I will probably stay with the recipe that calls for cream of mushroom soup and dry Lipton Soup mix.

Made it exactly like the directions and it is fabulous!!  It makes the best gravy!!!!  I prefer mashed potatoes with this recipe instead of adding potatoes to the crock pot. Trust me, you want this gravy over mashed potatoes!!!

This was really good! I braised the roast first. Added sliced onions to bottom of the crockpot along with one celery stalk chopped in large pieces. After I braised the meat  I sauteed  fresh sliced mushrooms in the juices and added on top of meat and cooked on low for 8 hours.

I brushed the chuck roast with Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce and then seared it for about four minutes on each side before adding to the slow cooker. Instead of water, I added one cup of homemade beef broth. Due to excess salt content, I did not add the brown gravy mix. I cooked on low for six hours. The roast was so tender that it fell apart when I started slicing it. I froze most of the rich, aromatic drippings for future usage. This made some delicious beef sandwiches. Thank you, Kerstin for sharing your recipe. It is a keeper!

My sister-in-law made this and told me how the family absolutely loved it. I made it a few days later and everyone raved about it. Great flavor, tender meat, and best of all it was super easy. Plus you can add whatever veggies you want to it.I will make this my go-to recipe for roast from now on. Thanks for sharing!

I always use the cans of mushroom soup, cream of celery, etc.  This is way more flavorful.  I was surprised that with only 1 cup of water it produced so much sauce.

My husband said this was the best meal I've made!! Perfect for a Monday night dinner, delicious & ready to eat when you get home from work!!
Only 1 change... I would recommend substituting the brown gravy with au jus, for more of a Yankee-style pot roast. I think the flavor is superior. This method wins all 5 stars, in my book! Just make sure to add a bit more water, or some potatoes, as they will help to soak up some of the sodium. (It was just a bit salty). I added about 2 cups of baby carrots and 1 yellow onion.

Yummy!

This is a go-to recipe for me. I typically use a 4 pound roast. Before putting the roast in the crock pot, I season it (salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder), dredge it generously it in flour, and sear it on all sides in a hot pan with EVOO. I also use a can of low sodium beef broth instead of the water. I put cut onions and smashed garlic under the roast, and top the roast with 1 pound of baby carrots, 1 pound of button mushrooms, and one pound of potatoes cut into large chunks. If you don't have a crock pot, this can be done in the oven, 350 degrees for 3 1/2 hours. You need a large crock pot or Dutch oven for this recipe, at least 6 quarts. Either way, it is perfect every time!

I usually had 1/2 of each package because of it tasting too salty using the three packages.  love the flavor of this roast. This is the only recipe I use because I have flopped with all others.

Awesome recipe. Everyone loved it. I added onion and crushed garlic and the taste was wonderful. Whoever wrote about it smelling bad and it was "OK" must have had some really BAD meat/roast. I used chuck roast and added celery, potatoes and carrots later on and everything tasted great and smelled heavenly.

I always brown my roasts on all sides before placing into the crockpot. I would also recommend adding some potatoes and carrots to the crock to absorb some of the salt and increasing the water by another half cup.

I have made this and it turns out absolutely wonderful.  I don't know where the too salty, not enough salt, too bland, too awful to eat and all the negative comments and substitutions come from, but there is nothing negative about this.  There was one comment about saving money by using stew meat and that, anymore, is no way to save money since they have really upped the price of stew meat because they realize we like using stew meat (I now cut my own) and a very inexpensive roast will suffice just wonderfully.

I was hoping this would be great but I've never been a fan of gravy packets and this didn't improve my opinion. Family didn't care for the ranch either. I'll try some variations and see how they turn out.

Incredibly easy, very rich taste (even the grandkids loved it!), goes with any side (we had it over red potatoes). The most work was trimming the roast. Didn't change a thing and won't in the future. This is going on our family favorites list.

This recipe is AMAZING!  The only change I made is that I add 2 cups of water because it makes more gravy.  My family absolutely loves this recipe.  We have had it the traditional way with mashed potatoes and we have also had it on sandwiches, I have also made roast beef melts with it.  This is a staple in my home always!

I enjoyed this, it was the right combination of seasonings that weren't too zesty but I did use 1 1/2 cups of water rather than 1 cup. I added onions and baby carrots atop the roast. Cooked on low for 8 1/2 hours without thawing the meat before cooking which also offered additional water to the mix. Meat came out wonderfully tender with a great taste!

I made this today, and gave it four stars as written, but with the few changes I made it was definitely five stars!  First off, I used organic gravy and ranch mix packets, but could not find an organic Italian Dressing Mix. However, I found a recipe right here on AllRecipe's and made my own Italian Dressing Mix with organic spices.  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/italian-dressing-mix/detail.aspx
I also added potato wedges and carrots, and a bottle of dark beer!   This was sooooo tender and the flavors so good!  The roast I used had been in the deep freeze for quite a while, (it was the last piece of meat we had from a whole beef we had purchased), but it was still so tender it just fell apart! And so quick and easy!!!  I have never found a slow cooker recipe I liked as well as this one.  This will be how I make all my roasts from now on!!!

This sounds like a weird combo - but it works.  Very good!  I do not like using the chuck roast in the crock pot because of all of the fat.  I usually use a pot roast.  The gravy is awesome.

Made this for dinner last night and it went over REALLY well.  Between my husband and 7 yr old twins, they ate the whole 2lb roast! Next time, I am going to pull it and serve it in crusty rolls!  Glad I came upon this recipe - it is a keeper!

5 star recipe for preparation and taste. Took reviewers advice I added beef broth instead of water and added extra. Lightly seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder the roast and braised before adding to crock pot. Also, added 2 cloves of garlic. Never would have put those 3 packets together but, wow was it a great taste. Taste the gravy you make before adding the roast with half of the packages you can always add a little at a time till it's right for you. Braising the roast makes the gravy darker. Thanks for recipe.

I was intrigued by the recipe using 3 different gravy/dressing packets, all so different from the other.  The result was a wonderful tasting roast that worked great for mini roast beef sandwiches.  I made 'Soft-N-Fluffy Hamburger Buns' from AR to use with this sandwich.  The roast cooked up beautifully and sliced perfectly.  The next time I use this recipe, I will add potatoes, carrots and onions.  This is a great new way to prepare a roast.

This is by far the best slower cooker roast I have ever made! I used a 3-pound bottom round roast, as leaner than chuck. Did coat in flour & brown the meat first.  Also added a diced onion & several cloves of garlic.  Cooked for 8 hours on low.

SO easy! SO delicious! SO cheap! But I did what Cher73 did and made it 1/2 cup water with 1/2 cup Italian dressing. It only makes about enough to cover the roast alone so I made extra sauce in a separate pot with mushrooms, potatoes and carrots to add to it. It was PERFECT!!

Yummy, but a bit salty. Next time I'll choose between the ranch and the italian seasoning packet instead of putting both in. I used pork instead of beef, and it was still yummy. I can't wait for beef to go on sale so I can try this with the chuck roast.

Yum!  This was so easy to prepare and tasted fantastic when it was done.  I added a beef bullion cube as well as some cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce for a gravy.  I paired it with the Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes from this site.  I'm actually looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

I used 1/4 cup of Italian dressing and 1/4 cup of ranch dressing (no dry mixes) and a package of gravy mix - plus 1/2 cup of water. It took a full 8 hours to cook. The gravy was a little runny and greasy, but tasted great over the roast beef and a baked potato.

I just did this for Christmas this year and everyone LOVED it.  This is the easiest roast recipe I have come across.  I did alter it a bit because I did not have any beef broth on hand.  All I added was the Italian seasonings x2 and ranch x1 packet.  Seasoned the roast with salt, pepper and garlic.  The best and easiest.  I will be sticking with this one!

I've made this recipe several times.  I add the baby carrots and a lot of potatoes, as I like potatoes cooked with a roast.  The gravy is wonderful, and it is a quick easy, and VERY delicious recipe.    Everyone liked it, and everyone ate it, including the leftover hot beef sandwiches.   I really recommend trying it.

I  have been making a version of this for many years. Same ingredients except I only use 1/2 cup water as we found the full cup of water made the gravy too thin. I coat my beef with a seasoning rub the night before and leave it in the frig. I add baby carrots, quartered onions, and either regular potatoes cut into chunks or baby potatoes cut in half. I have also added green or red peppers the last half hour of cooking (so they don’t get too soggy). This. Is a very versatile recipe and next time I make it I will substitute beef broth as several reviewers have mentioned.

Don’t be hesitant to use this improbable combination of flavors!  Sounds  awful, but tastes great. Omit water & just sprinkle dry mixes over meat. You’ll have plenty of tasty gravy. We used to order a beef brisket from Texas to be sent to us in Virginia at a cost of almost $100. No more!  This is almost as good, a lot less expensive & sooooo simple to make.

Makes a fairly tough cut of meat taste very good!  Love the resulting "gravy".  We make vegetable beef soup with the leftovers.  Do NOT add any salt because the three packets have enough.

I love this!  I’ve made it several times now.  I usually use bottled Italian dressing instead of a packet and just add less water.  I also sometimes use homemade ranch dressing mix (from this site) because I don’t have the packet on hand.  Also. I play around with the veggies.  Frozen Brussels sprouts thrown in toward the end....yum.  Every time I have made this it had been a hit.

I love this recipe.  It's so easy.  I don't bother searing the roast.  I do lay it on a bed of sliced onions, combine the packets and water in a shaker, then pour it on top.  Cook it on low for 8 hours and dinner's ready when I get home from work.  I would like to try another reviewer's suggestion and do this with stew meat; add potatoes, carrots, onion, celery, and a large can of chopped tomatoes with juice. Mmm!

Was skeptical given the "almost homemade" use of the packaged ingredients but it was terrific!  Here are our changes to the recipe: 

Substituted 1 can Stout for the water; used a blender to blend all three packets (used name brands instead of store brands) with liquid before pouring over the roast.  Added one sectioned medium onion on top of the roast.  

Made gravy from approximately 2 cups of the cooking liquid added to a slurry of 1 tbsp cornstarch and 1/2 cup cooking liquid heated, then brought to a boil (plus garlic, parsley, and little red wine and pepper).

Will definitely make this again (and for company).

This is a hard one to rate if you take everything into consideration.   I first made this years ago  The taste is incredible.  Probably one of the best tasting roasts I've ever eaten if not the best.   And it is so easy it's almost not cooking.  For ease of preparation and taste, it's a 5+.

The reason I knocked off a star (and actually for this would knock off more if I could rate it separately), is that the liquid from this is so salty it is uneatable.  You can not throw in any vegetables to cook with it and expect to serve them with the roast.  You cannot make gravy from the liquid either.  That aspect is very frustrating.  All three packets are loaded of salt.  I am not sure why the meat does not get salty but it doesn't.  

Give it a try and I'm sure you'll love the taste, but you will need to plan sides to cook separately, including gravy if you want it.

I gave this 4 stars because I changed a few things. I had a 4lb. Prime chuck roast, rubbed it with olive oil fresh minced garlic and adbo seasoning with pepper and let it sit  for awhile. While I was searing in my 4in1 Ninja cooking system, I mixed the 3 packets and a cup and a half of water and 1 garlic clove  minced  to it. After searing I turn to the slowcooker on high and poured the mixture over the meat and cooked for 1 hour. Then cooked 4 1/2 hours on low. It came out very tender. Removed the meat. I mixed 1 1/2 TBS of Argo corn starch ( that is equal to 2 TBS of flour) added some water to it  slowly added it to the juices  turned it back to high brought it to a boil then turned off the cooker. I use corn starch because I never get lumps. Next time I make it I might you a packet of onion soup. We did really enjoy it, just would like to get a little more flavor.  Had it with mashed potatoes and put the gravy on  top also had string beans. Did not come out greasy or to salty.

I added one package of the Hidden Valley Ranch Greek Yogurt style, one Hidden Valley Ranch regular, a package of brown gravy mix  and one table spoon of Sriracha sauce.   Came out great!  The Sriracha sauce gave it a nice "little" bite.  If you don't like your food spicy I would back off on the Sriracha sauce.  I would not add any more than one table spoon unless you like your food "spicy hot".  I should mention I added a little bit of ground black pepper too.  I  also added some miniature mixed color potatoes that come in a sealed package and some cut up carrots.  I love pot roast and this was one of the best my wife and I have had.   The sauce is really yummy too!!  Guess what we are having tonight?  Left overs.  Yeah!!!!

Excellent! Gravy is awesome. I used low sodium brown gravy packet. I also make this in the slow cooker using chicken - substitute pot roast for 4 chicken breasts and substitute brown gravy pkt with low sodium chicken gravy pkt- add the Italian and ranch dressing pkts with water for about 4-5 hrs on high and serve w rice and veggies. The leftover chicken makes a great filling for chicken pot pie too!

Holy Moly, this has to be one of the best roast recipes I have ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth! My husband had the "great roast again" look on his face, once he tasted it he said, " give this one a ten out of five", that being said I read alot of the other reviews and was a little concerned about the saltiness and smell of the roast, smell means alot to me, can't eat it if it doesn't smell good, let me say, please, please try this as is, follow the recipe exactly!! I had thought the smell was offensive a couple of times during cooking, and started thinking, I don't know about this! Leave it alone! Let it cook, the end result is divine!

I thought this pot roast was AMAZING!! I actually had just about given up on trying to make a fall apart pot roast and this saved me!!  Seriously tastes like a restaurant's!!  I didn't sear it either, followed the recipe, except I did 2 cups of water.  Two HUGE thumbs up!!

Absolutely delicious. I am a huge fan of the cream of mushroom, onion soup recipe, however my husband has this mushroom problem (he thinks they should be banned from the earth). So now I've found an awesome recipe to please myself and my husband and anybody else who has a mushroom "allergy." Sending this on to my Mom so she can make it for her daughter-in-law and grand daughter. Thank you so much Kerstin for giving me a great alternative to the usual. Will definitely be making this again.

Something about the three packets mixed together just didn't make a good combo.

I have been using this exact recipe for several years.  For those of you who think it may be a little too salty for your taste, just put a quartered white potato in the crock pot along with the meat and it will absorb much of the salt.

I tried this recipe out on my family a few weeks before Christmas.  Got four thumbs up.  Made it for Christmas dinner this year and got rave reviews from everyone, especially for the delicious gravy that results from the cooking process.  When the meat is finished, I pull it out, strain the juices, add it back to the slow cooker and thicken with cornstarch and water.  I sliced the meat and put it back in the thickened gravy on warm for another half hour until I had everything else ready.  So tender and tasty.  Leftovers are even better!

I think this recipe is good enough for Christmas dinner, which is why I am making it right now.  I put lots of baby carrots on the bottom of the crock pot.  The resulting juice will make great gravy for mashed potatoes.  The house smells delicious right now.  I think this is better than prime rib, it's that good.

I was a little concerned to make this for guests when there were a few salty reviews - but I did anyway. I used 5-6 pounds of roast, one packet of ranch, one packet Italian , one packet of  beef gravy, half a can of beef broth and 2 cups of water. Cooked on low 8 hours or more.  Also put sliced onions in under the meat. It was delicious and easy to make - and received rave reviews from everyone.

Made this with mashed potatoes the other night for dinner...so easy and SO yummy, but there was a TON of it, since it's just hubby and me! So tonight I mixed half the leftover mashed potatoes and half the leftover roast beef (shredded, thanks to my food processor), wrapped the mixture in crescent rolls, and served with the leftover juices, heated of course (the recipe is in my profile). AND - thanks to our new Food Saver thingy, I vacuum-sealed the rest of the mixture to freeze and use later as hash! If you want to make the juices into gravy, Wondra flour works great and you can do it right in the crock pot!

This is so easy -- and delicious. You don't have to season the roast beforehand. I do sear it in a separate pot, just to seal in the juices. I use crock pot liners in my crock pot and clean up is a breeze. My family loves this roast. I thought it would be salty, but it's not. I tried it with a pork loin roast -- it was okay, but I think I prefer the beef roast better. Sometimes I add extra onions, just cuz I like onions. Towards the last two hours or so of cooking, I added some of those small red potatoes, like the kind you put in a crab or crawfish boil, and the whole meal was delicious. Try it -- you'll love it too.

I have made this several times I sometimes use water and sometimes beef broth.  Either way it is great.  I always shred it for sandwiches (either on hard rolls like Italian beef - or on bread with gravy like as hot roast beef sandwich) and every time I serve it I get raves.  This is a real keeper.

This receipe is fabulous.  The person who only gave it one star obviously did something wrong.  It does NOT smell bad,or she used an inferior cut of meat if it did.

We've made this over and over.  You have to be careful what type of brown gravy mix you use since some have so much salt it can overwhelm the roast.  I even use this as a stew base.  Simply chunk or cube your meat cook it for 6-7 hours, add your veg and allow it to cook another 45 minutes or so...YUM!!!!

I substituted beef stew meat for the roast. I added the stew ingredients, it was Excellent. I told a co-worker about the recipe, she substituted deer roast for beef roast. She said her family loved it.  Especially her 10 year told son.  He kept telling his mother, Oh Mom, this is so good.

This is a keeper.  I subbed beef broth for the water.  We always like to have extra gravy, so I doubled the broth and brown gravy mix but left everything else the same.  I added carrots to the bottom of the crock pot.  This roast and gravy had wonderful flavor and was a cinch to prepare.  Thanks for sharing, Kerstin!

This is as easy as it gets, and it is really delicious!  I brown my roast before I put it in the slow cooker.  If it's handy, I replace the water with beef broth, but it's just fine with the water.

This recipe was fantastic! I had to add another hour of high cooking because my roast was big and I added potato's and an onion, also I seasoned the meat with Tony's and I browned the meat on all sides before putting the roast into the crock pot. It had a wonderful flavor and my family plus the girls at work loved it! Won't be cooking my roasts any other way from now on!

Added the extra 1/2 cup water as recommended by others but had to make a "slurry" with flour and water to thicken the gravy.  The roast was tender but the kitchen had an odd smell from the seasoning packets. In fact, the gravy had a funky taste from the combination of spices and a bit af an aftertaste. Will stick with the Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast recipe from this site---much better.

I'm rating this 5 stars for flavor and ease but I have to admit that I used it as a base recipe to make beef stew. I cut a 2.5 lb chuck roast into cubes for stew and seared them in a Dutch oven with about 2 Tbl. olive oil. Then I removed the beef and added about 4 cups of chopped carrots, onion, celery, a couple cloves of garlic and a pound of quartered button mushrooms. I cooked that all in the beef drippings for about 10 minutes and then added the beef back in along with the packaged seasonings and 1 cup of water called for in the recipe and then enough more water to cover. I did sub onion soup mix for the gravy mix because I didn't have the gravy as a couple other reviewers suggested. I also added about 1/2 to 3/4 cups of burgundy wine. I simmered this for about 4 hours over low and then thickened the gravy with about 1/3 cup of flour mixed into 1/2 cup of water. We ate it with mashed potatoes but egg noodles or rice would also be great. I have to say this was the best tasting beef stew I have ever made and the flavor is amazing. The next time I make pot roast I will definitely be using this recipe for it also.

Recipe as written was good, made again and used broth instead of water and then after I used juice to make some yummy gravy (put in pan and boiled it adding flour to thicken). 

Tried this recipe for chicken...used chicken gravy instead of beef and chicken broth for liquid.

This was really, really good--and will definitely become a staple in our household. I added some potatoes (sliced into eighths), baby carrots, and an onion sliced into about six chunks. I used beef broth instead of water (and added half a cup, to make up for the extra things cooking with the meat). It didn't come out that salty at all, so I'll probably salt the meat next time. Also, the hubs spread a little gray poupon over everything on his plate, which I thought was weird--until I tried it. SO good.

Great crockpot roast. I used a 3lb bonelss chuck as suggested, but I made my own dry ranch dressing mix and I made Italian Dressing Mix from this site to use as well. A great way to control the sodium that otherwise consumes convinient packet products. I did use McCormick brown gravy mix packet. Wonderful smell in my house when I got home from work. Family loved this ....thanks!

The days that I'm off and my husband works I make a different recipe from this site. I never make the things he does because he's an excellent cook. I made this the other night, with very minor adjustments, I browned the beef after seasoning it with garlic, added onion & potatoes and used a beef boullion in the water, and he said it was the best thing I'd ever made!!! He wanted to know how I made it! It was awesome. Next time I'll add mushrooms too!

Absolutely my favorite POT ROAST recipe so far and I have tried several - this was very easy and delicious! we had to had some corn starch to the gravy to stiffen it up a little but it was fabulous! definately a repeater!

Great, simple recipe. Made just as directed, but added a bag of baby carrots to top of roast. Thickened gravy with cornstarch, served with mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again.

Excellent!  I didn't have gravy mix.  I heated the water and added a beef bouillon cube to it.  I put onions, carrots and red pepper at the bottom of the crock pot first.  It made a nice gravy.  Served it with brown rice.  Yummy

LOVE THIS RECIPE! Even my kids (2, 5, and 7) ask for this roast! I ended up stocking up on the packets because we have this roast almost weekly.   And if you take the drippings and make it into a gravy- be warned it will be salty.

I really liked this.  Its very easy and I was surprised by how good the sauce was in the pot after cooking all day.  I didn't have internet when the recipe needed to get started so I couldnt remember what to mix the three packets with, so I used beef broth.  I served with mashed potatoes.  This was a winner in my opinion.

I made this Saturday using the spicy ranch (all the store had) and it was delicious.  When you read the combination of mixes it's hard to envision the end result, but I will make chuck roast this way from now on. Added carrots & potatos the last 3-hrs to round out this meal. Thanks so much...just too easy and full of flavor.

This has become our favorite roast recipe. We add red potatoes, carrots, onion and garlic cloves.  We also pat the roast with flour and brown in a cast iron skillet before putting in the crockpot.  Excellent recipe!

I made this in my Tupperware Microwave pressure cooker and it was delicious ! !  The gravy flavor was out of this world ! !And so easy to do with one pot that I don't have to worry about. I can even marinate it in the fridge and just toss it in the microqave when I get home. Great recipe. can't wait to make it again

I've made this pot roast in the slow cooker several times and it never disappoints!  If I don't have the brown gravy packet, I'll use a mushroom gravy packet and it's just as good if not better.  I always add carrots, onion, potatoes and some celery.

I made this recipe as is and it was good, but we felt it was a little bland for our tastes so I did a half a cup of SUPER CHEAP red wine and a half a cup of water and it was just perfect. Also adding in red potatoes (cut into eighths so it soaks up all the flavor), baby carrots and a sliced onion at the 3 hour mark while cooking and it's just glorious. A perfect winter family meal. Some French bread for dipping and the fam loves is.

follow the recipe but use beer mixed with the packets just enough to cover the roast my sweet lord a masterpiece keeper from long time ago, use a little cornstarch mixed with a little water if you desire a thicker gravy but just remember BEER!!!

Tried this and was very satisfied with the results.  Used a three-pound chuck roast in my slow cooker.  Set the slow cooker on high and cooked for four hours.

The meat was tender but will use a cut of meat with a bit more fat content next time.

Also, the gravy was a bit too salty for my taste. Will play around with seasoning. I think low sodium brown gravy mix and ranch dressing mix will do the trick.

But overall, a great way to cook a roast. And the aroma! Wow!   This is a keeper.  The dry packet seasoning beats the premade liquid slow cooker mixes and is less expensive.

Loved it. The sauce was just right, not too thick. I added some carrots, baby potatoes, and onion. Meat was not 'fall off the fork' but that was probably my fault in the beef I used. Going to use the Three Packet 'gravy' with the Salisbury  Steak slow cooker recipe.

i've used this recipe a few times. my husband is a fan of this roast. i stuff my roast with garlic pieces (because we both like garlic) and season with salt and pepper, then sear on the stove before putting it in the crock pot. i always use crock pot liners -- makes clean up a breeze -- (hint: put about a 1/2 cup of water in the crock pot BEFORE putting the liner in -- makes clean up even easier, as the liner won't stick to the crock pot insert.) i also put quartered onions in the crock pot (and a few more pieces of garlic) before i put the roast in. i also add carrots and potatoes, about half way thru cooking time.

This came out very good. A little salty but not like others had said. I used 1 1/2 cups of water to make the gravy which may have helped cut it a little bit. I browned the meat first and put it on for 7 hours. I will definitely make it again and maybe cut some of the recipe packet amounts a bit to reduce the sodium.

Delicious! I cut everything in half because we had a 1 1/2 pound piece of meat. The only change I made was substituting lo-sodium beef broth for the water.

this is my go to when I have a busy day. only change I make is to double packets so there is plenty of delicious gravy for the mushrooms, onions and carrots that I add to the crockpot. I serve this with rice and it is always perfect.

Love this recipe.  Instead of water I use a can of spicy V8 juice and beef broth.  A trick my Grandma taught me.  I also added some veggies and served with mashed potatoes.  Always a crowd pleaser at my house.  So flavorful.

I made this once according to the directions and it was so tender you could cut it with a plastic fork and the gravy was awesome. Next time I added carrots, small red potatoes and a can of crushed tomatoes along with some quartered onion, medium white is what I used. 2 splashes of Worcestershire and let it go on low for 8 hours. Once everything but the juice is out of the crock pot you will have to thicken the juice but again did not disappoint.

My whole family loves this. I added baby carrots and chopped whole white onion. We had slow cook it eight hours.  In three hours it wasn’t even near done, but we had a big piece of meat. I thought I had done something wrong since it was hard and not done after 3 hours. After a phone call to my mom who suggested to wait 8 hours,  it was perfect!  The leftovers are the bomb.  Eat with Dave’s white bread and real butter.

Made it as written except since I didn’t have gravy mix. Insubstituted one cup beef bouillon for the gravy mix and water. Delish.....but next time I will thicken the gravy since using the bouillon made the gravy too thin.

Have made this several times, sometimes I add mushrooms or onions but the roast and gravy are very tasty without them as well   . I like to slice the roast and put it back into the slow cooker for  30 min to an hour before serving.

Tried to do the slow cooker route but ran out of time. I put the instant pot to pressure cook and it was done in an hour. Simple, tasty recipe!

As a person who never usually makes 'packet' type recipes, I can tell you this is spot on! The flavor of the broth is perfect. I added celery, mushroom and onion in the last 2 hours.

I actually made this in a pressure cooker because he slow cooker always seems to dry out the meat.  Came out great in the pressure cooker.  I would do it with a top round next time though.  The Chuck Roast has too many veins.  I'm even going to try it with a whole chicken and chicken gravy. YUM

So tasty! I chopped up an onion, carrots and potatoes and placed them on the bottom of my slow cooker and then the recipe as written and it turned out wonderfully. Next time I’ll omit the onion because it really didn’t need one. Making this one again, definitely.

I’ve made this many times, but I usually sub a less fatty roast for the chuck roast.  When it’s done, I shred it and leave it in the slow cooker for about 30 more min.  If it’s too watery (seldom the case), I add some cornstarch diluted in a little water, and it thickens right up.  Divine gravy..be sure to make plenty of mashed potatoes, rice, or noodles as a side dish!

This is one of my favorite meals! My mom made it several years ago and I've loved it ever since. I add baby carrots, cut up onion, and cut up potatoes a little bigger than bite size. It makes my kitchen smell SOOOO good! I cook mine for about 8 hrs. I'm telling no fib when I say it's so tender it falls apart trying to get it out of the crock pot!

I added 1 medium chopped onion and minced garlic. Instead of water, I used beef broth. I also seasoned the roast with salt-free Tony Charerie seasoning. Got rave comments on it.

I bought a package of two ~ 3-lb. beef roasts on special, and enough packets to do two roasts...so I'm already committed to making it again. Extremely simple. My variation is that I had leftover beef broth from another recipe, so I used that instead of water. I'm actually thinking I could make a great gravy out of the drippings in this case.

Made as written except added onion and used beef broth instead of packet of beef gravy.   Super easy and very good.  One reason this is such a great recipe for me is, it's easy to always have a packet of both the dressing s on hand...cause the won't go bad waiting to be used.

THIS ROAST IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY THE PERSON WHO POSTED IT DID NOT MENTION HOW REALLY, REALLY GOOD THE SAUCE IS. JUST TASTE IT WHEN ROAST IS DONE...FABULOUS. STRAIN IT AND ADD THE USUAL FLOWER AND COLD WATER SLURRY TO THICKEN IT AND YOU HAVE GOT THE BEST BEEF GRAVY YOU HAVE EVER TASTED.

I didn't have the gravy mix but did have a can of beef broth so I used just over a cup of broth, 1 packet Italian dressing mix and about 1/4 cup of ranch dressing because I didn't have the mix.  It was really great with good flavor. I should have served it with something like bread but was in too much of a hurry.   The meat was good but not awesome. I still would make it again.

I used chicken broth instead of beef and did not add any salt, just pepper.  I skipped the ranch dressing but added portabella mushrooms with the onion...and I also seared it in a skillet on both sides to hold in the juices before putting it in the slow cooker.  Everyone that tried it loved it!  If you want to slice it, take it out after about 6 hours.  The extra 2 hours makes it so tender and juicy it's difficult to cut. Yummy!

the only changes I made is the fact that I make my own Italian and Ranch seasonings so we don't get that added salt. The only salt came from the gravy packet. It was delicious!!

I am not really a fan of roast at all... until now!!! I followed the recipe as is, and mainly was trying it out for my boyfriend, as I had never cooked a roast before.  AMAZING!!!  I did toss a few carrots and small potatoes in there, but followed the rest exactly.  The flavor is spectacular!  Thank you so much for sharing this!  I now have my go to recipe for roast!!!

this was very good . I used stewing beef , the 3 packs , liquid + h2o from a can of mushrooms, and browned the beef. Added potatoes, mushrooms, baby carrots & celery. When I first tasted the liquid with the seasoning packs - I thought it was way too salty, but after it had cooked with the veggies , it tasted great - not too salty at all.
My husband just wants more.

Slow cookers really do an awesome job on beef pot roasts and pork roasts.   I'd kick up  the flavour on this one just a little by searing the roast in a hot pan first.  Deglaze the pan with a little red wine and add this to slow cooker.

Fantastic!  Made it many times exactly as written and it is always a hit with my family.  I have shared this recipe with many in my office and their families loved it too.  So easy and you put it together, turn the crockpot on and you are done.  Thanks for sharing!

I was unsure if the packet mixes would create an overwhelming taste. Definitely not the case. The meat was tender, full of flavor, and didn't get that dry texture that I've been trying to avoid.
I left out the flower and seared the meat instead. I used onions, carrots and mushrooms as well. I have four daughters, so I used a 3.6lb roast. This left us with some leftovers, but not overkill.

This was definitely a hit and the kids inhaled it. Even my picky pigeon left little on the plate.

I did exactly as recipe called for ingredient-wise, also adding mushrooms, carrot sticks, celery, & 2 medium sized Russet Potatoes (quartered).  I cooked on High 6 hours, then on Low for 2 more hours.  It turned out AMAZING!  I will definitely be making this again!!

Great simple recipe for busy days. I always braise the meat first, and use a cup of red wine instead of water. Add some carrots, potatoes, and onions too. Only roast I can get my picky husband to eat!

We loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it on low for 7 hours.  My husband walked in the front door and enthusiastically asked what smelled so good.  The reviewer who said it smelled so bad she couldn't eat it must have used  spoiled meat.  I served it over leftover basmati rice and will definitely make it again.

This  pot roast recipe was the best and easiest I've made in a long time, and smelled so good cooking, it was difficult to wait the 6 hours for it to be done, (which gave me a chuckle remembering what another had said about how bad it smelled while cooking).  I added no seasoning,  and didn't brown the meat, which I've always done in the past;  I made it EXACTLY as it was written, and wouldn't change a thing.  The gravy was delicious served over mashed potatoes.  This is a definite "keeper", and will be made many more times.

I made this using all the listed ingredients but I mixed with beef broth (50% less sodium, 14 oz. can) instead of water with a 4 lb. chuck roast. Served over egg noodles. Put a couple of carrots on top about an hour and a half before finished cooking. Cook time on low was 7.5 hours. This recipe is definitely in our meal rotation now! It was delicious! Absolutely. Delicious!

Wow, what a great pot roast!! Nice, beefy flavor, it creates an out of this world gravy too. I slightly tweaked the recipe, I added two onions underneath the roast, and browned the roast before slow cooking it for 6 hours. Then I added mushrooms, potatoes and carrots and cooked it for another 2.5 hours. The meat was nice and stringy and the veggies soaked up some of that delicious gravy. Will definitely be making this again, and again!

I've made pot roast before but this is by far the most flavorful one ever. I added potatoes and carrots and placed meat on top. When finished I put gravy in a pot and added a cup of water with flour  in it and cooked, stirring until thickened. This is now my staple recipe for pot roast.

A keeper! Only changes were browning roast for 2 minutes on each side before cooking, and adding a layer of chopped onion on the bottom of the crockpot before adding roast. Made sauce as directed, added cornstarch & water for a most delicious gravy!

Love this recipe; so easy, so good.  I've made it several times and change up the liquid--white wine, red wine, or broth.  All are yummy!  I use this recipe with beef and venison, great every time!

We tried the recipe and we loved it.  The brown gravy packet we used made the juice a little too salty.  The next time we made it, we switched the regular brown gravy with a low-sodium brown gravy.  It tasted better without the extra salty taste.  I have recommended the recipe to others.

My family has been making this for a couple of years  now and it never disappoints!!!'  Only we run down the roast with olive oil and then rub the dry seasonings mixed together all over the roast.  Then add water to the crock pot.  Also to make even more tender we slice the roast into slices about 3 hours before we eat it and place the slices back into the crock pot to continue to cook

Hands down this is the best recipe to follow for slow cooker roast! I made no changes to the roast recipe.! Decided to place sautéed peppers, mushrooms & onions  on top just to add color. Was a big hit with my family! No more stringy, dried pot roast!

I tried the recipe as is but my family found it too salty.  I substituted onion soup mix for the ranch dressing mix and they liked it much better.  Also if you sear your roast first this recipe will cook in a Dutch oven in 2-3 hours (@ 350 degrees).

How could this smell bad?!  Unless your meat was bad it is sublime every time for me.

I've made this no fail several times.  I choose 2 cups of water to mix all dry ingredients.   I brown my 3lb chuck roast in bacon grease (Saturday breakfast folks)   I  add 2-14oz cans of stewed tomatoes, and dress the top of the roast with strips of fresh jalepeno peppers.   I choose to roast any vegetables of preference to go with.

I have been cooking this for years got it off  this site. I always add one or two sliced onions on the bottom of the crock to add  flavour to gravy.  Flavour is not a spelling error that's the way  we spell it in Canada.

This was a waste of a good roast!!  Don't know if it was the ranch or Italian dressing that caused it, but there was a sour taste to this.   I took a couple bites and had to quit, I couldn't eat it.  Thank goodness I made mashed potatoes and a  vegetable side dish separately, rather than adding vegetables to the crockpot with the roast, so we had something to eat!  husband, who will eat anything, finished what he put on his plate, but the rest of the roast and gravy was fed  to the barn cats.

One of my Daughters makes this and it is AWESOME!!! I actually cooked mine in one of those fast cooking pressure cookers that were so popular last year. It took about 3 hours instead of 8 hours...I've tasted this recipe both ways and I honestly could not taste the difference!!! So if you forget to thaw the roast, use the pressure cooker and it will still be GREAT!!!

This was awesome, very flavorful and super tender.   I did brown the roast before putting it into the crockpot. And, like others, I added potatoes, carrots and onions.  After cooking was done, I thickened sauce with cornstarch, although not sure this was really necessary.  My 5 year olds loved it as did my husband. Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

I just got it in the Crock-Pot...the only changes I made was to add carrots and onion and because my roast is over 5 pounds I added an extra brown gravy packet and another half a cup of water. I tasted the mixture before putting it on the roast and I could taste the salt so I did not add salt just pepper. I also took another reviewers suggestion and cut off most of the fat from my roast before putting it in the crock pot. I will post another review when it's done.

Loved it! I added quartered potatoes, baby carrots , sliced baby bella mushrooms and a bag of pearl onions and my wife and I enjoyed it  3 times this week with fresh pillsbury rolls from the oven. Very easy and tasty, with plenty of sauce for the roast, even with all of those veggies.

Made this for Sunday dinner, but I didn't have a packet of brown gravy mix. What I did have on hand though, was a packet of beef stew seasoning. So I used that instead and I have to say, this roast came out so fall apart tender and so full of flavor! I was worried it would be too salty, but it wasn't at all..It was perfect! Today, I'm making an au jus Sauce and We're using leftovers today for beef sandwich dips! Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this a few times and it always turns out perfect.  Not much to add. Like others I brown the roast in a large frying pan and then pour in a bottle/can of beer  (this time I used a Corona Extra) and deglaze the pan whisking in the 3 seasonings, then pour over top of everything.  When done I strain the liquid and make a gravy in a separate pan with flour/water.  This recipe actually tastes better the next day (if you can wait that long). Highly recommended.

I doubled the recipe using a 6lb roast for weekly family dinner.  It was perfect and everyone declared it yummy!  I did add carrots and celery under the roast.  I served it with the veggies and my version of roasted Greek potatoes (honey gold little potatoes cut in half,  seasoned with olive oil and Cavender's Greek seasoning.)

I have never reviewed this but have made it many, many times; it's just sooo good. Yes, it's a bit salty and to cut the salt I add an extra cup of water plus 1/2 cup of dry red wine. For additional depth of flavor I add 1 teaspoon of dried ground wild mushroom. I have my crockpot simmering with this mouth watering mix right now. When it's fork tender I will remove the beef from the crockpot and shred it. I will drain the broth (and save to add to my soup stock); I will then return the shredded beef to the crock pot and add a generous amount of my favorite homemade BBQ sauce and heat to serving temperature. I serve this glorious BBQ beef on homemade beer rolls (recipe for No Knead Beer Bread on this site) which I am also making today.

This was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I followed some of the reviews and used beef broth instead of water, and threw in some quartered potatoes and carrots, and a full sliced onion.  It was a full meal ready with very little work on my part!

Based on the reviews...I made this for the first time today!  I will ALWAYS  make a roast this way from here on out!  I made it the exact way the recipe called for!  I did , however, take the meat out and covered it after it was done. Then I turned the crockpot up to high and added 3 TBS of cornstarch to thicken the gravy for about 15 minutes and then placed the meat back in the crockpot on keep warm so the gravy could thicken!  It was so easy and delicious!  I served mashed potatoes and a veggie with it!  Next time I will add some veggies with the roast!  This is a KEEPER for sure!

Definitely different from  my usual roast made with onion soup mix. Was a little Leary at first, but wanted  something different so I gave it a try and really was good. Added potatoes and carrots served with homemade bread and it was a winner!

Made this 2 nights in a row, my fam loved it so much. Soo easy & delish!  Used a can of beef broth to whisk & mix seasonings and added a can of water to compensate for all the salt of those seasonin packets. Love it!

good mix in flavor. I make this with the same amount of packets but more beef, yum! sometimes adding onions, garlic, mushrooms, or potatoes makes more of a meal out of it, delicious!

I made this yesterday (December 2016) and it came out really good. I browned all sides of the meat first and set it on a bed of sliced onions when it went into the slow cooker. it did NOT taste too salty at all, and i do not cook with salt. My husband puts salt on everything and this was good enough for him not to add any more. I also used low sodium gravy mix and vegetable broth instead of water because that is what was on hand. nothing smelled bad and again, it tasted good.

Excellent! I used zesty Italian dressing packet since that's what I had on hand. The gravy has great flavor. I was worried after reading some of the comments about the sodium as we don't use much extra salt on anything, but it was fine. Took me just a few minutes to throw it together before work. Got home 10 hours later and the meat just fell apart. Will definitely be making  this again!

It was just OK.  Probably a little too salty with the Italian and Ranch Mix.  I would probably leave one packet out and add more liquid next time.

Very Good!  I always make the recipe exactly as written to review it,  otherwise you are not rating the exact recipe.   
Was delicious. Makes a nice gravy too.  Just thicken it a bit I you need to.  I served over noodles. Yum!

I made this as directed,  no changes at all. My roast was 2-1/2 lbs. and I cooked it 8 hours on low. It was very tender and flavorful.  I might try this in the future using dried herbs instead of the Ranch and Italian dressing mixes, hoping to lessen the sodium content.  I will add the gravy mix packet as I feel it added to the overall yummy flavor

This had nice flavor and would be really good as thick end gravy over mashed potatoes.  I loved how easy it was to throw together!  Update: made this a second time and used mushroom gravy and added portobello mushrooms.  When it got done cooking I thickened up the gravy and served over mashed potatoes.  It was excellent!  Everyone in the house loves it!

Wow! I'll never make roast another way. No more onion soup packets or braising first. Someone told be about this recipe idea so I decided to look it up on my favorite recipe site, Allrecipes, and found this one. It literally took me under five minutes to assemble, if that, and it came out amazing.  Although I added seasoning, beef broth and onion, it still deserves FIVE STARS because it would have been just as tender and tasty without the additions. Because it's roast, I threw in potatoes and carrots to complete the meal.  When it was done, I scooped out the veggies and meat which left the most wonderful gravy! Oh ya, I did double the gravy portion of the recipe just because you can never have too much gravy.  Simply, simple, and a foolproof recipe. YUMMY!

Absolutely delicious and I don't even eat beef. My husband adores this roast, and he always has sandwiches from the leftovers if there are any. It does stink when you first start cooking it, but the end result is scrumptious.

Have made this many times, I've found it's best with a large bag of baby carrots added, then making mashed potatoes & using the liquid from the crock pot as the gravy.

So fabulous. Made several times and will only make it this way.
When I go to the store I usually purchase several packets of each to make sure all are on hand but even when I don't I have replaced with liquid version and adjusting  any additional liquid.  Adjustments I make are using beef , chicken or vegetable broth instead of water, various vegetables (onions, potatoes and carrots) and sometimes I sear  the roast but not always and each are equally delicious.
So tender and flavorful. Seasoning packets are the only seasonings you need

This recipe is fantastic and easy.  I read the reviews and took advantage of some recommendations in order to save a trip to the store.  I agree with browning the roast before slow cooker.  I also didn't have dry Italian so used half bottle of liquid Italian dressing and cut back a bit on water. I also took off fat from the top, after cooking.  It's hard to mess this recipe up. We like the flavor of a bay leaf so I added one. It is very flexible, so add your touch, but this will always be my "go to" for pot roast.  It is #1.

This was a huge hit at my house! I did add veggies to make it a meal and a little extra water and it turned out great! Made excellent gravy too. Had 3 very happy, full guests for dinner. On my favorites list now.

This is the best pot roast! I only use ranch dressing   packet and the brown gravy packet. I rub them on dry, the water clinging to the roast is plenty of liquid. (If I am doing a small roast, I use one half packet of each)  Delicious!

This is very tasty.  I made it in my pressure cooker. The only complaint I have is it is a bit on the salty side. I will  have to play around with the ingredients to figure out how to make it less salty.

I can't imagine anyone thinking this smells bad. I've made the recipe at least  a dozen times or more. But, this is the first time my youngest grandson has tried it since he's away at school. He loved it, as have the other family members. Mashed potatoes for that lovely grav and a nice green salad round out the meal for us. Yum!

I don't understand the reviewer who didn't like the smell every time I make it, the house smells wonderful, like When my grandma made pot roast. I brown the meat, carrots and onions, before putting them in the slow cooker. The only concern I have is it can be a bit too salty, so definitely do not salt the meet before you brown it. I use lower sodium aujuis or brown gravy mix. And half a packet of good Italian dressing mix. This recipe works well in a slow 275 degree oven for about 4 hours, also. My husband loves this meal!

Very good.  Added one very large sweet onion quartered and red potatoes quartered.  Could use little less water maybe 3/4:cup.  Cooked on high 4 hours for 3 pounds.

My kitchen smelled delicious while this was in the slow cooker. I thought it was too salty, but, I've been reducing my salt intake for a decade, so it's very noticeable to me. I will make  this again. Have already purchased 3 more packets, this time paying attention to salt content. My grocery store didn't offer any low sodium packets. Suppose I'll see if available through Amazon.

I made changes based on other reviews which I always consult, and the use of my own previous crock-pot beef recipe.  This is what I used:    About 3lb Chuck roast trimmed of as much fat as possible, with a package of brown gravy mix and a package of onion soup mix, mixed with a cup of water poured over the beef. This was cooked until fork tender almost 6 hours on low.  Friends and husband have declared this the best they've had and very tender.  Easy to make and results in lots of gravy.   We served over cubed potatoes and baby carrots cooked separately.  Thanks for the recipe and the reviews.

I've made this several times though I also add a can of cream of mushroom with a half a can of water  whisked together with the packets. I put potatoes and carrots on the bottom of the crock pot and around the roast then cover it all with whisked mixture. Delicious!! It's delicious made as the recipe states but adding the COM gives a thicker gravy.

AMAZING!!!!! I'll never make roast any other way! This is melt in your mouth delicious! The only changes I made was to add baby carrots & diced sweet onion. I've made this with beef roast & venison roast, the flavor & tenderness is perfect l!

This is by far the best Pot Roast I ever made. The only change that I made was  instead of the 1 cup of water I used 1 cup of beef stock. Yummy and so easy to make. Up dated I add spices to the roast and brown it before putting it in the crock pot plus I add 1 chop onion to the bottom of the crock pot and I mixed all 3 packets with 2 cups of beef stock and use that to scrap the bottom of the pot that I cooked the meat it to get all of the bits of spices off the bottom of the pot. Than I  poured all the liquid over the roast  and cooked on low until done...YUMMY

I've been making this for years.  Sometimes I add potatoes and carrots but not always.  Makes great gravy.  Hubby loves it.  Never have left overs for very long and there is just the two of us.  I also braise the roast if I have time but not always.  Just a great recipe.

This was so easy and so good. I didn't change a thing. The entire family loved it. My family isn't fond of leftovers but they didn't complain about having this for a second or third time.

This was super easy to make and my family loved it. I will make it again but I will adopt some of the recommendations to lower the salt flavor of the gravy.

I've been making this one for over a decade! In the fall and winter, it's a once a month must have. It's just the two of us so it makes quite a lot of leftovers, or as I call them, planovers. The only change I make is to opt for lower sodium whenever possible. Uneaten leftovers go in the freezer. When I have enough saved up, I put it all in a big soup pot with low salt beef broth, your fav soup veggies, and 1 cup of barley. Simmer until veggies and barley are tender and serve with salad and hunks of torn crusty bread. So good!!

Best roast beef I've ever made! I substituted beef broth for the water and it came out so tender and flavorful. The gravy was excellent. Will be my go to recipe from now on. I bought a store brand beef gravy mix and the recipe was also on the back of the pkg as well.

This recipe made a tender roast that is super flavorful.  My tweaks include searing the roast before placing on top of thick onion slices in the crockpot, and used chicken broth instead of water.  I set crockpot on low for 4 hours.  Roast is so tender it fell apart when taking it out of the crockpot.....simple to make and delicious!  My kind of meal!   I will make this again!

This is the absolute best roast I've ever made!! Made it exactly as instructed, though cooked on high for about 4 hours instead since I didn't start it early enough. It came out great! My family raved about it, said they felt like they were eating in a restaurant it was so good, and they were still complimenting me on it the next day. Huge hit in my house, and ill be using this recipe exclusively from now on. It's the best!

I loved this recipe, the meat was fall apart, moist and had good flavour. I didnt have a packet of thousand island dressing, so i just used some thousand island dressing, about 3 tbsps. Will definately make again.

I love pot roast and this one was great. Tender and moist.  The gravy that it made on its own was very good too.
I added 5 small potatoes cut in half and a 1lb. bag of small peeled carrots making it into complete meal.

The whole family loved this recipe! I substituted Ms. Dash's pot roast seasoning for the beef gravy packet because I thought it would be too salty. The Ms. Dash gave it a nice spicy zing. I added onion, carrots and potatoes. Will make it again!

My husband forgot the brown gravy packet.  I used the powdered beef stew packet I had on hand.  It worked just as well as the brown gravy packet.  I added red onion and carrots.  So good.  This is actually the second time I have had it.  My husband made it the first time.

I have been making this for years with a couple differences. No Italian dressing, use packet of dry au jus, packet of creamy ranch, a handful of peperoncinis' and a stick of unsalted butter. cook on high for 1 hr then low for 8.  So delicious.

Love this recipe - it's a go-to in my house. The only change I made was to use low-sodium gravy mix. I also add a little cornstarch to the gravy to thicken it up a bit.

Tossed onion and celery in the bottom of the pot at the beginning.  Also added baby carrots towards the end.  Served over mashed potatoes and my family loved it.  15 year old had it as an after school snack the next day--must have been a winner!

If you have never tried this you must, it is absolutely fabulous.  The only time I e ever altered it was when I forgot the ranch packet, so I used regular ranch dressing halved with the water it calls for and it was still great.

This is EXCELLENT! I did make some changes because of what I had on hand. I had rubbed my roast with McCormick Backyard BBQ before I froze it so that was on it.  I used a packet of Au Jus instead of beef gravy and beer instead of water.  I added a large onion, sliced and baby carrots. I cooked it in my Ninja on high for 2 hours and low for 6 hours. When it was done I added a corn starch slurry to thicken up the gravy and  I served it over egg noodles.  The flavor was AMAZING and meat so tender. It is my best roast ever!!! It tasted even better the next day and still better the third!

Delicious! HIGHLY recommended!  My husband and brother loved this roast and it couldn't be any easier.  Really!  My brother said that he's had many roasts, but that none had the flavor of this one.  I'm not usually a "big piece of beef" person, but I liked this with the first bite.  I used 2 roasts that totaled 3.4 pounds and the original recipe.  I put one in the bottom of the crock pot, poured over some of the sauce, stacked the 2nd one on top and added the rest of the sauce. Cooked it on low for 5 hours and high for the last hour.  (Was afraid it wouldn't be done for dinner.)  Finding out that I am a "beef person," I can't wait to make this again.

I was looking for a easy tasty main dish for a holiday party and this exceeded all my expectations. All the guests LOVED it and thought it was way more work than it was. I served it with mashed potatoes and the gravy over it was amazing!! This is THE best crockpot roast recipe you will find. I followed the recipe exactly, it doesn't need any changes. Perfect recipe especially for the fall/winter comfort months

Easiest and yummiest recipe! My whole family LOVES it and we never ever have leftovers. Even my picky eater who eats cereal 90% of the time loves this.  I add a chopped onion and a bag of mini carrots to the crock pot and make mashed potatoes to go along with it.  I find it is best after the full 8hrs.

Really enjoyed this pot roast.  I seared the roast first in a pot with 1 tbls. veg. oil.  Added carrots, potatoes, onion, mushrooms, dry ranch packet, dry Italian seasoning packet and one cup of red wine to the slow cooker.  I also substituted the gravy for 2 cups of beef broth.  This recipe is a great starting point to make to your own taste!

This recipe appealed to me because there was no measuring (aside from the water) required. I thought it might be something my husband or kids could throw in the crockpot for me. My roast was a little bigger than called for at 4.88 lbs so that may have affected the flavor, or lack thereof. The roast was tender, the carrots were cooked, the juices had a nice color and were plentiful for making gravy but the whole thing was bland. I can't say it was salty even though I know there had to have been more than enough. I can't say it was peppery. There just wasn't any identifiable flavor to it. The meal was edible and with the roast being neutral in flavor it could provide lots of options for leftovers. I don'think I'll use this again. Oh, and the cost of the packets combined made this a little cashy when you figure there was no real flavor added.

This is the best and easiest slow cooker roast recipe I've ever had! My husband and kids aren't usually crazy about roast but they loved this recipe. I made mash potatoes along with it and they ate every bit! Will definitely be a regular meal around by house.

I like the recipe and can see how well it would work "as is;" that said, I did alter it some.  Because I wanted to add vegetables but was afraid the water called for wouldn't be enough, I also added a can of French onion soup.  In addition and since I put bay leaf in so many things, that went in too.  I liked it enough to do it all again.

I've always been happy with a water broth but my husband hates it. He said I can make this anytime. That's saying a lot as he is a catering chef by trade. I took the risk of adding baby carrots and onions to the crockpot and it worked out deliciously. Thank you!

I cook this on a regular basis.  I put a few squirts of Worcestershire sauce in the one cup of water the recipe asks for.  I also put the roast on a bed of vegetables (potatoes, onion, carrots and celery) and around the roast as well.  I like a little kick so I add some black pepper too.  That's it.  It comes out sooo good!!

It was just OK. Nothing to brag about. Didn't really have a great flavor. Meat was tender, but the flavor was 'off'. I had to add some red wine vinegar to add any interest. Would not make again, but didn't throw it out either.

I doubled the water after reading other reviews (and also because the slow cooker appeared to need more liquid). It was yummy. Three simple packets that I usually have on hand meld nicely together for a flavorful gravy. It's definitely a keeper.

Could have been good if I didn't use a pork roast. We couldn't even eat it. I am an inexperienced cook, so failing on this meal wasn't a surprise.

we did not care for the taste with the italian dressing .So next time i made it we omited it and did 2 brown gravy one ranch.They did not care to much for that either.So now i use 3 packets of brown gravy only .Thats a winner.

This is my go to recipe when making roast. If I have some chicken stock, I use that instead of water but even with the water, it tastes GREAT!

I like how easy this is to prepare in the morning before heading out the door. I followed the recipe as written. The Italian dressing packet that I buy is 42 grams which is actually 1.4 ounces so use only 1/2 a packet. The ranch dressing is 28 grams which is 1 ounce so I can use 1 whole packet. Thanks for sharing such a good and easy recipe.

This is a keeper!
Used 2 clod roasts (chuck but less fat veining) totaling 3 lbs and I got a late start so cooked on high for 6 hours.  Also threw in 6 quartered red potatoes at the start.  Perfect

SO MUCH MSG!!!   My mother made this over the weekend when I brought my wife and kids over to her house for dinner.  It was tasty but when I heard the recipe I immediately realized that we had taken in a whole lot of monosodium glutamate, which is one of the main ingredients in each of those three packets.  If you're sensitive to MSG, don't use this recipe.  Even if you're not, drink a whole lot of water.

The only thing I did different is add a can of beef Broth and used red skinned potatoes, carrots and celery like a stew. Everyone loves it and it's very simple.

This is incedible! so easy, takes just minutes before you leave in the morning (i do add a sliced onion on the bottom) and come home to the best roast beef i have ever had. i have tried dozens of slow cooker roast recipes before and this will be the last. 
Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe but just added onions to the bottom of the crock pot and used beef stock in place of the brown gravy mix and added 2 cups of water to it for extra gravy. My husband said by far the best roast I have ever made!!! Definitely a keeper.

My family LOVES this! If I am out of one of the packets listed....I use what I have. Today I am using 2 small packs of Italian Seasoning (in lieu of ranch), PORK gravy mix, and Onion soup mix. Yummy and so easy for busy moms!!!

This was amazing! I had a six pound bottom round roast, I marinated it overnight, and I was a bit worried the flavor of the marinade would mess up the end result, but it was absolutely delicious. I doubled everything, due to the size of the roast. The leftovers were even better the next day, warmed up in the oven in foil packets. The kids went nuts over it. I will make this again. No changes. Awesome as is.

I had a huge roast and we have long since given up on feeding our bodies poison. So my classic go-to cream of mushroom/onion soup mix roast was out. I found some organic packets of italian dressing and gravy and used those. I couldn't find a ranch packet I felt good about and couldn't make some in a pinch so I left it out. 
I doubled the other packets and the water (we love gravy) and added 2 large quartered onions, a bunch of quartered potatoes, and baby carrots to absorb some of the flavor. Great flavor and super easy, my new roast recipe. Thanks!

This recipe was soooo good when I made it last time with some round steaks (I couldn't think what to do with them because they're kind of tough so I found this recipe and decided to use it). I didn't have brown gravy mix when I made it so what I did was mix about 1/8 cup of flour with a bouillon cube (I used chicken but I'll use beef next time...didn't have beef bouillon at the time...I think I'll also add an extra 1/2 tsp of bouillon) ground up, a dash of garlic powder, and a healthy teaspoon of ground black pepper. I am going to use the same method next time I prepare it with an actual roast. I also added potatoes and they turned out delicious. We ate the shredded meat on some steamed jasmine rice. I'm making this with the roast tomorrow and I can't wait to see how it turns out! Thanks for sharing!

Very good!! I did a couple things differently. I used onion soup mix and I added Worcestershire and liquid smoke. Didn't have brown gravy mix so I made my own corn starch mixture. Also added mushrooms.... So good!!

, made this recipe last night with garlic mashed potatoes  the only thing that I added to the mix was an extra packet of brown gravy and an extra cup of water because I wasn't sure if it was going to be enough I did sear the meat first three minutes each side this was amazing it was the best meal even my boxer thought so because when I left it on the table too cool I heard a great big crash and there went my leftovers all over the floor happy dog not a happy mom

Absolutely delicious. I tweaked the recipe just a tad. Although it doesn't call for it, I applied my favorite meat rub before cooking. Also, at about the 6 hour mark, I added a can of sliced carrots and a can of sliced new potatoes (both drained) and a little more Konriko seasoning (I prefer it to Tony's because it has less salt) and let it go another hour. WOW! Leave the knives in the drawer. You'll have no use for them at all!

I made this with a venison roast and served it over white rice.  It was delicious.  I did add an onion to the slow cooker, tho.   Definitely a keeper recipe!! And so, so simple. I put it in at 6am before work, came home at 4 and dinner was ready!!

I made this recipe for dinner and my daughter and I fell in love with it.  I was doubtful about the Italian salad dressing, but the three packets of seasonings were just right for the meat.  I browned the meat prior to putting it in the slow cooker and added one onion to the pot.  Other than that, I followed the instructions exactly.  This will be a regular item in our house from now on.  Absolutely delicious and I encourage other readers to try it.

Easy to prepare and my family loves it every time.  I also love that if there are any leftovers they reheat so well.  I understand that people gave this a bad review based on the sodium content but my review is for taste and ease of prep.

I love this recipe. Saw it on Facebook first. I use 2 cups of water and I brown the roast on either side first. My daughter is not a big beef eater and loves this. She calls it yummy beef. Delicious and so easy to make

Love this recipe.  I do braise the meat first and I add more water and about 3/4 of the packets of Italian and Ranch so it is slightly less salty. I like to add more water for plenty of gravy to cook potatoes in. Chop some up and throw them in a few hours before you are ready to eat. They have an awesome flavor! The recipe as is is great I just prefer less seasoning for myself.

Made this with 3lb roast. Took 7 hours in the crock pot and worth every minute.  Put potatoes in the last 2 hours. Quick, easy,  tender and juicy!

I made this for my father who HATES pot roast. He now request I make it every time he comes over. Great recipe. Like others I add sliced onion, small potatoes, and baby carrots to mine. Perfect roast every time.

My friends and family love this recipe. I added potatoes and a large onion. Canned, drained carrots about two hours before serving. I also browned the meat before putting in crockpot. Cannot believe someone would not like this recipe. My house smelled sooooo good when I came home from church.  My guest loved this and went back for seconds.

My son made this. He substituted beer for the water, put sliced onions on the bottom and floured the meat. It was the most delicious pot roast I've ever eaten served over mashed potatoes. I'm going to try it and add carrots and celery.

Delicious and extremely easy! I use low-sodium versions of the seasoning packets and it tastes just as good while cutting the salt in half. I also bring the beef up to room temp. and then sear it in a frying pan on the stove (roughly 90 seconds each side, make sure pan is as hot as possible) before slow cooking it. Pull off the drippings and mix with wondra in a saucepan over medium heat for wonderful gravy.

This was the best roast I have ever made. I started cooking it in the morning before work and left it on until I got home which was a lot longer than indicated. I was a little nervous about how it would turn out, but it was perfect. I added carrots  and onions. The meat fell apart and melted in your mouth, carrots were cooked perfectly (not mushy at all) and the gravy was delicious. It is now a regular part of our menu.

I made this but doubled the packets and water because I added onion, red potatoes, celery and carrots. It turned out delicious. It didn't have a "packet-y" or artificial taste at all...the flavors actually worked really well with the roast. Thanks! :)

Delicious and SO easy. I seasoned the roast with salt and pepper and pressed it into a layer of flour before placing it in the crockpot and pouring the seasonings over it. This helps thicken the sauce. Great with cornbread, my favorite meal!

I love this recipe. Based on a few of the "too salty" reviews, I used 2 cups of water and kept everything else exactly the same. I thought it was fantastic, and the gravy wasn't watery, as some have described. I used a 2.5 chuck roast.

Awesome! The only changes I made was I added potatoes, celery, onions and carrots. YUM! The BF also loved it. Thanks!

This is wonderful.  The roast was so tender that it was falling apart on the fork.  If it is too salty for your taste (as it was for mine) you can modify using lower sodium dressing mixes or making your own instead of using packaged dressing mixes.

This recipe was very easy to make and came out great! I followed the recipe, but added some additional seasoning to the meat. It came out very tender, and the gravy was delicious! I now have a new pot roast recipe. I will continue to make this. Thanks so much for sharing!

5 stars & 2 thumbs up. So easy & the taste is out if this world. I haven't made a roast any other way since I found this recipe. Seasoning mixes also go well w/ pork.

I had never made a roast before and wanted to try to make one. After searching different recipes I ran across this one and it seemed pretty easy, so I decided to try it. Boy am I glad I did! It is delicious! I added carrots and onions to the crockpot and made gravy with the juices to serve over mashed potatoes. Yummy! This will definitely be my forever recipe for roast!!

after reading the other reviews, I substituted beef broth for the water and it was by far the best roast I have ever made...this is definitely a keeper and so easy to fix.  You can do so much with this basic recipe.  I did sandwiches the first time and then did a beef stew - both were big hits with my family.

BY FAR the best crock pot receiepe out there. It is super easy and mine turned out to have more of a glaze to it. I cooked it for 8 hours on low. My husband had FOUR servings of it!! I will be making this again and loved it so much, I would like to make it again this week!

I would have given it a better rating but it was just too salty for my husband and I. All those packed have too much sodium. I cooked it the stated time and it was a little tough. Will have to go back to the old fashioned way.

Making this today. Made it before and it was TO DIE FOR for sure.
Today I'm using a better cut of beef as my hubby is asking for Traditional Roast Beef with Mashed Potatoes and Mushroom Gravy. 
"Boneless Bottom Round Beef Roast" is what I'm using. 
Steamed Broccoli with Cheese Sauce and Crescent Rolls. Now That is an Old Fashion Sunday Dinner which I haven't made in a very long time.

My brother made this for dinner tonight and it was outstanding!  He used a bottom round roast and added an extra cup of water.  During the last 3 hours of cooking time he added cubed potatoes, sliced carrots, fresh string beans and sliced celery.  He cooked on low for 9 hours.  The meat was fork-tender.  He made gravy with the juices and it was out of this world.  Definitely a keeper of a recipe.

Made this today.  It smelled divine.  I will admit I also added a splash of red wine, but didn't mess with it otherwise.  Very tasty, very tender.  I will make this again for sure!

This was simple but oh so delicious. Just make sure you have enough time to let it sit in the crock pot the longer the  better.  My husband and I ate this after about 6 & 1/2 hr's but my son didn't eat until an hour later. He said it was the best pot roast he ever tasted and I wholeheartedly agree. I'm not handy in the kitchen so this is so great for people like me. Thank you!

THE BEST ROAST EVER!!!  My husband used to be fine with roast but now that I make it this way he asks for it every week.  I throw in a few cut up potatoes and carrots and dinner is done.  Pour the gravy over the roast, potatoes, and carrots and it’s to die for.  No other seasoning needed!  Wonderful.  Thanks so much.

I'm not someone who likes to cook, so the more simple the better. This recipe was simple, easy, and tastes pretty good! I would like to know if there is another cut of meat that would work because this boneless beef chuck had a lot of fat in it. Also, is there a way I can thicken the gravy without losing flavor? Thanks!

Excellent!  Easy and flavorful.  Used a london broil and the spicy ranch packet.  Hubby has been making French Dip sandwiches with the leftovers.  Thanks for posting!!!
