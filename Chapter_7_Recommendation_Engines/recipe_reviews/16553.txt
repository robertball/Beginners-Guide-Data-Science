After reading the other reviews I made my own variation and the kids loved it. I substituted approximately 4 cups of chicken nuggets for the chicken meat, added another Tbl. of soy sauce, a teaspoon of ginger, some onion and garlic powder and a cup of chinese vegetables. My kids ate this very well and asked that I make it once a week.

Not a keeper-my kids and I thought it didn't have much flavor-my husband took one bite and called out for pizza. I didn't care for the soy sauce-soup combo-didn't taste right. Won't be making again

This tastes nothing like the cashew chicken I am used to.  Too bland.

This casserole was too bland for my tastes, and needs some spicing up. My husband and I decided shredded turkey would be better than chicken, then add some garlic and a generous helping of lemon pepper. If you're making this for the first time, try halfing the recipe in case you don't like it. I still have leftovers in my refrigerator that I'll probably end up throwing out, unfortunately. The only redeeming quality of this recipe was the cashews.

This recipe wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  We really had to think about whether it was a "do again" or "never again".  Since it was just ok, I don't believe I will try it again.  I guess I just didn't like the soy sauce flavor with the soups.

The fastest dish I've ever made...  Took only a few minutes to make.  I agree that it lacks flavor.  I used more soy sauce, boneless chicken thighs (super soft meat) and served with edamame.

I used cream of celery instead of mushroom because I hate mushrooms and it was ok.  It is very bland, needs a little spicing up.

chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken then added it in w/ the rest.

it is bland. it really needs some kind of spice...

My husband and I really liked this casserole!  Of course, I made a few changes, ok maybe a lot of changes.  I only used 1/2 cup chicken broth and only one can of soup - the cream of chicken.  I also only used 2 cups of (brown) rice.  I added 1 clove minced garlic, 1 tsp. grated ginger root, 1 can bamboo shoots and 1 can sliced water chestnuts.  I cut up 1 lb. chicken breast into 1" pieces and baked the casserole at 350 for 30 minutes.  My husband thought it was a lot like Chinese food and was suprised to hear there was a can of soup in it.  It was just the right amount of food for the 2 of us, with leftovers for the next night.  This is a keeper!  Next time I will add diced carrots and celery too.

Good, but lacks flavor and appealing color. Adding typical Chinese vegetables such as bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, baby corn, etc. helps, as well as a bit more soy sauce and some paprika for the color.

Every casserole doesn't need to be rated five stars to be worthwhile.  I'm giving this recipe 3 stars though I'd go with 3 1/2 if 1/2 star increments were allowed.  It's very convenient and tastes pretty good.  I didn't have enough cashews, so in keeping with the Chinese cooking theme, I topped the casserole with chow mein noodles, which I had left over from another recipe.  It worked great!  I also added a couple cloves of garlic.  In the future, I may consider adding a little onion, celery, and water chestnuts.  This recipe came out slightly dry.  As another reviwer recommends, consider adding another 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  Because it's so easy and taste better than average, I will likely prepare this again.

I added another 1/2 cup of broth as otherwise it seemed that it would get too dry and also added a clove of finely chopped garlic and some generous helpings of Aromat as so many reviewers had commented on it being too bland. The result was very tasty and it makes for a great new take on comfort food. It's not my Absolutely Favourite Dish of all Times but I do think that I'll be making it again.

Recipe was very good. It really needed more soy sauce than it called for to give it more flavor. I made it with boneless skinless chicken breasts and it came out great.

I usually make it first w/o changes, but at the last minute I couldn't resist adding a few things.  Like celery seed, onion powder, garlic powder, little creole, and I thought a little paprika might give it a little bit of color.  But one thing I did different for sure, was I cooked it all on top of the stove.  I am just not one to bake something like this in the oven, especially since I started it on the stove.  So I did a low slow simmer since I was already fiddling around in the kitchen.  It stayed moist, the chicken was tender and very flavorful.  I only used one tbs of soy as I only had 2.5 leg quarters, and my broth is from a dry mix that I get at the Mennonite store so I think it is salty enough.  I had a little instant brown rice, so I added that, and I cooked and kept my white rice separate and served the chicken over top of it.  Then I topped with a few extra cashews.  I will make this again.  It was an easy one pot fix.  It didnt claim to be just like the Chinese restaurant.  It claimed to be hassle free and it definitely was so it is a keeper for us and will go into the rotation.  It can't get just a whole lot easier than this one.  Thank you for sharing!

I don't like dark chicken meat, so I used all white chicken breasts, which I precooked in a bit of butter, I also added some garlic and lawry's seasoning salt.
I put in a 4oz can of sliced mushrooms also,  and added about a 1/2 cup more cashews.
I also covered the casserole with foil while baking,  I only baked it 20 minutes.   it was good.  but it makes 9 servings,  not 4 like the recipe said when I printed it out.

I get an awful craving for Cashew Chicken, so I was really pleased to see this recipe.  When pre-cooked broccoli bits and sliced water chestnuts are added to the soup mixture, nothing was missing at all!  This recipe makes a lot, which is a good thing becuase I can't wait to heat up some leftovers.  I will make this again, but probably throw in some baby corn and bamboo shoots next time to give it a little more Chinese restaurant-style fanfare.  Try it and see what you think!

added a few things and it was awesome! Cut the recipe in 1/2- just hubby and me. 2 small chicken breasts that I thawed and boiled for 20 mn, 1 can of cream of mushroom, 3/4 cup chicken broth, 2 cups cooked brown rice. Kept in the 1 cup of cashews and used 3 tblsp soy sauce. I did saute a small amount of chopped celery, onion, garlic before hand to add to soup mixture. added pepper and peas. Absolutely tasty and delicious!!

My great grandma made a similar version of this.  The only thing I do different is add in 1 C each diced onion and celery sauteed in butter, and chow mein noodles on top, and chicken breast.

I love this meal.  It is a great meal to fix and continue to eat for leftovers as I am a single person.  I am a picky eater, so I do a few substitutes (like two cans of cream of chicken soup instead of 1/1 of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom).  I also add more cashews!  YUM!

Great. I used it for a dinner party and everyone raved about how good it was. I have used it since changing out the soups and using cream of asparagus, celery, whatever is on hand. I used cut up chicken breasts so it was easier to serve. I have also added canned or leftover vegetables to the mix. It's a favorite.

I thought this recipe was absolutely fantastic.  The only thing I would do is adjust the cooking time to almost 45 minutes.  After 25 the chicken was still VERY pink.

pretty good.  i did NOT use soy sauce, i seasoned with vegetable dip seasoning (would have liked 2 packs,but only had one) and like a tsp of creole seasoning instead.  pretty nice little recipe. will make again, but gonna try with french onion dip seasoning next time.  :)  it took me like 10 minutes to throw it all together & get it in the oven.  perfect with a new baby in the house!

This wasn't terrible, but it was very bland, was was way more of a pain than I'm willing to spend on something that's not AWESOME.  The cashews get a little mushy from being in the liquid, and the sauce is really bland, and I'm someone who likes bland.  I bet picky kids would like it, but I might think about sauteing the chicken first with some spices, so it has some taste.

This was incredibly tasty and received rave reviews from my husband.  It has just the right amount of crunchiness and variety.  I served this with a simple salad and french bread.

Do not make this recipe! It was very, very dry - too much rice, not enough liquids. I have a family of 6 and none ate it. What a waste.

This is a good solid week night recipe, though not something I am going to use for guests.

I also made several changes - I used uncooked rice, and used 1.5 cups of vegetable broth instead of 1 cup of chicken broth (extra liquid to cook the rice, and extra flavor in the veg broth).  I also used chicken breasts (precooked in garlic, parsley, and veg broth).  I added extra cashews, and loaded up with lots of stir-fry type veggies to perk up the flavor.  It was very good and easy.

There wasn't anything special about the recipe at all.  I won't be making it again.

I wish I could give this no stars or negative stars.  No amount of soy sauce, onion, celery, garlic, water chestnuts or anything else will save this terrible recipe. (I added all of the above after reading the reviews.)  It is very nearly inedible.
