Quite tasty! I used parchment paper and baked on a cookie sheet. The dough was very stiff and hard to incorporate all the flour, but I resisted the urge to add anything. I rolled it between two layers of parchment, directly onto the cookie sheet. We don't care for candied citron so I added 1/2 c. raisins and no nuts. I made a vanilla glaze and applied it while still warm. Great with my morning coffee.

I cut the amount of brown sugar in half.   Probably a mistake.
