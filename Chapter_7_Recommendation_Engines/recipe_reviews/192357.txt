This Chili has a great texture.  I was skeptical of a chili that didn't include any corn starch to thicken the sauce.  But this really turned out well.  The pressure cooker makes this a quick, easy, and energy efficient recipe.

This is the best red chili I've made so far. My aunt's white bean chili is still my personal favorite. The brown sugar really set this chili apart for me while the spicyness was still there.

I make Chili frequently in the winter.  Using my electric pressure cooker makes it so easy!  I really liked this recipe.  You can make it as basic or as fancy as you want.  I usually leave out hot spices as some family members do not tolerate it.  I increased the meat to 2 lbs. as family likes a lot of meat in the chili.  Also, I only added enough additional water to rinse the tomato sauce cans, probably 1/2 to 1/3 cup as we like our chili thick.

I made this tonight and it turned out great. I used two minced chipotle peppers instead of the jalepeno and fire roasted tomatoes rather than plain. I increased the cocoa and chili powder by a full TBSP each.

For those wanting a thicker chili - Reserve a 1/2 cup or so of the beans and mash them before adding to the chili. This will thicken the chili. Or just wait until the chili is done and smash some of the beans against the side of the pot. You can also decrease the amount of water in the recipe to suit your taste.

I think this is a great recipe, and I don't think it's missing anything.  I made this for a potluck dinner, and it was one of the first things to go.  I don't have a pressure cooker so I cooked the ground beef, onions and peppers on the stove and then made the recipe in the crockpot.  I  will make this again.

This was amazing chili!  I am normally not a huge fan of chili, but my husband made this and I went back for seconds!  He did add a second jalapeno for a little more spice.  Next time, I think we may cut the water added down to 1 cup.  This was so delicious though!  Thanks for the great recipe!

this is delicious!!   I was skeptical of the brown sugar and cocoa powder, but I will be deleting all previous chili recipes!  I substituted ground turkey and added about 1/4 to 1/2 lb of extra lean beef, and used a quart of my home-canned tomatoes.  Otherwise, I followed exactly.  Served with grated cheddar and a dollop of light sour cream.

This was really good.  I use a similar recipe that I cook in a crock pot all day.  This was better and much faster using a pressure cooker.

This is my favorite chili recipe.  Today I made it Vegetarian by switching 1 16oz bag Morningstar Recipe Crumbles for the hamburger.  I just sauteed the onions, green pepper and garlic, then stirred in the Crumbles with everything else.

I agree with Whatayawant; it is missing something, maybe more chili powder, but it is good.  I saved the recipe for later use.

I never make any changes to someone else's recipe. Then it would be a new recipe and demeaning to the original maker. You wouldn't have to with this recipe anyway. It was GREAT as is. My husband and I thought it to be the best chili recipe I have ever made and I have made many. It was simple and delicious. Thank you, spyce

I made this recipe. I didn't use the sugar or the coco. I will another time. I wanted a base recipe as I've never made made slow cooker chili.  I used red pinto and back beans and it came out great  - no left overs. I will make again.

This has been my go-to for pc chili for > 4years. I love the use of cocoa. It adds a nice dimension to the meal. Tonight's version was made with Elk venison. Yum.

I did try it tonight. I went out and bought all the ingredients. That is except the chili powder. I had chili mix and thought it was the same thing. I came home and set up my new pressure cooker and found out it didn't work. I still made the recipe using chili mix instead of powder so I should have used a little more. And I cooked it on stove in a pot instead of a pressure cooker. It was still good and I will make it again.

I made this almost as directed (no jalapenos due to sensitive palates, subbed ground turkey, also used chicken broth per alternate directions).  It was delicious!  It was my husband's favorite chili thus far.  Thanks for the recipe!

This chili was fantastic, I made it yesterday.  I doubled the recipe and used 1lb of ground beef, and 1lb of johnsonville italian suasage removed from the casings.  I don't know if it was the recipe, or the pressure cooker, but I must say, this is the best chili I have ever made, or eaten.  Fantastic.  I do love my chili hot and spicy, however, I needed a recipe that the wife and kids could eat, this is the one!!!

Fantastic--my first recipe using the pressure cooker, and it turned out wonderful.   I added smoked paprika for more smoke flavor, but I think I will add more salt next time, and maybe some black pepper for an increased aromatic sensation.  Heat was good--I think my family would actually like this really well.  Hard to believe such incredible taste and texture can be had in right around half an hour.  I'll cook this again!

This chili is fantastic. I added a little more spice with peppers. In Denver on snowy nights this was perfect. Thank you for the great recipe.

I am going to try this recipe this week.  Have used a pressure cooker for over 43 years.  Have just been given an electric digital pressure cooker that has a browning element in it.  Can also be used as a steamer or as a crock pot.  What Joy !!!!  with a little planning, One dish cooking!

Disappointed with how watery it was. The only changes I had made to it was using red pepper instead of green sweet pepper and a green cayenne pepper instead of the jalapeno.  When I opened up the pressure cooker it looked like chili soup. I think 2c of liquid is too much when cooked in a pressure cooker since so little liquid cooks out of it.  The taste was good, but I agree that it needs a little something... maybe a hint of chipotle or something.

I made this for dinner tonight & absolutely loved it! Easy peasy and best of all, a quick one pot wonder. I tried to follow the recipe exactly my first time out, but didn't have all ingredients on hand. Also, small kitchen, limited storage space, cooking for one, so I halved the recipe for my 2 qt. pressure cooker, and ended up a little shy of max fill, so that worked out. I didn't have coco, brown sugar or jalepeno, substituted 1 10-oz can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies. Oh, and I also left out the beans as a personal preference. Sooooo delicious & hearty, best chili I've ever made and this is now my go to recipe. I like a thicker chili, but this was not at all too watery as is. I just went old school with a bit of Wondra to thicken up a bit & voila! How nice of Spyce to also include instructions to thicken with smashed beans for those who prefer thicker consistency...brilliant idea! I do that very thing to thicken "gravy" for beans, but would not have thought of doing that to thicken chili, so thank you Spyce. Since I made this recipe beanless, I think what I will do is cook a pot of beans, smash 'em up & freeze in ice trays specifically to add  to this recipe as a thickening agent. I can't wait to make this again with all ingredients, but it was perfect to me even without coco, brown sugar, jalapenos. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Really like this easy recipe. Used my Instant Pot electric pressure cooker. Only changes: used ground turkey & omitted jalapeño pepper as it's too hot for our taste. The rest I cooked as written. Will make again. Very easy and extra tasty with a pan of fresh cornbread.

We really loved this one! I substituted one can of chili beans w/ spices and then kept one can of plain rinsed kidney beans. Everything else was the same and we loved it! A tad on the spicy side for my baby, but nothing a little sour cream couldn't take care of.

This recipe needs some 'ump'. I followed the recipe as is with the exception of the Jalapeño. It needed more something...salt? other spices? I even went heavy on the 2 tbsp of Chili powder. It aggravates me because it took a lot of money for all those ingredients & we only ate 2 bowls out of it. The leftovers are in the fridge; maybe it'll be better after sitting overnight. :-/

I loved this recipe!  I didn't have any bell peppers, used only one regular can of fire roasted diced tomatoes(that's all I had), 1/3 of a regular can of tomato sauce (to make up for the other can of diced tomatoes I didn't have), 2 T of Penzy's Chili 3000 because I didn't have all of the other spices.  I used 1 1/2 C of water instead of 2.  So, basically I used what I had and tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible from there.  I wouldn't omit the cocoa or sugar!  That's what makes it so good!  Thank you for the recipe!

Perfectly easy, delicious too! Was a perfect recipe for the pressure cooker, made it easy! I 'drained' the ground beef by laying it out on paper towels after frying to maximize the fat drain. I cut the jalapeno in rings to make it recognizable.

Yummy!  I used this recipe for the first use of my pressure cooker.  It turned out delicious and I would make it again.  I used muscovy duck instead of beef. Instead of canned beans, I used dried, black beans that I soaked for 4 hours, then cooked for 12 minutes in the pressure cooker.  I love the sweet flavor that the brown sugar added.

LOVE this recipe.  I've used a variety of different diced tomatoes, some with chilies and some without.  Add some grated cheese over the top and it's a favorite for our family.  I'd recommend 1 can of Rotel w/diced chilies and 1 can w/o if you want a little spice but not much. It mellows the next day regardless.

Not much for following recipes and, therefore, can't say that I've ever managed to make the same batch twice. However, this one just might be the first one I repeat. 
I did tweak the printed recipe a bit, which follows:
Used one can of tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce instead of Rotel, and 1.5 lb of ground beef.
Substituted a can of beef broth for the water.
Used 1/4 cup of catsup, and no sugar or tomatoes paste.
Two packets of Goya Coriander and Annatto. 
Two teaspoons of minced garlic.
Added an extra teaspoon each of both chocolate and of cumin, and a teaspoon each of dried cilantro and dried oregano.
Added one tablespoon of Adobo from a can of chipotles and a shake of cinnamon.
Skipped the red pepper and jalapeno, I figured that the adobo and extra chili powder added enough heat.

Family really enjoys.  Make it for big game day and similar gatherings.  I use more meat than the recipe calls for, to balance vs the amount beans (it’s a little heavy on the beans for our tastes). Substituted turkey for some of the ground beef: I use about 1.5 lbs beef and 1 lb ground turkey. Sooo good!

Wow, what depth of flavor.  So rich and smooth!  It is chili with an Oaxacan flair.  Went to my parents to stay and care for them throughout a huge snow storm and tried it.  They Said it was the best chili I have made.  I was a chef and actually placed 3rd in a Washington DC chili cook off and have been using the same recipe for years, so I updated it!

I added Worcestershire sauce to the recipe and used tomatillios as these are things I have always put in chili. I also used soaked pintos rather then canned beans.
The chili turned out great and will make this again..

This is the best I have ever tasted !!
It has the sweet, savory, spicy flavor I desired in a chili. Not too hot, not dull and boring either. I ate some straight out of the pressure cooker, and plan to smother cornbread with some  for lunch. Like most foods, it will taste even better tomorrow. This makes me want to pressure cook more; being new at it. Thank you thank you thank you !!!

Wow!! Cocoa and dark brown sugar?? I'm waiting for my cooker to depressurize, so I haven't tasted it yet. I can hardly wait!! I'm gonna go ahead and give it five stars, because I've not tasted any chili I didn't like.

I added a little twist to the recipe... I added a teaspoon (or so) of yellow mustard.

I'll let all know how that went.

This is one of my favorite recipes! The only change I made and would recommend for a thicker chili is either adding the whole can of tomato paste or cutting the water down to about a cup. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to a T and it came out a little soupy for my preference, but after said changes it’s perfect!

Best chili I've ever tasted!! Making it again this weekend for my adult children's families by request, after I raved over it. Followed directions exactly, which I rarely do since I usually measure ingredients in my hand, and the only substitute was a few dashes of Cayenne pepper because I was out of red pepper flakes. I've been making chili for over 40 years, and have many great recipes, but regardless of the cooking method, this chili is the best!

I’m really sorry, I used the exact ingredients but not the pressure cooker I have! I’m still very old school and I do trust the newer versions of pressure cookers but I made this exact recipe on the stove! I really am still afraid of pressure cookers blowing my head off (thank you Nana Nick Nick), but am adjusting! The ingredients (unsweetened chocolate powder) is amazing! It’s an awwwwwesome flavor!

I used this as a basic recipe for measurements and such.It was a great jumping off point for something a bit different. I used fresh spanich chilis instead of the jalapenos,  cubes (stew beef) instead of ground beef, and since I didn't have marjoram, I used oregano. I also snuck in a lot more cumin, because I like the smoky flavor. For the spicier people in the room, I added a dash or two of tabasco. Was delish. Thanks!

I didn’t put in the jalapeños. Instead of 2 cans of kidney beans I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans. Instead of 2 cups of water, I used 1 1/2. It turned out perfectly!

My 5 year old devoured two bowls and said she wished she could eat it for every meal....enough said!  

I made it very similarly to the recipe as shown.  I reduced the chili powder just a bit and used petite diced tomatoes with sweet onion.  I also cut up half a whole onion because we enjoy that flavor.  I’ll make again.

This was my first time ever making chili and it was fantastic. I followed the recipe as is except for only using 1 cup of water as some of the comments suggested and my hand slipped with the cumin so it was slightly more than the recipe called for.

I did 1 can of kidney beans and one can of black beans instead of 2 of the red kidney beans, I also added a can of whole corn kernels.  And I put in some crystal hot sauce ;)  next time I think I might add a bayleaf into the mix, but thats mostly personal tastes.

This is excellent chili.  If you prefer heat in your chili, you will want to bump the red pepper, or add cayenne, or another jalapeño

I liked it. I added a clove of garlic used home canned  and frozen peppers. 
I'm looking for pressure cooker recipes as I'm sensitive to lectins in beans tomatos and peppers. Pressure cooking greatly reduces and just about eliminates them. 
Than You for the recipe.

Very nice and easy to make.  Often sub ground turkey and white cannellini beans for this recipe and add about 1 cup of diced sweet potato, which is really nice and adds more body to the chilli.

Yes, first pressure cooker meal! This was wonderful! I really enjoyed it cocoa and Brown sugar gives it an interesting taste first time to use these ingredients in a chili.  Because I read reviews about being too thin I substituted 2 cans of tomato sauce for the water and tomato paste. Picked tomatoes from our garden cut up in place of canned tomatoes. Turned out perfect. I did not have any peppers. My husband doesn't like his food fiery. 
This is now my favorite chili. Thanks!!!

Made this last night but made some modifications to the recipe. I used 2 pounds of beef instead of 1 pound, used a 40 oz can of kidney beans, 1 large can of crushed tomatoes (I forget how many ounces it was), 1 entire can of tomato paste and left out the cocoa.  Everything else was the same.  My 12 year old doesn't like the chili real spicy so leaving the chili powder, cumin and Jalapeno at the original measurements was just enough spice after adding the additional ingredients.  It turned out great and my wife actually complimented it!

Flavour was good but recipe called for far to much water. I doubled the batch and it was more like chili soup. If I make again I will reduce water by half.

I've made this chili several times. It has always turned out very good just following the recipe. However, the recipe doesn't specify what pressure to use with your pressure cooker. I've always used high pressure, but I bleed off the pressure with the release valve over a period of about 10 min. Using high pressure, and then letting the pressure bleed off naturally (as the recipe specifies) seems to over-cook the chili. YMMV depending on your pressure cooker. A few successful variations that I've tried: 1. Ground buffalo instead of beef. Super yummy and healthy, and no need to drain the meat after browning. Buffalo is very lean to start with. 2. Vegetable broth instead of water. 3. Leave the seeds in the jalapeño if you want some extra kick. 4. I was out of cocoa powder once and used ground cinnamon and it turned out great.

My new kitchen toy is a pressure cooker -- and I can't imagine how I lived so long without it!  Everything comes out so tender and flavorful . . . I really love it.  

I was a bit concerned, however, about making chili in it because I'd never used ground meat in the pressure cooker.  The way chicken, turkey and even ham comes out of it literally falling apart (and off the bone), I was worried that ground meat would just disintegrate.  It didn't though.  It came out terrific!

I made the chili exactly per the recipe, took it to the office for a pot luck and everybody raved about it.  I will make this again and not change a thing.

I liked it a lot.  I did add a 2nd Jalapeno and I used ground turkey which my teenage son commented he couldn't even tell it was turkey.  I also used 2 bottles of Herdez salsa instead of the tomatoes and onion called out in the recipe.

So easy and delicious! I've made this a few times now! Added extra onions, bell peppers  (red and green  diced), little extra garlic and serve with homemade corn muffins with honey, and sour cream and cheese to top off this fabulous chili!! Half hour dinner is served!!

We didn't care for the sweetness and it really didn't have enough kick.

While I love the smell of chili cooking all day in the slow cooker, I have been searching for new ways to use the pressure cooker for hearty, quick and flavorful meals, and this recipe didn't disappoint! With the modifications below, it won my office chili cookoff!!!

- 50/50 mix of ground beef and ground turkey - better for you and it softens the texture, as if you've been cooking it for hours;

- Addition of a 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp of Chipotle Chile Powder
- Addition of a 1/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp of Smoked Paprika
- Slough of flour/water to tighten mixture

Both additional spices help spice up sometimes unflavorful turkey, but the real secret to great chile is already in the recipe: chocolate.

I make this chili regularly. I do find that it needs more chili powder for our tastes. I double the chili powder and cut the cumin in half. I'm not sure I need to cut the cumin in half, it just always seems like a lot of cumin to me, and not enough chili powder. This is a great basic recipe for pressure cooker chili, easily adjusted for personal tastes. Thanks! Making it again tonight with black beans.

Way too sweet and I didn't even add all the brown sugar. My canned tomatoes do NOT have sugar in them, either. I added more salt and more chile powder, but still the flavor was flat. It needed something else, just not quite sure what that is yet.

I'm not a huge chili lover but this one was fantastic.  I added 1 can of chick peas and only one kidney bean cause my kids love chick peas.  All 4 kids gobbled it up and had seconds.  Not spicy but nice and tangy.  Definitely a huge hit and our new go to chili.

I added an extra pound of lean ground beef, next time I'll make it an even 3 pounds.  Looking at it, if I'd only used the 1 pound that they called for it wouldn't be meaty at all.  I'd probably cut down on the crush red peppers, and use half a Jalapeno and use mild Rotel.  Other than that it was great, served with Tortilla Chips crushed.  And the prep time is soooo incorrect.

I made a double-batch in the Instant Pot IP DUO60, with a couple of modifications. I added 3 slices of Chipotle-smoked bacon from Whole Foods, and used 85% lean grass-fed beef. I also used 2 large jalapeños (not seeded) and 5 smaller cloves of garlic. After cooking for 10 minutes, I released the pressure, opened the lid, and added a 16oz box of whole wheat Fusilli, resealed the lid and let it sit for another 20 minutes or so until done. I was hoping for a spicier chili, but this has a good, hearty texture and awesome flavor. I like the addition of the cocoa powder.

Was great chili the first time but a little spicey for the grandkids. Made it again without the jalapeno and was really great with just enough spice. I also used an electric pressure cooker. Thanks for the recepie. I also tried it and used navy beans instead of kidney beans

Split the 2 cups water with 1 cup of beer, added 2 teaspoons of red crushed pepper for a HOT spicy chili.  Pressure cooked for 40 minutes. Perfect!!! Best Chili I ever had.

Will definitely try this-- but minus the sugar and cocoa powder-- unless you're making Cincinnati style "chili", which is an entirely different thing, sugar and chocolate have no place in chili...
