I have made this recipe many times and here are my tips: Double recipe, line 9x13 pan with parchment paper to easily lift out finished product. 
Make caramel exactly as written, but low heat with constant stirring. I have never had a problem. Shortbread should be slightly cooled- mine usually goes from the oven to the freezer and sits for about ten minutes before I pour on the caramel. It will not ruin the shortbread, I promise.
I use dark chocolate instead of milk to level off the sweetness of the caramel a bit. I microwave the chocolate exactly as written, but add a tablespoon of butter. This absorbs into and smooths out the chocolate much better than milk.

Finally, cut squares while chocolate is still just slightly soft with a heated knife. (I run mine under very hot water then dry it off). 
These are not difficult, it just takes time to get to the finished product.
Bon Appetit!

The final product tasted great and was a big hit at a potluck lunch at my school, but, one thing in the recipe could be a bit clearer.  It should say to let the shortbread cool quite a bit before putting on the caramel. I let mine cool for 5-10 minutes and then poured on the hot caramel and it all sunk into a big puddle in the middle. That batch had to be scrapped and another made.  It turned out fine as I let the shortbread cool overnight.  I found them easy to cut as I cut them when the chocolate was still soft. The cookie did crumble a bit, but that was fine. Very yummy, just like what I used to get in London.

I made a terrible mistake with these. I gave them all AWAY!! Oh they tasted wonderful. I sort of wish I had kept a few for myself, although it's better for my waistline that I didn't. :) They were very easy and were delicious. I made a few changes based upon the reviews here. After I baked the crust, I poked holes in it with a fork and let it cool completely. I cooked the caramel over a lower heat and cooked it to the firm ball stage on my candy thermometer. I let that layer cool completely. I melted the chocolate with a little evaporated skim milk to keep it from getting too hard when it set up, and it was perfect. I tried cutting these when it wasn't cold and the cookies crumbled. I put it in the freezer for a bit and then tried to cut it again and the cookies were perfect. Everything came out wonderfully and I'll definately make these again.

I followed everyone's posting prior to making this great recipe. Double recipe and cook in 9 by 13 dish. Line pan with foil. Prick shortbread after baking. Cool in freezer between steps and use litte half and half with chocolate. These are super easy and very tastey will make a gain.  GREAT RECIPE!!!!

Fantastic! I made these last night and took the advice of several people and they were incredible. I greased and floured a 9x9 pan and they came out looking just like the picture. It is those of you that used a larger pan that...they came out too thin. I poked holes in the raw shortbread and then cooked for the time stated...then let it cool for only about 10 minutes....then added the carmel mixture (I did add a little extra milk)...let it set up well and then melted the chocolate with a little bit of half and half. I put it in the fridge for about a half hour...scored them and then let them sit in the pan...in the fridge all night. I cut them this morning and all I can say is...WOW!!!! They are incredible!!! The shortbread was prefect...the carmel was nice and thick yet very smooth....no hard in the least and the chocolate just melts in your mouth. It definitely taste similar to a twix bar but so, so much better. Try these....you will be so glad that you did!

This are great!!  I've made them many times.  Cook the shortbread, let it cool, then place it in the freezer while you are making the caramel. Let the caramel cool in the fridge before putting the chocolate on.  Another great thing to do is to line your pan with tinfoil, then you can lift them out to cut them.

This recipe tastes incredibly good, but I found two problems with it.  First of all, it is really easy to scorch the caramel filling - you have to stir both constantly and rapidly to avoid that - Because of that I burned my hand so badly it blistered.  The other problem with it is that the shortbread tends to fall off of the rest of the bar, making it very messy to eat or serve.  However, it tastes incredible so I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying this recipe.

Yummy!  I found these easy to make and delicious. Brought them in for a potluck and they were gone in 30 minutes!  You're going to be tempted to put the pan in the fridge to "set" the caramel but I've found (after doing this a couple of times) that it makes the crust more crumbly and causes them to taste a bit stale even. Be patient - the caramel will set on its own.  Also, be sure to melt your MILK chocolate chips in a double boiler as they don't melt quite the same as semi-sweet in the microwave I've found.  Definitely cut them small - extremely rich.  Love these - make them all the time!

My co-workers and I loved these.  Just like homemade twix bars.
Helpful suggestions:  They pop right out of the pan if you grease *and* flour the pan.  The bottom crust is really easy to make in the food processor; just process into coarse crumbs.  The caramel is very good, but you need to watch it the whole time and use low heat.  I also found that the recipe is better if you cool the shortbread before putting in the caramel.  I only cooled these till the caramel was stiff, so the  melted chocolate ran over the sides of the bars, making them more like twix.  Oh, and be sure to run a knife around the pan before trying to get them out.  Happy cooking and eating!

Wonderful! This is exactly what I was looking for. Super easy, and delicious! The caramel was great, and actually tasted like caramel unlike a lot that is homemade. It kind of tastes like a homemade twix bar. The shortbread was soft and delicious. I substituted half the sugar in the shortbread with Splenda and it still turned out great! For those who had trouble with the caramel and chocolate, you simply have to cook them over low heat and keep stirring! The chocolate is easy to do in the microwave. Just melt for 30 seconds, stir, then 20 more seconds, then stir, and then 10 more seconds, stir and pour. One of my favorites, this is definitely a keeper!

Decadently Delicious! I used the "calculate servings" button to adjust this recipe for a 9 x 13 pan (60 servings) and a jelly roll pan (80 servings) and a large double sheet cake 12 x 17 pan (about 120 servings). We will be making a LOT of these to give at the holidays.   I made half my 9 x 13 pan with the crust recipe as written and spread 1/2 cup chopped pecans over the other half of the crust before baking. Followed the recipe as written otherwise. As written, 5 stars, but even better with the chopped pecans on the crust!   Had no problems with crust crumbling- perhaps the pecans help with that, as well as with the caramel sticking to the crust. I made a batch of these in a jelly roll pan today- and made some changes.  I added some salt to the caramel mixture during the boiling to help with adding depth of flavor and tone down some of the sweetness.  Makes sense- "salted caramel" is everywhere on the cooking shows these days.  I added about 3/4 tsp salt for 80 servings in a jelly roll pan.  they go so fast!  So Yummy you can't go wrong with these!

Disaster from the beginning!  While cooking the caramel, it burned horribly.  I was able to salvage it, but IF I were making this again (which I doubt), I would have used a double boiler to make the caramel.  When I melted the chocolate chips, it turned into a fudgy texture, making it clumpy to spread on the caramel.  I have not removed them from the pan, except a small piece to taste, but the crust crumbled into my hand.  While it was tasty, these are VERY messy, both to make and eat.  I don't think I'd bother with these again.

I modified this using another recipe that I had wanted to try, and they came out great!!  I used 1 stick of butter, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 c of flour for the shortbread.  Make sure this layer is completely cool before topping with caramel.  I cheated the caramel layer and melted 1 14oz bag of caramels with 2 T of cream.  I let this cool and then set completely (about an hour).  Then, to solve the problem of the shortbread and caramel separating, i cut my pan in half and then sliced into about 1" piece logs and dipped them in the melted chocolate.  I got about 20 bars from this recipe.  These were a pretty good recplication of twix bars, and because i cut back on the amount of butter in the shortbread, I think they had just the right texture.  They impressed my family.

I found these to be okay.  Maybe with all my struggles I had higher expectations.  Few tips... For the caramel layer, boil 5-7 minutes as suggested but DON'T stir vigurously for 3 minutes after removing from the heat.  MAYBE 1 minute, but any longer and the caramel starts to set up and become difficult to spread over the base.  Secondly, as suggested by some reviewers DON'T add evaporated milk to your chocolate layer to prevent it from hardening too much!  If you know much about adding milk to chocolate, you should know that this will make your chocolate seize up and be useless!  Don't waste your chocolate!  If you want a softer topping, just add 1 Tbsp. butter to your melting chocolate and it will give you a great result.  Chilled between all layers and seemed to work okay.  Probably won't be tackling these for a while again.

Wow! These are really rich and delicious. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan (that's a LOT of butter!). The five minute boiling time is perfect for the caramel. I lined my pan with foil to make it easy to take out and cut into pieces. I didn't have any problem with the caramel not sticking on the shortbread layer. It honestly looked exactly like the picture shown with the recipe so I was impressed! This is going on my holiday goodie baking list permanently! I have discovered that the sweetened condensed milk you use will make a significant difference. This year all I had on hand was reduced fat sweetened condensed milk and my caramel was much softer than when I've used regular Eagle Brand. I suspect fat free would be even less succesful, so beware.

Don't waste your time making this as a single batch…these don't last long and then everyone will whine that they didn't get one. Amazingly yummy but then with that much butter they have to be…why I only make 'em during the holidays!

A grown-up twix bar.  These are so good and very addictive.  I doubled and did the 9 X 13 pan - I did have to cook my shortbread layer for almost 30 min to get it done all the way.  The tip to score and then refrigerate, then cut was great.  They came out beautifully!

HOLY COW!!!  These are amazing!  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and waited until the shortbread was cooled completely.  I did not double the recipe as suggested by some reviewers because I believed that if I used a 9 x 9 inch pan (and not a 13 x 9 as I suspect some reviewers did) it would turn out fine and it did.  The shortbread measurements were perfect for the size pan stated in the recipe.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and not milk chocolate as suggested by another reviewer to counteract some of the sweetness of the caramel center.  These are definitely a keeper!

These were a huge hit with everyone who tried them!  I got an even 3 layers and it tastes 100 times better than any twix bar!  I poked holes in the shortbread after baking, then put in the freezer for 30 min.  Then poured on caramel layer and chilled in fridge until firm and then the chocolate!  YUM!! I got 3 nice layers.Definitely a favorite!!

I was terribly disappointed with this. I wish I would have read the reviews first. The caramel was rock hard after it set for just a few minutes. You couldn't even chew it. It was more like hard candy. The shortbread tasted good, but was so crumbly you couldn't even get it out of the pan. When I tossed this, I could actually peel the caramel off in one big sheet. I don't usually have recipes bomb this bad, but this was baaaad. Great idea, but next time I might just melt some caramel candies with milk and create my own shortbread crust instead.

Definitely put in the Candy category. This is not a cookie and seems like a fat cousin of a Twix bar on steroids. It was very rich and way too sweet for us. I really liked the caramel and plan to use it for other desserts and pies.  I would also suggest using the Williams-Sonoma Scotch Shortbread recipe for those who found the "crust" to be dry and crumbling.

These are so good.  The recipe is really easy to make too, just make sure you follow directions and give yourself plenty of time.  I had 1/2 cup of sweetened condensed milk in the fridge and I have been wanting to try this recipe for the past 2 years.  I have the Allrecipes Cookbook and was going to make this using that book, but decided to check online to look at reviews.  I'm glad I did, because I noticed the online version said to boil the caramel for 5 minutes, and the cookbook said to boil for 22 minutes!!!  I only did the 5 minutes, luckily; 22 would have ruined it completely.  Mine set up perfectly, and cut perfectly, when they're not too cold.  I might try storing them out of the fridge, because they're harder to cut and eat when they're cold.  I'm glad I made these!

These were delicious. But I must agree with the other comments, that the time specified is far from the actual time it takes to prepare this recipe. My pan was 7x7, so I ended up with some extra cookie, caramel and chocolate. I decided to use these to make individual tarts. I must say that these tarts actually turned out better than the bars (mainly because I didn't have to cut them). My sister especially loved the caramel, but I'm a sucker for the flaky shortbread.

Mmmmm so good and so easy!  I have made this twice and the second time I added 1/4 tsp of salt to the caramel and used 1/4 cup less chocolate because I thought the chocolate over did the caramel.  The bit of salt also helped the caramel to stand out a bit more.  I love anything with caramel though, so if you are in it for the chocolate leave it as it is.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!  Thanks from Barb in BC Canada

These were super easy and a huge hit at christmas eve. I made then a week before and froze them until that morning, kept them in the frige until ready to serve, everyone raved over them. Will definatley make them again!   One word of advice, I did burn the first carmel layer b/c I didn't watch it closely enough, definately watch it carefully and keep stirring during this stage.

Okay, here's my take on this recipe.  First, I lined my baking dish with non-stick foil--I LOVE this and use it often.  On the advice of other reviewers, I completely chilled each layer before adding the next. I did burn my first batch of caramel, so be sure to stir that pot CONSTANTLY and cook over a very low heat. After all the layers had been added and the chocolate was cooled, I removed the whole thing from the dish and pulled off the foil. Using the foil made it very easy to remove the entire final product from the pan for cutting.  I used a pizza cutter to cut it, which worked very well, although I noticed was that it got easier to cut as I went. Next time I think I will let it get to room temperature before cutting.  The only other thing I would do differently is cut off a very narrow strip from the edges before cutting into squares.  The curve that was formed by the edge of my baking dish made the edge pieces look less uniform than the rest and would not stand up on a serving platter.  That way I also get to keep some for myself--yum! We brought these, along with other treats, as a gift when we travelled out of town to visit family.  I noticed that this treat was the only one missing from the plate that was passed around after dinner--they are just too good to share!

These are soooooooo good!!!  I made them over the holidays with fabulous results.  Everyone that tried them absolutely raved over them.  They looked great too.  My only advice is to allow enough time to let the layers cool before adding the next, especially between the shortbread and caramel.  Yum!!  I can't wait to make them again!

I thought these came out horrible!  they are definitely not 'cookies' ...more like a bar or a candy.  The chocolate did not adhere to the carmel, and the carmel was as hard as a rock.  Under the carmel was the shortbread...it seems a very odd combination of chocolate that falls off, hard carmel and shortbread.  Very awkward to eat!  Impossible to cut.

Shortbread crust was a bit bland. I boiled the caramel mix to 250(on a candy thermometer) almost hard ball stage and I liked it better. The caramel comes out chewier.I like milk chocolate better on the top, makes it taste more like a homemade TWIX.

This was so decadent and delicious. I'm not sure the caramel portion of the square turned out right but it was good just the same. I doubled the recipe as suggested by past reviewers and used a 9x13 pan, but I'm ended up with a lot of shortbread bottom and little layers of chocolate and caramel. Next time I might tweak the measurements on the shortbread so I don't end up with such a large amount. Sticking the shortbread in the freezer/fridge was definitely helpful but make sure you stick it back in the fridge after adding the caramel and leave it in there for a sufficient amount of time for the caramel to REALLY firm up before adding the warm chocolate. End product is yummy!!!

These bars are excellent! I added a little more butter to the shortbread base to avoid the crumbly consistency that some people complained about. The filling was divine and I can see myself using it in other recipes. I used white chocolate for the topping and it tasted even better than a white chocolate Twix bar!

ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!  This reminds me of the very rich wafer biscuits, with thick caramel wedged between it ( like dulce de leche ), and covered with a rich milk chocolate...that is popular in Belgium and other places like Argentina.  I did change a few things, but not much.  This recipe is an absolute winner!  Some of the changes I made :  a)  I used the ` Scottish Shortbread IV ` recipe on this site, to make the shortbread cookie, while adding a bit of salt to counteract the sweetness.  b)  I didn`t have any corn syrup, so I simply put the condensed milk on a non-stick pan, on low heat, while constantly stirring.  I then added the brown sugar and some cornstarch ( diluted a bit with water ).  It thickened up nicely and was a delicious caramel that had a buttery,  dulce de leche taste.  c) I also let the shortbread cool for a very long time ( roughly 1 hr ) and then put in the fridge for 30 mins.  Once it was really hard, I poured the caramel ( also cooled down ) and chocolate ( also cooled down ).    This recipe is so good...that it`s one of those things that you can make, pack up nicely in biscuit tins and offer to friends as a nice treat.  So good!

I love these squares - I have to limit myself to one per sitting because they are so good, it's hard to stop! I made this twice.  The first time, I did not have a candy thermometer on hand and undercooked the caramel.  It was still very yummy, but the caramel oozed when trying to cut into the squares.  The second time, I had a candy thermometer and cooked the caramel to the firm ball stage, but the mistake I made was using a little dark corn syrup - I was running low on light corn syrup.  This altered the overall flavor.  They were still good, but the taste was not as light.  Lastly, to help with the smoothness of the chocolate on top, I added 1 tbsp + 1 tsp of shortening to the chocolate chips as I melted them.  The shortening also gave the tops a nice sheen, and prevents the chocolate from cracking when cutting into it.

OH-MY-GOD! These are outrageously delicious, and yet so easy to fix! Exactly the same as a Twix bar, only waayyy better, and with the satisfaction you baked it on your own. The only problem I encountered was that the caramel did not stick enough to the crust, so next time I'll poke holes in it before and right after baking. I think I've found a new treat I'll often bake!

I love these! They come out great. Super tasty and a real crowd pleaser. I will continue making these for years to come. Sometimes when I make these I add a pinch of salt for more flavour. To avoid burning/scorching stir the caramel constantly.

It was an incredible melt-in-mouth one bite! I added a pinch of salt in the crust while mixing it and a few drops of vanilla essence. And the result was marvelous!

Absolutely amazing, and soooooo easy to make. I had EVERYONE going crazy over them and asking for the recipe. I recommend using good quality chocolate on the top (I used Belgian) it really does make all the difference. It is such an amazing treat its a shame to have cheap quality chocolate spoil it. Seriously make this, you wont regret it. I cant emphasize enough how easy it is to make. I did change the shortbread recipe as I didn't like this one as much, a good tip is to wait until the shortbread is starting to brown a little. If it isn't cooked enough it crumbles and is messy to cut.

YUM!  I halved (loaf pan), parchment, freezer 10m between layers, easy peasy.  I did have to bake the shortbread quite a bit longer.  For the chocolate I did semi-sweet with coconut oil in micro, this always works beautifully.  Next time I will double the caramel layer though.  I also added a touch of cinnamon and also salt to the caramel and will do that again next time.  Or I'll sprinkle the top with sea salt...

A very tempting idea, but the chocolate on top melts all over your fingers and it's tricky getting the caramel exactly right.  I followed the directions exactly and my caramel got too hard.  I wish I'd used my candy thermometer, rather than the directions.  The bottom layer was quite thick, too, and it crumbled a lot.  Again, great idea, but it just wasn't a good result.

This is ridiculously amazing (IT REALLY IS), and easy. Read all the comments but stuck to the recipe, though I cooled at the shortbread stage, and at the caramel stage before spreading chocolate. I think if you are going to TOTALLY cool in between stages, at least SERVE at room temperature to ensure the layers don't separate when you bite into one. I think I just gained ten pounds and STILL I am making more. Thanks for making me fat!!!!

Amazing.  I read many of the previous reviews and made some changes.  I doubled the recipe.  Baked the crust in a buttered and floured 9x13 baking dish for 20 minutes.  Made the caramel as directed but heated it to 200 degrees, stirring constantly.  It was closer to 7 minutes than the recommended 5.  I waited until the shortbread was cool as recommended by many reviewers, before pouring the caramel over it.  I tried the milk chocolate topping as directed, but it siezed up.  Everything was dry, so I can't tell you what went wrong.  I did not want to ruin another 2 1/2 cups of chocolate, so I went with a ganache topping.  I used 2/3 cup cream heated for 1 minutes in the microwave. Poured it over 2 1/2 cups mini semi sweet morsels.  Stirred until smooth and then poured it over the caramel.  I topped the chocolate with pecans and refrigerated. We just sliced into them and they look exactly like the picture and are a wonderful mix of delicate shortbread, rich caramel and creamy chocolate.  What a treat!  I usually make the recipe as written first, but following the suggestions of the others really turned this into a wonderful cookie.  Thanks EVERYONE!  We will make these again and again.

These are very good. I must say, though, I didn't think they tasted anything like a Twix bar. My shortbread was very soft and almost crumbly. I think next time I would bake it a little longer. I mixed a little heavy cream in with my chocolate chips when I melted them (I used milk chocolate, by the way). I cooled each layer before adding the next, and had no trouble with adhesion.

Extremely easy, and the taste is very good although extremely rich.  Definitely give yourself enough time in between steps.  I cooked the shortbread last night and let it cool, then made the caramel this evening and let it firm up, then did the chocolate.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips bc I don't have milk chocolate, and it probably cut the sweetness a bit, which was good.  I chilled after putting on the chocolate, but the chocolate layer broke up quite a bit so I wouldn't do that next time--I'd just let it harden at room temp and see if that makes a difference.  The other layers were fine, though.  This was easiest to cut with a pizza cutter for me.  I used parchment paper, which worked like a dream for getting the squares out of the pan.  I cut into squares then triangles for visual interest.  Thanks for the recipe!

So good, so easy, so beautiful.  I received many compliments on these!  I used a 9x9 pyrex pan.  Next time I will double the batch and use a 9x13 lined with foil.  YUM!!

This is so yummy. I can only make it when I have to take goodies somewhere because I eat too much of it. I used another reviewers advice and doubled the recipe for a 9x13, and instead of straight chocolate for the topping - 2 c. semi-sweet choc chips and 1 can of sweetened condensed milk. I also used my handheld beaters to beat the caramel for a couple of minutes. 1 can of sweeneted condensed milk is 1 cup. So if you make a batch just melt the rest of the milk with 1 cup choc chips for the topping.

These are wonderful. I followed all the other advice...doubled the recipe in a 9 x 13; poked holes in the crust before and after baking; chilled the layers between baking. I got the three separate layers just like in the photo. The shortbread is especially delicious!

These are very yummy!  The rows around the edges are hard to get out without the shortbread crust turning into crumbs.  Just throw away that part.  You should be able to lift the rest out of the pan all in one piece and lay it on a cutting board.  Use a sharp knife to cut the reast in to (approx) 1" pices.  Yum-yum!

I am an avid baker. I read through the recipe several times as well as through reviews for tips and tricks. I followed the recipe to a T and I don't know what went wrong. My short bread is crumbling to pieces. I can't get any size square (small or large) to stay in tact. Also, my caramel is hard as a rock! You could chip a tooth on it! I wanted to love this recipe as others did but this is a BIG miss for me!

Holy moly this was good! Yes, was. The first batch was exactly according to the recipe, and was a bit flat. Bland. I made a second, and sprinkled coarse sea salt over the caramel layer once it had cooled, and it added such nice depth and layers of flavour! So good. For the second batch I sped up the cooling steps by placing the pan outside in the BBQ (it's 10 below right now). A freezer would work just as well, but mine's full.

Loved by everyone!  I was looking to imitate Millionaire Bars we had with tea in London.  These exceeded my expectations. Watch the caramel and stir often, reducing heat so it is just boiling.  I don't melt the chocolate.  I pour the caramel on the hot shortbread and lay unwrapped Hershey bars on top of the hot caramel, let them sit a few minutes, then spread(my mom's trick from making toffee-  if it doesn't melt enough, pop it into the still warm oven for a minute). The hardest part is waiting for the chocolate to set!  Then I sit back with a cup of tea and remember a fabulous family adventure.

These were very easy to make. I lined my pan with parchment paper which made it super easy to get them out. The only problem I had, and I think it was my error was having a hard time getting the chocolate to melt to the perfect consistency to spread over the caramel! Other than that these little jewels tasted great!

I've been making these for many years and I definitely agree with the other reviewers about letting the shortbread completely cool before adding the caramel and then letting that completely cool before adding the chocolate.  It can turn into a mess otherwise!  I prefer them in a 9 x 13 pan just because they're so rich but they are extremely good!

the caramel was rock hard, turned to crumbs when I tried to cut it into pieces, flipped it over and cut from the bottom at least I could get "squares" tasted awesome but my son's friend lost a tooth on the caramel, think I will play with the caramel portion to see if I an get a better result, very disappointing.

Love these!  I modified this a tiny bit - I added salted cashews to the caramel layer and cut the chocolate by at least half.  I drizzled the chocolate over the caramel/nut layer.  These make it SO hard to stick to my diet cuz they are THAT good!  Nice addition to my Christmas cookie tray and will use again next year.

I followed the modifications outlined in some of the other reviews. Using parchment was probably THE best helpful hint.   I cooled in between every stage and they turned out wonderfully!  The only problem I have is getting my fiancée to stop eating them before dinner!

These are really delicious, and pretty easy. The only thing I might try next time is adding a pinch of salt to the shortbread dough. I think that would help bring out the flavors in the whole cookie.

Wow! So good. I made them for a youth function and all of the British kids said that it tasted just like what they were used eating in the UK. Apparently, it's a classic British sweet.

I doubled the amount of caramel that went into this recipe.  I also used dark chocolate for the top layer and cut back the amount until it just covered the top.  I also froze the shortbread layer before adding the caramel.  Came out wonderfully, everyone loved them!

These were good and I did get requests for the recipe. Will probably make again in the future. I didn't watch the caramel closely enough and ended up scorching it (wasn't clear on whether or not I should be stirring it while boiling). So... they were "Burnt Caramel" Shortbread Squares. Still tasted good though!

I lined the pan with parchment paper and they came out very easily.  I wish I had read the suggestions to chill each layer before adding the next one, because my caramel and chocolate ended up melting together.
They still tasted great, though...it's a recipe that I will definitely make again!

These are really delicate, rich squares.  They held together fine, I used the suggestion of others and poked fork holes in my crust before baking.  My only criticism would be that the crust to caramel ratio is a little off.  The shortbread crust almost other takes the soft caramel center.  I would make these again though and just not use all the crust mix for this recipe, just use some of it for a few cookies instead.

I lined my 8X8 pan with Reynolds easy release foil, pricked the crust once it was done baking, let it cool completely, using a candy thermometer I brought the caramel mixture to a soft ball stage (240 degrees), let that get to room temp.  melted SEMI SWEET chocolate and poured that over the caramel layer.  When the chocolate was about 1/2 way set I scored it with a knife where I would be making my cuts for serving - this made it easy to cut once the chocolate had hardened.  These are VERY rich & VERY good!

These are the best!  My only complaint is minor.  The shortbread crust is a bit crumbly, but they are delicious!

Also, just a suggestion for the reviewers having a hard time with the caramel layer: cook it as the directions say, then take a spoonful of the caramel mixture and drop into a glass of cold water.  It should be at the "soft ball" stage, so it should hold its shape when cool.  If you cook it too long, you'll get toffee out of it (the "hard crack" stage), and if you don't cook it enough, it will be soupy.  You'll know when it's at the consistency you want--I don't own a candy thermometer because this method never fails :-)

** Tip, cook the caramel to 245 deg F instead of trying to time it.  That is the normal way to make caramel.  This was good and I will try it again, but I had a problem with the shortbread part crumbling.  I would not recommend doubling this until you have tried it once.  This makes a lot of 1 inch squares.  Also, I found this does not last long (not more than 5 days) before the cookies develop a grainy texture.  I used semi-sweet because that is what I had in the pantry.

These were really delicious!  I ended up over-cooking my first two batches of caramel because I cooked over high heat.  The key is to cook over very low heat, as others recommend, and stir constantly.  I used milk chocolate for the top and it really did taste very similar to a Twix bar.  I also followed the suggestions to poke holes in the crust and cool it before putting the caramel layer on.  It worked great!

This recipe I thought was ok.My fam really liked it. I also made these changes I used brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup and also I used dark chocolate chips. My shortbread didn't crumble neary at all, because I lined the pan with parchment paper.

These were wonderful little treats. I have to agree that they are very rich, but it's worth every bite. They did somewhat remind me of a twix bar. The shortbread part was softer than a twix bar but oh so good! I stuck my bars in the fridge so I had no problem with a crumbly crust. I will definitely make these again.

These were so good.  I wish the carmel layer was thicker.  The only thing i didnt like too much was after sitting for a day or two (if they last that long again..LOL) the shortbread layer got very very crumbly.  But who cares, eat them over the counter because they are soooo good.  The caramel is creamy, and the chocolate (i used milk choc) was smoothe.  So delish!  But seriously, cut them tiny (they are RICH) and grease  your dish WELL, or line with parchment paper.  And the beating of the caramel is a must!

Wow!  I doubled the recipe, lined the pan with foil, and added a few tablespoons of cream to the chocolate (easier to cut that way)and they were wonderful!  I've never made caramel before, and didn't stir it after it came to a boil (like for fudge), and it did seem to burn (didn't taste burned...just looked dark on the bottom)...next time I will stir while boiling... and there will certainly be a next time! These are a new family favorite...thanks for the recipe.

Y.U.M. One suggestion I would make is to double the caramel ingredients. I followed the receipe  exactly and my caramel layer was paper thin. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but it would have been nicer to have a thicker middle layer. Make sure you grease/flour your baking pan well - I did both and the crust still cemented itself onto the pan. I have to eat it directly out of it... not that I mind...

AMAZING RECIPE!  My bars came out perfect!  All the layers stayed together and cut beautifully.  I added 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans to the shortbread crust before baking, and when I spread the chocolate on top, I sprinkled toffee pieces on top.  They were so good!  Next time, I'm going to try sprinkling chopped up snickers bar on the chocolate.

Ok, this was very very good, but I really thought the amounts were off. There was no way that the 9" square pan I used was going to be adequately covered by the stated shortbread recipe. I made up another batch, and used 2/3 of it to fully cover the pan base. I boiled the caramel mix for about 4 mins, spread it on top of the shortbread, then put it in the fridge for 10 mins. I zapped the choc chips in the mic for about 4 mins, then spread them over the top with the back of a spoon. Then it went back into the fridge for 20 mins, until the choc had hardened. This is a bit of a fussy recipe, but it really does taste like a Twix. There's no way I'll make it again, but I'm glad I tried it once. Thanks, Julia!

After reading all the reviews, I made these changes:
I greased and floured the pan, poked holes in the raw crust, cooked the crust a bit longer than the recipe says to and then let it cool. I slightly shortened the cooking time on the caramel mixture. I also decided to try sprinkling the chocolate chips directly on the warm caramel layer. I covered the pan to help them melt, then I spread the chocolate with the back of a spoon. I also added some chopped pecans over the chocolate. I loved it with nuts! The end result was a rich and delicious cookie/candy. I had a hard time not eating more than my share.

Very tasty and I will definitely try these again. HOWEVER I should have read the online reviews for helpful hints first. Instead I used my allrecipes cookbook instead of the online site this particular time. I would do some things differently next time... grease and flour dish (most squares broke when trying to remove), add a bit more milk to soften the caramel and  scoring prior to allowing to cool down completely would have been a real time and effort saver (nearly pulled a muscle trying to cut through). They were tasty and worth trying again to see if I can do better the second time around.

YUM YUM YUM!! I always make a double batch of these because they disappear so fast. Print out a few extra copies of the recipe because people always ask for it! 
A few things I've discovered:
The chocolate is hard to spread when you melt it in a pan. I don't have a double boiler, so instead I add extra milk as it melts to make it pourable. 
I was in a rush one day and could not let the caramel cool, so I poured the chocolate on while it was still soft. It turn out great because i swirled the two together!

I read all the reviews before attempting to make this square... and it was worth it!  Definately grease AND flour the pan before starting (makes them just pop out without falling apart), definately cut the squares before the chocolate is too hard, and even take them out of the pan, so the caramel doesn't "rebond" with it's sidemates, and most of all DEFINATELY cut them small.. wow, are they ever rich!  They were so incredibly easy to make - I will most certainly be making these again the next time I have a "pot-luck" dessert to bring!  Thanks!

Did I do something wrong with these?????  The caramel layer didn't stick to the shortbread layer.  The taste was AMAZING but we had to eat it right out of the pan!  They were a little hard to cut as well.

UPDATE****  So it took me 8 years to try this recipe again and I'm glad I did.  I read through the reviews and made the following changes...

1.  baked these in a mini muffin pan.  Cooked the shortbread for 8 minutes instead of 20.  Crust came out beautifully! No crumbly crust and no fuss to cut them...they look FANTASTIC!!
2.  Definately stir the caramel for 5 minutes over a LOW boil.  This truly makes all the difference in the world!  I also still stirred the caramel for 3 minutes after removing it fromt the heat.   You need to work quickly to get the caramel in the mini muffin cups as it hardens quickly. 
3.  Refrigerate after each step...this helps in keeping them together. 
4.  I doubled the caramel layer to get 36 mini muffin size treats of these....

Made a platter of four different baked goods for my office party and these were the favorites by far!  They disappeared in less than an hour and I made two batches!!  Very easy to make but keep an eye on the caramel; make sure the brown sugar is evenly blended into the mix before it comes to boil.

They were great; the 2nd time I tried it. Do NOT let the caramel boil for five minutes. If you do, you will have a solid hunk of burnt caramel.

Brought these to the office Christmas party and was EXTREMELY popular. My adjustments: Doubled the recipe and used a 9x13" pan; lined the pan with parchment; made the caramel by cooking on low heat, stirring continuously, then once everything was thoroughly mixed, brought to a  boil for about 5 minutes while continuing to stir; put the pan in the freezer for a bit before and after the caramel; used dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate and added about 2TB of butter while melting; and shook just a little sea salt over the top of the chocolate before it hardened.

My only regret is that the shortbread was EXTREMELY crumbly, which could have been from overmixing, or from not patting it down tightly enough, or from the fact that I didn't poke holes in the top, as suggested by others.

But I will DEFINITELY make this again, and refine as I go.

Kristin's Nov 18, 2008 notes were helpful (double recipe; parchment paper; bring to a boil on low heat, stirring constantly; cool cookie and don't add caramel while very hot; use warm/hot knife to cut). That said; shortbread is very crumbly. Next time I'll try the crust I use for lemon bars which has a different proportion butter/flour and uses powdered sugar. Its more of a buttery/rich recipe than sweet.

These are really easy, but you MUST allow time between each step for that layer to cool completely.   SUPER sweet even using semi-sweet chocolate, so cut them small.    I sprinkled sea salt on top of the chocolate before it set up, so mine were salted caramel shortbread bars.   People LOVED them!  And me too!

I tried this recipe as written and it is delicious. I have a similar recipe that I have used for years which is easier. I use same ingredients. Place shortbread crust in pan, cook carmel portion on top of stove making sure that you stir and not burn on low to medium heat. When it thickens, pour on top of uncooked crust (chopped walnuts optional if you want to add to top of crust before adding carmel mixture). Bake like recipe calls for. After it bakes, add chocolate chips on top of crust and put back in oven for 2-3 minutes until chocolate softens. Remove from oven and spread chocolate. Wait until cools, cut into bars and then place in fridge so chocolate hardens. Ready to serve!

Boiling the caramel is essential to achieve the slightly bitter flavor of real caramel. Otherwise you're just making a layer of sweet brown sugar. I would suggest using low heat to allow the step 3 ingredients to combine evenly, then boil for the recommended time. Also, I used bittersweet chocolate for a richer flavor.

I just made these and they were fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly. Some people were saying to freeze the shortbread before putting the caramel on top. I found that I put my shortbread in the fridge for about 3 minutes and I have zero problems. I think people may be forgetting that the directions say to stir the caramel vigorously for 3 minutes after removed from heat. Letting the caramel thicken a bit before putting it in the dish is important.  The only thing I will do different next time will be to line the dish with parchment paper so the caramel doesn't stick to the dish. Also, I used semi sweet chips because that is what I have on hand. Really loved this and will be making again and again.

Fantastic recipe! I've made it a few times in different kitchens, and it is really forgiving. If you aren't in the U.S. this is also one of those rare recipes that doesn't really mind foreign ingredients. No corn syrup? No problem. Different grind of flour? Just make sure the dough feels crumbly but sticks together when pressed. No condensed milk? Boil regular milk with a few spoonfuls of butter - not the same, but it worked. 

This is also a really flexible base recipe. In the future I may make this with ginger and cardamom in the shortbread and white chocolate on top sprinkled with candied ginger. I'm sure this would be amazing with a rum caramel too.

Do NOT use a double boiler for the caramel - it doesn't get hot enough. Stay with your pan, stir often, and pay attention.

I made these for a family cookie exchange and they tasted awesome! My mistake was my butter was still half froze so I put it in the micro for a few seconds. Big mistake! So the crust was crumbly and had air pockets. I did follow the other suggestions to poke the crust with a fork after cooking, added a Tbl spoon of butter to the chocolate, doubled in a foil lined 9 x 13 and cool in freezer 10 min before pouring on the carmel.Great suggestions. Also I only had 2 cups of chocolate chips so I subed a 1/2 cup of mint filled dark chocolate baking chips. Tasted great and I'll do that again.

I tried this recipe for a family get together and it was a huge success! Everyone loved it! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out so well....I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews!! The shortbread was good and the caramel chewy. It cut nicely into bars. I did put it in the fridge to harden the chocolate (for a half hour) because I was running out of time. Already been asked to make it again. :)

These were so rich and yummy. My family loved them! I used milk chocolate bark on top and swirled it with white chocolate. Make sure you mix all the caramel ingredients together before you even turn on the stove top... I had all my ingredients sitting in the pot on the burner (unmixed), and the brown sugar burned on the bottom of the pan. There were brown chunks of the sugar when I was mixing, but it still turned out fine. I used an 8" glass pan, greased an floured it, and baked the shortbread for 22 mins. This recipe was relatively quick, and really didn't require many ingredients, so I'll be making these bars again!  
Thanks for the recipe!

My rating is only for the shortbread base, since that's all I used. I rolled it into balls, indented, and baked in order to fill with a different caramel filling. The texture is WONDERFUL - nice and tender. I love it. But I'm not surprised to see so many reviews pointing out problems with the crust disintegrating during cutting. It worked great in cookie form, though!

I shouldn't have made these!  Because I can't stop eating them.  Even my friend called and said she was thinking about them the next day.  I did do as some other reviewers did and put the pan in the freezer between steps.  As soon as the shortbread was done I put it in the freezer while I made the caramel; it worked great.  Then I put the pan back in the freezer while I melted the chocolate.  I used semi-sweet chocolate and did add some vanilla and half-n-half.  I put it in the fridge to set up.  It was hard to get out of the pan so next time I will use foil or butter the pan to make it easier to remove.  I left it out overnight and it is easier to cut today because it softened up.  It taste just as good today as it did yesterday.  I will be making these A LOT!  Thank you, Julia, for an awesome receipe!

While good in concept, this recipe didn't quite work out for me. I read the reviews and followed their advice, but the cookie came out extremely crumbly and would not hold together. Part of the problem was the force needed to cut the caramel, even with a heated knife, crushed the delicate shortbread. I only managed 3 cuts per heating before the knife destroyed the cookie with the force needed, and even the ones that cut would fall apart half the time when I picked them up to transfer to the tray. 

I might try this again with a different cookie recipe, one that is a little less delicate, because the caramel came out very good, and I bet it would have worked out well if the base had held together.

These taste just like Twix chocolate bars. Yum. I followed others' suggestions of doubling ingredients (except the chocolate chips on top - it doesnt need it) and the freezing, chilling etc. They turned out perfect. I couldnt just stop eating them.
Probably one of the best squares I've made.

I LOVE these! I used dark chocolate thinned with butter as someone suggested. I tried the double batch in a 9x13 but was confused about the baking time (I'm new to baking time). I thought they were way to rich and I love RICH. I made another batch following the directions except for the dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate. They came out perfect! Definitely put in the freezer between steps but don't let the chocolate get solid. I did that and when I tried to cut it it create a crack across the top. I turned the oven on for a few minutes and turned it off to soften the chocolate so I could finish cutting it. Oh and lining the pan with foil was a great suggestion! I just lifted it onto a cutting board. I'm new to baking so reading the reviews really help!

THE BEST TREAT I EVER ATE
Seriously- as I mae the caramel - that is before my arm fell off from stirring so much, I could not believe how incredible the flavour of the caramel was.
Thank you for sharing here. This is  officially my new favourite recipe, hands down!
I followed everyones tweaks too incl. cooling the shortbread and was beyond delighted with the results!!

Excellent says it all!  Make as written, no changes necessary.  The crust balances the sweetness of the caramel.

Just remember to stir the caramel mixture while it's boiling, and not over too high a heat, or it can burn!  Otherwise, yummy!

These were perfect! Even my daughter, who never eats desserts liked them. My hubby went nuts. When I put the caramel on I stuck them in the fridge because I was short on time. I tried my hardest to wait for the chocolate to harden. They were a bit gooey when we first tried them and I thought they was too much chocolate. Once they chilled completely (I kept them in the fridge) they were evenly flavored. YUM!

These were really good.  The caramel tastes a little funny on its own, but in the bar it was rich and tasty.  My chocoalte chips were melting a little grainy so I added some butter and cream which made it into a soft ganache layer instead of a harder chocolate layer.

These tasted SOOO delicious.  However, I had problems with the shortbread layer being too crumbly.  I tried several suggestions but they didn't seem to fix things.  This didn't hurt the taste in any way.  For presentation reasons, next time I'll try a different shortbread recipe.

tasted just like homemade twix bars!! very sweet, but definitely worth making! I didn't have milk choc chips so instead I mixed dark choc chips and semi-sweet chips. Very good! Make sure you have some milk to drink with it!

These are a sinfully delicious and very rich.  I followed Kirsten's advise to the letter and the shortbread squares turned out perfectly.  I'm so glad I doubled the recipe.  They were the perfect addition to my Christmas Cookie Platters that I sent out to all my friends!!

I make cookies for Christmas every year (about 12 different kinds) and last year I added this one to my collection. Everyone loves it! I've been trying to be more efficient with my cookie making so this year I doubled the recipe and made it in a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper. After I assembled the cookie, I stick it into the refridgerator to completely cool. Once cooled, I remove the "cookie" from the pan by lifting up the parchment paper and place on a large cutting board and cut with a large kitchen knife. They come out perfectly. If they start to melt a bit while cutting, just place back into the refridgerator to cool. Love this cookie!

Love these!  The carmel is a little work (be sure to stir constantly to keep from burning) but well worth it. I also refrigerated the crust about 15 minutes before pouring the carmel  on top.  And refrigerated after the carmel layer until set and then melted the chocolate in the microwave and spread on top of the set carmel. Can't wait to serve these on my Christmas cookie trays this year. Very good!  Thanks for the recipe.

These taste like eating a twix bar.  They're time consuming to make but worth the effort.  I didn't have any milk chocolate chips so I melted some dark chocolate kisses and love the way it tastes with the dark chocolate.

These are delicious and pretty easy to make.  I made 1 1/2 recipes of the shortbread and used the same amout of caramel in a 9 x 13 in. pan. I didn't want too much caramel.   Use a sheet of plastic wrap to help press the dough in the pan.   I placed 6 broken "Hershey" bars on the hot caramel and waited for them to melt and spread with an ofset spatula.   They taste like a "Twix" candy bar!

Very good recipe.  Just a couple of tips to help make them a little easier.  Definitely line the pan with foil for easy cutting.  Also - there is no way you can spread the chocolate without adding something.  I had to add 4 Tbsp. butter to get it thin enough to spread.  I used 1 cup of semi-sweet choc. chips and 1/4 cup milk choc. chips.

This recipe is wonderfull!!! I added some butter to my chocolate chips which worked great for spreading. Instead of a square or rectangle pan I used my mini muffin tray. I doubled the carmel and came out with 6 dozen equal sized treats without having to cut anything! I did put my pan in the freezer in between layers which worked great. I will recommend this recipe to all my friends. Thank you!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  I used golden syrup in place of the corn syrup as I didn't have any.  When I was boiling the caramel it burnt really bad on the bottom (this could've been due to having a gas stove), so I will watch it more closely next time and put it on a lower heat.  But I do have to say the slightly burnt taste was actually really good!! I might try putting a dab of the condensed milk mixed in with the chocolate so its not so hard on the top of the squares next time.  Also.....the squares in the photo must've been a double batch of the caramel and chocolate or something because My layers were very small and I used a 9x9 pan.  Next time I might try to double just the caramel part (makes sense too because 1/2 a cup is about half a can of condensed milk, so you might as well use the whole can!).  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Just an update on these because i've made them a couple of times now........the caramel actually tastes A LOT better if you slighty burn it.  Also, you need to keep them in the fridge otherwise they will start to go off within a couple of days. :)

The shortbread was really good, but I added a tsp. of vanilla and a couple tablespoons of sour cream.  I doubled the caramel portion, because we love caramel.  My chocolate didn't set very well, and kind of seperated overnight.  I refrigerated the shortbread before adding the caramel and then refrigerated again before adding the chocolate and had no problems with cutting the bars.

Totally delish. It does make 40 small squares, but bet you can't eat just one. I used dark chocolate chips (with milk to get right consistency) instead of milk and they were fab. Left plenty of time to cool between layers and scored the chocolate to ensure they wouldn't be too hard to cut. Didn't have any issues with crust being crumbly. As others noted, make sure you cook the caramel on very low heat or it will scorch.

We made these for our Christmas Gift Trays. My 9 yr son made the caramel..it turned out perfect! These are so easy to make, and taste so good! Plus, the squares look great, and look like they took quite a while to make. We put the squares in Christmas cupcake liners and topped with Christmas Tree topped toothpicks. These are now on our yearly Christmas goody list:) Thanks for sharing!

Really good! Next time I'll do what other reviewers had suggested and spread the shortbread mixture in a 9'' by 13'' pan and double the caramel/chocolate.

Outstanding!!!! Made these for the first time yesterday. They are so good, it's scary. I cooked my shortbread in a foil lined pan, cooled then added the caramel topping and cooled. When fully chilled, I removed from pan, cut into pieces then poured melted chocolate on top of them. I have bad luck cutting chocolate when cooled, and this method was great.

This was easy.  I placed the shortbread in the freezer to cool and then added the caramel.  Then cooled the caramel layer in the freezer.  Then melted chocolate on top and then chilled that in the freezer.  It was excellent and reminded me of a twix bar.  Will make again.

Amazing recipe! I lined the pan with foil and doubled the recipe.  They cut beautifully just as the chocolate had hardened.  A very special cookie.

when boiling the caramel, make sure it is a slow boil.  Otherwise it hardens to more of a toffee and it's impossible to cut!

Awesome recipe! I changed the serving amount, as I was serving a larger crowd and doubled the recipe. I received compliment after compliment about these cookies. I didn't change any of the ingredients, but after the first step, I froze the cookie, then after making the caramel, I returned the pan to the freezer, then I melted the chocolate in a double boiler, added to the layered cookie and returned to the freezer. WONDERFUL recipe, and by the way the caramel in this recipe is perfect; it is as sweet as a candy shoppe's caramel.

This recipe has a great concept of being topped by caramel and chocolate. Unfortunately, the shortbread themselves fell short of expectations and were extremely bland. I might try it again with a different shortbread recipe, most of which require the addition of vanilla and different sugar (brown sugar or confection). Maybe the submitter was concerned with sugar overdose, but I really feel that the shortbread needs more flavor. Thanks for the submission.

Absolutely heavenly! Very quick and easy recipe.   You may need to dip your hands in flour when pressing the dough into the pan. Bake crust just until light brown around the edges, don't overbake. Crust will be tender, this isn't a problem if you use a spatula to serve cooled bars. I used the full can of sweetened condensed milk, an initial error on my part, but it probably gave the caramel a more intense flavor and a softer consistency that allowed it to be spread over the crust easier. Caramel sauce was cooked over medium heat, stirring often before boil and continuously while in the boiling stage.  My crust was hot when I poured the still hot caramel sauce, no problems. As I normally do for chocolate chips, I melted them in the microwave, about two minutes. Much easier and less time consuming. I gently topped the melted chocolate with just a little bit of the caramel (about 2-3 tablespoons) and then marbelized. Gorgeous! You may want to refrigerate after topping with the chocolate to help the chocolate set quicker. Make sure to cut bars before it sets too hard, or let chocolate soften before cutting. Keep squares small, they are very rich. Pecans would make a wonderful addition to the caramel sauce. Great recipe for company.

This recipe is good, but not great.  I used many of the other reviewers suggestions such as, doubling the recipe and using a jelly roll pan, poking holes in the shortbread to help the shortbread and caramel layers stay together and finally, adding a bit of shortening to the chocolate to add a bit of elasticity.  That being said, they looked pretty, but were also somewhat bland?  Very sweet also.  I thought of the other reviewers who overcooked their caramel giving it a burnt flavor and thought that may be the key.  Perhaps I needed to develop the flavor of my caramel a little more.

These are very good.  Definitely use the parchment paper, and cool between the addition of each layer.  Make ganache from the chocolate chips by adding some heavy cream and the chocolate becomes more spreadable and won't separate from the caramel. Beyond that my only addition was some toasted chopped pecans to the top...I felt like it needed some crunch.

These are fantastic.  If you want the caramel centre to be as thick as in the picture I had to double the filling.  If you line the parchment paper there's no need to grease and flour and the whole block of squares comes out in one piece for easy cutting.

Fantastic!I loved it and it really reminded me of homemade twix!!
I'm not sure why, but I had a little problem with melting the chocolate chips (which has never happened before!!)...but I rescued the chocolate by pouring about 2 tablespoons of milk into it after which the chocolate melted beautifully and smoothed out completely!
Also, I'd like to remind everyone to grease and flour their pan before baking the shortbread so that you don't have a problem removing the squares from the pan later.
Unlike many others my caramel, chocolate and shortbread stayed together.
Freezing between the layers helps immensely. 
Oh and yea, I didn't have any corn syrup at home, so I used honey instead, and it turned out perfectly with a more pronounced caramel taste!
Thanks Julia!

I love these cookies! They remind me of a Twix candy bar, which is one of my favorites! One thing I do differently is melt 1/4 cup of white chocolate chips, pipe it in stripes on top of the semisweet chocolate, and use a skewer to swirl the chocolate. It looks beautiful, and is so easy to do! These cookies also won a second place ribbon at the state fair, and there were about 20 entries in the contest! You must try this recipe!

Okay, so I followed the recipe and read the reviews after.. Oops. For starters, I pressed the shortbread into a square pan, lined with parchment paper. I baked it for about 5-6 minutes. It had a touch of golden brown on the outer edges. I did not poke the shortbread at all. Meanwhile I cooked the caramel mixture on the stove. I had the temp. at medium. It came to a boil and I did not touch it. That's my assumption from reading the recipe. After only 3 minutes I stirred the mixture. It started to darken, but not burn. I immediately took the mixture off the burner and began stirring for 3 minutes. I then took the shortbread from the oven, and poured the hot caramel over it. I placed the squares in the freezer for an hour. Once the caramel was hard I took them out of the freezer and removed the parchment paper. I didn't have any chocolate chips so I used some hot fudge sauce I had in the fridge. No, it won't harden, but that's okay, I'm keeping them in the fridge. I did taste them, and the cookie was a little crumbly, not it was not a huge mess like others suggested. The caramel was so soft and delicious. The hot fudge complemented the not so sweet cookie wonderfully. I just might make this caramel again only as a sauce for ice cream. Yum!

I had issues with this recipe because my caramel wanted to burn in my pan.  I was able to salvage it and the end result was ok.  I may need a heavier saucepan to try again.  I found the shortbread fine as I had my butter very soft when I mixed the flour and sugar in.

This is so good it has to be evil.
BUT MAKE SURE YOU DON'T OVER REDUCE THE CARAMEL! I did and by god they were to sickly too eat. It needs to be still runny, runny enough to *pour* over the shortbread. I recommend waiting for shortbread to cool completely, then refrigerating overnight to enable the  caramel to cool very quickly when you pour it on, (so it doesn't soak through the shortbread and make a big sticky flop). My second batch was heaven. I also used 5ml of natural caramel essence to the caramel before reducing. It was heavenly.

These were a bit time consuming to make, but they were delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The shortbread was a bit crumbly, but I didn't mind.  Also, when I was cutting the squares, the chocolate wanted to lift away from the carmel.  But they were fine at room temperature.  I almost prefer them at room temperature, and they do sort of taste like a Twix bar.  :)

You must cut these into bars BEFORE the chocolate cools!  I made the mistake of pouring the chocolate layer and then putting them in the fridge overnight to cool.  Bad.  When I went to cut them the next morning, the chocolate broke into big bark-like shards and buckled off the rest of the cookie.

OMG, these were sooo good!  I made a double batch and my hubby and I both took them to work, where they disappeared in seconds.  I had to make another batch a couple of weeks later because of so many requests...  Very easy to make, and I found the recipe easy to follow.  I doubled the recipe but only used the original amount of chocolate chips and used dark chips to tone down the sweetness.  I started to cook the caramel layer while the cookie layer was cooling and didn't have any problems at all. These would make a great addition to any Christmas cookie exchange.

Caramel Shortbread or "Millionaire's shortbread' as it's also known as can be finicky to make, but only because although it is a very simple recipe it takes a lot more time than specified. This is the only reason why I didn't give this recipe 5 stars.

It's so important for each layer to be chilled (I learned this lesson when making nanaimo bars for Canada day) - refrigerate or chill for at least 20 minutes, and wait until each layer is just about ready before preparing the next layer - or else spooning the mixture is a bit of a nuisance as it sticks to utensils and hardens very fast. 

I used my hands to pick at the dough (as you would with apple crumble - but before it gets to a breadcrumb texture) to ensure that the dough was of the right consistency. Shortbread is traditionally 1 part sugar, 2 parts butter, and 3 parts flour and this recipe catered very well to that.

I didn't have corn syrup so I substituted  golden syrup instead, and I used semi-sweet chocolate with a double boiler mostly out of habit - I find it gives you more control.

I also used a 9x13inch pan as I don't like my layers too thick, which I floured in advance.

The husband and I gorged on these, thank you so much for sharing!!!

Oh boy these were decadent!  Not a good thing to keep around the house if you're watching calories.  I cut mine up into small pieces and stored them in the freezer.  These are just like twix bars, but BETTER!

Excellent!!
It tastes exactly like a twix bar.
I melted about 1/2 a cup of extra white chocolate, with a spoon I dropped it on the brown chocolate, and went through it with a skewer to get a marbled effect. Great! Oh and I forgot to beat the caramel....but it turned out very well....

I just made these and they turned out great.  I was thinking about making these for a graduation party next month, but wanted to try a test run since other people seemed to have problems with them. I thought they were actually very easy after reading some of the suggestions posted. I poked holes with a fork into the shortbread so that the caramel layer would stick and I cooled each layer before adding the next. Besides that I followed the recipe exactly. I know some people didn't like the shortbread layer but it really goes great with the other     
layers and cuts down on the sweetness. I can't wait to make this for my party!

Wonderful!!  The recipe was easy to follow, but I'll have a sore arm tomorrow after stirring the carmel! Absolutely follow the carmel instructions to a T or it will not turn out. It's worth the effort for the great flavor.  Each layer came out perfectly since I cooled each one before adding the next.  A 2-bite square is just the right size for such a rich treat, but it's my new favorite!!  Thank you so much.

I made these with King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour.  I really kept an eye on the caramel while it was cooking, thanks to another reviewer.  It really did need constant stirring.  I let the shortbread completely cool before adding the caramel layer, and then put it in the fridge for about ten minutes before adding the chocolate topping.  I would have preferred a semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, but that could just be personal preference; I was reminded in tasting these that I am not a milk chocolate fan. I put them in the fridge for another ten minutes to harden the chocolate just a bit before cutting.  I had no trouble with crumbling of the shortbread.  These are very rich, so should be cut small.  They are perfect when you just want a little sweet with a cup of tea.

I recommend making a bit more shortbread as I found the layer was too thin and crumbled easily.

Excellent!!!! I only messed with the chocolate topping. I did not use milk chocolate chips-I used two cups semi-sweet chips with one can sweetened condensed milk that you microwave for one minute, mix well, pour over and let set. I got rave reviews and numerous request for thr recipe. Many felt it tasted like a twix bar. I forgot to say I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 pan, so my chocolate topping is for the 9x13 size pan.

Oh so good!  I had no trouble cutting them, nor did the layers separate as others have said.  I did take another reviewer's advice to line the pan with foil for easy liftout and cutting.  I wish I had doubled the recipe, both because I like them and they're going fast, but also because I'm not sure to do with the rest of the can of condensed milk. I'm thinking about trying them with just the caramel and chocolate layers for a quick and easy approximation of chocolate covered caramels.

These are so addictive. I think that I will double the carmel layer next time as mine was very thin. I also had problems with the carmel layer sticking to the shortbread layer, but I didn't even care once I ate them.

These were okay.  I took others advice and pricked the shortbread after baking and chilled in freezer between steps.  Also best suggestion is to line your pan with foil so you can lift it right out to cut the bars.  That worked great!!  My only beef with this recipe is to me it tasted overwhelmingly like shortbread.  I like shortbread, but I didn't taste caramel or chocolate.  And it was on there!  Don't think I'll make this again.

Delicious cookie, and will definitely be a Christmas favorite.  Followed the advice of others...prick the shortbread before and after baking, and thinned the chocolate out with some milk during melting (will use half and half next time).  I also used semisweet chocolate (all I had), but next time I will use milk chocolate.  I think it will make the cookie even better.  To get a pretty look to your chocolate topping, I used the insert end of an electric beater arm to swirl the chocolate right after I poured it on the caramel.  (I imagine you can use a kabob skewer or something similar) This helped get the chocolate in all the corners, and gave it a swirled top.  I will be making this often!

Instant family favorite!!!
I made these for Christmas and they were the hit of the party (you should have seen my SIL's face when her husband wouldn't stop raving about them just after she bragged that he didn't care that she didn't like to bake!) and I have been requested to make them for every holiday/family gathering from now on. 
I followed a couple of suggestions from other reviews. I poked holes in the crust before baking but left the time as-is - it came out perfect for shortbread. The caramel ended up with a few dark spots but did not taste burned at all. I added some of the leftover condensed milk to the chocolate chips and cream to make a sort of ganache and cut them when they were fairly cool but not hard yet.

I made the mistake of following the version of this recipe that is in the cookbook.  BIG mistake, ruined a whole pan of potential caramel.  You only need to boil the caramel for 3 or 4 minutes and stir CONTSTANTLY.  Then take it off of the burner and stir it for about two more minutes. This turned out WONDERFULLY.  My husband gives it a 10, and he never gives anything a 10.

I searched for this recipe because I had a friend at college whose mum would always make these and we'd all dig into them back in the dorms. I followed the recipe (online)completely and everything turned out great. Not quite as good as my friend's mum, but good eneough for me to make this for future occassions. The caramel was perfect so I am not usre what some of the other reviewers did wrong, and the chocolate easily sticks on top. The only things i felt was not quite right was the shortcake...crumbly for first 2 days and a little too light. A week later it is firm and still tastes great.

LOVE these bars!!!!!! They taste just like Twix bars ~ mmm mmm mmm. I docked the crust before baking, as suggested by previous reviews. I also took a hint from another reviewer and just sprinkled the chocolate chips over the warm caramel layer, spreading with the back of a spoon when they softened. I chilled them for about 3 hours and then cut them into squares. They look as beautiful as they taste. Thanks Julia for my new favorite treat!

Absolutely heavenly! The only revisions I made to this recipe was to double it and bake it in a 9 x 13 pan (greased and floured, definitely!), and I added about a tsp of oil to the chocolate (which was half semi-sweet and half milk) when I melted it. Everything turned out perfect. The caramel was firm and chewy, and the chocolate was just firm enough to make a solid shell. This may become my new specialty!

Made these for my family. I had to bar my mom from them so she wouldnt dig in to them with a spoon! I hid them in the freezer so I could have one in my lunch.  One thing that i found helped to keep the shortbread attached to the caramel, is to prick with with a fork quite a few times, when there is only a few minutes left in the oven.  That gives the caramel some holes to ooze into and adhere.

Mmm, this was tasty.  I had some adaptions.  First, I didn't have sweetened condensed milk so I used melted vanilla ice cream, and prepared it with the other ingredients in the microwave, just letting it bubble for about 7 minutes or so until the color of caramel was reached.  The caramel spread easily and even when cooled was soft and chewy.  Also used a little less chocolate, just enough for a top "shell" and I used semi-sweet, with a little oil and milk to thin out enough to be spreadable.  Was easy to adapt so it got good rankings.  Thanks!

Delicious! I brought these to two events recently, and they were a very big hit at both. After reading the other reviews I made a few modifications to the recipe: I lined the pan with foil, and I added about 1/2 tsp of oil to the chocolate before melting (so it wouldn't get too hard when it cooled.) When I made my second batch I added a bit of semi-sweet chocolate to the milk chocolate to cut the sweetness a bit. A definite keeper recipe.

These are one of my favorite go to cookies for luncheons or parties or just to share.  They are easy and look nice on a platter.  They are like a home Twix bar.  I use this caramel recipe for nearly all my recipes that call for caramel.  No need to purchase caramel squares to melt when you have this recipe.  I always keep a can or two of sweetened condensed milk on hand and use the entire can for this recipe.  I don't bother to measure out 1/2 cup.  It's likely more than a half cup, but it turns out perfect.

The shortbread  did not stick together and the carmel was too hard.   I double checked the ingredient portions and made sure I timed the boiling and stirring  of the carmel.

Yum!  Like other reviewers said you should constantly mix the caramel on a low boil for the 5 minutes so it doesn't burn.  And use parchment for easy lifting and cutting.  Cut bars while chocolate has a soft set, don't wait  until its hardened or you'll run into difficulty cutting.  Everyone raved about this!  It's really delicious.

The caramel turned out great. I understand some reviews about scorching. I started to see some darker specks so turned down temp a little, but need to make certain you stir entire area of pot to keep this from happening.If I were to make again I would not start caramel till first layer is out of oven and cooled. I would not start the chocolate melting till caramel is set. I ruined my chocolate because I started the melting and wasn't ready for it reheating dried it up. The good news is, I think it was way too rich with all that chocolate so that said, I just did a few drops of chocolate added pecans and some sea salt as others suggested. If you love super rich dessert then you will love it. I would give this a 4 rating with my changes.

Delicious... but tricky to  have come out right.  Next time I will use an 8x8 inch pan so caramel and chocolate layers are thicker. Line pan with foil.  Pack shortbread down, bake & cool completely before starting caramel recipe, and prick shortbread after baking.  Follow recipe for caramel - but only beat with spoon for 2 minutes or it sets up too fast and is hard to pour and spread. Stir caramel constantly over low heat or it will scorch.  Be sure you use milk chocolates chips, or use double boiler to melt.  In microwave heat for 1 min and stir, then heat 30 sec and stir, 20 seconds and stir, 10 seconds and stir or it gets grainy if heated too fast.  Add 1 teaspoon of butter to make it smooth. Cut in small squares when cool because these are very rich.

I added one capful of Vanilla to my crust while blending the crust mix. I also added two capfuls of Vanilla to the caramel mixture just before pouring the caramel sauce over the shortbread crust.

It's so so good. I kept it exactly how it was except added condensed milk to the chocolate.  I didn't mind that it was a thin layer of shortbread but other people might.

Theses are amazing, luscious, addictive. Oh, so rich. I'm not a big dessert person and these are hard to stay away from. It's snowing and I'm home alone. All of a sudden I got excited about making these and realized I only have one stick of butter left! Off to the internet to see if there's any way to make the shortbread without it!!

These things are ridiculously easy, and delicious to make. I gave you fair warning-!

Love this.  I have made it twice.  The first time it was a treat that I gave away at Christmas time.  Made it last night for my spouse as a special request.  I brought half of the batch into work because we would have just kept eating them and they were a hit!! Honestly,   they are super easy to make!!! Thanks for sharing this!!

I made these for work in a throw away foil cake pan and they turned out wonderfully, everyone raved about them.  I tried to make them again in a glass dish and they needed a lot more time to cool between layers, which I failed to do, so these turned out very crumbly.

I stirred while cooking because I thought it was it was pretty obvious you needed to, but I boiled it on medium, not low, and it was a solid, crunchy layer when it cooled. The shortbread was also crumbly, so IF I make these next time, I will add more butter.

These are delicious. The caramel has a great flavor and texture. I'm afraid to make another batch as they are addictive. Make sure you have someone to share them with. I was afraid that my caramel wouldn't set up if I stirred but I ended up with some dark caramel floaters- so I will stir next time.

It was pretty good, but the caramel to shortbread ratio is off.  If you follow the recipe, you'll get a super thin caramel layer.  I suggest doubling the caramel.

I haven't tried this before but, from watching the film & seeing just how to put this together. It sure looks like one of the raiser recipe's like this I've found :-)! I'm also going to try to make a nobake peanut butter cookie , & try using that for the center filling also :-)!! Thanks for the lovely recipe!

Excellent. I didn't have sweetened condensed milk so I mixed the following together to use as a substitute: 1 egg, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 Tbsp flour, 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/8 tsp salt.

First of all, I'm not sure how to rate this because much of the advice I went with was from other reviews, not the recipe itself. I froze the shortbread while I made the caramel. I stirred the caramel constantly once it came to a boil.

Second, I always want a temperature when I make candy. There is no temp on this recipe. 

Third, my husband--the sweets king--said that the taste lacked complexity. And that's after I salted the shortbread and the caramel. I would definitely add some Maldon flakes to the top, but beyond that I'm not sure where I would go. Crushed pretzel on the top? Orange in the shortbread or caramel? Peanuts in the caramel? Hm...

I have made this a couple times, first time according to recipe but doubled, the second time I made I added chopped peanuts next to caramel layer and pressed in to make stick, then cooled. After cooled I removed from parchment paper, reused the same piece and added melted chocolate, replaced the entire cookie layer on top of melted chocolate and topped with more melted chocolate, returned to fridge to set, cut into squares. More like "oh henry" meets "twix" thank you for the recipe

Yummy treat! I lined my pan with parchment paper. Not too difficult to make, however, even with the temp turned down you need to continuously stir caramel as it boils or it will burn. I used dark brown sugar which isn't as pretty as the light sugar. I will make again, my husband and his office will request I'm sure.

This was really easy to make, simple ingredients and very good. Coworkers loved it too - a huge hit! I agree that dividing it in smaller pieces is wise. It is rich.

I should have known by quite a few of the reviews that this recipe had a good chance of being a frustrating, time consuming disaster. But happy day for those of you that had success. : )

I discovered these at the family Christmas party and was instantly hooked. The shortbread is buttery and not too sweet and the caramel is creamy and not too gooey, all under a soft shell of chocolate. These things are to die for.

Love this recipe!  The only substitution I made was to use semi sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate.  This reduced the sweet factor but they were absolutely scrumptious.

I made these last night while I had 3 boys under 5 running around...i was sure I was going to mess something up! They are actually really easy and not as fussy as I thought they would be! I would say to poke holes in the raw shortbread and to bake it for 25 mins instead of 20, but that might just be my oven. After boiling the caramel mixture, I put it into my kitchen aid mixer and used the whisk attachment, and whisked it on high for a couple of minutes. The chocolate layer was a little more work, I wouldn't recommend doing it in the microwave, I did mine in a pan on low, added a couple Tbs. of sweetened condensed milk, a little butter and some half and half. They turned out amazing...the hardest part was waiting for them to cool and set up so I could cut into them!

The caramel actually came out quite fantastic, but the shortbread cookie tasted very dry and bland. I am defiantly going to try this recipe again but I will try to spruce it up with some macadamia nuts or pecans and perhaps add some vanilla to the batter.

These are so yummy! They kind of remind me of Twix. I didnt make my own caramel because I had a bag of caramels to use so I melted those with a little butter and spread that over the shortbread. Chocolate, caramel and shortbread heaven. Thanks for sharing! These will be a constant on my Christmas cookie list for years to come!

Excellent. Just make sure to cool each layer before adding the next, and you're good to go. Easy, sliced well, and super yummy! I added a little bit of coarsely ground sea salt to the top for a little something extra. Good stuff!

Like others, I doubled this recipe, allowed it cool between each layer and used dark chocolate.  I lined an 11x13 pan with parchment paper, which made it really easy to take out of the pan.  I froze the squares but cut through them when the chocolate was cold but not frozen.  It was easy to break into squares when completely frozen and all layers held together.

Crumbled and the layers fell apart.  With how time consuming it was to make, expected a better cookie.  Save yourself the time and buy a twix.

I was disappointed.  Caramel becomes grainy withing a day or so -  I wished the caramel were 'milkier' tasting, too,  and not so sweet.  The overall taste was kind of 'cheap' even though I used 8 oz of Callebault semi sweet Belgian chocolate.

Oh so good. I followed the recipe - but had a hard time with the caramel. I used a double boiler and it never seemed to get hot enough. Next time might just use one pot. Also should have made it a day ahead as the caramel was still a bit soft when I cut them. But regardless I won second prize at my yearly Christmas cookie exchange!

I have made this recipe 3 times now. These taste great but there are issues with the recipe. 1st of all, double the carmel and 2nd of all the instruction to put the chocolate in the microwave has NEVER worked for me. It turns out dry and crumbly. I always end up melting even more chocolate over the stove, adding butter to make it smooth and pourable.

Delicious! This will be a Christmas tradition at my house.  Definitely double the recipe - these are too good to run out of! I made the recipe exactly as written except doubled.  Put the caramel on the shortbread after it has cooled.  It turned out perfectly.

Followed the recipe to a T but the shortbread fell away from the caramel and chocolate layer!  Made a double batch so the whole thing is ruined.  I've made another recipe version of millionare's shortbread and it came out fine before. This recipe was a disappointment.

These are unbelievable!  Even better than my mother's!  I made them for a party, and doubled the recipe, but I wish I'd kept a few for our family because they were irresistible!  It's a time-consuming process, but well worth it if you want something a little bit special.

YUM!I also stirred the caramel mixture constantly until it reached soft ball stage in a cool cup of water, and I used white sugar because thats all I had. I also used candy coating on top instead of chocolate chips. = D thanks!

FANTASTIC! I love traditional shortbread with just caramel, so I omit the chocolate. These are easy to make and taste great. I brought them to the office for a treat and since then get requests to bring them again!!

I must made these this evening. Fantastic recipe. My only substitution was that I didn't have any corn syrup so I used agave nectar instead - can't tell the difference. I melted the chocolate on the stove for a glossier look. Will make again. Oh and or those that found the shortbread too crumbly. You need to be sure the butter is well distributed and pack the crumbs tightly into the pan. :-)

These are excellent and easy to make.  I used an 8X8 pan, so it took about 10 extra minutes for the shortbread to bake. I also chilled the shortbread before putting on the caramel, and chilled the caramel layer thoroughly before putting on the chocolate.  I had no trouble with the filling falling off the shortbread.

Delicious!!!  I doubled the shortbread recipe but then forgot to double the carmel and chocolate.  It was more difficult to cover the whole pan, but I think it cut some of the sweetness probably.  Can't wait to make these again!!

THis recipe is a good start.  My shortbread crumbled majorly and it was way too thick!  I even pressed it into an 11 X 7" pan.  I baked my crust and let it cool over night. My first batch of caramel burnt, so I had to start over.  The second batch came out perfect and set up beautifully!  I used about 10 oz. of milk chocolate bars and couldn't have probably used less, so I will try 6 ore 8 oz. the next time.  These taste like Twix bars.  The next time I will try a different crust recipe.  I had no trouble cutting mine, except the crust falling apart.

A good trick to getting these delicious bars out of the pan is to use a springform pan, you could line it with oversized baking paper.

These were excellent!  A definite add to the "do again" file (as my husband calls it).  I followed some of the tips from other users and poked holes with a fork into the cookie base.  I made the caramel mixture at a lower heat.  I preferred eating them cold myself!  Overall, one of the better squares recipes I've tried in a long, long time!

Great Recipe-I love these squares and have been wanting to make them for a loong time. I doubled the recipe instantly (we have 9 teenagers), boiled the caramel on n°3 out of 9 on my hob and it was brilliant. For those of you who said it was too sweet, I used unsweetened condensed milk.

These were really good! The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars was the shortbread. I will try and find a different recipe for the shortbread; this one crumbled horribly and they were almost impossible to keep together once cut. Super great taste though.

What an amazing recipe! Thank you so much for sharing. The richness of the squares pairs well with a strong cup of coffee. I prefer the coffee to be black and unsweetened, but to each their own. Great job :)

These were a huge hit! I refrigerated the shortbread over night and then cooled the caramel in the fridge the next day for a couple of hours before adding the chocolate layer.

Doubled recipe and made in a 9x13 pan.  Lined pan with parchment paper and cooled shortbread before adding caramel layer.  I used semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate chips because it is what I had on hand and I'll do that again next time.  They are plenty sweet.  Taste like a twix bar, only better!

good flavor but the caramel was too soft. These bars would not stay together at room temp.

These are decadent!  Wow.  I used dark chocolate on the top layer and doubled the caramel and chocolate layers.  I also placed it in the freezer between each layering.  I placed parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and just popped it out for easy cutting.  It worked like a charm.  Will make again.

WOW is all I can say about this recipe. I did not change a thing except for adding a pinch of salt to the shortbread. I have made this twice now, once in little muffin tins as tarts and once doubled in a 9 X 13 dish in bar form--I MUCH prefer the bar. The caramel is out of this world (and I typically don't even like caramel) and the shortbread is excellent. For a double recipe I only used a little over 1 1/2 cups of melted chocolate and it was a perfect ratio. To make it easy to cut after I poured the caramel on the cooled shortbread layer I let it set in the fridge. THEN I poured on the chocolate and let it sit out at room temperature until the chocolate just set but was still soft. They cut perfectly and came out of the pan with ease (used parchment paper on the bottom). I HIGHLY recommend this recipe, it is one of my favorites!!

Tasty, although I broke the cardinal rule of Allrecipes and made the recipe as-is without taking into account reviews--my mistake!  When I went to cut them, the chocolate had hardened completely and made it very difficult to cut them--the caramel squished out all over, so they were very messy-looking, but tasty nonetheless.  I may make them in mini muffin cups next time to avoid having to cut them....
----------------
Updated: Doubled the dough, then pushed it into the bottom and sides of mini muffin tins...still baked 20 min.  Used 1.5x the caramel recipe, and filled each shortbread cup with caramel, then topped with chocolate (only needed the original amt.).  With these changes, FANTASTIC!  Now they're portable and bite-sized and not messy and still just as tasty!  Got about 44 using this method.

The first couple of times I made this I had problems with the crust being very crumbly, but last time I used icing sugar instead of granulated sugar and it seemed to hold together better. Also, I didn't have light corn syrup, used golden instead and it was still great. The caramel turns out perfect every time.

HEAVENLY!!  These are SO delicious - everyone raves about these and asks for the recipe whenever I make them.  I put my in the fridge after it cools for about an hour.  Then I pull them out, let it sit at room temp for about 20 minutes and then I cut them and they turn out perfect!!  This recipe is a keeper - thanks!!!!

I did not make the top chocolate layer. I think it's quite optional because it's quite sweet already without it. But the taste is heavenly! It slowly melts in your month, all of my friends who tasted it keep on praising it. The only problem is that the crust keeps on falling apart, I think half of my crust fell out. So that part of the recipe may require some adjustment. Otherwise, It's perfect!

These bars are so pretty and even more delicious. I was sure that they would never turn out looking like the picture but they did (maybe better because i swirled melted white chocolate with the milk chocolate)! I doubled the recipe and made it a 9x13 pan lined with parchment paper. Froze in between each layer.(make sure that you poke the crust with a fork prior to cooling and everything should layer evently) They were easy to cut, using a serrated knife dipped in hot water. Fantastic!

Wow! What a yummy, rich dessert. The carmel itself is worth making for ice cream or anything else. I used a 9x7.5" glass dish. I had no trouble with the temperature of the crust making the carmel run, I put the carmel on about 10 mins after taking it out of the oven. When I make these again I think I will cook the shortbread just a little bit longer and maybe use less chocolate, just to cut down on the sweetness. The only problem I had was eating it before it set up, but that's my own fault!!! It tastes just like a Twix as one reader said.

These did not turn out how I thought they would. I ended up having to bake the cookie twice as long because it was still not cooked after the given time. The caramel part was really good but never got hard or even stiff which was fine when I poured it over the cookie but not good when I tried to cut it. The chocolate, not sure what I did wrong with it, but it just never got smooth. I microwaved it just a little at a time to avoid burning and it still stayed hard and lumpy. Wouldn't spread out and with the caramel not getting stiff it kind of mixed in a little and looked very amaturish. My kids liked it but not loved it, I found it way too sweet and I have a very big sweet tooth. I may try these again but not right now.

This is really delicious! I didn't find corn syrup here in the Netherlands, so I used something called sugar syrup.  I didn't wait for the shortbread to cool off before adding the caramel (which you have to cook on a really low fire otherwise it burns really quick). The shortbread does crumble a lot, but the taste is worth the mess!

This tastes pretty good but it doesn't stick together.  The bottom layer crumbles off when you take out a piece.  I ended up stirring vigorously for 10+ minutes to keep the caramel from burning, and when I poured it on the first layer,  it didn't spread easily.  Pushing the first layer in the glass 9x9 pan was also quite messy.  Maybe putting the shortbread layer in the freezer while I was making the caramel wasn't a good idea because it made the caramel not sink in and stick to the bottom layer.  All in all a little disappointing.  It will taste good but I wouldn't want to take it anywhere.

I always make this recipe. I double it to fit a 9X13 pan. I never cool the layers. As soon as the shortbread layer comes out of the oven I put the carmal layer on and then the chocolate (If I am really lazy I throw the chocolate chips right on the hot caramel layer and spread them as they melt.

To be honest, I didn't even have enough time/ingredients to make the caramel or the chocolate layers. The shortbread part itself tasted so good I had to give it 5 stars! Perfect cook time, too. It was crumbly and delicious and perfectly done.

I made these for the first time. I doubled the recipe and made no other modifications. It was a big hit with friends, family and co-workers. They wanted the recipe and asked if I could make them every day! It was tricky (for me) to cut after it was totally chilled, but I should have just let it warm up a bit more, I guess.

Pretty good.  I have problems with the shortbread separating from the caramel layer. I think the shortbread layer is a bit thick.
I'd make it again, but maybe only 3/4 of the shortbread part of the recipe.  Will look back for hints others might have to keep the shortbread connected to the caramel.
I completely cooled every layer between adding the next and cut the chocolate before it got hard.  They look really pretty, once I set them on the shortbread again.

Make sure that the bowl you melt the chocolate in is COMPLETELY DRY. There was a drop of water in mine and the chocolate turned into a grainy ball that I had to throw away. It worked great the second time though. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 baking dish lined with foil as suggested. I scored the bars after the chocolate hardened a bit, then wrapped in plastic and foil to freeze. When I took it out, I cut the bars and put them in little miffin cups, wrapped them up, and they were a part of my chirstmas baskets. Luckily there were leftovers because these taste sooo good.

These are the best! We made them at our Annual Mother-Daughter Holiday Baking Day, and they were my favorite the of everything... and we bake lots of goodies! They are simple to make, and cut nicely with a warm knife to put on goodie plates. They hold up fine at room temperature, another huge plus. I used semi-sweet chips on the top because I forgot to buy milk chocolate, and they were still good. Might try dark chocolate on the top like someone else suggested. YUM!

Very yummy and sooo scrumptious....my only thing from giving this baby a 5 is that my shortbread crust was a bit crumbly, to cut and to eat...although the flavor was all there....buttery and rich, these do hit the spot. I just wished the crust was a bit firmer and stayed in nice neat squares. I will try this again!

These were really good and really rich as other reviewers noted.  I made the shortbread the night before.  I chilled it after I poured the caramel on and again after I poured the chocolate on.  I didn't have any problem with the chocolate separating from the caramel but I cut it at room temperature.  I thought the shortbread could have been better but it was somewhat crumbly and not as flavorful as expected.  Next time I make this I will find another shortbread recipe.  Thanks!  They turned out really pretty.

(PS- It's super easy to figure out if the caramel is done by dropping a spoonful into a bowl of water.  If you can role it into a ball it's ready.  I boiled this for 5 minutes but didn't stir it for 3 minutes afterwards.)

Wow! These are so awesome! Very Sweet and definitely need a glass of milk! If they turn out gooey, it's because you didn't cook the caramel long enough. I kinda liked it gooey better, personally. If you want it to look like the picture, refrigerate 30-60 min. between layers. The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 (?) dish. It turned out great!

These were really easy to do and came out wonderfully! I halved the recipe and made them nice and thick in a mini loaf pan. The crust was a bit crumbly so I would suggest adding a tablespoon of milk to the batter before pressing it into the pan. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Next time I'd like to try almond extract. The caramel was a bit too buttery for my taste but I'm not sure if decreasing the butter would affect the texture because the texture was PERFECT. One last suggestion - decrease the chocolate and increase the caramel. Some chopped nuts would add interesting texture to the top as well! Try it! It's easy, beautiful and delicious!

These were so easy and so good. My husband thought that they were a bit too sweet, but I thought they were perfect. My only problem was that I'm not patient enough and put the chocolate on when the caramel wasn't quite firm enough so it sunk a little in the middle, but tasted great all the same.

A family favorite. Everyone is always impressed by these, but the family is divided on wether we should have chewy caramel or firm. Either way these taste great and are easy to make.

This is a really rich and tasty recipe, but it needs to be a day or two after making. After that the caramel center become less like caramel and sort of dries out.

I love these! I've made them numerous times now, especially over the holidays, and they are always a big hit. I think that I've had the best luck with them when  I've allowed each layer to cool, particularly the shortbread. Otherwise, very yummy!

These are a little rich for me.  I thought they were awkward to cut and serve.  I had trouble with the chocolate cracking because they were too cold on the sides but then in the middle the caramel oozed and the chocolate wasn’t hard enough because they were too warm.  So they aren’t as pretty as the picture makes them look.

These were soo good. Although this was my first time making caramel, I don't think I cooked it long enough because it's still just a lille runny, but it started to burn on the sides of the pan, so.. Other than that, I think I did pretty well. My family loved them as well. Will deifinitely be making again. I will try a different shortbread recipe, I found this one to be very flaky.

Beautiful.  This is a dangerous recipe to have around because you just can't stop eating them.  I let the base cool completely (after poking with a fork) before pouring on the caramel, and again allowed this to cool before adding the chocolate.  This recipe is a keeper.

I like the idea of this recipe.  But-the shortbread is not very good-I found it to be pretty dry.  Next time I made these-I would find a better shortbread recipe for the bottom layer.

These were awesome and evryone said so!  They do taste a bit like Twix bars but so much better.  I refrigerated each layer for a while before starting the next and poked holes in the shortbread.  I think both are key.  AND WATCH YOUR CARAMEL!!!  I burned the first batch even as I stood over it.  VERY LOW HEAT!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

These cookies are absolutely delicious!My caramel layer was a bit too gooey so I guess I didn't cook it long enough. Next time I will use a candy thermometer. I alwyas use a sheet of aluminum foil to line the bottom and sides of the pan when baking any type of bar cookies or brownies. After cooling in the pan for a bit I can lift the whole thing out foil and all, then let the cookies cool completely. They are much easier to cut and have a much neater appearance. Plus no messy pan to clean!

Ok, this year is the first year i've made candy and this recipe is one of the ones i tried.  all i can say is YUUUUMMMMMMY!!!  i was so proud that it turned out great and everyone was raving about it.  it wasn't hard to do (tho i was worried about the caramel as i've never made it before.)  i did do as others had suggested and let each layer cool(about 20-30 mins each)before adding the next layer.  i also poked holes in the shortbread.  definately going into my christmas hand-outs from now on!

These squares were my favorite this holiday season. I've just finshed making another double batch, due to the high demand. :) I found that chilling before putting the chocolate on, and then for a short time afterwards, helps the chocolate stay on. Bring to room temperature before cutting and then store at room temp. Great recipe! Thank you!

Excellent!  I followed others suggestions and poked holes in the shortbread after removing it from the oven.  I was worried if my caramel would turn out because I couldn't find my thermometer.  I used the method of dropping a bit of the caramel in cold water to see if it was ready.  Also, I let the chocolate cool slightly.  Then I cut the bars while the chocolate was still semi-soft so that it would be easier to remove from the pan when it hardened.  These turned out perfect!

these are really awesome.  to ensure a good crust USE REAL BUTTER.  trust me it helps and you dont need to butter your pan.  make sure when you put the dough in the pan you poke holes all over it with a fork. and make sure each layers is cooled completely before adding the next layer.  I didnt have light corn syup so I used golden syrup and its turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe

I followed recipe exactly, except for doubling it and making it in a 9x13 pan.  I was skeptical after reading reviews that it wasn't going to turn out since some had problems with the carmael layer and it wasn't clear about the layering if it should be cooled or not. The caramel layer was nice and firm yet still soft enough.  I did cook slower on a lower heat and stirred constantly and then checked with the water method.  I chilled each layer before adding the next and also before cutting.  I was quite pleased with the look and overall balance of shortbread to sweetness of this dessert.  I took it to a party that night and everyone really enjoyed them.  I highly recommend them.

Absolutely amazing!  Upon reader suggestions, I chilled each layer before adding the next.  I lined the pan with parchment paper to avoid the sticking problems that others had mentioned.  Once the last chocolate layer hardened, I removed from the fridge and used a large knife to cut all squares.  I store squares in a tupperware in the fridge.  This makes it ideal for making ahead for a party, etc.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are my favorite dessert!  I cut back on the caramel and the chocolate layer.  I don't cook the caramel as long as the recipe calls for.  I remove from heat a minute or so after it starts boiling then stir for another minute so that it pours easily over shortbread.  I also pour the rest of the Eagle Brand milk over the top of the bars.  Yummy!

Very tasty - pretty much like a twix bar.  I cooked the caramel according to the water test, not these instructions, so I can't vouch for them.  Extremely important: cut at room temperature!  The chocolate just cracks off if you try to cut them from the fridge.  Thank you!

I really did not care for these much.  I ended up throwing most of it away when no one would eat them.  They were extremely sweet without much flavor.  I like sweet but for me these were make you sick sweet.  I did not care for the shortbread bottom either.

I love these bars! My biggest problem was that I used the recipe from the All Recipes Cookbook and in that version it tells you to boil the caramel for close to twenty minutes! Obviously, I scorched my first batch and had to start over. I have made them several times since then and they turn out great every time!

These were everyone's new favorite cookie this year.  They were very easy and I had no trouble getting them out of the pan.  I used semi-sweet chips.  The shortbread alone is rather blah but it works wonderfully in this recipe to balance the rich chocolate and caramel.  I did not find it crumbly.  I nearly burned the first pot of caramel so you do need to watch it close.  My caramel layer was a bit softer than it looks in the picture.  It held up cutting but would squish out the sides when you bit it.  Wonderful recipe, thanks Julia!  They will be a permanent addition to the Christmas cookie platter and I will also be making these for Valentine's Day.

Like other reviewer said terrible shortbread but the rest is wonderful!! The shortbread was crumbly and tasteless. I used a silicone pan and had no problem getting them out.It wasn't as defined as the picture either. I will make again with a different shortbread.

This was a great recipe, and my family loved it. When they first taste tested it for me they told me I should make more because it would disappear quickly. Next time I will put foil in the pan so it will be easier to cut. Otherwise, loved it!!

YUM! I burned my first batch of caramel, but the second (cooked much more slowly) turned out great. I used semi-sweet chips, and melted them slowly using the microwave. The caramel was cool by the time I added the chocolate, and somehow they swirled  together to look beautiful!

YUM!  I will definately make these again!  This is the best tasting carmel i have ever had and definately the easiest to make!  I followed a past suggestion to use a handmixer to beat the carmel and it worked just fine.  I also did not have light corn syrup so I used dark and couldn't tell any difference.  I added a pinch of salt to the carmel as others have suggested and it really seemed to add something.  I also used semi-sweet chip because i'm not a big milk chocolate fan.

Not as easy to make as the recipe claims at the top, BUT....well worth the effort.  These were the big winner at my cookie baking party.  TIP: I put mine in the freezer after I added the chocolate so that I could cut them quicker.  This also made them easy to cut.

The recipe itself was good, except I burned the chocolate for the top and all you could taste was burnt chocolate!  This recipe is probably very good minus the operator error!

These were outstanding and easy to make.  I will make regularly!  I did chill before cutting - I may not do that again becase they were a little difficult to cut.  I also tried another tip from the reviews - sprinkle chocolate chips over the top and spread when melted. Worked like a charm!  I took these to a Christmas cookie exchange and won the "best tasting cookie" award this year!  They were a hit.

Oh my. These are so good! I only had one cup of butter, so I used ½ cup in the crust plus 2 or 3 tablespoons of margarine. Other than that, I followed the directions for the crust and caramel layers to a 'T' (although I did dock the crust a little before baking). I thought I had chocolate chips...... And I was wrong. So I omitted the chocolate layer! The crust is slightly crumbly (but tasty!) and the caramel is somewhat gooey (but extra-tasty!). Next time, I'll try it with chocolate, but it's awesome without! Thanks for the recipe!!

I have a new favorite for the holidays. These squares are scrumptious. They were very easy to make, and I followed the directions exactly.  Be sure to stir the caramel well for a few minutes after you take it off the heat so it gets thicker. I let it cool at room temperature for only about 10 minutes.  The shortbread base is done just when you see a golden tinge to the edges. Don't wait for the whole pan to color. I was worried about sticking, so I used a 9x9 pyrex with a spray of Pam-butter.   I cut them into fudge size pieces because they are so rich.  They look good and taste better- start to finish- 40 minutes!

OH MY GOD!  These are SO fabulous - I had tons of compliments on them last Xmas, and they are first on my baking list for this year.  Fabulously good and easy - though I did end up burning the sugar a little and had some little burned bits in my caramel (no one minded, though!)

I made these for a cookie exchange and they were voted the best ones there!  Like many other reviewers, I doubled the recipe in a 13 x 9 pan, and docked the shortbread before baking it.  Delicious!  (Anything made with sweetened condensed milk is a definite keeper!)

Absolutely delicious!  I had trouble witht the crust crumbling and the layers seperating, but I'll try again using some of the tips I learned from the reviews.  The cramel was just right.  I used semi-sleet chocolte chips because that's all I had, but I think milk chocolate would be good too.  Definitely worth another try.

These were so easy! My husband absolutely loves them and so does everyone at his office! I agree with previous tips - poke holes before and after baking the shortbread, and I added the rest of the sw. condensed milk to the chocolate chips and simmered to make more like a ganache - no trouble cutting them and nothing broke! Thank you for this excellent and yummy recipe!!

Oh my goodness! These are so yummy! I have a bite in my mouth as I write this. This was my first time making shortbread or caramel, so I was pretty nervous, but it worked great! I poked holes in the shortbread and let it cool (in freezer for 30 minutes.) Then I poured the chocolate chips on the top and smeared around like others suggested. It worked great, but you don't get the three even layers like on the picture. I don't really care though, no one will be looking at them. My boyfriend said "They're like candy, but better!" Thats quite a compliment coming from a sweet tooth like him. Thanks again for the recipe and advice!

I gave this recipe a 4 but it could definitely be a 5. This is a fussy recipe, but I think if I make it a few more times it can be perfected. The squares taste so good. I got a lot of raves about them. It was just cutting the squares that got me. If anyone has an easier way to cut them without the chocolate cracking and ruining the squares, please post. The shortbread was a little crumbly but I think if you make it a couple days in advance and keep it in the freezer it may harden more and be easier to cut. I loved this recipe, it would be great for Christmas. I made it for a Bridal shower. I doubled the recipe but I didn't really need to do that, it's best to cut them into bite size squares as what's pictured is much too big. I also poked holes in the crust and lined my pan with tinfoil. Excellent recipe!

We liked this a lot, but think the shortbread layer should have been crunchier - it was a bit soft for our taste.  Otherwise, pretty good - definitely need to let them warm up to cut them...

These cookies are wonderful! I followed the advice of other reviewers and poked holes in the crust and increased the baking time by 5 minutes. No problem with the caramel not sticking to the crust. Also, because others had said the chocolate was hard to cut, I used a ganache topping instead. I simmered 1/2 cup of cream and then added 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate and a couple tablespoons sugar and beat until smooth. I did need to add a bit more cream, but I don't know how much, I just did it by sight. The topping was great, not too sweet and easy to cut. Thanks!

This recipe is awesome!  We loved it!  All the suggestions were so helpful.  We added half and half to the chocolate chips and poked holes in the shortbread before and right after baking.  The caramel was soft and wonderful.  We used the recipe from the website, so the cooking time was definitely shorter.  We chilled overnight and cut into very small squares.  Rich and decadent...  Definitely will make again.

One of the best shortbread recipes ever!!It combines three of my favorite things- shortbread, caramel, and chocolate. The only problem I found was that the chocolate layer needed some sweetened condensed milk added to it in order for it to melt better. You may could add some butter to it instead. Very rich but good.

This has potential. I made this awhile back, and looking at the other reviews I'm tempted to try again for better results. My shortbread crust was very thick and crumbly (as in it just fell apart when cut), with a raw flour taste, and it didn't want to stick to the caramel. I think that was my main problem, and if I measure the flour with a lighter hand, poke some holes in it with a fork, and bake it a little longer, that might do the trick. The caramel didn't get too stiff, as some others had trouble with, and my chocolate stuck just fine. It sure looks pretty in the book! Worth fiddling with to get just right, I'll keep trying.

YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  These were divine!!  A couple of quick tricks though....line the baking pan with Reynolds Release foil (makes removing from pan much easier) and bake the shortbread a teeny bit longer.  Cut these into little 1" squares, too!  Super-rich but yummy!  A "regular" on my Christmas cookie list, for sure!  :-D

I tried this recipe because it sounded delicious.  It may be, but everything that could go wrong did.  I followed everyones suggestions, and still had no luck.  I would try this same shortbread, caramel, chocolate combination using a shortbread cookie intead of the bar.  Drop the caramel on, and then coat with chocolate.

I took all suggestions and comments to mind when making these. . . I lined pan with foil and greased it.  AS far as the caramel goes, I added 1 12 tsp of milk before vigourously beating for 3 minutes.  It never set!  It was soft, gooey and good, but didn't allow chocolate to spread evenly.  Additionally, it wasn't correct texture and seemed to make each square fall apart.

The taste was sweet overall, but NOTHING like a Twix.  It was okay.  I doubt I'll even try the recipe again--it was OK!

This is a great recipe...I found it in the cookbook and made it.  Only trouble was, they said to boil for 30 minutes or so.  Had to come here to find the right time.  Definitely easier the second time around.

Wonderful! I adjusted the recipe to fit a 9x13" pan. I also used an actual hershey milk chocolate bar for the top layer. I didn't let the chocolate become really hard before cutting, and didn't have any trouble getting them out of the pan. Great recipe!

Absolutely Delicious! What a great twist on traditional shortbread. One tip: When boiling the center (carmalized layer) watch the pot carefully... the mixture will burn quickly! Otherwise, FANTASTIC!

Maybe it was me but many went to waste because I found them difficult to cut without the chocolate cracking.  Also couldn't find a 9X9 square pan anywhere.

My children did not like the shortbread crust.  They loved the caramel.  Came up with an idea to use the caramel and milk chocolate.  If turns out good and children like it.  I will submit it to this web site.

I followed the recipe, right down to cutting them into 1" squares.  My family and I enjoyed these squares and I will definitely make them again.  The squares were the perfect size with a cup of tea after enjoying dinner.

Caramel was perfect! For those that thought the caramel was too thin on the shortbread for the 13 x 9 pan  just 3x the recipe for the caramel and you will have a lovely layer of caramel. The crust was wonderful as was the chocolate top.  Be sure to take the time to cool each layer as recommended. Otherwise you will have the chocolate and the caramel running together. Huge hit with the family. Definitely worth the effort!

I love the shortbread. I would suggest to double boil the chocolate. When I microwaved the chocolate, it didn't melt. It turned to clay.

These are HEAVENLY!  But, you must be patient and take your time with the caramel otherwise it'll burn.  I stir constantly before I bring it to a boil.  They are well worth the effort!!

All the components are delicious but, as written, the shortbread is too crumbly and the caramel is too stiff to eat it successfully or to cut into one inch squares. It really ruins the experience.

Followed the recipe to a tee and it came out DELICIOUS. It is very rich and sweet, so I would say about 40 servings is appropriate.  Eat sparingly!!

This is Bakery Chef type desert but homemade. So easy to make to get a decadent dessert. I will try semi sweet chocolate chips next time. 
I had only one issue in the beginning when cooking the caramel sauce. The sauce started to boil at medium heat then it began to get dark brown spots in it. I turned down the heat to low kept stirring and the dark spots incorporated back into the sauce. The sauce still boiled at low and I took it off at  5 minutes as instructed. It tasted great. My son who doesn't usually likes real sweet desserts liked this because of the crunchy shortbread.
Suggestion for getting the best results. Cool the shortbread completely before pouring the caramel on it, then let cool on counter (allows caramel to stiffen up) before adding chocolate topping. Use an off set spatula to spread chocolate  onto caramel. Then cool the whole dessert in pan in fridge before cutting. Use a sharp knife. Put cut squares in plastic container keep in fridge till 45 minutes before serving. Seems correct the crumbly crust when first baked.

Don't know what I did but my caramel never set and the chocolate layer just sat on top, not attached.  The caramel looked like soft caramel.  When I tried to cut it, the chocolate cracked every which way.  Shortbread was good though.  Bummer....I admit, making caramel is hard for me (even though I'm a fairly experienced baker), but this seemed so easy from the reviews.

I had never made caramel before, so I didn't know: you must stir over low heat. I had it on high the first time I tried this, and my caramel was rock solid.

Once I got the hang of the caramel, this recipe made amazing cookies. I second the recommendation to use dark chocolate - it really balances the sweetness of the rest of the cookie beautifully.

These were excellent.  I used dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate on the top.  

The description makes it sound as it they take 20 minutes but from beginning to end, it was over an hour; making the caramel took the majority of that time.  It seemed that keeping the heat at medium at first, then down to medium-low after the caramel started to boil worked out best on my stove.

I made these and they were INCREDIBLE.  I doubled the recipe and made two batches.  I followed the various suggestions and chilled between layers.  The first batch I went by the recipe completely, the second batch, I used sweetened condensed coconut milk and a mixture of milk and dark chocolate.  The second batch had a nice added coconut flavor, though the caramel took longer to set up.  I melted the chocolate with a little half and half (about 1/4 cup) as recommended.

A note, when making the caramel, first melt and heat the milk before adding the sugar.  Some of the sugar burned at the bottom of the pot first time around.

Definitely a keeper!

Will not make again, followed recipe exactly, first caramel layer burned, second one did not set up properly.  Lots of money wasted on ingredients. Not worth time or money. Printed recipe did not state medium heat nor stir constantly while boiling for 5 minutes, I turned gas stove down to low and first batch still burned. Very disappointed.

Overall the recipe turned out well. One thing that we would change is that we would make the shortbread layer thicker. We would do this so that you could taste that part better. Another thing that we would do is make the chocolate layer smaller so that the chocolate flavor is not as overpowering.

My daughter just loves caramel so I had to try this recipe. After reading the reviews that said the milk chocolate chips made everything too sweet I used semi sweet chips instead and regretted it! Next time I will definitely use milk chocolate chips!!!

This was really good. I used a slightly smaller pan for this recipe. I used around 170g of chocolate (milk and dark), which was a good amount. I think the caramel was a bit too sweet, and there was around double the caramel compared to the rest of the layers, so I might make that a bit smaller next time. Overall it was amazing and it turned out really well!

I made it doubled and exactly how previous reviewers suggested. I made part with milk chocolate and another with the dark as was suggested. I liked the dark better which is unusual for me. I had no problems with any part of the recipe. It turned out fine but I just didn't think it was that great

These are amazing!  I cooked my shortbread for an extra 5 minutes to make sure it was crisp.  Definitely be careful of burning the caramel, but homemade caramel is the wa to go!  My husband thinks the cookie layer could've been thinner, maybe next time I make it.  Will definitely make these again!  They were a hit at bunco!

I made this for the first time last week and it was amazing! I added a touch of salt to the caramel mixture which worked nicely. I also doubled it and made it in a 9 x 13 glass pan. It disappeared quickly, will make often!

I made this and my middle layer was not soft and chewy but toffee like. The bottom layer didn’t have much flavor and in the end I threw away the whole pan. Seriously disappointed.

Very good!  As mentioned by other reviewers use low heat and stir continually while making the caramel and it will come out perfectly.  Enjoy!

I somehow overcooked the caramel layer and it started setting before I could get it spread around. When it cooled, it was impossible to cut into it. Sure looked good though.

I made this twice, and the second time I added 1/4 teaspoon salt to the caramel sauce and it helped balance out the sweetness and gave it the salted caramel flavor I love. I also sprayed the pan first with Pam, but next time I will lay down Parchment first. Don’t try to cut it fresh out of the fridge - the chocolate will crack.

okay so I see plenty of people burned their caramel mixture once it comes to a boil turn it to medium low or low it will still boil number 2 I used cream instead of sweetened condensed milk And added it after the 5-minute boiling. Then I'd beat it vigorously with a wooden spoon put it back on the heat and boil for another 5 minutes at that point you will have a true stick to the spoon caramel mixture number 3 for me the chocolate coating on top was way too much and I prefer dark chocolate so I melted dark chocolate put it in a baggie and put pretty drizzles across the top. I also used some flaked pink Himalayan sea salt and gently sprinkled it over the top Sublime!

Great Recipe!!  Loved the taste.  Definitely prepare the caramel as directed, but on low.  Takes a bit longer, but it's worth it.  I'll 
 be sending  these out for Christmas Boxes for my Family.

Delicious.  Made double recipe in a 13x9 pan.  Read other reviews so chilled each layer before adding the next.  Pierced the shortbread with a fork before cooling.  Stirred the caramel constantly and added sea salt to the top of the cara,

This was super delicious. I made a lot of the tweaks recommended in the comments (low and slow for heating the caramel, dark chocolate instead of milk, etc). I also added a generous dash of salt to the caramel - not enough to make it a "salted caramel" or anything, just enough to balance out the sweetness. It was a  bit nondescript the first time I made it. Just about 1/4 tsp of sea salt seemed to make the caramel stand out more.

These are a huge hit with hubby and co-workers.  When making the caramel, make sure you have it on low heat and stir constantly.  My first batch of caramel burned slightly, but was still usable.  It seemed I didn't really have enough caramel to cover so I made another batch and discovered that I had only put in 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup (oops).  Did the second batch low and slow (with the right amount of sugar LOL) and had no issues.  Will definitely make again, and again.

TIP for caramel center: this is very similar to making candy. The hotter and longer you boil, the harder your center. If you want something softer, reduce the boiling time.
This was a big hit at my house. I'll have to brush up on my shortbread skills though as that was the only part I believe needing adjusting.

I made these for a luncheon with the ladies in my family and they were a big hit. I will definitely make them again. They are easy and delicious!! 

I followed some of the tips given by another review and have one  of my own to share. We used parchment paper to line the pan, cooked the caramel on low heat and stirred constantly, and added a tablespoon of butter to the chocolate chips (these were all tips suggested in another review.) 

My suggestion: I added some sea salt on the top of the chocolate layer to cut the sweetness a bit and it added a wonderful layer of flavor. You don't need a lot. 

Give it a try and enjoy!

They are delicious and rich!  Giving it 4 stars because the prep took longer than 35 minutes for me.  Took other reviewers advice and froze the shortbread after it cooled.  The caramel took a while to boil because I left it on low heat so I did not scorch it.  After I put the caramel layer on, I put it in the fridge to chill for maybe 30-40 minutes before putting the chocolate layer on top.  You need to work fast spreading on the caramel layer else it will start to harden.   I greased and floured the pan as another reviewer suggested.  I used a plastic knife to go around the edges of the pan (I used a non-stick pan) , turned the pan upside down and the contents popped out.  I then put it on a cutting board to cut into small squares.  Took some time to make but the result was worth it.

This was a really tasty dessert - super rich!  The only reason I am giving 4 stars is that it was not "quick and easy".  You really need a couple of hours at a minimum for everything to set properly - and the caramel layer is a bit time-consuming in order to avoid burning.  I cooked on low heat and constantly stirred so had no problem.  I did use dark chocolate instead of milk for better balance of flavors.  These are really good and worth making but just take a bit more time and attention than something I consider quick and easy.

This was very easy to make although I did need to add a little butter to the topping so it would spread easier.  However, we didn't think the taste was that good at all--way too bland.  And the layers kept separating making them a little hard to eat.  Will not make again--sorry!

Idk what happened. It was firm on the outside but when I cut into it the caramel just oozed out! I'm sure you're wondering why I'm giving four stars then. Even though it was a mess It was SO DELICIOUS!!! If I make this again I will try to take the advice from the reviews! Thank you!

These were very good.  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  In the future I will adjust the shortbread portion to fit the pan size.  Too much shortbread when this is also doubled.  I should have known better!

These are really sweet, little rich butter bombs!  Could reduce sugar amount... Cut them small! I made the mistake of cutting one recipe into 16 pieces, which were way too big.  Could've halved that amount...   came out of my silicone pan just fine or line with parchment.  Cut after cooling.

First time I had these was 20 years ago in Scotland.  My husband loved them.  The only difference was they were mint flavor.  So I substituted the chocolate chips with Andies mint chocolates.

This turned out great! Is so yummy! One thing that I'd change though is melting the chocolate chips in a double boiler on the stove instead of in the microwave. I had to toss out my attempt at melting the chips in the microwave. But the taste of these bars is very good!

Easy and delicious.  I read all of the reviews after I made the recipe.  Maybe I should have looked first, but I didn't want anything to color my opinion.  My only tip is to stir the caramel the entire time it is on the stove.  I'm going to make it again and add some sea salt.  It needs a little depth of flavor.

I made this as directed, although cooled the shortbread in the freezer ten minutes (as suggested by others) and stirred the caramel for 2-1/2 minutes after removing from heat, as it was thickening so much I feared I wouldn't be able to pour if I waited much longer. It's ok but I expected it to be fabulous with all the rave reviews. My husband said "those are weird," followed by "they're ok." With making three layers, while not difficult, not worth the effort. They do not taste like Twix - that's my husband's favorite chocolate bar, which is why I chose to try these over making cookies. Additionally, the crust seems to have too much butter and stays soft and crumbles when you slice it; so, some didn't hold together. Disappointing.

yum. I made this for a dessert contest and won! But disclaimer - I didn't put on the chocolate layer since my chocolate seized while melting it - my fault, I did it over stove and got water in it (my microwave isn't working). But the shortbread and the caramel was delicious as is! I made shortbread using my own recipe although it's almost the same - i add a pinch of salt as taught by my very Scottish grandmother. The caramel I made almost exactly as per instructions. I started on low heat as others advised but after about five minutes, I brought to a gentle boil on medium/medium high, stirring constantly. Then I took it off the heat and stirred for a good three minutes more. I scored the shortbread and then chilled them before putting the caramel on.

My other change was that I made them in silicone mini muffin molds that I always do shortbread in. In this case, little men and hearts Wilton brand) . Came out of those so easily and in good sized portion.

These are actually fairly easy to make. I read the reviews and did this: put in the freezer between each step. I put wa paper on the bortom which made it easy to transfer but I had to peel some of it off the shortbread so not sure if that's the best method. The shortbread needs to be hand pressed into the pan. The caramel needs to be watched closely and stirred a lot and needs to boil for a few minutes to get the right consistency and for the butter to mix in properly. I tried putting a bit of butter in the chocolate once and I don't think it made a big difference in spreading it but might have been a bit messier cutting it. I put in 5x the ingredients which I put into 3-4 pans and made that three times... I was doing a bake exchange. I mixed in some dark chocolate to cut down the sweetness because these are rich! Finally I added some coarse sea salt on the top after the chocolate layer... after all its salted caramel! It was easier to cut for me when the chocolate layer had been in the freezer a few minutes but wasn't completely frozen.

I took these to the office and people raved about them! They are super easy to make, just remember to lower the heat on the caramel sauce once it boils and keep stirring! Also, line the pan with parchment paper b/c they are hard to get out once cooled.

It was good but next time I  will use my shortbread recipe - less crumbly. My caramel recipe - a little firmer and more buttery. And not so much chocolate, even though I  halved what recommended amount, it overshadowed the other flavors.

These turned out awesome. I didn't change anything about the recipe except I baked the shortbread in a 7x11 square glass casserole dish lined with parchment paper. This upped the cooking time to 26 minutes...either than that I sticked to the recipe.

TO CUT SHORTBREAD WITHOUT BREAKING, IT NEEDS TO BE WARM!  RECOMMEND KEEPING BAKED BOTTOM ON THE OPEN OVEN DOOR UNTIL READY TO SPREAD THE CARAMEL, AND IT WILL SPREAD MUCH EASIER WHEN BOTH LAYERS ARE WARM.  CUT THEM NOW IN THE PAN USING TIP OF A SHARP SKINNY KNIFE!!  REFRIGERATE, AND LET THEM SETUP IN PAN; THEN SPREAD MELTED CHOCOLATE OVER WELL-CHILLED CARAMEL. RUN THE TIP OF THE KNIFE OVER YOUR PREVIOUS CUTS THROUGH THE SOFT CHOCOLATE, RECHILL.  THIS MAKES CUTTING AND SERVING A  BREEZE AND NEAT--NO CRUMBLY PIECES!

I've made these the past few Christmases and always get compliments.  The only thing I do differently is add just a tsp or so of shortening to the chocolate to give the tops a nice sheen.  As with any recipe where you are boiling a caramel, the directions should be a bit clearer for those that may not have tried their hand too many times with candy making.  once it comes to a rolling boil, stir constantly.  this will prevent sugar from burning.  Also, don't boil over a high heat but over medium high heat til it comes to a boil then a medium heat.  you have to take your time and not rush it, and your caramel will be just the right amount of firmness without being too soft or too hard and tacky.

Is there a 10 rating???I expected them to be crunchy on the bottom but to my surprise, they were soft. (that's good!)
I'm a maritimer so I'm REALLY fussy about my baking. 
All I can say is HOLY MACKERAL!!! They are sooo good. The only change I would make is to put them in a slightly smaller pan. 9x13 seems a bit large. Next time, I'll use an 8x10 or so

I've made these bars years ago and love them. Didn't write down a recipe so with a quick google search picked this one. Made the short bread which seemed fine, started the caramel and it was a disaster. It burned the first time I cooked it on medium high, the smell of gross milk. I thought maybe the condensed milk I bought was bad (which I bought today) so I smelled the left overs in the can but nope it's fine! Since it only asks for half a cup, I tried to make the caramel again on low heat. Once it FINALLY got to a boil it burned again. I don't use poor quality pots and I'm not a beginner baker. Took the shortbread out of the oven and it was a weird crumbly texture, not like short bread I have made before, it would have just crumbled if you cut it. With no more condensed milk (stuff is expensive) I threw it all out and now my house smells like bad condensed milk and no bars to enjoy. I'm not sure maybe try it in a double boiler or a different recipe? I remember using condensed milk for this years ago so not sure what the issue was here.

These were delicious. I did burn the caramel the first time round. Then tried a double boiler but it did not get hot enough to bubble so put it on the very lowest heat on the stovetop after it started to barely bubble and kept stirring. I did not think it needed anywhere near the time in the recipe after 3 min. It was ready. I did freeze the shortbread layer while i made the caramel and that worked well.  Very sweet .i may try little darker chocolate next time.

I made the recipe with the following changes and it turned out very good.  I wanted a bigger pan so I increased the amount of ingredients by 1/2 what was called for (i.e.:1/2 cup became 3/4 cup, etc.). Then I made it in a 13x9 pan.  The crust crumbled a little, I did score the chocolate before it got hard and I lined the pan with aluminum.  The caramel was great.  The other change I made was that I increased the times by 1/2 also, and I kept the caramel at a lower temperature, while it boiled and stirred it.

They were great! I added a pinch of sea salt to the caramel (our butter is unsalted) and used dark chocolate instead of milk. I think next time I'll use less chocolate so the focus is more on the caramel.

These were sooooo good!  I added crushed walnuts on top and the flavors reminded me of toffee.  Don't make the caramel until the crust comes out of the oven because the crust needs to cool.  I had to reheat the caramel because I made it too soon.  Still came out good though!  You will need a napkin as the crust is crumbly!

I followed the recipe except I added a little salt to the caramel mixture and a little extra butter to the shortbread mix.  The caramel mixture did thicken a lot but didn't go stiff (as it looked in the video) plus I used fat free condensed milk (the milk leftover I froze for next time). I kept the heat low and stirred it pretty much the whole time.  Next time I make them I would probably use less chocolate; it was a little too much for me and overpowered the caramel but I did use bittersweet chocolate.  A small square was about all I needed to remind me of the Millionaires Shortbread that I've had in the UK.  and as they are so rich, plus it helped from overindulging.  I'm going to freeze some and see how they keep so I can limit my intake, lol!

My husband and I made this for a picnic. Went over beyond well and in fact making another batch right now. The only change we are making is baking the shortbread ahead of time b/c the caramel mixture was done before shortbread and ended up getting grainy (and my husband gained more muscle on one arm from the constant stirring!). Excellent recipe! And easy to make! Loved it!

These a fine, but super-sweet and kind of bland.  Nothing special about them. Probably a crowd pleaser, depending upon the crowd. Even a few hours after making them the shortbread went... not soggy, exactly, but just kind of disintegrated in your mouth with no crunch.  

I followed the recipe, but took other readers' suggestion and used semi-sweet chocolate. Glad I tried it, but will not make again.

This recipe is almost identical to a family favorite - Mary Barrs Bars - named after my daughter's beloved kindergarten teacher who used to make  them.  I prefer the method used in this recipe, but the taste is still wonderful and sweet - just like Mary was!

Although it is fabulous the way it is (I am so thrilled to come across this recipe because the caramel layer does get gooey and leak after being cut - yay!) - I make a chocolate ganache top layer.  I simply heat up some cream (I didn't measure but about 1/3 to 1/2 cup) bring it to a boil, turn off heat and then add the chips.  Wait 5 minutes, stir until smooth and then pour over caramel layer.  I also used dark chocolate (chips and/or bars) :)

The shortbread was quite soft and extremely crumbly and the caramel tasted like a burnt marshmallow.

Just like a Twix bar but way better! Be sure the shortbread layer is completely cool before adding the caramel layer. So don't start making the caramel until then. I only had an 8 x 8" pan...worked out just fine.

Easy to make.  I used dark chocolate chips.  The caramel was hard but softened in our mouths.  I guess this is because we live at high altitude and I needed to cook it less.  Will definitely try this recipe again at sea level.  Who doesn't love chocolate caramels?

Me and my friend made this since she didn't have much ingredients. Anyways, IT. WAS. SO. FREAKING. GOOD. 
The only problem that we had was that we cooked the caramel a little bit too long and it turned out to be mega hard.

P.S.
To those who said: "I've followed the instructions, but the caramel was too hard," please read the TIME. If the caramel is cooked too long, it WILL harden like a brick!

(You see I said that twice so the future cookers won't mix it up... XD) 

I will definitely do this again!

I really didn't like these. My husband does, but he seems to be the only one. I was hoping they would be like the caramel squares I used to eat in Australia, but they aren't quite the same. The caramel layer is good and I may use that for making other things, but the shortbread crust was not that good. Make sure to use light brown sugar if you try these. I only had dark brown sugar the first time I made them and it did not turn out as well as with light brown sugar.

I make this recipe all the time but the chocolate cracks so I decided to try something different and I tripled the shortbread part of the recipe and put it into small muffin pans to make cups. The cups must bake about 10 minutes and be pressed down again after they've risen and then baked for another 8 - 10 minutes and then cooled for about 10 minutes or until firm enough to remove from the pan. Then you must spoon in the caramel and let set and then spoon on the chocolate. You must triple the shortbread so you have enough cups but the caramel and chocolate part doesn't need to be increased. The result is higher ratio of shortbread to caramel and chocolate and it's a little more prep work but they come out much nicer looking and easier to handle and eat!

I describe these as Twix Candy Bar  Bar s.  They are really delicious, and easy to make.  I did follow the advice some gave as to doubling the recipe.  I added some vanilla to the caramel mixture once I took it off the  heat.

I have the EASIEST solution for the best chocolate topping. Simply sprinkle an entire package of semi sweet or milk chocolate chips over the hot caramel.  Leave one minute then use  a knife to spread smoothly over entire batch. So quick and easy! Cool completely then cut. The chocolate cut without cracking. Perfect squares.

These are so delicious.  Be sure to stir the caramel the entire time, and keep on low, or else you will burn it.  I learned the hard way.

Awful. I always make things exactly how the recipe is written the first time around, but this was an absolute FAIL and a waste of ingredients. The crust and the milk chocolate on top were fine, but were ruined by the glass-hard caramel in the middle. Couldn't cut it without the chocolate lifting off the top and the caramel (and then the crust as well) shattering. It's not even really edible unless you lift the caramel off and put the now shredded chocolate on top of the crust.  I was unsure about the cooking time and directions while making the caramel, but I followed the directions anyway and I'm SO sorry I did.  Was planning on taking them to work tonight and now that's out and I have to figure something else out cause I don't have time to mess with this recipe now.

I love these squares, they're really easy and quick to make and they went over really well with friends and family! A great go-to recipe. I didn't make any changes, but note to ensure the base is cooled when you begin the caramel, the first time I did this I started the caramel when the base went into the oven and it was ready too soon and began to firm up before the base was ready. Second time I waited until the base was in the fridge and the timing worked out perfectly! I've made it about 3 times since and it always turns out great! Would make more chocolate than directed for the size of the pan, I always get a very thin layer. Enjoy!!

The cookie is very tasty!  It was a hit at the cookie exchange.  It's the flavors of a twix bar except the home-made caramel is even more delicious.  A couple of things to know however:  the milk chocolate chips were impossible to completely melt and provide a creamy chocolate topping.  I tried a double boiler and nuking it in 20-second bursts as recommended, but it still came out dry and crumbly.  Another thing to consider is that it take way WAY longer than 35 minutes to prepare! If you keep these things in mind and find a way to make the chocolate creamy, I would dare to say this is one of the most delicious cookies I've ever made!  Oh, P.S.  USE PARCHMENT PAPER when you prepare the recipe or I'm sure it would be a royal pain to get these out of the dish intact.

This was a fun and delicious cookie. I wish I had used parchment paper, though. It would have made it easier to remove. I also should have cut the squares prior to the chocolate completely hardening, because it crumbled a bit. Still delicious!

I've made these like 10 times already. I've used dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate chips. They all taste amazing. Really easy to make, even a person like me that can mess up every recipe, you can't mess this up. Just make sure you use real butter and not a baking sticks.

These are amazing! I had never done short bread before and these turned out great. Used common sense and stirred the caramel the whole time and melted the chocolate chips in a double boiler instead of the microwave. Big hit with everyone who tried them.

Great recipe!   The only changes I made was to add .5 tsp. of salt & .5 tsp of vanilla to the caramel to give it a little more depth of flavour.   Everyone  I've served these to loves them.  So easy to make I will definitely add them to my favs. 
Thanks Julia!

I made it and it came out awesome, However i did a little tweek.  After melting the chocolate chips for a minute, i added a teaspoon of water to it, this turned the chocolate into a crumbly type texture and i put that on the top, and my husband ate the whole thing before i could even get a slice.  So hopefully i can at least get a chance to try my tweek next time. :)
  Happy baking!

just made these for the first time. There was not enough of the caramel. Melted chocolate in double boiler with small amount of butter.  Let layers cool between adding the next.

This was my first dessert like this and I absolutely loved it!!! I will say there are a few steps but it is not anything crazy difficult that requires special tools. Just be patient between steps because it is crucial to let the shortbread cool all the way through. Also I would suggest letting the carmel cool for longer than the recipe says. I did follow the suggestions about the chocolate chips. I put a table spoon of butter and a little milk to make it smoothier.

The caramel is too hard to easily bite into. It would be better to define the heat of the boil or less heat + shorter time = softer caramel!
As following instructions "bring to a boil" apparently does not mean high heat. Just a slight boil probably would have been better(6-7) But since this wasn't defined well many people from looking at the reviews after, had the same problem! (HARD caramel not "chewy".)  Cutting them into tiny pieces and letting them dissolve in your mouth works, but with the shortbread you want to chew, and you just can't. Refine the caramel recipe and these would be great!

 As for the chocolate chips you can't microwave it too long after the initial one minute or it will turn clumpy + crumbly rather the liquid smooth.

These were really good, but I agree with the other reviewers, the chocolate topping needs to have milk or heavy cream added to make it work.   The next time I make these I plan to drizzle the chocolate over the top and use semi-sweet to cut down on the sweetness.  And reduce the recipe by about 20% so that these fit in an 8" X 8" pan.

These were easy to make and yummy. I did use dark instead of milk chocolate to cut the sweetness. Maybe add a few chopped nuts on top for variety. Would make again.

I made this for the first time with my 11 year old twins for a party we were attending that night.  The only thing we did wrong was we didn't let the carmel sit long enough, (so it wasn't thick when we spread it,and it should have been chilled for longer.  Otherwise, they were a huge hit and eveyone loved them.  We will make themm again for sure!

3 adjectives: crumbly, sticky, sweet.  Using a double recipe and a 9 x 13 inch pan, the crust was too thick and crumbled when cut.  The caramel was a thin layer on top of this too thick crust.  I topped half with milk chocolate and the other with white chocolate (because of cocoa issues in family).  Both sides were really soft. So, thin layer of soft caramel over thick crumbly crust with a soft, very sweet layer on top. Not very sophisticated and not easy to eat.

This was fabulous!  I did put extra chocolate on the top; next time I will also add more caramel and put pecans in it.  The only problem is that the shortbread base tends to crumble when eaten, but that is ok since it is soooo good.

So, spend time getting it right with the caramel. Spend the same time melting the chocolate. Totally ruined chocolate with microwave just to save a couple min.
Good otherwise

I just made this and it is is the fridge. OH MY THEY TASTE GOOD!!!! I think this is a great recipe! I do have a few tips before trying it though. It is better to double the recipe with a bit more butter in the shortbread . And to wash your pans and pots right away! It is a choclatey caramely job. If you let it sit it will be like glue! So as soon as you finish with it ,soak it in soapy water then wash. Also let it cool befor adding the chocolate.  It is very good! Good luck :)

Excellent recipe as is but I can never leave well enough alone! I increased the chocolate to 3/4 of a cup milk and 1/2 cup semi-sweet--made a very rich milk chocolate layer that tasted yummylicious!

I made this cookie recipe with some minor variations when I lived in England 20 yrs ago. This recipe is a bit easier and quite delicious!

These were AMAZING!!! The only thing was - there are t specific instructions about the caramel layer (ie. should the burner be on medium heat? High heat? Should we stir the mixture? My original attempt at the caramel portion burned badly.

These were very good.  The only complaint that I have is that the shortbread was too crumbly.  Next time, I may add more butter to the shortbread to make it more moist and less crumbly.

Added a tablespoon more butter and it worked much better.  I also cooled the bottom layer, put caramel on, and cooled again!  Much better!

Very rich and great flavor! Made these with my son and they turned out great.  We let the shortbread cool for about 15 minutes and then spread the caramel on while they were both still hot.  The caramel mixture does burn if you have the heat too high.  Will definitely make them again!

These are really tasty. Just don't put them in the fridge they go like a rock and then you can't cut them.
Also, I don't think during the 5 minutes boiling that the carmel should be touched but the recipe omitted that.
But if you like shortbread, carmel and chocolate you will like this recipe.

I am a very experienced cook and baker.  The caramel was very good.  I lined the pan with non stick foil and it came right out.  Upon cutting them, the shortbread crust  just fell apart.  It tasted very good, but because of the problem with the crust crumbling I probably won't make it again.

HUGE hit for my holiday cookie extravaganza.  Make sure to let them cool completely before cutting, so much easier!  Next time, I will probably stick the shortbread batter back in the fridge for a few minutes before pressing into the pan.  Makes the butter a little easier to work.

Fantastic recipe. Such a light buttery Carmel. Very easy to make as well. I found adding some evaporated milk to melt with the chocolate chips helped the chocolate topping along to become a smoother silkier recipe.

Great recipe - easy to do but as one reviewer mentioned, a few details were missing.  I cooled the shortbread in the fridge for 10 min while I worked on the caramel.  I had used semi-sweet chocolate chips but it scorched too easily, so I finally used 70% baking chocolate which is less temperamental and worked better.

I followed the recipe exactly, aside from adding a tad of butter to the chocolate.  It was easy to make, but the end result was disappointing, with the caramel being hard. Would not make again.

This recipe was overpowered by too much butter. It came together nicely and had a good texture, but the amount of butter in it was just too much. I would not make this again.

These are amazing!  I followed advice from other reviews and doubled the recipe in a 9x13 pan, let the shortbread cool completely before pouring the caramel, and used semi-sweet chocolate chips.  They are SO rich and delicious, and were a big hit at my office cookie exchange.  Will definitely make again!

Amazing. I have not yet added the chocolate layer because I don't want it to get that white film when I freeze these bars. I'm debating not even adding it, because the piece I sampled already tastes so amazing.

I had to substitute the corn syrup with a "simple syrup" from all recipes and used treacle sugar instead of brown sugar. What a hit!!! These are fantastic.

Absolutely delish, Julia! Thanks for this easy, decadent dessert that's perfect as is. I made sure to keep stirring as I boiled the scrumptious, thick, Caramel mixture or it would burn; then really whipped with a spoon as Julia instructed after it's off the burner. Also, please check oven time with Shortbread layer as mine was done before 20 mins; ovens vary. Did my Shortbread layer in the food processor & worked fine. The Milk Chocolate layer was REALLY a nice touch! This was a hit for Mom's Birthday treat: a keeper.

The caramel came out nice and soft, I followed the instructions exactly.  I took the advice of others and lined the pan with parchment and I let each layer cool completely, no problems cutting the bars. The only thing I'd criticize is that the cookie base was bland and crumbly.   I think I'd try to fix the base and use better chocolate for the top rather than chocolate chips.

I had a ton of requests for this after making it.  I too used a 9x13 pan and lined with parchment paper before baking the crust, cooled my crust in the freezer for half hour before pouring the caramel on.  I used good quality dark chocolate wafers and melted them with a tsp of shortening.  To cut, use the biggest and sharpest knife you have.  I had no problems with crumbling.  This year I am going to add a layer of peanut butter/icing sugar mix on the crust, freeze and then add a caramel and chocolate.

These came out absolutely delicious. Like a commented before me suggested, I put the baked shortbread base in the freezer before topping it with caramel. I don't think I'll be able to eat a Twix bar again without wishing it was one of these!

This recipe is great! One thing thought, give the squares enough time to cool and enough time for the chocolate to get hard.  These caramel squares taste better with time! They were a favorite for my New Year party! Will definitely make again!

Followed other reviews, used parchment to line pan, let shortbread cool. Did not have any problem getting them out of the pan. I did add 1 tbs. butter to choc. chips. I think maybe just a different shortbread could make this 5 stars imho.

These are very good, however my shortbread crust was way too crumbly - I think it needed to cook a few more minutes.  The caramel layer was a bit difficult to spread, so I wadded up a piece of plastic wrap and used that to press it down - worked like a charm! I had to sub semi-sweet chocolate chips because the cheap milk chocolate ones I had on hand seized up on me when I melted them.  That was fine with me because I actually like semi-sweet better!  I lightly greased the pan and had no problem getting these out.  Very tasty and actually pretty easy to make, I'm just not completely thrilled with the bottom crust but I'll definitely try again!

Fantastic!  I did cool the shortbread for quite awhile based on other recommendations.

Awesome and super easy to make.  I used semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate since we're more a dark chocolate kind of family.  They got rave reviews from our guests!

Great recipe. I used the suggestion to double the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan and it turned out fantastic. One thing I did have trouble with was pouring the chocolate over the caramel layer (chilled of course) - the chocolate displaced the caramel so I ended up with parts of the pan with thick chocolate/thin caramel and parts with thick caramel/thin chocolate. I will definitely make these again and perhaps cool the chocolate a bit or leave the caramel in the fridge longer so I don't run into the uneven layer problem.

The recipe states 40 SERVINGS, not squares. Thus, 9 X 9 = 81 one inch squares, two squares per serving....as shown in the photo.  However you cut it, these are delish.

The recipe should read to cut a 9x9 pan into 1 inch by 2 inch squares, in order to get about 40.5 pieces. Since 9 inches doesn't divide evenly by 2, depending on whether you cut the pan into 9 x 4 = 36, or 9 x 5 = 45, you still won't come out with "40".  Most of us eyeball it anyway.

The bottom turned out a little crumbly.  Taste was great.  Would make again but not to take to a gathering.  I would worry about the bottom falling apart.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting this recipe!!! I have been looking for a recipe for these for so long and this turned out perfectly! My whole family couldn't believe how good they taste.  I stirred the caramel non-stop over a medium heat and let it cool a little (till the surface was slightly firm to the touch) before pouring the chocolate on.

I thought that this recipe was a little bit too sweet, so I had to cut these into extra small bits. Next time I will reduce the sugar.

I used a tube of pre-made sugar cookie dough as the base as a shortcut. When I have more time I will try it with the shortbread base. I also used dark chocolate. Great recipe!

I have had better millionaire's shortbread before. This recipe only gets 3 stars because it isn't very CLEAR.  It does not say if you're supposed to stir the butter/milk/sugar combo in the pan or just leave it. Since it says ti beat it after it has been boiled for 5 mins. I assumed you're supposed to leave it alone (when you melt sugar you're not supposed to stir it until a certain temp.) I did that on a VERY low heat and found that the sugar was burnt and the caramel was grainy and had a lot of black bits in it. So the second time (I threw away the first batch), I melted the butter first, then added the condensed milk, then the syrup and then the sugar, mixed it and let is get to a boil on the lowest heat possible and yet again, the sugar burnt. I accepted defeat and used it anyway, it tasted very good, just like twix but it just didn't look smooth or golden.  The shortbread too, was grainy, nut velvety smooth and buttery rich like the shortbread I'm used to. I looked up other caramel shortbread recipe and almost all call for caster sugar and not granulated sugar, which would result in a finer shortbread. Also, on its own it tastes bland, I'd suggest to add some salt to it.  All in all, it tastes good but isn't great, I'd definitely look for a different shortbread recipe and stir the caramel the whole time until thickened.

These taste just like a Twix! Next time, I will use my own shortbread recipe (only because I like it a little better), and I'll use a 9x13 pan, and double the caramel and chocolate.  Definately will make again. Shortbread is a Christmas tradition around our house, and these are a nice twist. Very simple.

Very yummy cookie.. great for a cookie swap or when you a larger amount for a party. I had some 'issues' with my shortbread crumbling, but the pans that I made using metal or ceramic worked the best.

The taste was fantastic, along with the caramel. The crust could use help though. It falls apart way too easily. I have a shortbread recipe that is perfect and that is what I am going to use for the crust from now on.

These were so good and so easy to make. It's a very pretty dessert with the 3 distinct layers. I used dark corn syrup instead of light but I'm not sure how/if it affected the taste or cooking process. After reading other reviews, I let each layer cool before moving onto the next step. I've been storing it in the fridge as I've found that leaving it out makes the chocolate start to melt. It's very rich indeed so you really should only cut it into small squares.

I think that if this was tweaked a little bit it would be better. If I make this again I would cut down on the butter in the caramel to maybe 1/4 cup or less. It was a little too sweet so maybe cut down on the chocolate as well. I think with these adjustments it would taste better. Thank you!

I made three separate batches. the first was hard as a rock, the second very tasty and soft, and the third inbetween the two. The trick is to cook it the right way- scraping the bottom on a heat slightly below the heat recomended

The short bread did not set at all, one big crumbly mess when trying to take out of the pan. Now I LOVE shortbread, tasting the "crumbs" of this, there is not much taste to the cookie portion. The caramel part turned out good, even though I scorched it a bit, the little scorched bits actually taste like caramelized sugar, thankfully it didn't ruin that part.. The choc was easy. If I could cut them out and have them stay together, I'd probably give this a 4 star.

Excellent squares and simple to make. Cutting them was a bit tricky and they looked a bit messier than the picture, but they tasted awesome.  I should have read the reviewers tips before making them.

This was the best dessert I have ever made! The crust was so buttery and flakey, the caramel so easy, and the chocolate just accented the whole thing perfectly.

The bottom was rich and buttery and when combined with the chocolate and caramel it was perfect for my sweet tooth!  Remember to be careful when making the caramel...there really is an art to it.

This is the best square ever.  The only thing we changed was to drizzle white and semi-sweet chocolate over the top instead of making a solid layer of chocolate.

Pretty good.. the shortbread needed plenty more butter to make the dough workable. I see that people have had a problem with the shortbread falling apart, that's because it needs more butter.. I believe I used about 1 TBSP less than a half a cup and the shortbread came out great! Also reading the reviews comparing these with twix candy bars kind of ruined the experience for me.

I really didn't care for these.  I thought that the caramel lacked flavor.  It definitely needed salt to enhance it.  These just tasted very greasy but low on flavor.  I threw out the recipe.

These are ok.  The shortbread is a little crumbly, not sure what happened there.  I don't know if I would make them again as they aren't that healthy and a lot of work.

Great recipe.  The flavor is wonderful.  I added a couple tablespoons of butter to the chocolate (personal preference), but that's the only modification I made.  As other reviewers have noted, the shortbread part of these bars can get crumbly.  For that reason, I wouldn't take these to an indoor event, but for eating at home, they're amazing!

These are too good!  For those who didn't feel like the caramel had enough flavor, try adding a pinch of salt to it--you won't make it salty, but you will bring out its full flavor.  Add a couple of tablespoons of Crisco to the chocolate chips to help them melt smoothy (and I'd use the stove, not microwave).  Don't overcook the shortbread--it should still be white and soft when you remove it from the oven and it will set as it cools.  Thanks for the great treat!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully. I also hand kneed shortbread because i find it comes out softer and less crumbly so i did this before pressing it in the pan.

I also dyed my caramel filling pink (see photo) for added effect, and added candy on top of each piece.

This recipe was a hit !

These are very, very good!  I used a sheet pan though so they weren't so high.  And still cut them small since they are very sweet.  I will be making these again for sure.  They freeze well too.  Yum yum.

Just like candy, a great square.  I found you really need to follow the directions for the caramel carefully to develop the caramel's flavor. I followed the suggestion to chill between layers and it worked well. I also used semi-sweet chocolate onstead of milk chocolate. The shortbread base was a little crumbly but overall it is a very nice square.

it was something lovely and different to add to my christmas baked goods. i took other reviewers' advice and poked my shortbread with a chopstick before baking. then i cooled it in the freezer while i made the caramel. i even overcooked the caramel slightly and they still tasted fantastic. i should have mixed the chocolate with half and half because they were really hard to cut without squishing the caramel out the sides. when i make these again i'll be sure to use half and half, and cut them when the chocolate is still a bit soft. even when they don't look as pretty as the picture, they taste FANTASTIC!!

These were great.  I took the advice of one of the reviews below and cooked the sweetend condensed milk on low.  Definately something I will make again.  However, I doubled the recipe bc I didn't think it would be enough.  I had plenty to serve and a bunch left over.  They are very rich so we didn't eat a bunch like we would normally do some of the other desserts that I make.

Oh my God, these are soooo good. The only changes I made were using semi-sweet chocolate chips and dark corn syrup (That's all I had on hand) and they turned out amazing! I did cool each layer before putting on the next and I used a double boiler for the chocolate. They are SUPER easy and delicious. I think everyone should try them. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a BIG hit with my family. Everyone loved it. I used an 8 x 8 x 2.5 inch baking pan, but I believe it was better this way; it was thicker, and more moist. THIS WAS DELICIOUS! Thank you so much! I will definitely make these again.

Ugh! This was a disaster. Followed the recipe exactly. The shortbread was too thick, the caramel layer to thin, and the chocolate never set up. Also, the shortbread seperated from the caramel/chocolate layers. 
I don't know what people are doing differently to get the pictures their taking but mine looked nothing like those!

I thought these were pretty dang good.  I've never made carmel from scratch so messed up the first batch and had to make it again.  The picture is a little deceiving as it isn't as thick as it looks in the picture.

These tasted good, however they looked horrible.  My shortbread crust actually came out very good.  I refigerated over night before I put the other layers on but my caramel did not get hard enough (i followed the recipe exactly) and my chocolate did not spread onto my caramel layer right.  It just looked really bad but it tasted great.  I probably wont make it again though.

I had a little difficulty with this recipe.  The shortbread dough was stickier than I anticipated and it crumbles off of the other layers. I did prick the shortbread with a fork after it came out of the oven and I cooled each layer before adding the next in the freezer.  I don't know if I cooked the caramel layer too long (I followed the directions exactly) but it is really hard, more like hard candy and I had a difficult time cutting the bars.  I ended up following another cooks advice and freezing the pan overnight then breaking the bars into pieces by hitting it with my rolling pin.  That didn't help the shortbread to stay attached either.  Taste is really good but presentation isn't so great so I am just sharing this with the family and not putting it on any cookie trays.

I followed the recipe exactly, just added a little bit of the left over evaporated milk to the chocolate layer to make it softer and easier to cut.

Mixed reviews on this one... but I wouldn't make it prevent you from trying them. For one.. you do not want to add too much flour to the shortbread layer....it will crumble and be a disaster. Also.. on the caramel layer do not cook it too long.. it will get too hard. This recipe is a bit of an art to perfect... but when you do it is worth it... although I had friends who loved the first batch that I thought turned out horrible.

Well, I intended on letting everything cool before adding the next level, but I did something (who knows what) wrong with the caramel so... it's edible, but certainly not what I was hoping for.  I do think I will try these again though; give it more of my attention and time next time around.

Sooooooooo yummy.  However, the crust was a bit crumbly.  Also, my chocolate layer didn't come out very shiny/pretty looking.  The overall taste though, is amazing!!!!!  I agree that it tastes like a Twixt bar

I used the concept and caramel from this recipe.  The caramel is like dulce de leche.  I made shortbread from "Scottish Shortbread IV" and dipped them in the caramel and again in melted chocolate. The caramel was a bit runny but They were a huge hit! I will try making squares like these also - it will be quicker.  I'm not an expert at candy but I think we should stir the caramel a bit throughout the boiling otherwise you may get bits of browned caramel from the bottom.

This was one of the best cookie recipes ever.  The second time I made them, I made 50% more shortbread and chocolate - I like this proportion better, with a thinish layer of caramel.  I agree that they stay together better with fewer crumbs if you cut them at room temperature.

Really good, decadent recipe.  I may have overcooked the caramel layer a bit, since it was hard as a rock (normal?), but it still tasted good.
Although delicious, I probably won't make it again - it's a bit too much for the tastes of my family.

These were not a favorite.  The presentation is nice but the taste is just "ok."  The shortbread layer had no flavor and was crumbly.  The directions didnt state to cook the caramel over low heat so I did it over medium-high and it turned too dark (i think i burned it, but it still tasted ok).  The chocolate layer was good but does come apart from the caramel.  All in all just not worth the effort.

These were absolutley wonderful.  I don't think I changed anything in the recipe and they turned out great!  I did poke holes in the shortbread crust prior to baking it.  If you do that make sure you don't poke all the way through.  I will make these again and again.  Thanks

I accidentally put this review on the wrong recipe--this is the right one.  These are really good. I also have trouble with things like caramel, but the cooking time stated was perfect on medium heat. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and agree that milk chocolate would have allowed the caramel flavor to emerge more. My only other piece of advice is that after chilling to set the chocolate and cutting into squares (not easy because the chocolate and caramel are VERY firm when chilled) you should let them sit at room temperature for a few hours to soften them up a little--in fact, next time I will probably also wait until then to even cut them into squares.

This didn't work for me. Shortbread did not hold to the toppings and crumbled away. The remaining carmel/chocolate cut up was like a candy. Okay taste.

I love this recipe and the helpful hints from everyone.  I wanted enough for sharing with co-workers, so I tripled the recipe. It fit very well in a 11"X17" jelly roll pan. It used up a 14-oz. can of sweetened condensed milk. Because of the increased quantity, I added a few minutes to the boiling and baking times. Lots of yummy squares for me..I mean, all.

These were SUPER good.  In another review, someone said they taste like a Twix bar, which is absolutely true.  I made a double batch in a 9x13 foil-lined pan, which worked great, although I accidentally used 1.5 cups of butter rather than 1 1/3.  I let the crust cool in the fridge for a while after it baked, then cooled the caramel layer until it was set, but still slightly warm in the center.  The chocolate didn't quite cool all the way before I had to cut them, but it still worked. I got about 7 dozen out of this, but I also cut them really small.  GREAT recipe.

These taste so good! I'll be making them over and over! Just like a twix bar! Don't cut them just out of the fridge though - they'll break up, and the chocolate will separate from the rest of the cookie. Next time, I'll cut them at room temperature.

I followed the directions exactly and the bars were easy to make and turned out very well.  The bars are extremely rich, so make sure you cut them into small squares.  One rater thought the recipe stated to add the condensed milk to the chocolate, but the recipe calls for the milk to be addedd the carmel layer.  So read carefully.  I made these as a new addition to my Christmas cookies.  I think they will be a new favorite.

I love these.  These are one of my favorite treats.  HOwever, I only gave them 4 stars as my bottom layer crumbled a little and separated from a few pieces when I was taking them out of the pan.  I also let them sit a room temp after being refrigerated so the chocolate wouldn't separate.

These definatley will be a keeper as one of my favorite holiday treats!

These turned out great.  I used a tube of refrigerated sugar dough as the crust to save time.  Also, be sure to boil the caramel mixture at a low temp or it will burn quickly!  Very rich, keep in small squares!  A great treat for the holidays!

These were a huge hit, I got nothing but compliments.   I read other reviews and had planned to make adjustments accordingly but my oven decided it was the perfect time to not heat properly.   I ended up having to bake the shortbread much longer than expected due to this little glich.   Meanwhile, I had the caramel all ready and waiting so I let it sit.   By the time the crust came out the caramel was cooling very nicely and getting thick.    I let the crust cool for 15 minutes or so (I used a stoneware pan) and then poured, or rather spooned the thickened caramel over it.   I thought it might be a potential disaster but it was warm enough that the caramel spread out nicely...a pleasant surprise.  I didn't add anything to the milk chocolate chips...they seemed to spread just fine and set up well.   I did put the whole thing in the freezer for about a half hour to help with the cutting.   They were perfect!   Thanks so much for sharing, I will be making this often.

These were okay.  I thought the shortbread crust tasted fine, and I didn't have a huge problem with the layers not sticking together.  I did have trouble cutting the bars, even though I took them out of the pan to cut.  The caramel was TOUGH!  It was hard to eat them too - I imagine if I'd tried to eat two or three in one sitting, my jaw would have been sore.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not sure what I did wrong.

These are really good!  They are nice and thick- you need a glass of milk with these.  They reminded me of a Twix bar.  Yummmm :)

They taste great, but the shortbread disintegrated when I cut them!!

Instead of making the caramel layer, I melted 43 Werther's soft caramels with 1/4 cup of whipping cream, 4 min on medium in the microwave and then stir until completely melted.  Much easier and less chance of screwing it up.

So delicious... I made this for a fundraiser afternoon tea, and I heard nothing but compliments. It sort of has a Skor bar taste to it. Just wonderful.

This is a great recipe as it is not an overpowering sweet falvour. I make the shortbread into little rounds the diameter of a tea cup. After baking I make a half serve of the caramel and top each round with a spoon of the caramel then cover with melted chocolate. Make great little gifts for work friends or as a little thankyou gift.

These are amazing! I don't know what the issue was for everyone else--mine were not too crumbly and the layers set up beautifully. They are very rich & decadent. I will definitely add them to my holiday baking favorites. Thank you!

These were okay but I didn't think they were that special.  Of course any time you mix together sugar, butter and chocolate it ends up tasting pretty good but these just didn't do much for me.  I would suggest for those who think they are too rich to substitute semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I agree with other cooks, the bottom shortcake is very crumbly and hard. It tends to stick to the pan anyway and the squares don't cut nicely. BUT, the taste is undeniably good and the recipe is quick enough to put together.

These were absolutely delicious.  I made them to take to a bake exchange but after sampling them I made sure to keep several for myself.     The only change I made was I used semi sweet chocolate and reduced it to 1 cup (and even in an 8.5x12 pan this was more than enough).

These are absolutely delicious. 5+ stars!!!!!! I made them on a whim, the recipe looked good plus I had all the ingedients on hand. I took these to a party and everyone went back for seconds, thirds, and so on. Used the whole bag of milk chocolate chips and sprinkled with chopped walnuts, will try with semi-sweet chips next time. A little hard cutting, but if you use a nonstick pan, coat with nonstick butter spray, you can get the whole thing out and cut on a cutting board, just run the knife around the edges to loosen first.

These are the hit of the Christmas boxes. They are delicious. I had a little trouble with the caramel, accidently doubled the recipe and had to use the whisk to belnd it better. Make sure to do the double boiler method to melt the chocolate, also add butter or margarine to make it smooth and shiny. I melted it in the microwave the first time and even with the addition of margarine, it still came out pretty  looking. Not actually as much work as I thought so I will be making them again.

I am a caramel lover, so this recipe really appealed to me.  The caramel and chocolate part of these bars are great, but I was majorly disappointed in the shortbread.  It was awful.  No taste, just crumbly and blah.  I may try this recipe again with a different shortbread on the bottom.

Awesome, rich, decadent cookie!  I used some of the other advice and put parchment paper in my baking dish first (I also doubled the recipe), let each layer cool before adding the next.  My only 'problem' was that I apparently didn't cook the caramel long enough, as it never really set 'firm'.  My cookies were gooey, but no one seemed to care!  Will definitely make these again!!

I make these every year at Christmas time.  These are by far a favorite in our house.  I actually just realized this year that I have been adding too much condensed milk (1 can rather than 1 cup) so this year's batch was improved.  I do like to make 50% more of the shortbread layer and double the caramel layer, keeping the chocolate layer the same, just for a better proportion.  I line the 9x13 with foil to get them out of the pan without any problems so I can cut them easier.

excellent!  these were fun and easy to make- though it took a lot of elbow grease to stir the caramel and keep it from burning.  next time, i would let them caramel sit a little longer, maybe 1/2 - 1 hour.  i greased the pan before baking. i also put some in the  freezer to save for a few days- i hope they are ok!

This might have been said before, but in Australia these 'caramel shortbread squares' are called caramel slice and are a very common dessert. I've looked everywhere for a decent recipie for caramel slice as no other country seems to have heard of it. Glad I found this one!

These tasted great but the presentation was lacking just a bit.  I followed the recipe (online) exactly.  Everything went well until I went to cut them.  The shortbread was just a bit crumbly and most of the chocolate layer seperated from the carmel.  I would make these again for an informal/at-home party where presentation isn't really an issue.

It looks very pretty, but it is too rich.  Maybe cutting down the caramel centre down might cut down the sugar content.

I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk and found that to be yummy.  Loved the caramel and chocolate topping but I was a bit disappointed with the shortbread crust - it seemed too dry, crumbly and tasteless.  These reminded me of a Twix bar but the cookie part was not buttery-tasting enough for me.  Took this to a party and no one really enjoyed, don't know if I'll be making again.  Thanks, though.

Warning...do not make these unless you have ALOT of people over or you might eat the whole pan like I did! These are the best cookie I have ever had. I told my sister about them also. She made a pan when she had company and they were gone quick.

These were great! I mixed in some dark chocolate chips for the top layer and loved teh result! I did have a little trouble with the caramel mixture burning to the bottom of the pot a little before it came to a boil but when I stirred the mixture afterward, it mixed back in and you couldn't tell at all! They were great... I made a double batch and sent them to my inlaws. Hope they like them as much as me!   >>>>>> I also used this caramel for homemade caramel rolls, AWESOME!

This is the best cookie bar on earth. The only thing I would recommend is to be sure to stir the caramel the entire time it boils or you risk burning it. Otherwise it's perfect. I make it with dark chocolate usually though.

Wow, really amazing!  I doubled the recipe so I wouldn't have so much leftover condensed milk.  I'll still do that next time, although I probably won't double the chocolate chips.  It's just too thick a layer.  My caramel layer never did get "hard" so it's runny but it is so good I just don't care!  I put foil down on the pan and they are very simple to get out!

These seemed very easy to make, but were very difficult to cut.  The shortbread would fall apart when cutting causing me to lose about 1/3 of the batch.  They tasted very good though.

The shortbread was not sweet enough and I tried to make the caramel twice and it never set.  I followed the directions exactly.  I will never make this again.

I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 dish, delicious indulgence BUT a few things:

- too sweet: maybe use half the amount of caramel and chocolate (unsweetened choco chips- I added some pecans)
- shortbread was too crumbly, use less flour
- cutting into small bars was even too rich, I had to cut them into bite size slices
- lots of chilling time required, for each layer to harden

Great recipe!  You definitely need to time the caramel perfectly. I use a candy thermometer.  I also like to drizzle a little white chocolate over the top of these bars to add some contrast!

Growing up in Scotland this was always one of my favorites.  I had never tried to make it before as I thought it would be difficult.  This recipe proved me wrong!  As long as you make sure you tend to the caramel while boiling as not to burn it, the caramel is fairly easy to make.  I had no problems with it sticking and/or breaking when I cut it and I followed the recipe.  The only thing I did differently on my second batch was to pour a little less chocolate on top as I felt it took a little away from the caramel in my first batch.  Definitely worth it and I will be making this alot.

Mmmm...these were so good and easy to make. I put each layer in the freezer while I cooked the next layer, it worked great.  I didn't add the extra milk or cream to the chocolate chips, they spread just fine.  They crumbled a little as they came out of the pan, but nothing too bad.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

These were really great!  They were like a homemade twix with a soft crust!  I did cut a few tablespoons of butter here and there without problems.  I also used fat-free sweetened condensed milk.  I only used a thin layer of chocolate on top so it wouldn't overwhelm the caramel layer, my favorite part!  Pretty quick to make for such a delicious treat.

I dunno what went wrong, but the chocolate was too hard to cut and the caramel too soft and the crust too crumbly. They looked nothing like the picture. And they tasted way too sweet, but were very tasty:). I would recommend cutting them before the chocolate gets too hard though.

These were awful.  The crust was dry and crumbly.  The caramel was hard as a rock.  I couldn't even cut them.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I ended up tossing the chunk away.  It was a waste of good ingredients.

These are VERY sweet, almost too much.  I made two batches and was able to melt the chocolate chips on top of the warm carmel layer(as another review suggested) just fine once, but on the second batch it didn't work (maybe I needed to watch them closer) and I had a mess - part of the chips were semi-melted, others not at all and it looked terrible.

I had the same problem as others who used the cookbook and not the website.  There must be a definite difference in boiling the caramel for 5 minutes as opposed to the 22 it says in the cookbook, because the caramel center came out rock break-your-tooth hard. Ended up tossing it. The whole thing would be delicious if prepared correctly and I'll probably try again and only boil for 5 minutes as it says here on the website.  Wish I had referred to the site first!

I only gave it a 3 star but was hoping for a 5 star turnout. I made this from the AllRecipes cookbook and boy were the directions way off!! My caramel was more like a hard toffee, but my crust turned out wonderfully. The chocolate didn't melt like I hoped but next time I think it's better to review the online recipe rather than the cookbook. Someone did comment that for a recipe that didn't turn out the way it was supposed it, it still tasted great.

Loved these.  They are terrific and a new holiday favorite!  I did spray the pan with pan spray generously and score the bars before they got too hard.  Took them to work and had lots of requests for the recipe!

I followed other reviews and poked holes in the shortbread.  No problems at al with it all holding together!!  Mine didn't come out looking like the picture.  Mine are very thin, and I'm not sure why.  They still taste very good.  And they're good enough to go into the mother's day basket I made for my mom.  I'll play with these and see if I can get mine to look more like the picture.  Thanks for sharing this easy recipe!!

I thought this recipe was very good. I am glad I read the reviews before I attempted the recipe.  The carmel was so good, that I make it all the time now but simply put it in the fondue pot and keep it warm and serve with sliced apples or over ice cream!!!

I'm sure if I had actually used butter instead of margarine these would have turned out.  That's my fault.  I haven't even taken these out of the pan yet, but the caramel layer is so hard I don't think I'll be able to.  I have a question for all of you who have made these before and love them, "What's the correct time to boil the caramel layer?"  The website says 5 mins while my cookbook says 22 mins.  As you can guess I made these from the book instead of consulting the site.  I thought it looked pretty caramelly but decided to follow the recipe and let it boil an additional 10 mins.  Oh well like I said it's my fault.  I will try again because all of you said these were great and I have faith that with all I've learned I can do better.  Thanks for great advice and a promising recipe.

Fantastic!  I used a 8" pan instead of the 8" pan and baked for an additional 10 mins.  Will definitely make this again.

This is a very tasty recipe.  Was a little disappointed in the caramel, thought it would be chewy,but it wasn't.  Also I thought the bottom shortbread layer needed something.  Next time I think I might add some ground pecans or something.   Other than that the recipe was very easy and turned out perfectly.

Oh my! These were very good.I love caramel and shortbread(I could personally be happy without the chocolate).I made them for Christmas.The first few were a little tough to get out and got mangled so I had to eat them...(I couldn't present the mutants to my family)They were so rich that even after 10 or so people had sampled them there was still 3/4 of the pan left & I ended up leaving them at my grandmother's house and couldn't remember where my only 8x8 glass pan was. Next time I will cut them & transfer them to a serving/storage container.I think I'll try it with about 1/2 the chocolate on the top.

These were average.  Too rich for my liking.  Probably would not make again.

I am not a big shortbread fan but my family is and they love this recipe.  I made it several years ago and it was a hit. I am making it this year because of requests. I will do the chocolate on a double boiler next time. I am not a fan of micorwaving and it didn't work to well for me. 
This will most likely be a Christmas cookie staple around my house.
