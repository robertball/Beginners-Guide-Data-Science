Great EASY recipe, although i used leftover brocolli instead of carrot. This would be a substantial meal without white rice as i used leftover roast pumpkin which added bulk to the meal. My only other tip would be to use fresh finely chopped garlic, oh and add water if it is 'sizzling' as the water will evaporate - saves using oils and added fats.

I sliced the onions, garlic and carrots.  Since I used white pumpkin, I used the natural colored sesame seeds.  I cut the amount of salt in half.  We are glad we tried this delicious recipe!

Really good! Had this as a meal w brown rice. I am very glad to have this recipe, and will definately cook it again. Who would have thought pumpkin would taste so good with soy sauce, pepper & garlic!

This would taste better with meat....and Jack Daniels.  I made it and then immediatley threw it in the trash.  It wasn't good enough for my cat.

I really enjoyed this dish.  Although, it is labour intensive because you have to start from scratch with a pumpking - but the bonus is the roasted pumpkin seeds you get out of it too.  My husband didn't care for it, but I have only learned recently that he doesn't really like squash, so it's no surprise.  I like it because it's tasty and filling - and healthy!

Pretty good.  I was out of carrots, so I left that out.  I served it over wild rice cooked with a vegetable bouillon cube.

This was pretty good but could use some kind of sauce - it's kind of dry. I added crushed red pepper because it was a little bland. Next time I'll add some  peas. I served it over rice for dinner but without rice for lunch the next day, and I didn't miss the rice. It was better the next day. I'll make this again.

this dish was my first time to use a pumpkin for anything other than a Jack O'Lantern. It was a little salty for me, i think i will not use as much soy sauce next time. Otherwise very tasty!

This was definitely different than anything we have ever made before and although it wasn't my favorite we still finished it off.  We did use a "normal" halloween pumpkin instead of one of the cooking pumpkins which might have thrown off the flavor a bit.

The pumpkin doesnt have  a whole lot of flavor. I used toasted sesame seeds and added a red pepper.  It was pretty good, but the pumpkin takes so long to cut up that I am not sure if I will make it again. Regular stir fry is fine by me.
