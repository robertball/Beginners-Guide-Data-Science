This was wonderful and I am eating the leftovers as we speak!  The only change I made as to subsitute olive oil for the margarine and real chopped onion instead of the instant minced.  It was the perfect summertime dinner.  I served it on a bed of brown rice cooked w/ chicken broth and green onion.

Fabulous!

This was delicious!  My husband made it and he made a few changes:  he didn't use any butter, instead he used cooking spray; instead of the instant minced onion, he used 1/2 onion; instead of the garlic salt, he used 2 cloves of garlic; he also forgot to include the tomatoes but it was still delicious.  We served it over brown rice.  It was quick and easy.

I made this and it tasted lovely! My only concern would be that even for 3 people, 1lb of smoked sausage was not enough. I would go for between 1.5 and 2lb's of sausage for a really filling main meal. As the smoked sausage already has a high salt content, I would also refrain from adding any extra salt in future too.

This recipe was really yummy and easy too.  My kids liked the sausage and I added chicken too.  The biggest thing was that my VERY picky husband loved it, but score.  I will make this one again.

Good Lord is this tasty.  I used smoked turkey sausage and one can of diced tomatoes drained.  I browned the sausage in a little Cajun seasoning for extra spice.  It reminded me of Etouffe without the seafood.  I think some sauteed shrimp would be excellent in this dish as well.  It's one of my new favorite meals.

This is a tasty dish.  I followed the recipe as is with a few substitutions. I sauteed the zucchini in olive oil instead of margardine.  Instead of minced onion, I used 1/4 cup of chopped onion.  And, I used one clove of minced garlic instead of the garlic salt.

I served it over some brown rice.  My family and I really enjoyed it.

I go to this recipe when I'm short on time. So quick & easy. I used a can of diced tomatoes & minced onion instead of dried. Sometimes I add yellow squash & serve with polenta.

Very good, quick and easy!  My 14 year old was on his way out the door to football when it was done, so he grabbed a flour tortilla and loaded it up, and ate it on the run!  Next time may just make it for tortillas!

I combined comments from other reviews- I sauteed the sausage first, as directed with Tony Chachere's seasoning to add some heat and then set aside. I cooked the zucchini covered with a can of diced tomatoes (not drained) combined with 1 tsp vegetable bouillon, more Tony Chachere's seasoning, onion powder, and a little salt until the zucchini was tender. Then put the sausage back in to simmer for a few. Very good. The diced tomatoes added some moisture to the dish, which we liked- this was a very good meal.

This was so good that even my 4 yr old and 20 month old finished it off.  I substituted yellow squash instead of zucchini squash only because the grocery store was out of zucchini. It worked well even with the substitution and without the tomatoes.  Very quick and easy!!  Thank you so much!!

Wonderful, easy, quick dinner.  I used turkey sausage, and because I was using a non-stick pan, I didn't even add the margarine.  We had this over white rice, and everyone really liked it!

Very good!!!  We grow zucchini in our garden so I'm always looking for ways to fix it.  This was very good.  I used garlic powder, basil, oregano from my herb garden and our garden fresh tomatoes. Served with potatoes instead of rice.  YUM!

It was simple to make and it had a superb taste. I made a few changes . I used 1 chopped oinon instead of the instant mined onion; instead of garlic & salt I used 4 cloves of garlic chopped; and 1tsp of olive oil instead of butter. I also added red and yellow peppers and a dash of worcestershire sauce. I served it over brown rice. The family loved it.

Just made this and am adding it to my recipe box.  Tomatoes aren't quite ready in the garden, so we left those out.  I used granulated garlic and butter instead of margarine.  I c3ooked as directed and then added cooked pasta and cooked for an additional few minutes-my husband has had 3 servings and my son loves the "pinkies" (kielbasa).  Love it!

This was very good and quick to make too. I misunderstood and cooked the tomatoes into the veggies which made a nice sauce. We had it served over rice. I suggest using real onion, a clove or two of garlic and a bit of bell pepper to the saute!

I love this recipe - even my son (who is not a fan of smoked sausage) really liked it.  The zucchini takes on the taste of the sausage.  I did use home canned tomatoes and it came out just fine.  Will definitely fix it again!

I thought this dish was a bit too spicy and on the dry side.  All I really tasted was the smoked sausage, and barely detected the zucchini and tomatoes.  I cut the zucchini into slices, and when it was time to add back in the sausage and the spices, I let it cook for 5 more minutes; then I stirred in the diced tomatoes and let it cook another 5 minutes, in hopes the tomatoes would let off enough juices to make it moister.  If I cook this again, I may try a can of tomatoes instead, and add another zucchini.

This is an outstanding dish.  One of my new favorites.  I changed a few things. I used olive oil instead of margarine.  I used smoked turkey sausage to cut fat and calories.  And then at the end I stirred in the tomatoes and sauteed just for a minute to warm them and blend the flavors.  This was absolutely delicious.  This will be a staple during the summer using produce from my garden.

I have to be honest - I wasn't really expecting much out of this but I am pleasantly surprised!  This was quick, easy, and really inexpensive!  I used half a can of strained diced tomato and added them to the pan during the last few minutes of cooking.  I also used a low fat smoked sausage.  The only thing I think this lacks is some sort of sauce.  Otherwise, this is great.  It's going in my rotation.

Fabulous recipe. I used fresh onion rather than the instant diced and I used diced Italian-style tomatoes rather than the fresh. Served it over pasta. Yum! I'll definitely be making this again soon.

I really wanted some new and different things to do with smoked sausage and this fit the bill for us perfectly. I think it is best with fresh from the garden plump juicy tomatoes and I NEVER heat the tomatoes (personal preference), just plop them on top of the brown rice simmered w/a cube of chicken boullion and the sausage/zucchini mixture and if the tomatoes are juicy enough you will have some moisture. When tomatoes aren't in season, a can of tomatoes works but it really brings the rating down a notch, I think. It's a quick and easy weeknight meal with lots of good veggies. I suppose you could add all sorts of other yummy veggies, too. I seve with french bread on the side and cut watermelon for desert!

After making several changes we really enjoyed this.  I added some red pepper flakes to the sausage while it browned.  Then I added a small chopped onion, in place of the dried minced onions and 1 clove of garlic with the zucchini.  I also poured in a can of diced tomatoes with juice and let it simmer for about 5 minutes.  Due to my picky eaters I knew they wouldn't touch the zucchini if it were only sauteed - too crunchy for them.

I'll give this 3 stars cause my husband loved it. It was not up my alley though and I could hardly eat it. I also love zucchini and sausage.. but I'm not a big fan of tomato type sauces.  I used the rotel diced tomatoes with chilis and also added some fresh garlic. I used garlic powder and added some salt. I also served it with brown rice. Because of the rotel it was a bit too spicy for my kids and they ended up eating raviolis.. I ate a tad and my Dh about ate all of the rest of it and saved just enough for leftovers for his lunch tomorrow. He asked that I make it for him sometimes to take to work for lunch...

We enjoyed this!  I did alter the recipe slightly by using smoked turkey sausage and adding a can of tomato paste with a little water to make a sauce.  Made with cheddar biscuits from this site...thanks for sharing!

I added chopped onion and celery and one can of "original" Rotel (chopped tomatoes and chilis).  It really spiced it up!  I cooked the rice in chicken broth.  Very good.

AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! This recipe is not only appealing to the eyes, but to your tummy as well. I served it with a side of rice and the whole dinner took a total of 20minutes to prepare. Definitely will make again!!

Excellent!  I usually change something about a recipe, but this one is great how it is.  My husband requests almost every week.  It's great for the summer, but add French bread and/or soup, and it's great for the fall, too.  The flavors mingle well together.

This was quick and easy and fit the bill on a budget! I had to use up a hamburger patty,so after the sausage was brown and crusty,charmarized,( that's the way to cook smoked sausage:), I also didn't have any zuchinni,so I substituted broccoli, and a chopped carrot,a fresh clove of garlic and used real butter in place of the margarine.Did not use organo,because I'm not a fan,but subbed out with dried basil. I served this for my hubbs,with sauteed chopped potatoes,while I ate mine with cauliflower rice. I can't wait to try this with zucchini and fresh herbs as this dish is very versatile.

Very good as written. I used a chopped fresh onion instead of the dry minced. And added a small eggplant since I had one. Easy and quick recipe.

I increased the spice with Old Bay and red pepper flakes. I also used four zucchinis, one real onion and 3 cloves of garlic to increase the amount. Besides oregano, I threw in fresh basil. Yummy

This is so good, especially if you let the sausage caramelize on each side. Then cook the zucchini, fresh onions and a bit of yellow or green peppers with some Cajun seasoning, make  a bit of sauce with broth or water and eat over white rice. Super fast and satisfying!

My whole family loved it! No one really wanted sausage but I had to cook it, so I searched for a different recipe and found this one! I used real onions and drained a can of diced tomatoes instead of minced onion and whole tomato. We all added spices of our liking once on plates...added garlic powder, salt and a bit more oregano...my picky eater son even went for seconds! Thank you!!

I used 1/2 onion chopped, and 2 cloves garlic. Also a tablespoon fresh oregano. This dish has lots of potential for variety by using different sausages. Garden fresh tomatoes really made it special!  Great recipe, easy and quick. Thanks!

I have made this twice. Tonight I sautéed 1/2 red pepper and added low sodium canalini (white) beans and a bit (1/4 cup) of vegetable broth. I served the dish over brown rice cooked in vegetable broth. I use low sodium ingredients but add herbs and spices to boost flavor.  It's fun to experiment with different ingredients!

Excellent.  A little bit salty but very good.  The sausage adds a ton of flavor so do not over season. Next time I may use fresh garlic or garlic powder instead of garlic salt and maybe just throw in a pinch of salt afterwards if it needs it.

Nice recipe that I'll make again. I used smoked turkey sausage, 1/2 T olive oil and 1/2 T butter sauteed some yellow onion and one garlic clove before adding the zucchini. At the end I mixed the tomatoes in until they were just heated. I sprinkled some kosher salt and crushed red pepper flakes on top before serving with white rice. I'll make again, and I think it would be great with some leftover chicken added or shrimp to make it stretch further.

This reminded me of stuffed zucchini without the work. I made a few changes using what I had and it was delicious. I had ground turkey and spicy italian sausage. I cook this up in a skillet then added the zucchini, FRESH chopped onion, and one can of diced tomatoes. I didnt use any oregano but served it over white rice (cooked with chicken broth) I never seperated the meat from the veggies. I kept it all in the same pan. This was amazingly easy and for someone like me (12 hour night shift employee) it was the perfect addition for my recipe box.

Great! I changed recipe a bit, I used can diced tomatoes as suggested, also used yellow squash, red bell pepper and used garden veggie rotini noodles. Flavor was awesome. I will be saving this one!

Really tasty and easy to make. We served on top of rice and also used some squash since we have too much from the garden.

Very tasty indeed. I used sliced onions and added 1/2 can diced tomato. I also used turkey smoked sausage. I cut way down on the garlic salt due to the fact that the sausage was salty enough. Tossed in cooked penne pasta and paired with a nice cold glass of Pinot Grigio!! This dinner was a hit with my hubby and I. Will definitely make again :)

This was fine to use up zucchini and tomatoes from the garden, and it was certainly easy enough.  But it was just missing something.  I think maybe if I do it again, I'll try to come up with some sort of sauce, but I'm not sure what.

This recipe is excellent!  It's quick and easy to make, and I had no problem substituting just a couple ingredients to make it vegan.  In exchange for real meat, I used Tofurkey sun-dried tomato and basil "sausage."  I didn't use any margarine, just a very good non-stick pan.  I also substituted chopped fresh onion for instant minced, and freshly minced garlic and sea salt for garlic salt.  I used halved grape tomatoes, but they might have been a little too sweet.  I served it with whole grain pasta, but this would go well with almost any grain, or even with greens.  I will definitely make this again and again!

This was delicious!  I really didn't think it would be that great but I had to get rid of some smoked sausage and found this recipe.  We were blown away!  We make it a couple of times a month.

oregano and the zucchini is not a good compliment to each other. it just doesnt taste good at all. This sausage is too salty to add more salt to it. Made this, and it wasnt good at all.

This was good, and I'll probably make it again. I added mushrooms and used fresh onion and garlic. I added the tomatoes in and let them simmer, which created more juice. In the future I would serve this with pasta and add some rosemary.

Hubby loved, but too spicy for me. Also, browning smoked sausage not enough. Cook it until done if using uncooked smoked sausage! (otherwise raw inside). Otherwise, fine

This dish has been served several times for dinner and I love it everytime, however I found that 1lb of sausage wasnt quite enough so I added .5lb. I did serve over rice. Enjoy! Must try!

Not bad, but not great either. I too thought it was a bit bland. I used 4 Johnston Smoked Turkey Sausages (what I had) and took some other reviewer's suggestions and used chopped onion and a couple of garlic cloves. I used fresh Parsley and McCormick's Worcestershire Pepper Blend and a small amount of sea salt to give it a little extra flavor. 2 Roma tomatoes seemed to be enough. I'm glad I tried it, but probably won't make again.

This recipe was quick and easy. I had the saute part done before my rice was finished! The only confusing part was the zucchini ... the way it is worded for cutting ends up in 4 pieces so I cut it lengthwise then sliced it into 1/2 rounds (like half-moons). The flavour was simple and it's a nice quick meal.

Very good.  I used fresh onion and sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on top.  Next time I will use fresh garlic and/or double the spices for a bit more flavor.  It's a bit tight to squeeze 4 servings out of this one, so definitely serve with rice.  It made a nice lunch but probably wouldn't have been filling enough for my family if I had served it for dinner.

I went by the recipe but did substitute fresh tomatoes for a can of rotel. I personally thought it was to spicy for my medium spice taste. Not sure if I would make this again. I don't know if it would have tasted any better with regular tomatoes.

Great!  A nice and different way to cook smoked sausage.  In addition to the zucchini, I also added some pea pods and diced carrots.  I was also concerned about the salt content, so I didn't add anything but a bit of pepper and fresh garlic. I have served this with rice, potatoes and sometimes pasta.  It's quick, filling and very tasty.

If you have leftover smoked sausage and don't know what to do with it, as I did, or zucchini, I suppose this is not a real bad idea. There was nothing really wrong with it, but it wasn't that great either. Like so many recipes here, it needed a bit more flavor since the zucchini is naturally a bit bland. The smoked sausage flavor wasn't enough to overcome the mushiness of the zucchini. Maybe someone can come up with an improvement on this dish. I think it should have possibilities, I just can't think of any.

We really loved the ease of this recipe, and the fact that it didn't require a ton of ingredients. For some reason, eventhough we followed the cooking instructions we ended up with the whole thing undercooked :-(  We removed it from the plates,and nuked it to finish the cooking. The sausages were fabulous, but the rest of the meal was quite  bland. We liked it anyway, and perhaps will try it again, but in our opinion it needs more flavor. Unfortunately we threw out the leftovers. I'd still recommend this recipe though. It's simple, fast, and it does taste quite "healthy".  Thanks for sharing.

YUMMO! I didn't have an onion so I used onion powder instead. It was still very tasty, but with onion it would be even better. This is a very easy recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Sounds very simple but it yields an awesome taste!  I didn't use garlic salt but garlic powder and I added onion powder.  Served over rice - it's great!

I changed this recipe slightly and my family loved it.  My husband said the flavors were wonderful.  I chopped the onion instead of mincing it, and I added a clove of garlic minced.  I also used a salt free seasoning and some fresh basil.

We loved this dish I took the advice of a reviewer and added the tomatoes back in with the sausage.  It was so very delicioso!

This was very tasty. I used a chicken/turkey sausage wirth seasonings in this, used a lot more zucchini, added real onion and minced garlic. I think the moxture could have used a little mopisture, like a bit of broth or sauce.. not a lot, but next time I make this I'll do something along those lines.

This was wonderful!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  He loves sausage, and I used a gourmet chicken/turkey sausage with cilantro.  Will definitely add this to my easy weeknight recipes.

YUMMY!  Easy too.  I used a can of diced tomatoes, drained.  This would be a good dish to serve over noodles.

Pretty tasty (but what isn't when sausage is an ingredient??!), and very quick to make.  I had a HUGE zucchini, so I only used half, cut into 1 inch cubes (the recipe was unclear to me... was I supposed to leave the 2 small ones cut in half only or cut into chunks?).  I also added the tomatoes when I returned the sausage to the pan so they would break down and make some juice.

Pretty darn good!  I used a can of diced tomatoes because I wanted some juiciness, and I made the proportions of sausage and zucchini about half and half.  Also cut the sausage smaller.  Really tasty, and something different to do with zucchini.

I made this for my family with 3 really picky eaters, and they loved it.  I servered this over whole wheat noodles.  It was delicous.

We loved it. I used olive oil instead of butter and it was excellent. I will make it again very soon.

My family's not too fond of zucchini and tomatoes, but they liked this dish enough to eat it. I will probably make this one again with different veggies.

My husband loves this recipe!  We like it served over spaghetti.  I probably fix this at least once a week, especially when zucchini are in season.

Not bad at all. Quick and easy. The zucchini turned out exceptionally well.
