This recipe is so interesting!  We love Dubliner and we're beer people so I had to try this recipe!  It has a good robust flavor, my only complaint is the bitterness that comes through a bit but I guess you would like that if you love Guinness, and actually the bitterness reminds me of some very sharp cheeses I've had before. I think this would be a five star for many, so I might make it again depending on the crowd.   It definately has to sit in the fridge for a while to get really good and it goes a very long way because you only need a little bit on each bite of pretzel. Thanks for the new and interesting recipe!

I would give it a 5 for myself but I made it for quite a few people who were not big fans of guinness or aged cheese.  I ate while drinking a guinness so I thought this recipe was wonderful as is.

I really love Guinness and cheese! This one had a great deal of flavor and the Guinness added a lot, but it lacked a bit in color and being cold. I heated it up and everything melted together perfectly and then it became a 5 star dip! I definitely would add something for color (I just sprinkled paprika) and definitely some fresh ground black pepper. Will make again.

This wasn't my favorite, but everyone else loved it!  As with most things, sitting overnight in the fridge blends the flavors and makes it more intense.

I was dubious about not heating it and having granular cheese bits in it.  I was correct.  I was not happy with the flavor at all, so I baked it for about 15 mins, stirred it up and let sit. The taste improved a little.  I put it in the fridge with hopes that the flavors will meld.
