Great recipe!  I did make changes in preparation beginning with sauteeing the onion & fresh garlic and then adding chicken broth instead of the water. I did not thaw the spinach but did puree the spinach/broth/onion mixture before adding the cream base.  To cut fat I substituted 1 1/2 cups of half-and-half with a can of evaporated milk.  We will definitely be making this a lot -- easy and very satisfying.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband made this soup and it turned out delicious!  The taste reminded me of my mother's homemade creamed spinich, just more "soupy."  My only suggestion is, if you're making it for more than two adults, double the recipe.  2 adults and one 7 year old finished this off in one sitting.  We will make it again and we WILL double the recipe.  Thanks!

I loved this soup!  I used 2Tbls. of chicken base as I didn't have the chicken granules and part fat free half and half.  The taste was still great. The next time I will use all fat free. I purchased the chicken base from Sam's club. Don't add salt if you use it, as it can be quite salty.

Hmmm, interesting. Good for something new. I sautteed the onions and fresh garlic, then added the water and spinach( didn't bother to thaw), simmered, then added 2.5 cups whole milk, and pureed. I omitted the butter/flour roux. It needs plenty of salt and pepper, about 1 ts of each. And what I learned is...do not puree! Follow the recipe on that. Purreing it made the spinach kinda in your face while before it was milder. But the butter/flour part can be omitted...use a TB of flour or so if you want to thicken it. What I dislike about it( probably my own fault for pureeing) was that it seemed very rich, even without the butter/flour. I'll try again with 2 cups milk, 3 cups water, and not pureeing. Update: Ok, if you were disappointed in this like I was, stop eating and FREEZE! The reheated leftovers are SO much better! The spinach and milk taste much more blended together. I loved this for breakfast with Triscuits( No affliation, I just love Triscuits) crushed in and a little cheese on top...I'm usually not a fan of topping soups with stuff, but it so works for this. Parmesan and Monterrey Jack were both great.

This was super.  I used a little real onion minced finely instead of dried stuff but you have to mince it finely.  Added a pinch of cayenne powder & grated some nutmeg in it.  Super yummo!

Very good. Used fresh garlic, some fresh herbs, and some finely diced roasted red peppers to give it more flavor. Gets better the longer it sits.

omg, this recipe is awesome!!  my husband and I totally love it!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe.  I did do a couple of things different but didn't deviate from the recipe much.  I just added more garlic then called for and added some parsley because we like parsley in our soups.  Thanks so much for an awesome recipe.   We will definitly make this recipe again and try different veggies!!  Thanks again!

Since I didn't have half/half on hand, I used milk. It turned out a little thin, so I added a can of cream of potato soup at the end. Not the healthiest, but oh, my gosh, it turned out super yummy. The potato taste was actually really good. I also used fresh spinach, and it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good.. I used 1lb of fresh spinach in stead of the frozen spinach. Served it with some shredded cheddar cheese. I will be making this again.

Added about 1-3/4  cup of sharp cheddar cheese and 8 oz. lite cream cheese - fantastic! Also made with 32 oz. of broccoli instead of spinach. While cooking, I took out a couple of cups of soup and puréed in blender then added back to soup.

This is the best cream of soup recipe I have found.  I did make some alterations based on what I had available plus I wanted to cut back on the amount of fat grams. I used 2 cups of chicken stock and instead of 3 cups of half and half, I used 1 can of evaporated milk, 1 cup of 2% and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  I also sauteed an onion and about 3-4 cloves of garlic before I put it in the pot.  Fantastic!

I sauted fresh garlic and onion. I also used fresh spinach,cooked it and chopped it fine and used the water from it (which is full of vitamins) instead of water.  Instead of half & half, I used half heavy cream and half milk.  Awesome soup!

This recipe is good except I would cut the bouillon down to 2 cubes, add 1 cup of thinly sliced mushrooms that have been sauteed in butter, and top off the soup with 1/2 cup champagne or dry white wine. This is how the local Italian restaurant does it - and it is heavenly

YUMMY!  I didn't change a thing and all my dinner guests raved about this soup.  My picky 2 year old liked it so much that he was drinking it straight from the bowl!  This is a keeper!

Fantastic! I did make a few changes though. I used fresh spinach and homemade vegetable stock instead of the water and bullion cubes; blended the spinach mixture in my ninja before adding to the cream; cooked fresh garlic and Parmesan cheese in the butter; used whole wheat flour and half & half instead of regular flour and milk; seasoned with celery salt, onion salt, and cayenne pepper, and added chopped mushrooms before letting the soup set. Omigosh it is soo good. I'm going to pour it over homemade sweet potato raviolis later.

I'm looking for healthy, so I made changes. Sauteed onion in butter, didn't use flour, used milk (less calories & fat), and chopped up fresh spinach. Very tasty. Next time I may use chicken broth, so there's not MSG from the bouillon.

I liked this. It was fast, easy and delicious.
I sauteed the onions as another reviewer suggested. I added ginger and cayanne (yum!) and I used milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 as that is what I had.  Will be making this again....*smile*

Made this soup today, it is very delicious has a nice creamy taste.  I made some changes I use fat free milk instead of the half and half to cut down on the the fats.  Also, I did not have frozen spinach but I had fresh spinach so I chop it very good and it was OK to cook with.  Other than that I fix this recipe as written.  This is a keeper!!!

this was great!  much better than i expected.  I didn't have half and half on hand, so I had to use whole milk, but it was still delicious.  I made my husband, who usually doesn't eat spinach, try some and even he said, "Yum!". he even said he wanted the leftovers for lunch the next day.  i put some shredded cheese on top and i did saute the onions, but otherwise followed as is. definitely will make again!

I changed it up quite a bit but thanks for giving me such a great head start.  I'll surely be making this again, especially when the winter comes around.  I used heavy whipping cream, added shredded carrots, a couple potatoes and curry powder.

I had to alter it a little since i didn't have half and half. I used evaporated milk instead and it tasted very good. I enjoy this and the left over tasted even better for some reason... :)

Very good soup! I made a few changes though.  I sauteed the onion until soft and then added water and bullion.  Then I added two large chopped potatoes and about 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I skipped the flour part mostly because I didn't want to dirty more dishes (I have a 5 month old baby and no time).  I used 1lb of fresh spinach and added it to the soup once potatoes were soft. After spinach was wilted I blended the whole thing with a hand blender until smooth.  We ate it with grated parmesan cheese.  Really great and so healthy!

This was delicious!  Took the advice of ChefAno1 and sauteed the onion with fresh garlic first, until tender. I also subbed broth for the water, and used 1 can evaporated milk and 1-1/2 c half & half.  I was wishing I had mushrooms to put in.   Next time!

I found this disappointing and quite bland. Had to add garlic croutons, bacon pieces and parmesan cheese on top to make it interesting.

My husband said it was perfect the way it was but I think it was little rich. I deviated from the recipe as follows: I sauteed 1 cup of onion with about 3 large cloves of garlic in olive oil then added the frozen spinach, water, and a few chicken bullion cubes. After that cooked for a while I added the entire carton of half n half which was 4 cups, and some pepper. I melted some butter and added flour to it and whisked, then added it to the rest of the soup. Brought that to a boil and served a few minutes later. Oh and I added about 1 more cup of water to make up for the extra cream. Pretty good! I want to try fresh spinach next time. I also think it might be good with some diced tomatoes.

Delish!!  I used cream instead of half-and-half and forgot to thaw the spinach ahead of time.  My husband thought it was a bit watery (aka, thin) but that could have been b/c I didn't thaw the spinach.  Either way, it's rich and yummy!!!

Very delicious. Used real garlic instead of garlic powder (1/2 tsp.) and used a mixture of fat free half & half and 2% milk to make up the 3 cups. My spinach was a bit wilty, this was a great way to use it up! I did add a bit of nutmeg and ground red pepper to season it, as that's how I'm most familiar with this dish. Thanks, we'll have this again!

My son saw the photo of this and wanted me to make it for him.  He loved it.  I used fresh baby spinach and topped w/the croutons.  My husband who doesn't like spinach even ate it.  I will definately make again.

Soup and Spinach, two great things brought together.   I used fresh spinach.  I waited till it boiled down and I put half of it in a blender.  To me, I wanted half soup and half something to bite into.  I also used WAY more spinach than the recipe called for.  I also used a whole onion, 3 tablespoon of chicken base and 3 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic chunks.  This is such a simple dish that you can be creative and not screw it up.  Thanks to the original poster of this recipe.  My belly thanks you!  :)

Used about 24 ounces of chicken stock instead of the bouillon and about 1/2 tsp fresh minced garlic to replace the garlic powder.  Added some corn starch at the end to thicken.  Decent flavor. Will probably taste even better tomorrow.  Next time I might add just a pinch of cayenne for additional kick.

Surprised how yummy this was.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I made an (almost) vegan & dairy free version by substituting the cream with 2 1/2 cups of almond milk and 1/2 can of heavy coconut cream.  If you subsituted vegetable stock for the chicken broth and coconut oil for the butter you'd be set! I also added in 1/2 cup fresh chopped basil in the last 2 minutes of cooking.  Delicious!  4 stars since I changed the recipe quite a bit.

Wow this was actually really good. I used fresh spinach and garlic (2) for the 5 servings. I didn't have half-n-half, so I used 2 cups of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk. I cooked the chopped onions and garlic for a bit before adding the spinach.

I love spinach, and with all the great reviews, I had to try this.  And I was NOT disappointed!  I - like many others - also used 1% milk in place of the half & half to cut down on fat and calories.  I took the frozen spinach straight from the freezer and put it through my food processor with the grater attachment to get a finer spinach - and it was fantastic this way!  It was a little thin, so I think next time (which may be as early as this week!) I will add a chopped potato and a grated carrot - as someone else suggested - to the spinach/stock mixture while it is simmering and then puree all that before I add the milk.  Next time, to make this even more healthy, I think I will use low-sodium stock.  I really enjoyed this - thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

I have an abundance of swiss chard from the garden so I made this recipe with it. It was fantastic. I sauteed the onion and fresh garlic as others suggested and followed the recipe as is for the rest. I was so pleasantly surprised. Have lots of frozen swiss chard in the freezer so I will be making this again and again. Swiss chard also makes a great dip with artichokes.

A great soup! The whole family loved it, even after being skeptical about "spinach soup." I increased the amount of liquid slightly (I wanted to use up the full quart of half and half) and also the amount of onions (a half of white onion finely chopped) but I kept the amount of spinach the same. It was great! I left it simmering about 30 minutes and it was very creamy and flavorful!

I'm a soup person, and make my share of good soup from New England clam chowder to Thai's sour shrimp soup to fresh gazpacho soup my family/in-laws and friends go nuts for...  But this soup has got to be the EASIEST, and is VERY delicious. It's going to be a regular in my kitchen from now on. I followed the direction exactly, and LIKE it.  I may try some creative variations such as chicken stock, fresh garlic, gound nutmeg, etc., later, but as is, it is an excellent soup. (It's a cold crizzling spring day here in northeast, and this soup is just perfect for day like this... full of soft spinach that's creamy and delicious!) Thank you for sharing!

Yum!  Modifications: Used vegetable broth instead of water.  Used 2 cups of half and half and 1 cup skim milk.  Added shredded jalapeno jack cheese for an even creamier texture and more pop.  (The cheese really brought all the ingredients together).  Also added some Worchestershire which rounded out the flavors.

I just had spinach soup at my husbands work and was craving it, so I decided to try making it. This was wonderful. I did saute the onion and fresh garlic first. And as I didnt have any half and half substituted one can of evaporated milk and fat free milk. It was great!!!

Tasty soup. I will cut way down on the butter next time. We thought it had a strong "buttery" flavor. I would like to try the base with asparagus.

I make this soup all the time.  It is a huge hit with my 4 year old daughter, and all my friends.  I saute an onion in butter and olive oil.  (I sometimes add 4-6 oz. sliced mushrooms).  Then I add chicken stock and the spinach.  Then I follow the rest of the recipe as written.  I like pepper, so I add a bunch to mine, but leave it out of the kids' version.  I like to serve it with homemade biscuits to dip into the soup.  Seriously... our favorite soup ever!

I've used this method with all kinds of vegetables (spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.) It always makes an easy, creamy, soup!  I use lowfat milk thickened with flour instead of the half and half to make it healthier.

Directions were easy to follow and complete.  Ingredients basically on hand.  This is a good soup, but for my tastes, it is not a favorite.  I will make it again, I just wasn't overly thrilled. PS. I did follow the recipe as written, unlike foodlover

This recipe was quick, easy, and tasted great!  I threw in a handful of chopped mushrooms and signifcantly more spinach to increase the nutritional value.  Next time, I will serve with crusty bread.  My family loved it.

This recipe is amazing! I used heavy cream opposed to half and half because I was looking for a creamier soup. It came out perfect!  It made enough for two people and my hubby and I really enjoyed it.  Thank you for sharing :)

This was awesome. I used 2 cups of canned vegetable broth and added a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes. I have to make soup next Friday for a church function. We celebrate the season of Lent, this is why I used the veggie broth. I am going to use this recipe for my soup. Thank you.

Only difference that I do is to blend it all up at the end.  I think it would be a strange consistency without doing that.

Excellent recipe- made a few small changes- I'm vegetarian so used Vegeta seasoning instead of chicken seasoning. Used 1 1/2 cup of fat free half and half with 1 1/2 cups of reg half and half to reduce the fat some.  My husband loved   it.  Will make it again real soon.

I followed other reviewers and sauteed the garlic and onion, pureed the spinach mixture after boiling, and added cayenne pepper and celery salt for taste.  With the extra additions, it was delicious and flavorful. In my husband's words, "better than expected."

Very good! Personal preference I used about 2T of sour cream instead of 1/2&1/2  and a single serving container of Chobani  vanilla & cinnamon Greek yogurt. And a bit of Mrs. Dash for added flavor.  I also added a sweet potato. Puréed all after cooking,  so yummy!

I made this a few weeks ago but I accidently used mustard greens instead of the spinach.  It was delicious and I will be making this again but will use the spinach this time.  I could not believe how good this was because I don't like spinach or mustard greens.  Looks like you could use any greens in this and it will turn out great.  I also used Chicken Broth instead of the water.  I made this again tonight 4/16/19 using the spinach and it was delicious.  Can't stop bragging on it.

I didn't have any half and half so I made it with milk instead. I also used 2 cloves of garlic chopped and chicken broth instead of water. I pureed it enough so that the pieces of spinach were smaller, but not smooth.

I changed it a lot by sauteing the onion and garlic in olive oil 1st, 2nd add water and one grated potato(for thickener)Puree in a blender and return to pot. 3rd use 1% Milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2. This cuts the saturated fat and calories immensely and will help your healthy lifestyle. Enjoy and live long!

Loved it!! This is perfect as written, only thing I changed was melted in a 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar, and a dash of white pepper into the flour and butter cream sauce. Just my preference for most of my creamy soups. It added just the right zing to an otherwise great recipe. Thanks!!

I've always been a fan of creamed spinach but I wanted this to be more flavorful and thick. I minced fresh garlic and softened it with the sliced onions in a bit of olive oil with salt and then tossed in the chopped spinach. I melted butter, (didn't touch the flour), cream cheese, heavy whipping cream, a spot of milk, and added some nutmeg, and a couple other seasonings. Paired beautifully with a grilled cheese and I'll be making it again soon. I might try switching up my own variation just for kicks.

I used a pkg of fresh spinach, 2 cups of half & half plus 1 cup of 1% milk, 2 cups of grated swiss cheese, 1/2 t salt. Easy to make. 
Melte butter, add onion and cook a few minutes  before adding flour. 1 min later add 2 cups chicken stock follow by spinach. Cooked several minutes, then blend with blender. Return to main pot, add white liquid and cheese. Stir until cheese melts. Taste and adjust spices.

I followed this recipe step by step to the T! And let me tell you, it is absolutely delicious! I was skeptical at first but, since I was so hungry and saw we still had frozen spinach bags in the freezer, I decided to give it a try. Luckily for me I got the exact ingredients and man, so good. I love all things spinach! And this definitely fills that crave. Thank you for sharing!

Amazing soup. I added thinly sliced mushrooms at the same time as spinach. Also replaced butter with olive oil. 

I sautéed onions first with a little bit of carrots, added flour gradually, then water,  chicken stock cubes, spinach and mushrooms.

Delicious soup! The only thing we changed was we used real garlic instead of garlic powder.
We also decided to add some bow tie noodles to change it into a filling entree dish! Next time we will probably add some chicken too! But it was delicious without the noodles as well ;)

I actually found this recipe looking for one to use up an excess of  fresh spinach and half and half before they spoiled!  My swaps were:  1 lb fresh chopped spinach for the frozen, 4 tsps of chicken base vs. chicken bouillon, and I used fat free half and half.  It turned out fabulous!  It tasted very similar to leek and potato soup (without the potatoes of course).  Quick, easy, and delicious!

This is a traditional Finnish recipe. We top with chopped hard boiled egg. You can also use stinging nettle in place of spinach, and I use full milk instead of half and half.

I used 1 1/2 pounds fresh spinach. I sautéed the chopped onion with 1 clove minced garlic  before adding the flour. I used 1 cup 2% and 2 cups 18% instead of  half and half. I added 1 tsp of salt at the end.

I made this vegan with vegan butter and plain soy milk, and I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and I used fresh spinach that was going to go bad. I blended half of the soup and added it back in which made it creamier. Very good

This soup ROCKED it! I used fresh spinach. I took the advice to salute the onion and garlic separately before cooking with the spinach. I used chicken broth in place of water. I pureed the spinach mixture once cooked, then added the milk mixture to it with about 1/4 sherry. I sauteed some fresh sliced mushrooms in butter and some sherry, then added to the soup in their sliced form. Be sure to salute the mushrooms for a really long time -- initially they release some water and there seems to be a lot of liquid with that and the sherry and butter, but keep going -- when the mushrooms caramelize, that is when you add them to the soup. It was DIVINE. Great recipe!

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I only made a couple of minor changes to it. I used a teaspoon of chopped garlic instead of powder. Then I melted two tablespoons of butter in the pot, and sautéed both the onion and garlic before adding the spinach.  I also used a can of chicken broth instead of chicken bouillon, and two cups of heavy cream instead of three cups of half and half. It came out good and thick the way I like it. This soup was easy to make and it was delicious!! My family devoured it!

This recipe would be great as is or with changes. Flexible is good! I used milk instead of half and half and it was still awesome.  Would be 'to die for' with the half and half!  Used fresh spinach because I had some that needed to be used - chopped it first. Didn't measure the spinach, but it was about half or slightly less of a one pound container. This seemed like a good amount. Added some sliced baby portabella mushrooms because we had them on hand and sauteed the onions and mushrooms first. The mushrooms are a nice addition if you like them. This base could be used for a variety of vegetables - broccoli, asparagus, perhaps a potato mushroom combo. I may try to reduce the butter next time to help on calories a little. A keeper!

YUM!  I chose this recipe because it was one of the simper ones I could find online.  It did not disappoint, and I will be making it again!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I also used "Better Than Bouillon" out of a jar.  It taste so much better than the canned bouillon or cubes.  Next time I make this, I'll make sure I have a big bread bowl that I can put the soup in.  It's a keeper!

I made this soup, with a few changes, and it was fabulous! I'm strict low-carb, so I omitted the flour and used heavy cream instead. The cream thickened up the soup nicely. I also sauteed onions and fresh garlic in butter before adding the broth and spinach. Finally, I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen. I didn't bother to chop it up or cook it ahead of time. I just tossed it with the broth and let it cook for 10-12 minutes or so, stirring occasionally. I also garnished with a sprinkle of shredded Parmesan. This is a keeper and I will be making it often!

Great recipe! Even for a kitchen amateur like myself, it was really easy to make.

I am vegetarian, so I skipped the chicken bouillon, but it still turned out delicious! I had half the amount of spinach, so I halved everything else too, and the proportions worked great. 

I only made this because I wanted to use up some spinach that was left over from another recipe. But, now I'll be making this all the time!

I loved,  loved this recipe. I've always wanted to try cream of spinach, so when I had all this spinach to use, I decided to make some. This recipe was fast and easy so I gave it a try and oh my gosh! is it good! I would not change a thing. I will definitely be making this one again. Thanks Donna

Loved this soup! I, like a few others cut down on the heavy cream and substituted with more milk (used lactose free), and added mushrooms (big mushroom lover). I've shared with everyone I know and all have loved it!

Both my husband and I loved this soup. I actually used 2% milk instead of half & half and it still turned out great. I took someone's advice about sauteing the onions first with butter. Yummy!!

Excellent taste--I kept wanting more. Instead of the half and half, I used one cup heavy cream and the rest skim milk (strange, I know, but it's what I had on hand). I omitted the bouillon and used chicken broth in place of the water. Next time, I think I'll try croutons on top--I was missing some texture. I'd also like to increase the amount of spinach.

This is very good, although I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and I sauteed the onions and garlic in a little bit of olive oil before adding the broth and spinach, etc. I also added a little bit of Lipton's Golden Onion soup mix to the broth because I was out of chicken boullion. Yummy!

Very good but too rich for my taste. Next time, I would like to substitute the 3 cups half and half for 2 cups half and half and 1 cup milk. Also, I made "Hot Dogs or Hamburger Buns" that I a few days prior that didn't turn out so well, I diced these hard buns up and added them to the soup.

I cannot get any half and half where I live, so I used 7/8 cup milk and 7/8Tbs of butter per cup of half and half required by the recipe.  I also pureed the soup.  It was excellent!  My 2 year old asked for 2nd's, 3rd's, and 4th's!  My picky non-soup eating 7 year old said it was the best soup he has ever eaten.  My husband and I both loved it.  This is a keeper for sure.

This soup is awesome!  I got ready to make it and realized I was out of spinach, but had frozen chopped broccoli.  So I ended up using broccoli instead, that was the only change that I made.  It was absolutely delicious!!  I can't wait to actually try it with spinach!  Oh, and I did sprinkle shredded swiss cheese on top, just because it's a personal preference for me with any cream soup.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

Nice!  I added a cup of minced Japanese mushrooms (maitake) and it was delicious.  Next time I'm gonna add a little thick cut bacon because that's how I roll.

Thanks for the recipe!

As far as simple creamy soups go, this is a great one. I didn't have enough half and half so I used milk and about 1/3 cup of cream cheese. It was delicious. I also sauteed the onions and fresh garlic and used chicken broth instead of water.

I used frozen winter squash because I was out of spinach and it was wonderful.  I used fat free milk and added some powdered coffee creamer to lower the fat.  This is a good basic recipe for most any vege - I think I'll try it with potatoes and use bacon instead of the butter.  Wonderful recipe, thank you.

I pureed the soup after it was done because I didn't like the consistency. I also added a healthy dash of hot sauce and topped with parmesan cheese when serving. It's pretty good. Will make again.

This is a keeper! I made it for lunch on a rainy day and now I'm making it for a dinner party tonight. Delicious! I substituted fat free half and half to reduce the fat content.
