I wound up making this twice bc the 1st time my hubby poured all the servings into Allrecipes coffee mugs! Ha! Anyways, this is delicious and would work with any flavor of ice cream you like. Switch out almond extract for vanilla if you're not a fan (I am a fan!). Thanks for sharing!This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program

This was a hit!  It's as good as it looks.  I drizzled chocolate syrup on the sides of the glass and topped with the whipped cream and crumbled chocolate cookie. Everyone loved it and requested more.   I highly recommend this refreshing drink,  perfect for your summer cookouts.

This was a really cold and refreshing drink for a hot day when I needed a little caffeine boost. I will be making this again but using vanilla extract instead of almond for personal preference.This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program

I doubled this and made for me and hubby it was DELISH!!!!!!! I wanted more when It was gone. Followed the directions as is and was perfect amount. I have to say it was difficult to find the Gevalia cold brew in stores I looked in three different stores and wound up ordering it from Amazon... so worth it!

Easy to make and  no crazy ingredients. Made this for my husband. He loves cookies & cream ice cream and iced coffee....so this was the perfect combo. He thought the almond flavor was a tad overpowering to the coffee, but said he would definitely drink this shake again.This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program

My husband loves anything with oreo cookies, so, as soon as I saw this recipe I knew I had to make it!   The milkshake was fabulous!  The combination of coffee and almond extract with the ice cream gave it a wonderfully complex flavor that was so much better than a plain milkshake.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

We loved this recipe!!! I used leftovers of Oreo Blizzard Cake from DQ that we had on my little daughter's birthday. The almond flavor makes it delicious. Definitely making this again!!This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program

I've made coffee shakes likes this before--they are SO good. The cookies and cream was a nice flavor to try with it. I used vanilla extract and left out the half and half--really didn't see the need for it. The consistency was fine without it. The whipped cream and cookie crumbs on top made it even better. *This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program

Very easy and yummy milkshake. I used cookies and cream ice cream, almond syrup instead of almond extract, and topped it with whipped cream, caramel sauce, and chocolate sauce. I could really taste the almond flavor and it blended well with the coffee and ice cream. Definitely a new favorite and a great way to use cold brew coffee.
