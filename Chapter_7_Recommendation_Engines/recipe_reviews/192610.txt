OK, sounds like a five star exercise, but from faraway Australia, I am unsure whether to peel the eggs or not after cooling, any advice gratefully received. How long would they be expected to keep? And should they remain refrigerated? Thanks

Did not have the "pickled" taste I was looking for. I didn't think making the whole reciipe before confirming it's success made sense, so I quartered it but followed it to the "T."  I won't use this recipe again.

There wasn't near enough pickle flavor. I also ended up with double the liquid than I needed and baslamic vinegar is way too expensive to waste like that.The beet and vinegar flavors work nicely together with the eggs and I think this recipe has potential.
