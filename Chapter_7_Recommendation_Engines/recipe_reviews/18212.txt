After stirring the casserole half way through the cooking time, sprinkle the top with 2/3 cup chopped walnuts.  The nuts will toast as the casserole finishes cooking, and adds a teriffic crunch.  Walnuts are a great source of Omega 3 fatty acids, while millet provides calcium, B vitamins and fiber.  Millet is also a prebiotic.  It feeds the good bacteria in the digestive system.  Very healthy and delicious!

So tasty, easy to make, and easy to adapt!  My sons are allergic to soy and cow's milk, as well as coconut, so I had to tweak this--but it was super easy.  I just used some goat's milk as a portion of the hot water amount (I think I had about 1/2 to 3/4 cups left in the carton that I used).  Then instead of coconut I put in the same amount of dried blueberries.  They rehydrated nicely while baking and gave a lovely fruity flavor to the cereal!  The nice thing is that the dates (and the blueberries) give this all the sweetness it needs, so there's no need to add all sorts of sugar.

I'll be making this again, and I'll probably experiment with other kinds of dried fruits as well.

I have a similar recipe that I make -- only I use rum extract instead of vanilla and add a touch of nutmeg.  If you have leftovers, you can add more milk/soymilk and reheat on the stove, mashing with a potato masher to loosen clumps.  To really make it easy and rich, you can use eggnog (reg. or soy) when you make it or reheat it!  Very good.

Millet is such a healthy grain that I enjoyed finding a recipe in which to use it.  I loved this recipe.  I used about 3/4 c raisins instead of dates because I had raisins on hand.  Took some to my neighbor and she loved it too. 

I love that it has no added sugar, fats, or salt.  And I enjoy the one dish preparation that took only 5 minutes.

I'd eat this for breakfast, a meal or a dessert!

Good.  I didn't have soy milk powder, so I used 1 c vanilla soy milk and 2 c soy water. (I halved the recipe.)  I liked that it didn't have any added sugar, other than the fact that my dates were sugar-coated and I used sweetened coconut.  It was sweet enought to eat as it without adding sugar or syrup.

This wasn't a "knock your socks off" recipe for me but I still gave it 5 stars because it's simple, creative, healthy, and delicious!  I don't use soy so heated up 4 cups of coconut milk with 1 1/2 cups of water and used that instead.  Other than that I made the recipe as directed.  I can't wait to try it again with the addition of some cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice....possibly a rum extract instead of vanilla.  I read another review that included dried fruit such as blueberries....that sounds delicious to me and I'll probably try that as well!  Thank you for giving us a delicious recipe that uses a very healthy underused grain!

I modified this a bit.  4 1/2 c. water and 1 c. almond milk.  4 chopped apples, 3/4 c. raisins instead of the dates.  Cinnamon and nutmeg.  Delicious!  Next time I'll sprinkle roasted walnuts on top.

I really wanted to like millet, but I can't.  The texture is just awful.  This recipe may be ok substituted with another grain.

This recipe needs no improvement.:-)  The only thing I changed (other than changing the serving size to 12 for the size of my family) was using a can of coconut milk instead of the soy milk, because we avoid soy.  The recipe cooked perfectly, and all 9 of us enjoyed it.  I will be making this again and again!  My children are thrilled to have another alternative to oatmeal.  I used unsweetened coconut milk and unsweetened coconut, and we all thought this recipe was quite sweet enough as it was; the dates are enough to sweeten it nicely.

I just made this in a water bath in the crockpot over night. It worked really well! I cut the water down to 4 cups, and cooked about 8 1/2 hours. I did soak my millet during the day before.

I halved & modified this recipe a bit according to what I had around - 1/2 cup millet, 3 cups whole cow milk, 1/3 cup raisins, 1/4 cup coconut & 1/2 ts. pure vanilla extract. This was easy, quick and the result was a simple, mildly sweet, nutritious & delicious comfort food. I certainly plan on making again and trying variations (including dates & bananas which would add potassium as well). Thank you for sharing this.

This wasn't as delightful as I'd hoped it would be. Tasted a lot like cornmeal mush, and wasn't very sweet. It was good with maple syrup over it, and would be better without the coconut.

I have always HATED millet because it has an after taste to me. But my husband loves it, so I've been trying to find recipes we can both enjoy. This one is awesome! I couldn't believe how good it tasted. I cut the water and put in 1 cup of Almond Milk (no soy powder). We do not like dates/raisins, so I put in dried cranberries and 1 chopped apple. I only had unsweetened coconut on hand, so I added a teaspoon of honey (didn't need it thought). Added a teaspoon of cinnamon and chopped walnuts. The two of us ate the entire pan in 2 days. Yummy!

My New Years resolution is to eat healthier so I tried this for breakfast this morning.  It was wonderful.  I used unsweetened coconut so i added about 1/8 cup of agave nectar and also used unsweetened coconut milk since I did not have soy.  This will be perfect to take to work for my breakfast.  Can't wait to share it with the girls at work.

I love this dish. It was easy to make and delicious. I made with almond milk instead of the soy milk powder and water. I also substituted the coconut for dried pomegranates.

We made it this morning and LOVED it! I made substitutions based on what I had and halved the recipe, but it was great and I'll definitely make it again. My changes were rice milk instead of soy powder and dried cranberries instead of dates. It surprised me how sweet it was without adding additional sugar to it.

This is a great gluten-free breakfast! I added 1/2 tsp salt after making it the first time and that helped boost the flavor. I make this 2-3 times/month, sometimes substituting 2 c. soy milk and 3 1/2 cups hot water for the soy milk powder and water. I also substitute half the dates for raisins. If my coconut is unsweetened, I add 1/8 to 1/4 cup sweetener (honey, sucanat or brown sugar). We eat this warm with milk and honey. Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know if I did something wrong or not it was like soup and never thickened up. The taste of millet does not seem to be for me.

This is delicious!  I used milk instead of the water since I didn't have soy powder.  Stirring halfway through gives it a good consistency.  I did add pecans when it was done.  We love it over ice cream.

We are preparing to go to Africa so I’ve been looking for foods that we will be able to find there.  Millet is a stable. I made this for breakfast while camping.  I used the same proportions and ingredients substituting raisins for dates because that is what I had and added a couple pinches of salt.  I cooked it on the camp stove for about 15-20 minutes watching carefully the last 5 minutes to avoid scorching.  It was delicious, needed no additional sweetener.  We served with milk.

Sorry, but this was very bland.  I even used a bit more coconut and dates than the recipe called for.  A bit too loose for my liking, too. I think the water/grain ratio is off should be more like  3:1 for this recipe.

This was delicious! I only used water and did 2 cups of millet to 6 cups of water. I also added 1/2 to 1 tsp. of himalayan salt which really brought out the flavor.
I cooked this in my pressure cooker for 10 minutes on high pressure and it was perfect!
