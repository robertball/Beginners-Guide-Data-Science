I followed the recipe exactly as written and the cookies came out wonderful. Cannot tell that they are different from non GF cookies.

Trying out GF baking. Happy with these. Didnâ€™t have Xanthan gum. Used 1 t cornstarch. They spread quite a bit though. But that made them thin and crispy. Tasted great. I used mini semisweet chocolate chips. They distribute better throughout.  Will definitely make again and again.
