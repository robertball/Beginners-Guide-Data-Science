Excellent recipe!! I have made falafels from a different recipe and even from a box, but these were the best!!  My introduction to Falafels were in a restaurant--inside a soft tortilla-like shell with cucumbers, but these have such a rich flavor that I didn't miss the tortilla or the cucumbers.  Thank you for this recipe!  Excellent!

Great way to get some fiber in my family without them knowing what it was made from. I was able to make early in AM and reheat on baking stone and they were just as good as when I took them out of oil the first time. I used coconut oil instead of canola. Wonderful dill sauce too.

I actually made a Tahini sauce for it instead.

4 tbsp Tahini (shake jar first)
1 clove garlic, crushed
4 tsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp olive oil
water to thin it to liking

super yummy

Good! Kids all ate the falafels straight up without the tzatziki sauce, and adults wrapped them up in naan bread with lettuce and tomatoes. Yum!

Easy to make and a great way to clear the pantry of those year-old cans of Goya Chick Peas!  Awesome taste and will definitely make again.  Felt it was a little light on the garlic and will add more next time around.  Could also see added a little heat next time w/some red pepper flakes or hot minced hot peppers.

This recipe turned out great. I used a 5.3 oz container of Oikos plain yogurt and just cut back a bit on all the ingredients. Tasted great with the Falafel recipe I used from Allrecipe also.

Just made it! I personally don't like cilantro, so I changed it for parsley! Came out very good! My suggestion, instead 2 inch patties try 1.5 inch ball

First time making falafels. Really like this easy recipe. I used canned chickpeas, and didn’t have a potato so I used shredded carrot. I also did not use 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs. Closer to 1/2 cup. Absolutely delicious and I hope my picky eaters will enjoy them too.

Excellent! This was a big hit with my husband and son.  Took some tips from others and added another tbsp of olive oil, more garlic, and a small amount of flour.  It came out moist.  Also, I didn’t have the ingredients for the yogurt sauce, so I just used French onion dip and it was great. I definitely will make this again.

My 13 year old offered to make dinner and together we chose this item as our main course (we doubled it!). Other than the deep frying she did it all. She used our fine cheese grater for the potatoes and onions which was a great choice (see what I did there ;) hehe)! These were the BEST I have ever eaten! My husband had seconds and he isn’t a huge fan normally. Super moist and makes way more than I thought so we have tons of leftovers (we didn’t need to double to use as a meal for two adults and a teenager (my son opted out)). Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was really good! I love how light and crispy the falafel turned out with the panko breadcrumbs. I followed the recipe but added extra garlic and put everything in a food processor to blend. Also cooked the potato for a few minutes in the microwave before adding to the mix. Delicious! Will be making this again!

These were so easy and came out delicious! The only tips I have are that the chickpeas are hard to mash with a fork so I used a potato masher,  and I fried the patties on low-medium until they were golden.  I also added a little garlic powder in addition to the two cloves for more flavor.

Fantastic!  First time ever making Falafel.  I found it difficult to crush with a fork and used a potato masher instead.  Made it exactly as stated in recipe.!

Easy. Tasty. Lots of healthy have-in-the-house-already kinds of ingredients. Yum. I don't even think my carnivorous husband noticed dinner was meatless. Need I say more?

I've made this at least 5 times and my family raves!  My husband is solidly in the school of thought that all dinners should have meat, but this meal makes him happy and he rejoices when he finds out its on the menu.

This a great and easy recipe.  I had to use my food processor for the chickpeas and added a little more salt but otherwise followed the recipe exactly,  This will be my "go to" recipe for falafel from now on.  Thanks for this!

Pretty good with amendments to the recipe but much more labor intensive than planned.

After reading other reviewers' comments decided not to add 3/4 C panko crumbs inside the mixture; reduced to 1/2 C.

Chickpeas were not easy to mash with a fork, so tried my wonderful ricer used for mashed potatoes, but that didn't work too well, so ended up using a soup spoon, which took awhile to mash.  Perhaps using a food processor next time would help.  

Mixture already seemed dry so added 1 tbsp. olive oil + 1 tbsp. tahini, an item not normally on hand.   Ended up doubling those amounts as most comments were about dryness and the mix still seemed slightly dry.  Perhaps next time will use less panko inside, more olive oil or even another egg.  Not sure.

Used a 1/3 cup measure to scoop the mixture into the panko, needing a total of 1/2 C for the six patties the recipe made.   On my electric stovetop cooked them 3 mins. per side, perhaps a tad too much.  Thankfully the yogurt sauce helped add moisture.

We liked them but not sure the recipe will become a regular.  Just something different to try given that all the ingredients were on hand as well as time, which one needs for this recipe.

Absolutely loved this.  Our whole meat eating family adored these.   

Fried them in olive oil.  I don't uses vegetable or canonola oils.   Will be making these again real soon.    The sauce is wonderful on the falafel.  It's a strong flavour when tasted on its own.   Wasn't sure about it so I put it on the side and dipped first.     Second bite it was was poured on the falafel.  

Thanks for the recipe.

I omitted the potato and pepper and baked these instead. To avoid a dried out crumbly mess, I added 1 tsp baking powder and 1/8 cup flower after mixing the other ingredients. This gave them a moist cookie dough consistency, easy to make patties with. I lined a cookie sheet with foil, sprayed the foil and patties with oil, cooked 12 minutes, flipped them, sprayed and cooked again. The result were healthier falafels that held together, perfect on a pita with lettuce, tomato, the sauce and some goat cheese on top!

My hippie vegetarian fiancee said that I, a rank amateur, had made the best falafels she'd ever had.  I made the falafels exactly as the recipe indicated, with the exception of subbing dried cilantro for fresh. Where I flubbed it was on the sauce - I used plain greek yogurt and dried dillweed (adjusting my spices down).  That wasn't a good combo. But I found the falafels themselves pretty good (I wasn't sure what they were supposed to be like, honestly) - I ate them with mustard-based bbq sauce. :-)

Pita or naan bread is the appropriate bread to serve these in as it is a middle eastern food and they don't use tortillas. If you want authentic go for pita!!

Made exactly as directed.  Found it to be tasty but dry...would have liked a bit more oil and spice in the recipe.
