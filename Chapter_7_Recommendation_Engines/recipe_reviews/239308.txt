Chicken LaPaloma Haiku: "So easy to make! I added just a few things, we really liked this!" I had cream of mushroom soup, not chicken, so used that instead, and halved the entire recipe for 3 of us. The cornflakes on top were just a little too sweet, both in aroma and taste, so when I make this again, I will consider crushed up Ritz crackers or Ruffles chips; not sure. I also added in some lightly-sauteed onions and garlic. Really liked that it didn't have the typical rice in it that one sees in chicken casseroles like these; the cornflake topping was enough starch for us, but like I said, that's the 1st thing I'll swap out next time I make this.

This was great. Left out the cheese though. Thought it'd make for a rich creamy overkill.

I followed the recipe, and my husband and I didn't care for it at all. There was way too much cream of chicken soup... The veggies and chicken were swimming in it, and I only used 1.75 cans. Maybe cream of mushroom would be better. Overall, it wasn't tasty.
