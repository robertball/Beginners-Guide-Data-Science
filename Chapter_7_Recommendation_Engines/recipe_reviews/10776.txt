My hubby loved them!  I used 1 tbsp of lemon juice and some lemon zest instead of lemon extract.  They were really moist and delicious. UPDATE:  I made these again and refrigerated the dough for about 24 hours before I made the cookies. The dough was easier to handle after being in the frig- not as sticky. They also came out even better than the first time I made them...a bit of crispiness on the bottom and around the sides and soft inside.  The powdered sugar seemed to adhere better, too. Putting the dough in the frig was definitely a good idea.  These are our favorite!

These are delicious and so simple!! My grandmother, who bakes for everyone else but rarely eats her own goodies just loves these. Let them turn just golden on the edges and they turn out great. I have also used this recipe ratio to create other kinds of cookies - basically any cake mix with 2 eggs and 1/3 c. oil and add whatever you like - chocolate tends to absorb more liquid so I add a couple tablespoons of chocolate sauce... Try the spice cake cookies at Christmas - YUM!! Much thanks to Lissa - this is a winner!

I didn't have any lemon extract, so used 1 package of unsweetened lemonade flavored Kool-aid, and the flavor just POPS in your mouth!! Definitely added a nice lemony tang!  Also, since powdered sugar has a lower burn point that granulated, I put the cookies on the sheets (I use parchment paper) and just dusted the tops.  This is a keeper recipe...have to keep the recipe..the cookies didn't last long. Loved the crisp outside and chewy center...but don't overbake! When you think they aren't done...they are.

Wonderful easy recipe!  For an extra lemon "bite", double the lemon extract and add 1 tsp of lemon rind.  Superb!!!

I have used this recipe several times and it is always a hit - so, thanks Lissa. I did have to lower the oven to 350 and cooked for 11 min. You can use any flavor box mix. I did one with orange cake mix and lots of orange zest. Another one was yellow cake mix, 2 tspn Almond flavoring and tiny choc chips. The most recent one I used for a crowd of teenage kids was chocolate cake mix, 2 tspns almond flavoring and CHERRY flavored cranberries.  WOW did they love these chewie cookies.  I called them Chocolate cherry chewies!

My husband and I loved these. I used 1 Tbsp lemon juice in place of the lemon extract, much better flavor. If you prefer a crisper cookie push the ball down a little before baking and bake them till browned. Yum!

I thought these were just okay. The good:  great texture, very chewy, and practically no effort to make. The bad: couldn't get past the "fruit loops" taste from the boxed lemon mix even after I added 2T of pure lemon juice. Maybe I'll try a white cake mix and add lots of real lemon juice.

Easy to make, yes, but they really needed more lemon flavor. I added extra lemon extract and lemon zest, and they still were just "sweet" not "tangy".  I would add at least 1 1/2 tsp lemon zest and 2 tsp lemon extract! Chill to make the dough less sticky before scooping into balls. On a side note, if you add 1-2 cups of rice krispies to the dough, it adds a nice crunch!

Very easy and versatile, too. My husband did a cookie exchange at his workplace (guess who made the cookies). I made lemon, strawberry (used strawberry extract instead of lemon) and carrot cake (used 1/8 tsp of ground ginger and a tsp of vanilla). Oh, and I did cook mine for 10 minutes. I guess ovens are different. Delicious!

I changed this recipe up, because some people complained of a "Fruit Loop" lemon taste.  I doubled the recipe, using one lemon cake and one white cake.  I used melted butter instead of oil, because I'm bad!!  I added two extra teaspoons of lemon extract.  I then rolled the dough into 1" balls and rolled them in the powdered sugar.  I made a thumbprint in each cookie and filled it with lemon curd.  The cookies cooked up beautifully in about 9 minutes, but as the recipe states, be careful.  My family raved and we all ate too many!

I've been making these for years. I bake them without rolling in the powdered sugar. After they are cool I spoon some lemon glaze over each cookie.  To make lemon glaze mix about 1 cup of powdered sugar and enough fresh-squeezed lemon juice to make a thick glaze.  The glaze makes the cookie super lemony.

These cookies had a nice texture and look, but tasted suspiciously like "Froot Loops."  I will not make it again.

I love this cookie! I used 2 Tbsp orange zest, and lemon juice instead of extract. Adding more lemon extract would only enhance that cereal taste that some reviewers were complaining about. Using Lemon juice instead is a good fix. I added the orange zest because I wanted it to add little more interest. It definitely worked, and I'd highly recommend doing that. It may seem like a lot, but it helps add a fresh taste, versus the boxed, artificially flavored taste. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be using this for a quick cookie anytime the occasion calls for it!

I read all the reviews before I made these.  I decided to make them and so glad I did!  They are fabulous. This is going to be a fun recipe that I can play with.  In takes "maybe" 10 min to get everything together and mix. About 6 minutes to scoop out 15 balls (I USED A MELON BALLER)onto parchment paper.  Bake for 7 minutes in my oven (They didn't look done except for the cracked tops)let cool on the paper then bag in zip locks or eat.  I got 52 cookies per box! I made two recipes of cookies that were a modification since I needed something for church ASAP,  White cake mix, vanillaextract and raspberry extract. I put white chocolate chips in these.  In the other I made golden yellow with butter extract and rum extract.  I put regular chocolate chips in this batch.
Everyone went wild with both of these.  I plan on doing the lemon, the orange, and the strawberry for Easter. I may do a chocolate mint for St Paddy's day.  Don't hesitate to try this recioe the flavor is great, the texture is great not cakey, and you dozens of cookies in less than 30 minutes...clean up included.

These cookies were easy to make & a hit at Easter! I followed the recipe exactly except I did not use the lemon extract, but took the advice a previous comment by using the juice & zest of 1 whole lemon. Also, I baked for 11 minutes at 350 instead of 375. Yummy!!  Also, the recipe calls for baking them on an ungreased cookie sheet.  I highly recommend baking them on parchment paper.  I baked both ways--on the plain cookie sheet, they stuck because of the sugar on them.  They didn't stick at all on the parchment paper! I will definitely make them again! :)

delecious, but theres an easier recipe! lemon cake mix, 1 egg, and a container of cool whip, but you do have to grease the cookie sheet then. I think they turn out lighter when you use the cool whip.

I was skeptical of these cookies at first, but they were a hit!!  I made no changes to the recipe, but I did adjust the size.  I found that when I made a normal sized cookie, even extending the baking time, they still seemed a little too chewy for me.  I made the second batch only about the size of a quarter to a silver dollar and SUCCESS!  Just a slightly crispy edge and soft center.  I found that the bite sized portion really complemented the refreshing flavor as well.  Thanks for the great recipe, it will definitely continue on my holiday baking list.

Outstanding! I had the urge to bake something and I had all the ingredients for these cookies so I gave them a whirl. They could not be easier! I had no problem with stickiness. I used a cookie scoop to get uniform-size cookies and they turned out perfect! Soooo lemon-y and sooooo soft. I baked for 6 minutes and decided to give them one more minute because they didn't look "done." They still didn't look done at 7 minutes so I took them out and, lo and behold, they were a little too brown on the bottom. Next time I will bake for 6 minutes. Nevertheless, they were still superb and I'll definitely make these again and look forward to trying different variations with different cake mixes! :)

These are wonderful. i made them by the recipe, minus the lemon extract. I didn't have extract so i used lemon kool aid powder (unsweetned). I made them to mail out in Christmas care packages to family in other states. But Im not sure if they will make it in the boxes. My husband and I can't get enough. Thank you for sharing.

I am not a baker.  I bake once a year for a Christmas Cookie exchange, so I look for easy recipes.  I hate all the mess and time it takes me to make some cookies.  I just tried a test batch of these and they turned out very good.  I am pleasantly surprised and will bring them to the cookie exchange.
A few notes.  As others have stated, cake mixes now are 15.25 oz, not 18.25. (Someone should update this recipe).  I added 1/3 cup of flour to the mix and it was fine.  Instead of the lemon extract, I used 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice and some lemon zest.  No fruit loops taste, just lemony.  
I used a small scoop and made them pretty small.  I got 4 dozen from one box of mix.  I used parchment paper, so the bottoms did not burn.  I also baked them at 350 for 12 minutes.  Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.
I will make these again!

What a great, simple recipe! And delicious to boot! Like others I didn't have lemon extract so I used the zest and juice from 1 lemon instead. I also chilled the dough in the refrigerator for an hour or so and it was much easier to handle.   For those whose cookies don't seem to bake right the first time do a single test cookie rather than cooking the whole batch. Every oven is different, try changing the temp/time to get the desired results. My oven at 375* and 9 minutes browned the cookie but left the inside undercooked. I dropped the temp to 360* and increased the cook time to 12 minutes and they came out perfect. Don't be afraid to try a couple different settings or bake times.

This was a great recipe. I made it for a MOPS (Mothers of PreSchoolers) cookie exchange. The only thing I changed was that I sifted the powdered sugar on the cookies AFTER I baked them. They look prettier. The moms loved them! I can't wait to try some other versions...one mom has made them before with a chocolate cake mix and mini M&Ms. She said they were good. I'll also try peanut butter chips with the chocolate cake mix next time. I used a 1 inch cookie scoop and ended up with 26 cookies that were 2 inches wide.

I get requests for these cookies all the time.  I always feel guilty about how easy they are to make when people go crazy over them.  They're almost impossible to mess up.  If you happen to bake them too long, just store them in an airtight container and they get softer.  **I skip the confectioners' sugar.  I find that the sugar just absorbs into the cookie and it's a wasted step. It doesn't end up adding much for decoration.  Maybe I don't do that step right, but I don't think it affects the taste at all to skip it.  I do use the lemon extract, just because I have it, but if you don't feel like spending the money on it, I think they would taste good without that too.

simple and delicious. i picked this as starter recipe for my 9yr old daughter and she needed very little help from me. i was concerned about a "fake" lemon flavor after reading the reviews, so we substituted the juice and zest of one small lemon and used a yellow cake mix. my husband thought they were "buttery". i think it was the yellow cake mix since i was tempted to but did not use butter. for my family the more subtle lemon flavor was perfect. did half as jam thumbprints and those were good, too. i think this is a great base recipe and will try other combos for sure.

I love tart things, so I took some advice from the other reviewers and used regular yellow cake mix instead of the lemon cake mix and added a lot more lemon juice. I reduced 2 eggs down to 1 egg and dare added 1/2+ cup real lemon juice! Plus, I added 2 tsp of lemon extract. They turned out real tangy and delicious with still nice and chewy texture. I also made sure to refragirate the dough for several hours before baking them.

Definitely not bad! I can see what a previous poster meant by a "froot loop" taste though. Like I said though... not bad! Taste alone this deserves 3 stars... but I really like the appearance of them... so I gave it a 4 out of 5!

Excellent cookies.  I plan to make again, and often.
**EDIT**Tried again with some variations.  Made another lemon batch exactly to the recipe.  Made a strawberry batch with strawberry cake mix and a packet of unsweetened strawberry kool-ade (really makes the strawberry flavor pop!), and then a chocolate batch with some almond extract.  All are excellent!

I also used unsweetened kool aid mix and loved it. I also tried strawberry and orange cake mixes with corresponding kool aid flavors. Really good and everyone loved them.

I made a batch of these as is - which is why i can actually rate the recipe and will say they were not quite lemony enough for us.  I made them again and up'd the lemon extract to 2 tsp and they were much better.  I love the base of this recipe though - they make chewey cookies that, if baked right, have a little crunch on the bottom.  My huband devoured several.  Made for a Spring-time Tupperware party and everyone asked for the recipe!

These came out perfectly the first time and every time since then. Everyone loves them. They are the first to disappear even along side the usual chocolate chip favorite. Plus they are very pretty cookies, with the crackled appearance and white powdered sugar on top. Making another batch (or 2) today, the day AFTER Christmas!

I love these simple cookies. They are not too strong but add a hint of lemon.  You might want to leave in the oven a bit longer so they don't get doghey.  Enjoy!

Tasted amazing! I ran out of oil so added about 1 tbsp of melted butter to make for 1/3c. I also used 2 tbsp of lemon juice as well as zest instead of extract.  While the first batch was cooking, I put the rest of the batter in the freezer. When the first batch finished, it tasted ok. When i made the other batches that had come out if the freezer, the lemon taste was much more pronounced!  Definitely refridgerate if you can or freeZe batter for about 10 min if you are crunched for time before baking. It makes all the difference!!!

These cookies are AMAZING! They are moist on the inside and crisp on the outside. The flavor is perfect. My boyfriend added white chocolate chips and they were to die for - delicious!!

It was good but not enough of a zesty lemon taste for me. When I bake something with lemon I really want the lemon to pop and it didn't do that for me.

A super easy cookie recipe that could not be any easier.  I used 1 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract and baked the cookies first on a Silpat and then on parchment paper.  The ones on parchment paper came out so much better (crispier) so I continued with the parchment paper.  They came out identical to the picture as well.  I found that if I rolled them in a ball, dropped them in the sugar,  rolled them around in the sugar, then rolled them again, dropped them again in the sugar, and then placed them on the cookie sheet, they retained the sugar more than just one roll in the sugar.  Absolutely no need to refrigerate this dough as it is light and doesn't stick too much.  I can't wait to try them with other types of cake mix and flavorings.

Very easy!  and good.  Only difference was I made these bigger than the 1 tsp size, that just didn't seem big enough.  I free formed balls of the dough and rolled into the powdered sugar.  I got 29 cookies, and baked for 10 mins.  Its real good as is, but I think next time bake for 11 mins.

What a fabulously simple recipe! The cookies are moist and tasty (they only lasted a couple of hours anyway). The powdered sugar make them pretty. I used this recipe (minus the lemon extract) with a triple chocolate cake mix and it was great!

I made these cookies the other day and everybody loved them and wanted the recipe. I did leave out the extract and used one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and a little grated lemon rind.  I also let the dough cool in the refrigerator for 24 hours before roling and baking.

Wow…I made these for my Mom for Easter.   She loves lemon and I know she is going to be smiling when she tries one of these…. I reduced the baking temp to 350 in my convection oven and watched them carefully after 6 minutes..I made my cookies a bit larger and I took them out of the oven at 10 mins with no bottom browning.  Very happy with these cookies..will make them again…

I made this recipe last year and it was wonderful.  This year I am unable to find a 18.25 oz package of lemon cake mix.  I can only find a 16.5 oz package.  Is there a way to convert this???

These are easy and very pretty. The texture is very nice (for a soft, cakey cookie). My daughter loves them, as do many other people. I think that they tasted too artificial (guess I was just fooling myself by thinking that they wouldn't). I agree with the reviewer who said that they tasted like fruit loops, which may not be a bad thing for a lot of people.

These were really good! I used only 1/4 cup oil (the cake box calls for 1/3) and I thought even that was a bit much...maybe next time I will use 1/8 cup. Anyway, these had just the lemon flavor I was looking for, and rolling them in the powdered sugar really gave them a fancy look.  These actually get pretty big while cooking, so you'll definatley want to stick to the 1 teaspoon size.

I have been using this recipe for years except for these changes-I use 1/2 c butter flavored shortening not oil and add 1T lemon zest not extract. I also get citric acid, purchased during canning season in bulk spice section of some stores, and add a little at a time to the powdered sugar until I have a tartness to my liking. Sift it twice before using to incorporate it well, then roll the cookie in it. I also dust a little extra on top for the extra zip I like.  This gives the extra zing some of the reviewers wanted.  Also the brand of cake mix makes a difference-I prefere Pillsbury

I didn't have lemon extract so I added a little pure vanilla extra and a tsp of lemon juice. I also rolled the cookies in powdered sugar when I took them out of the oven instead and they were delicious!!! My husband loves them and he's not a huge lemon person.

I wanted to make a fun, festive (but easy) treat for St. Patrick's Day today and these were perfect! I put in some green and blue food coloring until it was a nice green color. Then I put 3 small balls together and rolled a little snake for a stem and they came out as really cute shamrocks! I didn't have lemon extract or a lemon so I committed a culinary sin and used bottle lemon juice. I loved the taste of the cookies! So did my kids! We got 16 good-size shamrock cookies out of it.

These were great!! I did as most other people said and used lemon juice and lemon rind because i don't use lemon extract for anything and didn't want to buy it just for this and they came out fine! My family enjoyed it!!

A good, very easy lemon cookie - kind of embarrassing how easy they are! My only wish, is that would have been a little "puffier"...mine got a smidgen flat.

I was skeptical of all the rave reviews on this one, BUT when I took it to a holiday cookie party, all 35 of them went, and the others were left in the dust.  I too didn't have lemon extract, so I used two packets of True Lemon dissolved in a bit of water.

I loved these... This is the first time I tried cake mix as a base for cookies, and it was so easy and quick.  I think I may add a little lemon zest to really amp up the lemon flavor next time, but even without it, they were really good and very lemony!  Yums...

My husband's co-workers request these cookies several times each year - they are SO easy to make, have a great texture and best of all, they taste great! I usually add a little more lemon extract for added flavor, but the recipe is great as written. Thanks!

I'm sorry I have no idea how this cookie got such high ratings.  I have never rated a recipe so poorly but they were sickening sweet and fake tasting.  I made these for a gathering and I was really embarrassed.  Even the kids didn't like them.

Fabulous as is, but I did punch it up by substituting the lemon extract with lime juice. Then, I made a glaze of fresh lime juice, lime zest and powdered sugar and drizzled the cookies with this. I slightly flatted the balls with fork tines before baking, too. Everyone went nuts for these lemon-lime cookies. The lime gives it a yummy citrus flavor without the pucker factor. Thanks for the easy recipe. Next time, we'll use German Chocolate Cake mix and sandwich the cookies with a pecan-frosting filling. So many possibilities...

These were really good.  The dough was easy to mix, and turned out just like playdoh.  Not sticky at all, fun to work with.  The smaller cookies turned out the best, the larger ones didn't quite cook in the middle, although they were still yummy!  They were best after a few hours/overnight.  I'll definitely make these again.  These are also great for the kids to help with.

Nice and chewy! I also used grated lemon and some juice. Use a disher, I used a 2 teaspoon one. This way you don't have to deal with the sticky dough, just dish and drop out into the powdered sugar, roll and bake!

WOW!!!  I followed some of the other suggestions and these cookies SING in your mouth!  I call them Lemon Zingers.  Followed the recipe with the exception that I didn't use the powdered sugar ( I tried it that way before and they looked awful) and I didn't use the Lemon Extract (as I never have any).  I used the Lemon Cake Mix, 2 Eggs, 1/3 cup oil, 1 TBS. Real Lemon Juice, and yes 1 Package of Unsweetened Lemonade Kool-Aid Mix (mix for 2 Qrts.).  I then used a cookie scooper (equivalent to 1 TBS. of cookie dough) and dropped the balls into regular sugar and coated them.  Baked at 375 for 9 min.  WOW!!!  If you want them to be thick keep at rounded tablespoons, if you want a flatter cookie, press down on the cookie a little bit with the bottom of a glass.  These are a big hit!

Light as a feather & very tasty...kids would'nt stop eating them!  Made a few changes because I started with a box of White cake mix...added zest & juice from one lemon in addition to 1 tsp lemon extract.   Not crispy at all (which is how I like my cookies), but light as a feather with a very pleasant flavor. If you like soft, airy textured cookies, then you will really enjoy these!

Very very good!  
I could only find ONE lemon cake mix and it was a mere 10.5 ounce box.  Top compensate, I put a bit less oil, keeping everything else the same.  I had to cook them longer, but they were fabulous!!!  
I'll be making these again. They were a hit at the party.

These cookies are ok.  They definitely aren't as exceptional as the rating and reviews lead me to believe.  The lemon flavor seems a little artificial to me, as another reviewer said - kind of like fruit loops.  Also, they are very soft cookies and I had to cook them longer than the recipe stated, about 11 mins.  They are easy to make, but I probably won't make them again.

These were pretty good.  I used lemon juice and lemon zest instead of extract because I think the extract has a chemical taste.  I also didn't have any problems with the dough.  I just dropped spoonfuls of it into the powdered sugar and kind of tossed it around forming it into a ball as I went.  The cookies came out very cakey and not very crisp, but I took them to work along with some other baked goods and my boss raved about them.  Thanks for the post Lissa!

these were fairly good.  As someone said, they tasted of fake lemon;  next time i think i would add some fresh lemon juice and lemon zest.  My cookies took 10 minutes to cook;  the first batch was raw after 8 minutes and ended up in the trash.

Easy to make for a non-baker. Maybe I was spoiled on my mom & grandmas cookies, but these were kinda meh. Fruit loop-y. Not bad by any means, just, well, easy. I tried a second batch with red velvet cake mix. Not bad. 4 stars because they are soo easy. Hence the name.

Bad texture - and way too artificial tasting, even after adding real lemon juice and zest.

This is a great, simple cookie! I didn't have lemon extract, so I used about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. I let the dough sit in the refrigerator for about an hour so they were easier to shape. I definitely will be making these on a regular basis.

I thought these were ok, the first batch burnt on the bottom so I turned the oven down to 350 and that worked better for my oven. They do lack the homemade cookie taste but husband and kids are eating them like crazy anyway.

I was desperate for a "quick" cookie to take to a cookie party and found these. Since it's the Christmas season I used a spice cake mix and added rum extract and dried cranberries. I did lengthen the cooking time to nearly 15 minutes ... must be my oven. And most importantly, I must add that they taste very good - and they look beautiful, too, in their powdered sugar "coats" with bits of red peeking through. I'll definately make these again.

Easy easy easy! My mother loved them. I probably won't be making them again, but it was good use of cake mix.  I didn't do the sugar on the outside because I forgot, but I think it would've been too much anyways.

Made these in chocolate, including 1/4 cup syrup. Cookies took about 15 minutes to bake. Easy way to check, stick a toothpick in the tallest cookie, if it comes out wet, bake a little longer. Refrigerated dough overnight, but still very sticky to handle. They'll come out cracked looking like picture only if you roll it into a ball, for the few I just made chunks of, they settled sloppy (but still tasty). A good recipe with lots of variations, going to try Lemon with some Strawberry-Lemonade Kool-Ade added next.

Very good.  Great texture for a cookie.  I used fresh lemon juice- about 2 T. and let the batter sit overnight in the frig.  My first batch were a little under done- which really give off the 'Fruit Loop' flavor.  I let the next batch cook longer, until lightly brown on the edges, and they taste much better- more like lemon.  I look forward to making this again, and trying different versions of it!

What a pleasant surprise! I made exactly as directed and these are so delicious and different. 5 stars for the taste, price, ease, time and effort!! Can't beat it! I will take these light, refreshing and perfectly sweet cookies with us on our beach trip! *update* I just tried this recipe with Duncan Hines Chocolate Fudge mix and threw some peanut butter chips in with it. AWESOME! Kids went crazy! Can use this recipe with any cake mix you prefer for great cookies!

Perfection!! My family asks me to make these for every occasion. No need to add zest or anything. Depending on the size of cookie you make you will need to vary cooking time. When bottom looks a little golden they are done. Also, they taste so good with any cake flavor you prefer. Lemon is my personal fav w/ banana cake mix w/ added chocolate chips coming in a close 2nd.

I needed a quick recipe and found this one.  The cookies turned out great, I used the suggestion from one reviewer to use 1/4 ground ginger, 1 tsp vanilla with a carrot cake mix.  As that was the only mix I had in the cupboard, I went with it.  The cookies are delicious, I will make them again.

Delicious.  The only thing I changed was to sprinkle a little powdered sugar on the tops of them after they baked because rolling them in sugar before baking didn't result in enough for my taste.  I took them to our Christmas Even gathering and got rave reviews.

These are the absolute easiest cookies I've ever made.  I tried rolling some in powdered sugar and some in granulated sugar.  The powdered sugar ones were definitely the best.  This is a great recipe to make with kids.

Fabulous!  I added the zest of 2 lemons & an additional 1/2 tsp of lemon extract.  They came out wonderful!!  I also baked them on parchment paper.

I just made them last night, for Easter weekend.  I brought a few to work and got rave reviews!  They insisted on getting the recipe.  Thanks for a refreshing and elegant little cookie!  I'll be making these again, very soon!

This recipe was simple, easy and delicious!  I have made it several times now - and they always turn out great.  I omit the lemon extract (mainly because I don't have it on hand) but they still taste great!  I have also used strawberry cake mix with the same great results (think Valentine's day).

This recipe was very easy to make and if you like lemon you'll love these cookies. I only added 1 thing 1/3 cup of crushed pecans. It gave the cookies a little bit more texture. My kids loved this recipe and its great if you need to make something for a childs class party in a hurry!

These cookies are FABULOUS!  I omitted the powdered sugar step and just used a small scoop to transfer the soft dough onto the pans.  I only got 2 dozen large cookies with this method.  Once they cooled, I iced them with vanilla frosting.  Next time I will bake at 350, as they browned on top at 375.  EXCELLENT!

So easy and simple.  I had a sweet tooth tonight but was looking for something quick and easy.  This fit the bill.  I did not have lemon extract on hand, so used bottled lemon juice and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  Also, with the remaining powdered sugar I added 1 tbs lemon juice, 2 tbs melted butter and whisked into an icing.  Drizzled just a little on each cookie and this gave it an extra lemony flavor and who doesn't like icing???!!!  I will use the base recipe of: 1 box cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup oil for other cookie flavors.  You can't make cookies for less money than 1 box of cake mix + rest.

Fast, effortless, attractive, and everyone here LOVED them. I added 1/3 cup of flour since the 18.25 ounce box of cake mix is no longer available where I shop. I used an equal amount of lemon juice instead of extract. Note: they are done even when they don't look done.

I make cake mix cookies all the time. You can make them with any flavor cake mix (just use the appropriate flavor extract, or leave it out. You don't have to have it for a great flavor, but do try almond extract with a chocolate cake mix sometime - delicious!) One thing I do different is to have the oven temp at 350 F. You don't need a higher temp for these cookies. You can also throw in other ingredients like chocolate chips, a bit of oatmeal, raisins, nuts, coconut.... Be creative!

Made these today.  Definitely good for something quick and easy, but they're heavier than I'd hoped.  I used a small scoop for the dough and it worked perfectly.  Dropped the balls, one at a time, directly into the bowl of powdered sugar and rolled them.  Had to bake them more like 11 minutes (yes, my oven temp. is accurate).  They taste a bit salty to me, but that must be the cake mix.  I read someone had trouble getting them off an ungreased cookie sheet.  Mine came off easily.  Bottom line...home made is better and wouldn't take much more time just to measure ingredients.

I used the eggs, oil, 1/3 cup sugar, packet of crystalized lemon, and zest of one lemon. Used a melon baller to make nilla wafer size, baked for 6 - 7 min. glaze with juice from lemon and powdered sugar. Awesome!! did not have fruit loop taste but had the lemon pucker I was looking for. easy and sooo good!!

Always add 2tsp of grated lemon zest too! My daughter and her friends LOVE when I whip these up.  Starting with a cake mix makes these almost no mess or fuss at all and extremely cheap.  If you don't know what to do with (or have no use for) the lemon after removing the zest, here's a tip.  chunk it up and run it through a garbage disposal for a quick cleaning and it will freshen up your disposal!

I've made this recipe twice now, both times I had extra lemon curd on hand and used it to make lemon sandwich cookies. This was a huge hit both times.

I really wanted to make lemon cookies, but my cake mix had expired! I had a Devil's Food mix. Put in 1/4 cup chocolate chips and some Peppermint extract & left out the lemon. Tried squishing some down and others I left in balls. All turned out great, but I think we like the squished ones best.

Chewy and flavorful, and quite easy to make.  I used 1 tsp lemon juice + 1/2 tsp lemon extract.  I regret not breaking up lumps in the cake mix before stirring in the eggs, oil, lemon.

Considering these cookies came from a box cake mix, I thought they were very good.  So many people referred to a Fruit Loops taste.  That's not a bad thing.  I like Fruit Loops.  If I wanted a lemon cookie with great lemon flavor, I would have made it from scratch.  Today I wanted lemon cookies that were fast, easy and inexpensive.  This recipe met all three criteria.  Yes, I would make them again.

I made these cookies for a cookie swap at work.  The first batch I made I used the lemon extract as well as the juice and zest from one lemon.  The second batch I made I omitted the extract and used the zest and juice from two lemons.  The second batch was much better.  Great lemon taste without that artificial flavor.  The second batch was slightly runny so I did add just a small amount of flour to thicken it up a bit.  Will definitley make these cookies again.

The cake mix base makes these cookies extremely sweet. Instead of the extract, I added 3 TB of lemon juice and the zest of one lemon. This amped up the lemon flavor, but did not offset the sweetness. After one, nobody wanted more, so most of these were thrown out. Just too sweet.

I absolutely love this recipe. It is my go-to whenever I have to bring something to a party or potluck. However, I've modified it to make something even better --- STRAWBERRY COOKIES! Same recipe, but instead of lemon cake mix, I use strawberry cake mix (try Duncan Hines Strawberry Supreme). In place of the lemon juice, I puree 6-8 strawberries in the blender. Everyone has been begging me for the recipe because they are so delicious!

the cookies came out ok. they were a little under cooked at the recommended setting so in the next batches i just eyeballed it. I didnt have lemon extract so i used 1 TBSP of lemon juice and could have used some more. I used a Duncan Hines cake mix a brand i really like, but i found it too sweet in the end, these would be better if made from scratch in my opinion.

Very easy and very, very good!  I did not change the recipe at all and these came out exactly the way I wanted -- lemony, soft and delicious.  Received many compliments from co-workers.  I will make these many times and liked them much better than lemon bar recipes I've tried.

This recipe is very tasty,  and very simple to make. A couple of side notes: I didn't have lemon extract, so instead I used about 2 tablespoons of juice from a lemon. The taste of the juice definitely mixed well with the cake mix. Next time I will probably use 3-4 tablespoons, but I prefer these to be very lemony. Second, the cake mix I used was 15.4 oz. (approximately, I don't know exacly how much it was, but it was less than 18.25) and it still came out perfect with the same measurements for all the other ingredients.  I did refrigerate mough before baking (as so many others have done) but only for 30 minutes. The powdered sugar stuck very well, and as I said, the cookies came out perfect and delicious. I will probably double the recipe next time though,  as I live with 5 other people,  these got demolished over night.  The baking time as usual depends on your oven, your elevation, as well as other things, so the best advice I can give is to keep an eye on them  and they should come out fine. 5 stars because they were perfect: sweet, and slightly crispy on the outside, chewy and lemony on the inside.

I got this from my boss and I make these cookies – Using the  cake mix adding to the cake   1 egg, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 stick of butter softened, and  1- 8oz cream cheese. Mixing it all together and then rolling each cookie in powder sugar baking at 350 for 10-12 minutes the cookies will appear gooey, but they are so good. This also works well with a chocolate moist cake mix. These are a huge hit.

What a simple but delicious cookie! I made these for Christmas Day, and everyone loved them! Per other reviewers, I did add an extra tsp. of lemon extract. I'm sure 1 tsp. would be just fine, but I wanted to ensure I got a strong, tart lemon flavor. I ran out of confectioners' sugar so I rolled the remaining cookies in a superfine baking sugar. Both were delicious. Keep an eye on these as they bake. They can brown quickly. Thank you, Lissa, for this great recipe! I look forward to making these cookies every holiday season.

The first time I made these, I doubled the lemon extract like someone suggested. And people liked them. The second time, I used the Lemon Kool-aid instead of the lemon extract to see which tasted better. They were both good but I prefer doubling the Lemon extract. I think they baked better. On both times I used a cookie press & made pretty yellow flowers. The dough worked will in the press without haven’t to cool it off in the refrigerator or freezer.

Followed the directions, and ended up with soft, chewy, lemony cookies.  These are easy to make since they start with a cake mix, and they bake up very quickly.  My kids really liked these!  I have also made these with a chocolate cake mix (exchanging the lemon extract for vanilla), and they are equally easy and delicious.

Pretty good, but a little bit of an oil aftertaste.  Be careful not to overcook.  My first batch at 8 minutes dried out after sitting for a little bit, the second batch at 7 minutes had a nice soft chewy texture.  Leave them sit on the cookie sheet for a couple minutes before moving them to a rack, otherwise, they'll fall apart on you.  A teaspoon makes pretty small cookies, so if you don't want 2" cookies, use a tablespoon instead. The next time that I make these, I think I'll add some lemon zest to brighten up the flavor.  Very, very easy to make.

So easy and delicious! I have made this with other flavors of cake mix but love the lemon the best. I wait on the confectioners sugar until after they are baked and sprinkle it on then.

Really quick & easy.  Hubby loved them, and my cooking club too.  Update: Since the original lemon recipe turned out so well, I've experimented with a couple others as well.  Chocolate cake mix with mint extract is also devine, and I recently tried strawberry cake mix with strawberry extract.  Delicious.  This is a wonderfully easy, versitile recipe.

I was sick one day and really wanted some lemon cookies, so I used this recipe. The cookies were excellent. They definitely tasted like Fruit Loops, but I like fruit loops. Also, my kitchen smelled fantastic after they baked.

I absolutely love these cookies. I make these every Christmas season, instead of using confectioners sugar I use sanding sugar. Gives the outside of the cookie more of a crunch. I don't eat fruit loops so I don't know what they taste like but in my opinion these are 5 Star!!

What a fun, easy recipe. This is truly a family recipe because the kids can make them! Like some have said, they don't taste the same as homemade...but they're not homemade, hello they only take about 5 minutes to prepare. I added a lemon kool-aid packet and about 3 tsp of lemon juice...my husband likes them very lemony and that they were. Half of the cookies I put powdered sugar on and the other half I made a lemon glaze with powdered sugar and enough lemon juice to make it runny. The lemon glaze was better and not as messy. Yummy!

Very similiar to another recipe on here but this one has better instructions and the picture is exactly how they look when done.  Made the changes suggested by several prior reviews.  Chill dough for several hours in refrig before forming OR add extra flour to the mix to get a firmer consistency.  Boxed cake mixes ARE smaller now, so I added an extra 1/3 to 1/2C of flour to compensate.  Easier to handle and the powder sugar sticks with no problem.  Bake on parchment lined cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 so they cook more evenly and don't need to be watched as closely.  I make one smaller cookie on each sheet to tell when done since the smaller cookie browns faster.  Mine took 12-14 minutes at 350 but everyone's oven may be a bit different.  Used 1T lemon juice and zest since I didn't have lemon extract.  Those who didn't like the taste or complained it tasted like a children's breakfast cereal must be looking for some other type of lemon cookie, we thought they were great.

I thought these cookies were just okay.  It was obvious to me that I cheated and used the box of cake mix as the recipe calls for.  They lack the "homemade cookie" taste.  However, they were very easy to make and both the adults and kids liked them.

This is the best cookie!  It's a neighborhood and family favorite!  The only thing I do differently is substitute 1/3 cup of applesauce for the oil.

These cookies were delicious. Don't be afraid to add extra lemon extract or pure lemon juice. I added quite a bit extra and it was fantastic, I could have even added more. Don't be afraid to pack on the powdered sugar, it makes them look even more beautiful after they've baked!

I've made these about 4 times in the last month.  GREAT, easy cookie.  Everyone who tries them, asks for the recipe.  Tastes good w/ either fresh squeezed lemon juice, or lemon extract.  Follow the recipe as is, turns out GREAT!

DELICIOUS. I made these for teacher appreciation this week and I'm currently in middle school. All my teachers that ate them are asking for recipes now! To get that nice lemon taste, I put in 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice, rather than lemon extract. And on top of the teaspoon of cookie dough on my baking sheet, I put a little zest of a lemon on top of each cookies and it tasted like spring! (:    Really easy to make, and delicious!

This can't be beat for simplicity, that is if you happen to have the ingredients called for.  Of course, I didn't so had to improvise.  I only had a package of white cake mix but I did have a large lemon that I zested and juiced.  I added 2T of zest, minced, and 6T of juice.  Then, because the recipe didn't call for any liquid, I had to compensate and added 1/2 c of flour.  The batter was still pretty wet, but I figured that's probably how it is supposed to be.  I used 2 spoons to drop the batter into the bowl of powdered sugar then rolled the ball around and had no problem picking it up at that point.  My cookies were a little bigger so I baked for 9 min.  They came out great!  Nice fresh lemony flavor and pretty too.

I too found this cookie very easy to prepare however, I have to agree that this is just an okay recipe...the flavor did have a kind of 'fake' fruitloop lemon taste to it...so the kids loved it...I will make when I want to make something fast for the kids.

These were quite delicious, but a bit gummy in the middle. They were cooked long enough, but just didn't seem done in the middle. The powdered sugar sort of faded into the cookies; I don't know how I could have gotten more on them so that didn't happen.  But in any case, they were very easy and delicious. My husband started eating them fresh out of the oven. I had to make another batch soon afterward because he ended up eating them all.

Very tasty and super easy!  I didn't have confection sugar so I dipped the tops of the uncooked cookie balls into regular granulated sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet.  The sugar on top was a yummy treat and added a little crackle texture too.

Not bad at all. Its so easy it's almost not fair. Chilling the dough for a few hours was a good idea. Also, I think lemon cake and lemon extract is overdoing it. A 1/4 tsp almond extract and the zest of half a lemon is what I added and I thought the lemon flavor was just right if not a little strong. Subtlety! Subtlety, America! *Update* These tasted better after crisping in a tupperware container. They taste like a brand of cookies you can buy, the mother's cookies with frosting and sprinkles.

This is my most requested cookie now. Hubby took it to work and they want more. I have tried different flavors with equal success. I have even tried replacing the oil with applesauce or mashed bananas. I have added nuts or mini chocolate chips with success too. Great base recipe to play with.

I made these cookies following the recipe exactly.  I used a 510g Betty Crocker Super Moist lemon cake mix. I noted that other reviewers had problems with the Duncan Hines mix.  I had to mix the dough thoroughly with my silicon spatula, but did not find the dough sticky to work with at all.  I balled a  rounded measuring teaspoon of dough, and followed the advice of another reviewer to roll the balls twice in icing sugar. The dough did not stick to my hands when I rolled them or sugared them. I placed 15 balls on a parchment lined cookie sheet, and baked them in a 350F oven for 10 minutes. This results in roughly 5 dozen cookies about 2 inches in diameter. I left the cookies on the tray for about 5 minutes before cooling on a rack. After they were cool, I stored them in an air-tight container.  The resulting cookies are soft, chewy but not too cakey, and quite good. They do taste a bit like froot loops, but as other reviewer have noted, this IS a cake mix recipe, so do not expect gourmet. I found the froot loop taste to be less prominent the next day. I will make these cookies again, but next time I will try using real lemon juice and zest in place of the extract in hopes of reducing the froot loop taste further.  That said, they are a nicely textured cookie that I will be trying again with other cake mixes.  These cookies are on the sweet side, so serve them with a nice cup of coffee.

Super easy and very tasty. I put a packet of lemon/lime kool-aid in place of the extract. I ended up with a very pretty light green cookie, perfect for the Christmas packages, that tasted very tangy. Can't wait to try other cake mixes and flavor combinations.

Easy to make. I didn't need to refrigerate the batter before shaping.  I used a teaspoon to dig a bit out of the dough, rolled it into a ball, then rolled it in the powdered sugar.  I baked them for 8 minutes in the convection oven, but definitely needed to watch them closely, they turn from perfect to burnt quickly.  They taste fine, just not overly exciting so only 4stars.

I just made these cookies and they do taste good.  If you are looking the that "authentic" lemon taste, these are not the cookies for you.  I added 1T of real lemon juice and rolled them in "Sugar in the Raw".  That gave them a nice crunch.  I did have to cook them for 10 minutes and they are still nice and chewy.  Thanks for an easy recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly--No MODIFICATIONS prior to baking (basically cause I forgot to buy fresh lemons!)  Crumb is nice, crispy on the o/s and chewy i/s.  I had to bake all of 9 mins. at 375 just to get the inside to set.  Since one reviewer complained they were too sweet, I shook off the excess powdered sugar.  But it baked into the cookie, and created a smooth brown crust.  A quick sprinkle of more powdered sugar gave it that festive look that looked so nice in the picture.  And the flavor?  Ok, if you like boxed lemon cake mix, which is exactly what it tasted like.  But I do think that the addition of fresh lemon juice and zest would give these a much-needed boost.  Anyway, the Cub Scouts are taking these to a nursing home sing-along tonight, and my 9 year-old son thinks they're great--and don't kids have the last word when it comes to cookies?!

thank you so much for the terrific recipe! I thought I would have to freeze half of these cookies was I wrong, they only lasted 2 days in my house and most of them were eaten in the first day! I loved the lemon cookies so did the kids I added 1 tablespoon of poppy seeds, but my kids really loved the second time we made these a Butter Pecan Cake mix I used, then rolled the balls in a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon, my son loves cinnamon. To make it easier to work with the dough I placed it in the fridge for 15 minutes, the dough was then firm enough to roll.

Great recipe! I didn't want to buy lemon extract so I used about 1.5 tsp of lemon juice. I did half of it just like the recipe; the other half, I made a simple lemon glaze with powdered sugar, butter, lemon zest, and some lemon juice then drizzled it over the top, and with the icing instead of powdered sugar, they were absolutely amazing and disappeared!

I didn't have lemon extract on hand, so I used two squeezes of fresh lemon, which tasted fantastic!  The one thing I would change next time, is to more heavily coat my rolled dough with powdered sugar, because when the cookies spread in baking, lightly rolling them in sugar turned out to not be enough.

I was surprised at how well we liked these cookies!  My husband devoured them!  Instead of oil, I used 1/3 heaping cup of applesauce.  I also added a small package of sugar-free lemon jello.  They turned out perfect.  If you like the flavor of lemon, you'll love these easy to make, cake-like cookies!

These cookies are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used the other reviewers' advice and used a TBS of lemon juice, a TBS of lemon zest, and I also added about a 1/4 tsp of lemon extract. I put the dough in the fridge for about 20 hours. It made the dough very easy to roll into balls. I used a little over a tablespoon to form the balls. After rolling the dough in the confectioner's sugar, I baked them for 9 minutes. In my oven, 9 minutes was perfect, they were just browned on the edges and perfectly chewy inside. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

These were easy and good. They did have a funny aftertaste though - I think it was because of the lemon extract. Next time I'd just half the amount used to see if it cut back on the funny aftertaste.

These were simple and good.  I prepared a plated luncheon with a brownie and one of these Easy Lemon Cookies on each dessert plate -- and they were a hit.
I, too, substituted fresh lemon and zest as suggested by another contributor.  One of the luncheon guests said they knew there had to be fresh lemon in it.  Great recipe!  (Just don't under bake them.)

VERY good! I added the finely grated zest of one lemon to bump up the lemon flavor, but I'm sure they'd stand just as is. I baked for 10 minutes, actually, because after the first batch at 8 minutes came out with doughy middles. The last batch got left in the oven by accident for 15 minutes, and they were quite brown. The middles were baked through all the way, and they were somewhat hard. But by the next day, all that had changed to a respectable chewiness, and you couldn't tell that they weren't intended to have been baked that way. Now that's what I like - a recipe with a lot of "wiggle room" that's forgiving, no matter what!

I loved this receipe!!! I was craving something lemony and this hit the spot. Crunchy edges and a chewy inside. Exactly what I wanted. When I made these I used the medium sized Pampered Chef cookie scoop and I think they are just a little too big and almost too much. Next time I will use the small scoop. No disappointment here!! Will definitely go in my recipe book!

I loved these cookies with all my heart! One of the best cookies I've ever made. I used real lemon instead of the extract and I refrigerated the dough for about 15 minutes, then rolled spoonfuls into small quarter size balls and rolled in sugar, turned out great! Will make over and over and over again!

These came out perfect the first time I made them--crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside! Yum! So quick & easy & delicious, even without any lemon extract. This time, however, I added the lemon extract...and they all BURNED on the bottom! Even when I turned the temperature down to 350. I am going to leave the extract out next time...and start with a cooler oven. I'm not giving up. My children are still raving about the burnt cookies! They're that good.

These are really yummy.  I needed a really quick and easy recipe to take something to a pot-luck type thing and these were perfect.  I DID NOT have lemon extract, so I used 2 tsp. of fresh lime juice.  The cookies have a great "citrus" summer taste!  I rolled them into balls and then rolled them into powdered sugar.  I tapped them slightly to get the extra sugar off of them and they were fine.  I did adjust the temperature to 350 degrees like others suggested, however it took them 10 minutes on 350 for my oven to get them done.

I modified this recipe to make "creamsicle cookies":  I used a regular yellow cake mix instead of lemon, and instead of lemon extract, I used vanilla.  Then I tossed in one packet of unsweetened orange-flavored Kool-Aid, and mixed everything up as directed.  The results were fantastic!  After reading all your reviews, I knew I'd have to try this recipe - and I'm glad I did!  So easy and so good!  I'll be making these again and again.

I rarely take the time to put a review out but these cookies are EXCELLENT.  They were so, so easy to make (hardly any clean up since there is no measuring of dry ingredients).  They are a little sticky to roll in sugar but the end result is very, very much worth it.  I put them out at a party last night next to a beautiful chocolate layer cake...I thought no-one would want the cookies but guess what? They were gone in minutes!  Three of my guests called today asking for the recipe.  Try this one....it is wonderful!

If you're looking for a fast, easy recipe with few ingredients-probably ingredients you already have in your kitchen-this is the recipe to make.  You can put them fairly close on your cookie sheet at they do flatten but only slightly.  I was afraid the dough might be sticky to work with when forming balls, but it wasn't at all.  I did bake them at 350 degrees as I read in another review to do and they came out fine.  I will make this recipe again-thanks Lissa.

This is a 5-star recipe if you follow the suggestion of other reviewers and use fresh squeezed lemon juice (1 TB.) and 1 tsp. of lemon zest instead of the lemon extract.  SOOO good...and very easy to make!

This recipe is so simple yet so awesome! I made these to take to my sister-In-laws for a Xmas dinner. I knew EVERYONE would be bringing something chocolate and real sweet! These cookies kinda cleansed the palette after eating all that chocolate! Everyone loved these citrusy morsels as I added lemon zest and the juice of a couple lemons and then added more flour to "dry out" my batter if I put too much lemon juice! Have already baked several batches of these cookies. I already got a request for Thanksgiving!!!??

I never follow anything to the letter. I ran out of lemon extract so I used lemon juice. I used 1.5 eggs and milk. I used a cake mix with only 15.25 oz and added a packet of cheesecake instant pudding. Added a little extra sugar in the mix because my family has a major sweet tooth. Veg oil. 10 min and YummY! Waiting on my triple chocolate cookies to finish as I type this :-)
Also, I dip my fingers in veg oil to make forming the balls easier.

I found these easy and just ok.  My husband loved them, but to me they were a bit too cakey.  I will be making them again as he liked them and they were simple.

I feel a little bad about making these, and here's why: I bring them to parties and people LOVE them.  And I never tell anyone that they took about 15 minutes to make.  I use a powdered lemonade mix (1 packet, for one personal size bottle of water) in place of the lemon essence and powdered sugar (I.e. I just toss it right in with the cake mix) and they come out just fantastic.  If you forgot until the last minute that you agreed to bring dessert to a get-together, here's your solution.

Awesome cookies!!!  I added 1 1/2 tsp. of baking powder, used one egg, and substituted the lemon abstract with 2 tsp. of lemon juice. The cookies are moist and the sugar on top (used cane sugar) is an added bonus.  Quick and easy to make.

The dough was more like a batter, making it hard to form into balls and roll in the sugar. I put it in the freezer a while and it helped some but it was still kind of messy. Overall, they were pretty good but nothing special.

My mom makes these a lot, and the family loves them. But we can't find 18.25 oz cake mixes anymore. All the boxes are 15 or 16.25, and the recipe doesn't work well with this amount. Any ideas out there? We can reduce some ingredients, but the eggs might be the problem.

These were not what I hoped for. I wanted my cookies to be light and chewy with a kick of citrusy sourness. These overly sweet and didn't have much of a lemon taste. I think the culprit was the cake mix. I had a similar experience to reviewers who said that their batter tasted like Fruit Loops. The cookies had the color of lemons but none of the taste. I split the batter in the half and tried to incorporate more lemon juice and zest in the second batch but that didn't help. 

These cookies are certainly easy and a lot people will like them.

I made this recipe  for my hubby and  his employees  and it was a great hit. the only  thing I did different  was added 1/3 cup water and bought a lemon and squeezed the juice out after slightly heating  it, about a tbsp or so to give it a little extra flavor. super light and fluffy and only took 6min. overall  amazing ! and  yes it helps  to chill the batter for about an hour .

Totally easy and delicious recipe.  I agree with the changes of using the zest of one lemon and freshly squeezed lemon juice, about a tbsp.  I also put the dough in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm it up.  Bake on parchment paper, and they are perfect!

Ok, I used 1 1/2 Teas Lemon extract and the zest of one lemon.  They are awesome.  Lemony in the middle and crunchy on the outside.

My friends thought these were completely homemade.  I made them exactly as the recipe suggests and they were fantastic! Great consistency.  The third batch (makes so many) I refrigerated the dough, and as was mentioned in another review, the powdered sugar stuck better.

So simple. Made according to recipe the first time, with a mild lemon flavor as the result. Made again using a large tablespoon of lemon juice instead of the extract...much more lemon flavor & the whole family liked this better.

This recipe was really good. I made them for a family gathering for the first time and they turned out great. What I'll probably change the next time I make them is not putting the confectioners sugar on all sides of the cookie dough. The steps say to roll it around in sugar but when you put sugar on the bottom I found that it burnt and gave the cookie a slight burnt taste. I suggest putting the sugar only on the top. After cooking, I used a sifter to put another layer of confectioners sugar on the top. 

Hopefully these adjustments will help someone :)

My husband loved the sweetness of these.  I loved the chewy cookie and the ease, but I really wanted more lemon flavor.  I used 2 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract, thinking that would do it, but the lemon flavor was still very mild.  No tang at all.

Wanting a quick and easy cookie today, my little girl and I decided to bake these. Followed the recipe closely, except for upping the extract a tad (would've used fresh lemon, but was out). They baked up into very pretty little cookies (DD helped me make these and she dubbed them "lemon snowball cookies.") However, given the fact that the recipe ingredients call for a boxed cake mix and lemon extract, they tasted just like I thought they would. I love anything lemon and I'd love to try these from scratch at some point, using fresh lemon juice & zest and a homemade dough. I appreciate the simplicity of this recipe though!

I would suggest putting it in the fridge for awhile because it doesn't hold when you roll it in the sugar. I also cooked it for 10-11 min since the first cookies were not done in the middle.  They were ok, but I expected more from the 5 stars.

I was trying to use up a box of lemon cake mix in the cupboard that I was gifted. These didn't impress - they're more like dollops of cake than cookies and the lemon flavour is just so incredibly fake (although that's maybe my own fault for using a box mix in the first place...)
Should have just baked a cake with it.

Wonderful recipe and yes I added enhancement to the lemon flavor.  I added 2 tbsp lemon juice, and the zest of two medium lemons.  Be aware what size your eggs are because mine were large and the batter was runny the first time.  ( I added 1/2 cup all purpose flour and two tablespoons of sugar) The second time I used smaller eggs and it was fine.

These were awesome, and so easy to make!  I added 1 tsp. lemon zest in addition to the lemon extract, and made a powdered sugar frosting (1 cup powdered sugar + 1 Tbl. fresh lemon juice + 2 tsp. milk), and that added a LOT of lemon zing!  Without the frosting, I think the recipe needed 2 tsp. lemon zest.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent cookies and so easy to make! I did use 2 T. lemon juice since I did not have extract. Mix this dough by hand and chill overnight to make it easier to handle. Roll into a ball about the size of a walnut and then roll in the powdered sugar. Edges will just be starting to dry when this cookie is done.

What could be easier?  As one reviewer suggested, I used a package of unsweetened lemon kool-aid instead of lemon extract--the lemon flavor really popped!

Made these tonight.  So simple and so good.  I did not have lemon extract so I used a few drops of lemon oil.  Yum!!!  Will definitely make these again.  Wondering how other mix flavors will work.

Easy recipe in the sense that there are few ingredients and prep time. Tasted good. Biggest complaint is that the batter is like glue and my hand mixer jammed and I had to work the rest by hand...not easy!

Adding 1/2c Flour makes all the difference! The dough is really really really sticky and hard to roll without it! :)

I'm rating these 5 stars, giving the recipe the benefit of the doubt; I never seem to have all ingredients on hand so I substituted 1 and 1/2 Tsp clementine zest and vanilla extract for the lemon.  Mine were o.k., but not great, but that's my fault.  I think these would be much better made as 'prescribed'.  They're definitely easy to make and would be a nice cookie to keep in mind when I need to whip a dessert up in a hurry.  I think I prefer crispy lemon cookies, versus these, since they're primarily chewy, but then again, if I made the cookies smaller and flattened them out more before baking, that may help.  All in all, though, very nice and worth the effort:-)

These cookies were like a breath of fresh air.  I didn't have any lemon extract so I used 1.5 Tbsp fresh lemon juice and 1/2 tsp lemon zest.  I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla exract.  Make sure you bake these at 350 degrees, 8-10 minutes.  PERFECT!

OMG these are very delicious! And so easy! This is definitely a fool-proof cookie! I doubled the recipe and brought these into work...they were gone in about 2 hours, and this was even before lunch! Will definitely make these again, might experiment with different cake mix flavors. All in all, very easy, straightforward cookie!

Delicious! I was looking for an alternative to the same old chocolate chip cookie for my daughter's class event and this was it.  I took the advice of some of the other posts and using the lemon extract and added 1T of lemon juice.  It wasn't tangy but that is not what I wanted.  It was the perfect balance of sweet and lemony.  More like a little personal lemon cake.

These are absolutely the easiest, most delicious cookies to whip up in a pinch.  Whenever cake mix goes on sale I stock up on lemon!  I've probably made these at least a dozen times over the past 2 years.  I've got it memorized now.

i love this recipe! It is so easy, and simply amazing. I like my lemons tart. so instead of adding the lemon extract i added 1 to 2 TBS of lemon juice and it adds that little umph that every one enjoys when they eat a lemon drop. i alos only cook them for 7 mins, this way they come out nice a chewy!!!

I want to love these, and in fact they ARE delicious. But mine did not turn out pretty. I may be a victim of high altitude as mine are completely deflated. I'll give these another try, making high-altitude adjustments. But for now, I'm going to be a little embarrassed to put these on my holiday cookie plates.

Recipe was super easy and I followed it exactly however I had to increase the cooking time by at least 3 minutes (~12 min total) and the cookies weren't as pretty as they are in the picture.  After 8 min. cookies were raw in the inside.  Had to put them back in to cook longer.  They got a little brown but were more cooked.  Powdered sugar didn't crackle as much as I would've liked.  Maybe because I baked it longer?  Some looked bare.  Ended up drizzling lemon icing on them after they cooled to make them look better.  Will try again since I love the lemon flavor.

So easy, so good.  Did as another user did when I realized there was nothing even remotely close to 'lemon' in the house- other than the packet of lemonade mix.  REALLY made the lemon flavor pop.  Will definitely be making these cookies again.  Thanks for sharing!

Amazingly simple and good! I didn't have lemon extract and they were still the bomb! They're best cooked for just 6 minutes or til you think they're barely done, we liked them best soft and chewy. The crisp ones were good, too, however.

Very good! Easy - quick! very lemony, too. Keep in air tight container and don't over-cook as mine got a little dry.  I will make again, I'm sure!

Easy and great!  As suggested, use 1 T lemon juice instead of the extract.  I am a NON baker so the ease of this was right up my alley.  This would be a great treat to make with youngsters just learning to bake.

Pretty decent...four stars is because they are soooooo easy.  I make them when I want baked goods, don't want to go the TOTAL cop out of a tube of premade dough, but also don't wanna be measuring out flour, sugar, baking powder, etc. all night and making a mess.  The use of cake mix really simplifies things without feeling like I totally didn't bother.  

These are popular with everyone I know who likes sweet stuff and doesn't mind a somewhat artificial tang...that's the tradeoff of the simplicity of the cake mix route...you're stuck with whatever flavoring the manufacturer uses.  I found the lemon to be a bit fakey-fake (used Duncan Hines, all my store had in lemon), even with my own addition of four packets of Pure Lemon crystallized lemon juice.  Still, a nice change of pace, easy and fast to make, people like 'em, and they go well with coffee.  

Mine were too soft for my taste in the first batch, so I baked them for more along the lines of 12 minutes in subsequent batches, and liked that texture better.

*EDIT*  Second time around, I used SIX Pure Lemon packets, and doubled the pure lemon extract, which improved the lemon flavor vastly...not so much of a Trix cereal flavor anymore, more realistically citrus-y.

WOW, these are so easy and so good!  I made them a little smaller and got 44 of them. I have some orange extract in my cupboard, and if I can find an orange cake, I'm going to try making orange cookies!  And I was thinking about a chocolate cake mix, and adding peppermint extract or almond extract.  All sorts of possibilities!  But oh, seriously, these are so very good if you like lemon, and pretty too.

these cookies are incredible!  i am always looking for a quick cookie to make and take places or just to bake when i'm feeling a little stressed, and these are exactly perfect.  they work with any flavor, not just lemon… my favorite is a white cake mix with a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of raspberry flavoring… adds just the right zing.  small cookies, too, which makes them great for lunchboxes :)

I had heard about these cookies and wanted to try the recipe.  Going by other comments,, I added lemon zest and a heaping tablespoon of lemondade powder. They were a big hit.  Part of my family likes soft and the half likes crunchy cookies.. ..I baked half longer and had the best of both worlds.  I definitely would try again.  I could not detect a cake mix taste.

This recipe is truly simple and quick! My husband loves all things lemon and this recipe did not disappoint. I did not have lemon extract or juice but I had fresh limes and added the juice from 1 1/2 of them. Worked perfectly to add just a little extra zip!

These cookies turned out GREAT. I did double the lemon extract amount as a previous review stated to have the extra lemon kick. To add variety I also added poppy seeds to the mixture to make them a lemon poppyseed cookie! 

I'd also like to add if you prefer a chewy taste, to refrigerate the mixture over night before baking and to remove the cookies as soon as the edges begin to brown.

I saw this recipe and it looked so delicious; but I did not have a lemon cake mix in the house. So, I used a butter pecan cake mix and also crumbled in some pecans in the cookie dough. Delicious. The in-laws and hubby devoured them all. Thanks : )

As written I thought these cookies were good...not amazing but definitely good. I made the following changes which made them MUCH better. Instead of vegetable oil I used 1/3 cup melted butter. I also doubled the lemon extract and added a couple tablespoons of lemon juice as well. I also added a cup of gingerale which made it taste almost fizzy! Gave it a lot more tang and great flavor! I definitely will be making these again!

My aunt made cookies like these for years but would NOT share the recipe! I made these over Thanksgiving when she was visiting and she was so shocked that they were just like her's. I used the same recipe idea and made chocolate and strawberry too. Thanks for a great recipe and the last laugh!

These were ok, the cake mix made the cookie taste too fake. I don't think I will make them again, not with a pre-made cake mix anyways.

This was a simple but delicious lemon cookie!  I used lemon juice, a I didn't have lemon extract and they still came out wonderful.  I did spray my cookie sheets with cooking spray and am glad I did, i think they may have stuck if I didn't.

I love a cookie recipe that does not call for butter!!!  My son is allergic to milk, so I'm in love with this cookie!  I made these  exactly as the recipe calls for ~ in record time, chilled for 30minutes, and rolled in powdered sugar.  They bake up very softly which is great for my 2 year old.  My husband loved these, too.  I'm going to try it with chocolate cake mix tonight!  The lemon favor can be overwhelming, but so much better the next day.

I have to give this five stars for being so simple and so good!  Really like the texture of the cookies and the lemon flavor is really good.  I use zest instead of extract and add a generous tablespoon of lemon juice.  They turn out great.  Hubby liked them too, and he's a real chocolate kind of guy!

I tried it yesterday, and then went out and bought another cake mix to bake more today.  Surprisingly excellent cookie!  I didn't have lemon extract, so I just used lemon juice.  A little crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I read a lot of people say that it tastes like fruity cereal.  Maybe if you use extract, but I found no such flavor in my cookies.  It's a lemony flavor.   I also decided to roll a few in coconut.  They were good, but I don't think they made the cookie itself any better.  The first batch I chilled overnight.  The second batch I chilled about 30 minutes.  If you have time, get the batter cold, but if not, at least wait 30 minutes.  The batch makes around 30-33 average-sized cookies.  This will be a go-to recipe, and I will definitely try it out with other cake mixes.  UPDATE:  I tried this with Red Velvet Cake Mix - Bleah.  I won't do that again!

these were good, but not super special. i used yellow cake mix and rolled them in cinnamon and sugar also, which came out good as well. a very easy recipe without a "wow" factor.

GREAT COOKIES!  They were really yummy!  The batter was a little sticky and I had to bake them about 10-11 minutes to get brown.  This recipe was perfect!  I have a 1 year old and a two year old and I needed something yummy and fast and this recipe provided both!  I had them mixed up and baked in about 45 minutes!  I will definitely be adding this to my must makes!

Absolutely divine!  You can also make orange cookies by substituting orange cake mix & orange extract - really yummy with dried cranberries mixed in & drizzled with chocolate after cooled!!

WOW!  I'd like to give this recipe 6 stars.  They are really tasty.  I made these to take my Bible Study group, and my kids ate so many that I ended up having to make more!  I used 1 Tbsp of lemon juice instead of the extract.  I also learned that you need to put a lot of confectioners sugar on them before you bake--if you use too little, it just disappears and they don't look as pretty.

I got rave review for these.  The only thing I did do different was I got rid of the extract and used the juice and zest from one whole lemon.  Was super lemoney.  And they were so super easy.

This is a good base recipe, however, I made some minor changes that improve the finished cookie.  The basic recipe is a little oily, so I always add 1/4 cup all purpose flour to make a firmer cookie.  **You can also use a 'regular' cake mix, that does not have pudding in the mix and it comes out just as tasty.    For a pretty yellow colored cookie, add 3 drops yellow food coloring.  To prevent spreading, mix, then refridgerate for 1 hour, shape, roll in powdered sugar and baked as directed.   You can also roll them contrasting colored sugar crystals for a fun punch of color.  The crystals make a crispier outer coating that my family likes.    ** Of course, you can use any other cake mix recipe and modify the flavor add-ins to suit your own tastes.    Bake on parchment lined pan for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Cool on pan for 3 minutes, then remove to cool completely on cooling rack.   Enjoy!

This is a great base recipe that you can be creative with - super easy, too.  Instead of lemon cookies, I used vanilla cake mix with vanilla extract, and I rolled them in cinnamon sugar.  They tasted really good; like a snickerdoodle.  Next time I might try rolling in a pumpkin spice sugar mixture.

These were great! I made a 2nd batch with chocolate cake mix and peppermint extract. They turned out great, too!  Great cookie when you're in a hurry.  Little mess and little cleanup.  My coworkers love them.

Loved these, I did a couple things different and didn't get the fruit loop taste at all.  I used the zest of a large lemon, and three teaspoons of fresh lemon juice from same lemon.  Also used egg whites instead of reg eggs to cut calories.  Still moist and delicious.  Definitely recommend using lemon zest and real lemon juice over just lemon extract.  Lemony and moist, very good!

These were nice and easy to make.  I ended up using a white cake mix and real lemon juice instead of extract because that's what I had on hand.  I didn't like the flavor of these cookies at all but maybe it's because I didn't use the right cake mix.  However my 8 year old son LOVES how they taste so I will probably make them again.

I really like these. However, we took them out after the recommened 6 mins and they were very soft/mushy, we let them sit about 10 more minutes to see if they'd firm up but did not. We then popped them back into the oven for another 7 mins. Nice and crispy, yet moist.

Super easy to make. I used fresh lemon juice (zested the entire lemon then squeezed 1/2 into the bowl) and scraped teaspoon-fulls of the batter onto a plate of powdered sugar, tossed around with my fingers and baked on parchment.  The recipe only made a little over 2 dozen for me- I guess some of mine were too big! They smell better then they taste to me.  I wanted more sour. Husband is nuts about them.  Mine look EXACTLY like the picture.

I made these twice yesterday. The first batch I used a Betty Crocker Lemon cake mix and they were wonderful! But they didn't make very many cookies so I decided to make another batch.  The second batch I couldn't find Betty Crocker and got a Duncan Hines and they were awful! The Duncan Hines batch was flat and ugly. Still tasted ok but not near the fluffy, soft , melt-in-your-mouth texture of the Betty Crocker batch.  I took someone's advice and chilled the dough on both batches and this is a very good tip. I also added about a T of lemon juice to both.  So double the recipe but get the Betty Crocker Mix and you'll be very pleased!
UPDATE-  Try melted butter instead of oil, don't roll in powedered sugar- thumbprint and add lemon curd.  Maybe extra baking power?

These were really good, and very simple to make.  I used the zest and juice of a lemon instead of the extract, as I didn't have any on hand.  I also put the dough in the freezer for a half hour to make it easier to work with.  Really nice texture!  We picked these out for my son because he has a milk allergy, and if you use cake mix with no milk ingredients (such as Duncan Hines) you have an easy, milk- and butter-free cookie!

Didn't really care for these.  After reading the reviews, I opted to use fresh lemon juice and some rind in place of the lemon extract but I still did not find the flavor appealing.  I really expected a better cookie.  I won't make these again.

I give these cookies TEN stars!  So delicious!  I've never seen my husband go this crazy over any cookie ever!  He couldn't stop eating them.  The changes I made: used yellow cake mix and 1 tablespoon lemon extract.  Perfection!

I LOVE these cookies.  This is my 1st review ever.  The one thing I changed was I used the juice and zest of a lemon (no extract).  The 1st batch I baked for about 8 min. the 2nd batch 10 min.  and the 2nd batch was perfect.  A word of caution dont take a breath when biting into these.

Love these cookies!  They have a great lemon flavor and are so easy to make.  One tip --- they do spread so give them room on your cookie sheet

These are very good for a quick batch of cookies.  To the people who commented that they tasted fake - what do you expect from a short-cut cookie recipe.  It's like when you bake a cake from scratch vs. from a mix - both are good but home made is much better.

Fantastic!  This recipe is super easy and you don't need to change a thing.  Be sure to cool on a rack to prevent further browning on the bottom of the cookies.  Best of all, they taste as great as they look!

Very nice cookies.  I added some more lemon zest and then I added in some lemon juice--either I made it dryer with the extra lemon zest, or it was too dry.  Either way, I love how these cookies crinkle in the oven, and with the extra zest and juice they are very nice.  Sweet, still, so good for the Christmas cookie tins I'll make, but with a good lemon flavor.  And they really are nice and soft on the inside.  I baked for 10 minutes, partly because I chilled the dough overnight.  I mainly chilled it due to the time factor, but I didn't want them underbaked.  I also used my small cookie scoop to make the cookies, and dropped directly onto powdered sugar.  Perfect.  thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good little lemon cookie.  I agree, however, with a couple of other readers who said it has a bit of a "Fruit Loops" taste..kinda cloying; guess it's the artificial lemon flavor of the cake mix.  Also agree with the readers who said to chill the dough before forming it into balls..gotta do that or it's pretty much impossible to work with.

I wanted to find a lemon cookie that would be an easy base for experimentation and this is definitely THE ONE. I omitted the powdered sugar step because I wanted a tangy cookie.  I added the juice and zest of one lemon and a cup of dried cranberries.  My boyfriend, mom & gram all loved them! FABULOUS!  :)  ***I do recommend refrigerating the dough as that makes it easier to form. I also chilled two spoons and used those to form the dough (instead of handling it) so everything would stay cooler longer.***

Very, very sneaky way to make excellent lemon cookies.  My son called me a "goddess".  I didn't have lemon extract (where the heck did it go???), so I just made it straight.  I'll try it next with the extract, I'm sure it'll be even better.

I like these cookies.  I added 1 T. of lemon juice instead of extract to give it more of a natural lemon flavor.

I made these with orange cake mix / extract and WOW! So good! I can't wait to make them with the lemon. I was searching for a fast & easy dessert for a last minute get together, that's how the orange mix came into play. These are going to fly off the plate, that is if I can keep my husband out of them long enough to get them there! I did reduce the oven temp to 350 and that seemed to work perfectly. If I'd cooked them at the suggest temp the bottoms would have been overdone. These came out perfect and are simply delicious! They'd be even better if they had a drizzle over them.. I'll save that for my next venture.

These were so easy and yummy!  I used lemon infused canola oil for half the amount of oil and left out the extract.  I can't wait to try it with different flavors of cake mix. Great for a quick treat!

These were very easy and very good....the first day!  After that, they got hard and weren't very good unless you pop them in the microwave for a minute.  Since my daughter was selling these for a fundraiser, she was selling them in individual baggies and they didn't keep well that way.  Next time, I"ll store is a ziploc bag w/bread for moisture.

I added a bit more lemon juice and zest but these cookies were exactly what I was in the mood for. Crispy, airy, soft---they reminded us summer was on the way. I added a hint of freshly ground cardomum and some finely ground pistachios for a beautifully contrasting colour and taste. N

Love them!!! Truly addicting for lemon lovers! So fast and easy. I had read that someone said it was better to chill the dough before rolling it in the powdered sugar but I didn't want to wait very long. I just put the dough in the freezer for about ten minutes and it was not sticky - perfect to work with.  Thanks for the tip on chilling the dough!

Very yummy!  Quick and easy. It took less than 10 minutes to have them mixed and in the oven.  My family thinks they taste like lemon cake.  I didn't have lemon extract, so I used vanilla, and my family thought they still had plenty of lemon flavor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Oh my goodness!! These cookies are the BOMB!! Such a nice change from chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal cookies, peanut butter cookies, etc. I baked them in 350 degree oven because that seems to be what I bake all my cookies at. Bake them about 8 minutes and came out nice and soft. Pretty too :-)

This was the first lemon cookie recipe that I have made.  It will not let you down!  These cookies are now my family's and co-worker's favorite!!  I did take the advice of another baker and used 1 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice vs. lemon extract, it really added flavor and freshness to the cookies.  I will be using this recipe quite often!

These truly are simple and taste great!  I used a lemon instead of the extract (it took less than 1/2 of a lemon).  They have great flavor and look nice.  They powdered sugar hardly can be seen after baking so it looks best to sprinkle them again after baking while they are still warm.   I'll definitely make these again - probably many times!

Personally, I didn't like these because they tasted like they were made from a cake mix. I think I am probably too picky because everyone else thought they were to die for. Very lemon-y and very soft.

Made the recipe exactly as listed, and it was way too sweet and artificial-tasting.  Fruit Loops is a good description.

This recipe is awesome, and I didn't change much.  All I did differently was dust the cookies with powdered sugar after baking them, rather than rolling them in powdered sugar before baking.

My whole family loved it, plus my ladies group that I shared them with.. good stuff!

Ok there were interesting to make. Was kind of weird putting soft dough into icing sugar but it worked. They turned out well but I found them really sweet and fruit loop tasting. Not a favourite here. Was too cakelike too.

If I could give this 6 stars I would. I refridgerated the mix for an hour before making into balls and it was a dream to work with. My husband and son are not big lemon fans and they LOVED them.

I really love how easy this recipe is! The cookies turn out light, fluffy, and beautiful. It looks like you've slaved away in the kitchen for hours, when it really couldn't be any quicker. I really like that it is great base recipe for other cake mix flavors. I've tried the confetti type cake mix and substituted 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond for the lemon extract with rave reviews. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

This recipe yields great results with little effort.  I gave my father a plate of these for Father's Day, and he really liked them.  The crackled powdered sugar coating makes it look like you fussed over them.  If you don't like an "artificial" taste, this recipe is not for you.  The only recommendation I have is this: REFRIGERATE DOUGH BEFORE BAKING.  The dough is so sticky that I can't imagine working with it before it's chilled.  I refrigerated it for about an hour and used my cookie scoop to form the balls.  I can't wait to try this with different flavors of cake mix.

I thought these cookies were a perfect shape, had a great texture and taste and looked very pretty-I might add some lemon rind to it next time...

I was very surprised - an awesome cookie. I  prepared the recipe as it read with the exception of sifting the cake mix and then the sugar. This cookie just melts in your mouth!

These are always the first cookies eaten anytime I make them and take them to a get together.  Everyone says they are so yummy and I agree.  I don't make them by rolling them in the powdered sugar though.  I make the lemon cream cheese frosting (from this web site) and ice them.  Today, I decided to do a little something different so I used chocolate fudge cake mix instead and added orange extract instead of lemon.  I'm going to ice them with the lemon cream cheese frosting, but change the lemon to orange again.. I think they will be very yummy.   My mom made these with a spice cake mix and vanilla extract... So yummy!!! The possibilities are endless with this recipe and they are SO EASY to make!!!!

I had already started mixing the ingredients when I realized I only had one egg!  Just added a little extra oil and a little milk to make it the right consistency and these still turned out great!  I also didn't have lemon extract so I used about 2 Tbsp. of lemon juice.  Will definitely be making these again!

So good and so easy. Use 1/2 of oil instead of a 1/3; trust me, it'll work better. Also, refrigerate the dough to make it less sticky and WAY easier to handle. Delicious!

I followed this recipe as is but once the cookies were out of the oven and cooled for a few minutes, I scooped out the middles and filled them with lemon pie filling.

They turned out so good! My dad loves lemon pie and these are now one of his favorites.

I had bunco and had a lot of items to make for my 12 friends.  This was the first thing I made in the morning- too early to taste - and so I hadn't tasted them before their arrival.  OMG everyone LOVED them.  My daughter who didn't think it was too early to eat a sweet cookies tried one the next morning and LOVED IT.  Easy, Easy.  I did refrigerate for 15 minutes per another suggestion and it did make it easier to drop the teaspoon fulls into the confectioner's sugar.  Don't overcook.  They don't look done - but they are!  Thanks!

These are very tasty!  A tad bit sweet, but I think it was because I didn't have confectioner's sugar (used fine granulated instead).  As well, I didn't have any lemon extract so I used almond extract instead.  It came out tasting wonderful - a great combination. Next time I will try a different flavour cake & extract.  The possibilities are endless!

I just made these and the first cookie I tried was pretty sweet so I had another dipped in a glass of skim milk.  WOW!!! They are perfect after you dip it in milk.  It cuts the sweetness and the cookie just dissolves in your mouth.  Scrumptious, plus these are so easy, simple, and PRETTY.  Thanks a lot I will definitly make these again.

This certainly is a quick recipe, but I found that the next day the cookies were a bit dry and tasted like stale cake.  The problem was resolved by putting a few slices of bread into the cookie container.

Super Easy! Very tasty! I added 1 tsp of grated lemon peel. The dough is very stiff so unless you have a mixer prepare to give your arm a workout! I didn't roll them in sugar, I just sprinkled powder sugar over top. If you are looking for quick, easy and pretty tasty then this is for you! If you are looking for gourmet, keep on keeping on.

Yummy lemon cookies!  I did reduce the oven temperature to 350 and increased the baking time to 11 minutes.  I also rolled each cookie into a ball and then put them in the powdered sugar.  They turned out perfect. Comments were that they looked pretty and tasted delicious!

At first I was worried this would taste like something baked in an Easy Bake Oven, but I was so wrong.  These are fabulously chewy and also really pretty with the crinkly tops and powdered sugar.  My kids love them, too. Easiest cookies ever!

These were simply the best cookies I have had yet..and so simple.  My only tip, watch how much powder sugar actually goes onto the cookie before baking it, it just needs a slight dusting, don't cover the cookie.

I agree with the rest. This is a great tasting and easy to make recipe. The lemon is a nice contrast to the usual sweet chocolatey cookies and would be a nice choice for an assorted cookie tray. The lemon is very refeshing and light. I will definitely make these again.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for a cookie exchange last year and got rave reviews.  And it's no problem to let the kids help because it's so easy!

These cookies were easy to make and delicious! I did a double batch with these changes: Instead of lemon extract I used the zest of one lemon and a TBS of fresh lemon juice. Added 1 1/4 cup of white chocolate chips to the cookies. Added zest from a lemon to the powered sugar that I rolled them in before baking. They are not to lemony to me just right!

My dough didn’t turn out like the video. This could be due to my box of cake mix being slightly smaller. I did use smaller size eggs and just slightly decreased the oil amount. These did turn out amazing the only -1 Star is I cannot find a box of lemon cake mix in the size the recipe calls for.

I wanted a really lemony cookie and after reading other reviews I  Added: 1 TBL lemon zest 4 TBL fresh lemon juice. 1 TBL lemon extract 3 TBL lemon pudding and a few drops of yellow food coloring. I used non-melting snow sugar.  Same as powdered sugar wth a little cinstsrtchadded 1/3 cup of flour to make up for difference in cake mix size. Refrigerated dough overnight Dropped by tablespoon Baked for 9 minutes

I made these for the first time. I used the Betty Crocker super moist Lemon cake box, with 2 eggs, and 1/3 cup of vegetable oil. However, I used 2 tsp of lemon extract and then 3 tsp of lemon juice. It was the perfect amount of lemon flavor. The batter was very sticky so I refrigerated it for about an hour, which helped reduce the stickiness. Then I put vegetable oil all over the spoon I used to scoop the balls of cookie dough and I put vegetable oil all over my hands to make it easier to form the balls. It made 16 cookies with dough balls at about the size of a dollar coin each. I baked them at 350 for about 8 minutes. They came out perfect.

These are AMAZING. I was trying to make them with what I had on hand so I used yellow cake mix and lemon essential oil instead of extract. They turned out perfect and are our new favorite cookie!

This is a great recipe for a yummy, quick cookie. If you want the powdered sugar to be noticeable on the baked cookies, make sure you really coat the balls of dough well  before baking. I usually roll the dough balls in the powdered sugar until you can’t see any of the dough through the sugar. They come out really pretty!

After reading most of the reviews and taking many reviewers' advice, I decided to use 2 tbs of lemon juice instead of lemon extract so I would avoid the "fruit loop/artificial" taste. The dough looked a little runny so again taking the advice of those before me, I put the dough in the freezer for a half-hour so it would firm up. It was much easier to deal with when I rolled it in the powdered sugar. I baked them on parchment paper at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. They came out with the perfect fresh lemon taste. The only problem - I need to double the recipe next time!!

LOVE these COOKIES!
I omitted the lemon extract and used the fresh squeezed lemon juice of one large lemon. I also added about 2 teaspoons of lemon zest. Cooked one batch for 10 minutes for ultra soft, vibrant yellow cookies that were topped with a lemon juice glaze.  A second   batch was cooked for 12  minutes for light brown cookies that were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside & topped them with lemon juice glaze  and powdered sugar on top.  This recipe is defiantly a keeper!

This is the first recipe I've rated after trying dozens on this website and adding many of them to a regular menu rotation, but this one blew my family away this Thanksgiving.  Everyone wanted the recipe,  everyone requested them again at Christmas,  and the most surprising thing was that my husband loved them the best out of 4 cookie recipes I did,  the others having peanut butter and/or chocolate  (his favorites), and even given his staunch stand against fruit in desserts.  They also came out just like they look in the picture,  which is not always the way new recipes work out . . . Definitely try these.

Duncan Hines Lemon Supreme cake mix is 18.25 oz. and also (in my opinion), the best cake mix on the market. I followed some who removed the extract and replaced it with lemon juice and zest. I also put the dough in the frigde to firm up and combine flavors. Such a delish and easy recipe!

Made these for work and people loved them. Lots of compliments. They did have that artificial flavor some talk of though. Did that matter? Not really. I'll keep this recipe on hand because they were so easy and good. Liked that they weren't too rich like some sweets can be. Light.

Wonderfully easy to make. I followed the suggestion of others and used lemon juice. Crispy, lightly browned bottoms with chewy, lemony, delectable tops. Recipe is a keeper.

I made these for a cookie exchange and they were awesome. I did realize that Pillsbury is the best cake mix to use for these.  Betty Crocker mix was flat and not as tasteful. I added a tablespoon of lemon juice and fresh lemon zest.  Very good and easy to make.

I love the Lemon flavor.I've also add a 1/8 teaspoon ginger and 1 teaspoon vanilla with carrot and spice cake mixes.As well as 1 teaspoon of vanilla for chocolate cake mixes.Also add your favorite nut or flovored chips to make the cookies your own.For the holidays add peppermint extract chocolate cake mix with crushed red and white candies on the tops of the cookies.

I’ve made these a couple times now and I absolutely love these cookies, except they completely flatten out instead of staying in a typical cookie shape.  It’s frustrating, but I still keep making them since the texture and  taste is that good.  I  I tried as per the other reviews to put it in the fridge for awhile , but that didn’t really help.  Going to try putting them in cupcake tins.  Maybe that would work???

I have made these cookies again and again! I love them, my family loves them, my friends love them! I follow the recipe exactly, and it comes out great! It is so easy- you literally mix everything together, roll it up and bake it. THREE STEPS!! I add food coloring to the dough sometimes, and they looks so cool! When I tested by making three red ones, no one wanted a boring yellow one! It looks great, tastes great and is the easiest cookie to make ever. I love them to death, so will you!

I tried 2 recipes, 1 with cool whip & this one.  This one far surpassed the other.  It was easier to make, easier to work with, looked better & tasted better.  Winner all around!

Just to set the stage-- I'm a beginner, so I'm not great in the kitchen. These cookies were awesome. They were very easy to make, they were easy on my wallet, and everyone loved them. I will definitely be making these guys again.

These are the best lemon cookies I've ever tasted!! I don't like cake like cookies so I did not use extract, instead I zested and juiced an entire lemon. This gave them great flavor and made them crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside!! I decreased the temp to 350 and baked for 10-11 minutes. This is a must try!!

I made these to take to a "room-painting party" at my daughter and son-in-law's new home.  I provided lunch and cleaned up while everyone else picked a room and got busy painting.  These cookies were a hit, but I think they weren't really lemon-y enough - next time I'll add some lemon zest to them.

Used the fresh lemon juice instead of the lemon extract (as many other bakers recommended).  Turned out perfect!  I love cookie scoops (if you don't have one, get one!)

I've made these so many times, my husband LOVES them. I even brought them to a work potluck and everybody raved about them! I've also tried the chocolate version which is good, almost tastes like brownies.  I just used devil's food cake and chocolate extract, add some chocolate chips, and instead of rolling in powdered sugar roll in regular granulated sugar. Yum!

This makes cookies that are tasty in a "store bought" rather than homemade way.  Other reviewers compare the flavor to fruit loops and I would agree with that comparison.  Good luck finding an 18.25 ounce cake mix as they've been downsized.  I still made the cookies according to the directions with my 16.5 ounce Duncan Hines Lemon Supreme cake mix and the cookies turned out well.

These were pretty tasty and a welcome change of pace.  I'm still working on the balance of lemon juice I prefer, but it's definitely a keeper when I need a simple, unusual cookie!

These were super easy and delicious. In reading other reviewers' comments, I made the following changes: use 2tsp of lemon extract and the zest of 1/2 lemon, roll the balls quite small (quarter sized) because the cookies spread and become quite large, double roll them in icing sugar, and really keep an eye on them as they burn quite easily on the bottoms.

Easy and super quick. I used an orange cake mix, but with the lemon extract and a bit of lemon peel.  I'm calling them citrus crinkles.

Great, easy cookie!  Made with Ener-G egg replacer because of my son's egg allergy, and they turned out great!  I did have to cook for about 12 min, I did 9 min at 375 F and a last few minutes at 350 because it seemed like the bottoms were getting pretty brown.

Tasted great!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and replaced the tsp of lemon extract with a Tbsp of lemon juice.  Perfect amount of lemon.  Make sure to fully stir the batter so there are no lumps!

Oh my! My husband and I fought over who got the last one! Finally we agreed to slit it. Soft, slightly chewy with a perfect lemon flavor. Just an all-around wonderful cookie. I will be making these quick and easy to make yummies again and again!

I love this cookie. I took them to a work potluck a year ago and now I no longer have to think about what to bring to the next because my co workers beg me for these. I love that they are so simple. I do bake them at 350 for 10 mins. I have also made them using strawberry cake mix. Nice strawberry lemonade flavor.

I took the advice of several others and added lemon zest plus another 1/2 teaspoon extract.  The cookies are great, however, don't believe the "ungreased cookie sheet" - they will stick to the pan!  I used my silpat sheet in one pan & went "ungreased" in the other.  The sheet with silpat took a minute or two longer to bake, but the bottoms did not stick to the pan, while the ungreased sheet had to be soaked clean.

This is a simple recipe and the results are terrific. I did take the advice of another reviewer and refrigerate the dough; it makes it so much easier to handle.  It is a favorite of both friends and family. To the reviewer who is critical of using cake mixes; I understand your point of view but when you have a full plate in life, shortcuts are appreciated when time is limited but it is still important to do something "homemade". Enjoy.

These are the best cookies I've ever made! So easy and perfectly lemony. I got it out of the Family Circle. In there, a reader suggested using lemon juice (1 tbsp.) versus extract (1 tsp.). I've also made a chocolate version replacing the cake mix with chocolate and the extract with vanilla. Also delicious!! I've also heard, but have not tried, strawberry and carrot versions.

These are so yummy! Super easy to make and they come out moist, chewy and delicious. I also added 1 Tbsp of lemon juice instead of the lemon extract and was glad I did! Can't wait to try this recipe idea with other cake mixes - I see red velvet cookies in my future!

I followed the directions and thought they were a little under done, more gummy then chewy. the second batch I cooked until the edges were brown. They came out more crispy but not as good as the first batch. My original problem was, I didn't let the cookies cool long enough. they need to set. Once they set, they are KILLER. I also cut the size to vanilla wafer sized and they came out just as good.

My Allrecipes magazine was in the mail yesterday. As soon as I saw these lemon drop cookies I rushed to the grocery for a lemon cake mix. At 5:30 this morning my oven was preheating while I was mixing  up a batch of the cookies.  Love at first bite!

These were exactly what I was looking for!  They were moist, delicious, beautiful and they had that perfect lemon flavor I was looking for.  I had just tried difficult recipes for lemon shortbread cookies and a labor intensive lemon cake to give as gifts, but I'm sold on these after going down the more difficult road.  Not only did they taste better, but they are SO easy!  I'll confess that I didn't have the lemon extract so I did substitute 1/2 tsp of lemon oil (I had from the other recipes) and 1/2 tsp freshly squeezed lemon.

I used 1 tsp. lemon juice and 1 tsp. lemon zest in place of the lemon extract as many others did. It came out great! Very easy, but so delicious! I brought this to a party, and everyone else loved it too.

Yummy and easy. Will probably make these again, but maybe with icing next time because the confectioners sugar disappeared almost entirely.

My Betty Crocker cake mix was 3oz short of the recipe box mix weight.  I added a Tablespoon of fresh lemon juice for extra flavor. Needed to chill the dough to be able to roll into balls in the powder sugar.  Flattened each ball with bottom of a glass before baking.  It took double the time to bake these, than in the recipe.  Best to cool on the pan, if you want them a little crisper.  The finished cookie looked nice and tasted nice.  Next time I will look for a lemon cake box mix with the same weight as the recipe.

Super easy and I always seem to have these ingredients on hand.  Everyone in the family loves these and my 4 & 5 year olds love helping to roll them in the powdered sugar.  

For a more complex cookie add lemon zest and cardamom to the batter and also more cardamom with the powdered sugar. 

Yum!

I loved the texture of these.  Chewy on the outside, soft on the inside, just like the recipe says.  However, I like more tartness in my lemon recipes, so next time I'll add more lemon to it.  I did zest 1 lemon but that wasn't enough.  Everyone loved them tho, and one friend even said they were the best she's ever had!

Very simple to make, at first I was concerned I made them too big, but a little extra cooking time and they turned out perfect.  Second batch I made a little smaller.  Got rave reviews from the family!

These cookies are so good!  Very moist and lemony and the ease of making them is a big bonus.  I took these to a Girls Luncheon and they all asked me to email them the recipe when I got home.

These are insanely delish! I make them in double and triple batches because they go so fast. I also tried them with a gluten free cake mix and met with success as well. They are easier to work with if you chill the dough for five or ten minutes. Much easier to handle. I too had to lower the temperature to 325 And bake for 6-8 minutes. This is a keeper!!

I substituted 2T lemon concentrate for the lemon extract and some lemon peel but it still needs more lemon flavor.  I will add more next time.

These are so delicious and easy to make!!!  I just made them today, and they are tasty.  Taste just like lemon bars, but in cookie form.  I doubled the lemon extract to 2 teaspoons based on some other reviewers thoughts on them not tasting lemony enough.  I just sampled one and they came out perfect!

I didn't have a lemon cake mix so I used a white cake mix and added 2 1/2 teaspoons of lemon extract and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and then I rolled the dough in the confectioners' sugar...wow, they were scrumptious! I also used a chocolate cake mix with about 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, rolled them in confectioners' sugar and the end result tasted like a delicious, bite-size brownie. These easy and yummy cookies will definitely become a favorite.

These were good but we would have liked them more lemony...i used a large pampered chef scoop and watched them like a hawk in the oven. I will say that they looked underdone on the top and then were too cooked for my taste on the bottom. I would make them again becuase my kids loved them and they were super easy but i think the temp is a bit too high so i am going to try 350 and see if that helps the overcooked bottom. also: spray your cookie sheet with non-stick spray...they stick a bit-

Awesome easy cookies.  I sprinkle more powdered sugar on them after removing from the oven.   They have been a huge hit at potlucks.  They are my go to cookie when I want to bring them to an event.

Super easy. Mine flattened out more than I liked, but they stayed soft. Husband said repeatedly that they were his favorite cookie EVER. Not my favorite as they seemed box-mix flavor rather than smotherly cookie richness, but they were good!

I used the zest of one lime and a Tbs of lime juice instead of lemon extract and they turned out delicious! like mini lemon cakes. So easy to make, only bad part is that they don't last long on the plate:(

This is an easy peasy recipe that's delicious.
Maybe people that had to cook them for ten mins. made bigger cookies than tsp.  For the first time ever I used a real tsp. I never realized how tiny they're supposed to be. Thanks for the recipe.

I used a French vanilla box mix someone gave me and put in a little vanilla extract and some lavender essence instead of making a lemon one. Very good! Some box cake mixes are very, very sweet, though, so choose carefully.

Very good cookies.  I used the juice and zest from one lemon instead of the extract and baked them at 350 for 11-12 minutes.  If you are craving lemon bars but are short on time make these instead :-)

These were super easy and SUPER delicious. I made them last night and only have about 4 left.(Its only me and my husband) Highly reccomend. I also accidentally put 1 tbsp of lemon extract instead of 1/2 tbsp like the recipe calls for. I loved the way they tasted so I'm glad I made that mistake lol.

Five stars for this one. Tart and sweet all in one. I made them for my adult son's birthday. (He loved lemon birthday cakes when he was young.) Sending lemon cookies through the mail is easier than sending a lemon cake. :-)

These tasted great and turned out very pretty (just like the picture).  The reason I'm rating these 4 stars and not 5 is because they are more labor intense than I like.  The batter is very quick and easy, but the batter is a little sticky (I refrigerated overnight) and it is somewhat cumbersome to roll these in powdered sugar.  If I make them again I'll probably try using a cookie press as another reviewer suggested and maybe just dusting with powdered sugar.

I substituted lemon extract with lemon juice thanks to another reviewers suggestion. They turned out beautifully and it looks like a new favorite I'll be "forced" to make every holiday :) 

FYI: They did spread out quite a bit with cooking, so leave space.

These are very good.  I didn't have lemon extract so I used fresh lemon.  I wanted a really lemony cookie and these fit the bill.  I see where people said they are a little cake like, but are wonderful.  I was planning on freezing some for Christmas, but not sure there will be any left.  My husband gives them a thumbs up.  They look just like the picture.  I refrigerated them for a couple hours and they were a perfect to roll.  Thanks for the recipe.  I also used my convection oven and it worked great.

Super Yummy and very simple to make! We used a cherry chip cake mix and Almond extract. My husband and son like their cookies soft and these were perfect! Soft and chewy with just a hint of crispy on the outside.

These are simply delicious. I used the juice and zest of 1 lemon instead of extract. Perfect little morsel.

i love this recipe! i've been making it for my friends for years. I initially made them because I was very fond of the ones that were sold in stores, but i guess they stopped making them. Now, I just make them for my friends whenever i see them! They're so appreciative of them!

Just loved these cookies.  They are a very simple cookie but the taste is great.  I sent them to my son in college and they were a big hit with him and his friends!  I can't wait to try a chocolate version!

Perfect!  I didn't have lemon extract on hand, so I substituted almond extract.  They were terrific.  Yes, they're sweet, but isn't that the point of a cookie?

I tasted the first one, and it was good, but I had the idea of adding powdered vitamin C to the powdered sugar to give it more tang.  I dipped the finished cookies in the mix, and WOW!  Does anyone remember Charlie Chips' lemon cookies?

deeelicious.  i just made  a batch for the first time.  they needed several extra minutes to bake though.  i baked them on stoneware cookie sheets, so that could have made the baking time a little different, also.  and to be honest, i had to throw out the first sheet of cookies because they were so raw in the middle.  but with the second batch, i started them out for 10 minutes, then added one or so extra minutes.  i used a little more lemon extract.  and did add some lemon zest .  i LOVE how lemon zest adds so much zing to stuff. can't wait to do another batch sometime...soon.

I added about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of fresh lavender. It took this recipe from okay to amazing. A little food coloring made them prettier too. 
I am an avid and adventurous cookie-maker, and my man said these might be his favorite of all the cookies I've ever made!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I was kind of weary because it was made from a cake mix, but couldn't believe how good they were once I'd made them.  I baked them to take to my students on the last day of my student teaching and they were gone instantly.  So good.

This was a great recipe that literary takes minutes to make. I was in a pinch for a church function. I switched it with Butter Pecan cake mix and used vanilla extract instead of lemon and they turned out better then I was expecting. For my next cookie exchange I am going to use cherry chip. p.s. Use a teaspoon to make your cookies not a small scoop so it is easier to grab.

These cookies are always such a hit when I make them. A couple of things- the dough should be chilled before rolling. It's a very sticky dough! Also, I find it tastes so much better if you use a real lemon for the juice, and also mix in some lemon zest. It really makes the cookies taste amazing.

These cookies are extremely easy to make. I added the zest of 1 lemon & the juice of 2 lemons in addition to the lemon extract because the friend I made them for likes really lemony desserts.  They are very soft and chewy, which I like in a cookie. They do have a bit of a "Fruit Loop lemon" flavor but I happen to like Fruit Loops so I found them to be quite tasty. Tips to others: refrigerate the dough (it does make it easier to roll) & don't cook these cookies past 7.5 minutes or else the bottom will be very brown & you'll lose some of the cakey-ness.

Oh gosh these are good! I make these for a local soup kitchen and thank goodness I get them out of my house before I eat them all.   I pick up the cake mixes when they go on sale for super cheap, it makes a quick, inexpensive but impressive cookie when you need one.   For added oomph, instead of rolling in powdered sugar, I make a glaze with lemon juice and powered sugar and dipped the tops of the cooled cookies into that and then let dry. *heaven* Just like my grandma's lemon bars (without all the work).

very very good! these are some of the best lemon cookies i have ever had. I would cook your first batch 6 minutes then add if you have too. They are quick, easy, simple, and taste just as good as lemon cookies made from scratch.

Always good. I live in Thailand, actually, and couldn't get lemon cake mix. So I just used a white/yellow cake mix and dumped in 1/2 bottle of lemon flavoring. Worked great!

i've made this cookie before. (before i saw this recipe. i always just mess around with cake mix type cookies) and this is pretty much the exact recipe i used, except i like to add about half an 8oz package of cream cheese. just adds a little more texture; makes them nice and moist and keeps them that way. overall, a very delicious, satisfying cookie.

I must admit I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised. These are easy impressive and very tasty. A nice soft slightly chewy cookie. I have made these with two different lemon cake mixes. I added some lemon icing drizzle to the 2nd batch. I did this with a spice cake mix too. The Spice cake cookies were a hit recently and I just added a touch of ginger and rum extract to the mix. YUMMY! thank you Lissa.

I make these every Christmas and have done so for years!  You can also change the flavor by using different flavors of cake mix: chocolate, strawberry, cherry, orange (especially good!), pineapple, etc.  The dough is a little difficult to handle at times (I only scoop a little more than a teaspoon at a time) but dipping them in the confectioner's sugar and rolling them helps with the stickiness.  I am always asked for the recipe and have made them so often that I have memorized it!

These are GOOD. I added about 1 TBSP fresh squeezed lemon juice (one lemon) instead of the extract. I baked mine for about 7 minutes and they were perfect. Definitely don't bake for longer than that, even if they don't seem done yet- cooking them any longer makes them burnt on the bottom and a bit tough when they cool. I also sprinkled them with powdered sugar AFTER cooking- rolling them in it beforehand was pointless, the sugar just kinda disappeared after they were in the oven. Got rave reviews, I will be making these again often- so EASY!!

These came out good. I made them great by adding 1/2 tsp Kool-aid lemonade flavored drink mix to the cookie dough and 1/2 tsp. to the powdered sugar. Took care of that "fruit loop" flavor and tasted a lot like my old favorite Lemon Cooler cookies. They came out chewy and tart.

Excellent easy cookie.  I made them for my daughters wedding and I'm sure they will be a hit!  I'll have to make more batches because the one's that I made didn't make it to the freezer!

Super good and super simple cookies!  Like many others - I added fresh lemon juice in place of the extract - along with the zest of a lemon.  I think I added about a T of juice.  The batter is very thick and sticky...to the point that I looked at the recipe to see if I had left anything out lol.  That's just the way it is - and it results in a wonderful and moist cookie that looks gorgeous with the cracking and powdered sugar.  Definitely do not overcook :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best cookie I have ever made. I have made 5 batches in the past week - because everyone asks for more! The flavor is amazing and the recipe is super easy. The one "change" is that I flatten them slightly after rolling in powdered sugar. I still cook them for the same amount of time and they come out picture perfect. This one is now my go to recipe for the "wow" factor when baking cookies.

How wonderful!!!! My husband loves them and my two year old loves to help make them! So far I have made the lemon, Double Chocolate, and Red velvet. Red velvet is amazing! I made some for a bake sale, and they were the first thing to go! Thanks for this recipe!

These cookies are amazing. I use about a T. of lemon juice instead of extract. We don't mind the "fruit-loop" taste, I guess it just tastes good to us. It's personal preference, I suppose. The texture of these cookies is TO DIE FOR, and they're so gooey and lovely. Bake them exactly as long as the directions say, I burnt them the first time thinking they weren't done.

I definitely love the texture of these cookies... I added lemon juice instead of the extract but still not enough lemon flavor though... I will make them again but this time I'm gonna add some lemon zest and some more lemon juice

Good & Easy recipe...if you are in a pinch to make cookies.. They are best the day you make them..otherwise they don't taste as good. I prefer home baked cookies, but these are good in a hurry.

I am used to "crisp" lemon cookies so although these looked beautiful, I was thinking, "Nah, not a repeat".  Then, I took them to my bridge club: geez, they were gone in minutes and people were asking for the recipe"!!  I was amazed at the reaction to such an easy-to-make cookie!  Definitely a repeat!

These are super easy and delicious. I agree that lemon zest adds a better lemon flavor than extract but really, you can't mess these up. Also, the confectioner's sugar is not really necessary, they look good and crackly (despite the fact they are soo soft) even without it.

These make up really fast and were tasty but seemed to lack that 'pop' I like in a lemon dessert.  I think a lemon glaze might turn these into a 5 star recipe.

These cookies were great!  I added a few drops of lemon juice in addition to the lemon extract and did not notice a "fruit loop" taste at all.  I think chilling overnight definitely improved the dough.  The powdered sugar did seem to bake into the cookie, so I sprinkled some extra on after they cooled.  Yum!  Were gone within minutes.

This recipe got mixed reviews - I thought they were too sweet and tasted kind of koolaidy... wonder if it was the cake mix I used? However, the people who requested I make lemon cookies this Christmas loved them, as did my brutally honest sister, who asked if she could bring ALL the left overs home since I didn't like them much. I did like the texture and look of them a lot, and would make them again for other people as well as experiment with cake flavors I might like more.

I like the chewy texture and they were easy to make.  Just not enough lemon flavor and I added both lemon extract & lemon juice.  Mine also did not turn out as pretty as the picture.

Yummy cookies!  I used lemon flavored icing after the cookies had cooled instead of the powdered sugar.  I topped the cookies with lemon zest for an extra lemon kick!  Turned out very good and my kids ate them up!

WOW very delicious.  Mine actually turned out just like the picture!  That doesn't happen too often.  The only thing I did different was added 1 TBSP lemon juice because I did not have lemon extract.  You do have to get the timming right though, my 1st sheet was a little under done I think, the 2nd one was perfect!

These are very tasty but rich and sweet!  For me, one cookie is enough to eat.  I halved the recipe using a box of Jiffy Lemon cake mix which made 20 cookies.  I baked the first batch for 10 minutes to achieve a slight brown--good.  The next batch I baked for 8 minutes which was perfect.  Next time...if I have time...I will refrigerate the dough before forming the cookies as it was very soft.

I brought these cookies to a work Christmas party.  No nobody was eating them.  I started harassing people to try them and then the rest of the day people kept stopping by my office to grab another.  I got e-mail by a dozen different people asking for the recipe.  I will definetely make these again.

Very good cookies.  My whole household liked them.  And they are a great, easy recipe for young children to help out with too. My daughter helped by rolling the dough balls in the powdered sugar.  We will be sharing them with our playgroup tomorrow.  We will definitely make these again.

Instead of the lemon extract, I used 1 T lemon juice and the zest from one lemon and they turned out wonderful.  Everyone at work loved them--got no complaints. I love how they are soft & chewy on the inside and firm on the outside.  I really doused mine in powdered sugar to get the crinkled look of the featured picture--I thought it made it prettier.

better-than-average cookies, but certainly not the best i've ever had. the powdered sugar kind of disappeared during the baking process, so i made a quick icing with powdered sugar, a little milk, and some lemon extract, and piped it onto the cookies. they look pretty and nobody'll guess they came from a box.

Love these cookies!!  Thought the teaspoon size drops of dough were a bit small so I tried some using a tablespoon.  Both came out great without having to adjust the cooking time.  After making the first batch of cookies I let the dough sit a bit and it was much easier to handle.  Very easy recipe that does not take a lot of time to prepare, and the cookies taste wonderful!!!  By far these are my favorite cookies of the season.

Very good cookie, so easy to make. I used juice from half a lemon vice extract.  I did put the dough in the fridge for awhile prior to baking as was suggested in other reviews.  My hubby and kids really liked them.  This will be a keeper for my family.

These cookies were the biggest hit at my cookie party! Everyone raved! Only thing I added was a couple handfuls of dried cranberries! I cant wait to try this recipe with Lime or Orange cake mix, perhaps even Strawberry!

As many others have touted, these were dee-vine!!!  Hubby said I outdid myself (and they were sooo much easier than the usual cookies I make!)  I did add what equaled to about a tsp of lemon zest and a tsp of lemon juice.  Love, Love, LOVE these!  Next:  Spice cake cookies - will have to figure out if needs any extra seasoning and if I should do powdered sugar deal with them.  Thanks for sharing Lissa - a winner of a cookie for sure!

I used this recipe for a cookie exchange and these cookies were a hit! I will make them again. As suggested in a previous review I used freshly squeezed lemon juice in place of the lemon extract and refrigerated the dough overnight...YUM!!!

Made these easy cookies this AM. Did not have lemon cake mix only white cake mix.Used grated lemon zest from 1 small lemon and lemon juice from 1/2 of the lemon. Delicious ....Rolled in the confectioners sugar and they looked even better than the picture. Easy, Easy, Easy! Crispy on the outside ,chewy in the middle, with just the right hint of lemon! Thank You for the great recipe!

Wonderful! Wanted a little something different to add to my holiday gift baskets & this was the perfect choice. Based on other reviews I made a few changes....used zest from almost entire lemon, half tsp squeezed juice from same lemon, and half tsp lemon extract. After mixing let sit in fridge overnite. Cold dough is much easier to work with, but I still sprayed my hands with Pam to keep dough from sticking. Mine did not look fluffy like photo but were still chewy with crispness on outside. Nothing like fruit loop flavor. Thank you for sharing recipe to this wonderful cookie Lissa!

I made these cookies along with others and gave them in Christmas tins as I visited different families over the holidays. They were so easy and have a yummy lemon flavor, at the time I baked them I had no lemon extract, we had a huge snow storm and going to the store was not a good idea, so I added vanilla as a replacement.  They turned out great.

These were really quick. Made and baked all the dough in less than 30 minutes.  Made these with on hand ingredience so used a yellow cake mix and zested one lemon for added flavor.  Will make with the lemon mix next time for even more lemon flavor.

I wonder how they would be with chocolate cake mix or spice cake mix?  They are some of the best cookies I ever made!  The next time I make them, I will try using lemon juice and zest instead of extract.

First time making lemon cookies, and my advice is to not over-bake them.  Trial and error gave me a good batch for cookie donation for school.  I ended up using lemon juice and rind in place of the extract after reading reviews.  Will make again!  Thank you!

The best cake mix cookie I have tried - my son adored them. I couldn't track down my lemon extract so I used the juice of 1 lemon. It was perfect - and did not taste like fruit loops at all to any of us!

WOW!  I just finished making 6 dozen of these cookies, and they are already disappearing as they are cooling!  My husband said it's the first lemon cookie he's had that actually tasted like lemon.  Like a few other users, I used a package of lemonade koolaid and 1 1/2 t. of lemon extract. I doubled the recipe, and refrigerated the dough for 15 minutes, but I rolled the dough into balls about the size of a golf ball and the rolled them in the powdered sugar.  I baked the on parchment paper at 350 for 10 minutes, 2 pans at a time, and came out with 6 dozen cookies exactly!  THIS IS THE PERFECT LEMON COOKIE RECIPE!  Thanks for sharing!!!

These were awesome! I made some changes thanks to the most helpful reviews. I added the zest & juice of 1 lemon instead of the extract and I chilled the dough overnight before scooping & baking them - I also baked them for 10 mins @ 350 like I do all cookies. These were my brother-in-law's birthday gift and he only got 2!

These are very good cake mix cookies.  Very easy, too.  Just don't expect bakery caliber, it is cake mix after all.  I made them with my 2 year old during my son's nap and had no problem finishing them up in a short period of time.  She loved rolling them in the powdered sugar.  We got just under 40 smallish cookies. The batter is a little oily, but did not produce an oily cookie. I baked for about 10 minutes and the bottoms were brown, but not burned.  We also keep them in a closed container.  They stay on the softer side this way.

These are excellent cookies!  Very easy to make and make for a wonderful summer treat.  Followed recipe exactly.. but may use fresh lemon juice next time.  Roll the cookies generously in the powered sugar.. and double the recipe if you want more - this recipe only makes about half of the amount it says it does (unless you make quarter size cookies!) Highly recommend this recipe!

Very good!  Fast and tasty!  Just what they promised to be, yummy lemon cookies!  They do taste slightly like fruit loops, but if you like fruit loops, it isnt a problem!  I am making these as I type this, to send to my hubby in Iraq.  Also am going to try some with devil's food choc. cake mix.  YUM!

Yum Yum!  So easy and fast.  I drizzled a lemon glaze over the tops of some and rolled others in the powdered sugar.

I didnt know how this would turn out, but I am pleasantly suprised! They are really good, I added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and it made them super yummy! I also used a chocolate cake mix and added almost 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to try something different. I will definately be making over and over again!!!

Fantastic texture and they stayed moist.  I under baked them slightly and they were better the next day.

Yummy.  Slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  We ate them up in less than 24 hours.  My kids couldn't get enough of them.  I made them just as the recipe stated.

Very easy and fast.  NOTE: Dough does NOT need to be refridgerated!    I tried it both ways, and refridgerating the dough makes the edges dry, flaky, and harder to work with in the end.  Following the original instructions, just use a 2nd spoon to help get the dough out.  Once its in the powdered sugar, it is malleable and very easy to shape and work with.

i have made these a million times.  They are very easy, verrrrry attractive and a pleasant change from the usual array of cookies.  Not to mention the fact that they freeze fabulously.  Ok...it's really the fact that they are so incredibly simple that makes them my fave!  I'll admit it.

I made two batches of these (along with several other types of cookies) and sent them to my husband in Iraq. He shared them with the guys in his unit and they were a BIG hit! Super easy to make and delicious!

These cookies were really fun to make.  Don't worry if you don't have lemon extract, simply use lemon juice and they will come out delicious.  Be careful with cooking them, as some could turn out quite crispy on the outside.

As one reviewer recommended, I substituted yellow cake mix for lemon and used two teas. of lemon extract, I rolled them in a mixture of granulated sugar and lemon zest, I even forgot to refrigerate them first, and did not find them too sticky at all. Delicious and easy. And it didn't taste like it was from a cake mix. Thanks for the recipe.

I'd actually give this 4 1/2 stars.  When will Allrecipes allow us to do that?  We loved the taste but I found the dough to be very sticky, even after refrigerating overnight.  I did use the juice and zest of a lemon rather than the extract.  As far as the Fruit Loop taste, my husband is a fan but didn't think they tasted like that and he gave the cookies 5 stars...which is rare for him.  I had to lightly oil my hands to roll them.  That's how sticky this batter was!

Yummy Cookies. I added 3 tsp of lemon juice and the zest of one lemon into the mix. Still not quite as lemony as I'd like, so on the second batch I put a few drops of lemon juice on the cookie shortly after it came out of the oven and that was better. Pretty looking cookies, easy too (even w/ all of my alterations!)

SO easy and SO good!  For those concerned about the "Fruit Loop" flavor, try using a yellow cake mix instead of lemon-flavored.  I did this, added 2 tsp. lemon zest, a couple tsp. of lemon juice, and still added the lemon extract.  They turned out to be very delicious and lemony. I like it that they are chewy, and that they look so delicate.  They disappear quickly.  This is a keeper - thanks!

I gave this 5 stars because it delivers what it said: a simple, cheap, lemon cookie. If you like lemon cake, you will like this one. Made for son's preschool and kids and teachers raved. Took to Christmas party and guests raved.

This was exactly what I was looking for: quick, easy, incredibly delicious, and adding a good variety to our cookie plate. Thanks so much!! I would advise other users of this recipie to not put the lemon extract in until all other ingredients are added. Thanks again!!

-Diana's daughter- Absolutely amazing!! I followed the advice of some of the reviewers here (the store was out of lemon cake mix) and used yellow cake mix instead. They all turned out beautifully! Everyone I gave them to raved about it. I also used 1 T lemon juice and some lemon zest on the first batch. This is too little lemon taste, and I recommend using more lemon juice if not using lemon cake mix. I will definitely be making these again.

These were amazing. Easy does not begin to describe the process. I had no extract so I used about 3 T lemon juice and 1 t lemon zest. I refrigerated for a few hours, but probably didn't need to do that. They are so delicious. They are like a soft lemony sweet sugar cookie. These are my new go to cookies. I want to try it with chocolate cake mix next. Thank you.

DELISH! People are complaining that these taste like Fruit Loops. Well, I happen to love Fruit Loops! They're made from lemon cake mix and taste like it. If you're expecting the flavor of lemon bars or something a little more sour, make something else. These cookies are super easy and taste great... kinda addictive. heehee

These were so good and extremely simple to make!-Tasted just like lemon bars. I followed the recipe exactly, but I too refrigerated the dough over night and it made them very easy to work with. Definetly something I'd make again.

Just made them! Delish! Substituted cinnaomon apple sauce for vegetable oil. Used lemon zest and juice of 1 lemon. Refridgerated before rolling in sugar to bake. Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside! Yum!

Wow, this is a great recipe! Instead of the lemon extract, I used a tablespoon of lemon juice and some lemon zest, and I baked them for 10 minutes.  Having a slight golden brown edge around the cookie didn't take away the chewiness at all.  These cookies really are chewy and fluffy.  Best of all, they freeze really well and remain just as chewy and fluffy once they have been thawed to room temperature.  The recipe is so easy.  I will definitely be making this again.  I might even try some other cake flavors.  Thanks!

Really good and SUPER EASY!  I added the juice and zest of one lemon and only a dash of the lemon extract.  I chilled the dough, but it was still a bit sticky to work with... I just kept my hands a bit damp and rolled the dough balls in the sugar until thoroughly coated, then pressed them down a bit.  Glad I read reviews first- the baking time is definately 12 minutes exactly, not 6-9 as listed in the recipe.  One thing though, these cookies are not great hot out of the oven, but once you let them cool completely, they're fantastic.

These were great! I have also made cake mix cookies with 2 eggs and a stick of butter.  I bake until the tops crackle - they are done and a bit chewy.  For a fun twist next time I am going might add 1 cup rice krispies and some lemon zest.

What a great cookie!  I am having people over tomorrow and we are just having homemade pizza, garlic bread and a side salad.  I wanted to have a light little treat afterward and have been on a cookie making kick (my DH is out of town and the kids and I enjoy baking)Icame across these and thought I would give it a try.  Great cookie!  I added a little extra Lemon Extract and ALSO added lemon juice for the little extra something.  Also I noticed how sticky it was so to scoop out the dough I used a teaspoon that I dipped into powdered sugar every time I scooped and dropped the scoop of goo into the powdered sugar bowl.. worked out just fine.  Also.. take the cookies off the pan/stone or whatever you are using (I use pampered chef stones) as soon as you can 3 or 4 minutes.. if you leave it on to long (i was on the phone while they cooled) you almost have to get the chizle out of the tool box to get them off.  But great cookie.. I am next making Devils food cake mix with devils food pudding mix and making these cookies , and adding almond extract and rolling in powdered sugar for the effect!  Thanks so mch!

Super easy, they were in the oven in about five minutes. I used a few squirts of lemon juice instead of extract. Turned out great, couldn't be happier.

These were awesome! I wasn't sure how they would taste since some reviews said they have a fake lemon taste. I thought they were great. They taste like lemon coolers! I added some lemon frosting to some and I think it made them too sweet. Follow the recipe and don't add frosting. Definately will make again

This was so easy to make! I didnt have any lemon extract so followed other reviewers and used 1 tbsp lemon and the zest of 1 lemon. This was by far the quickest cookie Ive ever made. Mine werent done in 9 min. I think I left in for 12. Reminds me of the lemon coolers I used to eat as a kid. YUM!

My daughter entered these into our County's newest 4-H project "Bake with a Mix" We loved the suggestion to add Lemon koolaide mix instead of lemon extract. It seemed very different and special. We also added 2 teaspoons of poppy seeds to the recipie. My daughter won GRAND CHAMPION over all levels in the project. It wowed the judges even the ones that didn't like lemon! 

This recipie was simple and easy. The winning batch was made complety by her with no assistance by me except putting them in and out of the oven. Great recipie!

Wow. These melt in your mouth. I made them for work and they were gone in a heartbeat. Dough is pretty sticky so after I dropped a couple balls into the powdered sugar I would shake the bowl to get them coated and they wouldn't stick to my fingers when I dropped them onto the cookie sheet.

I also used about a tablespoon of real lemon juice and a bit of lemon zest in place of the lemon extract.

Excellent cookie!  I also exchanged the lemon extract for zest of one lemon (grated with microplane) and fresh lemon juice (I juiced 3/4 of a large lemon). This made the batter stickier, so I refrigerated them for 30 minutes, and used a small scoop to scoop them.  I didn't use the powdered sugar, but was going to ice them.  After tasting, they didn't need the icing!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a candle party and had to give several people the recipe.  No one believed me when I told them how easy they were!  I took the advice of others and used lemon juice and zest.  I also rolled the dough into balls then rolled them around in the powdered sugar, the cookies came out perfectly round and looked like I had bought them from a bakery.  I will be making these many more times, as well as experimenting with different cake mix flavors.  I think I am going to try german chocolate with a little coconut pecan frosting next time (my dad's favorite!)

This was a very simple recipe that made very good cookies.  My son thought that there purchased from a bakery.  The only change I made was to use lemon juice and lemon zest instead of the lemon extract.

I followed others' suggestions and added fresh lemon juice instead of extract.  Instead of rolling in sugar, I added a glaze to the top.  Delicious and easy -  my kind of recipe.

This was a real treat!  I didn't have lemon extract, so I did what someone had suggested and used one tbsp real lemon juice and a little lemon zest.  I used a cookie scooper and had no problem with sticky dough.  I also baked them on parchment paper for a little longer than the recipe indicated.  The cookies did not look like the photo that was submitted, so I dusted them with a little more powdered sugar afeter they cooled.

These cookies were very easy to make and very delicious.  I used a package of lemonade kool-aid instead of the extract and it worked great.  I do suggest to just mix ingredients with your hands instead of a spoon, it's much easier.  And I found it very easy to roll the dough and add the powdered sugar without refrigeration, it worked like a charm.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I used a package of lemon flavored koolaide and this was the key to the great lemon flavor! I did feel that they need to be flattened out a little after rolled into balls. I baked them for 8 minutes on 375* and they turned out perfect! I will use this recipe again and again...

Oh yeah - these are definitely easy and super good! As mentioned in other reviews, take these out before you think you should. If they actually appear brown on the edges, you've already cooked them too long. They're still edible, but not near as chewy and good. Thanks for a great recipe!

UPDATE 11/26/09: Just wanted to thank you again, this is now my 3rd year of baking these great cookies.  They are almost too good -- something about the chewy texture makes me keep going back for more, so the 2 dozen the recipe yields don't last very long.  ORIGINAL REVIEW 12/7/07: Deelish!  Thanks so much for posting this great, incredibly fast & easy recipe.  I tweaked it just a bit based on some others' suggestions.  I didn't modify the ingredients at all (perfect, in my opinion), but I did refrigerate the dough for about 15 minutes, then rolled teaspoons of dough into balls before tossing in the powdered sugar.  I also cooked at 365 degrees for 10-11 minutes.  They turned out great - slightly crisp on the outside & chewy on the inside.

This definately is the best cakemix cookie recipe.  It doesn't taste like a cake mix at all, like white cake mix can sometiems.  Mine actually took 10 minutes to bake, and were still nice and chewy.  I also enjoy this recipe using 
1 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice instead of extract for just a slightly different flavor.  I can't see how anyone wouldn't like these unless you didn't like lemon.

Also! Great recipe for young kids to help with because it's so quick.  My daughter didn't lose interest right until they came out of the oven!

Tasted like cake mix, despite adding more lemon juice and zest. I'll keep looking for a lemon cookie receipe.

These are okay, but I won't make them again. I threw out most of the batch, nobody would eat them. If you underbake them at all, they are unpleasantly gummy in the middle instead of cakelike. I think there is more than a hint of "artificial" taste to them from the cake mix that just isn't right for a home made cookie. They could use some tartness to accent the lemon flavor and offset the sweetness, maybe some lemon juice and zest would help.

I made this recipe for our church potluck and they are all gone! I loved them! I think next time I may add double the lemon extract for a bit more lemonny flavor, or maybe some lemon zest.

*Gasp* Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly. The dough was a little sticky and tough to roll in the sugar, but it didn't cause too much trouble and was definitely worth it. Nice light spring/summer cookie. Thank you so much for sharing such an awesome recipe! =D I baked for 8 minutes. My oven was a little funky, so some were burned. :( But it was still delicious! XD Loved it. I might bake a little less next time... six minutes maybe. Don't flatten it out too much, because it spreads out a lot. I'll definitely make this again.

Easy cookie to make and gorgeous to look at! I think I'll add some more lemon flavor to the next batch. Either some fresh lemon juice or more lemon extract. It wasn't as lemony as I expected. All in all, pretty good.

Very good recipe.  Maybe it was overkill, but I topped the cookies with a bit of confectioner's sugar icing with lemon extract.

Excellent recipe... I'm going to try different flavors of cake mix coupled with different flavors of extract for more variety!

This is DELICIOUS! I made these this evening to ship to a friend, and, I have to say, these might not make it!  My friend LOVES lemon flavoured things, so, to kick it up a bit, I added very fine zest from 2 lemons. Also, after they were baked, I sifted more powdered sugar on top. Again, these are wonderful! Thank you so much for clue-ing me in to how these delicious cookies are made!

This recipe is awesome! I made them for a cookie exchange this Christmas.  They are SIMPLE to make. I used lemon juice instead of lemon extract.  I made about 25 cookies per box of mix.  My boys didn't like them...but, lemon is more of a grown-up taste I think.  I will be makiing these many more times in the future!

Evryone in my office loves those lemon flavored Girl Scout Cookies. I think these will be the new favorite! I used                           lemon juice instead of extract and I also added 2 Tsp of water since the mixture looked really dry. It turned out great! They were very moist and chewy.

Not impressed. I definitely picked up on the fruit loops taste that another reviewer mentioned.  I didn't really like the consistency either. The were more cakey rather than chewy.

I made these for a teacher appreciation luncheon & they went over great!  A nice fresh springy flavor, and the cookie is very attractive with its crinkled sugar top!  I followed others advice: reduced oven temp to 350 and baked 11 minutes, doubled lemon extract, and sprinkled powdered sugar over the cookies rather than rolling in the sugar.  I also used parchment paper.  Will definitely make again!!

I followed the directions exactly and they came out wonderful! I used the Pillsbury supermoist lemon cake mix. The only thing that was a pain was rolling it in the powdered sugar - the dough is very sticky and the step got kind of messy for me. But they are nice and light and lemony! A keeper for sure!

I'm not a lemon anything lover but these cookies... oh my gosh. They are absolutely divine!! So tart yet sweet. Amazingly good and easy to do. I didnt have the lemon extract so i substituted it with lemonade mix. I think thats where most of the kick came from.

This recipe is fabulous!  It's very easy to make.  The cookies are so yummy.  I added an extra tsp of lemon extract and frosted the cookies with lemon frosting!  Makes them so yummy!  I also cooked them at 350 for 11 minutes.

I thought this recipe was disappointing, it tasted like lemon cake mix, nothing special. My friend made the recipe that uses the lemon cake mix and cool whip and those cookies had a better texture and more exotic flavor.

I added some lemon juice and lemon zest instead of the flavoring.  The only problem was that the dough was sticky when trying to spoon into the powdered sugar.  But in the end the cookies turned out great and tasted great.

Easy to make, but quite bland. Next time, I'll triple the lemon extract. As I was bringing these to a gathering, I made a lemon glaze to liven them up.

These turned out great. I used a whole lemon (juice and zest) and substituted granulated sugar for powdered sugar. I also chilled the dough for 30 minutes before rolling the cookies in the sugar and baking them. They cooked perfectly in 9 minutes - brown and crispy on the bottom, gooey inside. Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out great. Everyone loved them and they are so easy to make. I do refrigerate my cookie doughs overnight. Makes them easier to roll into balls and I think they are softer. I’ve already made these twice.  Fast becoming a favorite here :)

BEST COOKIE EVER!    I made these for Christmas and they were a huge hit. The only thing I did differently was...I used the juice from 2 lemons, plus the zest from both. You could REALLY taste the lemon  I let them cool completely them pat the powered sugar on and it stayed with the cookie better. I will be making these a lot.

I didn't have lemon extract so I did what others did, used a tbsp of lemon juice and the zest of one lemon. Im not the greatest of bakers and think I had some old confectioners sugar, but these cookies may not have looked as good as the pictures you have, but they tased great! Will do them again, now that I'm a baking pro!!

Recipe turned out great! Used the juice and zest of one lemon in place of the lemon extract. Also refrigerated the dough for about an hour just to make it easier to handle. Will definitely make again.

I didn't make any changes and they are amazing! I have also tried other cake mixes and used different extracts. The possibilities with this standard recipe are endless!

I made this last year for Easter and was disappointed they were not as tart as hoped. This year I followed BKCook’s advice and added fresh zest and juice from 1/2 lemon. They’re perfect!

I bought 2 mixes and weighed and discarded 2 oz. of mix.  I increased the serving size to 54 and followed the recipe as increased.  I also added Ghirardelli white chocolate chips and dusted the cookies with powdered sugar after baking.  This was a quick, pretty and yummy addition to our Christmas cookie trays!

YUMM!!
I didn't have any lemon extract so I substituted with the zest of a whole lemon and juice from half of the lemon. Next time I make them I'll add 1 to 2 minutes of baking time per batch. 9 mins was just done. Other than that.... YUM YUM YUM!

Made it as is and they do not have the consistency of a cookie at all. They were fluffy like cake. Delicious but I prefer my cookies chewy.

If you're not all that fond of baking, and not really a fond of lemon in particular, I would highly suggest making these cookies with this recipe. A co-worker introduced me to this recipe a few years back and it has since become a family tradition.

Made 5-Star by using butter instead of oil!! Everyone loves these, melt in your mouth, cookies! This recipe got me started on my love affair with cake mix cookies, pick your favorite flavor, a dollar box of cake cake mix, butter, eggs, oven 350-375, depending on how brown you want the bottoms.  So Easy So Good!!!

I used the basic recipe except I substituted orange cake mix and orange extract. I made it for fellowship, at church, and there was none left! Perfect size and delish. Really looked nice on the plate.

I'm still laughing at how easy but delicious these lemon cookies are to make.  I've been bringing cookies into the office once a week for a few months.  I change the recipe and ask for feedback.  Each week, the comments are positive and the cookies disappear, but invariably, everyone asks me to make those "fluffy lemon cookies" again.

They are really good. The recipe says to use a  18.5 oz cake mix. Cake mixes come in 15.5 oz boxes so you will need 2. I added lemon zest and lemon emulsion to mine. Everyone at church loves them.

I have this recipe 4 stars because I didn’t follow it exactly.  Based on other reviewers comments I used freshly squeezed lemon juice and the zest of 1 lemon in place of the lemon extract.  These were delicious (and don’t taste like foot loops like some have mentioned). I’m adding this recipe to my favorites.

Cookies were delicious!  I did add some True Lemon to the cookie mix and in with the powdered sugar.  Also, I follow the advice of some to refrigerate the dough before rolling into balls, very helpful & should do - makes it much easier.

These were so easy and delicious!  I added two packets of True Lemon which added tartness and lemon flavor that's not as fake tasting.  I left out the lemon extract. I used a small cookie scoop and made balls that were a little less than 1 inch.  This yielded about 3 1/2 dozen.

So the first batch I burned on the bottom. So I turned down the temp to 350. The second batch were not burned but also not good. I won’t make again. My suggestion is If you want cookies then make cookies.  I wasted ingredients and made my kitchen a mess for no reason.

I followed some suggestions to use lemon juice instead of lemon extract for better flavor. Oops, epic fail for me. I would have taken pictures, but I had yellow goo stuck all over my hands! I added some flour ( a couple of tablespoons?) and got them to hold together. But what a mess! Should have followed the recipe!

The only thing I changed was I added a tablespoon of lemon juice, cause I like it really lemony. Next time I may go 1 1/2 tbls. These were really easy and really, really good.

was surprised when recipe said to use 1 tsp of dough per cookie but that worked well - puff up lots in cooking.  Expected more lemon flavour but they are okay

Made these for Christmas and they were so easy and were the most highly rated dessert out of the 10 I made. Surprisingly amazing. I used to change with the lemon zest and lemon juice in place of the extract. I suggest letting the dough sit in the fridge for an hour and let them sit on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes after you take them out. They become flatter and crunchy yet soft.

I used extra fresh squeezed lemon juice to a avoid the "fruit loops" flavor some reviews talk about, but unfortunately these still tasted like fruit loops and didn't have as much of a lemon punch as I would have liked. I think they tasted better day 2, and they weren't bad, just not what I was hoping for. I also ran into a little bit of an issue with the size of the cake mix. Cake mixes come in smaller sizes now, compared to when this recipe was written, so I needed Google and a bit of math, but I got there in the end.

I set the oven at 375 degrees and baked for 7 minutes like the recipe asked. But when I checked them at 7 minutes, they didn’t look done, so I left them in for 10 minutes. Big mistake. They were super hard the next day. Bake them for 7 minutes like the recipe says and put them in an airtight container as soon as they’re done cooling so they don’t get hard.

These are really good, very fast cookies.  Only a couple comments.  If you use a lower-quality cake mix, you will probably not be happy with the lemon flavor.  Also, many cake mixes are less than 18 oz.  I had a Betty Crocker with 15 oz and with the two eggs and 1/3 cup oil, it was too liquid.  I added about 1/3 c. flour until it was a good consistency.  I also added some orange favor as well, just to deepen the flavor.  Love them and I will use this frequently.

I did not make any changes to this recipe. I am disappointed in the lack of powdered sugar appearance at the end result, but the flavor is strong and unavoidably lemon. An easy recipe to make cookies in a hurry.

I just made these and used the juice of a medium sized lemon and a bit of zest, about 3 Tbsp total.  My batter was way to creamy to form into balls, possibly  due to smaller box mix. Would try adding flour next time,  like another reviewer did. I used a heaping teaspoon for each cookie on parchment paper, baked 11 minutes in a 350 oven. These cookies aren't like a fresh from scratch but they're not bad. They did have a nice lemon taste but was more of a cakey cookie to me. I sifted confectioners sugar on top after they cooled a bit. This was the first time in my life I'd ever made cookies from a cake mix. I'll probably stick to scratch baking but in a pinch, these aren't bad.

I added 3 tbls of flour, 2 tsp of lemon extract and used a little less oil as others had suggested. The batter was crumbly and easily shaped into balls and roll in powdered sugar. I baked them at 350 for 13 min. The cookies did NOT spread, held their rounded shape but were very good.

Yummy, but dough was a little wet. Next time I will add a little less oil.

I added a little bit of yellow cake mix with the lemon since the box size didn't match the recipe.  They turned out really great.  Everyone loves them.

Easy to make and very delicious.  Everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again.  I used one and a half tablespoons of lemon juice in stead of extract ....  taste just like a lemon drop.   Plus they looked just like the picture with the recipe....

I used orange cake and added some fresh strawberries I puréed and skipped vanilla flavoring. I used a little less oil and added a little flour and chilled the mix for awhile. The ones in the back I did at 300* and they are soft and tasty but then I went to 325* and got the puffy effect which is more what I was wanting. So will redo the powder sugar ones so they match the coconut topped ones. They taste really great and I’ll definitely experiment more.

I’ve made this several times, always reliable and popular.  The most recent time I made them (see photo) I added 3 Tbs. of flour to make up for the box cake mix now being only 15.25 oz. (why do they do that?)  Also tried juice and zest of one lemon instead of the lemon extract and it was terrific.

Tasty cookies!  I made exactly as written but used a #40 scoop to dish them out.  Made exactly 24 cookies.  I baked them for 9 minutes.  They were soft and chewy on the inside.  I think next time I will go up to 10-11 minutes to make a crispier bottom.  Highly recommend!

For those of you worried about the powdered sugar, you  needn't be. The cookies are only baking up to 9 minutes. I also did not have lemon extract. I used some Lemonade powder and lemon juice. I also mixed all ingredients except for the cake mix and gradually added the mix to make stirring easy. When I had batter, I dusted it with the confectioners sugar and folded it in to make it not too sticky. It worked fantastically! I scooped out large over teaspoon fully and dusted them as directed and baked. They came out perfect.

These are awesome if you like lemon.  A good balance of sweet and tart.  I used a TBS of lemon juice and the zest of half a lemon.  I also refrigerated the dough which is difficult to handle right after it is mixed.  Use powered sugar to coat your hands and it makes it a bit easier to scoop and roll. Enjoy.

This is a family favourite in our house ever since the first time I made them.  Always requested for Christmas time, and in the summer I make them extra big for ice cream cookie sandwiches but minus the icing sugar to coat.

They turned out to look nice and tasted okay, however, the batter was very wet with 2 eggs and the oil, almost cake batter. I had to add 1/4 cup flour and put the batter (not dough) in the fridge for an hour in order to form the balls as it was so sticky. I don't think I would bother with this recipe again.

Delicious! I substituted 2 tablespoons lemon curd and us the juice from 1/4 wedge of a lemon instead the juice and zest in the recipe, I do believe either way would be excellent, the guests loved them.

I used real butter instead of veg oil and I used real lemon (1TB) instead of extract.  I also tossed the cookies in the powdered sugar after they were done baking and slightly cooled. They turned out great!

I made these for a Cinco De Mayo party, and they were almost all gone and I had many compliments!   I will make these again.  I doubled the recipe, added 2 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. of lemon juice and 1 tsp. of lemon zest in place of the lemon extract as suggested. I also used slightly less oil since the cake mixes were only 15 oz..  The dough was extremely sticky and I had to adjust the baking time.  I will make them again, but chill the dough overnight and sprinkle powdered sugar on them instead of rolling them in it to prevent the bottoms from getting too brown.

Great cookies!
changed to 2 tbls of fresh lemon juice.
Also gradually added some flour at the end to get a semi stiff batter.
My cake box was 15.25 oz
Putting the bowl in the frig for a hour  made everything easier!

I made these for the first time this past Christmas. My family can't get enough of them. Every week they ask me to bake these. These are now a family favorite in my house. My daughter is baking more tonight and she is going to add lemon frosting on top to see how that is.

I have made these cookies several times and someone always asks for the recipe. I do change this recipe slightly.  I do not use lemon extract but instead, as other reviewers recommend, use lemon juice and rind. I do refrigerate the dough prior to cooking and I find that necessary to be able to handle the dough more easily.

I reviewed all of the ratings on these cookies and made the following changes:
Added zest of two lemons.  Upped the lemon extract to 1.5 tsp. (Make sure you use natural not artificial)
Added 1.5 tsp of fresh squeezed lemon juice.
Refrigerated overnight before rolling, and baked on 350 for 11-12 minutes and they were AMAZING!

This was a fun and easy recipe! I made 2 batches of these.  The 1st batch I followed the recipe to a T.  The cookies tasted great but came out looking like biscuits.  On the 2nd batch I used 1/2 cup oil instead of the recommended measurement so the cookies were flatter.  I also zested a lemon and mixed in with the dough.  They were awesome!

It is a good, easy cookie. Great for kids just learning to cook. Also good if you need to make many cookies very quickly.

These cookies are some of the most popular at my charity bake sales.  You will notice that it called for an 18+ oz. cake mix and neither Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines had that much in the boxes now.  In fact, they have reduced almost all cake mixes to 15.75.  I add two tablespoons of flour to the mix to adjust for that.  I also do not use the 10X sugar; instead I put a small amount of 10X glaze on top that is flavored with lemon.

Just all-right. Missed the homemade taste. I Refrigerated dough and put a baggie on my hand that was prying the dough from the mellon baller. Worked great. Good in a pinch and i would make again...I used 2 T lemon juice fresh squeezed per box.

Made using lemon extract and lemon rind instead of extract.  Drizzled a little mix of icing sugar and lemon juice and they were super yummy.   Made again using Key Lime Cake mix and lime juice and they were not very good.   Will make the lemon once again.

I bake hundreds of Christmas cookies every year and I always try one cookie I've never made before.  I usually want it to be very simple because my other cookies are very time consuming.  My husband loves lemon so I thought I'd try this one.  I doubled the batch and was still done in about 75 minutes.  I also rolled about a third of the batter in walnuts as well as the powdered sugar.  They were so good!  Both ways were great!

I had my doubts, completely unfounded LOL. The only thing I did different was I used actual lemon juice, as well as I added lemon zest for that extra zing.  Delicious :)

I make these using a Duncan Hines Lemon Cake Mix and they don’t require any lemon extract, juice, or rind. They’re delightfully lemony without. Every place I take them they get eaten quickly and I’m asked for the recipe.

Popular, easy and so delicious. I use lemon juice instead of lemon extract and add a little lemon zest. My crew loves lemon so the change kicks it up a notch.

I actually like the subtle flavor of the lemon.  

It was difficult finding the right box of lemon cake mix though.  I was lucky at my third store.  

I stayed with the 9 mnutes baking.

I ran into a problem with these cookies, which was my fault as I didn't watch the proportions closely enough.  The cake mix size in the recipe calls for a box of lemon cake mix that is 18.25 oz.  They are NOW putting out cake mixes that are 15.25 oz.  3 oz makes a pretty big difference in the outcome of the texture  of the cookie.  I either had to leave them in long enough to dry them out or take them out on time and had a hard time 'setting' them. Didn't notice the discrepancy until I watched the video, and then I knew exactly what the problem was that I was having. They weren't 'chewy' at all.  They were either dry or moist and falling apart.  Sorry, this recipe didn't work for me:(

First time making them. They were liked by the family. I will make them again. I see many possible variations. 
 Pros: 1. They are quick and easy. 2. Sightly crisp on the outside, but soft/chewy in the inside. 3. Added lemon zest. 4. Flavor was good. 
Cons: This is the reason for the 4 Stars: The dough was too soft and sticky. It was difficult to roll into a ball without the dough getting stuck onto my fingers/hands, slightly messy. 
Suggestion:  Put the dough in the fridge to stiffen.

First off I couldn't find a 18.25 oz cake mix. They were 16.5 oz. so I bought one. I added 2 1/2 TBLSP. lemon juice and 1 tsp. lemon zest. They still don't taste very lemony but didn't want to over do it. I did refrigerate the dough as someone suggested and it helped. Still some what sticky. I baked them for the full 9 minutes and they came out great. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. These are for a birthday gift so will have to check in later and let you know how he liked them.

The only thing I don't like about these is that the recipe doesn't make near enough to keep some and share with other family members too! 
   After reading a review that said they came out with a Fruit Loop type flavor, I adjusted the recipe by adding the juice of half a good sized lemon and the zest from that half as well instead of using the lemon flavoring. I also chilled the dough for 6 hours to help the balls roll more easily. 
   They came out with a wonderful crispness around the edge and very tender in the middle. They have a very bright lemony taste! I will definitely be making these again but will double the recipe next time!

These are one of my go to quick cookie recipes - with a few changes - they are always the first cookies to disappear.  I do zest both a lemon and a lime into the mix, then add the fresh lime & lemon juice and omit the lemon extract. I also refrigerate the dough for a least a few hours or overnight if possible before baking.  Easy, refreshing and something different!

I decided to triple the recipe to fill my husbands cookie jar and to take a batch to work. I exchanged the oil for a 50/50 mixture of butter/shortening which helped to retain a thick cookie shape. Everyone loved them and made them disappear quickly which drove me to make a second triple batch. Even the young man that mowed our lawn could not believe how good they were. My husband is impressed that they remained soft and has two every day with his coffee.

A good recipe but not the best. Points for how easy it was to make though! I didn't have extract to I used fresh lemon juice and it wored out just fine. The dough was too hard to manipulate so I refrierated it for several hours and it was very easy. I cooked the first batch at 8 minutes and it was very doughy inside still. I think that that issue is more to my oven and not the recipe though as the extra minute helped but they were still doughy. Might try 10 minutes next time. Definitely don't want to over cook these or any cake cookie as they don't ever seem done when they're done but I think these did need a bit more time, for me at least. Thanks for sharing!

Easy to make, look good, and disappeared quickly. Going to keep this recipe close by to make different flavors (orange, mint-chocolate, etc).

Used juice of one lemon and some zest instead of extract.  Box mix was 16.5 oz.  Soft cookie with a little crunch on the bottom.  Cooked about 6 minutes. Yum!

I love this easy-peasy recipe! I made a small indentation on each ball and added one blueberry into the indentation, before baking!
Yummy!

As suggested, I used real lemon juice  & zest and baked 10 minutes @ 350º. Despite chilling in the fridge for ~18 hours, the dough was still too sticky to roll around in sugar. I just plopped them onto parchment-lined sheets & sprinkled the sugar over them.  For a few of them, I tried mixing in some fresh chopped rosemary, which helped tone down the sweetness. I might also try it with mint.  These cookies are just the way I like them--crisp on the outside & cakey on the inside--but they're still a bit overly sweet. Next time I'll use more lemon juice/zest. They're pretty good, just not OMG AMAZING.

This recipe was super easy and quick to make! 
I did, however, leave them in for an extra 10 minutes as I found the suggested 6-9 left them a little too doughy in the centre.
After that, they turned out great!
Next time I make these I would double the amount of lemon extract used.

These cookies are very simple and straight forward to make.  However the flavor and texture of the dough is like yellow play dough and I would guess it tastes about the same because it smells very similar.  The baked cookies are alright but are unremarkable overall. I would have rather used the cake mix as a cake.

I love the taste and texture of these! My mother used to make them when I was younger and unfortunately I had never got the recipe from her.... so imagine my shock when I ran across these and how easy they are to make. Definitely a recipe your child can help you with if they enjoy being a little helper in the kitchen. :)

I just finished a batch of these lemon cookies... They were quick and easy to make But be warned,  after 6 minutes the bottoms were burned and the centre wasn't cooked. I put them on the middle rack. I put them back in to finish baking on the top shelf. After cutting off the bottoms,  they did taste ok but a little too sweet for me.  I'm sure it was the powdered sugar that burnt so quickly.  They tasted like a flat muffin so next time I think I'll just make muffins out of the cake mix.

Yummy, quick, and inexpensive recipe! This recipe is super kid friendly. Omitted the lemon extract and used lemon juice instead as mentioned in other comments. My bake time increased to 13 minutes at 375*. Cookies are delicious!

These lemon cookies are FANTASTIC! So easy to make. I did follow only two other suggestions however. I added some lemon zest and placed the dough in the fridge for 5 minutes or so to handle the dough better before rolling in the powdered sugar to bake. That tip was right on. Thank You for the this recipe! My husband LOVES them!
Update: I have also made other cookies with this exact recipe using chocolate cake mix. They are also a hit!

These cookies are as simple as it gets, after helping mix for 6 year old, she took the reigns and finished the second and third batches by herself.  Fun for the kids to make.  They were very sweet and got me thinking I was eating little cakes, since it is pretty much just cake mix.  Four year old cleaned out the plate about as quickly as they were made.  They are OK and I'll let my kids make them again, but I'll look to a more traditional Peanut Butter or Oatmeal cookies next time.

Very easy and delicious!!! I actually used a 15.25oz cake mix. (Grabbed the wrong size) but still came out good. I upped the lemon extract to 2tsps and added lemon zest.

Followed the directions to a T and they did not come out very well. Cooked for OVER nine minutes and they were still doughy in the middle. Not chewy, doughy. The only way to make them come out edible was to flatten them down with my fingers before placing in the oven.  Even then I was not impressed.

These were the cookies I made for the Christmas cookie exchange and many loved them and asked for the recipe. I made some changes based on previous reviews.  I used lemon zest and lemon juice instead of extract.  Perfect!!

Our all-time favorite lemon cookie!  I almost didn't make it because I hate powdered sugar, and there were so many reviews that said they tasted like "fruit loops". I decided to try it with some reviewers options & my own thoughts, and it was an instant success. Instead of lemon extract, I used triple the amount of lemon juice. I didn't used any powdered sugar. I mixed it all together, then lightly sprayed a smaller bowl with vegetable spray, scraped it all into that bowl, covered with cling wrap, and left in the fridge overnight. The next morning it was not sticky. I used silpat (or parchment paper) on cookie sheets  & placed 1" balls about 2" apart. Baked them at 375 for 12 minutes until they were barely browned. After they cooled I made an icing with a cup of powdered sugar, 1/2 cup of lemon curd & enough lemon juice to stir into a nice glaze. I put into a zip top bag, cut off a tiny end & squeezed small patterns onto each cookie. They weren't able to stack until evening because the glaze was too soft, but everybody ate them too fast anyway. They got rave reviews! This will be a family favorite for years to come!

Made according to the recipe except I baked at 350 for 8 minutes since a few reviews stated the bottoms got too brown and these turned out absolutely perfect. Bottoms were a light golden brown and centers were chewy but done. Easy enough for my eight year old to bake alone next time.

These are great! The whole family loves them. The changes I made is I added a little lemon juice along with the extract for extra lemony flavor. Also, I made a simple glaze using lemon juice  and powdered sugar. Glazed the cookies after cooling a few minutes then sprinkled with powdered sugar (I did not roll the cookie in the sugar before baking). I would also recommend refrigerating the dough a few minutes before placing on cookie sheet. Turned out great. Will definitely make these again.

I loved it, the only reason I gave it a 4 was because I didn't have any Lemon exctact so I can't say it was a 5 since I don't know if it would have tasted the same.  I followed another persons idea and use 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice and some lemon zest since I had a lemon.  I did find like some people suggested it was easier to handle the next day after being in the fridge.

I only gave it 2 stars for its ease. These cookies have no taste and the texture is not good either. 375 is too hot for cookies and they end up burning on the bottom before they can cook in the middle. They need a lot of tweaking in order to be a quality cookie I'd consider making again.

These are absolutely wonderful with just a couple extra steps, I make them for catering events and they're always the first to be eaten.
I add the zest of a lemon and about 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice in place of the lemon extract, then refrigerate the dough until it's firm. This gives it a much prettier shape since they spread less.
Here's the most important part in turning these into the best lemon cookies ever: Mix 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar with the zest of 1 lemon and enough fresh lemon juice to achieve a runny but thick consistency, then drizzle on the cookies once they're cooled. The icing takes away any of the artificial taste from the cake mix and makes the cookies more like lemonade. SO SO SO GOOD!

I made these exactly as the recipe states, because it was so simple! I wanted something different to include in the holiday cookie mix, and this is perfect. Simple, fast, easy.

The only thing I would have changed is to add more lemon extract or perhaps some fresh lemon. This may have been mentioned in other reviews, but I didn't read that many. The cookie isn't overly sweet, but doesn't have a lemon "punch" or tartness. Otherwise, delicious and so wonderful to have such a simple recipe!

I recommend using an airbake coolie sheet. The cookies brown easily and stick to the regular cookie sheet. Delicious cookie! Watch carefully so as not to burn them.

EASY!!  If I had to give a con, it would be the crunch, well, because I like slightly soft cookies.  Perhaps, I did something wrong because, they were very moist out of the oven, but became more crunchy, but not hard, as they cooled.  And, I will add, that I rarely make cookies --> maybe once every 2-5 years, if I had to average it.  I'm thinking they may have cooked a tad too long.  But they still taste really good.   Going to take them to a cookie exchange tonight -- we'll see how it goes.

Loved the taste of them. making sure they were done was hard. Cooked first batch 6 minutes and was still raw so added it in 2 minute increments. Took me 11 minutes to cook. Second batch cooked for same time and was a little overcooked. Still good though.

Flavor is just ok.  I like the ease of the recipe but even after refridgerating for 24hrs(as another reviewer suggested) the dough is very sticky.  Overall I doubt I will make these again.

Amazing cookies!! Did not have lemon extract so I used vanilla extract. 375 for 8 minutes. Used scooper to put on tray and then flattened them by dipping in water with a glass bottom and then regular sugar.

Uncomplicated and quick. I did replace the lemon extract and used the juice/zest of 1 lemon. Refrigerate for at least 10 mins before scooping and rolling. Very slight lemon flavor so I might increase to 2 lemons next time.

These cookies are super yummy!!  I used the juice from 1 small fresh lemon in place of the lemon extract.  Chilled the dough overnight.  They were so easy to make and everyone loves them!!

Really easy to make and taste great.  I used 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice and the zest from 2 lemons. I also added 3/4 teaspoon of baking powder to the mix so they would have a little more fluff to them.

These definitely live up to the name in terms of being easy. For the lemon fans in my family, I don't think it's possible to make anything too lemony, so I add lemon zest and double the amount of extract to satisfy their lemon craving. The recipe's good as-is if you don't need a huge hit of lemon flavor, but if you do, I'd recommend adding more.

This has officially become my new favorite cookie! Not too sweet or rich, with just the right amount of lemon zest to make it light. It was incredibly fluffy and wonderful, not too dense either. The package of lemon cake mix I used was only 16.25 oz, instead of the 18 that the recipe calls for, but it still came out perfectly. The batter should come out kind of fluffy and light, very soft and pliable. The cookies also come out of the oven very soft originally, you can't wait for them to harden in the oven. Instead, when you take them out, let them sit and cool for about 15 min, and they will harden sufficiently. Loved loved loved them. Easiest cookies to make ever.

Great recipe, especially when you are pinched for time. I use both 1 tsp. lemon extract (King Arthur's is wonderful) , 1 tsp. of fresh lemon juice, and 1 tsp. lemon zest. Makes a great cookie, very quickly comes together.

5 stars for ease in preparation, total time and variability in the many combinations that can be made.  I used a yellow cake mix.  I kept the eggs and oil the same.  I added 1/3 cup flour,  2 Tblsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 Tblsp orange juice concentrate (directly from the can), 2 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp lime juice.  I did refrig the dough for 1 hour to make handling it easier.  I used a dinner spoon to get my sizes uniform.  I dropped the dough in the powdered sugar, and rolled it around as it naturally formed a ball.  I did use parchment paper.  I did use my fingers to press down to flatten slightly.  I baked at 375 oven for 10 minutes.  My cookies did puff up a bit and spread.

Sweet!  My husband likes a soft cookie instead of hard and crunchy, so I gave this a try and really liked them.  I added coconut to give them a little more texture and sweetness. I zested an entire large lemon and used most of the fresh juice from the lemon instead of lemon extract. I will definitely be making these again.

They were OK and probably won't make them again. I used the juice and zest of one lemon. Lemon taste was really good but did not really enjoy the cake like texture.

My family absolutely devoured these!  I made these cookies and followed the directions.  I did not make any changes to the original recipe.  These cookies have a wonderful lemon smell and taste.  I may try adding another teaspoon of lemon and lemon zest as suggested by another subscriber.   However, they are wonderful just following the recipe.  The are a big hit with the kids!!   They are also easy and fun to make!

The cookies were tasty and very easy to make but I think they'd taste ever better if I used real lemon juice because the lemon extract gave it a bit of a chemical aftertaste.  Will make this again!

my hubs fav dessert is lemon anything. he liked and so did the kids, it's a keeper!

I didn't have lemon extract, so just squeezed in some lemon juice until batter was cookie consistency; and 1/2 melted butter & oil.
i was alittle leary of the 375 degrees (kinda high), so baked at 350 instead. nice, light, airy with touch-of-lemon cookies.

The recipes tastes great. I refrigerated the mix over night, as another subscriber suggested, and it made easy work of things.  Also substituted lemon juice in place of the extract. I saw somewhere that this yielded approx. 16 cookies, I made 20 and thought they came out a bit too large, as I wanted something a bit smaller for what I was doing. But the recipe is extremely easy and tasty.

These were great.  My husband and son both love lemon flavored anythings.  They've given this recipe the seal of approval.   I've added 2 tbsp lemon juice and the rind.  Very good.  I was worried about the "fruit loop flavor" other reviews had mentioned, but thankfully, I did not notice it.

Easy recipe and they taste great! I didn't have lemon extract but I did have a lemon in the fridge so I juiced half a large lemon and added in about a tablespoon of Blue Agave Nectar (any sweetener would work) and substituted that in instead and it was nice and lemony.

very nice soft cake cookies. I did make the batter the night before and let it sit over night. Also, instead of lemon extract I used lemon juice and lemonade powder mix to balance the sweet and sour. The batter was very sticky, so if you're a hater of messes, I don't recommend these to you.

I love these cookies! My friends adore them and they thought they were store bought. Someone even said they were the best lemon cookies they have ever had. I gave some to a friend who doesn't like lemons and even she enjoyed them. Loooove them and I highly recommend for anyone who likes lemons.

I made these  along with several other types of cookies to give as Christmas gifts. People raved over these cookies and preferred them to the chocolate cookies and sugar cookies. One friend told her husband he could eat all the cookies except the lemon cookies.

I made these to send with my husband for his "guy's night".  I received a text while he as still there telling me they were a hit. I kept a few for myself and thought they were delicious. I did not use lemon extract, but rather lemon zest. I used the zest of one entire lemon. Which seemed about perfect. I also dusted them with some additional powder sugar after they were done while they were cooling on the rack. I will definitely make these again. Super easy and tasty!!

Made these for Christmas and I've been dreaming about them (no, really) for the past 4 days. These bumped their way up my sweets list to be my favorite. They're baked long enough for them to be chewy on the inside but stay sweet all around with no burns or unwanted chunks. I can eat these guilt free due to the lack of added sugar.

Love these! So easy to make, soft and delish. Followed the recipe exactly and they had just enough tang balanced with sweet. Made enough (almost 5 dozen)  to share some with my coworkers, even though my kids wanted to keep them all at home!

I squeezed one whole small lemon and grated half of it into the batter before putting it in the freezer to harden enough to work with. Let me tell you, I don't even like lemon and I ate 3! Omg. So good!

Made for the holidays to do something different besides the usual chocolate crinkle cookies.  Tasty and super easy to make.  Just found the dough to be a bit sticky.  Will try to refrigerate it first the next time so it might be easier to handle.  All in all, good lemon flavor!

I made these as the recipe calls.... except used real lemon juice...I did take BKcook's advice & refrigerated the dough but for only 4 hours & the dough was definitely easy to work with. I rolled the dough into smalls balls & only rolled 1/2 way through powdered sugar!!!! YUM they were perfect.

I used twice as much extract and the cookies were much better than expected. The batter seemed very sticky but after coating my hands with the powdered sugar, there was no problem. Super easy.

We loved these. I also used 1 T lemon juice plus zest instead of the extract because that's what I have. Mine didn't crackle when baked. I also made a glaze of 1 c confectioner's sugar, 2 T butter, and 1 T lemon juice.

So easy and so lemony with great chewy texture and moistness! My husband loved them. Minimal mess in preparing. I also made these using a strawberry cake mix and strawberry extract, which was awesome, and I plan to use a chocolate cake mix and vanilla extract at some point.

Easy Easy Easy and everyone loves them. If you want them gooey, cook them for the 6 minute mark until barley browned, if you want them a bit more chewy then cook one minute longer and they are a different texture  but still amazing. I actually have had people ask for the recipe and its so EASY.
TIP: Be sure to coat them in enough sugar, that keeps them from sticking to the pan!

I made one small change.  Having no powdered sugar on hand, I rolled some of the cookies in white sugar and some in course raw sugar.  Both were very good and I will be making these again.

Very nice tasting cookie and so easy.I  added twice the lemon extract.  It took a little over 10 minutes to bake and  it produced 37 cookies.  My granddaughter gobbled them up.

I make these cookies for my family and friends and they are always a hit with everyone. Especially the son-in-laws! I always use a Duncan Heinz cake mix because it is the only brand that works in my lemon CAKE recipe. But last time I made the cookies, I couldn't find Duncan Heinz so I used a different brand and the cookies still turned out great. The recipe also works with fresh squeezed lemon juice if you don't have lemon extract on hand. I agree with other reviews that the dough is much easier to handle if you refrigerate it for a while first.

I used all the ingredients, and they are delish! Every time I make them everybody chows them down because they are so delish. I would definitely make them again maybe for parties or celebrations because I bet many people would enjoy them.

Made it exactly as the recipe states the first time. Used a Duncan Hines ultimate lemon cake mix.  Ohh they are so good!  We wanted to make a second batch, but no more lemon cake mix  however I did have a box of Orange cake mix and a bottle of orange extract.... almost as fantastic as the lemon  cookies. I just love the lemon. Will definitely be making more!

I made these cookies for my family and they were a huge hit. The cake mix really gives it a moist and soft texture. Also, these are probably the best cookies I have ever had and the recipe was extremely easy. I recomend this to anyone in need of a great cookie????

Normally I'm strictly a from-scratch kinda guy but I've been making these for years. Two differences, however. Yes, like others, I add lemon zest but I also throw in a bag of dried blueberries. My boss still insists they are her favorite cookie.

Very easy to make with children or grandchildren!  I omitted the lemon extract and added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans.  Also I have made similar cookies with other cake mix flavors and add-ins.

My hubby is a lemon fanatic so I knew this would be a good recipe to try. He loved them - ate two just cooled cookies. The only change to recipe which was unintentional was my cake mix was 15.25 oz. since my dough was really sticky I popped it in the freezer for 15 mins. Dough firmed up fine. I did bake mine by scooped tablespoons - made 22 cookies that way. I love the cake texture!  Will definitely make again.

I baked them 13 minutes using a toothpick test.  The dough was easier to handle after it sat.  Yummy, cakey cookies with a nice crispy bottom.  Making again for sure!

As recommended, I used a tablespoon of lemon juice instead of the extract. These cookies are amazing! Soft and chewy and full of lemon POW! Will definitely make these again.

These are a go-to recipe for me, I prefer a little bit extra lemon juice and just a touch extra lemon extract. Although they are still excellent without the extract in a pinch. They are also great wit other cake flavours

This is a great idea! If you let them cool off in the fridge they taste even better. I replaced regular lemon cake mix with a gluten free one. I also used 2 tbls of lemon juice and a bit of lemon zest instead of the lemon extract because I had none!

Came out wonderfully! I added just a tsp more lemon extract, & baked them for exactly 8 minutes, any more & they would've burned on the bottom. Thanks for the recipe!

The first batch was as per the recipe, the second batch  had the zest of one whole lemon and double the lemon extract. Both batches were a big hit. I personally preferred the second batch.

So the first time i tried this recipe, i panicked and i ended up making lemon cake. But today i finally did it! I am very new to baking so for 10 minutes at 375, they came out how i wanted. Yum! I read comments about it tasting like Fruit Loops..i mean its lemon and it has a tang..but i love lemon and i ate too many! I will have to try different cake mixes...thank you!

I tried the recipe but the batter was too soft to manage.  I added more flour and put the batter in the fridge.  The cookies came out beautiful and everybody loved them.

I bought a box of Betty Crocker  lemon cake mix 15.25oz. I used 1 and 3/4 egg and a little less than 1/3 vegetable oil.  I also squeezed a half a lemon and about a tsp of zest.  They turned out great!  The lemon flavor is there and they are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside ( a little dense). But overall a good cookie.

The flavor of these cookies is fine, but not out of this world. If you are making a wide variety of cookies and wish to throw these in the mix, go ahead. As part of a cookie buffet, they are fine, but they should not be the star of their own show. The texture was good for a day or so right out of the oven, but they tend to harden after a couple of days. Maybe I left them in the oven too long. I am not a cookie virtuoso.

I am not a baker but these came out great!! I  taking these to a cookie exchange party! I used a 16 oz cake mix because that was the only size I saw in lemon flavor. I also let the dough sit in the fridge overnight. Everything else I kept the same. Yummy!!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I read all the helpful reviews and used a few recommendations and they turned out perfect. I chose to use lemon juice and lemon rind in place of lemon extract and I  chilled my dough for 2 hours and they rolled perfectly.  I rolled them in confection sugar and made a thumb print. I then filled them with lemon curd and baked for 10 mins. They were amazing!!

made these last year and they were a hit. Also used strawberry supreme, devil's food, and white mix with added vanilla. Family and friends have started asking if I will be making more this year. Thank you Lissa!

I added some lemon zest and sandwiches them with raspberry jam. They were a huge hit. Like mini linzer tarts.

Meh! It was edible and satisfied the sweet tooth moment. I didn't have lemon extract so I added about a tablespoon and half of lemonade mix, I also added 1 cup of white chocolate chips. I did not roll it in the powdered sugar at all as white chocolate chips suffices in adding the sweetness to cookies.

Good flavor, but beware that the recipe calls for 18.5 oz. box of cake mix and the boxes on the market are 15.??..Added lemon zest to batter, and baked for 16 minutes..without pressing the cookie round before baking they are pretty thick, try pressing the cookie a little prior to baking.

Yum super easy! I used fresh lemon juice and zest of 2 small lemons. My dough was not firm enough. Probably due to the lemon juice. Luckily I had another lemon cake mix. So just added a little more mix! Smells delish and it was quick!

just made this recipe and it is DELICIOUS!!!! Very easy and the out come was very satisfying.  I did set the oven for 350 and left the cookies in for 11 minutes I didn't use lemon extract just a little over two tbs of lemon juice and lemon zest ..they looked just like the picture on the recipe. I was afraid to try this with the few comments about it tasting like fruit loops but I'm glad I did!!

These were fantastic! I made them for my friends at game night and these disappeared so quickly - everyone loved them! I had chilled the dough overnight and baked them the next evening. After I took both pans out of the oven (I ended up with 24 cookies,) somehow, they continued to spread out and became flatter than I had anticipated. But they were still nice and soft and tasted great!

Could use a little more lemon flavor.  I added a little lemon zest but next time would increase the lemon flavoring and add even more lemon zest.  Otherwise, simple to make!

I've been making this recipe for years and the only thing I've changed is the flavors.  I did make the mistake of getting a cake mix that wasn't 18.25 ounces and it was more like a batter.  I added 2 tablespoons of flour and they came out perfect!  I was told they tasted like Snackwells!!

These would have been great with less lemon extract and real lemon juice added to make up the difference. I LOVE lemon - but the full tsp of lemon extract made my batch almost bitter. Texture was awesome though. Not sure how I could have messed it up with only 4 basic ingredients :(

This a family favorite. Also this is a very versatile recipe. I have made Almond Cookies. I substitute lemon for white cake mix, Lemon extract for Almond extract. I crush Almonds and roll the cookies in almonds instead of the powdered sugar.  These are very tasty.

My first lemon cookie attempt and these were good. I doubled the extract amount and it probably could've used a little more. That's really depends on the person. I made bigger cookies and only got about 15, so I guess the original recipe calls for really little cookies. They were soft, chewy, and slightly crispy on the bottom. I baked mine at 375 for 9-11 minute.

Easy, yes... great cookie, no. Just ok. I'd rather work a smidge bit harder and get a really good cookie.

I used lemon juice instead of lemon extract since it was what I had on hand, plus it added a delicious fresh lemon flavor! I really loved these. I baked half of them right away and froze the rest (already formed and rolled in powdered sugar). They baked up beautifully later plus they taste great straight from the freezer, my favorite way to eat them ;)

I made these using yellow cake mix and using anise extract instead of lemon. They were delicious!!

My mother & I absolutely love these cookies.  I made them almost exactly like the recipe except for these small items.  1.  Like other reviewers have said if you try and roll these in the confectioners sugar right away it is a sticky mess.  So with that being said here is what I have learned to do.  If you are in a hurry put the bowl with dough in freezer until it just begins to harden.  Use a small cookie dough scooper (like the ice cream ones) then roll in the confectioners sugar.  If you are not in a hurry put dough in the refrigerator overnight, again a lot easier to handle.  2.  I also put 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice in the dough as mother likes hers real lemony.  Personal preference.  Cooked mine about 3 minutes longer, could be my oven.  I also found it quite hard to find a 18.25 lemon cake mix in our local stores but was able to find them 10 miles away at Big Lots for $1.25.  Bought 2 & should have bought more.

My son requested a "lemon dessert" today.  When I found this recipe, I was unsure if it'd work because I had to modify the ingredients based on what I had in the house.  I used a regular YELLOW CAKE MIX and the ZEST & JUICE OF ONE LARGE LEMON (in place of a lemon cake mix and lemon extract).  I kept the other ingredients the same.  It actually turned out really lemony and delicious!  Thanks for the idea!

Well...used yellow cake mix instead of lemon. Added real lemon juice to compensate. I don't know, purhaps because I did that, made them turn out nasty.  So bad, I don't think I will try again even if I do follow the recipe next time around.

For Christmas gifts this year I baked a ton of cookies and candies.  This is the cookie I was asked the most for the recipe.  It was so super easy but stayed soft and had such a great flavor.  Huge hit, thank you

Yummy!!  We really like lemon so I doubled the lemon extract.  I also refrigerated mine for a few hours. Still a little sticky - overnight probably would have been perfect.  Great flavor!

I must say I started our skeptical. I didn't think anything this easy could be that good tasting, but I'm happy to admit I was wrong. I made them exactly as the recipe states and they cam out great. I may try a little extra lemon next time just for an added kick, but they were great just as is too. Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe! So quick and easy! I add lemon zest to mine and use vanilla scented sugar to coat them. I made these for a friend's birthday and now they are requested every time there is something going on! It's a family fave too! Thanks!

Loved this easy yet flavourful cookie.  For some reason they all didn't crinkle up but that didn't affect the taste.  The icing sugar seemed to melt into the cookie so I sifted more over them after taking them from the oven. Definitely a keeper!

These weren't as lemony as I would have liked AND I used two tablespoons of lemon juice instead of the lemon extract. Maybe some zest would have helped? The dough was really sticky, but keeping it in the freezer for just 15 minutes made a big difference in manageability (but add an extra two-ish minutes to the bake time or let warm to room temp after balling).

The texture was nice, as was the appearance. It was a very easy recipe (until it was time for scooping). 

I don't think I'll make these again.

I tripled the lemon extract and dusted the tops with powdered sugar after baking.  Pretty, and they have a great texture (a bit of crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside).  And a nice lemon flavor - even with triple the extract it wasn't overwhelming.  Great recipe.

Great easy cookie. Did not have lemon extract - used packet of lemon KoolAid. Also added some lemon zest and Tbsp. of lemon juice as others suggested. Baked on parchment - no sticking & easy clean.

You can substitute the vegetable oil for 2 cups of frozen whipped topping (Cool Whip). They will turn out sweet, chewy, and super lemony!

These were so amazing! I refrigerated the dough for just 30 min before working with them. Baked for 7.5 min turned out so good! I may have to have these at my wedding! Lol

Way too sweet for my liking. I agree with the person who said they tasted like Fruit Loops.  I tried this with 2 different cake mixes, lemon and strawberry.  The yellow cookies and pink cookies were pretty though!

Dough is very sticky and hard to drop teaspoonful onto confectioners sugar.  Perhaps I did something wrong.  They are good though, nest time I try this recipe again, I would add more lemon flavoring.

I tried this recipe today and came out pretty good. At first I made the cookies larger, about 1/4 cup dough for each cookie and I had problem with the baking becuase the dough did not spread that much after heating. For the next batch I made it half the size and it cooked really well. The cookies were chewy inside and crispy outside. I sent some to my daughter for her to enjoy. I am waiting for her comments.

I used a tsp or two of fresh lemon juice and the zest of one lemon instead of the lemon extract. They turned out more cake-like than expected but were very delicious.

Very nice cookie. I don't cook much but these were very easy to make and have good flavor. I took the advice of others and used lemon zest and lemon juice instead of extract. I also left off the powdered sugar and baked until slightly browned on top. These were perfectly textured cookies crispy outside soft and chewy inside. They had a very nice lemony taste that goes great with an afternoon cup of tea.

I rolled dough into small balls (like PB Blossom cookies) & lowered temp to 365. Also, I don't have lemon juice or extract (Hey, I love to bake but I'm too poor to keep my pantry stocked) so I used a couple drops of orange flavoring. Came out great!

Great texture and very fast/easy - whipped these up in about 10 minutes total when I found out company was on its way for coffee and dessert. However, I like the taste of lemon, not faux-lemon cake mix. Therefore, I found if you want a more "authentic"-tasting cookie (i.e. not so much like fruit loops, which one person below compared the taste to - very accurately in my opinion!), make it with white or vanilla cake mix, then add as much fresh or bottled lemon juice and lemon zest (if you have it) as needed to make it taste fresh and lemony enough for you. Add some flour if needed (one small handful at a time until you have a dough texture you can work with), to compensate for the extra liquid you've added in the form of lemon juice. For an extra boost of taste, I added about a tablespoon of culinary lavender - thus making these into very dainty and convincingly "homemade" lavender-lemon tea cookies, with a soft soft texture and a lovely coating of crackly icing sugar. Yum!

This is my first review and I was really excited to write it.  These cookies are perfect if you are short on time but big on taste. And they stay soft, unlike some cookies that sit for a few days. They usually don't last that long.  The only thing I added was a 1/4 cup of sugar for a slightly sweeter taste. These are a hit in my family!!

I love the lemon flavor, very easy to make. I used a small cookie scoop to make these cookies. It was much easier than using a spoon to scoop the dough and place in the pan with the powdered sugar.  As suggested by the video, I used a spoon to coat the cookie.

I made this for a cookie exchange, so I made the recipe several times.  A few observations: with 2 eggs the cookies were lighter and more lemony. with one egg they were more dense-cakey.  Don't use a stoneware cookie sheet (like pampered chef)- for some reason the cookies don't retain their puffiness! Definitely add white choco chips and only make them a teaspoon size (for time in oven to be accurate). Otherwise I loved them.  They do have the froot loop taste,  but I think that is due to the boxed cake mix.  Wasn't a huge problem for me unless I ate too many at a time :-)

I often bake cookies and take them to school for my students.  Well, they loved these cookies, and several of them asked for the recipe.  One young lady, Ashla, described them as a Skittles cookie!  Definitely a keeper.

The cookies are mediocre and they stuck to my cookie sheet.  I have an electric oven and regular cookie sheets (not teflon coated) I had a terrible time getting them off the pans.  Second batch I coated the pan with spray.  Still had a hard time.

It was very simple, glad I did read the other reviews . ...  I used two real lemons - both the juice and zest, the dough was sticky, and I can taste the 'fruit loops' reference :-)  However, if it wasn't mentioned, not sure I would have got it!  At any rate, I think making the cookie is worth it - very simple, tasty.  The cookie is moist inside and a bit crispy on the bottom.

Super simple and one of the most requested cookies when I offer to bake.  They're not my personal favorite but everyone raves about them.

Everyone loves these cookies and I get requests all the time to make these. They are delicious,sweet, lemony, and chewy. I have found that it is best to use an actual measuring teaspoon to make the cookies. It makes the perfect, consistent size. You can't go wrong with these cookies.

I have made these cookies serval times now because they are so easy and yummy! Every one that has tried them wanted the recipe. The only change that I've made is using lemon juice in place of lemon extract.

These were good and simple to make. I have never made "cake mix" cookies before but I love lemon anything... So, needless to say I took the comments about these cookies not having a real strong lemon flavour to it seriously. So I added Lemon chips to them and some unsweetened shredded coconut too. It added some nice flavour and texture.  Another idea about the lemon chips is they could be melted and drizzled over top for those who like the lemon flavour spread more evenly throughout the cookie. Just sharing it in case others want to try.

This is a delicious and super quick recipe.  I did use 2T of lemon extract to add just a little more lemon flavor. I most certainly will make these again!

My whole family raves about these cookies.  I add 3 tbsp flour to mine because I am at high altitude and I use canola oil, but other than that no changes.  I love how easy this recipe is and the cookies are divine.

I used fresh lemon zest instead of lemon extract. We like the delicate lemon flavor. Not too strong, but definitely lemony.

These cookies were really easy to make, but wasn't worth it either way.  Unlike some of the other low reviews my issue wasn't with the lack of lemon flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly using lemon extract and Duncan Hines Lemon Supreme cake mix and it was lemony enough.  However, the cookie was waaaay too sweet, which seems to be a common issue with a lot of the dessert recipes on this site.  Also, the cookie just tasted cheap.  I agree with the other reviewers that it tasted like fruit loops, but not in a good way.  I also cooked it for longer than the recipe called for, but it still had that half cooked dough texture in the middle, which I do not prefer.  Cookies ended up in the trash.  This is another recipe where I am baffled by all the high reviews.

Not very impressed. I was expecting a "cookie" but it seemed more like a tea cake. I added 1 tbsp of lemon extract, rind of 1 lemon and 1 tbsp lemon juice because reading the reviews the flavor was not strong enough. The flavor was great with the additions but the texture is not what I had expected. If you like a cake like cookie this is alright. I guess I should have expected it being made from a cake mix!

This is only a 3 star because my kids seem to really like them and they were super easy and fast (about 20 minutes) I personally found them to taste like salty fruit loops. Maybe it was the brand of cake mix (betty crocker) or just the fact that I don't really like salty in my cookies. Either way. Not really that tasty, but I may keep this around in case I need to whip up something for a play date.

As suggested by other reviewers, I used lemon juice because I didn't have any lemon extract.  This recipe was super, super easy and a great way to use up an aging box of lemon cake mix.

I LOVE lemon so these cookies are up my alley.  I substituted the lemon extract with 1 tsp of lemon zest and 3 Tbls. of lemon juice.  I also put the dough in the freezer for 10 minutes as others suggested and changed the temperature to 350 for 11 minutes.  Awesome - awesome cookies...!!! I will definately do these again and try the chocolate version.

Made these following the recipe and loved them. I then tried them with Devil's Food cake, 1/2 cup chopped trart cherries, 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 tsp almond extract and topped with a sifting of powered sugar.  These are the ones that my family craves!  This is a great base recipe that can be expanded with no trouble!!

These cookies are really good and very soft. But, if your are not a fan of lemon then you will not like these. They are so easy to make I also made orange ones as well.

These were good and very easy to make. They were soft and chewy on the inside and had a nice presentation from the outside. Very lemony. I'd like to try other flavors of this recipe.

Awesome as written! Make sure you keep them in a very airtight container..they get stale easily. I Tried it with a cherry chip cake mix and Almond extract as well. This recipe lends itself very nicely to experimentation..try it with all flavors of cake mix and extracts! Thanks for sharing!

I used yellow cake mix, that's all I had. Two tablespoons of lemon extract was added to the 1 teaspoon suggested, along with lemon zest.  The kids liked the taste and texture however, I couldn't get that cracked powdered look. Can't say what went wrong there.

this was super easy and tasted great.  I took the advice of some of the others and used lemon juice.  I added about 4 tsp but will add more next time I like the tartness.  These are now one of my husbands favorites and was asked for the recipe by a few people.

I added these to my cookie trays I made at Christmas and ended up giving out the recipe to several people. They were by far the favorite cookie this year. Very moist and the lemon flavor really stands out. I substituted 1 T fresh lemon juice and some lemon zest instead of the lemon extract as others suggested. It added the lemon flavor I was looking for. I also refrigerated the dough overnight and I think it helped in making the cookie balls the next days. They were a sinch to whip up and I will be keeping a lemon cake mix in my pantry from now on. Mine turned out just like the picture on this page.

What an easy bake! They came out so delicous. The dough was not hard to work with at all...chewy and moist on the insides. I used a teaspoon of lemon juice instead of extract! These cookies are being added to my favorites!

Fantastic! I used real lemon juice and zest (I didn't have extract) let the batter chill a while in the frig (the extra moisture makes them wet) then spoon drop into powdered sugar, my oven required 10 min for the perfect cookie! My oldest son and I are lemon cookie monsters, we are on our 5th batch everyone loves them..thank you!!

I didn't have lemon cake mix, only rainbow bit/vanilla, so I used that instead, with 1tbsp. of lemon juice and some lemon juice ( in place of lemon extract). I used a little less oil to make up for the extra juice. Overall, very yummy, chewy, and sweet, but with a strange aftertaste-- probably a result of the vanilla+lemon juice mix.

This is a great base recipe. I however do not like them rolled in confectioners sugar, instead i dip the tops in yellow sugar and make a icing using powdered sugar and lemon juice and drizzle in stripes across the cookie using a fork. It gives the cooke a bit more texture and zing to them...

Perfect.  I didn't have lemon cake mix but I had lemon poppy seed bread mix and I then used that and followed your recipie.  It was wonderful and I put some on each plate that I am giving to people who help us out during the year.  (You know those same people....they plow your driveway, deliver your oil/gas, bring wood for winter, and delivery hubby's oxygen).  It is festive and super, easy and fast to create.  Thank you so very much for sharing it with all of us.  It is a keeper in my home.  Merry Christmas.

Pretty good for such an easy cookie!  Make sure you dont undercook them- they were NOT good =)  I think I will also try with different cake mix flavors.  Chocolate would be yummy!!

Wow!  Really Really Great & Super Easy!  Make sure you watch them like a hawk at the 5 min mark - they go from not done to very done in the blink of an eye at about 6 or 7 min.  I have a Cookie Exchange to go to tonight and didn't have time to do the rolling & decorating that goes with most cookie recipes so this fit the bill perfectly!  Thanks!

My family absolutely LOVED these cookies!!!  They were gone so fast that i only got one myself!  I took some to some friends for Christmas presents and got requests for the recipe that same evening from my friends' mothers.  The recipe is so easy to follow too!  I do agree with another reviewer that said to put them in the fridge before rolling them into balls.  It works much easier.

These were a great pick for my cookie exchange I went to this year.  They were extremely fast and easy to make, looked fantastic, smelled delicious, and tasted great.  Per other reviews, I used real lemon ruice instead of extract (as I didn't have any extract in the house) and they were fantastic!

This was an interesting recipe.  I wanted to make it healthier (this is typical of most of my recipe revisions) so I used about 1/3 c. unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil (I read the substitution should be one to one) and 2 egg whites in place of the eggs.  I also omitted the confectioners' sugar.  They only baked for about 7 minutes and were much chewier than I expected, but the flavor was good and I would try the recipe again.

I made this recipe just to try something different and they were YUUMMMY. I did however have to use regular lemon juice not extract, but the recipe was simple to make, fast, and tasty.

Very good and easy.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought they were tasty.  Had to bake about 10-11 minutes.  Rolled in powdered sugar, but didn't get the same look as in the picture.

These cookies are ok for being a cake box cookie.  I followed the recipe exactly and I wasn't thirlled with the lemon flavor.  They do taste a little "fake" (which they are)  Probably won't make again unless requested.  Thanks for sharing.

After the great reviews was expecting a great cookie.  Not so great!  Certainly very easy to make, kids will probably love them but I thought they tasted like processed cookies definately not homemade.  There must be better lemon cookies out there!

These cookies were very easy and had a wonderful texture. My only compaint was the artificial flavor that undoubtedly came from the cake mix (as I used lemon juice as a substitution for the extract). But, seeing as the whole batch was enjoyed in only a couple days time, I will make these again.

Very Good.  Made exactly as recipe instructed, and they came out excellent.  We tried them at home before making a large serving for my daughter's school.  We had compliments all around. Peanut allergies in school can make it difficult to find a great cookie recipe... this one is pretty and perfect. Thanks!

my new favorite cookie.  I used a yellow cake mix instead of lemon flavored cake mix.   the lemon extract gives it just the right amount of tang without the fake fruit loops after taste.   I couldn't stop eating them.  I will make them for company - a few of these with a black cup of coffee - heaven!

These were a HUGE hit with my youngest daughter (19) who is still a very picky eater!  She doesn't care for many cookies or cakes but she said this recipe is a keeper!  I didn't have lemon extract but did have a "plastic lemon" in the fridge.  They turned out beautifully!

I'm proud to call these "my lemon cookies."  I'm known for them!  I always use 1Tbsp lemon juice instead of extract and people always tell me how much they love the lemony taste!  My very favorite cookie!

I didnt use lemon extract so I used about 2 tsp of lemon zest and 2 tbsp lemon juice.  I will definitely make these again.  Next time I will use the suggestion of another user to add one unsweetened pkg of lemon flavored kool-aid.  EXCELLENT!!!! UPDATE 8/19/09.....the last batch, recipe only made about 25 cookies, only lasted 1 day!  I made them again today and used the suggestion from Barb Maxwell to use 1 pkg of unsweetened lemonaid kool-aid.  In addition, I added about 1 1/2 tsp of lemon extract and MAN!!!  This gave it the kick I needed!  I used Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Lemon Supreme cake mix both times.  I used parchment paper and cooked them for around 10-11 mins.  These cookies are quick, simple and GOOD!!!!!!!

The cookies were yummy!! I added 1 tsp. lemon zest and and 1 Tbs with addition to the lemon extract. Lemon juice. I only wish there was a recipe from scratch without using a ready cake mix.

I followed the recipe exactly and got the expected result - except the taste! They really do taste just like fruitloops. Not lemon, more like yellow flavor. Not for me. Really nice soft texture and chew, good presentation, though.

So while I'm only giving these three stars due to my personal preference, I think there's a lot to be said for these cookies. They're simple, they're fast, and they're inexpensive. No, their flavor is not gourmet, and we didn't prefer them personally, but frankly, it's a cake mix cookie. You get out of it what you put into it. If you don't need a super gourmet tasting cookie, these are for you. Or maybe you do, but you find you prefer them. We didn't, personally, but the review and overall rating indicates that lots of people do. So there you have it. :)

My first time making cake mix cookies and these were SO good. We call them the Froot Loop cookies. 2 days later and people are asking me to make more.

Delightful! Light and refreshing. I didn't have any lemon extract, and so I used the zest of 2 lemons and 1 tsp. lemon juice. Yummmy! I will definately make these again!

I could not believe how easy and wonderful these cookies were!  They were gone in a day!  My husband and picky 5 year old both LOVED them!  They took only minutes to put together and I loved the fact that I didn't even have to use the electric mixer!  FANTASTIC!  Will make again and again!

If you love lemony sweets, MAKE THESE!!!! So simple and beyond delicious.  Very moist.  I am one of those people who loves to play around with recipes and change them, do not do that with this.  It is perfect as is!

Awesome I used the Yellow cake mix 3t of lemon extract sub. Coconut oil in place of veg oil.  Put in fridge and let sit for 1 hr rolled in multi color sugar and placed on cookie sheet. Speckled eggs fun to do with kids.

LOVE IT! The cake mix boxes are about an ounce smaller than the recipe called for so I added about 1/4 cup of flour and it came out with the perfect consistency. YUMMY results!

Yummy, I accidentally made these with water and have not yet tried them with the oil, but I have to say they were a hit made the wrong way.  They were very light, I made them for a bake sale and called them "Lemon Cake Cookies" not because they're made with cake mix but because they were likel little discs of cake.

I made these for a pot-luck dinner where the theme was lemon. They were my second dish and of course the easier dish I made. However, they were the hit of the night. Everyone loved these cookies!

Everyone (including those that don't care for lemon) loved these cookies!!!  I followed the recipe exactly & the cookies came out perfect.  The lemon taste was evident but not overpowering at all.  I did chill the dough for about an hour before I rolled it in the powdered sugar.  I also baked in my convection oven at 350 degrees.  I baked two cookie sheets at a time & rotated them after four minutes of baking.  Total baking time was eight minutes.

I give this a C+ cookie.  Quick and easy for kids since it taste like sugar cereal - Fruit Loops is right!  The 2nd time, I added about 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice and the zest of one lemon.  This helped cut the sweetness and added a real lemon flavor.  Still, it's a lot of effort to improve a cake mix cookie.  But when you're low on ingredients and want a light cookie, this is the recipe for you.  With improvements, it made a nice lemon tea cake. TIP- with the addition of the lemon juice, the batter is very soft, so refridgeration is definitely needed.  I baked it for 12-13 min. with the extra juice.

Quick, easy, and delicious!! I didn't have lemon extract, so I used the juice of one lemon and l T of lemon zest instead (as suggested by another reviewer). I baked them for about 7 minutes, do not overbake, bake until they are just light brown on bottom. Wonderful lemon flavor, I love the softness of the cookie. Great recipe for company.

I made these for the first time right before Christmas.  My kids went crazy for them!  Needless to say, I had to make another couple of batches to actually take for the holiday gatherings.  Great taste & so easy to make up!

Found them a little too lemony, but if you are a fan of lemon then try them.  They are incredibly easy to make and take almost no time at all.

This recipe was super easy! It would work well if you need a quick recipe and enjoy anything with lemon flavor.

I'm a chocaholic but these cookies made me a believer. Not overwhelmingly lemony, which is why I don't eat lemon bars that much. So easy and quick!

DELICIOUS! I baked mine for 9 minutes and they came out perfect. I would skip the confectioner's sugar next time as I don't think they need it. Soft, chewy and awesome! Will definitely be making again.

Very easy and pretty good.  Not as "lemoney" as I might have liked so next time I'd add lemon zest or more lemon extract.

These cookies were delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a tbs of lemon juice instead of extract.  The cookies were soft and chewy.  My daughters were able to help me roll the cookies into balls, and then roll them in the powdered sugar.  It was so easy and a lot of fun for them.  I can't wait to try this recipe with other cake mixes------I'm thinking strawberry, like some other reviewers have suggested.

Excellent moist cookies that taste like cake, but not too sweet. My family gobbled them up! Bonus;the recipe was soooo easy. I made these for my Christmas cookie exchange and got call backs from my neighbors with rave reviews! Will add this to my favorites!

These were really good.  They don't taste like they're made from a cake mix because of the lemon extract.

These are VERY VERY good for being from a cake mix. I added 2 tsp. of lemon extract. I made tablespoon-sized cookies, rolled them in balls, coated them with confectioners’ sugar and baked them for 10-11 minutes. 
They are sweet and lemony at the same time. I agree with the "Fruit Loop" taste others were talking about. I think it's because you use a cake mix. It has a sort of "chemical" taste to it.

I made these with yellow butter cake mix and 2t. almond extract.  When I took them out of the oven I pressed m&m's in them.  Delicious!  Crispy on outside and chewy in the center.  It is hard to stay out of them!

These are really good. The only thing I had to get past was the very sticky dough.  It was thick and super sticky like glue.  Anyways, I dealt with it & they were delicious.

I tripled this recipe last week for a cookie exchange and the hostess just told me yesterday that everyone was raving about these cookies!  Couldn't be easier and everyone loves them!!! Plus, an added bonus is that they are so inexpensive to make.

These were so simple and yummy too!  They even looked pretty!  I did use some suggestions mentioned in the reviews I read.  I used a yellow cake mix with lemon juice and a little lemon extract.  I was careful not to make them too sour and it worked!  I will definitely be making these again!

I used a packet of Kool-aid as someone suggested in a review instead of the  lemon extract or juice. Worked very good and very lemony! These were good but in my opinion, way too sweet with the powdered sugar on top. I'll definitely make these again but w/no powdered sugar!

Mmmmmm.  These were great!  FYI... Teaspoon scoops of dough results in 1.5-2" cookies after baking (which I thought was a tad small).  I really loved the slightly tart taste to these lemony treats!

These were soft and chewy.  Next time I might add a little lemon zest and fresh lemon juice to boost the lemon flavor.  I have to admit, I liked these a lot better than I thought I would!  :)

Followed the recipe exactly. Here's how good these are: I made them for my neighbors as a thank you for something, and they liked them SO much that at a later function, my neighbor's eyes lit up upon seeing the crummy store-bought lemon muffins I had brought, as the hope was that these muffins might be homemade and that they might taste like the Easy Lemon Cookies!!

So good! My co-workers loved. I made a 2nd version using red velvet cake mix & almond extract that was a huge hit too! My mom has requested I make a batch of cookies for this weekend because we have family coming into town. It's too easy and very good! I baked mines for about 10 minutes on a baking stone.

I have been making these for years and they are so good. I have also tried chocolate and strawberry but lemon is my favorite.

These were just okay for me... a nice change because they are not a real sweet cookie, and they are light in texture... but not something I'll make again.  I made them for a potluck and half of them remained, so that was the confirmation I needed.

Taste nice and lemony but are way too light and have no substance. Need to eat many in order to feel satisfied. Wouldn't make these again.

This is a favorite of my family's since the first time I made them.  They always seem to turn out to soft and flat for my liking, but they taste great.

I didn't want to buy extract so I used lemon zest and juice also and the cookies tasted really good.  Lots of compliments and they were fast and easy.  Baking on parchment paper made them look almost store bought.

Very, very soft cookies.  I followed other suggestions and used lemon juice instead of lemon extract.  Will make again for sure.

Very good and the lemon taste was excellent.  The first batch that I made I dropped teaspoonfuls of dough into a bowl of confectioners' sugar as the recipe stated but they did not look very nice when they were finished baking.  The second batch I rolled each tsp. into a ball and then rolled around in the sugar and that just worked better for me and they looked much nicer.  Family enjoyed a lot!

I cannot believe how simple these are and how delicious!  I served them at a party and people raved about them.  Very moist and chewy.  My little secret that they were SO easy.  ;-)

I loved these cookies, but they were a little tart for the rest of my family.  I pressed down the middle and added blackberry jam to make them like thumbprint cookies.  The jam sweetened them and my family loved it!

Easy and tasty cookie recipe.  I didn't have any lemon extract or real lemons for juice/zest so I just left it out.  Still tasted great!!  Maybe a good cake mix is the key?  Also, instead of rolling in powdered sugar I mixed a little powdered sugar and milk and drizzled the icing over the cookies onces cooled.  Looks like I slaved away on these!!  Everyone at the BBQ raved about them.

I only had a yellow cake mix, so I added 3 Tbs of lemonade mix to the dough. My cookies actually took around 12 min to bake.
These are so amazing!

This recipe is so simple.  I did not have lemon extract, and followed the advise of another to use 1 Tblsp. lemon juice.  I also used parchment paper to line the baking pan.  Worked very well for me. While they were cooling, I had some chocolate kisses left over, I melted them, and with the back of a spoon gave them each a chocolate smear.  They were very good with and without the chocolate.  Thanx for the recipe.

Super yummy, easy recipe!!! I added lemon juice instead of extract & doubled the amount of it also. I would next time add some lemon zest as well.

The title says it all-EASY!  This recipe produces tasty, soft cookies.  Like another reviewer said, you could make this recipes with ANY cake mix for all kinds of variety.  BEST REVIEWER RECOMMENDATION:  Refrigerate the dough before scooping into balls.  I used a cookie dough scoop for uniform size.

Word of advice..I made this recipe with a mixer/stand. (wasnt top of the line but not the cheap brand either) It stripped the gears out of my mixer. Its a thick dough! Just as a caution to others. Still YUMMY!!!! but in the future I know better.

I've made these a few times and get rave reviews ("you made these??"). Much easier to refrigerate before making the balls. So far only used the lemon mix, but plan on experimenting with other flavors and combos.

I LOVE THESE! They have a wonderful lemon flavor. The cookies remind me of a very well known coffee house (rhymes with sharschmucks) Lemon Pound Cake. I have 2 problems with the cookies, 1) I cant stop eating them 2)they have a bit of an acidic after taste (but they are lemon so thats to be expected). Very quick and very easy, recommend this cookie to any lemon lover. Thanks for the great recipe!!

These cookies are really easy to make. I didn't have any lemon extract so the first time I used lemon juice and now I don't even use anything. All I put in with the cake mix is eggs and vegetable oil and they still turn out great. This recipe also works for other cake flavors too. I've tried chocolate, strawberry, and confetti. Confetti wasn't all that great, it obviously didn't have any flavor, but the other two were great.

Mine looked just like the picture! I think I made them a bit too large, but they were still wonderful. I understand where some people got that they tasted a bit like Fruit Loops, but I think that's because we're using lemon cake batter! I didn't have lemon extract, so I used 2T of fresh lemon juice and 1/2t of lemon zest. I wish I used more to make them more tart! My husband doesn't like sweets, but he really liked these cookies! He even let out an "Mmmmm!" when he had his first bite! I loved the texture, they were very similar to ricotta cheese cookies, cake like and fluffy! I loved these!

These were ok.  I had leftovers after a party so I'm assuming they were not a favorite.  The bottoms stuck a little so they were not as clean looking as a regular cookie bottom but overall they looked pretty.  I probably won't be making these again. Thanks though.

These are really good for the short amount of time they take and how easy they are to prepare!  Relatively low calorie also, even without any substitutions.  Just the perfect hint of lemon I was looking for, thanks for this recipe!!

I happened to have everything on hand one snowy day before Christmas so I added these to the boxes of cookies I was sending out. They were everyone's favorites.  I've made them several times since. They always turn out great.
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I used the recipe to make chocolate cake mix/chocolate chip/craisin cookies (baked as a large cookie in a glass pie pan!)and also baked white cake mix/crunchy peanut butter/chocolate chip cookies. I think I used 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of the 'other' addition (craisins and peanut butter). It was so easy! ALL of the cookies were gobbled up with rave reviews. I agree with everyone to watch the baking times!

These cookies turned out amazing!!! Ahh finally an easy recipe that actually tastes good! I used lemon zest and the juice of 1/2 a lemon instead of extract for a more authentic taste...I didn't want anyone to know I used a package. Perfect!-I also used the same ratio to make other cookies and they have all been great

I used Whole Foods brand organic Lemon Cake mix-- I wouldn't suggest it for this recipe... just not lemon-y enough.  I also added fresh squeezed lemon juice and lemon zest but still not enough.

I will definitely try the recipe again, I love the texture and how easy these are.

I made these for a Bible study, and used Duncan Hines Lemon Supreme cake mix, Watkin's Lemon Extract and scooped with a #40 scoop then rolled in the powdered sugar.  The scoop helps give the cookies a uniform shape.  My batch only made 19 cookies since the scoop is larger than a tablespoon.  Mine took a little longer than the 6-9 minutes, but my oven can be very temperamental.

Updated 9/28: Made these today again and they are much better than I remember.

This is my new favorite cookie.  It's super easy and tastes great.  I always add poppyseeds.  Maybe next time, I'll try it with a different cake mix.

Cookies are very lemony. I made the mistake of storing them with my chocolate chip cookies and they ended up tasting a little chocolate/lemon cookies. Overall they were good. Something different.

These were awesome. I made them for a cookie exchange a few weeks ago and I think everyone liked them. I did manage to burn one batch though! 

I chilled the dough in the fridge for about 15 mins and found it easy enough to work with.

these are very tasty cookies. I didn't give it 5 stars because they are a little cake like for me,and I like a lemon cookie that's a little tart. However,the look lovely,and they are very lemony,just not tart. I will make these again.

gets 5 stars for ease, quickness and good taste.  They would be great with some lemon frosting, but tasted very nice alone.  I also made using a spice cake mix and they were very yummy too.

These cookies are AMAZING! I have never been much of a baker, but have been trying very hard lately. Tonight when making some christmas (sugar) cookies i decided to try these out. My sugar cookies didn't turn out so well, so i am giving these out with christmas gifts this year. They are great, the only alteration i made was bake them at 350 instead of the 375, they are so moist on the inside. These will sure to be a winner this year! Thank you so much!

Update* 
Tried a chocolate version tonight, they turned out AWESOME! I added chocolate chips to them and pb chips too. They are really good, but very sweet! I will be trying out a cherry version soon. Love love love these cookies :o)

I made these cookies again today, (two days before Christmas) and I made a second batch with orange extract and orange cake mix.  FANTABULOUS!!!!  I think you could add just about any flavor you wanted ! I made these a few nights ago at a cookie baking party and they couldn't stop raving about them!

these were definitely easy to make but maybe my oven was just too hot - the bottoms of the cookies were burnt - but the tops were not done... after i turned the temp down to 350 and moved the rack up to the top, they turned out ok... flavor tastes too artificial but what do i expect from a cake mix!

These are good cookies, and quite easy.  The way of adding the lemon flavoring is versatile (I used some lemoncello I had on hand).  I took the advice of refrigerating the dough first, which made it easy to work with.  My cookies turned out flat and crisp, and were good this way. I made a sinple glaze of confectioners sugar and lemon juice, which I drizzled over the cookies, then added some multicolor sprinkles.  Very pretty, and the glaze added a lot of flavor.  I recommend this addition!

I made this recipe exactly as directed.  They needed an extra minute in the oven (10 total) but I think ovens are all slightly different.

They are WONDERFUL.  Can't believe something could be so good and so easy to make.  I was going to give some away, but can't stop eating them. A great choice if you like lemon and soft chewy cookies.

I was kind of worried about making these cookies using a cake mix.But after making them Im glad I did.They were good.I went by the recipe except I cooked mine for 7 minutes.I too think I undercooked mine.I didnt want to overbake them.Next time I will cook them a little longer.I will add this to my christmas cookie tray.You really have to love lemon to eat these.These are different and unique.That's why I think I like them.

These cookies are the best!  When I first made them I realized that I didn't have vegetable oil but I did have olive oil which actually works in a pinch.  I took them in to work the next day and people loved them!  They thought it was hysterical that they were made with olive oil.  I have given out this recipe several times, even to my best friend who is a huge cookie snob!  So easy and so good, I make them all the time!

Made these for the Pastor when he came to visit. Great hit! He took them home to his daugther, who loved them too. I added 1/2 teaspoon almond, and lemon zest to the batter.

This is a great little cookie.  I took the idea and ran with it.  I used a plain cake mix and added zest from a whole lemon and juiced half of it.  Squeeze the juice into a measuring cup and make up the 1/3 cup of oil with oil or as I did melted butter!!  Great flavor this way and more "homemade" tasting!!  Or as Sandra Lee would say "semi-homemade"!!!  Enjoy.

I use a slightly different way, though. Only one egg, the cake mix, and a 8oz tub of fat free cool whip. Yum! :D

I love these cookies!  Instead of powdered sugar I roll them in some granulated sugar with lemon zest and a squeeze of them juice mixed in.  I also replace the lemon extract with two tsp. of fresh lemon juice.  I highly recommend trying these cookies!

These were a huge hit with everyone who ate them.  I used fresh lemon juice instead of extract and a lemon glaze on top.

These cookies are delicious and a snap to make!  I added lemon zest and 2 teaspoons of lemon extract.  When the cookies were cooled I glazed them with a brush-powdered sugar, lemon zest and a little water.  It gives the cookie a nice sheen.  This cookie is what I have been looking for-a real lemon cookie!!!!!

Good.Easy.Quick.Used  lemon zest from 1 lemon, 2 tsp lemon extract, half a lemon's juice and just a little less oil to compensate for the extra liquid from the juice & extract & prevent them from being to wet. Not too hard to handle - just be gentle.

Mmmmmm, good!  I added a little lemon zest and will add a bit more next time (I love lemon - the more the better).  Also had a slight (VERY slight) problem with the cookies sticking to the baking sheets, so I lightly sprayed the sheets with "Pam For Baking With Flour" for the second round and that worked out well.  DELISH!

These were YUMMY! I put the powder sugar in one of my veg. serving bowls, which is shallow and wide and using my finger tips had no problem rolling them in the sugar. I had lemon chips, that I had been wanting to use, that I added to the batter. Everyone loved them and so easy to make! Thanks!

These cookies are super easy to make and taste great!  WAY better than typical cake mix cookie recipes.  Other reviewers noted the dough was sticky and difficult to handle, but I did not have this problem at all.  These cookies are pretty enough to give as gifts.

Theee cookies were a hit!!  found the reiew about packet of lemonade useful as I had no lemon extract on hand.  Also made a batch with white cake mix, box of lemon pudding, and lemonade and they urned out just as good.  I will be making theese at the request of my husband.

I thought I'd try this recipe because I've been making it for years with devil's food cake and peanut butter chips - which my kids love!  I followed the dough ingredients exactly but used my usual procedure.  I form the dough into balls, flatten slightly with a spatula and bake at 350 for 9-10 minutes.  I experimented with rolling a few dough balls in granulated sugar and a few in powdered sugar before making the whole batch.  I personally prefer the granulated sugar.  It made a nice subtle crunch on the outside while the inside was soft and chewy.  Warning though to make sure the inside is chewy - don't overbake even by a minute!  My first experiments were more like little cake cookies so I was careful to watch the time on the rest of them.  In the end, the cookies are good, very easy to make, but still have a somewhat artificial cake mix taste to them.  My chocolate ones taste more homemade.

I loved these! They're so easy it's unreal, and very easy to modify to other flavors. I've made chocolate and orange cookies using this recipe as a guide. Wonderful!I also use it for any large gathering since it's so easy to make lots of them.

I thought they were good.  I would say 9 out of 10 people liked them when I had my church over.  I placed them in an airtight container for the next day and they stayed fresh.

These were okay. It takes a few bites to end up liking it. What I did was break them into bite sized pieces and put them in a bowl of milk and ate as if it was like cereal. Also, I iced them with Betty Crockers Lemon Frosting.

This recipe is wonderful and easy.  I made them last night and they were gone with in 48 hours.  Everyone loved them.  I made them exactly as directed but I think I will try adding some lemon zest and a little lemon juice just to give it a little more punch (although they are great as they are).

This recipe was so easy!  Was quick to make and very quick to be eaten.  If you’re a cookie lover, and you like the taste of lemon, you’ll love this cookie!

YUM!  What fabulously tasty cookies...and so easy!  I rolled them in powdered sugar and pressed some Cakemate decors "Snowflakes" (only in the shapes of bunnies and chickies for Easter) onto the tops before baking (after rolling in powdered sugar), and it prettied the cookies right up.  These AREN'T a cookie for someone who is looking for a "lemonade" (sour) type of cookie.  They do taste a teensy bit like Fruit Loops, but that's what makes them so darn delicious.  :)

Very sweet and lemony! Slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I rolled mine into balls and they turned out perfectly. (though it did take awhile to roll ALL those cookies!) In my oven, they needed 10 minutes to cook thoroughly.

This recipe is a must for lemon lovers.  I omitted the lemon extract and used one small package of unsweetened lemon drink mix...it added an extra "zing" of lemon flavour.  A nice alternative to traditional lemon bars.

Another very quick cookie to make. It has enough lemon taste to give it that zing. They keep chewy and soft! All of these cookies went fast. My taste tester (my 10 yr old) gave it a thumbs up!

It doesn't get much easier than this!  The dough was very easy to handle when rolling into balls and then into the powdered sugar, and they have just the right combination of sweet/tangy & chewy/crispy!  Just wish it made more (have to take andvantage of those "buy 1 get 1 free" specials for cake mixes, I guess)!!  Thanks Lissa for sharing!

i added 2/3 C of lemon juice and a bit of zest, and cooked them at 350 degrees for 11-12 minutes. the extra liquid made the dough runny, so i sprinkled sugar on top rather than rolling them in it. they had a very pleasant flavor and were very light, but lacked the lemon *punch* i had hoped for. will tinker with them.

These have a perfect chewy inside, and lightly crisp outside. They are so easy, and the extra lemon extract adds just the righ zing.
