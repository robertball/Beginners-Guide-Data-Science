I substituted coconut flour/almond meal flour for the AP flour. I also sub'd applesauce/coconut oil for the veg. oil. Instead of muffins I put in 7x10 pan and sprinkled coconut on the top. Delicious and good for you.

I used all whole wheat flour, and old fashioned oats (not quick oats) and they were still delicious.  You wouldn't know the recipe was 'healthy!'

Was looking for a high fiber muffin since husband just had surgery and needs more fiber plus something to appeal to his decreased appetite and this looked promising. Made a few changes by adding 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and 1/4 cup of wheat germ, increased oats to 3/4 cup and cinnamon to 3/4 tsp., omitted oil and used the entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin puree and left out the white sugar and increased   brown sugar by 2 tablespoons. Used almond milk and apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Just added dried reduced sugar cranberries which is what I had and added some chopped pecans. With the additions it made 18 muffins and they were baked in 23 minutes. Very moist with lots of flavor and well received by my husband.

If you take half the white sugar in the recipe and use it to coat the fresh cranberries before adding them to the batter, they bake up sweet in the muffin.

Yum!  I substituted extra whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour.  I live at high altitude but these turned out perfect, so moist and flavorful, not dense at all.  I will definitely bake these again.

Great muffins!  I left out the white sugar, and used all dried cranberries instead of fresh.  Also added some chopped walnuts. They tasted great, and not too sweet.   I calculated 120 calories per muffin, not too bad!

Yum! I made 2 batches of these muffins, one batch I made with the oil the other batch I subbed applesauce for the oil.  Also, both batches I used 3/4 cups craisins plumped in hot water then drained.  The batch with the oil I found had a tad more flavor to them but they both came out excellent! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This will be my staple pumpkin recipe from now on. Like others have said it doesn't seem like a "healthy" recipe. The ginger does add a unique flavour - it makes you stop and think - what's different about this muffin? But it is not overwhelming and I wouldn't change it.  I have used both fresh and dried cranberries - made it twice in the past week and a double batch the second time because it is such a great seasonal recipe- but I actually prefer the dried cranberries.

This is a fall favorite. I substituted extra oats for the all purpose flower and left out the white sugar entirely. I used extra fresh chopped cranberries instead of adding dried.

imo these muffins should be called "low-fat, low-sugar" but that's fine with me as I'm always trying to find healthy ways to eat home-baked treats! I didn't add fresh cranberries as I find them too tart in baked goods (and it's lucky I didn't as these muffins aren't terribly sweet) but I did add orange dried cranberries and they added wonderful flavor. I also added dry roasted slivered almonds and a dab of fresh pureed ginger as I was out of dried, which added some much needed flavor, as well. I think this is a solid base recipe that needs additions/variations so they don't turn out too bland.

Very good healthy option. Will it replace my other pumpkin muffins with more oil and eggs? No but I will continue to make them when I have a health conscience guest. I rate these a 5 star for what they are, a healthy option recipe.

These are pretty good and my kids loved them! Very moist, lot's of flavour. I used 3/4 cup of dried cranberries that I plumped up in hot water, and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. I also added 1/4 cup of flax seed meal to boost the nutrition,( I do this in most baking recipes). I subbed the oil for applesauce which worked out great as there is very little oil anyways. This extra moistness would make it easy to use all whole wheat flour, so I'll try that next time.

AMAZING!!! They were soft and moist, and so delicious. I substituted another 1/4 cup of dried cranberries instead of fresh, and it still came out well. Also, it only took me 20 minutes to bake.

If you have the word healthy in the recipe title, my husband will automatically be a fan! I omitted the dried cranberries and increased the fresh cranberries to 1 cup chopped, added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and used buttermilk instead of the milk & vinegar. I added a few extra pieces of fresh cranberry bits and a sprinkle of oats on top of each muffin before I baked them and they turned out so pretty. The only problem I had is that they stuck to the pan a bit. Use baking cups or grease the pan really well.

They were way too sweet, and though I loved the fresh cranberries using the dried ones was a mistake.  The texture was also odd -- I wonder if they would have been better if I'd cooked them a shorter time. At 25 mins they were extremely moist inside but had a tough (but unburned) crust. We didn’t finish eating the recipe. I'll look for a different pumpkin muffin recipe and add fresh cranberries.

Doubled the recipe and made 18 instead. These were really good! I cut down on the sugar a little and sprinkled some sugar on the top of the muffin instead. I did not use dried cranberries but chopped up fresh cranberries, and added pecans. I used the whole large can of pumpkin and omitted the oil completely. These must have a good deal of fiber! I would love to make these again with raisins.

These muffins were so good.  My little guys and a dinner guest gobbled them up.  I did substitute 1/2 cup of apple sauce for the white sugar and increased the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I also put the oats in with the wet ingredients to soak for a bit since the oats we have require that.  Otherwise the oats are crunchy.  I will definitely make these again.

Turned out great! I used acorn squash and was out of ginger, so I had to sub 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice for the ginger and nutmeg. Really yummy despite raw cranberries! Also,  25 minutes made them very done in my oven, so next time I'll check them a bit earlier.

I doubled the recipe and used one can of pumpkin and one of whole berry cranberry sauce that I had leftover from the holidays.  I added some orange zest and juice too.  I had just a handful of dried cranberries so I tossed those in.

Since the cranberry sauce is sweet, I eliminated the white sugar.  I baked a trial one to see if it was sweet enough.  It was for me, but the family would want more so I added in a few table spoons of brown sugar.  You could also do a streusel topping.  

Two full large Pampered Chef scoops were just the right amount in each cup.

I just pulled these out of the oven and ate one!  Absolutely delicious and moist but not too heavy! I substituted the white flour with more wheat flour.  I omitted the white sugar completely and still found them to be sweet enough.  I added 1/2 cup of slivered almonds, which provided me with some crunch and texture.  Since I had no fresh cranberries I replaced them with dried.  I sprayed the pan with Pam and did not use paper liners.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I am trying to eat more whole grains and decrease my sugar so I really appreciate this recipe.

Next time I will add raisins,  they taste very close to a bran muffin even though there is no bran.

What a great simple recipe. It's perfect to substitute different ingredients. I added shredded carrots and fresh pumpkin instead of the canned pumpkin. I look forward to future discoveries with this one.

These are yummy! Only changes I made were to use all whole wheat flour, and instead of the dried cranberries, I added some chopped walnuts.  These are great with breakfast, and I love that they are low calorie (I calculated 135 calories each with my changes).  Will make these again and again!! Also, I only baked 18 minutes, and they were perfect, any longer and they might have been dry.  Could be because my oven runs a tiny bit hot though!

I have made this recipe as written but what I like most is that it's an easy recipe to make changes to to suit your preferences.     This is a hearty, denser, muffin good for a grab and go breakfast.  I typically use buttermilk and double the fresh cranberries as opposed to using the dried.  I do add a teaspoon of vanilla and add chopped pecans as well as sprinkle the tops with additional oats.  I've also added flax meal and the spices are easy to adjust to your preference.

These turned out very well without changing a thing and, unlike most baked goods, they were even better the second and third days after baking (like a stew or a soup).  They’re a “stick to your ribs” breakfast and my husband and I both enjoyed them.  We’re surprised that some people found these too sweet.  For us, they were perfect as is.  I’ll make these again and thank you for posting this recipe.

I just took the last of them out of the oven! Yummmmmm!!!
Had to try one still warm!  I doubled the recipe so ended up with 24. I used a combo of Craisins and raisins.... just excellent! My only issue is that no matter what I do my muffins never raise enough! they barely make it above the paper cups!  WHAT am I doing wrong?

Holy moly! This is so good!!!  I will definitely make these again!  I did make some substitutions because I had made a baked butternut squash recipe the other day and it was a major flop! So I was looking for a recipe to repurpose them and decided to sub in for pumpkin. This healthier recipe with caught my eye and I followed the recipe fairly closely (left out the oil, no white sugar cuz I was out and I added raisins and chopped walnuts). Huge hit with DH!! He was shocked when I told him they were only 150 calories each.  Thank you! Your recipe saved the day and my butternut squash! Haha! Thank you for sharing!

Followed the recipe using almond milk, and replaced vegetable oil with unsweetened applesauce.  I really liked these - moist, good flavor, substantial, and lo-cal (compared to so many other muffin recipes).

I skipped the dried cranberries and only used about a 1/3 of the sugar. I used the frozen cranberries left over from Christmas.  I appreciate the milk and vinegar option to running out and getting buttermilk I probably not use in the near future. Overall, a big hit with our brunch guests and my number one food tester - my husband.

Put a little bit of brown sugar extra on top it does a lot

Followed the recipe as written, and the muffins are great! Nice texture, not too sweet, and very easy to make. The only thing I’ll do differently next time is double the recipe!

Very tasty!!
I added a little brown sugar on the top before I put them in the oven & turned out great!!
My husband even likes them and he's not a fan of pumpkin or anything "low fat", lol.

I tried this receipt and love it, with my changes. I use another 1/2 cup whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. I left out the egg, and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of vinegar. These came out moist and delicious, the best pumkin muffins ever.

I made these as "mini muffins" for a Habitat for Humanity groundbreaking in our area, along with 3 other varieties of such.( Lemon poppy seed, Apple Struesel, Carrot Spice - 20 dozen in all)  I got 5 dozen from this recipe. used a small ice cream scoop to keep uniform size. Used all dried cranberries that I ran through the  food chopper - smaller pieces for smaller muffins, then plumped with water in the microwave. Because I was going for Variety in my presentation, and these came out a pretty brown with red specs, I did not add any glaze or streusel. It was easy to see that they were different from the other kinds.

Moist and delicious! I subbed almond milk for the milk. I only had 1/2 cup pumpkin purée so I used apple sauce for the other 1/2 cup. Turned out great!

These muffins are so good. I had one 10 minutes after it came out of the oven, and it was soft textured and very flavorful. I really got a good kick out of the ginger, but if someone doesn't like ginger, I would recomend reducing it a drop. These tasted like normal, non healthy muffins, and I barely noticed the oats or whole wheat.

My family and friends and I loved this recipe.  It was moist and tasty.  The spices really brought out the pumpkin flavor.  I only used dried cranberries because I didn't have fresh ones.  I omitted the white sugar and salt, but it still tasted great.  I will definitely make them again.  I also liked that it only used 2 tablespoons of oil.

Not sure.......I made some subs, applesauce for the oil, all organic whole wheat flour, and, no white sugar.  I used all brown sugar.  It was ok, but I had made the 100 calorie blueberry muffins 3days ago and they were excellent!  I also added flax seed, and nuts.  Again, it was ok, but kinda bland.   Friday I'm going to make them with less nutmeg or ginger.  Something..............I think after the blueberry muffins these were quite the let down.  The other muffins were a party in your mouth!

I made this for a Christmas party at a nursing home with a few modifications, some b/c that's what I had, some to make it healthier.
Old fashioned oats
Fresh cranberries only, no dried
1/2 cup sugar total
Skipped the salt
Yogurt in place of milk & vinegar
They turned out pretty well but didn't rise quite as much as I expected.  Maybe they needed the salt for that.  Still, they were quite tasty, & I would make again.

Easy, tasty, moist.  Will definitely make these on a regular basis.  Great seasonal muffin.  Freezes well and doesn't really need microwave warm up before serving.
