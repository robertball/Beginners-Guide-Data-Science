I thought these were fun to make! Next time I'm going to leave out the salt and use only half the sugar they recommend. But a nice treat on a summer day! :)

Great aroma and refreshing taste. Going to make another batch right away. These won't last long. Used 1/2 cup simple syrup I already had, rather than creating as described in the recipe. Otherwise, followed recipe as written.

Sooo good! I used less sugar but other than that, followed it exactly. Totally refreshingand easy!
