My Mom did orange pork chops so I had to try them! I used fresh oranges and the peel to give Max flavor. It was subtle but there non the less. The chops were boneless and soaked up the sauce. Really tender and juicy. Loved by all kids! Quick and easy for the busy week nights. Thank You Erika.

Hmmm.  works as a good base recipe but I had to make several adjustments...way too many to list here.  I will, however, say that I found the orange juice flavor to be overpowering.  My suggestion:  play around with the recipe and make modifications to taste.  It's a good starting place as far as recipes go.  Good luck!

Very flavourful, the orange flavor married beautifully with the pork. I used 3 cloves of minced garlic and browned the chops in a little bacon fat instead of non-stick spray and also coated the baking dish with about a tsp of bacon fat.

The orange juice concentrate was too overpowering to make it enjoyable, but I may try again with orange juice, or fresh orange.

My kids loved this and so did i. It's a great change of pace from the normal way we'd cook pork chops. We also tried it on chicken breast adn it's even better that way.

This was so easy to prepare and absolutely delicious.  I served it with acorn squash (mine with butter, lavender honey and cinnamon and his with butter, salt and pepper).  The rice we prepared with a taste of Thai.
