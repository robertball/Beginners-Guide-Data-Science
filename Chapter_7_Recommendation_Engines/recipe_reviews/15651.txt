I'm sorry....this may be quick, but it's just too "chemical". It tastes like something made in a laboratory, not a kitchen.

I used french vanilla pudding and a fruit cocktail called Very Cherry by Del Monte.  It gave it extra yummy flavor.  Very quick and easy!

My grandmother used to make a dish almost exactly like this that I absolutely loved so I'm very glad I came across this recipe.  This is a good base but it needs a little help.  As another reviewer said, it does have a chemical taste.  I think that's because it's way too much pudding mix and not enough cool whip.  The cool whip needs to be doubled, as with the fruit cocktail.  Also, I reccommend not draining the fruit cocktail as the pudding mix will thicken it anyways.  I also added mini marshmallows and coconut to mine and topped with a maraschino cherry.  DB ate it all up and demanded heaping seconds! I will keep this recipe around but will have to keep tweaking it to get the right consistency.

This is very good.  I like to add a small can of Pineapple tidbits to this as well.  Make this for all my BBQ's.

quick, easy and tastes great! People were surprised when I told them how easy the recipe was. I like using a little less cool whip and often add more fruit.
