I added half the amount of milk called for--we wanted a thicker shake. The kids and I shared this between us. We thought this was very good, I'll make this again. NOTE: I used Turkey Hill vanilla bean ice cream and PURE peppermint extract.

OK check it out......here is my version: 4-5 large scoops vanilla ice cream, 1/3 to 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp mint (not peppermint-i always associate peppermint with pinks and reds.......not greens!) extract and 6-7 drops of green food coloring. Blend it up real good and voila! I think its a pretty close match to McDonalds shamrock shake but hey...who am I??? lol

I cut back on the milk to 1/2 Cup for one serving so it wouldn't be too liquidy. I added the green coloring and I thought this made a very tasty shake! Make sure you are conservative with the mint. You can always add more, but you can't take it back if you use too much. :)

This shake was pretty good, but a little heavy on the peppermint extract. It was a little strong. The consistency was much thinner than most milk shakes, which made it easy to drink through a straw. This recipe makes two huge servings;  I split it between me, my husband, and our 8 yr old, and it was the perfect amount for us.

I made this for the kids and tasted it.  It's been a long time since I've had a Shamrock shake, but it tastes pretty similar to what I remember.  I topped the kids' with a dollop of Cool Whip and some mini chocolate chips.  They loved it!

All we can say is McDonald's move over, we are making our own Shamrock shakes all year long. So delicious!

Yummy! I used a little less milk than called for (plus it was skim milk, not 2%), but otherwise followed the recipe. Since it was 85 here on St. Patrick's Day it hit the spot! Thanks :)

The McDonalds clone from on-line is: 2 c. of vanilla ice cream, 1 1/4 c. of milk, 1/4 tsp. of mint extract, and 8 drops of food coloring. When I measured out the ingredients, this came pretty close. I would use regular and not reduced fat ice cream, as this runs on the thin side. I would also add the milk, starting with 1/2 cups, until the desired thickness is achieved. I would add 1 c. or less for more of a milkshake consistency vs. a drink. I did use the mint extract, but now I am thinking I would rather have tried the peppermint.

We had fun making these with my parents, my son and his cousins.  We all helped make the shakes, then chose our own toppings (whipped cream, sprinkles, cherries, mini choco chips, etc).  Perfect shake as written, didn't need any tweaks.  What I personally liked is that we could put these in smaller cups and the serving size was perfect for me.  We made 2 batches for 7 of us.

I made this recipe exactly how it was written. After I wasn't totally happy with the results I smashed up some Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips and threw them in. That really made a difference. Next time I will listen to some of the reviews. You need only about 1/2 of the milk it calls for, And I would is mint instead of peppermint extract. If I do make it again definitely throwing the crumbled dark chocolate chips in! Yum. Try it...it's a simple shake recipe that just needs a little tweaking.

I made a lower carb version by substituting the ice cream with cottage cheese and plain Greek yogurt, the milk with almond milk and a little cream, and adding Stevia along with the peppermint and green food coloring. My children and I all enjoyed it as a St. Patrick's Day treat!

Only thing I changed was I used mint extract. I got tired of waiting for March to roll around. This is very close to the real thing.
