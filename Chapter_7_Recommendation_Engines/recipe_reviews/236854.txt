Omg. Delicious and moist. I halved the recipe and used the regular bread cycle with a light crust.. I used bread flour instead of regular flour and couldn't have been more thrilled.  A little honey on the side and it's a wonderful treat.

This bread has great flavor - kind of nutty with a tang of dill. I mostly just use my machine to mix dough, which I did here. Mine will only make a 2lb. loaf anyway...It does the first rise, and this loaf didn't rise nearly as much as other breads I've done - and I used 1TBLSP instant yeast + 1TBLSP gluten. You do state your recipe makes a "dense" loaf, and it sure would have if I hadn't changed things! To make sure I got the max flavor of the pickle juice (I used 2c juice & no water) I put it in the fridge overnight. I then formed it into 4 little "French" loaves & let it rise, which took a long time because of starting cold. I then baked them @ 400* for 22 minutes. They are SO good, but not too dense, which I prefer. One loaf already gone for my dinner (with spicy tuna salad on it). I will be making this often - thanks for posting!

Wanted to like this and once done tried to strongly coax and encourage myself to like it but in the end I accepted I just really didn't care for this very much. While the submitter describes this as "a dense and zesty loaf " I found it to be overly dense with an underdeveloped crumb and very little pickle juice flavor.

I was wondering if a little more yeast was added if it would raise higher.

We LOVED this bread and I don't even really like pickles! I only eat them on a cheese toastie and a hamburger - nothing else. But this recipe has intrigued me since I first saved it. I had to make this with my KA mixer and a bread pan as my bread machine will not make a loaf this size. I let the KA do its thing and then I formed a loaf and let it rise in a bread pan for 1 hour. Knowing that this would be a very heavy loaf I added 1 TB of yeast and 1 TB of vital wheat gluten to make it a little lighter. It baked at 400 for 22 minutes but should have baked for about 25-26 minutes. I am taking the rest of the loaf to school to share with co-workers and play 'guess the ingredient'. Lucky for me I have a huge jar of pickle juice to make this recipe again. (The benefits of running the school concession stand.) We enjoyed this bread with 'Better than Zuppa Toscana' from AR. I will not hesitate to share this recipe. It is a keeper in our house.
