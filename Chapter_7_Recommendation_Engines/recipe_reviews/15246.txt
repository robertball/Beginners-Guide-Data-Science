YUMMY is definitely what this recipe is!!!! Instead of kiwi, I used fresh blueberries from my garden. 32 marshmallows equals 1/2 the bag.  Make sure not to leave the butter and marshmallows while melting on the stove because it will burn quickly. Also, to press the marshmallow mixture on the pan I used the back of a large measuring metal cup sprayed with pam (this makes for an even  1/2" - 3/4" crust). Hubby was not fond of the cocoa powder in the cream cheese filling. Next time I *will* leave out the cocoa powder. For the cream cheese filling I used Bonnie's fruit dip-halved recipe, plus 4 oz. of cream cheese and only 1 cup of confectioner's sugar (it was more than enough, and it was all I had).  Can't wait to make this for the kids friends...great way to get them to eat their fresh fruits!!!

Wow, yummmmmy!!!  This was my Father's Day dessert I made for my amazing man and friends of ours who are expecting their first baby any day now!!  Everyone loved it and it was all eaten up!

CHANGES ~ I didn't add anything to the top.  (no jam, no whipping cream) or anything....just added the fruit and that was it!

Thanks for the pic!  When I printed the recipe, there was no pic...so I was "guessing" what it was supposed to look like!  ;-)

This recipe was wonderful.  I did have to use 2 1/2 Tablespoons of Whipping Cream instead of the 2 teaspoons it recommended.  I made it the night before and the bananas didn't even turn brown - Thanks to that Apricot jam.  This was wonderful!  Everyone at work was fighting over who would get the last piece! This is definitely a "keeper" recipe.

This fruit pizza had a fun twist with the rice crisp crust and chocolate sauce.  I thought it was good, but not GREAT.  If you make this be sure to keep it refrigerated until serving time, or the chocolate sauce gets watery & the fruit will melt into it.  Overall I'd say this recipe is worth a try!

Fantastic!!  I used choco dyna bites for the cereal in the crust.  The color is stunning against the fruit and looks very exotic.  Also used whipped cream out of a can right before serving..
My kids request this every time, a real winning recipe.  Thanks a bunch!

This tasted great but was kind of messy.  I used the apricot jam, but it didn't keep my fruit from turning brown.  Maybe I diluted it too much.  But... definitely one of the more unique and best tasting fruit pizza I have had.

This was so easy to make.  It tastes worderful and looks amazing.  Instead of dropping the whipped cream onto the pizza I sort of drizzled it.  Very Pretty!

Great fruit pizza! I chose to leave out the cocoa powder and was happy I did, it tasted wonderful! I also didn't put the whipped cream on top but I bet that would have been good too.

Yum.  We didn't use the exact fruit it called for but it was really good.  Next time I'll use less 'sauce' to much for my taste.

Absolutely loved it! I made it for a school food day and it was more than well-recieved. This was the first time I'd even attempted to make anything like this but it was so easy and so delicious. It was really rich, as mentioned, so I'd suggest not putting a thick layer of the chocolate mixture. Less is more was the key to when I was making this! Everyone really did come back for seconds and no one believed me when I said I'd made everything from scratch AND had loads of fun doing it. Amazing!

This was really quite a fun recipe to make with the kids.  But you can omit a lot of these ingredients to keep it feeling fresh and light.  

Heeding others warnings, I only used 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and a few tablespoons of Swiss Miss hot chocolate (instead of unsweetened cocoa powder).  It was just delicious--not too sweet at all.  I also omitted the jam glaze and whipped cream toppings.  The chocolate cream cheese is more than enough.  I also used the fruits I had on hand--pineapple, bananas, blackberries, and strawberries.  It was delicious!!
