Sorry to read that many of you don't like the flavor of the cookies - it's a fact - they are not very sweet and have a dry consistency (they are from a German cookie recipe - our cookies are often dry and brittle as they are usually eaten with coffee and tea, just like an Italian biscotti). The dough in this case needs to be dry in order to hold the shape. They are intended as a "joke" cookie - you make a batch to bring to a Halloween party or your kid's class and everybody eats one cookie.  Your kids will have a blast making them. My kids loved making them and eating them (but they are used to not very sweet cookies), but the main "goal" for them was to look like little "turds" and to be a fun edible project....not the type of cookie you bake when you're dying for cookies.

I made a few changes to your recipe and was much happier with the results.  First I increased the powder sugar amount to 1 & 3/4  cups. Then I reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp.  and reduced the Cocoa powder to 1/3rd cup.  I also increased the milk to 1/3 cup. Everything else I left as is. Thanks for positing your recipe, it was a wonderful idea and I am glad I ran with it. My grands and great grandchildren love them.

I made the recipe as is and did notice it was a bit dry. I added about another 1/4 c of milk and that helped a lot. I like that it's not too sweet. U can always add more sugar to it. After my adjustment I liked it and so did my kids.

My daughter is obsessed with poop emojis at the moment, so we made these. They are quite realistic! I did find that I had to add more milk to the dough, because it was too dry to even knead it. It was also hard to roll after, so I'd probably add even more milk next time. They are not overly sweet, but I didn't mind that

These turned out perfect! I rolled a few in powdered sugar to make them look like old poo. I shaped some I to the shape of turds and some into the emoji shape. I also took the advice of adding additional powdered sugar and cutting the amount of cocoa and baking powder. Happy April Fool's Day!

These cookies are awful! Very dry and not sweet at all. Cute idea but the recipe needs work. I threw half of my dough away

I did not care for this recipe. I made these with my 4- year olds because they think poop is hilarious right now. They are too dry, without much flavor.

Made per instruction except baked about 10-11 mins, not 12. After everyone's first bites, added lots of frosting. 

Pros:  LOTS of fun making them with my kids who thought making poop was hilarious. They really held the poop shape!  Lots of chocolate flavor. 

Cons:  VERY dry. The frosting was added to make them edible but they still were crumbly. Kids, husband & I all agree the taste/texture of the finished product was not good. 

Fun factor is a 10 out of 5 stars. Taste is a zero out of 5.

Made it according to the recipe, super dry and flavorless. Not sure if I'm gonna put eyes on them because the kids have tasted them and won't even eat them. Will probably save the eyes for cupcakes or something. Not impressed.

I put Hersey kisses in the middle for better shaping. Since this cookie itself is not too sweet, chocolate in the middle made it perfect. Me and my son had so much fun making it.

My daughter is obsessed with the  poop emoji so I made these for Easter and I read the reviews before hand saying how they were dry and didn’t have much taste. So I added a little bit extra milk cut back on the cocoa powder and added a little bit more sugar. I also rolled them into sugar crystals and sprinkled a little powdered sugar on them after. They were so dry still and they tasted terrible they were so flavorless and disintegrated in your mouth. The idea is cute and they do look cute but they taste like ! ! Very disappointed and will never make these again
