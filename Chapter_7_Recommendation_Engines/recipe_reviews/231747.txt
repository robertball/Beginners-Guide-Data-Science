Didn't really appeal to me, too dry. Plus the "Probiotic" benefit is zero after being in a 400 degree oven.

We liked these.  I made half the recipe and got 8 generous sized muffins.  I used fat free Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and added 2 tbs instant coffee because I like how it enhances the flavor of chocolate.  I only had unsweetened chocolate squares and found the muffins to be as sweet as I would like them.  They are moist and lighter than I expected.  Thanks for sharing!

It's doubtful that probiotics would survive 18 minutes at 400 degrees!

Muffins were dry and was not sweet enough to my taste.  May try to tweak it try it again.
