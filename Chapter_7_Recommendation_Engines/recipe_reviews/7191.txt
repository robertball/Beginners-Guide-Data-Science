I doubled this and I think if I would double it again I would use three bananas and less cinnamon.  The cinnamon really overpowered the banana taste.  Nice and moist though!

I made lots of changes to this recipe. I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. I also used splenda instead of sugar and unsweetened applesauce instead of margarine. I was trying to make them as healthy as possible because I'm on a really strict diet. They taste absolutely delicious! The only thing I would change next time is I would add a bit more banana.

Delicious- caution not to bake 30 minutes... mine were on the well side at 28 minutes.  I added mini chocolate chips and my kids loved them.  Bake on middle shelf in the oven!

I used fat free vanilla yogurt as suggested by another review and was great!  Even the man liked it (and he usually can detect fat free items!)  Thanks...

This is a fantastic recipe, just the right combination of spices and banana.  One suggested alteration for those who are interested: my husband has diabetes and i use half sugar and half splenda, and it works wonderfully, with no loss of flavor!

Great muffin recipe.  This has made my favorites list.  I added nuts, and a hint of almond extract.  Nice and light, and made great mini muffins!

I've been looking for the perfect banana muffin recipe for a long time -- now I've found it! 

I also substituted half of the butter with tofu - it's incredible!

The muffins were moist, as promised, but they are pretty bland and don't taste much of banana.

This is the best I have ever tasted!  I added a 1/2t banana flavoring and made the muffins in a mini muffin pan.  My 10 month old son loves them.  
Thank you JoJo. I will only make this banana recipe from now on.

Made mini muffins of these for my son's daycare. They gobbled them up! I used 1 1/2 cups mashed bananas (approx 4 bananas) and kept everything the same.

Thank You for letting me use your recipe, This recipe was good, I will use it again. I used butter in place of margine, used 1 cup splenda inplace of sugar, and added 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts, I also used foil cupcake raps instead of paper. I will have to make another batch using reg sugar.

I substituted sugar free apple sauce for the margerine, splenda for the sugar, pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon, used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and one cup all purpose flour.  I also added a tablespoon of vanilla extract and chocolate chips.  These came out very good and moist.

Love these muffins!  I always add half a bag of chocolate chips though.  Everyone asks for this recipe when I take them to school or bake sales.  The responce is that they don't taste to much like bananas.

These were great!  I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips.  (That was the only way I could get my daughter to eat these...chocolate chips are 1 of her 5 food groups :-) )   Anybody else out there got a picky eater??  :-)  One other time I made these and I added 4 tbsp kahula and 2 tbsp milk.  Of course my daughter wouldn't go near them, but my husband inhaled them!  Thanks for sharing!  One last comment...start checking these @ 20 minutes in the oven!

My daughter, who does not like bananas, enjoyed these muffins, but I think it's because there isn't much flavor.  They are good, but not wow!

I found these to be too dry for my taste and not enough banana flavor, which may be ok for some people but didn't work for me.

These banana muffins are perfect in their simplicity.I like my muffins really moist, so I didn't measure the banana - I just used three (medium sized).They turned out great!  My friends really liked them.

A must-have for all cooks.  Add whipped cream and serve them as a dessert, keep them for a quick and delicious breakfast, slice them and toast them for tea parties.  This recipe always turns out great!

Good recipe~ I doubled the banana, added 4 extra Tablespoons of milk and 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. Also, baked at 325 degrees due to nonstick pan and only baked 25 minutes~ almost too long. Nice dense muffin with good banana flavor. The kids loved it and so did the adults! Will make again.

I had 2 bananas, which equaled 2/3 cup, so I cut the recipe to 2/3 (made easy by the Customize This Recipe calculator) and made 12 muffins. I added vanilla & a touch of maple flavor, as well as a generous dash of nutmeg, and I used butter in place of oleo. The texture was melt-in-your-mouth tenderness, just the right amount of sweetness, and a warm banana fragrance for the house. Another great muffin recipe--thanks Jo-Jo!

My first experience baking muffins from scratch. I have made this recipe twice now, following the directions exactly, and they always end up PERFECT. My family never hesitates to eat one of these, and they're great for using up the bananas that ripen too fast with the hot weather. I've added walnuts and chocolate chips, as well as making them plain. Delicious! I will be using this recipe again and again!

I made these 2 times in last week.  Keep it simple:  Mix dry ingredients first, then just put in eggs, milk, and bananas.  Mix together on medium until blended.  I add chopped pecans.  Easy, very good recipe.

These are very good, I followed the recipe as is but added in some mini chic chips and walnuts! Next time I may add even more cinnamon as we like things with more spice... This can easily be adjusted to suit your tastes, thanks jojo for the recipe:-)

These were the best muffins I ever made. I didn't even have the bananas on hand and they were incredible. I did add a little vanilla extract and a bit of huney. My whole family loved them. I'll make them with the bananas I'm sure. Great recipe

I've had a lot of banana muffins in my life ... these are among the top 3.
Next time I'll add walnuts to this recipe too.
I used butter in lieu of margarine.
They're GREAT!!

Fabulous muffins!!! So moist and delicious! Will make again and again! I only made 1 small change, I added a teaspoon of vanilla. Quick and easy to make, great way to use up old bananas! Thanks

A muffin.  And yet so much more.  We found that the addition of craisons or chocolate chips embellished the flavor intensely.  Doubling the recipe made twice as many muffins plus four.  Jo Jo you have revolutionized our evening.

I made these lower cal (about 110 per muffin) by using half sugar, half Splenda and subbing applesauce for the margarine. I used four ripe bananas as well. These came out moist and delicious.  Only took about 23 minutes at 350 though.

This is a great recipe, but I used 3 bananas, only 3/4 Cup of sugar (so it wasn't to sweet), 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 TBS pumpkin pie spice, and most important...butter instead of marg.  I will absolutely make these again.  They were still great the next day (others I've made get rubbery/spongy)  These are a very moist muffin!!  Thank you!!

These were very good but not quite as dense I like my muffins and banana bread.  I might try decreasing the baking powder/soda next time. Also, mine spread out across the top of the muffin cups instead of up, making it difficult to get them out without breaking off the sides of the crown.  I'll try 1 Tbs less milk next time to see if a slightly thicker batter works better.

These were delicious.  I used 1/2 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup chocolate chips and butter instead of margarine.  Mine were done in 22 minutes but I think my oven is running hot these days.

these muffins were very easy to make. I twisted it a bit and added the normal chopped walnuts, and then I also added 4 of the single serving boxes of craberries and raisins that happened to be packaged in the same little box! DELICIOUS!! BIG HIT WITH THE FAMILY

I have now made these a few times, and they are easy and delicious! I have made them in mini muffin tins, and our kids enjoy eating the mini muffins. Cook the mini muffins for about 10 minutes or so - just watch them.

THE BEST EVER!!!!! I made these muffins and they were so moist it's hard to 
stop at just one. I only had one egg so I put that in and also I used 3 bananas
(which made more than a cup of bananas)  I also added 
chocolate chips. I am keeping this one forever. Thks, Donna-Canada

These were really good! Thanks for posting. The cinnamon was a perfect added touch. Next time I will either use more banana or add a little banana extract for more banana flavor.

I used a mixture of whole wheat/white flour and oats, cut the sugar down to 1/4 because my bananas were REALLY rip and I switched the milk with the margerine and used soured milk for the milk and homemade organic applesauce in place of the oil called for. These smelled divine while baking and the kids loved them. They came out really moist and fluffy.

I added a tad bit of vanilla extract to the milk.  In addition, use very ripe bananas!!! Some reviews stated a "bland taste", which is not the case if deep brown bananas are used in this recipe.  The muffins are moist and tasty!

These are great! I did change a few things.  I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of quick oats in place of 1 cup of reg. flour.  I also cut the butter in half and used a 6 oz. container of vanilla yogurt.  For the sugar I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown.  Added a pinch of nutmeg and a sprinkle of brown sugar on the tops.  Just trying to make it a bit healthier so I don't feel so bad handing one to my son.

This was a great recipe, but I did make some changes to it. I used this fresh ground whole wheat flour that I have available at a local market. I also used a lot more bananas. I ended up using 6 large ripe bananas. I also baked them for only 20 min. Overall the recipe was great!

These muffins were fantastic. I added a half a cup of chocolate chips to the batter. There isn't anything more delicious than banana chocolate chip muffins. They stayed extremely moist. I kept them in a large tupperware container to make sure they stayed that way. They were easy to make. What a great use for over-ripe bananas!

I only had a muffin pan for 6, so I scaled the recipe ingredients down.  I added a tad more banana than it called for, and omitted the salt.  Followed all other ingredients as written.  My whole family loved this.  I will make again.  Thanks for doing the hard part.  Yum Yum in my tum tum!

Delicious! I followed the suggestion of a few other people and added some nutmeg and vanilla, and I baked them for 20 mins. My husband and I loved them. Thanks! :)

YUMMMMMMMMMMMM YUMMM!! Great, easy, and O-SO-FORGIVING of a recipe...lolol  I had three major strikes going against these muffins from the start, and they still turned out blue ribbon TASTY!!   This will be one of my funnier confessions ever!   

I was doing 10 things at once (and paying attention was NOT one of them).  I accidentally tossed the sugar into the flour (not creamed into the wet ingreds)...duh. Then, I accidentally doubled the baking powder (double duh), and had to fish some back out. THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST I could NOT find my muffin tins since my major fire months ago. TRIPLE DUH! So, I made muffin tops (as I had once seen in a B&B). I spooned 1/4 cu batter piles onto a Pam sprayed nonstick cookie sheet.  Baked aprox 15 min - or until golden.  VERY Funny looking but deeeeeeelicious~

NOTE* Up the salt to 1 t, up the mashed banana, and add 1 t. of vanilla (At least...I THINK I did that..LOL).

beautifully light and airy.  I didn't find these dry at all.  I used oil in lieu of butter, as I was all out.  Had 2 large ripe bananas.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla and used 1 tsp. salt. (had read reviews on the blandness issue)  This made 6 Texas -size muffins baked at 30 minutes, and 9 mini muffins baked for 13 minutes.  This is a thinner batter, so I would be leary of adding choc. chips unless they are minis; otherwise I'm afraid they would all sink to the bottom.  I had some leftover streusel topping and threw that on the giant muffins in a rather thin manner and they didn't sink.

I made these muffins according to the recipe (except I did add walnuts to some of them as dh prefers it that way).  They were moist, light and full of banana flavor.  I did place them in a storage bag while still slightly warm as others had warned about them drying out, but I don't know that it was absolutely necessary.  I will be serving these along with a selection of other muffins on Christmas morning (freezing ahead to save time)

I made 6 servings and used applesauce in stead of margarine. We all loved it and made it again the other day. This will be great in winter on a cold day. 
I used more banana and because of this and the applesauce the muffins were still moist on the inside. Very delicious.

I thought that this recipe was delicious! I used two over-ripe bananas, and 1/2 cup of butter instead of margarine. When the muffins had cooled, I dipped the tops in a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon for a finishing touch! My co-workers devoured them! What a fantastic way to use those left over bananas that no one will eat!

I added 1 tbsp vanilla and 3/4 chopped walnuts. This resulted in more batter, so I got 22 muffins. They were moist and delicious. I will certainly make them again! Thank for sharing this great recipe!

These are fantastic like everyone is saying.  I tried other banana recipes here but these are the BEST!  And my DH loves them too!  They puff up fine, and are just scrumptious!  When making 12 of them use 1 egg (not 1 1/3 egg like it says in the scaled down version).  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Also, for 12 muffins use 3 very very very ripe bananas and they'll come out great!

Wonderful Muffins!  I was a little leary of the cinnamon flavor with bananas...BUT I was pleasantly surprised!  I substituted tofu for half the butter as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe JOJo!

This is a wonderful recipe. I doubled the recipe and used 7 medium bananas. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. For the last batch that I baked, I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Both versions with or without the chips were excellent. Each batch took between 22 and 25 minutes to bake. The muffins were moist and flavorful, and my family loved them. I definately will be making these again sometime.

This was so simply and good, I think the ones that said that they were dry just doesn't know how to bake or over baked them. Very moist and tasty, have given it out to several people. Thank you so much for this recipe it is just what I was wanting.

A little bland.  No pizazz.  Just plain old boring muffin.  Perhaps more banana and cinnamon and maybe a streusel topping would help it.

I liked these very much.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used two bananas which yielded 1 scant cup of mashed bananas, I think next time I will use three for more banana flavor and moistness. Will definitely be making again.

I substituted apple sauce for the margarine and half a cup of eggbeaters for the eggs to try and cut back on bad fats.  I also didn't use cinnamon since i was out.  But these turned out great.  If the recipe can withstand me butchering it I'm thinking it's a good one.  I only had to bake them for 25mins.  I would recommend starting there since they baked fairly quickly.

These were so good!  I thought it sounded like there was too much cinnamon in them, but it was just enough.  I added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts and filled the cups a little higher to make 12 larger muffins.  It was just enough batter and they puffed up quite nicely.  Don't bake them more than 25 minutes though or I imagine they'll dry out.  Awesome recipe!  I'm definitely going to make these again!  Edited 04/10--for my new diet, I decided I wanted to try and make the muffins more filling.  I only added one cup of all-purpose flour and added 3/4 cup of oatmeal, as well as 1/4 cup of 100% whole wheat flour.  I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and they were still fabulous!  I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe!

Delicious!! Instead of 2 c. flour, I used 1/2 cup wheat flour, 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1/2 c. white flour; cut sugar in half and also used 2 1/2  bananas.  Less sugar really made the banana stand out! I baked it as a loaf also and it was great with coffee!

Based on other reviewers, I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used 4 VERY ripe bananas to enhance the banana flavor and added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to give it an extra kick, while decreasing the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp instead of 1 whole tsp.  I also added an 1/8 cup more sugar, and lessened the salt to 1/4 tsp.  The result was fantastic - incredibly moist and delicious.  I would definitely make these again.

These came out nice and simple, just like the recipe.  I only had one banana, so I added just a tiny bit of almond extract for a little more flavor. I agree less time is needed. I only baked mine for 20 minutes, and they were just right, but close to overdone. More bananas as directed would have definitly helped with the moisture.  As is, they had a crisp top right out of the oven. I used all the batter for just 12 muffins, which made for nice big muffin tops.

I read the reviews and went w/this recipe. I also switched out the flour (50% whole wheat and 50% all-purpose). I also recalculated to 12 because that's how many slots are in my muffin tin and I just have one. I still had enough mix for four more muffins so I finished the batch and baked the remaining four. I'd like to try other calorie-cutting options, like the Splenda but was afraid to right off the bat. I used four bananas. I added walnuts (not low-cal, I know). In any case, it was a good recipe.

Very easy to make. My husband is sleeping in this morning, so I had some extra time to make these for breakfast.  They were moist and very delicious!

This is a very good recipe.  It is simple, but very tasty.  I made this tonight and it was very simple.  The muffins cooked up nicely in 20 minutes.  I would not cook them any longer.

these are quite good. i had to sub shortening for the butter since i only have a light butter spread which i don't think would have worked well in muffins.  anyway i added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and frosted with a cream cheese icing.  yum yum yum.  only complaint is i think the cook time is tooo long.  20 mins tops is good. my first batch was a little crispy around the edges, i should have checked them earlier.

Very moist!  I only had 2 small, ripe bananas, so I used an old trick told to me years ago by a friend.  I bought a 6oz. jar of baby food bananas and added that to my 2 mashed bananas.  We also threw in some walnuts.  Very good muffins with wonderful flavor!  Hint:  I use baby food carrots when making my carrot cakes also.  I haven't shredded a carrot in YEARS.

This was very easy! I cut the recipe in half. ( I only had one overly ripe banana.) Also, I threw in some extra chocolate chips that I had laying around. Yum!

Again, like others, I added Vanilla, but also added an extra mashed banana.  I like to be sure the bananas are VERY ripe, they seem to make the muffins soooo moist.

I have been trying a bunch of different banana muffin recipes lately and I really liked this one. We were out of milk so I added a bit of plain yogurt. I also added just a bit of vanilla. Really good.

These are really good. They are lighter and fluffier than a typical banana bread muffin but have really good banana flavor. I added a bit of nutmeg and cloves and it was good. I only had one small banana on hand so I halved the recipe and added unsweetened applesauce to round it out to 1/2 cup. This worked well.

Very good! I used Splenda instead of sugar and applesauce in place of margarine. I did also add a little extra banana. They were very moist and cakelike. A make again for sure.

YUMM YUMMM!!!  These were awesome banana muffins.  Very moist!  I found it ironic that my nickname is Jo Jo...The only thing I changed was that I double the recipe, and instead of adding the 4 cups of flour I added 3 cups flour and 1 cup oats.  They made the muffins a little hearty and added some fiber.  Definately try this recipe!!!

Loved these muffins!  Nice and moist with a great banana flavor. I used 2 large over ripe banana's that I had to use up. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and only used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon which was perfect.  Any more would have been too much. Mine were perfectly done at 20 minutes, so watch your baking time.

I have now made this recipe 8 times. I didn't make muffins though. I made it into bread. I followed everything to a tee except I added in 2 tablespoons of vanilla. Without or without this is an amazing recipe! My family and friends adore it! Thank You

I usually follow recipes perfectly, but lately, I've been trying to make things a little healthier. I followed the root of the recipe,, but I just made healthier subs. For example, I used half w.w flour and half regular. Also, used same amount of unsweetened apple sauce instead of butter. That's it! Other than that, followed the recipe well. Came out sooo moist and delicious. Even the kids really loved it. You wouldn't be able to tell that this was a slightly healthier version! Thanks for sharing, so easy and delish.

I almost followed this recipe to a T.  But I used half a cup of sugar and half a cup of Strawberry Jam.  Wow! Nice and moist, the kids are going to love these for breakfast in the morning!  Nice, sweet, moist and yummy!  Thanks.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I used 5 bananas because that is what I had to use up and I used a mini muffin pan and baked them for 12 minutes.  Perfect!

These bake up beautifully - just like the picture, however, they just didn't do it for me. A bit dry, a bit bland (even used three 'nanas).  Pumpkin pie spice VS cinnamon.

Good basic banana muffin.   Prefer to use half butter and half shortening because I find all margarine tastes too greasy and heavy.   Really do not knnow how reviewers can rate a recipe when they have changed it almost completely before trying.   The above adjustments do not detract from the recipe - just a matter of taste.   Thanks again for a good basic muffin recipe - it works perfectly.

Very Good Banana Flavor, Made them the first time and added blueberries. Do not do this!!!! Too many flavors going on.
Very good basic muffin recipe. If making blueberry would probably add more sugar.

Good recipe. I used butter instead of margarine and 3 large over-ripe bananas. My recipe yielded 12 large muffins rather than 18 regular ones. For 6 I added about 1 cup of fresh blueberries (YUM!). The other 6 I added about 2/3 cup of chocolate chips. This is a simple, delicious and moist muffin!

These muffins came out perfect for me.  They were fluffy, moist and flavorful.  My kids devoured them. The recipe is perfect as is, did not change a thing.  Will definitely make these again.

I was rather dissapointed, I followed the recipe exact and it came out really blah tasting, it didnt have much banana flavor...I think it needs a full cup of banana instead of 2/3(I cut the recipe down to yield of 12 instead of the 18)

definatly not the best muffins ever

Quite literally, the BEST tasting banana muffins I've ever baked. My entire home was filled with warm baked banana scent for hours, and the muffins were not at all a disappointment. Fluffy, very moist, yet not crumbling as you try to eat. DEFINATELY a keeper!!
Kids went nuts!

Came out really well! I used Cinnamom Chunk apple sauce instead of margarine, I had 4 over-riped bananas, so I used them all. And I also added chocolate chips to half of the batter just to try. Recipe is easy and definetely a keeper!

These rock! Great flavor, very very moist and they sort of stuck to the pan, and were hard to get out without breaking. I'll use liners next time round. Great easy recipe thanks 8-)

My seven year old liked them so much that he suggested I write this review.
These are delicious. And sooooo moist! I added chocolate chips.  But it really wasn't necessary.  These are good with or without.  Thanks

Very Good!  Moist and airy.  The only thing I would do different next time is add a little more banana.  The banana flavor is present but for me not bold enough.  I just ate 3!  Mmmm!

Great recipe with a few changes.  I substituted half the flour for seven grain, olive oil for the margarine, and cut out 25% of the sugar.  The bananas were thrown into the mix unmashed as I used a mixer on the wet ingredients.  It allows for some nice banana chunks in the muffins.  Definitely cut down on the cooking time in a convectional oven.  My three yearbold just finished his second muffin, they haven't even had time to cool off yet.  Will try all seven grain flour next time.

Great recipe.  The muffins were very light and tasty.  I don't even like bananna breads/muffins and just usually make them for my kids, but these are good.  My only change to the recipe was to add about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and I only baked them for 18 minutes.  Also I was able to get 23 muffins out of 1 recipe.  Today is the last day of school and once my kids got home and tasted them there are only about 10 left!

Delicious. Added walnuts to half of the batter, just because I prefer a cruch with my bananas. I also added a few shakes of nutmeg, roughly 1/2tsp. It's subtle, but definetly adds some "oomf"

The muffins were moist, and had plenty of "banana" flavour.

I love these - I almost always get the full yield.  I use the 6 tbls of milk, but add a tablespoon of vanilla extract, with 3-4 large bananas, and it works like a dream.  I've found that if you put them in tupperware while they're still warmish, they don't dry out.  They're so delicious and make the house smell divine.  Thank you Jo Jo, I make these all the time.

This is a great recipe!  I took others' suggestions: 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda, and 1 1/2 cups mashed banana.  I substituted whole wheat flour for these, as well as cholesterol-free, transfat-free Crisco, skim milk, and Egg Beaters.  I also added a walnut/ oatmeal streusel topping.  This is a perfect banana muffin for afternoon coffee!

I subbed applesauce for the margarine too (first time doing this), and they turned out great.  Added walnuts to half the batter.  Muffins were done in 22 minutes, so follow previous reviewers' advice and start checking before 20 minutes.

This recipe is delicious.  I used butter instead of margarine and I followed the instructions exactly, except that I checked them often for doneness and they were done in about 18 minutes.  Also, to keep them moist I did what my mother in law does with muffins: as soon as they come out of the oven, make a slit in the middle of each muffin with a small serrated knife and add a tablespoon of butter.  The butter will melt inside the muffin and it will taste delicious! Yummy!

The taste of these was very good, but they were pretty dry.  I tried again and added vanilla extract and more banana, but they were still a little dry.  I think I will try these again with a few alterations because they are simple.

I only had one banana and was looking for a recipe in which to use it. I cut this recipe in half and needed exactly one banana. I got 8 muffins out of the batter. I also added 1/2 cup of walnuts which made them really awesome. Would make these again!

Very very yummy, light, and moist. Great taste! Would make again in lieu of banana bread. I used 3 bananas (more than 1c.), 1 tsp vanilla, and added a pinch each extra cinnamon and nutmeg, and 1/3c. chopped walnuts. 6 at a time in my Convection Toaster Oven and they only needed 15 mins (probably due to size of oven).

The muffins were OK.  Very easy to make.  However, they were too plain.  I think they would have tasted better with some walnuts...and perhaps something like apple butter?  Nutmeg?

Great muffins.  Mine came out a tad spongey, but overall very good.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and a streussel on top...next time I think I'll try cream cheese frosting as they are really very much like mini banana breads.  Definitely a keeper.

These muffins are wonderful! Very moist and great right out of the oven, letting them cool for about 15-20 minutes.  I used about 4 medium sized bananas, and substituted 1/3 cup vegetable oil for the butter (because I realized I didn't have any!)  I think they are great!

These are FANTASTIC!  I always end up making banana bread when I buy bananas - they get overripe so fast.  I was sick of making bread and wanted to make banana muffins instead.  This recipe certainly fit the bill!  I used 3 ripe bananas and made 12 muffins - cooked them for the same amount of time and they were perfect.  Thanks for this keeper, Jo Jo!

These muffins are delicious! Very moist and tasty! I used liquid egg substitute instead of whole eggs and vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk and they turned out perfect! Even my picky roomates loved them!

I substituted 1 cup leftover mashed sweet potatoes for the banana in this recipe and they came out absolutely delicious. No need to adjust any of the other ingredients. Thanks for a great recipe!

These muffins are wonderful. They have just the right combination of moist crumb and lightness; they aren't spongy at all. The amount of cinnamon, IMHO, is perfect, just as Jo Jo says. I baked mini muffins for 25 minutes, regular size muffins for 30 minutes.

I added walnuts and sprinkled tops with Florida Crystals sugar, then baked in jumbo muffin pan (6 muffins) for 30 minutes.  Wonderful! Thanks, Jo Jo!

I used light butter and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter with excellent results.  The muffins (I used a 12 tin muffin pan)were moist, delicious, and so easy to make.  My husband and children ate them up.  Great recipe!

I loved this recipe and so did my husband!  I substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour and added in some dried cranberry's.  I also added in two tablespoons of wheat germ to give it a little more nutrients and fiber.  Lastly, I added an extra banana as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This muffin recipe turned out great!  I used butter instead of margarine and made mini muffins instead of regular ones.  They were great for my little ones to just pop into their mouths.  They turned out light not dense like many muffin recipes and great flavor.

These are nice muffins - not too sweet, with a good banana flavour.  I made mine with whole wheat flour, and added a bit more banana.  My husband has suggested that, next time, I add some mini chocolate chips - it sounds like a great idea to me!  Thanks for a good recipe that won't blow my diet!

I only made half the recipe since I will probably be the only one eating them. Used 1 1/2 ripe bananas. I only had baking powder so I just used more (about 2 tspns) to make up for the baking soda.  Baked at 330 degrees for non stick pan for 22 minutes. They turned out perfect.

Pretty bland, despite adding salt, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. It might have been altogether unappealing were it not for adding chocolate chips.

I didn't make a change in the recipe  except I sprinkled some coarse white sugar on top before baking. It gave it a nice crispy top. Another reviewer said the cinnamon was a bit over powering and I think she was right. They still tasted great. I think next time I'll use less cinnamon and add some nutmeg. I also might use a 1/2 cup more banana. I used a jumbo muffin tin and was able to make 6 muffins. They baked well and were moist.

I added  1/3 of the milk to the mashed bananas, making for a smooth texture. I added the other 2/3 when the recipe told me to. I cooked them for 23 minutes, then left them in the oven with the door open for about one and a half minutes, to keep them nice and warm without over cooking them. Then I topped them each with a 1/2 tsp of Nutella! It tasted amazing, served with a nice glass of milk, PERFECT!!!

This is our favorite go-to banana muffin recipe. I’ve been using it for years now. Many people misunderstand the amount of bananas. It calls for 1 CUP, not 1 banana. 1 cup is 2-3 bananas. If anything, I add 1tsp vanilla. Just don’t overcook and you’ll have delicious cake like banana muffins!

Followed exactly. Used three super ripe medium bananas. The banana taste wasn't to overpowering (which my kids like) Will use again when I need to use up those last few over ripe bananas. My batch made 12 muffins and 1 small loaf that I gave to a friend.

Great muffin!  They came out light, moist and flavorful.  I baked them for 22 minutes. I made half the  recipe and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and unsalted butter in place of margarine.  It made 9 regular sized muffins. I used paper baking cups in my tins and didn't have any problem with them sticking to the paper.   Thank you for the tasty and easy recipe!

I don't like taste and smell  of cooked banana. No matter how many different recipes I try. They always turn out very well but I just don't like it. I gave it 5 stars because the texture of these muffins is the best ever. It's so balanced, so delicate, so fluffy, so good! I will definitely make these again but with apples.

The man and I liked this recipe. Thank you for sharing.  I did exactly as the recipe calls for except substituting unsweetened applesauce for the margarine/butter.  The only issue I had was I used baking cups instead of greasing the pans and the muffins stuck to the papers. So might as well save cups and just grease the tins I guess lol.

Baked for 28 mins and the muffins were rather dry. Not a  major complaint and I actually like the fact that they turned out on the dry side. Will add nuts and/or chocolate chips next time.

I love this recipe,  so easy!  I did change it a bit by adding 1 tsp vanilla and using gluten free flour mix I have (I am gluten intolerant).. the girls at work couldn't believe that they were gluten free!

LOVE this recipe.  Children love it.   Everyone loves these muffins.  They come out perfect every time.  I cook them for 20-25 minutes.  And I use unsalted butter.  :)

Unexpectedly delicious! I used self-rising flour, half the sugar, butter instead of margarine and added pecans. Fluffiest most wonderful muffins ever.

My family loved this recipe.  With just a few changes like using half white and half whole wheat flour, two bananas instead of one , and a simple shake of nutmeg, the kids were smiling while eating, had to tell them to stop before they choke. LOL. I loved that the tops were a touch crunchy.  I also took the muffins out of the oven after 23 minutes.  They were perfect

I made these today but substitute the flour with wholemeal, sugar with Splenda and half the margarine with unsweetened applesauce. I even add some granola and oats. Oh, and some vanilla flavor too. 

Guess what? Not only they rise up nicely, taste delicious too! Best of all, i can eat them with  even less guilt hhaahha! Giving it 5 stars as even though i substitute the ingredients for healthier option, they turn out perfect for me. 
Definitely making these babies again. A must try recipe. Ty for sharing the recipe!

ps: forgot to mention, the whole house smells wonderful during baking siigghhhh....  :D

I used brown sugar instead of white and halved it (1 cup would have made them sickly sweet in my opinion). I also added a teaspoon of ground ginger and some toasted almonds. Mine took about 23 mins @ 350 and came out light and airy. Very yummy.

I made these using paper muffin cups and they stuck to the paper. Other than that they taste really good and smelled amazing while baking. I followed other reviewers advice and used yogurt in place of milk. I mashed Honey Strawberry Greek Yogurt in with the banana and cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup. Next time I will not use the paper cups.

Wow!  These are great.  I did alter the first 4 ingredients: 1/2 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup oats, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 bananas (because I wanted to use up the black bananas), and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesause in place of the margarine.  I also added a dash of nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla.   A few weeks ago, I made the Banana Muffins II recipe and gave it 3 stars because they were just so-so.  These muffins are way better.  I'm thinking of making them for my son's birthday snack at his preschool.

****** I just made them again using the above substitutions and only used 1/2 cup of sugar total: 1/4 brown and 1/2 white.  Totally fine. I only used 3 Tbs of milk and  I also forgot the vanilla and nutmeg.  I think I will no longer add nutmeg to the recipe, but the vanilla I would add.  The muffins are super moist to the point that they stick to your fingers.  I don't know if that's from reduced flour and not adjusting the liquids.  I think I'll only use 1 egg next time and see what happens.

These Muffins were good! Moist, YES! I might have greased my muffin tin a little too much though as they were a little chewy on the bottom half. I only baked mine for 20 min as everyone else had suggested and that was pleanty! I used 4 bananas and it was a sufficient enough banana taste. I will probably make them again :)

Definately a 10 star recipe! I used 2 very ripe (brown) bananas, cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup and added 1/2 cup craisins, 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 teaspoon Jamacian Allspice with the cinnamon.  Real butter instead of margarine. mixed eggs only slightly in to wet ingredients then slowly added dry ingredients.  Definately will make again!!

I was in search for a quick muffin recipe to make this morning for my parent's 35th wedding anniversary. I loved how I actually had all the ingredients for this recipe in my kitchen. The recipe was super easy to make. I cut the recipe in half to 9 servings, used 1 cup of mashed bananas instead of 1/2 cup, added some chopped walnuts, and a little bit of vanilla extract. They turned out so GREAT! They were moist and had amazing flavor for such a simple recipe. My parents loved it! Thanks for posting this recipe Jo Jo!

Tons of flavor, simple enough for the kids to help with and easily modified a bit.  I increased the bananas to 1.5 cups without any other changes and they were wonderfully moist and very tasty.

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could. This recipe is great! You can alter easily, just stick to the basics. The muffins turn out great! They were soft, moist, and wonderful! I added some walnuts, which gave it more flavor. You can also add raisins, dried berries, or any ingredient that you often find in muffins. I added extra bananas, some extra flour to make up for the extra bananas, and some extra baking soda and baking powder to make a bigger load. I didn't even measure or use the calculating option. I was having a feeling that it won't turn out good, but actually turned out great!

These muffins are great.  I did change a couple of things...1 1/2 cup of white flour and 2 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and used splenda instead of the sugar ( just to make it a little healthier.) My daughters loved them!

Wow!  I have tried several banana muffin receipes and so far this one is the ace! The hint on cinnamon is wonderful.  I also added pecans to it.

These muffins are delicious! My roommates loved them and left me lovely notes on our fridge telling me how awesome they are! I didn't have to bake them for as long as it called for tho. Probably only about 20-25 min.

Awesome muffins! I combined some reviewer suggestions and used 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups regular flour, and used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup strawberry jam. It made 12 muffins filled 3/4 full. I baked them for 17 minutes at 350. They are dense, flavorful and VERY moist!

These were wonderful and light!  I used half and half instead of milk (I had some that was expired), and I added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I was also afraid 1 tsp. of cinnamon might be too much, so I just sprinkled a little in the batter.  My family loved them!

These were great!  I used 2 bananas and substituted leftover vanilla pudding for the milk just to use it up.  I also added about 1/3 bag chocolate chips.  The recipe made about 20 muffins.  Delicious!

I made these today, but I was a little short on some key ingredients. I substituted low-fat yoghurt for the butter and I didn't have quite enough banana, so I measured the banana I did have into a cup (around 2/3 - 3/4 of a cup) and topped the cup off with passionfruit pulp. It was really good!

These muffins are sensational. They are so simple to make, too. Very few ingredients! 
I did change just a little bit, but it was mainly for preference, nothing extravagant. I did 1-1/2 c. of all-purpose flour and then 1/2 c. of whole wheat flour. I used butter instead of margarine. I did add a streusel topping. Flour, white sugar, and butter. I filled up the muffin cups to the top and they came out big and tasty! It made 11 muffins when I did that. I didn't even get a chance to take a picture, they were gone within 10 minutes!

This is a fabulous recipe! I didn't have any milk so I substituted vanilla yogurt, as well as I used butter instead of margarine. This was really yummy and will be the recipe of choice for the over ripe bananas in my house.

I made these muffins exactly as the recipe called-no modifications. They have a nice mild banana flavor. I used 2 med/lar. very ripe bananas (measured out to 1 cup.) I was concerned that they would taste strong of cinnamon because it smelled so strong cooking, but I can actually barely taste it. I only cooked the muffins for 25 minutes, but still, they were a tad over-cooked. My oven doesn't normally run hot, but cool, so I was surprised. Otherwise, I was very satisfied with this recipe.

These are amazing! I kinda ignored the part about only filling the muffin cups 2/3 full, and now I have gargantuan muffins. But they are sooooo good. It wasn't too complex of a recipe-25 minutes is plenty tho---

Going to give this 4 stars for now, I just popped these into the oven, if they come out tasting as good as the batter does, I will update and give them 5 stars! Super easy, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup white flour, all organic ingredients + 3 tablespoons flax seed meal. My 17 year old daughter couldn’t keep her finger out of the batter. Made 16 regular sized muffins... Probably would have made 18, but I think she ate a muffin worth of batter!

I thought these were delicious!  I also used the crumb topping from "Banana Crumb Muffin" recipe. It added a nice sort of crisp topping.  I only had to bake them for 15 minutes, but I think that is only because my muffin tins are smaller than the usual size.  Very, very tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

Instead of just one cup of bananas, I used 3 mashed bananas to make it more flavorful.

Otherwise, these muffins were excellent!  So much softer and fluffier than banana bread!

The texture of these muffins is heavenly and they fall right out of the pan without sticking. I used frozen bananas and the muffins were perfect.

I entered these muffins in a Banana Bake-Off at my fair and I got 3rd place over all the muffins.  Which is actually quite good.  They had very good flavor.  And now they are all gone.  They were a big hit with my family.

these muffins turned out great! these muffins were simple to make and they smelled wonderful while baking in the oven. i however modify this recipe. i used 3 bananas a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and added peanuts. i did not have any walnuts so i tried peanuts. they tasted  quite good. Also its best to check your muffins after 20 minutes. i used cupcake liners so it wouldn't be a mess. tip, if you want fuller muffins, fill the batter more than 2/3 of the cupcake liner, however, it will yield less muffins. Great recipe! i will definately use it again. my dad likes it too!

Made these up today and they are DELICIOUS!!!!!! I used three overripe bananas, one stick of melted butter, one tsp of vanilla and added 1/2 cup of cinnamon chips. Hubby loved these as much as I did. I can imagine that choc. chips would also be delicious! This recipe is a keeper! Oh, these were done in 20 minutes. Thanks!

Yum! I made these today for my grandchildren.  Cut the sugar in l/2 and sub. Splenda.  Did add some chocolate chips.  I only needed to bake mine 20 minutes.  Delicious -- they'll be a family favorite at my house!

yum!.
i used butter instead of margarine and added chocolate chips as well and a little bit more banana. very good. light and moist.
i only baked mine for 17 minutes and they were done. but i guess it all depends on the muffin pan and oven.

Excellent recipe. Like another reviewer I replaced the margarine with applesauce and I also replaced the flour with whole wheat flour and they came out perfect. Will make again and again.

Very tasty. I used applesauce instead of margarine. They came out denser than I thought, but a very nice texture. I threw some chocolate chips in half the batter for my sister, and those came out really nicely. I will definitely make these again, maybe with nuts next time.

This is an awesome recipe- I've made it four times, and people always rave about them.  I do add some mini chocolate chips in, as well as some extra mushed bananas.  Unlike most of the other reviewers, I had to cook mine for longer than the recommended time... I think this is because ovens in Japan are sort of wacky and not so good.  

Heaven in a muffin tin!

Very yummy!...not a bit dry... Although mine cooked in considerably less time than the recipe called for... approx 20 minutes... Maybe that's why the other's were dry.  I did get 18 good-sized muffins out of the batch!

I found these muffins to be a bit dry.  I added 1/2 cup additional banana and a streusel topping, even so, still dry and not too flavorful.  I'll probably try these one more time, to see if it was just a fluke, but give up if they stay the same.

This recipe is great. The muffins were very moist and delicious - almost like a cupcake. I halved the recipe and increased the banana to 3/4 cup (instead of 1/2 cup)and I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg although I didn't taste the nutmeg much.Mine were done baking at 20 minutes. I ended up with 12 muffins for the half recipe. I will definitely be making these again. Next time I will probably try adding a steusel topping before baking.

Since I live in Germany, I converted the recipe to metrics, also I used freshly ground spelt as flower and honey instead of sugar. They turned out perfect!!! All my family loves them! I´m verry happy with this recipe. Thank you very much!

Very good right out of the oven:  soft, strong banana cinnamon flavor, and tasty.  However, once they cool a bit, they become dry and are almost difficult to swallow.  Also, I would not cook for the called for 25 to 30 minutes...rather, I would cook less, around 21 minutes or so.  Check them at 20.  Tip of thumb:  1 cup of ripe banana equaled about 2 medium sized bananas.  Got 17 muffins.

I don't know how you can rate a recipe if you don't follow it.  I used the original exactly and it was great.  I cut it in half, which is very easy to do, because I only wanted 9. The muffins were light, "cake like", and delicious.  I did add some walnuts because I like some crunch in my muffins.  For my oven and altitude, the 19 minutes suggested by others was perfect.  I plan to use this recipe for a large neighborhood "Escape to the Islands" party this summer.

These were good, just not as good as others I have had.  The flavor was good with the cinnamon, but they could have been a little more moist for my preference.

Excellent Muffins!! For REALLY great muffins, add 1 box of instant pudding- whatever flavor you prefer.  Delicious with chocolate or banana flavor pudding.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

these have good flavor, they coulda been just a wee bit moister. I used splenda and it seems like everytime I use it my stuff comes out a little dryer. I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg.

I just made these tonight and they are delicious!  I used 2 bananas (and next time I'll use more), egg substitute, added a tsp of vanilla, and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour.  Very tasty!

This recipe is fantastic. My 4 year old son who is usually a very picky eater, ate 2 of them in a row and wanted more. I will for sure make again and again. Thank you Jo Jo.

This was a great recipe for "healthier" muffins.  I used a Tbsp. of vanilla and substituted half of the sugar with Splenda to reduce the calories.  They're even better the second day!

i'm very pleased with the way these muffins turned out. we made a vegan version by replacing eggs with kingsmill egg replacer and milk with vanilla soymilk, and then we added chocolate chips. the muffins taste great, but didn't rise very much - we ended up with tiny little muffins. that's probably our fault, though, because we made 23 muffins with the recipe for 18. we'll be using this recipe every time we want to make banana muffins.

This is a good recipe. Even my husband who does not like bananas thought they were delicious. I scaled it to make 24 muffins, and it yielded exactly 24. I added just a little more milk and bananas to make sure it was moist enough, and it turned out perfect.

Love this recipe.  I use only 2 Tbsp of butter or margerine instead of 1/2 c. and still get fabulous muffins.

Wonderful moist muffins!  I used three bananas, added chocolate chips, and added a sugar/flour/cinnamon/butter type crumb finish to the tops before baking.

Really easy and really yummy. Made this recipe several times and everybody loves them. Made them with chocolate chips as well on one occasion. Also made them for my vegan sister using vanilla soy milk and substituting the eggs with one more mashed banana and it turned out just as great!

My boyfriend loves muffins so I tried this recipe.  The muffins turned out moist, flavorful and easy! Cinnamon adds just the right kick without overwhelming the banana taste.  I used old bananas and tasted just fine to me!   Recipe is easy to follow but the love and time it takes to prepare comes through in the flavor and presentation.

This is a really good recipe for Banana Muffins. They have a good flavor and the whole kitchen smells of cinnamon while they are baking. I filled the muffin cups to make 12 instead of 18 and still cooked them for 25 minutes. Very moist and flavorful.
