This chicken came out beautifully!  I had to make a few modifications, by necessity.  First of all, the chicken I used was a bit smaller than the recipe called for, so I only used one lemon, which I cut into quarters.  I also put a small chunk of onion in the cavity as well.  The other modification I made was that the only white wine I had in the house was a plum wine, which was very sweet.  However, the chicken still came out wonderfully, and didn't taste overly fruity or sweet.  It was moist and didn't have an overpowering lemon, or garlic, or mustard flavor.  In fact, the skin didn't taste like mustard at all.  This is good news for anyone (like our family) who isn't too keen on Dijon mustard flavor.

While it was very tasty, I think the recipe should state a cooking time of at least 1-1/2 hours.  It took us 2 hours to get a 3.8 lb bird cooked because we took it out after 1 hr and had to put it back in.  After another 30 minutes it still wasn't done.  I'll either increase the temp or the cooking time next time.

I followed this recipe almost exactly which I rarely do and it turned out awesome!  I did make a salt/pepper/garlic powder mix and rubbed under and on the skin prior to the Dijon.  I had Trader Joes well known "two buck chuck" chardonnay on hand to use for the white wine.  My family loved it and I will make this again.

YUM, this was delicious! I did not have a cast iron skillet, so I just used my usual chicken baking dish. Also, I did not measure the dijon and in addition to the salt and pepper, I also seasoned it with garlic powder. This came out incredibly moist, juicy and flavorful. I will be making this often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Juicy, good flavor. I ALMOST left off the Dijon mustard, because it  just sounded WRONG, but I couldn't tell I'd used mustard, so glad I followed the recipe. Used CAST IRON skillet, uncovered, and I believe that's important to the recipe. Baked at 425 for 15 minutes, as stated, but only another 50 minutes at 350.   It's important to TAKE CHICKEN OUT OF FRIDGE & take the chill off the bird before you put it in the oven. It takes less time to cook. ****Update 4/5/12****Okay, after reading a question from a reviewer about wine in cast iron, I checked it out. Seems NOT good for the pan to use wine undiluted, because of acidity, so I will use 1/2 wine & half water or chicken broth tonight.

Not being a fan of wine, mustard or lemons, I was skeptical.  This turned out amazingly though!  The flavor was delicious and if I didn't already know, I would have been hard pressed to specifically name the combination that created it.  

I made gravy from the drippings and there was a lemon tartness to it, but that was delicious too.

Excellent chicken! I made a few minor changes just to make it a little more personal but WOW! Who would have thought that dijon mustard slathered on a lemon-garlic-white wine roast chicken would be so darn good! Thanks for the new favorite roast chicken recipe!

This so simple yet totally delicious!  The only slight variation I made was to season the bird with a little garlic in addition to the salt and pepper. YUM!!

Loved this chicken. I just added a bit of garlic salt under the breast but otherwise made it exactly as written. The juiciest baked chicken I have ever made. I also took the lemon halves from inside the chicken and squeezed them overtop the cut up pieces before I served it. My kids absolutely loved it.

This recipe gets 5 stars because it is so darn easy yet it tastes delicious. Plus the name is cute. AND it makes the kitchen smell delish while it is cooking!
If you like tweaking, though this recipe doesn't really need tweaking except  for a little more butter under the skin, read on.

After you wash the bird, dry it THOROUGHLY, including the cavity, and season the cavity with salt (or maybe garlic salt) and pepper. If you do not dry the bird well it will not brown as nicely as it should.

Consider adding any or all of the following to the cavity: quartered onion, celery, chopped apple and some fresh thyme sprigs. You can also put some thyme sprigs or some dried chopped thyme under the skin. I added some fresh parsley sprigs and a quartered onion to the wine in the pan. And, I put more butter under the skin than the recipe called for.

Cooking times will vary depending on the size of your bird. I suggest taking it out before it is completely done as it will continue to cook while it rests. About the only thing that will ruin this fabulous recipe is overcooking it and ending up with a dry bird.
Kudos to Chocolate for a fab recipe! It's a keeper.

This was a really tasty dish. I always hesitate to use mustard when cooking being afraid that it will be the only thing you'll taste. This was not the case at all. I added taragon to the butter and needed to add more wine to the pan. Make sure to make gravy from the drippings. Thank you for a great dish.

YUM! This was great and so easy. I've made it twice, the first time changing nothing other than to add some garlic powder. The second time I made it I had a bunch of thighs and drumsticks to use up so I dumped them in the bottom of a baking dish and arranged the garlic and lemon around them, removing the liquid for the last 15 minutes of bake time so they weren't soggy. 
My husband, son and myself all agreed that this is a keeper and will be made often.

This is just simply amazing.. I don't like garlic, or wine, but given the other good reviews, I had to tried it, and LOVED it.. The chicken is so tender and has no overpowering flavors.. its so good, and so easy to make.. I made some simple gravy on the side for the chicken with 1 cup chicken stock, 3 tablespoons of flour and 1 tablespoon of butter.. will definately be making many more times..

I made this and it was good, but we like orange chicken better than lemon.  I squeeze the juice of an orange in a bowl, add honey and thyme.  put squeezed orange halves and one onion cut up in the cavity.  Salt/Pepper chicken, Roast 375 degrees, last half hour pour orange juice mixture over chicken and baste til done.  Makes a great sauce and aroma throughout the house is amazing.

This is an excellent recipe. I followed the directions exactly.  My chicken browned very nicely and was delicious.  The slight change that I made was that I added raw carrots and onions in large chunks to the roasting pan. They also cooked while the chicken roasted. They turned out tender with the flavor of the pan juices.  Try this recipe; you won't be disappointed.  Your chicken will look like a real chef made it!

I always add about 10 stems of fresh thyme to the cavity as well.  Truss your chicken (tie the legs together and tuck under the wing tips towards the body) to get a more thorough cook.

easy and very moist. i used red wine because that is what i had. I also added more wine a few times throughout the cooking so the pan didn't dry out. After the Chicken was done I added some cornstarch/water to the pan juices and made some gravy that my family couldn't get enough of.

Very moist, very tender chicken. I only used bone-in breasts because we don't like dark meat and we remove the skin because we don't like that either. I just put the lemon, a little butter and garrlic cloves underneath the skin and the dijon on the skin. Next time I might put the mustard under the skin too, since a lot of that flavor was removed when I removed the skin. The flavor combo with the wine was good, though, so I'll make it again. I'm sure the leftovers will be good in chicken salad.

I found this recipe while abroad and having to make a dinner for 10!  It is fool-proof, delicious, and magically disappears!  I was even using a wonky propane oven and it was juicy and flavorful.  I served it with French pommes Anna (layered potatoes backed with butter, salt and pepper), a salad, and a delicious white wine! Thank you for this recipe!

I got this recipe off the Rachel Ray show and have made it many time. Everyone loves it! The drippings also make a delicious gravy!You really have to pay attention to the size of your chicken and adjust time acordingly. A 4 lb chicken should be cooked 15 minutes longer than it states in the recipe. I have had people want the recipe from me, so that says it's good right there!

This came out amazing so juicy. I did use a thermometer to determine rather it was done.  The cooking time was pretty close.  Keep in mind cooking time are always going to vary somewhat because of different ovens.  I made a mash of minced garlic and the butter and pushed it under the skin and rubbed the chicken with salt and pepper before the mustard.  I did not have a lemon so I used a large vidalia onion. I also did not have white wine so I used red and it came our perfect.

Okay, this is one those extremely RARE, hard to find, magical mystery recipes. First, let me just say, WE LOVED THIS!!! I thought it sounded somewhat simple... well, simple maybe, but most definitely OUTSTANDING! As other reviewers noted, I have no earthly idea where the mustard flavor went, except into an awesome gravy! But honestly, I didn't measure the mustard, but rather liberally rubbed it on and we were amazed that there wasn't a "mustardy" taste to this chicken. Just a truly moist chicken on the inside and a PERFECT crispy skin on the outsdie. As I mentioned already, the gravy was phenominal. Thank you SO much for sharing this happy chicken recipe. It has made us happy indeed!

This is one of the best roast chicken recipes ever.   We wanted to take a spoon to eat  the juice right out of the bottom of the pan.  Moist,  intense flavor, and easy.  What more could you want?

Really tender and tasty! I made a mix of salt, pepper, and garlic powder to rub under the skin (since I don't like eating chicken skin) and placed key limes and minced garlic in the cavity of the chicken. Final touch - bits of butter under the skin, and of course, set the whole thing in the cooking liquid. Finger-licking good!

Fabulous!!!! I made this tonight it was wonderfully flavored. Ijust over cooked it a tad bit, but the flavor is incredible!! I will be adding this to our monthly staple minus a few minutes cooking time! I added some extra lemon juice to the top of the chicken before putting on the dijon mustard. (I added extra mustard too) It is a definate must have dinner.

Chicken was OK, not any better than sprinkling it with chicken seasoning. I was NOT happy with the black mess it made of my white enamel roaster. Don't know if it was the wine or the dijon. Won't make again.

This was fantastic.  You have to have time to make it because its close to 2 hours from start to finish, but this was awesome.  My fairly picky kids ate it enthusiastically as did my husband-we'll make this many times over!

I need to try this one again.  I beleive though that putting the chicken into a preheated pan is important to get the initial sear which is nice on a  chicken to seal in juices.  I would alternate it that way and add the wine about a minute after the chicken has had a moment to sear in the pan in the oven.

My family loved this.  I appreciated having a different way to prepare roasted organic whole chicken.  I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I used my stainless steel skillet.  I also used minced garlic from a jar.  The preparation was so quick and easy and the results so impressive.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I'd give this 4.5 stars.  I love dijon mustard and I love white wine, so this made a lovely flavoring for a roast chicken.  It was a refreshing change from my standby olive oil and rosemary and it was packed with flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic and really easy. I did find the internal cooking temperature to be a bit high. I dropped it down to 165F and the chicken came out perfect. I also added some herbs. I put some lemon thyme under the skin and rosemary in the cavity.

Enjoyed this recipe as a first time WHOLE chicken cooker!! Very tasty and lots for lunch and dinner the next day for a two person household. Didn't have Dijon, so I used Honey BBQ sauce mixed with a little Worcestershire and it worked just fine. Of course with all recipes, I added more seasons like Garlic Salt, G. Powder and Oregano to taste. I added Carrots and potatoes the last 30 minutes of cooking. (picture number 6.) Will make again!!!

Deeeeelicious! The chicken was very moist. The only thing I had to change was the cook time. It took longer than the 1 and 15 min the recipe calls for.  I'm assuming it was because the cavity of the chicken was stuffed full of lemons, onions and garlic.

Great stuff but I didn't go by the recipe to the T.  I minced garlic and added it with the dijon and lemon juice - then rubbed it all over the chicken, after it had marinated for a few hours.  I also always roast my chicken at 425 for 1 hr and 10 minutes.  Makes it tender, juicy and skin is crispy!  Thanks for the happy chicken idea!!  Made my family very happy!

Made this last night for the fam.  Don't have a cast-iron skillet any more  (ordered a new one on Amazon last night!), so I used a dutch oven with the lid off.  Ended up going about 1.5 hours total.  Chicken was picked to the bone!  Family really enjoyed it.  Probably going to have to start making two...

Never ever will I buy the pre-made rotisserie chicken again! This was my 1st time roasting a whole chicken so I was nervous but it turned out WONDERFULLY tasty and juicy. I added some thyme springs into cavity along with some quartered onions. I used coarse dijon mustard for the rub. I will try to salt & pepper under the skin and in cavity next time. Cooking time was about 20 min longer for me and I broiled for a teeny tiny bit at the end. Skin was crisp and the chicken was falling off the bone. Recipe is a major keeper.

The chicken turned out moist and delicious.  I used chicken broth instead of wine.  The reviews were helpful also. There seems to be a differnce of opinion on the temperature and length of time. One reviewer said she always roasts her chicken at 425 degrees for an hour and ten miutes. The last half an hour I turned it up to 425 degrees. It sped up the cooking time and it had a golden skin. It looked and taste great.

THE CHICKEN THAT GOT AWAY
This recipe is delicious, my husband is still talking about it 6 hours later and there isn't any chicken left. One leg I had to hide for lunch tomorrow, I didn't use the white wine. In its place I just used chicken broth, but the lemons set it off and the gravy I made, made me BEST COOK. I love all recipes.com

Okay, if you do this right, it comes out GREAT! I don't give 5 star reviews to just anything. This recipe totally deserves it.

My roommates and I made this tonight following the recipe exactly, except we couldn't fit 2 whole lemons in there so I cut one into 4 pieces. Also, i spread the garlic (minced) around on the inside then put in the lemons. The only other thing we added was garlic powder to the skin but other than that nothing was changed.

It was so good. We didn't cover it with foil for the 15 minutes after cooking. It was juicy and perfect. I also don't like mustard but you can't even taste it. it took 1 hour after the temp change and came out cooked all through. We also didn't have a cast iron skillet but have a sort of shallow wok thing and used that.

So good and sooo worth the time it takes to cook.

I'm not sure how happy the chicken was, but we certainly were! This is the best chicken we've ever had. Even the white meat was tender and juicy enough for my in-laws to eat; but not mushy like boiled chicken tends to get.  
I was tempted to skip the lemons & just splash a little lemon juice in the cavity, but I'm soooo glad that I decided to follow the recipe exactly. It wasn't easy shoving 4 lemon halves into the bird, but it eventually made a perfect fit with just enough room for the garlic. 
I normally substitute Sprite or 7upcook for wine; but for the sake of a true test, I used wine. I'll never use pop again. The wine added a flavor dimension without adding sweetness.  
The Dijon mustard sounded like a very strange ingredient, but I honestly didn't taste it in the finished product. This recipe is a keeper.

Amazing roast chicken recipe.  I added a 2 cloves crushed garlic to the Dijon mustard.  Also had to add a bit more wine during the roasting.

This was fantastic.  Super moist with crunch skin.  Only used 1 large lemon (quartered) and added 1/2 of a medium onion.  Delicious.

This recipe was so simple and easy.   It was my first roast chicken... and it turned out great.  Next time I will definitely add more seasoning.   But this recipe gives you a very moist chicken!

This recipe was great.  I used yellow mustard, minced garlic, and a sweet red wine and the ending result was awesome.  Everyone in my family loved it!

i don't know what kind of 4lb chicken he used, but the 5lb chicken i had could only hold 1-1/2 lemons. that being said, i think 1/2 of a lemon would have been sufficient. make sure you don't season the bird until you apply the dijon, and make sure you season it almost to excess. i didn't have a cast iron skillet so i used my dutch oven (i adjusted my cooking time to let the bird brown more), mine came out of the oven a nice golden brown and was succulent.

I guess its time for me to rate this recipe since I've been making it for about a year now :) This was one of the first recipes I saved to my recipe box and was quickly added to a regular rotation. I've made this with several white wines and it consistently turns out great! One time I didn't have any white wine & used apple juice (sounds strange I know) and it STILL turned out moist and yummy. I no longer measure the ingredients, just stuff the bird with garlic and lemon (you can also through in whatever fresh herbs you may need to use up, I've used left over rosemary from another recipe) eyeball the wine and slather on the Dijon evenly and about two hours later (I usually do five pounders) it's coming out great. I don't even use cast iron. So simple. So good. You can do a lot with the leftovers as well! :)

Made this bird on a whim for a Monday night dinner. Bird was moist all the way through the breast was "falling off the bone" tender. I was concerned with that much lemon in one bird would over whelm the flavor but to my surprise gave a a light subtle taste. I used the left overs to make a chick soup stock for my lunch this week. should be a good carry over. Best roast chicken recipe I have ever used bar none.

This wash delish!  The only thing I did differently was I actually put it in the slow cooker.  I sat it on top of 4 bunched balls of aluminum foil and the chicken melted in my mouth after 8 hours.  We strained the drippings and added cornstarch for the best gravy ever!

Fantastic recipe - the chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside!  Just a note - I had to add about 10 minutes to the cook time for my 4 lb. chicken.

I generally follow the recipe as written, except if there is an ingredient we just don't like.  In this case it was so hot out  I cooked my chicken on the indoor rotisarrie with ingredients as listed except for the wine.  It was delicious and the left over chicken has a lovely light lemon aroma and flavour.  Perfert for a salad of left overs with a Polynesian twist.  Will definately make this again.  The chicken with the mustard wash did not taste of mustard and I may use a combo of mustard next time a grainy on and the Dijon.  The chicken turned out golden brown and looked as good as it tasted.  Recommend this recipe - you'll love it.

This is an easy, delicious recipe that we all love. Did have to adjust cooking time - added about 30 minutes or so. The skin comes out a wonderful golden brown and the flavor is divine. I am not a huge mustard fan so I was a bit skeptical, but the flavor was truly outstanding. The gravy had nice citrusy undertones. Have made it on several occasions, and it came out great each time.  I highly recommend this recipe - make sure to use a cast iron skillet if you have one.

Made this tonight and it not only looked beautiful, it was one of the juiciest, most delicious chickens I've had.  The skin was also super crispy and I didn't even have to broil it at the end like I usually do.

This was delicious and moist!  The mustard is a nice touch that doesn't taste mustardy at all!  I couldn't fit two whole lemons into the cavity of my 5 pound bird (there were no 3-4 pound birds to be had and there were only large lemons in my produce dept.), but didn't miss the extra... the hint of lemon still came through in a most delicious way!  Hubby loved it!

Great recipe!  Even my picky Daughter liked it.  But don't let the pan drippings go to waste! While the chicken was resting, I took the cast iron skillet and, skimmed off as much chicken fat as I could (Be careful - the skillet will be hot). I then added a package of baby green and yellow beans with carrots, a teaspoon of garlic powder with chive and a teaspoon of onion power and stir fried until the pan liquid was reduced.  Yummiful!!!  Thanks for sharing a terrific recipe Chocolate - I'll definately make it again.

Great recipe!  Followed almost exactly, had no dry white wine so used water with a splash of vinegar, worked out though cause end result was delish!  Dijon mustard on the skin is amazing, I don't even like mustard...well now I found something that makes it taste great!  Anyway, will definitely make again and will try with the dry white wine next time too.

Chicken came out somewhat tough and took a lot longer to cook than stated. It took probably 2 hours or so to get the proper 180 degree reading. I'm wondering if over stuffing it with lemons and garlic prohibited it from cooking faster. I think I'd rather put that stuff around the chicken next time. The other recipe I made on this site with butter basting the chicken came out much better.

Fabulous!!! My husband said he could have eaten the entire chicken!! We will definitely have this again. I did add about 20 minutes to the cook time (made it 1 hour 20 minutes) due to the size of the chicken to ensure it was done based off of the comments from other reviewers.

Happy Roast Chicken made my whole family happy! I like that it doesn’t call for very many ingredients and is very simple and quick to put together. I prepped it the evening before and wrapped it tightly with plastic wrap in the fridge. I did prepare it differently than instructed. I chose to spatchcock the chicken and roast it on a bed of carrots and Vidalia onions, which gave us more flavor and a tasty side dish to go with it. I think the amounts of garlic and Dijon called for were spot on. This recipe is a crowd-pleaser and full of flavor – perfect for a weeknight meal with some quick side dishes or a Sunday dinner with mashed potatoes and all the trimmings.

The taste of the chicken was good, the leftovers even better. Easy recipe, I used a baking dish instead of the skillet, turned out well.  I did not use the Dijon mustard as I was afraid of the taste it would give the chicken. Used the butter, salt and pepper. Very juicy chicken.

First, let me say this is the basic recipe that I will use for roast chicken from now on.  The dijon mustard was perfect as a coating, it crisped up nicely and gave the bird a very pungent taste.  The raw garlic inside the cavity though, in my opinion, was a mistake.  It gave the whole bird an aroma that was not pleasant at all.  It tasted great, but was just too much.  Maybe using minced, or granulated garlic would calm that down.  The iron skillet did well, though the back and sides of the bird's skin never crisped the way they should.  Next time, I will try this on a rack in a regular roasting pan, or maybe heat the skillet on the stovetop, and brown the underside of the chicken before I add the wine.  Thanks so much for sharing this delicious recipe.

I happened to have all the ingredients and needed a fast recipe that didn't require hours in slow cooker or lots of marinating time.  This was perfect.  Made as listed except i cut down the lemon to 1 and skipped the butter.  Didn't miss it.  was a little scared of the dijon mustard coating but when it was done you couldn't tell.  The crust on the chicken was delicious and the chicken was very moist.  we polishedi t all off.  this is my new go to roast chicken recipe.

Husband said it's the very best chicken I ever made.  And I've cooked many a chicken in 23 years.  Didn't have any lemon, so put about 3 tablespoons in the cavity.  SO moist!!

Hands down best roasted chicken I've ever made.  Pretty much followed recipe to the letter.  Made it for the first time a couple of months ago and will be making it again soon (just waiting for the 90 degree heat wave to end!)

Super yummy!!!!!   HOWEVER...a few suggestions or alterations - I had a 5.5 pound chicken instead of a 4 pounder, and I could barely fit 2 lemon halves and 5 cloves and garlic in the cavity.  
Also, I ended up cooking the chicken for about 2 hours after the initial 15 minutes.  Just make sure you check the temperature of the chicken with a thermometer as the recipe mentions. 
Once finished, chicken was VERY moist, and tasty.  The dijon mustard was not noticeable and I think added nice coloring to the outside of the chicken.

The cast iron pan is a must.  I've cooked several roast chicken dishes in aluminum pans and I always have to put them under the broiler to crisp up.  I didn't roast a whole chicken, just two bone-in chicken breasts.  I added small potatoes to the pan too and sprinkled with rosemary - turned out great!

I made this chicken once before and am making it again now as I write this. Up until the last time I was using a beer butt chicken recipe whenever I wanted roast chicken, which I really liked, but I decided to try this on a whim. My husband said it was the best roast chicken I had ever made and I really liked it, too. Considering that it's way easier than finagling a beer can up the rear end of a chicken and trying to prop to up on its legs, AND it tastes better.... well I probably will be making it this way from now on. It's not overly mustard-tasting, it's just right.

This chicken was fantastic! I'm always a tad leery of cooking a whole chicken, but I love rotisserie chickens from the deli and wanted to try and create my own at home. I used a glass dish to bake it in and I only used 1 and 1/2 lemons. My only flaw was when I salt and peppered the skin, I guess I used too much salt, making it too salty. Not sure if the dijon mustard had anything to do with it, or not. I also ended up baking it closer to 1 hr. and 30 minutes.  Loved this and will definitely make it again, I just won't use any salt!

I added garlic to outside and made in a ceramic lined DUTCH OVEN (no acid in cast iron)
The flavors are settle but the chicken is the juiciest I've ever made. Shared this recipe with coworkers

It was okay i added an extra lemon and 1 onion cut in half. I should have added more dijon to the skin. The best roast chicken i made was Ina the Barefoot Contessa recipe.

Yum! Never would have thought to roast a chicken in a cast iron pan, moist, juicy, flavorful and simple to make! Was worried that the dijon would dominate the seasoning, but not the case at all. Def will make again, weeknight and/or for friends and family who come to visit. Used a chardonnay that I had on hand, added some fresh rosemary to the cavity from the garden also... took suggestions and added a little water to the wine. delicious! Thank you for sharing! absolute winner!

Wow!!!! This chicken was so moist and tasty. My husband and son loved it. We are garlic lovers, so next time I will probably rub the skin with the garlic before putting it into the cavity. The Dijon gave a wonderful flavor boost. We will be doing this next time we have company for dinner.

We only had red wine, but it was really tasty. We used a Dutch oven with the lid off until it got a little too close to dark. It is very flavorful. Mustard seemed odd, but it works.

I make this quite often as my family really enjoys it.  My only change is I add fresh herbs (Italian parsley, basil and sage - all fresh from my garden) under the skin when I do the step with the butter being placed under the skin.  So yummy.

Made this for dinner tonight and I'm sorry to say I was not really impressed.  It was very tender and juicy but I have had better roasted chickens with more flavor.  Sorry, and I did follow the exact recipe.

Chicken was good, nothing special. Cook time is off quite a bit.  No real lemon or garlic flavour, the dijon ( I used grainy because that's all I had) gave the skin a nice flavour but that's about it.  When I asked my husband what he thought/how it tasted he said "it tastes like chicken" and shrugged.  This was not a good sign as he usually has lots to say about food.

This was the best!  I could only fit one lemon, so i was glad i didn't cut both in advance.  I add some whole carrots, cut in half lengthwise and some onion to the white wine.  Didn't have a cast iron pan and used a regular baking dish.  One of the best recipes I've tried on this site.  Thanks, it's a keeper.

This chicken turned out great!  Husband a
nd son loved it.  I added a little more wine about 1/2 through cooking to keep it moist.  I took others' suggestion and cooked it about 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 hours (4# bird). Added some of my own seasonings to it(sprinkled them on bird pre-cook) but pretty much followed recipe exactly. Mustard flavor was just right..

This was wonderful!  The chicken came out tender and juicy!  I did cook it longer than the recipe called for, but that's what a meat thermometer is for, so I have no problem with that.  Im thinking about using this for my next turkey!

The first time I tried this recipe I was babysitting our 4 and 7 year-old grandchildren. It was a huge hit. Very moist, fall of the bone tender and enjoyed by all. My husband was surprised with the lemons when he carved the bird, but you could not taste the lemons at all. I used a spice rub on the chicken instead of just salt and pepper and it was awesome.

Excellent roast chicken recipe. Even hubby liked it & he doesn't normally like roast chicken. Company raved about too. Instead of dijon (didn't have any) I sprinkled poultry seasoning all over outside of chicken. So good!  Anyway, I bought dijon mustard & will try it tonight.

Was looking for an easy way to roast a chicken and this was it! The chicken was nicely browned on the outside and juicy on the inside. Omitted the mustard because our kids wouldn't like it, but added rosemary and with the butter the result was a hit. Will be making this again!

....ooops....it posted before I finished my comment! This turned out absolutely fabulous....very savoury, great sauce from the pan drippings, just cooked it longer at 325 after the initial high temp. I made it in my go to Emile Henry flame top Brazier...it’s great for almost anything, and goes from stove top to oven, to the table. If you watch the video, the “cast iron” pan used is likely a Le creuset product, which has a black enamel coating on the cooking surface, and is cast iron underneath that. When adding an acidic ingredient, like wine, never use it with “naked” cast iron, as it affects the seasoning of the pan, and the flavour of your food. I think the instructions should have mentioned this. In any case, an amazing roast chicken, and so very easy!

Wife and I thought it was the best baked chicken yet! I made it like the recipe, but really didn't measure things; for example, I think I used two Tablespoons of butter (3x the recipe)! Sliced each Tablespoon into 3 patties that I push up under the breast skin, and it came out perfect. Also used spicy brown mustard, which I didn't measure either (Publix equivalent of Dejon?)... Really delicious!

We made this exactly as it was described and it was great. The chicken was moist and tender. The only thing, as most reviews mentioned was it needed another 15mins or so to reach the required internal temperature. We will make it again.

Followed the directions to the T and the reviews by adding garlic powder and this was best chicken I ever made.  Kids kept coming back for more.  Will def keep this one.  Very juicy and flavorful. Oh yeah....had to use minced garlic.

I was skeptical with the mustard on chicken, but made this more than once, and it came out awesome!  Going to try and use chicken pieces today, but know the roasting chicken was the best one to use.  Came out juicy, kitchen smelled great, and it was definitely a great recipie.  I used more wine however as during cooking, it can evaporate, other than that, you have to try this if you love juicy chicken!!  You won't be disappointed.

This is an excellent recipe as written. I have made this quite a few times now, as written as well as with my own modifications  (sometimes you just want to change things up).  If a cast iron skillet isn't available, I use a shallow rimmed corning ware dish with some finely sliced onion in the bottom of the pan before adding the wine and chicken.  I salt and pepper the inside of the bird and use garlic infused butter under the skin. If organic chicken isn't being used, I do a quick salt brine first (submerse the whole chicken in cold water with 1/2 cup dissolved table salt for about 45 mins). Helps the chicken cook more evenly and draws out the 'ick' you can get from grocery store chickens.

It was absolutely delish! I made a few changes since I was limited in supplies.  I used red wine instead of white, and lime instead of lemon.  I also lightly pre-seasoned my 7lb bird before adding the listed ingredients.  I added thyme sticks and onion to the inner cavity of my bird.  Additionally, I didn't have Dijon mustard so I used Jack Daniel's spicy mustard.  I had a nice crust on the outside and this is the first time having a whole baked chicken with so much flavor. Thanks for this recipe!!

Very good chicken.  Used a cast iron skillet and a Bell and Evans organic chicken.  Added very small potatoes to the skillet part way through cooking and made gravy with the skillet drippings while the chicken rested on the cutting borard.  Delicious.

YUM!!!! This chicken was bursting with flavor and so moist! I didn't have a oven-proof skillet so I just made it a metal pan. Like others, I squeezed the lemon juice over the chicken before flavoring. I also seasoned first (and used garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper) and then rubbed on the mustard. In addition to the lemons and garlic, I tucked a quartered onion into the chicken. It was so delicious, next time I'll use two. My family doesn't like mustard, but none of them tasted it. The little ones did find the chicken too tart, but the rest of the fam loved it!

this was great! Followed directions to the letter. Lemon, garlic and butter definitely make for a happy chicken! I find that whole roasted chicken doesnt need a lot of seasoning or spices, this was just fine the way it is. Loved it. Turns out great every time!!!

This is definitely the best roast chicken recipe ever! 

I'm a professional Cook, not Chef, but I believe quite good at my job and I regularly roast chicken- at least twice a week, but this is by far the best I've ever done. I used thighs and simply made a paste with all the ingredients to include onion and garlic powder, no wine or any other liquid. I coated the room temperature thighs in the paste and roasted in a pan. Gorgeous aroma, melt in your mouth meat and simply fell off the bones. There was no leftover even though I made too much. I only managed to finagle one tiny piece for myself. Well done to the creator of this.

Absolutely wonderful. I mixed some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and the dijon together instead of putting the mustard and seasoning on separately. Despite smelling VERY mustardy at the beginning, by the time it was done you cuold barely taste the dijon. 
The cooking time seemed to be a bit off though. It took me nearly two hours to cook at 3.8 lb chicken. It was moist and delicious when it was done though. Worth the wait.

I had a chicken cut in half - which was perfect for the cast iron skillet. That meant I had to just add lemon (juice) and garlic to the wine. Husband said it was wonderful. I did baste it about mid-way through. Used the white zinfandel I had on hand.  Would make again.!

It was okay but didnt have a lot of flavor besides lemon.  Next time I would definately add more seasonings to add some more flavor to it!

I made this tonight with a 6 lb chicken, and it was so moist! I followed all the instructions, except increased the wine, butter, and Dijon, and only used half a lemon, since it was all I had. Yummy and very fast prep! My answer to rotisserie
chicken. Used the cast iron skillet, too. Not worried about the acid of the wine, as the juices from the chicken and the evaporation would take care of it, I think. I did preheat the skillet. We used the broth over potatoes. Doesn't need any extra salt with the Dijon. A keeper!

So easy and tasty. We added a bed of diced potatoes, onions, garlic, butter and parsley under the bird when we switched it to 350 degrees. It made it a one-dish meal.

It was really tasty and easy to make. It turned out really juicy. I would make this again for sure.

Wow! Very nice, moist chicken! I used 2 Tbls butter under skin, added 2 fresh sprigs of rosemary under the skin with the butter as well as one in the cavity (I love rosemary) and after rubbing with dijon I drizzled a bit of my 25yr balsamic on top... So Yummy!! Very great recipe!

I love roast chicken and have a few recipes that I default to. I am so glad I tried this one, as it was so easy and so good! The first time I cooked it I followed the recipe exactly and was blown away. I just realized (we had it last night) that I forgot the wine this second time! Oops. Didn't change the flavor at all. 

Both times I made a simple gravy with the drippings, flour, milk, s&p, and a dash of cayenne. Yum!

I love this chicken... the only difference I did was to add a dash or two or ground red cayenne pepper to the skin before baking ...

I was VERY pleased with how this bird turned out!  And will use this recipe as my "go to" recipe instead of "go to" Kroger and get one already roasted.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I'd like more seasoned flavor than it already has...will experiment with different fresh herbs in the future.  Oh, and because I didn't get any wine (I don't like dry wines)...I used a dark beer instead.

Wonderful chicken!  I did change the wine to wine vinegar (my husband cannot have alcohol with his medication).  It came out lovely.  Even my daughter who is a very picker eater (she is 8), asked for seconds.  Made it twice since and its great!

I'm not a big roast chicken fan but this was easy and had a great taste. I will make again. The only thing I added was some scallots.

Fantastic.  The breast meat was very juicy.   And the flavor was delicate, not over powering.

This was wonderful and so easy. Wife was totally impressed. Poured drippings over left over chicken for future meal. Might try cut up chicken over noodles with dripping sauce.

This is the juiciest chicken I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but thought it lacked flavor a bit.  I was surprised because of all of the rave reviews. I will use this recipe as a base and add more seasonings or stuff with fresh herbs to make the chicken more flavorful.  Thank you for the recipe.
