I tried this recipe when I was in a pinch and I forgot I was supposed to bring brownies to the local soup kitchen! We eat gluten free at home and I don't keep flour in the house, so I was thankful to find this recipe. I also didn't have brown sugar, so I used agave nectar as a substitute. I will say that I didn't actually try these, but they looked fantastic and the pan was gone immediately, and I didn't see a single person bring theirs back uneaten (which actually happens fairly frequently with our guests there)! The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that I didn't actually taste them. :)

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I am facing the same challenge with my little son who is allergic to dairy, eggs, and wheat. I have tried a few cake mixes for vegan, gluten free brownies, but they were not really to my satisfaction. These brownies are so easy and quick to make and very tasty. I might try adding some real chocolate next time as the very dark chocolate usually is vegan, too. Will definitely make these over and over again!

I made these today and they were AMZING! I was babysitting for a some gluten free and dairy free kids, so I'm not used to that kind of food, but when we made this recipe it turned out more wonderful than I'd ever expected gluten and dairy free to be! Definitely recommend, especially with chocolate chips!

These were a real hit at Thanksgiving. I had to make them on the fly when I remembered we didnâ€™t have any desserts for my egg-allergic niece. Everyone liked them; even the gluten eating, egg and dairy consuming crowd. I used extra dark chocolate and they came out pitch black. They remained a bit chewy and gooey but crispy outside. A definite winner and super easy to whip up. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this recipe using stevia for the white sugar and agave syrup for the brown sugar and sold them at the church bake sale. They were a huge hit!!!

First time for me making GF brownies! This was a pretty good recipe for brownies that are gluten free, dairy free, and egg free! Bake time was perfect in this recipe too. End result was a tad dry, but still moist, yet not a fudge brownie. I used superfine white rice flour as that's what I had on hand and it worked well (couldn't find All Purpose Rice Flour at the store). I used unsweetened coconut flakes and when tasting the batter was surprised I didn't notice the coconut flavor too much. When finished baking, I didn't care for the coconut as it seemed to make the dryness more noticeable. Topped the brownies with Fresh Raspberry Sauce (from this site). Overall good recipe for a brownie and I'd like to try again, without the coconut flakes and a little more applesauce perhaps. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very strange consistency, even stranger taste. Steer clear!

I was searching for a good dessert to serve at a party with a few people with gluten and dairy allergies. I had no idea what I was doing, just trusting the recipe. It was waaaay too dry, and had the consistency of play dough. No one even tried them :( maybe adding more coconut milk, oil, or applesauce than the recipe gave would have improved it, but I was very disappointed

These coconut brownies were amazing. I am a teen with celiac disease as well as an egg allergy and a dairy sensitivity. These brownies were simply delicious. I couldn't ask for a better brownie recipe. I will definitely make these brownies again! Thank you for the inspiration!

Delicious and moist. Ate them while still warm.  Only change to recipe was to add 3/4 cup chopped walnuts also.

I made this just as the  recipe called for and the brownies are great! They didn't even stick to the pan so I was able to flip them right out. Cut them with a plastic knife and they won't stick to the knife. I drizzled a little melted dairy free chocolate too.

Maybe it was my choice of All Purpose Flour but the brownie batter came out so dry that I had to use 1/4 cup extra applesauce and coconut milk.  Also, the texture was not cake like but dense and chewy...not moist and gooey.  My son also felt that it gave him a sugar rush.  Not a fan.

This is a great tasting gluten free, dairy free recipe. The brownies come out cake-like and light. I think this recipe could qualify as a dense cake recipe though.
