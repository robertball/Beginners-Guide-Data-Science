This is one of the best recipes I have ever made...and I cook 6 nights a week.  I can't stress how perfect it is to any reader, but truly I never follow a recipe 100% and I made NO changes to this one.  I even measured most things (which I never do) and it was PERFECT.  I added extra crushed red pepper because we like spice and the recipe calls for just enough for one to taste the flavor of the red pepper, but not enough for a kick.  I would recommend using unsalted butter at the end, since the capers and the olives provide plenty of salt to the recipe.  I also added whatever fresh veggies I had in my garden.  Thank you for this perfect recipe.  I have not found a better recipe on this site.

My first instinct after reading through the recipe was that this seemed like a heck of a lot of sauce for just a few filets--it was. Half the amount would have been more than enough. I stuck to the recipe exactly, and hubby and I were both very pleased. The simmering brings all the flavors together nicely. I actually liked the sauce better than the fish (I did use sea bass), as I didn't particularly care for the filets poached. Were I to make this again I would pan roast the filets--I missed that beautiful golden color and semi-crispy exterior. I served this over a bed of Saffron Rice,accompanied with Cuban Black Beans I and Jicama Salad with Cilantro and Lime, all recipes from this site. A pretty, delicious and interesting Cuban style dinner!

This recipe was great!  I used tilapia instead of sea bass and I omitted the olives and doubled the garlic and it was wonderful.

This dish belongs on the menu at America's (very nice resturaunt here in Houston). Sea bass is expensive, but I can't imagine this dish being as good with any other fish. Follow this recipe as written, and you will be overwhelmingly happy with it. I didn't have wine, so I substituted vermouth, but no doubt it is just as good if not better with the wine. I served with white rice, black beans, and fried plantains - cuban style! This is one of, if not the best, recipes I have ever made. I can't wait to show off with it. :) Thank you so much for sharing.

We all enjoyed this recipe.  I used trout and canned tomatoes because that's what I had on hand, skipped the capers (don't like them) but otherwise held to the recipe.  It was really nice and the kids loved the olives.

thank you! thank you! thank you!  this has to be the best recipe i have made yet from this website.  i knew it would be good because i liked all of the ingredients...buti didn't realize how easy, quick and delicious it would be!  i made this last night for a small dinner party and it was a HUGE hit.  the only changes i made were to substitute chicken broth for the wine, and used vine ripened tomatoes instead of roma.  otherwise, i followed the recipe as is.  i served it with cous cous and a salad, and was a weeknight gourmet!  every dish was wiped clean, and everyone raved about this.  i can't wait until chilean sea bass goes on sale again!

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make.  I just added a few extra red pepper flakes to make it a little spicier.  The next time I am looking for a recipe to make for company, I know where to go!

It was a nice, simple and healthy dish - what more could you ask for! Also chilean sea bass being one of my favorite fish, I couldn't resist trying it;) Made some changes: used olive oil instead of butter, kalamata olives instead of green ones, unseeded grape tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, omitted wine, garlic and cilantro. That's what I had on hand. Thanks a bunch for the recipe!

Made this again using sea bass, and it's awesome!  Everyone loved it, even my 10 month little one.  It's really the best sea bass recipe!  Didn't change a thing.

how to get a fish eater to eat fish!!!! My trick? I made the same amount of vegetables for 2 as the recipe called  for for four people.  W/ the mild flavor of the fish and all those olives etc. he loved it.  Oh yeah,  I left out the butter and we never missed the fat!

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight scaling it back for one.
The only changes that I made was omitting the olives (did't have any) and replacing the butter with laughing cow light (1 wedge). I also added frozen peas at the end because I had some to use up. All I can say is "Wow" this was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. It would be great with rice but I had it with roasted sliced potato and it was fantastic. Definitely a keeper. Thank you Kiki.

This was really quite good! I used grouper in place of sea bass as that is what I had on hand, and it turned out just fine. I imagine you could use just about any type of fish you like and get great results. I increased the red pepper because we like things spicy, but other than that, I followed it exactly and it was very tasty indeed! Thanks for posting this one; I will be making it again and again!

WONDERFUL!  Yummy sauce!  My husband suggested that we try doing pork chops this way, simmering them longer.  This is definately a KEEPER!
Thanks so much!!

Absolutely delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I did NOT seed the tomatoes and used extra red pepper for spice.  Served over "Quinoa with Black Beans" (minus the corn) and it was a delightful combination.

Top drawer, flavors of the Carribean! ! Easy too! Love the flavor of the sauce. In fact the sauce alone would go well over rice, noodles etc. We used Tulopia. Very adaptable. We fixed this according to the recipe and it was fantastic. Thanks :-)

this is a light and tasty dish; great for people who don't mind not having to work too hard to prepare dinner... bought iqf bass (imported from vietnam) and they were delicious!  deleted cilantro because nobody likes it here and always plop extra capers on my fish.  will definately make over and over - thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This is a good recipe. I'm not sure why it's referred to as "Cuban Style". The recipe is a classic Italian treatment of any white fish. For those who haven't the acquired taste for capers they are easily left out but the olives and cilantro are definitely an important part of the flavour.

This recipe is just right.  Served with rice to soak up the sauce.  We're going to try it with shrimp next time. Husband made this for me. I'm not a fish eater but love this.

Excellent
Could be served to company
A touch more red pepper flakes and maybe fry the fish first then make the sauce to pour over.

Great recipe and easy to follow directions.  Did make a few minor changes due to personal pref...  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Added only a few sprigs of finely chopped cilantro and added a splash of lime juice at the end.  This recipe was delish!

This recipe is nothing short of fabulous, ESPECIALLY when using sea bass.  I've made it with cod as well, and it was still very good, but the sea bass really seems to pick up the flavor so nicely.  I just made a few changes, based on my taste, so I omitted the onions and added some artichoke hearts (not marinated) and some roasted red peppers from the jar.  I also added some extra red pepper flakes - I like things spicy - and it was absolutely amazing!

Excellent recipe.  I have made twice in past week!  I pan roasted the bass rather than poaching in the sauce.  Also, I had a can of fire-roasted tomatoes on hand, so I used those and didn't add the green olives until last minute to promote a brighter color/flavor. Served over bed of fresh, steamed spinach.  Thanks so much for the recipe....it will be a regular dinner menu item!

This is heaven!  My sauce was a bit too liquid because I used canned tomatoes from our garden, so I just put some pasta shells in the sauce to soak up the extra.  Worked great.

We loved this dish. I used Mahi Mahi. I halved the Sauce cause I knew the kids would only eat the steamed /poached fish. I served it with black beans and rice from the site.

Absolutely delcious and easy to follow recipe.  I'd never worked with sea bass before, and it is a dense fish.  I was worried I over cooked it, but it came out great.  Used ghee instead of butter because of a lack of unsalted butter.  Do use something unsalted, however, because the capers do all of that work.  Delicious and easy.  I live in a little apartment and we ate such a fancy meal off of plastic plates... Compliments to the recipe, though!

I made this with tilapia filets because Sea Bass is expensive!  It tasted great but alas my kids are no much for fish dishes unless it is fried.  I think the next time I will try it with boneless chick brests instead.  Love the flavor or the sauce over rice.

I used tilapia because they didn't have sea bass but what delicious taste.  I have made it twice and both times everyone raved about it. The red pepper flakes add the right amount of spice.

I scored some fabulously fresh halibut at the farmer's market yesterday, so I made this recipe using halibut. It was superb!  I found I had no green olives, so I used nicoise olives, and they worked quite well.  Unsalted butter bound the sauce very nicely.  Fresh corn on the cob and sauteed swiss chard rounded out the meal.  This recipe was quick to put together and good enough to serve guests.

I was sceptic when I tasted it before letting is simmer as the wine was really strong.  BUT....I was wrong.  Letting it all simmer down and then adding the butter made this delicious.  My hubby was licking his plate.  I doubled the sauce and used canned diced tomatoes.  Totally forgot about the adding the herb at the end....I cant even remember which one it was but I didn't miss it a bit.  I highly encourage giving this a try!  yummy!

It was very good! I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used canned stewed tomatoes. Also, Goya has green olives with pimentos and capers - so I just used that - was very easy.

I used cod because we live in small town AZ and can't get sea bass. My husband who is highly critical of my cooking actually had high praises for this one - said he felt it was something he could only get in a fine restaurant. I thought is was quite good too.

I was looking for a recipe for a light dinner with fish.  This one is super!  I used Tilapia instead of the Sea Bass.  I purchased two fillets for each of us.  I didn't have any pepper flakes so I sprinkled in some cayenne pepper and that gave it some zing!  I'm keeping this recipe!

I loved this recipe! Don't like green olives so I used black. Didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used canned diced tomatoes with Jalapenos(drained). I am the only person that eats fish in my family so I am always trying to find simple, healthy fish recipes to enjoy. Thank you!!

This was so good! I made 2 1/2 substitutions in this recipe...first, I could not find sea bass anywhere in this town, so I used rockfish, second, I couldn't find my red pepper flakes anywhere, either, so I used a pinch of cayenne! The 1/2 substitution was in the form of using a shallot in place of an onion...they are in the same ballpark, so it only counts as a half! Delicious recipe and I will make this again!

Very nice! But the caper flavor was a tad bit strong. I omitted the olives since my boyfriend absolutely hates them, and I added crimini mushrooms. I'll cut down on the amount of tomatoes next time though.

This is a really tasty and also simple recipe. It also reminds me of Fish "Veracruzano" style from the Mexican Atlantic coast.
I decided to test it before I make it for Thanksgiving and I have to say I'm sure to keep making it!

A Wonderful Recipe! I don't even like to cook fish at home but this was worth it. I bought Striper at Trader Joes and used that. It's a great fish- not too stinky! Will make it again for company!

I used 5 Roma tomatoes chopped, and 3/4 cup of white grape juice instead of the white wine.  Also used 1/2 cup of chopped black olives and 1/2 cup of the green stuffed olives which I did not slice. and 2 tablespoons of the capers instead of 1/4 cup. Also added some shrimp.  Was awesome! This recipe is soooo good!

I served this recipe to guests...first try and it was terrific.  I did use sea bass, but any other mild, white fish filets will work well.  Just be sure not to overcook the fish...and it is easy to do. Everyone raved.

Loved this! Definitely worth using Sea Bass. Great flavor; served with crusty bread fora hearty meal. Might cut back on the green olives next time only because my kid isn't crazy about them. I'll make this again for sure!

This was very easy to make and had great flavors. If you have a garden with fresh vegetables and herbs, it makes it even better. A beautiful dish for company.

I used chilean sea bass.  I also used canned diced tomatoes, which cut down on the prep time.  Very tasty and healthy recipe.  Hubby loved it! Thanks for sharing!

This dish is so amazing. You will feel like a gourmet chef when you eat this. I have made it several times - not once with sea bass, mind you, since I can't find it around here - but it doesn't matter - I've used red snapper and grouper, and it comes out fabulous each time. It's terrific with whole wheat couscous or brown rice pilaf and green beans. Thanks for a simply amazing recipe!

Great one-skillet recipe. Couldn't get sea bass but substituted black cod which has very similiar taste and texture. I used chopped grape tomatoes instead of Roma (less seeds and far better flavor this time of year).  Served with Rice-a-roni Spanish rice which really is quite good (hey, take help where you can get it).  Dinner was on the table in 25 minutes start-to-finish.  Family loved it!

Seriously yum.  I used halibut instead of sea bass, and served it with couscous made with broth and some sauteed onion and red pepper.  Everyone was spooning the extra marinade/sauce over the couscous--it was really tasty.  I might even try it with tilapia for a cheaper meal, when not entertaining.

Simple to make--very fast preparation, the ingrediants were common household items and easy to prepare.  My wife raved about my "gourmet" fish....used red wine as I didn't have white on hand...still delicious.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I have cooked this twice in the last 10 days....the flavours were amazing. It was easy to prepare and so enjoyable to eat. Light and refreshing, making it perfect for the warm nights of summer.

The second time I cooked it, I replaced the fish with chicken breast fillets. I cooked them for about the same time perhaps a few minutes more, and they remained moist and flavourful.

Try adding a little cilantro at the end of the thickening process and when serving to add that little extra flavour.

Highly recommend trying it....loved it!

Fantastic dish.  I doubled the sauce and used the leftover for pasta two days later, and it tasted even better after the flavors had a chance to deepen.

This was amazing! I thought all the ingredients sounded kind of odd, but my husband caught an excess of bass on a fishing trip so I decided to try it.  It was so delicious!!! The sauce was amazing!  I had a lot of sauce left over so I tossed it with some pasta the next day and it was delicious!  Excellent recipe, easy, delicious and fast!

I used striped bass. I also substituted 1 can of stewed tomatoes for the plum tomatoes.  All long time fish eaters we agreed the BEST recipe for bass.

This dish is very tasty and the flavors blended very well. I used tilapia instead of sea bass but it still tastes very good. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, next time I do this I will cut it down to 1 can only and will add salt to cut down the sour taste of it. I used chicken broth instead of the white wine. I didn't put cilantro because I don't have it. All in all, this recipe is delish! I will definitely cook this again. Thank you Kiki!

This recipe was the norm'/usual and, a family favorite growing up in my home. My Mom was an expert cook and, taught us all (3 boys) how to cook, clean and sew. I was the best at cooking hands down and this is my version of a complete 'Sea Bass Cuban Style Meal, as taught to me by my Mom!

This was good.  I altered it a bit to suit my cupboards.  I do not often have green olives or capers.  I used black sliced olives and frozen grilled onions and fresh garlic, 2 whole tomatoes chunked up.  I also used lemon pepper.  I put it all into my pot with the lid for 30 minutes on medium heat.  It was very tasty!  Served it with a side of buttered corn.

This is one of the very first times that I followed a recipe from this site exactly, and it was beautiful. My only modification was that I used a striped bass, not a sea bass. And I cannot wait for my brother to go fishing again so he can bring me back some more fish!!

This was an excellent, easy dish.  Butter mixed in with the sauce sealed the deal, all poured on top of a bed of brown rice brought all the rich nutty flavor together.  I didn't have capers or green olives, so used kalamata olives and red onions instead, and threw in some seasonal yellow squash.  Delicious recipe! Thank you!

Not sure what went wrong here but I found this dish to be really bland. Maybe there was too much liquid. I only had 1/4 cup of sliced olives on hand and 1/4 of capers but there was not enough salt in those ingredients to flavor the sauce. i think maybe next time I will season and saute fish first and then add sauce over it.

This is an incredible and healthy recipe AS IS. Only individual taste warrants any changes. More heat..more pepper flakes. More briny...more olives or capers. More depth...more wine. It is too easy! This goes wonderfully with homemade saffron rice (not the sodium-laden prepackaged stuff).

Loved everything about this. I subbed in stewed tomatoes for fresh, used extra pepper flakes, forgot the wine and butter, and used Goya's Alcaparrado (which is capers & olives in one).   At the end of it all the cilantro definitely brought things together.   My boyfriend ate it for dinner, lunch, and dinner again. He insists I make it again and again....

It was just OK, I probably will make again. I used Talapia instead of sea bass because none was availabe here. Maybe that had an effect on the outcome.

Very yummy, very easy, very fast..the only thing is I had to add alot of salt to my liking. Taste sauce before adding fish, and salt fish before adding to sauce. My family loved it!!

This was a great recipe!  I held to the recipe except that I baked the fish (broiling for the last few minutes for a crispy golden exterior) added black beans, used extra red pepper flakes and cilantro and served over a bed of jasmine rice.  It was great!  We served it to company and they asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Absolutely amazing.  I cooked this for my sister and bro in law.  My bro in law kept thinking I had something bad to tell them because the meal was soooo good!

This was much better than I thought it would be. Lots of flavor.  The one change was I used chicken broth instead of white wine.

Used fresh Rock Cod and it was really good. The only real alteration was to lightly coat in (sifted) flour and par fry first.  I didn't have any fresh cilantro so used "fresh" paste.  It was very flavorful dish.  Thank you for new fish idea.

Sper easy and very satisifying. Srong, spicy flavors really compliment such a lightly flavored fish.

The sauce was amazing. I added a bit extra pepper flakes and substituted 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar for the white wine.  I think next time I may try it with mixed seafood.

I feel bad about throwing off the ratings, but we really didn't like this. I used tilapia, canned instead of fresh tomatoes, black olives instead of green, No capers, and upped the red pepper flakes to 1/4. The sauce didn't thicken, so I had to add cornstarch. Maybe all this is enough to change the taste of the recipe, but I wouldn't chance trying it again.

Oh my goodness, sooo good.  Family couldn't stop raving.  Daughter, 18, said she could eat it every night.  It was fabulous.  Will definitely be making again, SOON!  Only change was used home grown tomatoes from brother's garden, big beef & something else, not roma.  Favorite fish dish now!

I made this exactly as the recipe states, and it was absolutely delicious.  I did have to use tilapia because I couldn't find any sea bass.  We really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic! Because they were available, and it was convenient, I added pencil thin asparagus spears to the pan when I added the fish- it was superb!

Definitely one of the best fish recipes ever!!  Only thing is that I didn't have a few things, so I made some changes.  I added red pepper in with the onion and garlic.  I skipped the tomatos (don't like them).  I swapped out fresh basil for the cilantro.  Even with those changes - it was awesome!!

I thought this recipe was pretty tasty. I did enjoy the different flavors in the dish, with a little tang every time you bit into a green olive but I did not LOVE it. So... 4 it is. It's definitely not something I'd send back. It's just not something I'd order twice.

I made this last Friday for family and friends. It was such a great success! It's the best sea bass I have ever had. Thank you!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly in a sense that I had to double it and didn't have enough olive and caper. But still it came out perfect. I served it with rice and black beans, as many reviewers did. Everyone at the table raved about the dinner and we cleaned the plates. :) This is definitely a keeper in our house.

I made this for a dinner party of 6.  It was perfect and very gormet.  The salty capers and olives season the fish perfectly.  Very colorful and impressive presentation.  Definately company fare!

It tasted divine!  I followed the recipe except I used black olives instead of the stuffed green type.  It was sooo good, my sister and her husband enjoyed it a lot and she requested for me to cook it again for a dinner party she is hosting for 12.  This time I will use the stuffed green olives.

This is an excellent recipe for sea bass.   I love all the flavors in the various ingredients.   However, this is a sea bass recipe and if you are not a big fan of sea bass (like me) this will not change your mind.   I may try this recipe with another fish.

Made this recipe with tilapia, and it was delicious!  I used canned tomatoes with chilis, as one reviewer suggested, and it added just the right amount of punch.

This was awesome and a meal in itself!!! Made it for my fiance, he was floored and said it was "by far the best fish dish he has ever had" I agreed, secretly, But I would I strongly recommend it and can't wait to make it for our friends. Also, the sea bass comes out perfect at the recommended time.  Although I did not use the capers, turned out great.  I'm definitely going to make this again.  5 star plus plus plus...

This was truly delicious.  The only downside was that I used tilapia instead of sea bass and the fish quality left much to be desired.  The sauce, however, was amazing.  Great for people who love green olives.  I left the capers out and didn't miss them.

This was great!  My husband was skeptical until he tasted it, then said "I'd definitely eat this again."  Followed the recipe exactly, but I might have reduced the capers slightly.  Be careful of the wine you use, if it's too tart it'll emphasize the olives and capers.  Maybe next time I'll use half wine and half broth.

This was very good.  I used canned tomatoes because I had no fresh, and substituted 1 tsp coriander for the fresh cilantro (coriander is from the root of the cilantro plant).

This was really good! It was really fresh tasting.  I omitted the olives and it was still great.  I used 3 cups seeded roma tomatoes and still had plenty of the reduction left.  I was surprised how long it took to get the wine to evaporate but it was worth the wait. I will definetly make this again.

GREAT !  My husband made this for me the other day and I loved it.  He used Chilean Sea Bass and omitted the cilantro because he doesn't like it (I like it in moderation).  I don't know that the one person was saying about the capers, the capers and olives with the tomatoes made it spectacular !  YUM !  Can't think of any way it should be changed.  This sauce would go great with any white fish, but Chilean Sea Bass is our favorite fish.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really, really good!  I used talapia and it turned out great.  I reduced the butter to 1 tablespoon and used fresh mint instead of cilantro because that's all I had on hand.  Great recipe.

Great recipe for people with a low carb lifestyle.  We used see bass caught by a neighbor off the Massachusettes coast.  A few substitutions that you may want to consider...I didn't use wine and added oregano and chili powder.  The meal was fantastic - my wife's favorite fish dish that she's ever had.

This is delicious and so easy!  Any firm fleshed white fish would work; I used red snapper.  Had no fresh, so used two cans of chopped tomatoes. As some other reviewers remark, do go easy on the capers as they can turn the dish bitter if too many are used.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! The only thing I did differently was add a few red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. My husband could not get enough of it - will definitely be making again and again!

This is definitely a keeper and one to make for friends. It was awesome. Used cod instead of sea bass (I think any white fish would be ok) and skipped the white wine (didn't have any, and didn't want to use red). Used green jarred olives and some kalamata ones we had. Again, great dish.

I've tried several other sea bass recipes that were pretty good.  This one, however, is by far the best.  I really loved this dish.  Very hearty, delicious and simple dish!  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you for posting this recipe.

One word, unbelievable!  I have now made this recipe for several dinner parties and have passed it on to numerous friends and everyone has the same response.  I myself make it without the green olives but find the flavor of the cilantro a must in the recipe.

There was a tanginess to this that I couldn't place what ingredient it came from.  It was good and really had a different flavor to it.  Something you make only once in a while.   Not my favorite, but something different.

This is my go-to recipe.  It's easy, it's healthy and it's delicious!  I always get raves when I serve this...and I don't cook much.  I use tilapia as a sub since it's cheaper and readily available in my neck of the woods (South Florida) But any mild white fish would probably do.  A definite keeper!

Oh man this was sooooo good! I can hardly wait to make it again. I only deviated from the recipe in 2 ways and only because it meant I didn't have to go shopping. I used regular tomatoes that I seeded and chopped and I didn't have fresh cilantro, but used a "lightly dried" brand of cilantro that I had in the refrigerator. I normally adapt recipes, but really don't see that it is necessary in this case. I served over white rice.

I used canned Italian tomatoes instead of fresh plum tomatoes. Then I simmered the sauce to concentrate it before adding the sea bass. Altogether the dish was good, and it reflected Cuban cuisine well.

I used smallmouth bass that was in my freezer for a year or two. The fish was still good and had no freezer burn. The firm fresh water bass was excellent with this recipe. It has a nice clean taste with a nice Caribbean flare.

I do not typically follow directions. But this was excellent. The only change I made was I added a little cornstarch to the tomato onion and garlic sauce to thicken it up. I also doubled up the red pepper because we love spice!

This was great. Be certain to use the full amount of tomato. I halved the recipe once and had to add tomatoes.
If the sauce gets too thick, add some chicken stock.  Adding more wine gives it too much of a winey taste, but is still good. 
I served this over Spanish rice and it was even more wonderful.

This was great!  The texture of the fish is fantastic.  I scaled it to one serving and used a can of fire roasted diced tomato, drained. I wonder if those having issues with the sauce cooking down didn't drain first? It made alot of sauce, so I would probably do half a can of tomatoes next time.  one serving scaled to 1/8 tsp pepper flakes. I upped it to almost 1/4tsp but still didn't taste it, so I would probably up it to 1/2tsp and add some other spices.  The tomatoes were the prominent flavor.  I used 1/2 green olives and 1/2 kalmata olives.  I didn't have any capers so I skipped those.  And I added a bag of steamed vegetables to the sauce.  Will definitely make this again!

My wife loved this recipe, I pretty much followed the directions except for using Del Monte canned Italian herbed tomatoes and substituting Myers Rum for the white wine since I didn't have a bottle open.  We can call it Drunken Sea Bas Cuban style.

Not my usual go to for sea bass, but this was delicious! We chose to grill the fish separately and I placed mine over a bed of spinach for added nutrition.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes!  I make it for special occasions because the sea bass is so expensive.  I have tried the sauce with other kinds of fish but the sea bass is perfect for this and so I take a deep breathe and buy it.  I follow the recipe with everything except I do not add the capers.  I think it makes it a bit too salty for my taste.

So delicious!  This recipe is so versatile with other fish. (will also try with chicken) I made it with fresh Ling cod, everyone raved about it.  I would not change a thing.  The guys just came home with more fish (from Bodega Bay) cooking it up tonight!

Delicious!!,I made  this dish exactly , I used black olive instead of green olive and 2 cans of diced tomatoes  because  don't have fresh at that moment. I'm not a big fan of fish meat but let me said this is one of the best fish I ever had. Easy to cook, easy to follow , excellent results , Have a lot of compliments from my family. I will definitively  make this again.

This was pretty good. I did use cod as sea bass is not available here (and I wouldn't be able to afford it if it was). I also halved the sauce and used fresh tomatoes. The only thing keeping this recipe from getting 5 stars was the fact it took WAY longer to reduce the sauce, at least 30 minutes. BF and I both enjoyed this and I will make it again. Thanks

Used Mahi Mahi since it’s what I had on hand, followed the recipe to the letter.  My family (especially my Italian) husband loved it!  This was quick, easy to follow and bursting with layers of flavor.  Thank you for sharing this with us!

This is one of mine and my husbands favorite sauces, we end up using it on chicken and steak as well, and it's easily adjustable if you don't have all the ingredients or want to add something extra.

GREAT recipe.  I've used Tilapia, lemon sole, flounder, monk fish.  Works great with all of them.  I have also omitted butter and oil and it's just as great.

This recipe was delicious. I did not have white wine and instead substituted a Pinot Noir. It came out delicious.   I recommend using vidalia or purple onions and then cook then onions to a medium brown to carmelize the sugar in the onions. This will bring out the sugars in the onions and help counteract the salty olives and capers. I'm sure I'll keep making this and trying different fish each time.

I felt so strongly about this recipe I had to review it. I made it tonight for dinner and it was a huge hit. I made it with halibut because it was $18.99 a lb. opposed to sea bass that was $25 a lb. Everyone loved it. It was easy to make and was delicious. I even had one guest ask to take home the left over sauce. There was no fish leftover but the sauce was so good he wanted to take it home.   FYI don't make the same mistake I did. I bought the mini sugar plum tomatoes and had to cut and take the seed out of what felt like 200 tomatoes. Try and find the larger version of plum tomatoes and this recipe will be easy breezy.

We were both very surprised at how this turned out. About half way through the cooking we lifted the lid to smell it and joked that we should get the pizza phone number out. But after the first bite we were sold.

The sauce was excellant but I was not a fan of the fish's texture - I suppose I prefer something firmer.  Will definately make again but will try with chicken breasts next time.

Wow, Kiki you got it right,this is amazing! Because I was serving just the two of us, I used 1 can Italian tomatoes, cut the wine by half, used extra garlic,capers,chili flakes and cilantro; less olives, and just 1 cup onion. It was delicious, and we will make this again, not just for us, company too. Thanks so much for sharing!!

I really enjoyed the sauce for this dish.  This was my first time buying/cooking sea bass and I think I'm not that crazy about the fish itself.  I would consider making this again with another fish like cod or halibut.

My New Years Resolution is to learn to cook fish and this was my first recipe. It was easy and very very tasty. The recipe is very easy to follow, the ingredients are common (I hate when the ingredients are random and difficult to find), and it tasted very very good!

Subtle yet Amazing Taste!  This recipe is dead-on, and the key is to use FRESH sea bass.  I am not a fan of olives, so I leave those out, but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly.  My family loves this as well.  Remember: "Never cook with a wine that you wouldn't drink yourself!" I would recommend using at least a $12 wine if you can...

I used scallops instead of sea bass and left out the capers. I put it on a bed of rice, but I think it would have been better on penne pasta or something like that, which is what I will do next time. And I WILL be cooking this again... it was a big hit!!

WONDERFUL!  I followed the recipe with the exception of one thing  -  I made a compound butter with the butter and cilantro and added some fresh parsley at the end.  

On a side note, I did everything up until the fish before my guests arrived and then it was just the matter of bringing it to the simmer and adding the fish  -  worked out well, I'm always looking for something that I can do so there is no mess in the kitchen when guests arrive, but still have that "you were really expecting us" feel.  Served with simple brown rice and sugar-free Pinapple sorbet  -  heathy and wonderful!

This is a great recipe.  I’m always looking for different ways to cook fish.  I only used half of the green olives and substituted tilapia for bass.  The result was still outstanding.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Restaurant quality - husband and daughter raved.  AND quick & easy  . . . what more can you ask for?  I used tilapia, didn't have fresh tomatoes so used 1 can diced and 1 can fire roasted diced tomatoes, didn't use the capers because i didn't have any, and about doubled the red pepper.  Served over saffron rice.

I used flounder, omitted the butter and didn't have cilantro, but this recipe was still wonderful.  Very easy.  I enjoyed the mix of flavors.  Yum!

This turned out wonderful!  The only thing I did differently was use a mix of garlic and chili marinated green olives from my local grocer.  I think the little bit of chili really enhanced the flavors.

I love this - there are so many flavors, yet they combine nicely into one. It's such a beautiful dish, it would be great for entertaining. Perfect served with a bagutte, for soaking up all the lovely sauce.

Good news...my hubby LOVED this dish. Bad news...I didn't!  Followed the recipe exactly, will try tweaking it some next time and using chicken. As others suggested, didn't use all the capers it called for, used about a quater.

I thought this recipe was good and has a lot of potential.  My boyfriend and I agreed that the olives overpowered the dish.  I think next time I'll omit the green olives and capers (not a big fan of capers).  I will replace the fresh diced tomatoes with canned Basil/Garlic Stewed Tomatoes.

This was a hit.  I substituted canned tomato (drained) for fresh and it turned out great.  Next time I will try it with chicken.  I think it will be yummy.

YUM!!  For anyone who is trying to add fish to their healthy menu plans this is wonderful!!  Fresh sea bass is so mild in flavour and has such a great texture and what can I say about the sauce...fabulous!!  I added a sprig of fresh rosemary and it just added that fresh herb taste which I love.  Enjoy!!

This was definitely an easy and delicious recipe.  In addition to the Sea Bass, I also added prawns to this recipe and omitted the olives, since my husband doesn't care for them.  I can't wait to try this recipe w/ Salmon.  (I think the Salmon should help up well with the sauce!)

This recipe was very delicious and not at all complicated! I omitted the capers and olives just because I don't care for those two ingredients but the dish was still wonderful without them.  Even my boyfriend, who is less than enthusiatic about fish, thought this was great.  I served it with tomato couscous but next time I plan to use linguini.

This was FABULOUS!!!  I am a huge fan of sea bass and thought this sounded great as I love Cuban food.  The flavors were very complimentary.  Although this involved some work with all of the dicing of the tomatoes, slicing olives, etc. it was really not a difficult recipe.  My husband and 12 year old son devoured theirs too!  I served this with cous cous and fresh steamed spinach and it was a gourmet like meal!  For those who thought the sea bass was strong, I'm  wondering if you had fresh fish?  I washed my fish and squirted juice of 1 lemon and let it sit while I did all of the slicing and chopping.  My sea bass tasted mild, flaky and not a bit dry.  This is a keeper in my household.  If only sea bass weren't so hard to find.  Thanks for sharing!

Normally I am a huge fan of capers. And cilantro. So I was very excited when I saw this recipe that called for both. Now I was a little skeptical that both flavors would mix well, and I was right. The red sauce was terrific, but the capers killed it. They were just a bad flavor combo w. the cilantro. I'd leave them out if I were you (I also omitted the green olives, out of preference). Leave in the cilantro and be liberal with the red pepper flakes and this could be a killer recipe!

Great sauce.  I used Tilapia, but stuck to the rest of the recipe.  Will increase the red pepper flakes next time for greater punch.  But otherwise makes wonderful meal.  Thanks Kiki!

Sea Bass was a little strong for those who are not fish fans.  If I cook this again I will use Tilapia.  It also took a lot longer than the recipe stated it would to prepare.  I am not sure the average cook can prep and cook this meal in 45 minutes - at least not the first time.   It was a nice meal to try.

I didn't have enough tomatoes at hand, so instead I substitute the other half for tomato sauce in a can...it still turn out like a gourmet dinner.  Served it with cuban rice and fried banana...delicious even for my "only fried fish" tastebud

One of my new favorites!!!  I substituted talapia and added scallops at the very end.  The sweet scallops provide a dense texture like sea bass but are much cheaper!!  Plus the sweetness is a perfect balance to the salty capers/olives.  They can simmer with the sauce until it thickens.  As suggested, I went light with the capers.  Bon Appetite!!

This was an excellent recipe! I modified it a little because I had just bought swordfish, which I lightly grilled before adding it to the sauce. It tasted delicious, and I will definitely try this recipe with sea bass and other fish in the future.

This recipe was fantastic.  I substituted a mediterranean olive mixture from our local 'organic' store, corsely chopped and tilapia for the sea bass.  I can't believe how easy it was, and the sauce was to die for!  Served it with black beans and rice, which was a perfect compliment to the meal.  I will absolutely cook this over and over again!

This was easy to make and very flavorful.  I usually prefer my sea bass citrusy/sweet but this salty recipe was a great addition.  I left out the capers this time b/c I only like them in very small amounts, if at all.  I thought this recipe was great w/out them and probably won't add them next time either.  It took about 20 mins for my fish to be cooked at this low/simmer temperature.

Fantastic! I used rainbow trout (that was caught that morning by my husband in a deep sea fishing trip!) and the flavor was amazing. Fresh fish makes all the difference. I only had 1/2 the amt of tomato, and IMHO it was enough. I had to cook it for a bit longer, but I might have had a little more fish than the recipe called for.
