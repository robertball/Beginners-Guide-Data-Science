This is a great idea ... I have seen this recipe before but it's always with the shrimp mixture served separately on top.  I have to comment on the reviewer who said to substitute cornmeal for grits because they were the same thing.  They're not! (I'm a southerner).  It's true that both are made from corn but they are ground and processed completely differently and often made from different parts of the corn kernel.  Supermarket cornmeal is much more finely ground; boiling it up will basically give you polenta.  It's good, but that's not what the recipe calls for.  Grits are much more coarsely ground and have a distinctive chewiness when cooked.

Use THREE cups of chicken broth to ONE cup of grits - NO NEED TO BAKE! -after all ingredients are combined in the grits pot, add shrimp and eat after they turn pink - super delicious!  We use Ro*tel tomatoes for a spicy kick.

YUM!  My husband and I discovered a love for shrimp and grits on visits with our friend in Charleston.  We've tried a few different variations, but like this one the best. Based on things we loved from other recipes, we have modified this one a bit.  I use half chicken broth, half water, no salt, and I add mushrooms  and FRESH chopped basil with the shrimp mixture.  The basil really adds to the flavor   of this dish...but then again, we really love fresh basil!

This recipe was simple and very good -- hubby and I both enjoyed it. I'm wondering if some people's turned out runny because the recipe calls for 4 cups of stock to 1 cup of grits. I just followed the directions for the grits on the box and it only called for 3 cups of liquid. I also drained the tomatoes & chilies. For presentation, I think I'd prefer a "deconstructed" version of this recipe, but for a casual meal with family, a one-pan recipe is the way to go.

Great recipe. You absoutely cannot substitute corn meal for grits.  They are totally different.   If you cook the grits the full 20 minutes they will not be runny.  Directions on the grits package say cook five minutes but for a true southern grits texture cook 20 minutes stirring often or they will stick to the botton of pan, and be lumpy. One review says no need to bake.  Don't skip this important step.. The flavors will not come together without baking.  Thanks William for a super recipe.

This was a great dish. I served it for brunch today and had to make copies of the recipe for our friends. The only thing I can suggest for those who think it is a little runny is to drain the tomatoes and green chilies before adding to the mixture, or you could use Rotel tomatoes and green chilies.  They work even better.  Then it is perfect. The recipe didn't specify to do that.

My husband is from the south and we eat grits (not cornmeal) at least twice a week.  One of my favorite restaurants serves a dish similar to this.  I was very excited to find this recipe.  I made the recipe as listed, but did adding some Hillshire Farms sausage.  My husband and I enjoyed the dish, but did find it a bit salty.  Next time I'll omit the salt and just flavor to taste when eating.

Followed the recipe, except I didn't add any salt, and I sprinkled the shrimp mixture with some creole seasoning as it cooked.   Served it separately, rather than as a casserole, and it was wonderful!

This was sooooo yummy!  The only thing I changed is that I used the frozen onion/green peppers/red pepper mix (cause I'm all for fast and easy).  And maybe next time I'll also add a bag of frozen salad shrimp, just to have a little more shrimp.

For anyone not from the south, before you go nuts trying to find 'grits' in your local supermarket what you want is more comonly known as Cornmeal.

Anywho, Very good recipe, really enjoyed it, made a couple small modifications, used fresh tomatoes and sweet jalapeno peppers, a little more pepper and cheese. Cheers

We made this today as written except we used quinoa in place of the grits and topped with a little extra cheese.  This dish was INCREDIBLE.  It was so full of flavor, it was just amazing!  We loved it!  I am so glad we made it!  It will definitely be a regular!  I suggest trying to make it using quinoa in place of grits!

This is a good recipe. I live in Charlestonm, SC where there are many versions of Shrimp and Grits dishes. But the best I have tasted here is from Rivers Edge where they add andouille sausage and they use the stone ground grits ( makes a world of difference).

This had a very good flavor but way too salty (and I like salt!)  Don't see the need to add salt to chicken broth.

Followed recipe pretty closely after readng reviews.  Minor changes, used what I had,red onions, more garlic, a little less cheese (jack and cheddar) some andouillee.  i drained rotel tomatoes into measring cup and added chicken reduced sodium broth to make 3 1/2 c. liquid to cook grits.  only cooked grits a few minutes, stirring constantly cause i used instant grits.  added small amount of cajn creole seasonng to grits with the cheese and then poured skillet mixture on top and mixed lightly and baked about 20 min.  husband loved it.  it'sgood and really easy and i had everything on hand.  thanks for good football watching food!!!

I have made this several times and it deserves a 5 star rating. However, I am giving this a sixth (invisible) star for ME! Yay for me! I used my own shellfish stock instead of chicken. I subbed a sharp aged white horseradish cheddar for the called for cheeses. The horseradish with the tomatos gave a subtle "cocktail sauce" taste to the dish that I was really pleased with.  I used a can of fire-roasted tomatos instead of the rotel, so I added a dash of liquid smoke and a shake of ground chipotle to bring out the smoke of the tomatos . I am still patting myself on the back a day later as I eat the cold leftovers. Thanks William for making me look good!

Excellent tasting meal!  I had to do lots of substitutions because I decided to make this at the last minute (2 c chicken broth and 2 c water, diced white onion for green, no peppers, kielbasa for the shrimp), but oh so yummy anyway!  However we did have to eat it out of a bowl because it was so runny after baking, so next time I'm only going to use 3 cups liquid to 1 cup grits as others recommended.  Also not as spicy as expected based on the title, I fed it to my 1 year old.  But will definitely make again!

Very good!  Based on other reviews, I used low-sodium broth and didn't add salt, and greatly reduced the amount of cheese (personal preference). Quick, easy, delicious!

This was just okay for me as I prefer a more traditional Shrimp and Grits.  The grits were a perfect consistency going into the oven but came out rather watery.  If you let it cool before serving (hot grits are like hot lava!) they thicken up well. I drained the tomatoes and then added chicken broth to make 4 cups liquid for the grits.

This dish is so simple and delish.  If you want it a little less soupy, cut your liquid to 3 cups for the grits, and drain the tomatoes before adding.  I don't even put in oven, just combine in the frypan and serve.  YUM!

This has been a family favorite for years. I’ve tried many variations, but these adjustments a over-the-top. I’ve used slow cooking traditional grits. Good, but quick-cooking with 3 cups of chicken broth is delicious. Add a pound of good-quality smoked sausage. If you can’t find grits in your local store, order from Amazon.

My revisions to this were minimal, so I'm still giving it 4 stars for a decent, easy base recipe. I replaced some of the broth with half-and-half, added a healthy dash of Worcestershire sauce, and combined in one pot as one reviewer suggested rather than baking. Next time I will add whole kernel corn, like a local award-winning restaurant does. Diced red pepper is also a better complement, I think, than green. It's not renowned City Grocery (Oxford, MS) Shrimp & Grits, but still not a bad recipe! Even better the next day.

The base recipe was delicious.  I made a couple tweaks, including 3 cups chicken broth instead of 4, fresh tomatoes and jalapeños instead of the canned, and skipped the oven step.

I'm a native North Carolinian and I love grits! Needless to say, I loved this dish! It was easy to make and everyone that I have made this for has loved it too! In addition, I add a little extra chicken broth towards the end of cooking the grits on the stove, so they have a more creamy texture before I placed them in the oven where they firm up.

Thank you, thank you!  Restaurant quality!   My husband and I made it together and had a lot of fun.  Very easy. We enjoyed this recipe so much.  Quite the comfort food.  I'd recommend letting sit 10 minutes after baking to thicken up some and to serve with bread.  We added a bit of creole seasoning for a little bit of an extra kick.  Can't say enough good things about this recipe.  My husband and I made it together and had a lot of fun.  Very easy.

I fixed this dish for my sons and me. I made it according to the recipe except I used a tsp of garlic powder instead of the minced garlic and omitted the salt. I also substituted 1 jalepeno pepper for additional heat for half of the bell pepper. Very yummy! Next time I will add some real bacon bits as a garnish.

This recipe is great and I can't wait to make it again!  I didn't have the rotel so I did modify it a bit.  I used frozen diced red and green peppers.  I also used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and a small can of green chilis.  I also used 2 pounds of shrimp instead of 1.  I didn't have to reduce the amount of water however next time I think I will add a few more grits to thicken it up a bit.  Finally I did not add salt and was glad I didn't because the flavor was perfect without it.

Absolutely delicious!  One can never have too much cheese, so I added a ton to this recipe.  I didn't have the ro-tel on hand, so I took the advice of another reviewer and used home made salsa.  The hubs usually doesn't like grits, but he loved this recipe.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe and it has been a huge hit for Christmas brunch and also for dinner. Great recipe! For Christmas brunch I make it the night before and refrigerate it, bake it in the morning with no problems!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!!!  Ok, so I did change it just a little by cooking some bacon and sauteeing my bell pepper, onion and garlic in the bacon drippings.  Once my veggies were tender, I added my shrimp, rotel tomatos with the green chilies to the mixture in the bacon drippings and let it slow cook.  I also added milk to my grits while it was cooking.  When my shrimp were done I served the grits in a bowl & added my shrimp mixture on top.    My boyfriend is a huge shrimp & grits fan and he absolutely loved it!!  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I added a couple things and because there is one restaurant in Atlanta that makes this dish and theirs taste a little bit better (they add some secret ingredient we can't figure out).  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!!

I used less broth as advised in other reviews, used butter, and 1/2 can chiles as I didn't have the tomato mix as stated (I used petite diced toms instead). This was even better on the second day for breakfast with toast. A good way to use the cheaper smaller shrimp always on sale.

I love and shrimp & grits so was very eager to try out this recipe, especially after seeing all of the excellent reviews.  I was disappointed.  It was quite watery and very salty (and I didn't add the salt called for in the recipe).  I've gone back to the reviews again and see the comments about not using so much broth.  This wasn't bad but I probably won't make again.

I made this dish for dinner tonight. Though it was tasty, I wasn't thrilled by the flavor. I agree with other reviewers that omitting the salt is a must-do. Even without salt I found it to taste a bit salty. It looked very pretty, however, and the consistency was nice. I'd probably make this again but I don't think it will be a staple.

This was a great recipe. If you have never tried shrimp & grits give this recipe a try. I added some andouille sausage to kick it up a bit and it turned out good.

WOW! This was one of my favorite dishes at a local restaurant when we lived in Atlanta. What a wonderful find, I think it was even better than the restaurant version. Husband LOVED it and coming from a real Southerner that was quite the compliment. THANKS!!!!

Fantastic recipe!  I made this for a party and it was cleaned out in no time.  I added 14 oz of spicy cajun sausage cut into small bites.  Cook the sausage in with the onions, peppers and shrimp.  It gave the dish a nice spicy flavor.  I did not include the tomatoes but I did add a can of green chilies.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband thought it was very good...he is from the south and a picky eater as well, it is hard to find recipes that he really likes...this is definately a keeper.  The only change I made was to put in a couple of jalapeno peppers per his request and it came out great!

This is awesome. I have never had grits before and I'm so glad this is the recipe I decided to try.  The only change I made was to use water to cook the grits instead of chicken broth, just because I didn't have any broth.  I also added a touch of cayenne to the grits for a little more spice.  This has made the dinner rotation.

I cut the recipe in half and only adjusted from the reviews and my taste.  I didn't add garlic as its not a flavor that I like and no salt because of my health but followed the rest.  I did enjoy the flavor, but I think this will be the only time that I make this recipe.

I've made a lot of Shrimp and Grits but never "casserole style" until I read the reviews and decided to try this recipe last night.   It wasn't as visually appealing as the composed version, but was FAR better than I expected and I'll definitely make it again!   Using what I had on hand, I slivered half a yellow onion and subbed it for the scallions, and added two fresh diced jalapenos.   I drained the RoTel into a glass measuring cup and then added the broth...I actually used leftover seafood stock and the flavor was fantastic.   I was afraid that baking for 40 minutes would make the shrimp rubbery but it didn't.   The end result was creamy (not soupy) and I served it in shallow pasta bowls, topped with fresh chopped flat leaf parsley.   Delicious comfort food that's not too heavy -- a perfect weeknight meal!

Fantastic depth of flavor for minimal effort.  I tossed in a cup of baby spinach to add leafy greens to the mix, which worked perfectly.  Gluten free yumminess and a definite repeat menu item in Coach Pete's kitchen.  One of the best Internet recipes I have made in years.  Pow!

The best shrimp and grits I have ever had hands down!!!! Very flavorful and I loved all the colors the veggies added. The only change I made was adding andouille sausage, which I felt gave it a hint of spice without overpowering. I thinly sliced four smoked andouille sausages and browned them in a pan, then simply added in with the vegetable mixture. Definitely a keeper recipe for sure!

I was looking for a great shrimp & grits recipe & this delivered!  I made the recipe with ingredients/amounts exactly as written, I only changed the presentation.  My first southern taste of this dish was served with the shrimp mixture over a layer of grits, so that's how I served it, omitting baking it as my grits were not runny at all as others had mentioned.  Enjoy!

Easy to make gluten- free. We used 1 1/3 cups Bobs Red Mill G-Free Cornmeal instead of quick cooking grits. We also used homemade stock from smoked chicken... The smoke adds a dimension that defies description. Be careful not to over cook the shrimp. Mine were pretty much still raw when I combined everything with the grits and they came out of the oven perfect. I will make this for guests. It's that good.

This is a wonderful recipe! I use this recipe all the time when entertaining.  It is easy and delicious! William A put together a must-make.

I made a few adjustments based on reading the comments and what I could find to cut down on prep work for this delicious recipe. 
3 cups of low-sodium chicken broth and I buy the pre-diced pepper mix from Publix (tri-color mix).  I also use the Publix Medium frozen peeled, deveined and de-tailed medium shrimp that is roughly 1.5 lbs. I use a spicy Rotel and I would recommend also draining.

Five Stars guaranteed!!!!

My husband and I love this recipe.  It is a great comfort food on a chilly night.  I use the shrimp already peeled and deveined for convenience.  The only change I've made is to drain the can of chiles/tomatoes (Rotel) as it will make it way too juicy.  And I add a lot more cheese.  Yummy!

Not the creamy shrimp and grits I expected - mine came out with a bit of a Mexican flair (I used a can of Rotel so it is my fault), but excellent none the less!  Would work well for company.

I was trying to come up with a way to get rid of a huge box of grits I had in my cupboard so I made this for dinner last night. Absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making this again. We ate the whole thing between two of us!

I like this version of shrimp and grits. Slight spice. Pretty to look at with the green peppers, red tomatoes, and yellow cheese. The only change I made was to combine the uncooked shrimp with all the ingredients in the baking dish. It seemed like they would have been overcooked, otherwise. Next time I make it, I want to layer the dish. I will combine the vegetables and shrimp together and pour into the baking dish. Then I will combine the grits with the cheeses and pour on top of the shrimp layer. And, then top with a light layer of cheese. Like an upside down pineapple cake, I'm thinking this will be an upside down Spicy Shrimp and Grits.

Yum.  I used fresh tomatoes and threw in half a can of green chiles.  I left out the salt, used one tablespoon of butter instead of 2 tblsp margarine, and used 1/2 a yellow onion because I didn't have any green onions on hand.

My picky kids and my even pickier husband gobbled it down.  A definite keeper. 

Next time, I'll cut the chicken broth down as it was a little soupy.  But delicious nonetheless.

Thanks William A!

This was a winner!  I cooked for longer, drained the ro-tel, and sprinkled crumbled cooked bacon over the top and allowed it to rest for about 20 minutes before serving.  I'd kick up the spice a bit next time and throw in some jalapenos.  It was awesome and my husband couldnt resist 2nds and 3rds.

Can I give this 6 stars?!  I add diced jalapenos for extra spice. I also drain the Rotel tomatoes, otherwise the recipe is too runny. Other than that I follow the recipe exactly as given.   **TIP - if you're in a hurry you can add cooked shrimp to the pan right before mixing and pouring in the dish. I cannot count how many times I have made this and there is never ANY left!

Super delicious! I had eaten shrimp and grits at a coastal city restaurant last month and loved it! Wanted to try making it myself and tried this recipe! It turned out great! Changes I made: started out with 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth and no water and added more chicken broth as needed while the grits cooked; did not add salt; added a good sized dash of cayenne pepper and dried basil and added extra Monterrey Jack Cheese and more Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese to the mixture before putting it in the baking dish and topped the mixture with 1 full cup of the extra sharp cheddar instead the of the 1/4 cup that the recipe called for--we like cheese at our house! Three of us ate more than half of the recipe (in a 9x12 baking dish) just at dinner tonight! My only regret is that I didn't have toasted garlic bread or some kind of crusty bread to go with it!! I've read that the dish is better the next day, so by lunch tomorrow, it will all be gone!

This was absolutely delicious! Definitely the best shrimp and grits I've ever had! However,I did have to add some seasonings as it looked pretty bland as is. I only had a can of mild Rotel, so I upped the spiciness by adding a combination of red, black, and white pepper along with basil and thyme to the vegetable mixture. I seasoned the shrimp with N'Awlins seafood seasoning and used Kraft Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese blend with a touch of Philly. If you haven't used the Philly cheeses yet, you must try them. It gave the recipe a delightful creaminess. Will absolutely make again!

I LOVE this recipe!  To be honest, I've never had Shrimp and Grits but have been curious for a long time so decided to give it a go!  Unbelievable!  I definitely have to say the leftovers got better by the day and I think we've found a new favorite dish in our home!  Thank you!

This was really good. I used regular onion in place of green onion, and mozzarella in place of monterey jack because I had it on hand. At the end I felt the dish needed a little punching up. I don't know how, but the suggestion to use basil worked perfectly! Along with the dried basil, I added some shakes of cayenne to taste. Very yummy. Next time I may use some extra sharp cheddar for more bite. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy . . . yummy . . . yummy. The ultimate comfort food. Made it a one-pot meal (no need to bake) by cooking peppers, onions, and garlic in a large sauce pan first. Then cooked coarse ground grits ("Georgia ice cream") in the same pan with the sauted vegies. It's impossible to find a fresh shrimp in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, so I thawed out cooked, shelled, deveined shrimp. Plucked the "stems" and zapped them in the microwave for a few seconds,  topping the individual bowls of cheese grits with shrimp. The grits alone were divine for breakfast the following day.

If you are looking for one more reason to eat shrimp, look no further.  Your quest is over.  I tried the grits mixture prior to adding the shrimp.  It is good enough  to stand on it's own.  But how does one say "No" to a step that calls for adding shrimp?  Too, I agree w/Karine (Dec 2008) this mix cannot be limited to shrimp. I'm thinking fajita marinated chicken or steak.  And also w/PantherLover (Jan  2009) bake it or don't bake it.  It's  terrific either way.  Thank you, William A. you certainly earned the "A".

I made this twice last week! First just to try it and then again on Sat. for a baby shower brunch.  They loved it!  I used 1 1/2 lbs shrimp, drained the tomatoes and you only need 1/2 the can or it may be too spicy for some (and I like spicy.)  I added 3 eggs (tempered) to the grits before adding all the other ingredients.  I also added 1/2 lb bacon fried and crumbled to the mixture. I sauteed the veggies in some of the bacon fat. Yummy!  I am sharing this with others who have asked for the recipe!

Excellent recipe for shrimp and grits.  I used half chicken stock and half water, and drained the tomotoes and chiles.  Perfect!

Delish!! My husband loved this. It will become a part of my regular rotation. Based on some reviews that the dish was a bit runny, I reduced the chicken stock from 4 cups to 3 1/2 and drained the tomatoes.  I also added turkey sausage and some cayenne pepper. Finally, I had cooked shrimp instead of raw, so I added them 10 minutues before I took the dish out of the oven.

I made this for Thanksgiving breakfast. I was simply delicious. Even the skeptics were impressed. The next time I will add more tomatoes because I love tomatoes.

Wow, all I had to do was lick the spoon after putting the dish in the oven to know it is going to be one delicious dinner!  Of course I have a variation because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I browned up kielbasa to go along with the shrimp and omitted the tomatoes and chilis because I forgot those at the grocery store.  This is a keeper for sure, thanks for the recipe!

I really like this recipe. I use the mild diced tomatoes with chilies as my husband not crazy about really spicy things. Also I lessen the cheese and skip the baking step and it’s delicious!!! Thank you for the recipe!

Made this for the first time last night, and it was an instant hit with our family. I eliminated the chilies because no one in my family does well with spicy foods. Otherwise, do what the recipe says and you'll have a successful dinner!

We loved it!  I didn't change anything, and try not to when I 1st try a recipe.  I did use a 2 lb bag of shrimp, because that's what I had, and used a mixed 2 cup bag of shredded cheddar and jack cheese for convenience.   Next time I might bake it in individual ramekins, to make portioning easier, and I think it would make for a nice presentation, but that's the only thing I might change.  It looked great coming out of the oven, but kinda blah on the plate.  I served it with a salad, so it was a nice simple dinner.  I like having the 30 minutes of bake time to make the salad.  It looked so good coming out of the oven I texted a pic to my friends to torture them "look what we're having for dinner."

Super yummy.  Did a little less black pepper, replacing with a dash or two of cayenne pepper.  My grits were "old-fashioned," not "quick," and the container reads a ratio of water to grits of 4 cups to 1 cup, so I was able to follow the recipe exactly and it worked great.

Following the advice of others who tried this recipe, I used 3 cups of reduced sodium chicken broth instead of 4. I did not drain the tomatoes & green chilies since I reduced the broth. I used 1/2 tsp Creole seasoning vs 1 tsp salt. The finished product was a little runny with the first serving, but appears to be thicker now that it has had a chance to cool.  I think it will reheat nicely also.

Have made it many times and use different cheeses such as gouda, colby jack, monteray jack, and used pepper jack (only used pepper jack once, It was way too spicy.) I also substitute 2 cups of half and half for 2 cups of the chicken broth ( this makes it creamier). I put 1 lb. of cooked smoked sausage in it to.

Absolutely delicious... and EASY! Sure, it's a slightly time-consuming recipe, but the steps and instructions are put in extremely simple terms that even a novice cook like myself can follow. I made this for multiple people and wanted it to have a lot of shrimp, so I doubled the amount of shrimp and only increased everything else up to 1.5X more of what the original recipe called for. The only substitution I made was for the chicken broth because I prefer vegetable, but it didn't (or shouldn't) impact the taste as much due to the strong flavors in all the other ingredients. Definitely a top recipe in my books and will be making it again soon!

I made this without the shrimp because someone else made shrimp to bring to our party.  I also did not have bell peppers in the house, so I added some crushed tomatoes.  It was fabulous and I will make it with all the ingredients in the recipe next time!

Wonderful recipe, but came out a little runny. Next time I'll drain the diced tomatoes and add a little less water to the grits. Overall, a great recipe.

VERY good! This is my husband's favorite meal so I decided to make this for his birthday. It was a huge hit & the best he has ever had (or so he says lol). However, this won't be something I'll be making a ton. I was a little surprised at how time consuming this was. I even cut up all of my peppers the night before & im glad I did! But overall, it was amazing!!

I made this as is it written, and it is fantastic. It is great as is. I also have a friend who doesn't do seafood, and I made a smaller dish with grilled chicken bits instead of shrimp. He loves it that way too.

I have made this three times and loved it every time. I followed the recipe as written and we really enjoy this simple dinner. It does have a little heat in it from the tomatoes and chilies. You could use diced canned tomatoes if you wanted to cut the heat.

This was amazing! Made a few changes based on reviews:

-3c stock instead of 4 
-Added one additional tbsp butter
-Left out the salt
-Used Rotel (drained before adding)
-Seasoned with a good amount of Cajun seasoning

This was good! I'm not a huge grits fan, but I made it for someone who does. He had thirds! The texture seemed fine to me, but he said it was a little runnier than he expected. I used the full four cups of stock and drained the tomatoes. I also added some Old Bay, some habanero and 1/2 lean turkey sausage (I needed to use it up).  I'd definitely make again.

We just made them for the family & was a hit.  Even the 3 grandsons who don't like grits. They wanted more. We used Rotel mild tomatoes & chilies & still had a kick. Will make again next week.

I looked high and low for a good Shrimp and Grits recipe. This was easy and SO GREAT!  I do not add salt. I drain the rotel, and add Creole Seasonong. I have made it several times and have loved it every time.
I do have to agree that corn meal is NOTHING like grits!  You can find grits on the breakfast isle of any grocery store. Also, baking it fuses those flavors to perfection.

I had to halve the recipe.  I would adjust the seasonings slightly.  I would drain the tomatoes.  Otherwise,  it was great!

I made a lot of changes given what I had on hand: shrimp, bell pepper, green onion, canned tomatoes and chiles, cheese, frozen brown rice.  So I just skipped steps 1 and 2 and made the brown rice (microwave).  Cooked the pepper, onions, and garlic as directed; added shrimp, tomatoes, rice, and 3/4 cup shredded jack cheese.  Sprinkled with grated parmesan.  Baked in a 8x8 dish for 25 minutes.   Delicious (and hearty for a shrimp dish)!

Read all of the reviews. Decided to keep recipe as it was, except did drain the tomatoes. When first removed from oven, it does look like too much broth, or soupy grits. But, after letting it stand, or rest for about 8-10 minutes, it was perfect.
Favorite for all!

Absolutely the best shrimp and grits recipe out there! I've never altered the recipe. It's good to note if using quick cooking grits, use 3 cups of broth to one cup of grits or if using old fashioned grits, use 4 cups of broth to one cup of grits. Quick cooking grits are already cooked done a bit and don't need as much liquid as old fashioned. Thanks for sharing William!!

I would give this only 3 stars if you eat it right after you make it. It was a little bland for my taste. If you let the dish sit in the fridge for a day (or better, yet, two) before you eat it, then it is a four-star dish...maybe almost five stars. It was better if you lightly season the shrimp with Tony's (or other brand) seafood seasoning before cooking, too. This is now my go-to recipe for shrimp & grits that I make the day before I'm going to eat it. I also left out the salt, as the broth is salty enough already.

We loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, with the one exception of skipping the added salt.  When it came out of the oven, it did indeed seem surprisingly runny (even though I drained the Rotel tomatoes), but we found it to just be creamy when ladled into the low bowls we like to use, and as the dish sat waiting on our second helpings, it absorbed the liquid.  I don't think I'll change a thing next time.  We loved it.

This was so good!!   Family loved it!  Only made a few changes based on reviews and what I had in my pantry and on hand.  Used a red bell pepper instead of green, used only 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth, plus drained tomatoes and used that liquid in addition to broth for grits.  Cooked grits 20 minutes and in last few minutes added a splash of heavy cream to ensure rich creamy texture.  Added andouille sausage as well as creole seasoned shrimp.  Used pepper jack cheese and sharp cheddar but did not add cheese on top.  Baked for 30 minutes.  Let it rest for 10 minutes and then served with a fruit salad and crusty hot bread.  Sprinkled with chives when serving.  First bite and everyone said, this is on the make again and again list!!!

We grilled the shrimp instead and didn't cook it in the oven.  We did the grits as per recipe and layered the shrimp on top. It was very good.

So yummy, and very easy to make! Totally manageable for a weeknight meal. I like to reserve some of the green onion to sprinkle on top as a garnish after the dish is finished baking.

These were good. I didn't have monterey jack cheese on hand, but used processed cheese cube instead. I also used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onions instead of the ones with green chiles. I seasoned my shrimp with garlic powder, cajun spice, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper to get the spice effect. It all came out really good.

Wow!  Being New Englanders, my family and I have never really thought to eat grits. After a recent trip to the South where I ate grits for the first time (at a Waffle House, of course!), I was inspired to make this.  My two kids devoured this dish - practically licked the bowl clean! And my son usually doesn't like casseroles or things mixed together!  I followed the recipe completely except that I didn't have the canned tomatoes so I used medium salsa, which I scooped out using a fork so that I didn't get too much liquid. Thanks, William!  I'll be making this again!

i cooked this exactly, but used vegetable broth in place of chicken because it was what I had.  Everything else was made to the T.   We really enjoyed this a lot.  By the way, my grits box said 4 cups of water to 1 cup of grits.  I drained the tomato and green chili's.  It was plenty thick for us.

This recipe is very simple and most delicious! As good as I have had at expensive restaurants. I don't really see a need to bake though. I simply served the cheese grits with the shrimp/veggie sauce pour over top.

Made this for the second time tonight for a book group reading a southern novel.  My friends loved it.  I'm not quite sure why, but I thought it made a bit more of a flavor statement the first time.  I might have used onion rather than scallions, probably more cheddar and less Monterrey jack, and certainly white, rather than black, pepper.  That being said, the dish is easy, fast (the quick grits cooked in 5 minutes), delicious and attractive.  Tricolor peppers add a nice bit of color.  Also, rather than draining the tomatoes and peppers as one reviewer suggested, I drained the shrimp and vegetable mix, instead of pouring that liquid into the grits.  The consistency was great.

My in laws loved it, only thing it was soupy and I even drained the rotel..  I also added some creole seasoning to the top and on the shrimp.  The shrimp were already cooked from the store and so I only cooked for 10 minutes, didn't want the shrimp overcooked and be chewy.

I didn't use the whole 1 pepper only a portion since it was diced up, looked like too much pepper if you used the whole thing.. just use your judgement

This was great. I will make it again. I only used 3 cups of chicken broth and it did not take 20 minutes to cook the grits, more like 5. Everything else I left the same. Next time might add a little old bay to the mix. Was really good and would def make again. Even my 2 year old enjoyed it!

I added some turmeric for color and  flavor and used snipped sun dried tomatoes so I had a nice thick consistency. I wish I would have added some cayenne pepper as I like my food spicy and the title of this was misleading. also used roasted red peppers from a jar instead of green peppers.
Can be eaten after the combining in saucepan but I like the crust that baking gave it!
Good enough for company or a Pot Luck.

This was good but for as much cheese was in it I thought it would have more flavor. I might add bacon next time and reduce the cheese.

First time I ever cooked this. It was excellent. The only alteration I had made was that I added smoked bacon, diced, and sautéed it with the vegetables. I also drained to juice from the can of tomatoes.

I was nervous that this recipe was "too simple" to be good, boy was I wrong!  Very tasty dish, my husband exclaimed it was the best thing he has ever tasted!   I made some slight modifications, added some old bay and used some parmesean cheese in addition to a bag of shredded.  Also, be sure to use a can of Rotell tomatoes, they added a lot of flavor.  My grits were a tad runny, so next time I will thicken them up a bit.  YUMMY!!

This recipe was amazing!  I like things pretty spicy so I kicked up the  recipe on spicyness a bit since I wasn't cooking for my kids.  First time I have ever made shrimp or grits!!!  I omitted the salt since chicken broth already has enough salty flavor.  I also used a 1/2 white onion instead of green onion since I forgot the green onion at the store.  I added some polska kielbasa sausage as well.  I used pepperjack instead of monterey jack and for the diced tomatoes and green chilis I used the Rotell HOT with habaneros.  This was the best shrimp and grits that I have ever had... and my boyfriend agreed!

Great dish! I did make several changes after reading the other reviews. I used 3 cups of broth to 1 cup of grits, omitted the salt, used butter instead of margarine, increased garlic to 4 cloves, drained the tomatoes and chilies, added a touch of real bacon bits, and a touch of hot sauce for an extra added kick. No need to bake as this is ready to serve over the cooked grits! This is a definitely a keeper.

I omitted the salt and drained the rotel as some other reviewers suggested.  I also added a tablespoon of cajun spice to the shrimp as I sauted.  This was excellent!

This turned out terribly for me. This ended up very watery when I took it out of the oven for 45 minutes. Although, when I took it out of the oven and put it on the stove with corn starch to thicken it, the flavor was wonderful. I will not put this in the oven next time.

This was very good.  Like most of the comments, the amount of broth could be reduced.  I added creole seasoning and used an insane amount of cheese.  The shrimp were a little overcooked, but next time I won't cook them completely prior to baking.  Overall, good!!! Adding to the kitchen rotation for sure!!!

My boyfriend loved this, but I thought it had a strange taste...I think it might have been the chicken broth, so next time I'm to use 2 c of broth and 2 c of water.  Other than that, it was great.  I loved the consistency!

I do have to reiterate about the grits vs. cornmeal.  They are not the same!!  Please do not use cornmeal in this recipe.  Also, I would like to agree with the reviewer who adds crispy bacon.  I fry it first, then crumble over top.  That is how it is served in restaurants here in southeast N.C.

Mmmm,mmmm good! I followed this recipe to the "t" as far as the ingredients. Instead of mixing it all together, I put the shrimp mixture on top of the grits. I never eat grits unless its at breakfast with sugar. I'm glad I gave this a try!

I had some leftover cheesy grits so I just added those to the the sauteed veggies and heated through.  I didn't even bake it.  Delicious and ridiculously easy!  I was shocked by what great flavor this had without a lot of ingredients.  This will go into the rotation for sure!

This was super delicious!  I like shrimp, I like grits...why not together?  I skipped the Monterey Jack cheese and increased the cheddar to 2 cups (doubled the recipe).  We ate this with collard greens and turnips.  Great meal!

I made this recipe last night.  Just wanted to try something different :)  My husband really liked it.  I omitted the Monterey Jack cheese because I didn't have any on hand.  I also added Cayenne pepper as someone else suggested because we like things extra spicy.  Very tasty!

A very good recipe! I tried grits for the first time ever (such a California girl!)This was so savory even without the shrimp! I followed the recipe but added a little red pepper flake per our taste. I let the casserole set up for 15 minutes after the cooking time. My husband last had grits in the Navy - he was a little unsure about this preparation at first. After dinner he was still eating the grits, dipping garlic bread in them and telling me how fantastic they were. Thank you for a very tasty recipe and a reason to try something new. We will enjoy this again soon! BTW, I found grits at my local WalMart (of all places) in their food isle.
