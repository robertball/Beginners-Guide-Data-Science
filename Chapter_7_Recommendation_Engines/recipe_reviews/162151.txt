Yummy! I didn't have any orange juice so I used lime in its place I really liked the different flavor.

This is a great jam. However, it can be improved upon. I like my jam with a little more zestiness. So, instead of using orange juice I have used lilikoi juice (which is a Hawaiian passionfruit). That is fabulous. People keep telling me to eat papaya with lime juice, so I just tried that - substituting the orange juice with lime juice. Also great. Both make the jam 'pop'. yum.

I love this jam! We have had a ton of papaya from our tree and so glad I found a recipe I can use for all of them! Tried it with orange juice and just used only 1 package of pectin. It came out perfect. I'm going to try lemon juice on the next batch!

Papaya does not need pectin.it contains natural pectin already.i made this recipe with only the other 3 ingredients: papaya , orange juice and sugar.

Nice jam!  I had some fresh tangerines on hand so I squeezed a couple of them in instead of orange juice... delicious.  A great way to take advantage of the giant papayas that go on sale in the Mexican market.  The color is gorgeous.

This was yummy.  Mine did not set quite as well as i would have liked, however it was my first time making Jam.  I used only one package of pectin per another users review, maybe that is where, I went wrong?  I don't know.  It was still a yummy and a fun way to use a bunch of papayas that my neighbor gave me from her tree

I do a lot of canning.  I mashed the papaya up by pulsing the food processor after I peeled the fruit. Also, I have Amish cookbooks and they recommend using jello in place of pectin; it's cheaper and adds a pretty color.  If you do this, be aware that the color jello you use will affect the results.  Use 'orange' for this recipe, not lime.  If you use the jello, for 5 cups of sugar, I'd recommend taking about 1/2 cup out because the jello has sugar in it and it will be a little too sweet otherwise. Leave the OJ out.  Also, I noticed some c/o the jam being a little runny.  The Amish book I have recommends freezing fruit before use. Has something to do with the pectin levels (better consistency).  Also, for you that have papaya trees and are running over in fruit, my suggestion is "have you ever made homemade wine"?  I started making it due to an over abundance of fruit from when I lived in the Apple Valley in Washington.  I gave the recipe 4 stars.  It was ok, but if I would have lessened the sugar, I think it would have been better (I did not lessen to 4.5 cups & jello has sugar). The flavor was ok, but not as good as I'd like; however, the person on here that suggested habanero peppers..not a bad idea. Kicking it up a notch in that way would be an added punch to regular pepper jelly; if you haven't tried it, do.  Nice holiday gift with cream cheese & crackers. Habanero are hot, so if you don't like it really hot try serrano &/or jalapeno. Serrano have really good flavor.

yummy!  The only change i made (because we like sweet and spicy) was to add 2 habeneros.  It came out so good.  I had got a bunch of papayas from the local food bank and had no idea what to do with them.  By happy chance, my grandmother had just given me a bunch of old canning jars. so now i have several batches of Delicious Habenero-Papaya jam and a few batches of regular will be made up tomorrow.  It didn't take too long, because i had 3 little helpers to mash the papayas for me.  This recipe is definately a keeper

I made this jam 3 days ago.  It was very easy and the only change I made was that I squeezed juice from half a lemon to balance out the sweetness.  It tasted wonderful but like the previous comments it didn't set up firm enough.

Very nice flavour, but didn't set too well. I keep the jars in the fridge so this helps keep the jam firm enough. Great as an icecream topping.

It didn't gel like it should have. I needed more pectin. However I will make it again with the extra pectin because it tastes delicious!!! It worked really good as it was as a sauce on ice-cream.
