Excellent! Mine took 12 minutes but then again I like my onions extra crispy. This is a great side to go with many different things including steak, chicken, fish, or even smoked sausage as I used it.

Took a lot longer to cook mine. More than 30 minutes. Next time I’ll try 400° for at least 15 minutes and see if that works better. Otherwise it tasted great.

Five stars. This is a genius recipe. I made it for 6 servings, so it took me about 15 minutes. This was great as a side dish but really shines on top of fajitas and tacos. Leftovers were a happy addition to risotto.
