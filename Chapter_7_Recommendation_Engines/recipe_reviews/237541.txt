Great zesty and tasty recipe.  I used it for my Reuben sandwiches.   I just omitted the egg.   Add the egg if used as a salad dressing.  If you don't have chili sauce, substitute ketchup instead.  And use dill pickle relish, so it won't be too sweet.

This dressing is to die for, if you love Thousand Island dressing!  IT's super easy (the hardest part is boiling the eggs) AND tasty!  Made my taste buds quiver!  LOL!  Used it for Reauben sandwiches and it was perfect!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

No changes! I did not have chili sauce so I used ketchup and chili powder. We used this for Reubens... Yum!

Oh Man this is good!! I left out the egg because I was in a hurry, and adjusted a bit of the seasonings to taste. This is a great Thousand Island and exactly what I was craving. It's a go-to from now on! YUM!

I made this for my husband who loves thousand island. The kids raved about it, and I ended up getting hooked on it myself! I've never been partial to it but this is so much better than bottled stuff and even the dressing I've tried at restaurants. I used ketchup instead of chili sauce because its more husband/kid friendly and omitted the egg because of 1 picky child, but next time I will make an "adult" batch. Thank you so much from my family to yours!!

Delicious!  Perfect for Rubin Sandwiches! For a little more zip, I added a teaspoon of horseradish and 1/2 teaspoon of horseradish mustard.

My husband and I really liked this dressing.  Only criticism is the garlic. Hubby thought it was a little strong.  We will use this recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing.

I only had dill pickle relish, and had to substitute make my own chili sauce using ketchup and a few spices , still really good, zesty.

I love this recipe. I was a bit hesitant to make the whole recipe because it made so much but we had no trouble eating it all. We used it many ways but not for a dressing!  I plan on making deviled eggs with it.

Premium.  I'd use just a bit less garlic next time, but I might have just had some extra strong garlic.  Spot on!

I made this dressing to use with my taco salad recipe. I used about 3/4c Mayo, I actually don't like mayo at all. I left out the egg. Everything else I followed and it is very delicious. It was a tad bit sweet but a good sweetness. I will make it again.

I made 1/2 the recipe.  Tastes just fine but I would like a bit more tang.  Next time I think I would use miracle whip or a bit more chili sauce.
