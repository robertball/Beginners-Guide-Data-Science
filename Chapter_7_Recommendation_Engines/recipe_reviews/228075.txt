I love to make homemade salsas and this one stands up to it's name 'Fresh and Light.' The best thing about this salsa is the ability to add or subtract the amount of ingredients to your taste. I followed the ingredients exactly and will be making it often. Great recipe insanemomof5, thank you.

I made this early to try out for a Memorial day picnic.  Added about a T of garlic and a drizzle of Olive oil.  We loved the flavors and dipped with scoops and tortilla chips.  The longer it set the better it got. I had to make another batch for the picnic because we ate almost all of the first one in two days.

This is ok as is, however, I think it would be much better if you substitute the canned tomatoes with fresh tomatoes and add lemon juice.

Great way to use up all my cucumbers and tomatoes! Taste great! Very easy to make. Used fresh oregano and basil, no cilantro and add a little white vinegar.

I love this salsa recipe.  The cucumbers really add the freshness.  A friend brought fresh veggies from her garden and I whipped this up.  I made mine spicier than the original recipe.  It was a big hit at our party.  Even those who do not like spicy enjoyed it.

I made it without the canned tomatoes with chiles because I didn't have any.  It doesn't need them.  It was delicious.  Cucs and tomatoes from the garden- very good
