if you like shellfish, this is a great, easy, summer recipe.
the pineapple and shrimp go wonderfully together.
sea scallops (the big ones) are the easiest to use.
highly recommended!

Was not as flavorful as I had hoped it would be.  I have found other marinades for seafood that I preferred.

With some changes this recipe could be a "4."  Sauce is too thin for basting - better as a marinade.  Peppers need more than 5 minutes to cook so grilling them separately or pre-cooking them part of the way before threading them on skewers would solve this problem.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  The only thing I did different was I added bacon wrapped around the scallops on the skewers.  If you decide you want to try it with bacon, par cook your bacon first.  Bacon takes longer to cook than the shrimp and scallops.

I made this recipe as written and everyone thoughly enjoyed it.  Loved the pepper, pineapple and seafood combination. The marinade is subtle, tasty, yet doesn't overpower. Will certainly make this recipe again.  Its a keeper.

it was ok. I would make some adjustments next time. More ginger, less tamari (or soy sauce) add pepper & a dash of olive oil. And I would recommend putting the shrimp/scallops on separate skewers as they have a much shorter cooking time. It's a good base.

It  had potential but really no taste.   I think if it was marninated it would at least hold the taste but this was more of a dipping sauce.

This was OK.  I thought that the sauce would add more flavor but it didn't.  Maybe if the shrimp and the scallops were marinated first.

Fixed this as part of a weekend grilling party.  This was sensational!  Didn't make any changes to it, just served over rice.

This recipe sounded good and the photo is nice, but I didn't care for it.  Pineapple goes great with grilled pork, but I thought it was mismatched with scallops.  Also, the sauce tasted pretty good in the bowl when I made it, but was lacking when put on the food.  It needs more zip.  This recipe looks better than it tastes.

Followed the recipe exactly except marinated everything first. Was pleased with the results, but prefer things a little spicier. Even my "I'll never put a scallop in my mouth" eater, gave them a try and thought they were "pretty good". Next time time I will add some red pepper spice to liven things up a bit.

Wonderful marinade! I used fresh ginger root ( a little extra b/c I love ginger). Didn' have sesame oil so I used a bit of grapeseed oil. It was great on chicken too! Very flavorful!

I grilled these kabobs for Father's Day and they were a big hit. It was a last minute decision and I wanted to save a trip to the store..so I skewered what I had: shrimp, lobster, sausage, pineapple, & zucchini. I wish I had the peppers to add to them tho. The marinade has great flavor.

I made only one addition to the recipe, which was to add some minced garlic to the sauce. The result was quite tasty, and we will definitely be having this again.

A little bland.  I will use soy sauce for dipping the next time I make it.

Yes! Would make it again! Would have done differently: used the larger (Sea) scallops (though the smaller ones still turned out amazing), & put the doubled up pepper pieces on each end to help hold the skewer in better position on the grill. Flavor of sauce did not come through as well as we would have liked. Use as suggested on the side and/or drizzle kebobs just before serving. We used already cooked shrimp too- still awesome!
