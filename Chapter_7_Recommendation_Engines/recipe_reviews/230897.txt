Perfect go to cheesecake!  Very easy to make!  I did a graham cracker crust instead and had different toppings that each individual could add as well as homemade whip cream!

Love this cheese cake recipe. What do you do now that they don't sell Indulgence anymore? I make a chocolate type mousse with cream cheese. I wonder what others do.

Found this recipe a few years ago on the Kraft website.  It is now my go-to Cheesecake recipe...it's by far THE best cheesecake recipe I've had.

I have been making this cheesecake for years! I very much miss the chocolate mousse since they discontinued the indulgence cream cheese. but I use this cheesecake recipe as a base for many flavors or just by itself! SO good!!

This recipe was amazing!! It was such a favorite. Then Philadelphia discontinued the Indulgence product. Why!?! This recipe came up today in my daily recipes email. I was saddened and confused as I'd forgotten about it. How do. You make it without the Indulgence?
