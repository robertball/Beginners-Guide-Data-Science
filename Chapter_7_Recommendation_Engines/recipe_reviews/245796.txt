I mixed premade pesto with the spinach.  I also baked at 350 for 40 mins.  I also find rolling chicken very difficult so I placed the mixture between two pounded chicken thighs and it turned out very well.

My daughter loved this.  She said this is amazing, definitely 5 stars.  The center is creamy and delicious.  I hate microwaved food so I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes.  It came out perfect.  Everyone requested I make this again.
