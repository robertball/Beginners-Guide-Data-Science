ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!  I wanted mine to be completely fat-free though, so I substituted fat-free half & half for both the skim milk and the heavy cream used in this recipe.  I made an additional tweak by substituting the Splenda for all the sugar called for.  For flavor, I scraped the caviar out of a whole vanilla bean into the cooked cream portion and added 1/4 teaspoon of almond-vanilla powder to the milk-gelatin portion.  Topped the desserts with fresh raspberries.  It came out super creamy, flavorful and neither my boyfriend nor I missed the fat or calories at all!

For the ones who had trouble getting the Panna Cotta out of the dishes.  I highly recommend trying a silicone muffin pan.  They work great.

Awesome recipe! I have used it several times over the last few weeks. For anyone having problems with the gelatine separating, I solved this by cooling the mixture down completely before pouring it into the ramekins. Just put it into a jug and keep it moving over iced water until it's cooled down to room temperature. The quicker you get it cooled, the quicker it will set - meaning less time for separation :)

YES! ADD VANILLA AT THE END, AFTER REMOVING FROM THE HEAT(MY SUBMITTED RECIPE STATED THIS).  ALSO, I RECOMMEND STIRRING CONSTANTLY WHILE COOKING THE CREAM AND SUGAR.  SOME OTHER GOOD EXTRACTS: ORANGE, LEMON AND ALMOND.

Perfect recipe. I did use 2 cups of heavy cream with 1/2 cup of half and half because this is what I had in the fridge. I also made mine in muffin tins which I greased with olive oil (did not affect the dessert even a little bit) and then I topped them with hot fudge. This recipe made 8 1/2 panna cottas for me in the muffin tins.

I made this recipe as-is, and served with mixed fruits (strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries) on top. To get them out of the glass ramekins, I dipped them into warm water for just a few seconds, ran a knife around the edge, and turned them upside down on the plate. Beautiful presentation, sure to impress your guests - it did mine! I think next time I will use lemon extract in the custard instead of the vanilla for a different flavor; I see endless flexibility with this recipe!

This is dangerously good. It's my favorite dessert at my favorite Italian restaurant. Next time I will add a little more milk as the consistency was a little too jell-o like. I will also decrease the sugar to about 1/3 cup, it was pretty sweet. I would definitely serve to guests. Thank you Cheryl for posting this recipe!

Excellent recipe - thanks for submitting it.  I've been using it for months now and I haven't found one person who doesn't absolutely love it!  I serve it with fresh strawberries tossed and marinated briefly in a bit of brown sugar and grand marnier.

I made a recipe with very similar ingredients but different directions - this may help those having problems with gelatin separating. Pour the milk/cream you are using into the saucepan and sprinkle gelatin over it. Let that stand for 10 min. Then go to heat it, but only heat it until the boiling point then remove from heat and stir in sugar, vanilla, etc. You can use much less sugar for a good result - 1/4 cup per 2 cups of liquid.

While this was good, it was way too sweet. I just got back from Italy and they make it with far less sugar. The sweetness on theirs came from sweetened berries on top.

sliced fresh strawberries on top are the best compliment to this fantstic dessert.  just be sure to add the vanilla listed in the ingredients section, but left out in directions.  i add the vanilla after the cooking is done - right before i pour it into the serving dishes.

Way too good. Waaaay too good. I entered this in a cook off and everyone was amazed! This is pretty much fail safe too for the inexperienced cook (aka, me). :)  tips: the skim milk is important! The gelatin will agglutinate into chunks that are difficult to dissolve if you substitute it with something with too high of a fat content! It's not impssible, but it's horribly annoying and time consuming to mix! Smear some unsalted butter or veggie oil on the inside of the mold before refrigeration, bang one side of the mold on the table after refrgeration, set on plate, and hit the upside down mold a couple times to remove the panna cotta easier. Shallow molds work better. Silicone molds didn't work for me. Goes great with a berry sauce and mint leaves!!! Pur√©e fruit and simmer over low heat with juice and fruit-flavored schnapps! If you want to garnish with decorative chocolate, melt it, transfer to a sandwich bag, cut the corner, pipette your favorite design on wax paper, and refrigerate! :)  I have tons of fun making panna cotta! I hope the helps you get creative with this versatile dessert too!

Simply delicious! And easy to make. Smooth and creamy. This is a desert you could do a lot with. Springle coccoa on top, cover with berries, sweet chutney, nuts, chocolate sprinkles, etc.

This was the hit of the evening.  It came out of the molds easily and was gorgeous not to mention creamy, rich and decadent.  I used 1/2 cup skim, 1 cup heavy cream and the rest whole milk.  Also, I used honey instead of sugar to make it meet a friends dietary needs.  I would highly recommend the honey!  It was wonderful!  Even my non-cooking guests desired this recipe and ate every bite after groaning that they had no room for desert!  Don't douse it with chocolate sauce, just serve it with a slice of fruit and let the sweet dairy shine through!

Really great recipe! I have had to make some chages due to diet restrictions. I have family memebers who can only have non-fat dairy. This does turn out well with fat-free half and half but I have found that it does not set up the same, it will be alot more jiggly! I have also made this for low carb with splenda. If using splenda I would suggest adding it after you stir in the gelatin and then add extract. Make sure to soften the gelitin in water if you use all cream. Also this is great using coconut milk. I used a whole can. I poured it into a measuring cup toped off to two cups w/ cream then added the other 1/2 cup of cream. Finished it off with about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. coconut extract and vanilla extract. Just taste tested till I got the right flavor. Almond extract is also very good in this recipe if you are making the vanilla version. I have also made with a whole vanilla bean. Just split the bean and put the seeds and the pod in while heating the cream then remove pod before stirring in the gelatin. I also always add about a 1/4 tsp. of salt to cream while heating.

Excellent and EASY!.  Some tips:  -Do NOT boil; only simmer lightly. -Skim milk is key in helping gelatin to dissolve. -When pouring into ramekins, use fine strainer to filter un-dissolved gelatin. -To empty ramekin in one piece, simply set it in a shallow pan of HOT water for a few seconds and flip onto serving dish.  Works every time.  Delicious.  Design your own topping.  Fresh fruits are best.  I like to add lemon juice to balance all the sugar.

This was really really good. I actually only used 1c of heavy cream and used 2% milk in place of the rest of the milk and cream called for, only because thats all I had. It turned out perfect! So creamy and rich, you wouldn't think I had altered it at all. At least it was a little healthier I guess. I served it with slices of ripe strawberries. I'm going to try making a sauce with strawberries & brown sugar and see how that goes. I plan to experiment with this recipe. But awesome as is.

I followed the recipe, however before pouring it into ramekins, I put it in a bowl on top of ice cold water and stirred it until it cooled to room temperature. Then I poured it into ramekins, covered in plastic wrap and put in the fridge. I had it the next morning with macerated raspberries and it was the perfect texture and flavor. No separation. Delicious and easy to make. Next time I'm going to make a mango compote.

Loved this. I doubled the recipe and it worked out fine. I took strawberries that I had sliced with sugar, put about 6-7 raspberry on top of that & finished with whip cream. I made them in dessert glasses. My only regret was adjusting the recipe by adding vanilla bean. The bean mostly settled in the bottom of each dessert glass. I will stick to the recipe as written. I did put the pot in ice water while cooling it down, stirring the whole time. Only took a few minutes to cool this way.

This is a great recipe, very rich and creamy. I avoid turn out troubles by serving it in wine glasses, it's very attractive that way too. I top it with a berry compote I make. I use frozen berries (a mix of blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries is my favorite), cook them down and mash them up a little, add sugar and lemon juice to taste and add just a touch of cream after they are off the heat to give them a great dark purple color. Looks very pretty on top of the white panna cotta in the wine glass.

Fresh cream was on sale for half price today at my coop, and being a sucker for all things rich I couldn't pass it up...but then, what to do with it?  Oh my goodness.  This panna cotta recipe is specatcular!  Honestly, I would have liked to pour it into a cup and drink it straight up...I don't even know how the final set result is, yet, but I imagine it is phenomenal.  I used 2 cups cream and 1 cup milk.  I dissolved the gelatin in 1/2 cup milk and mixed the other half into the cream and sugar (I used 1/3 cup -- still a bit too sweet mabye? will use 1/4 cup next time).  To balance the sweetness I just added a pinch of salt to the mixture.  Perfect.  I added the gelatin to the cream as soon as it softened into the cold milk.  Then I didn't have the patience to bring it all the way to a boil, so I stopped when the mixture was steaming and silky smooth, whisking all the way.  I used the recommended vanilla, then couldn't resist 1/4 tsp. almond as well. Amazing!  I cannot WAIT to eat this up!!

This is so good!  Better than the first time I had it, and that was prepared by Italian chefs!  I used this recipe to fill about 100 small chocolate dessert shells for a cocktail reception. Beyond delicious - I will be making this again, and soon, but full sized.

Very tasty.  I made a few adjustments.  First, I used fat free half/half instead of skim mild.  I also used canned coconut milk instead of the heavy cream and coconut extract instead of the vanilla extract.   I served it with toasted coconut and crushed pineapple.  It was very good.

Great recipe! The custard is super silky smooth, creamy a delicious. The flavor isn't extraordinary, but it's absolutely delicious with fresh fruit...we used strawberries. My gelatin separated a little, creating a thin, slightly more opaque layer on top of the custard. I also didn't have any ramekins, so I poured the mixture into greased muffin cups instead, and filled nine. I had a bit of a hard time getting the custards to come out of the tins. I inverted the pan onto a cookie sheet, and placed a hot, wet towel over the bottoms. This loosened them up, but they wouldn't slide out of the pan until I used a knife around the edges. My family really liked these, and ate them up very quickly. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a keeper!

Absolutely DELICIOUS! My only problem is where a previous reviewer (coinmaster) suggests: "Just put it into a jug and keep it moving over iced water until it's cooled down to room temperature." DO NOT pour it into a glass jug. Trust me on this. My glass jug exploded in the ice and I had a HUGE mess to deal with. Never, ever (and I had forgotten this) use heat with glass and ice. Bad combination. 
I re-made it after an hour-long clean up and another trip to the grocery store ... this time I cooled it in the saucepan that was immersed in a large bowl of ice cold water.

This was very good tho next time I'd probably use a bit more sugar in the cream. It seemed that choc sauce was overkill so I just used a blended strawberry sause - easy and really good. HOWEVER . . . the gelatin separated from the cream (two layers in the finished product)even tho I followed the directions as written. Any thoughts as to why?

Easy recipe and tastes fantastic! I substitute the heavy cream with half-and-half, and I would recommend pouring the cooked custard through a sieve to get rid of bubbles/foam before going into the ramekins to set.

I also made a pomegranate glaze to go with it.

I made this for a dinner party on Valentine's day.  I poured it into silicone muffin pans (12 heart-shaped portions).  I was able to turn them all out onto a pan, and then move them to plates individually with a metal spatula.  I substituted half and half for the cream, and I added an extra 1/3 cup because of the reviewers who complained that it was too stiff and not creamy enough.  It held together but was very soft, so next time maybe I will make it as written and see how I like it.  I also made a simple blackberry sauce to go with it: Blackberries + sugar (to taste), blended and strained.  This I poured into a squeeze bottle so I could drizzle designs around the edges of the plate.
It was very easy, but looked fancy and was delicious!

This dessert has quickly made it to the top of my all-time favorite "go to" recipes for many reasons:  1) People love it!  It never fails to impress.  2) It's rich, yet light. 3) It's easy to make and always turns out.  3) It can be made ahead of time and will keep for at least a week.  4) You can make it into any serving size you like.  5)  It's good plain, but the garnish options are endless.  Who could ask for more when it comes to hosting.

I added some fruit puree to the top so that it would offset some of the sweetness.  Definitely add vanilla at the very end.  I wish I had used the full amount of gelatin called for because mine did not set properly.  However, the taste is amazing.  I ended up with 4 full/tall shotglasses worth of dessert.  Lovely!     ******UPDATE:  I've made so many variations on this including adding pureed fruits to replace some of the cream like pineapple or mango or strawberry or lychee.  You can make coconut panna cotta by replacing half the heavy cream with coconut cream. Panna cotta is a dessert that sounds fancy but is so easy to make.  Most commonly, I've used 1.5oz plastic shot glasses for presentation, and 1 recipe makes about 24 of these small shot glasses.

So easy and so delicious. I think that it could do with a little less sugar and considering how rich and decadent heavy cream can be, using a less fatty milk would probably also be tasty. I followed the recipe 'as-is' and it set just fine for me and came out great. i used a muffin tin since i didn't have ramekins and then just cut around the edges and moved around in warm water a little bit. i will say - ramekins would make the presentation party prettier so i am going to buy.

This was a really easy recipe that worked out well! I didn't have any ramekin dishes, so instead I poured the mixture into coffee mugs. I don't know if it helped or not but before adding the mixture, I lightly sprayed with canola oil spray. They popped out of their molds really easily and neatly and I served with mango slices and passionfruit pulp drizzled on top.

This is a simple, delicious custard.  I make the lighter version using fat free half & half, and splenda.  I also cool the mixture by sitting the pan in a tub of ice and stirring until it is room temperature or cooler.  To make a fancier display I make small cups by forming and baking filo dough in muffins cups.  Then I pour the cooled custard into the filo dough cups and serve them topped with any fresh berries or peaches.  A light, tasty dessert for hot summer evenings!

This was wonderful. As good as the ones I had in London and Paris. Easy to prepare and quite a showpiece dessert when you add a little chocolate and raspberry sauce swirled on a plate.  Made it for Mother's Day and it was the hit of the day....

Too much gelatin- it was like jello. Maybe 2 and 1/2 tsps of gelatin would be enough, instead of 1 tbsp. Also, follow what others have said - do reduce the sugar. I used the reduced amount of 1/3 cup and it was still sweet enough. Also I can't understand how another user used 'fat free half and half'

The recipe is ok as pannacota is always delicious but it is sooo fatty! You can use instead of cream, milk and you can add if it needs more gelatine. Then it will be healthier.

For those of us with Diabetes,use the Splenda and if you are a chocolate fiend like me, add some bitter-sweet chocolate and use the raspberries as a topping. You can also use 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Made it one time using 1/2 tsp coconut extract, 1/2 tsp rum extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Topped it with a mixture of kiwis and mango with a dash of honey and some lime juice to make a syrup. Chef Dave

I was so nervous about making this. Really because I'd never made it before and seeing others make and seeing on cooking shows...surely it's not that hard. And it wasn't. I think the only thing I was worried about was the gelatin setting up. And it did beautifully. The flavor was nice. The thickness of it was soft but yet firm. I can see me making again with different flavored extracts. The one thing, I won't do is try and unstick it from the vessel I put it in. That part I was worried about coming out of the bowls in one piece. I'll skip that dramatics. It's prettier looking in a burgendy still drinking glass topped with fruit any day.

What a wonderful, sinful dessert! I used 2 cups heavy cream and 1/2 cup half & half because I did not have enough heavy cream on hand.  I substituted approximately 1/3 cup granulated Splenda for the sugar, as my husbands parents are diabetic.  When the cream and sugar began to boil, I grated some fresh nutmeg and I poured and cooled in champagne   glasses (not flutes) with a fresh strawberry cut and fanned across the top.  So good!

Had leftover heavy cream which I didn't want to waste. Very easy and tasty recipe for Panna Cotta. I think when making it again I will use the pulp from a vanilla bean for added flavor.  Plated with hot fudge sauce and strawberry coulis (12 ounce package frozen whole strawberries, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup granulated sugar.  Boil for 8 minutes then puree in blender and strain if desired).

Absolutely amazing. I don't bother to use skim milk; once you're using heavy cream, the calories from fat just don't matter. Also, I find that this makes eight muffin cups worth. I've tried topping this with lemon curd, or with blackberry syrup (boil down blackberry wine), but it's pretty awesome by itself, too.

I recently had panna cotta at a resturant and loved it! I tried this recipe and it was wonderful!! Just like the one from the resturant. I am going to try using half and half for some of the heavy cream to see if that makes it a little less dense. I topped it with strawberries. I will definitely make this again!!

Is panna cotta suppose to be that thick?  I've only had panna cotta from a restaurant twice (both times from the same place bc I enjoyed it so much)--and it was much lighter and not nearly as dense.  I guess I was expecting the same consistency. I did use the recommended amout of gelatin and I may cut it down next time to get the right consistency.    I guess I was expecting a consistency more along the lines of creme brulee.  Am I wrong on this?  Thanks.    Oh--and I made a pomergranate syrup to top the dessert off with--and I think that distracted me from the texture a bit.

This was very tasty and easy, however I substituted the milk and heavy cream with fat free half and half as other reviewers suggested and it did not set probably.  It would not hold its form even after an entire day in the fridge.

I've never had Panna Cotta before, but I was very impressed with this recipe.  My only problem was with how sweet it is.  I'll be cutting the sugar back next time.
Edit; I'm going to have to up my rating to 5 stars.  On the first day after refrigeration the panna cotta is extremely sweet.  However, if you let it sit covered for another day or two (covered) in the fridge the sweetness goes way down and the texture gets much better.  It just needs time to settle.

This was fantastic and very easy to make. The only change I made was to use whole milk instead of skim because that is all I had on hand.  I also took another reviewer's advice and dipped them in hot water for a minute before running a knife around the edge and turning over.  They looked beautiful with strawberries drizzled over the top and tasted just as wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

I also had never tried Panna cotta until I made it but decided to give it a try since it sounded so good and was so easy to prepare. The only thing that was a bit off was that the gelatin did separate a bit from the cream when set. (but this was not even noticeable really)
Am I so happy I decided to take this chance! This may easily turn into the dessert that may become a staple in my home. I made this for a group of guys who would not stop raving aobut it. Even my boyfriend who hates custard decided to give it a try and loved it! 
I topped it with fresh mangos which added a perfect balance to the creamy texture. I will try it with different extracts and topping next time as well.

Wonderful! Both the texture and tast were perfect and my guests raved. I served it with pureed passion fruit- a tart fruit went really well with it as it's rather sweet. I will certainly make this again!

I followed this recipe exactly; WOW! It was just fantastic! It was creamy and had a wonderful vanilla flavor to it! I will probably use a little less sugar next time, perhaps a 1/3 of a cup. Otherwise, this recipe is definitely in my permanent list of desserts. It was incredibly easy and incredibly quick, and the end results were both satisfying and yummy! You can't go wrong with this recipe. I finished the panna cotta off with a raspberry preserve/water mixture and spread the sauce over it. My family was impressed! I will take the advice of some of the other reviewers as well and use real whole vanilla beans next time for an even more impressive presentation!

It was easy and good.  Next time I will add alittle more milk - the consistency was a little more solid than I had expected.  Served it with fresh raspberries - it was yummy!

Thank you for a good and easy to follow recipe! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular milk instead of skim. Then I just topped it with fresh strawberries. We loved it! The panna cotta itself tastes delicious and is not overly sweet. You don't even need to top it with anything if you want something simpler. The second time around, I used Thai coconut milk and topped some with a lychee sauce and lychees and some with a mango sauce and fresh mangoes and some fresh Mint. Yuuuum!!! I don't think the coconut milk actually did much to change the flavor though, it just altered the creaminess a bit. Next time I'll try coconut extract instead. I've also tried it with almond extract and I loved that flavor as well.  The flavor combinations and toppings you can do with this are endless! I will be making this again and again! Thank you!! :)

Great dessert.  I add strawberry sauce to it.  I use about 200 grams of strawberry, mix with 2 tablespoons of sugar. Put them to an electrical blender. The excellent fresh sauce comes out in seconds.  It is such a tasteful and beautiful dessert.  I really love it.

Excellent recipe! The only thing I changed was the extract, to lemon extract. The consistency was perfect. I had to make it in one big bowl because I realized I didn't have any little ones of any kind. i just cut it in pieces and they came out without falling apart.

I made this recipe twice this weekend! I used fat free half and half and splenda and it came out wonderful. I added a spoonful of cherry pie filling on top when i served it. Wonderful diabetic recipe & my teenage son loved it also. We are going to try a nutella sauce drizzled over the top next time! Thanks for a great...easy recipe. I made it again & added a dash of almond extract and 2tbs instant espresso...delicious as always

IT WAS GREEEEAAAT!! I had it at my school one time and I was desperate to have more! This is a great recipe! :D My sister decided to make her own too afterwards :D I tried mixing in some blueberry sauce into a few and it turned out alright, but still looking for the perfect strawberry sauce to go with it. I wish I had somehow greased the pan though, it ended up sticking and not looking very pretty. If you get a spoon and scrape it right though its not too hard xD Woo! Deeeelicious.

Excellent; easy to assemble and used cream substitution with half and half.   Will try skim milk next time.  Should taste the same; less fat for a light summer dessert.   Added roasted figs marinated with balsamic vinegar as a topping.  Awesome.

I prefer to use only whipping cream and don't add the milk: isn't low-fat, but the taste is very good.
In place of the vanilla extract I use the seeds: I add them immediately, set with the cream and the sugar.
And for topping? Usually I garnish with caramel.

Absolutely delicious ... and so very easy! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and substituted nonfat half-and-half for all the liquid, and it resulted in a custard with the most decadent mouth-feel. Great summertime dessert when coupled with a few fresh berries ... and easy on the waistline, too!

This was such an easy recipe and a good basis for many other custom versions.  I've made it with 2% milk instead of skim and it turned out fine.  I only had 2 c of cream, so used 1/2 c of half and half.  I like how you can kind of "mix and match" the diary and cut back on the fat if you wanted to.

Very easy, very good and so fun to make. I substituted evaporated milk for the cream and you can definitely taste it but I didn't mind it at all.  I'll try to use cream next time and see if I like it better although, I think this could easily turn into a very low fat dessert.  Since all you need is the gelatin to harden this, I think I'll go with either fat free evaporated milk or light cream next time.  It didn't taste very sugary so I'll leave the amount the same, and maybe use Splenda instead.  I also used 2% milk with great results.  Last thing I did was drizzle sugar free hershey's syrup over the top. Yum! I never had these before, my husband and I had a good laugh at how much they jiggle like jello.  If you want to invert these, put them into custard cups and run along the edges with a knife, then run your knife to the bottom of the cup, invert quickly and it will flop onto your plate.  You can do all kinds of toppings for this thing its completely endless.  Five stars all the way!

I have made this several times & it turns out AWESOME!  Usually I use the 2 cup container of whipping cream & add enough milk to makeup 2 1/2 cups.  I use whatever milk I have on hand for the gelatin.  I use wine goblets & make 4 servings (just 2 of us). I've used the chocolate sauce (with suggested alterations) from this site & frozen raspberries.  No fail recipe. It's so much better than store bought!

Good stuff, though I changed the recipe quite a bit. I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and I add 1-2 tbsp of baking cocoa powder to give it a chocolate flavor (it settles out though, so the top 1/4 inch or so is brown and has a strong rich chocolatey flavor and the rest has a subtle flavor)

This was easy to make, and the taste was great. Served it with hot fudge sauce from eagle brand (posted on this site) which blended perfectly.

Very delicious! We served it for New Years Eve to 12 guests. I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top, added caramelized pecans and a chocolate wafer. My husband had 3 servings!

This was such as easy and simple recipe for my absolute favorite dessert!  It came out perfect texture-wise but it was too sweet even with sugar in raw instead of white table sugar. I also substituted heavy cream with half & half to be healthy, and it came out perfect. Since I didn't use skim milk, I made sure the mix was cold when adding the gelatin in to avoid possible separation. Overall I loved it and will definitely make it again.  I'll try to add some lemon zest or fresh vanilla bean, and most importantly, less sugar!

This is so easy and delicious. Be sure to stir constantly to avoid burning the heavy cream, and also make sure the gelatin is thoroughly mixed in. I doubled the recipe and set it in a 9x12 glass dish. I also topped it with lightly sprinkled cocoa powder and mixed berries. Next time I will try a lighter version with half-and-half and less sugar. I may also try adding coconut extract for a twist.

I made this for company the other night. The only change I made was to use all fat free half and half. Oh, I used my own homemade vanilla and the flecks of vanilla bean made this dessert look spectacular. I topped it with a fanned out fresh strawberry. Amazing. Thanks for sharing.

There are lots of recipes for panna cotta but so far this is the easiest and the best! I loved the simple directions and it came out just as I expected. Trader Joe's discontinued their 2 pack of panna cotta dessert with frozen blueberry and peach sauce on top. Now with this recipe, I can make something similar very easily!!!!

What a great dessert!  We all loved it.  Even my Italian hubby was impressed . . . he used to work for the Ritz-Carlton in F & B, and he said this was as good as theirs!  Such an elegant dessert - and very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I adjusted the recipe so that I did not have to buy excess heavy cream.  I made the servings to 10 and added 4 cups of heavy cream.  It was a bit tricky with the gelatin but I eyeballed the 3/4 of the second package and everything turned out great!  All the panna cotta was gone in just a couple days!

Delicious!  I had recently went to an Italian restraunt where I had a delicious panna cotta with blueberry topping.   A few weeks later I was craving the dessert and ran across this recipe which tastes exactly the same as the one fromm the restraunt!  I also made a blueberry topping by mashing together blueberries, vanilla and sugar over low heat until thickened.

Great recipe!  I added just a couple of pinches of flaked salt to cut the sweetness a bit.  Served with a fresh raspberry coulis and the combination of sweet and tart was just perfect.  I can't wait play around with variations on this fantastic recipe.  Well done.

I am a little confused by the people giving tips for getting the panna cotta out of the ramekin.  Every time I've been served panna cotta (in the States AND in Italy), its been served in the ramekin, just like creme brulee.  I like to make the ramekin part of the presentation, rather than risk damaging the "look" of the dessert.  I guess this only works if you have "pretty" ramekins.

This used to be my favorite dessert to order at the Macaroni Grill, until they took it off the menu. Now I make it at home. Made this version and added hot fudge sauce on top. This is very good with fresh raspberries and fudge sauce. My company loved it!

Brought to a brunch and everyone loved them.  I followed recipe directions closely, only I used a special type of vanilla extract called "crush," which has those little vanilla bean flecks in it.  I divided the mixture into 24 mini nonstick pastry tins..  The next morning, I turned them out onto a platter (with minimal help from running a butter knife part-way around the edges).  I topped them with fresh raspberries & blackberries.  Super Delicious!

I made this for my dinner group this week.  It was extremely tasty, though I wish I had read the recipe the night before and made it well ahead of time.  Because of my lack of time planning, the panna cotta hadn't quite set fully.  I served this in decorative glasses, so I didn't have to worry about getting the shape out of the ramekins (I don't own any ramekins).  I made a rasperry puree sauce (bag of frozen rasperries, little sugar and vanilla, heated to just lower than room temperature) which I dabbed on top of each glass, and then drizzled a little fudge over the top.  It was a huge hit.

this recipe is really easy to do and turns out great. Just a little sweet for my liking, so will reduce the sugar the next time i make it.

I made this dessert today as a trial run for an Italian themed Christmas party I'm planning. Delicious and easy.  I served it with the Italian biscotti from this site.

I was recently introduced to Panna Cotta at a local restaurant in LA.  My husband and I enjoyed it so much that  I decided to try and find a recipe so I could duplicate it at home.  The Panna Cotta the restaurant served had a little softer texture.  However, this recipe is equally delicious and easy to make.  I will definitely try again and add a tablespoon or more of milk to see if I can achieve the softer texture.  I took the advice of another reviewer and dipped the ramekin in some warm water before inverting onto a plate.  Another tip that I read about is to slightly oil your ramekin.  Thanks for the recipe!

I saw this on Top Chef, and decided to give it a try. I made it with Rum instead of the vanilla. Served it with some pureed raspberries with lemon juice as a sauce. We loved it!

I will be making this again. So good and creamy, great even without the berries. Awesome dessert, I made this for my children's teachers for the thanksgiving holiday along with the spinach artichoke lasagna and chicken parmigiana (all from this website). I got rave rewiews on the whole menu.

Just melts in your mouth, it's so good.  Could be eaten plain, or I paired it with the "strawberries in spiced syrup" recipe from this site - very yummy.  I even used Splenda to cut back on the calories.  Couldn't tell.

This desert was delicious and wonderfully rich!  I used a vanilla pod slit down the middle (added with the sugar and then taken out once the cream boiled) instead of the extract.  This speckled the panna cotta with vanilla bits, which looked great and made it more impressive.  I also used caster sugar instead or regular white sugar, and that worked perfectly.

I followed the recipe with the exception of cutting back the sugar to 1/4 cup.  It came out wonderful.  Easy to make.  Followed others with the cut back of sugar and also cooling the mixture in a bowl of ice before pouring into my cups.  I added a strawberry sauce to the panna cotta and it was great!

Perfect.   I was a little worried when I put it in the refrigerator (after about 3 hours) as it was still pretty runny.  But by the next morning, it had set up.  Was able to remove from the molds easily by first dipping in hot water, running a knife around, and then "helping" them out of the molds with a large spoon.  Just put fresh berries and raspberry coulis on top.

Excellent base recipe. For creamier (less jello-y) panna cotta, use 3/4 the amount of gelatin.

I have used this to make earl grey panna cotta- steep three tea bags in the cream as it heats and press bags with a spoon to get all the flavour. This can be done with any type of tea (chai, jasmine, etc.)

Easy and delicious! My  daughter made this for her middle school class as part of learning about Italy - we doubled the recipe. It was very easy. She put it in little ramekins and topped it with raspberries and blackberries. It was a huge hit - the students and teacher loved it.

I accidentally bought a heavy whipping cream instead of a heavy cream. Texture wise it was good but the taste is a little too heavy for me. I will use the right heavy cream next time ok.

tips and tricks for beginners would have been useful. i have to learn the hard way:
- filter any clogged cream
- filter any excess gelatin
they changed the texture into a granulated one, and it was less spectacular (the taste was awesome, no complaints about that). other than that, thank you for the recipe!

It was simple to make, used a whisk so no separation problems with the gelatin, and I followed the directions carefully.  I used coffee liqueur, and will try apricot brandy for flavoring next time.  I had no issues with the sweetness and used fresh raspberries as a garnish.  It was less "rubbery" than when I had it in a restaurant.  Quite rich - so I will toy with lower fat substitutes when it would be preferred.

A hit with my guests, and me!

I follow everything to the T.. and it was good ! Next time, I will reduce the sugar when I serve it with blueberry sauce on top cause the sweetness will come from the sauce. However this was good by itself ( or with fresh fruit on top ) !

I should have read the negative Reviews before blindly following the recipe as-is.  It turned out, as many reviewers have expressed, TOO SWEET as in majority of American dessert recipes.  In Europe, desserts are more delicate and complex in flavour.

I thought it was a bit too gelatin"ee" for me.  
I also cut back on the sugar to 1/4c and it was perfectly sweet.

LOVE it! My go-to recipe for dinner parties, especially when I don't want to be in the kitchen while my guests are at the house. I only use about 3/4 of the gelatin package, however. In my experience, using the entire package gives it just a tad too much gelatin flavor.

I made this with almond milk. A low cal option, and left out the vanilla flavoring because the almond milk has flavor.

The taste was good but I had a yellow layer sediment on the top. Even after mixing it and letting it set, something sedimented below. What could be the reason?

Awesome recipe. The texture was fantastic and it set up really well! I halved the sugar because I wanted a very light dessert and topped it with rum sauce. I will be making this again! It tasted somewhat like tapioca :)

This was fab! I used large whiskey glasses as didn't have the forms and when poured the mixture into them, portions seemed to be extremely small. But these are so rich, that more would've been too much.

I followed this recipe as-is despite my concerns about it being too sweet. But after my panna cottas set in the fridge, the sweetness was perfect. I served mine in wine glasses so I cooled my mixture down by placing the saucepan in the sink with cold water before pouring the mixture into the glasses. I didn't have any problems with separation or anything else! This must be the easiest yet tastiest dessert to make of all time! I'm so excited to serve this to guests.

I LOVE IT!! I made this with my aunt and my whole family asked for more. I made a twist to it, though. I got a pack of Oreos, removed the white thing and I crushed the "cookie" part! 1 Oreo in each serving, so two black things in each. I put the Oreo first, put the mixture, and I froze it. Now I'm just finding a way to be able to turn it upside down and make the Oreo stay still. Thanks for this recipe! Definitely making this again.

So easy to make and so delicious!  I made a sauce with frozen sweet cherries and brandy-soaked blueberries which topped it off beautifully.  I'll be making this often I'm sure.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I did use 1/2 c. milk for 1/2 c. of the cream.  It was plenty rich even so.

I did a tropical take on this recipe. I chopped up some candied ginger quite fine in the bottom of the ramekins. Like Layla, I substituted fat free half and half.  I DID use regular sugar.  Into the boiling fat free half and half went a cardamom pod, an anise pod, half a vanilla bean (with caviar scraped out) and two twists of black pepper, all inspired by Christmas spice cookies. 
Instead of using vanilla extract at the end, I replaced that with good rum. Awesome. I didn't have any, but topping wtih passion fruit or something coconut-y would have been the kicker!

Awesome.  I scaled back the recipe with no problem.  I used fancy desert dishes so no need to try to remove from mould.  Also served as shown with blueberries and a piece of decorative chocolate that I created using melted chocolate and my icing piper.  I think that it is important to use "real" vanilla...the flavour is terrific.

Perfect, and seems to be a somewhat forgiving recipe. I had to use a kettle to warm the bottom of the muffin tin. Served with honey and almonds drizzled over it, next to a big pile of fruit. A very talkative table had a moment of silence to eat it!

Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe!  I made it on a whim this afternoon and it was fantastic.  I only had 2.25c of heavy cream on hand, so I used half and half to make up the remaining quarter cup and it turned out just fine.  I really wanted almond panna cotta, so I altered the recipe to include 1 t. almond extract and only half a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  My family and I loved it.  I made a bittersweet chocolate and Cointreau sauce to go with this, and the combination was great.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this the first time with an open packet of gelatin that was 1tsp short of the entire amount. I served in a decorative dish with strawberries and blueberries since it was more like custard pudding, DeLLLLLLISH ! I have since made with with correct amount of gelatin but still like it better my first way. Have made it many times now as a pudding.

Worked very well for us - made it for an Italian visitor, and he devoured the extra  one that we had made.  We put a layer of crystallized ginger in the bottom of each mold, and served them with slices of pear poached in port.  We were able to set them quickly (an hour or so) by putting them in the refrigerator in a tray of crushed ice.

A little to sweet for me. Next time i make this I'm going to cut the sugar to about 1/3, maybe even 1/4.

But after I added some grapefruit juice on top to cut through the sweetness, It was perfect!

I made this recipie for the first time for all my inlaws at a dinner party. It all went down really well, infact so well they were all figting over the last serve! (no dirty plates in my place!)
Very Easy to prepare, just make sure you do it the night before and let cool completely before covering to put in the fridge.

In school I had an italian project and i had to bring in an italian food.  So i decided to do the Panna Cotta and it was delicious. I got so many compliments on it.  I put choclate syrup and rasberries on them and it was finominal.  So thank you Allrecipes.com for making my 8th grade italian project party a 100!

I made mine low-fat and sugar free.  I used Splenda for all of the sugar but I only used about 2/3 of the amount asked for and it was plenty sweet.  I substituted fat-free half and half for 3/4 of the cream and used the heavy cream for the rest.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to add extra flavor.  It was very delicious, very creamy and I didn't even notice the Splenda.

I made this at Christmas because I was looking for something new to try on my family members.  They do not like desserts that aren't traditional with the holidays, but they all scarfed this stuff down!  Super easy to make & very delicious.  It will be a favorite in our house!

My family loves this. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.    Husband had two of them after a huge Sunday dinner. They were so easy to make.  We ate them out of the ramikins topped with berries.  Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. However, I used Splenda sugar and I could definitely taste it. Next time I will use real sugar.  Made it again (after how many years?), and used 2% milk (instead of skim) and whipping cream (instead of heavy). Tasted FANTASTIC!

So easy and soooo good!  I would actually add a bit less sugar.  Someone suggested using lemon extract instead of vanilla--I can't wait to try that version!  I topped mine with a cherry and mulberry sauce.  Fantastic!

This was fantastic!!  Some notes;  This really does take several hours to set, very similar to  jello, so don't fret.
It's very rich, so use small ramekins or small desset bowls.  Any fresh and juicy fruit on top will add immensely to the dish.  I serve it with the 'double chocolate biscotti' recipe from this site as well.
Thanks for the recipe!!

For a change, I made this with lemon extract instead of vanilla. Great dessert! Can't wait to try more variations!

I never had panna cotta before I made it. Easy to make and wonderful! I made Hot Fudge Sauce from Eagle Brand (also posted on Allrecipes.com), drizzled it over the panna cotta and topped it with strawberries.

Tasted great. This will become a go -to desert in our home.     Used half and half rather than cream to reduce calories  Did not set quite firmly enough, maybe because of the half and half.  Next time will  use a little more gelatin. 
Would cooking longer have helped?
Also, can liquor such as coconut rum be added.

My first experience with panna cotta. Very good! Just a touch too sweet for my taste, so may cut down on the sugar, but the family didn't mind! Had a little trouble unmolding from the muffin tins I used, so probably will use ramekins next time and skip that part. Will definitely be making again!

This was delicious, rich and sinfully good... as-is, it would be a once-in-a-while treat; I'd like to try subbing fat free half-and-half next time as another reader mentioned they did.

Served mine with a fresh raspberry coulis -- divine!

I had never eaten Panna Cotta prior to making this recipe, much less prepared it.  I wanted an Italian-themed dessert to bring to a dinner party where the main dish would be pasta.  This sounded like it would fit the bill and I was right!  It was super easy to make and I had no trouble.  I used custard dishes and was nervous about unmolding the custards onto plates, but they came out great (and in one piece!) after warming them (one at a time) in a pot of very warm water.  My dinner companions were impressed at the presentation (fresh strawberries and a drizzle of balsamic).  Definitely a hit and I would totally make these again.

I made the recipe almost as written (used a vanilla bean instead of extract.) The panna cotta itself is quite yummy and the recipe was very easy to follow. My 4 year old helped. We made a simple blueberry sauce with a bit of lemon to tart it up and it cut any overly sweetness the panna cotta might have had (I only worried due to other comments but didn‚Äôt find the recipe to be overly sweet myself.) I‚Äôd make this again.

The first time I made it without changing a thing.  Next, I did 2 cups cream and 1/2 cup whole milk.  Both were delicious and every time I serve it, friends rave about it!  I topped it with a pomegranate glaze which was spectacular! (Gordon Ramsey recipe)

Pretty good. Halved the sugar because I made a fruit syrup to go with it. Definitely the right decision, but if you're making it on it's own I would stick to the recipe.

I hesitated to make this because I didn't have any skim milk.  After consulting dr google, I decided to boil 1/2 cup of whole milk and remove the skin aka milk fat.  After it cooled, I poured 1/3 cup into my measuring cup to mix with the gelatin. 
Other than using a scant 1/2 cup of confection sugar, I followed the rest of the directions adding the gelatin mix to the boiling cream, stirring the entire time and taking it off the heat at one minute.  If you don't stir the entire time or let the gelatin mix stay on too long, it may separate as some had that issue.
It turned out great!  Family loved it, with strawberries and blueberries on top. I will make this again.

Perfection!! So delightful after eggplant parmesan. I drizzled cinnamon and stewed raspberries on top of the panna cotta and it was divine. I also served it from the ramekins, so it didn't need 4 hours to set--it was ready as early as an hour to an hour and a half of refrigeration.

I didn‚Äôt even know what this was but wanted to make something for a Italian potluck dinner I was going to. I took it a step further and tilted the cups in a muffin tin, filled half with strawberry jello and allowed that to set for about 2 hours then poured the panna cotta into the glass. It looked beautiful. I also added a dash more of vanilla and a tablespoon of honey to it for more flavor!

I had a quart of cream I needed to use so I made this twice.  The first time I made it just as the recipe called for.  It seemed a little sweet, so the second time I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup as some of the others mentioned and this was perfect.  This recipe was so easy and so good.  I ate some plain, I put cut up bananas on it, I put some fresh strawberries on it and then ran out before I got to the blackberries I got to try also.  Darn, I'll just have to make some more.

I've made a lot of Panna Cotta after visiting Italy. I bring it to a boil v-e-r-y slowly, stirring often but not continuously, starting on low-medium for at least 10 minutes and then raising the temp after that. My addition is a half vanilla bean in addition to the extract. It really pumps up the flavor.  If you want to plate the desert outside of the ramekin, use canola oil (or another flavorless oil) to line the ramekins before filling them. Pour a small amount (about 1 Tbsp for 3-4 ramekins) into the first ramekin, swirl it around with your finger to coat the sides, then dump the remaining oil into the next ramekin and continue. Go back to the first ramekin and slide your finger around the ramekin again, removing excess oil. When it's time to plate, run a butter knife around the sides, and hold it under warm water for about 3 seconds (only the ramekin sides and bottom). This will cause the cooled oil to re-liquefy and release the panna cotta. Also, after pouring the hot liquid into the ramekin, cover with plastic wrap immediately to prevent a skin. When covering with the plastic wrap, the wrap must touch the liquid all the way across, again to prevent the skin (which is gross imho). Let them cool on a cooling rack to room temperature before putting in fridge. I think this lets more of the flavor come through. I put them into the fridge on the rack as well to speed up the cooling time especially if they are to be served the same day.

This dessert was a  5***** with my family and friends.   I served  it
With strawberries  and melted dark chocolate swirls on top.  Very classy with little work.  Can't wait to make it  again.

I made it to recipe though I did put a little less sugar since I also decided to put a blueberry sauce on top and it tasted delicious . I did have difficulty getting the panna cotta out but just decide it eat it in the little bowl so less dish to wash and way easier to instantly eat the yummy treat.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  While the flavor was good, the consistency was definitely more gelatinous than any panna cotta I've eaten in a restaurant.  All of our guests loved it, so I'll still give it four stars.

I'd probably reduce the sugar a bit, probably to around 1/3 cup, and play around with adding more cream as again, the texture was just a bit too much like Jell-O.

Came out great! It was sweet on its own and didn't even need any toppings, though I put raspberries on there, which made it even better. It does take the whole 4 hours to solidify, so don't count on pulling it out of the fridge after 3 hours. I'll be making this again!

The only change I made  was to use half and half instead of heavy cream.  It was exactly as we remembered it from Italy.  I had some frozen blackberries, cooked them up with a bit of water and sugar for a topping.  Didn't bother removing from ramekins, just ate them right out of the dish.  Very good!

Made as it and tested delicious I think the only difference I would make would be to place the gelatin in 60 ml of water instead of milk and then heat on stove. Taste like vanilla ice cream but the texture of a cross between custard and flan. I used this recipe to make dessert shooters for a large Christmas party and they turned out phenomenal!

My newest favorite recipe! Delicious--thank you! I used the exact ingredients/measurements and found it to be perfect for me and my family. I also made it using 1 cup of half of cream and 1-1/2 cups heavy cream I guess just to make myself feel a little less guilty. It was indeed good but not as good as all cream. I had a problem with my gelatin splitting even with plenty of stirring in the hot liquid but had skipped running the mixture through a fine sieve. I started using the sieve and have no more splitting.

I never tried panna cotta before at all and the idea of a milk based jello was a little weird. I used this recipe and made some. I loved it. I made a salted caramel cream sauce to go over the top. Very good recipe. Thank you for sharing it.

Great dessert, and pretty simple to make! My family isn't fond of super-sweet stuff, so I took a few comments to help modify the recipe and it came out absolutely fantastic; instead of the half cup white sugar, I did a mix of a quarter cup honey and a quarter cup raw cane sugar. My sister (a frequent visitor to Italy) said it was as good as the nicer restaurant versions - definitely a keeper recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe! I used coconut sugar instead of regular sugar and halved the cream measurement and used coconut cream for the other half and it was soooo yummy! Topped with a strawberry/mango/mint salsa! So good!

I made this recipe but thought it could use a bit of revision to make it better:

1. a little more than half of envelope of gelatin instead of the entire envelope (it was too firm)
2. instead of 1/3 cup skim milk, I filled half of the 1/3 cup with skim milk and the other half with water
3. use only 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
4. with a large spoon, I scooped the hot liquid straight from the stove top into gelatin cupcake cups and chilled in refrigerator overnight.

all in all, a great recipe! if you follow the original recipe, it tastes more like creme brulee than panna cotta. still delicious, but not what I was looking for :)

Great. Made it with whole milk instead of lie milk, and raspberries to top it. Also, I used a bit more vanilla than in the recipe, which turned out very well. Easy, tastes delicious, perfect texture.

I reduced the sugar a bit and added about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest and made a raspberry sauce to put over it.  Delicious!  Everyone loved it and not a bite left over. This is a keeper recipe.  It was very easy too!  I had 5 oz cups and this recipe made 4 of them.  I sprayed them with cooking spray prior to filling and with running a knife around the edge, thye popped right out onto the plate with no trouble.  Perfect presentation with the sauce and a couple fresh raspberries.

The only reason I didn't give 5/5 stars is because my gelatin and cream did separate a bit, but I read other reviews and will try cooling before putting into dishes. Also, I didn't have ramekins so I used stemless wine glasses and it worked perfectly! Came out easily, had great flavor and texture, and I served with raspberry sauce. AMAZING!

reminds me of a cr√®me brulee without the sugar crust- really good, creamy dessert. 
we used alittle less than the 1/2c of sugar- and wasn't overly sweet; whole milk as it's what my kids drink; and 1T of vanilla.
drizzle with honey and topped with fruit, yum!

This is so impressive and could not be easier! Needed something so quick to put together and this was perfect. Followed the recipe to a T and this got rave reviews (father in law ate 2 ramekins in the name of his birthday) and everyone else scraped theirs clean. Served it with a homemade strawberry sauce (boiled fresh strawberries with sugar and water then pureed it with an immersion blender - or you can take frozen strawberries, thaw them and puree them with water and sugar).  I think the only thing that could have made this better would have been a vanilla bean instead of the vanilla extract. Great texture and perfect summer dessert.

I did cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup the second time as it was too sweet like everyone else said. 
This was very east to make, I added the matcha powder the third time (without the vanilla extract) and I thought it was delicious too.

Amazing. Made for my husbands birthday and it was a huge success. No restaurants in our area serve this and he always asks for it so I decided to make it. I only had two cups of heavy cream so I used about 3 tbsp butter and I also didn't have single dishes so I used a muffin pan. They're a little thin but taste so so so delicious. It was super easy and my husband was so happy this was his birthday desert. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely fantastic! I made mine in muffin tins and used a very small rubber spatula to remove them. To cut down on the cooling time I just put it straight in the freezer for about an hour and a half and they turned out perfect. Topped them with freshly made warm chocolate sauce. Delish!

The texture is absolutely fantastic, thick and creamy. I use a little less vanilla than the recipe calls for, otherwise it'd be too sweet.

Easy, simple foolproof recipe. All my guests love it. I also usually serve it with fresh berries. Last time I forgot to buy berries so I took chocolate covered almonds, cut them in half put a few on top with a squirt of whipped cream and Voila! a great dessert.

In addition to the vanilla extract, I added half of a vanilla bean‚Ä¶ Absolutely wonderful! I made it for my family for Thanksgiving & it went over very well, even the kids liked it. A week later I tripled the recipe for an Italian themed party... a little soft but still very delicious! Also, just another cooling tip: I thoroughly washed a plastic milk jug and didn‚Äôt incorporate ice. I kept it ambient, shaking occasionally until it became room temp and then poured it into ramekins.

I couldn't find heavy cream so I used milk. It still come out great. I made this over xmas for the family and everyone love it, especially the kids. However, iIt was a bit too sweet for my liking. Next time, I'll use less sugar.

Super tasty! I really, really loved it with fresh fruit (lightly tossed with sugar). After making this for company (and being gobbled up), I made some again a few days later.

Excellent and very easy to make. I added my vanilla right at the end, though next time I will use a vanilla pod for a stronger flavor.

Served to guests with whipped cream, strawberries and blackberries to rave reviews.  However, it doesn't actually say to add the vanilla extract anywhere in the recipe which nearly resulted in a disaster.  I realized after I had poured them into the ramekins and put them in the fridge, luckily before they had started to set.

My family loved this.  Creamy and good.  Followed directions as written but added in the vanilla extract (not in directions) and served with raspberries and blackberries.

SO delicious. Even though I am so untalented with baking/desserts, I managed to make this one and it tasted VERY good.
