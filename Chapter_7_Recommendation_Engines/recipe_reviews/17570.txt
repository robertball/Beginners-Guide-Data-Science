I would give this 4 stars for taste, but although I selected the 1.5 pound loaf option on the bread machine, when I sliced into it, the loaf was raw in the middle. I tried to finish it off in the oven, but then it was totally over-cooked and tough on the outside. I will definitely make this again, but will try the 2 pound loaf option.

I have made this bread about 6 times. I think it is important to add the ingred. into the machine as stated and NOT to prep the yeast first. Otherwise, it will rise too high and push the lid of the machine open (as has happened to yours truly). It is not really a 'white chocolate' tasting bread (the name is a little misleading), but a sweet bread with a hint of cinnamon. A lovely breakfast bread. Great with coffee or tea.

Definitely a sweet bread and the flavors are very subtle. DH said it was "like candy". Texture was nice and smooth.

Ended up adding 3 tbs. of flour extra from the ingredients as listed to get the "tacky" feel to the dough (it's been very rainy here). Definitely rose too much -- filled my 2lb machine with 1 1/2 lb ingredients listed, but suspect that might be using liquids which were too warm rather than too much flour. Will definitely try again with cold liquids.

Made again with cold liquids. Only had to add 1 tbs of extra flour to get nice elastic dough. Still filled my 2lb machine.

Too buttery for our tastes. The Chocolate Chip Bread I uses only 1 1/2 tsp of yeast, and 2 tbsp of butter and it rose just as high as this one did and tasted just right. May try making this one again, but with less yeast and butter. Still a pretty good bread. It baked up high and fluffy, and soft, too. Thank you for posting.

The final product was a reasonably sweet, but unremarkable bread that disappoints those who are chocolate fans. Not a keeper in the recipe box.

I tried this recipe several times. The only time I got it to work is when my 
3year old turned my 2lb breadmaker off in the middle of the cycle and I started 
again tfrom the beginning.
The dough will rise too high (even when I used 1.5 lb measurements) and it is 
barely done.

I've made this many times within the past few months - I made it for a family event and people keep requesting it. It's amazing. Some family members used it to make french toast!   My only comment is that in my breadmaker, I had to add an extra half-cup of bread flour.

Great bread.  My husband raved about it and without hesitating rated it a 5.  Made exactly as directions stated.  Did not rise too high but just perfect and the consistency of the bread was wonderful.  The cinnamon and the white chocolate complimented each other nicely.  Next time I make it, I may add another 1/2 cup of chips.  Thanks Susan.

Quite good!  It did _not_ shape perfectly, it fell on one side; something is wrong with the recipe's balance.  However, it _did_ taste great, with a caramelly taste where the melted chips were.  It was even better after cooling for a few hours, when the flavours seemed to have permeated.  Make it for your family, but not for company.

Turned out perfect!  I added a lot more chips than it said probably 1/2 cup. I also added a lot more cinnamon...probably 2 more tablespoons, I added the extra in when the MIX in beep went off. My secret : I added powdered French Vanilla coffee creamer. It matched up with it perfect...just a hint extra of vanilla :)  After the bread machine was done kneading/rising I removed it, separated in to 2 loaf pans, let rise again in a warm (100-200*oven) then baked on 325*/350*

Made it with no changes to the ingredients.  I put it on dough cycle and baked it in the oven.  The consistency of the dough looked as if it needed more flour, but I baked it anyway.  It came out great.  I think baking it this way helped to distribute the white chocolate.  We are going to use the rest of the loaf to make French Toast.

I must have done something wrong.  The flavor was wonderful but the texture was coarse and crumbly.  Did not raise well at all.  Will try it again but I think I will just use the dough setting on the bread machine and bake it in smaller loaf pans.

it was ok as a bread, just i was expecting a lot more white chocolate. Also, it sort of bunched up and glued together, it was not at all light and fluffy. i dont think it should be called white chocolate bread, because you got my hopes up.  if i had tasted this bread without knowing it had white chocolate in it, then i would be happier with it.  Am i making any sense?

My daughter and I made this recipe together, well I helped a some as a teacher to my daughter and let her do most of the work on this recipe on her 1st bread machine bread. I saw how easy it was put together...the bread turned out great. The one thing I have to say, if you have a bread machine that does the automatic fruit & nut drop in with watch for it, my machine, doesn't beep, rather makes the dropping noise and I chose to hold off putting chocolate in the machine because I didn't want to clean melted chocolate off my bread machine. So when I heard the machine do it's little drop lid action, I quickly opened the machine and dropped the chips in & we went to bed. In the morning we checked the machine and saw a beautiful loaf, nicely golden brown. Removed it from the machine and it felt soft to the touch, easily sliceable and smelled terrific. The overall taste was quite nice and there was no evidence of white chocolate chips anywhere in the bread(as far as seeing chips or streaks of white chocolate). It had a mild sweet delicate flavor and a hint of sweet cinnamon. The bread looks of a light honey wheat. And half the loaf was gone before my kids left for school. My daughter was pleased with the taste as well as everyone else that enjoyed it. Now I'll have to make another loaf. TY for the recipe, it's a keeper. Oh one more note to others. Warm water and warm milk is best if the temp is about 105-110 degrees. And select the 2lb option on your machines.

Agreed with most of the reviews below. Something might have been wrong with the recipe. It rose too high and seems to be too big in my 2-pound capacity bread maker. I reduced the yeast to 2tsp (1pkt=2 1/4ts), used room-temperature milk instead of warm milk and increase the salt to about 1 1/2 tsp. After removing from pan, it collapsed like a balloon. Despite all this, the taste was rather good. Sweet and "cinnamony" although one wouldn't have guessed that there's white chocolate inside.

The taste was all right, but not even remotely chocolatey. Mostly it tasted like cinnamon. Also the loaf broke in half when I took it out of the bread pan, even though I did reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe after reading the other reviews. All in all I was pretty disappointed, I threw most of it out. I might try it again with dark chocolate chips, but even still the recipe is not properly proportioned.
