This was good but not enough brandy and creme de cacao.  Use good ice cream but I could have left out all the milk, maybe it was me or the brand of ice cream.  Pour chocolate syrup in a glass as you twirl it to make a pretty presentation.

The recipe is good, but I added more brandy and creme de cacao. I put in the correct amount of milk, but it made it too liquidy for our taste. I would cut the milk amount in half.

I found this recipe rather tasty!  I do think a little more brandy was needed.

Yum, yum and yum! It tastes so good, there is a tendency to forget alcohol is involved. I'll certainly be making this again!
