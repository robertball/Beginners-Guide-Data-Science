I used steel cut oats and definitely found the first try following the recipe exactly to be too dry. Tried again with an extra cup and a half of water plus a handful of frozen cranberries and it turned out delicious!

Add 1 3/4 cups water to make this recipe great!

I have made slow cooker steel cut oats dozens of  times over the years. Buttering the inside of your cooker before adding your ingredients is a must. Depending on your cooker, I have found that 4 hours on low is plenty of time. Longer times will either burn or create a thick crust which, in all likelihood, you'll have to throw out.

I made this for a large group. I added an additional  1 3/4 cups water. It was a 
little dry, but good. The bottom burned a bit but I just removed those parts. I used honey instead of molasses.
People added hot water or milk to taste.

I was worried about adding so much spice but it is wonderful. I do have a faster cooking crockpot and had to double the water. My husband would prefer that I take the peelings off the apples next time but I am fine with them. I loved that this recipe was made with the rolled oats that I had on hand already. I will make this for our next church breakfast.

I like the flavor but it was pretty dry. Next time I'll add extra water. I think this recipe could be fun to experiment with other fruit, nuts, etc.

I took the advice of others and added an extra 1 1/2 cups of water.  Thank goodness I did because it would have been a dry mud cake otherwise.  I cooked it on low for 5 hours and it came out glooey and too thick.  I thinned it down with a lot of milk, but it was still only blah.  I will move on to one of the steel cut oats recipes next and see how that works.  I don't think the rolled oats work well overnight.

Not only did this turn out a gluey-on-top and burned on the bottom mess, but it cracked my porcelain crock pot (yes, it was on low).    I sampled the stuff in the middle and it was too spicey for my taste.  I did add the extra water some suggested but it was still too dry.

The taste was odd, maybe the molasses... I'm not sure. Not a big fan of this oatmeal, sorry.
