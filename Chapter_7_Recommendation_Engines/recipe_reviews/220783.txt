Quick for sure but missing a great deal in flavor complexity perhaps a creamy homemade sauce. The enchilada sauce on its own just wasn t enough to carry this. I pretty much just tasted enchilada sauce. In a last minute attempt to improve this once it came out of the oven I quickly made a sauce of chicken broth salsa verde and sour cream. It was only a marginal improvement.

I enjoyed trying this recipe last night. It is quick and easy and very versitile. I used two 6oz bags of cooked salad shrimp and did add a 6oz can of white crab meat drained. I also added a 4oz can of diced green chilis and a tablespoon or so of Penzey's Bold taco Seasoning to spice it up a bit. The filling was a bit wet my fault I'm sure with the additions so I had to cook it down quite a bit. But the result was rich and tasty. Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

My family loved this recipe. I doubled the "filling" since I have teenagers and they love to eat. I couldn't find green enchilada sauce at the store I went to so I got regular enchilada sauce and salsa verde and used 1/2 can of the regular and a whole can of the salsa verde. I thought the enchiladas would be bland because of the cream cheese and shrimp but these were really great. Everyone in my family could not say enough good things about them. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was looking for something to do with pre-cooked shrimp that I bought by accident. This was awesome! Hubby says make again anytime. I didn't have cilantro so used parsley and used lemon juice instead of lime but I think the original ingredients would be even better. I put about 1/2 cup of shredded Mexican cheese on top before baking as directed. Garnished with sour cream and next time will add olives chopped tomatoes and green onions on top. Yum!

The shrimp was a fun change from regular enchiladas. I used red sauce instead of green and they still turned out good.

I also thought these would be bland but they had a lot of flavor. I used 12 oz small shrimp and 1 can crab meat. I got 4 small enchiladas out of it.

Really was easy and quite good but I also think it needs tarting up. Perhaps adding some green peppers.

We tried this recipe and were very pleased. We breaded and pan fried some Tilapia that we blended with the shrimp to fill the seafood enchiladas. We also breaded and pan fried a chicken breast that we minced to fill a few enchiladas with chicken for those that aren't seafood fans. We added extra cheese on the top of the enchiladas a few minutes before removing them from the oven. We served red beans and rice instead of refried beans. We also served sour cream salsa and guacamole on the side for individual taste.

Easy enough & a nice change from chicken enchilada's. I've made this 2 times now (1st time I messed up on). Wouldn't change a thing except maybe use a little less green chile enchilada sauce depending if I make ahead of time & refrigerate it or just make & bake. The 1st time I tried taco seasoning as some mentioned but I wouldn't do that mistake again. If you want some seasoning then maybe try a jalapeno pepper or Old Bay. I don't think I'd still use either cause I liked it just as is.

Sooo easy! Tasty too! I used corn tortillas instead of flour because we have a wheat allergy. Just warm the tortillas in the microwave for a few seconds then wrap them as stated. Will make again and again!
