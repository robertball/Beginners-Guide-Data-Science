We really enjoyed this.  I was trying to use some veggies before they went bad, so I used yellow bell peppers, green onion and halved grape tomatoes.  Like another reviewer, I cooked my rice in chicken broth.  Then I just tossed it with the veggies and cheese, added some garlic powder and baked at 350 until my entree was done.  I will definitely make again and probably continue to experiement with this basic recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This is outstanding as written. I was short of onion, so I added "onion-onion" seasoning which adds garlic flavor also. Hubby loved it too, so next time I'll make more. When I make brown rice I make extra, so it is waiting in the refrigerator for the next time.

what a great idea to add cheese...all i did was use chicken broth instead of just plain water and stir in the cheese when it was done - i didn't have any peppers. it was very tasty - i've made it twice in the past week.

Very tasty!  I used Minute Brown Rice-don't have the patience for conventional & salted the water with garlic salt.  I also added broccoli, mushrooms and diced zucchini.  It was a  bit dry so I added some chicken broth.  Even the non-rice lovers ate it all-proof that everything tastes better with cheese!

An easy and tasty recipe :) I usually add some broccoli to mine and everyone loves it - especially my 4 yr old who LOVES broccoli! Next time, will try mushrooms and the bell peppers :) This also makes a great stuffing for boneless skinless chicken breasts ^_^

Yummy! I made a few changes which is why I only rated 4 stars. I didn't have bell peppers, but I had so many jalapeno peppers from my garden. I added one jalapeno pepper chopped. I sauteed the pepper and onion and added about a cup of frozen broccoli which I let thaw slightly. I also boiled the rice in chicken broth to give more flavor. This is a keeper!

I wanted to use up some green onions, so I used them in place of the red onion and tried adding a garlic clove. It was good!  I made it for just one serving and enjoyed it.

A wonderful alternate to what can sometimes taste like cardboard! I make it with chicken bullion instead of plain water, and add about a 1/4 cup more liquid than suggested. I then also add about a 1/2 can of mushroom soup, and spread the rice in a casserole dish (prepped with Pam) before putting the cheese on top of the dish. Then I put the dish in the oven on about 425 degrees until the cheese is melted and a little golden. It's absolutely to die for!

This was creamy and had good intentions, but it was a little bland for us. I will probably make this again, but tweak it for flavor. It's not bad though.

This was very plain and really had no flavor. My family did not like it at all. Would not make this one again.

This is great.  We were out of brown rice (someone overlooked this in the store :-)) and substituted arborio rice.  It worked great.  (you do have to soak the arborio rice in your water for 20 min. before you cook it for 15 min.) but it takes the cheese very well.  One time we were out of cheddar and used the dreaded processed. . . it worked too!

I made this for a side dish tonight. I thought it was really good. My family also liked it very much! The only thing I will do differently is cooking the peppers and onions longer. There is a fine line between cooking them nicely and over cooking them. I will make this again!!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

made as directed adding cooked chicken.  Extremely tasty with the cheese.  I will be adding cheese on a regular basis to my brown rice.  Amazing how good it tastes bringing boring brown rice to popping yum-yum.  The onions and peppers gave a sweet balance.  This is a super easy recipe that you will make over and over again.

After reading reviews, I decided to help try to fight the blandness by sauteing half a medium onion and 2 cloves of garlic in oil for making 2 servings of rice.  When the onion was soft, I added 1/3C brown rice and sauteed a few minutes.  Then I added a little under 2/3C chicken stock and a handful of frozen peas and carrots (skipped the bell pepper).  Brought to a boil, covered, reduced heat to low, and simmered 45min.  Then stirred in a few handfuls of freshly shredded medium cheddar.  If you want better flavor, you have to use medium or sharp cheddar.  Added sea salt and white pepper to taste and it was pretty good.  I might go with the sharp cheddar myself next time, and maybe use broccoli florets instead of peas/carrots.  Could also add diced carrot to the onion saute for flavor.

This is my go-to side dish for anything grilled! The bell peppers are a fantastic touch that really make the flavors pop out. Will often use a little chicken broth instead of water.

I absolutely love this dish. I use chicken broth instead of water to prepare the rice and even add a tad of cayenne pepper (barely a pinch). With the peppers & onion, added mushrooms, a couple garlic bulbs. First time I made it, I added the cheese, it was great. Now I make it without adding the cheese, don't want the extra chloresterol. 
O I use cocoanut oil to saute the peppers, etc.

Nice simple way to add a vegetable to a brown rice side.
Used vegetable broth instead of water & instant brown rice to cut back on the cooking time.  Also used 1 1/2 peppers & scallions.
Will try different seasonings next time - I can see how some might find it bland, especially since plain brown rice doesn't have the sodium like other rice side dishes do.

Try this recipe with various vegetables (your taste), sesame seeds,  and a little soy sauce for extra flavor.  My kids used to love it with salsa and nutritional yeast on top.  I know that signs strange, but it's delicious!

We enjoyed this very much!  I didn't have any green pepper, so I added a bit more onion.  I added 1 packet of Sazon Goya seasoning, which was very good, but I can tell that I would have liked it without it as well.

This is a great recipe to spice up brown rice.  I'm trying to incorporate brown rice into our diet and my husband and son are having trouble with the taste difference, but they both loved this recipe.  I didn't have any red onion, so I chopped up a white onion, but will definitely buy a red onion to try this next time!

After reading several reviews I used chicken broth instead of water and I'm glad I did. It would have been way too bland just using water.  I  also added onion and garlic powder  but it was still lacking.

I've made this twice, making some tweaks both times, and it's delicious. I use trader joes frozen brown rice because I don't have 45 mins just to make rice! I also steam some frozen veggies (spinach, broccoli, chopped kale, etc) and then add them to the pan with the onions and bell peppers. Lastly, I use whole fat cheese because fat free cheese just doesn't melt well enough for me. I make up for the cheese by loading up on the veggies!

The amount of water may be too much. I overall did not care for this side dish.

This was good, but not great. It is a little bland. I sautéed onion in olive oil, used minute brown rice cooked in chicken broth and then added broccoli and cheese.  I think it would be better with the addition of garlic and pepper. Kids and hubby liked it.

I'm watching what I eat so I have switched to Brown rice ..came across this recipe ... totally simple and tastes yummy ! I used extra sharp cheddar. My daughter suggested adding some diced grilled chicken but this recipe is so versatile it can be a side dish or make it a main dish ! YUM

This was a big hit with my husband, even as a main course.  I made mine with sautéed mushrooms, onion and green pepper, and it was delicious!

a little bland and dry as is.  i even added 2 cloves of garlic with the veggies, and a little butter and a splash of 2% milk along with salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese toward the end.  i will try to work with the recipe, though, because i like the idea of sneaking veggies into rice.

Outstanding....I used regular cheddar cheese and sharp cheddar, going half and half. Also added broccoli with the red onions and bell pepper mix. Add this with fresh string beans and carrots sautéd in coconut oil with garlic and you got you self a very tasty meal...YUM
