One of my go-to potluck recipes. I usually increase the cheese to an obscene amount and add a good amount of hot sauce. This always disappears quickly. The best thing about this recipe is that most of these ingredients are usually on hand and it makes a quick snack for hungry husbands/kids who want something to snack on RIGHT NOW.

While I did make a few changes, the basics were there.  I couldn't find Mexican corn locally so I used two cups of thawed frozen corn and one small can of diced green chilies. I used sliced green onions instead of shredded onions.  I also added a drop of hot sauce, a few shakes of dry Taco seasoning and a LOT of shredded cheese.  This is an excellent, quick dip.  Thanks for posting!

This needed a bit more zing for a Mexican dip.   It would be easy to fix but as written just came out to bland for us.

My boyfriend sat down with this dip and next thing I know the bowl is empty. I need to add a spice to give it bite though and haven't figured out what to use yet. But it is sooo good
