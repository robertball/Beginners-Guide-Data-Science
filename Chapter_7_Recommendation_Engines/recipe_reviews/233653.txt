I LOVE this recipe! The desert is cool and refreshing and light. If vanilla wafers aren't around a classic graham cracker crust also works well. Make sure you use pasteurized eggs and fresh strawberries make a beautiful finish to the top!

This is my husband's favorite recipe known simply as 'pineapple squares'. I searched high and low for the recipe which used to be on the box of vanilla wafers. I make it with whipped cream instead of non-dairy whipped topping and the pecans add an extra special touch. Definitely a keeper!
