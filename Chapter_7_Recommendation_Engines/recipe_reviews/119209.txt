I have to say that, for me at least, this recipe was a nightmare to make.  Midway I realized that the directions were completely off.  The milk, sugar and cornstarch got VERY thick VERY fast--it was sticking all over the bottom of the pan and by the time I added the eggs in there was no way that blob would ever have come to a boil of any sort.  I turned the stove to low and added the butter and lemon peel while still on the heat, let it melt and mixed it in...then stirred in the lemon juice, upped the heat and let it come to just barely a boil--only to ensure that the eggs were cooked.  I let this cool and folded in the sour cream.  Despite all the trouble and panic (and the pan-scraping that ensued to get the lemon sludge off) the filling tastes delicious.  But it's just not worth the trouble...sorry.

This is my absolute favorite pie. It is the perfect balance of texture and tartness. My favorite sour cream to use is Tillamook. My mom has been making this pie for years and she always gets rave reviews. Follow the recipe and put the diced chunks of butter in AFTER it is off heat. The cold butter helps it complete the creamy pudding texture, just like in any homeade pudding method. Thanks for posting!

First, I have to say that I love to bake, and trying new things is always a good time. That being said, I had never made anything similar to this tart, and had never had to temper eggs, and was a little nervous about it. 
Wasted time, that being nervous! The cornstarch, sugar, milk combo did just what it was supposed to - I simply took my concoction-covered spatula and stirred it in the egg bowl a few times and that seemed to work perfectly. 
Two things of note - I didn't think to cut up the butter beforehand, which made it take longer to melt... and it's really hard to tell something is boiling when it's so thick - definitely something to watch out for if you aren't used to this type of recipe (which I'm obviously not!)
Ended up with a beautiful, creamy tart... I would have preferred a little more of that lemon 'zing', but DH thought it was fantastic - especially with the Feench Tart Dough crust and a dollop of homemade whipped cream. Will definitely be making this one again!

This has a really excellent flavor, and even tasted good before folding in the sour cream! I did find it a little awkward stirring in the butter and lemon juice after the mixture had thickened. Next time I will try adding the (softened) butter and lemon juice before heating.

Overall guests enjoyed the taste and texture of this dish. Some said the level of lemon flavoring was perfect whilst a few said it was too mild. I would definitely make this again.

I followed all directions, with the exception of alittle less lemon rind, about a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon. It was sooo good. I made it about three times so far.

This lemon tart is even better than my aunts :). But I have to say I cooked everything on low heat, it took longer that way but it didnt make a mess. I only had 1/2 Cup of sour cream so for the other 1/2 Cup I added plain yogurt it was soooooooo good

I am on a big lemon kick lately, and the picture alone made my mouth water. I ended up making this for a little dinner party with some friends Friday night and they were raving about it. I didn't change ANYTHING in this recipe, came out fantastic. Would be interested in a healthy substitute for cream cheese, though. Wonderful!

Oh this pie is so delicious! No alterations needed on the recipe. Perfect as is (just remember to have your butter cut up before you start so that it's easily incorporated)!!!

This was a HUGE hit at my Dad's 50th birthday party.  I made the tart into tartlettes, used fresh squeezed lemon juice, topped with homemade whipped cream, and garnished with fresh blueberries.  I've already had a request to make these from a coworker for her family party.  I will definitely be referring back to this recipe!

I took this to a dinner party, and everyone was raving about it! Very easy to make, and is best when served after being chilled for 3-4 hours.

Combined all the ingredients for the lemon "curd" into a microwave bowl and microwaved at 80% power until it got nice and thick, about 4 minutes. I stirred with a whisk about every minute. Let it cool for about an hour then stirred in the sour cream. I made them crustless and poured into 6 ramekins. I accidentally did an extra 1/4 cup of milk and it still worked fine. I was wanting this to have a lot more lemon tang to it. The milk and sour cream really tone the lemon down. I also used fat free sour cream. My family loved this recipe. I like more tart lemon flavor.

The people at work raved about this tart! I have an order for one - a friend asked me to make him one - he said it is the perfect blend of sweet and tart.  I used a little less lemon zest but otherwise followed the recipe.  I added some candied lemon slices as decorations.  Tasted good and looked pretty too.

I found a gingersnap crust recipe that complemented this tart beautifully.  Another variation I love is using Trader Joe's Coconut Thin cookies for the crust!

for flavor I give a 5 star.  This recipe is difficult to prepare and takes alot of stirring and watching.  There has to be an easier way out there to achieve this without and the hassle.  But in fact it was tastey and the perfect compliment to my homemade whip cream and tartshell

Love this lemon filling. I make sure to have all of the ingredients measured and ready before starting to cook. I left out the sour cream once, and it was still delicious, but the sour cream makes it special.
