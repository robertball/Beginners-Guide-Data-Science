This has been my go to  for school sports Pasta Parties the day before events.  BUT it is not Pizza Pasta without pizza sauce! I include a small can of Pastorelli Pizza Sauce mixed with enough spaghetti sauce to make it taste more like pizza and not just a pot of spaghetti.  The small can is enough as it is more acidic and stronger then the spaghetti sauce.  I only use black olives and mushrooms as they can be picked out and I am allergic to green bell peppers and they are not a kid friendly flavor.  Kids are always happy when it is MY turn to host!

Very yummy comfort food. Great for family dinner and potlucks. A twist on pizza, lasagna, and spaghetti. One recipe will feed a large family or big appetites. Easy and quick to make and uses ingredients usually on hand. Works well with "regular" sausage or even hamburger. I've made just as written and also adjusted vegetables to taste. Both times were equally good.

I loved it even though the only veggie I had was black olives.  Can't wait to make it again with all my favorite pizza veggies.  Satisfied my pizza craving with no pizza place or frozen pizza in sight.

Use any other prepared sauce than Ragu.  Ew!  I used ricotta instead of cream cheese and added it just before putting the sauce in the past.  Also added garlic and a shot of Worcestershire to the sauce,  and added cooked Italian sausage crumbles along with pepperoni to the top.  Don't be afraid, experiment!

This is like my version of pizza casserole, without the cream cheese or sour cream, which I have made numerous times over the past 20 years. It's a keeper, and works very well for a crowd at a potluck or picnic. I also use extra sauce, mix all together, put in a 3 qt.casserole dish  and bake for approx. 20-30 minutes in oven.

I'm not necessarily a pepperoni pizza fan since I prefer hamburger, but I did make this and thought it was "right on" for flavor. It's obviously not a pizza but the taste of one was clear. I added some garlic with the onion, and didn't have any black olives (which I haven't ever had on a pizza) but thought that this was very good and will make it again, either with pepp., sausage, or hamburger. I use my friends as guinea pigs for un-tried recipes and they also thought it was a "keeper."  Thanks!

I actually made this before I found this recipe but I did a few things different.  On the bottom of the pan, I added a layer of shredded Parmesan.  I used sweet Italian sausage and a Hillshire Farms hot Kielbasa and added some crushed red pepper.  I  added a little brown sugar to the meat the last few minutes of cooking.  After putting the first layer in the pan, I added 5 ounces of Blue Cheese along with a good layer of mozzarella.   Then the second layer of pasta, topped with more mozzarella, shredded Parmesan and a cup and a half of a good crunchy panko.

Yes, Plan to make this again!   Substituted 1/4# ground beef (browned) for the  sausage. I really liked the way the cream cheese  smoothed out the flavor.  This recipe is a winner- and easy too!

I loved it, but our 5 year old said it was spicy. She liked it, though and ate it twice. I went a little light on the amount of pasta and it still made enough for 8.

Great easy dish. I only used about 8 ounces of tomato sauce because that is all I had and it turned out really well – I think 28 ounces would be way  too much. I omitted the green pepper and olives as I don't really care for them.  I used shredded Asiago cheese vs.  mozzerella.  15 minutes in the oven is the perfect amount to melt it all together.  The key two ingredients are the sweet red onion and cream cheese which I  used more than suggested. Easy and tasty.

Pizza Pasta Bake Haiku: "Very kid-friendly. But made without the cream cheese. I'd rather pizza." Taste was good, but I think I'd rather have all of those ingredients on pizza crust in my hands rather than mixed in w/ penne pasta. Did everything as directed other than not having cream cheese, and my daughter loved it, and I thought it was yummy, but not enough to go out of my way to make again.

I’ve made this three times so far. Twice today and I’m taking one to friends. This is very good!! My family loves it. I have used different spaghetti sauces and I used rotini noodles. I like these noodles because they grab the meat sauce well. I’ll continue to make this one on the regular!!

I did a half a recipe because it’s just my husband and me. I think it’s a very good recipe but dividing it in half may have changed things a little. I thought it needed more sauce for the amount of pasta. I didn’t have black olives which I’m not a fan of anyway but next time I will add mushrooms. I used mini salad pepperoni because I had them. It’s a good change from pizza or pasta. I love the combination.

This is really good! I did not use olives, not a big fan.  Used an orange bell pepper.  I think the pepper helps with a great flavor - a little more unique than standard lasagna or spaghetti.  But familiar enough for the kids to like.  and you just can't go wrong with Italian sausage and pepperoni.  outside of what we did above, I followed the directions as written using rigatoni noodles.  This will be a house hold go to.  Again, this is a pasta dish that has a flavor that stands own its own.  I have made many pasta dishes using marinara sauce where they all basically taste nearly the same.  This one really stands out!

Very good. I used penne and some Barilla sauce that I had. Added a half a teaspoon of ground garlic. Will make again. I want to try adding salami the next time.

We really enjoyed this. But we only put in about half the pasta. We also broiled the top a little after it was done baking.

This was super easy. I usually split this into two pans and freeze one to use for a future date. My husband and my two little boys (ages 4 and 1) love this recipe and they are very picky eaters. The only change I made was I used 3 cups of cheese instead of 2 because I have a deep and abiding love of cheese. :)
Thanks for sharing recipe!

Excellent delicious dish! Will definitely be making again. I used a 5 oz bag of mini pepperoni instead of cutting the pepperoni up. Thanks for the recipe!

It's good, and easy, but a pound of pasta is way to much for the sauce that gets made. 
Fun recipe and the possibilities are endless... Thanks for sharing!!!

This was so good and easy to make, what’s not to love!!  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I added a chopped yellow onion while I was browning the meat.  I used two different jars of spaghetti sauce, one was a mushroom spaghetti sauce and the other was an Italian sausage sauce with peppers and onion.  I mixed some pepperoni in the casserole as well as on top.  My family raved over this dish.  My husband ate the left overs and said it taste even better as the flavors really melded and intensified.  I will definitely be making this again!!

Absolutely amazing!! Didn’t change one thing about the recipe. My boyfriend says it is one of the best things I’ve cooked thus far (I’ve been cooking for him for 6 years) . Definitely recommend... and will be making again.

A big hit with the family! I did make a couple changes, however. I couldn't find any pepperoni that wasn't full of chemicals at my local grocery store, so I added an extra 1/2 lb of pork sausage instead. Also, the inner cheese layer I used provel (not provolone, provel is a St Louis area cheese) cheese instead of both cheese layers being mozzarella. I also added a liberal portion, prob a tsp or two, of granulated garlic to the meat/sauce mixture. It came out fantastic! Thanks for the recipe!

Loved.  Loved loved loved loved loved.

This is a great base recipe.  I did add a little to the recipe, but I'm sure that this would come out perfectly.  It sounds like a lot of work initially, but really isn't.  All of the toppings are interchangeable.  Make this like you would a pizza you would want to eat.  Have a little fun with it!

I'm pretty definitive on what I like on my pizza, so I followed the recipe but also added 8oz. of sliced mushrooms to the skillet.  I used dried minced onion and red pepper flakes as opposed to fresh (due to a food allergy issue), and I think I used 2 small cans of drained sliced olives and a whole pack of pepperoni, quartered.  And go ahead and just double the mozzarella.  I used a loose spiral pasta (I'm sorry, I don't remember which specific type).  It reheated beautifully without getting too mushy, and it's very hearty!

TASTY RECIPE. THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS I ADDED A LITTLE BIT OF FRESH PARMESAN, AND MUSHROOMS. THIS RECIPE IS SO FLEXIBLE TO ADD OR DELETE WHAT YOU WANT. HAVE FUN WITH IT AND MAKE YOUR OWN PIZZA CREATION. THIS IS A KEEPER!!!!!!
P.S. TO THOSE THAT DON'T LIKE IT WHEN COOKS CHANGE FROM THE ORIGINAL RECIPE...LIGHTEN UP...IF IT WASN'T FOR COOKS CHANGING THINGS WE WOULD NEVER HAVE NEW RECIPES. JUST SAYING....

I made this recipe as is for my family and they loved it! I used linked Italian sausage and just cut it up into slices and they loved that rather than the ground sausage. An easy meal that's great for leftovers too!

Yes I will make it again.  I would add more meat either more sausage or add 1/2 pd. Of hamburger.  I would use only 12 oz. of penne or ( your preferred pasta)  I would also add mushrooms.  Very enjoyable and easily serves a family of 5-6!
With leftovers...! I also served a tossed green salad with Red Wine Vinaigrette....??

I prepare frozen home cooked meals for my step-daughter with leftovers and what's on sale. This has become a favorite for all of us. I used ground pork instead of sausage but added Italian seasoning to the meat. And made the rest to the recipe. Great when made and after freezing. Thank you!

It was really super, the teens I served it to, loved it. I took the liberty of adding Zucchini to the sausage as it was cooking,  sine there is plenty this time of year. Imagine my delight when I found little pepperoni's about the size of a dime to sprinkle over the top.

Used green olives instead of black (family preference, not mine) and chopped up tomatoes with pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. Very good. Chop up olives finer next time. Maybe add some hamburger so it's not so "sausagey".

Yummy and easy-will make again for sure.
I did change a couple of things just because it's what I had on hand, a bit healthier as well.
I used Al Frecso brand chicken sausage (sweet Italian) and low fat ricotta in place of  the cream cheese ( so a little healthier). I also add the sauce (use your favorite) and ricotta and a bit of the mozzarella to the pasta and mix til smooth and creamy then add the other ingredients and mix. I then added to baking dish and topped with more mozzarella, topped with the chopped pepperoni and sprinkled with oregano and baked til warm and bubbly.

I added 4 chopped cloves of garlic, subed the green pepper for an allapeno and red pepper flakes and added chopped mushrooms in the mixture.

A very good stick to your ribs dish. Yeah, i also used the whole box of cream chesse. This is a keeper

And use a really good pizza sauce.

I made this as a gluten free version and it was so yummy! The only thing i would change is to use ground sausage instead of cut up sausage links that i used. And i forgot the pepperoni. All in all it was very good!
