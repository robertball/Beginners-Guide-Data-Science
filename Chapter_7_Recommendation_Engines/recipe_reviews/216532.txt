Great cocktail! I also took the recipe picture, which is not quite right, I admit--I used cherry liqueur (which is deep ruby) instead of maraschino liqueur (which is clear like grappa). A couple drops of liqueur de violet will give it the old pale sky-blue color. Also used slightly less lemon juiceâ€”b/c I like it in the background, adding just a touch of brightness.

This is sour/bitter.  I couldn't find maraschino liqueur (was told that it is an "old time" thing) so I used maraschino brandy.  I did a little research on both the liqueur & brandy and found they are quite  similar because both are made using the cherry pits (which is where the bitterness comes from).  I would guess the liqueur may be a bit sweeter which may make all the difference in this recipe.  If you like a stiff, dry drink you may like this.  I like dry but the bitterness.........
