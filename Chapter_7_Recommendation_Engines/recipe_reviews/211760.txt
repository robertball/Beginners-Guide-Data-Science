This is the best meatloaf ever!  I did substitute the thai sauce for Teriyaki (we don't like spicy).  I also added 3 cloves of garlic.  I made them in muffin tins, so much easier....this recipe is the new family favorite!

Super moist and tasty!  I used extra lean ground beef and lean ground turkey.  I omitted the onion as my family does not like them.  This was fantastic.

I am making this for the 2nd time tonight, and the last time I made it, my friend said it was the best meat loaf he's ever had in his life. :)  I didn't use any ground pork, just added a little more beef. Very very delicious!!!

i do not consider myself a great cook.  i rely heavily on recipes and this one was great.  i stopped making meatloaf years ago because i could not find a recipe that i liked.  the thai chile sauce was perfect - i never would have thought to use it.  i will def. use this recipe again!

This was a big hit with my husband (and I found it tasty as well).  Used all ground beef, rather than two different meats.  We always have sweet chili sauce on hand (unfortunately not VH, our grocery store doesn't carry it) and we think that you could put it on an old shoe and it would taste pretty good, ha ha, so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  I added four cloves of minced garlic (another food obsession we have) and a very generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.  I would also HIGHLY recommend putting foil down on your baking sheet beforehand or you will be scrubbing for an hour to get the grease/sticky sauce off the pan afterwards.  Let stand before slicing or it will fall apart on you.  Has a nice 'kick' and would be great with slices of avocado and tomoato...so that's what I'm doing with the leftovers tonight.  May add finely chopped red and green peppers next time for a bit of color and veggie nutrition in there.
