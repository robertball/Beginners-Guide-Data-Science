Our family has been making this recipe since 1980 when I graduated!  It's a family favorite... everyone that tries it always asks for the recipe.  Good stuff!!! If you enjoy stuffing you will like this. We like to saute the onions & carrots together until tender and then add stuffing.  We also steam or microwave the zucchini as it helps to retain it's flavor and this process doesn't have the watery affect boiling does.  We also drain the zucchini for a short period too.  Enjoy... This is a keeper!

I loved this recipe!  My grandmother used to make something similar to this and I have been searching for the recipe.  Even my hubby who claims to *hate* zucchini ate it up...

This is a great recipe, but I'd make a few changes.  First I use half yellow squash and half zucchini.  Next cook the onions with the squash, then the onion flavor won't be overpowering.  I also use cream of chicken soup (or cheese if you want it vegetarian).  Lastly, I think I use a little more stuffing, probably 8-12 oz.  Definetly try this one!

With our zuchinni crop increasing daily, I needed some recipes quickly.  This is a delicious dish.  I splurged with real butter, but cut back on fat using low fat sour cream & reduced fat cream of mushroom soup with excellent results.

This is a good recipe.  I reduced the fat content by using fat free sour cream, light margarine, and low fat cream of mushroom soup.  Also, I followed the suggestion of others and used only 1/2 C of onion.  Very good.

I made this recipe and took it to a Valentine's dinner at my daughter's in-laws.  It was a HUGE hit -- everyone kept telling me how wonderful it was...and her father-in-law went back for second & third helpings! I took some of the suggestions from the reviews I read. I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, and layered Ritz cracker crumbs (about 24 crackers) on the bottom of the baking dish. I also substituted the sour cream for a package of softened cream cheese.  This recipe is definitely one that I'll use especially when I have to bring a covered dish to a pot-luck dinner.

This was very good.  The only thing I might do next time, is to cook the onions a little before adding them to the casserole.  I liked the taste, but for those who aren't wild about onions, it was a little strong.  I also liked it a lot better the next day.  A great sidedish, and a nice way of using up zucchini that threatens to take over your entire backyard!

Great side dish recipe using vegetables. I reduced the amount of butter to 1/4 cup and combined all ingredients together.  After baking it for 10 minutes, I also added cheddar cheese. The dish turned out very moist and was a nice side with chicken with gravy.  Would make this again.

This was really yummy!  I made a few changes but I'm sure it would have been great as is.  First, I mixed in about 1/2 sleeve of Ritz crackers in the stuffing with the butter.  I used only 4 cups zucchini, which I pre-cooked in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I cut the sour cream in half since I had less zucchini and added some garlic POWDER (don't use garlic SALT, because it was pretty salty already with all the Ritz crackers) I wanted to make it a complete meal so I added a drained can of turkey meat to the zucchini/soup mixture.  I probably cooked it 30 minutes and it was nicely crisp-tender, but the crust was dark and yummy.  We ate 2 helpings each.  Yum!!

The onion is really overpowering in this recipe, since it doesn't really cook much in the time allotted.  I recommend chopping it very small or omitting it altogether.  

I also found the stuffing mix didn't puff up at all, I don't know if it was supposed to, or not, but mine didn't.  As a result, this didn't really satisfy as a main dish... it was just a whole lotta zucchini with some breadcrumbs on top, which seems more of a side dish.

This recipe went over very well at a dinner party I went to last night.  I had two non zucchini eaters gobble this side dish up and tell me that they want me to make it again!  I liked it too, but since I made it I was a little harder on myself and thought it could have been better.  Everyone else loved this dish. I will make it again.

I wanted a different and easy casserole for dinner on New Years' Day having all my family and in-laws over. This recipe sounded good and was delicious!!! Everyone loved it (the kids picked at it, they 'don't eat' zucchini). It was reheated twice and still as good as first time. Thanks for a great recipe, Bea!

Excellent! I'm not usually one to make vegetable casseroles, as I tend to like my veggies on their own, but this was soooo tasty. My husband absolutely FLIPPED for this; I think he had 3 helpings! I added some sliced mushrooms and just chopped up the carrots instead of grating them and cooked them with the zucchini. I'll make again. Thanks :)

This was really average. I put in a little extra zucchini in and some cheese which helped. I also drained the zucchini on paper towels (after draining the first time.) It wasn't too soggy, which was good, just a little bland.

Really wasn't all that great. Didn't seem to have any consistency beyond mush. Though the taste wasn't too bad, my husband voted it a do not make again.

Excellent recipe.  Made a few minor changes to make it more to our liking.  Used half of a medium onion, shredded one carrot, and used half of the butter.  I mixed it all together, baked for 10 minutes then topped with cheese for the last 10, per other suggestions.  It's a quick and easy recipe for leftover zucchini.

This is delicious and a great way to use up the zucchiini that seems to come in all at one time from the garden.  I used a 14-oz. pkg. of herb-seasoned stuffing mix, put a third on the bottom of the baking dish, a third mixed in with the zucchini mixture, and a third on top.  I also used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and a whole onion.  I have made 2 casseroles in the last week and my boyfriend wants more!  Great recipe!

Three adult men in our home raved and raved about this recipe begging me to keep it and make it again in the near future.  I've never seen them eat so many helpings of veggies.

I've had dishes like this before but they've tasted a lot better than mine did. The zucchini released a lot of water while cooking that formed a pond in the bottom of the dish. I also found the onion a bit overwhelming so I wish I didn't add as much.

Very yummy.  I also sauteed onions with the zucchini and carrots before tossing everything together.  This was very simple and quick.  I think I will play with other veggies and different kinds of stuffing mix.  Thanks!

I made this for a football party and everyone loved it. I read everyone's comments and here is how I tweaked it:

I used all the stuffing mix in the bottom of the dish to give it more of a base. Since everyone said that the onion was too strong, I used the recommended amount, but I sauteed them with the carrots in a skillet beforehand. This really worked out well. I prepared it the night before so the flavors could mix. overnight (but cooked it the next day). Lastly, five minutes before the dish was finished, I put shredded parmesan on top.

Great recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  Great way to use up a lot of zucchini.  Instead of steaming the zucchini I sauted the onions & some garlic for a few minutes then added carrots which sauted a few more minutes then added zucchini to saute also.  Stirred in the soup & sour cream mixture.  Followed the rest of the recipe as it was written.  Wonderful.  Will definitely make again.

After reading lots of reviews on several similar recipes for zucchini casserole, I modified it: I sauteed my onions and carrots until tender and seasoned them with Spice Islands 'Beau Monde' blend. I only cooked my zucchini (sliced and then halved, not chopped) for five minutes. I did not boil it for five minutes, I added it to boiling water and drained it after five minutes..the finished product was perfectly tender but NOT mushy (groty, as we say in CA). I used chicken flavored stuffing and cream of chicken soup, and added a bit (maybe 1/4 cup) of sharp cheddar cheese on the top. Finally, I used a covered casserole dish. That way the stuffing wasn't dried out as some have noted. Very good main dish with salad and white wine!

Anyone who does not like stuffing, will probably not like this recipe.  My boys do not like stuffing and will not eat this, but my husband and I love this recipe.  Most zucchini plants come in a pkg of 4, so we've got to use it up somehow!  I add shredded cheddar.

I would consider this more of a zucchini stuffing than a casserole.  That doesn't really matter, because my family was fighting over the leftovers.  I agree with many that this is better the second day.

DELICIOUS! We use cream of chicken soup vs. mushroom soup (sure either is great but at holiday time we always do the green bean casserole too with the cream of mushroom base).  This is a traditional dish on our Thanksgiving & Christmas tables - hub gave me this recipe 21 years ago when we were first married and asked if I'd make it at Thanksgiving and we've made it every year; I use 3-4 med. zucchini, 8 oz. sour cream, 1 box chicken flavored stove top, 1/2 c. butter. The soup base works great when it mixes with turkey on the plate.  Great!

Definitely a lot of crunchy texture & taste from the raw onions and stuffing. If you don't want dragon breath, you may want to saute the onions a little (I plan on doing this next time). I used dry stuffing mix and it was a little too salty (even salt-loving hubby agreed). So next time I'll use another stuffing mix or try to find a low sodium variety (if there is such thing). I also added chicken- sauted chicken cubes in garlic powder and it was a full meal. My picky 14 month old even had a few bites.

Our family just started eating zucchini's and I wanted to try this recipe. I used this recipe for the first time yesterday and our family fell in love with it. This will definitely be one of my favorites. I followed the instructions and everything turned out perfectly. I wasn't sure how much salt water to put into the pot for the zucchini's but I used only enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Then, I waited for the zucchini's to have an almost translucent appearance with some crunchiness. I also enjoyed the sour cream flavor (even though I don't like sour cream) :-)

I loved the idea, but it came out kind of bland. Adding chives and garlic over onions would have picked it up a bit. Next time I plan to grilling the zucchini first, to see if that helps with the water content and flavor.

I modified this a bit. I only had 2 zucchinis so I just used them diced and halved the rest of the ingredients, minus the bread stuffing mix. I'm not sure if the stuffing mix would have made a huge difference or not? I liked the way the sour cream/cream of mushrooms tasted. I didn't saute anything before hand, but it actually made the zucchini a little crisper which I liked. Next time I try it, i will saute the onions and carrots first, then add the zucchini last.

My husband called this "onion soup": a little too onion-y, a little too soupy. I thought it was pretty good, though very rich. If I make it again, I'd omit the onion for my husband and leave out the margarine, too.

This is so good! I sautéed the zucchini, finely chopped carrots, onions, & some garlic.
Then stirred in the soup & sour cream. I used Pepperidge Farm cubed country style stuffing
 (about half of a 14 oz. bag). And put all the stuffing on the bottom. 
I have been looking for this recipe. I lost my copy I got from a friend. I so glad I found it.
It’s great with a turkey dinner.

I tweaked quite a bit since I was using what I had on hand. Instead of Sour Cream, I tossed in what was left in a tub of sour cream based salsa grande dip. I also only used a handful of chopped onion that I had leftover. I had sauteed some zuchinni and carrots the night before and used those. It can out surprisingly tasty! The stuffing on top was a but crunchy though, maybe moisten it somehow next time.

I followed the recipe as written, and it was ok.  My husband and I couldn't taste the zucchini at all.  This was more like stuffing with some added veggies.  Our 10 and 7 year olds complained about it, but our 1 year old ate it right up.  I would probably make this again.

YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!  So good!  I served this for lunch guests and they all wanted 2nds!  I am so pleased with the recipe!  Total comfort food.  My 3 year old LOVED it as well!  Thank you so much for sharing this!  We will be making this a LOT this summer!!

~2nd time making it - I ommited the butter and just dampened the stuffing - I tasted no difference!  Also I put the onions on top that you put on green bean casserole instead of the stuffing and YUM!  This is absolutly my new favorite food!

This is one of the best veggie dishes ever.  I made only one small change because I was lazy and didn't want to measure the stuffing - I used an entire box of Stove Top (which is 6 oz.), and adjusted the amount butter to 1 stick to account for the increase.  I would definitely make this again - over the summer for sure and probably as a holiday side dish.

I modified a little.  After cooking zucchini quickly sauteed the onions in the pot then added the rest of the ingrediants to warm.  I also didn't have any stuffing so I just added a little butter to bread crumbs and topped off the casserole with cheddar cheese before adding the bread crumbs. Turned the oven to 400 for about 15 minutes and it was done.  Delicious.

This is an easy recipe that is different.  The only things I changed were per some other reviewers suggestions:  added salt/pepper and chili powder to taste for more flavor & spice. Also added a sprinkling of shredded parmesan cheese to the top before the final stuffing layer.  Topped the whole thing with some paprika for color.  As many people said, this tastes even better the next day.  I would easily make this again, likely the day before a party.

Love it!! Nice and creamy, the added crunch from the onion(uncooked)and the stuffing on top gave it wonderful texture...You can certainly make this recipe your own by adding to it,perhaps I will try chicken in it next time. Yummy! If a somewhat crunchy casserole isn't for you sautee all veggies before putting in mixture and make your stuffing as normal box recipe before putting on bottom ant top of recipe...Thanks for sharing!!

It was already, a little too much onion.  My stuffing was a little crunchy, but as a leftover it was even better.  I added some cheese ( I add cheese to everything)

My boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms so I used cream of broccoli soup, and he loved it!! I made this casserole three times now, and I put more than half of the dressing at the bottom, so it gets moist.

This was a huge hit!  My non-veggie eating family devoured almost the entire casserole.  Some suggestions... like previous reviewers I would cook onions first.  However, unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find it lacking in flavor at all.  I used the Stovetop savory herb stuffing. Also, I don't care for canned soups or mushrooms so I used a "cream of chicken" substitute (basically a thick white sauce flavored with chicken). Perhaps these 2 things made a difference in flavor.  This will continue to be a regular dish in our house... especially during zucchini season!

This is a good zucchini casserole (really good the next day).  Mine needed more cooking time, though.  Next time, I'll cook the zucchini in the microwave and saute the carrots and onions on the stovetop for a short time.  I eliminated the butter and used 97% FF soup to reduce the calories.

This was very good. I did add (2 Tsp) minced garlic to the zucchini and onion mixture. Also added (1/2 Tsp)black pepper to soup and sour cream mixture. I used the microwave to pre-cook the zucchini, onion , and minced garlic (8 minutes). I used unsalted butter as the stuffing has plenty of salt. It was still crisp tender and tasted great. A keeper for sure!

Awesome!!! This is the first time I'm trying something like that and me and my husband loved it! It felt so healthy. Of course I made some changes like steam the zucchini for 10 min, saute the onions and carrots, and add some salt, black and white pepper and some dill. Definitely will make again.

We absolutely loved this. I had to use gluten free stuffing but the rest of the ingredients were as listed. I did skip precookong the zucchini out of personal preference. I detest overcooked zucchini. By skipping the precooking step my zucchini came out nice and crisp/tender.  I will definitely make this one again and again.

It was just ok, I did run out of zucchini and only had 4 cups so I also used 2 cups of yellow squash.  I wish I had read the reviews before hand, it might have gotten a 4 for me.  I would have sauteed the onions and would have added some salt and pepper and maybe even some garlic.

An outstanding side dish. I was lazy, so, instead of layering, I added most of the stuffing to the zucchini mixture. I finished with a light layer of stuffing and a dusting of parmesan. My boys aren't fond of squash, so this was a good way to "hide" it.

Delicious! I had a large zucchini I didn't know what to do with. I peeled some of it and scooped the seeds out before dicing.I also wasn't sure what stuffing to use and tried Uncle Ben's Stuff'N Such,country style which worked well. I followed the suggestion of another member to sprinkle cheese on top before baking.This is defilitely a keeper!

To be honest I almost didn't make this recipe because it just didn't sound that appealing to me, but I really needed to use up some of my zucchini from the garden so figured I'd give it a try...I added corn to it, cooked the onion...and used stove top box stuffings (because thats what I had) ...to my surprise it turned out really good! My kids and husband all enjoyed and even asked for seconds...I thought it was a little bland but nothing adding a few more spices to it wouldn't fix. I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good, but I did make the following changes: (1) Add garlic. My rule is if it has onions, it has got to have garlic. (2) Decreased sour cream to about 1/2 cup. (3) Added about 1/2 cut of shredded cheese (mix of sharpe cheddar and fat free cheddar. (4) Decreased butter to 1/4 cup and added bit about 1/4 water. The family said this is definately a keeper.

This was ok.  It was just really bland.  I even added 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp garlic, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 cup colby jack cheese, and 1 cup chopped celery and it was still pretty tasteless.  I think there's too much sour cream.  I used the cubed bread crumbs and when they toasted, they had the consistency of croutons.  Too crunchy.  If I ever made this again, I'd cut down on the sour cream or mix in the stuffing and top it with cheddar cheese and french fried onions during the last 10 minutes of baking.

This turned out really good, and it will be even better tomorrow when the stuffing softens up a bit and the flavors meld together.

I used half the amount of onion as others have suggested and sauteed all the vegetables together instead of boiling the zucchini.

Definite keeper ,,, Delicious and colorful.  Used about 2 generous cups of Pepperidge Farm seasoned bread crumbs in place of boxed stuffing.  Tasted a LOT like dressing.  Will be adding to Thanksgiving menu this year.  Just Wonderful!

This was amazing! I would have never thought to use zucchini in this way.  Everyone loved it. I used shredded zucchini that I had frozen from last summer. I did drain/squeeze out all excess moisture!

This has been one of my family's favourites for years.  My mother taught me and I started cooking this for my husband and I.  The few things we do different: We use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, I use shredded carrot instead of chopped, I don't use as much butter with the stuffing (instead I use only a couple tablespoons and some zucchini cooking water).  The biggest thing I do different is I add some cooked hambuger to the bottom layer!

Very tasty.  I used Savory Herbs stove top which I like the best for these types of things.  The carrots/onions were still a little too crunchy for me after 20 minutes, so next time I will throw them in the pot with the zucchini before I drain them - just to soften them a bit.

I like zucchini, creamy sauces, and stuffing, but I was not impressed by this casserole. The sour cream taste was a little overpowering. Furthermore, I was expecting the stuffing to turn out moist, but it wasn't. Perhaps the reason why some previous reviewers have said that this dish is better the 2nd day is because the stuffing by then has had a chance to soak up some moisture. Maybe if the stuffing were mixed with a little water beforehand, it would turn out more moist. Or if the dish was covered during baking, it would keep in more moisture?

This recipe was delicious.  I substituted cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom soup because my husband is allergic to mushrooms.  It was quite tasty.  Will definitely be making again.  Super easy recipe.

Loved this. I used fried onions out of the box in the pantry instead of bread topping, because it’s what I had. Lovely side dish that the entire family enjoyed.

I added yellow squash, red pepper, green beans, cauliflower and leaks.  The total still equaled about six cups of vegetables.   I  used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  It was a great holiday casserole.

This was SSSOOOO GOOD!! I took some other advice and steamed the zucchini for 5 min. I also fried the carrots and onions in a little bit of butter along with 1/2 cup chopped celery. I didn't add that to the zucchini and soup. I added it to the stuffing mix.

I think there should be twice the amount of stuffing. The carrots were still hard when it came out of the oven.

Great recipe! I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. I cooked the zucchini with the onions and carrots to soften more...I also cooked them with chicken broth instead of water. I also mixed in mild and sharp cheddar cheese when mixing along with a handful of stuffing...I seasoned with kosher salt and pepper and lastly I cut up a tomato and mixed as well...I cooked 25 to 30 minutes... best ever!

I made a few adjustments after reading other reviews. I didn’t cook the zucchini. Just cut it up and put it in. Came out perfect. I used a red onion and cooked it until tender before adding. I used herb flavored bread crumbs mixed with half a packet of veggie soup mix (the dry kind you make dips out of). Also added some fresh mushrooms but that was to use up stuff in the fridge. Came out delicious! Lots of flavor. Not soggy at all! Will make this again!

It's a little bland and needs something to kick up the flavor.  I put parmesan cheese on top. If I make it again, I will add shredded chicken.

This was surprisingly good.  I baked it for 30 minutes and it was not hot enough,  I added 8 oz ground beef a few chopped mushrooms, put most of the stuffing on the bottom, baked for 15 then added grated cheddar (about 2 oz),  and French's fried onions ( about 2 c) and baked for 15 more minutes.  Wanted a main for an easy supper, put it together in the morning, rerigerated til supper time then baked it.  I did cook the zuchinni in the microwave  about 9 minutes. I sautéed the ground beef and mushrooms, but every thing else as written.  We will serve this again.

This was delicious. I added boiled chicken cubes and about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to the mixture. Forgot to buy the stuffing mixture so I used breadcrumbs instead. Came out wonderful. I think next time I will add some frozen corn and green beans to amp up the flavor.

Excellent!  Only changes I made were to saute' onion, carrots and 4-5 sliced mushrooms in a little butter before adding zucchini  and sauted until crisp tender.  I then mixed about half of the dry dressing , the sour cream and cream of mushroom soup  into the sauted veggies, and poured it into the prepared baking dish. Melted 3 tbsp. butter and added it to the remaining dressing  plus a little bit of sharp cheddar cheese and sprinkled that on top.  My husband and I really enjoyed this dish and look forward to finishing it over the next few days.

I love zucchini in pretty much any kind of dish, this is one of my favorites though! it's pretty easy, and, like most casseroles, super customizable! I took other reviewers advice and sauteed the onion, carrots and zucchini a little so they wouldn't end up crunchy, turned out great!  It is a very rich recipe though, so if you'd like to stretch it a bit to feed more people, it goes very well with egg noodles.

This recipe was awesome. I would use about half the butter next time to be a smidge healthier but the rest was perfect! I did add more carrots and some mushrooms since I needed to use them up plus I used cream of chicken soup since that's all had but same concept. It's very versatile and next time I'll add chicken to make it a heartier entree.

Absolutely delicious!!  My husband, a friend, and I ate the ENTIRE pan!  Made a couple additions/changes:  sautéed the shredded carrot and onion in some butter for a few minutes.  Did not boil the zuccini, sautéed it in a large pan with some minced garlic instead, then mixed in the mushroom soup, sour cream, carrot/onion, and some shredded extra sharp cheddar.  Put the stuffing on he bottom and mixed more shredded cheddar in with the rest and put on top.  Baked covered for 50 minutes until zucchini was crisp tender.   Also, husband and friend were both just "meh" about zucchini, but both had big second helpings of this!  Will absolutely be making this again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This casserole was tasty and quick.  I added a little shredded cheese with the remaining dressing for the topping.

Followed the recipe except added some shredded cheese. It was pretty creamy and tasty. Not at all soggy as some have noted.

I will make this again. Had it as a side with salmon. They went well together. Plenty of leftovers for tomorrow even though we each had two helpings. I used French's Onions instead of the diced onion as my husband doesn't like the texture of onions and they worked great. I also baked it earlier today at the called for temp and time, then reheated it at 400 deg. for 20 min. when I cooked the salmon. Didn't dry it out at all.

Wonderful way to use up the last of last years frozen vegs.
Used couple handfuls zucchini, carrots, some sliced tomatoes, handful of corn cut off cob, mushrooms, couple slices green pepper and 7 cut up link sausages that were cooked and frozen.  Made my own dressing as tho for turkey, but in appropriate amount. Think next time will use imitation sour cream with the soup. Tasty, but a little rich. Definitely make again

I loved this dish!! The only thing I did different was sauteed the vegetables in olive oil until completely tender then added the soup and sour cream to the pan and heated. Then layered in my casserole dish with the stuffing mixture, it was AMAZING! Thank you for a great recipe to use up all those garden zucchinis!

I added some cheddar cheese to the zucchini mixture. The stuffing I added a 1/2 cup of water to keep it from drying out. The top layer made a wonderful crunchy topping. I will definitely be making this again. Yum!

I made a few adaptions--made my own mushroom soup roux, doubled the onion and an extra bread crumb layer. It was a BIG hit with the 39 people at the dinner we went to. They actually announced at the table that Marjorie's casserole was a hit.

Hint: I made this a day ahead, so when it came time to reheat, it was from a COLD start. So it took 45 minutes to get it to 160F. Next time, I may prep veggies and assemble and bake closer to time to serve.

Just made this tonight because we had so much zucchini left from another recipe. You need to sautee ALL veggies! I added onions to the pan but not carrots and they are too crunchy and add a flavor I didn't want. I will make this again. I also added a layer of shredded parmesan cheese before baking...and it was wonderful!

It was OK, not what i expected. Tasted to me more like stuffing than zucchinis. Would be a good meal to make in a pinch.

Just ate this tonight.  My vegetarian daughter approved so it is a keeper.  I forgot to put in the onions, so on the off chance that someone doesn't like onions, it was good without.  The one thing I will do differently next time is that I will do two boxes of stuffing(we used Stove-Top Cornbread-because that's what we had and the vegetarian daughter thing).  I like stuffing and just wanted more in the bites.

Love this recipe!  Took the general outline of the dish, modified a few ways. Used less sour cream and butter. Had some fresh-grated sharp handy, threw that in. Used 2 cups breadcrumbs instead of stuffing mix. Very good result though: I will definitely do this one again!

After trying this out we decided this could join our rotation of regular week night meals. It's crunchy and has lots of vegetables! I've also tried it with different soup bases, though I think the cream of mushroom is the best.

I fried the veggies and added cooked, shredded chicken and yellow squash.  It turned out really delicious.  My kids have asked for it again.

I just tried this and it was delicious!! Made a few changes after I read all the reviews, just minor ones but it turned out great!!!
First, I took a pound of hamburger and tossed my onions in and browned and drained. I cut the Zucchini up into small pieces and put 2 Tablespoons of garlic in with the water and boiling until almost done, drained very well. Put hamburger in a 9X13 pan, mixed zucchini, soup, and sour cream together, I also added a 1-1/2 teaspoons of garlic (yes again) mixed well and layered on top of hamburger. I took a handful of cheddar cheese and spread in on top of the zucchini, and topped with the dressing mix and butter (mixed of course). Only thing I think I would do different is to peel the zucchini next time.

what makes this good is the stuffing mix...I cooked the zucc in chicken broth, added onions for the last min or two....if you use a large zucc...might want to peel..mine was large and pithy..so I seeded..should have peeled it too....added bout 1/2 c of mozz/parm cheese mixture under top bread crumbs...was very tasty....

I tried this recipe a couple of weeks ago and fell in love with it. I have made it a second time with just a few changes. First time I didn't have fres onion so used dried minced and added fresh mushrooms just to use them up. Second time I added fresh spinach. I love this recipe. I crave it. I made it Sunday and have had it everyday!

I followed the recipe as written, and I was grateful for something that wasn't complicated to make and something new with dinner. I paired it with egg noodles, which my toddler likes, for a simple vegetarian meal. Was a little disappointed that it didn't have more flavor. It was OK and definitely not a bad dish, but nothing special. I think I'll try some modifications as mentioned in these reviews and it other recipes, like using Ritz crackers and see where it leads me.

Made this tonight and everyone, even the guy who doesn't like zucchini or onions, LOVED it!  I made it in a 9x13 pan for 5 adults and didn't have any leftovers.  Very good.  I even forgot to put the butter in with the stuffing mix and thought it looked odd and dry, but it still came out amazing and it wasn't until after that I remembered the butter, lol.

Easy and uses up zucchini. I used a cornbread stuffing mix (stovetop). Great flavor. I'm sure it could be used as a base with veg on hand, however I made it just like written this time. Thanks!

This recipe is delish! Didn't have any stuffing mix so substituted homemade croutons (2 cups cubed bread, sprinkled with olive oil, dry chicken bouillon mix & a dash of onion powder, bake @350 til crispy), also no s.cream lol substituted top the tater (chive s.cream topping) Was really great!

This was just alright for me.  As much as I enjoy onions, it was too oniony as many others said in their reviews.  I would suggest to cook them before adding.  I might try this again at some point and add some more veggies like peppers and mushrooms (also cooked).

This recipe is a great side dish.  I have a similar recipe on hand. I did briefly saute onions and carrots. Also added some red bell pepper. The picture displayed by someone does not do  it justice. It is quite good.

This is one of the best zuchinni side dishes I have ever made A++++.  Very filling (this can be used as a main dish as well as a side dish). My family loved it and kept raving about it.  The only thing I had to do was substitute cream of onion soup for the cream of mushroom soup because I am allergic to mushrooms.  Will definetely make again

Wonderful.  My husband hates the slippery texture of squash and zucchini but the diced zucchini in this was fabulous.  I'll make again.

I can't believe i would ever find a zucchine recipe that would taste so good. The only thing i would suggest is the time. I would put it at 375 degrees for about 1/2 hour to 45 min. Thank you I will make this dish the rest of the summer and give it to my friends.

I can't believe i would ever find a zucchine recipe that would taste so good. The only thing i would suggest is the time. I would put it at 375 degrees for about 1/2 hour to 45 min. Thank you I will make this dish the rest of the summer and give it to my friends.

Really good recipe!  I will fine tune it more to our family's liking next time I make it.  Thank you, Bea, for a great starting point for zucchini casserole.

This recipe was just ok.  It was lacking flavor -it needed something to give it a kick.  My mom loved it though so that's why I'm giving it a 3.

Finally found a way to cook zucchini that my kids would eat.  I had a bumper crop of zucchini & yellow summer squash so I used a mixture of the two, worked great.  I sprinkled cheddar cheese over the zucchini before topping with stuffing mix.  I also used more stuffing mix (8 oz can).

This is a good summer casserole dish for your zuccini! My kids loved it.  In fact, one had a second helping! The recipe is quick to make. This is a keeper in my recipe box!
