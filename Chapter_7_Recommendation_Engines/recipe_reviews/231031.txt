Made this today and it was delicious!  I used our homemade fresh sauerkraut and some homemade thousand island dressing.  The whole family loved it, right down to the three year old.  I'm only wondering how soon I can make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

My guest loved this. I increased the recipe to an entire pound of penne pasta increasing all the other ingredients as well but I was unsure if I had added enough dressing and not wanting to drown the delicious salad I decided to leave it as I made it and just put the dressing on the side so people could adjust as they wanted. It was 1/2 and 1/2 some liked it as I made it and others used the dressing like ketchup. No matter there was very little left at the end of the game and it was first picked to be taken home by my friends. A perfect salad for a football party.

I thought this was ok but did not love it as a cold pasta salad. I used the amount of dressing and the pasta soaked it up, so it was  a little dry. I did heat it up a little and I ate it warm. I liked it much better

Extremely quick & easy to make!  I used swiss cheese.  I felt it was a little to dry & gradually increased the salad dressing & other ingredients until I liked the mixture.  i will make it again!
