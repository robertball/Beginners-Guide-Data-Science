This is so good, it's like dessert!!!  My kids even loved it so much we didn't have any leftovers!! The only changes I made were to add an extra apple (5 total) and leave out the onion.  Also, layer the squash (diced in small cubes) on the bottom with the apples (diced in large chunks) on top.  Don't stir until right before serving in order to keep the apples from getting too mushy.

I was skeptical about serving this dish for part of our Christmas dinner since I had never made it before, but I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, it turned out to be my favorite part of the meal. The only thing that I did differently was I only cooked it on high for about three hours, and then turned it down to low until we were ready to eat. I think if I had left it on high the whole time the squash would have been too mushy. Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe!

Yummy fall side dish! I did make a few small changes. I omitted the onion and added 2 tablespoons honey instead. I cooked everything without the apples for about 6 hours on low. I then added the apples for an additional 2 hours on low. It was delicious and the squash and apples were evenly consistent in texture.

Mine was done in 3 hours.  It smelled heavenly as it cooked.  I also added some maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, and a little melted butter.

Tried this one for Christmas.  It sounds delicious.  I thought the spices overpowered the squash too much.  Next time, I would decrease the amount of nutmeg and possibly add more aquash and less apple to the dish to make it more about the aquash.  A guest said it smelled and tasted like apple pie.

This was alright. The squash and the apple mixed together beautifully and really complimented Christmas dinner...Something wasn't quite right about it though. If I make it again, I will probably try it without the onion.

This was really good. I added about 1/3 can of whole berry cranberry sauce and a little salt. We had it with baked ham.  I used golden delicious apples. The apple got done a lot sooner than the squash. Next time I will try to choose an apple that holds it shape better.

it was good, but I think it would have been better if I had cooked it for less time--probably because I halved the recipe and cooked it in my small cooker.  It was great to have the squash and apples combined.  I think less cook time and sprinkle with candied pecans would be great.

After reading the other reviews, I was hesitant about making this for Thanksgiving, but it turned out very well.  It was well received by everyone, even my fussy eaters.  I used Honeycrisp apples and put the squash on the bottom layer as suggested by others, cutting the squash smaller than the apples.  I didn't stir until the end.  The texture was just fine, with everything holding its shape.  I left out the optional onions.  I'm glad I tried this.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Thanks to all the reviews that commented to make sure & cut the squash pieces smaller & the apple in large chunks. As a family that's only started eating squash in the last 6 months or so, we've been trying a variety of ways to eat squash & this is one of our favorites. Using different types of apples brings out different flavors & my kids love that it doesn't have a mushy/sticky consistency like some recipes using squash get if they are cooked too long. Another way to entice kiddos is to drizzle a little maple syrup over it when serving. Great recipe that made me more of a fan of squash than I had been before!

This was really good.  What a great hearty meal.  I made this along with a ground turkey meatloaf, and my one year old ate it right up!  I didn't have enough cinnamon on hand so I did add just a little ground cloves to the mix...I think it came out great.

I would give this 4 stars for ease and tastieness, and 2 for appearance. I think the recipe as stated is wrong. Mine was done in half the time... everything got mushy because of this. Next time I will keep it on low the entire time.

Easy, flavorful side dish.  Next time, I will add a full cup of dried cranberries. This dish was a great addition to our holiday meal.

Made this recipe with a few mods.  Dusted the squash, apple onion, mixture with 2T of flour.  Added half of that to the slow cooker.  Sprinkled cranberries on top along with some shredded cheddar cheese, and in hindsight, I think I will totally leave the cheese out next time, as I didn't taste it. Layered the rest of the squash mixture on top, and finally poured 1cup of veggie stock over entire mixture.  Let it cook for 4 hours, and when it was done, dug right in.  Served over a thick slice of sweet portuguese bread, my 8 year old was hopping in his seat, saying it was a dinner dessert explosion in his mouth.  My 1 year old got rid of her spoon, and opted to feed herself with her hands.  A winner, and a repeatable recipe, for sure!

I made the recipe as printed, and it got even better with each day.  I liked the chunks of squash & cranberries surrounded by apple sauce sweetness.  Very good.

This dish earns its stars for flavor.....  as long as you leave OUT the onion!  (The dish has a sweet and fruity flavor, so I'm not sure how onion helps that??)  The trick to success is to ONLY ADD THE APPLE DURING THE LAST HOUR of cooking!  Butternut squash takes much longer to cook than apples.....  thus by adding them in the last hour, they both have good consistency -- NO mushy apples!  .....Everyone has their own preference for spices.  My family likes this: 1/2 cup honey, 1 T. cinnamon, 1/8 t. nutmeg.  After this is loaded into the crock pot with the squash and craisins, pour in 1 cup apple cider to add liquid to the recipe.  The flavors work GREAT together!

Put it in a small crockpot, squash only first. the plan was high for one hour, low for two, put apples in for the last hour. Well, the squash was done before I put the apples in. Didn't use onions, used only two apples (braebean), put a little butter in...wish i put some kind of liquid in..kind of dry, overall turned out pretty good. My father in law really liked it and commented more than once about how flavorful it was.

This was AMAZING! The only thing I changed was I added golden, regular, and red raisins as well as sprinkled a little brown sugar on top:) Oh and I also used 1 small shallot chopped very fine instead of an onion because my boyfriend hates onions. I highly recomend this one! I will be making it for the holidays

I thought this would be a healthy side-dish for Thanksgiving, but this is very mushy and the flavor is not great. It was rather dry, so I added 1/2 c. vegetable stock like another reviewer mentioned. This did not save the recipe. I won't make this again.

Fearing the dryness other reviewers experienced, i splashed some apple cider in mine.  Also, i didn't have any dried cranberries on hand, so i used some fresh ones i had leftover from another recipe.  It was a brown, mushy mess, but it was really tasty!  It made my house smell absolutely divine.

I loved this! I did not use cranberries and I added 1-1/2 ts of fresh chopped ginger, 1/4 ts ground cloves, and I used granny smith apples. I'm not use to sweet things and I thought it great, but my family who eat a lot of sugar were not crazy about it.

I followed the recipe and don't know what I did wrong, but this dish turned out so bitter. Disappointing ...

Excellent recipe! I added a small piece of ginger and galangal (a ginger relative), walnuts and a bit of crushed cloves.  Cooked it for the full four hours on high.

We almost liked this recipe. With a few changes I think it would be good. Start by reducing the cinnamon A LOT! Maybe only 1/2 tsp and reduce the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. Then it would probably be good.

We thought this tasted pretty good. It was kind of a strange combination but ended up tasting great. A great way to use up some squash and apples that I needed to use up. Also pretty healthy. Which is a good thing! I did not add the onion. I did not have any.

3 hours was a little too long to cook.  Came out a bit mushy.  Tasted good and made my apartment smell amazing.

One squash and 4 apples is teetering on overflowing my smaller crock pot, but I sat on the lid :)    I love the smells. I am a bit concerned there is no liquid added... but I am following the recipe as written.  I can't wait to taste this.  The weather is rainy - this should be perfect!  so far I'm giving it 4 stars
The dish is very close to tasting like applesauce. That is not a bad thing, but I was looking forward to a more savory taste. My concern about liquid was not needed the dish created it's own. 
Hubby really likes the dish. 
Anyone think adding salt or sage or celery seed will enhance a savory touch?  I think I would cut back on the apple, I used fuji's - 4 big ones.  Very dominant flavor. Love the cranberry tartness. 
Thank you for the recipe

This wasn't bad, but had a slight bite to it, and seemed a little dry. I think it needs some type of sauce.

I agree that something was not quite right about this recipe.  It smelled wonderful while it was cooking but the apples were mushy and the squash was too firm.  After the 4 hour cook time I decided to add some apple juice to the crockpot to try to steam the squash a bit.  The flavor was not bad but the texture was off.  I think it's the first time I've made anything in the crockpot without liquid.  My family and friends said they liked it, but I think they were just being polite since it was the only menu item I made that I still have a tub of leftovers of.

It was a HUGE hit when I tried making it for the in-laws. What I changed: no onion, added 2 Tbsp Maple syrup, and when we got to their home, added about 1/2 cup of walnuts. It definitely needed the crunch after cooking everything. We cut the apple into larger chunks than the squash. We used honeycrisp apples. We only cooked it for 3 hrs (not 4) on high. Still, the apples were mush when we served it. It was so yummy, that next time, we may have it over ice cream...seriously.

This was very good.  I had to use fresh cranberries instead of dried.  Cooked it for 3 minutes in the pressure cooker.  I served it with cheese and crusty bread as a light dinner.  The sweet, tangy and savoury flavours proved to be a wonderful side dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Just okay.  Not the "wow" dish for Thanksgiving I was hoping for.  Very easy to prepare.  And I loved that it used the slow cooker.  That part was convenient.

I steamed the butternut squash for a bit first to try - and used the slow cooker for only 2.5 hours to avoid the mushy apple problem.  It was tasty but even this didn't solve the mushy apple problem.  I won't make this dish again.

3 start for as written,  however I made it a second time, left out crasin and onion. When finished cooking I mashed it all up so it looked like mashed potatoes, added a splash of cranberry juice, and garnished it with the crasin, the texture fit my family better than original recipe

I served this to company on Boxing Day and thought it was okay. I too cut down the cooking time or the squash would have been too mushy. It was too sweet for everyone's tastes and the onions didn't cook fully. Next time I will cut down the cranberries, nutmeg and cinnamon and cook the onions slightly first. It's definitely worth trying again with some modifications!

I was considering this as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner and decided to try it out first.  I'm glad I did.  It tasted decent, but after 4 hours on high, it turned into mush.  It was also over-seasoned.  I'm going to try it again, cooking it for less time and adding the apples in separate from the squash.  I think I'll cut the seasoning in half too.

I made this as a side dish for Christmas. It was easy to make and tasted great but...you really only need a little on a plate. It reminds me of a side of cranberry for thanksgiving. Taste is sweet. I followed the recipe and did not change a thing. I did let it set and only mixed it the last hour.

I made this for the first time tonight, with some adjustments and it was AMAZING!I will definitely be making this again and again! I omitted the onion, placed the squash in the bottom of the crockpot drizzled it with organic honey a tablespoon of cinnamon and a 1/2 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice. I used Fuji apples instead and left the skin on, after I put those in the crockpot I duplicated what I had done previously with the honey and spices, finally I topped it with chopped dates and let it cook on high for roughly 3 hours. After mixing it I let it cook on low for another hour. Like I said AMAZING! : )

As written, I'd give it 3 stars, but with a little tweaking, it's a 4 1/2. As written, it was WAY too much cinnamon and nutmeg. I use about half and it's perfect. I also like to make it a little heavier on the apples. My apples always get a little mushy, but I don't mind that - makes it applesauce-ish for the kiddos.

Fair. My crockpot cooks rather quickly, so on high it took only about 2.5-3 hrs. Mine is also old-school, so I couldn't fit the requisite amount of ingredients and had to guess at the proportions I was adding. I used yellow onion and thought it was overpowering. I recommend sauteeing the onions first for a more consistent texture, otherwise, it's crunchy onions with mushy squash and apples. Mine looks nothing like the picture and the sqaush ended up with a stringy texture. Not sure I'll make this one again.

The savory flavors did not come through all that well.  If I made it again, I would add some thyme and rosemary to bring them out.  Otherwise, I would add some brown sugar or currant jelly to sweeten it up.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was ok.  The spices were very over powering and it seemed like it was missing something.  Mine was ready in 3 hours and I added maple syrup after tasting it.  I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't make it again.  If I do, I'll add more cranberries and leave out the spices all together and put in a little maple syrup.

This recipe sounded good with this combo of ingredients, but it wasn't good at all. The only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 cup apple juice hoping that that would help steam the squash a bit more since other reviewers had noted that the squash was still not cooked after the 4 hour cook time listed in the recipe. And I had the same results - not done after 4 hours, or 5 or 6 or 7. I ended up cooking this 8 hours until the squash was done. And in the end, we didn't like it. The soft texture of the apple chunks (and I used Granny Smith) with the still somewhat firm texture of the squash chunks wasn't appealing. So for the leftovers, I tried mashing it with milk and butter. It was more appetizing, but still not good. The rest got thrown in the trash. Such a waste of time and money. I gave this a 3 only because it was easy to make and the apple part was good. It was the squash part that made this a unappetizing (and I love squash by the way).

Fixed for Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it! We paired it with Beef Wellington but I think it would be even better paired with duck, goose, turkey or pork. I love finding a stress-free tasty side dish for a holiday meal!!!
One piece of advice: this amount really needs a full-size crock pot (not the oval one but the larger round one).
I made the recipe exactly as directed but next time I will spray oil the crock pot before adding food and I will add just a little water, maybe 1/4 cup, just so the bottom food doesn't start to stick before you start stirring it.

It took longer then it said for it to cook, I would try it again with more time for it to cook.

This smelled and tasted delicious! I omitted the onion, and used braeburn apples. Cooked everything together, timing was perfect. Added a bit of butter after serving into bowls and could taste all the flavors, including the squash. The prep for this took me closer to 30 minutes to peel and chop everything. Next time I make it I might add some blue cheese crumbles or candied nuts. Yum!!

Loved this.  I omitted the onion--just didn't feel it was a fit.  It was delicious.

My family loved this so much that there were no leftovers on Thanksgiving. Very easy to make and a great vegan side.

I loved this and so did everyone else! Left out the onions, put squash in and apples and dried cranberries on top. Melted a stick of butter with pumpkin pie spice stirred in and poured over. Took 3 hours on high and it was awesome!

Excellent fall recipe.  I read some of the other reviews and made it my own.  I used butter in the bottom of the crockpot so it didn't stick, added, cinnamon, nutmeg and maple syrup.  Turned out so well, I made it twice this weekend and was asked for the recipe twice too!  :)

Made some of the suggested adjustments.  It was good, but not great.

Delicious! I could eat it as a dessert and not a side and not feel like I'm missing out. A clean alternative to apple pie! After just 2.5 hours, it did get mushy. I also omitted the onions. As if the dish wasn't yummy enough, I loved the way my apartment smelled while it cooked.

I made this today for Thxgiving Dinner. The apples were mushy by 3 hours on high. I plan to cook the squash/ cranberries for a good hour and a half prior to adding the apples next time I make it. I added 2 tbsp of honey and found the taste pleasantly sweet. And yes the onions were omitted.

mushy and shapeless side dish.  I gave up on serving it as a side dish, and pureed it into a good soup however!
