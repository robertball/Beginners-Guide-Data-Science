I found the recipe on-line about 7 or 8 years ago and it said it was a copy cat recipe from some restaurant. It looks very pretty in the glass when made and garnished as directed. I used to put it in wine glasses. It is very tropical tasting. I would make them when people visited from out of town when I lived in Virginia Beach.

Lower alcohol than other drinks but tastes good. Maybe a little too much OJ. Wife's favorite though.

This was just OK. Too much orange juice for me. The next one I used half the orange juice (or doube all the liquors) and added 2oz of pineapple juice which I did like.
