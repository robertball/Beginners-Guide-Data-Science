I picked up whole wheat Italian bread by mistake and I'm so glad I did.  It was perfect.  We loved this and I highly recommend it.

I made this in my SLOW COOKER, as I do not have a stove. I didn't soak overnight, just threw it all in there lol I adjusted the servings to 2, for just myself, and it took about 2 hours to cook.  It came out WONDERFUL! I used Texas Toast, and I don't have any flour so I used some Buttermilk Pancake Mix instead, which flour is it's mainly ingredient. Also didn't cube the bread, but instead made a " Sandwich" using sweetened. cream cheese. MMmm...this will be a weekend favorite for me from now on! :-)

Delicious.  I made a few small changes. I used about 2/3 of a loaf of my own homemade whole wheat bread, and nearly doubled the blueberries.  I only let it set to soak about 1 1/2 hours, and it was fine.  My family (me, husband, 4 yr and 2 yr old daughters) ate nearly the entire pan full!

Turned out well. I used frozen blue berries instead. Could have used more sugar or syrup. Good looking dish and easy!

I made this for a smaller crowd, so I halved the recipe and instead of curbing the cream cheese, I softened it in the microwave, added cinnamon and sugar to it, and mixed it in in the pan before baking! It was delicious!

It was okay. Would be better with sweeter bread than the homemade sourdough I used and definitely still needed syrup.
