This recipe was great. I had cooked salmon in the refrig from the night before so I made the sauce first and at the last added the salmon which I had flaked...Everyone loved it. Now I know what to do with leftover salmon. (It does need some salt added to the sauce.)

We all thought this was very good.  Even from my picky 11 yr old.  It came together very easily. I used tomato basil linguine instead of fettucine, as other reviewers stated it was bland.  I also added some salt to the sauce and a very small amount of sherry (after tasting per recipe).  With those changes we loved it.  Oh, I also used extra garlic (we love it) and less lemon zest.  A very nice meal, but a little rich.  I will make it again though.

Wow, this was great!  I followed the recipe mostly, except not as rich.  I used low fat on the sour cream and and 1/2 cup white wine instead of the cream.  I also added salt.  I was tempted to cut back on the black pepper, but the full 1/2 t. gave it some real zip.  We all loved this and I will definitely make it again -- and for company.  Served it with grilled zucchini and a spinach/mandarin orange salad.

This was just ok for us...second salmon recipe that I have tried in a row that disappointed us.  I followed this recipe exactly and didn't change a thing.  The sauce was too thick and it didn't have very much flavor.  Don't think we will make this one again.  Thanks anyway for the post.

The first time I made this it was surprisingly bland - considering the "heavenly" aroma from the ingredients while it's cooking. I also found it wasn't "saucy" enough but rather dry. However, something about it made me want to try it again, so this time I used 2 huge cloves of garlic, increased the cream and sour cream to 1 cup each and added a cup of fresh grated parmesan. It was better, yet still not as flavourful as I had hoped. But my 2 young kids ate it without complaint and I enjoyed it enough to finish my plate. I'll probably make it again sometime, maybe with smoked salmon instead of fresh and see if that adds to the flavour. Thanks for the recipe, Annas!

I has great potential, but as written it was not that great. The lemon gave it a weird taste! I would either cut it way down or omit it completely. The sauce was too thick with "stuff". I had to add more sour cream and cream (I used nonfat sour cream and non fat 1/2 & 1/2). I think I used 1 1/2 cups cream, and 1 cup sour cream. I also used 4 small cloves of garlic...should have used more. I topped it with smoked red peppers and tomatoes. I will definately try this again, but I'll have to tweak it quite a bit.

My husband has sworn off shrimp linguine, so this was a great substitute "fish with pasta" meal.  I added some chopped asparagus to the skillet in the first step, along with some mushrooms. I also grated some fresh parmesan cheese, and added fresh ground peppercorns. Definitely a dinner we'll enjoy time and time again.

I had some leftover grilled salmon, but I used all the rest of the ingredients and it was just awesome.  Now I can't wait to try it with fresh salmon.  I also added fresh parsley and it gave it a bit of color!

I loved this recipe, and my three year old liked it as well.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is because my husband didn't care for it.  I used lemon pepper instead of the lemon and pepper.  I might try it again without any lemon at all, as my husband complained it was too tangy.

Very easy to make, once you've chopped all the veggies and meat.

Delicious and fast! I used smoked salmon, subbed lemon juice for zest and white onion for red, didn't have a leek so added steamed broccoli.

I liked this dish, but I had no make some changes. I followed the recipe, but when I tasted the sauce, it was very bland. I added a few tablespoons of lemon juice and white wine, which helped a lot. It was still very rich. My boyfriend was so full he didn't want any dessert, which has NEVER happened before.

Fantastic! I made this recipe with smoked salmon that I had on hand and traded leeks for sweet white onion. Awesome flavor. Will definitely make again for my family!

It tasted good, but it looked thick and grainy instead of smooth. Anyone know why it looked grainy? (It didn't taste grainy, but it didn't look very appetizing.)

I think that the corn starch is unnecessary since  the sauce became quite thick. I liked the punch of the lemon zest. I will try the recipe again.

Yummy!! With the help of earlier comments, this turned out to be absolutely delicious! It seems to be a very forgiving recipe as I made a number of changes.  Used cooked salmon, adding it last; used regular onions and instead of red; 3 cloves of minced garlic instead of 1 crushed; added mushrooms and white wine; made the sauce with 1/2 c cream cheese and 1/2 c sour cream, threw in milk and cottage cheese and 1/4 c parmesan cheese. A lot less pepper and paprika.  The lemon zest really makes this sauce and helps to neutralize the fish smell.

Mediocre at best.  What little flavor there was, was overpowered by the lemon zest.  Will try again with more garlic, salt, and less lemon.

Not bad as written, but much better with a generous pinch of snipped fresh dill sprinkled on top. If I make this again, I will leave out the leek - just personal preference - and perhaps use asparagus instead. Thanks, Annas!

Eh, it was ok. It really needs salt to punch up the flavor. I will try it again, but this time I'll try adding some white wine to the sauce.

I made this tonight for dinner, but I cut the recipe in half.  Apart from that I followed the recipe exactly (the only change I made was to use farfalle instead of fettucine).  The end result was pretty good, it's a nice mild fish dish with a very distinct lemon flavour.  It's very easy to prepare, very economical and quick to put together for a weeknight meal.

Severely disappointed with this sauce. I followed this to the letter because of all the praises here, and what I got was a very tasteless sauce. Will never make again.

Very easy to make but there is something missing for flavor in this recipe. I did double the pepper thinking it would help with more bite when I tasted it but it was still bland. Would be a 5 star if it had more flavor.

As it stands we find this a bit bland but, as usual, there is always a way to change a recipe to ones own tastes.   Sauteed a 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes plus omitted paprika and added 1/4 tsp. dill.   These changes are just to suite us.   A good basic recipe.

I tweaked it some and accidentally added too much butter.  The taste is kinda strong, but it's still good.  I'd lessen some of the ingredients.  I'd make this again.

This was just OK.  I thought it was pretty bland, which was a surprise.  It was a little greasy and for me the salmon taste overwhelmed everything else.  I like salmon, but it just didn't work right in this dish for me.

I made this recipes having high expectations for the flavor.  I was disappointed.  For all the work and ingredients I should have just made a simple alfredo sauce.  I couldn't taste a difference.

This receipe was great, although, I did change it quite a bit.  Duirng the first step of cooking the salmon, garlic, and onions, I added mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes.  Then, I let it cook about 5 more minutes and added spinach.  I then added the sauce.  The taste was great, but because I cooked more noodles then sauce, I added some alfredo sauce (prepared in the jar).  It was great.  Received rave reviews.  Thanks for a great receipe!!!!

This recipe was very very delicious.  It was easy to prepare, quick to make and very satisfying.
You really couldn't tell it was salmon you were eating, it could have been tuna or pasta.  I substitued non-fat sour cream to save on calories, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly as written.

Thanks for a great fish recipe that we'll make again and again, especially during Lent.

This was awesome! Followed the recipe to a tea and it turned out great. Obviously, I experimented on the inlaws and they thought I just struck gold! This one is a keeper. The only thing I didn't follow was cutting the salmon into strips. I steamed it and flaked it. Bet you could go to the next step and use a quality canned salmon and really make this a fast, tasty meal.

Very tasty recipe, like others I added some salt.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke for a smoky flavor. I substituted 1/2 cup fat free milk for the cream and added more cornstarch to keep the sauce thick. I also used low fat sour cream which did harm the overall flavor.  Peas are also a good addition. My picky 15 year old loved it!!

Recipe seemed to be missing something, although not sure what. It was fairly bland. Not bad, but wouldn't make again. Sauce was also too think. Didn't need the cornstarch and I had to add milk to thin it out. Maybe would be better with a lighter pasta like angel hair.

This recipe needs salt.  There wasn't a lot of flavor to it.  We reheated it the next day and added salt and it was better.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

This is a fabulous dish.  My husband and I went to Italy last year and discovered this amazing, delicious, savory salmon sauce.  We had it a half dozen times in as many different towns.  I have been on a quest to replicate this dish since then.  This one is close.  Here's what I did:  I used canned, wild salmon and used the juice that it was packed in, I didn't have a leek so added lots of onions.  I used half and half and heavy cream.  Finally, I served it over cheese tortellini.  
Awesome!!!
thanks!

Not impressed at all.  Lots of work and still lacked flavor.  Sauce too heavy as well.

I made this for a get-together during lent.  It was a HUGE hit.  I had omitted the lemon zest and added a splash of white wine into the cream sauce.

This was a disappointing dish.  Both my husband and I thought it was surprisingly bland considering all the flavorful ingredients.  Maybe more garlic and onions would help?

This was very good.  To try to cut down on the fat I used milk instead of cream.  I also left out the leek only because I forgot to buy one.  I will definitely make this again and will try to remember the leek next time.

Served to my guests for lunch, they loved it, I made modifications, increased the garlic to 2 buds, 2 leeks and a 1 1/2 lbs of salmon, forgot the lemon zest.  Cooked in my wook, the vegetables were crisp and salmon pink.

Good recipe.  The only thing I changed is added some Italian cheese to the top to add flavor.
