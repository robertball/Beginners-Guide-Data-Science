After a few adjustments, this turned out great. I sub'd white sugar for the brown sugar, added 1 cup sour cream and 3.5 ounce package instant chocolate pudding. Baked it less time than called for in recipe.

This cake tasted good but it was so dry that it was hard to swallow without a gulp of milk!  I followed the recipe exactly and baked it only 55 minutes.  Also the next day the chocolate topping had turned white and looked like an old chocolate bar.  Sorry but I can't recommend this cake and I will not make it again.

We ate this cake in 4 days. It was starting to dry out by the 4th day, but it was so easy to make and the family loved it. I had a hard time getting the chocolate to melt so my 7 yr old spread it with a knife. It wasn't beautiful,but my son had a great time helping me and there was no stress involved. I am looking forward to making this cake again.

This cake was so dry, that even with a gulp of milk, you still could not swallow.  Followed the recipe to the letter.  Would not recommend and will not try again.
