This was a good and easy to make dish.  We loved it. Only comment is that you really do not need all the sauce that the recipe calls for - I QUARTERED the sauce measurements and it was MORE than enough for the 1/2 pound of salmon fillet.  I also used dry herbs and it was fine.  I would make again.

This was pretty good- I really loved the flavor of the sauce.  I hate horseradish, so I substituted dijon mustard with great results.  I used light mayo and light sour cream.  I did bake at 400 the whole time and skipped broiling.

This is by far the best salmon recipe I have ever had or made. I made it with the silverbrite salmon both times I made this dish. It is simple and quick. I often use recipes as a jumping off point but I followed this one almost to the letter. I only switched the onion salt for onion powder and the same for the garlic salt. The dill sauce is a must and sets this dish apart. This is going into my binder and will make often. My husband and daughters can't rave enough. I'm not even a huge fan of salmon. Thanks for such a great recipe.

The salmon and creamy dill sauce were both excellent. Easy recipe to follow and pleasing to the eye. Can't wait to serve this dish for a dinner party. :-)

We needed a change from the usual way we prepare salmon and this definitely did the trick.  I used a little extra sour cream and reduced the mayo a bit.  I doubled the lemon juice and dill for extra flavor, and added 2 tablespoons of white wine to the sauce.  This was delicious!

Didn't make the salmon as pre the recipe as my oven wasn't working, so had to pan fry. But I did make the sauce to serve with it and it was outstanding - definitely 5 stars exactly as written!  Mixed the remainder of the sauce with the leftover flaked salmon the next day for the best salmon sandwich I've ever tasted!

Was good, but the times on the baking I think were short and the times on the broiling too long. Dill sauce was nice and refreshing, didn't have horseradish, nor care for it, but replaced with some cayenne pepper. My husband liked it very much!

Very nice flavour, I substituted dijon mustard for the horseradish like another viewer and it turned out perfect. Thank you for the tip "Tasty Dish", and for this simply fab dish Susan!

Really easy and the sauce was delicious! Next time I would cook the salmon a little less but other than that the recipe itself was excellent.

We really liked this recipe - salmon was a little over cooked, but still was delicious.  We didn't cover with lemon and onion - just used lemon pepper and a little lemon juice.  We will make this again!!  The dill sauce was out of this world!!!

This was so tasty!  I used just a sprinkling of Tastefully Simple's Onion Onion instead of onion salt because I didn't have onion salt.  Even without the sauce, the fish was amazing.  If you like salmon, you can forgo the extra fat and calories in the sauce.

We went to the fishing boats and picked up a beautiful coho salmon. We choose to try this recipe for it. We didn't have and of the special salts so we improvised with lemon juice, onion and garlic powders. This is the best fish I've ever eaten. The dressining was really good with the fish. We did find that the time under the broiler was a little long for us, so just watch your fish closely to tell when its done.

I fixed this when an unexpected house guest turned up and boy, did it make me look good!  Fantastic.  I will do salmon this way as often as possible now.  (I actually do a whole salmon very similar to this, so I thought it would be good.)  I did tweak the sauce a bit to 'up' the flavor:  some capers with a bit of the brine and a little white wine

Everybody just loved this at a dinner party last night and it was pretty too with the lemons and onion. I garnished the plate with extra lemon and fresh dill. I seasoned the fish a little more than called for. But what made the dish even better was the great dill sauce. Will make again soon!!

This was really great!! I made this for dinner along with two other recipes from this site (Parmesan Asparagus and Honey Roasted Red Potatoes). It was a yummy and easy dinner to cook when you get home from work!!! I added a little bit of garlic powder with the onion powder and that was perfect! Next time, I might decrease the sour cream SLIGHTLY. It was just a little too strong in the sauce but not strong enough to keep my family from eating it all! Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was very good.  I hadn't ever cooked salmon before so this was a great recipe to start.  My roommate and my 7-year-old daughter both liked it also.  The sauce was more of a "dipping" or condiment sauce rather than the creamy topping sauce I imagined but it was still very good.  I thought the cooking time might have been a little long but I didn't mark off since it could be oven error.  Still, I would check it earlier next time.  I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand:  1) shallots in the sauce, rather than onions 2) wasabi rather than regular horseradish and 3) I didn't have lemon slices for the top of the salmon so I dipped all of the onion slices in lemon juice.

Salmon was good - dill sauce was a bit so so.  Not what I expected.  I used fresh dill and it just didnt have a very deep flavor profile - sort of one note.  But the salmon part was excellent!

Very good.  Will make as a change of pace from the salmon recipes with soy sauce.   I would have liked a stronger dill flavor in the fish and not just in the sauce.  Everyone cleaned their plates (even the kids).

The dill sauce is what made me go mmm for this dish. I didn't have lemon slices or lemon pepper seasoning so I used lemon juice and Old Bay seasoning.  It still turned out great.

Easy to do.  I served this for our Sunday "Family" Dinner.  Cousin, Aunt and Uncle came over... with a bunch of kids. 

I essentially doubled it.

I took someone else's advice and used garlic powder and onion powder instead of garlic salt and onion salt.

Came out PERFECT.  And the best part was it didn't take that much of my time so I could enjoy the family.

I used this as a recipe to venture into cooking salmon and I have continued using it and making it for my family.  It got a double thumbs up from the grandparents and had to give the recipe to my grandmother.  My grandfather never likes salmon, but he enjoyed this.  Just a few modifications, I use lemon pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to sprinkle on the salmon after I've put some lemon juice directly on the salmon (I never have lemons).  I also added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and onion powder to the sauce and more horseradish.  Amazing sauce and salmon!

This was really wonderful.  I served it at a dinner party and got many raves.  I only added an extra sprinkle of dill on the fish before cooking, just because we like it.  The sauce was yummy too and I made it with both fat free mayo and sour cream for my diet.  Didn't know the difference.  Thanks for sharing.

Very simple and quick to prepare. I used fillets and added sprigs of dill to the top along with the lemon and onion. The sauce is good too, but when I made it it was a bit thick (not sure if it's supposed to be) so I had a little more lemon juice. I put more dill in the sauce too. I've made a variation of this sauce by adding cucumber instead of onion and that's refreshing! Try it!

This review is just for the sauce--it's the BEST sauce I have found for salmon.  I use all sour cream instead of using the mayo, and use extra amounts of fresh chopped dill.  The lemon and horseradish really make this good.  YUM!

DELICIOUS! I didn't added horseradish to the sauce bc I didn't have any on hand, but the sauce is to die for! I even used fat free sour cream and light miracle whip and the sauce was still amazingly good! I did not broil the salmon, but baked it wrapped in foil for 20 mins at 400 degrees and it was PERFECT! I loved how the onions got tender. I served this with roasted asparagus topped with parmesan cheese. I will definitely be making this again soon! :)

Hubster liked it, but I think I could give him anything with sour cream in it, and he would like it!  I adapted this to smaller fillets, wrapping them individually in foil, and baking at 400 for 15 minutes.  I subbed dijon for horseradish in the lovely caper sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made individual filets. Used Dijon mustard rather than horseradish, and added 1/4 C. capers to sauce. Really good.

Lovely recipe--I've made it four times now.  I do not put the horseradish in the dill sauce (personal preference) fyi.  It does make a difference what type of salmon you use. The first time, I made it with ordinary farm-raised salmon, and it was quite moist and succulent.  The next two times,  I used wild salmon, and it came out a bit dry, since these fish tend to have a lower fat content (I think I used Keta salmon once, can't remember the other).  I have since learned that some farm-raised salmon has things added to its diet to increase the moistness of its flesh.  The fourth time I made this dish, I used the most expensive King salmon, on the recommendation of the person at my fish counter (said it has a higher fat content), and it was, once again, moist and succulent.  So do your homework as to which type of salmon you prefer, and adjust your cooking times/temps accordingly.

OMG! is all i can say about this recipe! I've never commented on this site but this was something i def had to comment on. This fish was so delicious my 3yr old asked for 2nds and she HATES ANY AND ALL SEAFOOD, so she thinks. And thought the sauce was ranch so she devoured that as well. I did make everything as the recipe follows except i did bake it in the oven the entire time on 400 like a prev comment said. I served with Asaparagus and Wild Rice. And it was amazing even brought it to work for lunch and my cowrkrs were asking for a bite and then the recipe..This is a def winner!! Thanks!

Good recipe. My husband is not a fan of sauces, however I am. He really enjoyed the salmon without the sauce. I ate it with and the sauce that everyone is raving about is so-so. I will cook the salmon this way in the future, but will look for an alternate dill sauce/sauce.

This is the absolute best recipe I've found for salmon and it's so easy to make.   The dill dip is to die for and would even make a good veggie dip.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Good, but make it early in the day! This is a very good way to prepare salmon with the classic flavors of lemon and dill, with the spicy surprise of horseradish. I substituted green onions in the sauce and it was lovely. I think It would have been even better if the sauce was made ahead of time so that the flavors have more time to blend, and the fish could also be prepped in advance and refrigerated to absorb the seasonings.

Absolutely amazing and so simple!  We eat salmon a lot and I couldn't believe what a difference this preparation made from our regular baking method.  I have to admit I did leave off the onions from the salmon.  The sauce was amazing.  We had some leftover and I don't think that's so terrible.  I think it would be used in several other wonderful ways (veggie dip, maybe thinned out for salad dressing).

I made this recipe as written, except left my salmon on the middle rack during broiling - I was afraid it would get killed. The sauce is fabulous, rich but mild. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

Very delicate and delicious flavor!  I just made the sauce, didn't do the first part to the salmon. I also made one change, instead of horseradish I used dijon mustard. And I used reduced fat mustard and mayo.  I spread a spoon or so of the sauce on the fish, then sprinkled a tsp or so of panko breadcrumbs and baked for 20 min at 400.  Served with whole wheat couscous with dill and extra dipping sauce. Really really yummy!

I baked the salmon for the entire time (no broiling).  The sauce was delicious; I used fresh dill and did not have horseradish.  Went a little heavier on the diced onion.  Delish!

Just made the dill sauce. Took other member's advice and substituted Dijon mustard for the horseradish since I didn't have any. Turned out great. I'll definitely make this again.

Just made for supper. Delicious! Used salmon steaks sprinkled with Italian seasoning and broiled for 7 minutes on each side until fish just flakes.
Sauce is wonderful!

Served with rice and asparagus, it was delish!!  I also just baked it with out foil.

Thanks for the recipe!

This was simple and delicious. I didn't have lemon on hand, but I did have some sour clementines that none of us want to eat.The dill sauce was really delicious. The recipe came together quickly and easily.I'm looking forward to making this with lemon next time- although I must say, the orange flavor was wonderful and a great substitution.

Wonderful recipe....it turned out beautiful! I customized the dill sauce just to our liking: I added more sr. cr. and less mayonnaise, about 1 tsp. of worcestershire. My husband loves salmon and he was shocked with the results of this recipe...so easy and quick!!!

Loved it. I omitted the onions from the salmon & the sauce (just seemed to be too much onion), but, for the most part, the sauce was a terrific companion to the salmon. I added a little extra horseradish to the sauce, and it was excellent.

AMAZING!! When it comes to cooking any meat that is to be considered, well, edible, I usually leave it to my husband. This recipe was so incredibly easy to follow, and tasted just delicious. I have to say I didn't have horseradish for the dill sauce, but we both thought it was a nice compliment to the salmon regardless. Just be careful when sprinkling the onion salt, making sure the evenly distribute! :) A must make again, in my recipe book.

Just made this and we loved it!  Melts in your mouth.  Didn't have the onion salt and lemon pepper but used a little plain pepper and didn't miss it.  Made the whole recipe of sauce, used about 1/3 for the portion we had, and now am using the rest for a delicious veggie dip.

GREAT Dill Sauce!!   Didn't make the salmon because I always put my salmon on the grill - I'm sure it's very good. The dill sauce is fantanstic!! I put olive oil, lemon and S&P on my salmon and grill it then pass the dill sauce at the table.  Delicious!!

The sauce is excellent.  I did double the lemon and the horseradish to give it some extra "tang" but that is more of a personal preference than anything.

Some advice, make a little extra... I kept dipping a spoon into the sauce while the salmon was cooking and "tasting" it, just to make sure it was as good as I remembered.

This recipe gets 5 starts b/c of the dill sauce.  That stuff is great!  I didn't have any horseradish on hand, so I went with someone else's suggestion and used dijon mustard, but added 2 cloves of freshly minced garlic to give it some of the kick it would have gotten from the horseradish.  I also double the amount of dill.  

I found the cooking time needed to be longer, esp the broiling time, but if you just keep a close eye on it, you can figure out how long it needs to be cooked.  The salmon was fine, nothing special, but paired with the sauce made it awesome.  Very easy recipe...I definitely plan on using this in the future...even with other types of fish.  Maybe a breaded white fish next time for some texture.  I think it would taste yummy with the dill sauce.  No more tartar sauce for me!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last Friday and followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the lemon slices (didn't have any) and just sprinkled a little lemon juice on the Salmon. We live in California and my husband fishes for Salmon when ever he can. He has tasted dozens of recipes for Salmon and just went CRAZY for this, saying "This is the best I've ever had!" I have already told my family members about this recipe. Thank You!!!!!

Very tasty fish with excellent dill sauce.  I may make the sauce in place of tartar sauce whenever I need it.  I put my foil packet on the grill at medium high heat and it was done in 15 minutes.

my sis-in- law made this for us and we loved it.  she skipped the butter.  used old bay seasoning in lieu of lemon pepper and onion salt.  melts in your mouth.
second time used some butter-yummy.  I like the onions so put a few extra.  used lemon pepper.  delicious once again.

I can't imagine the sauce without the horseradish. I doubled the dill and included chopped(seeded)cucumbers as suggested by another cook and they were a nice addition.  Sauce is more like a glorified tarter sauce.  If you put too much on, it will overpower the taste of the salmon.  We eat salmon at least once a week and was looking for something different.  This was very, very good, but not the best ever.

Very good recipe...I made this with garlic mashed red-skinned potatoes and crab stuffed mushrooms. What a terrific mesh of flavors! I spooned some of the sace over the salmon in the last few minutes of cooking and broiled. Yum!

I cannot believe I haven't rated this recipe yet - I've made it at least a half dozen times. No changes necessary to either the salmon or the sauce - they're both perfect and I am extremely picky about my salmon!! Thanks Susan for the recipe, it is wonderful!!

Excellent as is, no changes necessary.  I am not a fan of fish, but I find myself looking for opportunities to make this dish.  Easy enough for weeknights, delicious enough for guests.

I put lemon pepper on the fillets and seared them in a fry pan on high heat in a mix of olive oil and butter, about 4-5 minutes per side on high heat until crispy brown. I used chives instead of onion in the topping as well. It was outstanding. I even re-heated it for lunch the next day and it was great!

Made this dish like the recipe was wrote,but didn't have any horseradish.  Everyone loved it anyway and said it was the best Salmon anyone had experienced.  They are Salmon nuts, I can't eat it.

I just made this for a quick dinner and we LOVED it.  I followed the recipe exactly and I found it to be easy, quick, and delicious.  I have to say that I didn't care for the sauce because of the strong mayo taste--next time I will experiment with another dill sauce.

This recipe was fantastic!  I went salmon fishing for the first time  just brought home 22 lbs. of fresh salmon.  I had no clue how to cook it so I've been searching and trying new recipes.  This was wonderful!  I really liked the presentation with the lemon wedges/onion slices and the dill sauce was so much better than tartar.  I served it with baby red potatoes and cream corn.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was great! The dill sauce is fresh and light - a perfect compliment to the salmon.  I followed the cooking directions for the salmon but didn't use the onion or lemon slices.  I just drizzled some fresh lemon juice over it while broiling.  I also omitted the onion from the sauce.  I will use this recipe often.  Thanks!

Loved it!  The salmon and sauce were both wonderful, but maybe not together?  The salmon was great on it's own, and it was OK with the sauce, but we had a couple of crab cakes and fresh green beans with the sauce and that was delicious.  The lemon and onion on the fish kind of overpower the sauce.  Will absolutely make both again, just probably not together.

I've been trying to add more fish to our diet because it is healthy, but I've grown tired of the same old same old recipes.  This recipe rocked my socks off, and is easy, easy, easy.  Even hubby, who is kind of picky about his fish, kept saying it was good.  And, he had seconds!  I reworked the seasonings on the fish as neither of us are big fans of lemon pepper.  The creamy dill sauce is to die for!  I questioned whether or not to cook it as prescribed, but the salmon was neither overcooked or undercooked.  This is going on my rotation list.

The salmon and dill sauce were excellent. I made two minor changes to this recipe. I didn't have horseradish, but had horseradish sauce. So I used a teaspoon of that. Then the other one is since it is 100 degrees here today I did not want to turn on my oven. So we fired up the charcoal grill. I made a tray out of heavy duty foil & sprayed with a non stick oil, then placed the salmon fillet on that & grilled it for about 20 minutes. Delicious!

WOW!!! that Dill sauce is to die for! I used it to spread over the salmon, then baked it that way, I bought Atlantic which is nowhere nearly as tasty as our sockeye or steelhead (i'm from seattle lol) the sauce gave it GREAT flavor! thanks! I will be using this sauce often :)

I made this recipe tonight and followed close to the ingredients but used lemon concentrate cuz didn't have lemons (would buy lemons next time) and put fresh dill on the salmon.  Also used cayenne in the sauce instead of horseradish, more fresh dill weed than written, and more lemon juice.  So absolutely delicious!!!  The fillets cooked in the oven then the broiler was perfect.  I also couldn't get enough of that sauce.  I will pass this recipe on to friends and will make again.

About 3 years ago my family started a tradition called "Meatless Monday" .. A few months ago I decided to start another one  ... Fish Fridays. Some salmon was on sale at my local store, I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I had one problem, while preparing the dish for the oven, sparks flew from inside my oven and I realized the my heating coil burnt through. So out came my electric roaster and I gave it a try. Walla everything turned out great. I served it with a nice rice pilaf and tossed green salad. Even my picky eater enjoyed it, plan on making again.

Absolutely fabulous. What I like is there are no bread crumbs, so you get the pure fresh salmon taste. I cut the butter in half. I also doubled the amount of Dill Sauce, making one with sour cream and the other with yogurt. I'd double it if you think your guest will want to have ample sauce. Perfect for a birthday dinner. Thank you! 5 Stars

This is such a delicious recipe!!! I did not know what dill weed was so I made the sauce without it. Also I made a lemon butter sauce to go on the side and it was the perfect addition. It depends on what you like, I would say either of the sauces (the creamy dill sauce or a lemon butter) is the perfect way to accompany the salmon

This was delicious. I used higher quantities of spices than the recipe called for but I like things very flavorful. The creamy dill sauce was also very tasty. We had geusts and even a little boy who normally does not touch fish agreed that it was very good.

The sauce is amazing!!!  I didn't think I'd like a COLD dill sauce, but I sure was wrong.  I did as others have suggested & substituted dijon mustard for the horseradish sauce (not my favourite!) and this worked out well.  I was also really impressed with the cooking method - this was the best method I've ever used to have cooked, but not overdone, salmon.

This recipe is delicious, especially the dill sauce.  I don't care for salmon that much but my husband enjoys it and I know it's good for you.  This dill sauce though makes the recipe!  I didn't have onion salt but I still loved the sauce.  This is a keeper.  My mother made batter fried zucchini and I used the sauce as a dip.

This was an amazing recipe...we had fresh salmon that we caught in Idaho.  It is probably how I will prepare this fillet from now on.  I paired it some baby reds with butter on them and it was a delicous meal.

The creamy dill sauce is an excellent compliment to the seasonings on the fish.  Cooking the salmon wrapped up in foil kept the fish moist and the seasonings, butter, lemon, & onion create an amazing flavor combination.  It really does melt in your mouth!  My boyfriend and I loved this!

Great recipe.  The sauce makes the salmon taste wonderful.  For a slight change, I mixed butter and a little fresh lime and spread it over the salmon before broiling it about 10 or so minutes.

I always cook salmon, glazed with a sauce, on a cedar plank over the BBQ.   I enjoyed this sauce more standalone.  I didn't think it added much to the flavour of the salmon.  Perhaps it was the cedar plank that overpowered it - but the salmon kind of lost that smoky flavour as well.  I had to tweeked it with lemon juice after cooking to perk it up.

This was excellent! I got many complements from our guests. I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Also, I sauteed the onion rings in a small amount of butter before putting them on the fish and baking it - wow what a difference! I then drizzled the left over "onion butter" while cooking. Also, instead of mayo I used all sour cream in the sauce and extra dill and lemon. Definitely increase the baking time/decrease broiling time but this was great!

This was very good.  My salmon filet was still a little frozen when I through it in the oven so it had to cook a little bit longer than the recipe said.  Overall, the flavors were wonderful and the sauce was a nice match.

Superb!  We've been eating the Grilled Salmon I recipe from this site for a long time, and I decided to try something different.  This is a can't-miss for those who truly love salmon!  I followed the directions exactly except that I used some lemon juice instead of the lemon slices (didn't have any lemons).  I served the salmon on a bed of fresh greens and grape tomatoes, and used the chilled sauce as a dressing.  Fantastic!

LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!  It was fantastic!  My husband and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  We also used the sauce on red potatoes.  I think the sauce would have benefited from an overnight stay in the fridge.  But, we'll add this to our common salmon nights!

This recipe was great. We did not have a two pound salmon filet, so we made it with two pounds of smaller fillets. Used light mayo and fat free sour cream instead of regular, and it was still delicious. My brother and I do not like salmon, but when my mom made this recipe, we both ate all of it.  Will use again.

LOVED this.  I had a beautiful 2 1/2 lb. fresh steelhead trout (which is exactly like salmon, you wouldn't know the difference) - added some dill to the top of the fish in addition to the instructions, loved the presentation of the lemon/onion slices.  I also doubled the sauce and added a ton more dill and didn't have horseradish so I did a bit of spicy brown mustard to make up for the "bite", some garlic/parsley powder, dried chives and a ton of pepper.  The left over fish will make excellent fish patties and love that sauce to dip them in!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This salmon was a great dish.  We served it last night for 7 people.  We used 3 lbs of salmon...To be honest we could have used more.  It was a fabulous dish.  we followed the recipe to a T. Except substituted the horsrdish for horseradish paste instead.  The dill sauce was very good, however it made way too much for the amount of fish we had.  But we will probably use it for raw veggie and chip dip.
Thanks for the recipe!!

Good creamy sauce! I added a few dashes of chile powder and chipotle to the sauce. I also added another teaspoon of horseradish. I topped the salmon with a handful of chopped green onions before cooking. I really enjoyed it but my boyfriend thought it was boring, and needed more flavor. I served it with white sticky rice....the sauce was amazing with the rice too!

Let me start off by saying that I don't particularly care for Salmon.  That said, this meal has become a staple in my house and even I go back for seconds.  I only made one change and this was probably due to my oven than anything else.  I added 10 more minutes to the initial baking as the Salmon was too raw by the time I got to the broiling.  And when I am in a pinch for time, I forgo the lemon wedges and onion slices but it still comes out delicious.

I tend to like my salmon with a sweeter sauce but my husband loved this. i follwed the directions and it was super easy. It does make a lot of sauce, so I would halve it next time.

The dill sauce is delish!  My salmon was a bit dry but it could have been the quality...ya get what ya pay for.  Followed recipe to the tee and loved it.

This was a very clean tasting recipe.  I removed the lemon slices before broiling. Since we like a browned outer surface I increased the broiling time.  Don't skip the dill sauce--it compliments the fish perfectly.
