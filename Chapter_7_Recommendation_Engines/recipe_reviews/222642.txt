Very good - a lot like many wraps - be careful of the ranch mix - it can be salty - and you might not need the whole package.  I used red bell peppers, either way if is a very tasty snack.

I subbed green olives for the peppers. We all enjoyed these. I mixed ingredients and let sit overnight. A little salty for my taste but rest of family liked them.

I made these as appetizers at my grandson's recent one year birthday party.  They were a huge hit with both the grownups and the children.  I made them the night before, storing in fridge after rolling up.  Before the party guests arrived, I sliced and put out on a nice serving tray.  As I am not a huge fan of green peppers, I substituted a can of diced black olives, adding to the mixture of cream cheese.  Also, I used the entire package of dressing and found it to be very flavorful, not salty.  Will definitely make these again!

I used jalape√±o cream cheese instead of bell peppers and only half a package of ranch so it was not so salty. Perfect appetizers and taste great.
