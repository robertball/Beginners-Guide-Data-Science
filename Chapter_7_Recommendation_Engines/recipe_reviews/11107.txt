Had to make a big batch of cookies for a bake sale. I decided to try this recipe and use 3 boxes of cake mix - White, Chocolate and Strawberry. Neapolitan cookies! I made the 3 flavors of dough separately, chilled for 20 minutes, then took a little bit of each dough for each cookie, rolled into a ball, then rolled in sugar. They are delicious!

Very easy and yummy!  I didn't have a vanilla cake mix, so I used a chocolate cake mix. Also, I mixed the sugar in like an ingrediant (oops) but they still turned out wonderful! When they are still warm, they are almost brownie like, then when cooled, a nice cruchy cookie.
UPDATE:  I make these cookies for the kids for an afterschool snack, because its SOOO easy and quick.  Today I used strawberry cake mix.....very yummy!!

They were a bit sweet to me but -  my husband loved them and I also sent some home with athe little boy and his family devoured them!  Making Chocolate cake with peanut butter chips today!  Oh yeah and mine were soft a week later just sitting in a tuppeware.  Easy, Yummy and great for kids!!!

This was a nice basic cookie recipe.  We cut the fat a bit by replcing 1/2 cup of the butter with 1/2 cup applesauce and it still turned our great.  We also added a bit more flour since we were making the cookies into shapes.

I've made these several times now for church and they always disappear very fast.  

They may not be gourmet or exotic but their so easy, you're more likely to make them and be more loved by your friends! In my case, I don't have time Sunday morning for a complicated recipe, so this one is best. 

A couple of times I used chocolate cake mix for "chocolate chocolate cookies" and these were the most popular with my family. 

* I've make them with a big spoon when I didn't have access to a electric mixer and they were just fine. 

* I think they turn out better if you keep the dough chilled. 

* I think they're better if they're slightly under-baked so they stay soft.

They would not get stiff.  Stayed stick.  Even after refidgerating and freezing.  When cooked they were more like bread that wouldn't stay together.  I have never had a problem baking before.  This was a real big disappointment.

These were easy to make and very good.  Took them to a "pot luck" and received some good reviews.  I used Confetti cake mix which made them colorful.  My husband said I have to make them again, so they must be good!

I was totally surprised by this recipe....I was low on ingredients and needed an EASY recipe and this was it.  I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 1+ cup of oatmeal, and changed the # of eggs to 3 whole ones, a whole bag of chocolate chips, then separated the batter in two and added 1/2 cup of boiled raisins to one of the halfs.  They turned out very well.  
I had a bunch of hungry hunters and these were polished off quickly!!!

NOTE:  F.Y.I. They don't stay good for too long!!! We found that the next day they lost their kick....They got very hard (Even though I stored with a cut apple)
My husband joked that he was going to use them for skeet shooting!

Great tasting cookies!  only trouble I had was that they came out on the thin side for me, but people loved them anyway.  Great to do when you need to bake in a jiffy or when you forget that your kids need cookies for their class the next day...because they told you the night before!!!!!

The recipe is wonderfully quick and easy to prepare. However, there is one little instruction that made the process take far longer than I had expected. What I did was thoroughly roll the balls of dough in sugar, place them on the baking sheet, and bake as directed. The result was burnt-bottomed cookies. What I would do instead is dip only one side of the dough balls into sugar and then place them sugar-side up on the baking sheet prior to baking. I spent a good half an hour scraping the bottoms off my black bottom cookies. Otherwise a tasty recipe!

It was soooo easy and quick and they were a great snack, and the person who said they were hard the next day well it was probably just because of the ingredients that she/he mixed in.

Ok for cookies in a pinch. I agree with others that they are very sweet (and I love sweets).  They taste better than they look.  The ones in the picture look much thicker.  I found them to be very flat.  It is a recipe that I will work with to try to better them.  As for now,  I will stick with a basic sugar cookie recipe.

I tried these with Funfetti cake mix. They looked okay, and were soft, but the flavor just wasn't very good. They tasted somewhat like store bought cookie dough, which I never buy because the flavor is so lacking! Plus, these were not THAT much easier than authentic homemade cookies. Overall, I was disappointed, and I would have rather had cupcakes and saved the pound of butter for a better cookie. (And trust me, there are MANY on this site!)

I love this recipe - so easy and yummy!  I make a few minor changes.  I sub 1/2 cup shortening + 1/2 cup margarine for the 1 cup butter and 2 whole eggs rather than just yolks (helps keep them from flattening). I also do not roll in sugar since I add 1 cup of chocolate chips.  This recipe makes 2.5 dozen if you use a medium size icecream scoop.
try:
carrot cake with white chocolate chips
fudge cake with chocolate chips
party rainbow cake with mini choc chips
choc cake with pb chips

Have tried this with two different box mixes so far. First I used funfetti mix, it came out rather thin and were fussy to free from the pan but the survivors were delicious. Tried it later with devils food box mix and got a much thicker batter. I think it might be wise if this is your first time to set aside part of the butter/yolk mixture in case you choose a smaller cake mix box, then integrate it in if necessary. I do love how buttery the cookies are, and the additional vanilla make them all the more aromatic and lovely. I

For a cookie recipe using a boxed cake mix, this was good.  They do leave something to be desired- also they flatten out a lot.  The ease is what I was going for, and that they were!

This recipe calls for an 18.25 box of cake mix. Be careful as the all the cake mix companies are chiseling you now and making smaller boxes so the proportion of other ingredients may be off for those that are saying the recipe didn't work for them.

I was skeptical because of how basic this recipe is, but these cookies are AWESOME! One thing to make sure of is to not overcook them! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and kept a watchful eye on them. I cooked them for 9 minutes and went back to check: they didn't look done so I cooked them for another 1.5-2 minutes and they still didn't look done, but I took them out anyways. Turns out I cooked them just right; they just look different because of the cake batter part, I think. I will be making these again!!

These turned out fabulous!!! I read a review that someone had a problem with making these...they are simple and fool-proof and I cannot understand how they could mess 'em up!

I thought this recipe was great.I was a bit concerned when I read a Dec. 28, 2010 review. In any event, I had the ingredients and tried it anyway. It was so......easy. My son and I had Mother and Son time (as we call quality time) while we dipped the balls in sugar before baking. I even became a little daring by adding molasses to the last few cookies(next time I will make sure I add ginger but other than that it was um um good.) Thanks!

Really good. I didn't know how these would turn out but they were really fast and good. I used a devil's food cake, no extras...not even the sugar and they were soft and chewy.  I made one tray and then mixed in choco chips for the next tray. Yum!

My sister wanted to make cookies and i looked up easy cookies. I saw this recipe and wanted to try it. My mom got some cake mix from a friend (confetti) we put it together and they were perfect!The sugar did not burn the dough was stiff and they were delicious. i would reccomend this recipe!
