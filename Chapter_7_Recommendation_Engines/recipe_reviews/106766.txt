This recipe is delicious!  I added 1/2 box of sugar free vanilla pudding to it and was very pleased with the result!

I have been looking for this recipe for years. My mother use to make a "top of the stove" rice pudding. It was not like I remember and the rice was a little hard and there was something missing but I also know nothing tastes like mother use to make. Will try it again and doctor it up a little. Thank you.
