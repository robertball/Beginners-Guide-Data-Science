Chef John, Wow! I made this to your exact specifications, and I must say this was without a doubt one of the most delicious meals I have had the pleasure to enjoy in a while. I've actually made this twice now. Definitely one of my favorites and my family loves it too. Thank you! For yet another one of your fantastic recipes.

Outstanding! This is so delicious. I was a little concerned when I saw all the onions but they do cook down and provide the most amazing flavor. I didn't have fresh marjoram so added a little dry and left out cayenne (I just forgot it). Will totally make this again. Recommendation: don't serve the sauce over the pasta, it doesn't coat it well. Stir the pasta in as instructed.

Cooked the basic recipe the day before, then stored in our slow cooker overnight in the beer fridge.   The next AM, turned slow cooker on low before leaving for work.  Turned out great, thank you!

First of all, I really like slow cooking.  This is probably one of the best pasta recipes that I have ever made.  I'm also laughing, because my 13 year old grandson,  who says he hates onions, had no clue that onions were in the recipe.  He had 3 helpings.  (Oh, to be 13 again.  I  wish I could have 3 helpings; even 1/2 of a helping worries me.)    I did add chianti versus white wine , as I felt it makes it a tad hardier.  I also prefer the mini rigatonis, but that is just me.  Minis are the perfect bite.

Made this today and didn't get to eat dinner until after 8:00PM because I didn't get started as early as I wanted.  However that's my fault, since I knew what I was getting into before I started.  I'd say all the simmering is worth it though as it results in a very deep and unique flavor.  I'd liken it to kind of a sweet and savory stew over pasta.  Quite rich actually.  It's pretty easy to make, with 90% of the actual work being in the preparation. After browning the meat and adding the aromatics, you basically leave it alone, save for a few stirs here and there.  I wouldn't give it the rave reviews as some others have, but it's good.  I'll probably make it again, but more as a change-up than as a staple.

**EDIT**  Just wanted to come back and say that the leftovers are absolutely delicious and far better flavor than the the initial meal.  Really pleased with this sauce even a week after making.

**EDIT2**  It has been a few months since I made this, and now I am absolutely craving it!!  I don't think I realized how much I liked it.  Now bumping this from 4 to 5 stars.  I cook for one and I had so many leftovers.  It froze really well.  I put it in the freezer in single portion containers and then just made some fresh pasta whenever I wanted to have a meal.  Either the flavor just grew on me, or the longer it sits after preparation, the more the flavor improves.  Such a unique taste that I can't wait to have again.

Followed almost exactly (didn't use red onion, just 3lbs white and 3 lbs yellow). Turned out really well. Quite a bit of work that 1st hour, but then transferred it to slow cooker for the 8-10 hour slow cook. House smelled great! Maybe because I finished it in the slow cooker, I never had to add any liquid. Will definitely make this again. Might bump up the pancetta to more like 10oz because my family loves it.

Tremendous!!!  Made it exactly the way Chef John said and it was terrific!  I did have to add water/broth a few times to make the sauce to my liking, but it was awesome!  Waiting for a special occasion to make it again to "impress the guests"!  Thanks Chef John!

Kind a lot of work but definitely worth it. Also makes for a lot of portions so the time spent pays off itself. I wasn't really sure what to expect in the beginning but the result is really good. Very savory meat sauce with a nice onion flavor which is not at all overwhelming.

The flavor of the dish was really great in the end. I did run in to time issues so I transferred to my slow cooker using the pressure option to break down the meat chunks a little faster.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe but I would recommend adding a good amount of broth/water (maybe a cup or two) after cooking down the onions as there really isn't that much liquid in the recipe.  The meat stuck to the pan a few times because there wasn't enough liquid. I don't know exact quantity but added broth/water every 15-20 minutes in the cooking process.  There is no direction how to cut the meat but best to cut in to small cubes so it will break down more easily.

Very rich and delicious.  Froze some and sent home with my daughter when she came to visit.  She said it was magnificent reheated.  Next time I will cook at a lower heat than medium during the 30 minute part of step three.  It seemed to stick to my cast iron dutch oven, but the quality did not suffer.

Superbly succulent and startlingly simple!  Chef John nailed it!  I've made it twice in two weeks and am "feeding the freezer" so that we can have this wonderful ragu for later on.  Thanks, Chef John!!

I was blown away with the result.   I thought with that many onions it would be too strong., but the when they blend together, it's such a sweet non oniony type taste.   I am a freak for anything Italian.    I was really concerned that there was no garlic in this.   To the point of adding.  I thought well I'll make it by the book and then decide if I should spruce it up.    I am so glad I did not.   It is amazing.   On recommendation though.   When it's time to do the long long long simmer, use an induction plate to get that low simmer.   I had it set set just barely  above  off, and it worked perfect.    I plan on makiing a huge batch to can as a sauce that I can just  take it off the shelf and have.

I made this as per the directions up to a point, after about 1hr on the stovetop I transferred the mixture to my pressure cooker and cooked for about 4 hrs. I did it on the stovetop to give the onions a chance to release some liquid, figured this would keep my pressure cooker happy since the only liquid in the recipe was 2/3 of a cup of white wine. Was delicious when done.

This was so full of flavor!  I was really skeptical of this recipe from the start because of the amount of onions but after simmering for 8-10 hours my daughter did not even know there were onions in the sauce!  The only problem I faced was having to add about 4 cups of broth during the cook time to keep the sauce moist. Other than having to watch it carefully, it was an easy recipe!

I was concerned about the taste given the quantity of onions, but was pleasantly surprised. It does not have a strong oniony taste and was even sweet. The recipe doesn't say how the beef should be prepped, so I diced it.  The only substitutions I made were 1/4 tbsp. dried marjoram, and I used bacon instead of pancetta to keep the overall cost down. I added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper at the start of the slow cook. The recipe yields 9 cups of sauce, and I'd make it again.

This is my first review on All Recipes, and I have made this recipe 2 times so far, followed the recipe exactly. I just love how the onions infuse into the beef. The beef comes out so tender, I could eat this every week. It is a long process, but  it makes enough to freeze half.

Please don’t be turned off by the massive quantity of onions and lengthy cook time.  This sauce is luscious, rich, and absolutely sensational.  I recommend the following:  go with at least 2.8 lbs. of beef.  I used 2.8 and it was just right.  If you don’t have a huge pot to accommodate the mountain of onions and meat, just cook half of the onions down in a separate pot and repeat with the rest.  This process takes about 35 minutes.  I also threw in some chopped garlic and used two cups of wine.  My husband is not a fan of onions but he loved it. This is a lot of work but it’s worth it.

The sauce was delicious. I followed the recipe faithfully but after mixing the onions with the meat after the 2nd 30 minutes I noticed that food was starting to burn on the bottom. Considering it had another 7-9 hours to go I decided to dump everything into my slow cooker, on low, and cooked it for 8 more hours. It came out great, my 13 year old son gave it a 5 out of 5.

Made it up to letting it cook with the onions for 1 hour in the evening.  The next morning I put it in the slow cooker for 10 hours.  Absolutely delicious!

This is spectacularly delicious. Chef John, you're a genius! Served for a small dinner party with salad, and pears with ginger cookies and ice cream for dessert. So good, and has the advantage of being all ready to go when guests walk in the door.

About half way through the long cook, I had a taste and found that it was missing a bit of punch. Threw in 3 finely chopped anchovies, and it made all the difference. Next time I will also add maybe another quarter to half pound of meat for the same amount of onion.

It turned out good! I would only add that ladies may want to do the first steps prior to putting their makeup on. That’s a lot of onions!!!

What an amazing recipe! The whole house smelled amazing and the food tasted fantastic. Exactly as is! The recipe needs no adjustments. It made enough for me to use half and freeze the other half for another night. Definitely worth the time and effort. I plan to make this whenever chuck roast is on sale.

Awesomeness!  Did a trial run before a dinner party I will be hosting with friends.  Only deviation I did was when the onions started to wilt, I stopped and packed it in a container and put in the fridge.  Next day, before heading out to work, I slow cooked it a Crock-Pot for 12 hrs.  

I sauteed some spinach and added it to the dish when served.  

The flavors absolutely sparked! Thank you!

oh my holy God. So much fun to nurse this for the hours it will make your home smell like heaven. I must have taken a hundred, "tasting" bites along the way too. lots of fun and taste great. start it early enough so you do not eat dinner at 10 pm.

I have to say Chef John has failed me on this recipe, but I am still a huge fan. I know the problem was me, it also goes to more work is needed on the instructions. If you are not good a cooking technique (like me), do not attempt this recipe without following suggestions below. You won’t get the same Chef John Masterpiece, but it at least won’t be ruined and still taste good without burnt ingredients. I cut the recipe in half & still ended up with 8 servings. I stood by & constantly had to add broth and it still dried out. Until I can figure out how to properly cook this, I’ll either use a slow cooker for the entire thing after browning the meat or cook down the onions separately and add them to the absolute beautiful texture and smell of the recipe right up until the section of the recipe where you add the onions. The instructions from after that just did not pan out at all. And I have to say I followed the recipe exactly. It must have something to do with cutting the recipe in half. However every other Chef John recipe I’ve made is incredible. I just overstepped my skill set on this recipe.

This is a perfect dish.  I let it cook for 8 hrs but could have left it for an additional 2.  Some of the meat had not fallen completely apart.  But my family loved it just like it was.  They are requesting me to make it again soon.  Love this dish.

This was one of the best things I've ever eaten in my entire life. I made exactly to the recipe, but set it in the fridge for 24 hours before eating. I was feeling a bit of a budget pinch so made it with the less expensive salt pork, a sale chuck roast, and onions from the cheap grocery store. It didn't matter a bit.

This is the first Chef John recipe that wasn't excellent.  I tasted it about 6 hours in and noted that it lacked flavor, so I added oregano, basil, and Italian seasoning.  It was an ok dish that took about 9 hours to prepare.

Did anyone else find this to be very sweet? I always cook with sweet yellow onion but stuck to the recipe using red and regular yellow onion. While the flavor was good, I had to cut the sweetness by adding some Worcestershire. All in all I did enjoy it. P.S. I actually served over mashed potatoes...yum!

Chef John is awesome and so was this recipe!  Made it exactly as described.   It takes a long time and it was torture smelling it all day, but very worth the effort.

Short addendum, my wife took some into work and I have people begging me to make it again.

I had to add quite a bit of fluid, but I live in a very dry climate and this is common. Other than that, exactly as advertised. Delicious, very rich.

Very interesting dish - something very unique.  I couldn't believe the onions needed or the time required to cook.  The dish kept betting better and better as the minutes went by & the house was left with an amazing odor.  I was surprised the lack of onion flavor/smell as the dish cooked. 
 We used homemade noodles and will go with the store bought rigatoni to allow the sauce to better adhere to the pasta.  Very good recipe, worth checking out if you're in the mood for something different & unique.

I had serious reservations about this. I’m not going to lie. It seemed like a lot of work for something that didn’t sound very flavorful. Yet I found myself intrigued. My oldest absolutely abhors the texture of onions, and I’ve made it a game to see what I could cook over the years with onions that I could skip by him without him noticing. I’ve been doing this for 20 years and it never gets old. So, I just couldn’t pass up the challenge of hiding 6 pounds of onion in a sauce! I doubled it because it’s a long process so I figured I could freeze unused sauce. I started at 2 am, figuring I could toss it in the crock pot for the final longest cooking time, as others have suggested. During assembly, I realized that there was absolutely no way I was going to fit this in the crock pot, so I’ve been up ever since babysitting. The smell of this has been torturing me for hours! Everything is finally breaking up and melding. I’ve taken a few tastes during the stirring process. This sauce is so rich it almost makes my mouth hurt. It is divine. I am so glad I didn’t play with the original recipe. Not adding garlic to a pasta sauce seemed wrong. I wanted to. I’m glad I didn’t.

I loved this recipe with one exception:  you need to keep an eye on it and continue to add broth or water during the cooking process especially after adding the pasta as it sucks up the moisture in the sauce.  Other than that it was awesome!

This sauce is very different than I expected but keep in mind I am a big fan of Bolognese .  A part from the long cooking time and the cost of ingredients listed, I felt that this sauce needed "something" so I tinkered with spices and tomatoes to supplement.  Will I make it again?  No but everyone did enjoy when they were served.

The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it was really a pain to chop so many onions and I had to check and stir the pot every 20-30 minutes all day long. The only pancetta I could find at the thre grocery store was the thinly sliced, pre-packaged, deli type. I purchased 9 oz since another reviewer recommended more is better (& I agree). My dish looked exactly like Chef John’s video every step of the way. I did end up adding 2 cans of chicken broth throughout the day as it simmered over low heat. It was very rich and delicious! This made more than 8 servings, so we had leftovers for lunch & dinner 2 days in a row, then I froze the other half. I might try it in the crockpot next time since other reviewers seemed to have success with that.

Made this recipe twice and each time it has gotten a little better. First time I unknowingly de-glazed burnt chuck and onion in the first part of the recipe. Still tasted pretty good but couldn't get rid of the burnt after taste. Second time around I decided not to ladle the fat off the top.  The taste was on point but my stomach didn't agree.  Some of the family members also said the meat and onions were too infused with one another.  In other words, overcooked. 
Overall I found the concept of the recipe to be great, but personal preferences will dictate whether this is a 5 star or lower.
