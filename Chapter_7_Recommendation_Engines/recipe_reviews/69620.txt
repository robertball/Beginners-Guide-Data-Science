This is really good and easy.  I bought some of the ingredients at an Asian food store and received some great tips from a Thai employee.  So be careful and inquisitive relative to the fish sauce that you use.  Some are salty and some are not so salty. I used a not-so-salty version but still had too much salt for our family's taste.  Next time I'll cut down on the soy sauce.  All in all, a keeper.

Good, except Waaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy too salty.  I used low-sodium soy sauce, and the only fish sauce at the store.
Followed directions exactly, except marinated it longer.
Tasted like potential, if only it were less salty.
All the same--- probably won't make it again, but it was eaten.

Decent recipe, but I would increase the hot chili sauce (or specify brand/type) and make sure you buy the good fish sauce.  Frying the cashews might also help a bit.  Also, make sure you don't reduce the temperature of the oil & brown sugar mix, have the onions ready before mixing them.  Otherwise you'll end up with caramel when it cools.

This recipe is a stand-by dinner when I don't know what to make. It always comes out great.  I don't like my food too salty, but did NOT find this recipe to be salty as others have said, could be the fish sauce used, which is important. Don't be afraid of the sound of it, you can't skip the fish sauce! I also like to use the amino soy substitute for the shoyu.  My husband and I like spicy food, so we use at least the recommended amount of chili - preferably the garlic chili paste that comes in a jar with green lid. This is soooo good I'm making it again tonight (over some sticky Japanese rice!).

Yes, it is to salty, I would tell you to only use fish stalk with a TB or 2 of Rice Vinegar. Drop the soy. One TB of Sesame Oil and Brown Sugar is enough to create a glaze. You don't need the peanut butter. The trick to this is your green veggies, I would tell you to add nice green celery and green and red pepper to counter the other. Also, pound your chicken thin before marinating.

After living in rural Thailand for a 2 years I've never seen a dish like this, but it was still delicious. The thais I shared it with loved it too. I made it in a wok which gets really hot so I had to reduce the time on everything, but the chicken came out so soft.

I always try to stick as close to the recipe as possible the first time i make it...the first time i made this it indeed was waaaaaaaaaaay too salty.  However, it enjoyed the flavor, so i gave it another try and the next time i made it i used only 1 tbsp fish sauce and 1 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp rice vinegar.  This resulted in a much more palatable marinade.  I also changed the oil i cooked the chicken in to peanut oil and added a fresh hot pepper (serrano) and a red bell pepper to the mix.  I served all of this over rice and some fresh bean sprouts and topped with fresh cilantro.  I also toasted the cashews (just to deepen the taste and increase the aroma) and added some sesame seeds.  I also squeezed a wedge of lime over the finished dish.   Lots of additions that i felt kind of freshened/coloured it up, while still respecting the original recipe.  This has become a regular dish in our home.  Thank-you for the recipe!

This dish turned out great. I used a little less than half the marinade ingredients and used low sodium soy sauce, otherwise I am sure it would have been too salty (you can always add salt at the end, but you can never take it out). Also, the recipe calls for cooking the chicken for 10 minutes to brown it, but this really only takes 3-4 minutes. I cooked about 2 minutes added broccoli and red pepper and cooked 2 more minutes then followed the rest of the recipe as written. In my opinion, the fish sauce, peanut butter and sesame oil are very important flavours to the dish and I wouldn't suggest leaving them out and or replacing with other ingredients.

Great recipe. I love Thai food, so I am always on the lookout for dishes I can make at home. This recipe would work well with pork, beef and turkey too.

This is a really good recipe. I didn't have a problem with the salt. I did add broccoli to it, and I am not sure I would have loved it without the broccoli. That is why I gave it 4 stars. Having just meat and rice would have been lacking.

This was delicious, and not too salty at all.  I made a bunch of changes, however.  First, I didn't marinate the chicken for 2 hours because I forgot. :)  It only ended up marinating for about 10 minutes.  Second, I omitted the peanut butter entirely to cut back on the sugar/fat content.  Third, I used double the amount of cashews (UNSALTED) and toasted them under the broiler first.  Then I threw them in with the chicken mixture and let them cook in the sauce for a few minutes.  Fourth, I mixed a little cornstarch with water and added that to the mixture to thicken it.  Fifth, I used about a tsp. of chili oil instead of hot pepper sauce.  Finally, I served it over basmati rice instead of jasmine.  I used regular soy sauce (not the low sodium kind) and had no problem with the salt content.  Hubby loved it!

My son accidentally doubled the brown sugar and I was using a new hot sauce (Paw-paws Snake Bite), so I only put in half and this was a HUGE hit! We'll be eating this A LOT!

This is excellent and worth the work.  I didn't change anything, but I did add more vegetables.  More cause I was craving green than anything else.  Snow peas, bok choy and celery are nice additions.  I did do the peanut butter sauce, but next time, if I add it, I'll only do 2 tbsp.  I could really taste the pb.  Tasting during cooking made me wish I'd skipped it altogether, the brown sugar/sesame oil made a fantastic glaze on its own.  When you do the oil/sugar mix, make SURE you're only on med heat.  Trust me, it makes quite the mess of your pan if you don't pay attention.  Also, toast the cashews for a couple minutes first.  But I will make this again.  And it got rave reviews.

This was soooo good - my whole family loved it! I used a dash of crushed red pepper instead of the hot sauce since I worried that it might be too spicy for my kids otherwise, and that seemed to give it the right amount of bearable kick. I went heavy on the brown sugar to counter the saltiness of the soy and fish sauces and it seemed to be just the right mix of flavors. I did not add the water since it seemed that I already had enough sauce from the marinade and the chicken, and that worked out great. I thought it needed more veggies so I added some shredded carrots to the stir fry, which turned out to be the perfect addition. Also, I cooked udon noodles separately and then tossed everything together at the end. One more thing - I highly recommend that you flash-fry your cashews in a frying pan with a little oil until they brown - it only takes a couple of minutes and it makes such a huge difference in the flavor! This was a very tasty dinner that I will be happy to make again!

OUTSTANDING!   The only thing we changed was, we substituted green onion/scallions in place of the regular small onion.  Not losing this one.  Thanks Caroline C.

I was disappointed with this recipe because it sounded so good, but it was way too salty and very heavy. Perhaps it would be better with less soy and fish sauce, and a few vegetables added to it.  However, I don't think I will try it again.

Sounds like some others didn't enjoy this recipe too much, but my boyfriend and I loved it.  I made it at his place though and he doesn't have measuring spoons, so I just guessed on the amounts--I went light on the fish sauce (which smells funny but everything tasted good) and heavy on the red pepper sauce, and everything turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

The flavor was very good...in spite of the *awful* smell of fish sauce :-(  Wonder who ever came up with the idea of ingesting something that smells like that! Anyway, if you like Thai food, this recipe is good. I will not use so much chicken next time.

I used half the amount of reduced sodium soy sauce and it was still wayyyyyyyyyyyy too salty.  I got the impression it could have been quite good without all the salt so I will probably try it again using very little soy sauce.

Great meal. I have made this meal countless times and it's a common request when we are planning to entertain guests. Although I don't use the pepper sauce or fish sauce, this dish still comes out great. The best way to serve is over jasmine rice with a side of salad.

I liked it, as well as my husband, but I felt it was a bit too salty. I'll have to put less soy sauce. Other than that, I would make it again!

Good except my fish sauce made the dish too salty, so next time I'll use low sodium fish sauce.

I tried the sesame oil:brown sugar ratio suggested by the recipe and burned everything.  I tried again with 1 tablespoon sesame oil and one-half tablespoon of brown sugar, and it was fine.  You should definitely add some vegetables to this:  I threw in a bag of frozen broccoli after the chicken had been browned, but before the marinade reserves and water were added.  I also added more peanut butter (about 1 tablespoon extra).  With these changes, the recipe became something my boyfriend and I really enjoyed eating.  I'll make my modified version regularly.

This was really yummy, but really pretty salty. Granted, if I had low sodium soy sauce, it would've helped a lot probably, in which case I might have put five stars. Really good.

This recipe was excellent, with some minor changes.  I did omit the fish sauce and added 1/4 cup low sodium chicken broth instead. It was not too salty at all this way. Used 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper instead of hot pepper sauce.  Also added bamboo shoots (undrained) and baby corns (drained) and cooked until the bamboo shoots were tender. I did not add the water to the sauce because it was already thin enough. I will definitely make this again!

My first attempt at cooking Thai food at home. It turned out amazing. I found that 1 tablespoon of oil was not nearly enough to dissolve 3 tablespoons of brown sugar so I added more. I also upped the peanut butter to make the sauce a little thicker. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

This recipe is good, just requires a lot of tweaking. When marinating the chicken, I replaced the fish sauce with low-sodium chicken stock, the fresh ginger with powdered and the hot pepper sauce with black pepper. Use low-sodium soy sauce, too (you can't tell the difference). Make sure you let the chicken marinate for 2 hours...makes all the difference. I replaced the jasmine rice with basmati (you need to let basmati soak in water for 20 mins.). I minced the onion and added one of those frozen veggie packs with carrots, mushrooms and sugar snap peas. I only had salted cashews, so I just rinsed them a few times in a bowl of water and mixed them in with the dish. I had no problems with the consistency of the sauce or the overall saltiness of the dish. Great recipe with the changes. I will definitely make this again!

I made this just how the recipe was written.  It was very tasty.  It is a bit salty but not so salty that I thought it was distracting or anything.  My husband said it is "a keeper" and my three year old even liked it.  I'll be making it again.

This was okay. The flavor was almost overpowering and I had to eat it with huge spoonfuls of rice to compensate for it. Also, I had expected the marinade to cook up saucy because it didn't contain any sort of thickening agent (and I followed this recipe exactly) but it actually turned out to be very heavy and pasty. I will say it was interesting, but not at all what I was expecting.

Not bad but not what I was looking for.  I'm searching for a Thai cashew chicken recipe like the ones I get from Thai restaurants - which have more of a clear sauce.  I read the reviews saying it was too salty, so I substituted some of the marinade for chicken stock - and I think that helped.  Not bad, but not great.

I made this recipe last night.  We all loved it, including my 2 young daughters (8+5), and my 2 teenage boys from Hong Kong.  I will be including this with my regular recipe rotations!  We did not find it too salty or too spicy...just right.

I tried to stay fairly true to the recipe but following the suggestions made by others some of the suggestions I did the following.To make the marinade double the pepper sauce (I used sweet Thai pepper sauce) add couple of tablespoons brown sugar, lime juice and grated lime peel to taste, and a pinch of hot pepper flakes. I added red pepper with the sweet onion, and added more brown sugar per the recipe. Once chicken was done I added vegetables (mushrooms, Bok Choi, snow peas, but anything would work) and reserved marinade. While chicken was cooking I added vegetable broth (instead of water) and peanut butter to marinade. Added toasted cashews at the end. Marinade was salty but the sugar vegetable broth, and peanut butter combine with it in the end mix with it to create a delicious sauce. Allow sauce to thicken slightly before serving.

I would rate this three stars because it was way too salty.  However, made it again reducing the fish sauce and soy sauce to 1 T each and reduced the other marinate ingredients  accordingly and the result was 5 stars. Considering the fault might be with my brand of fish sauce, I rated it 4 stars.

i really liked this.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Word of advice...go to an Asian market.  They are all over, just look.  it's worth it, and you will find many spices there are quite cheap.  Ask for advice.  I got some very good tips.  I was buying rice flour, for Irish Shortbread, but the woman steered me away from the one I was going to buy, and told me it would be too sticky.  I followed her suggestion, and my shortbread was delicious. :)

This was delicious and easy to make. I've only given it 4 instead of 5 as it was quite salty even after reducing the fish sauce. I suppose this would depend on the sodium content of he fish sauce you have.

the end result came out pretty good.. always using what i have on hand i made the following modifications: cut the soy (low sodium) and fish sauce in half, fearing it would be salty as others had complained about.. reduced the hot pepper sauce (Sriracha) to 1 T.. subbed dried ginger (1/2 t) for the fresh.. only had powdered sugar in the house so used 1 t (we don't care for sweet anyway).. added red and green bell pepper to the onion mixture.. reduced the water to 1/2 cup, added only 1 T of pb, but it still tasted overpowering to me.. and cut the cashew amount in half.. we enjoyed the end result but don't know if we would have liked the original recipe more.. ty for posting

Love it, with some MAJOR adjustments. 

Olive oil instead of sesame.

1/4 Tbsp hot red pepper instead of hot sauce.

Doubled the chicken and peanut butter. Will double onion and garlic too next time.

Only 1 Tbsp soy sauce. 2 Tbsp fish sauce. 5 extra Tbsp water.

And there you go! LOL

For those who mentioned that it was too salty, I agree but simply added a bit more brown sugar and more peanut butter. I also added green onions and cilantro, which was a great complement to the dish. As another reviewer suggested, I cooked the cashews a bit. Lovely dish, will definitely make it again.

Made this today.   Icy weather in Tennessee so I had to make something that I had all the ingredients for.  
Glad I did.   This is delicious.    The only things I did different:     Marinated chicken for only an hour because of time.  
Didn't have sesame oil so I used peanut oil.   Added a red pepper cut up in large pcs and one carrot cut up small.  Thought it needed some color.  
I think cilantro would kick it up a notch.   I didn't have any unfortunately.   
This is a keeper and one to share.

Great Recipe!  I have made it several times and never had a problem with the salt (I've used both regular and reduced sodium soy sauce).  The biggest problem is remembering to marinade the chicken in advance, it's so good - I don't want to wait!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I ventured to the local Asian grocery and found all needed ingredients. This recipe was very tasty, although I added some sliced peppers and mushrooms. My wife has this at our local Thai resturant and said it was just as good. What a compliment coming from her. We will definitely be cooking this again

The original is a little too peanut buttery so I cut it down to just a spoonful, about 1Tbsp. In addition to a little toasted sesame oil and the cashews it had a nice nutty flavor. I didn't have fish sauce but I did have cod liver oil, so in went about a teaspoon of that, at the end of course (CLO is very sensitive to heat). It tasted great. All the flavors blended together nicely and made one nice big umami flavor. Thanks for sharing your tasty recipe.

Really good!  I would reduce the soy a touch because it can be a bit salty.  I also made some sugar snap peas with this.  The whole family loved it; I have made it quite a few times now.

I multipied this recipe by 3 for my cooking club and it turned out great (just cut back on the water added). Glad I used low sodium soy sauce and A Taste of Thai Garlic Chili Pepper Sauce worked great for flavor. Yum. We'll do this one again.

This recipe is real good and my husband and I really enjoyed it, will be making this again.  I made a few changes instead of hot pepper sauce I added one small soranno pepper with seed in the marinade.  I also added half a sweet red pepper and a green pepper cut in cubes to the onions.   Delicious!!!!!!!!!

this recipe is good. people who claim it is too salty.. try using THAI or CHINESE soy sauce rather than japanese soy sauce. it makes a difference because they are completely different types. also, try adding seasonings like soy or fish sauce to taste, using the recipe as a rough suggestion.. this recipe is good (but i admit it is definitely not something my Thai mother would have made..)

Good, but really heavy. Used low-sodium soy, so salt wasn't much of an issue, though I might cut down the fish sauce a tiny bit. I added 1 c. fresh broccoli and think I will add 1.5 cups next time and well as at least .5 cup snow peas.

yum, Yum, YUM!!!! This recipe was a total hit. I followed it exactly except for I was a little concerned about all the reviews about it being too salty (and I HATE salty food), so I used low-sodium soy sauce, and added the 3/4 cup of water to the marinade instead of waiting until the cooking part. It turned out great! I will definately be making this one again and again. The only thing I plan on doing differently the next time I make it is probably to double the marinade and add veggies.

Has Potential!! This was fun to cook and I liked the flavors BUT I have to agree with previous opinions.....very salty (and I like salty) and a little flat. Have not tried it yet but I suspect this will bring it to life(previous reviews and experience)....low sodium Soy sauce,fresh lime juice and a sprinkling of Cilantro about the same time as the cashews. Jasmine rice rocks

This was great!  The only changes I made were to use low sodium soy sauce, use hot chili paste instead of hot pepper sauce, reduce to 3 chicken breasts and added the cashews along with some broccoli and baby corn in the last few minutes.  I could only find lightly salted cashews and had only one choice of fish sauce, so I was worried it would be way too salty.  However, my boyfriend (who totally avoids salt) didn’t think so.  I'll be making this again.

I cook mostly Asian food, but I never tried Cashew Chicken. This was so good I was surprised. I added more sauce, and I thickened it with cornstarch. I've been to Thailand and Japan, and this was excellent and I will definitely make it again. I didn't add pb or lime, but I'll try it that way later.

This was good and easy but, next time I will add cilantro (my own preference) at the end and double marinade.  Family cleaned their plates and went back for 2nds.  Thanks for a great recipe.

WE LOVED IT! Changes I made: used Oyster sauce instead of fish sauce, brown rice instead of jasmine, put chicken broth instead of water in the sauce,  diced the cashews and roasted them w/ cooking spray (1st time i made this i did it w/ whole cashews & i did not like them but they taste great diced). I also added  broccoli with sauce.   Also, I put some chicken broth in the marinade because I loved the sauce last time and wanted more the 2nd time I made it. Thank you so much for this!!

I loved this one!! I didn't think that it was too salty and neither did my husband (usually I like salty food and he doesn't). I added a little extra ginger because I love it so much. Next time I think that I'll add fresh sprouts, grated carrot and broccolli since this recipe was lacking in the vegetable department.

There must be a typo in the ingredient list, as this is SO SALTY it is impossibe to eat.  I followed the recipe exactly, but wish I would have listened to a previous reviewer that stated HOW SALTLY this recipe is.  I had to actually rinse the chicken of all the sauce just to salvage dinner.  What a waste.  I would give NO STARS to this, but it won't let me post my comments with out giving it at least one.  Oh well....

This was very easy to make and quite tasty...  very filling and the sauce was perfect.  Not too thick or too runny.  I marinated the poulet for about 4 hours and doubled the garlic...  did not have gingeroot nor did my grocery store so I used the pureed stuff..  I will make this again for sure.

Even though the marinade was a bit too salty, I still enjoyed this recipe.  It's very similar in taste to the Cashew Nut Chicken entree at my favorite Thai restaurant.  I did add red and green bell pepper to the recipe.

I have to agree that the flavor of the sauce was way too salty (I used low-sodium soy sauce), and had an almost overpowering flavor. I too ate each bite with a lot rice to compensate and was only about half full when I got tired of it. It had a good flavor my husband and I both really loved if only there was a way to thin it out a bit.

Husband and I really enjoyed this. I looked in two stores for fish sauce - never found any - had read someone used oyster sauce, so I did the same. It was smooth, creamy, & flavorful, will make this again for sure. Maybe next time with baby corn. Thanks for a great recipe.

This dish was delicious. I only used half the fish sauce after reading all the complaints, and it was perfect. A tip on fish sauce: Don't buy the cheapest one, and it won't be too fishy. Also, I used raw cashews and toasted them before serving for an even richer flavor.

I cut fish sauce in half, added sliced mushrooms and strips of red & green bell peppers.  Then I skipped the peanut butter and added cornstarch to the marinade.  This made the recipe very close to the Thai restaurant version.  I will make this one again.

Sorry, didn't really like this one. It was not quite a chicken satay dish and not quite a chicken and cashew nut dish. Also, the marinade made the chicken too salty. Only just edible so won't be making again.
