Nice texture, good flavor, but the recipe needs seasoning.  I added about 1/2 tsp of ground sea salt and a few dashes of curry powder.  I used ghee (clarified butter) instead of butter.  The amount of coconut flavor is determined by the brand of coconut milk and by the type of coconut flakes.  I used dried, unsweetened, and I believe grated fresh would have been much better.  I will probably make this again.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

This was an excellent recipe and a hit with my family!  I cooked it in coconut oil and had a hard time keeping it from cooking too fast and burning on the outside.  This was not a flaw in the recipe just in my inexperience with cooking with coconut oil.  I didn't use coconut milk for dipping, I used egg instead cause I didn't have any on hand.  I also added panko bread crumbs to the coconut coating.  It came out delicious.  I added shredded coconut to my rice for a perfect addition to this meal!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Mmmmm!  This was so good.  I had some fresh coconut and shredded it finely.  I successfully used coconut oil in place of butter.  My tip to those who have problems with it burning - it's critical to cook over medium heat.

I went with the reviews and added salt as well as some curry powder and ginger. I used sweetened coconut as well since it was what I had. I soaked the chicken in 2% milk because it was also what i had on hand. A lot of reviews said the coconut didnt stick so I dipped it in flour before the egg wash (i added a tbs of spicey brown mustard to the egg and mixed it well). Its important to let anything 'breaded' to set.  I baked the chicken on a wire rack for 30 mins at 375. Served with shredded brussel sprouts. Yum!!

I know that adding the flour isnt paleo but we dont eat that way so it was no bother to us, i assume you could use almond or coconut flour for the same effect.

Very easy and delicious. I used sweet coconut, added curry , ginger and seasoned salt and mixed it up before coating the chicken breasts. A great change from the norm.

Good, simple coconut chicken recipe.  I handled the chicken carefully to keep as much coconut on them as possible, and it worked great.  Serving this over some lettuce and it is a healthy meal!

Substituted the coconut for coconut flour and pan fried in coconut oil.  Nice!  I will try the unsweetened coconut sometime for comparison.

I've tried this recipe twice and the second time added salt to the coconut. I loved it both times.  So did my husband.  The butter just makes this delicious.

It was bland but the texture of the coconut was great. I used dried unsweetened coconut. I would make it again but next time I will add some sea salt.

I love this recipe! It’s easy and flavorful. Instead of coconut flakes, I used a mixture of coconut flour with almond flakes. I also used avocado oil for the frying, instead of butter. This will definitely be added to my dinner menu rotation.

The coating did not stick. I think if I made this again I would add some flour to the coating mixture. I would cut the chicken into fingers. Coat the chicken then put it in the freezer the night before and then fry they next day.

I have made this twice and really like it, but found it a bit bland the first time. So, I added a little pink salt and some curry powder to the coating the second time and it was very good. It’s definitely a keeper recipe with the addition of seasonings.

Not only was this quick and easy, but it was absolutely delicious!  I did add a touch of sea salt after reading some of the other reviews and it was perfect!   I will most definitely be making this again.

I would definitely fry with olive oil next time. The flavor was good (i added salt, garlic and onion powder, problem was it fell apart and burnt because of the butter.

Was really really good! I found that maybe the coconut should be sweetened instead of unsweetened to give it some more flavour. And possibly baked just because the coconut cake off in the skillet. But overall really good!

Purchased coconut flour... added a little salt, pepper and cumin to it in a shallow bowl.  Dipped the thin chicken cutlets in the flour mixture then in the coconut milk (unsweetened) and egg combo, then in the sweetened coconut flakes.  Heated skillet with coconut oil and let each cutlet cook for 7 minutes on each side.  At the same time, we sliced into cubes fresh pineapples and grilled in a pan on stovetop with its own natural juices.  Kept them moving in the pan until they were just golden brown.  So delicious and healthy!!!! Love it.

The whole family loved this crunch healthy chicken. I did sprinkle large sea salt,pepper and paprika on both sides. 
I also cooked in coconut oil over medium heat.  This was better and easier than fried chicken. Winner dinner!!

This was great. Kinda like turning chicken into desert. I did add ginger, and curry. I think I will bake it next time rather than fry. But this will be made again.

I had quite a bit of coconut milk/egg mixture left, even though I dipped the chicken twice. We are trying to stay from fried foods, so I oven-fried the chicken in rice oil and served it with pineapple slices and banana sprinkled with cinnamon and added to the baking sheet near the end.

No coconut so I used ground almonds instead.  I added a 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning , a few shakes of salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. This was wonderful. I can't wait to make it the way the recipe is written

I was disappointed with the flavor.  I added salt, ginger, and stevie to the coconut mixture and was disappointed with how bland it was.

It was pretty bland and most of the coconut didn't stay on the chicken.  I think I would use finer coconut and maybe add ginger or some other spices!!
