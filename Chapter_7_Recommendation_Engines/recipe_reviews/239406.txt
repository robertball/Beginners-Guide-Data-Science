These fries were really good.  Very easy to make.  I put melted butter and all other ingredients into a plastic bag and rubbed all over the potatoes.  Saved washing a pan.  Turned out very well.

My fries came out great the kids liked them. The smaller you get them the crispier.

Made these tonight to go along with cheeseburgers and corn. Easy to make and so much better than store bought frozen ones! Thank you for sharing :)

Just wonderful!  I finished mine off under the broiler to brown them up a bit.  Will definitely make these often!

Spot on PERFECT.  I cut all different thicknesses and had a variety of crunchy pieces and soft pieces.

Gorgeous and so quick to make! I added a teaspoon of lazy chillies to the butter and oil just to spice them up and they were amazing!! Husbands added them to his favourites list so I'll definitely be making them again
