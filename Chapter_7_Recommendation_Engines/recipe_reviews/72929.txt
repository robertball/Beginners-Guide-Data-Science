This is my own recipe so of course I'm going to give in a bunch of stars. :-)  I noticed that the posted recipe is missing some of the ingregdients.  I also add freshly ground pepper and sea salt to the meat mixture, some 1 tbs dehydrated onion, 2 cloves of garlic instead of one and Worcestershire sauce sould be TBS not tsp and after the meat is in the dish I top it was more freshly ground pepper and ground sea salt.  Also another note: if you use Pyrex you don't need the cookie sheet.

This was soooo easy!  I loved it!  I also added a topping during the last 5 minutes!  The topping I added was:  1/3 cup ketchup, 1 TBLS Worchestershire Sauce, 2 tsp brown sugar.  The family really enjoyed it too!  (Oh, don't forget to make sure you have enough LP in the tank!  Oops!)

I don't know that their is an ultimate meatloaf recipe- Ive tried several and they all turned out great. I wasn't all that impressed with the recipe for this specifically but made a meatloaf mixture to suit our family and LOVED the method of cooking! I set mine on the cookie sheet over medium heat and the texture and taste was amazing. The fact that it cooks quickly without heating my house in the summer makes this a grand slam!

Now I wonder what else I can cook on the grill!?!

Cooking this dish on the grill takes boring old meatloaf to a whole different level.  We used the ground pork and beef but I added the thing we usually use in regular meatloaf...chopped onion, crushed crackers, a pinch of nutmeg, and the ketchup sauce to top it off.  This will definitely be asked for at my house.  DH loved and DS loved it.  Thanks!

My household loved it! The method of cooking was the best. I used 1lb ground turkey and half a pound ground beef then added tons of chopped celery, chopped onion and canned mushrooms. I also mixed in some sharp cheddar cheese and spices then topped with the ketchup glaze suggested by another reviewer. We will eat this again for sure.

I made this for my very picky husband and he ate it all up. I followed another reviewers suggestion and made the ketchup, brown sugar and worchestershire sauce topping. The topping completed the dish.

This is so good. Who'd think we'd be eating meatloaf in 90* weather. I used #3 pounds of ground beef.I used the ingredients you wrote plus a couple of my own. I used my old pyrex pie plate that's dingy, so it didn't matter what that turned out like. I got it a little over done on the bottom, [like I haven't done that in the oven] This had a nice smokey taste to it, that made it different then the oven.I put ketchup on about the last 45 min. of cooking. Took about 2 1\2 hrs. I'll be making this one again for sure. Thanks.

I used ground turkey & pork, because of other reviews saying it was bland I really spiced it up. We live in San Diego & I have a Mexican spice called Pozole y Menudo but I use it for salads, soups etc, it's a combo of oregano, chiles, garlic, onion, salt & cilantro seed. I also used V8 to keep it moist, chopped onion. I put on a cookie sheet & baked in a 350 degree oven for 1 hr. Stayed moist & very flavorable.

I was really excited to try this but found it to be a bit bland. I love trying new things on the grill so I will probably spice it up a bit and try it again

This was an excellent dinner for us during the hot summer months and no A/C. Used a combination of ketchup, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce for the topping and small chunks of hoop cheese mixed in with meat. Will most definitely use this recipe for the summer months.

Nothing special.  Confessedly, I did not us the grill, but I added onions (mom's meatload always had 'em).  My husband had to use hot sauce and I had to use ketchup.  I'll be looing for a more flavorful recipe.

I found this VERY bland.  My husband liked it though, but he smothered it in hot sauce and mustard.  It needs other spices added to it, perhaps salt and pepper and some other flavorings.

I used this recipe more for the cooking method than the meatloaf recipe portion. For me I'm picky about my meatloaf so I made it as I normally would. I didn't use a pie pan for the, but a smaller square Pyrex dish and I skipped using a cookie sheet and placed it right on my grill grate. For summer in Colorado it's great to have a way I can make meatloaf without having to heat up my house. For anyone wanting to try this all I say is use your own eat loaf mix, everyone has one and tends to prefer what they are use to.

The combination of ground turkey and pork is part of what made this recipe so unique to regular Meatloaf.  I doubled the breadcrumbs, garlic, Italian seasoning and Worcestershire sauce in the recipe and topped the uncooked loaf by sprinkling about 1 tsp each of Rosemary and Thyme.  I omitted the mushrooms simply because I didn't have any on hand though I will add them next time. FANTASTIC flavor coming off the grill!  Even my picky 4 year old scarfed it down!

I made this today for our Father's Day gathering, with some simple changes. I used 1 lb. ground pork, 1 lb. ground turkey, 2 lbs. ground chuck. Added diced onion, omitted the mushrooms and made a glaze of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar that I spread on the top. We loved it! So nice to have meatloaf in the summer without heating up the kitchen with the oven on for an hour.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It is one of our favorite low calorie meals but it still tastes wonderful with the mixed pork and ground turkey. It tasted so much better than meatloaf in the oven. The only thing I did differently was I added about 1/2 cup of chopped onion to the meatloaf. For the sauce, I combined ketchup, worcestershire sauce and a little brown sugar. I added the sauce to the meatloaf about 15 minutes before the meatloaf was done cooking. Great Recipe!!
