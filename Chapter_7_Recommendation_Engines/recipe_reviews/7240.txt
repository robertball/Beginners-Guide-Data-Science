I used all bread flour and light sour cream instead of regular. This had to be the most perfect loaf of bread I've ever made, but sourdough it was not. It tasted like a regular white bread but the texture was incredible, the inside was so soft and spongy and the crust was crisp without being crunchy or thick and it was just the right color. It also freezes well and makes excellent toast.

This recipe is fantastic.  I used all bread machine flour because I didn't have any barley flour either.  I also used low fat sour cream.  Honestly you couldn't tell the diffence.  Also, after the first kneading and rise, I added one small onion chopped up to the bread machine and let it work into the loaf on it's own.  It made the house smell wonderful and gave the bread an absolutely fabulous taste.  I am so impressed with this recipe.  You have to try it.

Terrific recipe. Had to use all bread flour as didn't have barley flour or potato flakes and also used fat free sour cream. Bread still came out beautifully fluffy and tastily tangy. Thank you.

Great bread!  Was a little sweeter than the typical sourdough, but a great bread.  I used fat free sour cream and added fresh minced garlic and fresh rosemary to the dough - yum!

This recipe was very good as printed.  I also did another version that turned out well to serve with Mexican dishes:  add finely chopped fresh garlic and jalepeno peppers (to taste, I put in 4 of each), and 2 T. cornmeal.

A very tasty, easy to make bread. I tried it several times, in my bread machine & in the oven (it still worked great). Not quite like real sourdough, but, a good substitute.   I did make a few minor changes to add more of a 'sour tang' to the bread. I used 1 cup of real sour cream & 1 1/2 tablespoons of vinegar & a 1/4 cup more flour. It turned out tangy & chewy with a nice crust. My hubby & 3 yr old both devour this bread, they'll eat it right out of the oven.

I have made this bread recipe many times and it is wonderful.  I like it because you don't have to wait for a starter to ripen.  It's a quick fix at any time.

Excellent flavor and texture and the crust is amazing (I set the crust control to medium).  This one is definitely a "keeper".  I didn't have barley flour and ran out of bread flour so I used mostly all purpose flour and added 1 Tbs. Vital Wheat Gluten.  It baked up nice and tall ~ so nice and tall that I'm glad I didn't scale it up to a 2 lb. loaf.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

This baked perfectly in my bread machine. Very soft and fluffy inside. I used all bread flour since I didn't have barley flour. Great recipe!

My reviews are all based on my use of the recipe without the barley flour. I used only bread flour. I cannot say how the bread would be with the barley flour. It's great without it!

This recipe was very good! I used all bread flour, used 0% Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and added some white vinegar for extra tang. Probably about 1.5 Tbs. These changes do make it taste sour although not as sour as a true sourdough. We loved it! Served it at a family dinner and everyone commented how great it was.

I followed this recipe but lacked a lot of ingredients--no potato flakes, no barley flour, shortage of white flour, and low on sour cream.  Even with having to omit potato flakes, supplement the 3 cups of bread flour with 1/2 cup of whole wheat because I ran out, and replacing over half of the sour cream with nonfat Greek yogurt...and also adding 2 crushed garlic cloves to the cycle for garlic sourdough bread...it is still one of the best breads out of my machine yet!  I'm thankful this basic recipe could withstand so many substitutions and still be awesome!

DON"T make this bread if you are truly set on a sourdough flavor.  DO make this bread if you want a delicious slice of heaven.  The bread has a wonderful texture, soft crust and delightful flavor.  I used all bread flour, mixed in my kitchenaid, kneaded, raised (twice), then baked in a covered clay casserole.  I preheated my clay for 1/2 hour in a 450* oven, then placed my loaf on parchment paper and used it to gently lift my loaf into the hot vessel.  I baked in 450* oven covered for 35 minutes, then uncovered for 10-15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 190*  IMPORTANT--Let your loaf rest for 1-2 hours before cutting into it.  If not, the steam escapes your loaf leaving you with a dried out mass of dough.  If my bread lasts tonight--what am talking about--ha.  Not a problem; I'll just throw together another loaf tomorrow.  It's that easy!

Try adding 1 teaspoon of white vinegar and you will get the "sour" taste some thought it was missing.  Great recipe!

No bread machine, just a Kitchen Aid mixer. I proofed the yeast with the sugar and warm water in the mixer bowl for ten minutes, then added the melted butter and sour cream. After they had been well combined, I added all the dry ingredients. I did have to add an additional half cup of flour to help bind the dough enough to get it to jump on the hook. I let it knead with the hook for about five minutes, then set it to rise in a greased bowl which I covered for about an hour. I then formed it into a loaf and set it to rise again for another 45 minutes. Baked it at 350* for about a half hour. Not sourdough, but the bread has a nice twang and came out almost creamy-tasting. Very good spread with salted butter. I plan on serving it with Resteraunt Quality Baked Potato Soup. NOTE: My family ate the whole loaf. This one is a favorite of theirs.

Wow, this bread is excellent!  I kept it at the 1.5 lb loaf size, and I'm glad I did because scaled to 2 lbs it would have outgrown my machine!  I increased the sour cream to 1 cup since my machine is a convection and tends to dry out bread.  I didn't have barley flour (I can't have it) so I just all purpose non-bleached whole wheat flour for all of the flour.  I used flax seed oil, added some wheat germ and flax meal, and also 1 Tbsp of vital wheat gluten (could be why it was soooo light & fluffy!).  I don't know if it was the extra sour cream, but it did taste "sour".  I loved the texture much more than true sourdough and wow - what an easy recipe!

Without a doubt, this is the best bread I've ever eaten. My whole family gobbled this bread up in two days. I typically don't care much for real sourdough because I don't like the sweetness. I love the sour flavor from the sour cream, and the texture is just perfect. We'll be making this one a lot!

This bread was the best recipe I have ever made in my bread machine! It turned out beautiful and most importantly, delish! I didn't have barley flour so I used wheat in it's place. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I did customize it by slicing 6 cloves of garlic, sautéd it in a tablespoon olive oil & added in during the second kneading cycle! Yummy!

Although I wouldn't call this sourdough, it's still a very good white bread recipe. I loved the texture. I used all bread flour, as I did not have any barley flour, and also, as with all of my bread machine recipes, I used milk in place of water.

This was very tasty for a quick recipe and for what I had on hand.  I did have to substitute AP Flour for Bread Flour...which probably made for a denser loaf...but still yummy.  Althought next time I will make sure to use bread flour.  The only hint I have - I didn't have time to wait for sour cream to come to room temp.  So, I used very hot water, wisked the sour cream with it, tested the temp and it was perfect...plus, I think it made the bread combine quicker.  Will do again.

This bread was so good I had to do my very first review! Probably the softest, most moist bread I've baked to date. My husband is still complimenting me! I used 2.5 tsps of bread machine yeast having run out of dry yeast and it rose too high and then fell. Since there will definitely be a next time, I'll try it with less yeast. Otherwise, perfect!!

As other reviewers have said, this bread was excellent! The only thing i changed is that I added 1/2 a cup of wheat flour instead of barley flour like one reviewer suggested, and I also omitted the potato flakes because I did not have any. It still came out very tasty---thanks for this wonderful recipe, Bill!!! I will definitely make this again!!!!

I used 3 c. regular all-purpose unbleached flour instead of bread or barley flour.  It turned out wonderful!!  The whole loaf was inhaled by our family of 6 in 1 sitting.  I can't wait to try different twists on this.

I don't know that I would call this much of a sourdough, but it is one of the finest loaves of white bread ever to come out of my bread machine. This is going to be my go-to recipe when I want a loaf of white bread for sandwiches or french toast.

Perfect! This bread turned out perfettissimo; and this was the First try on my new breadmachine! used olive oil and 2/3rds white flour to 1/3 whole wheat. didn't rise as high as I expected, probably due to messing up the order of the ingredients. anyway, big applause from the hubby = great encouragement to try more bread recipes. Thanks!

First of all Bill …LOL …terrible name for a recipe! I am no purist and will shamelessly sneak faux into just about any dish. But, my goodness, I do have my pride and couldn’t hardly get myself to try something that starts out with fakery blatantly advertised in the name! I think I will rename it to something more elegant for further personal use.  I want to pretend to like sourdough bread but every time I buy store bought I am disappointed at the wang in it that isn’t that appealing to me. But I do always like the sourdough breads they often use, toasted, on pricey burgers. Couldn’t resist trying this since I didn’t need a starter. Used all bread flour, mixed sour cream with warm water to expedite, as someone else suggested, and added finely chopped onion at my BM “fruits and nuts” add beep, as another reviewer did. While it was in the machine I was anxious the bread wasn’t going to rise enough but slowly, toward the end of the cycle, it came to life and rose to a perfect size and height. I am always leery of recipes that use 1 ½ tsp of jar yeast instead of the equivalent of an envelope; RapidRise says this is 2-¼ tsp.  But I did use exactly the amount in the recipe. It smelled great with the onions (don’t recommend adding them if you have French Toast in mind though, pretty strange) and recipe made great bread, but like others it wasn’t the sourdough I was hoping for. Nice and soft though. Putting this one in my BM recipes notebook to use often. By the way Allrecipes doesn’t

This is yummy bread, sweet with a very mild tang. I made it for dinner guests and we gobbled up the whole loaf. Will make it again. I didn't give it 5 stars just because I wouldn't call it sourdough- it wasn't tangy enough for that. I did use 3 cups of bread flour instead of the barley flour...maybe barley would make it tangier....I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

This bread came out as a huge loaf!  YUM.  It didn't really taste like sour dough, so people who don't usually like sour dough would like this.  Everyone liked it.  Great to use as toast in the morning.

Enjoyable loaf of bread.  Like others have already mentioned, despite the title, I detected no hint of sourdough flavor.  If you disregard the somewhat misleading recipe title, then the loaf itself works as directed and tastes very good.  It has a bright white color with a soft texture and slightly crusty exterior.

Delicious bread! Very soft and moist. It looked perfect too.. rose up beautifully. It doesn't quite taste like sourdough, but it tastes awesome! We used the bread machine to make the dough, and then baked it in the oven. We find our breads come out nicer shaped that way.

Delicious! It doesn't taste exactly like sourdough, which is why I left off one star. But it is very moist and soft, the crust is a little bit crunchy and it makes a beautiful loaf (the best looking loaf I've ever made). I skipped the potato flakes and barley though.

I added a dash of lemon juice to the sour cream and allowed it to sit for a few minutes...this gave a more "sour" flavor. Beautiful in taste and appearance for a bread machine loaf!

This bread is delicious! I added a tablespoon of gluten, and used margarine instead of oil, and it turned out as tasty as can be! The crust was just right (not too crusty) and the loaf itself was lightly-sour with a nice chewiness! Mmmmmmmmm!!!

Nice bread.  A tad tangy with a soft crumb . . .and it rises very well.  I made in the bread machine on the dough setting, then took it out and let it rise in the pan for a half hour, then baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  Turned out well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Dread-ful.  I was careful to measure properly, but it was awful, the only thing I did differently was I had fat free sour cream in the house, so I substituted it... That may have been the error

This is no real sourdough but it sure is tasty. I just pulled mine out of the machine a few minutes ago and tried it. I'd compare it to a crusty French bread. Delicious and probably will make great toast in the morning with pb & jam on top. I left my sour cream out on the counter for 30 minutes before putting it in the machine. Not room temp, but not fridge cold either. Will make again for sure but I will also keep looking for that perfect sourdough recipe for the bread machine.

Such a versatile recipe!! I didn't use the barley or potato flakes, just bread flour and everything else the recipe called for.  For my oil, I used Wildtree Roasted Garlic Grapeseed oil.  For my second batch, I used homemade onion dip instead of plain sour cream.  Delicious!

This is the best loaf ever to come out of my machine!!  I mostly just use the dough setting in winter, as I prefer loaf pan/oven baked bread, but have to use the machine in summer (I live in very hot El Paso, Tx!), so I keep trying to find loaves that are acceptable using the full bake cycle. This one is so good, I'm not even trying to do it in the oven!  I use non-fat greek yogurt as it seems to be a little "tangy-er" than sour cream. I wouldn't call this bread "sourdough", but it's definetly not "plain white bread"! Thanks, Bill - I will be forever grateful to you for this!

This was the first time ever that I used a bread maker and it turned out quite good. The reason for 4 stars is like others say it's not very sourdoughy. But it made quite a tasty loaf of bread and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again!

Not crazy about the flavor of this.  I wanted tang, but it wasn't even noticeable to us.  Still, an okay white bread recipe.  Thanks for letting me try.

This was an okay bread.  I don't know that I would give it the Sourdough name or not.  I was hoping for more of a kick.  I will probably make it again, but not as a sourdough replacement recipe.

I thought this bread was good.  Soft on the inside and a bit crusty on the outside.  I didn't use the barley flour.  I didn't get the tange as stated in the introduction, but enjoyed it nonetheless.

This is great!  Not quite sourdough, but that's why it's pseudo sourdough.  The sour cream does add a little bit of sour tang to it.  I didn't have barley flour so I used all bread flour and this is the first time I ever used my husband's breadmachine, so easy!!  I'm eating my first slice now...sorry I couldn't wait for it to cool down.  Thank you!

this is the best bread machine bread i've ever made. Very Although it wasn't much like sourdough, it  was very moist and flavorful . I made a two pound recipe for my two pound bread machine, but I would recommend using only a recipe for 1 1/2 lb. loaf.  It was pushing on the top of my machine! I also liked the lighter crust. It seems no matter what my breads come out with a really hard crust, and thats using the basic setting (1), but this crust was much softer. will make again!

Like people said, not super sourdoughy, but I disagree that it's just like regular white bread.
It has a tang to it and has much more flavor than a regular loaf of white bread.  It also rises well, has a great crust, and is nice and soft inside.
Makes a great sandwich and also makes **amazing** french toast. I highly recommend this bread.

It is delicious. I doubled the recipe for my bread machine and used the dough setting. Once it finished I turned it out and divided it into 3 loaves. My bread pans make a smaller loaf and it was perfect making 3. I did not have enough sour cream to double the amount so supplemented the difference with Duke’s mayo. It is the most delicious creamy bread!! This has become my go to bread for sure.

Excellent bread! we made this for Thanksgiving instead of rolls and made the right choice. Moist and fluffy that tasted similar to sourdough. It was a perfect mix between sourdough and white bread. Super easy too! I'm going to make this instead of white bread from now on.

This is my new FAVORITE white bread for sandwiches! Don't let the name throw you off -- it doesn't have the texture or tang of sourdough, instead it reminds  me of an amped up buttermilk bread.  The crust and crumb are wonderful because of the custardy goodness of the sour cream. I've made this bread several times now (it's that good!), using all bread flour (as recommended by the contributor), because I don't stock barley flour in my pantry. In experimenting, I have added 1/2c of shredded cheese to the recipe (Mexican blend is what I like best).  It adds a subtle depth of flavor to an already fantastic recipe.

I love the way this bread tastes and the crust is a perfect level of crispy. However, every time I make it, it caves in the middle. Other bread recipes don’t, so I don’t think it’s a problem with the machine. I noted reviews that mention adding a tablespoon of wheat gluten, so I’ll try that next time.

Not sour at all. The sour cream gives it a wonderful flavor and this bread is light and fluffy. My husband at the whole loaf last night. I was lucky to get one slice. Super delicious with ham.

I made this bread today and the family has already devoured it.  I did use all bread flour  ( I did not have barley or dried potato flakes). No matter, the bread is Delicious! Another loaf in the machine now.  FYI - Topped with homemade bread machine jelly!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Though good, it was not a "sour dough", it was simply a white bread.

The taste and texture of this bread is great. However I made it twice one after the other and had the same problem occur, in that the top sunk in after it started baking within about 10 min. Why would this be. In the second attempt I backed off a bit on the water as I've read that could be the problem, to much liquid. That did not help, not a little. The would be smooth and formed nice right up to baking time. Then it sinks 1&1/2 to 2 inches. Any thoughts here?

I was in charge of something a bread item for Thanksgiving dinner and, wanting something that was still warm for dinner on the other side of town (and with classically tardy family), machine bread came to mind.  This recipe was perfect- not exactly sourdough, not exactly potato bread, and it works!  My mom sent me home with the rest of the mashed potatoes but told me she was keeping the bread!

I agree with most reviewers that it did not taste like sourdough. However, it was very good! Moist, rises well, no bitterness, etc.
Unlike most, I went to the trouble to find barley flour-  finally got it from a specialty grocer. Made by Bob's Red Mill Flour, Co. I figured maybe that is why most (who use all bread flour) said it doesn't taste like sourdough but adding this flour apparently wasn't the key. Although I did really like the flavor and will definitely make it again -with the barley flour! Only substitution I made was to use honey instead of sugar.

This is my go to recipe for bread. I adjust it to 16 servings for my 2 lb bread machine. I use all bread flour and it is perfect every time.I use all bread four. I've been making this one for years. It's nit a true sourdough bread.

I used this recipe to make the dough in my bread machine then divided it into two loaf pans to rise.  This bread was excellent, probably the best I ever made.  I used one cup of whole wheat pastry flour because that is what I had, and the rest bread flour.  Now I am trying the same recipe using YOGURT instead of sour cream.  We shall see what happens.

This is one of the best I've tried to date!  Flavorful and airy on the inside.  My kids loved it.  I only used bread flour because that's all I had and I didn't use potato flakes because I didn't have any and it still came out great.  I just started my second loaf.

This has been my go-to bread recipe for years. I recently decided to try using whole wheat flour and it worked out great! I have changed the recipe slightly: no potato flakes, Greek yogurt subbed for sour cream, and add a few tsp of vital wheat gluten.

The best bread I have ever made in my bread machine, was made with potato flakes!  Everyone loved it!  Maybe for the barley flour, I would add whole wheat flour instead

Positively the best bread machine recipe I have ever found! I mixed it in the bread machine but then baked it in the oven for a perfect crust. Bread was gone in one meal for a family of five! YUM!

I think this is my first review! My family is ADDICTED to this bread. I am a newbie to the bread world, I just got a machine for christmas and have been playing with some recipes. I think in the last 4 days Ive made 6 loaves of this. I took the liberty of playing with the recipe after seeing other people doing it so I too used all bread flour and I substituted the sour cream for plain greek yogurt (all I had in the fridge) and it came out amazing light and fluffy and airy. I have a loaf in the machine right now that I used sour cream on and am excited to see if there is any real differnce. One of my faves!

This recipe is awesome as is. No changes necessary. The only thing I did not have on hand was barley flour so I used 3 cups of all purpose flour. I have made it three times now and it comes out perfect every time. Makes awesome grilled cheese sandwiches.

Awesome! Used all Bread flour instead of the barley flour and it turned out to be the best bread I have ever made. I have a black and decker 1.5lb machine and IGNORING the manufacturer's instructions to put the yeast in last has made all the difference. Put the yeast in with the liquid ingredients and stir,then add the dry ingredients. THANKS for posting this it will be a staple at our house for sure.

I live at 6244 ft elevation in CO, followed my bread maker suggestions, still fell in the middle. I did add slices of freah garlic.Since I was unsure if the middle of the bread was going to be done, I added 7 minutes of the bake cycle after the original cycle was complete. I have cut the loaf in half and it is done and the texture looks great. I am taking it to a church fundtion tonight so hopefully it will taste as good as it smells and looks on the inside. I will continue to try this recipe again.

Bread was very, very good.  I had some whole barley grain, so I ran some through a food processor, and sifted out the hard chaff (even though that probably has a lot of nutritional value).  My only complaint is this in no way resembles sourdough bread flavor--it is more like a rye bread, just barley flavored.

Excellent bread... but I agree with other reviewers and won't call it "Sourdough" in my files.  Next time I will add a little more salt though.  Made it with fat-free sour cream and it was plenty moist & yummy on the inside with a nice crispy crust.  A keeper!

Chewy inside, crusty outside.  Nothing sour at all about the flavor.  Used rye in lieu of barley because of availability.  Had to add 2 T of water at 5 min.  Good bread.  A keeper.

I don't know what happened.  Everyone else seems to have had good luck with this bread.  

Mine came out low and flat on top with a sinking center.  Every other bread recipe I have tried from Allrecipes has been excellent  I was really anticipating a good product. 

What did I do wrong?  Any suggestions?

This is so good! It's not sourdough, but it's incredibly flavorful. I make it with whole wheat flour, and add flax seeds. This is the only wheat bread I can get my kids to eat. My new defacto bread recipe!!!
