This is a very quick and tasty recipe. I have made it several times and have used cabbage in place of bamboo shoots and other veggies as well. I also put about 1/3 cup of white wine because I like the taste of a wine sauce.

This is a very versatile recipe. I added garlic pepper red pepper and onion flakes to boost up the flavor a bit. I've made it with chicken and also with shrimp. It's easily adjusted to what you have in your pantry.

My family enjoyed this recipe more than I thought they would. It didn't have as much "punch" as I like but our kids have more of a subdued palet. They did like the baby corn and even the bamboo shoots. I would recommend spicing it up a little with some type of oriental spices. Other than that quick easy and versatile.

Tastes great...I used brocolli snow peas mushrooms and chicken. Be sure not to let simmer too long. Some of the veggies got a little mushy while I waited on my rice.

BLAND! i like the components of this recipe and i gave it a trial run. unfortunately none of the ingrediants have much flavor of their own so you end up with a pan full of stuff waiting for some flavor to enhance. BLAND BLAND BLAND. you'd be better of just buying some frozen pre-packaged meal and nuking that in the microwave.

Doesn't sound very good at all. So leave out the mushroom soup and the cream. Make a chicken broth (using chicken thighs) shred chicken meat. Throw everything together put in a cup of washed white rice and season with soy sauce.

This is a great use of leftover chicken. To speed things up I used a bag of frozen oriental vegetables and it made a delicious and quick meal.

It was just kind of bland. I loved the veggie mix but just seemed like it need some extra spice or something. I added garlic but that didn't help much.
