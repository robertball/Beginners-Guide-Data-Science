Edible but not impressive.  Self-rising flour plus 2 tsp. bak. pwdr. seems like too much leavening, but I went by the recipe.  Also, think 8x8 pan is too small. It ended up quite dense, and the top cracked.  Not much for flavor, and the applesauce was even cinnamon flavored.  I would like to see another recipe that is somewhat comparible. Maybe I just had a bad day.
