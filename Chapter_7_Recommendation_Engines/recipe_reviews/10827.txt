They spread out A LOT crisp easily and have an odd texture. Wouldn't make again but thanks for the creative recipe.

At first these scared me then they really grew on me. I liked them better the next day with a cup of coffee. Very easy to make.

These are super easy - I've not made this particular recipe but I make one just like it using an envelope of buttermilk biscuit mix (Martha White or White Lily) and an envelope of instant potato flakes. I add chopped pecans to my recipe and use vanilla extract. I'll have to give the coconut extract a try in my recipe!:-)

These are quite good. They do not flatten in the oven so you can put quite a few on one pan. I used almond extract instead of coconut and they are not overly sweet subtle and moist. Its a great way to use an abundance of potato flakes. To the reviewer asking about sweet potato flakes I say go fo it but do not use as much sugar and use a complimentary extract like orange instead of coconut.

I'm wondering if anyone has ever done this recipe with sweet potato flakes? I bought a package but they're two rich and sweet for my fiance and I to eat with dinner. Theres one more envelope left and I don't want to waste it.

I have been looking for this recipe for years! My grandmother used to make these and I have memories from childhood of their crispy edges coconutty goodness and chewy-flaky texture. I had my fingers crossed that this was the recipe and one bite told me it was! It's pretty amazing when a cookie can bring tears to your eyes.

I followed directions as I did about 40 years ago and I liked them. Brings back memories.
