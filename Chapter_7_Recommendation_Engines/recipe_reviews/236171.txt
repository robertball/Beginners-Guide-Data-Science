I've never had quinoa before, but surprised how much we all really liked this. I followed the ingredients as stated for 8 servings, but changed the dressing to 6 servings. Maybe if you're making 24 hours in advance you'd need that much dressing, but it was very nice and moist after four hours of marinating, as you can see by my photo. This salad presents very nicely and would be great for company or potlucks. I served with some cherry tomatoes and avocado slices which eventually got mixed in, a nice addition to a Mexican salad.

I have NEVER made a quinoa dish as delicious as this! The fast prep time also makes for a stress-free, post-work meal. I tweaked the recipe only a smidge: for both my quinoa and brown rice, I used vegetable broth, doubled the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon, cut the 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt and instead used 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, and added one diced avocado. Affordable and convenient. Absolutely fantastic! Thank you for sharing!!

Love it! Follow the recipe for th most part. I only used 1 1/2 cups of red quinoa, but that turned out to be plenty! I had bacon I needed to use, so I diced it up and cooked it, and it turned out to be great addition. I also added chick peas, and all colors of bell peppers to give it more color. I didn't have all the seasonings for the dressing, so I bought a premixed taco seasoning, which had the seasonings suggested for the recipe plus some other herbs. The salad turned out amazing, and was great addition to my bbq. Of note, my salad turned out to be a lot more than I was expecting.

I love quinoa salad and when this one had the word mexican in front of it I figured it couldn't lose. I was right. It is ridiculous good! Of course I made changes because: don't like corn in salads, don't like raw garlic in salad(so I used garlic powder), didn't have pinto beans -so I used black beans. Oh, and I am addicted to chipotle chili powder so I used a smidge of that for part of the chili powder. It is a great base salad recipe to work your own little personality into!

I'm a big fan of Quinoa salads and I stumbled upon this one because I was looking for one that didn't have lime in it and had red wine vinegar. I had to make some adjustments as I didn't have any beans either. I added the everything along with cucumbers, left out the salt and pepper, I like to add individually afterwards. I cut back the oil to 2/3 and added 1/3 of the vinegar. I haven't even let the flavours marinate together yet but snuck a bite and it is really tasty. Looking forward to what the family thinks tonight. I know they will love and this one will be a hit. Definitely give it a try.

I made this recipe for company and it was a hit. I did make changes-used all pinto beans, all quinoa, garlic powder instead of fresh, and lime juice and rice vinegar for the dressing--had no red wind vinegar. The main thing I changed was to leave out the oil completely. I compensated for the liquid with extra vinegar and a little water. The salad was delicious and not dry at all. Will definitely be added to the summer salad rotation. Thank you!

I liked this recipe quite a bit even though I'm not usually a fan of brown rice or quinoa. It did make a huge batch so I will cut it in half next time.

This is amazing salad. I pack quinoa salads for me and my husband for lunches and this is one his favorites, I am definitely adding it to our lunch salad rotations. I followed the recipe as it was listed and it came out fantastic, very flavorful.

(hint): for first time quinoa cookers; when cooking the quinoa bring it to a good boil. Once quinoa is at a good boil turn the heat completely off. Then let sit with a tight fitting lid for the allowed amount of cooking time. Turns out great every time. This also works for bulgur wheat.

I made this today for dinner today.  Pretty good.  I cooked it however.  Didn't want to eat a cold meal .  Lightly sauteed the onions and peppers, added the beans , cooked for about 10 minutes and removed from the stove.  Added the grains, cilantro, and the dressing, mixed and let it stand.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some quinoa, and tried this.  VERY good, easy to toss together, and it keeps well in the refrigerator.  I'm adding it to my "go-to" salad recipes, but might amp up the heat by adding a finely-chopped jalapeño next time.

The only change I ade were to the beans. I didn't have pinto or kidney beans, so I used black beans and northern beans. It was very good and will make again. Great way to use Quinoa.

We don't care for beans so I skipped those and added 1 lb. of diced chicken. Also skipped the cayenne pepper in deference to the younger kids. Delicious!

Had high hopes for this but it wasn't super flavorful.  Even added some lime juice and extra vinegar and was just ok.

I made this as written, but was concerned about adding a whole red onion.  The small onion was 2 cups chopped and overwhelmed the flavor of the dish.  I removed one cup - which took some time, and the flavor was much better.  My husband doesn't like quinoa, but liked this salad.  We also add pickle juice from the Mezzetta Jalapeno Peppers when we eat this as the dressing is a little mild for our taste.  I would make again for a pot luck but reduce the onion to 1/2 cup, reduce oil, increase vinegar and garnish with tomato and avocado.

I made this with a minimal changes. I had no kidney or pinto beans so I opted for chick peas instead. And I added a dash of cumin to flavor it up a notch, just a pinch. I gave it 4 stars as I did not have to make many changes and it is a super filling salad. Just a small dish and your full. I will make this again, although next time I would like to try a taco seasoning packet as one user had suggested.

First, I did enjoy this salad.  Very refreshing and filling.   But not stand out.   But that may have been the small changes.   I halved the recipe as I am cooking for one.  Then I used only red quinoa, no rice, and only pinto beans.  The dish was not spicy to me, but I subbed a little jalapeño infused olive oil for regular, and only added the recommended cayenne.  Still, nice mix of fresh ingredients, visually appealing.  Will play with seasonings to get more distinct flavor.

This is delicious! I did make it a little differently, but I think it would also be great as written. I had started making a quinoa enchilada casserole before I decided on this salad,  so I had cooked the quinoa in a chicken/tomato broth with garlic. I also had about 2 cups of leftover white rice that I put in for the brown rice (I think brown rice would be delicious), and leftover chopped cucumber that I added. It seems like a very versatile and forgiving recipe!

It isn't always that the picture up top matches how the dish turns out, but this one did! While good the way written, I will personalize it a bit for ourselves next time around.

Edit
1/2 cup olive oil was still a bit much 
1 can pinto beans
1/2 can garbanzo
1/2 can kidney beans 
3 cups quinoa, no rice

The only change I made was I substituted Cayenne with Franks Red Hot.  I took it to a BBQ, and everyone raved about how awesome the salad was.

The entire family loved this! We ended up using this as the "meat" for a taco salad, throwing it on top of lettuce, lime hinted tortilla chips, tomatoes, and sour cream.  I added a little lime and lemon to the dressing, and substituted black beans for the pinto beans.  I also had some grilled fish left over that I threw on top.  It definitely was one of my favorite quinoa recipes, and will make again!

I doubled it, added a mix of garbanzo beans, kidney beans & pinto beans, & added approximately 1-1/2 lbs. of cooked ground lamb that I had left over from another meal. It was great! My family includes younger & older children, so I left out the cayenne pepper, but added more chili powder. Everybody came back for seconds! I will make this again.

This recipe is amazing. I make it for my lunches through the week, but beware the onion breath! A small price to pay for the deliciousness. Great for busy families.

just made this today because I saw I had all the ingredients except the red wine vinegar. Took a little taste of it and it is awesome! Even scooped some onto tortilla chips like a salsa!  since I did not have red wine vinegar, I used a quarter cup fresh lime juice and a splash of apple cider vinegar. also subbed the red pepper for a large jalapeño.
