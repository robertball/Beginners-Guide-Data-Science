This is a delicate bread. I made it as written, not changing any ingredients. The cheese lends a strong flavor but adds in texture helping to keep it from falling apart. After cooling, I sliced it and toasted the slices in the oven to give it a bit more crunch and stability. I added some fresh rosemary on top right before baking, but next time will add spices and herbs in the batter as written in the notes. I think a milder cheese or less vinegar may be a winner here too. Thank you for the recipe.

Totally delicious bread. I made it as it written, only reduced quantity of apple cider by half.  This bread is not only gluten free but is also high protein bread without carbs. Excellent for carb free diet. Thank you! I keep making it!!

I missed the olive oil and used 1/2 cup flaxseed and 2 cups flour. I also separated the eggs and whipped the whites before folding in. a pinch of Garlic powder and 1 1/2 cups of cheese. it's really good, I am sure following the recipe would turn out as well.

i didn't have Parmesan cheese so I omitted it and followed the recipe exactly. It was ok, a bit dry and not much flavour. I'll try it again with Parmesan next time.

I followed other bakers advice and only used 1/2 of the apple cider vinegar and I added Garlic and Onion Powder. It came out perfect! I baked it for 40 minutes checked it, and put it back in for 5 more minutes. So 45 minutes total.

This is a great recipe! I added 1/2 teaspoon of onion and garlic powder, used 1TBSP of the apple cider vinegar, 2 TBSP of Olive oil and switched out the almond milk for hemp milk because that’s what I had. I also added fresh rosemary and fresh thyme to the batter. I checked the loaf at 35 and 40 mins and felt it wasn’t quite done so I added another 10 mins in 5 minute intervals. Thanks for sharing.
