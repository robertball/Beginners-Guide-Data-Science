Although I live in the South, I’m not a big sweet tea fan.  The combination of the lemonade concentrate and the sugar made this a bit too sweet, but that’s a personal taste preference.  I think the addition of more fresh lemon juice would brighten the overall flavor.

Thanks for this one. I am a Canadian now living in Australia and can't get Good Host Iced Tea … I made this (did cut the sugar to 1/2 cup) and it was amazingly good.  Also added juice of a full lemon as I had to use them up!
