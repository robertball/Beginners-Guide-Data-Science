Battery acid flavored and gummy. Dough recipe is good but the process is wrong. Cut the baking soda and reduce the boil time

As pretzels, pretty good.  A bit sweet (makes sense--sugar was more than in other pretzel recipes I've used), and I had to add 1/2 c more flour, but that's normal.  With dough you have to adjust liquid to dry ratios pretty frequently depending on the moisture in the air.  The directions leave a bit to desired, however.  I have never, and probably never will, boiled bagels or pretzels for 10 minutes.  30 seconds on each side--a minute if you are determined to get the boiling in correctly--is sufficient.  I've never had a problem.  I also just use a tall, heavy saucepan and put water and baking soda in--never a ton, probably about 2-3 tbs of baking soda to 3-4 cups of water.  These were very golden, and nice and chewy, perfectly baked at 25 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe and it tasted nasty with the baking soda bath to the point where it was not edible. The second try without the baking soda bath tasted much better. The cook time was also a bit off.

It's not the amount of baking soda, it's the time.  Slow boil, drop it in the bath, and tap the side of the pretzel with the edge of your spatula after dropping it in.  After about 10-30s in the bath, the pretzel will float after tapping.  Remove the pretzel right after it floats.

Unfortunately I hadn't read the "nasty" review first. I agree, WAY too much baking soda.  Maybe they meant 1/2 TB, not 1/2 Cup.  Sorry I wasted my tyime and money.
