I just made the plain ones... I found it odd that it didn't say to add sugar.  Next time I am going to add sugar because they were just not sweet enough but other than that, they were great.

I made the banana pancakes. I couldn’t really taste the nutmeg, but I thought they turned out well! I also substituted applesauce for the oil. I wasn’t a huge fan of the crunchy ness of the oats, since in my mind, pancakes ought to be soft. But they tasted great!
