I found this to be a very easy and wonderful flavor.  I did not have orange juice available and used mango/orange juice.  Very tender.  The family loved it.  I will be making this bread recipe for family and friends.

Not enough orange juice flavor.  I added an extra 1/2 cup blueberries to mine.  Used half whole wheat pastry flour and skim milk.  Added a handful of chopped walnuts.  I don't think the 2 minutes of beating is neccesary.  I only did mine for about one minute, but next time I wouldn't even do it that much.  Next time I'd mix the wet first, then dry seperately, then fold them together until just incorporated.  Maybe that way it wouldn't be as dense.

This was a nice, moist bread.  I did not want to mess doing orange zest so I left that out.  The orange flavor was subtle, but we liked it. I did flour my blueberries so they wouldn't sink and that worked well.

Great recipe, and so easy! Used fresh blueberries, added some pecans and used Smart Balance for the margarine and 1% milk, took about 1 1/2 hr. to bake in my oven. Reheat slices about 20 seconds in microwave and you have a great breakfast.

didn't like it.
it has a bitter taste that comes from the orange juice and it needs more sugar. I love the orange flavore with the blue berry muffins  , but I used to add only orange zest to my favorite recipe and it comes out wonderful every time.

Nice & moist texture. Loved flavors of blueberry & orange- however wasn't sweet enough.  I usually find that recipes on this site call for too much sugar, but in this case I found that more was needed.  I tried these again as muffins and doubled the brown sugar (based off a similar recipe of banana bread i have that calls for a 1.5 c of brown sugar)-better but tasted of too much brown sugar. If I made these again I would probably try 3/4 c brown sugar & 3/4 white sugar

Very good and easy to make! I used blueberries we picked which I had frozen and it was a great way to use these berries. I also added about 2 T. honey to the batter.

Turned out yummy, I was pleased. Cooking time should have been 10 minutes less for my oven and I would enjoy it a little less dense but otherwise not too sweet and certainly awesome flavor as stated!

I used sour cream instead of milk and added more sugar, as suggested by another reviewer. I used slightly more than a cup of frozen blueberries and left out the orange zest. The loaf rose beautifully and tastes great!

I really liked the moistness of this bread, but i felt that it needed a little more pizzaz! I added vanilla and a touch of ginger! YUMMY!

I really liked it.  I used 2cups of fresh blueberries - huge factor in the success of this.  The extra blueberries gave it the sweetness that may have been lacking otherwise.

Sorry but this was just not very good. It was overly dense and dry and just did not have that great of flavor. I felt it was a waste of good ingredients and a waste of calories to eat. Very disappointing.

After reading the reviews, I made the following additional:
I t. Cardamom, 1 t. Vanilla, and 1/2t. of orange extract.  After baking, I spread an orange glaze over the bread.

This recipe is easy and the finished loaf is lovely..it rose beautifully. I substituted 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour and used the juice from the fresh oranges that I zested. I used 1  1/2 cups of blueberries and I floured them as suggested.
the bread is moist and flavorful.
Definitely a keeper!

Made it following recipe and it was delicious! Cake-like and filled with blueberries, the orange zest and juice gave it a little tang. It was gone in one day!

I wish i liked this more.  It was OK; both my toddler and husband didn't like it.  I couldn't blame them.  It's edible just needs more sugar and maybe wheat flour.  Thanks for sharing; it just wasn't for me.

This bread came out amazing! It was super easy to follow the recipe and the whole family loved it! It was gone before the end of the day! I accidentally added a bit to much flour and sugar by using the incorrect measuring cup... Oops. But it still turned out fabulous! This will definitely be a bread I bake again.

We loved the consistancy and moist texture of this bread, but too much zest left a bitter aftertaste in the mouth.
