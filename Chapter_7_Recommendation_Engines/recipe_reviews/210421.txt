I make this but I do it alittle easier.. I melt the butter in the microwave and when fully melted I add that to my sugar (don't even use corn syurp), stir till well mixed than I pour that mixture over the crackers... I take a spoon and spread to make sure every cracker gets covered than I put that in the oven at 350 degrees for 6 to 7 mins or until it bubbles and gets alittle brown. When that's done I take it out and let it cool. Than I melt the choc chips in the microwave for one min, take out and stir... keep microwaving and mixing in 30 second intervals till all the choc chips are melted. Than I spread that over the cooling crackers. Again.. use a spoon to make sure every cracker is fully covered. Than you can top w/ anything but we like to top ours w/ crushed Health bar pieces. And freeze till it sets. OMG... This is one of the first things gone no matter where I take it and everyone is amazed that it's made w/ crackers.

Oh my goodness!  I made this in my parents kitchen just messing around, but it was gone FAST.  AND they were breaking off pieces before it was even cooled and coming back for more.  Very easy, this one is going in my recipe file!

This recipe is phenomenal.  I've made toffee without the saltines and there is something about those crackers that makes them go faster then my "regular" toffee.  I do them in batches using 35 saltines 1 cup sugar, 1 cup butter and 1 bag of Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips.  I use vanilla instead of corn syrup and add my nutt of choice.  SCRUMPTIOUS!

These are sooo good! The toffee prep was a snap and this came together quick and easy. The Ghirardelli Chips put it over the top (I used closer to 8 oz.) These will be added to our holiday sweets list this year for gifts and cookie/candy trays.

This turned out really good and it was so easy I followed the suggestion to melt the butter/sugar  and then the chocolate in the microwave. So much easier. It definately needed more chocolate than called for in the recipie. My husband was really skeptial at first but he really liked these.

YUM! This tastes like my fav toffee candy bar. I followed the recipe exactly. It really does take the 20 min cook time for the toffee (for some reason I thought it would reach temp sooner;nope :}). I used a 2.5 qt saucepan b/c the (hot) toffee swells during cooking. Get those almonds on quickly so they don't fall off!

First, I was watching the candy thermometer inch up to 300 degrees where it indicates hard candy, and I could smell the pan burning.  Bottom of my pan was scorched black.  Poured over saltines but it was already getting hard.  Quickly put entire bag of chips and spread.  After it hardened in the freezer, I began to break into pieces and a lot of the chocolate was separating and coming off the toffee layer.

It's so funny to make toffee on saltines, but it works! My pan only held 54 crackers, and I used a whole 11.5oz bag of chips (don't think 5 oz would be nearly enough). I've seen the other recipes that call for baking the toffee, but I trust my thermometer more, and this turned out just perfect. TRY IT!!
Update in review: Just made a half batch, couldn't stand it anymore, had to have it! One tip, for those who have problems making the almonds stick: toast them on the stove and keep warm until you need them. That way, the heat from the almonds will help melt them into the chocolate. (also a good thing to do when you're making peanut brittle!). Since I have discovered how wonderful sweet and savory are together, I also sprinkled kosher salt on top...elevates this treat to a new level!

Quite good and not difficult to make.  Makes WAY beyond 10 servings.  You *need* a candy thermometer.  TIP 1:  Watch very carefully when it goes above 310 - the last 20 degrees climbs very quickly, and it will burn within 20 seconds if you pass 350.  TIP 2:  parchment paper - not wax, not foil - is needed.  Otherwise, it will stick to the toffee as the toffee mixture seeps between the cracks/holes of the crackers.  Great for a snack when visiting someone.  Put in colorful canisters or wrap in colored transparent paper to make yummy gifts.

Very yummy, but I added more chocolate.  I made a half batch and used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips...or maybe even more :-)

Excellent recipe. This turned out so well and the instructions were clear and concise, which I appreciated. Looks beautiful, tastes awesome. My husband is not a big sweets eater and I had to keep herding him away from this. Thanks :)

SECOND time around these turned out fantastic! The first time I used an aluminum pan and it burned so bad, I had to throw it out along with the pan. The second batch, I baked in the oven like another poster suggested and it was great! WARNING: Use a HEAVY bottom pan for these. Gave it 5 stars because it tasted great and felt the pan issue was my fault.

This recipe is wonderful!  These came out amazing and will be made again as Christmas gifts.  Just one little tip, it's best to cut them up before they harden, this was they don't crumble apart.

My mom used to make these when we were kids.  Her version of the recipe came from an older lady who called them Paradise Cookies (very fitting).  I used half the sugar, otherwise this is just too sweet.  I also used vanilla instead of corn syrup, which was suggested by several other cooks.  Great suggestion!  Every time I make this someone wants the recipe!

It was delicious! I added chopped peanuts on the top. The salty touch was great with the sugar and bittersweet chocolate.

I followed the recipe and when it came time to take out of the freezer and break into pieces, the chocolate separated from the bottom layer. I made this for my husband to take to his work for the Christmas get together, I am disappointed in this recipe.

Rated with the following changes:  1/3 C White Karo Syrup; 1 C dark brown sugar, packed; 3 sticks butter (1 1/2 C); a pinch of salt.  Brought mixture to ROLLING boil over MEDIUM heat (never high) and used a candy thermometer to 240 degrees F.  Added 1 tsp. of pure vanillas AFTER removing from heat.  Stirred well, and spread over saltines.  I also used chopped pecans.
