Very good! I did cook my green beans longer than called for b/c we don't like when they are crunchy, and used a few more slices of bacon than called for. I only had red wine vinegar, so I went w/ that. This was wonderful both at room temp and cold. Loved the creaminess of the dressing. Make sure you season it w/ salt and pepper (especially salt b/c it needs it, IMO). I also added a some garlic powder. This was a hit tonight and I will def be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this for my Son as he does not like sour cream in a potato salad, all the other family does, i do not like blue cheese, so the recipe had to be tested on him, he said it was wonderful as did his partner, they are both cheese adicts, they took the recipe home with them so they could make it and take it to another bbq the next day, where there were more cheese adicts, the verdict from that bbq was brilliant and why didn't they bring a bigger dish, as there was none left, much to my sons sorrow, he made more so they could take to work for their lunch the next week, so that is why i gave it 5 stars.

This recipe is fantastic.  I doubled it with no problem, the tip about putting the potatoes on a kitchen towel really worked and completely removed the moisture from them.  The dressing is easy to make and tastes fabulous.  To be fair I did not add the olive oil, and it was still very good.  My family loved how fresh it tasted, not heavy. I quartered some hard boiled eggs and decorated the top with them. Big hit in this household! Thank you for posting this recipe, we loved it.

I thought, "Green beans in potato salad?", but it's really good.  I used 3 1/2 oz of smoked blue cheese because that's what I had.  I think the smoked cheese amplified the impact of the bacon.  I also cooked the potatoes in a pressure cooker and the beans in the microwave to save prep time.

Again, I'm not sure why my reviews are being edited considering my opinions are always fair and non judgmental. You win some, you lose some. Every reviewer should have the opportunity to write a fair, unbiased review and likewise, cooks should use their best judgment and understand that not every recipe will be a winner for everyone. So, here's my second attempt at writing an honest review. I thought this was just OK. My in-laws and (potato salad hating) hubby liked this, so maybe it's just me??? I guess I prefer a slightly sweet potato salad, or at least a less tangy one. The mustard vinaigrette was just a little overkill for me - and ditto for the blue cheese (and I LOVE the stuff!). All in all, this was decent, but nothing to write home about. Thanks anyways, Krissy. :)

I halved this but found that there was way too much dressing. I probably added half of it. It seemed a little tart so I added some sugar.  This was a nice change from regular potato salad, but I think I still prefer the regular.

I made a triple recipe for a barbeque party.  I got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I loved the combination of flavors .  This is going to be my go to potato salad recipe.

Really good. I used jalape√±o bacon (what I had defrosted), left out the green beans, but otherwise used the same ingredients (I rarely measure). My son (paleo diet kiddo) really liked it, as did I.

The green beans could have been cooked longer and the sauce was just tangy and vinegar-like.

Made this yesterday for the family and everybody loved it. Didn't have the Blue Cheese so skipped that. Used Turkey Bacon (didn't have regular Bacon). Will make it again with the cheese.

This was a really good side salad.  I didn't use the full 4ounces of Bleu Cheese, but the amount I used was really good.
