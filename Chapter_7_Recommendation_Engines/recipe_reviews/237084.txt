Very nice dish. I don't have a  stove to oven covered pot so I cooked my rice on the stovetop.. used some basmati. This is a nice base recipe that can be customized by using different veggies and seasonings. Light and filling

Skip the oven cooked rice part and just do it on the stove top or in a rice cooker.  I opted to use fresh broccoli because it was in season and I happened to have boatloads of it, but I did not cook it as long as the instructions said as I wanted my broccoli to be al dente (that's just how I prefer it) and I knew that if I cooked it for a lengthy time it would go gray on me and no thanks to that.  As mentioned by other users, this recipe is great as a base recipe and stands up to being customized.  I have made it a couple of times now, and even topped some leftovers with a fried egg & Tabasco sauce, very very good.  I am guessing that if you made a big batch of this you could top it off with some sour cream and cheddar for a casserole treatment.  Like I said... good base to work from so 4 stars.

Simple, easy and delicious! I made the rice in the traditional way. Served the dish with a lettuce, tomatoes and avocado salad with olive oil and white wine vinegar. It matched great.

It was good! I feel like there were a lot of unnecessary steps, though. I felt I could just put thawed broccoli in with the chicken to cook instead of doing the whole steaming thing. I'd also have more lemon juice - it wasn't very lemony! Still very tasty though and I'd make it again.

My family loved it! I cooked the onion separately to get the flavor our andadded sweet baby peppers & strips of ginger! It was sooo good! I didn't mix the rice with the dish because it's kind of like a fried rice. Thank you for sharing =)

Made this tonight for my family and it got 4 thumbs up.  My usual pot for rice did not have a lid that was oven safe for this high so I just cooked it completely on the stovetop (simmer on medium for the time directed above worked for me).

Fast enough for a work night, filling and tasty.  I made the rice in a pot on the stove and while it was cooking. prepped the ingredients and began cooking according to the recipe instructions.  I also used a bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower, so all I had to do was microwave it in the bag and add it to the skillet.  Next time, I may add a bit of chicken broth to moisten it near the end of the cooking time but it was delicious just as written.

Delicious! Here are a couple of key changes that would make it 5 stars. I cooked everything on the stove top, doubled the lemon, seasoned the chicken as noted and then the whole thing again after combining broccoli, rice and chicken together (with the same seasonings of onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper).

I made this as written except I used Risotto because I didn't have any regular rice and I added a lot more broccoli.  It was good as written and I was able to have a couple of servings left over for lunches.   When I reheated it the next day I added in some minced garlic and wow was that good!  I will for sure make this again and will add "lots" of garlic and maybe even some red pepper to add color and flavor.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is good. I would add salt and pepper for more seasoning next time. While the chicken was cooking I made the rice in a cooker and used microwaveable bag of broccoli. Easy and quick. Thanks!

I used fresh broccoli, and I had already cooked rice, so the steps were a little different. I sautéed the onion first, then added the chicken. Once that was cooked through, I added the rice and broccoli and lemon juice. It was kind of dry, so added some chicken broth.  Added tarragon too. Put in casserole dish, sprinkled with Parmesan, and baked at 400 for 10 minutes. Very good!

My husband and I loved it. It was light and had all we needed for a good, balanced meal. I never thought of cooking rice in the oven, but it came out well without being crunchy!

This turns out very dry and had an odd flavor. I did add asparagus since I had it, but that did t change it much. I think it needs some more liquid.  I used fresh lemons and broccoli.

Great as a base recipe!  I cooked the rice with chicken stock instead of water (great flavor), I sautéed some zucchini and corn in some butter; I sautéed the chicken with s & p, garlic and onion powder with a dusting of flour in some canola. ;I chopped some green onion and threw it all together as a casserole.  It was fantastic!

Like most of the other reviewers, I passed on making the rice in the oven and just made it on the stovetop like normal. I also decided to roast the broccoli since I just like it cooked that way better. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and left out the onion powder too since I thought it might be too "onion-y." Instead I just seasoned the chicken with basil, thyme, and oregano since I thought those would go well with the lemon and parmesan. It turned out really well! The flavor is nice - the lemon juice and zest keep it from being too bland, and the broccoli is a nice touch. It's a good option for a simple chicken and rice dish, and as other reviewers have said, it's easy to customize.

I always add salt and pepper no matter what a recipe says. I also usually add garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning and the like. I timed everything perfectly but the broccoli turned to mush when I stirred it into the rice mixture so my rice turned green. It was still delicious but I am going to sub either fresh broccoli or just warm broccoli as instructions on container. I added extra cheese but that's typical in my house. Very good.

I dialed back on the onion a little and did about 3/4 of a large onion. I just felt as though with the onion powder it was to much onion. That is the only slight Change I made. This meal is not only easy but delicious and popping with flavor. The lemon was such a nice contrast to the onion and garlic. Definitely a favorite dish between my girlfriend and I. Will for sure make again!!!

My family didn't like it at all. It was bland and the chicken dried out. I think a seasoned rice might kick it up a notch.

This was very good and tasty.  I really loved the lemony flavor of the rice and the melted parmesan.  Will definitely be making again.

This was wonderful!   I used steam in bag fresh broccoli and completely zested a medium lemon.   I also tried to get every drop of juice out of that lemon, so our dish had a nice lemon flavor to it.   Not too strong but identifiable.    Tasty, filling and unique dinner.

This recipe turned out very good! I made it "as is" in terms of seasonings.  I did add a small amount of bella mushrooms with the chicken since I had some left over and wanted to use them up. I loved the flavor! I definitely will make this again as it was easy.

It was pretty easy to make and didn't take many ingredients.  The chicken dried out.  But it isn't good enough that I would make it again.

I made this, and I loved it! I did however make one minor switch, and that was to use brown & wild rice instead of regular rice, and it was Yummy! The nutty flavor of the parmesan cheese blended with the lemon put this dish at the top of my list, so I will definitely be making  this one again!

This was so delicious! I will be making this again! The only mod I made was that I cut a corner by using rice I already had made in the rice cooker. This worked out just fine.

I made this as is except used fresh broccoli and steamed it.  This was a great last minute recipe that both my teen age girls loved.  Even my picky 13 yr old. who had two servings.  Will make this again!

This came together very quickly. We enjoyed it very much - as much on the second day as left-overs as the first. 
I did not prepare the rice in the oven. I used an Uncle Ben's quick rice dish - chicken and broccoli - and it worked just as well. I used fresh broccoli steamed for about 5 minutes. 
My husband likes cheese on everything; so, Day 2 he put a couple of slices of cheddar over the leftovers and warmed it up.

Delicious! Prepared rice and chicken per recipe. Prepared broccoli in microwave. Only change was to salt and pepper chicken as it was browning and used several garlic cloves to the onion as it was browned.

Very tasty and easy to make! I used brown rice (precooked in a rice cooker), real garlic instead of garlic powder, omitted the onion powder, and tripled the broccoli (I love broccoli . . .). I will probably use less cheese next time because I found it a bit salty for my taste, even without adding any salt.

Healthy, simple, tasty.  I cooked the rice in a cooker, steamed the broccoli in a small pot, and sauteed the chicken in a pan, then put them together, so I can't comment on the one-pot method.
