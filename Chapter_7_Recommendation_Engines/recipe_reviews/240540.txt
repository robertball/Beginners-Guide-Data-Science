SOOOOOO DELICIOUS! This is more of a cake-like brownie, just just be aware. These little gems are so moist and full of flavor, as well as being perfectly chocolate-y. Hubby went CRAZY for these and he usually only gravitates towards plain ol' fudge-y brownies w/ no additions (though, he does LOVE butterscotch anything)! I will def be making these again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead because I didn't have butterscotch chips.  It turned out great!  Definitely on the "cakey" side, but still good.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made this as the recipe directed except that my pan was 9 x 13 instead of 10 x 13 so I cooked the brownies an extra 15 minutes.  It was really quite jiggly at 35 minutes.  The brownies were good but seemed as if the butterscotch chips sank to the bottom -  because the bottoms seemed to have a more solid and quite sweet layer. The swirl effect appeared mainly at the top. My efforts to move it thru the batter were only mildly successful.

Definitely more of cake than a brownie. Tastes better than it looked.

I guess I will be making it again.  I'm not enthused about making it again because it is labor intensive, but since the husband liked it so well I will be making it again.

I had such a good feeling about this recipe... unfortunately, it seems to have been wrong. I followed it without any changes. I haven't tasted it yet, but (in order of importance to me) these are the things that haven't worked:
it didn't get swirled, all that happened was a light brown layer over the dark brown of the brownie. All the butterscotch chips melted into a hard chewy lid, under which the brownie was still raw. All of it boiled over some 20 minutes into the baking and I had to remove it from the oven, transfer some to a smaller dish and pop it back in.  The cooking time was way, way more than stated. It got stuck to the side and bottom of the dish. After all this, I'm wishing I'd just made regular brownies and saved the cream cheese for a different dessert.
