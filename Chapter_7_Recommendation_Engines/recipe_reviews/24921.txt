This is a GREAT recipe for parties.  I make it in the slow cooker on low so it stays hot, if you keep it on high the dip thins out.  Variations: use 1 can of nacho cheese soup and 1 pk of cream cheese with the chili - it's creamy with spice to give it a kick.  It is best with Fritos Scoop corn chips.
Thank you for the recipe, I use it all the time.

Yummy!!!  I made this for a party in the crockpot. Used two cans of chili with beans, 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes w/green chilis, 2 blocks of cream cheese.  I added chili seasoning for extra flavor and shredded sharp cheddar to thicken it a bit.  I kept it hot in the crockpot and kept refreshing the serving bowl with it.  The guests went through it like crazy! We served it with Frito's Scoops.  This was a big hit and SO easy to make.

I've also had this recipe for ages. I LOVE THIS STUFF. Salty, spicy.. MMM. One suggestion, chili with beans in this recipe is VERY good.

HUGE hit with my boys. I used reduced fat cream cheese, chili with beans (because that was all I had on hand), fire roasted tomatoes and a can of green chilies only because I don't keep Rotel on hand. I threw it all in my mini crockpot on low after breakfast and it was set to go by lunchtime. They INHALED it in less than an hour. Awesome for our dip weekends.

I probably would have given this 5 stars if I had used home made chili.  I just don't care much for canned chili.  The concept sounds really good though.  I love cream cheese dips.  I will give it one more try this winter when I make chili from scratch.

This was really good as is, but next time instead of the diced tomatoes I might try adding a jar of salsa..and doubling the recipe.

Had some leftover homemade chili so threw this together for football watching on Sunday.  Only additions were a little garlic powder and some shredded pepper jack cheese on top.  Really tasty!

This was a good dip but next time I will work a little harder at getting most all the liquid out of the tomatoes and chilis so it will be thicker; will squeeze in a paper towel and also think I will add a well drained and rinsed can of black beans.

this was the best dip i've ever made, it was quick and easy and there was not a drop left. I made it for a football game and everyone was asking for more! I did add some louisiana hot sauce and some diced japalenos and some shredded cheese for more thickness, but it is awesome. I will make it over and over again.

If you want to make this a five star dish add 1 cup of cheddar cheese 1 tablespoon of chipotle chili sauce 1 teaspoon of cumin and 1/4 cup of  salsa.  Then cook it in an oven until it bubbles in the middle at 350Â° .
 It will get an ugly crust but just stir it all up add some cheese on top with a little bit of chili pepper on top for garnish place back in the oven for two minutes  or until cheese is melted...let it set, then serve.

I really liked this!  Made with chili with beans, added cheese as another sugested.  Was going to throw in a dab of hot sauce, but can't remember if we did now as a friend took over helping me with this one.  It was good regardless & had lots of compliments, will be making this one again.  This is one that we decided should be in a crock pot & kept warm though so will do that next time.

This is a great recipe.  I add diced green onions too.  My only problem was it cools off so fast.  Reheats well in microwave but takes time away from guests.  Any ideas?

I made this for a family barbecue party and it was a super hit. I did add a shredded Mexican cheese blend and used it to stuff those sweet snacking peppers. It had just enough heat. For more heat add some red pepper flakes or even jalepenos instead of sweet peppers.

This was good. However, I will add cooked hamburger meat with garlic and onion the next round. Will also add more green chiles (than what the Rotels have)  just because we like our food a little spicy. Did add a splash of Siracha afterwards and it kicked it up a little. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy as ever. Think I would add flavor lite shallots to spice it up a little and less cheese next time. Maybe even twice the Chili about (no beans).

I have made  a few times , since I tried it at work. The person who makes it said to put cream cheese first then chili and cheese. I like it with the cream cheese layered on top of the chili. I use the chunky chili with or without beans, both taste good !  Also good with vegetarian chili. Some chopped tomatoes on it are good too !  Simple and good !  Great with fritos !

This  is really tasty and easy to make. My only complaint is the high sodium content of canned chili like Hormel.

Made this for the Footballs games yesterday. Husband and boys really liked it. I did add a handful of shredded cheddar cheese, not sure that made any difference, in fact I think the dip would have lasted longer in the bowl without having to be reheated if I left out the cheese.

It was ok. Next time I will add more chili. It's worth making again.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit.  I couldn't believe how well it went over when it is SO EASY to make!  Thanks for posting!  I made it again New Year's Eve and used a can of Turkey chili (no beans) and it was also good!

This recipe was okay. I ended up putting in some Chipolte Cheddar and some extra Chili to thicken it up a bit and it wasn't the hit dip of the party but still people loved it. Not sure I'll make this again.
