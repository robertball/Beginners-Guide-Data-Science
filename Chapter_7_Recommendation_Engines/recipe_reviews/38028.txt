To lighten this recipe, remove ALL butter.  Sprinkle herbs straight onto fish & heat a few tsp of olive oil in a cast iron skillet.

I've found that farm-raised catfish filets are fairly thick, so I cut them in half and cook about 5 min per side.  After heating the oil on high & adding the fish, I turn my burner down to med to finish cooking.  They still are blackened enough for me, and this helps cut down on the amount of smoke produced.

Several years ago (and many times since) I had blackened fish at what is considered Milwaukee's finest seafood restaurant, and from that first bite I was smitten. Over the years I've tried it at home with different seasonings and finally found a seasoning blend I loved. Hubby and I also perfected the method--we eliminate the smoke issue by heating the cast iron pan over fiery hot coals and blacken the fish outdoors! Bored with the same seasoning, I wanted to try my hand at mixing one up myself and happened along this recipe. I realized that between the three peppers this might be a little too hot for us, so I cut the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. leaving the amounts of the other peppers the same. It still was too hot for hubby, so next time I'll cut the white and black peppers back a bit too, to maybe 3/4 tsp. each--but this is just a matter of personal taste.  I also added some garlic powder. I like using a thinner filet for this method of preparation, and tilapia is a perfect choice.  The final result? This is blackened fish perfection, as fine as I had in that first restaurant experience. Love this seasoning!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I use it on Tilapia mostly. I ad 1 tsp of garlic powder to the mixture. I place fish on foil, sprinkle with olive oil & liberally with spice mix on each side, put on a dollop of butter, and wrap each piece in its own package. I cook on the bbq for 10 minutes each side. On rainy days, I bake in the oven at 425` for 10 minutes on each side. Turns out perfect every time. Thanks for sharing.

This was a great meal!  I would not make this fish in the kitchen, but use an outside burner on the grill.  It filled our house with smoke!  She warns a well ventilated area to cook in, and you'd better belive it!  It was very tasty though, and we will make it again.  A bit too spicy for little ones.

I altered the recipe quite a bit spice wise as it is really too much for children.  I also used the grill outside to heat the cast iron skillet and cooked the fish there as well. Just sit the skillet directly on the grill on high heat. No problem with smoke in the house and it works beautifully.

My wife and kids absolutely HATE fish. When I bought the fish, I used tilapia, I didnt even buy enough for everyone, just my wife and I. The kids sampled it and wanted some for dinner. My whole family agreed this was a keeper and should be made once a week. They did say it was a bit hot but they are weak of tongue when it comes to heat. This was excellent. Thanks!

Decent flavour to the spices, but "well ventilated" is understated.  I smoked out my entire house.  The neighbours actually barged through my front door shouting inquiries about calling the fire department, allowing the dog to escape and run away down the block.  I wish I was exaggerating.  This is a outdoor kitchen recipe if ever there was one.

I was hoping to find a recipe that would compare with my favorite blackened seasoning from Salty's Restaurant in Seattle. Their's has a good amount of sugar in it. So, I made this recipe exactly as it is BUT added 1/4 cup of sugar. It was JUST what I was looking for. It was really close to their recipe and the whole family loved it! I followed Salty's cooking instructions and blackened in a pan and then baked it to finish it. OH, and I used Copper River Salmon. EXCELLENT! Just enough sweetness to compliment the salmon.

This was great.  I do not like fish but my husband and I went on a fishing trip and had to cook our trout.  I combined this recipe with another and grilled it in an aluminum foil pack with slices of poblano peppers, butter, and lemon juice.  It was really excellent!

I really loved this recipe!  I followed the ingredients and amounts exactly as noted.  My only change was sprinkling the fish with olive oil instead of butter and I baked in the oven at 425. I wrapped each piece of fish is a foil pouch and baked for 10 minutes on each side.  will def make this again and share with friends.

Restaurant quality- we all enjoyed.  Made fish tacos with the leftovers.  Thanks for the reviewers who suggested cooking outside.  Great tip as it even smoked up the side of the house, and you can't get more ventilation than being outside.

Great blk seasoning mix!  We were the lucky recipients of some Halibut our friends brought back from a fishing expedition in Alaska.  We used this mix and were rubbing our tummies!

Amazing and so easy to prepare. My house aired out very quickly. I'm not a fan of super spicy food, and my husband loves hot stuff. We both loved this, so that should tell you something.

I served it with a raw spinch salad topped with freshly sliced kiwi and a rasberry vinegarette. That worked well to clense our palets after the spicyness of the fish.

Even my 6 year old who can be picky about spicey foods and seafood cleaned his plate.

My husband and I hate fish but since we live in Alaska I am always trying to fix it so that we will like it. My husband loved this recipe!! I thought it was ok but i think i overcooked it. But for fish haters to like it is amazing!! Thanks for the recipe! 
P.S. People aren't kidding when they say your whole house will be smokey!! I don't care if your kitchen is well ventilated!!

pretty darned good. i thought  there was too much butter also. next time will greatly reduce it. i did it outdoors on the grill with my cast iron griddle, instead of in my kitchen. i also used tilapia, since that is what most people here in this house like. thanks, it's a good one.

I used catfish... also did a chunk of salmon... the catfish was good but the salmon was excellent!!!
I did NOT fry it and I did NOT use butter... I blackened it in a really hot skillet with a little olive oil (took like 30 seconds each side) then put it on a cookie sheet and baked to finish! Yum!

The seasonings in this are great on fish. Spicy, but not too hot (and I don't care for hot food).

Made this fish recipe for my family and my brothers family and everyone loved it even the little ones.  My brother and sister in law had me print them a copy to send home.  The only thing you really have to watch is not to put too much seasoning on the fish it will make it too spicey and you could lose the fish taste.  I used Tilapia fish.  HIGHLY Recommend.

great recipe, made it yesterday and it was a hit with everyone.  i fell in love with blackened fish when i first had it at cracker barrel and it tastes just like it!  i served it up with some wilted spinach, which in retrospect would have tasted better on a bed of rice.  i also added garlic powder and used seasoned salt, it was very flavourful.  i did not use a cast iron pan but just panfried it on a skillet with a little bit of vegetable oil.  i am sure with a cast iron it would have tasted even better!  thanks for the recipe!  this one is a keeper!

Loved the taste and texture of this recipe.  Wish I would have read other reviews first though, when I make again will do it outside.  Dinner guests had to leave the house because of all the smoke, glad to say my fire alarms work!

Wow, fantastic little seasoning mix for some great bluegill fish that we caught and filleted.  I did cut it in 1/2 and used a bit less of the cayenne and other peppers.  Also used a bit let thyme since it's not my favorite seasoning.  All in all, I will definitely be using this again for our caught fishies :)

This is AMAZING!  We cooked this fish outside on the burner on our grill.  Don't try to cook this inside!  The flavor is incredible and I didn't alter it at all.  I have an extremely sensitive tongue and I always tone down the spice in recipes, but this one is perfect!  Try it as is before you change anything!

Made this for friends  and it was to die for. Its nice to have fish other than fried and sometime baking and grilling just isn't flavorful enough (plus too moist). FYI: I would not recommend doing this in your house. When we make this it looks like the our patio is on fire from all the smoke. We use the base of a turkey fryer to heat and a cast iron pan. Don't inhale while cooking either, the spices will get to you. Very worth it though.

This was excellent!  I didn't use quite as much butter as the recipe called for and it came out fine.  I melted 2-3TBSP of butter and brushed it onto the filets before giving them a sprinkle of the seasoning mixture.  To cook the fish I used enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan and that worked well for us.  I will definitely make this again.  The whole family LOVED it!  I served it with a mango, avacado and papaya salsa and it balanced out the heat of the fish nicely.

This was delicious!  Good flavor, not too spicy.  Scaled it down for 2 people and used some rockfish that we got in out csf. Brushed on some butter, and poured the rest over the top - it was probably about 1-2 tbsp.  Super easy and quick.  Thanks!

I prefer my blackened fish more spicy.  Ended up sprinkling more cayenne pepper on as we were eating it, which helped.

Sweet baby Jesus: That was hot! I love hot, but that was over the top.  I think the combo of white pepper and cayenne was a bit much!  With that said, it was reasonably tasty. It was better on the shrimp than the fish.

I use this EVERY TIME I make Tilapia!! Love this, love this LOVE THIS!!! Even without the iron skillet (I don't have one) these flavors are exactly what you expect when having blackened fish! They matched the flavor so well, I will forever make extra amounts of the seasoning so we can have them 2 nights in a row. Once with brown rice and spicy slaw and the next night as Fish Tacos on whole wheat tortillas topped with the same spicy slaw and creamy cilantro/avocado/chipotle dressing. OH MY GOODNESS no matter what you do this is the perfect blackened seasoning! Thank you, SUSANHOR!!!

Made a healthier version by rubbing spice mix on trout and then baking in oven (no oil or butter!) so good! Awesome Cajun spice mix. I made as is except eliminated white pepper (didn't have it).

Just left the table from eating this great meal!!  Made this with 2 changes only.  Only added 1/4 tsp of red pepper and cooked it in cast iron skillet out on gas bbq pit.  Had this with white rice mixed with sauted red, green, and yellow peppers with drained heated through black beans.  yum yum

My husband and i loved this! i took the advise of one of the reviewers before me and did not put any buter in it. i used a little olive oil and it worked really well! i did have to open all the windows and doors while cooking though (due to all the smoke). i will definitely make this again. thanks!

We made fish tacos with this fantastic spicy fish,  shredded cabbage, & Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce on corn tortillas. I used half the cayenne pepper and used garlic powder in place of the white pepper to test out this recipe, and it was still really spicy, so I'll stick with those adjustments next time. I'll cut the salt just a little as well since there is so much pepper dazzling your taste buds, less salt is necessary. I used halibut, and this recipe probably works well on many kinds of fish.  I baked the fish in a little olive oil this time as I didn't want to smoke up the house, but I look forward to cooking it in olive oil in the pan.

I tried this with tilapia and ghee (clarified butter) instead of butter (since I am allergic to casein) and it turned out great!  My husband who is not a fish lover almost cleaned his plate.  Very spicy and flavorful, I will definitely make this again.

This is the best recipe I've ever used for making fish without breading!  My kitchen isn't tiny and I have a good vent so the smoke wasn't an issue. If you are the type that loves really spicy food you can double or even triple the red pepper like I did.  Also, I found the thyme overpowered the other spices a bit so next time I will cut that in half.

Just made this and me and my husband loved it.  It was not hard.  We did it on the grill with a cast iron skillet because its so much easier too have all the smoke outside.  It was really awesome!!!  We will make it again and again.

We really liked this recipe. It was pretty spicy so next time I'll cut the cayenne pepper in 1/2. I also could not cook the fish in 3/4 cup of butter. If you have a good quality fry pan a little olive oil or butter will do the trick. Make sure the pan & oil is hot before you add the fish. The only draw back was the house smelled like fish for over a week because with the blackening you get a fair bit of smoke. I will definatly be trying it on the BBQ. good overall recipe.

Pretty tasty! If using a skillet on the grill, make sure you leave PLENTY of time for it to heat up. Like 1/2 hour at least. For the record, we didn't, and the recipe turned out OK. Not blackened per se, but still yielding great flavor.

You can definitely cut down on the amount of butter. We used olive oil and it tasted great.

Thanks for a yummy recipe!

I've made this with trout, salmon, and whitefish.  It's a great mix of spices.  The only thing I change is to reduce the butter to 1 tbsp. and add some fresh garlic.

yes! this is good. i have never made anything blackened but this recipe will be making the rounds at my house. I used talapia and i put in some cinnamon...im not so sure about the cinnamon but my guests said they love it. I might not use so much butter but it did give it a great flavor and make it crispy. MAKE THIS RECIPE. ITS GOOD.

I used tilapia.  Very good recipe, but not the best I've had. This was too salty,too hot, and there wasn't quite the "wow" flavor for us. Will keep searching/trying for a better mix. I used a STAINLESS STEEL  pan not a cast iron; worked fine (be aware it will darken your pan permanently). My house filled with smoke and I DID use my exhaust fan;so I will only make this only when it is okay weather to open windows/doors or put a fan by a window OR cook outside.

WOO-HOOOO this has a great kick!  I dipped the fish in the butter & then rolled it into the spice mixture, which depending on your "buds" I may or maynot recommend.  I loved it, it was nice & spicy.  Thanks Susan, I now have a great recipe to use up my Dads fresh catch with!

Good flavor, but two caveats; Number one, putting a true cast iron skillet on high heat means really, really, REALLY hot. I mean seriously hot. Consider dialing it back from hi. Number two, consider using something other than butter. We substituted coconut oil which has a low smoking point.. filled every last room of the house with thick smoke. If substituting, try using grapeseed or peanut oil instead.

Not bad, but I didn't want to smoke myself out of my house, and I didn't want to cook it outside since it's cold, so I did as another reviewer did and cooked in oil for a few minutes on high heat on each side, then finished by baking in the oven.  I overbaked the fish a bit; it was sort of rubbery, so I'd bake it less next time.  However, that was my fault and the seasoning was tasty.  I did, however, leave out the cayenne and cut the pepper; I'm not a fan of food that is so spicy that all you can taste is the heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, but cook it outside on your grill burner.  It initially will give off large amounts of white smoke which will set off all your alarms.

This is a fantastic blackened fish recipe! DH raved about it several times throughout the meal. I did use my large cast iron skillet on the outdoor gas grill, and I'm glad I did. The spices burned my eyes while putting thr fillets in the pan and while turning, even outside. I used Barramundi fillets as they were the closest my store had to trout the day I cooked. Wonderful!
(For you folks with kiddos that can't take the heat - sprinkle salt and dill in place of the seasoning mix then cook first. My picky 7 year old ate half a large fillet)

Very good. I should have cooked it only 90 seconds on each side though. A little too black for me and maybe a touch too spicy. I used Tilapia instead of trout.

First time in my life to cook Red Snapper, let alone blacken it. My guys LOVED it! Even asked for me to make it again tonight. Son going off to college in a few days asked me to send a bottle of the spice mix so he can make it there!

My wife thought this was my best dish ever. We've been talking about it for days.  Substituted crushed red pepper because we didn't have cayenne pepper. I've never done much with fish before, but this was really good!

Very nice, kids liked it too. I didn't use the full amount of white pepper, and I think that was a good move. It wasn't too, spicy. I put mine on a bun with mayo. Thought it was outstanding.

Loved it and yes it smoked up the kitchen a bit but totally worth it! I cut all three peppers in half so the kids would eat it and my 4yo daughter said it was a little spicy but she still ate it ALL.

This was the best fish I have ever made.  I've never been good at fish.  I would not make this in the house again, it filled the house with smoke.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the white pepper, and I used white fish and served with fresh lemon slices.  My husband has asked me to serve this weekly.

very good alternate method from the usual grilled or batter fried fish that I most often cook. My picky family liked it, so I'll be cooking this especially when I'm needing to use the easiest method.

YUM says the whole family (Kids included)! I used trout and I didn't use white and cayenne pepper because of the kiddies and it still turned out great. I also didn't use as much butter. Next time, I am going to try olive oil instead of butter. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks SusanHor!!!!

I used catfish and loved it! I was a bit worried about the spice once I began cooking it. It caused me to cough when I first began cooking it, but once blackened, it tasted great! I paired this with sauteed kale and it made for a great balance. I would definitely use this recipe again! I did use less butter. Only a 1/2 cup and I still didn't end up using all of that. I made two large 8oz fillets, so a bit less than the recipe called for.

Excellent flavor!  I only used 3/4 tsp of salt and I used cod instead of trout, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the fish.  I will definitely be making this again.

this was fabulous.  I doubled it for a larger amount of trout.  However I only used 1/2 cup butter.  I also did not need to double the salt.  This is my new go to fish recipe. Thanks!

This blackened fish was amazing!  I didn't have white pepper or thyme, but it still tasted great.  My husband loved it so much and said that it didn't even have a fishy taste.  I think it would be great with tarter sauce if you don't want the spicy taste.

Wonderful fish recipe! Make sure your pan is screaming hot before putting the fish in so it doesn't stick. I mix up large batches of the seasoning to have on hand at all times. I serve the fish on top of greens with a bit of lime juice and olive oil. Super healthy and tasty!

This recipe was so delicious! I decided I didn't need all the butter that was in the recipe and used only about a tablespoon in the pan. I also used halibut fillets. I put a little butter in the pan, put the fish in the pan, and turned it so that it was coated in the butter that was in the pan. I then sprinkled it with the blackened seasoning and it was truly amazing! The blackened seasoning is perfect the way it is, I wouldn't change a thing! Also, I did not use a cast iron skillet in this recipe, and did not have an issue whats so ever with smoke.

Loved it!  Just brushed fish with olive oil instead of all the butter to lighten it up a bit. We like it with a thicker fish like marlin or tuna steaks.

So Good!! I used tilapia for this and to make it a bit healthier, I brushed the fillets with canola oil. I cut back a bit on the cayenne and the cumin, but the spice combination was perfection. Thank you Susan!

The spice mixture is great.  I blended olive oil with butter (I didn't have that much butter on hand) and that worked fine.  The recipe calls for about twice the butter needed to make this dish, so scale that back if you don't want the waste.  I used catfish and it was very good.  I followed the advice and made this on the burner on my gas grill.  A very good fish recipe, I will make this one again.

This was a huge mess! My whole house filled with smoke and I still haven't been able to get the fish smell out.  It was way too spicy, we couldn't even eat it.

This was very tasty! Instead of using a cast iron skillet I put the fillets in foil pouches and put them on the grill. They turned out very flavorful with a great kick! I also used olive oil instead of butter to make it a little healthier. Definitely would make this again!

This was a great recipe.  I happen to have cast iron pans and griddles, so it tunred out perfect.  The spices can adjusted if needed, but I liked it how it was.  I used REAL butter and a scoop of bacon grease for an added flavor.  It was super great!  Made a roux sauce to go over it.  Your house will get a little smokey, pre warning, but turn the fans on, it is worth it.  Redfish - a saltwater fish we caught. Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent! However, the amount of butter called for was waaaaay too much. I used less than half of what was called for and it was more than enough. Very yummy spicing for this fish. I used trout and next time plan to try it on some catfish.

I made this last night for dinner for my fiancee and myself. It was great. Wonderful flavor, easy recipe. I used perch instead of snapper, and it turned out great. Will use again. I made it on the burner outside on the grill instead of in the kitchen.

Delicious!  Followed recipe exactly except we used fresh yellowtail and it was awesome.  To keep the kitchen from getting smoky, we just heat the cast iron skillet on top of our gas grill (outside)---it works really well.  Thanks for the recipe, Susan!

My husband really enjoyed this recipe!  (I'm not much of a fish person, but I had a taste and it wasn't bad.)  We used rainbow trout we caught earlier in the day and made the recipe as stated, except that we cooked it on a Foreman type of grill.  It just needed to cook a little longer than stated in the recipe.

Excellent! Spicy and super easy to make. I didn't end up using as much butter as stated in the recipe. It did smoke up my kitchen/dining room, but it was worth it! I used fresh rainbow trout and an aluminum pan. My other half doesn't like fish but loved this meal.

Wow, great recipe for Blackened Maui Maui. I love that the recipe included the seasoning rub & it was so easy to prepare. I did not need all the butter indicated—I used approximately half the amount.  For my adult life,  I’ve been cooking/browning fish in a Cast Iron Fry Pan—it’s a must to properly brown. I Learned from my Mother & Grandmother to only use cast iron pans for frying, browning, etc.... even oven cooked cornbread, pies, etc.

The seasoning mixture is just delicious.  So much depth of flavor without obscuring the flavor of the fish.  And considering the amount of cayenne and cumin, it's not as hot as one might expect, so it would be easy to ramp up the heat by adding a little more of either (or both).  This is a keeper.

I loved the recipe and just modified because I didn’t have some of the seasonings. I didn’t have dry mustard and I substituted it with stone grain mustard and I also added onion and garlic pepper and did without the white peppper and added some Caribbean jerk seasoning. My husband loved it.

I have been using this recipe for several years. It makes for excellent blackened fish. While trout does just fine, try it with red fish or, better yet, with fresh gulf trigger fish. The recipe has never let me down. And trigger is wonderful if you can find it. 

With regard to butter I melt maybe a half stick and drissle it over one side of a couple of fillets. I then sprinkle the seasoning over the buttered side of the fish. I don’t worry about seasoning the second side until the fish is in my very, very hot cast iron skillet. Once the fish is being seared on the seasoned side, I lightly season the up side. I do not add additional butter to the pan. Cast iron is a fairly non-stick surface and I typically have no need for additional butter.

Made the trout exactly how the recipe called for.  It was fantastic!!  Can't wait to make it again.  We like to make our fish outside in a cast iron pan on the grill,  so there was no need to worry about the smokiness.

Way too much butter for me but I followed the recipe and had to throw out about 1/2 cup. Tasty but I've had better.

Very tasty. I used yellow-tail snapper. Just rub the spice mix on both sides of the fillet, place on a piece of aluminum foil, add one tablespoon of butter to the top, close the foil around the fish with a fold down the middle and scrunched ends, then grill over medium heat until flaky. Mine took about 8 minutes. super juicy!

Nice clean way to add flavor to fish.  Though I don't recommend drizzling melted butter or anything over fish after seasoning as is described.  It washes away the seasoning.   Pan used to melt butter is same used to blacken.  All the cooking medium needed.
Also, run the fan (I use a proper HEPA air cleaner and not a recirculating vent fan which does nothing) to avoid the pepper smoke.

I prefer the store bought blackened seasoning, even though I cut back on the pepper and cayenne it was still to spicy.

Very simple. I've done it with olive oil and with butter. Only change would be to cut back on the salt.

It was great! I mixed up the seasoning minus the white and black pepper, I felt the cayenne made enough heat. I just melted half a stick of butter in my cast iron pan, sprinkled the seasoning directly on the catfish and threw it in the pan. Cooked it until it was blackened and crispy. My family loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy, and great flavor on catfish fillets.  I did 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper since my youngest is not fond of apicy things so it gave it a little kick perfect enough for us and her along with white rice and sauteed spinach.

Used this on red snapper for tacos. Seasoning had a good spice to it from the cayenne but just enough to keep me wanting more. Definitely be making this again to have onhand for the next fish.

This was very good and not too spicy. I used snapper, it was flaky and moist on the inside. I never used butter to make blackened fish before but will make again. Served over a huge salad for a light, Spring dinner.

Only change I made was reducing the Cayenne pepper to a "heaping" 1/2 teaspoon for a little less total intensity.  Used flounder fillets, though catfish, tilapia etc would work as well. The butter is necessary to get that blackened crust. Sorry it isn't that calorie friendly, Also agree, side burner on a gas grill unless you have an industrial quality ducted hood over your stove...

Call the fire department!  Hard to make this in the kitchen even with the fan on high and the windows and doors open. Guess it needs to be cooked outside on a grill as others suggested.  Otherwise pretty spicy and tasty, but hard to blacken without burning...next time will either cook outside or make cast iron less hot...

this came out very tasty.. i was making lunch for myself so i reduced the servings to 0.75 (my own math) and it was perfect for my small swai fillet.. i used all black pepper since i never carry white.. i also took ROUVER's advice about using a bit of olive oil and omitting the butter.. i'm sure the buttery version is delicious, but i was looking for something lighter/healthier.. i can't wait to make this for bf.. ty for the recipe

This spice mixture was just OK for the blackened fish recipe when I made it a few months ago but unbelievably good on ribs. Yesterday my husband was getting ready to throw some ribs on the grill and asked me what seasoning he should use. I threw the leftover bag of spices to him and said "use this".  Wow, Those were some of the best ribs we ever had. I'll be keeping this recipe as a rub for ribs.

Fantastic!  The amount of butter was a turn off for me, so instead, we just seared with olive oil and then completed with a pat of butter on top right before removing from the pan.  I also added garlic powder to the seasoning.  Quick and easy weeknight dinner!

Good god! Way too spicy as submitted and written, which is how I prepared it, exactly, the first time. Much better without all the cayenne, which does nothing for taste and only adds tearing eyes, coughing, and hiccups -- nothing more. I like spicy, but I also like to taste what I'm eating.

Great recipe! I used tilapia instead of trout, and it came out really well. My only recommendation is to halve the amount of cayenne; it tends to be a stronger flavor than the others.

Excellent recipe! I used a iron skillet on the BBQ. After allowing skillet to get hot, quick spray with PAM then added butter and prepared trout. Winter conditions outside so 3 minutes per side.  I will be serving this recipe up at the cottage, it was THAT good!

I thought that this would be really spicy,  I found that I had to add more seasoning.

This was not good.  I don't know about anyone else, but you try heating up a cast iron pan on high for ten minutes, you're going to have a house filled with smoke. The spice blend was okay, a little spicier than I prefer but overall, I didn't think that a pan was the best way to cook this.  I would try maybe broiling or grilling.

This is the first fresh trout recipe my husband has ever liked!  Aside from using only 1/2 cup total butter, the remainder of the recipe was the same.  Used a cast iron skillet and cooked outside.

Made this with some fresh caught trout a few days ago. Absolutely delicious. To spicy for my 4 year old but thats no surprise.   Unless your stove top is extremely well ventilated, I highly recommend doing this outdoors on your grill if it has a side burner. As soon as I dropped it on the hot pan I had a chimney of pepper spray like smoke that filled the house. The few minutes of coughing were worth it though!! :)

This was great.  I had to squeeze lemon on the fish to cool down the spicy seasoning. Easy recipe and great taste!

I'm trying to add fish to our diet (not easy when no one likes it) and this was great. Everyone ate it - hubby and 2 year old! Only issue was the house filling with smoke and the alarm going off lol. Will try on the grill next time. There will be a next time.

Some of the reviews said this was too spicy so the first time I made it I cut back on the cayenne and white pepper, but I wish I hadn't. It was very good, but I would have enjoyed a little more kick than my modified version had. Next time I will make as described in the recipe.

I like Blackened Catfish and this recipe did the job.  I turned the outdoor BBQ up to its highest level and went at it by following the recipe.  Turned out great, slightly charred on the outside and tender on the inside.

Wow!  Was this ever good.  I couldn't resist adding a tsp of garlic powder.  I used Lake trout fillets and they came out great.  3-4 minutes per side in hot cast iron without oil.  You'll love it if you like it hot.  I'll try this on chicken next

This really an incredibly fabulous blackened fish spice mix!  I use it now to make all sorts of things!  The amount of pepper is too much for my taste, I cut the amount in half and increased the amount of paprika, but I only recommend that you change the recipe if it's too spicy for you, because it's a great blend.  Thanks!

GREAT for Tilapia! I have this once or twice a week and made extra spice mixture for future use. I did this on a regular pan since I don't have a grill just don't heat the pan too long or it will cause a lot of smoke. I rubbed the spices on to the fish and squeeze some lime juice before cooking and while its being cooked.

Thanks for this recipe! And for the heads up on the smoke! I had a nice piece of Fluke in the freezer and seen this. I used hot paprika and mixed in a little EVOO with the butter. I heated my Lodge 8" round smooth griddle on the gas stove top in the kitchen for about 10 minutes and then took the pan outside to a small camping stove cranked right up to as high as it would go and then grilled for a couple minutes on each side. There was a LOT of smoke. Awesome!

This was wonderful on the trout my husband caught!! We didn't change anything except decreased the amount of cayenne pepper & cooked it outside (and I'm glad we did!).  We will be using this recipe to cook many other types of fish too. Thanks!

We loved this! Made w/trout. Cut down cayanne to 1/2tsp and it was still spicy! Also cut down salt and butter. Cooked on the grill, will be making this all summer long, thanks!

Awesome recipe!!! Just the right blend of spices.  I was going to make this outside but the night we were having it it was about -20 below with LOTS of wind (Minnesota winters!)so decided to use our George Foreman grill, it blackened really nicely and there really wasn't that much smoke, the range hood took care of the little that there was.

this was very good. I was only using two small trout that had been in the freezer a while and thought that if I made something with a lot of flavor for it it would be good. It was great though my husband doesn't like things very spicy and he liked it but kept saying it was very spicy, I thought it was perfect.
Thanks for a great easy way to prepare fresh or frozen trout.

I cooked in my cast iron pan on the grill outside using olive oil instead of butter.  I used salmon and flounder for the fish.  So glad I came across this recipe.

We were given a fresh caught brown trout, so I decided to try this recipe. I prepared it exactly as written and my husband declared it one of the best fish dinners I've made. We like spicy, hot food and this turned out just right. (Heeding the warnings of a smokey kitchen, I opened all windows, had the stove vent fan on high and set up two window fans to exhaust out - and I'm glad I did.)

Very easy to prepare.  I didn't experience smoke problems at all.  Excellent flavor and texture.  The seasoning made the "fishiness" go away. (Used fresh trout...YUM!!)
