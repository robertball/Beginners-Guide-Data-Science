Great cookies- make sure you change the BAKING SODA FROM 1 CUP TO 1 TEASPOON.  I recognized the typo as it is easy to do.  I didn't have enough for the cookie jar as they kept disappearing from the counter while they were still warm.

I have looking for quite some time for a really good oatmeal cookie recipe and I believe I have found it!  They smelled great while baking and were tasted delicious!  I will definately make these again.  PS - thanks for changing the baking soda amount.

The best oatmeal cookies around! Within four days my husband and I had finished all of them! I had added about one cup of raisins to the mixture at the end because my husband and I both love oatmeal raisin cookies! They turned out great!

Is the amt. of flour correct in this recipe??  I had it halved by the system and the cookies just melted all over the cookie sheet. Even dripped off the edges, it was so runny.  I now have them in a baking dish to finish cooking into a bar.  Or something.  ?? Help!!

Excellent cookies, they spread out a bit because we used real butter -- to compensate we used about an extra 1/2 cup flour.  Also added some raisins, and butterscotch chips.

So incredibly good!  The orange taste gives them a unique twist.

Give them a try yourself, more than likely you won't be disappointed.

Very sweet & will use less white sugar next time.  Hard to get off the cookie sheet even though I let them sit as directed.

This dough never got firm, I even put in freezer.  I sliced it anyway and it spread out very thin.  I think it needs more flour or butter instead of shortening.  I'm not sure with shortening it will ever get firm.  Anyway, it has a good taste but it's all in pieces.  I still have half of the dough in the freezer and will decide what to do with it.  Maybe put in small cupcake pan and try to bake that way.
