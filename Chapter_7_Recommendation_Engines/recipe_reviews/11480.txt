Really good and liked the oatmeal "cookie" bottom.  A new twist on the traditional brownie.  Perhaps I was doing something wrong with frosting, however.  Was not able to "drizzle" it as the recipe suggests.  In fact, it was so dry and crumbly I had to add milk, then just spread it on with a spatula.  Still quite good and will make again.

There is one thing missing from the icing recipe and that is to add enough hot water (I boil some) to make a spreading consistency. My family love them and I take them everywhere I am asked to bring a dessert.

Okay, I only made the bottom layer and put regular brownie mix on top, but the bottom layer itself was too bland for my taste. The butter flavor overpowered the oatmeal, and it tasted like, well, buttery oatmeal, instead of that nice caramel-y oatmeal cookie flavor I look for. I would add some cinnamon, or carmelize the brown sugar with the butter before mixing with the dry ingredients.

Great variation on the basic brownie. However I agree with the last reviewer that the glaze is not a true glaze as it's hard and crumbly. I added 1 tablespoon of milk at a time until I got a runnier consistency.

These were pretty good.  Again, the frosting is not frosting at all, but they are still good without it.  I'd add some chocolate chips or something though, I need more in my chocolate fix :)

What happened to the icing? It turned out a crumbly mess. I ended up adding more melted butter and part of a hershey's bar to thin it out. Even then, it was more of a chocolate spread. This was ok though, it satisfied my need for chocolate.

These are so rich and yummy. The oatmeal cookie part really evens out the rich chocolate.

It's not  a "brownie" at all, but more of a good coffee square. It's a bit hard, dry and lacking in chocolisciousness to be a true brownie.

My mom used to makes these when we were kids and they were a family favorite.  Now I make them for my family.  The directions for the frosting don't include adding enough hot water or fresh brewed coffee just until the icing becomes spreadable.  It's a fabulous frosting and really sets these brownies apart.  Delicious!

I made these for the first time using half of the recipe as I didn't make the oatmeal cookie crust,instead I used leftover oatmeal chocolate chip cookie dough I had frozen from a previous holiday.I took them to a family gathering and they were a big hit! I made them a second time using the original oatmeal cookie layer and they were just as yummy and even a bigger hit! The only thing I changed with the brownie ingredients was I added 2 more eggs and only 1/2 cup of gluten free flour( I have a wheat allergy),melted the butter and replaced the chopped chocolate with 100% cocoa  powder,and eliminated the baking soda. It makes for a dense, gooey,fudgy delicious brownies like I love. I didn't use frosting due to the richness from the brownie layer, but I am sure it would be delicious! Try this recipe at your next gathering,you won't be disappointed!

I agree the frosting needed to be thinned so I added half and half until it was thin enough to drizzle.  I always bake my bars at 325 degrees to prevent drying out.  I doubled the recipe for a jelly roll pan.  I cater so I decided to try them for a job I am doing tonight.  Hopefully they will be happy with them, I am!
Also a side not I didn't see the salt in the recipe but you added it in the directions so I added about 1/4 tsp.  I think that was a good idea.
I will add this to my recipes!

I have made this recipe for Christmas every year since 1972. The secret is to not over-bake the oatmeal crust and to NEVER substitute a brownie mix. The cloying sweetness and chemical taste of brownies from a box will overwhelm the taste of the oatmeal cookie base and the chocolate frosting. 

For a 9x13" pan, I TRIPLE the recipe for the cookie base and use my own brownie recipe (which contains little flour and remains moist and chewy). I also triple the recipe for the frosting and spread the frosting on while the brownies are still warm from the oven.

Last hints: 
1) Use Dutch-process cocoa because natural cocoa does not react well to baking powder.
2) Use real butter, no substitutes (except perhaps coconut BUTTER -- not coconut oil), which I plan to try this year).
3) Line the 9x13" pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil, leaving overhang on both long sides. Use cooking spray on the pan and butter on the foil.
4) After frosting, immediately cover the pan with foil and freeze for 3 to 4 hours. 
5) Lift brownies from the pan using the foil overhangs. Cut, while slightly frozen, into 1-inch squares. Keep the knife clean to prevent sloppy cuts.

Made my way, this is a LEGACY recipe!
