To make this more like my Abuela's arroz con pollo I used a little less broth (we use about 1 1/2 cups total liquid per cup of rice) and a small packet of Goya seasoning con azafran instead of the paprika and pepper. It was great!

This is a great foundation recipe - it can be taylored to fit many tastes. I found it took longer to brown the chicken but the rest of the recipe is pretty accurate. I did my own version: Substituted olive oil with canola oil; Supplemented the paprika with cumin; Used the chicken skin to flavor the rice and peppers then discarded the skin; Supplemented the bell pepper with 3 more serano peppers; Supbtituted whole tomates & liquid with diced tomatoes & liquid; Also I believe using my Le Cruset for this dish made it better than a regular pot. I think it will make good leftovers too.

This was a really tasty dish--my lover loved it. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and canned diced tomatoes with green chilis. This one is a keeper because we love Mexican dishes and this tastes quite authentic.

Wow; Incredible great recipe that I will make again and again. My changes..1 tsp cumin instead of paprika and rotel diced tomatoes with a small can of tomotoe sauce. Rice takes forever to cook in the dry air of Las Vegas so I thought the extra liquid would help and it did!

I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs for this but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Really easy to prepare great weeknight dinner because of minimal prep. The taste was very yummy! I may try this in the crockpot next time. My family raved at how great this tasted!

I had a taste for the 'real' Spanish Rice and am I glad I searched this site. This recipe turned out so nice. I wanted to eat it all myself.

This is an AMAZING dish. I was skeptical about this dish due to the dej√†-vu-ness of the ingredients but at the end the rice and chicken came out SO flavorful. I think the secret lies in the olive oil.

I did not have green pepper so i used hot chili peppers for a nice kick as well as chopped celery. Needed salt and red wine to balance the chicken broth (which i made). Added some frozen peas and carrots that were handy and provided variety and color; handful of grated romano cheese too. It is a versatile basic recipe.

I would give the rice 5 stars and the chicken 3 stars so average to 4 stars for the whole recipe. I made this twice in the same week because I loved the way the rice turned out--so flavorful! Best Spanish rice I've ever made. The first time we had to add salt to the rice at the table because it wasn't nearly salty enough for our taste. The second time I tasted the liquid and rice mixture before I added the chicken back in and added enough salt to taste. I think the next time I make this I will season the chicken under the skin then brown it to flavor the rice then finish baking the chicken itself in the oven so the skin stays crispy. The chicken is just very bland cooking it in the rice without any seasonings.

MMMM MM! My mother always made a beef spanish rice that is my ultimate comfort food. But being on a diet I needed something I could easily control yet not lose taste. This is it! For dieters here's how to fix it up... use low cal margarine for olive oil use the low fat broth and cube up some boneless/skinless chicken breast. Other than that this is so great. Healthy and somehow tastes like my mom's. From one Sarah to another... Thank you so much!

This was absolutely wonderful. I didn't have the can of tomatoes on hand so I used fresh tomatoes and a little more chicken broth than what was called for and it turned out great. I will definitely make this recipe again.

The dish WAS a dish in my house! The recipe definitely needed help. I would suggest sauteeing this final dish in a covered dutch oven or covering your skillet with foil. My rice didn't want to cook in the time alloted.Everybody LOVED it and there was minimal clean-up.

I needed a new Spanish Rice recipe. This was very good. I substituted chicken breasts instead of whole chicken and used both yellow and red onion. It was delicious. Usually I have leftover spanish rice but not this time!

I thought this was a pretty good "one pot dinner" but not the best spanish rice I've had. I like more more tomatoey. I added chili powder and chopped jalepenos because I like my food spicy.

I thought this Spanish rice recipe was a little different so I tried it. I used 1 tsp. hot paprika and one sweet. I also added a dash of tumeric for color and chicken breast cut up. At the end I stirred in some Spanish olives. My family loved it and had thirds.

Really good even with the subs I had to make. Realized at the end that I was out of bay leaves so I added 1tsp Cajun spice instead. Excellent flavour! Will try it the correct way next time.

It's okay. There's not enough flavoring to this dish for me to have an opinion either way. I followed the recipe exactly. Mine doesn't look as savory and inviting as shown in the picture but the picture has peas that the recipe doesn't have in it. Perhaps with other ingredients it may taste better.

We doubled this (needs to feed 7 people here) and used brown rice and chicken breasts I also added corn and chipotle chili powder to the mix. It was really great and the family killed it. Wouldn't say it's authentic but it's really tasty and easy.

No bay leaf so I added some cumin instead. Used brown rice and cooked it for an additional 10 minutes. I thought it was a little bland (but I like spicy) so I added some hot sauce to my bowl but some chopped jalapenos in the mixture would work.

Good basic chicken and rice dish. Before preparing I read all reviews. I did not have green pepper so I used a serrano and an orange bell pepper. For tomatoes I used diced with jalapeno. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic after sauteing the onion and peppers. I changed the amount of paprika to 1 tsp. added 1/4 tsp of turmeric and dissolved a generous pinch of saffron threads in the chicken broth. I had a small serving of homemade chorizo in the refrigerator so I threw that in when adding the liquid and tomatoes. I brought the liquid to a simmer on the stovetop then finished the dish covered in the oven at 375 for 25 minutes. Before serving I added 1 c. of frozen peas and let the heat from the finished dish warm them. This was a delicious "poor man's" paella which I will be serving over and over again. Four stars because I changed it so much.

It was good but needed more salt. I added corn to the dish which added a nice flavor to it. This may sound strange but I enjoyed eating the rice and corn more than I did the chicken. Next time I think I will add green peas with the corn more rice and skip the chicken
