My Mom used to put sugar, butter and bread in the tomatoes. The bread absorbed the tomato juice and the butter and sugar made a lovely gloss on the bread.  You let it sit to firm up a bit and then serve. She called this stewed tomatoes. Delicious.

This is not really stewed tomatoes.  Stewed tomatoes are made with sugar, peppers, and onions.  This is just "canned tomatoes" at home.

The tomatoes need only 30 seconds in the hot water and peeling them is much easier if you cut a little X on the bottom before putting them in the hot water so that you can peel them whole if you want. A little sugar should definately be added.

I did not like the tomatoes prepared per this recipe. Learning from another recipe online, I added 2 Tblsp butter, 1 medium onion thinly sliced, 3/4 cup chopped celery, scant 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper, 2 tsp sugar, 1 bay leaf. Salt level was fine.  I simmered in the crockpot on low for 8 hours. The butter smoothed out the acidic tomatoes.  Original recipe gets 2 stars, and with changes above it gets 5 stars.  (Prior to preparing the original recipe, I had quick peeled the tomatoes and deseeded them).

It came out perfectly with a few changes that other reviewers recommended. I added 1tsp of dried basil and then 1 TBSP of sugar.

You just can't beat fresh toms! Prepared this way they are tasty and way easy. I am however anti sugar in them. Add some crumbled bacon & black pepper and serve over a hot bed of white rice and you've got a great Southern side dish.

Very easy recipe. Just what I had in mind. I'm still learning some of the basics, so this was very helpful. Homemade doesn't even compare to canned. I also cut up some fresh okra and added it along with some fresh ground pepper. Delicious!

This worked well for me since I was just trying to figure out how to use up a bunch of end-of-season tomatoes. I did add onion, celery and celery leaves to this and chopped my tomatoes a bit smaller. Used this in several recipes from this site and they worked perfectly in those recipes every time! Will use again for season batches of tomatoes!!

These were pretty good. I think it needs more salt. Also mine were very watery...maybe it was my tomatoes?

I used these in spaghetti and then lasagna the following days.

I am a 70 year old male home cook and I learned how to make stewed tomatoes as well as how to make canned tomatoes  from my Mother when I was eleven years old .  This recipe leans more toward canned tomatoes, however, had the author addressed this as PLAIN STEWED TOMATOES, she would not have received some of the comments I have read.  So, that is why I gave it an "OK".  You can add anything you want to this recipe to make it your own.

I'd double the meat,  use some home made stew tomatos, and put ground thyme instead of dried, and put chili powder in place if the basil when i discover i was out of basil and it still turn out to rave reveiws from my family.  I add a pinch more of the chili power and thyme the recipe called for

This is a useless recipe; is NOT even a recipe; it's boiled tomatoes;  I'm sure this person has a 5 star recipe on here for boiled water also.

I was looking for a homemade equivalent to canned tomatoes, and this was perfect!  I did add a little dried oregano and basil, but I didn't think it needed any sugar, as some reviewers suggested.  I skipped the step about removing the skins and just chopped my tomatoes up, skin and all.  I froze it in can-sized quantities to use in recipes and will definitely be making this again.  Delicious, and the skins weren't a problem in the finished product.
