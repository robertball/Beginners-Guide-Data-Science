Had to make a couple adjustments based on availability, otherwise, made as written.  The store was out of the Uncle Ben's® Ready Rice Long Grain, so I used Uncle Ben's®  Ready Rice Jasmine.  Couldn't find blood orange white balsamic vinegar, so I used Trader Joe's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar for the vinaigrette (worked for me!).  Interesting combination with that little bit of mayonnaise coating the rice so nicely and then tossed with the orange vinaigrette at the end.  You get a nice pop of sweetness from the cranberries and a little crunch from the celery and pecans.  All layers of flavor are in harmony, with not one dominating.  Would't change a thing in this recipe, it was  delicious today served with grilled fresh Gulf shrimp.  Marianne, thanks for creating this recipe, thumbs up!!
