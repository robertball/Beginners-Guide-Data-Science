I have been making bread for 27 years. This is the best I have ever made. It's texture is perfect and flavor is as well. I am so happy to have found this. I thought home made bread was doomed to be heavy and nothing like you could buy. I reccomend it highly!

This bread had a uniqueness that sets it apart from most breads made in "machines".  The texture was firmer, and less spongelike than what usually comes out of bread machines---by the way, these qualites to me are WONDERFUL.  I will make this bread often.  Thank you for posting this recipe.
Best wishes,
Jeff

This turned out very well.  I cut the sugar down to 1 T., the salt to 1-1/2 tsp. and used olive oil rather than vegetable oil.  I used the bread machine from start to finish. Unfortunately my bread machine doesn't do well browning the top of the loaf so after removing it from the bread maker I brushed the top with butter and put it in a 375 degree oven for about 10 minutes.  This is a soft, moist, basic white bread with great flavor.

This is the best white bread recipe I've tried in my bread machines. I am using a basic, cheap Breadman Ultimate machine and this bread turned out beautifully. It has great aroma, texture and flavor. It's wonderful with butter or in a sandwich.The crust is beautiful.

I followed this recipe exactly and the dough ball was way too moist. I wonder if the 1 3/8 cup water was supposed to be 1 1/8 ?

excellent!  I tried this recipe and it worked like a charm - I've used bread machines for years - and this recipe didn't disappoint!  I have a diabetic in my home so I used a high quality sugar substitute and the recipe worked beautifully - firm loaf, tasty and light...

This is the best homemade bread I have made to date. I prepared the dough in the bread machine and then let the dough rise in a greased bowl for 40 minutes and then again for 1 hour in the greased loaf pan before baking at 350 for 1 hour. It is now two days after I baked it and it is still fresh! Great!

The smell was wonderful while baking and the bread came out really nice.  We did think it was a little too salty, so next time I will cut the salt down to 1 tsp.  Will definetly make again.  Thanks Robin

This recipe was a little disappointing, as it made only a small loaf in my machine, & I found it a bit heavy. I've tried it twice with the same result, so will try again with a little more liquid.It did have a very good flavour, so I think with some adjusting, it will turn out better.

i scaled recipe down to 12 servings because my bread machine was so old (squeak squeak) i wasn't sure of it's capacity.  perfect fit.  made this recipe 3 times - first with all-purpose flour - we were very excited so we all ranted and raved.  then i went out and purchased bread flour - it was ok but much firmer.  made it again with all purpose flour and kids (ages 15 & 12) said it was tough on the 2nd day.  it makes EXCELLENT toast for dipping in soups and sauces!  i'll be testing white bread II next.  btw - does anybody know what kind of grease to grease a bread machine with???

My husband now will only eat this bread, much like the children of the person who shared it. It tastes good and has great texture for cutting. I had a heck of a time making bread for sandwiches until this recipe turned up.

Our new favorite bread! Once I found this recipe I couldn't stop making it. Texture is wonderful as is the aroma that fills the house when it is baking. Have not ever made machine bread that tasted this good before.

Worked great making the dough in the bread machine and then shaping into rolls and baking normally. 350 degrees for 20 to 22 minutes. I used a glass baking pan.
Very tender!

This is a great machine bread recipe!!  The consistency is perfect.  I only used 1 and 1/2 teaspoon salt, everything else as stated.  I baked it on the 1.5 lb loaf setting( 3 hours total) and the size of the loaf was just right.  Try It!!

I made these into rolls and they were fine, but not one of my favorite bread recipes. My son loved them and both he and my daughter said they tasted like biscuits. Seems like an awful lot of extra work to just taste like biscuits.

This was so-so.  The taste is good, but the bread didn't rise like i expected it to and it stayed very dense.  I probably won't make again.

I did make a slight change to the recipe. Sorry for that. I put in 2 tsp of bread machine yeast, and 1/4 of mashed potato flakes but I packed the measuring cup down full.  Also this is a trick I learned from a different recipe and I haven’t been let down yet. I added the 1 3/8 C of warm water, 2 Tbsp of sugar, and the 2 tsp of yeast to the bread machine first and let the yeast foam for about 10 minutes. Then I added canola oil(I prefer canola over vegetable), bread machine flour, nonfat milk powder, salt 
and mashed potato flakes.  Set my machine on Basic, 1 1/2 lb loaf size, and medium color crust. It came out perfect the first time!!!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I will be using this one always when we want white bread!!  It is delicious, cuts perfectly, is soft and moist. It’s a dream!!  Thanks again!!

The only think I didn't have was dry milk powder so I replaced it with 3/8 cup of milk and reduced the water to 1 cup. I was surprised the bread didn't come out as white as some of the pictures but regardless nice texture and chew. I used my bread to make garlic bread with a spaghetti dinner we had.

I have had to adjust this recipe a little for my machine (and my family's tastes) by adding more potato flakes, wheat germ and a little more yeast. I found it rises better without falling in my machine if I put  1/4 the yeast in each corner. We have made this about 3 times a day, for about 3 weeks now. Sometimes we add dried fruit to it with cinnamon!

Followed recipe exactly, came out great! It did not take the full 3 hours to cook, so keep an eye on it, I took it out about 15 minutes early and it was perfect. That might depend on your bread machine.
