I made these yesterday and my family really enjoyed them. We jut started eating vegan for my husband's heart health, so I'm looking for new recipes to replace old favorites. These were moist and yummy and were a very nice addition to our Sunday brunch. I used 1 cup ww flour, 1 cup ww pastry flour and it worked nicely. Thanks for sharing, Mallow1!

These muffins had a good flavor, but you could tell by their appearance and texture that they are a lower fat type muffin. They don't have that smooth, slightly moist top most muffins have. The interior is soft, yet extremely dense. The exterior is slightly hard and has more of a crusty texture. The batter is very thick and the way it is spread is the way it bakes up. So consider that, if not spreading smoothly on top. Only change I made was using mini chocolate chips, pumpkin spice for the nutmeg, and King Arthur white whole wheat. These would fit most diets. The calories are also quite low for a muffin. Might be good with some coffee.

These turned out great. I only had white flour on hand so I used that instead of the whole wheat. I also used apple cider instead of water to boost those fall flavors.  They did stick to the paper but that doesn't really bother me.  The fact that it's not full of added fats more than makes up for it. Great recipe!

Really good! Didn't even notice missing egg.  Used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 white whole wheat, 1/2 pumpkin and 1/2 no-added-sugar applesauce and also used almond milk instead of water. My son ate 6 of these right out of the pan.

Great healthy breakfast muffin for the kids. Not too sweet which I appreciate. I did add an egg because the mixture was extremely dry before baking and I wasn't necessarily looking for a vegan recipe. I agree with the other reviewers that if you leave out the chocolate chips, you need to add raisins, diced apple, cranberries, or something for a little extra sweetness

This was a wonderful recipe! Super easy to make, and it tasted great. It was a hit with all of my friends (who are all meat and dairy eaters, some scoffed at the "Vegan" name first, saying vegan foods don't taste the same). They all LOVED it. The only thing I would add is to add some oil in the muffin liners. The muffins got stuck to the liners themselves and wouldn't come off.

These muffins are fantastic! To make the batter more moist, I added an egg (which isn't vegan, but really helped the recipe!). I also substituted 1/4 teaspoon of the nutmeg for pumpkin pie spice. I would recommend using foil cupcake liners, because the muffins don't stick to them. Overall, this was a great recipe. I will definitely be making these again!

I was so surprised by how good this turned out. I used all brown flower which added a nice grainy texture to it, and made a cake instead of muffins. So yummy! And I agree that the chocolate chips are worth it- but if you skip them you would want to put some sort of added something (nuts, dates, raisins) to add sweetness.

This recipe was a big hit with the entire family. I didnâ€™t have whole wheat flour, so I used white flour and I added a half cup of applesauce to cut the dryness that I read in other reviews. The kids said they liked them much better than my normal non-vegan muffins. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this right to the directions and it came out great. For the brown sugar I used the Splenda Brown sugar to get a lower actual sugar amount. I also sprayed the liners with olive oil spray and none of the muffins stuck to the papers.

I made these again today and used 15 Oz of sugar free apple sauce that we canned last fall. I also used apple pie spice instead of nutmeg. Instead of chocolate chips I used a half cup of walnuts, this version is healthier and tastes just as good. My wife also loved them.

Good base recipe, I wanted a low fat Vegan recipe. To fix the 'dry' aspect  I replaced the 1/2 cup of water with applesauce, and added  1 tbs of Ground flax seed mixed with two tbs of water.  They came out moist and fluffy. The calorie count and fat content is awesome.

The batter was extremely "crumbly" and not smooth at all.  I kept double-checking to see if ?I missed something!!!!  Very dry and powdery

These turned out good! We made them with  one cup gluten-free all-purpose flour, one cup old-fashioned oats, and substituted a little bit over 1/3 cup agave nectar for the brown sugar.   Instead of chocolate chips, we used raisins. We also added  1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp ground cloves,  and a little bit of apple juice (gluten free flour tends to need more moisture than regular flour).  Yum! We will make them again!

This recipe is amazing! I used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin instead of a tin, but other than that I followed the recipe. They were moist, sticky and almost like a brownie consistency. The taste was perfect - not too sweet, not too spicy :)

Made the recipe exactly as written and turned out great.  It's not just low fat but also fairly low sugar and high fiber compared to most muffins.

After reading the reviews I made a few modifications.  I used 1 c whole grain flour, 3/4 c. Old fashioned oats, and 2 tbsp flax seed meal instead of the 2 c flour.  Then I did add an egg-- I was looking for healthy not necessarily vegan.  I used carrot juice instead of the water. And added 2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1.  I also added honey roasted sliced almonds 1/2 c instead of the choc. Chips.  They taste moist and quite delicious.  The nuts add a bit of crunch.  They are not a sweet muffin, but a good healthy alternative.

With all the great reviews, I expected more.  Unfortunately, came out rather dense and dry.

I made these without the salt and a little less chocolate chips to make them have less fat and lower sodium. The batter was very sticky and thick. The muffins turned out very dense and all I could taste was the wheat flour. I would change the recipe to have more spices, no wheat flour and maybe more water or less flour all together.

These muffins are delicious! I added more chocolate chips because why not indulge? I made two batches, one following the recipe and one with vanilla and pumpkin spice. They both were delish! I DEFINITELY will make again!

I loved this recipe, The only thing i would point out that the best pumpkin you can use is from a can, that is really gooey and sticky. otherwise they dont set up all the way and they are not as sweet.

Super yummy and healthy! Just made them and they're really soft and have a good pumpkin flavor. The chocolate chips sweeten them up and are perfect for chocolate lovers!

Made these the other day and loved them.  I used muffin liners and after I baked them, I put them in the fridge which helped the muffins to be not so sticky when the liner was peeled off.  Will definitely be making these again!
