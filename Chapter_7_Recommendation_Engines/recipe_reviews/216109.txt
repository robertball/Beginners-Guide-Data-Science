Oh. My. Goodness. Did everyone's "old man" make this after every Thanksgiving? Mine didn't but I learned from my father in law how to make this. He always boiled down the turkey carcass and used the "juice" from that and pieced out the bones from the meat and added more chopped leftover turkey and he added a cup or so of leftover turkey gravy, a little worchestershire and a couple bay leaves. (He didn't add that much salt, but he did add quite a bit. I only season to taste because I'm not a big salter of food.) It's one of my husband's favorite parts of Thanksgiving and now that my father in law has been gone for almost five years, I make this for my husband and boys and we reminisce over our favorite memories of him. Thanks for posting this recipe, it's such a wonderful recipe that I'm sure is not just a family tradition for only our family.

My family enjoys turkey noodle soup, but I rarely made it because I always made it with the turkey carcass.   Now we can have turkey noodle soup anytime!!!  This recipe was straightforward,  easy to make, and the result was DELICIOUS!

Use fresh turkey drumsticks - they're cheap, come in an easy to handle pack of 2 or 3 and always available in our local market.  Much better result and easier to handle than a leftover carcass which has had most of the flavor cooked out of it already. Follow the recipe as written for best results.

Seriously, this was the best turkey (I used chicken) soup recipe I've ever used.  All of the spices were right on which is the most important thing in this recipe.  I used chicken thighs and breast instead of turkey and I cut the water by half and used vegetable stock for the rest.  I will use this recipe from now on.  EXCELLENT!

This is an excellent soup!  I did use 1/2 tsp (maybe more) of black pepper because we are big fans, and also added about 1/2 a cup of heavy cream (I do this with nearly all my soups).  It was fantastic.  The herb mix is just perfect.  This works just as well with white meat too.

I love this soup! I boiled the leftover carcass of my Christmas turkey for several hours, removed the solids by using a strainer and had the 3 quarts of broth. In my stock pot, I saut√©ed the onion, celery and carrot, along with the spices and herbs in a small amount of olive oil until softened. Then added back in the broth and several cups of cut up white and dark meat. I brought to a boil then reduced heat and allowed it to simmer for about an hour before adding in the cooked noodles. Delicious and So easy!

I made this from left over turkey bones. My tip is to place all the turkey bones from cutting up a turkey and placing them on tin foil and bake the bones until they are nice and brown and crispy looking. Then I boil them in the water from potatoes and the broth has so much more flavour. 
I followed the rest of this recipe and if was yummy.

Fabulous!!!!!  I was looking for a soup to use the leftover turkey from the bone in turkey breasts I had made earlier in the week.  I followed the basic recipe but made a few adjustments.  I had 4 cups turkey breast meat and also the carcass from the turkey breast and used that instead of the drumsticks.  I used 9 cups water and 3 cans low sodium chicken broth.  The seasoning was perfect but I doubled the sage, thyme and rosemary since I was making a larger batch.  I added the 4 cups turkey at the end.  I also threw in a cup each of frozen peas and corn at the end and used Ronzoni whole grain egg noodles that I added right to the pot (a 12 oz package).  The house smells amazing and the soup tastes even better.  Perfect combination of flavors!  This ones a keeper!

Did not care for this at all.  Followed recipe to a "T". Had a funny after taste and just didn't look appealing at all.  I guess I'm just not a fan of dumping everything the pot and simmering it.

Excellent and very easy. I've made it twice now and loved it. I use smoked turkey legs, since my local market carries them regularly, and "Grandma's" fresh frozen egg noodles which I thawed and added straight to the soup.

This is a stupendous soup recipe.  I use a leftover turkey carcass with plenty of meat left on it as the base for my soup.  The original submitter of this recipe says her dad made this and that was the extent of his culinary efforts.  My 'old man' was a cook too and he would have definitely made a soup like this.  Highly suggest serving this soup to warm your cockles on a cold winters day.

I wanted to make a turkey noodle soup with our turkey left overs and I used this recipe as my starter.  Since I was using cooked turkey instead of drumsticks, I let the other recipes ingredients simmer in 8 cups of chicken broth for 30 minutes before I added the turkey meat.  Once I added the turkey, I let that simmer for 40 minutes and added a bag of the frozen "homemade" noodles and happened to glance at their recipe for "chicken noodle soup" and theirs called for adding 1/2 cup flour with a cup of milk mixed together in a leak proof jar and poured into the broth as a thickener and to add 3 more cups of milk to the soup once the noodles had cooked for 30 minutes.  It was oh so very yummy!! Saved this one in my recipe box!

I used leftover turkey in lieu of the drumsticks.  I also used part chicken broth, part water in lieu of all water.  Next time I will use all chicken or turkey broth and I will up the spices.  It was good but prefer a little more flavor as a personal preference.  This makes a very large pot of soup.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, KDcook!

Had some leftover turkey and wanted to make a good soup. This was it!!! Only changes I made was to use chicken broth instead of water and omitted the 1 Tbsp salt since I wouldn't be cooking the turkey in the water. I mixed everything together, put it in the Crock Pot on High for an hour to cook the vegetables then turned to Low for about 4 hrs. Add the cooked noodles to the pot  about 10 minutes before serving to give them more flavor. I served these with hot biscuits and got rave reviews from my family! Just right for a cold rainy night! Thanks for posting!

This is a very flavorful soup! The small amount of spices are perfect for the quantity of broth and don't overwhelm but enhance the recipe.  It makes you wonder, "Wow, this is great, what are those delicious flavors?"  I modified it by sauteing garlic, onion, spices (only used 1/4 tsp sage but given amounts of all other spices) and celery in 1/2 stick melted butter.  Then I whisked  1/2 cup flour into 1 cup milk--ended up having to add chicken broth to thin--and poured into sauteed mix.  To this I added 6 cups chicken broth, 4 or 5 cups water and 1 tsp Better than Bouillon chicken flavor.  I used fresh celery leaves.  I also added 1/2 cup canned corn, 1 tblspn Hormel real bacon bits (these turned out to be undetectable and one should either add more or omit), and pre-cooked, 2.5 or 3 cups shredded turkey breast instead of dark meat and 4 cups egg noodles.  It's absolutely delicious, mild yet flavorful and a fantastic way to use left-over holiday turkey.   I will definitely be adding this to my repertoire!

...and then I wept.  

Boy, I do NOT like messing with a turkey carcass (which I used instead of drumsticks) but to have just one sip of this simple soup makes it all worth it.  Such a classic wonderful taste.  Can't wait to be done with Thanksgiving so I can make it this weekend.

We loved this soup, but I did make some changes.  I used my turkey drippings and leftover gravy along with chicken broth in place of the water.   I was out of sage, so I used 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning in place of the individual seasonings.  I didn't add any salt, because I didn't use water and with the addition of the fresh celery, I did see the need for the celery salt.  I have also found that soups with pasta, when leftovers are stored, the pasta absorbs all of the broth.  I add my noodles as I serve the soup.  You can precook noodles and store them with a little melted butter to keep them from sticking to each other.   We liked the soup better than the turkey dinner.

As others have noted.. this turkey soup recipe is delicious.  Only changes I made... used leftover turkey, I had no rosemary so I threw in a bay leaf.  I used egg noodles.  I threw in a box of chicken broth along with 3 quarts of water.  This is now my go to chicken/ turkey soup recipe.

I've made this soup after Thanksgiving for 2 years now.  Didn't change a thing, although I may add a bay leaf next time.  This is the BESTEST turkey noodle soup I've tried and look NO further for a better one!  My 28 yr old son's mouth waters while it's cooking; doesn't get better than that!!! - Barbara S.

I used the carcus from my Thanksgiving turkey. The only changes I made were to omit the celery salt (I didn‚Äôt have any) and added parsley. This soup was delicious. My husband raves about it. I will definitely make it again.

I roasted two turkey drumsticks and two turkey thighs. I didn't care for how they came out. I decided that I would make a soup. So I made this in a round-about way. I removed a good amount of the skin. Then placed them in a pot of water with chopped onions, carrots and celery, along with the spices. I simmered for 1 hour. I strained it, and after the meat cooled cooled somewhat, removed it from the bones. After being in the fridge overnight, I skimmed off the thin layer of fat.  For the soup, I added  onions, celery and carrots to the strained broth. After coming to a boil, I let it simmer for about 35 min, then added the cooked drumstick meat and a handful of frozen peas. I let it simmer another 10 min or so.  I also added a tblsp of corn starch mixed with a little water to thicken it a bit. This was SO MUCH BETTER than the plain, roasted drumsticks that I started with! Turkey meat has a lot of protein, too. It was fine without the noodles, but I have some leftovers so may try with it. I'm going to try a turkey salad with the leftover thighs. Thanks, and I highly recommend this!

Let me just say that this is one of the best soup recipes ever! I have made this several times and am just now writing this review. You can make this as is and it will be delicious. Since I am not one to waste anything, I used this recipe along with my Thanksgiving turkey carcass. I put the carcass and the drumsticks in an 8 quart stock pot, covered the contents with water and started the creation process. I pretty much doubled the spices and added additional veggies, but the outcome was fantastic. Since there are Keto dietary requirements in this household, I also cooked some collard greens using just broth from this soup and substituted the collard greens for the egg noodles. That was also a big hit. I am also a dad and I cook everything! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I use rotisserie chicken instead of turkey, and triple the seasonings. (except for the salt and celery salt) Simmer for at least an hour.

Followed the recipe exactly.  It seems more like turkey stew then soup.  Very thick--uses too much turkey which is what made it so thick.  Also had a strong rosemary flavor--the 1/2 teaspoon seemed to overwhelm the other herbs.  While this recipe was ok, I probably won't be making it again.

I made it with a wild turkey quarter, and although the turkey didn't really taste like store bought turkey, but more like pork, the soup itself was delicious and perfectly seasoned. I would definitely make it again if I came upon more free turkey meat.

Made this to the letter using three fresh turkey drumsticks, and it came out extremely bland.  Reheating the leftover soup the next night, I added A LOT of curry powder, some garam masala, and 1 Tbs lemon juice to my bowl.  Much better, but still not a "WOW."

This was a good recipe. I was really nervous about using the thyme and rosemary but it actually came out great. I added a can of chicken broth to the turkey broth. The only problem was that it needed more salt. But it was great and smells great

I  did not add the noodles because I like a lot of broth in my soup and was afraid that it would be too thick.  i also used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 beef broth for more flavor, It was excellent!!! I put a scoop of left over stuffing in a bowl with a dollop of sour cream then poured the hot soup over the mixture and YUMMMM it was so incredibly good.  I have eaten it for 3 days straight. Also I only used 2 bay leaves and like 4 fresh sage leaves and 1 tablespoon poultry seasoning  rather that the individual spices.  I did add garlic powder because I did not have any fresh garlic

Wonderful soup! I used the turkey stock from Thanksgiving for half of the water, and leftover turkey, white and dark meat. I look forward to making it again, and next time I will use the legs.

This soup is wonderful - best soup I ever made. I did follow the suggestions from Sarah Jo and used the carcass, a little Worcestershire sauce, and a cup or so of the Thanksgiving gravy. Thank you for the recipe Kay D, and Sarah Jo for the suggestions in the reviews.

Delicious substitute for chicken noodle soup.  I saved the wings and legs of my Thanksgiving turkey to make this soup.

I made it last night and it turned out awesome. I only made minor tweeks. I added 2 packets of sodium free chicken bouillon to the water, and a reduced the salt, only used 1/2 a tablespoon instead of the original 1 tablespoon. I am not a lover of super salty soups. It was simple and delicious! Thanks for the recipe :)

I always serve the carved turkey breast to my guests at Thanksgiving and save the drumsticks for soup. This year I tried this recipe and I will be sticking to it from now on. The vegetables and spices combine just perfectly for that cozy comfort-food feeling. Followed the recipe exactly, except for adding an extra clove of garlic because I love the stuff. I'm sure it would have tasted just as good as written though.
