This was even better the next day. I tasted it half way through and decided it didn't have any flavor. I added a teaspoon of cracked red pepper and a tablespoon chopped rosemary. Also I used low fat sour cream and low fat cream cheese. With these changes it really kicked it up a notch and everyone went back for seconds.

We were laying tile in our home all day, and I didn't want to cook dinner, so started this in the morning and cooked some curly noodles to go with it at dinnertime.  I took note of other reviewers who commented on the saltiness and used Italian spices instead of the salad dressing. After tasting it, I thought it was still salty, so didn't salt the noodles during cooking. That took care of the salt problem. I didn't feel like making a salad, so I nuked some mixed veg and added them to the sauce. It is certainly easy and filling, but nothing to write home about. Hubs said it reminded him of chicken pot pie. I thought it tasted like dressed-up canned cream of chicken soup.

My family of 5 loved it, I adjust the serving for 10. I added a can of celery, curry and cayenne pepper, garlic powder. I needed it to be a little spicy. I had plate lickers by the end of dinner, lol

I added a jar of basil tomato sauce and omitted the Italian spice. Only added black pepper and 1/4 cups of water so it wouldn't be too dry. We put it on top of whole grain penne pasta. Family loved it. Note: did not add any salt to this recipe. We do not like salty foods, and for health reasons cannot have too much salt. Anyone can always add it to their plate should they desire.

It was nice and easy to make! Great if you don't want to do to much work. Needs something a little more to give it some more taste. As you can see in the pic i add, we did it with pasta next time I'm going to try it with rice. I believe it would be way better on rice.

Easy and tasty! It didn't take the whole six hours, maybe four, for my chicken. I added some cheddar cheese into the sauce as well. It turned out well and I've got enough for two more dinners, as I try to meal prep

My family LOVED this....I doubled the recipe, and it served my family of 5 (including 2 men!) easily with leftovers, which is a hit with my husband, and even tickled my picky 17 year old daughters taste buds

This turned out great over rice.  I didn't have any Italian seasoning so I used fresh minced garlic, Rosemary, cracked pepper, onion and red pepper flakes and added a little more sour cream.  Very tasty and easy!

Very good.  All the kids loved it.  I used frozen chicken breasts straight from the freezer and shredded at the end.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and did curry (about 1.5 teasp.) and cayenne (about 1/8 teaspoon), plus garlic powder and lots of fresh ground pepper.  I omitted the italian seasoning all together. I stirred in a splash of chicken broth into the sauce to thin it when I shredded the chicken.  Served over penne which I just stirred into the crock for serving.

Rated it at 3 stars ONLY because it was lacking flavor.  The overall ease of the recipe was great and I loved that it required little preparation and not too long cooking in the crock pot.  The flavor just wasn't enough.  How I improved it (well, I think it's improved) is I added the following ingredients - salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes (just for a slight kick), fresh mushrooms, frozen peas and carrots, and instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and added a can of cream of chicken soup.  I also seasoned the chicken with just salt and pepper before I put it in the crock pot.

This was really, really good!  I made it for our family and some friends a few weeks ago and it came out perfect!  I'm actually going to the store now to buy the ingredients to make it again--this time I'm going to add some beef tips in with the chicken at my husband's request, he loves the sauce this makes.

I made this tonight but kicked up the flavor a bit! I used two cans of cream of chicken, a squeeze of refrigerated chopped garlic, lots of black pepper, chopped onion, and sliced mushrooms. Also added a half a cup of water. If the sauce ends up being too thin, make a slurry of corn starch and milk or flour and milk. Served over rice. So good!

I made this but I didn't use a slow cooker. I browned the chicken in a skillet and while I was cutting it up I made the sauce in the same skillet. I then added the chicken to the sauce along with some peas. I've never seen my daughter eat so fast.

Just made this for dinner today. It was pretty good, I added black pepper and served it over white rice. I was pretty delicious. My mom liked it and she is kind of picky since we are latinos lol.

I read the reviews and I added chopped onions, minced garlic and salt and pepper.  I still thought it could use a little something but it was tasty.  I cooked pasta and rice and it was definitely better with rice.

I am just making this recipe today! I followed the directions but also noticed that many of you thought it didn't have enough flavour. I added touches of other spices like crushed red pepper and garlic to give it some more flavour and I hope it turns out good!

I added some Old Bay seasoning, and left the chicken breasts whole then I stopped to shred the chicken with two forks about an hour before dinner. Next time I'll double the sauce portion of the recipe. We enjoyed it.

Delicious! Only mistake I made was adding cooked pasta to slow cooker at the end. The pasta soaked up a lot of the sauce and became pasty..pour over pasta instead... otherwise,  a great tasting simple recipe!

This recipe is great! The only thing I did differently was I used a half of a pack of Italian dressing mix instead of the Italian seasoning.

I have made this recipe and it is very simple to do. The chicken comes out very soft and the sauce from once u mix ingredients is awesome. Just set your slow cooker and let it do it's job. Good week night dinner or weekend.

I use about double the chicken called for as it cooks down a lot. Served over white rice, it's a delicious meal that even my pickiest will devour!

We did not care for this. Maybe cutting down on the onion would help. Would not recommend

It sounded so good, I had to try. I doubled the recipe and the time was an added hour. I used Newman's garlic alfredo sauce and added copped onions half way through the 5.5 hours and italian seasoning in the beginning with a bay leaf. 

My family was happy and full with this and a side salad.
Thank you.

Very good. I made my own cream of mushroom from a recipe on this app and used that. I also didn't put it in a slow cooker. I boiled the chicken down for a couple hours; until it was fibrous and a thick stock. Added that to the sauce and cooked out more water. Added garlic powder, cayenne, paprika, and habanero hot sauce. Amazing.

The cream cheese and sour cream really cover the flavor added. Wanted more flavor, so  decided it could go on either rice or noodles! That gave me ideas for a Hispanic type version (added a can of Rotel and some garlic at beginning). Another time upped the flavor with fennel seed powder and garlic (increasing Italian seasoning to 1 1/2 tsp). This is a recipe that one can have a lot of fun varying as the meal warrants. Feel like it is "dry" -- just add some evaporated milk.  Hey, even some bacon crumbles tossed on it would be delicious. Want more veggies -- add some shredded carrots and diced up celery in the beginning. have fun with this!!

I made the recipe as written for the fist time, but I added salt and pepper.  I also added some Sweet Hungarian Paprika just to add a little zing. This might need some peas or broccoli added in the last 30 minutes to give it some color.

Hubby loved it! I served it with veggie noodles to make it a bit more colorful and tried to use either non fat or low fat products.

Very good & very easy to make. I definitely added more spices than the recipe called for, including a dash of red pepper flakes to give it a little more dimension. It was a big hit and it made enough for two dinners for two and another lunch for me. I served it with penne pasta, as pictured, and sprinkled Parmesan & more red pepper flakes on top. Next time I would add something green like asparagus or peas as the cooking time neared the end.

I liked the recipe. I changed it a little. I added sliced/diced carrots, celery and onions. I used italian seasoning and I added garlic salt and pepper. The chicken I cut into bite sized pieces. When it came close to being done I noticed it was more of a soup consistancy so I added just a little flour to make the sauce a little more thick. I served it over egg noodles. It was a hit in my house! I definitely will use this recipe again. Yummy!

This was so good! I served it over rice, my four year old straight up refused to even try it (nothing unusual), but my ten year old liked it and gobbled it up. I must have done something wrong though I think, the chicken came out quite dry. It was still very tasty, so I will try again and see if I can fix whatever I did wrong.
