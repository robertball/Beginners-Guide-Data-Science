OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!!  I have found my new most favorite, easiest chicken recipe!  AND... the whole family LOVED it!!  I did make a few changes though, but I always do!  I had no egg substitute, so I used regular eggs (yoke and all!). I had 4 chicken breasts.  I did NOT pound them to half inch thickness, I just sliced them the best I could and they were fine.  For 4 chicken breasts, I tripled the potato flakes and bread crumbs.  And I used 4 eggs to dip them in.  Lastly... who ever heard of frying chicken in 2 T. of oil???  not here!  I used about an inch of oil.  They were PERFECT!  I would go for these over store bought- anyday!  I served them w/ flaky biscuits and mashed sweet potatoes.  I posted a picture...  look for it!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Finally! I've been looking for THE recipe for crispy chicken strips. I didn't have potato flakes (never actually purchased these before) so I used Lay's Wavy Potato Chips (ranch flavor). I also fried the strips in about 2 inches of oil and added garlic powder, paprika to the dry mixture. Oh, and I used two beaten eggs. Wow. Just fabulous. I'm going to try different flavored potato chips next time. Experiment with this one -- it's a great foundation recipe.

Instead of using the seasoned bread crumbs, we substituted Panko bread crumbs.
We didn’t have egg substitute so we used one egg white.  This is a really fast, easy and delicious addition to any chicken lovers recipe file.  No doubt, we’ll make this one again.

HELPFUL TIPS FOR BUSY MOMS!: If you're like me, you always want/need to prepare things ahead of time (like at naptime), so I just fry these up 2-4 min. on each side (a tad golden on each side - med-high heat) ...and then after I dry them on paper towels, keep on a 9X13 dish in the fridge.  When daddy gives the call that he's coming home, I pop it in the oven at 350 for 20-25 min.  Voila!!  Fresh, still tastes fried, and just as yummy!  I always use italian style bread crumbs and a little shake of salt and mrs. dash while frying.  Oh, and I always use whatever I have on hand which is flavored potato flakes!  Mmm...

I prefer to bake food rather than fry, but once in a while you just gotta go for it!  These were really yummy and so easy to make.  I used panko crumbs in place of the seasoned bread crumbs, so I seasoned them with a little season salt, black pepper, garlic powder and cajun seasoning.  I eyeballed the seasonings and realized while eating them that I had added a little too much salt so will cut back next time.  I also didn't have egg substitute, so I used 1 whole egg and 1 egg white.  I used defrosted breast cutlets that were the perfect shape for this recipe and did not pound them out.  I also used more oil to give it that deep fried crust rather than just pan frying.  They cooked up beautifully and the panko really gives it a better crunch than plain bread crumbs.  They were nice and moist on the inside and I dipped them in two different sauces...a ranch mixed with hot sauce and a honey mustard.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was a huge hit in my house. My husband LOVED it. I used flour instead of bread crumbs ( forgot em @ the store) and it worked good. Gotta keep the grease going or they will burn.

Wouldn't change a thing.  I used real egg, which was fine.  The coating is great - love the potato taste.  Don't be stingy with the oil or they will burn.  I served this with a spicy honey mustard sauce and corn seasoned with cinnamon and red pepper.

Excellent Chicken Strips! Everyone loved them. I am out of seasoned bread crumbs so I used Panko and added kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and chopped fresh parsley. I also used 2 eggs (I doubled the recipe) in place of the egg substitute. These changes worked out perfectly. This is a super fast, super easy weeknight dish to throw together with excellent results. Very tender, juicy chicken that has a flavorful, crunchy breading. We will use this often. Thanks for sharing!

I added some red chile flakes as others suggested more flavors.  I also used garic flavored potato flakes.  Very good.  Be careful not to cut strips too small...I did, and found it both messy to prepare and difficult to keep everything turning in skillet.  Bigger strips would have made this dish perfect.

Excellent recipe.  Next time I think we will try baking, just for the health aspect.  I did add extra pepper and garlic due to our tastes, but it would have been good as directed. For bread crumbs I ALWAYS use crushed croutons.  This time I had garlic and parmesan on hand which was nice without being overbearing.  Do use enough oil to keep your chicken from sticking!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! Easy for me and fills the need for my husband's fried chicken fix. Used a real egg (I don't buy the substitute) and a little more oil. Thank you for the great recipe!

This is probably my favorite thing to make. The strips are delicious - crispy on the outside. For a little extra flavor I tend to shake in a little onion powder and garlic salt, but it's really not necessary. These are awesome with barbeque sauce, ranch, and ketchup.

My kids finally ate the same meal that my husband and I ate!  I used panko breading and egg whites (egg beaters).  I do not fry food often, in fact, I can't remember the last time I fried chicken, but I will make this often just based on the fact the everyone in my family loved them!

Very good chicken strips :)  So simple but my family loved them.  I used the potato flakes with panko bread crumbs and seasoned them with salt, fresh ground black pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  I used one whole egg in place of the egg substitute.  I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes on parchment paper.  I will be frying these in oil next time like the recipe calls for.

I made these last night. They definitely get points for being simple to make, but I would have liked a little more flavor. I will be tweaking this recipe in the near future. I also fried it about an inch of oil. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it. I used chicken tenderloins. Added a little cayennne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the potato flake/bread crumb mixture. Substitued a small carton of egg white and added a little milk for the egg substitue. Needed extra oil for the cast iron skillet. Definitely will make this again.

We love these.  I use Italian Panko bread crumbs and they come out nice and crispy.  I also add 1T of Parmesan cheese for this amount of bread crumbs, and use 1 beaten egg (with a little buttermilk or milk + lemon juice and a dash of garlic powder).  I know my version is slightly different, but wanted to comment anyway because the potato flakes really work well with this.  My guys ask for these all the time, even the one who's not crazy about chicken.

I took some suggestions from other reviews about this recipe needing some spicing up.  I decided to marinate the chicken in the egg with added seasonings.  After pounding 1 1/2# of chicken breasts I cut it into 2 in wide strips.  I beat 2 medium eggs with  3 Tablespoons Tiger Sauce (Reily Foods Co.-New Orleans) 1 tsp. sea salt, 1 tsp. garlic powder,  & 1 tsp. onion powder- marinated the chicken in the frig for about 3 hours.  I used 1 cup mashed potato flakes (herb/butter) and 1 cup Panko bread crumbs - mixed in some paprika and a little garlic salt.   I decided to treat my familiy and fried the strips in veggie oil for 4 minutes.  They were golden, crispy and OH so delicious!!!  We dipped them in Honey Mustard salad dressing and Tiger Sauce. With the changes I have to give this basic recipe five stars and will definitely use it again. Sometime I will try baking the strips on a rack placed over a cookie sheet.  However, I don't think frying once in a while it too bad for a treat.  Enjoy!!!

My kids said these were better than fast food chains! Only difference was that I sprayed them with butter spray, then baked them on a rack over a jellyroll pan. They came out crunchy and delicious. I had mine with Sweet Baby Ray's Raspberry Chipotle BBQ sauce....mmmmm!!

Excellent super easy recipe!   Just what I wanted for a quick kid-friendly meal.   All of my kids love these chicken strips and will make them often!   My 8 year old loves to help bread the chicken.   To make them extra crispy we coated them twice with the egg mixture and then the coating.   WONDERFUL!!

My 9 year old loved these.  I used real egg and deep fried them.  I also cut up a breast into bite size pieces.  He said it better than any bites or nuggets he has eaten.  Thanks its a keeper.;}

Very good, but still missing something.  Followed the recipe to the letter and it needed some spicing up.  The next batch I added a few shakes of garlic powder and some seasoned salt and that did it!

Great dish! Very simple and easy. I prepared this dish for my family two nights in a row. I added cayenne pepper and paprika to my bread crumb mix. I also use a bit more vegetable oil than 2 tablespoons. We ate it with wing sauce and it was delicious. Thanks Dawn for this recipe!

Excellent! and Oh so quick!  I thawed 3 chicken breasts in the microwave, breaded according to the directions (I added a little onion powder, garlic powder and salt to the breading mix) and deep fried!  They were finished in a matter of minutes!

I loved this combination because I had the potato flakes and bread crumbs on hand.  I did substitute the egg for fresh squeezed lemon just to add a different dimension of flavor.  But as others said, I did add more oil.  I used peanut oil as that is what I usually fry in.  Very good and will keep this recipe.

So wonderful! The coating turns out deliciously crispy, while the chicken inside is so tender and juicy... I used one egg with a bit of hot-sauce instead of the egg-substitute, and bread crumps, potato flakes and several spices. Fried them in about 1 inch of olive oil until golden brown. They keep well in the fridge and can be warmed in the oven later!

This was delicious!  I used a real egg and added a few spices.  Before dipping in egg, I sprinkled garlic powder, garlic salt, onion powder and a little cayenne pepper on both sides of the chicken.  I like the chicken itself to have a little flavor, but this recipe is still great as is.  The breading was nice and crunchy!

AMAZING!! And VERY easy to make! I didn't use any potato flakes but I used a little flour. I added a mixed garlic/pepper seasoning, it was so good!! I kept the width of the chicken thin as suggested and was glad I did. The chicken was very juicy.

Good base recipe because of all the variations that can be applied. I used crushed potato chips instead of potato flakes and real eggs instead of the egg subs. I used two eggs, but I was really just eyeballing the amount I needed. Because I used the potato chips (and that alone contains enough calories and fat) I decided to bake the chicken strips at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Turned out very well; moist and flavorful. Big thumbs up!!

My family loves these hands down!! Our picky two and a half year old devoured her plate and actually asked for seconds (this NEVER happens!!). I did use plain bread crumbs and real eggs but that's only because that's what I had on hand. A delicious recipe all in all!!

These were fantastic! I ut chicken breast into strips and baked these instead of frying them.  I spread a little canola oil on a 9X13 Pampered Chef stone pan.  Then drizzled a little olive oil on the top of the strips and baked at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes....my family loved these!

This was AMAZING! I cut 4 chicken breast into strips, used 1 egg beat with 1/2 cup of milk for my wash, and plain whole wheat bread crumbs seasoned with Season-All. Honey Mustard Sauce, also from this site, made a great dipping sauce for these crunchy delectable strips!

Used Lays instead of potato flakes as I did not have any on-hand. Fried in 1" oil as most people suggested. It was good (my chicken-strip-connoisseur-daughter enjoyed them), but I look forward to the low-salt, low-fry version for myself and my husband. Overall, a wonderful and versatile simple recipe.

I had several thawed chicken breasts left over & had to use them. This recipe was just right. I realized I had used up all the fake potato making bread. In my pantry I had a box of instant garlic cheese potatoes. It worked out great. The chicken stayed moist & the flavor was really good. Try this one! I also used Panko crumbs. YUM!!

I used Purdue thin chicken and cooked it in a deep fryer for 5 minutes came out perfectly. It could use a little more flavor ... I added garlic flakes, paprika, kosher salt, ground black pepper, and pepper flakes. Just need to figure out the right proportions. Overall a great recipe.

Very yummy, but I'm still looking for something closer to "restaurant style".

These were very good...won't replace my fave recipe which calls for cornflakes, but is a great alternative when I'm out of cereal!  The mashed potato flakes made the breading very interesting...crunchy but sort of creamy...hard to describe!

These chicken strips were good but not great.  I used one egg as others suggested.  I had to double the amount of oil otherwise they would have stuck to the pan.  When finished I added a little salt for more flavor. If I tried to make again I would probably also cut the breading in half as I coated them well, and half the breading was still in the bowl.  The coating is not "crispy" it is more like the texture of shake n' bake, but it does not seem to add any flavor. Although, the chicken does stay tender.  To save time I would use chicken tenders to cut the cutting step.  But, be prepared to clean a lot of dishes.  I would have to figure out how to cut down on that.  This is an okay chicken strip recipe for kids to dip in different sauce, but definitely not a crispy strip or  a chicken I would serve to adults.

This was so nice and easy to make, but I read the reviews first and made some changes as well. I'm in Canada so I couldn't easily find the Lays Ranch potato chips so I used Old Dutch Peppercorn Ranch chips, and got a tip from someone at work who told me to use panko breading instead of bread crumbs, so i tried half and half, the ones with panko were so much better! also added more pepper, next time i'm mixing in some hot sauce!

These were a huge hit.  I don't have any potatoe flakes so i use ripple chips and just crushed them. I love them, their easy and they made it into my rotation.

Great recipe! I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and just a little bit of garlic. Used 2 eggs, Italian bread crumbs, and mashed potato flakes -- fried until dark brown. Very tasty! Thanks!

This was wonderful. I have made these several ways (including the original recipe) and all are tasty. I have subbed cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs, and even flour for the bread crumbs in a pinch and my family enjoyed all of them. I used regular eggs as we do not usually have egg substitute on hand. I also added in salt, pepper and onion powder to my mix. I have used regular chicken breads, and chicken tenderloins with this recipe, but the tenderloins are my favorite.

Did not use egg sub, used whole eggs instead.  Instead of plain instant potatoes, I used red potato, garlic and cheese instant potatoes.  This was SOOOO good.  Served with Crawfish style dip. Used chicken tenders.

I loved this chicken! I used crutons and bread crumbs since i did'nt have any potatoe flakes. I also used my deep fryer and they came out nice and juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside! So yummy.....

Very good meal...we had no leftovers at all!  I didn't have the mashed potato flakes, but followed another reviewers suggestion of using potato chips.  I had a bag of sour cream and onion chips left over from the deli and they worked out perfectly.  I'll be keeping this recipe for the future!

My 10 yr old grandson was staying with us for school vacation and absolutely loved these as did my husband and myself. Perfect kid pleaser! I did double the coating and used approx 1/2-1 inch of canola oil. Oh and I did add some garlic powder to the dry ingrediants. Thanks for the post.

I've been looking for a good chicken strip recipe forever.  Normally when I make them I just sorta randomly throw various types of breading into a bowl (smashed crackers, chips, breadcrumbs, etc), some seasoning, and mix it up.  I used this recipe but modified it like many others.  I used instant potato flakes (Roasted Roasted Garlic "Idahoan" brand) because that's what I had, and seasoned breadcrumbs.  I also added a little seasoned salt, creole seasoning, and a small amount of Pico De Gallo seasoning for extra spice.  I used 2 eggs, added some hot sauce, and whisked it together, then dipped into the egg and coated with the breadcrumb mixture.  I also had to use much more oil than the recipe calls for.  It's wayyyy too little.  They turned out great!  Absolutely yummy.  I sprinkled some fresh shredded parmesan cheese onto them while they were still hot and they are very tasty.  I think my boyfriend will love them too.  He's still at work, but he's been begging me to make chicken strips (hate doing it because it's time consuming) and I think my modified version will be my new recipe from now on.  I agree with others that it is a good foundation recipe.  I've never thought of using potato flakes before.  What a great idea!  4 stars for getting me started on making these great strips, even though I modified it quite a bit :)

I made these for my dad because he is like a kid when it comes to chicken strips.  He buys them from the deli all the time so I thought I'd give this a try.  I knew just reading the recipe that these would need some seasoning.  I used real egg and added quite a bit of hot sauce to that and let the chicken sit in the mix for about 30 min.  Then put some garlic pepper in the breading and these were still really really bland.  If I make these again I know I'd really have to ramp up the seasoning and I would only use the potatoe flakes or just plain panko crumbs and not even bother with the bread crumbs and yes you will need more oil.  Worth another try I think.

Made these for a quick lunch for my son one day and he LOVED them!  Didn't have fake potatoes so I used ruffles crushed very fine and a little dry bread crumbs. I also put a little hot sauce in the egg mixture. Gives it a little pop:)

I thought these were a little bland and not sure if I will mess with the potato flakes again espically since I don't keep them on hand. I think if you add more spice it will give alot more flavor.

Since the overall rating is so high, I had high expectations.  My husband and I were disappointed in the flavor.  I had read the reviews, so i used Italian breadcrumbs, garlic potato flakes, added a dash of paprika and garlic powder.  Still kinda bland.  We will maybe marinate them beforehand?

Nothing special about these chicken strips. Cooked these for my boyfriend and he said they had good crunch but not much flavor. I would agree. I followed the recipe however I added a little garlic and cayenne powder.

The chicken stayed tender and not dry, however the flavor was not fabulous- a little bland for my liking even after adding garlic and using flavored potatoe flakes. Still looking for the PERFECT chicken strips recipe.

AWESOME! It's crunchy but not too crunchy. Perfect recipe for crunch. For my chicken, I used Tyson's tender strip chicken. I used potato flakes, Italian bread crumbs, and two eggs. I deep fried them for about 8 minutes. Next time I will season the chicken first before coating them.

This is a great simple recipe. I was using a recipe similar to this but thought I would give this a try. My whole family enjoyed it. Next time I might cut it even smaller to make nugget size pieces. It tastes great dipped in honey mustard.

These are very good! The mashed potato flakes give it a very crispy texture. I also used a regular egg and had no problems.

First time my chicken strips ever turned out really crunchy. Like others mentioned, I didn't have potato flakes and used crushed potato chips instead. I double-dipped, and did more of a deep-fry using a couple inches of oil in a small pan. My hubby loved them chopped in a green salad!

This was a pretty good recipe, we could not find seasonsed bread crumbs at our grocery store, only plain and italian. So I used plain bread crumbs and added onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper for added flavor and they turned out pretty good. I will make these again.

These were so easy to make!  We really enjoyed them.  I added a bit of fresh cracked black pepper to the crumb mix.  Very yummy and much easier to make than other chicken strip recipes I've seen.

Really good and really easy.  My kids loved these.  I used garlic potato flakes because that's what I had on hand and also dipped in regular eggs because I didn't have the egg substitute.  We dipped in ranch, ketchup and sweet and sour sauce.  I served it an asian pasta salad.  Definitely a keeper.
