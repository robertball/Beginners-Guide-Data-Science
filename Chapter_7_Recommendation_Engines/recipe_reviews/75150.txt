I really loved this recipe. The muffins taste best warm. I made them healthier by substituting a cup of yogurt and a cup of milk for the half-and-half and I used whole wheat flour.

These are delicious muffins!  I didn't have cream so I used 2% milk, and all blueberries.  I sprinkled a little oatmeal and brown sugar on top of each muffin and baked for 20 minutes.  They turned out great- moist even with the w/w flour and wheat germ.  Highly recommend!  Even my hubby loved them!

I thought these muffins turned out very nicely. I did modify the recipe a tiny bit - I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of 1 cup whole wheat, 1 cup white. I also substituted splenda for the sugar. I think it cuts out about 40 cals per muffin. These are a great snack, my husband and I love them.

These muffins were excellent!  I used all whole wheat flour and didn't have wheat germ or blackberries.  I used a little extra honey and 2 cups of frozen blueberries. Yummy,yummy!  And I froze the leftovers and they are great reheated in the microwave for about 30 seconds.

Made these this morning and they were really good. My girls gobbled them up when they were still warm. I use whole wheat pastry flour for my baking and added about 1/3 Cup more whole wheat flour because the batter was so runny, but they baked up perfectly.

This recipe was very easy and my kids loved it.  They are very moist and full of berries. If I hadn't made them myself, I would never have guessed it had wheat germ. The batter was much looser than most muffin batter which threw me off for a few minutes, but they cooked up nicely.

I didn't even eat these warm, and I thought they were terrific. All those berries make for one moist, delicious muffin! These are great. Give them a try!

Did not add blueberries and used blackberries from our yard.  Good flavor and moist.  Next time I'll add nuts to help mask the seeds.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious, hearty muffins. Didn't have wheat germ, so I used some flax seed. Sprinkled brown sugar, oatmeal and some butter on top for some yummy added sweetness. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Really disappointed in this one.  Used 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour and they turned out very sticky and flavourless. Is flavourless a real word? :) I guess it's mutually intelligible and that's what counts.  Anyway, not a keeper, will not be making these again.

I just 2 cups of pasty whole wheat flour and they are wonderful.  They must be eaten quickly or refrigerated as then will mold if left out on the counter.

Very good! I substituted the wheat germ with white flour, 2% milk for the half and half, and used only frozen blackberries for half of the batch and bannana and walnuts for the other half. Both came out moist very tasty!

I recommend adding vanilla and using 1/3 c brown sugar in addition to the white sugar. I made the recipe as is and they came out nice and moist but the flavor was a bit lacking. I will definitely make again though.

Oh my goodness very very good!  I made a lot of changes however.  I wanted to make blackberry muffins so I used a cup and a half of frozen blackberries.  Then I used a few spoonfuls of strawberry jam.  I used about a sixth of a cup less sugar.  Then I was going to use the 1 cup milk-1 cup yogurt substitute but Iinstead I used sour cream instead of yogurt.  I used oats instead of wheat germ.  And...I added some sliced almonds for texture.  And, finally, I added a hefty sprinkling of flax seed to the dry ingredients.  So I really changed the recipe but they came out amazing.  At the end before they were done I brushed the muffin tops with milk and sugar.  Got 12 Large muffins in the end.  I really packed them full.  The only problem was that Iused muffin cups and didn't butter them and the muffins really stick to the paper.  Next time I'll just butter the tray

I used all whole wheat flour, cut the sugar down to 1/3 of a cup and cut the baking powder down to a teaspoon and a half so it wouldn't overpower the muffin's flavor. I used "soured" fat free milk to cut back on the fat. I got a couple more than eighteen muffins, I got 23 medium sized muffins. These turned out really well, though mine were a bit wet. It could be because I picked my blackberries near the end of the season, you never know with blackberries. These smelled really well while they were baking and the family enjoyed them. Mine didn't turn out all that pretty, I think next time I might make a low-sugar streusel topping for the muffins. I think these would have made great whole grain blackberry pancakes.

What a yummy muffin! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand, but the original recipe would have been just as good.

these didn't work for me at all;  they were small and flat, the texture was a bit grainy, and they didn't taste of anything (not really sweet, not really savory, not much berry flavor)...i followed the directions precisely, but the outsides of the muffins were crispy and the insides were slightly doughy...won't do these again

I didn't have wheat germ on hand, so I used steel cut oats. I also didn't have half and half, so I used milk. I cut the milk by 1/4 cup and added oil to make up for the fat in the half and half.  Even with the changes, these were delicious and I would make them again in a heartbeat!

Followed the recipe exactly. They are o.k. but not great; not sweet enough and the texture is different than a traditional muffin which the kids don't like!

I'm sad I used our yummy berries from the farmer's market for these. They are missing something..the berries alone aren't enough to carry the muffins. I even added a teaspoon of vanilla but it didn't help. :(

I love these. the modifications I made: oat flour instead of AP; agave nectar instead of sugar; flax seeds instead of wheat germ; vanilla yogurt instead of half and half. love the mix of black and blueberries, their natural flavors take over. they're quite hearty muffins, but I'm a big fan of such things. very filling and nutritious!

My family enjoyed these very much!  I used 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar and I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Otherwise made as written and they had a lovely taste.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much we liked them!  Great little muffin!

I used all wheat flour w/ a little extra baking powder, all blackberries, and brown sugar instead of white. I added extra cinnamon and a little vanila extract. I didn't have half and half so I used a sugar free hazelnut coffee creamer and skim milk (1/2 of each). Next time I may reduce the liquid and use less creamer to more milk because the finished product came out w/ the bottoms kind of soggy...but they still taste great and this is a great way to use up all of my fresh berries! Thanks for the recipe!

Overall this is a great muffin recipe.  I think the proportions are off on the liquid, so I will reduce the half/half by 1/2 cup next time.  Lemon zest was added for more flavor - lemon always goes well with berries.  These muffins did not come out of the tin easily.  Next time I will let them sit for a few minutes after taking them out of the oven.  We will definitely make these again.  It's nice to find a muffin recipe using whole grains.

I made these a long time ago and apparently overlooked reviewing them.  I thought these were very good.  I used yogurt and milk instead of half and half, and ended up with more than 18 muffins, but I also didn't fill the cups very full.  I froze some for lunches and they seem fine after freezing as well.  thanks for the recipe!

Not very sweet, and the muffins stuck to the muffin liners, so that was kind of annoying. Still tasted good though.

I made 12 of these muffins with all white flour and blueberries and they turned out pretty good. My family ate them all in one day!

The taste is good but they are pretty small. Next time I will make only 12 muffins and cook them longer.

The blackberries really add a lot of moisture & make up for the fact that there is so much wheat in them. So delicious. Great for breakfast or to snack on at any time of day.

They did not rise which could have been the fault of my very old oven. but the bluemold look to them I have no idea how that could have been!! I only used Black Berries because I didn't have blueberries. Won't do this one again!!

Made these this morning. 
I doubled the blueberries since I didnt have blackberries on hand and they came out great. My 14 month old and my 3 year old keep asking for more.

Anyone who's seen any of my reviews knows I can almost never 'just' follow a recipe and this was no different. LOL
We aren't strict keto people (I can't quit baking!) ,  but we try, so in that spirit.... I used 1c whole wheat flour, 1/2c white flour, 1/2c brown rice flour, 1/3c almond flour + 1/4c flax seed (don't have wheat germ). 
I substituted erythritol for 1/2 the sugar and used 1c cashew milk and 1c whipping cream. Also mixed in 1t of almond extract and 1T pumpkin pie spice.  They were very moist and tasty with plenty of juicy berries!
PS We keep blackberries in the freezer, so I always smash them up a bit with a rolling pin before stirring them in - the ones we have are huge

So far not a fan.  I used 1 cup of buttermilk in place of 1 cup of half and half.  I like using buttermilk in my baking.  The muffins are very moist and since I used paper liners they are stuck hideously which is my fault for not following the directions there.  However overall I don't find the muffin appealing.

My kids gobbled these up. I made mini muffins for breakfast. I used alterations like others. Milk and yogurt for the cream  and I used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour. The cinnamon adds a great taste!  Great healthy recipe!

These were pretty good. I didn't have half&half so I used part skim milk and part vanilla yogurt. I think they would be better with the half&half b/c mine seemed like they needed a little "fat" in them! Very good though for a healthy muffin!

These muffins taste good, and are very easy to make, and healthful because of the wheat germ and whole wheat flour. They also freeze well, and taste just as good a few months later.

These were pretty tasty, although I could stand for them to be a little sweeter (maybe a crumb topping would do it). The girls at work all liked them, and I even made them a bit healthier using fat free half n half. My berries were frozen, which might account for them needing to be baked for nearly 30 minutes before they were done, but they were worth it in the end. Tasty and good for you, what else could you want?

We found these to be bland.  I know they are healthy, but since they didn't get eaten I likely won't make them again.
