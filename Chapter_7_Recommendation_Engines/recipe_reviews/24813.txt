I didn't have the different types of cabbage so I used the pre-shredded cabbage/carrot mix from the store.  Fantastic recipe!

HINT:  to prevent over watery slaw, place the cabbage in a strainer and coat/toss with plenty of salt.  Put the strainer on top of a bowl and let it sit for about an hour.  You will see all the excess water in the bowl from the cabbage.  RINSE IT WELL until the salt taste is gone.  Then mix rinsed cabbage with the other ingredients and let it sit over night.  The "empty" cabbage will then be able to soak up the flavors of the vinegar, honey and seasonings.  This will totally change your slaw taste.

This just wasn't for us.  We prefer the creamy coleslaw with more seasonings.

This is a very simple but tastey cole slaw recipe.  I made it even simpler but just using a bag of preshredded cabbage from the bagged salad aisle. It already had two colors of cabbage & carrots.  I shredded another carrot into it and still added the green onion & red pepper.  First time I made it, we felt it needed just a little extra something.  The second time I added a splash of lemon juice & a little extra salt to the dressing.  We liked it better that way.  But even as written, for as easy & quick as it was to put together, we enjoyed it.

I was surprised this didn't taste super sweet because of the amount of honey in it. But that's ok, I didn't really want a sweet dressing. I've been trying to duplicate a slaw they serve at our favorite Mexican restaurant, this isn't it but it's not bad.

I always thought I preferred the creamy type of coleslaw, but this has changed my mind.  Do try to make time to let it rest in the fridge for several hours (or even days) before eating, as it gets more flavorful the longer it sits.

Very nice.  I do add craisons to the mix to add a touch of sweet/tartness.

I tried it and I liked it :0) I omitted the bell peppers, added water chestnuts, and swapped the onions for leeks. Turns out, you can put what ever you want in it, the dressing is the key.

Since we do love our desserts, I’m always looking for ways to cut back on carbs and calories in other dishes.  I actually do prefer mayonnaise-based coleslaws, but this vinegar-based version was quite delicious. I liked the idea of a touch of honey but not the full amount called for, so I cut back on it considerably.   For additional color and flavor I added some chopped fresh dill. And, since the only seasoning called for was salt, some Penzey’s Fox Point Seasoning.

Hard to believe a coleslaw could be so good for you and delicious!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable, otherwise followed strictly.  This is now on my families faves list!

Such a beautiful, tasty slaw! I do like a little more zing in coleslaw so I added a teaspoon of dry mustard to my dressing. It was a hit at my lobster dinner!

AMAZING!  That coming from a household that hates conventional coleslaw.  I tweaked the recipe a bit - i didn't have green onion, switched orange pepper for the red, then added a package of cooked, crumbled bacon.  I also mixed in several tablespoons of Pampered Chef's Asian Seasoning.  I LOVE this recipe - and so did everyone I had for dinner.

I really loved this! I added some basil flavoured cottage cheese and turned it into a wholesome salad. Used purple cabbage and omitted the cucumber as I didn't have any on hand. Served it with barbecued chicken. The girlfriend loved it. :)

Loved the dressing.  So simple.  However, I did add more vinegar and a sprinkle of sugar.  I used one store bought bag of cole slaw mix and didn't use red cabbage.  I also added craisins and slivered almonds.  It was a hit and my father-in-law, who is a bit picky said it was pretty good.  Will make again.

Great taste and very filling.  Excellent snack for my weight loss program!  I used a little less honey the second time I made it used half apple cider vinegar and half rice vinegar.  I liked the flavor better.

YUMMY!  My hubby was confused because I have always made traditional coleslaw with mayo dressing (family recipe) but in an attempt to make it a little healthier, I searched for something new and found this!  Scaled down to 4 serving, I didn't change much. I used C.Gofron's tip about salting the cabbage and letting it sit to bring out the extra water and it seemed to work well.  Since I did that (even though I rinsed it well) I didn't add salt to the recipe.  I added a lot more carrot to make it more appealing to my girls.  The only other change I did was instead of the green onion (only called for 2.5 TBS scaled down and not worth buying a whole bunch) I used 1/4 of a shredded sweet onion... really good but maybe even a little less onion needed next time. Definitely a keeper summer recipe! Thanks.

I did alter this recipe quite a bit.  I used 1/2 red cabbage and 1/2 julienned collard greens.  Also, instead of green onions I used a small yellow onion and I omitted the red pepper simply because I did not have any on hand.  I added a dash of sesame oil, about 2 tbls hoisin sauce and some garlic powder.  Came out very good.  I suggest letting it sit in the fridge overnight before eating.  Also, I followed another reviewer's advice and sweated out the red cabbage with salt.

I love this recipe!  It is great to have a non-mayo based coleslaw.  We love to serve on top of salmon burgers with garlic aioli.  Yum!

Very tasty and nutritious, plus so easy to make.  To save time I bought a pre shredded bag of coleslaw mix and just added the green onions and bell pepper to that.  Also for you cilantro lovers out there this adds even more flavor.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is the first time I've ever made coleslaw and my husband almost ate the entire bowl by himself. This dish isn't too sweet or vinegar-like. No preservatives and I would consider this paleo! I'm adding this recipe to my personal cookbook!!

Unfortunately, this recipe's dressing didn't impress me well. Too spicy as too much pepper and weak vinegar taste seems not enough salt though. I would try "Angie's dad's coleslaw" next time. However, the vegetable combinations are good.
