This recipe sounded so strange yet had won first prize, I thought why not try it.  It was absolutely delicious.  The chicken had an equal combination of flavors and the salsa flavors just blended so nicely.  Our dinner club said this is definitely a keeper.  Now we know why this was chosen as a first prize winner.  Thanks Roxanne

I hate to write a bad review but this was terrible. Thank God I just made one serving for myself. I forced down three bites before I had to dump this out. It was so bitter and salty it was inedible. I followed the recipe exactly and can't believe this won first place in any contest. Salsa was ok. I am sorry Roxanne, but I will never make this again. Anyone else wanting to try this should seriously consider making one serving for themselves before preparing for anyone else. It has a very different taste.

I was not impressed with this dish.  The taste combinations are unique, they're not bad. However, the coating on the chicken is awful. I had to drench the chicken in salsa. I even ground the coffee beans another time for an extra fine texture. The salsa recipe is way off. I put in half as much onions and garlic, yet it was all I could taste. I had to add tomato paste and jarred salsa to tame it down a bit. I recommend using less garlic, onion, and avocado than suggested (note: I didn't add chocolate chips). This recipe is worth another try because the taste isn't bad, it just needs a few adjustments.

Quick & very Easy. Added more chicken & omitted the chocolate chips from salsa. Served with a bean & a green salad for a "meat & potato" crowd. Went over well.

Sorry, but this was just ok.  I thought the chocolate chips in the Salsa Mole did taste a little odd when you bit into them, but my family didn't think so.

Yum!  This was the best chicken recipe I've done.  My husband is pretty picky and he loved it!  I didn't have all the salsa ingredients, so I just added salsa I had on hand and it was great.  It wasn't really chocolatey just in case people worry it'll taste weird, especially without the chocolate chips.  Very good!

Great recipe.  We all enjoyed it and it's so easy.  Cook time of 20 minutes was plenty if you use 4-5 oz breasts.  Reduced the salt to 2 tsp.  Reduced the chocolate chips to 3 Tbsp.  Spooned the salsa over the chicken as soon as it came out of the oven, but even then had some unmelted chips.  Next time, I'll microwave the salsa for about 10 seconds and stir in the chocolate before serving for a more blended flavor.  Thanks, Roxanne.  It's fun to have such a simple version of this dish.

It was just okay.  The chicken turned out pretty good, but I didn't like the salsa.
