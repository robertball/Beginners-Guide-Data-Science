I changed the servings to 3 since there is only two of us.  Simple and easy to make.  The only different thing I would do next time is omit the peanuts. I did not particularly care for them in this recipe. Other than that both DH and I devoured them.

This is not something I would make again.  I followed the recipe  except I didn't stir them since I put it in individual serving dishes.  The peanuts just don't go with this combination in our house.

We love cinnamon rolls, but we weren't impressed with this recipe. It was a doughy mess and lacking in flavor. I used real butter, not margarine. Left out the peanuts because that addition sounded unappealing. This smelled really great while baking, and my kids were swarming to get some, but none of them finished their serving.

I substituted peanuts with pecans. Overall this was alright, but it's not anything I would repeat.
