Very good soup. The change I made was to cook the Barley separate from the soup. Drain & rinse it. If you add it directly to the soup it becomes gummy. The soup is plenty thick doing the Barley separate. I find the soup has more flavor to use chicken broth ( canned or fresh) for part or all of the broth. I also add some garlic 1 or 2 cloves, minced). Yum.      mini  from Fl.

The recipe is wonderful as written. It is easy; the ingredients are inexpensive; it is nutritious. The barley is a welcome change to the usual rice or noodles used in chicken soup.  What makes it a 5 star for me is you can easily make minor modifications to suit your own personal tastes using available ingredients that don't totally change the basic recipe. I did use store bought chicken stock to save time.  I used boneless chicken breasts, cubed and browned in my soup pot briefly in 1T olive oil, added the veggies, including sliced fresh mushrooms & some minced garlic, and sautéed everything for about 5 minutes, then added the broth and the rest of the ingredients and simmered as directed. The recipe seasonings were perfect for us. Fifteen minutes before it was done, I added about 1 c. of coarsely chopped fresh baby spinach leaves with the stems removed. Served it with warm, crusty bread and a green salad. Everyone loved it.  Some family members added freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Leftovers were lunch the next day.

Tasty and simple!  The only ingredient changes I made were to leave out celery because my husband won't eat it (used celery salt instead) and to add garlic powder.  Other than that, I left this recipe alone.  Yummy!

Fantastic contribution to my repetoire.  Dishes like this have helped me lose 30 lbs. (so far!).

A trick I used was to cook extra batches of celery in the broth.  Raw veggies are hard to take all the time, but the cooked celery will be my "nibblers" in the evening.
Barley has been proven to be nearly as good for heart as oatmeal, so extra bonus.  Rice or noodles spike my blood sugar, barley does not.
This recipe is award worthy as comfort food that is low fat, but does not leave one feeling deprived.

This is perfect comfort food on this cold, snowy day.  I didn’t have any chicken thighs but had a chicken breast, so I actually started at step 4 of the recipe using my homemade chicken broth.  I put everything but the chicken breast in a crock pot on the low setting early in the day.  An hour before dinner, I added the sliced chicken breast.  Just before dinner, I shredded the now cooked chicken breast and added it back into the soup.  Easy, easy, easy and very satisfying.

Working on the recipe right now, and realized that the forgot to tell you to put the chicken back in the soup.  So far fairly simple recipe and the house smells good, but my kids are a tough to please... Carrots, celery and onions are hard for them to swallow.  Yum, more for me and my husband.

Great recipe!  I used a whole roasting chicken so had a lot of meat for the soup. I used about 9 cups of water and a can of low sodium chicken broth.  I added some hot pepper flakes too.

This soup is very very good! I followed the tip of cooking the barley separately and then rinsing and adding it to the soup. It does make a difference if you want to get rid of the starch which will otherwise make the soup gooey. Since I like chicken soups to have a bit of oregano y added it close to the end of the cooking process to avoid it getting bitter. The smell is soo good and the taste very,very good! This is a keeper!

This is one of my go-to chicken stock recipes after we roast a chicken. I boil the bones and any left overs then use the stock and this recipe. Sage is the key ingredient. It is a warm herb that reminds me of Christmas.

Very delicious! Used chicken broth and boneless/skinless chicken thighs.  Also followed reviewer suggestions to  cook the barley separately.  Omitted the lemon juice and added a minced garlic clove.  Such an easy recipe and just as yummy the next day!

Very good. changes: I put every thing in the pot and cooked, I did not let it cool and skim, I just cooked it all together, also I added about 2 tsp of ground thyme and a small bush of fresh dried thyme leaves (Love thyme) and a dash of herb de provence. Salted to taste per bowl.

We made this with over 5 pounds of chicken, 1 cup of barley, sliced mushrooms, and added red pepper flakes to the spices. Also added some fresh spinach and grated parmesan at the very end.  Wonderful thickness and perfect spices -- was one of the best chicken soups we've ever had. I dreamt about the soup!

This was my first time making chicken soup, but this recipe turned out very well! I added a can of black beans to add some flavor and color. The barley made it a nice hearty soup.

Turned out great! My mom loved it, she was the one who inspired me to make this style. I added the chicken last minute back into the soup after removing from the broth, and checked the veggies after 60 minutes. Both veggies and barley was perfectly cooked. Chicken was perfect and tender, glad I didn’t put it back in the soup with the veggies!

This was a first time to make this and I threw it all in the crockpot including barley and let cook for 5 hours.  My chicken and veggies were frozen.  It turned out really well.  We added tabasco sauce once in the bowl.  It was a nice addition.  Perfect for a meal after over indulging for the last few days of Thanksgiving and today busy putting up Christmas decorations.  It was great to come into the kitchen at dinner time and have this ready!

my family thought this was delicious. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly. My only changes were that I used chicken stock because that's what I had and I added mushrooms bc we love them. o thought about making the barley ahead of time like reviewers suggested, but decided not to and it turned out great. don't waste your time making it before (unless you use instant barley).

This was the best home made Ck. soup that I've made in many years. I only added a can of cream of ck. soup and 1/2 tsp. of poultry seasoning and, BAMM, it was good.

We enjoyed this soup and the only change I made was to add garlic.  The barley in the chicken soup was a nice change.  I have never added poultry season to my broth before and really liked the added flavor it gave  to the soup. I will make this soup again.

Excellent!  I made this with chicken breast and added some mushrooms and followed the recipe as written.  I put it all in the crock pot.  Amazing flavor and very easy.  This is a keeper!

Delicious! My family raved over this tasty soup. Perfectly seasoned with lots of chicken and vegetables, it was perfect for this February night. I did use boneless breasts rather than thighs.

This was pretty good and simple to make, without any really expensive ingredients.  I don't care much for celery so I used extra carrots in its place and added a little celery seed to the soup instead.

Made this exactly as written, except I used celery salt, because I didn't have any celery.  It was delicious!  I swear it even tasted better the next day!  I'll definitely be making this again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!

I enjoyed this soup with one substitution of 2 cartons of organic chicken broth for the water and the addition of fresh chopped spinach simply because I needed to use it. It was delicious!

A nice addition to my soup file. I used boneless chicken breast and browned it and the onions, carrots and celery. I always have chicken and vegetable broth on hand for soup and sauce recipes. I used the seasonings in the ingredient list and added a little chopped spinach for some greens.
This is a keeper!

Delicious! I followed the recipe directions with a few changes/additions. I omitted the carrots, minced the celery and shallot, added 4 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp Herbes de Provence, 1 teaspoon turkey seasoning, chicken stock in place of water, 1 extra tsp of turkey bullion, 1 pack of lardons/pancetta which I cooked with the chicken. At the start, I also seared the chicken for 5 mins in 2 tbsp canola/olive oil before adding the stock. Added fresh chopped italian parsley, 1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan at end and a dash of cream.

I did change recipe from original a bit. I wanted chicken breads so I cubed and boiled in broth/stock  for 10 min . Ran out of bay leaves. Instead of boullion cube I added 1 tablespoon of soup base (better than bouillon).  Really delicious.

This is really a terrific recipe.. I decided to make a regular soup instead of a low fat recipe.

I used one large chicken breast, and threw the skin back in.

Added red pepper flakes to improve flavor

Used apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice.

I had to add another two cups of water while cooking to keep it soupy.

Really good.  I didn't add the lemon juice. For the water I used a box of chicken broth and 4 cups of water.  For the chicken I used boneless skinless leg thigh.  Two chicken flavour cubes.  It was awesome. Will cook this again soon.

I made this soup for a group at church and they loved it.  They asked for the recipe.  I did ad more barley but I like a thicker soup anyway.  This was the first time I have cooked with barley.  I can see where you can have a lot of fun with this soup.  Will make it again.

Really good soup and I love to eat this soup with barley instead of the traditional noodles! I also cook the barley separate like everyone else recommends so the barley does not become too gummy. Otherwise, I follow the directions as written.  For an extra kick, I throw some spinach on top when everything is done cooking to give it an additional nutritional boost. My husband loves it as well and he is a very picky eater

This was a solid recipe to make adjustments to based on your tastes.  I pretty much followed it to a T but when I was tasting it near the end I started throwing in a little more of this and a little more of that in terms of various seasonings to get it to my liking.  I kept the barley separate as others advised which made for a nice, brothy soup.  It would have been too bland for me had I not added in the extra spices but otherwise a nice base!

Great soup! I used a chicken breast instead of thighs, and added a couple of bouillon cubes for a richer broth.

I have made this several times and it has become a "staple." Changes I have made: reduced barley to just over 1/2 cup, used part chicken breast part thighs (thighs with bone do give best flavor to broth), use at least 4 c chicken broth, and add about 1/2 c-1 cup frozen peas toward the end. I hate to take the time to cool and skim the fat, so if there is much, I just "skim" either with a spoon and/or put into measuring cup that allows you to pour out just the broth. I like the thickness the barley adds to the broth.

I exchanged the barley for noodles, added a few garlic cloves, whole allspice and squash, and a bit of parsley at the end. It was very good. My girls (8 and 3) had seconds- and they are picky eaters.

This one is a keeper. I used chicken broth instead of water and like half pound of chicken breast. I did not have poultry seasoning so I didn't use any. The rest I kept it the same, soup turn out very good! My husband and 2 years old daughter loved it.

Fantastic for soup in a pinch. Used chicken stock instead of water and boullion. Definitely agree with other reviews, need to cook barley separate then add to. So good!

Delicious.  Used skinless boneless chicken thighs which makes preparation easier.
