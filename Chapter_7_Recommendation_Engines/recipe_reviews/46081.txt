This will be a definite winner, if you make a few changes - very easy:  - use cubanelle green peppers - they provide the most flavor and this is the type of pepper we have and always use in Russia  - instead of chopping, slice the onions and peppers  - this will provide for a better flavor and nicer texture - put sliced onions, pepper and dill (may increase to 2 tsp ) into a salad bowl, put salt (1/2 tsp or to taste) and, with your hands, mix them together, lightly pressing on the vegetables in order for them to give a little juice - but do not press too much so that they don't lose their firmness - this step is the key, actually! Once that is done, add chopped tomatoes with all the juice. I usually take tomato in one hand and cut off small slices right above the salad bowl (do not lose the juice and seeds!).  - After that you can actually go 2 ways: either add 2 tablespoonfuls of sour cream (together with the vegetable juices you've got in the bowl it will make plenty of dressing) or you can add 2 tablespoons of oil (canola, vegetable, but not olive oil). You may add some lemon juice to taste to the oil version. Both salads (with either oil or sour cream) are awesome if done this way. Please try!

This is one of my favourite salads. Though I don't use red pepper. I do this simply with tomatoes, cucumbers and onions. And some herbs. It can also be done with mayonnaise. For a quick salad I cut up one cucumber, one tomato, one onion, add some herbs and about a big spoonful of sour cream or mayonnaise and mix it up. You'll be able to tell. It should be mixed the same as something like tuna salad or potato salad.

In Russia, we put chopped up cucumber instead of bell pepper in this salad. Also, a cup of sour cream is too much! That would make it too runny. Put enough to coat all vegetables. And add salt and pepper to taste. Its better that way.

This was spectacular! My Russian dinner guest found it authentic. I used Green, orange & yellow pepper. I cut the pepper quantity in half. I used extra dill.  I barely cut the sour cream quantity. This chilled in refrig 3 hours.  We enjoyed it tremendously. It served 8 even though I cut the portion of peppers.  We loved it and will make it again! We had it with Roast Leg of Lamb with Artichokes and Russian Salmon and Potato Salad. A wonderful combo. My first intro into Russian cooking and now I'm excited to do more!

This was a great way to get rid of some tomatoes and peppers from the garden, but it needed a little something.  It tasted better the next day after the flavors had time to blend.

This was not a hit in the house but I won't mind finishing the leftovers.  It needs something; like a pinch of Parmesan Cheese on top of each serving.  Too runny for me, needs a thicker consistency, especially when using a dilly sour cream.

YUM! This was so good and light...the only thing that I changed was I added a tsp of chopped garlic...the only seasoning needed then was salt, pepper, and dill!

My family loves Russian Salad of any kind.  In fact we have been making it for years and throw in any ingredients that are handy.  We used pomegranate seeds once and the salad looked so beautiful it was a shame to eat it.  As far as we are concerned anything goes with or into Russian salad!

This was rather bland. I added salt and pepper, but it needed something else. I halved the sour cream and it still seemed too heavy for the dish. On the flip side, I liked eating a ton of veggies. It just took forever to slice them all paper thin for the pretty presentation. I probably won't make this again.

It was good, and definiitely fresh tasting, but as made, it lacked some seasoning and was a bit blander than I remember eating in Russia.

It was certainly a quick and easy salad, but the taste was overpowered with onion and pepper. I used 3 tomatoes instead of 2 because the ones I had were small, however, the tomatoes were barely noticeable with such great quantities of green pepper and onion.  I will try this salad again, but will likely double the amount of tomatoes, cut the portion of onions in half, and probably use just 2 peppers.  As a side note, I served this salad at a party and the sour cream did not hold up well without being refrigerated for several hours. It became more runny the longer it sat on the table. Living in Russia, however, I used Russian sour cream (smetana) and it is a bit different than American sour cream.

Good, fast, summery salad. Easy to make and forget about it until the salad is ready to serve. One suggestion is to add a cucumber and a bit more in the way of salt and pepper.

Tried this because I needed a side dish for russian beef stroganoff, but was disappointed. Way too much sour cream to be tasty--and I like sour cream. It was not a solid side dish. I will not make again.

This recipe called for too much onion. I only used one and the taste was still overwhelming.
