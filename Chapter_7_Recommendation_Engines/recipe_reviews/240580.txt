I had a larger avocado so I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup. I also used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.  I wanted my kids to eat these and I was afraid the color would turn them off since they know I add wheat flour to other baked goods so I added 1/2 cup cocoa powder. It worked they loved them.

IS THERE AVOCADO  IN THESE?? Wow, Couldn't even taste it! I used a gluten-free baking mix in place of the all-purpose so my mom could eat these. Fabulous, just stunning!

I wasn’t sure about this recipe but was intrigued and I had two ripe, needing to be used, avocados. The taste was great.  The only change I made was to use a brown sugar/ stevia mix to replace the white sugar and the brown sugar that was called for in the recipe.  Very tasty, easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly except for substituting 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of part of the all purpose flour.  These were great and we couldn't stop eating them.
