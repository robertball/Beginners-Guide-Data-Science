Wanted to try something other than cajun or teriyaki salmon. It's the first one I found but came out great!

Pretty good! I only used 2 fillets with the same amount of sauce and it was the perfect amount. Served with rice and steamed veggies.

I make salmon a lot and am always on the lookout for new ways to prepare it.  I thought this was pretty good.  Not outstanding, but something I'll probably make again.  I liked that it had a nice mixture of slightly sweet and spicy.  My husband, not a big salmon fan, said that it's "not bad".   Thanks for a new idea for salmon.  And it's SO EASY to prepare!  Loved that.

Everyone who tried this LOVED it. I used 3/4 cup of Sweet Thai Chili Sauce because i love to mix my sides in the sauce. It came out great and was so quick! For non-seafood lovers, I made the same sauce and put it over chicken. It was great that way too, but i enjoyed the salmon more!

The recipe was just what I was looking for, but I goofed.  Instead of having Sweet Thai Chili Sauce like I thought I did, I had Garlic Pepper Chili Sauce.  I went ahead and followed through on the recipe using this different sauce but in order to compensate for the heat, I added about 1/4 cup honey.  I cooked it a bit longer, too, but it still came out yummy... hot, but yummy.

Was pretty tasty - really enjoyed the Sweet Thai Chili Sauce (can't wait to use it on chicken).
