Yikes. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because we did eat it instead of going out to dinner but it was a close call. It was very gray flat and smooshy. The rice crispies just vanished into starch.

Very good! I made this with puffed wheat instead of rice crispies because it's what I had and it was very tasty. I'm deducting one star because it looks a little gross and it doesn't make a lot.

This recipe was very disappointing. It had the texture of mush. The only thing that made it edible was adding cheese and hot sauce to mask the flavor.

I make this quite a bit but use rice noodles instead of rice crispies. Good comfort food.

Doesn't make much of a meal.
