I added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 3 pieces of bacon cooked and crumbled and it was fantastic.

Followed other reviewers advise and added 1/2 cup Chicken Broth, and one 14+ oz. can of Petite diced Tomatoes. This made a wonderful side dish. The wife loved it. It's definately a keeper.

I took hints from other reviews and added 3 slices of bacon. I had soaked my black eyed peas over night and added 2 cups of chicken broth to the mixture.  I also added 1 teaspoon of fresh chopped jalapeno and generous amounts of black pepper.  I boiled for 5 minutes, then reduced heat for the remaining 25 minutes covered. This is delicious, not the original recipe, but very tasty!

This was very good.  Take the advice of others and use some chicken broth.  Adds much more flavor.

I did as another suggested and used the chicken broth also. I had 1 1/2 slices of cooked bacon to put in as well. Delicious!

Light & easy side dish.  Good for bean-fanatics & not-so-crazy about them eaters as well.  Just adjust to your tastes for onion and jalapeno.

I've been trying to keep things vegetarian and not add meat for flavor.  So I sauteed the onion in 1 T. olive oil and 1/4 t. garlic salt for about five minutes before adding the beans and jalapeno pepper.  It was fabulous and I'll be putting this on my regular side dish rotation.

Okay but not great.  I had hoped it would have more flavor than it did.  I will try making it again though.

I used fresh black eyed peas instead of canned. I wasn't very impressed with this recipe although my boyfriend said it was good. (I think he was lying). It seemed kindof bland but I might try it again with canned peas.

I used frozen black-eyed peas cooked in vegetable broth for 30 minutes with a little chopped ham thrown in, then I followed the recipe as given (I only had dried red peppers), adjusting liquid as needed. We try to cut back on meat, so I'll give it a try without ham or bacon next time. This is a delicious side, but with a salad and cornbread it would make a meal for us.

Perfect for January 1st.  Itâ€™s part of the New Year tradition around here.  Will be served with cornmeal muffins and green vegetables.  

I added some garlic powder & cayenne pepper to nip it up a notch.

Awesome. I made some alterations mainly because that's what I had on hand. Use chicken broth, 1/2  lb bacon. I did soak the peas overnight. You do have to like spicy and a little heat to enjoy this. Probably not for children.
