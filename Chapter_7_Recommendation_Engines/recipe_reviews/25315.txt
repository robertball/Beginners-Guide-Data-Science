I can't rate this because I changed way too much from the recipe.  Like others who've rated the recipe, I find polenta to be very bland. So while cooking it for this recipe, I added to the water-cornmeal mixture: salt, pepper, minced garlic, ground cumin, whole cumin seeds that I'd toasted in a pan, chile powder, and onion powder.  In addition to the mushroom topping in this recipe, I also had a pico de gallo-style topping, and a garlic onion tomato sauce topping. I made a pile of lightly-steamed spinach in the center of each plate, placed several polenta slices on the spinach and garnished them only with a little coarse pepper and salt, and some sprigs of cilantro.  Then I made small piles of each type of topping in an array around the polenta so that toppings could be added as prefered by the consumer.  This went over really well and got rave reviews - the first time we've had polenta and liked it!

This recipe worked great when I doubled it to make 8 servings.  I also used some Shittake mushrooms which brought a rich flavor to the sauce.  Another tip, it was difficult to transfer the cut polenta from the wax paper since I accidentally cut through the wax paper when I was slicing the squares.  The waxpaper stuck to the polenta.  So I just lifted it with teh wax paper and flipped it over when I put it on the baking sheet and then peeled off the wax paper.  This worked well for me.  This is a savory recipe.

I liked the simplicity of this meal.  The polenta may be used as appetizers.  Broiling the polenta until browned gave it an oily flavor which was similar to fried tortilla chips.  Baking lightly gave a great flavor.

This came out pretty good but I did make a few changes of my own. I sauteed the mushrooms, onions,garlic and added a couple slashes of white wine and some fresh spinach at the end. When the spinach wilted i topped the fried polenta. I enjoyed this and will probably make it again.

So great.  My polenta hating husband even loved it, plus it was easy and fast!!  I did make some minor changes...I used green onions instead of white ones, sprinkled each polenta blob with balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese and broiled for 6 minutes...but thats all.  Really devine, wished I had made more. Will add to rotation.

Overall a good recipe and for sure a do again.  I used a sifter to add the cornmeal to the water so that it would not lump, added about 1/2 cup parmesian and some fresh basil to the polenta before I spread it.  The mushroom topping was great as is, but next time I may add 1 tbs of butter or splash of white wine right at the end to make it more of a sauce.

I agree - the recipe as written is bland.  I added some feta cheese which helped but I would not make it again.

This was good, but not outstanding, and also a fair of work.  It also doesn't hold well.  If I ever make it again, I'd probably add some parmesan to the polenta.  I think that would help fight the blandness a lot of us seem to be noticing.  I do like the idea of using the polenta shapes almost as a cracker, and may try some other toppings in the future.

The polenta is not very tasty like in some restaurants when I have had it.  But the mushrooms or whatever you put on top will make it better.

Now I remember why I hate making polenta.  And this polenta was very boring. The mushrooms were okay, perhaps a little dry for serving over polenta. I will NOT make this again.

I was surprised someone said the polenta was bland - we found it incredibly peppery. Once I tried that, I cut waaay back on the basil for the vegetables!

Although my husband really liked this, I did not.  I had an aborted attempt on the Polenta and had to find another recipe in a cookbook to make it come out right.  It also got stuck to the wax paper.  The mushrooms were a bit bland.  I probably will not make this again.

This was ok.  I would not make it again, but my mom enjoyed it, so that is why I gave it three stars.

I use large portabella mushrooms and roast red bell peppers and basil to top for a main meal.  A balsamic/agave reduction is not only beautiful but adds a great flavor.
