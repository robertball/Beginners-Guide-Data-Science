Fabulous. I made this exactly as written except that I added 8T butter (1 stick total) instead of 10T. The sauce thickens beautifully if you follow the directions. Excellent flavor. I used this with an appetizer of seared tenderloin and balsamic cipolline onions. It was so good I feel like cussing. Thanks for the recipe! :)

Used this as a fondue dipping sauce and it was excellent.  Doesn't rewarm well though, needs to be made just prior to serving.

This is fabulous!  I only ended up using about 4 T. Butter (yes, must be butter!) and it was great.   Use really good wine and you will have a killer sauce.  Fabulous.

This is very yummy--this coming from someone who not only loves balsamic vinegar but also sweet things.  I do think that I would cut down on the honey--maybe in half--and a little of the butter.  This would be good with pork or chicken, and I would especially love it with sticky rice (calrose).  It is a sweet alternative to teriyaki sauce as far as dipping sauces go.

We've made this three times in the past month. Absolutely delicious, and I wouldn't change a thing. We serve the sauce in little bowls for dipping.

This is an excellent sauce, but I don't feel it needs all of that butter.  I halve the butter and it is still very rich.  The first time I made it, I used the full amount and it was just overkill.  Too rich to actually enjoy.  So, wonderful sauce, just go easy (well, easier) on the butter.

This sauce is incredible.  A must try for all steak lovers. Everything on my plate was dipped in the sauce at some point during dinner, it's that good! I followed the instructions exactly except I added 8 tablespoons of butter instead of 10.  I think I might marinade my steaks in this sauce next time.

I didn't change a thing, but I did guess on measurements and quadrupled the recipe. The simmering is important, it gets better over time. Thanks so much!

This was quite good. My Husband & I went to a nice steakhouse for our anniversary & I was trying to mimick a goat cheese merlot butter I had on my filet. So, I used this as an example. I put thin sliced of goat cheese on top of the steak right after it came of the grill and topped with this sauce. Next time, I would use less balsamic vinegar b/c it was a little sweeter than I like, but overall this was really yummy and worth a try!

This was delicious!  I made the sauce as directed but used 2 tbsp honey not the four.  I was nervous it would be too sweet if I did.  Two was just right for our taste.  I did add some black pepper and a dash of crushed red because we like a bit of heat.  I had sauteed mushrooms and onions that I added to the last few minutes of cooking time.  Served over a grilled steak.  I was concerned as the aroma was heavy on the vinegar but it mellowed as it cooked.  Everyone enjoyed the sauce and wiped the plate with bread to get the last bit!

I really wanted to love this! Before adding all the butter, I took part of it out and added the ratio of butter and it just seemed to be overpowered with Balsamic (and I used a nice grade Balsamic). So, I added about 3/4 cup more wine and let it simmer another 20-30 minutes and added the butter. That did it!! I was very happy with it and would make it again with that change!

I give this five stars because even with half the honey and a third of the butter this was really..REALLY good.  We used it to dip our rubbed and roasted ribs (CCRyder's Smoker Rib Rub).

Very well received by our guests.  Used cab sauvignon instead of merlot as that was what I had handy.  I would prefer to use a bit more garlic next time, and also add a bit of fresh rosemary and thyme

EXCELLENT!  Just made this for grilled sirloins and had rave reviews.  Will definitely be making again soon.  I always use more garlic in every recipe I make.  I halved the recipe and used 3 teaspoons of honey and it was perfect.

This is good stuff. I prefer it with half the amount of butter, another splash of soy sauce and 1/2 tsp of pepper. It is a great braising liquid for beef.

This was so good.  We had this for our Dinner Club feeding 16 people and I love the way you can adjust the recipe based on amount needed.  Everyone that had it loved it.

It wasn't for me, I did everything exactly, maybe I didn't boil long enough? It's my first time using the balsamic, maybe if I new what a dash of soy sauce was? Maybe someone has some pointers?

Fantastic sauce, I added just a little bit of ground black pepper for a little more flavor, I used the sauce drizzled over some t-bone steaks, and it tasted amazing!

This is a very good dipping sauce. I've used it with everything from pork to chicken wings. If you don't have a Merlot don't be afraid to use a Cabernet. Use a good Merlot or Cabernet. That way you can enjoy a glass while cooking.

This sauce is rich, sweet, tangy and delicious!  I did not need to cook it but about 15 minutes before it was reduced A LOT.  I served this with a grilled ribeye steak.  Perfect!  Thanks!

This is the best wine reduction sauce EVER.  I use cabernet because it's my personal preference, but keep everything else the same.  Strain out the garlic before adding the butter for a smoother sauce.  Beautiful!

This was delicious.  I used more soy than called for because it needed to be saltier.  Also, next time, I would cut down on the honey a bit.  When this cooks down the balsamic gets sweeter, so less honey is definitely needed.

This is amazing.... perfect way to accent a fillet. Made it on Christmas day and people were blown away. Highly recommend.

I made this and served it with grilled NY strip steaks.  I made half the recipe and simmered for 20 minutes.  I couldn’t bring myself to add 5 T. (for half the recipe) of butter, but did add 3 T.  I made this early in the afternoon and once cooled, I refrigerated it and then gently reheated it before serving.  This was good, but not our favorite.

Excellent sauce.  I also wanted to be a little healthier and used half the butter and added some cornstarch to help thicken.  We still loved it!

I liked this approach, but I think the wine I chose wasn't as good as it needed to be.  We liked it, but I would have liked it to be a little less piquant.  I used just one stick of butter and half the honey, as some reviewers recommended.  I will try it again, but with better wine and exactly as written.  It is a fairly easy glaze and it was very good on our grilled chicken and veggies.

I will definitely make this again.  It is a simple recipe that complemented my filet mignon with goat cheese crumbles very well.  I doubled the recipe and quadrupled the amount of merlot.  It was well received by everyone.

I made this for the second time this evening and it was as good as the first time. I had been wanting to try this sauce on something other than beef so, I made boneless pork chops, pan fried with rosemary, chives, salt and pepper. I drissled the sauce over the pork and it was as good as it was on beef. I served it with roasted asparagus wit salt and pepper and Parmesan cheese. It was awesome.

Like some others, I used less butter (about half), but what is really nice is that since you add it bit by bit you can taste often and figure out how much you want.  Otherwise, loved it on a steak, going to try some kind of roast pork tenderloin in the future.
