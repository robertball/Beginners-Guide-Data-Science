This was a very good dish. Simple, but pretty tasty for what it is. I made it exactly as written. I wasn't sure that the recipe really meant for the apples to be unpeeled (keep the peel on) instead of peeled (take the peel off), so I asked The Woman I Love, and we agreed that the apples should be peeled, so that's what I did. I used Golden Delicious apples, and they worked, but perhaps Granny Smith or another more baking-appropriate apple would be better. Also, I opted for red seedless grapes, to add some color to the dish. We ate the whole thing in one night - it made two not-very-big bowlfuls for each of us. I'll give it a 4-star rating, but The Woman I Love said she'd give it 5 stars, and she asked me to make this for her once a month. Thanks for a great recipe!

Tried this recipe and I have sort of a mixed review. Smelled good, tasted good, and was still good the next day. I served it over homeade ice cream. I was even asked for the recipe but it still needed something. But it smelled good and was a pretty good taste so I will give it 4 stars.

Quick and easy is right... and I keep all of this fruit on hand, so when my husband invited some friends at work home to dinner on short notice, this was a real lifesaver.  It capped off a dinner that I'd put together in 1 hr. flat...took this out of the oven and let it cool for just a few minutes and served with vanilla ice cream or raspberry sorbet... was a big hit

This recipe was pretty good. I didn't have any grapes on hand but it was ok. I added a little nutmeg, but I think that a crisp topping would have made it perfect. It was still a good recipe.

Really liked this, very simple and light.  I put the fruit in small serving dishes and tried it as is, and realized the one thing missing was brown sugar.  I added a VERY small sprinkle to each dish and it was perfect!  It all came together and the juice at the bottom was scrumptious!!!

A very simple and light but delicious treat. I used oranges instead of pineapples. Also, poured over a bit of blackberry/raspberry smoothie, just because I had some left. Served it hot with caramel/cinnamon icecream! Yummy!!!

This was okay. My husband and I found that it tasted like hot fruit salad. I think it's missing something. Not quite sure what it is. I would definitely cook it a bit longer than it says. My apples were still a bit crunchy.

1/8/16:  Morgan loved!  Used 4 apples, pineapple and blueberries since that is what I had.  Added a little lemon juice on top and a little sugar/cinnamon mix.   Put on top of shortbread cookies and ice cream on top.
8/28/16:  Morgan chose for her birthday dessert.  Was SO Yummy!  Used 4 apples-2green 2 red, blueberries and strawberries. Poured 1 cup of orange juice then sprinkled with sugar/cinnamon then added just cinnamon.  Baked as above.  Made a layered dessert of her choosing.  Bottom was a graham cracker crust from the recipe on the box. After baking that, poured the fruit on top, then put an oatmeal mix on top of the fruit.  Oatmeal mix: 2 C oats, 1 C brown sugar, 1/2 C flour, 1/4 C butter melted, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, mix all together.  Top layer was a regular Pillsbury pie crust.  Bake as directed on crust box, till golden brown.  Cool whip on top :)

I was out of town for a week and upon returning, realized I had a lot of fresh fruit that needed to be used.  Followed the recipe except I used fresh pineapple and sprinkled some brown sugar on top when serving.  Good, wouldn't say "wow," and it sort of reminded me of a warm fruit cocktail, and that's not to say that's a bad thing.

We did not care for it.  Tasted like it was missing something.  Only thing I did differently was add a can of sliced pears.  I liked the pears in it.  Just didn't taste very flavorful.  I may try adding the brown sugar as others mentioned.  Not likely to make again.

This had a good flavor but it was just okay.  I think the baked grapes seemed a little odd but If I make it again I'll serve it for breakfast with muffins.  A sprinkling of roasted nuts on top would be good.

Nice and quick to prepare and this dessert cooks while you are eating dinner.  Healthy and tasty and sweetened naturally by the fruits and juice although I should have used red grapes to provide a color contrast but overall a very nice change.  Somebody mentioned a crust topping and that would be nice but this is definitely a "lighter" dessert and a bit of ice cream or whipped topping can be added to spruce it up if desired.
