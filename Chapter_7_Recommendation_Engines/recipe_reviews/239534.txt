Simple and satisfying comfort food.  Great gravy.   I prepared this as the recipe directed with a couple of exceptions – I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic to the onions and mushrooms and used all beef broth, no water.  I don’t understand why the submitter instructs that you essentially dilute the gravy with water.  Use the 30 minute cooking time only as a guide – mine didn’t take nearly that long!

Tonight was second time I have made this. I love love love it!!!!! I did not change anything either time other than using 1.5-2 pds of meat (for a total of 8-9 patties) and doubling all the ingredients for enough gravy for the 8-9 patties. I always struggle with what sides go with what so I will do what I wish others would do and tell you I made Parmesan Roasted Potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and French bread with it. Yum yum!

I'm sure this recipe is great as tendered. I made a couple changes , I omitted fresh mushrooms and flour and substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup I used the whole 14.5 ounce can of beef stock . I also added a clove or two of chopped garlic to the meat.  overall it quickly became one of my favorite things to cook

This pattys were great but the broth was not. You have to adjust the broth to your taste. The gravy was bland so I added more Worcestershire (to taste or 1 table spoon), minced garlic (to taste 1 teaspoon), pepper, and sea salt. I did not use water but added 2 1/2 cups of low sodium beef broth instead. I served this with steam broccoli and twice baked potatoes.

Because I have growing teen boys I doubled this recipe. It wasn't great it was just ok. I was hoping for more depth of flavor. After browning it sure didn't take 30 minutes to cook thru, more like 10. I'm going to continue searching for other Salisbury steak recipes.

This is a great recipe. Like many others, I tweaked it a little as well: I used a "beefy onion soup" mix instead of regular onion soup mix. Also, I use golden mushroom soup in my recipes that call for gravy; I sauteed the mushrooms and onions as directed, then added that to the beef broth and soup mix, stirred in the golden mushroom soup, and voila - a really good, rich gravy (the flour is unnecessary). I've prepared this dish three times now and there are usually leftovers, but only if I make extra (it's that good!)

This recipe is excellent!!!  My husband doesn't care for mushrooms, so I omitted them. I used 1 large Vidalia onion and swanson's beef broth for the stock. The patties were tender and full of flavor, and the gravy was awesome. Best Salisbury steak My husband and I have ever had. Thanks for a great recipe. I'll be making this again and again for sure.

I just made Salisbury steak and this recipe is very similar to mine. The only difference is that I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, water instead of milk and freshly ground pepper. I also added a couple of tablespoons of ketchup. I rarely measure things when I cook and I had more than a pound of meat, but I probably used more Worcestershire sauce than what is called for here because of the addition of ketchup. For the gravy, I removed the patties to a plate after I browned them and used the same skillet that I browned the patties in, to brown the mushrooms and onions as I did not want to waste the yummy brown bits that add so much flavor to the gravy. I did not use the onion soup/water, I just used low sodium beef broth. I put the patties and gravy in a covered casserole dish and I finished mine in the oven. I had it at 350 degrees for about a half hour. Cooking times are going to vary depending on the size/thickness of your patties, the type of pan and the way your stove works, so I cannot rate any recipe according to whether or not it was done in the time stated, there are way too many variables. We're having the leftovers tonight!

We found this delicious! I'm glad I doubled it. The only change I made was the onion soup mix and beef stock. I used low-sodium stock which is what the recipe calls for, not broth, which adds a depth of flavor(and no water!). I made my own onion soup recipe from this site, contains NO sodium. I hate packaged/canned soup and have found wonderful recipes here on AllRecipes.com that taste fresh and chemical free.

Added garlic, quite tasty and way healthier than the TV Dinner version!  Kids enjoyed it.  I thought the meat had the most Salisbury Steak flavor, the gravy? I'd like to dress up a bit.  served with mash potato and peas/carrots.  I also used 2 T of Worsey Sauce because we are huge fans.

Thank you for this heavenly recipe.  I prepare it as written, have it memorized, and it is my family's THE go-to comfort food.  Mashed potatoes, noodles or rice..that is the only decision I have to make. Just make sure you have pickled beets to go along.

First if all you don’t need 2 pans!  Fry burgers, place on plate and start mushrooms in same pan.  I added 2 cloves of garlic with onion, broth no water.  Very good.

I like to chop about 1 bell pepper and add to gravy mix--sometimes, I put some in the meat mixture, also.  This adds that extra bit of flavor that some are missing.  I frequently also cut up an onion and add that to the gravy.   This has been a staple in my family for 50 years!!!!   Comfort food at its best!!!!

This was a family pleaser - and believe me, that's hard to do. I finely chopped the onions to slip them by the pickiest kiddo. We all wished for more gravy, so I'll increase the recipe for next time. Yummy!!

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe except for using all beef stock rather than using the water. It was excellent and quick and easy to make. My only regret is that I hadn't made this before.

Simple, hearty and satisfying.  I used sour cream instead of milk and instead of making the gravy, I  cooked some sliced mushrooms and used some leftover beef gravy that that had on hand. Perfect for a midweek meal.

This was pretty good with decent flavor.  I followed the recipe as written except that I didn't have panko bread crumbs, so I substituted Italian bread crumbs.  I served it over mashed potatoes.

I made this PRETTY much as written, but I do not use Onion Soup Mix (too much MSG) so I googled how to substitute it and it worked out great. Oh I also was out of eggs so I used 2 heaping tablespoons of Mayo which I also read was a great substitute for an egg.  I made the patties earlier in the day when I had more time which probably got the flavors more mixed in with the Ground Chuck (80/20). I took the Steaks out of the fridge to warm up a bit before setting them in the hot skillet. I fried the patties to a dark crisp brown on each side, then set them aside on a plate, drained MOST of the grease out but about a tablespoon and left all the bits of meaty flavor goodness in the pan to make the gravy in the same skillet. My patties were large so I did simmer them for 25-30 minutes in the gravy to cook through, and I added some jarred mushrooms when there was about 10 minutes left just to warm them in the gravy.  I served the Steaks with Mashed Potatoes (instant, so easy), and Brussel Sprouts, but corn would have been great too.  See my pic!  :-)

Perfect comfort food! Very easy and delicious!  I used a mix of mushrooms and it gave it a "dressed up" taste, I would definately do that again!  Honestly, this is good enough for company with a "diner" theme.

I was looking forward to this Salisbury Steak last night which was somewhat labor-intensive.  I was disappointed in that when it was served, it tasted exactly like a frozen TV dinner and not quite as good as a cheap diner's meal.  There is little taste other than a taste that is artificial, due (I presume) to the dry onion soup.  My husband and I were both very disappointed.

I made his for dinner and my husband and I loved it.  I only made one substitution.  I doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers, but I only had one package of onion soup mix and one beefy onion soup mix. So I used beefy onion soup in  the gravy.  It was great!  Is definitely a recipe we will make over an over again.

I modified the recipe and used real onions and skipped the onion soup mix in both the Salisbury meat mixture and the gravy. I cannot calculate how much sodium my rendition contained but the flavor was there.

Followed the recipe, no changes, and it was well-received in this house!  Good flavor and plenty of gravy for the mashed potatoes on the side.  Frozen green peas and butter bread made a weeknight dinner that I'll keep in the rotation!

I made this tonight for my husband and it was a big hit also did a side of basmati rice and Haricot verts.  My husband asked for seconds.   I did not change anything with this recipe and I am rating  this for the original recipe.   I did not have beef stock however I used beef broth.

Just made this tonight and I made some changes.  Used 2lbs of ground beef and pork, then just doubled the rest of the ingredients except the beef stock and water.  Which I am so glad I did because the gravy was the perfect consistency.  This is definitely a new item on our dinner menu

Will definitely make it again!  Very easy.  I did take one suggestion of mixing together the ingredients for the patties before adding it to the ground sirloin being careful to not over mix and make the patties too tough or hard.  They were perfect.  Thank you for this timeless classic.

My husband loved it!  I made this last weekend and he's already asking me to make again. The meatloaf ingredients and cooking instructions were not changed however, my husband insisted I simmer in my gravy recipe he has grown use to. It's looking like this is the Midwest Steak Recipe for me and my family!

I will be making this again. I did have a few changes that I made. I used reg. ground beef as I didn't have Sirloin. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of Panko. In the gravy mixture I added green bell peppers just for added flavor and to pack in more veggies. Husband loved it and said the meat was nice and tender. I served this over egg noodles.

This recipe was very easy and very flexible. I didn't have worcestershire sauce, so I substituted soy sauce, plus a little barbecue sauce and about a quarter cup of red wine. I also used leftover diced onions rather than slicing one. We really enjoyed the flavor of the gray. I served the steaks with cheesy mashed potatoes and a blue cheese and tomato salad. With just the two of us, we each eat one and half patties and are looking forward to eating the remaining ones as open face sandwiches or on buns for a lunch soon.

I made this for dinner tonight. My husband and the kids loved it. Their only complaint was that I didn't make enough. We had to run to a sports event, so I didn't simmer the patties in the pan for 30 minutes. Instead, I used the slow cooker to finish it off while we were at the game. I  made the patties and the gravy according to the recipe, placed the patties in the slow cooker, poured the gravy over it, and set the cooker on Low for an hour and a half. It turned out great.

this was absolutely delicious. the only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars is the lack of garlic.

Great but I tweaked too. Like another reviewer M. Burgess, I used golden mushroom soup instead of fresh mushrooms.

It is a fabulous recipe..my family raved about it and I will definitely make it in the future.  I don't eat red meat often... Probably less than once every 3-6 months.  Very tasty though

thought it was very very good. I doubled the recipe and separated the meat into 12 patties, cooked them over stovetop then transferred them to oven safe aluminum bakeware and topped with the sauce. has to make the sauce without mushrooms as hubby doesn't eat mushrooms (extremely picky eater)  and his only suggestion was to use less onion in the sauce. nevertheless, I thought it was a great recipe. will definitely make again. it was an awesome recipe to make ahead and freeze for later

I made a double batch, husband and 6y/o son loved it. Patties are great as is though a little salty I thought, but no one complained. My boys love meat, so I used 2# burger and made 6 thick patties on either egg noodles or mashed potatoes (picky eaters). Probably could have not straight doubled the soup mix and kept some for the sauce (I forgot about the mix going in the sauce). I edited the sauce due to family preferences and available ingredients. Sauteed diced onion and green pepper with garlic, then added cream of mush and 2 cans beef broth. As a normal cooking person can tell already, that didnt thicken well. Could have used flour, or just extra cool time; by the time I was putting away leftovers it was nice and thick. Flavor was fantastic, pretty well perfect. Everyone is full and I'm glad we have leftovers

This was delightful. Sooo good and super easy to make. Great recipe. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and added some flour and beef broth - really really really good. Next time will add some sautéed asparagus to the plate.

I will admit that I used 80% chuck instead of sirloin and used the grease to sub 2 tbsp of butter used to make the gravy. I also used the same pan to make the gravy as browning beef to save cleaning and because why not use that flavor? Aside from that everything was the same. This recipe is pretty good as written. I only give four stars because I found the onion flavor too prominent. Next time I will probably only use half an onion instead of a whole one but there will definitely be a next time. This makes a good dinner with not too much effort!

This is our new favorite.  I did make a few changes to suit our taste. We used ground venison and I used 2 onions (we love onions).  I cooked the onions to where they were close to being caramelized and added a bit of sugar (teaspoon).  Cooked per the directions and perfection!

I followed the recipe as written. My husband and my 91 year old father both enjoyed this dish. The onion soup added good flavor. My husband was a chef, said it had a good salisbury steak flavor. I want to make this for company next time. I'd say it's important to just brown the patties because they cook very nicely in the sauce, don't want to over cook them.

Very awesome. Easy to make. Prep time was good. I added a few things like garlic powder, minced onions, oregano and parsley. It all came together and tasted fantastic. It is going to be my comfort food of the future. I served with rice and veggies.

Excellent, but did make some changes other reviewers suggested:  Add a little garlic to the onions & mushrooms, substituted all beef broth/stock for the water and used just one skillet in order to get all the brown bits in the gravy.  Perfect!

I made this last week and my family loved it! I did read reviews and used the idea of using golden mushroom soup, instead of flour and water. I also used baby Bella mushrooms.  It was awesome. I served it with Basmati rice and broccoli. Big hit. Family wants it again next week. Thank you for such a yummy and easy recipe.

I followed the recipe as close as I could.
I didn't have Panko bread crumbs.
I used what I had.
They were delicious.
I used two pds of beef and adjusted it accordingly.
I froze most of them.
Had a guest on the 2nd day after making them.
They were delicious ??!
I made homemade mashed potatoes, served ??.
I sent home a frozen container.
I just ate another tonight.
Every which way was delicious!

This was absolutely delicious. Our grocery did not have the ground sirloin so he tenderized two round steaks. I then breaded them with the mixture and cooked on each side for about ten minutes on low before transferring to the gravy mix. I would make it this way again. It was so good!  I used Better than Boullion for the broth and was able to deepen the flavor. Loved this recipe!  My daughter stopped by and took a taste, she had her husband grab the recipe! He’s an amazing chef so this was an impressive dish. And! My finicky granddaughter loves it!

I made carmelized onions.
After I cooked the mushrooms, I removed them from the butter so I could cook the flour. Then I added the beef stock to thin the flour mixture before adding everything else in the pot, including the carmelized onions. I also added Kitchen Bouquet for a nice dark  brown color & cut the bread crumbs in half. 
It turned out wonderful!!

We enjoyed this variation immensely!  I'm the only one who likes mushrooms in our family, so I cut back on them. One other variation was to use sweet and spicy bread crumbs (by Progresso). It helped to further enhance the already good balance of flavors in there.

Made this exactly according to the recipe but it did not really taste  very good, could taste too much of the onion soup mix. It seemed like it needed to cook longer to mellow out the flavor profile.

I have made this recipe many times now.  It is always fantastic.  The only change I make is I only use 1/4 pkg. of onion soup mix in the meat mixture because my boys "don't like onions", but I don't want to leave out the flavor all together.  If I have ground pork I will use 2/3 sirloin and 1/3 ground pork - that adds good flavor as well.  This recipe makes a quick delicious dinner.

In addition to my last review, are used lots and lots of garlic and a whole onion. I always like to make extra gravy as it’s good on everything. My gravy also includes lots of mushrooms chopped up along with some sliced mushrooms put on top of the patties.

It was amazing!!!!  I have always wanted to make homemade Salisbury steaks.  I will use this recipe every time and teach my daughter how to make them as well.  My other half loved them and the gravy.  He doesn’t even care for gravy unless I make it from pan drippings.  So I was very excited to hear much he raved about the gravy.  So now he is going to want me to make this gravy anytime we have mashed potatoes.  The only thing I did not put in mine was mushrooms no one in my house likes them.  Defiantly a new favorite and it’s pretty easy to make as well.  Anyone thinking about trying it out I definitely would I think your family would be happy.

made no changes and will make it again, now in the line up for dinners. I do not like mushrooms but Hubby does and using fresh, they are easy to pick out . Could change next time around but is was great, very tasty and so filling. After browning, I cooked it for 20 minutes and it could have been less but had potatoes &  noodles cooking so meat stayed on.

My family really LOVED this.  The onion gravy really made a difference.  I use an onion soup mix that is bulk.  I used 1 T in the patties and 2 T in the gravy.  I also used 2 t Worcestershire sauce.  My family does not like mushrooms so I eliminated them, but it still made an excellent dinner.  I served mashed potatoes with the steaks..... to use up all that wonderful gravy!!

Fantastic! I browned it on the skillet, and cooked onions in a separate skillet. Then, I combined them in a baking dish and baked 350 for 30 min.

This is a terrific recipe with the exception that it is very salty (and I tend to like my foods on the salty side).  I would suggest making sure the stock, butter, etc.are lo sodium or salt free and do not add extra salt
before you taste it.  The only change I made was I used 85/15 ground meat vs. sirloin which is 80/20.  I will make this again.

I cannot honestly give a star rating as a couple of very minor changes were made, no mushrooms (but will add next time), and straight stock with no water to dilute the taste.
Let's just say, this will now be a go-to recipe for me.  a neighbor dropped over for dinner, and raved about it....even licked the gravy off the plate!!!!

12 31 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/239534/midwest-salisbury-steak/ ... This was a request from S.  For the first ten minutes of prep, I was absent - so had to start over.  With that, I didn't have all the ingredients - Okay, I did, but what was I going to do with a half envelope dry onion soup mix?! - Okay, I didn't have any mushrooms at all.  Okayyyyyy.  :)  So, these were good - quite comforty - filled the request.  I soaked the dry mix in the milk, used regular plain breadcrumbs.  Since I used ground beef, not sirloin, lots of grease to drain.  I faked the gravy with  only beef broth.  It was typical gravy, as expected.  For me, I won't make again - any recipe - but the addition of sherry in the gravy of this one  ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/78370/hamburger-steak-with-onions-and-gravy/ ... had my attention, too.  A little sherry & better grade of beef may make the difference, but I'm trying to get healthy so I may never know.  :D

My husband wanted to give it a 4 on principle because "there is always room for improvement". I say for myself that I  think it was wonderful! The only change I made was I added much more black pepper to the meat, a 1/2 t. We also only had regular ground beef on hand. We served it over egg noodles, though we will probably try mashed potatoes next time. Also I would say to people who have trouble with it being "bland" to always test for seasoning as you go. I'm of the mind set that you season every layer. I even added a pinch of salt and pepper when I cooked the onion and mushrooms. I hope this helps.

I read other reviews and made two changes; I used 2 1/2 cups of beef stock and omitted the water, and I added minced garlic to the meat patties mixture.  It turned out great; lots of flavor.  My husband kept talking about how good it was.  Totally a keeper.

I didn't have any dry onion mix or mushrooms on hand when I made this and it was AMAZING flavor!! Made up some mashed potatos to go with it and put the gravy on them also and my husband thoroughly enjoyed it too!! This is added to our regular rotation!

Family loved it.  I made a couple changes. My husband hunts and so I need find meals around deer meat.  So I tried this recipe.  I doubled the Worcester sauce and added @2 cloves of minced garlic to the meat and added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the gravy.  I did not have mushrooms.  So I omitted them.   But I will add them next time!

Oh my goodness...I cannot thank you enough for this recipe!! Last night was my 2nd time making this, and the only additional thing I did was add chopped onions and garlic to the meat mixture....my husband was the happiest man in the world last night!! I served this over mashed potatoes and he would not stop eating this! What little was left he took to work and said he would need to lie to his co-workers and tell them it was awful just so he could keep it to himself! This is now his #1 favorite dish and will be requesting this often. Please, please, please create some more recipes!!!!!

This was a fantastic recipe and perfect comfort food.  I live in Belgium and I needed worcestshire sauce without anchovies (the hubby is allergic).  So, I made it homemade for the first time.  Recipe was spot on, only I did not use water in making the gravy and I think maybe I should have after all.  I understand now why it is in the recipe.

This is comfort food at it's best. It had a good onion, mushroom and beefy gravy. Very flavorful and easy for a weeknight meal. I did add a few cloves of garlic to the onions and mushrooms. Hubby loved it as it reminded him of his Grandma's.

LOVE it! Husband loves it! I cheated and used premade mushroom gravy. It was getting late. I did sautee the onion. Good stuff!

7.22.17  I followed the recommendation of another reviewer to use ALL beef  broth, no water, I’m glad I did, and will do so again.  IMO the gravy’s really the star (not the meat) in this recipe.  All of that beef broth really enriched the flavor, and this is some pretty darn good, quick-and-easy gravy.  Rather than frying (and dirtying another pan), I grilled the burgers (excuse me, salisbury steaks), and then just let them simmer for a little while in the mushroom-onion-beef gravy.  Simply comfort food at its finest.  I grew up on stuff like this, and that was in the Midwest.

My go to Salisbury steak recipe. In fact, my mom likes it so much she just asked for the recipe. My only recommendation to others is to double the gravy!

This has become one of my favorite recipes.  I make it exactly as the recipe is written.  My family loves the steaks and the gravy is super.  Guests request it when I invite them over for dinner.  Very easy to make, not expensive, and looks pretty on the plate.  What more can I ask for.

I had a package of hamburger that I needed to use up and went looking for a good Salisbury Steak recipe. I served this recipe, with mashed potatoes & corn, last night. I pretty much followed the recipe, just replacing the water with more broth, adding some garlic and de-glazing the onion pan with a touch of Marsala. My husband, who hates " bland Salisbury Steak", absolutely Devoured it. This recipe has earned a spot in the box. Will definitely be making again.

Delicious and easy recipe.  I didn't use water and added beef stock, based on earlier revues.  This made for a richer tasting sauce.  It didn't take as long to cook as the recipe indicates, but letting it simmer longer does help with the flavor.  Served with mashed potatoes, my family enjoyed this very much, and I will make again.

I followed the directions exactly as published except I put the patties on the grill, when almost done I covered them in gravy and put them in the oven for 10 minutes.

Incredible!!  We loved it!  Did not deviate from the recipe (never do the first time I make a new recipe & won't with this one). The patties were tender & very flavorful and the gravy was awesome. Will definitely make it again.

I'm a little surprised that anyone finds the gravy bland.  Are you remembering to put the other 1/2 package of onion soup mix in it?  I did follow a suggestion to add minced garlic to the onions and mushrooms before sautéing and I'm glad I did.  My family loves garlic.  I used 2 cups of beef stock and just 1/2 cup of water because that's what I had.  I wouldn't use all beef stock, though, because of the additional onion soup mix that you add to the gravy.  Even with that, I still added a little salt and pepper to the gravy, but it was delicious!  This was a hit with my family.  Thank you for the recipe!

I made a few adjustments to suit my taste; about half the onion soup (I only had a partial package on hand; and less salt in always good), added half a bulb of sliced fennel and only 1/2 the onion, and then added a couple heaping tablespoons of sour cream before serving. That gave it a beef stroganoff feel.  You don't taste the fennel, it blends in with the onion. Served it over rice. Yummm, will make this again!

I loved this recipe, however I did tweak it.  Instead of using a 1/2 packet of onion soup mix (too much salt) in the patties, I used seasoned salt, onion powder, garlic powder, celery leaves and pepper.  In the gravy, instead of the 1/2 onion soup mix, I just dropped in a beef bouillon cube and black pepper.   So much flavor and the gravy was great.

This recipe was very good.  The 2 changes I made, I added garlic(to taste)  to the meat mixture before making into paddies.  Also, why use 2 pans?  if you use the second pan you miss out on all of the flavorful brown bits left in the first pan.  When the paddies have been browned, remove from pan and tent with foil to keep warm.  Then add a bit of beef stock to the pan and scrape up all of those wonderful cooking bits before you saute the onions and mushrooms.  Then proceed with the recipe.  Better flavor and only one pan to wash.... win win!  Oh, cook time was way off.  The whole dishtook me 25 mins.

Great recipe, I am a dad cooking for a couple very picky children,  Second helpings all around. Only opinion I have is no salt needed the soup mix is more than enough. I did although add a clove of garlic to the gravy.

Excellent!  I have been looking for this flavor for years. Reminds me of what I get at the cafeteria but with twice the flavor. 
Maybe a touch of garlic next time? 
Saved to my favorites so I can make again.

Great recipe! Only adjustments I made were to add garlic and red bell pepper to the sauté. I will add more garlic and ketchup to the meat mixture next time for more zest. Husband and small kids ate it up and asked for more!! Served with squash and rest of red bell pepper (from skillet after meat was removed without cleaning and adding olive oil, garlic salt, pepper and parsley) and naan we had on hand. Delicious!!

I did make one change simply based on my pantry, used package of Beefy-Onion soup instead of onion. I think it was probably a good change. We loved it and plan to make it again soon!

I founds this tasted a little too much like soup mix, but my husband and kids loved it. And it does get points for being fairly easy and presenting nicely.

Quite tasty. I've made this several times now with only minor changes based on ingredients on hand. We prefer less onion so I only use half. For mushrooms, I've used both fresh & from a jar with success. I usually use about half the mushrooms called for. I use 2 1/2 cups broth & omit the water (sometimes use water & 3 beef bouillon cubes). Typically I prepare & brown the patties, prepare the gravy & put them in the crock pot on low for half the day to simmer until dinnertime. This works perfectly (evenings are busy in my house so this is more convenient)! Serve with noodles or mashed potatoes and a salad.

I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground chuck, because that was what the store had. I used 2 eggs and everything else just as the recipe stated. I'll will be making this again. There were no leftovers and if there had been more it would have been eaten. Next time, I will double this up.

Reminds me of the meals my mom used to make when I was growing up in Iowa except this was much better!  I took the advice of others and added a clove of garlic to the meat mixture, did not dilute with water (used 2 1/2 cups stock), and also did not simmer the meat for 30 min as it didn't need near that long.  I hate doing extra dishes so I browned the meat in my cast iron skillet then removed to a platter and sautéed the onions/shrooms in same skillet.  Once the sauce began to thicken I added the meat back to the skillet to warm about 5 min. I served with mashed potatoes and sprinkled a dash of dill on top to brighten it up. Viola! You have yourself a very Midwestern dinner!

I love simple meals and this was as simple s it gets. I replaced the water with a good Merlot and the gravy was to die for. Added a thinly sliced bell pepper as well. Even my wife, who is quite picky, loved it. I would defiantly do this one again and again.

I made this for dinner this evening and I added:
1 Tbsp. Hoisin sauce to the ground beef
1 tsp. Worcestershire to the ground beef
added garlic to the sauté of onions and mushrooms
Deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup Cognac.
Flavors were amazing, the family thought it was great too.
Will make this again in the future.  Try not to over cook the beef.

This was rather simple to make, but I had to change it slightly due to gluten intolerance.

First with the hamburger steak portion. I exchanged oatmeal for panko bread crumbs. The patties were very "sloppy" and wet when making them, but as they cook, the oatmeal absorbs the liquid and they turn out perfect. Cook them with lid on if you make this variation as the liquid needs to absorb into the oatmeal and not just fry off. I also used VERY lean burger as we get it straight from the farm and have it butchered the way we like it. Therefor there is very little fat in the pan to worry about.

As for the gravy, I used bone broth we made by boiling the deer bones and beef bones after butchering. It has a much stonger and more irony flavor than store bought  broth. I used double the gluten free flour and then doubled the liquid and used 2 cans of canned mushrooms and a red onion because that's what I had in the house. I sautéed the onions and mushrooms then removed them from the pan, added a little more butter, and the onion soup mix, 3TBSP pepper and flour frying until the flour was browned. They slowly I added about 1/2cup of broth at a time whisking until it was even then added more liquid. If you just dump all of the liquid in at once you get lumpy gravy. If you don't brown your flour you get floury tasting gravy and the gravy doesn't take on the rich flavors from the meat. After the liquid is added and the consistency is about how I wanted it (just a little thinner than I want

This is the first time I've ever made Salisbury steak, I will definitely make this again. I omitted the mushrooms because we didn't have any and sautéd garlic with the onions in the butter.  I also added 2 eggs to the meat mixture to make it a little more easier to mix. I'm not sure how much ground chuck I used.(I didn't have ground sirloin). I made mashed potatoes and sweet peas as a side. It came out really good. My picky husband had seconds and my picky son cleaned his plate. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I had to make a couple of substitutions -- I decided to make this tonight and didn't have ground sirloin or ground round, so I used ground chuck, and also used 2 (6.5-oz) cans of mushrooms instead of fresh.  Like at least one other reviewer, I used just one frying pan; browned the patties with a little butter, then removed them to a plate, added more butter and cooked the onions and mushrooms, then proceeded according to the recipe.  Not only do you not lose the tasty bits from browning the meat that way, but you only have to wash one pan!  I did also add about 1/4 C of red wine with the stock and water (reducing the amount of water by about 1/4 cup).  I did add a little salt and pepper to the gravy, which I really thought was awesome (even with the canned mushrooms)!  The patties themselves, though, seemed to be missing something in terms of flavor... I'm just not sure what.  (This may just have been the difference between using the ground chuck and stepping up to a better grade of meat.)  At any rate, along with some mashed potatoes and green beans this made a great meal for a coldJanuary night!

I didn't have any beef stock handy, so I used vegetable broth. I didn't add any water or salt to the gravy either. I followed everything else, and thought it came out very tasty. I served with noodles and corn.

I will probably be making this all the time because the family loved it so much.  I made the meat patties like the directions called for and put the patties  in a casserole pan.  Then I took cream of mushroom soup and mixed it with a little water to pour over it for a gravy.  Then I  cooked it at 350 for 50 minutes.  THEY LOVED IT :-)

Made as directed, only doubled for larger family get together.  We also thought the gravy needed a bit more flavor upon tasting  and so, prior to adding the steaks to it, we adjusted with 2/3 to 3/4 cup more broth.  This thinned the gravy down a notch to a sauce, which I then insisted on bringing back to gravy status with a little more thickening.  It would have been fine as a sauce, we just really wanted that gravy.  If you're as hungry as we were, you can certainly tear into it after the steaks have simmered for ten minutes.  Longer simmer time just adds to the wonderful flavor in this dish.  Our mouths were watering in anticipation of this dinner, it smelled so good.  Basically, try this one and don't worry about minor changes to suit your tastes as this is very versatile and will remain a great Salisbury recipe.  We'll make again by cutting out about one cup of water from the gravy.  We served over rice with roasted butternut squash.  Very tasty meal!

Oh my stars is this a rich onion and beef flavor!  This is an easy go-to recipe for me from now on.  I might try adding sherry or masala next time.  Don't skimp on the beef bullion though.  I've also read adding a bit of balsamic vinegar to onion soup will deepen flavor, will try that.

LOVE this recipe. Very rich and tasty. HUGE hit with my husband and his friends too! I have made it several times. I substituted fresh mushrooms for canned mushrooms. Also added a cube of chicken and a cube of beef bullion for extra flavor. Very good!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 2.5 cups of water with 3 beef cubes when I realized I was out of beef stock!  I made four patties from just over a pound of meat and they were perfect for us (and cooked perfectly in 30 minutes).  To save dishes, I pulled the browned patties out of the skillet and followed the remaining directions in that same skillet.  I'll definitely make this again... perfect for a cold evening!

I have made this twice now. It is an excellent recipe as is. Great taste nice gravy infused with mushroom and onion flavor. Highly recommend it. Mashed potatoes and corn are great side dishes and compliment it well.

I doubled this recipe but only used half the butter and  kept the original called for amount of dry soup mix. I added a dash of Worchester sauce to the gravy and a few shakes of garlic powder. I will be making this again very soon. My whole family loved it.

I made this last night and Wow! Great flavor! My Hubby wasn't a fan of Salisbury Steak, but now he is! I made this recipe with small additions: Added 1/2 cup chopped green onions into steak mixture (we love onions!). Added 1.5 tsp. of minced fresh garlic and a splash (just shy of 1/4 cup) of dark or stout beer to the gravy during the simmer phase. It was AWESOME! Thank you for sharing!

Some weeks back I was on the FB page of Navy Veterans and we were commenting on the meals we were served and someone mentioned Salisbury Steak.  After viewing several recipes I choose the Midwest Salisbury Steak.  This is my second time making it now and I am very pleased with the meal.  I followed the directions except that I used an 8 oz can of mushrooms, 2 onions plus I added a sprinkling of garlic powder into the gravy.  I also used a full 15 1/2 oz can of stock and 1/2 cup of the mushroom liquid.  Simply delicious and easy to make!

I fixed this for dinner last night and my husband really, really enjoyed.  I omitted the mushrooms (not a fan) and followed some suggestions to leave out the salt.  It was delicious!!!  I will be making this again.

My husband loved it! I used more stock than I did water. We're both not mushroom fans so we did without them.  Either way, it was definitely a good dinner !

Really good. Worth the time and will make it again. The onion soup mix probably has enough salt.

My husband really liked it. I was hoping for leftovers for both of us but he ate so much.  Says its a keeper. Made it just as the recipe says - no changes and it was very good.

It was quick and easy, great gravy. Usually when I make gravy with flour I have lumps, but not with this.

Wow, this is an easy and great tasting recipe!  One of the modifications I made was using a full pouch of onion soup mix in the meat mix and gravy as the pouches I had were 1oz each. Also, I heated up the beef stock and blended the flour (I used gluten-free flour) before adding it to the sauteed onion/mushroom stir fry.  (Have had my share of lumpy gravy resulting from just adding the flour into the mix as described in the directions of the recipe).  Not knocking the recipe writer, just my lack of experience and probably not stirring the mixture correctly.  Definitely a keeper!!

This was a great recipe.  The gravy was perfect and the steaks were tasty and tender.  I didn't change anything.  I liked it just the way it is.

I just made this tonight,  and it had a very good flavor!  I made it into four patties instead of five and used all beef broth, and no water. I simmered it  for just 20 minutes on low and it was perfect! The whole family loved it! I would definitely make it again!

This was really GOOD! I agree, yummy comfort food, the gravy is awesome, and I am going to use it for other meats. The "steak" tasted like really yummy meatloaf, so, my family decided to rename this dish as "personal meatloaf" =)
