Great for camping.  Quick, simple and nourishing.  Checked out the zip loc site re: toxicity of the bag.  To be honest you would have to eat a lot of food, cooked in the bags to be affected.  No BPA's or dioxin.  I will still cook this way.  If you can microwave in it, it's OK.  Sometimes I think there is too much scaremongering about cooking methods and different foods.

Great, but you must use qt. size FREEZER bags.
Sandwich size is too small, and food storage bags are too thin and will melt.

We love to do this with large groups. Prep before you go and easy clean up. I recommend using small ziplock freezer bags. Trust me I'm speaking from experience. :)

Definitely use the FREEZER bags! Anything less will spring a leak.

I do river rafting trips for groups of 10-30 and this is one of my go to recipes for breakfast, it is simple and everyone can customize their own.  One suggestion ALWAYS use the ziploc Freezer bags

We make these quite often while camping. You can modify it with different ingredients i.e. cooked ham, bacon, sausage, tomatoes, different cheeses, etc.  The kids love putting these together.  We use freezer bags (thicker) and mark the name of who's omelet it is on the top of the bag with black permanent marker.

While I agree this is a good camping recipe, or if you have a larger crowd for breakfast at home, it is definitely not a substitute for a quality omelet. I experimented with it several times, and it either turns out with the egg overcooked, or too runny. Good for those times when "quick and easy" takes precedence over taste.

Definitely a good idea for camping.  I used a quart size bag because I didn't have resealable sandwich bag size.  I would recommend smaller bag, as larger bag spread out ingredients to much.  I also used only 1 egg and substituted fresh spinach for green pepper. I used too much mushroom and spinach for the amount of egg I used as these are watery products.  I also found it seemed to stick to inside of bag.  Think I will stick to fry pan inside the house.

Worked great!  I've heard of these before but not tried them.  I didn't follow recipe exactly, only the cooking method.  I whisked the eggs before adding to bag.  Used black pepper, garlic salt, tiny bit of paprika, sliced sausage links, and garden tomatoes.  I'm sure it would be great as written, too, lol but I was trying to get this done during my son's nap time and didn't feel like prepping veggies.  This would be great for camping, houseguests, or the morning after slumber parties.  Worked perfectly, but also LOOKED nice, which is not something I was expecting out of something cooked in a sandwich bag!  I used regular, generic sandwich bags and it was fine, no need for pricier freezer bags.

Really awesome way to cook an omelet without the mess whilst camping! MAKE SURE the bag has a good, airtight seal-we had some water leakage with one bag but the other bag turned out perfectly!

I made these last night and my crew loved it!  My pickiest eater even enjoyed it!  They immediately asked that I cook them again!  The omelet comes out oddly shaped but who cares, it perfectly cooked!

This is a go to recipe for us when camping and at Girl Scout overnight camps.  I add broccoli, cauliflower, ham, turkey and other veggies as we have them.  Make sure to get all of the air out of the baggie and use the Freezer bags for less of a chance of the bag bursting.

I wasn't thrilled with the end result. It was pretty easy to put all the ingredients in a bag and mix it up, but the texture of a boiled omelet was not my favorite.  In the 12 minutes cooking time, I had 3 other omelets prepared in a frying pan.

If you don't want to cook, this is a healthy way to go. If you like to camp then by all means you'll want to try this! You will save on washing dishes and have a great meal to boot, a win-win all the way around! I highly recommend trying this.

If you don't want to sit and wait on a pot of water to boil, you can do like I did and put it in a vegetable steamer!  Turned out great!  I used a freezer ziplock quart size bag. :-)

I did make  these. They are very tasty.  You do need to use a freezer type bag because the sandwich ziplock bags are not sturdy enough.
Any meat items you add need to be cooked ahead. The eggs roll out of the bag easily after the eggs are done.  These are so fun to make and hit the spot.  Everyone makes their own to taste.
