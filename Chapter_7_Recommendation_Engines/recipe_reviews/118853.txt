Being a vegetarian, this recipe caught my eye. The
first time I followed the recipe to a tee, and it was
good. The next time I subbed white rice for the
brown, pinto beans for the kidney, added the salsa
while the mixture was cooking (then ladled more on
when serving), and 1/2 tsp. taco seasoning (from
this site), and it was to die for. A quick, delicious
recipe that is five stars and highly recommended!

This was a very tasty wrap. Instead of using 3/4 cup salsa and drizzling it onto the rice mixture in the wrap, I added 1 cup salsa along with the rice and other ingredients. I like the salsa to be evenly distributed. The ingredients make for a very colorful dish. (I used the red pepper)I also used a regular frying pan, sprayed it with Pam and cut the oil in half. This is definitely a keeper!!! Healthy and tasty!! What more could you ask for? I think this recipe would also be very good with black beans. For those looking for healthier diets do not even think of substituting white rice.

I didn't have brown rice so I used white.  After filling the tortilla I added fresh chopped cilantro, a spritz of lemon, fresh chopped tomatoes instead of salsa, and chopped avocado.  The cilantro and lemon gives an an added kick and an authentic Mexican feel .  This recipe is extremely easy to make, takes very little time, and is definitely a keeper.

I made a very loose adaptation of this recipe consisting of  brown rice cooked with cumin and tomato, leftover black bean and corn salsa, (which included onion, tomato and hot peppers, among other things,) a sliced avocado, sharp cheddar cheese, a few dollops of nonfat yogurt cheese (as a sour cream substitute), and a squirt of hot sauce. Then I sent one off in my husband's lunch, and had one for lunch myself. It was neat enough to eat on the go, substantial enough to keep us both going until dinner, and it tasted great cold, which is a big advantage if you don't have access to a microwave oven at work.

These wraps are great and so simple to make! You can easily modify the recipe to suite your taste, or make several different variations so you can change things up for day-to-day lunches!  I like to add spinach, black beans, and chicken to mine, and use a little teriyaki instead of salsa.  I love to experiment with different sauces and add other vegetables like carrots and celery for an added crunch.  Also try different flavored wraps from your grocery store such as sundried tomato or spinach for added flavor :)

these were surprisingly delicious. At first glance the recipe didn't seem like much but wow, these are yummy. The only change I made was to substitute red beans for black and I also did not add mushrooms. What a quick and tasty vegetarian option for dinner!

I ate it, my husband ate it, and my 2 year old son ate it! So it's a keeper.
I didn't use frozen corn, just canned.
I had trouble getting the brown rice done, but once I did and mixed it with the rest it really turned out to be a great meal.
We added cilantro, sour cream, and salsa along with some fresh tomatos from our neighbors garden. YUM!!! 
Hubby looks forward to taking good meals to work and this is one of them.

Delicious, easy and cheap to make. I sauteed the onions with the peppers, mushrooms and garlic instead of adding them afterwards. I also used Rice-a-Roni brown rice because it's cheap and easy. Great recipe!

Everyone enjoyed this!  It's an easy and filling vegetarian dinner.  I used a can of drained corn instead of frozen and left out the mushrooms because I just didn't have any.  Also, sprinkled with a little bit of cilantro for color.

These were awesome!  I used black beans instead of the kidney beans.  I will definitely make this again.

These were very tasty.  Although my older kids didn't want them, but 11 month old loved the insides.  I used black beans and no mushrooms--we don't like mushrooms.  And regular onion because I had no green.  I thought that this might make a delicious breakfast burrito if you substitute scrambled egg for the rice.  Just a thought.

I really liked this meal and my little ones didn't mind it either.  I replaced the kidney beans with garbanzo (hubby doesn't like kidney).  I used canned mushrooms because I didn't have fresh.  I also used minced garlic instead of fresh and white rice instead of brown because that's what I had on hand.  I would say this is definitely a repeat.

This was pretty mediocre to me. Very dry and not a lot of flavor. The only real flavor came from the salsa I added to the mixture. Was looking for a little more...The only positive is that it is healthy.

I loved these!  They are so easy and very tasty!  I made them just as written.  Even my carnivore husband enjoyed them commented that he would like the mixture as a side dish as well.  My 2 pickty pre-teens ate them, too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum!!!!!!!!  So healthy and so tasty!  I keep going back and picking at the leftovers in the fridge!  I'm not a vegetarian at all, and this was fantastic--as good or better than any meat taco or burrito I've had.  This was so quick and easy.  I used a can of golden, sweet corn which added a nice crunch.  It's going to be a regular!

Very good.  I used white rice because that's what I had.  I suggest increasing the amount of cumin - I probably used 1.5 - 2 tsp.

The first time I made this recipe, I didn't have kidney beans onhand. It was good though. The second time I had a can of kidney beans and it was MUCH BETTER. I love these brown rice wraps. I'll make them many times a month.

I was looking for something relatively quick and simple for dinner.  FOUND!  I did some alterations though.  Instead of kidney beans I used black beans.  I didn't have any corn, but added lima beans so the volume of the filling remained the same.  Definitely a good last minute meal.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I used taco seasoning instead of the cumin.  I don't know if we would have liked it as well without the taco seasoning.
