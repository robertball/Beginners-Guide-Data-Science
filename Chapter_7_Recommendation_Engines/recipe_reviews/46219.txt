I love this but it never cooks all the way.  I found that the only way for it to be completely done is when you add the rice, follow the timing on the back of the rice package instead.

Great taste!  I've made it as a side and as a duck stuffing.  (even in the duck it was undercooked)

Instead of using it as a stuffing, I just made it as a side with chicken. Delicious. Will make again and again. Thanks

EXCELLENT!! 6 STARS!! I made a similar stuffing years ago for Thanksgiving dinner and it became an instant favorite. One very nice way to modify this is to add a handful of craisins and substitute the cashews for chopped pecans. I'm big fan of "sneaking" additional nutritional points into foods, so add some finely chopped spinach to the mix and no one will know!

A gourmet rice recipe that you will be making often.  Very tasty and different.  I also used it as a side with dijon tarragon chicken and completed the meal with a simple french salad.  Loved it!

Really, really good and healthy, too. We loved this especially because we love cashews. I didn't use rosemary (didn't have any) so I subbed thyme. The kids were initially skeptical of the wild rice, but ended up eating all of it. Will use as a regular side dish at our house.

This was a big hit.... Delicious! I made it as a side dish in place of traditional stuffing with a turkey dinner.

wonderful, I made this for Thanksgiving since my guests couldn't have wheat.  It was very tasty. I used it as a side dish and did find that I had to cook the rice for a LOOONG time, about an hour and 15 min, but I'm also at a very high elevation.  I will make it again.

Even though I thought this would be an absolutely fabulous recipe, I was disappointed. I found that the salt in the cashews didn't make up for the lack of salt in the recipe.  Some people liked it at our Christmas table and some not.  I would not make the recipe the same way again next time.  By the way, I made it as a side dish, not as a stuffing.

What a delicious rice recipe.  I made this as a rice side dish and received raved comments.  This is too good to stuff into a bird.  No modifications made at all and it turned out awesome.

the rosemary really gives it a nice taste and I added more nuts for decoration, they looked nice and made a nice crunch at the end.

This was wonderful!  It was just like a stuffing should be, but we served it as a side dish.  We also prepared the Glazed Pork Tenderloin from this website and it complimented extremely well.

Delicious!  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock to make it veg friendly, then stuffed it in a baked miniature pumpkin.  A lovely addition to our vegan Thanksgiving meal!

I did not make this as a stuffing.  I just made this as a side dish in a saucepan and it was wonderful. I also subbed in a teaspoon of dried, chopped rosemary, which worked just fine.

This came out great the only changes I made was was to add some fresh minced garlic and I use pecans instead of cashews because that's what I had in the house I'm using this to stuff pork chops

I grilled a 12lb turkey with this pilaf stuffed inside.  I should have heeded the reviews that said the rice didn't cook completely in the bird, because even after nearly 3 hours much of the rice was still crispy.  The rice had good flavor, though, and didn't dry the turkey out too much as stuffings tend to do.  Cashews are my favorite nut; next time I would lightly toast them prior to adding to the mix.
