Really delicious! I reduced the sugars down to a little less than 1/2 cup each; added an extra Tbsp. cream, a full cup of Pignoli (toasted in the oven for about 6-8 min at 175°C (350°F)) and a few drops of almond extract; also baked in pastry dough instead of a pie shell. I served this to guests - there were only 4 of us and it was gone by the end of the evening! Thanks for this simple, divine recipe!

This recipe was quick and easy.  The taste and texture is almost like a pecan pie.  The only change I made was toasting the nuts before putting them in the pie to make the flavor more powerful.  Wait until completely cooled before cutting - although when you smell this baking you'll have a hard time waiting!  Great recipe!

I was given a huge bag of pine nuts and looked for recipes I could use them in besides salads and pesto. I was delighted when I found this recipe. It was very easy to make. Use butter and not margerine for the richer flavor. I used a full cup of pine nuts, toasted them on a cookie sheet before using them in the pie, which filled a regular 9 inch frozen pie crust. I brought two pies into work and they were gone in no time. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This was delicious.  It didn't look like a pecan pie, like I expected.  It has more of a cookie-looking crust.  I toasted my pine nuts first and also added about 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Next time, I will try reducing the sugar b/c the sweetness almost overwhelmes the taste of the pignolis, and I don't want to give up the chocolate!  Great recipe!

This is a wonderful pie!  Easy & quick.  I substituted half the sugar with Splenda, and half the butter with Conola butter.  It is still sticky & tasty!  Thanks!

This is super simple, easy and delisioso.  I did as others suggested and pre-toasted the nuts, but everything else was as presented.  I've made it four times this month for different guests and everyone loves it!

I read all reviews and followed the updated 1/2 cup both white and brown sugar; 1 cup toasted pine nuts, doubled the heavy cream to 2 TBSP.  This is easy and it's great.

This was a WONDERFUL recipe! Everyone loved it. I served whipped cream on top of the warm pie slice and it was delightful to the tastebuds! No doubt I will make this again and again.
