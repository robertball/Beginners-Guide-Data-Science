Delicious pizza. Easy to make and all the flavors work amazingly well together.  An excellent alternative to a heavier traditional style pizza.  Will definitely make this again soon.

We enjoyed this in spite of the fact that the pears I used did not have a ton of flavor.  This would make a really nice party appetizer, cut into small wedges.  From a presentation point of view, the pear slices looked a little dry when this came out of the oven.  Next time I think I'll try heating a little bit of apple jelly and brushing it on the fruit before it goes into the oven.  For whatever reason, the crust ended up tough/too chewy...I used a Boboli thin pizza crust.  In the future, I think I'll use my own homemade pizza crust.  This is very rich, the vinaigrette has a wonderful herb-garlic-blue cheese flavor, and it was dinner last night with a big tossed salad.  IMO this is best served warm.  Thanks M.J.W. for a new recipe that definitely is "outside the box."

best. pizza. ever. made. it was amazing! and so easy. I really enjoyed making this pizza. I used ww dough i made in the bread machine and substituted feta for blue cheese because its what I had on hand, and threw in a green onion instead of rosemary. But other than that followed the recipe and really enjoyed this pizza.

Wow! This pizza was so delicious! I don't used pre-baked crust, I use the fresh dough from the local supermarket. This pizza turned out very well. The flavor combinations were spot on. I substituted toasted walnuts with candied walnuts because that's what I had. Still amazing. The sauce loses a little bit of flavor once cooked, but you can always add a little more once the pizza is cooked. Mmmmm.

I use my own crust but follow the rest of the recipe. I've made this many times for many people and it has always been a success. Even people who say they don't like pears have loved it!

Great blue cheese flavor in this pizza, blended wonderfully with the pears and walnuts. I might use less of the vinaigrette sauce next time as some people thought it was a bit overpowering. We made our own pizza crust instead of using a store-bought one and we used dried hens instead of fresh ones.

Ok, rating again because this time I made it with fresh rosemary, cut it into small pieces and served as an appetizer at a friend's birthday party - rave reviews. PLUS - I used the leftover sauce this way: I sauteed some chicken thighs in olive oil (salt and peppered it first). I had 1/2 bunch of swiss chard to use up so I chopped it finely and threw that in while cooking the chicken. When chicken was browned on both sides, I added in the leftover sauce that I didn't use on the pizza. I had two ripe pears to use up so I peeled those, chopped and threw them in too. Cooked until chicken was almost falling apart, maybe 40 mins. Served it over jasmine rice. YUM!

Too much mustard. I topped the pizza with chopped fresh spinach. Next time I'll use more garlic.
