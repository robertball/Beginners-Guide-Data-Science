I used "soured" milk in this recipe--that was the only change I made. One of the best waffle recipes I've ever used, cooking-wise, and one of the best waffle recipes we as a family ever have eaten. The submitter is right, you don't need syrup for this waffle. Butter was really all the embellishment it needed. NOTE: I did burn my first couple waffles and what I figured was that the sugar content in the waffles made them easier to scorch. Once I figured it out, I just was careful to watch them a little closer.

These waffles have become legendary in our family.  The grandkids demand that Grandma makes them.  Many batches have been made and frozen for quick toasting in the morning. 
By the way, when I make these waffles my family demands I make the Chocolate Cream Pudding by Mimi with the leftover egg yolks.

For some reason they would stick in the waffle maker...I did use less oil and less sugar. I do not know if this affected the mixture. All I can say is that they tasted great, but the fact that I had so much trouble with them sticking even if I used cooking spray, kind of turned me off.

Great recipe.  Increased cinnamon to 1 tbs instead of 2 1/2 tsp.  Also, substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the all-purpose flour and added an extra 1/4 cup oil.  With this substitution, you may need to reapply non-stick spray between batches.

I decided to try this recipe on a whim after it was emailed this morning.  I must say that these waffles just melt in your mouth.  They are soft & most importantly flavorful. I've tried other waffle recipes & NOTHING compares to this. Enjoy!!!

I liked the cinnamon flavoring, but the waffles turned out tougher and chewier than I like. The added sugar does make them burn easier, so watch for that.

I just finished making these waffles just as the recipe is written.  I LOVED THEM!!  A tasty twist on a waffle with the sweetness of the sugars plus the cinnamon, this is now my go to recipe for waffles for my family.

This is a great recipe. It came out perfect. Great taste. I've made twice already and have shared the recipe with friends. It does burn quicker than other waffle batters so you have to keep an eye on them. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us, Carol!

I didn't have whole milk in the house so I used Almond Milk.  The recipe is easy and delicious.  Makes 6 waffles (4 sections in each waffle).  We had it with butter and powdered sugar.  Maple syrup would have made these way too sweet.  Fruit topping with whipped cream would be a great choice as well for a dessert option.

It is a daily challenge in my home to fix a meal that all five of us enjoy.  This one was a home run!  My boys don't like syrup, and these waffles taste great on their own.  My daughter put peanut butter on hers and went on and on about them.  My wife and I are simple butter and syrup waffle eaters, and they were the best waffle recipe I have ever made.  I kept a close watch on them since so many reviewers had trouble with them burning(no cooking spray either).  No problems whatsoever.  Only issue...the recipe was not enough to feed the five of us.  It made 12 rather small waffles, and on our waffle maker, we need at least 16!  I know we will make these again, so I will just adjust accordingly.

I followed this recipe as written, but just used a little less white sugar and brown sugar than called for.  The waffles were still sweet enough and very tasty with the cinnamon.  For those using the larger round Belgian Waffle maker, this recipe makes 4 waffles.  Very good!

These were the most delicious waffles I've ever had. Perfect balance of flavours. I have them with just a drizzle of maple syrup and they are divine. Love them on their own too. I'm usually not big on waffles but this recipe has made me a believer.

These were fabulous.  My husband is not an adventurous eater and generally doesn't like classics with a twist.  However, he LOVED these.  We will definitely have these again!  The only mod I made to the recipe was using a full 3 t of cinnamon.

My first time making this and everyone couldn't stop raving about how awesome they were. I tweaked it a lil by upping the cinammon to 1tbsp and the vanilla to 2tsp, I also used less sugar but it was still awesome :)

Really good. Next time I will cut down the recipe. It made way more than I needed in my Belgian Waffle Maker. It was also a little bit more work than regular waffles, but worth the trouble.

Disastrous experience making this today!  My husband poured the first batch of batter into our waffle iron. Because I had read concerns about how these waffles burn quickly due to the high brown sugar content, my husband opened the waffle iron earlier to check the waffles. Well, when he opened the waffle iron, the waffles were soft and split in half, each half stuck to either half of the griddle despite having been oiled adequately. The waffles did come off the waffle iron  easily.  So, for the second attempt, I oiled the waffle iron again, and let the batter cook longer. When the indicator light  showed that the waffles were ready, I tried to open the waffle iron but it was stuck!  My husband and 22 yr old son then tried to pry it open. They determined that the “release button” on the waffle iron was functioning correctly  (you could see the lever on the underside of the waffle iron move when the release button was depressed). So it was actually the waffle batter that had caused the waffle iron to stick together!  After much effort, we finally pried the waffle iron apart, and peeled the over- crisped waffles off the griddle plates- but also ended up breaking a part of our waffle iron in the process. :(    We decided to make pancakes out of the remaining batter. Had to watch these closely as they burned  easily. In the end, the pancakes and the mangled waffles were tasty, but quite sweet  so you didn’t really need maple syrup. I would prefer the batter be less sweet so I coul

Yummy!  I only used 1/4 cup of brown and 1/4 cup of white sugar and made no other changes.  It was plenty sweet for our tastes.  Use your own best judgement, but I will make this again.

Tasted great! I substituted vegetable oil with melted butter, vanilla extract with (good) maple syrup and dark brown sugar for the brown sugar.  Then sprinkled more cinnamon sugar on the finished waffles! Yum! My colleagues enjoyed them too!

Very good! I added some fresh nutmeg, one diced and sauted apple and substituted 3/4 cup of the milk for some vanilla Greek yogurt just to give them the slight sour taste. The apple was cooked down on low, with butter, a touch of salt and some Brandy to reduce it all down. I also used all white sugar, only because I was mistaken in thinking I had some at home! I do want to try it with the brown sugar, because I think it'd give them a deeper flavor. Either way, these were a hit!

The smell and the flavor is just like the store bought cinnamon toast waffles. I made these without eggs, and used almond milk. I lightly dust them with more cinnamon before serving. These waffles are scrumptious.

Let the waffle cook a little longer than a couple minutes so it can get crispy. ALso when you take it off the iron. Let it cool alittle so the steam evaporates and it gets a little more crispier before sprinkling on the powdered sugar. Otherwise the taste was great and it doesn't need syrup!

These are the best waffles ever! My husband is a huge waffle lover and after watching cook off shows he seems to be like a “food critic”, so I was a bit nervous. Thankfully, he loved them! No need for syrup! Just added butter and powered sugar and they were ready to go.

Made these for a bridal shower waffle bar.  The only change that I made is that I added half milk and half rumchata.  These waffles were perfect.   Of the three varieties of waffles that I made these were the fave. I served with a peach compote and cinnamon whipped cream.

Made exactly as written--delicious! My kids love the frozen cinnamon waffles from the store, and these ones were a huge hit with them. The super picky 3yo even had seconds (completely unheard of)! 

The extra sugar made these stick much more than any other recipe I've made. They did peel easily from my nonstick waffle maker.

I made a few small changes: 
I used plain (unflavored and unstrained) yogurt instead of milk.
I substituted unsalted butter for the cooking oil (I like the taste of butter.)
I let the egg whites come to room temperature to facilitate whipping.
The flavor was excellent; I'm a big fan of the taste of cinnamon.
Be sure to use fresh baking powder - no more than 6 months old - for best results.

Beautifully light and flavorful waffles with the perfect amount of cinnamon, a perfect fall breakfast.  We though the texture was perfect.  I served it with sautéed apples and whipped cream.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. The only thing I did differently was use canola oil instead of vegetable oil. That's only because that's what I had in the house. My three year old son loves them too. No syrup needed. We had caramelized apples and powdered sugar with ours. AMAZING!

I love these, they are a bit more dense than my traditional waffle recipe, but the flavour is amazing. I don't like syrup so I wanted something I could eat without it and these waffles fit the bill!

These are so good. I've made them a few times already. Usually once a week! They also taste amazing when using a Mickey Mouse waffle maker! However, I tried to double the recipe and while it was still good, it was not as fluffy as usual. I don't recommend doubling it.

Very tasty!!! I was a little nervous to try this but it turned out great. I'm young so it took longer for me to make it, about 40 min max, but they turned out great! They are thick, but very delicious. For the tipping I did some whipped cream and just plain old male syrup, nothing fancy! ??

I followed this recipe as is, and my family went so crazy for it that we adopted "Waffle Wednesday" so we could have them weekly.  And that's in addition to our Sunday morning breakfasts!!  They do cook fast so they must be watched but it's worth the vigil.  Outstanding!

What an amazing recipe! My fiance made these for me as part of a surprise breakfast in bed and I was floored! It makes my waffles taste bland and boring. After the initial reactions of surprise, delight, incredulity and awe that he cooked something so delicious for me wore off I asked him how he made them. Thank you Carol! This is now part of our weekly menu. He added a little nutmeg to them to make them a little extra spicy, and whole eggs instead of just the whites because, and I quote here, " Why would anyone not use the best part of the egg?!?!" :) Thank you again!

Delicious , I mixed 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour. They turned out wonderful. These waffles don't need syrup they're sweet enough already

I followed this recipe verbatim, and it makes the best waffles I've ever had. I have a Black & Decker belgian waffle maker with no temp control, but a light that goes off when they're ready, and I find I have to leave them in a minute or two longer for a crispier waffle, but that is all. I was looking for a recipe for a waffle I could eat on its own without syrup or any toppings, and this was it! Wonderful, moist waffles that I can just grab to go. I brushed my non-stick iron with clarified butter instead of cooking spray, and I had no problem with sticking or burning. I'm having one right now with a coffee! I think I'd like to try them with apple or peaches! Mmmmmm! (I'm going to tweak them slightly and make them for dog treats, too! I had quite the appreciative audience while I was making them!)

Made this today after my daughter tried Eggo Cinnamon waffles at a friend's house.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazingly good!  I did not have too much of a problem with sticking thanks to my cooking spray. (I used to brush on vegetable oil and wonder why I didn't think of the spray before I read it here!) When a batch stuck a bit, I pried it off gently and resprayed the surface. 
The waffles were not crunchy which was fine - I put them on a tray in the oven to keep them warm until they were all baked and it crisped them just enough.
The flavor is amazing - it does NOT need syrup as many mention - even my syrup-crazy daughter didn't use it!  My husband isn't a big waffle fan and thought they were great. Used the leftover yolks in scrambled eggs and also had fresh fruit - great Sunday breakfast and not all that much more effort than the Bisquick box.  
A definite repeat especially since the three children already lobbied to add this to our Christmas morning breakfast tradition!

I joined allrecipes solely to leave a good review for these amazing waffles! We added a bit more cinnamon (3 tsp instead of 2.5) and ate it with chopped up strawberries. Even my six year old diva who at first decided they were "gross" (before she was force to try them), at last conceded that they were "YUMMY!"

This is the best waffle recipe I have ever tried. Absolutely delicious! Can be served with or without syrup because of the sweetness. This is going to be my new standard waffle recipe. Only negative is that they stick to the waffle iron a little more than some other recipes I've tried (I didn't use cooking spray because it's counter-indicated for my iron).

By far the best recipe I've found for home-made waffles. Not greasy like some others I've tried. It made quite a few waffles, so we froze the rest and put them in the toaster during the week for a quick breakfast.

I just loved it: I have been looking for this texture for such a long time! Because of the sugar, this delicacy gets crispy on the outside and remains fluffy on the inside. I used whole eggs, adding the yolks to the mixture before adding the fluffy whites. I also substituted a little less than a cup of almond meal for the same amount of flour and melted butter instead of using vegetable oil. Turned out to be perfect (not sure that my "twist"really changed anything, as it was the first time I tried this recipe but if you want to try, you will not regret). A lot of batter, will last for a while at my household of 2. Lucky me!

These are very good! I used only 1/8 a cup of white sugar and about 1/3 cup of brown sugar, plus I used half whole wheat flour. Straight white flour and all the sugar would have felt too much like dessert to me! This was delicious (and a bit healthier) with those modifications.
