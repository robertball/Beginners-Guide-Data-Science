I've made eggs this way for 40 years. I beat the cottage cheese and pepper  in with the eggs and add them to the skillet at the same time, then sprinkle with the chives just before serving them.  Makes fluffy scrambled eggs. Guests rave about them.

Very simple - I never would have thought to add cottage cheese to scrambled eggs, but it really was good and a nice change from regular scrambled eggs. Definitely add the fresh chives. I served this with fresh tomato slices and whole grain toast. Great breakfast!

I thought this was okay and reduced it down to a 1 egg serving. My only real issues were it didnt really add extra flavor like other cheeses I have tried. It also had zero melting abilities. I even tried to further microwave it. The breakfast did keep my appetite content all morning until lunch though.

I frequently add cheese to scrambled eggs but never thought to add cottage cheese! I scaled this to 1 egg, and it came out very creamy, with added volume. The chives add a delicate flavor and freshness as well. I also don't believe the cottage cheese is supposed to melt here. Thanks Kitchen Kitty for a simple and different take on scrambled eggs!

Really good way to add some protein to your eggs, but I would recommend straining the cottage cheese before. It took a while to cook off all the liquid.

Making this for the second time.  First time i made as directed and cut some cooked sausage patties in fourths and then pressed them down into the egg mixture. This time I‘m going to saute some mushrooms, onions and green pepper to add with some chopped ham.  Makes a good breakfast for my husband to reheat.

I started making eggs with cottage cheese not long ago. They are deliciously rich, creamy and flavorful when you beat the cottage cheese into the eggs before cooking them. 

Also, because of the salt in the cottage cheese, all you need is the pepper and whatever other herbs and spices you want to add. So trust the recipe on this. But don't fold wet cottage cheese into cooked eggs unless you just really enjoy that loose curdy texture.

Yummy, no need to add salt or  shredded cheese (like I'd normally do to scrambled eggs). Extends the eggs and adds more healthy protein. "Recipe" is a keeper!

Wanna make them even lighter and fluffier?  Try adding 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder.  I add it to all my scrambled eggs and omelets and you won't taste it at all.

I love scrambled eggs and I love cottage cheese so I thought this recipe would be a no brainer... But yuck. The egg emphasized the sour aftertaste of the cottage cheese. The first few bites were ok, but the more I ate, the ickier it tasted. IMHO, these two flavors are not complimentary.

Made as directed. Good, quick recipe for the "I don't want to cook" nights but I think it needs a little something. Don't know what, a touch of garlic maybe or green onions instead of chives. Will definitely be making again and will experiment.

Delicious! I found it added a great flavor to the egg (I normally can't eat them without ketchup). The cottage cheese melted nicely and they were very creamy!

Remember back in the early '70's when Atkins took the stage? That's when I learned to love scrambled eggs and cottage cheese. Separately, the tasty warm eggs and the cool cottage cheese were awesome, even better with some taco/hot sauce on the eggs. Mixing the two together is delicious! It's an excellent protein punch for breakfast or lunch. Mixed together is like a whole different meal, like putting a big spoon of cottage cheese on half a hard-boiled egg. Proof this is a dynamic duo!

Serve 2.

Very good!  I added some thinly sliced pieces of yellow zucchini (just a half dozen thin slices ) and 1/2 cup thin shredded deli ham.  I used light seasoning blend for spice.  I’m a WW Lifetimer, so this was a perfect recipe for two!

Unbelievable! I did not want to make these eggs. The thought of Cottage cheese in scrambled eggs grossed me out I'm sorry, I am just being honest. My husband gave me this recipe  and had bought  the Cottage cheese. He asked me to make it for him. I have to admit  I dragged my feet. Then  I made it! I was shocked! The scrambled eggs tasted like they had cheese on them. I have to say I did stir the eggs probably a bit more to cook all the liquid out. Most of the cottage cheese melted into the eggs- no they weren't dry, they were delicious!

Sorry. I like scrambled eggs. This just didn't taste any different than the usual made with milk. So 2 stars for taste and one more for a good low-carb suggestion. I make mine with cream cheese instead! Even creamier! Thanks for the idea!

Wow!   This is amazing!  I am trying to increase my proteins and will definitely use this recipe regularly.   I made this for one serving and used 1 large egg and 2 egg whites; used 1/4 cup low fat Publix cottage cheese and ate 1/4 cup while cooking lol!   I added salt, pepper and whipped.    The cottage cheese melted into the eggs for a creamy light egg meal!   No need to purée the cottage cheese before hand.    Sharing this recipe with the rest of my weight lifting friends.

An excellent recipe that was full of protein. I made three minor alterations. First, I used a whipped cottage cheese so that it would spread evenly through the eggs. Second, like many others, I mixed the eggs with the cottage cheese before cooking. Third, I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a title of heat. The recipe was nice!

Tasted great! No need to add salt as cottage cheese has plenty. I used eggbeaters for two of the eggs to reduce cholesterol .

I didn't have chives, so substituted some finely sliced fresh green onions. I really liked the result and will repeat it - for myself. There were some dissenters. (Some folks just like their eggs with nothing but S&P.)

This is a good start. I added salsa after cooking and some avocado slices. Made a great mid day meal! Thanks.

Do not like or normally eat cottage cheese.  Decided to try this recipe and it was yummy.  Did not actually taste cottage cheese, eggs just seemed creamy like the title says.

Used dried Parsley rather than Chive, seasoned with 1/4 tsp Creole Seasoning w- Lo fat Cottage Cheese. Eggs were OK but added shredded Provolone on top to add more cheese flavor.
Wife, who does not like Cottage Cheese, liked it!

I made this recipie this morning. the only change I did was for each egg I added a tablespoon of water. the cottage cheese made the eggs smooth and creamy. plus the calories are way less than regular cheese. I will definitely make this again.

I can't believe I haven't been doing this my entire life. I love this recipe because with the basic ingredients that are listed, you can play with it and make it your own. I add sliced breakfast sausage, topped with a little sharp white cheddar, and some spinach for color. Pretty fantastic, and it teaches you not to overcook your eggs, which I'm certain most of the population does!

Creamy Cottage Cheese Eggs -  How can this be good?  Had to give it a try and these scrambled eggs were fluffy and so very tasty.  From now on when I make scrambled eggs this will be the recipe I am going to use.  Oh yes, and I am keeping the  secret ingredient to my self.  A  real five star recipe.    Thanks, Rico

I have never liked cottage cheese but these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted. I don't think I will ever cook them again without. I made mine the first time with some cherrywood smoked ham. Second time I added mushrooms too but forgot the chives. You must try this. Tastes nothing like cottage cheese. Makes the eggs creamy and rich.

The way it was presented was great.  Surprised how easy it was.  Second time a added a bit of turmeric.  Kept the yellow color of the eggs/yoke.  Used spring onions and a touch of parseley. 
Again...it was easy and along with  bread...toasted...made a great breakfast

Basically, we are stretching eggs with cottage cheese instead of milk.  The result is a lighter, blander egg that pairs well with fresh fruit.

I was a bit skeptical at first but there were so many good reviews, I decided to give these a whirl. I didn't have any chives and I accidentally put the cottage cheese in with the eggs prior to cooking. It didn't matter...these were THE best scrambled eggs I've ever had. Light and fluffy with a great taste.  I plan to make scrambled eggs this way from now on.

This recipe was very delicious. My husband particularly enjoyed it. The only change I made was to add a quarter cup of sour cream and about a cup of salsa. It was creamy and so flavorful! Thanks for such a yummy, versatile recipe. I will be making this many more times, for sure.

It's a winner. Have made it several times, great for a large crowd.

I have made this type of salad and used vanilla Silk yogurt (non-dairy) for my grandson who has allergies to dairy, eggs, and peanuts.   Tastes just like a sweetened mayonnaise used for salad like Waldorf.  Yogurt works , dairy or non-dairy!

I did add a few spices. Although no sugar it had a slight sweet taste.

Was good, but just scrambled eggs.  I might have waited a hair too long before adding the cottage cheese because it didn't really incorporate into the eggs.  Didn't expect it to melt but was like scrambled eggs with cottage cheese on top.  Still, great way to boost healthy protein.  Will try again for sure but will mix the eggs and cottage cheese together before adding to the fry pan.  Thanks!

I love this recipe. It is quick, and simple to make. I didn't have chives, so I used Mrs. Dash as a substitute.

My only concern about this recipe was that no salt was in the list of ingredients. I'm happy to say, I didn't need any. The cottage cheese makes these eggs the fluffiest ones I've ever made. Who knew cottage cheese would make such a nice addition as well as adding a little extra protein?

Very good! The only change I made was I used chopped green onions instead of chives.
