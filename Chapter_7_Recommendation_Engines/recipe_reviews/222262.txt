Zucchini has a high water content.  Press several times with paper towels and hand squeeze the water out after shredding the zucchini.  This is crucial to this recipe.  We enjoyed these zucchini pancakes!

I really wanted to like this recipe, and I hate to leave a negative first review...but we couldn't eat this.  The texture of the zucchini patties was odd and the flavor of both the patties and the sauce was very, very bland.  Even after attempts to tweak the sauce, this just wasn't good.

This turned out yummy! I used green pepper instead of celery since that’s what I had on hand. I made sure to squeeze out the grated zucchini and then squish it between paper towels due to other reviews and that helped the pancakes work great! Added lots of spices since zucchini is so bland. This was definitely a fun and new way to eat zucchini! Don’t think it will go in my favorite recipe stash, but I would make it again in the future.

The flavors didn't go well together and the pancakes were wet and mushy. Would not recommend.
