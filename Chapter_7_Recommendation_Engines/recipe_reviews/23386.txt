Just amazing!  It made the Thanksgiving meal.  I used sweet sausage instead of spicy because we are a delicate group!  But it was the best dressing I have ever had, and handed out many copies of the recipe.  There were no left-overs.

My family LOVES this dressing. They want it even when it is not a holiday. Freezes well before baked, so make it up ahead of time.

This was the most outstanding accompanimemnt to our Thanksgiving turkey. We opted for a sweet Italian turkey sausage, and used a poultry seasoning instead of purchasing all the individual spices. This is far more flavorful than any  plain bread stuffing I've ever had.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving but I did not put the apples, I did however add chopped hard boiled eggs and some bellpepper.  I also used the stock from the turkey for the finishing flavor.  THE BEST DRESSING EVER, Better than my own Grandma's!

EXCELLENT RECIPE AS STATED. THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFRENT WAS TO BAKE THE CORN BREAD MIX IN A 9X13 BAKING DISH THEN SLICED IT INTO 1 INCH CUBES AND FLUFFED WITH A FORK AFTER IT COOLED. I THINK IT GAVE THE DISH A BETTER VISUAL EFFECT RATHER THEN CRUMBLING THE CORN BREAD INTO A BOWL AS THE RECIPE STATES. WILL DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN.

Great recipe!!! I used turkey sausage, added a box of stuffing, cream of mushroom, cream of celery, and quadrupled the chicken broth.

I made this recipe at Thanksgiving. I was very worried about changing our standard dressing we have every year, but my family loved it. The best judge was my son who is the pickiest eater in the world and he kept talking about how much he loved the dressing. I didn't change any part of the recipe. This is my every Thanksgiving dressing now.

Everyone loved this dressing! I made a few changes of my own,of course. I used Jimmy Dean Maple sausage instead of hot sausage and it was excellent with the apples. I mixed 2 batches at one time, and it seemed a little too dry ,so I added 1 cup of apple cider. The cider made the dressing. Thanks for the great idea.

FABULOUS!!! I made it for the first time for Thanksgiving and my family LOVED it!! Hubby has requested we stick to this recipe! I used sweet italian bulk sausage, because that's what I had on hand and I wasn't tryin to make a trip to the store the day before Thanksgiving!! LOL I used poultry seasonings instead of individual spices (again, thats what I had on hand) which worked LOVELY! I didn't measure, I just dumped some in! I also used some of the turkey drippings instead of chicken broth and I omitted the butter (out of sheer forgetfulness) I will experiment with adding an egg and more broth next time because it was a bit dry for my taste. DEFINITELY a 'keeper recipe' Thanks!! =)

This is a very delicious dressing!  I've made it twice now and my husband has loved it each time.  When I made it for thanksgiving I added some ground turkey to give extra meat and I used maple flavored pork sausage to add to the sweetness.  Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving and I find myself craving it often.  Really good recipe!

This was excellent. I made it first for a carry-in luncheon, and the second time at my daughter's for Thanksgiving. I will make it again and again. I don't remember cornbread dressing ever tasting this good.

I think I'll stick to my mother's recipe. This was good but I enjoy her version better, it's base is a little more savory and she cuts up cooked turkey breast meat or the boiled insides (neck, gizzards, & heart) of the turkey and adds it to the dressng. I suppose it just depends on your taste, but the sausage version didn't work for my family.

Made this today and it was very good.  The fried apples were such a nice sweet surprise.  I followed the recipe with the following exceptions:  used sage sausage (not hot), omitted the rosemary (didn't have any) & cooked for 30 minutes (to avoid drying out).  Otherwise, followed to the letter.  All the "big kids" liked it and had extra helpings!! ;)  Thanks for sharing Donna!!

Thank you for the best cornbread dressing recipe! I searched and ended up using this recipe and it was so delicious. I did use Jimmy Dean's maple sausage which was very good and I used Jiffy mix cornbread. I also made one and a half of the recipe and we ate it all. I still baked it in a 9x13 pan. I'm not sure just making the normal recipe would've fed us all. That was my only regret, I didn't have any leftovers...the 15 of us devoured it. The amount of spices is perfect; I did add extra broth...just preference. I prepared the stuffing the day before then baked it on Thanksgiving. This is my family's favorite cornbread stuffing recipe!

I made this recipe for my first Thanksgiving  with just  me and my boyfriend and we loved it!  He finished  it  in  like 3 days because he liked it so much. I didn't add the apples  because I really don't like apples in foods like these, and I also added my own seasonings and it turned out just great. My boyfriend has been asking for me to make this again ever since, so I am making it right now and surprise him for when he gets off work. 2 thumbs up on a great recipe!!

This is amazing!  Our new Thanksgiving Dressing recipe for sure.  I used fresh herbs instead of dried since I had them on hand.  Next time I will make my cornbread from scratch only because the boxed stuff has some undesirable ingredients that I'm trying to stay away from.  But really super, super!!

Excellent! Didn't have apples, so I used firm pears; omitted celery; reduced to 8 servings and still used a full lb of sausage... wonderful!  Will make this again and again!  Thanks!  Update: made again this year exactly as recipe called for... this is delish!  All four kids - ages 2 to 13 - eat it up and ask for more!  My husband loves it and he doesn't hesitate to complain!  Ha!  We love this stuffing!  Thanks again!

Absolutely wonderful.  I have used my recipe for dressing for years and always thought it was pretty good.   Today, I was looking for something a little different to go with baked pork chops and came across this recipe.  Gave it a try, and sure glad I did.  The seasonings were perfect.   I'll trash my old recipe and stick with this one from now on!!

I'm the only one in my family that easts cornbread dressing. I followed the recipe to the letter. As you can imagine it made far too much for one person. I cut the left over dressing in to small sections and froze them. I'm pleased to say they freeze well and heat up nicely. Good recipe.

Very good, very similar to my great aunt's recipe!  I baked Bob's Red Mill gluten free corn bread, let cool and then cut into 1/2" pieces and crumbled a bit.  To make this like my aunt's stuffing, I did make the following changes: 1) 1 onion, 2) added a cup of pre-made wild rice, 3) added one beaten egg to the liquid mixture, 4) used mild itallian sauage. My aunt usually chops a can or two of mushrooms and adds this to the saute mix.  Also, her base is Stove Top Stuffing (traditional) made as directed on the box.  She does added extra sage and spices.

I have been using this recipe for 2 years now and I am just now getting around to reviewing it.  It has been a hit at our last 2 Thanksgiving dinners and I plan to keep this recipe around for a long time!  I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out great everytime.  The spicy sausage makes this dressing!

Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. It was the first time I ever made cornbread dressing and the first time I ever used sausage in a dressing.  This was delicious. Everyone loved it.  But honestly next time I will make it without the sausage. Just my preference. I think I like dressing without sausage better. But for sure I will definitely be making cornbread stuffing instead of regular stuffing from now on! I also had to make this gluten free so I made gluten free corn bread but no one knew the difference! I also added more broth as others suggested.

Easy and impressive. My guests all rated this the best of the sides we served. I used two boxes of Jiffy corn muffin mix. Dried it out over two days. Added dried cranberries to the mix which gave it a vibrant look on the table. I also beat two eggs and added it to the mix before I baked it.

Being from Georgia my family has eaten cornbread dressing during the holidays for as long as I can remember.  I love this recipe because it is SOOOO easy to make it Gluten Free.  I just make my own GF cornbread instead of using the packaged stuff.  I also substitute dried cranberries for the chopped apple, but that is just a personal preference.  I "eyeball" the butter, broth and seasonings just like my mom and grandma did. I also wanted to add that if you don't have all the separate spices listed (except the salt and pepper, obviously) you can use Poultry Seasoning.  It already has the spices pre-combined.   :)

I didn't care for this recipe but am giving it 3 stars because some of my family liked it.  Will not make again.  I prefer regular stuffing over cornbread stuffing.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was the star of the meal!!  Made exactly as stated but halfed the recipe and couple minor adjustments.  Omitted the oil since sausage had plenty once cooked, added 1 beaten egg, added full amount of broth 3/4 c. for half recipe.  Came out wonderful with the spiciness of the sausage and the sweetness of the cornbread and apples.

I made this for Thanksgiving - I am a first time stuffing maker - and everyone loved it! There weren't many of us, but all of it was gone! I didn't use any parsley because I thought I had some and didn't, and I used fresh chopped sage. Yum!

I found the original recipe to be a bit sweet, so the next time I made it, I decreased the apples to 1 apple and increased the sausage to 2 lbs of sausage.  This did the trick.  The dressing was the perfect combination of sweet, spicy and meaty. My in-laws were raving about the dish during last year's Thanksgiving and it was also approved my my critical mother during the following Christmas dinner where I used it as the stuffing for my Cornish Hens.   I will definite use this recipe again.

Best dressing I've had!  I made it straight and it was fantastic, 5 stars as written. I've made it several times since then and I've added 6 boiled eggs, chopped, to the recipe.  Also, I now make this with day old italian bread instead of the corn bread, but only because my husband is not a big fan of corn bread. This recipe will be a holiday tradition from now on!

I liked this very much. I used pork sausage with sage but added only one teaspoon of the rubbed sage. I only had one apple to use and I used two cups of chicken broth. The rest of the ingredients as stated. Very good compliments and I will make time and again. Thanks for the very nice recipe.

For Thanksgiving this year I wanted to try something different, but was hesitant to change an already good thing. This recipe was perfect! It had the flavor of our family recipe but had just the right amount of change to keep things interesting. It came out great and EVERYONE wanted the recipe! Thanks!

This was some of the best stuffing I've ever had. Changes I made were: no celery (husband hates it), turkey breakfast sausage and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Also, I didn't actually bake it at the end. I just served it as it is, mainly because I ran out of time. Still awesome!

Five star all the way!!! I made this for Thanksgiving and am making it again for Christmas. I made gluten free cornbread and diced it instead of crumbeling it. I recommend Fluffy Gluten Free Cornbread reciepe on Allrecieps, it's very good.

First time I've had corn bread stuffing and must say its very good.  The whole apple and sausage thing I've been doing for years in regular stuffing. Was a little dryer but will add more stock next time.  Corn bread is just kinda dry to began with.  Cant wait to bring this to the family's table next Thanksgiving!

Oops forgot to add. 
I baked the cornbread from a mix the night before , then cut in  it in cubes. The next morning I placed bread cubes on cookie sheet to dry baking it  in the oven  at 350 degrees for about 15-20 minutes. Bread was dry and golden brown.

The flavors that come out in this stuffing recipe are amazing.  Especially since I used fresh herbs.  Costs a bit more but the satisfaction in the taste is worth it to me.  I was a bit confused with the cornbread amount since I didn't get an 8oz mix, so I added a bit more chicken broth since my mixture seemed a little dry.  Nothing worse than dry stuffing!  And I used sausage with sage flavor.  Very satisfied with this dish!

Awesome use for leftover cornbread! I scaled the recipe to the amount of leftover cheddar cornbread I had and made enough for two entree-sized portions in the same dish the cornbread had been in (win). Subbed crumbled Gardein veg-sausage for the sausage and added red pepper flakes. Serving #2 will be a great reheated breakfast!

Turned out great!! I treat all recipes as starting points, and make adjustments according to our tastes... but I really didn’t change much for this one! I doubled it, but I rarely measure much of anything. Instead of using 2lbs of spicy ground sausage (we used Jimmie Dean), I used one spicy and one Sage flavored.... and like many others, I used poultry seasoning - with a bit extra dried rosemary because we love it. For the cornbread, I used 2 pkg of Jiffy brand the night before, and that morning sliced it into approx 1” cubes & fluffed a bit with a fork (per another reviewer’s suggestion) and placed it in my convection toaster oven (275 for 30-45 min... fluffing periodically to keep it uniform). Next time I’ll probably make the pieces a bit smaller or just crumble it. I didn’t add any salt, and didn’t miss it (I figure there’s enough of it in the sausage, etc) and instead of regular pepper, I added several healthy dashes of Lawry’s Seasoned Pepper because we add it to everything! I used 3 apples instead of the four (for doubled recipe) because that’s all I had - but I think I’d try to add a bit MORE than asked for of both the apples & celery, as cornbread is pretty dry by nature. This was my first time making stuffing of ANY kind, and I think it turned out great!! Next time I’ll make the cornbread pieces smaller and maybe add more liquid (butter, broth and wet ingredients like celery & apples) as overall it was a BIT dry, but that’s prob my fault! Thanks for the recipe!!

For the  5th Thanksgiving, this recipe has been a big hit.  This year, we used a combination of cornbread and sour dough breads that we had earlier made from scratch, cubed and put in the freezer, which made assembly a breeze.  We love the flavors the cooked onions, apples and celery add to the sausage and breads.  A new family favorite!

This recipe has given me the base for the dressing I remember Grandmother Ella making. I use turkey sausage because we don’t eat pork and add diced apples for awesome flavor. If I’m cooking a turkey I use the neck to make broth and use the shredded meat, liver and gizzards in the dressing like Grandmother showed me. Always turns out great. Because she taught me you can’t eat everybody’s dressing this recipes ensures I have the all important dressing flavor on my plate for Thanksgiving and Christmas!

I followed the recipe closely. Stuffing came out perfectly. Nothing but raves at dinner. Plan to make again

Made this last Thanksgiving...Loved it...only thing I did different as well is no spicy sausage and no apples...I would love to use the apples but I have a Fructose Intolerant Grandchild  and apples are High Fructose.  If I make it when she isn't here...Apples sound WONDERFUL. Can't wait to try it with apples.

I have been making this for holiday dinners for a few years now. I love it!!! I always try to make extra in hopes of leftovers. You can mix it up a day or two ahead of time and leave it in the fridge. Makes holiday cooking so much easier.

I've made this several times for Thanksgiving/Christmas dinners and it's always a crowd pleaser!  I've stuck to the original recipe, no changes needed.

Very good recipe.  Made some adjustments with amounts of spices and omitted bell pepper.  Made cornbread from scratch just because we don't like the mixes.   Cut down on the light bread slices to 8.  It was delicious.  Will be making this again.

Great flavor! Everyone loved the stuffing, I didn't have any leftover! It adds a nice variety of flavor with the cornbread -- saving for next year!

I've made the Grandma's Cornbread Dressing recipe from this site for Thanksgiving for a few years now, and while it was always good, I felt like it was missing something to put it over the top.  I added apples and sausage per this recipe, and it was AWESOME. Best batch of dressing I've ever made, and my family loved it.  I used one gala apple and a few leftover green apple slices, and sage sausage. I love the amount of onion and celery in this recipe, but I did use a lot more chicken broth (a full box, maybe 3 cups) since I made a bigger batch and because I've been taught it should look pretty wet before going in the oven.  I cooked the cornbread a day before and let it dry on the counter overnight.  I made my cornbread using the 8 oz. jiffy corn muffin boxes (3 so I could make a large lasagna pan full of dressing), which is a little sweet-- the sweetness from the cornbread combined with the apples was perfect. I know how I'll make my dressing from now on.

This is my first time making this type of stuffing. I misread the directions. I failed to take the sausage out of the pan when I added the celery and onions. It turned out good, but the next time I cook this, I will use the vegetable oil. I will cook the sausage till it is brown, then I will add the celery and onions. I did not add any apples because my daughter is allergic to apples.

I make this every year for thanksgiving. I sub half of the cornbread with cubed ciabatta and toast it in the oven until lightly browned. It gives the stuffing more body and texture. Everyone raves. Makes awesome leftovers too!

I used sweet turkey Italian sausage instead of spicy sausage and I crumbled fresh biscuits along with the cornbread. I used a little celery salt instead of regular salt and added an additional cup of broth.  This dressing was awesome, it only made it one day. I'll definitely me making this again for Christmas.

Cooked for Thanksgiving yesterday and it is the best dressing I've ever made. 

Made the night before and smelled great, but the flavor was even better the next day.  Will be on our list for future needs for sure.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful and tasty dish.

I would give this 3.5 stars if that was an option.  I wanted to love this, but it needs some work.  Way too dry.  I tried maple sausage as some suggested and I wish I had used spicy.  The maple sausage just made it too sweet for my liking.  The flavor was good, so with some tweaks this could be a great dressing.

I only give 4 stars because I didn't actually eat any, I took it to work for Christmas last year, but had to leave sick before we ate. I heard it was good, it looked good, and was very easy to make. I am making it again tomorrow for our dinner this year. I will check back after I get some of it. :)

This was SO good. The only thing I wish I would've done was add a little more chicken broth and butter. I halved the recipe so I used a square baking dish. I'm pretty sure it's an 8 inch square dish. I reduced the bake time because the 8 inch square dish is still a little larger than half a 9x13 dish. However, I don't think that had to do with it being a little too dry for my taste. The mixture itself did seem a little dry. I also left out the apples because I don't care for them much in my dressing. I will definitely be making this again, but just with a little more butter and chicken broth!

I make this for thanksgiving every year and get requested to make it!  I don't make any alterations to the recipe either.  Sometimes i'll try and get the jimmy dean sage sausage if its available, but regular works just the same.

wonderful. Add  raisons. Made some chicken gravy to go with it.  Would rather strain the fat off the sausage and make sausage gravy next time.

I made this as written and it was really good. It came out very moist, I do not like dry dressing. I used maple sausage just to add to the sweetness and it was a hit!

I made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year and it is amazing!  The only thing I added was ground red pepper for a little extra spice and flavor and a ton more broth for continual moisture.  It will now be a family staple.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I made it pretty much as written except I used a package of mexican cornbread instead of one of the packages of regular cornbread plus I added one jalapeno.  What can I say--we had a tex mex Thanksgiving this year.  I definitely recommend this recipe and will use it going forward (maybe not with the mexican cornbread mix next time!).
