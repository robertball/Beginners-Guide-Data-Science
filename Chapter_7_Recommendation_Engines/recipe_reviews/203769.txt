Delish! I thought the mayo sauce was a tad on the bland side the original way so I modified it to my liking, which is great about recipies! I used the same amount of mayo, 1 tsp of dill, 1/2 tsp lemon pepper, tad bit more cracked black pepper, salt, and it was PERFECT!!!!! I think the lemon pepper was key. Just a few shakes goes a long way. Turkey bacon for a little healther fat, and whole wheat buns, added sauce to fish and to buns.... THANK YOU!! =)

10 star recipe! This was absolutely fantastic. I don't think I've ever had salmon and bacon together and wow, what a perfect pair. The dill sauce was a perfect compliment. Definitely will be making this again. Thanks! :)

This was an excellent recipe.  I made one small change - I applied the sauce to the salmon BEFORE grilling, and also used it as suggested on the sandwich itself.  Yum!

Awesome sandwich!  I took the advice of others and used 1/2 tsp lemon pepper rather than the lemon zest.  Also added more pepper to the mayo mixture and put some salt and pepper on the salmon too.  Put a bit of the mayo on the fish when I grilled it and it just grilled up beautifully!  Delicious!

This wasn't bad, but wasn't anything special, either.  With all of the recipes available, I don't see myself making this again.  Plus, it was very messy, and was actually quite annoying to have it dripping all over my hands and arms.  The only time that is okay with me is if the taste is a 5star.

I made this sandwich and used a toasted ciabatta roll (which made the sandwich perfect) seasoned fish with blacken seasoning.  The mayo sauce was good but needed tweeking.  Top with lettuce, garden fresh tomato and red onion.. one delicious sandwich

Awesome!  I did make a few changes to get it a little healthier.  I used no-fat mayo and put turkey bacon on it rather than regular bacon.  This I prepared by tossing it in the oven rather than in a skillet.  For more dill flavor I put chunks of pickle in the sauce as well.  Great recipe!!

Great crunch and saltiness with the bacon. This was a winner and we'll definitely make it again.  The sauce was great, but I did add some cracked pepper and a little more lemon zest than it called for.

We had some leftover wild grilled salmon and made up this sandwich. The sauce was very good, I did make it hours ahead so the flavors had time to meld together. We warmed the salmon. Nice for summer nights.

this was pretty good.  I didn't care for the sauce, however.  The lemon overpowered.  I'm going to try again and do something different with the sauce.  Perhaps add a little mustard powder.

Very good. The bacon and salmon paired up nicely together. I think the mayo needs a lil work. Maybe a squeeze of lemon and letting the flavors mend together for a while will help. All in all a great sandwich.

Much better than I thought it would be. Cooked the salmon in the oven (375 for 10 minutes) and added black pepper to the mayo per the other reviews. It was the perfect summer sandwich.

Good reviews from the family!! Used cast iron frying pan, buns from freezer, left over greens, and lime instead of lemon.  Great last minute decision for weeknight dinner. No bacon but wasn't missed.

My first thought was -- salmon on a bun?  My second thought --- bacon with salmon??  Glad I tried it.  It was messy to eat, and messy on the barbecue, but worth it --- delicious.

I personally accepted the tangy flavor of the sauce and I think It was ok, but hubby didn't like it at all and he asked me to make his sandwich without the sauce next time. The salmon sandwich idea itself was great, I had leftover salmon from the day before that wasn't enough for two if eaten alone, but would be filling if combined with bread.

Good, refreshing and very easy to make. A great Springtime lunch idea. I did season the salmon a bit with some salt , pepper, and fresh italian herbs. I also added horseradish to the mayo and this sandwich was awesome. A great healthy meal.

Probably a matter of taste, but I didn't care for the slight sweetness in the mayo and the lemon tones in this sandwich. It wasn't bad, but not my favorite either.

Recipie was OK - can easily be five stars with a few additions:
- season the fish!! I used a cayenne rub to add a little heat 
- don't toast the bread, butter then use the skillet used for the bacon to brown the bread (just drain fat)
- dill sauce: don't sky on zest or dill, 
- three words: pickled red onions!!!
