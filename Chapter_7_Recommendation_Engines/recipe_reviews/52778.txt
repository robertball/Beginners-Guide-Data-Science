I thought this was okay but my husband didn't care for it. It seemed so simple so we gave it a try. Will probably not make again.

I love it!  I used some beautiful and delicious cherry tomatoes from the farmers market! For around 8 of them I pour half a spoon of honey and they are so good! I think the results will not be the same if the tomatoes are not really tasty and the same goes with honey! I love  using breitsamer golden selection raw honey! Thanks for the recipe!

Meh It wasn't horrible. Just OK. Nothing special about it. I used grape tomatoes but didn't make any other changes. I think I would have rather just eaten the tomatoes by themselves than with the honey.
