We loved this, and we don't have any kids.  There are a few things I did differently though.  First, you MUST bake your fries for 10 mins.  This prevents them from becoming soggy and watering up your whole dish.  Second, I don't agree with the mushroom soup, because your typical cheeseburger doesn't have mushrooms.  I think that's what made others' taste "off".  So I substituted tomato.  As visually unappealing as it was, the combo of these 2 soups was oh so good.  I also use Campbells Healthy Request soup and lowfat cheddar because I'm on WW.  Should you do the same, you'll need to season the beef a little bit with salt, pepper and garlic powder (I have them all mixed together in a shaker.  1/2 tsp should do it.) to compensate for the lower sodium.  My husband said it was surprisingly delicious!!

Update:  I made this a while back and had no golden mushroom soup, so I used 3/4 cup lite sour cream.  It was delicious!  I've also used nacho-cheese soup in this recipe, and it is also great.  My family prefers tater tots to fries on this casserole, and I always bake them until they're crisp before putting them on the casserole.
Original review: My kids really liked this.  They gave it a five.  I'd give it a three and a half if I could, but rated it a four because the rest of the family liked it.  I didn't change anything except adding garlic, oregano, a little worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper, but the next time I make it, I will make some changes.  For example -- next time, I'll pre-cook the fries.  Though I bought the extra-crispy version, the fries were soggy.  I'll prebake next time, and might use waffle fries instead of regular, or even the extra-crispy tater tots.  The bottom line with this recipe is that it's a plain, easy week-night meal that won't threaten your kids.  UPDATE:  I made this again last night, and the changes I made improved it vastly -- I prebaked OreIda's Crispy Battered Fries for almost thirty minutes on 425, so they were nice and crunchy.  This cut down on the cooking time of the entire dish, as I only had to melt the cheese rather than wait for the fries to bake.  I subbed nacho flavored cheese soup for the cheddar, and added a dollop (about a quarter of a cup) of sour cream to the meat mixture.  Excellent!

Mmmmmm..very good! I took another's advice about blandness due to not enough seasonings so I was VERY generous. I added about/more 1 1/2tsp salt, 2 tsp pepper, 1 1/4 tsp garlic powder to ground beef mixture and than added a dash of salt and pepper to the fries before placing in oven. End result was delicious!! We served with ketchup at table, and my fussy 3 & 6 yr old's ate seconds! Must admit, I was very unsure about the end result due to the odd mixtures and about all the reviews about blandness, but it was very simple to make and a big time family pleaser, just don't be shy with the salt, pepper and garlic powder. Thanx for sharing Bettina!! Our family loves it!

This was a great, kid friendly meal.  I only used 1 pound of meat and then used cream of mushroom soup instead of golden mushroom.  I also added a can of green beans and a can of corn so we'd have our veggies in there!  I baked the fries for about 10 minutes before adding to the top of the casserole and they came out nice and crisp!

I just found this recipe online but I have been making something similar to it for awhile now. I always add minced garlic to my ground beef and onions while cooking. Also, I buy the seasoned steak fries and they are NEVER soggy. I think it depends on the fries you buy on whether or not they turn out soggy. Also, I have always used 2 cans each of the cheddar cheese soup and the golden mushroom. I just made it for my in-laws Saturday and there wasn't anything left and they wanted me to cook it again and it has only been four days!!!

Very quick and easy dish.  I served it with ketchup for the kids.  Next time I will add extra cheese soup, it just wasn't cheesy enough for my tastes.  Also I will cook it longer next time, my fries came out soggy but tasty nonetheless.  This is a good recipe to whip together after a hectic day.

Super, kid-friendly meal.  The key is seasoning your ground beef properly. If you're saying this recipe is bland, it's probably because you didn't add enough salt, pepper and garlic to your meat. Also, it's great with ketchup and mustard - added at the table.

My family loved this recipe.  They suggested using different types of frozen potatoes each time we try it to see what our favorite might be.  I used shoestring this time, but think I will try tator tots next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked this one night for my boyfriend and I and it was AWFUL! The recipe was easy enough, but it was very bland and had no taste. Won't make this one again.

My kids loved this recipe...even my husband ate second helpings.  I made two changes, based on other comments.  I used tomato soup instead of mushroom, and I cooked the fries for ten minutes while I was browning the ground beef.  I will be making this again.

I loved this recipe. After every bite I kept saying "Yummm." I was a bit leery to try this b/c I hate mushrooms and I'm not wild about frozen fries and when I added the soups to the beef it looked like Hamburger Helper. When I tasted it I was surprised. I skipped the extra salt and just sprinkled liberally with pepper and garlic powder and it was perfectly seasoned. When I took it out of the oven I topped my serving with pickle slices and ketchup and mustard and had no problem with blandness, like other reviewers said. This tasted like McDonalds burgers. I had three (small) helpings! Thank you for sharing Bettina. Another Allrecipes success! ***Added later*** I always use curly fries with this recipe, and have found that if you cook them a bit first (just stick them in the oven as it's preheating and you're cooking the beef on the stove) the recipe does turn out better.

This a great quick and easy dinner on a cold winter night, it's so comforting.  Instead of french fries I used tatter tots.  The kids go crazy when I make this.

Definite husband pleaser and so easy!  I added a can of Rotel tomatoes to the beef/soup mix.  Added just the right kick!
***Made it again last week, as written, and got raves again from the family!  Sometimes simple really is best!

I made this because I had everything it called for and needed something quick. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but did add some minced garlic to the meat and onions. My fries were not soggy. It was quick, easy and my husband ate two big helpings. I followed some of the advice and put out condiments. I will definitely make this again when in a pinch.

I made this per recipe except I baked the fries for about 10 minutes. I didn't want 'soggy' french fries. They came out very good in the end. I think next time I'll add some Worcestershire when cooking the hamburg and onions.

Different but good, it is fast and easy and my family liked it.  Maybe not a five star dish but it is satisfying and quick.  I was really tempted to stray from the recipe and use cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden, but I made as written and the hamburger had a nice taste.  I agree with other reviewers that if yours is bland you didn't season the meat enough.  I didn't think it was necessary to cook the fries first, however, my fries were still not golden after 30 minutes, so I broiled them for a little bit (watched carefully) before putting the cheese on.  Fries were nice and crispy.  Definitely will make again.  Serving with ketchup is a must :)  Update: I have learned a few things after making this a couple of times.  First is that no extra salt is needed, there is enough salt in the condensed soups and the cheese (and also the fries if they are pre-seasoned).  Second, smaller fries like shoestring work the best.  I've tried regular and crinkle cut and it takes too long for them to cook and the thicker cut takes away from the flavor of the casserole.  Third, pre-seasoned fries seem to go over better, and lastly, I would eat this the same day it is made, keep in mind you don't usually eat fries as leftovers so the same goes for the casserole, they tend to dry out after a day.

It is a very quick and easy recipe.  But, not a good one for teenage kids.  Tastes ALOT like Hamberger Helper but a bit blander.  Was not a big hit in our household.

This was really yummy. I didn't make in a 9 x 13 pan because I cooked the meat in a cast iron frying pan I could put right in the oven. For people that say the mushroom soup taste odd you really must use the golden mushroom as it is a really different taste. I had no problem with soggy fries but you really need to make sure the meat mixture is well heated

I made this last night for my babysitter, daughter and roommate (before he left for the night) as my boyfriend and I were going out to celebrate my birthday. When I came home, there was only one small serving left. Curious, I asked how they had liked it and they said "it was awesome!" Since there was only a little left, I thought I would re-heat and try it to. Perhaps it is only good once it is first made but I thought the re-heated version was NOT very good. To me, it was bland and almost tasteless...even after the addition of some s&p. I might make it again because my daughter reminded me this morning that it was great but play around with it.

This was a great casserole. I used a whole small onion, no condensed mushroom soup (I didn't have any so I mixed one cup of water to a package of mushroom gravy), and I used tater tots in place of the fries. Turned out wonderful and everyone wanted seconds. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this a few times as written and yes, it is a bit bland.  I just use extra seasoning and a little dijon mustard in the soup mix and it's great.  Tonight I wanted to make this, but I was out of the soups.  I used Manwich instead and it was super good.  This is a great starter recipe and very family friendly.

This was really good.  I used tator tots instead of fries.  Served it with chopped tomatoes, pickles and mustard.  Yum!

This was a quick tasty dinner.  I wouldn't serve it to guests but it was yummy nonetheless.  Accidentally used cream of mushroom instead of golden mushroom but we still liked it.  Next time I think I'll try bacon on top with the cheese.

My Family loves this easy & tasty recipe! Frankly, the 1st time I read it, I thought it sounded horrible. But, I had all the ingredients on hand which meant I didn't have to run to the grocery store. So, I tried it & I'm glad I did b/c fast, easy, tasty & budget-friendly. I like to add the same seasoning I would normally add to the ground beef were I making cheeseburgers: Salt, Pepper, Ranch & a little Worcestire. Yum!

Excellent for the whole family with a squirt of ketchup and mustard on top.  I add little pieces of bacon and make it a bacon cheeseburger casserole.

I also changed it up a bit after reading the reviews. I didn't have the soups so I substituted tomato and cream of chicken and omitted the onion. I sprinkled minced onion and garlic salt on the hamburger while cooking. After mixing with the hamburger, I added 1/2 cup ketchup and 2T mustard for more of a cheeseburger feel. I layered the hamburger mixture, cubed velveeta cheese and then the fries and cooked at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. My husband, who is my picky eater, said it was "awesome!"

I made mine all in an iron skillet then baked it in the same skillet! Easy! Served with catsup, mustard & pickles. I used lots more fries than the recipe called for. My husband & 10 year old loved it. My daughter said she would choose this over ice cream.

Reminded me of a shepards pie with french fries. Everyone said it was just okay. Won't be making again. The leftovers went to waste.

I loved this recipe. I too, like many others, changed it up a bit. Let the french fries cook for awhile before putting them in the hotdish. I used two cans of cheddar cheese soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup. I added oregeno and montreal steak seasoning to it. GREAT!!

Wonderful dish! Was missing the can of cheddar cheese soup... I used a nice sized hunk of Velveeta cheese (about half cup) and added a little milk to pan stirred till creamy then added the cream of mushroom soup. Did everything else as recommended and it was great!! Kids and husband ate it all up!!

I really enjoyed this !  I used chopped red onion, added a few squirts of hot sauce just for a bite and added a cup of shredded cheddar to the mix.  I then topped with crispy crowns vs. frenchfries.  Once the crispy crowns were cooked, I topped with a cup of shredded cheddar and baked until melted. Very fun, comfy food ! (Almost forgot,, I used cream of mushroom soup and seasoned with McCormick California Garlic salt- has parsley added)

I used left over homeade chili and mixed a can of cheddar cheese soup with the chili before putting it into the dish.  If you use Extra Crispy Fast Fries they don't get soggy.  Delicious alternative

Thumbs up! The kids loved it! I cooked the fries first like other comments, until they were crispy. I took it a step further and put a layer of fries on the bottom, and on the top. It's a keeper. Thanks!

Just "meh" for us. Not bad / Not spectacular.  It was a nice change, and topped with mustard made it better for me.  I only used 1 lb of beef, seasoned with 1/2 pkg dry onion soup, Worcestershire, garlic, cayenne, and a couple spoonfuls of FF Sour Cream.  (Prebaked the Tater Tot "Crowns").  Used tomato soup, instead of mushroom.   Topped the cheese layer with a few bacon bits.  (This was an awesome recipe to help clean out your cupboards, though!)

This is a great basic recipe but needed more flavor. I used the cream of cheese soup but substituted the cream of mushroom with cream of celery (it's what I had on hand). While browning the ground beef, I added 1 pkg. of Lipton Onion Soup mix, no other seasoning. I layered the meat mixture with ketchup, then tater tots. After cooking, I added grated cheese to cover. My 18-year-old daughter, her boyfriend, my 23-year-old son, and his girlfriend all loved it!

The mushroom soup scared me a bit, so I used tomato soup as others recommended. Seasoned the meat with Weber's Gourmet Burger seasoning and garlic powder while baking the fries in the oven. Turned out pretty good, nothing amazing but good comfort food.

This turned out to be really suprizing.  We were very pleased with the taste.  I think when I make this again, I will add 2 cans of cheese soup, just because we really like cheese.  Thank You for the recipe.

This was a different recipe from the type I usually try, but I was pleased nonetheless!  I only used 1 lb. of ground beef and that seemed like plenty to me.  Also, my grocery was out of Condensed Chedder Soup, so I used Fiesta Nacho instead.  It was ok-added a little spice, but I would like to have had the plain cheddar.  I'll probably make it again sometime!

Because of the mixed reviews I wasn't sure if
I would care for this. The whole family enjoyed it. I made it exactly to the recipe but cut everything in half. Quick and easy to make. These soups are a little high in salt so don't over season the beef. We'll have this again.

I was really disappointed with this. Ok, so I wasn't expecting it to be a gourmet's delight, but I thought it might be tasty. I have never tasted/used either of the soups, and I thought they were absolutely horrible - especially the so-called 'cheese' soup. Ghastly!! Also, the fries topping browned on top but was really soggy underneath. I won't be making this again. Sorry.

I already had a very similiar recipe to this one that I had gotten off a different website. The recipe that I have didn't have the cheese and onion in it though. When I make it I always top it off with ketchup and mustard to add more flavor. You could also top it off with pickles and chopped tomato to add more taste to it. Topping it off with ingredients like that make it taste more like a real "cheeseburger and fries."

I make this and my kids love it. For those saying its bland, I made a few changes... I use a maple bacon BBQ sauce in with the beef and chedder soup, and omit the mushroom soup. It's a hit every single time!

I have made a similar recipe for years, skipping the stove top cooking and just mixing everything together in the casserole dish, not using raw onion, but using 2 scoops of French Onion dip, with broccoli & cheese soup not mushroom.  With fries on top, cover with foil for 30 minutes, then foil off for 15 minutes (or til fries are golden). Much easier and very little clean up.

Had a pound of hamburger and didnt know what to do with it and came across this recipe. Turned out fantastic, only a tiny piece survived for leftovers between 3 of us. Did a few things different from the recipe. Only used one can of mushroom soup and a 1/4 cup cream. Seasoned the burger with salt, pepper and minced garlic and a little bit of cheese wizz and worcestershire sauce.  Chopped up some broccoli to put in with the onions. I didnt like the idea of fries or tator tots but to each their own. I used frozen shredded hashbrowns and they made a great crust on top. Put a little ketchup on mine when i ate it but it was delicious by itself. This will definitely get made again

Very good & easy! I used 2 cans of cheese soup and omitted the mushroom soup. Extra garlic. I had no problem with soggy french fries. When serving I gave a swirl of mustard & katchep and sprinkeled chopped dill pickel, just like a fast food burger! Very good and great left-overs.

I changed a few things and my family can't get enough-they want it everynight.  Instead of 2 lbs of ground beef I use 1 lb beef and 1 lb ground elk(Husband and in-laws love to hunt:)).  I will also brown the meat a little longer. Also I use Cheddar cheese soup and 1/3 can milk. Then I will add the cheese and taters and cook for 35 mins. The other thing is I use Tater Crowns(the flat tater tots).

My husband loved it! Although like the other reviewers I also baked the fries in the oven for 10 minutes prior to crisp them up and I substituted cream of mushroom for golden mushroom soup.

One of our family favorites! Have to use the Golden Mushroom soup for it to taste right, kind of adds a Lipton Onion Soup Burger taste to it. We always drizzle ketchup over our portions to our own tastes and I like to use seasoned salt instead of the salt and pepper. Great for those picky eaters and if you dice up onions and peppers very tiny, you might just get some veggies in them too!

I was excited because the concept sounded good. I follwed the recipe to a tee because I was mainly making it so that my 3 year old would eat it. The casserole came out soggy and bland and did not taste good at all. I couldn't even finish what was on my plate. My 3 year old who loves cheeseburgers and fries even pushed his plate away and asked for yogurt to eat instead. I will not be making this again.

This was so easy to make that my 11 year old daughter was able to make it.  A lot of flavor to it but I think the next time that it's made we will put in more cheese soup.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!

we loved it! I halved the ingredients, since it's just the hubby and me, and instead of using half a can of each soup I just used one full can of cheese soup. I also shredded a little bit of american cheese and sprinkled it over the beef/soup mixture. I used frozen corn as well and topped it all off with some curly fries!

I tweaked this recipe and it came out really good! I pre-cooked the fries like a lot of reviewers said. I used onion powder and garlic salt to season the beef. I didn't have cheddar cheese soup, so I used 5 slices of American cheese instead, and melted them with the beef. I also used a can of tomato soup instead of mushroom, for personal preferences. I added a large dollop of sour cream as well. Then I added the pre-cooked fries and cheddar cheese, let it melt in the oven and it was quite delicious! I think I enjoyed it more than my kids.

Mmmmmm, very yummy and easy to make. I made 2 of these, one to take to a potluck and one for my family. I also made one with tator tots (cook these about 10 min before adding to top) and one with french fries.

I use tater tots on this and bake them first so they don't get mushy when added to the casserole.  I make it with regular cream of mushroom soup and add in a can of green beans.

This was great!  I made this for 4 servings because I was cooking for two.  The only change I made (intentionally) was using condensed tomato for the mushroom soup.  The (unintentional) change I made was not using any cheddar cheese. If you want a healthier option, definitely do not use the cheese - it's absolutely not needed!    Things I would change next time:  Mix in green beans and corn to make it a bit more filling, and I would also cook the fries a bit longer before putting them on the meat mixture (or maybe cook them separately the entire time since I won't be putting cheese on them anyway.)    All in all, this was fantastic, and I will definitely be cooking it again soon!

Delicious when using 1tsp of garlic, salt and 1/2 tsp pepper, as well as the addition of drained canned corn and green beans. I've made this twice already! Took other reviewers' advice and baked fries ahead of time.  I noticed while adding the golden mushroom and cheddar cheese soup that the combination of these 2 soups with the ground beef and pasta would be a tasty and easy alternative to Hamburger Helper.

This was so delicious! I made a few slight changes to this recipe just based on what I had on hand. Here is what I did: I browned the ground beef in the skillet, then added about a tsp of Lipton dry onion soup mix (b/c I was out of onion) and mixed that around really well. Then I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup (not golden, b/c I didn't have it) and about half a jar of Cheesy Ragu double cheddar sauce. I let that start to bubble then added a couple dashes of garlic powder. I transferred the mixture to a casserole dish and layered with frozen tator tots across the top. I put it in the oven at 450 degrees for about 20 min, adding shredded cheddar cheese to the top for the last 2 min. The tater tots were the perfect crispness and not the least bit soggy. I have had that can of cream of mushroom soup forever b/c neither I nor my husband particularly like it. I was afraid to use it for this but decided to give it a shot, and I'm very glad I did. The flavors mixed perfectly togther. We were both surprised at how yummy this easy dish was!

I was very suprised at how delicious this recipe was.  I followed the directions and used the specified ingredients and I actually found it very salty. I also added some chopped bacon with the soups because I like bacon on my cheeseburger and I chose the SUPER crispy fries and layered them with the shredded cheese so the steam could escape and they were not at all soggy, they were crisp and perfect!  I will definately make this often!  Next time I will try replacing the mushroom soup with tomato, just to have a change.

The only alteration I made was to prebake the fries as others suggested.  I thought this was awesome! My kids picked at it but they are very challenging kids in terms of being picky!

Kind of bland but easy dish.  I substituted cream of mushroom for the golden mushroom as others said (and because I didn't have golden mushroom).  Took advice of cooking fries first and they were good but the dish was missing something.  May try to make again once I figure out how to change it up.

I didn't add the cream of mushroom soup. I used only 1 pound of meat with i can of cheddar cheese soup. I did bake my fries beforehand. My ENTIRE family loved it. My husband was skeptical because really, it doesn't look all that great. But after having a helping, he asked for seconds and thirds. Most importantly, my kids loved it.

I pretty much followed the recipe.  I did only make a half batch, because it sounds like it is not good the next day.  I added fresh garlic and season salt to the beef. In addition, I cooked bell pepper and onions in the meat.  It needs something.  Just have not put my finger on it.  My father loved it.  My husband liked the meat.  I thought it was okay.  The kids picked through it.  I do believe that tater tots are the way to go.  I was not to crazy about the french fries. I might try it with tomato soup next time.  It definitely needs something to make it stay together.  Cooling it down makes the meat thicker, but the cheese and fries turned icky when they are cold.

I love this recipe!! I agree you either have to cook the fries separately or give them a jump start or it'll get all soggy. I didn't like the crm of mush soup either so I just doubled up on the cheddar cheese soup. My husband asks for this on a regular basis!

Fairly quick and easy recipe. I took a few suggestions from previous reviews and did a few of my own things and it came out wonderful.

While I doing the meat and soup mixture I threw the fries in the oven to bake them to prevent sogginess when they were added to the top of the meat mixture. I fried the meat in with a cut up pepper rather than onion, but added onion powder (someone in my household is an adament onion hater) to still have the onion taste. As someone suggested, I used tomato soup rather than the mushroom, and added an extra 1/2 can of the cheddar.
 
It's a great recipe and I will try adding sour cream and veggies next time as a variation.

This tastes wonderful.  I did change some things, First I used minsed Garlic, about a tablespoon.  I was just feeding my 2 kids and myself so I only used 1lb of ground beef.  I didnt have any cheese soup so I just added a whole can of mushroom soup and a whole bag of shredded cheddar cheese.  Put it in a pan, I first fried up the french fries until almost done, then dumped the almost done french fries on top of the meaty cheesey mess, and then baked it at 300 for 20 minutes.  It went over VERY VERY well with the kids.  I gave it 4 starts because I changed it so much.  I cant imagin how cheesey it must be with the can of cheese soup.  Thanks for the base!  Next time I will add a can of drained crushed tomatoes!

This recipe is the best. The only thing I did different was I cut up three small potatoes instead of frozen french fries. My four year old won't eat anything and she ate two helpings. Its easy and takes little time out of my day.  Thanks for sharing.

Followed this recipe, and didn't find anything tastey about it.  The only thing my kids ate, were the fries on the top that didn't touch the meat.  Will not make this again....

Delicious!!  Made a few changes to make it more of an adult casserole too. Put 1 cup shredded cheddar & 1 can rotel tomatoes in with beef and soup mixture.  Only put 1 cup shredded cheddar on top and sprinkled with homemade bacon bits.  Shoestring fries do work best.  Not the most healthy meal, but nice to indulge once in a while.  Thank You Sooo Much for recipe!!!

Loved this! Used turkey meat and turned out great. Alas, my kids are too picky, they didn't love. :( Thanks for the recipe!
Update 12/2010: This has become a staple recipe in our house...kids do love it and I often have to double. Changes - I use onion powder because kids don't like texture of onions, and I mix in combination of ketchup and mustard into meat mixture for an "authentic" cheeseburger taste, lol. Thank you!

I was excited to try this recipe, but I found it to be only mediocre...tasted like old-fashioned tater tot casserole to me. However, my husband liked it quite a bit. I will try it again someday, but I'll leave out the mushroom soup (that's probably why it tasted like plain ol' tater tot casserole to me) and add more cheese soup.

This is a great easy recipe.  Just like having a cheeseburger and fries all rolled up into a casserole.

Too greasy for us. Meat mixture is good but the cheddar on top leaves it all a greasy mass.  Maybe mix meat part with noodles?

Nobody in my family particularly liked this. Since it's not a recipe that's easy to cut in half, there was way too much food for myself & my two boys. I think Hamburger Helper would have been cheaper, easier & tastier. Sorry...

Very good and tasty too! I used tater tots instead of fries--I didn't have any at the time.
I plan to try this recipe "mexican style" using everything but the mushroom soup, adding taco seasoning, still using tater tots with seasoning on them as well. Serve with all the fixin' and maybe even cruble up some tortilla chips on top of cheddar cheese. We'll see how that works out!
Great recipe, will make again, this time with fries.

awesome recipe.  easy enough for my 11 yr old son to make.  we seasoned in layers, first the onion and garlic, then the meat, then the french fries.  It was great.  even my husband that does not eat a lot of meat enjoyed it.

This was very good!  Usually my family doesn't like casseroles, but I was looking for something different to do with ground beef and came upon this.  Based on some of the other reviews saying it was too bland, I used 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1 teaspoon garlic powder and I thought the flavor was fine (in fact, I may even decrease some of the salt next time).  I also used a monterey jack/colby blend of cheese on top.  I will definitely make this again!

This is OK. I substituted onion powder for the onions, because of my hubby. Other than that, I followed the recipe as-is. I was liberal with the spices, and also put some salt and pepper on top of the fries before baking. I added ketchup and pickle slices to the top of my serving- I don't know if I could have eaten it without those. Didn't taste exactly like a cheeseburger to me, but similar, I guess. I can see this being a good meal to make in a pinch, but probably not something I'll add to my regular recipe rotation.

here are the changes I made; use just cheddar soup, add 1/2-3/4 cup bbq sauce, pepper, onion & garlic.  I used fajita fries, and baked them seperatly while i was browning the meat, until almost crisp, them topped the hot meat/soup mixture with the fries and cheese. bake til cheese melts. everyone in my family loved this, including our pick 4 year old:) we ate this plain and with ketchup or sour cream.  quick and easy.

Excellent recipe! It is quick and tasty. I work full time and am a part time college student in the evenings with no time to cook and this was perfect. It fed my husband for three nights and he didn't get tired of it! I made it as stated except we added cheese flavored french fried onions to the top and used seasoned fries! Another Allrecipe success!

This was excellent!  My fussy husband absolutely loved this super simple and very tasty casserole.  I recommend it to anyone, although since he IS fussy, we halved it and used only Cheddar Cheese soup.  Enjoy!

We loved this recipe but i did make a few minor changes. I didn't have cheese soup so i just used mushroom soup and then added about 1 1/2 tbsp of processed cheese spread to it.  I also added lots of garlic, onion powder,oregano, salt and pepper to the meat mixture.  I also salted the fries before adding them to the top.  This is a very kid friendly recipe. Just the name alone had my daughter sold.  My husband agreed that i should make it again for those lazy dinner nights.

I did not like this recipe at all.  It had way too much hamburger and was incredibly salty.  My 2-year-old and husband took 2 bites and wouldn't eat anymore.  I threw the entire thing away.  What a waste.

Didn't have golden mushroom soup so I used cream of mushroom (low fat of course) and it turned out very well. I would like to play around with it to make it a little more spicier (seemed like it needed ketchup).

I made this one using tater tots, tomato soup, nacho cheese soup and a little Velveeta.  I did bake my tater tots first and since I baked too many, I also put them on top and then cheese on top of that. It was a hit!!!

Even with pre-baking the fries, this wound up a bit soggy. Good flavor and probably a big hit with kiddos, but avoid if you're a "texture person."

My changes... "health it up" a little... Use 93-7% beef. Make your own fries by roasting sliced red potatoes that have been lightly coated with olive oil, salt, pepper at 425F for about 30 minutes. They should be nicely browned. Don't use canned soups. Use about 1/2LB 2% Velveeta melted with 1 can Rotel tomatoes. (2% Velveeta is not health food but it's better than canned cream soups). Otherwise use recipe as directed. Yeah, I know its a little more work but the taste is greatly improved and is a considerably healthier version. Next time, I will add diced fresh jalapenos or bell pepper to meat mixture.

This was a surprisingly good recipe.  I had a few bags of seasoned fries that I baked at 425 for 30 minutes.  These were nice and crispy once finished.  I sautéed the onion with some minced garlic and a chopped jalapeño.  I added about a lb of ground turkey and a can of corn.  Once that was cooked through I mixed in a can of Amy’s vegetarian chili that I had on hand.  I followed the rest of the recipe but probably only had to cook this for about five minutes so the cheese melted and was appropriately gooey.  My family loved it!

This was a good one and it will be done again. I am reading the reviews and I am seeing that a lot of people have complained about the fries being soggy. I think I know where the issue is. The recipe says 375 degrees in the instructions, but the package of frozen fries I got said they needed to be cooked at 400 degrees. I did the full 30 at 375, then upped the temperature to 400 when I put it back in with the cheese topping for about 10 minutes. I would suggest to put it at 375 for 15 mins, then 400 for remaining 15 minutes. Leave it at 400 for the cheese, keeping it in for no more than 3 - 5 minutes. I also cranked up the taste a bit by putting some 3 peppers & onion mix into it. Came out pretty good.

My whole family loved this.  I also made some alterations  No mushrooms, used velveta instead of soup and chopped 6 pickles and added them to the burger mix.  If you like pickles I think they really made the difference from people saying this was bland

I use my Dutch Oven to make this.  Brown the meat in it, add the rest of the ingredients and put it in the oven.  Saves an extra pan to wash.

I made this for a work party and it was SO good. I baked the fries before adding them to the casserole just to add a little extra crunch.  Also, I added a lot of extra cheese only because I come from a family that LOVES dairy ( so we always add a little extra). But this was fantastic. Super easy to make and with this recipe it fed 14 people with leftovers! I had co-workers asking for the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this twice my 4 year old loves it and my husband if had the choice would eat all himself! I did make some changes based on other reviews and suggestions, such as i pre baked the french fries for about 20 minutes we like the crinkle cut i also used tomato soup . I added Lawry's Seasoned salt instead of salt for more flavor  along with the other seasonings and i mixed the soups together in the skillet i used for the meat over warm and i seasoned the soups not the meat once blended well i added the drained meat. Will continue to make this.

I didn't have the required soup, so I used tomato bisque, and some slices of American cheese. I sauteed the meat with onions, garlic,  and McCormick Steak Seasoning. I baked the fries for 20 minutes, and the family said they could use a little more time. But, I only heated it in the oven for 10 more minutes because everything was hot when added to the pan. Also added frozen corn to the hamburger mix. Family loved it! Will try it with the soups that it called for next time and see if they still like it as much.

It was ok, and the kids liked it so-so, they just wanted to eat the fries on top. If I made it again, I would mix a small amount of ketchup in with the soups. I felt it needed a bit of  zing.

We all really liked this!  I did bake the fries for about 25 minutes before I put them on the casserole.  I just like them a little more crispy.  But overall the flavors were really good and I think this would be a great  and quick meal for a working parent to make and the kids would love it. (No kids here and we loved it)

Delicious and easy! My husband asks for this on a regular basis and he is PICKY! Definitely pre bake those fries though, way better and crispier. I also add sour cream like other reviewers have mentioned. You can pretty much use any condensed soup you want and it still turns out tasty. I use cheddar and cream of chicken! Great recipe!

Everyone loved this.  The only change I made was to add a can of mushrooms & I didn't have fries on hand so I used tater tots.   Next time I may try it with bacon to make it a bacon cheeseburger & fries casserole.

The only changes I made was I added some fresh garlic and hamburger seasoning because I was afraid there wouldn't be enough flavor. My husband ate it but asked that I not make it again. Still was somewhat bland. Reminded me of hamburger helper.

I pre-cooked the fries for 10 minutes, as suggested by other reviewers, and my fries were still undercooked when it was all said and done. The instructions on the bag said to cook them at 450, so maybe I should have adjusted the temperature to higher than 375. Live and learn. Aside from that, this dish was just OK. I seasoned the meat generously, and still wasn't impressed, which surprised me because we like all of the ingredients. It sounded better than it was, I guess.

Me and my partner give this an A+. I read the reviews, one person used tomato soup instead of golden mushroom soup. Another added a green pepper, and another used hash browns instead of french fries. I used all there suggestions and doubled up on the hash browns. I also think a bag of frozen corn might be good added to the meat sauce. Going to try that next time. Thanks for the recipe and all the great ideas.

OK as is. Kind of bland. My kids 2.5 and 4.5 didn't like it. I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe suggested to get the fries to golden a bit, but they were still soggy.

Love this recipe!  I usually have all the ingredients on hand so it makes for a super easy dinner.  I have a preschooler and a baby in the house so I often brown/season the ground beef, add the soups and spread it in a casserole during nap time, then right before hubby gets home pull it out of the fridge, dump on the fries and toss it in the oven.  I normally use cream of mushroom instead of golden mushroom since that's normally what's in the pantry stocked up, personally I like the taste with the cream of mushroom.  I also do not prebake the fries.  I do find that they are a bit soggy, but we just eat it with a fork.  Usually I serve with a garden salad but I may have to try adding in some canned or frozen veggies in the future to see what happens!  One other thing I sometimes do differently though, I find that for us it makes a lot of food, which is great if we will be around for leftovers.  Also, it's kinda hard to halve the soups, so often I'll make the meat/soup mixture and freeze half of it then make it in an 8x8 pan with half the fries and cheese.  Then, in a few weeks/months when I want it again I just thaw out the mix.  Works really well and doesn't affect the taste at all!

So good and very easy! I doubled the recipe because I was cooking for 9. I used seasoned fries and cooked those in the oven for about 15 minutes before adding to recipe. May have helped the sogginess other people have experienced. Also used a can of regular cheese soup and a can of nacho cheese soup, a can of golden mushroom and a can of creamy roasted garlic mushroom and the flavor was perfect! I added mustard to mine before eating also. We will be making this often!

This recipe was GREAT! I did change a few things though. I used actual minced garlic instead of powder.  I used Rotel Tomatoes and Nacho cheese soup instead of the Cream of Mushroom soup and cheddar cheese soup.  I then cooked the fries at 425 degrees for 10 minutes before putting them on top of the meat mixture.  I added worchtirshire sauce to the meat mixture as well.  Then I topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese and cooked bacon bits!!! YUM!

i made this recipe as a vegetarian dish omitting the ground beef.  i simply mixed half a cup of sour cream, the soups, raw onions, the french fries and seasonings, and added the cheese.  i served this dish to a group of teenagers, who loved it.  so easy and cheap to make.

This was very good.  The family enjoyed this comfort food.  It was simple enough to make and quick too.  Great for winter time recipes.

Since I have celiac disease (gluten inolerant), I had to make several changes to this recipe. The condensed soups had wheat/gluten in them, so instead I used the Pacific brand of organic cream of mushroom soup (it's gluten free - they also have cream of chicken and cream of celery!). I took a que from someone else and added a dollop of sour cream with it. Because I couldn't use the cheddar cheese soup, I used a few slices of Velveeta sandwhich cheese slices. After the soup was mixed and heated through with the beef, I set the slices on top and covered with a lid until the slices melted, then stirred it all together. I topped it all off with waffle fries and stuck to the instructions, and they didn't come out soggy at all! I put A LOT of shredded cheese on top to melt. :) Finally, instead of using chopped onions I just used onion powder. Delicious!

I loved this recipe when I first saw it in a recipe magazine. I dont add onion or garlic powder and I use a whole jar of ragu double cheddar instead of cheddar soup and the original recipe(in the magazine) says to cook it for 55-60 min. you get crispier fries that way. I add the cheddar ten min. before it is done cooking. yum!

Pretty good, my fiance loved it. We added bacon to to top it off and used zestie fries that were cooked in the oven to crisp then heated the entire dish in the oven for about 15 minutes total. It has a good flavor.

Pretty darn good!  Based on some reviews I made some changes: substituted the golden mushroom soup with tomato, added some shredded cheese to the meat, and topped with tater tots that had already been cooking about 10 minutes.  I did not experience the blandness issue that some had, but I think that was due to the tomato soup, which was a stellar suggestion.  It tasted sorta like a less spicey, cheesy sloppy joe. I gave 4 stars because my daughter (5) didn't like it much.  She ate all the tots but didn't like the meat.  Husband hasn't weighed in, yet.  Also, because it's not all that convenient - next time I will make the meat stuff on the stove and the tots in the oven, and just plate them together. I'll let you know how well it reheats.

LOVED IT!!! But I did switch out the cream of mushroom for tomato soup.  I also like many others cooked my fries for 10min before putting them on the meat mixture and will probly even cook them longer next time because I like my fries crispy. It's something different and easy!  And my husband loved it... as did I.

This was a good "kid Friendly" meal. It was easy to prepare, it tasted pretty good. I do recommend adding a lot of seasoning while cooking the meat,and I also agree with pre-cooking the fries...it definitley made them crispy.

This is definetly a keeper with the following changes. Since no one else in the house will eat mushrooms I used 2 cans of cheddar as others have done.  I put lines of ketchup and mustard on top of the hamburg soup layer. Then the almost done extra crispy fries and and tore up 4 pieces of the already cooked bacon and then the cheese. 

Only things I would change next time is use 3 pds of hamburg because one can of soup is not enough but 2 cans is just too sloppy for 2 pds. And I would put the meat/soup/ketchup/mustard/ in the oven to heat well before adding the french fries and cheese. The hamburg didn't seem hot enough for us till we got it dished up and sat down to eat. 

IF you want to re-heat it next day put it in the oven covered with foil. Others have complained it got soggy re-heating it and I bet they tried to use the microwave.

Quick and Easy and kid friendly.  I did make a few changes like others have listed.  I pre-cooked tater tots.  I did not use cream of mushroom soup and used 2 cans of the cheese soup.  I used minced garlic when frying the meat and onion and added the salt & pepper then.  I only heated the casserole enough to melt the cheese (only about 1 cup) b/c everything was already hot and I had a lot of cheese in the meat mixture.  Thanks for sharing

Pretty good recipe. Very easy to make. I used frozen seasoned curly fries for the top, and only used 1lb ground beef and one can cream of chicken, and added fresh cheeses to the sauce pan before adding to the baking pan. I added cheese on the top at the end of baking as well.

Yummmm!  I have made this recipe many times.  I use a jar of 3-cheese pasta sauce instead of the canned soups.  I also season only the top of the fries with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Substituting ground turkey for 1/2 the beef makes for a lower-fat, more economical alternative that is just as tasty.

My family and I thought this was a very delicious & easy-to-make meal.  I don't feel this needs change at all.  I did bake the fries first as other reviews suggested--I also used seasoned hamburger (when I buy hamburger meat from the store I buy in bulk and divide it up and season it with Beef Burgundy seasoning and freeze).  It was sooooooooooooo good!  This was the first thing I cooked in a 9x13 dish that completely disappeared the same night!  Great recipe--thanks so much!!

I made this exactly to recipe.  The only thing anyone in my family enjoyed was eating the cheesy fries off the top.  Maybe I’m just a purest, because as far as we were all concerned,  cheeseburgers and cheesy fries would have been much better.

Oh my yummy goodness!  Fantastic recipe.  I substituted the mushroom soup for tomato soup and used Nacho Cheese soup.  Topped with shredded "taco" cheese as well.  What a keeper - when you're not counting calories, that is!  Wonderful, thanks for sharing.

Sorry but have to say we won't be making this again.  It was ok, but bland.  I topped mine with some ranch dressing, DH put on ketchup and my kids even said not to make it again.  It was edible so that's why I gave it a 3.

I was VERY disappointed in this recipe.  I usually agree with the majority but not this time.  I stayed pretty close to the recipe, the only change being to increase the seasoning.  Evenso, I found this to be a HUGE waste of, otherwise, good ingredients that should've been used elsewhere.  It was bland and an odd assortment of tastes.  No one in my family of 5 liked it.  I may actually pick the fries out tomorrow and pitch them in an attempt to use 2 pounds of ground beef in a better recipe.  YUCK!!!

I made some changes to the recipe that I saw in another review.  Switched to health choice tomato soup and cheddar cheese soup.  I also baked the fries in the oven while the meat was browning.  Everyone I've made this for absolutely LOVES it.

This is my family's new favorite!  All three of my kids loved it and so did the hubby.  We couldn't get enough.  It was fast, easy, and very filling.  The hamburger was deliciously flavored, and the fries tasted great with all the cheese.  This is a great recipe and would be easy for even a reluctant cook like myself to prepare.

Very good! I just made this for my small family, so I made half of the recipe. I used 1 lb ground beef, 1/2 large onion, lots of garlic powder, 3/4 can cheese soup and 1/2 can mushroom soup. I actually still used the 16 oz of fries and 1 cup of cheddar on top. I really liked it - thx! Oh - and I did prebake the fries while I was cooking the meat, etc.

Very yummy!!  Instead of using the onion, garlic & salt - I used a substituted with a seasoning salt instead.  Very delicious!  The family loved it, and the kids gobbled it up.  I passed the recipe onto neighbors, and their kids raved about it, too!

Not bad! I used tator tots instead of french fries and I think that really improved on it a little. Ketchup does add a little missing zing from it though.

Omitted the mushroom soup, was still delicious. I topped my portion with sour cream and also tried Salsa on a portion of it, both were delicious.Will make again, but next time I will try adding some taco seasonings to the ground beef as a change of pace. Thanks for a great simple recipe!

This dish was just okay.  I did deviate from the recipe and it was just bland.  My husband and boys put ketchup on it and were happier with that.  Not something I will make again.

Although we ate it - this was a boring dish.  My husband compared it to "Hamburger Helper...but not as exciting". I suppose it would be great for finicky kids.  I will not make this again.

This was really good...also found out you can use the Pepperjack cheese soup, or the fiesta cheese soup instead of just the plain Chedder Cheese soup if you want to add a little zip to it.  To quote my husband when i try new things and he likes them "Definitely do-able again" :o)

This was really good!  I used 1.25 pounds of ground turkey because I don't like ground beef, but the full amount of onion and soups.  I used tater tots instead of fries, didn't put cheese on top and sprinkled the salt, pepper and garlic powder on top of the tater tots instead of mixing in with the meat.  I had mine with ketchup and mustard but it was also great without, and it reheated well (I think tater tots reheat better than french fries, which just get kind of weird).  Next time I might mix in some veggies and maybe a can of mushrooms.  Oh and I used cream of mushroom soup because the store didn't have the other kind- what's the difference, anyway?  Thank you for this easy recipe, I'm sure I'll make it again.

Okay, but nothing special.  Good for once every 2 months or so.  Easy to make.  I used the extra-crispy frozen fries and they retained their crispness even after cheese was melted over them.

As has been mentioned by numerous others, this recipe is a bit bland. The next time I make it I will definitely spice it up. This may boost the rating from a 3 to a 4. Either way it is quick and easy to make and well worth the limited effort to make.

Yes, I can see how kids would like this casserole; it does taste very much like a cheeseburger, especially if served with ketchup and pickles.  However, as an adult woman, not my favorite thing to make.  I needed to use up a bag of french fries languishing in my freezer.  I don't mean to diminish it, it's not bad.  But I probably wouldn't make it again.

This turned out great! Husband & kids ate 2nd helpings! I used cream of mushroom soup instead of golden mushroom, and barely added any extra salt. Really tasty; will definitely make this again!

Very good and easy recipe.  Of course followed other advice and added more seasonings to the ground beef while browning.  Kids loved it and so did I, will make again.

My husband really liked this.  Like other reviewers, we went heavy on the seasonings and added a splash or two of worchestershire sauce.  Great with ketchup!

This was a great recipe! My whole family enjoyed it, but like others have said we added extra seasonings, and it was very flavorful. If yours comes out bland, it is because you need to go heavy on the seasonings. We gave it an A+ just for being super easy to make!

I made this the other night because it was a quick meal.  Much to my surprise my husband really liked it.  He even took the leftovers for lunch the next day.  I will diffently make this again.  I took the advice of other reviewers and add more seasonings.  I got a little carried away with the garlic powder.   I ate mine with catsup.  Tasted just like a hamburger.

This recipe sounded great, so I was very surprised to find that I didn't like it. I picked the fries from the top and just ate them.

I really enjoy this recipe. Maybe not the most elegant thing to serve but mighty tasty. You really have to be unafraid of the seasoning. I have stopped with not enough a couple of times and have learned that it really needs a good amount. Easy to make and have all the ingredients on hand!! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe because it was so easy and so tasty.  I served it at a birthday party and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I served it with ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish on top and it was delicious.  Thanks Bettina J!

This is an easy recipe to rate. It was really good and easy to make. I added some french fried onions before topping it with cheese just for a little extra kick. Really good. Make it, eat it, enjoy it.

Great comfort food!  I had my doubts, but what a fun and easy meal.  My husband (who detests casseroles) really enjoyed it too.  I had to make him stop eating this so I could get another meal out of it tonight!

This is a slight variation on a recipe given to me a few years ago so I wanted to try it.  Just like the other recipe, this one got mixed reviews.  I really like it a lot, my husband not so much.  My kids can take it or leave it but my daughter's two friends that were visiting loved it and each had a second helping.  It could be the way I am preparing it.  To cut down on the salt, I use a can of low-salt mushroom soup, which is runnier than regular condensed.  I also added only pepper, no extra salt and it tasted fine.  The casserole is slightly runnier than it should be but tastes really good.  This is a great recipe to throw together quickly so I will continue to make it.

I made this tonight for the second time and as suggested I baked the fries until they were quite crispy. This avoided the soggy fries from the first time I made this. I used the golden mushroom soup cheddar cheese soup combination and it was good but next t8me I think I’l try tomato soup cheddar cheese soup. This came together quickly and easily and was good.

This was good but needed a little something.  Not sure what....maybe a dash of hot sauce?  I will definitely make this again as it is a very kid-friendly recipe but will tweak it a little to perfect it.
