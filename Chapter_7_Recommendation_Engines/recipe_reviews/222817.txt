I love wild rice salads, and this was a very tasty one.  I left out water chestnuts (not my favorite food item), but otherwise I kept to the recipe.  I used this to extend some leftovers, and I was a happy camper!  My rice, by the way, was from Wisconsin (sorry Minnesota!), and it was a darker variety than what I'm normally used to.  I would definitely make this again!  I think apples would be good with this, too.  Thanks, Scott N!

This was a good salad. I made it exactly as written for a family gathering, and people enjoyed it.  I also doubled the recipe and took it to a church function - no leftovers!  I'm going to make it again this weekend and will use pecans.  I love the crunch that the nuts and water chestnuts add.  I also love not having to halve the grapes.  Saves time and just as easy to eat!
