I give this 4 stars with my improvements - It isn't really a Cosmo with only vodka in it. So I added in 3/4 oz of Triple Sec and a whole ounce of lime juice. Also, because it's February and all I could get were two little baby watermelons that weren't that ripe I threw in a generous pinch of Splenda. If it were Summertime and I could find some nice ripe melons I'm sure the sweetener wouldn't be necessary at all.

I had some mushy watermelon so this seemed perfect but it was extremely bitter.  This recipe could really use a sweetener.

This was just right for me.  It was sweet enough which must mean it depends on the watermelon being used.  Mine was fully ripe.  I didn't blend the melon, just drained off juice from a big bowl of watermelon cubes through a mesh strainer in a measuring cup

Refreshing, but it tasted "weak" to us. Next time we'll try a bit more lime juice or perhaps some triple sec.
