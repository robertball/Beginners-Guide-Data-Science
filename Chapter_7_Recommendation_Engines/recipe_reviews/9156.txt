Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit. It is just the right amount of rutabaga and parsnip to add flavor, but not be overpowering. Best part for me was that I could make it the night before, and 25 minutes before the meal was to be served, I pulled it out of the fridge and popped it into the oven. Will for sure make again.

This is a very good mash! I made this one winter night and my husband and I were both impressed by the balance of flavors.I didn't find the amount of peeling/prep to be alot of work like some of the reviewers said.And it was just as good warmed over the next day.I'll have to catch these root vegetables on sale and store them to make this casserole.Definetly a keeper.

This was an experiment, not just for us but also for the dinner guest we had this evening – something I would never recommend doing!  I got so lucky on this!  We didn’t just tolerate this, or even just like it.  This was a real hit – for all of us.  Fairly even amounts of the potato, rutabaga and parsnips ensured that each would contribute to create a new flavor all its own - and oh, what a wonderful flavor it was.  The “icing on the cake” was the caramelized onions on the top. What a rich and lovely finish, but you MUST let them cook slowly for a good, long time until they truly are golden brown and caramelized.  I half-heartedly made this as an alternative to mashed potatoes with our roast beef and gravy dinner tonight. While the entire dinner was perfect and delicious, this side dish single-handedly took my dinner from JUST delicious to exquisite.

Awesome! I love root veggies and this was a nice change from plain old mashed potatoes. I boiled everything in water instead of chicken broth because I'm trying to cut back on sodium. I don't think it affected the flavor much because this was so good! I made sure to carmelize the onions for a long time and tossed in the chopped garlic during the last 4 mins of cooking the onions rather than boiling the garlic with the other ingredients. I also folded the onions and garlic into the potato mixture rather than spreading them on top. I also felt like the mixture was a little dry when I mashed it in my Kitchen-aide mixer so I tossed in a little rice milk and that did the trick. Ate this with "incredibly cheesy turkey meatloaf" from this site and asparagus with lemon. Delicious!! This one will go in the recipe box for sure!

I already had a wonderful root veggie recipe that I loved and thought nothing could beat, but decided to try this one a few days ago.  Well, not only does this one take less effort but it tastes so much yummier, especially with those caramelized onions (I doubled the amount!).  Absolutely delicious and hard not to have seconds or even thirds.....

The taste of this was good, but the parsnips were still a little chewy at the end of the 30 minutes, which made it difficult to mash; I think next time I will put the parsnips in the pot as the stock is coming to the boil, so their texture will be more similar to the other root vegies.  Also, be warned that this makes a lot more than 9 servings, so you will have plenty to go with the leftover turkey!

Often times I will add either a rutabaga or turnip to my mashed potatoes to give it a deep rich flavor.  I liked everything about this recipe except the parsnips.  I've discovered that I don't care for parsnips. They gave off a distinct pungent flavor that was easily detectable.  Even my husband didn't care for them.  If I were to make this again, I would probably add one small parsnip as a slight enhancement to the flavor, but I think the dish would be just fine without them.

Great Recipe - I made it for Thanksgiving.  I do have to say that my family commented that they preferred plain ol mashed potatoes for the Holidays though.  This recipe was not really a hit with my kids but the adults liked it.

This recipe was wonderful. I served it with steak (so midwestern). I reduced the amount of butter. I also guessed as to the weights of the vegetables and used equal parts parsnip, potato, and rutabaga. My whole family (6 audults) thought it was a shame there was not more of it.

This recipe inspired me.  I didn't have rutabaga.  I used turnips.  It was so good!  I ended up calling it "mish mash" when I was asked what it was...

So good! I'm not familiar with these veggies, but I diced them, nice and small, and they were very well done. Instead of draining the broth, I reserved a little and added it to the veggies - no butter required. I used yukon gold potatoes, with the skins still on, and I loved the texture with the other lumpy veggies - they weren't hard, but very smooth, like a chunky applesauce, not smooth like mashed potatoes. The carmelized onions are an absolute must! Although the directions seem a little off - maybe cook on med-high until transparent, not brown. My kids had 3rds!

Halved the recipe and omitted the parsnip. You could easily just make this on the stove-top and mix in the caramelized onions. I would add a little milk and butter next time. The rutabaga adds a nice change of flavour to this mashed potato-style dish.

Delicious!  A warm, wintery treat of a side dish.  I made it before my husband put a roast in the oven so he was able to pop it in for half an hour at 325 which was the roast's temperature, then he upped it to 375 for 15 minutes while the roast rested.  This makes this a flexible side dish to go along with various meats.  Excellent!

I did end up with two 13x9 pans' worth, though, so next time I'll halve it, although it's hard to find rutabagas under 2 lbs.

I liked this because it had a different flavor than plain mashed potatoes (which I think are boring), but the rest of the family did not like this!  There is a huge pan of it left for me to eat on my own!

This was soooo good! Everyone from the 2 year old to Grandpa loved it.  I had planned to cook potatoes, rutabagas and parsnips as side dishes with a roast beef & yorkshire pudding. This is a great dish to combine them in, likely took less time than cooking all 3 and less pots & pans. Will definetly be making this again!

This was so good I had to force myself to stop eating it. I used veg broth and a mix of coconut oil and olive oil, and I boiled the veggies for 35-40 min. Instead of boiling the garlic, I minced half the amount and added it to the mash. The rutabaga and parsnip added a distinctive, slightly sweet flavor, and the caramelized onions absolutely made this dish--next time, I'll double the amount.

This was part of my Thanksgiving meal and was great - I think I overdid it on the parsnips but that was my fault!!  Add extra carmelized onions for a special treat!

I would proudly serve this at Thanksgiving! Rutabagas are nearly forgotten, it seems. I don't think about them often, even though I like them.  The store had no parsnips, so I omitted them, but the seasonings were so perfect, I was able to lower the salt for my husband's diet without sacrificing flavor. I cooked the onions in avocado oil instead of butter. I will cook this often with my family's blessings! Thank you for a great dish!

My husband made this for us and it turned out pretty good.  We didn't have a rutabaga so we just left that out.  He served it with baked chicken breast and it was a great alternative to plain mashed potatoes.

I tried this recipe last Thanksgiving and I liked it a lot.
I made it today ( I should have boiled them more because some of the pieces of the rutabaga were still hard) but is was good anyway.
I used a light butter.Still the flavor was the same at the first one.

I love this dish, although I did not have any parsnips on hand. I added a little bit of extra rutabaga, which is now one of my favorite veggies.

The rutabaga didn't cook up quite as soft as the other veggies. It still blended up fine, but gave off a slightly lumpy texture as a result. A delicious way to work these healthy root veggies into your diet.

This is one of my favorite vegetable dishes. It's absolutely delicious. I often make this with only rutabaga or turnip, instead of the combination.

Wonderful! My son hates swede and parsnips but absolutely loved this. I think the onoin topping makes it! It also reheats very well. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this for years exactly how it's written or modified based on how much of each veg I have. I always  get compliments and requests for the recipe.                             For vegans, you can easily substitute coconut oil and vegetable broth for the butter and chicken broth.

I loved this.  I never used rutabagas and parsnips before in fact I didn't even know what it looked like until i googled a picture in the store. But that won't be my last.  I followed the directions exactly and I thought it was such a lovely mix of veggies and mashed potatoes.  HIGHLY recommend this as a side.

This recipe is a winner!  Great when you want to serve something a little fancier than plain mashed potatoes.  I can't wait to make this for my boyfriend!

Excellent! Made it exactly as stated. Only change I would make is not to cook the onions too brown as they will burn when baking. Leave them a bit pale and they will brown up in the oven. I might make this as a side dish for Thanksgiving this year.

I've made this recipe for Thanksgiving the past two years and plan to make it again this year. I keep coming back here to find it each year. It's delicious.

It came out a little wet. I would reduce the liquid.

Loved this recipe but did make the following changes:  halved the recipe, mixed stock with water (1 part stock, 3 parts water), used 1/4 tsp. minced garlic (didn't have any cloves ), used bay leaf and thyme, mashed with butter and a dollar of sour cream.  I didn't have enough onions do I just topped the mixture with grated cheese.  Excellent but next time I will make the recipe with the onions.  My husband loved it.

I made this to a T. We thought it was bland , so we added sour cream and cheddar cheese over it on our plates. We thought the small amount of sour cream really helped the flavor.  Will not make again as family just thought it was so so, and it was a lot of work for something just ok.

It was an OK recipe.  If I were to make it again, I would recommend  yukon gold versus russets.  However, given the choice, would go with regular mashed potatoes.  Not a hit with the family.

Good.  A little too garlicy, but it was good.  I think some sauteed mushrooms would be awesome in this!
