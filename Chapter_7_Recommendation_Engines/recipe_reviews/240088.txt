I used bisquick instead of flour.  I liked the texture better, not so dense.  Also, I added Cajun seasoning while browning the meat to give it some flavor.  I also mixed the meat into the bisquick batter.  I personally didn't like the texture of the breading until I mixed the meat into it instead of layering it.  After my changes, I like this recipe a lot and it's one of my husband's favorites that I make!

I liked the idea of this one - but did not like the dough. Also there is no seasoning for the meat mixture written into the recipe. I added a sprinkle of taco seasoning to my meat / onion mixture. The flavor was good and if the dough hadn't been so dense / chewy we all would have really liked this one.

Hi everyone! I wasn't very pleased with this one. Had to cook an extra 20 minutes just to get the dough right. I noticed there wasn't an ingredient that gave much flavor so to add flavor I added ketchup to the top. Most likely will not make again.

I didn't really like this. Neither did my family. The dough was dry and just too much. It took away from the rest of the ingredients.

I should have read reviews before making it. Dough was not cooked. I should have baked dough before putting topping.

I used 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound chorizo. I hoped it would add to the flavor instead of seasoning the meat as other reviewers had done. It still was bland. I used Bisquick instead of the self rising flour and mixed the meat mixture into it with half the cheese. The texture was soft and light. I used the other half of cheese on top. Besides the lack of flavor it was good. I would use taco seasoning in the meat and reduce the flour mixture by half for next time.
