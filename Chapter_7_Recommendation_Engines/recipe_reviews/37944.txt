I can't believe there is someone else in this world who loves sweetbread!!! 
We make ours the exact way. except i dont know how u can compare them to chicken hearts, yuk! we make them at the same time we make pheasant. we make the pheasant the same way. its nice to eat a few pheasant then a few sweetbread. sweetbread is a very soft texture with a sweet taste. mmm mmmm!! i strongly suggest people try them. but make sure your butcher gets the right muscle cause i've had butchers think they know what it is but don't. please people dont be afraid to try it, u wont be disapointed. (takes more than 1 cup of oil, enough to deep-fat fry.)

I always wanted to try sweetbreads, and always wondered what they were.  I found some in my local grocery store for the first time and bought a package--very inexpensive!  I used this recipe, and wow...quite delicious.  Very mild and sweet flavor.

Love sweetbreads....very mild white meat...Actually folks closer to "it tastes like chicken"  but better.  I like to press mine after enitial parboiling to firm up.....1-2 mins.  them press between pie plates ( cover with wrap please.  and then just very lightly dust with flour and quick pan fry in butter.    Don't muck around with it.  just butter salt and pepper.  

Oh and do NOT overcook!!!!!  most of the time mine just hit the pan with butter and then some salt and pepper.

I've been a sweetbread lover all of my life.  I prefer mine with a bit more batter because it holds the juices of the meat in better so they don't get dry.  I season mine with salt & pepper before battering to bring out the flavor of the meat better.  Roll in flour, dip in milk (or buttermilk for a thicker batter), then again in flour.  I like to fry mine in a deep fryer for more even cooking.  The secret with any frying is to make sure that your grease is hot enough to start frying immediately upon placing the item to be cooked in it so that you don't wind up with soggy, greasy food.  Again....I LOVE sweetbreads!!  One of my comfort foods!

I've never tried them this way, but it was good! I usually grill like so:  First, bring them to a boil in a pot of water, turn down to a simmer and let cook for about 45 minutes on low.  Take them out, cool, and slice into 1/2 inch slices.  Heat a BBQ grill to high heat, place slices on the grill, and cook as you baste with BBQ sauce.  We like them when they get crispy and a bit burnt, and then wrap them in tortillas w/more BBQ sauce. YUM! :o)

This is how my mother has always made Sweetbreads, though usually in larger pieces.  Absolutely wonderful.  I so wish it were easier to find sweetbreads so I could make them.  I would have them regularly if I could actually find them.

My Dad and I were the only ones in our family that would eat these. He would fry them up then we would pick one up with our fingers and dip in ketchup. They are very hard to find these days.

Look at all that sizzling yummy goodness.  I've eaten sweetbreads all my life. I use basically the same recipe.  White pepper, season salt, and garlic. I place spices and flour directly into a gallon ziplock baggie put the cleaned sweetbreads and shake um up good.(make sure its zipped up good) Less mess that way.

I fried it in Olive oil with seasoning salt, pepper, garlic and soy sauce. A lot of the pieces though seemed a bit chewy. I guess that's natural.. I don't know.

I usually always make these grilled I marinate them in Italian dressing and Goya seasoning overnight. But tonight we made it home so late From a road trip,didn't feel like grilling. Frying is quicker, I just felt they were too salty. I won't add Goya next time I try. But overall a very good substitute for grilling!

I grew up with the unspoken law of eat what is on your plate. Which didn't work in the case of sweet breads cuz I loved them pan fried like this recipe but my mother made a white gravy very similar to what is served with chicken fried steak. So I probably had a little of everyones share. Just recently I have found the mother load of a constant supply at a local meat market and the price per pound is less than a large cup of coffee at the local pit stop. I am in heaven
