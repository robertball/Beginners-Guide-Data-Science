I loved this! I used canned pineapple tidbits, so I couldn't actually grill my pineapple, and I didn't grill my jalapeno pepper either, but it was still absolutely delicious! We will definitely be making this one again, and next time hopefully we will have fresh, grilled pineapple and jalapeno, but even if you don't, the combination is AMAZING! My kids loved it too and there are no left overs.

So yummy!  I thought I would have leftovers, but we all just couldn't get enough of it.  My kids were fighting over the last piece.  And honestly, if my kids were fighting over it, you know it was good.

my husband and I really liked this. The sweet taste of the pineapple was perfect to counterbalance the heat of the peppers. I will be making this again.

Oh my goodness. This dish was delish.  We had to pan fry them but it was still wonderful. Sweet, spicy, bold flavors!! We are adding this to our permanent list of monthly meals!!! Thank you :) Ohh and for the salsa I added some fresh peppers only because there was a similar recipe at a pampered chef party and it was yummy.  I even added some to my salad.

This was absolutely fabulous. I was so tired of cooking pork the same old way, and this recipe became one of my family's new faves. The salsa was a bit spicy for my taste, so I just added some juice from the pineapples and a bit more lime juice. I also had to use jalapeno's from a jar, but it still turned out really good. Someone should suggest a few sides that would blend good.  I made chicken rice and I don't think it matched very well.  Overall, excellent recipe, thanks a bunch!
