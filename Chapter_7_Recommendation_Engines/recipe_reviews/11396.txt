Yum!  Chewy and chocolatey and oatey (yes that's a word ;-p ) and good.  They are quite sweet, so you might want to cut back on sugar; I didn't personally.  This makes a fair bit but 5 dozen is for very small cookies.  Easy as can be and great-tasting too!  (Something you see in "bakeries".)

No kitchen is complete with out this recipe.  The ingredients are common, save maybe the cocoa powder, and fixing them couldn't be easier.  Maybe too hot for little helpers, they are very portion controllable if spread in a thin layer on wax paper and cut into the "correct" sizes.  A very pleasant treat that saves well.  Assuming you have any left over to save.

I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.  These cookies never solidified, even when I put them in the refrigerator.  The taste was delicious but the consistency was very poor.  I'm disappointed.

I've loved these cookies since I was little...this recipe is great!  I made it using the microwave and they turned out really well.  I think that I might cut the sugar a little bit...otherwise, perfect!

a little more milk with great results.

This easy, often requested recipe is always a crowd pleaser.  It has been around for years. Followed recipe exactly with the exception of adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I made in an 8" x 8" glass dish lined with foil.  When cool I just lifted out and cut into bars.

This recipe sounds almost exactly like Mama's No Bakes that I always make.  They're SO easy and delicious!  It's extremely hard to keep everybody's hands (including mine!) off the cookies while they are cooling! Mmm

Great tasting  cookie and i like how quick it is to make.  My kids wouldn't go near them though; said they looked like cow pucks. They don't know what they're talking about.  Next time i will add whole salted or unsalted peanuts to the cookie. Yum xxx Crunch xxx

This is a really easy cookie to make, and tasty too - 
but a little on the sweet side.  I might cut the sugar a little bit next time.

I have made this for years and this is the same recipe my Grandma used and passed to me. My grandchildren ask for it every time they come visit.

My sister always gets me to make these for her. Easy, sweet and good! We call them "oaty squares". :0)
