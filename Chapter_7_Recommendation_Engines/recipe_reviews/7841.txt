This is the best homemade frosting I have had for sometime! It tastes even better on a homemade cake. It is really glossy and easy to spread and has a very good taste. I frost my cake with this while the frosting is slightly warm. Definitly a keeper!

This was pretty good.  I used cocoa powder instead of Baker's chocolate.  It thickened up almost instantly after it began to boil.  I actually forgot to add the butter and vanilla at the end, and it still tasted good.  I should have waited until it cool to spread it, though, because while it was warm it was too runny.

This recipe was great, I will keep this one as my favorite.   It is not too sweet, spreads nice and looks great.   It's the perfect choice if you don't want a real sweet icing.   thumbs up!!!!

OMG, this frosting is incredible. I used it with the "Welfare Cake" and it's just amazing. The only reason I gave it fours stars instead of five is because it took about an hour to finally thicken (maybe I had the heat on too low???).

If it takes long for it to thicken increase heat to medium, it thickens immediately after it starts boiling. I added the vanilla and butter from the beginning (misread the directions), and it still turned out delicious. It really has the consistency of a pudding, so you could use it for filling a cake too, not only for icing. Unlike other commenters, my husband found this to be a bit on the sweet side, so I would adjust sugar to your liking. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not a big fan of traditional frosting unlike the rest of my family. I'm always trying to find a happy medium. This was great!! Such a nice texture and smooth, rich flavor. I will make again and again. Thank you.

Wonderful, this really has the consistency of pudding. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and added less sugar. I didn't have any problems with the thickening, but I used medium heat instead of low because it was taking forever to boil. If you do that just make sure you stir constantly so it doesn't burn. Also... this would make excellent vegan pudding for anyone interested :)

This frosting was great. Took a while to thicken up and the bakers chocolate looked quite funny during the cooking process but it all came together in the end. I will be using recipe for many many cakes in my future. Also I used Orange extract instead of vanilla (I had run out), and the citrus flavor really added to the chocolate flavor.

This recipe is awesome!  I was lookin for something that wasn't too sweet & found it!  I switched out the unsweetened chocolate for white chocolate & it was excellent! I too found it took forever to thicken - not sure why.

I used this to frost Brookes bombshell brownies from this site. I looked Amazing but I wasn't to fond of the taste. I thought it was super sweet and not to chocolatey, I may try this recipe again...but with some adjustments to the sugar and cocoa.

This tasted okay, but it was a little sweet for me (I know that is easy to adjust).

The flavor was good for me, but not chocolatey enough for my hubby.  I also had some weird lumps in my finished product, which I'm sure was the cornstarch.  Next time I might try mixing the cornstarch with the water really well, and then adding the remaining ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe, it was just about perfect for me!

Great frosting, but use boiling water and add to dry ingredients to speed up the cooking/thickening process

Loved this recipe, it was so simple!!  I used brown sugar and butterscotch chipits(had no white sugar or chocolate) The color was golden and it wasn't too sweet at all, just nice!!  I love recipes from scratch and plan on using this over and over!

This was awesome! I made it exactly as is, although next time I will decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup as it was a little too sweet for me. I could have eaten the entire bowl with a spoon. I used it to frost an angel food cake and it was the perfect consistency to drip down the sides. I also added some fresh raspberries and it was a total winner.

This recipe saved my life!  I had prepared a Boston Cream Pie thinking I had the ingredients to make a proper ganache.  I didn't have bakers' chocolate either but did have cocoa powder.  Though skeptical, I was extremely pleased to find this recipe and very pleased with the result.  It was my turn to bring dessert to the bridge group and everyone complimented my Boston Cream Pie.

Oh my! This was awesome! I never have the ingredients for "regular" frosting on hand, so I was looking for a recipe that used the ingredients I had on hand. And I had "almost" all the ingredients for this except the unsweetened chocolate. I used a 1.4 oz. Aldi's brand dark chocolate bar for this and it worked out great! I made the black magic cake from this site, which uses coffee, so instead of the water called for in the frosting, I used coffee and...WOW! It really brought out the chocolate flavor! I made the cake in a bundt pan, and the frosting drizzled over the sides beautifully! It does make a lot of frosting for a bundt cake, but that wasn't a problem! I filled the middle up with frosting, and the little extra "pudding" you got with a slice was a great treat with the cake! Will definitely make this again as frosting...and as a quick pudding! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Excellent consistency with this recipe.  I did modify by using icing sugar instead of white sugar.  Nice creamy texture.  This can easily be changed to a vanilla frosting. I used milk instead of water and omit the cocoa powder or chocolate. As a further inspiration I needed to use up leftover eggnog so used that as my liquid and added a shot of rum and a dash of nutmeg.  A great way to top off my eggnog spice cake. Merry Christmas!

This was a really good change from typical buttercream. It was very runny to work with but thickened after a few minutes on the cupcakes. Great recipe!!!

Didn't change anything, but forgot to add the butter and it was still delicious,. Will be making this again. Made it for the Chocolate Zucchini III cake and was perfect for it. Thank you.
