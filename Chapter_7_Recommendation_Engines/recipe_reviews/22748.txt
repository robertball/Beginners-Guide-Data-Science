Easy and delicious sauce.  I used tomato sauce instead of vegetable juice (that's all I had), replaced the wine with 1/2 cup apple jucie, and I only used about 2 tbs. oil total.  Will definitely make again.

i'm a student and this was pretty much my first proper attempt at cooking... very easy, straightforward, and satisfying. extremely satisfying, actually.. i'm in one of those post-eating good food phases right now, where you feel dazed and like you're on a high :) thank you for this one.
i did alter it a little.. used about 2 teaspoons of cajun instead of crushed pepper, because i wanted more zing and thats all i had, and used about 3/4ths of a can of ready tomato juice because i had no idea how many ounces it was and gambled. i didn't have white wine on me, so i used red wine instead.. also not sure if i cooked it long enough, because the sauce was still a bit oily.. i did take the other reviewers tip and use feta cheese. that was perfection. want to try the original recipe next time, but i love what i had, and so did my housemates.
i avoid salt completely, but sprinkled this generously with whole peppercorns and ground blackpepper. the peppercorns really work with the olives in this one, at times.
my first meal, and it was a success even with the mistakes and changes i made. :)

Oh my goodness!  This is the best pasta sauce I have ever had!!  It tastes like something I'd get from a fancy Italian restaurant!!  I just worked with what I had on hand..I only had two small peppers from my garden and a couple cans of diced tomatoes in my pantry...so I just diced up the peppers and olives to make them go farther and pureed the diced tomatoes.  These are the only two things that I did different and it turned out excellent!!  Oh yah...I also added about a 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese to make it a little thicker...Awesome stuff!!  Its definitely worth repeating!!

Awesome! Made the following modifications:  Added chicken for protein and used only one green and one red bell pepper.  The bonus was that I used Trader Joe's mixed olive bruschetta and only 6 oz. of it rather than the 8 oz. that the recipe called for if you had used regular olives.  Also used tomato sauce instead and seemed to work out fine.  The boyfriend loved it and asked me to make it again :-}

This was surprisingly good. I had a hinkling to have spaghetti and meatballs when I got home but while I was knuckle deep in ground beef I realized that I might not have sauce. I found this recipe and beefed it up a bit. (literally) I added black olives, green olives, canned mushrooms, drained canned tomatoes, lots of herbs and garlic.

I only used 1 T. oil for this recipe, but did the rest as written.  This recipe is delicious!  Fabulous.  We used the sauce over ravioli, but could use it on many things, even baked chicken.  Will definitely use it many times, and tell friends.  Question:  why so much oil?  NOT necessary and not good for you.  I cooked the sauce down in a wide saucepan and it is NOT runny at all.

What a change from the regular old red sauce!  It is very mediterranean, and would be great with some feta crumbled on top.  Very nice.

I altered the recipe somewhat but it was fantastic!  I didn't have olives and I added about 1/2 cup of onions.  I used 1 1/2 red peppers and a dash of tabasco sauce and 2 Tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese.  I also only had 24 oz of vegetable juice.  My husband loved this!  I will make again.

this is an excellent recipe.  although, i thought it was a bit too runny so i added 1 6oz can of tomato paste right after i added the tomato/vegetable juice.  maybe even add just half a cup of wine instead of a full cup.. it was very prominent in my mixture.

a word to the wise, also.  if you get large green bell peppers, 2 or 3 are PLENTY.  i cut up way too many.  just a warning.

all in all..  excellent.  thanks for posting this.  i will enjoy it weekly.  :)

My husband and I didn't like the red pepper in the sauce, just too spicy for us.  I did add feta cheese.  It took longer to cook down than I expected.  Without the red pepper I'd give it 4 stars, but not so sure about my husband....

To start I heated 8 ounces of Italian Olive Salad instead of the olive oil/olives and cooked the garlic and peppers in that.  I substituted apple juice for the wine, added a small tin of tomato paste, plus I used 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of the crushed red pepper and finally I topped it with feta cheese.  Very flavorful and it possessed a nice zing.

Fantastic recipe! We doubled the amount of garlic and added some onion in with it. Then doubled, maybe even tripled all the spices. We also used yellow and red bell peppers with the green.

My husband really liked it, so I am rating for him. For me, the olive flavor is a bit too strong, and it just wasn't to my liking.
