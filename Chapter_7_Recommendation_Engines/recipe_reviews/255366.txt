I am the submitter of this recipe and I noticed that Allrecipes states that this recipe makes four servings. When I was making and testing this recipe I always made small quantities. I think that this recipe is only for 1 to 2 people since it does make a very small batch.

I realized after I started making this recipe, I was out of milk. I used strawberry yogurt instead of milk. It was a great substitute! Chocolate chip cookie dough with a hint of strawberry! The recipe is a good recipe for a snack, it ended up a bit thinner than I like, I added more flour and it was better. If I had refrigerated the cookie dough for a while it probably would have thickened up similar to most cookie doughs... But being realistic, it's cookie dough made to eat, there is no way I can sit patiently for an hour knowing I could be eating it! To help cut down on the grittiness of the sugar, try not mixing the flour in until everything else has been mixed together.

I changed it up a little bit by adding chopped mixed nuts instead of pecans.

This tasted okay. My 5 year old really liked it. My teenager and I both thought it was too sugary. I would cut back on brown sugar, but otherwise it has a nice flavor.

Fun to make with the kids...especially since they enjoy licking the beater over eating cookies!  Delicious!

It was pretty good, but I had to add more milk.  It also needs the chocolate and nut to avoid being too plain.

My daughter wanted to make a batch of cookie dough to eat and this was a perfect solution; not only does it taste great but the amount was just right.  The brown sugar is still a little gritty right out of the bowl but the next day it was a perfect consistency.  My recommendation is to let the dough sit for a few hours- if you can wait that long!

Using a mixer made a big mess so I used a spoon and mixed by hand. It makes a very small amount -- maybe 1/4 the size of a traditional cookie dough recipe. It's the perfect size for a couple of people.  It was easy and tasty. It's sweet so I used the 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips and that was perfect. Thank you!

It turned out great and was simple to make. I made with my daughters since they wanted to just eat some cookie dough!
