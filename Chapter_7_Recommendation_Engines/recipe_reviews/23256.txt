The punch tasted great!  It was a little more brown then black though.  To make it more fun I added ice cubes with gummy worms froze in the middle.  The cubes were a little easier than doing the hand and easier to transport to school or parties.

I added vodka to this for my "adult" party and I had to keep re-filling it!!  Also, add different food coloring to the gloves to make it even spookier!  We used extra blue, red, and green.  Then we hung the gloves in our freezer with clothes pins so it froze the whole hand.

This tastes like carbonated Kool Aid, and I've never known a kid who didn't like both. I made it for our playgroup halloween party and it was a big hit. The dark punch with a hand floating in it was a great effect (I made four  hands and ended up using two). I also bought gummy worms and put one at the bottom of each cup. The kids loved it! I'll use this again next year.

Forget the kids...this was a big hit at my office party!  Really need to get the ingredients very cold, though, or the fingers melt off the hand too quickly (you end up with just a chunk of ice instead of a spooky hand). Overall, great recipe, and so simple!

Instead of using water for the hand, make either red or green based Kool Aid and fill the glove.  This way your hand is spooky colored rather than clear.

Kids and adults both love this punch! Not only is it extremely quick and easy to make,it is one of the best-tasting punches I've ever had...I would makes this for any occassion,not only Halloween! I made a red("bloody")frozen hand by adding red food color to the water before freezing. Very effective and fun! I'll be making this again for Halloween dinner this year!! Thanks!

We LOVED this punch.  I put dry ice in the big bowl below the punch bowl, and I also put dry ice into the punch bowl itself.  It had fog coming out all over the place.  I also put gummy worms in the ice cubes which the children loved.

Highly recommend this awesome recipe!

Also for a nice effect, make an ice face instead of a hand.  Just get a plain masquerade mask at any craft store (ex. Hobby Lobby) and place tape over the eyes on the outside.  Fill that with water and chill it to make a face out of the ice.  It will appear as a ghost face or even the face of Snow White's Mirror Mirror on the wall.

I made this called it black lagoon punch, for my halloween party...and it was a hit and easy!  I also put the frozen hand in, very easy.  And served it in my scary punch bowl.  :)  I liked this because it's not a super sickly sweet punch!  Try it!

I loved this! I tried this at my last Halloween party. Everyone loved it. I added a mixture of food dyes though, because it did come out more brown than black... Another twist: why be limited to just grape and orange? I also tried this using a variety of dark colored kool-aids. Yummy! For the adults: a little splash of vanilla vodka makes this one a killer!

Cool punch and tasty too..I made for a kids halloween party and they loved it..and even more they loved the floating hands.  Beware when removing the glove from the ice..the fingers break-off easily so either cut off the glove with with a razor blade or remove very very slowly!  I had two hands minus the middle fingers!

This is totally for kids and reminded me of drinking Smarties.  I ended up using Canada Dry ginger ale - I think using a more tart ginger ale will tone down all the sweet.  I decided to be stupid and put gummie creatures in ice cubes.  #1 - the gummies float to the bottom of the cube tray; #2 - you can't see the gummy creatures anyway; #3 - the gummies just end up at the bottom of the punch bowl or cup.  I wasted time and gummies.  Don't do it this way.  Overall a decent kids punch.  VERY easy to whip up.

Simple. Easy. Gross-looking. Perfect for Halloween! I followed the recipe exactly and used a novelty hand mold sold in the stores to make the ice hand. Try putting a drop of red, green, or blue food coloring into the mold to give it an even more grotesque feature. I used red, and it looked like the hand had veins that were breaking/bleeding out. Lots of great comments from guests!

This was fun and festive. Everyone loved it. I added vodka to it, because it was an adult party. I also added a little green food coloring to the water in the glove, to make a green hand.

This punch is great for Halloween parties! I doubled the recipe but only used 3 cups sugar. I also used about 3 liters ginger ale. And since this was Halloween, I placed gummy worms inside latex gloves (inside the fingers whole and a bunch in the palm) and froze Hawaiian Punch around the worms. It came out looking like red, wormy hands. It looked very cool when the hand were melting!

I've found a great way to keep it cold, therefore keeping the hand(s) from melting so fast.  First off, I made this for my son's 4th grade class of 36 students today so I tripled the recipe (thus having 9 quarts of Kool-Aid).  There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so I put the Kool-Aid mixture into two,cleaned gallon milk containers.  This was made the day before, so I kept the containers in the fridge.  That left 1 quart left over, which I put in a ziplock and froze overnight.  The ginger ale was kept in the fridge in their unopened containers.  The next day, I took it all to school and combined everything in the classroom into one of those  big, plastic tubs (like the kind you bob for apples in).  The quart of punch that was frozen helped keep it all cool, without diluting the flavor.  Due to my punch being cold and refreshing, my "hands" did not melt until much later.  The kids were afraid to try it at first until their teacher tried it (loved it!) and described it as a "melted otter pop."  Only one child disliked it after that.

I made this punch for my adult Halloween party, and it got rave reviews for the flavor!  The color was not as desirable as I would have liked, however.  Even with an extra pouch of grape mix, the hue was a chalky brownish-gray.  Once everyone got over their misgivings over the color, though, the punch was a big hit.  Put this in a plastic cauldron set into a larger bowl that contains dry ice for a spooky effect!

Pretty good for a simple, cheap beverage! Adding ginger ale to koolaid is a good idea, I will probably try adding it to different flavors from now on. Thanks!

This punch was such a hit at a Halloween party we attended, I doubled it of course, and made ice cubes out of both orange and grape Kool-Aid, and put a gummy worm in the center of each cube before freezing, then just put a couple ice cubes in everyone's cup before adding the punch. What a treat, even the adults loved it!

I made this for a Halloween function.  Everyone drank it up and went back for me, but I personally disliked the taste and only had a little bit.  I guess grape orange just doesn't do it for me!  I won't make this again simply because I didn't care for it.  The color was pretty good and fitting for a Halloween party, although it wasn't pitch black, it was a funky dark brown color!  I agree that it would be best served in a dark punch bowl or at least one that's not see-through.

I served this punch for Halloween and it was a hit.  I used less sugar in the punch but added sugar to the water in the gloves.  So when the hands melted the punch maintained it's sweetness and was not over the punch.  The hands gave it the spooky look.  It was a fun punch.

Punch was great tasting with the orange & grape Kool-aid.  Skipped the ginger-ale because the kids liked the kool-aid mixture with only orange & grape.  The color was awesome!  Black as any drink can get that I would consume.  Really it looked great!  Dry ice is a must to create that look.  Only problem I had was the frozen hand.  I froze 3 gloves (non-latex) filled with wild cherry kool-aid and all three of them had the fingers broken off while I was rinsing them to "slide" out and they just looked disformed.  I had to call them hearts (which did work).  I am not blaming the chef here I only want to say that you better buy a good set of gloves to make the hands.  I used the crappy flimsy dollar pack.  A better more durable latex-free glove will do the trick.  I will do this again next year.  Thanks for the idea.

This was a hit at our Halloween Office Party. It was a little too sweet for me so I mixed it with tea and it was yummy. Served it with skull and cross bones ice cubes and some plain cubes with gummy worms inside them. Will make this again next year.

I slightly massacred this punch. Part of the massacre was intentional and part wasn't.  I mistakenly bought Sprite instead of gingerale, and that was the unintentional mistake.  The next thing I did to massacre this punch was to add passionfruit rum, and Chambord Liqueur.  My guests really enjoyed this massacred punch.  I took some lime sherbet and floated it into the punch and also took a sterile, non-latex glove and filled it w/ sprite and then some grenadine and froze it.  It was awesome!

This was so fun and tasted great. Grossed out my 7 year old who I thought would love it but he didn't. I made a jello solution of 2cups boiling water with a small box of red jello. It froze nicely and it looked like molting skin as it melted.

Simple, yummy, and the ice hand was a huge hit.  I made several and had them floating all around the big punch bowl.  Since it was a grown up party, I added vodka. Everyone loved it!

This punch was easy to make and very creepy. After reading the reviews, I found an opaque bowl to put it in so it would look pretty dark. And I only added half the sugar called for, and it was plenty sweet. The frozen hand looked really cool especially because I put red food coloring in when I froze it. I chilled the punch first and the hand lasted for about an hour before the fingers melted off. Not too many people drank the punch, but those that did said it was pretty good. Even though I had alot left over, it was worth doing because it looked cool.

Kids loved it for Halloween!  Served with "spooky" ice balls w/gummy worms frozen inside.  Agree w/previous reviewer that has more impact if served in punchbowl that is NOT clear. The punch has more of a purplish color to it than a true black.  Already on my list for next Halloween celebration.

This was the best! I had a Halloween party for 10 year old boys and they kept coming back to this punch saying how much they liked it. I think they liked it more than some of the sweet treats. Also, I would recommend putting this in a dark bowl because I had mine in a clear punch bowl and it looked more like a dark brown and not black tinted punch. We had only 5 boys, but the punch was gone in a matter of hours.

Brilliant idea for a Halloween party. I have made this two years now and both times, it turned out a murky orange color. The first year, I added black dye to it. This year, I just added a bit more blue to darken the brown. 

It is REALLY sweet though. I cut the sugar in half and it was still plenty sweet. I also did a frozen skull and the dry ice and it turned out so perfect. The kids LOVED it and ask for it every year.

this punch was perfect! i added just a touch less sugar. but even with full sugar it wouldnt have been over sweet like most punches tend to be. I just suggest that it will not serve 32. we had 15 people and it was gone in 1/2 hour. thanks for sharing. I like the clear ghostly hand. but be careful. i didnt really pay attention to how the fingers were when i put in in the frezer and when we put it in the bowl. the index and ring finger broke off so it looked like we had a ghost hand giving us the bird!

The taste was fine, I had a bottle of Malibu rum out for those that wanted to add it to the punch for a little more kick.  I have to say, it was better with the rum.  Mine however was not black, the closest it got was a kind of reddish brown.

I did make the ice hand to go in it, which looked fantastic while it lasted.  Unfortunately it only took about 5 minutes for the fingers to fall off it.  So if you're going to put the ice hand in, make sure you do that just before serving, and perhaps having the punch already chilled would to slow down the melting process.

This was great stuff. My son liked it the most, but the rest of the family was sort of too busy to try it. From the people that did, they said it was good. Instead of all water for the "3qts cold water" I used 1qt peach flavored water for more fizz. Turned out great! Makes a lot!

What a fun and tasty Halloween recipe! We just made a batch with a frozen hand, and decided that we will make it for our Halloween party this year. We poured the punch into a clear punch bowl with black skulls on it, and it looked very festive.

If you like grape kool aid you will love it.  I wasn't impressed.  It was just OK to me.  I'm glad I tested it out before our Halloween party this yr.  We've decided to go with another punch.

looks spooky....but it's suppose to.  Tastes great though.  Kid's loved it right off.  Adults had to get past the "muddy look" but liked the flavor once they tasted it.  Great Idea!!!!

Not that great, definately shouldn't have used so much sugar, I like less than a full cup in koolaid anyway. Didn't get quite black either, more brown.

This was good but would definitely appeal more to kids than adults.  The color was nice and the hand was a lot of fun, but even with vodka it was a little to Kool Aid-y.

To keep the hand from melting too fast, make it out of gelatin. It will eventually fall apart but the chunks add another spooky effect. Make sure to use an NON-LATEX glove as some people have severe latex allergies.

This was perfect for my son's spooky birthday party. It was easy to make, and tasted great. The kids loved the color. I added some bat and ghost ice cubes and a frozen hand made of ice to float in the bowl.

This tasted quite strange to the adults at the party, but the kids loved it and that's who it's for, right? LOL It also had an awesome bubbly effect when the ginger ale was added so that was cool for Halloween too. Thanks for the recipe!

As a person who doesn't really like punch, I was skeptical of any punch recipe.  But I came across this one and decided to fix it for my guests at a Halloween party.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and spiked it with some rum and it was *incredible*!  I was very impressed, and will make this again for Halloween or an Over-The-Hill party!

Hosted a halloween themed birthday party for my 7 yr old and this punch was a hit!!!  The kids LOVED the floating ice hands, I made 2 to keep the punch cold for a few hours.  What a fantastic idea!  Thanks!

I love this recipe, had to not do the Ginger ale due to a problem with carbonated drinks and IBS....so used additional quart of lemon coolaid, added sugar, also made a few of the frozen hands, broke the fingers so they would float and drinkers could get a finger ice cube...eeeek! :)

Great recipe - We add a couple cups of Blueberry juice cocktail to darken things up a bit. I've also substituted orange soda when I couldn't find the orange Kool-Aid and it was yummy and extra fizzy!   I use Cherry Kool-Aid for the hands to make them both bloody in appearance and keep the punch from diluting as they melt.  I find that using a plastic cup as a holder for the hand as it freezes makes it less likely to make a mess in the freezer and gives the fingers a lovely 'claw-like' appearance.

The kids thought it was okay, but didn't ask for seconds. The parents did not like it at all.  The floating hand looked cool, but we lost two fingers in the glove when removing.  Next year I will look for another punch recipe.

The punch tasted like sparkling koolaid. OF COURSE! I doubled the recipe and only used 3 cups sugar.  The fingers on the hand melted fast! But it was cool while it lasted. I'm giving it 5 stars because this punch did what it was suppose to do for cheap!

Lots of fun!  I couldn't find grape or orange koolaid, so I used black cherry and tangerine.  The color wasn't black, so I added a drop of green food coloring to do the trick.  Kids loved it, so did the grownups!  The floating hand was the best :)

This punch was great! I reduced the amount of sugar so it wouldn't be quite so sweet. It was a huge hit! Kids loved it as did the parents. We'll certainly make it again next year.

I made this for a Halloween party for kids.  It wasn't black, more like dark brown.  But it was very tasty!  It was enjoyed by both adults and children.  I would make it again.

While the idea of this is great, the taste isn't as important as the way it looks. Unfortunately, the hands melt really quickly, so not everyone sees how cool this looks. I made it for an office party. If I made it again, for a non office party I might just spike it with something.

i made this at a Halloween party this past Saturday and it didn’t go over as well as I hoped for. The kids enjoyed it, but the adults didn’t really care for the sweetness. If I make this again, I will cut down on the sugar a bit…2 cups was too much in my option. But it was good. Thanks!

Very tasty punch and was a big hit for Halloween dinner!

Pretty good. I served this at our block party and called it Black Cat Punch. Several of us adults drank it but not so many kids. Perhaps the color put them off. ??

Tasted like bad grape soda- looked like the water in the cup after you rinse off a paintbrush. Not very 'punch-like'.

Made it for a party last night and ran out! Replaced the ginger ale with club soda and vodka and put limes in it to cut the sweetness. I will triple the recipe next year.

This punch was a big hit at our Halloween party last week.  At first I wasn't sure if we needed it cause we had so many other drinks.  Once I made it though, the guests were asking for a second batch shortly afterwards.  I did add some vodka to it to give it a bit more punch though, and it went over really well.  I'll probably be serving it again next Halloween. =)

This was very good.  I made it for my families Halloween party and everyone really enjoyed it.  My only complaint would be that it turned to a brown and nowhere near black, but it still had everyone making second guesses about taking a sip.

The color of this was a hit, it looked gross. My kids loved the taste. I thought it was a bit sweet. I even left out almost half the sugar considering I was adding ginger ale. For some reason you couldn't see the fingers in the hand when I added it to the punch, they sunk maybe because they had gummy worms in them. I did fill the glove with red koolade though so it still was cool. Definitely a kids drink either way  though. I got a brain mold to try that next year. Will probably make againg but I won't be drinking it.

Way too sweet!!! I doubled the recipe for a big office party, but instead of using 4 cups of sugar I only used 3 thinking that would be just right, blah! My 12 year old even thought it was too sweet! I added about another quart of water and it tasted a little better.  The hand of ice, while cool looking, was more of a hassle to deal with and I made two and lost fingers on both, but that made it kind of cool with floating fingers.

Made double the requested amount. Turned out good. But kids ages 5 to 10 just love the sugar. One 7 year old girl wouldn't drink it because of the hand lol.

Great tasting punch and looked great too with dark color as pictured. Next time will use 1/2 the sugar though.
Also the frozen hand was tricky. The glove didn't seem to fill up evenly and fingers broke trying to remove the glove but still looked good with 2 fingers (it is Halloween after all and a 'severed hand'). Next time may look for ice tray mold .

Made this for an all ages party. We mixed it with just the water in one big bowl and added sprite or ginger ale to cups for the kids, and with lime flavored hard seltzer for the adults!

This stuff was aweful! Followed recipe to a T. It was a brown color. My guests went and got something else to drink and poured this out.

This can have vodka or vanilla vodka added to make it as strong as you'd like.  A double batch satisfied our party of about 30 with other drink options available.  It looks cool and tastes fine.  I thought it tasted a little bit like bubble gum with the vanilla vodka.  Orange kool aid was a bit difficult to find at our local Safeway.
