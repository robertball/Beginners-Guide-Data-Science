I enjoyed this. It was easy and quick, and the instructions for the bananas was right on. The sauce though, would have benefited from less alcohol - I probably used 2/3 of what the recipe stated and it still tasted like a bit too much. That said, I will still make this again - it was a fast, easy, and elegant dessert. Thank you!

I expected the chocolate sauce to be a little thicker.  Also, I thought the alcohol was really over powering for me.

After I cooked the bananas I dipped them in the chocolate sauce and then placed them on plate, I sprinkled them with confectioners sugar whipped cream in middle, nuts on top.!!!

I had no problem with the amount of Triple Sec. I used whole milk instead of cream, and I added the powdered sugar. Loved it, and so did my dinner guests.

I made this to use up some frozen bananas, some strawberries and some oranges.  Made the chocolate sauce without the orange liquor.  I didn't have any on hand and since several people made remarks it was too much alcohol.  I substituted the juice of an orange and orange zest.  Used chocolate milk instead of cream.  Cooked it a little longer to get a good consistency.  I fried the bananas, quartered the oranges that I had "peeled" with knife and some sliced strawberries.  Placed the fruit on a platter and dribbled chocolate over it all.   Even without the alcohol it still had that flavor.  I'm not sure where that flavor came from. I forgot the vanilla so it wasn't from that.   It was a great way to use up the fruit and it was a light dessert after a big dinner.

Way to over powering with the alcohol,ended up putting them in crepes and adding a strawberry fruit dip and a lil whipped cream
