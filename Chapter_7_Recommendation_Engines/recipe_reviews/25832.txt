I LOVED this... I had to make it my own, so I made the cream cheese layer (with splenda blend) and tried variations to it by spreading a layer of either apricot, blueberry, blackberry or strawberry sugarfree preserves over the cream cheese then finishing off with the crescent dough and butter and splenda blend sprinkled on top... OMG, I had to make this 3 times in 2 days due to so many people loving it over the holidays!!!  No one could guess it was sugarfree..  the fruit topping over the creamcheese really gives it kick!  My fav were the blueberry ones, and the apricot... with the apricot I crushed 1/2 C of pecans and sprinkled those over the top with cinnamon and splenda blend.. that was sheer heaven.  Even better the next day if thats even possible!  I am thinking about trying this with a variation of no sugar, but using a packet of hidden valley ranch powder and bacon and maybe some sundried tomatoes... maybe butter and parmesan on top?... I will let you know!

I make these squares more than 2 dozen times a year!! They are the most popular thing I make.  I'm a always asked to make them for everything.  You will always be a hit, 100% of the time when you bring these to any event. I prefer to line my baking pan with aluminum foil for easy removal and refridgerate overnight.  I then remove them from the pan and slice then arrange them on a serving platter.  Works great everytime,

I have made these with so many different toppings!! They are great with pretty much anything. I have used lemon zest, blueberry topping, fresh strawberries, apples and cinnamon and i'm thinking maybe brown sugar and cinnamon next time. I love these things!! And don't pour that much butter over the top. I found it best to just brush on a thin coat and if you alter it, like adding strawberries, you may want to omit the sugar and cinnamon on the top.

My daughters and I made this recipe for Christmas gifts. We changed it slightly by using a mini muffin pan. We greased the pan and sprinkled cinnamon sugar in the bottom of each muffin hole. Pressed a piece of crescent roll in each hole, filled with cream cheese mixture and topped with a piece of crescent roll. Cooked in 10 minutes. They turned out great. Little bite size cream cheese balls. Plus the girls and I had fun making them.

We weren't crazy about the recipe as written. The second time I made it I used only one package of cream cheese, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and added a squirt of lemon juice and just brushed the top with melted butter. It was much better this way. Also, I didn't put sugar on the top, just mixed up powdered sugar and a bit of milk and make a white glaze. Thanks for the post.

I tried this recipe for a party recently and they haven't stopped bragging about it.  Everyone wants the recipe.  I took another commenter's suggestions and added lemon zest - which made the recipe!  Trust me on this one - you have just found the quickest and easiest crowd pleasing dessert around!

Delicious!  We love them cold.  They were incredibly fast & easy to put together!  I used half the butter, reduced fat crescent rolls & reduced fat cream cheese.  Wait until they are well chilled before cutting into bars.  For the time and effort these are excellent! UPDATE #1: I've made these several times and everyone loves them.  I tried the addition of fruit preserves and did not like it at all UPDATE #2: I usually make this in my 9X13 glass Pyrex but made it in a 9X13 metal cake pan and it was horrible -overcooked around the edges and the crescent dough on the bottom was raw in the center of the pan.  I'll have to remember to always use my glass pan for this recipe.

Great recipe! I only used 3/4 c sugar and will cut down on the butter next time...maybe only 1/4 c. I also added an egg to the cream cheese mixture. It was much fluffier!

Simple and tasty! I used puff pastry and added 1 tsp of lemon butter into cream cheese mixture. It tasted better when chilled, especially with the crispy melted sugar at the bottom. Also, it will be easier to cut into pieces when the cheese is fully set. Both my fiance and I loved it very much, will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

These are wonderful! I made this just as the recipe calls for as you should if you are going to rate it!! I hate when people change the entire thing then give a lousey rating. My husband is very hard to get a compliment out of and he absolutley loved these. Thank you so much for the recipe. Anyone that doesn't give this a 5 star, needs their head examined.......

I halved the recipe, and thought this was really good but I will reduce the sugar that mixes with the cream cheese by half next time, and added orange and lemon zest, which I thought added a nice flavor.  I also needed to half the butter.  I like this cold or warm.

I know you're thinking this sounds way too easy to be good, but give it a try.  You'll love it!  It's SO easy AND delicious!  A relative on my husband's side passed this recipe along to me several years ago and it gets rave reviews by everyone who tries it.  

My own mom has spoiled my family on homemade desserts -- pies, cakes, cookies, breads, you name it.  The first time I took these cream cheese crescents to a gathering on my side of family everyone loved it.  They couldn't believe it was made with crescent rolls of all things.  They had these one long gone before the other (time-consuming) homemade desserts were even touched.

These were soooooooooo good!  I followed others' suggestions to use 1 pkg of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1 egg in the filling.  I also just used 1 tbsp of butter brushed on the top and 1 tbsp of sugar.  I'm glad I used less filling- any more would have been overpowering.  My husband LOVED this.  He couldn't believe it was so tasty even though I "cut out so much of the good stuff"!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe well over 20 times now. This is a timeless recipe. So quick, easy and very tasty. I use splenda sugar instead of regular sugar. I cut the original sugar to 3/4 cups as others had suggested. If you use splenda cut the 3/4 cups in half, spenda sugar is sweeter. I have tried many things using this recipe. Here are the things I have tried; For the butter on top, I have used pastry brush and have poured the butter over the top. I only pour over the top now as this makes it crispier. The less handling you do of the crescent, the fluffier the crust will be. Add ons I have done are Chocolate, I mixed chocolate and vanilla pudding, 3 cups milk and 3/4 package (8 oz) cream cheese mixed and used in place of the cream cheese, this came out tasty but runnier. Lemon squeezed in the cream cheese mixture very good adds a little kick to the cheese, and Strawberry glaze over the top, which needless to say is very good. I have enjoyed the other ways of making it but make the cinnamon and sugar more often and is always liked by all. I have also made them into little puffs. I had cut the crescent into small rectangles and put in a mini muffin pan, then filled them with the cream cheese mixture. Then criss crossed the corners to close and brushed on butter and sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar. This worked great for a work potluck. they were easier for then to pop in their mouth. This is such a great recipe. Thank you for sharing this one. It has become a family favorite.

Great recipe!  I made these for a big brunch this weekend and they were a HUGE hit!  I used frozen puff pastry instead of crescent rolls and poured an entire jar of pumpkin butter (from TJs) over the cream cheese mix.  I put them in the fridge for 30 mins to set up before slicing into triangles.  I served them at room temp and they were phenomenal!  I snuck one into the fridge for a selfish little snack for myself later and was surprised to find the filling still soft when it was completely chilled.  Not cheesecake-y at all as some described, but maybe that was because of my pumpkin butter addition.  For me, this recipe was a wonderful inspiration that I'm looking forward to experimenting with.  I keep thinking of different flavor ideas... How good would hazelnut cream cheese be in there?  Or even skip the sugar and do something savory like chive cream cheese and smoked salmon?  Caramellized onions and bacon?  Love, love, love this recipe!  Try it!  You too will be inspired!

Great Recipe. Although I didn't follow it exactly as mentioned.  I found other reviewers tweeks and suggestions very helpful. 
Things that made this recipe great for me:
1. Only used 1/2 cup of sugar. (not 1Cup)
2. Added a layer of raspberry jam to the top of the cream cheese. (give it some color)
3. lightly buttered the top layer rather than pour 1/2 cup of butter over entire thing. 
4. Once done baking, I cooled to room temp and refrigerated over night. 
DELISH!!! Hope my suggestions help.

made this for Christmas dinner, it was gone in a flash! loved it.  I read different reviews and I took about 1/2c of seedless raspberry jam heated it up in the microwave added couple of handfuls of cranberries to it. Spread that on the cream cheese layer.  Added the top crust.  I then put it in the oven while we ate the dinner.  My guest who says cannot eat sweets, loved it.  Asked for a doggy  bag to take home.

Made these exactly by recipe last night. My family loved them, they must have, as they were gone this morning. Next time I'm going to use less cream cheese and sugar, but add a thin layer of homemade raspberry preserves.

Used 1 pkg of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 egg as suggested and WOW they were FANTASTIC!  Tastes good warm, but exactly like cheesecake when cold from the fridge.  No doubt you could add any typical cheesecake flavor to the filling (skor bits, turtles for example) and it would turn out great.  I thought about putting some sort of fruit filling underneath the top layer but then every slice would taste the same.  It's more versatile to just put whichever topping you prefer on top, because honestly these are great as is.  FANTASTIC recipe!  Thanks!!!

If you don't have control of you self control, do not make these!  I made these about 2 hours ago, and I've eaten about 1/4 of it!  The cooler they get the better they are!  

I used the same amount of sugar, I only use butter, and I only used half of the butter called for.  The way I made these, I would give it a 4 star.  It's my own fault, I should have used all the butter called for.  Regardless, these are spot on delicious!  I can see I'm going to have to make these only once in a while.  With these, I have no self control!
MAKE THESE FANTASTIC SQUARES!

Love this!  The first time I made it, I did a savory version (mixed in some veggie soup mix with the cream cheese and sprinkled herbs on top) which was fantastic!  People couldn't stop talking about it and it's now "the thing" I have to bring to every function! :)  I have the original version in the oven right now and judging by the flavor of the cream cheese mixture, they're going to be GREAT!  Great recipe!

this is by far the best dessert I have ever eaten. If you are looking for that cream cheese taste, look no further. This is the one. My husband and children all love this. I make at least once a week in my home. It is super easy and affordable but at the same time doesnt cut back on taste. This is my go to recipe for bake sales and family gatherings. Everyone want more everytime!!!!!!!!

I give it a *three star only because of the convenience. I did not pour all of the 1/4 sugar to sprinkle over the top! WAY TO SWEET! It was too salty also, so I would use "reduced fat" cresent roll dough! other than that it came out fantastic, very good!

Oh my God - Are these squares ever delicious, can't believe how wonderful they are.  I went to the store to get more ingredients to make them again on the weekend.  These ones won't last very long in my house.  I don't think you need 1/2 cup of melted marg. drizzled over them though, 1/4 cup was just perfect.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Made these once for a small gathering and they were a HUGE hit! So I made them again for our housewarming party and the dish was literally gone before anyone even got past the main course and on to the sweets! Everyone was asking what they were and how to make them. Super simple to throw together- my only issue was the amount of butter. By the time I poured that on top, it pretty much was a pool of butter. The second time I made them, I only brushed the butter on top (less than half the amount called for) with a pastry brush and they turned out a lot better. The next time I make these, I will also mix a smaller amount of cinnamon & sugar together to sprinkle on top so it won't look so dark after baking. The lighter color look was more appealing to guests. Great recipe, and thanks for sharing!

Made it as noted the first time. Very good.

Second time leaned toward savory, rather than sweet. In addition to the cream cheese I added 1/2 cup Feta crumbles, 1/4 grated Parmesan, a package of onion/chive dip mix and some fresh chopped chives.  For the topping, 1/2 cup melted butter with more chopped fresh chives and about 1/4 parmesan.  Came out AWESOME.

I should have known better - my intuition said the dough would be dense and not pastry-like and there was just too much cream cheese and butter in this recipe.  My intuition was right - this was not good.  Too sweet, too dense, too buttery.  Maybe using puff pastry and less cream cheese but there are so many better recipes if you want to squander 214 calories and 14.2g of fat for 1/24th of this??  Who cuts a 9/13 pan into 24 servings - realistically?
My advice - make yourself a nice cheesecake and forget this mess.

YUMMY !  you do NOT need to dump all that butter/margarine on top, though.  would be perfectly good just brushed on. 
I will make this again for parties.   I some blueberry pie filling under the top crust.   I have also made something very similar with finely chopped apples.  LOVE IT !

Yum-Yum-4-da-Tum-Tum. These were great! The only change I made was I added a tsp of lemon zest into the cream cheese mixture. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup for the cream cheese mixture. Delicious! We tried them warm and thought they were too rich, but they were much better after we chilled them. The great thing about this recipe is that it is so versatile! I need to make these again!

I have been making these every holiday season (Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas) for years... The original is great just as written, I do also add an egg for the fluffiness.. but I do always make a second batch with dollops of jam, and I have found an excellent one - at aldi's its called fruits of the forest... its a mix of berries with a little chunky consistancy.... excellent!!! I think I might try with some pie filling this year also.  Love this recipe!!!!

We love these! Very easy, very versatile! I use the seamless crescent dough, only 1.5 packages of cream cheese and 2/3C sugar, which makes plenty of filling that's perfectly sweetened. Our favorite version of these is to lay down the cream cheese layer, then add a layer of the Blueberry Breakfast Sauce (from this site) before placing the other roll of crescent dough on top. Also, I only use 1/4 melted butter for the topping. Amazing!

I just made this last night for our Christmas dinner!  Very easy!  I used cinnamon, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice on the bottom layer as well as the top.  I also drizzled caramel and homemade chocolate sauce on the top.  Even better the next day.

5+++++!  So yummy!  People go crazy for these.  I get so many compliments each time I make them.  An easy recipe - but so delicious.  They definitely taste better once they have sat in the refrigerator over night.  I reduce the melted butter to 3 tblsp. and that is more than enough.  I also add chopped pecans on top with the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Thanks so much for sharing a great recipe!

These are soooo good! And easy. I put apple pie mix that I make under the top crust and just brush on the butter. Tried with egg in the batter, they just oozed everywhere, didn't have any problem without it so I probably won't do that again! Have made 3 x already!

Very easy.  I will make again with just one package cream cheese.  I followed another reviewer's recommendation and used a jar of cherry preserves under the cream cheese.

My new favorite from AR.  I made half a recipe in an 8 x 8 pyrex pan, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I was craving a cheese danish and this fit the bill.  Thanks.

To get my chocolate fix, I added a layer of Nutella over the cream cheese.  I put a little Nutella in a dish, and warmed it in the microwave for a few seconds, just long enough for an easier spreading consistancy. yum.  There was extra of the cream cheese mixture, so I saved it.  I had an extra can of cresent rolls, so I split the rolls individually, spread a layer of the cream cheeese, rolled them up, and topped them with the butter-sugar-cinnamon step from the recipe.  Baked according to the can directions. Great warm or cold (like the Squares).

Wanted something sweet after dinner last night and remembered this recipe.I followed the recipe as written. Boy, were these good!! The family loved them. I have to say that they seem far richer tasting when hot and to do taste a lot like cheesecake when cold. Either way they are fantastic. I will be making these often....thanks for the great and easy recipe.

I made these exactly as written the first time and they were delicious.  However, my favorite ingredient with cream cheese is pineapple, so the next time I made this, I put a layer of pineapple preserves on the first layer of dough with the cream cheese on top of the pineapple and the dough on top.  Really, really good!

This was Superb! People asked me for the recipe. I did tweak it a bit with advice of the readers comments.

I used fat free cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls.  I substituted almond extract for the vanilla and added 1 jar of strawberry preserves.  A pastry squeeze bag comes in handy for that or layer it first before adding your cream cheese.  I didn't use all the margarine (or butter which is what I used) in the recipe because it was more than enough.  I sprinkled the top lightly with cinnamon sugar (omitting the sugar and ground cinnamon altogether.)

I have been making this recipe since a friend brought it to a Christmas party last month. It is the best easiest recipe. But I have been tinkering with it a little. I use 1 1/2 pkg of cream cheese instead of 2, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1 egg separated, no butter or cinnamon and instead of vanilla I use almond extract or ameretto. I also sometimes mince up some white chocolate to add to the mixture and sometimes I also add a thin layer of raspberry preserves to one side (make sure it is a thin layer otherwises it will be to runny)I don't put it across the entire pan so there will be some variety when I cut them in squares and put on a serving tray, you can use all different types of fruit toppings. Before I put it in the oven I brush the egg white over the top and sprinkle 1/4 c (or less) sugar over it. I bake on 350 for 30 minutes. When they are about to come out of the oven I make a powered sugar icing using powered sugar, warm milk and almond extract. I drizzle this over the top when I take the pan out of the oven. Once out of the oven I can't help but eat a piece or two but it is best if you let them cool and then put in the frig. They are much easier to cut after they are cold. I have taken these several places in the last month and they are a huge hit each time.

Simply Scrumptious!!  I actually made  half of this recipe by using only half of all of the ingredients, and then I baked it in a loaf pan.  I used only one package of crescent dough and cut it in half...each half fit perfectly in my loaf pan.  Although, I took the advice of others and used a bit less than half of the butter.  After it cooled, I thought it was good, but I like my cheese cake really cold, so I put it in the refrigerator, and OH MY!!!  It was heavenly...absolutely incredible!  I would give it more stars if I could! I cannot wait to make it again, and next time, I'm going to make the whole batch! :)  Thanks so much Ann!

Adjust the cooking time a little - mine was still gooey after 30 minutes, but this is YUMMY!!!   I added a teaspoon of lemon zest to the cream cheese layer for some extra "zing" and everyone who tried one begged for the recipe.  I'm a caterer and if I can figure out a way to "dress it up" a bit, I may just use it for a dessert at one of my dinners!  Any suggestions?

This is probably my favorite desert...ever. I can bring it to any party and everyone loves it. It is very fattening and it's hard for me to stop myself from eating more than one serving, but sometimes we have to enjoy the little things in life. Many people said that they changed the recipe and added or took out things, but I think it tastes just perfect the way it is. I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone, weather you're going to a party or just making it a home for a little gathering.

SOOOO GOOD! I halved the recipe (using an 8x8 pyrex baking dish), but still used 1-1/2 blocks of cream cheese b/c I wanted a nice thick layer. These were so simple to make...I tasted a piece after they cooled and the flavor is great! These also cut beautifully, fyi. I am planning on serving these for dessert w/ fresh strawberries, a little chocolate sauce and whipped cream. This is definitely a winner and a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Use 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 egg with the cream cheese. This will make the cream cheese not so sweet and a good contrast to the sugar and cinnamon on top. ALWAYS use butter in this recipe, not margarine!

Very good and super easy. I've been baking this one for years and I looked it up when I couldn't find my recipe card. You can halve the recipe and bake it in an 8x8" pan. Also, go ahead and get the Pillsbury Crescent "Seamless Dough Sheet" (1 can for 8x8" or 2 for 9x13"). You won't have to press seams together and you'll have a prettier presentation.

Wow! These were so amazing ...and easy. I made the recipe exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing. The buttery, cinnamon sugar crust was probably the best thing I've ever tasted. I will be making these squares often.

10 STARS!!  This was so easy and so good!  You can add fruit or fruit topping to jazz it up, but it is delicious just the way the recipe is.  I did add a little more cinnamon and sugar to the top - personal preference.

I was shocked at just how good these are.  I was looking for something quick to make with ingredients I had on hand.  These are so rich and delicious.  Be sure to let them cool completely before cutting.  I will definitely make these again.

This was FAB!!  Its perfect for a brunch.  Especially if you want to do things ahead of time. I did the layers the night before and did the margarine and cinnamon sugar the next day before baking.  The office loved it!

OK, this is a 6 point recipe! WOOHOO!! I have been baking today to take slices to a wedding buffet. I am dieting and this is the ONE that I decided I would taste and I think I made a very good choice. Now I have to get it into the freezer before I get back at it. Try it, it is well worth the minimal effort it requires.

HUGE HIT!!!  I was a little nervous because they seemed to puff up quite a bit while cooking, but once I let them cool completely and cut them, they were fine. I only changed a couple things; I thought that a 1/2 cup of melted butter was a bit excessive, so I only ended up doing about 1/3.  I also added some sugar free strawberry jam-I spread it even over the cream cheese filling-and it was the perfect amount of tart to go with the sweet.  Will be making again for sure!

I just love this recipe.  I have made several times.  I do add an egg to the cream cheese mixture.  Sometimes I also add 1/2 tsp of rum extract to the cream cheese.  I always add Apricot preserves (about 1 1/2 cups).  Stir the preserves really well in a small bowl to make it easier to spread on top of the cream cheese mixture.  I use just 1/4 cup (or even less) of butter for the top.

I made this last night and this recipe is a keeper. I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x9 glass dish (there's only the 2 of us). I agree that brushing the butter on is better. I poured it on and because it wasn't completely smooth the butter pooled in the low spots. I also added almond extract and then spread some melted cherry jam on before I put the top on. I did have some trouble closing the perforations (they opened up when I lifted it into the pan) but I just closed them up again.So what if the top has these little gaps. They mostly close up in the cooking. It was delicious and my husband wants me to make it again. I'll try different jams or toppings next time and maybe try it with puff pastry. I think you can do a lot to this recipe.

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  This is excellent and so easy to make. I halved the recipe just to try it out, followed recipe exactly as written for the first batch.  THEN HAD TO MAKE a second batch of this wonderful dessert and put Blueberry preserve's on top of bottom layer of crust then spread cream cheese on top, oh my goooodness, made it even better than the first batch !!!  This is beyond good !!  Can not wait to try raspberry preserve for the third batch.  Thank You so very much for sharing !!

I have made this recipe but before I had the top layer of crescent rolls, I add fresh slices apples and sprinkled the apples with cinnamon and sugar.  Put the second layer of crescent rolls on top of the apples.  It really adds a great flavor to the dessert!!

this is a excellent desert!  I read the other reviews & did a few things diff like suggested.  less sugar inside & OUT!!!  also added LEMON zest!  pretty simple & had most items on hand.  a few thing they don't mention in any of the reviews I read & the directions:  1 is soften cream cheese by letting it get room temp so it blends really well w/ the sugar & vanilla.  next, the butter kinda melts into the cheese section so u can form the top- aside by pressing it together & press up the 4 edges, just be careful during transfer that the seems don't rip.  this is my new favorite thing 2 make & serve & EAT!!!

Putting my own spin on this recipe made it awesome! I added 1 egg, apples, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp lemon juice to the filling. I made a crumb topping instead of just laying on sugar and cinnamon. The crumb topping was 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup cold butter and a TBS cinnamon. The result was great! Would be delicious with cherries or peaches as well. I love this recipe ~ Thanks for sharing! :)

Simple and yummy!  I skipped the melted margarine and sprayed a little spray margarine - a lot simpler and reduces the greasiness, as well as fat and calories.  I've used reduced fat crescents and neufchatel cheese with great results as well!!

This recipe was nice, but not spectacular as I expected. I found the filling to be a little too sweet for my liking and even though I cut the amount of butter in half it was still too much. I will try this recipe again though, with a few changes I think.

I've had a similar recipe for years and it is one of my easy favorites. I add 1 teaspoon almond extract with 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, then add an egg yolk to the cream cheese mixture, and only 3/4 cup sugar. Instead of the butter on top, I brush the pastry with the egg white (much healthier and makes the top shiny) and sprinkle  a bit of regular sugar on it. I cannot imagine all that butter! Crescent roll sheets make this even easier. Oh- don't forget to chill these! Soooo good.

Brought this to a potluck today and it was raved about!  I added a layer of homemade jam on top of the cream cheese, omitted the cinnamon and used a little less margarine.  Without my changes I know it would still be 5 star worthy! Very quick and easy too!

I have made these before but lost the recipe!  They are so good and like others have said, you can easily make them sugar free by using Splenda instead of sugar.  I also add all fruit preserves to the top of the cream cheese which others have suggested.  You can also substitute puff pastry for this.  Just put one sheet in the botom and one on the top, but you will have to slightly roll out or stretch the puff pastry to have it fit a 13x9 pan.  Ooooooh, making these this weekend, can't wait.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I used pastry puffw instead of cresent rolls, because that is what I had on hand. I baked the squares for 30-35 minutes to allow the pastry to "puff". Delish!

Excellent!  I made them with strawberry preserves.  It is very sweet so you can cut back on the sugar.

These are delicious!  I liked the idea of adding some sweet to it.  The only jam I had in the house was a mixed berry flavor, so I added a thin layer on top of the cream cheese before putting the top layer of crescent rolls on.  Very yummy!  I cut the recipe in half.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  I would like to try it with apricot jam.  Definitely a yummy decadent dessert!

Wow - perfect in every way!  Just the right sweetness, the pastry was excellent and the topping was exceptional.  I was going to use butter (rather than margarine) and use brown sugar as well (cause I love it), but I like to try recipes the way they're written first.  And it was just perfect the way it's written - thanks so much for an extremely easy and truly delicious desert!

Have made these over and over! Took the advice of other reviewers and brushed the butter on top instead of pouring it. Have tried this recipe with fruit preserves but everyone agreed that made it too sweet; these are perfect with the cream cheese filling alone!

This is a simple delicious recipe.  I love the crescent roll crust.  When I poured all the butter onto I was worried but it cooked up just right.  Tastes like a decedent cheese cake that is simple to make!  I have made this many times and it is always a hit!

Oh man, I'm in heaven...  I made these almost exactly as written 'cept I used my tub margarine (melted) on top.  These are SOOOO good!!!  It seems like there's too much melted butter (margarine) and sugar on top, but the sugar hardens like on creme brulee and it's SO SO GOOD!  I would cook it for the full 30 min's if not more.  I did mine for 33 and could probably cook it more for an even crisper top.  Just watch it after 30 min's.

Ohhhhhhhhhhh my goodness!!!!  These deserve more than 5 stars!  I have to get these things out of the house before I eat all of them.  I knew I would like them after reading the ingredients, but did not think they would be that extra amazing, BUT they are!  I did not make any changes, but will probably reduce the butter a little next time (but I am NOT complaining!).  I would like to play around with adding fruit preserves or honey sometime just for fun, but they are really fantastic just as the recipe states.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this the other night and it disappeared. I followed others advice and the only changes I made were to use Splenda in place of sugar, and I added Blueberry Simply fruit spread on top of the cream cheese mixture. My son thought it was the best recipe ever. The possibilities with this recipe are endless. I can't wait to try other toppings. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very good. I cut the recipe in half, using an 8x8 square baking pan, but used less of the topping, adding 1/4 chopped pecans and mixed the butter with it before spreading on top of the bars. I also added extra vanilla to the filling.

My husband has declared this a 5-star recipe.  I made exactly according to directions, except to cut the whole recipe in half...baked in an 8x8" glass pan.  SOOOOO easy.  Thanks. :-)

These were easy to make and quite tasty, but a little hard to eat.  When I bit down into one the filling squished out the sides.  The kids didn't seem to like them, so I'll have to rate this down a bit.  I might try adding an egg to the filling to see if it will stand up a bit better.

Ann - what a great and simple idea for breakfast - these can hold their own compared to all the other delectable breakfast items served. I plan to try them again on Mother's Day making half plain cream cheese and half using the strawberry cream cheese.  Thanks again Ann!

This was a great, quick dessert! My fiance' loved it. I got home and realized that I had no sugar, so I made a less sweet version by using Splenda in the cream cheese, but less than what the receipe called for, added an egg, key lime peel and used 1/2 tsp of vanilla & 1/s tsp of almond. I too decided to brush on the butter (used less this way, but acheived great results!) and sprinkled with Splenda & Cinnamon. Added Splenda-sweetened strawberries when serving. I will definitely be making this one again.

I took this to my MOPS meeting, and I was late getting there, I stuck it on the brunch table and by the time I got through the line, it was nearly gone.  By the end of the meeting, it was totally gone.  I can't believe something so simple can be so yummy!  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

Defines rich!  Very very good; however would cut
cream cheese down to 1 1/2 pkgs if I were to make it again.  Don't think I will make it again though -  too tempting to overindulge!

Quick and easy isn't always good but this one was. I didn't half this or double that nor did I omit those and add these. I wanted to review this recipe not submit my own. Mixed as stated and it was delicious.  Everyone loved the cinnamon on top. Like cinnamon toast and who in their right mind doesn't like cinnamon toast. I think it is a lot better cold out of the fridge. This one is a keeper.

This was absolutely fabulous...and I hate when folks make changes (saying "I followed the recipe exactly, except...") but I did use half the butter. It pooled up in the top when I used it all when I made it the first time. And (I know, I know), I also substituted a vanilla bean for the vanilla extract. Other than that, I followed the recipe "exactly." :) Great recipe! We love it!

Delicious! Just brush the top with butter instead of pouring the amount listed in the recipe on top. If you are at altitude like I am (7600 ft) make sure to up the baking temperature and give extra time for the center crust to rise and brown.

These turned out awesome! I didn't have any vanilla extract or cinnamon, so I didn't use any of that. And I decided to only use a spoonful of melted butter for the top and only a cup of sugar for the cream cheese mixture. Definitely going to make this again!

This recipe is excellent! I followed the recipe to a T, with one exception.  I read some of the reviews that said the bottom crust was a bit soggy, so I put just the bottom crust in the 350 oven for 5 minutes. Then spread the cheese and cooked as normal.  The crust is golden brown on the bottom, and not soggy at all!  This recipe will defintiely be added to my recipe box!

I made this wonderful recipe today and it was just delicious. I did make a minor adjustment. I only used 2/3 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup when whipping the cream cheese layer. I also adjusted the recipe by adding 1/2 of a 12oz can of Solo brand Poppyseed Filling, spread in a thin layer on top of the cream cheese layer before adding the top layer of dough. The resulting coffeecake was fabulous. I have added a photo.

I made this with reduced fat crescent rolls, which was fine. I did not want to use the cinnamon. I also subbed Splenda for half the sugar and did add an egg to the cream cheese mix, but don't know if it made a difference and will probably leave it out next time because it is so calorie dense anyway :-/ (but worth it!). I will definitely make a simply powdered sugar glaze next time to make it more like a true Danish. I think it would be great with strawberry jam on top of the cream cheese mixture. Will be making it again this weekend for my boyfriend when he comes to visit, it was very yummy - thanks for the recipe!

I didn't love the recipe as written.  But I did love the recipe after I made a few changes.  I only used 1 package of cream cheese and half the sugar (though I made it with splenda and 1/3 the fat cream cheese).  I used lemon zest and juice in the cheese layer and then put a layer of homemade jam over the top.  I made mine with strawberries and blueberries, but you can use whatever jam you like.  The fruit really cut through the cloying cheese layer and it was really good.  Also, I'd recommend par-cooking the bottom crust for five minutes and cooling before adding the rest.  Brush the top with butter, because there's no need for a half cup of butter or margarine to keep the cinnamon sugar on top.  With these changes, we loved it.  Still a good base recipe to make your own.

Delish! Only had one can of crescent rolls so I halved  the recipe with a few exceptions. Used an 8 X 8 pan. Used 4 oz. of cream cheese & 1/4 cup sugar & one big squeeze of lemon juice.  On top of cream cheese layer I added a layer of raspberry jam. I brushed the top layer of dough with butter and sprinkled with sugar only.  25 minutes of baking time was just right. Next time I might try sprinkling some mini chocolate chips on the filling. The filling options are endless. Use what you like. I do recommend that you half the cream cheese filling if you also add another filling on top like jam, chocolate chips, chocolate hazelnut spread, etc.

I made this today, with just two changes.  I used light cream cheese and put a layer of fruit preserves on top of the cream cheese.  I will make it again, but I will use less, if any, sugar in the cream cheese.  I would also skip the butter and sugar on top.  It's rich enough without it.  Overall, very good as a breakfast treat.

These would have been perfect had I listened to the other reviews. Half the cream cheese mixture and brushing the top with real butter instead of a half cup of margarine. I love cream cheese, but it's overwhelming! I did use a raspberry jam layer before I added the cream cheese and the two went great together. Hope this helps.

Make this all the time. Everyone loves. The recipe I have has you use the crescent roll "sheets" which fit a 9x13 plan perfectly. Also, this is better when served cold. While the dough is puffed up when you take it out of oven, it falls and makes a great crust with cinnamon/sugar mixture.

My go to recipe when I need to make bars for an event or even just for my family. My grandmother used to make rommegrot bars and these taste just like them only 20x easier to make. There's only one problem--they are FAR too addicting. I will only make them if there are plenty of people around to eat them up as if I'm alone with them, I cannot resist!  I do add some extra cinnamon sugar since I am a sugar freak. Otherwise these are perfect!

I was so excited to make these and figured they would turn out perfectly with all of the great reviews. I used less butter than suggested (about 1/3 cup instead of 1/2). Am I the only one that had pools of melted butter on the top? 
-------------
Edited to say that I had to cook these longer for the butter to be "cooked in" (I also soaked some up with paper towels to be honest.. 1/4 cup next time). But I had to cook these much longer than it says... probably 20 minutes longer.

A good recipe-with a couple of modifications. I put dollops of cherry pie filling over the cream cheese mixture so I reduced the filling ingredients by 1/2. I also reduced the amount of margarine to 1/4 cup--that was still plenty. I also did not use the whole amount of cinnamon sugar on top-only about 1/2 of it. I prefered this cold--filling was too runny when warm and flavours have more  time to develop.

I'm always looking for something quick, easy and good and these were all 3. I thought the consistancy of the cream cheese mixture was odd, so I did as others and added an egg.  Made it more cheesecake like consistancy. The entire pan was almost gone. Can throw these together in 10 minutes!

The end result was not what I expected at all.  I had an image of flaky thin layers of dough with gooey cheesy filling.  The crescents were so dense and seemed to overpower the filling.  My husband bought the rolls--are there more than one size can?  Next time I will try the frozen puff pastry to get the thin flaky layers I am looking for.

yikes!  not going to make this one again. there was waay too much cream cheese filling and it was a disaster. The crust (although beautiful and golden on the top) was complete mush on the bottom.  So was the filling... even after cooling it was like a big thick layer of mush. I followed the recipe exactly so I have no idea what happened.  I should have listened to the person who cut the filling in half. Perhaps that was it? I didn't even bother to try and eat it..it went straight into the garbage.

These were a quick and easy dessert.  I used the reduced fat crescent rolls and it didn't impair the taste at all.  I do recommend using less of the filling then suggested.  I love cream cheese, but even I thought there was slightly too much.

Oh. My. God.  Considering how wonderful these are, I'm trying to figure out why it's taken me so long to make them!  Thank goodness I sorted through my overflowing recipe box and found this treasure.  I wanted something easy and this fit the bill.  As per other reviewers, I chose to decrease the butter to 1/4 cup and to brush it on instead of pour it on.  They were perfect at 28 minutes.  Thanks a bunch for sharing this recipe!

WAY too much butter, but turned out great the second time when I lightly brushed melted butter over the top before baking. Can easily be halved and baked in an 8"x8" pan.

YUM!  I've made these twice in two days!  I only used a 1/4 c. butter and still great.  Yesterday I used fresh blueberries, today fresh blueberries AND strawberries. Tomorrow, some apple pie topping.  Did I say Yum?

Well, after all the spectacular reviews, I was left feeling disapointed with the end result.  The squares were good, just not anything exceptional in my opinion.  If I'm going to eat something with that many calories, it needs to be worth it! To reduce the look of the crescent dough "lines," lightly pinch the dough together at the seams, then smooth over with your fingers dipped in warm water.

This is FABULOUS!  I made it for a work breakfast potluck and it was a hit!  I cooked it about 35 min instead of the 30 and it helped the top fluff up more.  Also I used the new "receipe creations" rolled cresent dough which is a flat sheet instead of one with seams.  Works beautifully!

WAAAAAY TOOOOO GOOOOOOD! And waaay tooo easy! I pride myself on baking from "scratch" but these little sweet treats can really compete--gold medal status! A day later you can heat 'em up or eat them cold- they are like a different desert depending on how you serve them. Renaming them Belly Buster Bars!

One word: delicious! This was such a simple dessert to make too. I whipped it up before I went to Bible study tonight & just stuck it in the fridge for an hour or so(which I highly recommend, b/c while it tastes wonderful warm or cold, it is MUCH easier to cut when chilled & set!) Everyone was really impressed & ate all of them! I definitely don't think you need all of the butter called for...I did as another reviewer suggested & just brushed some over the top. I also didn't use all of the cinnamon/sugar mixture, just sprinkled enough to lightly coat the top. I will definitely be making this treat again & again!

Wow!  I'm so glad I tried this recipe!  I never would have if it weren't for all the rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I did brush on a small bit.. really just a medium-sized pat .... of melted butter on the top instead of "pour" on melted margarine) and it was SO good!  We ate a third of the pan a few minutes out of the oven, and it was great, and then had some the next morning after it had sit in the refrigerator and it was even better!  The finished product reminds me of a cheese danish.  It definitely was NOT too sweet (oh yeah, I didn't use all of the 1/4 sugar/cinnamon mixture, but I did use most of it).  TRY THIS!  YOU WON'T BE SORRY!

Love this recipe! Modified it a bit by decreasing the cream cheese to a 1/3 less fat, added one egg, and decreased the melted butter to 1/4 cup.  Seems a bit less guilty by doing this!  I've made it 3 times in the past 24 hours, my family loves it.  I just took one pan out of the oven...I added "Simply Fruit" raspberry perserves to the filling....can't wait to try!  I've already been thinking of other ways to make this!

I have made these about 6 times in the past 2 weeks and they get better each time I make them. I even brought them to a Christmas party at my husband's firehouse and everyone loved them. People LOVE this recipe and they are so easy to make.

These are so good and easy! I made this recipe with Splenda and you couldn't tell it was sugar-free. I used more vanilla,added 1 egg yolk to cream cheese mixture and brushed the top layer with melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar...this recipe is definately a keeper!

I make this recipe a lot when I don't have a lot of time to bake.  Everytime I get compliments and requests for the recipe!  I have been adding a little more vanilla, because I like it that way.  Anywhere from 2 tsps to 1 Tbsp.  They are even yummy the next day cold!

This is a fantastic recipe.  Everyone liked it.  I used the called for amount of butter and it took a little bit longer for the top to crisp up, probably will use less next time but aside from that I think this is great.

Absolutely delicious!  A big hit at the office.  I made two versions - one with apricot spread and one with chocolate.  Both were tasty.  I doubled the recipe, and took everyone's advice about reducing the cream cheese.  I used 3 bricks, but it still made way too much.  Next time, I think 2 will be enough for even a double batch.  I found crescent rolls that have no perforations so those worked perfectly.  To serve, I cut in squares and put each square on individual muffin liners.  It worked perfectly for an office treat.  They are definitely better warm.  I told everyone at the office to heat them in the microwave for 10 seconds.  Great!!!  :)

Super Easy!!!!  These were sooo good.  I took the advice of others and cut down the butter, I only used 2 tablespoons of butter which I brushed on.  I also added about 1 tsp of lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture.  Mine were done in about 25 mins.  They taste way better cooled!

Oh. My. Gosh.  That is all I know to say.  This is, quite possibly, the most heavenly dessert I have ever put in my mouth.  These are INSANELY good.  The only thing I changed about the recipe was reducing the butter.  I used 4T of melted butter...not a 1/2 Cup.  I mean...at that point, it felt like they would be swimming in grease if I put so much butter on.  The 4T brushed over the top was perfect.  In addition, we always use the reduced fat Crescent rolls, so that was what I had.  I can honestly tell you that the recipe loses NOTHING with reduced fat rolls.  In fact, I think in this case, they're probably better because less butter in the pastry means a firmer crust to hold in all that glorious filling.  I used a 9x13 pan as called for in the recipe, and it all baked up beautifully.  I was able to cut them into clean squares after only 10 minutes or so of cooling.  They were still molten hot from the oven at that point, but they had already set up enough to serve.  I cannot comment on how well they keep because my family of three and one adult visitor DEVOURED the entire pan in--literally--1/2 hour.  My husband stood in the kitchen scraping every last spare trace of the filling from the pan with his finger once they were all gone. For the last two days, I've been receiving PLEAS from my husband and child to buy more cream cheese and make some more.  Simply put...you just HAVE to try these.

These were amazing and so simple to make! I took them to work and they went so fast... and now I am being asked to bring more in. The best part is it only takes me a few seconds to whip up and get into the oven! LOVE this one!

I used low fat cream cheese and splenda.  I thought there was lot of filling and there was way too much butter/margarine.  Also, my cooking time took over 15 minutes more than stated.  Not sure if they were wonderful, but they were good.  Thanks for the recipe.

These came out very gooey but after refrigerating they were perfect, and easier to cut. They taste amazing and the recipe was requested several times. Next time I may try cutting down the cream cheese and I can't wait to try with some preserves or even a pie filling. I did not use all the butter called for. *edit* I added some mini Rollos and while I think they melted a little too much it was a very nice addition to the cream cheese taste.

These were ok, but not at all what I was expecting. They came out like a cheese danish. They would be perfect for a brunch but I won't make them again for dessert.

Just finished making these this morning. Halved the recipe and made two 8x8 pans using puff pastry instead. One pan has a cream cheese with vanilla mixture and I spread a thin layer of seedless raspberry jam on top of the cream cheese before putting the puff pastry layer on. It tastes fab. I also have one I made by adding cocoa to the cream cheese mixture and then sprinkled chocolate chips on top before putting the top layer on. Its in the oven now but I am sure its gonna be superb too.  Hopefully everyone at the staff bbq this afternoon loves them. :D

I make this recipe with reduced fat crescent rolls and splenda.  Also eliminate the melted butter and you have a low fat & sugar recipe.  And its still great tasting.

This was really good! I used the lowfat crescent rolls(trying to cut down...) and lowfat cream cheese. Also, as some others said, used 1 1/2 blocks of cheese instead of 2 and used 1/4 cup of butter. Everyone loved it!

Wonderful, a very forgiving recipe, it's true. I too made many changes. Used Frozen Puff Pastry, low fat soft creme cheese, added 1 egg, squirt of lemon juice, 1/2 cup sugar. Also only 1/4 cup margarine and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Those were my personal preferences and just how forgiving this recipe is?  I forgot to put on my timer (sigh... again) and overcooked it by almost 20 min. - it came out perfect! I think it actually helped. I was afraid that even the 1/4 cup margarine would be too much. I was wishing I had also followed other suggestions and just brush some butter on top. Not really sure how I will do it next time. This is super delish!

These are so good.  I made them a day in advance and cut them into very small squares for a party.  Next time, I will not use as much butter and will leave them in a few minutes longer.  I will make these again!!!

Loved it!  Per a suggestion, I added 1-2 tsp. of lemon zest (didn't measure it).  I took it to a party and ended up having to email the recipe out to several people after it was all said and done.  Everyone loved it!

this was OK but there's too much sugar in the filling and it doesn't need all the butter poured on top. I served it with sliced strawberries which was good,  cut some of the richness of it.  don't know if I'll make again.

Delicious! My family loves anything with cream cheese. I only used 1/4 cup of butter but left anything else the same. Quick easy treat!

I'm not much of a pastry chef so I get very excited when I find a tasty recipe that I can execute properly. This has become my absolute go to recipe. I've made it several times just as written with great success. I've also made it using one package of cream cheese and a can of pie filling layered on top of it. A better chef could probably make this really fancy but for cooks like me this recipe is perfect as it is.

I made this recipe exactly as written, with the exception of cutting everything in half because I have a small family. It was absolutely delicious will certainly do this at least once a month.

LOVE recipe as it is but if you want to give it a HOLIDAY Cheer.....add 1-15 oz can pure pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix) to blended cream cheese mixture  and add pumpkin pie spice to sugar/cinnamon mixture for the top.

If it doesn't brown on top to your liking put under broiler for a minute until color desired is achieved. Due to diabetes I use Splenda in place of sugar always and have never had anyone notice the difference.

Plan on trying other flavors like lemon, key lime, etc when Holiday's are over! Thought possibly I could add jello to cream cheese mixture to change flavor, then obviously omit pumpkin pie spice for something appropriate.

PS..They last a long time in frig if no company over! Can also do 8 X 8 size pan and make 1/2 recipe using only 1 can crescent rolls if preferred.

Love this recipe! I made this recipe on a whim and halved it because of what I had on hand. I made it in an 8x8 pan and it turned out delicious. I, admittedly, did add some sugar-free apricot preserves and it was DELICIOUS.

My family thought this recipe was great!!  I had an over-abundance of cream cheese at one point and searched for a way to use it up before it went bad.  This recipe was just the thing!  I added about half the marg. to the top as a whole stick just seemed to be a bit much.  I did not have vanilla on hand, so I added a bit a cinnamon to the mixture, as well as on top.  Turned out great!  I have also added chocolate chips to the filling and plan on trying other add-ins as well!  

This recipe is great on it's own, but is also a great platform for each person to make it their own since it takes to additions very well!!

I made this a tiny bit differently based on what I had in the house tonight. I used one block cream cheese and only half a cup of sugar, added a dash of lemon juice and added a layer of diced up a can of apple pie filling on top of the cream cheese layer and sprinkled on some cinnamon sugar, then followed the recipe for top layer then butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on the very top. It was not too sweet and my husband loved it. We will try it tomorrow and see if it improved overnight. Can be a very adaptable recipe

MMMMMMMMM......MMMMMMMMMMM.........GOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!, i try to check all the bad reviews before i make something, this recipe had some negative reviews, too sweet, not sweet enough,too mushy on bottom, too dry, etc.... not true, use common sense- very lightly coat bottom of pan (with crisco, butter, etc)i didn't have a 9x13 (i used a 8x8 & cake pan) i had biscuits instead of crossants so i took the biscuits & sliced in half, & then shaped biscuits in pan & cake pan, lightly coated with melted butter , added cream cheese mixture stayed tru to recipe but just added a little of cocunut, almonds, nutmeg, whatever you like, to taste  (cream cheese mixture came out ABSOLUTLEY DELISH.!) added second half of sliced biscuits-shaped but didn't press, drizzled the rest of the butter on top, then placed 1/4 cup brown sugar, ab 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and again a little nutmeg, baked at 350, for 15min (moved pans baked another 15min) fantastic, the biscuits came out fluffy, sweet & delicious, (not too sweet & not salty at all) 
just perfect!!!!!!!!!!!next time might add some apples to it.YUMMMY GOOD!

Oh my goodness, these are FANTASTIC!  I'm only giving the recipe four stars, because I did make a couple small changes and I don't think we would have liked this quite as much without the changes.  I added one egg to the filling to make it sturdier since I was serving these at room temperature and I reduced the amount of melted butter on top to only 1/4 cup.  The 1/2 cup the recipe calls for would have been far too much.  I had initially reduced the amount of sugar in the filling to 3/4 cup, based on other reviews, and then tasted it before adding the egg.  I didn't feel like it was quite sweet enough, so I went ahead and added the other 1/4 cup of sugar.  My dough was a little thicker than the original recipe, because I only had the 12-ounce cans of jumbo-sized crescent rolls on hand, but we all agreed that this was the perfect amount of dough, so I'll use that amount from now on.

Good recipe, you can really make this your own by adding additional toppings to the filling. I made the recipe as written to give a fair review, but I can't wait to jazz it up! My kids ages 4 and 2 loved it! I'm going to add fruit and nuts next time.

So easy and delicious! I cut the butter down to 1/4c and just sprinkled my sugar/cinnamon shaker for the topping. It was still wonderful.

I agree with someone who else suggested baking for 30 minutes. I added a thin layer of preserves over the cream cheese layer - nice flavor. The cream cheese layer was too thick and sweet. Next time I will only add 12 oz of cream cheese and 3/4 c sugar.

My husband gave this 4 stars, but I think it's 5 stars! I modified the recipe a little. I reduced the margarine to half the amount. Also, I added homemade strawberry jam (that I made) to the top of the cream cheese mixture. The whole pan went within a couple of hours.

This is very yummy but could be made just as well without all the butter!  I have made it before but a little different.  My other recipe calls for 3/4 cup of sugar rather than 1 cup and an egg yolk in the cream cheese mixture.  Instead of using all that butter, you use the egg yolk as a brush on.  Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over the egg yolk.  This can also be made using low fat crescent rolls and low fat cream cheese.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe, but I think I'll stick to the butterless one.

These have become a family favorite. I think I've made them 6 times in the last month! The recipe is very easily halved (discovered by accident when I only had one can of crescents in the fridge!) and it makes just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.  My husband likes for me to put just a little extra sugar in the filling (monster sweet tooth, he has). I tried mixing some strawberries in the filling one time and it was okay, but we like the original recipe best.  Am making this again this morning for our family Easter celebration today.  Wonderful recipe!

This was such an easy and delicious recipe!  I added maple extract to the cream cheese mixture (no reason other than I love maple), and for half of the pan I sprinkled on blueberries.  I prefer to use frozen ones that have been thawed, as opposed to actually fresh ones, since they seem to be sweet and that little bit of juice adds a lot of flavor.  I prefered the blueberry squares to the other, but they were both wonderful.  p.s. I've also tried the recipe as written and think it's great and worthy of 5 stars even without my changes.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I liked it, I just thought there was too much cream cheese & the butter poured on top all pooled in the center while baking so the middle was really soggy. The parts that were cooked tasted very good.

These are AMAZING!!! My husband absolutely loved them and said I found "gold" with these bars. He said it's been the best dessert I've ever made. These are so delicious and so easy to make. I followed the directions as is and they came out perfect. On their own they taste great but I took some others' advice and tried strawberry jelly with them, which was good. But then I tried it with caramel sauce, WOW! It tastes like it was from a restaurant. I think they taste the best when cold, which helps solidify it, so I kept it in the fridge after it cooled from baking. You gotta make these but be careful, they are SO addicting!!!

Even though my husband loved it, the cream cheese was just too much for me. I usually like cream cheese but the amount was a lot. I think it may have tasted better too if puff pastry was used rather than the crescent rolls. The dough felt too thick.

One word - YUMMY!  I put golden raisins on top of the cream cheese - excellent.  The refrigerated crescent roll dough makes the recipe quick and easy.

I call it Elephant Ear Cheesecake. I add 1 tsp almond extract along with the vanilla and sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on top without any margarine or butter. I'm not really a super healthy eater but I feel better by not using all that butter and the cinnamon and sugar bakes onto the crescent nicely without it. It never lasts very long and I always have requests for the recipe.

I just made it this morning.  I have followed some advices other reviewers had suggested--cut down sugar to 3/4 cup, add fruit preserves (I used raspberry) before pouring cream cheese layer, cut down butter to 1/4 cup.  It didn't really "wow" me, but was pretty good.  The taste of crescent dough kind of throw me off--I will try pastry dough the next time.

This is the best recipe ever.  I found this on another site and the recipe was slightly different and had a different name.  It called for almond extract instead of vanilla and had sliced almonds on the top.  Everyone loves this at our house and I'm always asked to bring it to get togethers.  You won't be sorry if you try it and it's so easy to make as well as being delicious.

Love these.  I sometimes use 1/2 brown sugar.   Ends up with a sort of caramel flavor.  I brush the butter over the top (don't use the whole 1/2 c) and I tend to use more cinnamon.  I also sprinkle a little cinnamon over the bottom crust b/4 I pour the cream cheese mixture over.

Rich and gooey and good, but I felt like something was missing. I made it without any modifications. If I make it again, I think I'll try raspberry pie filling.

I gave it only four stars because I altered the recipe slightly. With the changes, I would give it five stars. I only used 1/2 + cup of sugar in the cream cheese mixture. I also added an egg. I used melted butter, instead of margarine brushed on top, but only 1/4 cup. It is not necessary to use 1/4 cup of sugar to sprinkle on top. It was very easy but so delicious.

Made these the other night as a last minuet quick dessert and my husband loved them. I halfed the recipe and made them in a pie tin. I thought the bottom layer of crescent roll was a bit doughy and might back it a bit before adding the cream cheese mixture and top layer, but aside from that, they were yummy, quick, easy and stuff I had on hand.

Delicious and super duper easy too.  I halved the ingredients and used a smaller pan  (11 X 7") and it was perfect. I will make this again and again and tell my DD and friends how easy it is.

I made these for New Year's Eve but ended up throwing them out because I just wasn't happy with how they turned out.  The flavor is decent enough but they came out pretty soggy.  I think that if I try these again I'd cut back on the amount of cream cheese.  The texture is just not right for me.

Wow... so easy and so yummy!! I changed it just a little as others had said - I used 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 tsp of vanilla, added 1 egg and brushed the top with butter instead of pouring it on. Then instead of using the sugar and cinnamon, I used confectioners sugar on top. Rave reviews from the entire family!! I plan on making this for Thanksgiving as one of my desserts - definitely a family favorite from here on out!

This was great! I was not fond of the cinnamon and butter flavor with the cream cheese though. Next time I think I will try a glaze instead.

wasnt crazy about this one, or maybe i had high expectations from reading good reviews. maybe its personal taste but if im gonna eat dessert i want it to be rly good and worth the calories, so i will not be wasting my calories on this. if i do attempt again ill try puff pastry sheets the cresents bake into like...cookie textured things with cream cheese in the middle...and even with half cup sugar it was too sweet.

Made exactly as recipe states except put a layer of fresh sweet blueberries on top of the cream cheese layer.  Topped the berries with the remaining dough and followed the rest of the directions.  SOoooooo good!  My family loves this.  I'm making one with fresh raspberries even as we speak...

I don't normally rate recipes, but this one was fantastic and super easy.  I ended up giving this to a bunch of people at a BBQ - it was that easy to remember after only making it the one time.  Used butter instead of margarine and used just enough of the melted butter to cover the top but not drown it in butter.

These were absolutley AMAZING!!!!!! I've been looking for a recipe like this for so long and finally I have found it! The only change I made was used butter instead of margarine (didn't have any) and I actually think it made it richer.

I made the recipe as stated but halved it.  It's pretty good, but it can be easily changed to suit your taste.  I lined the pan with foil and sprayed with cooking spray so that they would be easy to remove after chilling in the fridge for a bit. Chilling definitely makes cutting easier.  I'll make this again but try doubling the cream cheese mixture, adding a layer of fruit preserves, and possibly adding chopped nuts on top.  The taste is somewhat similar to a basic cream cheese King Cake in New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  You could even try using colored sugar on top (purple, yellow, and green).

These are sooo good!  I have made them several times for guests and each time I've gotten rave reviews.  I do cut down the butter to less than a 1/4 cp.  hence the 4 star rating instead of a 5.  The original recipe call for to much butter.  But other than that this is a perfect quick dessert.  I like it warm and cold.

These were very good and very rich. I took the suggestions of others and reduced the sugar/cream cheese mixture a bit. I had puff pastry that I needed to use, so subbed it for the crescents. Very nice breakfast dish. Cuts and tastes best when cooled. Delicious served with fresh fruit on the side.

Love these squares.  I've made them several times now.  The recipe as written is great, and it is so easy to use as a base.  I've also tried variations such as adding a strawberry jam layer.  Yesterday I tried mixing blueberry spreadable fruit into the cream cheese mixture. I think that has been our favorite variation.

The filling is to die for in this recipe!  So simple but tastes like it was created in an upscale bakery.  I improvised a bit with this recipe.  I didn't use crescent dough, instead I used phyllo dough.  I placed two layers of the 9"x14" pyllow dough down and burshed with 1/4 cup melted butter and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I repeated this step 5 times.  When the layers were complete I used a pizza cutter and created 3"x3" squares, I then placed 2 tsp of the cream cheese mixture into each  and folded up into "purses".  Baked purses for 20-25 min in a 350 degree heated oven (or until golden brown).  After taking out the oven I drizzled 3 Tbsp of butter mixed with 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to give it a little something special.  I let the purses cool on the rack for 10 min before removing.  This recipe is best served warm but honestly, you can still have them cold.

Very very good. I used the full amount of sugar in the cheese and thought it was perfect. I also made with the two bricks as specified and I think it's a good thick layer of filling: preferences do differ but I'd rather have a generous layer than a skimpy one. The only change I made was just 1/4 c margarine on top, which was fine. I think a full half cup would make it richer than I prefer, though it wouldn't throw the recipe. I nibbled on it while warm and it was ooey-gooey good: chilled in the fridge overnight and was able to cut it cleanly into bars. It was good cold too but I like it best at room temperature. Simple, delicious, satisfying: thanks very much for sharing.

I make these any time I have crescent dough.  I have a lot of flavored cheesecake mixes so I swap the sugar out for those.  So sometimes it will be raspberry, or english toffee, lemon, etc.  You can also experiment with the extract, I love it with almond!

SO Good!!  I had about 4 ounces short of 2 packages worth of cream cheese, but it still turned out well.  Made them in mini muffin tins like anotehr reviewer suggested and they came out as adorable "cheesecake rounds."  The 1/2 cup of margarine is unnecessary in my opinion, I just brushed a little bit of melted margarine on the tops of each round and saved some fat and calories (I maybe used 1.5-2 tablespoons of margarine)

This is dangerously easy and too good not to make often.  I only used I package of low fat cream cheese, cut down on the sugar and brushed on melted butter (¼ cup), still delicious with the changes.  I used a no frills brand of crescent rolls and had to pitch ends together to make sure the dough stayed in one piece.

These were dangerously yummy and easy to make, but I give the recipe 4 instead of 5 stars because it has way too much sugar and margarine in it.  It can still be really yummy with much less.

Wow! These were so easy and yet taste sooo good!! Like a cream cheese danish! I added a bit of lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture, and used 1/4 cup melted butter over the top. They just came out of the oven, but they taste divine! Cant wait for these to set up and cut them for my coworkers!!

This is a great easy to make recipe. I did only brush the top with butter instead of pouring on so much. And instead of cinnamon, I put about 1/4 cup chopped milk chocolate and a light drizzle of of Caramel syrup. It turned out great!

Awesome recipe! So easy to make. I used less better and mixed it with sugar and cinnamon then pored over top. Thanks for the great recipe.

These are great so worth 5 stars!! I made them last night and hubby ate them for breakfast. He asked for them again for his early morning fishing trip :) I hope the other guys will like them as much as he did.

This is delicious!  I'm sure it would be wonderful as is but I did make some changes that put it over the top.  I added a splash of almond extract to the filling and the zest of both a lemon and an orange.  Instead of topping it with cinnamon and sugar I sliced strawberries and put those on top.  Then I took the lemon and orange and juiced them into a sauce pan and added a tablespoon of cornstarch and stirred it over medium heat until it thickened.  Then I brushed the glaze over the strawberries.  This gave the dish a wonderful summer feel with a bright citrus kick.  I did try it a second time with fat free cream cheese and splenda and still got rave reviews but I could personally tell a difference from the full fat and sugar version.

These were excellent. I had all of the ingredients, but I wasn't sure how much I would like it so I made a 1/2 recipe in an 8 inch square pan. I put a very little bit of apricot jam on half and left the other half plain. I really couldn't taste the apricot, but everyone liked these- even my son who swears he hates cream cheese!

OMG!! This is the BOMB! I made this last night to take to the office function at work, and 'everybody' wanted the recipe.   This recipe deserves a lot more than 5 stars like it is, hands down! I could have eaten the whole bowl of cream cheese filling, but restrained myself. I do have to admit that I added one more ingredient to personalize it for my taste and topped the cream cheese mixture with Strawberry Preserves, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I LOVED hearing all the ooooos, ahhhhh's and reviews of my peers of, "Awesome",  "Wonderful", "Phenomenal" and "you've GOT TO make this again. THANK YOU Ann so much for this Awesome recipe. It will be served Over and Over again, every chance I get.

My husband raved about this! I omitted the cinnamon, topped the cream cheese mixture with maraschino cherries, and drizzled chocolate syrup on top before serving. This one is a keeper.

This was pretty good.  I used reduced fat crescent rolls and I used some splenda in place of regular sugar (about 3/4 sugar to 1/4 splenda)  This is an easy dessert to make when you don't have much time to make something...

These are wonderful, and easy to make. However, I use less sugar in the filling, and only use around 1-2 tbsp of butter for the top. They are yummy if you add a strawberry or other fruity jam on top of the cream cheese mixture. My first review on these said they were good warm or cold, but the more I serve them, the more people like them chilled. Either way, you can't lose with this one. :)

Amazing recipe.   Simple, fast,requires few ingredients and absolutely delicious!Using the suggestions of others I did add about a tsp of freshly minced lemon zest to the creamed cheese.  Otherwise I made it exactly as written. Recipe can easily be halved and fits well in a 9inch square pyrex baking dish.

This recipe is AWESOME!  Not only did it turn out great, but it was so good it inspired a marriage proposal from a co-worker!  I didn't change a thing - it's perfect the way it is.  The full stick of butter seems like much and looks like a lot when you pour it on, but I've tried reducing it as well and it's better left as written.  If you want to change it up a little, add some apple pie filling on top of the cheesecake mixture before putting the final layer of crescent rolls.  It's also fabulous (and the version that earned the proposal)

My husband loved these and could not stop eating them, but I found them a little soggy, and my kids kinda picked around them.  Maybe, dare I say, too much cream cheese?  1 pkg would probably be better.  I tried 1/2 of the dish with rasberry preserves spread over the cream cheese layer and 1/2 with brown sugar & cinnamon mixed w/the cream cheese.  I think I liked the brown sugar side best.  I don't think I would serve these to a crowd but I might try them again at home.  (p.s.  look for the Recipe Creations crescent sheet by Pilsbury!  No piecing the triangles together! yay!)

This recipe is awesome!  I couldnt believe when one of the other reviews said that everyone asked her to make it whenever there was a get together. But I found out that she was right. I bake other things, but most people just want me to make this.  It is really easy, but really good. Try it and you'll see. Bon appetit!

OMG!!! These were amazing! Pretty much followed the recipe exactly. Just added a little almond extract as well as the vanilla. Also baked it for 40 min. Everyone loved them. Will definately be making these again. And they are so simple. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe. Whole family loved it. Very easy and inexpensive. Used Pillsbury and didn't have a problem with seams. Melted butter,added remaining sugar and cinn and poured that over 2nd layer of crescent. Delicious!!!

These are soooo yummy and very easy to put together!  Yes you can still see the perforation in the dough but it didn't detract from the flavor at all!  I spread a can of strawberry pie filling (very thin) on top of the cream cheese, and so then I omitted the cinnamon - hot dog they were tasty!

I took these to a party last night and they got rave reviews. I'm rating this as a 5 star recipe as a result of those  reviews... 6 different women asked me for the recipe and said they loved it. However, I thought it was WAY TOO RICH for my liking, but I don't really have a sweet tooth anyway. It was super easy to put together and the pan was empty by the end of the gathering. If you like sweet, rich desserts, then give this one a try!

This is so easy and so good. I used all the cream cheese mixture cause we love cream cheese. I didn't pour on the butter tho, I just used a small amount and brushed it on then put the cinnamon sugar on top and it came out perfect. It's so good it doesn't last long.

I just put it in the oven, but I'm sure it's delicious since a friend of mine brings it to all the parties.  She calls hers "sopapilla cheesecake" though, although she admits it's nothing like a sopapilla.  Anyway, I just wanted to say that I used reduced-fat store brand crescent rolls, and they were hard to work with.  The seams don't stay together at ALL.  I don't know if it was because of the reduced fat or the not-name-brand, but I would just recommend using Pillbury or something, just to make sure it's easier to make.

There should be more stars for this recipe. Five stars simply isn't enough. I took these to a reception and I had to print up 30 copies of the recipe to give out to people. They stormed the platter. This ones a keeper.

I love anything with cream cheese and cinnamon, and I wasn't disappointed with this recipe.  Very good.  Next time I think I will try with just half the cream cheese,though.

These got high ratings from the entire family.  I only made half the recipe, but followed it exactly and they were terrific.

I thought these were pretty good; everybody else gave them rave reviews. Still good or incredible they are UNBELIEVABLY easy!!!!!! Next time I’ll cut back on the butter just a bit (maybe a TBSP at a time) as I found them to be a bit greasy. This may have been my oven, but I also required more cooking time closer to 40mins as the center was still doughy after 30mins. Also I thought they tasted better refrigerated than hot. Over all extremely simple yet yummy recipe 4 ½ stars!

Oh My! Oh My! Oh My! How can something so easy taste so good? I did add an egg and a little lemon zest, but I believe this would have tasted just as good without the additions. Can't wait to make again.

I was amazed at how good these were.  We had to try them before they were completely cool, and then we had some more later.  We preferred them at room temperature--but don't get me wrong, they were good warm too, although a good bit runnier.  I would make these again.

I used the Golden Crescent Roll recipe instead of the pillsbury stuff and like it a lot.  The filling is WAY too much, half of the filling is probably suffice.  I like this better cold rather than hot.  It's also good if you use the filling and make little individual cheese danishes, just glaze it with a powdered sugar glaze after it comes out of the oven.  Thanks for the recipe

Yummy and so easy!  I cut the recipe in half and that worked fine.  Didn't change anything else.  I'll be making these again - sooner than later!

These cream cheese squares are delicious! They are great served as a coffecake. I brushed butter on the top but omitted the cinammon and sugar.  After baking & cooling - I sprinked instead with powdered sugar for a pretty presentation.

The taste was really good, but I honestly think you could go with one or one and a half packages of cream cheese and be fine.  2 packages is just way too much and I love cream cheese, but it starts to overpower the light flakey crescent roll part.

The filling was great. I will try these one more time, but I will change the amount of butter( I havn't used margarine in years)to about 1/2 and will use unsalted butter. In my opnion, the butter was just too heavy, and I like rich foods. The salt in the cresent dough, and the salt in the butter ganged up, and produced a cloying quality. I like the concept of the cresent dough and the filling, this just needs a little lightening up.

I halved the recipe since there's only 2 of us, and added 1/2 tsp lemon peel (didnt have zest) to the cream cheese mixture, then spread raspberry jam on the bottom then the cheese mixture! It was good, just not what I was expecting. It was very sweet and very rich! I was kind of expecting it to be a little more solid, but instead it was more like a creamy consistency. My boyfriend said they were like an entemens (sp?) dessert!? These were fast and easy so will prob make if in a bind but I think I was looking more for like a croissant type thing.

OH MY GOD!!! these were so easy and so good! yummmmyyyy! I did not need to put mine in the fridge to be able to cut it, all I did was give them 15 minutes to cool in the pan and they came out fine. I loved them and they are so easy to put together, I will be taking them to family gatherings!

These were awesome.  I made them for a work dessert party and everyone loved them.  Of all the desserts people brought, these were the only ones completely gone by the end of the party!  I used only 3/4 cup sugar in the cream cheese mixture, plus one egg yolk.  I spread a layer of cherry preserves on the cream cheese.  On top, I brushed with egg white and sprinkled sugar.  I will definately be making these again!  And I love that it was so easy.

These are just what I wanted. When I ate one warm, it tasted like a cream cheese danish, but cold, it tasted more like a cheese cake. This is a very simple and cheap recipe that I'd recommend to anyone. Thanks!

just amazing: people will never believe you put these together in a handful of seconds! I used real butter, but I wonder if it's really necessary. Could be very good with something else thrown into the cheese, like fruit or choc chips.

Fabulous recipe!
 I did follow others suggestions...i added a bit of lemon juice and an egg. I also cut down on the sugar and only used 12oz of chream cheese. I used butter as well. I added blueberry pie filling to mine. Refridgerated overnight and voila! Wow! Will be making these many more times in the future with different fillings.

Fantastic!  I accidently left out one of the cream cheese and it came out fine.  I added an egg to the cream cheese mixture and it was wonderful.  I also substituted Splenda for the sugar and it was delicious.

These bars are delicious!  I made them for the guys at work last week and they disappeared in no time.  I only made one change,  I just brushed some margarine on the top after baking and them sprinkled it with the cinnamon and sugar.  I was afraid the c/s mixture on the top would carmelize or burn during baking.  They were very good.  I will make them again.  Thanks.

Yum, yum, and YUM!!!  A friend of mine served these at a breakfast, but I made them for dessert.  You just can't go wrong!  It's easy and DELICIOUS.  I did cut the cream cheese mixture in half to cut back on some calories and I thought they were excellent.  I also used almond flavoring in lieu of the vanilla.  I plan on experimenting with other flovors too.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good.  I was craving cheesecake, but really didn't want to spend the time making one....this was the next best thing.  I did only add 1/2 cup of sugar, and brushed the top instead of drowning it in all that butter. I added just a little lemon juice too.  I sprinkled just a touch of cinnamon on top (reduced that too).  Next time I will omit that and just make a simple icing to drizzle on top....could be almost like a danish.  Thanks for the post.

A truly effortless recipe that is worth raving about.  I took other reviewer's suggestions and added an egg to the cream cheese mixture and just brushed the top with melted butter, kept everything else the same.  It is a very versatile recipe, the addition of a fruit topping will only make it better! I made this on a Saturday morning for the kids and wife and it was gone in an hour with "demands" to make it again.

Pretty good. 1/2C margerine would have drowned the entire pan, so I used only 1/4C butter and next time, probably will only do 1/8C. I used 1C dried blueberries to get SOME nutrition in there... :o)

I added a handful of frozen blueberries, and an egg to the filling.  They turned out great.  I did have to bake about 20 min. longer.

I needed something quick and had the ingredients on hand to try this recipe..I added a can of cherry pie filling to "spice" it up. I agree that the next time I will cut back on the butter and we really liked these once they had cooled. I would make these again

The cinnamon sugar added a nice touch.  I still could taste the canned flavor of the biscuits but the lovely cream cheese filling makes everything okay!

WOW!  So easy and SO GOOD.  EVERYONE at my book club today LOVED this.  I usually always tweak a recipe to my own personal tastes, but this one I made exactly as printed and it is perfect as is.  This is a keeper.

I modified the recipe a little to make it a little less fat...did'nt put any margarine and used half the sugar in the cream cheese filling.  Still wonderful and family and friends loved them.  Will make again for certian.

These were good, but I don't think they deserve all of the raves about them.

I halved the recipe.  Used an 8X8 pan (because it was the smallest I had) and they didn't reach the edge, but it didn't effect the cooking.  I also made it a bit healthier by using half sugar/half spenda in the cream cheese and melted SmartBalance instead of margarine.

I would make them again though, because they were so easy.

I knew it was too good to be true.  I expected something so much better than what I got because of the rave reviews.  They weren't awful, but they weren't at all special.  They tasted like what they are, cream cheese between store bought crescent rolls.  They do taste better cold than they do out of the oven.

My family really liked this recipe.  I made some changes:  I used a 6 x 6 pan, 1 tube of crescent roll, 1 cup of sugar, 1 8oz package of cream cheese, real lemon zest, I brushed butter on top (I saw comments on it being soggy), & sprinkled sugar & tupperware seasoning "cinnamon vanilla" on top.  I cooked the bottom crust 1st for about 5 minutes also.

This is fabulous!!!  We had a Thanksgiving Luncheon and one of the girls brought this, and she made me try it.  I like cream cheese but not cooked in anything so I tried it and was addicted to it. I had 2 squares and took 2 home.  VERY VERY GOOD!!!

Sorry, this one didn't do it for me sadly. First I think it was way too sweet and too much cream cheese filling.  I would maybe use half of cream cheese and half the sugar if I ever made this again, also less butter on top....Make sure to cook fully where you have a golden brown crust or it will be doughy.

The whole family loved this recipe! I made a few minor changes, added some greated lemon peel and a little bit of lemon juice to the cream cheese filling and only lightly brushed the top with butter and used half the sugar as others have suggested. It’s best chilled. 
Definitely will make it again as it was a big hit.

These are always a huge hit with our family and friends. The only thing I did different was add an egg yolk and cut the butter in half. The first time I made them with the half cup of butter, the top was much too soggy. They’re absolutely delicious! Thank you for sharing!

This is incredible ! If I could give 10 stars I would. I have two friends that spend all day making this style cheese coffee cake. Not me, I will be doing this for everything now. No more bakery. I made exactly as recipe says. I had leftover filling so I used another can of crescent rolls. I sliced it down the middle , used the two halves same procedure as  two cans, so I got 1 full size and one half size( I pigged out on the half for me!). I also only used half the cinnamon sugar. The whole amount would make a thick sugar, if you like that, I like mine more light. Also, learned a new trick. Use food processor for filling, use the ON setting, not pulse or chop, for 5 seconds with softened cream cheese. About 10 seconds for right out of fridge until it  was perfectly smooth. Well worth having to pull it out and wash it. Everyone must make this, it is incredible !

Too sweet and gooey. Next time, I'll bake the pastry first for a few minutes.  I will also add an egg or two to the cream cheese mixture to firm it up. And the butter/sugar/cinnamon topping can easily be reduced, cut the butter in half. Sprinkle just enough sugar to lightly dust the top and use as much cinnamon as you would like.

I halved this and used an 8x8 pan, lining it with non-stick aluminum foil which made it a breeze to just lift out and cut and remove the bars. I reduced the sugar a little. I saw that some reviewers mentioned adding preserves on top of the cheese mixture. I had some seedless raspberry preserves that I wanted to use up. I spread some on half of the cheese mixture. After baking, that part was soggy and very sweet, not great. I would add preserves again (apricot, blueberry or cherry would be nice), but I would just add a VERY thin layer to avoid the issues mentioned. Nice dessert!

This recipe is To. Die. For. It must be chilled before serving, though. Next time I am going to add a fruit with the cream cheese... such as blueberries or cherries. Glad I found this recipe!!

I've made this several times with the original crescent roll tubes. This last time I made it with the crescent roll sheets; much easier, but also thicker than the originals crescent roll triangles.  If you're going to use the sheets, I'd certainly recommend using the 2  8oz pkges of cream cheese the recipe calls for. Based on many reviews I only used one pkg and because the crescent roll sheets are thicker, that was a mistake. Still delicious.

I made these but added a half cup of fresh blueberries on top of cheese before topping with crescent and oleo.  I would never make them again.  Extremely sweet and mushy.

This is a very nice dessert.   I made 2 half pans,  one chocolate and the other lemon.   Now both my husband and I are happy.  My  loves cheesecake this is a great easy version.   I also included an egg.  Makes the cream light and creamy.  Thanks for this recipe.  Made it again for Easter. 1st batch I forgot the egg.  It did not rise.  Definitely better with the egg in it.

Awesome and easy.  Used a slightly smaller and higher pan, placing the extra dough on the edges.  Worked out well.  Everybody loved these.  Could also put some cherry pie filling in the middle if you wanted another twist.

I have been making this recipe for over 25 years.  It always disappears and everyone asks for the recipe.  It can be made up to a week before use and kept in the fridge.  I have frozen the leftovers with no loss of taste or texture.  Never having known the name of this recipe it is called The balloon a fair cream cheese and crescent roll stuff.  Now I know the proper name. 
Thanks.

My mom made these nearly every holiday growing up, and I have continued the tradition. I usually cut down the butter on top to half, as stated in the recipe is a bit much for me. I like to put raspberry or blueberry jam over the cream cheese layer. I made them tonight with half brown and half white sugar and pressed in some Italian Amoretti cookies(tiny almond cookies meant for soaking up liquors and coffee) and topped that with fig jam before the final crescent layer. It smells divine and I can't wait to dive into it! How ever you make yours, they are good warm but even better the next day, cold. I plan on making these next with puff pastry sheets like another reviewer, I think it will be a refined version worthy of even the snootiest baker. I have not found a bad combination or lost the taste for these cream cheese bars as the recipe states over the years. Give this recipe a try if you are a beginner for some confidence and also if you make your own fruit preserves and like to showcase them in desserts. Make for any reason, any day because these are so simple to make.

I am a chocoholic but these are my faVorite of all treats. I can't believe I am admitting that there is something on this earth that I like more than chocolate. Every time I make these I get several requests for the recipe. The only thing I change is more cinnamon. They are probably fine with the amount of cinnamon the recipe calls for but I love cinnamon so I add extra. Love these.

I followed the recipe exactly so I could judge it ccorrectly.  It was delicious!  Next time, I will cut the sugar down to 1\2 cup and add a little lemon juice.  Also, the melted butter can be reduced to a brushing over the top and just a sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar on top. All around great and easy recipe.  Thanks!

Fast and Easy.
Cut back of sugar in cream cheese, used on 3/4 cup. On top of cream cheese layer, spread 20 ounce can of extra fruit no sugar added pie cherry filling. Did not need any extra backing time.  Yum!

Yes, these are easy to make and always a hit. It is easy to make a half batch and use a 8 or 9 inch pan. I will be taking these to the Christmas morning coffee party and adding some red jelly to it to make it festive. Be ready for the OMG these are so good.

WOW! Made exactly as written, wanted to add lemon juice but was out so I used lime, still worked. I think it would be fine without the citrus just sends it over the top.  Poured all the butter on top, no problem I think it makes a certain consistency. Read another reviewer who made hers in a metal pan and it didn't cook properly, didn't have pyrex so I used metal.  Same thing happened, overcooked edges and undercooked center.  The edges weren't bad though, kind of a cookie bar texture, and the center was soft like a creamy cheesecake, still great imho.  Of course, how can you mess up cream cheese? Awesome recipe I'm going to be making a LOT at my house!

I just knew this was going to be good.  I don't know what crescent roll dough is and even if I did I wouldn't be able to find it.  I reduced the ingredients to a yield of 6 and I used a 6 1/2" square tin. The filling was just enough.  I did find it a bit too sweet, so will reduce the sugar a little next time.  A couple of days later the sweetness wasn't so apparent.  I put a few in the deep freeze to see what gives.  I also thought that next time I may try rum or cognac instead of the vanilla.  Anyway.....it was awful nice.  I have made it quite a few times now, using flakey pastry.  I don't take any notice of the measures for the cheese, sugar and vanilla - I just make it to my taste.

This was great!!!  We were a little unsure after mixing the batter, as it was thicker than we are used to seeing in a packaged mix, but the results were undeniable!  We adjusted it to 4 servings, which was perfect for 3 pancakes each for the 2 of us.  We will make this again, and again .. and we are looking forward to adding blueberries the next time!

Excellent.    I made an error  as I baked the bottom layer  for approx 7 minutes before the cream cheese was layered on.  I also pureed a few fresh strawberries and layered them on top of the cream cheese.  Will make again.  Looking forward to trying different fruit with this dessert.

First, mine didn't look like the picture, the cream cheese was runny. The recipe didn't say to let it cool completely but maybe it is supposed to be served cold.  Second, it was dead sweet! I couldn't even eat it.  Also, I couldn't bring myself to pour half a cup of butter on the top so I brushed 1/4 cup over the top and sprinkled with half the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I think I might try it again with half the sugar in the cream cheese and either cook it longer or serve it cold.

I loved this recipe with the following alterations...used 1 package of regular cream cheese and 1 package low fat cream cheese. Used 1/2 c. lemon sprinkles from Pampered Chef(sorry, no longer sold) and 1/2 c. sugar mixed with the cheese and vanilla. I followed the instructions for construction but used 1/2 c. melted butter and sprinkled on some decorative sugar before baking. I did skip the cinnamon as I felt it would not go with the lemon. I just now need to figure out how to make my own lemon sprinkles so that I can replicate my changes.

Absolutely delicious...I sprinkled fresh blueberries over the cream cheese mixture then baked and that made it even better!

I have used this recipe several times but I sometimes add a bit of  lemon juice to the cream cheese and drop the vanilla for a different taste. Also, try skipping the cinnamon sugar in favor of a light dusting of confectioner sugar or even a light glaze of confectioner sugar & cream.

I've been making this recipe for years, but in Texas we call it Sopapilla Cheesecake because the crispy cinnamon-sugar top layer is reminiscent of the sopapillas served in Mexican restaurants.  Also, I just spread soft margarine lightly on the top crescent layer before I sprinkle on the cinnamon-sugar mix. It's amazing served warm or cold!  I've even been know to eat a piece for breakfast!

just made this and it smells incredible baking! Do not use store brand crescent rolls, they do not separate as easily and more work repairing holes in dough. Well worth making!

This dessert was so good!  Very quick and easy to make during the week.  I made it as instructed and thought it was great but I will also modify it once in a while to switch it up a little.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight for my cream-cheese addict son and it's REALLY good!  I used 3/4 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet - I did bake the first layer of crescent rolls for about 8 minutes and I did add an egg to the cream cheese mixture (although I plan to try it without the egg next time).  I brushed butter on top and sprinkled with sugar (maybe 2 tablespoons?) - no cinnamon.  We didn't care for them warm but once refrigerated - just SO good!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this atleast 5 times in the last couple of months as it is so delicious and easy to make.  I am repeatedly asked for the recipe and have found no one who does not think this cheese danish is devine!  I have changed amount of butter that is brushed on before baking as 1/2 cup seems way too much, so I use a couple of tablespoons instead.  I can see making this many many more times in my lifetime!

This is good but using 16 oz. of cream cheese and a whole cup of sugar makes it a big gloppy diabetic-coma-inducing mess. The top is great but the bottom is soggy and more like crescent roll pudding. Will try again when my sugar coma wears off but will cut down on cream cheese and sugar.

I have made this recipe two times and both times I got RAVE reviews from everyone who ate it.  So GOOD. I put the plate of squares in the break room at work and within 5 minutes the plate was empty!  The first time I made them I followed the recipe as written and I felt there was just too much butter.  The second time I used about a tablespoon of butter (just enough to get the cinnamon and sugar to stick to the dough) and I felt that I could have used more.  Next time I will use half a stick of butter.  No matter how much the butter this recipe is great and something I will be making for years to come.

I think it's great it's easy too I added strawberry preserves and marbled it in after I spread the cream cheese and I didn't use the cinnamon on top just the sugar it's awesome and with the leftover crescent rolls and filling we made stuffed cheese cake rolls you can put preserves in them too:)

I was skeptical about these simple ingredients, particularly the store-bought crescent roll dough - I am admittedly a snob about such things - but this was terrific! The flaky pastry, rich, creamy filling, and crunchy sugary topping were a perfect combination. I was so skeptical, in fact that I halved the recipe; a decision I regretted with the first bite!

These things are diet busters for sure.  I had cream cheese and crescent rolls to use up after the holidays and this recipe fit the bill.  I added some homemade strawberry preserves on top of the cream cheese layer and it may have made the overall product too moist.  But they are mighty tasty.  My husband will be taking them to work with him tomorrow and I doubt he'll have any trouble giving them away!

This is the easiest receipe to make and gets raves like something way more complicated, I love to bake and have a diabetic husband with a huge sweet tooth. I sub a sweetner for the sugar and even added fresh peaches to have a wonderful treat for the diabetic's sweet tooth craving.

These were excellent!  I put a thin layer of raspberry jam on top of the bottom layer of dough.
Like others  suggested I used less sugar --3/4c.  I also only used 1/4 c. melted butter.  I am planning to make these for a wedding rehersal dinner they were so good!

I followed this recipe exactly and loved the results BUT today I decided to make a couple of changes.  This time I halved the cream cheese filling and then on top of this I spread a thin layer of seedless raspberry jam. Awesome!

Very good !  I made this the first time following directions except for brushing the melted butter over top instead of pouring all over as some reviewers suggested. Turned out wonderful and everyone enjoyed them.  Second time I made them;  I put orange marmalade over the cream cheese layer and used nutmeg instead of cinnamon for the sprinkle on top.  Equally delish!  Thank you for sharing this easy recipe.

Really great dessert and so easy.  I've added dried fruit to the cream cheese mixture, made a good difference.

So easy and delicious! I halved the recipe and baked it in a smaller dish. It turned out just great!! My 7 year-old son said that this is one of the best desserts he's ever had.

I know these would have been fantastic by itself  but I really like the taste of fruit with cream cheese so I made Blueberry Breakfast Sauce from this site to pour on top of the cream cheese. WAY too sweet. Next time I will cut the sugar down to 1/4 Cup in the cream cheese and down to about half in the blueberry sauce when I make these together. Also I will omit the butter alltogether as it made the top a little on the soggy side. Thanks for sharing!

These are really simple but I really enjoyed them! I mixed the cream cheese with some melted chocolate to spruce it up a bit, it was really fantastic.

I made a half recipe because there are only 2 of us. They didn't turn out as well as I was hoping but they are very tasty. I will be trying this recipe again. Maybe add some raspberries to it or something. Very good!!

Delicious!!!I made this last night and everyone just loved it! The only changes I made was adding an egg to the cream cheese mixture since it was kinda stiff and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup. It came out perfect! Can't wait to try alternative additives(like apple pie filling) as suggested by others

This was one of the tastiest and easiest deserts I ever made, next time I will cut a little on the sugar in the original mix and pour a little less margarine at the end over the croissants but otherwise it was fabulous all of my friends wanted the recipie.

My kids loved this! It was so easy. I was surprised that the crescents weren't doughy. As suggested, I decreased the sugar and butter. We used strawberry jam. It was just like a cheese danish. This is now a family favorite and we will make it often.

This was AWESOME! Made it for the first time following directions exactly and took it to work for Food Day. YUM! Everyone loved it! It was really easy to bake. Only suggestion I have is to let your cream cheese set out a bit first as I hand stired the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla and it would be hard to do if the cream cheese was straight from the fridge.

I always make them for a special event. They are always gone before I get a piece. Great recipe! The only thing I changed is used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup. It comes out great everytime I make them.

We LOVED LOVED this recipe.  I barely had a chance to let this cool before my husband beat the kids to half of it.  My mom said it was a mix between a cinnamon roll, a danish, and a cheesecake.  I will be making again tonight.

Perfect as is, but to dress it up for an event I left out the cinnamon, added lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture, and topped the cooled dessert with honey, fresh strawberries, and a balsamic reduction. Fabulous.

This recipe is amazing.  I had to improvise a bit because I did not have crescent roll dough.  Instead I only had Grands Honey Butter Flaky Biscuits, I used one can of that and cut the cream cheese recipe in half.  So I creamed 1 - 8ounces of cream cheese (1/3 less fat...trying to be healthy lol). 1/4cup of granulated splenda and 1/4cup of regular sugar and 1/2tsp of vanilla.  I took the 8 flaky biscuits out of the can and pulled them apart in half like a hamburger. I laid 8 halves in the bottom of a parchment lined 8x8 pan. Then I dolloped and lightly spread about 2tbsps of cream cheese mixture on each half (some cream cheese is left over that you can either distribute evenly among the biscuits or eat :)).  Then I dolloped about 1tsp of sugarfree strawberry preserves, spread lightly.  Then I replaced the remaining halves ontop of each biscuit like a sandwich, do not press because everything will spread a little while baking. I baked  it according to the recipe on the biscuit can.  I did not put the butter glaze or the cinnamon sugar because the biscuits are infused with honey butter already.  They were delicious! Perfect with coffee.

Very good.  Added an egg for fluffiness, cut sugar to 1/2, used less margarine (only brushed on top), and sprinkled brown sugar & cinnamon on top.  These are a keeper for a quick dessert.

These were a huge hit at church! I sliced the crescent rolls into circles. Made an indentation for the filling. Topped with a drizzle of lemon icing. Beautiful presentation!

Fantastic. I made as written, except I halved the butter for the top of the crescent rolls. This reminds me of Entemanns Cheese Danish.

Super Easy and tastes fantastic.  I made it exactly as directed except a little less butter on top (closer to 1/4 cup) and than turned out amazing.  I will definitely try them again and take some others suggestion of adding preserves.

WOW. So easy, and SOOOO SOOOOO SOOOO delicious. I used one package of cream cheese and put strawberry jam in mine and they were a BIG hit! They taste better right out of the oven or at room temp, in my opinion  (and my dads)

YUM!  But, I think this is more of a breakfast bar than a desert.  It tasted like a danish.  I will definitely make this again, but I'll be making it for breakfast or brunch, not as an after dinner desert.  I added a thin layer of blueberry jam on top of the cream cheese - loved it!  I also cut the butter in half and cut back on the sugar/cinnamon mixture on the top.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and cooked it for 5 minutes longer and that may have been too long because the bottom crust was slightly over-cooked, 30 minutes was probably long enough.  Great, easy recipe.

I gave this a 5 because it's a great combination and taste great.  I cut recipe in half and it was a bit to much filling, and also the butter made a little soggy.  I think I would cut back both of these next time.

I have never reviewed before but feel I must for this one.  This is just fabulous!!!  Not very healthy but very good.  I think next time I would try with less margarine.  Be sure to cook it long enough or it is runny in the middle

Made this recipe two nights ago. I followed the recipe pretty much to a T, except may have gotten a little heavy with the cinnamon/sugar mixture. I just used the prepared mixture I had on hand. My kids love anything cheese cakey or cheese danishy, and this did not let them down. Delicious! It was a lot of melted butter to pour over top. Will probably use about 1/2 the next time - and there will definitely be a next time! Thanks for a yummy dessert! Update 1/3/11...I've made this several times, the last time being New Year's Day. I used about 2/3 stick of butter and that was plenty...still delicious and not quite as greasy!

These were very easy and popular when I brought them to work.  I wasn't a big fan, but I think that's just because I didn't like the texture.

This recipe was super easy and sooo good. I made them for our Father's Day dinner and everyone loved them, even my picky nephews, when my Dad came to get a second helping they were gone! I will definitely make them again. I did do as others suggested and cut the sugar down to 3/4, they came out perfect.

I never would have imagined that crescent roll dough and cream cheese could taste this great together.  This recipe is great because it is easy - literally takes a few minutes to put together.  The baking time is right on - mine took 30 minutes to be just golden brown.  It tastes amazing.  I used 1 block of regular cream cheese and one block of reduced fat because that is all I had.  I followed some other reveiwers advice with the butter and brushed on about 3 tablespoons of melted butter before sprinkling the top with sugar and cinnamon.  I made this for the teacher's lounge tomorrow, but my husband just snuck a little corner piece and is claiming rights to the pan right now.  Will make often - thanks for an easy, delicious recipe.

I thought this was a bit on the salty side but perhaps that had something to do with the brand of cresent roll I used (?) I did use low fat cresent rolls and low fat cream cheese. Over all I did like the taste of this dish and I am sure I will make it again.

This recipes is ok.  Not a 5 star in my opinion though. My son & I both liked it.  My husband HATED it and he loves cream cheese and told me I should throw it out.  The only change I had made was adding some apple pie filling.

WOW!! These are delicious.  They are very rich but I think they need the butter/sugar/cinnamon crust on top.  I will make these again and again.  I am going to try to make a larger pan to use for coffee hour at church.  Thanks Ann for the great recipe.

I spread cherry pie filling over the cream cheese and it turned out wonderful! Also, I brushed the squares with beaten egg before baking and sprinkled some brown sugar. Eggs make the pie shiny :)

These were very easy to make and were ok. I didn't do the glazing on top and that might have been what was missing. Now, I didn't find anything spectacular about them.

I never write reviews, but this one was so fantastic, I had to! I was a little hesitant about how these would turn out, but the cresent roll dough makes them perfect! It crisps up into a wonderful sugary, crispy, flakey outside, and the cream cheese filling is perfect and creamy without being too sweet. I cannot say enough about these! I will definitely be making them again.

quite good! However, not my kind of treat (too much dough), might be better with a thinner pastry?

These were definitely a hit with everyone! The only thing I did differently was not pouring the butter over the entire pan, instead I just brushed it on and then sprinkled with sugar. I look forward to trying out some fruit combinations like other reviewers!

Update: The second time I made these someone in my dorm took the 9x13 pan and so I had to improvise. I used a muffin pan and sort of wrapped the dough around a glob of cream cheese. They came out good, not as good as the first time since I think they had too little cream cheese. They miht be better if I had added a little fruit preserves or something. They were definitely very cute though and easier to serve compared to the bars!

This is good, but very rich.  If I make it again, I'm definitely going to knock the number of servings down because I had a ton leftover.

Turned out delicious but almost too much filling. Next time I'll try using only 1 package of cream cheese and add a little ricotta for texture.

yum yum yum. I made them exactly as written except I halved it and used an 8x8 pan. The whole family likes these. They were super easy too so I'll definitely make these again :)

These were great!  I did drop the sugar down to 3/4 cup, and only brushed the top layer of dough with some UNSALTED butter.  I did not sprinkle any extra sugar on top, and did not use any cinnemon since my husband hates it.  They ended up tasting just like a Cheese Danish.  I found the dough to cheese ratio to be quite adequate.  I think the key on that part is to use the 9x13 sized pan as recommended.

I made these today to take to a church birthday party.  I had to bake it longer than the recipe says and it still has gooey spots in it.  Definitely cut down on the butter or leave it off altogether.  I will have to purchase another desert tomorrow before the party. Will not use this recipe again.

I have done this receipe with many, many variations.....everyone loves it!!  I leave off the butter for the top... it is way to much! sometimes I will put a bit of melted buter on top, or a bit of egg white.  Some easy variations are to use flavored cream cheese, or most recently I substituted half of the sugar for the same ammount of mango pepper jelly and it was a hit!

I really wanted to like this recipe & it had tons of stars from everyone else. I am one to make and rate the recipes as is the first time only because it make sense of what is being rated. This recipes was TOO sweet & the people that were receiving this LOVE sweet & they too concurred it was too sweet.  Second time I made them I reduced the cream cheese to 1-8oz, less than 1/2 C of sugar, reduce to 2T of butter, and sprinkled 2 T of butter on top and it stilled turned out to sweet.  What could be worse than too sweet is sweet and salty. The crescent rolls dough was too salty. Aghhhh! Sorry this recipe is not a keeper.

I must say this recipe is a great crowd-pleaser; I've taken it to countless brunch gatherings. I decrease the cream cheese to one package and add a can of Comstock Apples before putting on the final dough layer. Turns out great !

This is a very sweet dessert! I added a layer of Nutella before I spread the cream cheese mixture. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly. Everyone raved about them. I think the Nutella made a big difference by taking the taste to the next level.

Very simple.  Had all ingredients on hand.  The dough was fairly old; and low fat so it kind of fell apart but good thing it was smooshed into the bottom of the pan!  Used one persons suggestions regarding adding an egg.  BUT I only used half of an egg *beaten* and it had a very strange consistency.  I would DEFINITELY make these again, simple, easy, smells DELISH!  I did brush the top with margarine, sprinkled with the sugar/cinnamon mixture, and used less sugar in the cream cheese mix for personal preference.  I'll improve this next time until it is PERFECT! Thanks for the recipe!

The whole family loved these.  They were all gone by the morning.  I took the suggestion from some other reviews and cut the cream cheese filling in half.  I added some fresh fruit in some of them, and they were awesome!

Great and easy recipe.  Also, very versatile - you can add anything.  I addeed preserves one time, another time frozen fruit........all were good.  I agree, however, with other raters - a little butter for the top is all you need.

Spreading a layer of Apricot preserves over the cream cheese mixture is essential.  Also tried half with blueberry and was not nearly as tasty. Definitely one of the best desserts on this website and was still delicious using fat-free or sugar-free ingredients.

Fantastic recipe! Like someone else mentioned, I opted to do an egg wash with some sugar on top of the crescent roll layer and it turned out absolutely perfect. The first time I made half a batch and they disappeared really fast, so now I always make the full one!

These were confusing to me. Tasted more like a breakfast item or something but was too sweet. I didn't care much for the grainy texture on top from the sugar. Might try it again and add some flour and nuts to the topping. Serve it with some fruit on top as a breakfast pastry type item??? I was on the fence with this one.

I baked these yesterday to bring to work today for someone's birthday.  They were the 1st things to go, received lots of compliments and some recipe requests. ***The changes I made, I used butter instead of margarine, and only brushed it on, and replaced the sugar with Splenda.***They turned out great!

Very good bars! I didn't get the rave reviews others spoke of, but they did get eaten! I will definitly only brush butter across the top next time, the full 1/2 cup was way too much, looked like a lake of butter when it was cooking.

Since I didn't stick to the recipe exactly I have to give it a 4.  I used only one package of cream cheese and decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  Added a splash (probably 2 tsp.) lemon juice.  Topped the cream cheese with some raspberry jam that had been heated in the microwave to make it easy to spread.  Brushed the top with butter so that cut back on the butter.  Then sprinkled with sugar.  These were a huge hit.  Took them to work and they disappeared faster than anything I've shared with my co-workers in the past.  There were lots of questions about how to make them.  This recipe is very versatile.  Have fun with it!  Don't make it unless you can handle lots of compliments.  Rated as a 4 only because I made changes.

FIVE STARS ***** and this recipe deserves every star!!! This requires no cooking knowledge, easy to find ingredients, can be made completely by hand (I did; no mixer on hand.) and gives room for variations in flavor.   Now, I halved the recipe because one person (me) does NOT need to eat 24 servings of this glorious dessert. The only thing I would change next time is also add cinnamon to the bottom crust before applying the cream cheese mixture. No need to use so much butter (I probably used half of the halved amount).   I cooked this for about fifteen minutes and then turned off the oven and let it sit for another five minutes. Then removed from the oven. I couldn't resist waiting and tasted and nearly fell in love.   I was worried the spread would be too thick and the crust to thin and become soggy. Please don't have these concerns. Simply follow the directions, cook, wait, and devour.   Thank You Ann for a lovely recipe!!! Next time I hope to find better quality vanilla flavoring and crescent roll dough.

I found this recipe when i was searching for a sweet cream cheese to put on beligan waffles. I decided to try to recipe as well as use it on my beligan waffles (w/ strawberries all over it!) and its delicious for both!  Any time i've made this I add any fruit spread or jelly I have in the fridge to make it even tastier. I spoon on 3 lines of the jelly before putting on the second layer of cresent rolls. Always a hit at family brunches!

This recipe is so quick and easy.  I took the advice of others.  I only used one pack of cream cheese and half the sugar.  I also BRUSHED the top with butter and used less sugar on top as well.  Turned out wonderful!

What a great recipe! I love how the crescent rolls fit perfectly on my 9x13 pan. The sugar, cream cheese and vanilla mixed together is delicious by itself! I had to restrain myself from eating the whole mixture before putting it in the pan. Absolutely fabulous with fruit and ice cream. Plus you can't beat a super easy recipe! ~thanks for sharing ;D

This didn't have enough flavor or sweetness for us.  I cut back on the amount of butter by 1/2 but it was still too greasy to me.  I think adding some lemon extract to the filling would help, too.

This was okay.. it was way too sweet for my taste.  I only put half of the cream cheese mixture inside and it was still too sweet.  The sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top was nice though.  It was decent overall, but not something I would make to impress company.

SO simple and delicious!  I halved the amount of sugar that it calls for and it was still a little to sweet.  This would be fantastic with some sort of fruit added into the cream cheese.

A really easy recipe. It was VERY sweet so if you don't like things super sweet, you might want to reduce the amount of sugar you add to the cream cheese. I also reduced the amount of margarine, only brushing it over the top rather than using the entire half cup. I think it would be very tasty with a layer of apricot jam over the cream cheese. Other jams/jellies would probably be good as well but with the sweeter jams/jellies I would definitely reduce the sugar in the cream cheese.

Absolutely delicious.  I cut the recipe in half because it was just for my husband and I, used an 8x8 glass pan and used only 3 quarters of the amount of cream cheese it called for.  I also used less sugar to mix with the cream cheese and a lot less to spread on top, otherwise it would've been way too sweet.  I did use the amount of butter listed in the recipe and I'm glad I did because it added that extra pastry taste.  The squares came out perfectly and the whole thing was gone in one sitting.  :o)

These cream cheese squares tasted really good and were so easy to make them. I halved the recipe, used a blend of splenda baking and only used 2 Tbsp of butter. I definitely will try again adding some preserves.

The comment on the recipe describes this perfectly. I will make sure to stock up on crescent rolls and cream cheese when they are on sale because this is an easy recipe to make when you have last minute guests etc... I did find that you don't need as much cream cheese as the recipe indicated but otherwise great recipe!

This was a delicious and quick dessert!  However, I would highly recommend the following revisions.  For one, I spread a whole can of apple pie filling over the cream cheese layer and then draped the remaining crescent rolls on the top.  For the topping, I did not use any butter.  I didn't want it to be soggy.  But I did combine about 1/2 cup brown sugar with a tsp. of cinnamon and sprinkled that on top.  The flavor of the brown sugar and cinnamon went great with the apples.  I baked it for about 30 minutes.

I am not much of a baker.  These sounded fairly simple so I tried them last night.  The hardest part was that one of my rolls of crescent rolls was difficult to open, and I had to piece the squares together.  My husband and I each had one for breakfast this morning.  YUM!  I did exactly as the directions stated, and they are wonderful!  I may try adding some fruit preserves or pie filling next time, but we loved them as they were!

OMG! I read all the reviews about how delicious this was and boy was it awesome.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and butter instead of margerine.  I took others reviews and chilled it after it cooled and my god was it delicious. It was light and not too rich like some others suggested. I served it chilled with blueberry preserves on the side.  My fam gobbled it up in one evening and I'm making it again this weekend.  Thanks so much for this recipe that will now be a regular in our family.

These were not that great.  We didn't like the savory (buttery) cressents with the sweet cream cheese and cinnamon.  Maybe I will try this again but I will use pie crust or puff pastery.

These were good & a big hit at the party I took them to.  I did add 1 cup of chopped pecans & 1/4 tsp anise to the cream cheese mixture.  Next time I think I might take other users suggestions and cut back on the cream cheese as well & maybe use a pack and a half.  Very rich.

This was dee-licious! I took it to work for a "food day" and everyone loved it. Very easy to make, and the only thing I changed was to use about half as much of the melted butter on top. Yum!

I can't even begin to describe how easy and delicious these are. My fiance and I preferred them warm out of the oven, but they were very good after refrigerating too. Thank you very much for this recipe! Edit: I've made these many times, sometimes adding different flavoured jams which I spoon on top of the cream cheese layer. Tastes just like a danish!

Although these turned out pretty and everyone liked them when the came out of the oven warm, no one cared for them after they were cooled.  I also did not like the lines from the cresent roll triangles on the top.  If I ever make them again I will try to eliminate them.  I'm not sure I ever will though.

Ease of prep, tasty and delicious!  You can't go wrong.  Also tried omitting the vanilla & substituting 1/4 c. lemon juice. Wow!  I'm thinking lime juice next and after that other add to's.

Ymmm! My hubby keeps asking me to make them again. This time I will cut down on the cream cheese filling to one 8oz. box. I also added raspberry pie filling and it was sooo good. This time I will try with blueberry.

Converts sooo deliciously into a sugar-free treat, using Splenda 'n Smuckers SF
strawberry jam. Used egg yolk in cheese mixture and the egg white brushed on top, instead of butter.Hubby thought it was better than Entemann's. Plus, it's so rich, even a small portion is filling!
Thanx so much for recipe.

This is such a great recipe my husband just loves this. Another thing that you can do is put some strawberry jelly or jam on top of the cheese mixture. It will taste like strawberry cheese cake. Yum Yum .

I've been making these for years. My hubby loves them -- it's one of his fave desserts. The only thing is that it's "dangerous" for me because I could eat the entire filling even before spreading on the base layer!

I have been looking for this recipe after having it at a festival. I experimented a little with it and used only 3/4 c sugar in the cream cheese layer and then over half of that I spread Swedish Ligonberries.  Also I used  only a 1/2 stick of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" brushed on.  This was delicious.  I think I prefer just the plain cream cheese filling as it reminds me of a cheese danish.  I saved a few pieces for us and sent the remainder to the office with my husband.  They loved it.

I'm just starting to learn how to bake, so when I volunteered to make the treats for our morning staff meeting, I was a little nervous. This recipe was so easy, and several of my coworkers went for seconds, so I take that as a good sign!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used light cream cheese.  Personally, I found it to be a little too 'cream-cheesy', so next time I will use a little less cream cheese.  I also plan to experiment a little and follow the recommendation of one of my coworkers, which is to spread some apple or cherry pie filling on the cream cheese mixture then add the top layer of crescent rolls.  Thanks for the great recipe!

** update: layer of LEMON CURD (pie filling) on top of cheese layer, wonderful! My husband's FAVORITE is the Raspberry Pie Filling layer on top of the cheese layer!  **** Did as others suggested and added a layer of stawberry jam (1/2 jam, 1/2 sugarfree jam) on cream cheese layer, then put the second layer of dough. Also sprinkled cinn & sugar on top. EXCELLENT. Remember to let cool as it was so much better after in the fridge over night. The person that suggested putting foil on bottom of dish - good suggestion, will do that next time. Thanks for sharing!

So easy and really delicious!  Also really good (but totally different). . .brown some bulk sausage and mix it in to the cream cheese! Obviously remove the sugar for the recipe.

Very, very good!  You could probably make these with only 8 ounces of cream cheese and half of the sugar if that's all you have on hand, and they'd still be good.

This was awesome!  I gave it four stars because I made some changes - I used reduced fat crescent rolls, 1/3 cup Splenda baking mix instead of sugar in the cream cheese mixture, omitted the butter completely and used Florida Crystals natural sugar and cinnamon on top.  I served this at room temperature with light cherry pie filling.  Delish!  Will make again often.

This is my husband's new favorite dessert - he absolutely devoured the pan!  I really liked them too, but actually didn't think they were sweet enough.  I had cut the sugar down a bit, so next time I make them, I'll be sure to follow the recipe exactly.  We enjoyed them hot out of the oven (tasted like creamy cinnamon rolls) and cold from the fridge (tasted more like cheesecake).

I mistakenly poured the sugar and cinnamon into the melted margarine, but it still worked! When it first came out of the oven, it was a little runny. However, after cooling down, it is now easy to cut into perfect squares. My husband came back for seconds and thirds

These are really, really good! I'm planning on making this again tomorrow for my co-workers but I'm going to add some blueberry pie filling on top of the cream cheese. This recipe will be used often! Of course I did make some modifications to the recipe based on previous reviews (dont we all?!)... used 1-8oz package of cream cheese instead of 2 and half a stick of butter in place of the margarine. Make these you will LOVE THEM!!!!

Easy and delicious.  Very rich though.  I think that I'd have to agree that two packages of cream cheese was a bit too much.  However, if you are looking for a quick and easy dessert look no further.

These are wonderful little treats!  I made them for my boyfriend to take to the office and share with the folks.  Everyone loved them and have asked me for them repeatedly.  So much so, that my boyfriend (who never cooks)  made a pan last night to take to the office!

awesome... I just pulled them out of the oven and my boyfriend and I both couldn't resist the smell so we tasted it piping hot!  It took forever to eat because it was burning our tongues but we love it!  Hopefully it's just as good at room temp!

I have made these squares twice now and they were gone in minutes. I added an egg to the mixture and refrigerated them overnight. They were delicious and the filling stayed in place. Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe.

These were so good and easy! I prefer to eat them cold but they are also good warm, just a little messy. I can't wait to try it with strawberry cream cheese!

After reading reviews...I decided to try to make 1)less sweet 2) less cream cheese and 3) less greasy. I used a Pillsbury brand "pizza crust" instead of crescents dough. I "halved" everything else, EXCEPT the cinnamon & vanilla. Still used a 9 x 13 (sprayed with a butter spray) With all the changes, it turned out rich (but not oozing out, so much), sweet (but not too-sweet) & CRAZY DELICIOUS!

Really good. I used lime zest in the cheese mixture, and will be trying it again with lemon and orange. Sprinkled the top with raw sugar for more texture. Lots of possibilities with this one. Thanks for the recipe!

I used low fat cream cheese and low fat crescent rolls.  I also cut the butterin half and used 1/4 cup, which was plenty.  Everyone loved the squares, We call them "sopaipilla cheesecake" here in Texas!

Easy, delicious and quick recipe.  These are always a hit wherever they are taken, and rarely is there anything left to take home.  Nice creamy cheesecake-y texture inside buttery crust... how can you go wrong?

OMG these are wonderful.  I can now save money in the morning.  Instead of buying a pastry at almost $2.00 I can whip up a batch of these real quick. I couldn't even wait for these to cool.

Holy cow!  Fantastic recipe!  I made it just as written except I added two eggs to the cream cheese mixture to make it alittle more fluffy.  Worked perfectly!!  A definite keeper!!  I have had to make this on request several times already!!

These were easy and good-my two favorite things!  I used a basting brush to lightly coat the top with butter.  This was plenty of butter-and WAY less than what the recipe calls for. I definately prefered these after they chilled in the fridge.

Here's the thing, every Christmas I'm suppose to make Perrogies for my husband because it's a tradition he grew up with.  NOT ANY MORE!  These (while warm) tasted exactly like them and make in a fraction of the time.  I used R.F. (Reduced Fat) crescent rolls and R.F. cream cheese and they were still great!  I used butter instead of margarine.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and they fit perfectly in an 8x8 but the baking time remains the same.  Wait 'til I tell my Mother-in-law!

Soooo good and easy!  The recipe can easily be halved and baked in a 9x9 square pan (don't worry if the croissant dough doesn't quite fit). Cut the butter/margarine in half. Let it set in the fridge after baking. I'll be making these over and over again. I agree with a previous reviewer; better than cheesecake, easier to make!

I subbed and made this dairy free by using dairy-free crescent rolls, Tofutti better than cream cheese, and Earth Balance vegan buttery spread.  No one knew they were dairy free but me!

Great and easy to make. The cinamon/sugar on top tastes like cinamon toast. I let them cool in the fridge over night and they were easy to cut and place onto place. Very yummy!!

Delicious!  10 stars!  Scrap the margarine and go for the real stuff..BUTTER!  This is devine when still slightly warm.  Next time, I will cut the butter to 1/4c and use less sugar/cinnamon on top.  Cherry pie filling would be incredible in this.

Excellent! I added almond extract instead of vanilla - it was so good!!  I also didn't use nearly as much margarine.  I used 1/2 a stick and that was plenty. Very easy to make.

This is my favorite recipe to take to events.  They have been nick-named "Better than Sex Bars."  Haven't tried it yet, but thinking about adding a little amaretto to the cream cheese mixture to jazz them up.  They do seem to taste the best after having sat overnight in the refrig.

If heaven has a smell, it is the smell of these baking. You could never imagine how delicious they are until you try them. Super amazing. Followed recipe exactly. I cooked them late a night, let them cool a short time, then put into fridge & took to work the next day. Absolutely fabulous, and seemed to be even better as they became room temperature.

I have made these bars but use almond extract instead of the vanilla - delicious.  I also omit the butter and they are great!  I use about 1/2 the amount of sugar on the top.

My entire extremely picky family of 5 absolutely enjoyed this delicious treat and have since been begging for more. One suggestion, let this cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. Thank you for a great recipe. Definetely a keeper!

These truly are simple and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed.  My family ate the entire pan within hours.  They are easier to cut (and less likely to fall apart) if you wait for them to cool but it's hard to resist when they look/smell so good.  Thanks for such a fantastic recipe!

These squares are extremely delicious. They taste like cheese danish. I made mine with reduced fat crescent rolls and low fat cream cheese and oh yeah, a whole stick of REAL butter (something has to make it taste good!). This is great, you have to try them.

okay, here's the deal.  i rated this recipe only 4 stars for this reason...it calls for using margarine.  i make this exact same recipe using REAL melted butter and it is amazing!  this is my husbands absolute favorite dessert/pastry.  he likes it heated up with either vanilla or cinnamon ice cream on top.  this recipe using butter is a 10 star recipe.  use the real thing people!  enjoy!

Really nice recipe.  I made it for a party and it was a big hit. Goes great with coffee!  Made it again at a wedding breakfast, huge hit. I also added lemon zest as another reviewer suggested, turned out great.

This was one of the best desserts I've ever made - and it's so simple.  I took one batch to a party and they were gone! I was also asked for the recipe - which is always a good sign! I wouldn't change anything but I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to the mix.

I was invited to a last minute cook out. I did a recipe search saying I had crescent rolls & cream cheese on hand and found this recipe.  Boy am I glad I did.  The only things I did different, I took the suggestion of adding 1 egg and cutting the butter to 1/4 cup on top.  This is wonderful.  Two people asked for the recipe and every one that had some said it was great.  I can't wait to try it with fruit next time as some said they did.

If you haven't already, this is a must-try recipe.  Simple, yet so very delicious.  I took the advice of a reader and added an egg to the cream cheese mixture and then added a can of blueberry pie filling on top of the cream cheese.  Fabulous!

Love this recipe.  I followed the other advice and added an egg to the cream cheese and cut the butter on top in half!  Delish.

This recipe is great. I only gave it four stars though because I used a 1/2 cup of sugar and 1-1/2 tsp lemon juice to mix with the cream cheese, and for the topping I used a cinnamon sugar. I love this. It's soooo delicious.

The whole family loved them!! Would definitely make them again.  However, next time I would use a little less sugar and margarine.  It seemed like the melted margarine sat on the top during and after baking.  Didn't really soak in at all.  Never the less it was great warm and cold.

I heard about this recipe, got it from a friend but would never try it. Today I checked here and found identical recipe and read the great reviews. So I tried it. Unbelievable! I do think it's better completely cooled. It's so rich, my family of men have been snacking on it all day. I do think adding some fruit would only add to the dish. I was thinking about using raisins or craisins steeped in hot water to add to it next time. Or strawberry jam, apples, etc. But it definitely works just as written!

Made for breakfast this morning.  Delicious!  Made exactly as stated.  I was quite worried about the amount of butter but it ended up tasting great.  It was even better later in the day when it was chilled for awhile.

I made this before but a friend suggested that I tweak it a bit by adding canned apple pie filling.. its awesome too but cutting it in squares wont happen haha! I used One 21 oz can but you might not need all of it.. just enough to cover the cream cheese before you add the top layer of cresent rolls) I omited the lemon but may add it next time.  You could use whatever fruit pie filling you wish.. I'll bet Peach would be awesome too with the cinnamon. It also took 40 minutes in my oven..

I made this again this afternoon and did the following : added 1 egg to cream cheese mixture,  a heaping half a cup of sugar, 1 tbsp. lemon zest along with the teaspoon of vanilla,  mixed well, and poured over the first layer of rolls. Second layer of rolls was topped with 1 tablespoon of melted butter sprinkled with 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I made mine in a 12" x 8" glass pan for 30 minutes. I let it cool for about 30 minutes and cut a small slice out and it is heavenly, not too sweet and adding the egg makes this dessert  filling taste just like cheesecake!!

I took it to a party and 2/3rds were eaten, and I received compliments. But I didn't personally really like it. I guess I didn't like the texture. The dough was crispy out of the oven, but soft/soggy once it all cooled. I think I prefer more crunchy things. 
I recommend 1/2 the internal sugar and 1/2 the butter on top.

I used reduced fat crescent rolls and low fat cream cheese. I used only 1/2 cup sugar in the cream cheese. Perfect. I warmed about 3/4 cup strawberry jam plus a splash of lemon juice in the microwave and spread it over the cream cheese. I melted 4 tbsp of butter to brush on the top but it was too much. 3 tbsp as suggested by others is enough. I sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar on top and a little raw sugar. This was delicious and perfect. Also used a glass 9 x 13 pan. It baked for 27 min in my oven.

These turned out really good. I followed the recipe exactly. The only real problem I ran into were the cresecent rolls. Unfortunately mine were room temperature so they tore easy. The bottom wasn't too bad because I could shape with my hands. I managed to get the top covered but it wasn't "pretty". I reccomend you keep your rolls cold and roll them out into a sheet before laying the sheet ontop. I think the recipe calls for too much butter and sugar. Next time I'll use 4-6 tbsp of butter and a heaping 1/8 cup of sugar. I also think the top would be better using all brown sugar or a mix of brown and white, I'll try that next time.

Tasted really good but filling was a bit sweet. Maybe I could have baked longer, crescent was a bit softer than I thought it would be.Kids enjoyed very much.

Super easy to make, and quite delicious, however- I did find them a little bland. Will definitely make again, but thinking a little cherry pie filling, or lemon curd, would really make these dance! Definitely better warm!

Turned out really well. I did add some apricot preserves after the cheesecake layer and brushed on melted butter than pouring.  I used less than 1/4 cup and found that was more than enough. Will definitely make again...perhaps for a different Thanksgiving dessert.

I have made this twice and I love it. It's quick, easy and doesn't require much ingredients to make so it's pretty affordable. I even made this for my boyfriend and his family and they loved it. The only thing I would warn people about, is that it's pretty sweet if you follow the recipe. The first time I made it, I found it to be a bit too sweet for me. So the second time I made it, I cut back the amount of sugar. Instead of 1 cup of sugar in the cream cheese filling, I used 3/4 cup of sugar. And instead of a full 1/4 cup of sugar for the cinnamon/sugar topping, I used roughly half of 1/4 cup to slightly less than a full 1/4 cup. When I did that, it was perfect and incredibly addicting.

These are great little dessert squares if you are a cheesecake fan! I made them as written, and there was definitely too much butter. The edges of the bars were getting too done, yet there were little pools of melted butter still on top, and the crescent dough beneath those wet spots was still soggy. Next time I'll cut the butter at least in half. They were a tad bit too sweet as well, so I might use less sugar as well. But still really good!

This was really easy to make with my 9 year old and it was really really good. I did 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the 1 cup tho. we both agreed we shouldn't add anymore.

This was a huge hit on Christmas. I made this for the dessert to accompany the taco bar we had for the family Christmas gathering. It was extremely easy to make and I’ll be making it a lot more for parties of all kinds!

I’ve made this many times the only thing I’ve done differently in the past, is to, omit cinnamon altogether and drizzle with Cateja, a Mexican goats milk sweet sauce. Today I followed directions only cut the sugar down. Delicious!

I mixed brown sugar, cinnamon and white sugar instead. I brushed the butter on top instead of pouring so much butter. I sliced dish into diamond shapes and served with Silk Nog.

Tasty and fairly easy instructions, but I would suggest lining the pan instead of greasing it.  Let it set up after baking for about 30 mins. It's easier to cut that way. The kids googled it up!

These are always a hit at any event.  Like so many others I have adjusted the recipe as follows:  1 1/2 pkgs cream cheese,  3/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 6 Tablespoons melted butter.

Tasty recipe. For the filling I used 1 1/2 cream cheese with 3/4 C sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. I topped the cream cheese mixture with a thin layer of seedless red raspberry jelly. Bake until golden brown to avoid doughiness.

Be certain to bake this in a cake pan with at least 1 inch sides - I baked this in a sheet pan and the butter will drip off the sides when the dough raises. These are a favorite bar in my family.

OH MY are these addicting!!  These are a hit every time I make them, they rarely last more than 24 hours.  I like to vary it up a bit and add raspberry jam or fresh blueberries as well.  I can't wait to add lemon!

I wanted to add blueberries so this is what I did.  I doubled the cream cheese & only used 1/2 the sugar.  I also used the bigger pack of rolls.  I mixed up 2 pints of fresh blueberries with brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, & a dash of nutmeg.  I put a layer of cream cheese then the berries & more cream cheese.  After I put the rolls on top I brushed on the melted butter didn’t use the 1/2 cup.  The pic is the last piece left took it to a dinner party & was a hit. ??????

I have made this several times and it's always a hit.  I only use 8 ounces of cream cheese and find it more than enough.  Overall, it's an easy and good recipe.

Love this easy recipe, but add an additional 1/2 to whole package of cream cheese.  Add a little blueberry or blackberry jam, warmed and drizzled over the top of the cream cheese and bake as per recipe.

I made this yesterday and it came out perfect. My son helped me and he accidentally added the butter, sugar and cinnamon together to pour over the top..but it turned out perfect...it left this chewy delicious texture...will definitely make again. Thanks for the amazing recipe.

I just made these and altered the recipe some because of other review comments.  I used 2 cream cheeses, but just 1/2 cup of sugar and I also added a shot of lemon juice with the cream cheese mixture.  I added about 1/4 stick of melted margarine on top lightly distributing just enough to cover the top thinly and I did sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar mixture.   I am glad these turned out not too sweet but just right.

Loved it! Made it with my 4yr.old daughter. Easy and quick! I think next time I'll try it with graham crackers or nothing on the bottom of the dish. I think brushing is better than pouring the butter. The sugar and cinnamon will stick just fine to the brushed butter. The crescent roll on top was nice and crispy! I used blackberries!! Easy and yum.

This recipe was a great cheese danish recipe. Really quick to make, simple ingredients, and tasty! The only thing I would change in the future is to use wayyy less butter on the top - 1/2 cup is too much. I would opt for 1/8 or 1/4 cup max. Otherwise it was perfect!

The first time I made this it was delicious but a little boring. So I've changed it up a bit:

Instead of a bar, I made individual rolls. I also mixed cinnamon and poppy seeds into the cream cheese. What a delightful change!

Phenomenal, super simple recipe...I took advice from other members and cut the filling in half. For a creative twist I added some of my homemade lemon curd on top of the filling before 2nd "crust"...Simply devine~

I only used 3/4 cup sugar for the cream cheese mix and I added 1 tsp of lemon extract, it came out great.  I got compliments from several people.  Next time I make this will try actual lemon zest instead of lemon extract

I've made this twice.  The first time I wasn't quite happy with the result as the bottom was under cooked and the filling a bit runny and bland.  

The second time, I cooked the bottom layer for about 4 minutes before putting the filling and top layer on it.   I added a splash of lemon juice and about a teaspoon of corn starch to the filling.  It added A LOT of flavor and was firm after cooking.   I also just brushed the top with melted butter which allowed the top and bottom crusts to cook fully.

This is great for breakfast or dessert. I've added fruit on top of the cream cheese layer too. I've also either sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar or confectionary sugar.

I followed the recipe as it was written and it was pretty good. It was much better the next day after chilling in the fridge overnight. I would suggest adding lemon zest for extra flavor.

I did pre-bake the bottom layer 5 minutes and cut the sugar back a bit.    I loved it my friends loved and my husband loved it. Will make again!!!

Made this today for my birthday. I didn't change anything. I got a lot of compliments and none was left. I didn't even get any. I will definitely make again.

I made these for a 4th of July party. I started with 1/2 cup of sugar for the cream cheese and tasted it. I thought 1/2 cup was sweet enough and I love sweet things. Other than that I changed nothing. People were attacking them as soon as I set them down and an hour later they were gone. Everyone raved about them. Will definitely make again. I was really surprised how much people loved them!

I love this recipe.  It's always a hit at a get-together and is so versatile. Adding lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture makes it divine.

I don't know what the issue was here... But I couldn't get mine cooked through.  I followed the instructions exactly except I added some cherry pie filling on top of the cream cheese.  I poured all of the margarine on top.  I cooked it 5 minutes longer than the directions state, and the edges were brown and crispy while the middle of the dough was not cooked.  All of that unnecessary margarine could have been the issue.  Either way, next time I will not add all of that margarine, just a brushing.  I ended up having to put it into the oven for another 25 minutes on 350 to get the middle to even slightly cook.  I will make this again, without the cherry and without all of the butter.  But the cheese filling was TO DIE FOR.

1/2 cup of melted margarine or butter is way too much. One should lightly brush a thin coat over the bars before baking. Besides that, it was delicious :)

I made these bars and the only thing I changed was adding some strawberry preserves to the top of the cream cheese layer. It was very thin. They have no height like the picture at all. The crescent layer on top seems to have been too heavy. The filling was good. Won't be making again. Maybe I should have used an 8x8 size dish with 1 crescent roll package. Anybody else have this problem?

This recipe is very good, but very very rich.  You can only eat a very little at a time, so since it make a 13 x 9 pan, be sure your family likes sweet rich deserts somewhat like a cheese cake Danish.  Be sure to use margarine since butter would make it, in my opinion too rich.

Aha! I have found a terrific, super-easy dessert recipe to add to my personal notebook of excellent recipes that I'll enjoy over and over. I made this one as directed...almost. I'm sorry to those who are frustrated by slight changes. I used berry granulated sugar since I was out of regular granulated sugar, and I reduced the sugar by about half (the first time I looked at the recipe it said 1 cup & 1/4 cup. The 2nd time it said 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup. So to be safe, I went with about 1/2 cup & 1/8 cup. The lovely tang in the cream cheese came through beautifully. 

I brought the squares for dessert at a workshop I was attending and the attendees were delighted, going back for seconds, thirds, and asking to take a few squares home besides.

Thank you for the recipe!

Very easy and hit the spot.  Next time I will use less sugar though. I didn't even use the full cup, skipped the sugar on top, and it was still a bit too sweet. I also just brushed the top with butter and cinnamon. I think pouring on all that melted butter might have been overkill.  Very tasty though!

This was too sweet for my taste.  Recommend cutting back on the sugars.

I made these as an addition to a variety tray to add something different than the norm...turned out they were the hit of  the party and I have gotten MANY compliments and requests since! Definitely worth trying if you are considering...I have a feeling I will be making these over and over again!

Delicious!  Everyone loved it!  Best when it's fresh out of the oven.  This would be good as a warm snack instead of cookies, or as a side/after sweet for breakfast / brunch.

On the plus side, this recipe is so simple, I made it with my three year old niece. The problem, way too much cream cheese and too much sugar. I only added 3/4, but it still needed to be cut, maybe some lemon juice like others have said. My biggest issue is that there was so much cream cheese in the center that the bottom could not bake before the top of finished. Next time I will half the cream cheese, use a darker nonstick pan, or cook in the lowest shelf of the oven, to cook the bottom a little faster.

The recipe has potential, but needs some work.

This recipe is quite tasty as written. I have also added apples and pecans before putting the top layer on. Since there are only three of us, I halve the recipe and cook it in a square, glass dish.

The center of the pan is nothing but thick cream cheese, and the bottom layer of 'crust' is too soft.  Next time I make this, I'll halve the cream cheese and use a metal pan to try to toast up that bottom layer.  It's way too soft and mushy otherwise.

LOVE this recipe. We have a family disagreement about whether they are more awesome cold or hot. 

I cut the butter to 1/4 cup and they're still delicious.

I LOVED IT! Only thing I would change is use only one block of cream cheese instead of 2. Other than that, I can't stop going for another piece! Yummy!

Super yummy! Super easy! We had some Honey Pecan cream cheese in the fridge so we added that to the regular cream cheese. LOVED IT! Used coconut oil instead of margarine.

I make this all the time for work functions. People LOVE it. It's an easy crowd-pleaser. I've done variations with apricot and strawberry and they're both lovely. Definitely use less butter on top - 3 Tbsp has been plenty for me.

Read reviews, took advice and decided to make blueberry. Added my own spin and used half plain and half blueberry cream cheese. I used honey butter crescent rolls so I just brushed on the butter. I also made a warm sauce out of my leftover pie filling. What a hit. They were loved by all. Can't wait to try cherry and strawberry.

This is better than any bakery we can buy from the store in our small town.  I only use half a recipe because there is only 2 of us.  I cut the sugar in half for the cream cheese mixture and only use about 1 tablespoon with cinnamon for the topping, and use about 2 tablespoons of butter.  We can't tell the difference.  This is our special treat once or twice a month.

Super easy and super delicious! They are great warm right out of the oven or the next day after they've firmed up in the fridge overnight! I will be making this again!

I made these for my wife and her coworkers. She reported back her coworkers were "going nuts!" over the treats. The pan was empty within 10 minutes once word got out. A big hit!

This is sooooo good!  It was delicious as is, but the second time around I did change a few things.  I added a teaspoon of almond extract, about 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Also, my daughter had the idea to just stuff each crescent roll with the cream cheese stuffing to make them individual servings so we did that, and added raspeberry or apricot jelly to some of them. What an awesome and easy quick dessert!  Thank you for this recipe!!

I've made this recipe multiple ways. As it's written it's a 4 for me. I've made with apricot and raspberry preserves. My favorite is adding 1 tsp. almond extract to the cream cheese instead of the vanilla then topping the cream cheese with raspberry preserves. With those changes I'd give it a 5.  As others have stated melting about 3 Tbls. butter then brushing that on top of the crescent roll worked best and helps to cut back on the butter a bit.

Easy and good. Agree that half as much butter would work. Spread strawberry jam over the cream cheese so I left off the cinnamon.

I made these over the weekend and they were super easy and turned out great! Per other reviews, I made a few changes like using low-fat cream cheese and cresent rolls, 1/2 cup of sugar for the filling, added an egg and 1/3 cup fat-free sour cream to the filling. I made two batches -- one plain and one with half blueberry pie filling and half cherry pie filling.  My son loved them and I brought the leftovers into the office and everyone who has tried them has asked for the recipe.  Will definitely be making these again and like the idea from one reviewer of making them in a mini-muffin pan as little poppers -- would be great for a party or shower where bite-size foods work best! Thanks for the tasty, quick and easy recipe!!!

My family absolutely loved these.  So much easier than making a cheese cake and tasted just as good. Some people like them cold but I like them warm. The 2nd day after they have been stored in the frig all you have to do is put a square in the microwave for 10 seconds and it tasted like you just made them.  Will definitely be making these again and again.

Tried this recipe, only using some puff pastry dough I had lying around and it turned out great! The smell while it was cooking was amazing, too. The only thing I'd say is maybe add a little less sugar to the cream cheese mixture.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  It's now on everyone's list for me to make for holidays. It's soooo easy and dang tasty! You definitely don't need as much sugar as it calls for so cut that down a bit a bit less butter. Line your pan with aluminum foil and after backing wrap up and refrigerate. It taste much better :)

Loved this quick & easy YUMMY recipe. My kids said to make tis again. I'll make this every other week for treat for us. I didn't change a thing. I just added fresh strawberries on it. Very good! My kids don't like strawberrys (weird huh) so I just put a little Hershey chocolate syrup on it w/a scoop of ice cream. Thanks for the recipe Ann :)  It's a keeper for sure.... Tim & my kids

I did the recipe  exactly as written and found that one cup of sugar is way too much to add to the cream cheeses. I like the dish but it was way too sweet with the sugar in the cream cheese and in the topping. Next time I will reduce the sugar to Maybe one third cup and add some cherry topping before putting the next croissant topping

These were so easy to make and were a major hit with my family.  The only thing I changed was to cut back on the butter to 3 tbs and simply brush it on the top layer before sprinkling on the cinnamon sugar.

Really good and easy. To make half: 1 pkg rolls, added 1 egg to cream cheese, decrease sugar to 1/4c; add squirt of lemon juice; decrease butter to 2T; added almonds on top of blueberry preserves on top of cheese mix. Bake in 9X9 pan. Used puff pastry the second time and worked well.

This is absolutely delicious and easier than something this good should be.  A dollop of ice cream or whipped cream is a nice addition, but it stands alone perfectly well.

The recipe I use does 1/2 cup sugar and an egg with the cream cheese. I use 1/2 almond extract, 1/2 vanilla, and the flavor perks up more. I also use recipe creations dough sheets, no pinching seams. This is very popular. I also do not use margarine on the top, just make my own sugar cinnamon mixture by eyesight and sprinkle on top when it is done.

So rich!  I baked it for a total of 40 minutes. The top is still crispy and inside still gooey.

These were ok.  Nothing special.  If I were to make it again, I would add more jelly or something to make it stand out.

The only thing I did differently with this recipe was adding lemon juice to the cream cheese to give it a little more flavor.  Everyone who's tried it has loved it!!!

I made these today for my husband's birthday dinner, adding a simple fried apple topping, along with either vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, and upon the very first taste, everyone was already asking for a larger portion!  When my husband, a non-dessert person, said, "Oh.My.Gosh.", while his mouth was full of the first spoonful, I knew we had a hit! LOVE!

This is an impressive dessert that couldn't be any easier!  There are so many ways you can change this up to suit the season.  To add a little more depth to the flavor, I used almond extract in place of the vanilla, omitted the cinnamon, and drizzled some melted dark chocolate over the chilled bars.  Needless to say, they vanished quickly off the plate.  I will definitely be making this again.

Made this to take to Sunday school and everyone loved it. I added a bit more vanilla and a dash of lemon and I think that really put it over the top. There wasn't any leftover.

I made the recipe as written and they are addicting.  The only modification I would probably make would be to cut down on the butter in the final step of the recipe.

I made this recently and the family loved it.  It was very quick and easy.  Next time I think I will use a little less butter.  I had to bake mine an extra 5 minutes because the butter was still runny.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I followed this easy recipe and delighted my whole family.  My husband asked if he could sneak another piece when the children went to bed.  The last piece was cut in half two times to avoid a fight.  YUM!

DELICIOUS!!!!  Made this last night to serve as a dessert for a group of young adult guests.  Young adults aren't known for handing out generous compliments so I really didn't expect to hear anything from them about this dessert.  But to my surprise, they couldn't stop raving about these cream cheese squares!!  They wanted more and even asked for the recipe.  I did follow the advice of others and only used one 8 oz. package of cream cheese with a generous 1/2 cup of sugar.  Everything else remained the same.

This was very good as is, reason for the four stars, but thought it could have been cheesier, so the second time around I added another block of cream cheese.  Superb!  Would now give it five stars.

I made this exactly as written, and I love anything with cream cheese but this was not good.It seemed to be too much cream cheese and butter. I tried a piece when it was warm, blech. Then tried another piece after it was refrigeratorated overnight and seemed to be a tiny bit better tasting, but still nothing for me to say I will want more. Although my kids seems to like it, although there is still 4 pieces left in the fridge after 3 days,lol. If I do make again, I would definitely useonly 1 pk of cream cheese and way less butter, maybe just a brushing on the top. And sorry, but reviewers who said tastes just like cheesecake... uh no not even close!

Followed recipe exactly and it was perfect. Took to church coffee hour and everyone raved about it, wanted recipe, especially after hearing how easy it was to make. A definite keeper and favorite.

Tried this for the weekend and was good.  I made it fit for my family by changing out half regular cream cheese with strawberry type.    I added 1/2 c of strawberry preserve and hit jalapeño pepper jelly to the filling layer.   The technique for lightly brushing the top layer with butter verses pouring over worked nicely.   My family enjoyed the changes and will
Make this again for a treat on the weekend.

I have not tried this recipe, but have made others. I would suggest that a 1/4 tsp nutmeg be added and the cinnamon reduced by perhaps half.
I have to try this and experiment with the added spices.

This is so good and so easy! I read a few reviews and I took into consideration what was said and used just one 8 ounce pack of cream cheese and it was delicious. Definitely making this again. Adding guava next time.

I tried this for the first time and my family loved it. I cooked the bottom crust for 5 minutes  as another reviewer suggested, then added the cream cheese mixture and then added the top crust.It turned out great. Very easy and quick to make. I will for sure make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

Someone brought these to work, and I had to have the recipe.  These are super and flexible.  Change the extract to almond, use slivered almonds on top, or if you want to have pucker use lemon extract (not juice) and lemon zest and curls on top - or crush Lemonheads candy and sprinkle lightly.

Yummy and super easy! Per the advice of other reviewers, I brushed butter on the top layer instead of using the full amount. I put a layer of raspberry preserves on 1/3 of it, apricot preserves on 1/3, and left 1/3 with just the cream cheese, it was all really good but I think I like the raspberry section the best.

Wowzer! So luscious, quick and EASY.  Teens could make this with friends or when babysitting. I cut the recipe in half and used an 8 x 8-in pan, and it turned out great--plain for hubby, nuts on my half.  Love the buttery taste at the edges.

I've made the original recipe twice now, and everyone at church loved it. Today I made it with the addition of a cup of pumpkin, and some pumpkin pie spice. That meant that I had a bit too much cream cheese mixture for the middle (what a shame) which we will gobble up with some ginger snaps....:)

Me and my four year old daughter did this recipe together. I added an extra ingredient, in which I always add to my cream cheese mixtures. Other than that, we followed the recipe to a T. It was absolutely awesome!!!! The pan did not last long. It is simple, easy, and a new "potluck" dessert I will be sharing with friends and family. We preferred it warm, the cinnamon and sugar on top just sets it off perfectly.

Delicious! I halved this recipe for an 8x8 pan, and accidentally added only 1/4 c. sugar to the cream cheese. I thought it was perfect . . . 1/2 c. would have been too much. Although I usually tinker with recipes, this one really doesn't need any tweaking. Will make again and often.

Perfect.  I thought a stick of melted butter over all of it was going to be seriously too much and the 1/4 c of sugar on top too, but in following the recipe exactly, it turned out perfectly.  I look forward to trying varieties of it. Hubbie liked it, so it is going in the recipe box :)

Thanks for sharing

Wonderful! These are great just like they are but even better if you add you favorite jam to the mixture! P.S. I didn't use all the filling it seemed like too much for those thin layers of crescent rolls.

I almost love this, but my husband and I think it is too rich & sweet and both the bottom & top crusts were still soggy when fully baked. First taste is "wow", then it got hard to finish. I think the large amount of butter soaked the top layer. Served at room temperature, the filling is also quite soft, firmer when chilled; don't expect it to be like baked cheesecake, but more like the texture of cream cheese folded into whipped topping. I still ALMOST love it, and will be tweaking left and right until it fits my personal preference.

This recipe is amazing!! At first I was very skeptical that crescent rolls could taste good with this mixture but it works! I followed the recipe exactly as written an it was so simple and tasted great! I will be using this recipe again!

I feel like there's far too much butter in this recipe.  I had butter pooled up on the top of mine when it should have been done.  I had to soak it up with a paper towel and put it back in.  I cooked mine for 35 minutes and the bottom crescents are still doughy from all the butter.  Not happy.  Plus, too much sugar is called for on top so I didn't use it all.

This was delicious.  I liked it warm and cold but my husband and I preferred it cold.  I look forward to making it again. Next time I might add some fruit filling or put some raspberry sauce on the side for dipping.

With no flour in house and company coming, this pkg of crescent rolls saved the day.  Made as written but halved ingredients. Quick prep time was an added plus and the crescent rolls don't scream "not homemade" when you eat it. Only change was to add raisins to the cream cheese mixture.  Took 8 more minutes to bake - maybe the 8" pan as not big enough. Regardless - First Rate - everyone loved it.  Will try with a bit less cream cheese next time to see if it speeds up bake time (or if it loses something because not enough cream cheese).

Taste - great. Super easy. The amount of butter for the top is WAY too much and prevented to dish from cooking correctly. It took almost twice as long! Next time I will just brush butter on top and sprinkle either powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar; also will only use 1 block of cheese. Overall it was good!

Made this over the Holidays and have been asked repeatedly for the recipe. I do add a teaspoon of lemon juice to the cream cheese and a thin layer of strawbeery jam on top of the cream cheese layer.

I would recommend cutting the cream cheese and sugar in half. It is way too rich otherwise. I followed the recipe exactly as stated but will try again with half the cheese mixture next time.

Made this today. Loved it. Loved it. Easy to make and I liked it better after I took it out of the oven and had some at room temp. I did put it in the fridge but still liked it on the slightly warm side. My friends loved it also. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 C. and melted butter to 1/4 C. Thank you.

Took these along for a day out with the girls at the local winery.  They were so easy to make and a huge hit!  I will definitely make these again and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.  I will admit, I did take one shortcut, I had some premixed cinnamon sugar that I used instead of what it calls for in the recipe.

Who doesn't love cream cheese desserts? I used the butter flavored cresent rolls, only one package of cream cheese, and added an egg for fluffiness! This is such a hit at parties and it is gone within a couple of minutes. I will definitely make this again and again

Made yesterday. Love it.. Just like a good cheese danish.  I put a egg in the cream cheese filling. So happy that I don't have to buy danish again..

As others said, these are special!  So easy and so fabulous.  They are a new favorite.  I'll always have cream cheese and crescent roll dough on hand from now on!  You never know when you're going to get a craving.

I followed recipe as is but added one egg to mix.  These were WONDERFUL !!!  Next time I made these I put a layer of rasberry jam on the bottom and used 1/2 tsp of lemon extract to cream cheese mix.  Not as good as original recipe.  5 stars to original recipe

This was a big hit with the ladies book club. I followed someone's suggestion and added an egg to the cream cheese mixture. I think it would be just as good with less melted butter and sugar mixture. It's one of the easiest desserts I've ever made. I will for sure make this again

I 1/2 the recipe and put it in an 8x8. My family was going a little crazy because we were out of icecream (a must in our house). I had everything to make this and it went over VERY well!! I was very pleased with how something so simple tasted so wonderful. I even had some of the leftovers for breakfast :) I can see how this could easily be adaptable to everyones taste with fruit or chocolate! Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

What a nice quick dessert.  I halved this recipe, used an 8” x 8” square glass baking dish, sprinkled sliced almonds on top and it came out fantastic.

Awesome & Easy! My husband loves it as a breakfast treat. For a simple twist, add some jam to the cream cheese mixture (decrease the sugar a little). Great last minute dessert to make.

I made this last night because I love anything that tastes like cheese cake.  It was delicious!  I would say that the sugar should definitely be cut in half and I used 1/2 of what the recipe called for and it was still a little too sweet.  I would also recommend that you only use 1 package of cream cheese.  The next day I put a leftover piece in the toaster oven, amazing.

We bust out this recipe whenever we have a special occasion. With a few changes. First we use lemon extract instead of vanilla, only 12 oz of cream cheese and divide the butter 1/4 in the filling & 1/4 on top.

These were absolutely amazingly awesome.  Will definitely be making them again.  The only thing I would recommend would be to we careful with the amount of butter, after cutting this recipe in half (so I only used a 1/4 of a cup), it could have used less.

Really good, but next time I will halve the sugar (it was overwhelmingly sweet, I like the taste of cream cheese) and bake the bottom layer of crescent rolls for a few minutes before spreading the cream cheese. Very fast recipe, I will be keeping it.

These are excellent and very easy! I agree with some other reviewers that the cream cheese/sugar is too much as recipe is written. I made 1 1/2 batches (using 3 cans of dough) with 2 packages of cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar and it was plenty of filling for both batches. Also, I melted only 1/4 cup butter and brushed it over the top.  I made one with strawberry preserves over the cream cheese and one with just lots of cinnamon/sugar on top...both were great. Thanks for the recipe!

excellent recipe. So easy. Per our family preferences I did cut back the cream cheese to 1 pkg and thus decreased the sugar. Have made this with and without adding fruit filling and is always a winner

Heavenly!  I made these exactly according to the recipe and they turned out great.  One of the best desserts I've had.  I think some fruit and maybe some nuts would be good additions.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband that does not usually eat sweets is addicted to these.  He frequently comes in with cans of crescent rolls and cream cheese.  So, I know he wants me to bake him a batch.  He loves them right out of the oven.

These are very good but rich.  I liked the idea of adding some flavor with jam so I added pineapple jam to the first layer of crescent rolls.  I halved this recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan.  Although we liked it, I am with other reviewers on the fact that you can easily use less butter and less sugar topping.  It's very creamy and nice, though, so worth repeating.  I used the Golden Crescent Rolls dough on here for the crescent rolls part, using half of the dough for this and half for another recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!  I only had one package of cream cheese (I used reduced-fat), so I substituted the second with marscapone, which worked nicely.  Also, with the fat already present in the crescent rolls and cheese, it seemed a little unnecessary to pour an extra stick of butter on top (?!).  I skipped that step and just dusted the top with cinnamon-sugar.  It was delicious and everyone raved about this desert.

Amazing!  Perfect as is.  I added jam to 1/2 the batch to try it, but enjoyed the plain side way more.  Delicious!  Next time I'll try cutting down on the butter.

LOVE these!!!  5 stars because they're very easy to make, and people always rave about them.  I've made them for 11 years, and friends request them all the time.  I do cut the amount of melted butter in half.

These were just OK for me.  My family wasnt' thrilled either.  Probably won't make again.  The cream cheese filling is way to over-powering.  I used butter in place of the margarine because that's all that I buy so maybe that was the issue.  Thanks for sharing.

WOW I made these and they vanished!! I prefer having them warm but my husband like them cold. I used half a cup of sugar so it wouldnt be too sweet and only about 1/8 cup on top and you don't need so much margarine it spreads gernerously and I had alot of margarine left over.

Love these bars! You can serve them right out of the oven or cold. I have had them for breakfast and dessert. I only pour 1/4 c of butter over the top, but my mother-in-law completely skips the butter and it still tastes great. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were pretty good! I made this  dessert for a family dinner.  Based on the great reviews I thought they would be AMAZING, but they were just Great instead!!    The cream cheese seemed a little thicker than I like.   I will make these again though!!  Next time I think I will actually use less cream cheese/sugar and less butter then what was called for to make them less fattening.

My kids came in and weren't overly impressed by how it looked but after they tasted it..well, lets just say this didn't last long. They devoured it! Ok, maybe their dad and I helped a little bit!! So good with jam on top of the cream cheese mixture! I'd have to go along with the other reviewers and say just generously brush on some melted butter. Wonderful, easy recipe. Thanks!

I wouldn't change anything about this recipe. It was absolutely delicious! So much for the diet with a pan of these goodies in the kitchen. If you like cream cheese, you will love this recipe and the cinnamon just adds to the wonderful flavor!

Yummy! I decreased the sugar (that mixes with the cream cheese) to 3/4 cup and then only 1/4 cup cup of sugar for the topping. It's a great indulgence so things could probably be reduced further down to make it what you prefer. Regardless, it was a hit and tastes good either warm or cold! Thanks!

It was good, but it had too much cream cheese and it was too sweet for my taste.  I will try it again with only half of the cream cheese filling.

Oh my! I accidently made this in an 8x8 pan, so it was thick, but I put it in the fridge, and then cut into tiny squares and placed on a plate the next day for company, and everyone LOVED them.  They were like little decodent bites of heaven! :)  LOVED Them! EMMMM!

These are to die for!! I recently made a batch for my husband to take to a work function & he said they were gone in minutes & he's been asked to bring them again already.  They're so versatile. I've made them plain & also with raspberry jam; both ways are amazing.

I loved this recipe! It was quick, yummy, and most importantly cheap! The only thing I will change for next time is less butter and sugar on top of the dish, other than that it was perfect. I would also recommend letting it cool completely before cutting into it, that way you get the pretty looking bars like the ones in the pictures.

Easy and a favorite.  Did not last long at a party.  I melted the margarine and brushed it over the top as another review suggested.  Did not use it all either.  Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup as well.  People are wanting the recipe!

Easy to make, tastes AMAZING!  not overpoweringly sweet/rich.  I used an electric mixer to whip the cream cheese and it made it very easy to spread.  Very good chilled.  My gf and I loved them!

This is one of the easiest desserts that I have ever made!  I changed it up a little and added strawberry preserves and it was delicious.  I have made it w/out preserves and it was good too!  You can also half this recipe and just a smaller pan, one can of cresent rolls - and just layer half on bottom and the other half on top.  I have made this two nights in a row, and will probably save this recipe for my Christmas breakfast!  Thank you for submitting.

I made this one for my diabetic boyfriend.. used splenda in place of sugar, and omitted the melted butter on top.  I also added a layer of sugar-free strawberry preserves over the cream cheese.  This dessert was a HUGE success and was gone in no time flat!

This was so incredibly easy and equally as delicious!  I took the advice of a couple other reviewers and made a few changes. First I only used 3/4 cup sugar, added one egg, and about 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade into the cream cheese mixture. I could not image using that much butter so I melted about 2 tablespoons and then brushed it on the top crust.  The sugar and cinnamon topping is a nice touch.  These squares are definitely better after they've chilled a bit in the fridge.  These tasty little squares will become a staple dessert!

This was absolutely delicious!!! I only used 3/4 cup sugar, and found that to be more than enough. I did use the full 1/2 cup of butter, but could easily get away with half that amount. My husband and daughter devoured this. Thanks so much for the recipe. I will make these again for sure!! :)

These are fantabulous!  Everyone in the office is raving about them this morning.  They are a little sweet for my taste, so I'd love to try them with half the sugar, but no denying they are delicious.  I added lemon zest and squeezed a little lemon juice into the cream cheese mixture and added an egg as well.  Made a 2nd batch with raspberry jam spread over the filling.  Wonderful.  Also, I just brushed the top layer of dough with butter rather than pour a bunch of melted butter over the top.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I literally said "Oh My God" when I tasted these. They really are phenomenal! I made the recipe exact, except added lemon zest after reading some reviews, because I love it in cheesecakes. Next time I think I'll add some cherry filling. But without adding anything they are awesome!!

Made this today following the recipe here (without alteration).  Turned out fantastic.  Bought some apple pie filling to put on top but didn't use it.  It was delicious as is.  Tastes like cheesecake with an Elephant Ear crust on top.  Will make again without any doubt.  Good stuff!

When I started making this recipe I didn't realize my crescent roll dough was expired. All I had to use as a substitute was cinnamon roll dough. I left out the cinnamon the recipe calls for and topped it off with the frosting from the cinnamon rolls. They were fabulous!

I halved the recipe excluding the crescent rolls to have less sugar and fats. A tad overcooked but still very good. Next time I'll cook for 20 minutes with my modifications.

This is great!  I also used Splenda instead of sugar and it was amazing.  I did use real sugar for the top and I used real butter instead of margarine.  Great quick recipe!

Yum! I topped the cream cheese mixture with fresh strawberries, then sprinkled a teaspoon of sugar over the crescent crust.  I was mostly surprised that my hubby, who normally doesn't like deserts, LOVED these bars!

I read the reviews before making these and decided to add an egg to the cream cheese and sugar mixture. I also used real butter instead of margerine and only used half of what the recipe called for. I chose to use the "big and flakey" crescent rolls instead of regular ones but I think I'll use the regular rolls next time to see if it cuts down on the extra doughy edges. I will definitely be making this again and probably add fruit to it! Thanks for the recipe!!

What a great, basic recipe! I have made several variations of this and it always goes over well. Most recently, I added cold cuts on top of plain cream cheese and was able to please my two year old!

These were yummy! I added rasberry preserves as some people had suggested.  I thought it made them a little mushy and would make them exactly as written next time. This was so easy and quick and the results were fantastic!

EXCELLENT dessert!  I got rave reviews when I made this and it's super easy.  I just did 1/2 with blackberry preserves since I hadn't made it before and wasn't sure how it would turn out.  I am 100% making these again, as soon as I have an excuse!

Love, love, love this!!  Quick and easy and absolutely delicious! My family prefers it exactly as written.  The 3 of us will eat it in a day - large servings at breakfast, then as a snack later in the day.  If there's still some left, it's eaten as a bedtime snack.  It's just that good!

These are so easy to make and everyone loves them. I made them for a potluck at work today and they were the first thing to disappear. Everyone wants the recipe so I have to make some copies. I put a thin layer of wild berry ice cream topping on top of the cream cheese layer. I can't wait to try other flavors. Remember if you take these somewhere bring along several copies of the recipe!!

So easy and so yummy! I used no fat cream cheese to keep it semi healthy. And halved the butter on top and think it was still too much. I think I will brush it on like another reviewer mentioned. But, overall I am happy with the outcome and so were the munchers. These were a hit!

Holy cow this was good!  My husband and I ate half the pan.  The only thing I did differently was add some chocolate peanut chips, but I would do it again.  Hubby wants to try with a layer or strawberry jam.  LOVED these!

OMG!! This is great. I ran with the recipe, and put 6 TBSP. of my mother-in-laws homemade raspberry jelly on top of the bottom crust,[put 1 tsp. each of vanilla and lemon juice in the cream cheese mixture] spread cream mixture on top of that, then top crust. Baked according to directions. I made a lemon glaze and put about half of that on the crust, when it came out of the oven. This is awesome. Thank you so much.

Oh my goodness!  This is incredibly delicious.  I've made it twice, and the only thing I changed was to add a little more cinnamon/sugar mixture over the top than what the recipe called for.

Heavenly!  It came out better than I expected.  I was confused by the term "white suger" which I assumed meant powdered or confectioners sugar (as opposed to table or granulated sugar).  I substituted the crescent rolls with a new Pillsbury product called Crescent Recipe Creations.  Only other change is I omitted the cinnamon.

This recipe was delicious! I had never worked with cream cheese in baking before, and now I officially can't get enough. I almost ate the whole tray by myself!

I used regular salted butter and the squares turned out extremely salty. I would cut the butter in half (at least) and use non-salted butter.

Great recipe!  Made another version of this dish a couple months ago, and I prefer this recipe.  Did not add the margarine to the top as called for in the recipe.

This just never turned out very good for me. The dough on the bottom wasn't done enough and they were only good warm. They tasted OK but after trying this a couple times, I think I will look for something else.

I used this recipe and it was "okay" it lacked creativity and ...just it lacked something. Overall though it was pretty good for such a quick and easy recipe. I took some advice of others and put some sugar free strawberry preserves on one half, and that half was the big hit.lol..

Delicious!  I 1/2 the recipe and made in 8x8 pan.  I also placed frozen raspberries over the cream cheese layer and did not use the butter mixture on top.  This was plenty sweet for us and quick and easy.  Be sure to cook long enough because it can be kind of soggy and doughy if you don't.  I will be making this recipe again. Thanks.

This is a great fast pastry.  It reminds me of a cheese danish. I would recommend using half as much melted butter, and maybe brushing it on instead of pouring it.  It made spots that were super buttery, and those spots did not cook evenly. Otherwise it was great!

I added a layer of Guava paste above the cream cheese, and my husband declared these were his favorite dessert of all time! I didn't think 1 cup of sugar was necessary, 1/2 c tasted sweet enough. Also, i skipped the excess butter and just sprinkled sugar/cinnamon on top! DELISH!!

I had a container of blueberry creamcheese in my fridge that needed to be used,(think i mistakenly bought). I used it with this recipe. I really liked but next time i will use regular creamcheese. can't wait to have Easter brunch to make again. I think i'll make both because the blueberry gave it an Easter look. Thanks

I have been making these for years and always enjoy these. They are a hit with family and friends and they seem to get eaten very quickly. I've made it with and without the sugar/cinnamon mix and melted butter on top. I recommend always adding the butter and sugar/cinnamon. It takes this dessert to a whole different level.

I follow this recipe to the 't' and it turned out great.  The crust came out soggy when baked at 30 minutes total, so I baked it an extra 10 minutes and it was still a bit soggy.  Prehaps an extra 15 minutes next time.

Very easy to make. I added sugar-free strawberry preserves on top of the cream cheese mixture and used less sugar in the cream cheese mixture. I sprinkled brown sugar on top with the cinnamon. I would give it a 5 after the changes.

This is not easy if you are trying to make these with cold cream cheese and not electric mixer..So either get the cheese to room temp or use a mixer.  My arm about fell off.  Anyway these were very easy, but extremely rich(and have trans fats).  Good, but most likely won't be making again.

I have to say I was a bit disappointed with all the great reviews.  I'm not sure what it was but I think maybe it was all that butter and I agree too much cream cheese.  Way too rich for me.  I should of listened to other reviewers.  Even my family wasn't crazy about these.  Sorry ...

These are great!! I did reduce the sugar a bit.  I added only 3/4 cup to the cream cheese mixture, and only sprinkled about 2 tablespoons on the top.  Excellent, will make these often.

I don't think I cooked mine long enough they were rather gooey... I would say to cut back on the sugar and the cream cheese. I used 12 oz cream cheese and 3/4 cup of sugar and there was too much cream cheese mixture, so I'm not sure if the cream cheese mixture made it gooey or the fact I didn't cook it long enough? I will try this again and repost.

These disapear in about 30 seconds!!! I cut my butter by a little less then half and I think it works better. I also add about 2 tsp of lemon juice...I think it gives it a little more refreshing taste and helps cut back a little on the sweetness for those who don't like super sweet. Wow your friends and family with this super easy and super great recipe!

While scanning for another recipe I found this one.  Yum!  Had to try it.  I made one modification: I spread a few tablespoons of apricot jam on top of the cream cheese mixture.  Great flavor.  I will be making this again.

We don't have refrigerated crescent roll dough here so I used puff pastry.  These were very good, next time I will omit the marg topping as I don't think it really adds to the slice, I will just use lots of cinnamon.  Many thanks to the submitter for an easy and delish recipe

Have made this several times now, just forget to rate it! The kids adore it, did not change a thing, they like it better after it has been in the fridge for a day or so! Makes for quick breakfast or snack in a pinch! Delicious!

I have to say the recipe is super easy to make.  I did cut the butter down to a little over 1/2 a stick.  I also used splenda in with the cream cheese mixture opposed to sugar and reduced fat crescent rolls.  I wasn't that impressed with the taste, but my husband said it wasn't bad.  So it went to the neighborhood cookout.  People loved it and raved about it.  My plan was to trash it so I was quite suprised.

Very yummy. I used splenda instead of sugar. I don't know how some people halved the cream cheese, I used the full amount and don't think they would have turned out without it.

These were good. I used 1 1/3 boxes of cream cheese which was perfect, but I should have cut the amount of sugar also! I did cut the amount of butter in half which was PLENTY!

Very good and very easy! I was originally going to follow the recipe exactly but I realized when putting it together that the cream cheese mixture is way too much. Next time I will only use 8oz of cream cheese..and like other suggested, I will cut down on the butter.

I think these are really good.  Next time I'll use less butter, though.  And my husband thought they'd be better with fruit or chocolate, so I might add a layer of preserves or mini chocolate chips.  Definitely let them chill before cutting and eating.

These were good. They remind me of the butter braids that my nephew sells every fall for a school fundraiser.  I'd have these for breakfast with fresh berries instead of for dessert.

These were very good, I had to half the recipe because I only had 1 can of crescant rolls, but they were the "big & flaky" kind so they rose up pretty well.  I ran out of cinnamon, so that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.  I want to try it next time with ALL the ingredients.

Mmmm, these are tasty!  I halved the cream cheese filling mixture, as it sounded like to much for me.  I was right, it was plenty of cream cheese, halved.  These taste just like the Cinnamon Cream Roll-Ups from this site, except the roll-ups get much crispier.  I drizzled chocolate syrup on top of my serving of cream cheese square, it reminds me of a desert that we used to get at a Mexican restaurant in town!

i followed the recipe exactly and these squares were very good.  nice flavor and very simple to make. next time i will use the low fat cresents and use half the butter. Also i will decrease the cinnamon and sugar as i had difficulty telling when the squares were done as the top was already brown from the cinnamon. I may have overcooked them just a tad but they were still very tasty

So good.  I decreased the melted butter by half and still had plenty to cover the entire surface of pan.  I also didn't use all of the cinnamon sugar mixture and didn't think it lost anything.  We preferred eating these cold instead of right out of the oven.

These are certainly easy and tasty but they will never replace Chantal's New York Cheesecake. I would make these again but not as a substitute for cheesecake.

Ok...my family is inhaling these...I only made half of this recipe and used an 11X7 glass pan (all I had)....I didnt have an 8X8 like others suggested. I made these for breakfast this morning and it was a success. The only thing I did different was to use reduced fat crescent rolls and reduced fat cream cheese. I also just brushed some melted butter on the top layer instead of using the whole 1/4 c. Baked up beautifully. Will definately make again. My daughter said they tasted like cheese cake!

absolutely wonderful!  I used vanilla sugar instead of cinnamon on top.  I also added lemon juice and lemon zest to the cream cheese mix.  My only complaint was that they got a little mushy the next day after being in the fridge.  I will not cover so tightly next time!

I added lemon zest like other reviews suggested.  Without that, this would have been quite bland!  Of course it was easy, but also VERY sticky.  I would make this again, but I would add some fruit or something to spice it up.

Extremely easy!  A bit rich. Don't know if we like better warm out of the oven or out of fridge next day!  Don't know if the taste was worth ALL of those calories!!!

These were delicious!!  I used a little less butter and I preferred using the vanilla extract over the almond as one reviewer suggested.

Delish!  I used reduced fat crescent rolls and low fat cream cheese.  They were good.  Next time I make them, I'm using full fat everything, and I think they'll taste even better.  I used a layer of jam on top of the cream cheese.  Yummm.

These will tantalize your taste buds! I added walnuts on top of the cream cheese/sugar mixture. Easy to cut and serve after sitting overnight in the fridge. Better than cheesecake in my opinion.

Well I didn't have a proper pan to bake these in, so I turned the whole thing into a loaf of sorts by pinching all the edges together and baked it on a cookie sheet. It worked. I think my brother ate half of it on his own. He loves cheese cake, so he couldn't keep his hands off these.

Wonderful recipe.  Good as a breakfast pastry or dessert!  However, I used a great deal less of sugar and margarine.

Not that pretty, but so easy and delicious! I brought them to a party and the host liked it so much she hid some so she could have it the next day with coffee! I think it called for a little too much sugar in the filling and topping so I think I'll reduce it a little next time. I think I will experiment with adding a little drained crushed pineapple to the filling next time too - just because I love cream cheese and pineapple together. Oh I forgot to mention I used butter instead of margarine

I made this recipe with a few alterations on New Years Eve. It was such a Hit!  Everyone loved it.  I added 1 egg...mixed the yolk only with the cream cheese mixture and used the white to brush on the top of the 2nd layer of crescent rolls instead of butter..I sprinkle with sugar only then added a can of cherry pie filling on top and baked on 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  YUM YUM!

I added a little bit of lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture. Turned out pretty good flavor-wise, but I thought they seemed like junk food... no offense! They just had that quality.

This was the first time making these. I felt I must try them out after seeing how easy the recipe was and all the fantastic reviews it's received. And for the most part I do agree, they were good! I took them to a dinner at some friends' house...we all thought they were much better cooled than warm. By the end of the night, I took home an empty pan.

Easy like you wouldn't believe.  Because it's so fool proof, I had this as my "gift" wrapped around baking spoons at my bridal shower.  You really have to work hard at messing it up.  It's pretty versatile also - I used almond extract with the vanilla.  It's awesome like it's on there, but for the recipe-fearful, it's easy to snazz this up with different extracts and extra cinnamon sugar, etc.  Thanks for the super easy recipe!

I took a few of the suggestions by adding an egg and halving the sugar.  My husband and a few coworkers I gave pieces to LOVED it!  The best thing was that I used cheap store brand crescent rolls and it still tasted great! Thank you for a great recipe!

(Oh, and they were originally meant as a "going away" present for a friend of mine who was moving, but my husband dug in and had half eaten before I could stop him!!  After that I caved, ate some myself, and brought it to work on my day off to pass around while it was still warm.  They taste better cold, but they are still delicious when warm.)

HOLY COW!!!! I made these the night before, hoping I could wait overnight but I couldn't! They smelled too good. I let them cool for about 30 minutes before I tasted a small piece, big mistake. Soooo good! I did manage to save half of the pan for breakfast, great the next day too!!! I cannot wait to make these again!

Quick and easy recipe.  Followed the advice of others to add an egg and reduce sugar.  I forgot to add the butter in, but the buttery flavor of the cresant rolls made up the flavor. I will make it again with filling inside!

I made these late last night after everyone was asleep and they were so good I have to make them again.  My family never saw them.  I ate so many last night it was embarrassing so I cut the remaining squares and hid them in the fridge. Is there a 12-step program for people who can't stop eating these?

OMG!  It doesn't get much better than cream cheese, cinnamon sugar, and butter (use real butter).  WONDERFUL...they were gone in no time:-)

These were awesome.  I took them to a party and everyone devoured them.  Unfortunately, I was running late and had to serve them right out of the oven, but I'm am sure they would've been even better chilled.  I will def be making these again and again!!

I generally don't really like the taste of the crescent dough stuff very much, which is what kept me from giving it 5 stars, but your recipe made it exceptionally tolerable. I put fresh blueberries in mine. I love cream cheese desserts!! Thank you!

Excellent, will make again. I used puff pastry that I had in the freezer but will try it with crescent roll next time. I used light cream cheese, reduced sugar to 3/4c-due to reviews saying too sweet. I also halved the melted butter(didnt have margarine). left out the cinnamon. Perfect, everybody loved them. Nothing pretty, but a good family dessert.

So easy it's shameful.....so delicious it's shameful.  Very versatile, you can add fruit or drizzle with chocolate sauce when cooled.  I took advice from other reviewers and reduced cream cheese to 1 package, used powdered sugar, and definitely only 1/4 cup of margarine.  EVERYONE loved these and are anxiously awaiting another batch.  Thank you for a great easy recipe.

These were good and very easy to make.  We followed the suggestion of the other reviewers and cut the margarine in half.  Will make again.

A big hit at my girls party!  I had a request for the recipe (the ultimate compliment in my book).  I was almost embarrased at how easy they are!  I will definitely make again when I'm in need of a quick/easy dessert.

If you like cream cheese you will LOVE this one. If you don't really care for it you will probably think this is just soso.

This was so easy and absolutely fantastic.  Didn't change a thing and everyone loved it.  May try adding peaches on top of the cream cheese filling next time though.  Very rich!

I haven't made this exact recipe but one very similar.  My recipe doesn't call for cinnamon mixed with the sugar you sprinkle on but they are so very good. They are really good when they are still a little warm.

This wasn't as good as I was hoping after reading all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and thought that the cinnamon sugar topping was too overpowering.  I think it would be better with a glaze on top instead of the cinnamon.  I doubt I'll make this again.

WOW!!!!  These are incredible (to eat & incredibly easy to make).  Our family prefers them chilled to warm out of the oven, but they aren't bad either way, to be honest!  Red. fat cream cheese works well and I cut the butter to 5 or 6 Tbsp.  1/2 cup (8 Tbsp.) just seemed like too much.  No difference at all with less butter, though.  We had them at a family member's house on a Saturday & by Monday, 2 of us had already made at least one tray of them & gobbled them up.  Yum-O!!!

These were sooo easy to make, and soooo incredibly good. I took them to a party lasst night, and found myself hopeing no one else would like them so I could take the leftovers home with me. No such luck, they were the only dessert that was gobbled up. Guess I will have to make another to satisfy my craving. Would rate this one 10 stars if I could!!!

We had this for breakfast in Sunday School.  The whole classroom wing of the church smelled incredible.  We had people everwhere sticking heads in to see what smelled so good.  The smell, however, was nothing compaired to the actual taste.  Wonderful!  No one will believe you when you tell them they are made from Crescent Rolls and Cream Cheese!  People were fighting over the last serving!  You gotta try this one!
