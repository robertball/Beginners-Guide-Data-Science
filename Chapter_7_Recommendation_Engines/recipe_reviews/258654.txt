This is a really good recipe!  Played with proportions in the sauce a little and added some cilantro we had in the fridge.

Delicious. Used the Ka Me Noodles which you microwave for 90 seconds since that is all my local grocery store carries. Added all kinds of veggies. Huge fan of peanut sauce and this recipe is perfect.

Delicious! You can add pretty much add any veggie and/or chicken to this dish.  I did add some chicken broth to the sauce so it wasn’t so thick.

I messed around with the ratios, per The NY Times “takeout sesame noodles” recipe, but used your idea for soba noodles, cukes, red peppers, and carrots, so thank you!  It is delicious!  And so nutritious, esp with the soba noodles.  :)

Good recipe. Great sauce. Made as written except for using veggie broth instead of canola for cooking vegetables. I also added some additional  veggies that I wanted to use up. Next time I will do the same with only change reducing noodles to 8 oz. only. Was just too much for us to eat.
