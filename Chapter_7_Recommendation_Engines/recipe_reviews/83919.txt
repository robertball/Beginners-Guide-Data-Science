I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  This is the only Cream of Broccoli soup I could find that doesn't list chicken broth or chicken boullion in the ingredients (I didn't have either).  Great flavor and texture and I will make this again.

This soup is superb.   Used skim milk and opted to saute the onion til transparent for sweetness.  I Love this soup.  My new favorite.  Really do not measure anything, just kind of add and mix as i go.  Once in a bowl, add a bit of black pepper and sprinkle with grated parmesian cheese.   MMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMM Good!!!!!!!  Have made it 3 times in like 2 weeks.  Delish!!!  Brenda

This was great.  I was tired of all of the Cream of Broccoli recipes making you cook the stuff first and then put it in the blender, that was always a mess.  This one came out great!!!  I added chicken broth instead of the water to the milk and it gave it extra flavor.  Thanks!!

This soup was very good, and quick and easy to make!  I gave it 4 stars though because i changed it a little bit.  I used frozen broccoli and I used 3 cups instead of one.  It turned out nice and thick!  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is a keeper. Made it twice, with 2nd time coming out much better after some changes were made. 1st and 2nd time, I used the Salad Shooter with wide blade to chop broccoli, 1st time: I used 2 tsp salt (too salty for us), so cut back to 1 tsp. I served it right after making and added shredded Cheddar cheese (it took away the broccoli taste, which we love). 2nd time: I used the boiled water from cooking broccoli to make the sauce, using all-purpose flour (last time I used Wondra, a gravy flour). After making in large saucepan, I poured the soup into top pan for double boiler and let it sit covered 1 hour before serving. To warm it, I put fresh water in lower double boiler pan to prevent scorching. Soup was very creamy and tastier. By the way, I used 2 cups of broccoli instead of 1. Thanks for sharing with us.

I loved it - I left out the onions, added black pepper, and left the broccoli in large chunks. My children LOVED it, I will make it again!

Simple and Delicious. I saut√©ed diced onion with the butter before adding flour and left out the grated onion at the end. I did not add any salt at the end, either. I thought it was flavorful enough without.

I didn't know where to start making a cream of broccoli soup -- so I'm glad I had this as a guideline (I had a lot more broccoli to use up).

I gave this recipe a four because it doesn't make alot.  Perfect for 2-3 people lunch.  Kids liked it and really easy to make with small bit of broc.  I did use the 3 cups of water that I boiled the broccoli in for the "water".  It boiled down to about 2 cups and that little bit extra from the 1 cup called for made for the perfect consistancy.  Will make again for a quick homemade lunch. Don't forget to add salt and pepper before serving for the extra seasoning this soup does need.

This recipe was both simple and tasty.  I almost got my boys to eat broccoli and probably would have, had I mashed the broccoli a little more.  I did add garlic salt, season salt and a touch of chicken soup base for an added touch of flavor and garnished with croutons which was a big hit.

I doubled up all ingerdients to make a nice-sized pot of soup. I also used my water from boiling the broccoli as the soup base and added some chicken soup base to the water. I used 10% cream instead of condensed milk and it turned out excellent. thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was suprisingly good!  I didn't try this for the longest time because it seemed too simple and basic to be any good.  I added some finely grated parmesan cheese to it at the end - other then than I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Oh, but if you are cooking for more than one or two people I would definately double or even triple the recipe - does not make very much.

This was a tasteless soup.  I had to add cheese to thicken it up, and then the soup broke.  Tasted better, but looked awful!!

3 stars for flavor and FIVE for creaminess!!!  I added a head of broccoli, 1/2 onion, cheese, cornstarch and kept the 3 c. of water in in the beginning.  I had to add quite a bit of salt to pep up the flavor, but man was the creaminess good!!
ATTEMPT 2: tripled broccoli, added 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the extra cup water, a little cornstarch, 2 Chicken Boullions and cheddar.  This was almost there!  Next time I will add more boullion cubes and I think the creaminess & flavor will be perfected!

I would give more stars if I could.  I have been using this for years as my cream soup base for everything, as our boys are allergic to milk. A few changes: I reserve a cup of the salted water (from boiling the broccoli) to be used later in the recipe and omit the 1 1/2 tsp of salt.  I also used 3/4 cups of soy milk instead of the evaporated milk.  I often freeze cups of the leftover water to be used later for quick soup bases when I don't use broccoli.

This is a really good soup.  I could only find a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk, so I made up the rest with heavy cream.  I substituted 1% milk for the water (that's all we drink), and added a little pepper at the end. It turned out thick and creamy and tased great.  Will definitely make again

Delicious, we ate 5/6 of the servings, just the two of us. My hubby says he will be wanting this one again. I don't have a grater, so I opted for a seasoning that included onion. It also had red pepper flakes in it, so it was a little spicy as well. MMMMMM!

This is a good bowl of soup!  I didn't have cheese but had lots of evaporated milk so this recipe really fit the bill!  I sauteed the flour in margarine, reconstituted some dried minced onion in that and added 2 bullion cubes to the water, which I reduced by half.  I also used just one 12-ounce can of evaporated milk.  Fabulous!

Yummy! To make it even easier I used a bag of steam fresh microwave broccoli. I used chicken broth instead of water and omitted the onion. Seasoned to taste w/ s&p and it was perfect! Served w/ some grilled cheese for a 10 min dinner!

I think the condensed milk makes this recipe too sweet.  I added some chili pepper in order to save it, but think regular cream will work better.

I was disappointed because the soup really lacked flavor. It smelled good, but that was it. Next time i'm going to try a different recipe.

Cooked the onions first put them in blender with cooked broccoli Of some of its water.  Melted butter in pan a added cornstarch then broccoli water and Some lactose free milk with salt and pepper.   Very nice, easy and fast.  May add crated cheese of top.

yum, what a great recipe!!   my evaporated milk was  expired, so I used 2% milk. I added a finely chopped celery stalk to it and fresh onion instead of dried.   I also doubled the Broccoli because I love broccoli, and added two slices of American cheese at the end. What a perfect broccoli soup!

I gave it 4 stars since I made minor changes per previous reviews.  I used the water from the broccoli,2 1/2 cups of broccoli, 2 cans of evaporated milk (12oz ea)added some half & half and doubled the flour. Took this to a fund-raising event and brought home 1 bowl.  This got lots of compliments and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasteless. Add some cheese to it to spice it up.

Loved it!  One of the few recipes I could find that doesn't use cheese.  Excellent just the way it is.  Husband added pepper.
