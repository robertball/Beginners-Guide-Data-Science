We modified the interior meat to Sweet Italian sausage and ground chicken breast, left out the cheese and bacon crumbles on the interior.  Baked, tented for 2 hour at 400.  It fed 6 adults and everybody took some home.  It was good, but I wished for crispier bacon.

Thanks for this recipe! My smoker was a little slower than expected, and we did broil the roll to crisp up the bacon.

I made a few changes as well...
I only used one package of bacon (16 strips) which I used to make a weave of seven by seven strips, with two  extra to help seal the ends.
I did not use extra bacon in the interior, nor the barbeque sauce or rub.
A mixture of half sweet italian and half hot italian sausage added plenty of flavour. (a total of one pound/ 500 grams)
I also added pre-cooked small potatoes in the centre.

Add the Hickory smoke, and viola, a fantastic meal accompanied by corn-on-the-cob and ceasar salad!

Thanks for the inspiration!

We used hot and sweet italian sausage recipes from allrecipe. Slow backed for 90 minutes at 250° and then another 90 minutes at 350°. I suggest not mixing the inside ingredients and placing inside the roll because too much falls out. Follow the instructions instead. Used remaining BBQ sauce immediately before cooking and it gave it a candy-like glaze.   It turned out beautiful and delicious. Everyone loved it.  Sadly no leftovers.

Wow this was great!  I made a few changes but not enough to really throw off the recipe.  I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground pork sausage, no garlic and no spice rub.  The child and I aren't spice nuts.  In the end, Dad said "More BBQ sauce!" I had added 1/2 cup to the meat mix, maybe more next time.  Also, I baked mine in the oven at 350 for 2 hours and 45 minutes on a roasting rack, serious drippings!!  Use a meat thermometer to get 165 degrees. I would definitely do this again. Serious meat lovers meal.

Great recipe.  Full of flavor and texture.  However, I wouldn't suggest making this everyday.  Your doctor might have something to say about your vitals.  But all-in-all, it's a great dish.  Would recommend.

It was a good recipe, but it took way to long for me to want to make again.
