Yummy!

Since there is just one of me, I don't often have fresh herbs in the house, so I made this with dried. It was still fantastic! Loved it. Put in a lot more celery for crunch, otherwise just the same. It will be a favorite.

Really enjoyed this base recipe!   As done by other reviewers, I used Mediterranean-flavored feta cheese and added roasted tomatoes.   I also left out the mint by preference and had to use dried herbs since I didn't have fresh on hand.   I'll definitely be making this again, and will probably add some pitted kalamata olives next time for variation.  

Thanks so much for sharing!

I make this often. It's a staple in my house. I use Kale instead of parsley. I skip the spices listed and add cumin and paprika instead. I've also added kalamata olives at times.
