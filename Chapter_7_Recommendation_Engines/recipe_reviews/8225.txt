This was better and moister than one I made from Food Network. I actually baked them in 12oz glass rootbeer mugs and made a simple frosting from Dream Whip and 1/2 c. rootbeer. For decoration I stuck a straw in. I will make this again.

I made cupcakes with this recipe using Milwaukee's own Sprecher root beer and was thrilled with them right up until I took the first bite. In my judgement they are in flavor and crumb more like a basic muffin (the non-cake type). Not moist enough for my liking nor are they sweet enough. Their saving grace is the frosting which is to-die-for good but even then I tinkered with the recipe because it wouldn't have worked for me as written. Since I piped the frosting and needed it to be stiffer I used a little more powdered sugar than called for and considerably less root beer. At least this awesome frosting picked up the slack for the lifeless cupcakes. They were pretty no doubt about it with their swirls of delicately caramel-colored frosting and bits of crushed root beer barrels I sprinkled them with as garnish but being pretty isn't enough. I am still looking to make a great root beer cake so if I was to use this recipe again I'd probably add another egg maybe even two and another 1/2 cup sugar.

this was good I couldn't find the root beer extract so i just put in more root beer. I used canned vanilla icing w/root beer mixed in which turned out very good as well

My kids love this. My friends love this. I have made it 3 times this month! I made it as cupcakes twice and they freeze beautifully with frosting.

This is a super cake both in taste and presentation. I added an additional half recipe to the cake and baked in three round 6" cake pans. My own home made vanilla icing (1 cup butter 1 cup shortening 3 egg whites 1 1/2 tsp. of clear vanilla and 3 cups powdered sugar) went between the layers and on the top for the froth. I used Pillsbury breadstick twisted shaped and baked for handle and inserted with toothpicks. My new favorite cake.

Fantastic. I made this with 6" round cake pans and put ice cream in the middle for a root beer float cake. Made 1 batch icing as suggested to ice the sides of the cake and another batch substituting vanilla for root beer concentrate used as the froth for the root beer on the cake. Added a fondant handle (wrapped around an 8" lollipop stick for support) to make a root beer mug shaped cake. Really cute and hubby loved the fuss for his birthday.

I made this cake quite some time ago and forgot to review it. I followed the recipe exactly and I really loved this cake. DH didn't like it as much as I did he didn't feel that cake should taste like root beer but what does he know. This is a great dessert to take to a potluck. Thanks for the recipe Trish.

A very moist cake- followed the recipe this time. It probably needed more rootbeer extract next time to boost the flavor.

pretty good but was missing something to give it more root beer flavor without getting bitter. If you're wanting a very subtle root beer flavor this recipe is perfect as written.

It was very good!! I used root beer instead of root beer extract. I used IBC root beer. It was a little dry. Maybe add milk?? The top was very hard when I bit into it. But the rest was okay. It has a distinct root beer flavour. Also maybe less baking powder. One tablespoon?! I think that’s what made it dry. I don’t know because I have medium experience in baking. I used vanilla buttercream frosting (home made) and added around 5tbsp root beer. I baked mine in a 9x13 pan for 30 mins. I also poked lots of holes in it before putting on the buttercream.

Sorry - but I really want to make this cake but I looked everywhere in my small-town grocery store and they don't sell root beer extract what would be an equal substitute in root beer without changing the consistency of the cake?
