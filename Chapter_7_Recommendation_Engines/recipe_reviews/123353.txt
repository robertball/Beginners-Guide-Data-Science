I used this recipe to make three large pizzas for a family gathering.  They were a hit.  I will next time use olive oil instead of shortening.  The shortening as it cooled formed clumps on the top of the liquid.

This was quite good. I found the soup mix, hot water and shortening did not mix together very well but once added into the dough it still came together somehow. I think it would taste really good with some dill added to it. Makes a good BLT sandwich.

this is really good bread...tho i used olive oil instead of shortening and halved the recipe so i could do it in the bread machine...it turned out great...nice and lite and fluffy ... next time i think i might just do the dough thingy and bake in the oven...will forsure make it again...made a great cold beef roast sandwich...thanks for sharing the recipe...p.s. the onion flavour wasn't overpowering...it was just tasty...i think it would go great with a pasta dish...

Absolutely wonderful bread. I served it up with a soup and my guests ranted and raved over it.
