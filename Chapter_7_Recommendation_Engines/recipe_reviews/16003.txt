Made this last week, and I have to tell you I loved it!  I didn't have carrots, and used one large can of whole tomatoes, chopped up, and added potatoes and pasta.  I chopped up the onions and sauteed them with the hamburger meat.  If my kids don't notice them, they eat them!  I just made little tiny hamburgers to use tonight in the soup -- just like the Chunky soup!!  Great recipe!

This was really good and really easy. It was snowing like crazy so I was happy to find that I had almost all the ingredients in the house. I left out the celery but doubt that made any difference at all. I do have to say it was a bit greasy so next time I think I'll try ground turkey.I would also suggest,especially if you plan on leftovers, more broth as the macaroni & rice really suck up the fluid. I like recipes like this because they really give you a lot of room to play. Either way this was a great snowy day dinner!

This recipe was great. My family loved it and my son who is super picky had seconds. Instead of water I used beef broth. I also added 1/2 chopped onion and 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the hamburger as I was cooking it. I added a few carrots also. So yummy.  I served it with a piece of bread and butter very good. Thank you

Good base recipe. I used beef broth instead of water and added some seasonings to taste.
