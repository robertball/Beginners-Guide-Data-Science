This is a nice recipe. After reading previous reviews about the cake's heavy texture, I beat my eggs for about 4 minutes until they were thickened, and added 1 tsp. baking powder in addition to the soda; the resulting texture was fluffy and very moist. I reduced the sugar a bit, but next time I'll use the full amount. I would recommend adding a teaspoon of vanilla, and also a tablespoon or two of lemon juice to brighten up the pineapple flavor. A keeper recipe!

This is a good home-made cake, but the original recipe is a little odd. It needs some adjustments, I read all the reviews and follow some sugestions which help me on the good results. It come out delicious! I brought this cake to a family reunion and everyone loves it. In my opinion it just needs 1 cup of sugar,and 1/2 cup of oil. I added 1tsp. of baking powder, 1 tblsp of lemon juice, and 1tsp. of vanilla extract. It only need 20 minutes to cook in the oven, not 45 minutes. I omited the nuts. In the iceing I only put 1/2 of cup of confectioners sugar and it was perfectly sweet. I did this changes and we had an absolutely delicious cake.

This pineapple cake is amazing! I used 1/2 cup of less of the sugar and I had a fresh pineapple that I had to use up so I just added 1/2 cup of milk to make up for the canned liquid! I didnt even frost it is that good! Frosting would make it even extra amazing! Very moist and very good flavour! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

VERY GOOD! it was so moist and sweet although i did change some things! i used half the sugar and it was still very sweet! i used brown sugar, too. i didn't have any eggs so i just put in some yogurt and surprisingly turned out great! i used about 1/4 cup of oil insttead of 3/4 cup. i added some vanilla, too! i put in a little soy milk, too. DELICIOUS! i took it out of the oven at the right time but it wasn't all the way cooked. it was mushy a little in the middle but it made it more moist and it was fabulous! i didn't have cream cheese so i just glazed some cool whip over it! it was great and sweet and moist and i added some pineapple on top for decoration! YUM! :)

Instead of frosting, I sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top - very heavy - and add plenty of ground ginger and cinnamon in cake - soak raisins in with the pineapple & juice - lots of pecans - this is turning in to "Austin Cake"!!!

Make this very tasty cake the day before you plan to serve it to let the flavor develop. Next time I'll reduce the butter in the icing so it will not be sooo soft. Try it. You'll like it !

I used this cake as a base for pina colada cupcakes. Based on other reviews I added 1 tsp baking powder. I left out the nuts, and I drained the pineapple then only added half of the juice because I wanted to use a rum glaze so I didn't want the cake to be too wet. It turned out fantastic - I actually liked the cupcakes better without the coconut frosting I made; they were very moist and pineapple-y!

I used fresh pineapple....no nuts...I personally did not like this and 3 of our 4 kids didn't either.  Our friends thought it was great so I gave them the rest to take home.  It was very wet...and the flavor was odd...

This was the perfect cake for what I was looking for. I made this cake with fresh pineapple and added 1/3 cup of milk  and halved the sugar which was suggested by another reviewer. Came out excellent!  I would also recommend serving it as pineapple bars opposed to cake since it is very thick and moist.

I used 1 1/2 cups sugar and only 1/2 cup oil. Instead of frosting it I toasted about 1 1/2 cups of coconut and stirred it into the cake batter. Very moist and delicious!

I did not have any nuts so made it without it.  I did not have crushed pineapple so I used tidbits which was a smaller can but the cake turned out great.  I had to cook it a little longer than indicated.  I added cocunut to the top of the icing.  It was yummie!

I made this for a birthday treat at work.  Everyone really liked it and I was asked for the recipe.  Very easy to make and the frosting was yummy too.  I usually put margarine in my frosting, but butter is just so much better.  It's a heavy cake, but I like that texture.  You can tell it's home made vs. a box cake.

I make this recipe all the time - it's one of my favorites.     It's so easy and feeds a large crowd.   It is dense, moist, and sweet.   I like to add 1/2 cup of coconut and frost the cake while it's still warm.    Yum!

This cake was delicious!  I made some minor changes, such as reducing the sugar to 1 & 3/4 cups, 1/2 cup oil and a splash of vanilla.  Most importantly, I replaced the nuts with about 1 & 1/2 cups coconut, making it more of a hummingbird cake.  I baked it for about 30 minutes, until golden brown, then frosted it with the recommended frosting, but halved the butter and cream cheese and added 3/4 cup coconut.  I highly recommend this cake!  It will be great in the summer too!

I rated this 4 as written but a 5 after doing some adjustments...I made as written then I wanted like a Mock Upsidedown Pineapple cake, so I melted 4 tbls butter with a 1/4 of brown sugar until dissolved then poked holes in the cake and spread over the top of cake, cooled then topped with halved Marichino cherries, then topped with Pineapple Cream Cheese Frosting..was a big hit with the Hubby, since he LOVES pineapple upside down cake. Kids loved it too!

This cake was very good.  It wasn't quite as 'wet' as I was expecting, but nice and moist.  I only made 1/2 the icing and that was really enough to cover the top of the cake (still in the pan) evenly with a nice coating to lend a sweet tangy contrast to the cake.  I liked that I didn't have to drag out my mixer to make a delicious cake. I would use this recipe again.

Phenomenal cake!  Every week I bring a cake to an outdoor concert and I ask for suggestions for the following week.  Someone said they would love something pineapple...so I looked and found this one.  Followed the directions exactly as written, but added some cherry extract and juice to the icing.  Decorated it with halved cherries.  Rave reviews all around!

Made this cake tonight and it turned out great.  I used half the sugar because I figured the pineapple juice would more than make up for it.  I also had to use one less egg than was called for (looked in the carton and one was broken) and it turned out just fine. All I had on hand was chunk pineapple which made it a little difficult  to test doneness  but you can test it with your fingers to check for spring back.  As other users have mentioned it is good without the frosting, which I didn't make, and is plenty sweet on its own.  All in all a great cake.

Very good cake.  I did cut back on the sugar by half and did not put on the icing.  Instead, I used a scoop of the "Cool Whipped Frosting" (on this site) on each piece.

This cake was great! I made it for father's day and it was a huge hit. my sister in law took one bite and asked me to make it for her birthday.  I did as others recommended and added one teaspoon of baking powder, and instead of oil, I used melted earth balance spread (for my lactose free family members) and left out the nuts. I also divided into two 9" round pans and did a pineapple filling with just crushed unsweetened pineapple and some cornstarch cooked for about 8-10min. (20oz can of pineapple and 2Tbsp cornstarch) It was a great addition that sort of melted into the cake and kept it moist. I didn't add sugar so I think that may have helped with the sweetness. I was being lazy and so I used canned white frosting and added 1tsp of coconut extract. Topped the whole cake with toasted coconut. Perfect! I just made this a second time and the only change I made was lining my cake pans with parchment and spraying them with nonstick spray. Came out beautifully.

I made the cake exactly as stated except I only had brown sugar on hand. It was delicious anyway! For the frosting, I wanted to get a little crazy, so I added two tablespoons of sweet Thai chili sauce. It was amazing with just a hit of heat and plenty of sweetness to balance it out.

I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the cake itself. My Mom said it was the best cake she has ever had, she's sweet. I'd have to say I can't remember enjoying a cake as much since the last time I made this cake.

This was according to my Husband and his family an amazing cake my brother in-law had 3 pieces and he is not a lover of fruit in his cake! My self  and my two little ones also loved it! I did however make some changes i did add 1tsp of baking power some vanilla and some lemon juice following others suggestions. I did also mix all dry ingredients together then added the wet. In the icing i also added a splash of lemon juice and a pinch of salt! I will definitely be making this again!??

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I followed "campagnes" recommendations and it was perfect! My only issue would be that this cake really stuck to the pan... I mean it really got stuck I almost lost the cake! I did use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, so maybe that's why? But anyway, I had to use a spatula to loosen the cake. So be sure to really grease your pan! Other than that it was amazing! Will make again!

My husband is beside himself with this cake.  He ate half of it while it was still warm.  I have never made anything for him in 12 years that has gotten this reaction.  I used the frosting from Lick Your Lips Cake.

I wasn't that impressed with this cake.  I added a cup of coconut to give it a more tropical taste, but all I could tast was the sweetness of the cake.  It had very little of the pineapple taste that I had hoped for.  The icing turned out very runny too.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

Delicious cake, great consistency.  Followed Jovita's advice in her review and changed the amount of sugar and made her additions.  Made it as cupcakes - baked at 350 for 18 minutes.  Didn't rise much, but that's ok.  Moist and delicious.  Frosted with Coconut Cream Cheese frosting from this site so they ended up being pina colada cupcakes.   Awesome recipe - thanks!!!
