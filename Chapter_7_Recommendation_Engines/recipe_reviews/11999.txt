Very easy, took about 40 minutes.  Definately use cumin when cooking the turkey, maybe even some of the chili powder.  I added some red pepper flakes, we like it hot, and could have used more.  Also consider using a jalepano.  If you double the turkey, be sure to add more onion, tomato sauce (or one 6oz can tomato paste with a full can of water,) bbq sauce, corn and green bell pepper.  I used whole wheat pasta and couldn't even tell.  It was excellent!  My fiance had 3 servings, and there was leftovers!

I made the recipe exactly as the instructions called for and it was wonderful.  We have lots left over so it can easily be cut down.  I was surprised at how well the BBQ sauce added flavor with the chili powder.  And for WW people, it's only 6 points a serving and it's healthy!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I did make a few changes like added kidney beans and a can of tomatoe paste and a can of water. And i added some red pepper for some fire. And i did not include the corn or the green pepper. Overall it was a very thick, hearty, and very tastey meal!

WHAT AN AWESOME RECIPE! I thought it was easy to prepare and I'd like to share my tips. I cooked the pasta the night before and defrosted a 10 oz package of corn to save time. In the morning I browned the turkey with onion, minced garlic and garlic powder to give it more flavor. I added cumin for smokiness and crushed red pepper flakes for a little kick. I saved about a cup of the starchy pasta water to bind the sauce together instead of using bland tomato sauce. I used a can of diced tomatoes with oregano, garlic and basil for more flavor. I had a bag of frozen peppers and onions in the fridge so I put them in the processor to chop them and added a half cup of them to the hot tub. It turned out really tasty and really fast, in less than 20 minutes, I was done. So figure friendly and lower in fat, sodium and cholesterol than old school hamburger helper. Thanks Dimple2000 for the recipe.

We didn't care too much for this. The BBQ flavor overwhelms everything else, so I didn't really matter that I added cumin, crushed red pepper, black pepper, and garlic. Served with shredded cheese on top. My boyfriend ate 2 servings, but I think he was just really hungry because he said this was a 2 star recipe. I ate mine with sour cream, which helped cut the BBQ flavor down a bit. Thanks :)

Due to my husband being a picky eater I omitted the onion and used onion power, the green pepper and used a couple pinches of regular black pepper, and tomato sauce and used tomato paste. Still turned out very tasty. You can change out the flavors of barbecue sauce to suit your particular taste. Very versatile and easy recipe:)

I love this. I have been trying to find ways to stretch my grocery budget by mixing pasta or rice with meat and veggies in a big goulash-type way. This is exactly the type of recipe I've wanted. My husband loves saucy things and I love pasta, but neither of us prefers the other. So this was a perfect balance. I didn't have green peppers or enough tomato sauce, so I pureed a can of stewed mexican style tomatoes (which contains peppers) instead. I also added kidney beans. Everything worked out great and it tastes super yummy :) I also doubled the recipe cause I had a feeling we would love it. I'm glad I did!

This was a very tasty dish!  I really enjoyed the BBQ taste!  It's a great twist to traditional tomato sauce dishes.

I really had to spice this up for my family's taste. I added garlic, cumin, and chipolte hot sauce. I also used ground beef. I put shredded cheese and sour cream on the table so they could top it like another person suggested. In the end, this was tasty, and very simple to throw together. My higher rating was based more on how quick you can put dinner on the table.

This recipe was very good.  I used ground beef instead of turkey.  Tabasco sauce helped give it even more of a kick.  You can put sour cream and cheddar cheese on top too.

I wasn't sure how BBQ pasta would be but I wanted to try something a little different but not wildly so nobody would try it. I used a whole can (26 oz) of spaghetti sauce and a full cup of BBQ sauce because I like a saucy pasta sauce. Rainbow rotini, red bell pepper, a pound of ground turkey and some crush red pepper were the other changes I made. We all went back for seconds and I was asked to make it again soon. Def a keeper!

It was a little bland, but still an easy and generally tasty weekday meal. I added shredded cheese to make it a little more exciting.

Way, way, way too much chili powder in this recipe.  My wife couldn't eat it.  All you taste is BBQ sauce and chili powder.

Good change from just plain chili.  Each member of the family added their own touch: one wanted it without pasta but topped with chopped onions, one with beans and stewed tomatoes added and topped with sour cream, and one just as the recipe describes.  This recipe is easy to tailor to individual tastes.

Kind of bland for my tastes.  Leftovers were dry as well, so you might want to add some extra BBQ sauce to the leftovers or eat it all in one sitting.

I made this tonight for my 3 boys ages and they told me I did a good job.  I used rice instead because I had it already made.   Have to say I was very pleased with the taste, my boys told me I did a awesome job...

This was good but to be honest, I made so many changes I feel like it's almost* a new recipe. I added about 3/4 cup salsa, doubled the meat, reduced the BBQ sauce to 1/2 cup, added black beans, and one can tomato paste with one can water. It was flavorful and salsa + BBQ sauce mixes well believe it or not. I feel like if I had made it to the recipe, it would have been too dry. My husband liked it too.

I'm not going to lie - when I first typed in the ingredients I had in my cupboard and this came up, I actually thought it sounded pretty disgusting. But I gave it a whirl since it had bbq sauce in it, and I knew the hubs would probably like that. I was amazed at how delicious it was. I'm not one for too spicy, and I thought the chili powder was just perfect. Will definitely be making this one again.

A good dish for a quick weeknight meal, and it could probably be dressed up for company too.  It was fast to prepare, very easy and definitely tasty.  Based on some of the reviews, I added cumin to the turkey.  I also added a can of Rotel diced tomato with jalapeno.  I used slightly less than 1Tbsp of chili powder since I don't like too much heat, but it still had good flavor and the heat accumulated as you ate more.  It was a good balance for two people who can handle different spice levels.  I think it could be kicked up with some red pepper flakes if some diners wanted more.  Again, not a very fancy dish, but we liked it and will be making it again.

This was great! I made more for leftovers by using 1lb pasta (whole wheat) and 1lb ground turkey. I left all else the same. As a result of making extra pasta it could have used more sauce yet it wasn't too dry. I want to use a can of diced tomatoes next time with the juice instead of the tomato sauce. I added 1tsp cumin but all else according to the recipe. I loved that it was quick and made plenty - my husband likes to take some leftovers with his lunch for variety, and he really enjoyed this very much, and the boys did too. We will definitely be making this regularly!  **UPDATE** I made this last night and didn't realized I was out of regular canned corn, and I had no frozen corn either so I used a can of creamed corn, my DH REALLY loved it all the more making it that way - that's the only thing I did different too, well still adding my can of diced tomatoes as I had mentioned in my first review but that's how we have it all the time now.

I don't usually rate recipes. I just use and enjoy them. But this one was so good I had to review it. My kids, who usually turn thier noses up at something new, loved it. They also usually complain about the spiciness of foods, but tonight it was "this is spicy, but so good!" It was also very fast and easy to make. I used my food processor to chop the onion and green pepper, and put the chili powder, oregano and salt into the BBQ sauce for faster addition. The only thing I think I will do differently is to use frozen instead of canned corn. Otherwise, this recipe is a huge hit in my house and definitely something I will make again and again.

I made this recipe exactly as is, and I found it a bit heavy on the BBQ sauce. I would maybe only do half a cup next time. My husband thought it was all good though!

I thought this was really good.  I used wagon wheel pasta and added a little cumin to the meat mixture.  While I was eating it, I thought the meat mixture alone (no pasta) would be good for a sloppy joe.

This was a great hit with my family. My husband loved the BBQ sauce flavor. I used alittle over a pound of ground turkey. I thought 1/2 pound was not enough meat. The corn was surprisingly good in it too. I might try adding some other vegatables next time. It was an easy way to get the kids to eat them.

Great recipe!  Was iffy about the tomato sauce AND the BBQ sauce, but it was great!  I didn't have chili powder on hand, so I added some Louisiana hot sauce and it was great!  Also added some black beans for added protein and fiber!

Very sweet.  It tastes like you just dumped BBQ sauce on some pasta.  I added an entire can of tomato paste and still way too sweet.  We threw out the leftovers.

This is great stuff! I probably could have gobbled it all down myself the first night (or at least I wanted to), but I made it last for 2 nights. Still, 6 servings made for 2 big dinners. I made it exactly as written, except that my canned corn was a little bigger at 15.25 oz. (Also, I don't know where you and others find 8-oz. packages of pasta, but I've never seen one. So I just weighed out half of a 1-lb. package.) This is a noticeable twist on the "hamburger helper"-type recipe (as I call them) - the use of bbq sauce here adds a lot of flavor. I might quibble that the bbq sauce is a little too strong (depends on which kind you use, of course), and/or a little too much in amount; and that the ground turkey is a little skimpy in amount and flavor compared to ground beef. But overall, I enjoyed this a lot and just might make it again sometime. Thanks!

Yummy!  I used penne pasta because that's what I had and I added 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Used a nice, tangy bbq sauce and it was really delicious.  We topped with monterey jack cheese.

Needed a recipe other than turkey burgers for my ground turkey. This was awesome. Even my 8 year old "picky" eater loved it. Instead of tomato sauce I used diced tomatoes w/Basil, Garlic and Oregano. Also, 1/2t of cayenne pepper instead of chili powder.

This was pretty good. My family really liked it but I think it was missing something. I think it could have had more spice to it.  Maybe more chili powder? I will use this recipe again but I will add more kick to it next time.

Surprisingly good!  Liked the chili flavor with the pasta.  Definitly not chili-topped pasta; the sauce was not chunky, but I liked it that way.

WOW - my family loved this!  I used ground chicken breast and only had one cup of corn (I doubled recipe) so I also added 1 cup cannelini beans.  This was wonderful!  I baked 15 min in oven, topped w/2oz. cheddar cheese.  A keeper!

I was looking for a different pasta dish, rather than the standard tomato- or cream-based ones, so I threw this together one evening hoping for the best.  My husband not only enjoyed it, but he called it a name out of his childhood -- "American Chop Suey". He said his parents used to make something similar to this when he was a kid, and was very happy to revisit this memory.  Thanks!!

Oh yeah! This is good!  I used approximately 2 cups of some cooked turkey instead of the ground turkey.  Also, I used a homemade bbq sauce from a barbeque chicken recipe that I got from this site.  I definitely suggest that anyone try it.  It's delicious! You shouldn't be disappointed!

I made this for dinner last night and it was all right.  Maybe it's the type of BBQ sauce I used, but I thought the sauce came out too sweet.  I was hoping for a more subtel BBQ flavor but the smell was overpowering - my hubby thought we were grilling ribs.  Instead of using pasta we ended up making sloppy joes which turned out nice with some oven baked sweet potatoes.

wow!wow!wow!wow,wow!!!!  Amazingly good.  I was unsure of how bbq would work with pasta but it amazed me so much I sent the recipe off to the girls at work.  It doesn't get any easier especially if you use diced, frozen onions and green peppers!!  Only took as long as the pasta took to cook.  you must try this!  Add some heat like red pepper flakes for perfection!!!

My husband raved that this was the best pasta ever and he's in his 50's! I did make changes hence the 4 star rating. I had to use veggies on hand - frozen baby peas carrots corn mix- and I used a  spicy red pepper tomato sauce. I doubled the meat since that was what I had. But this is a great base recipe you can easily alter to make your own. Thanks for sharing.

Was skeptical but this was pretty darn good. The only thing i changed is that i added red beans and used low sodium ingredients where i was able (high bp and cholesterol; corn, beans and whole  wheat  pasta).  For someone who thinks mild /medium wings are hot, this was on spot for a little zing. May try  adding cheese next time, maybe in the form of a can of cheese soup.

I was skeptical about BBQ sauce in pasta, but the tomato sauce definitely balanced out the taste. I didn't put in onions or green peppers, because of my picky husband, but next time I may do it just for myself.m

ScrumpDiddlyUmptious!  This pasta has everything to make you smack your lips with delight with each bite!  It has sweetness, crunchiness, spicyness, and all around yummyness.  I did use the orange-colored pepper and 1 cup of KC masterpiece BBQ sauce instead of the 3/4 cup called for.  I also used 16oz. of ground turkey instead of only the 8 ounces.  I topped it with a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.   It was just as good the next night for leftovers.  Hard to believe the abundance of flavor in something that was so fast to prepare.  GeorgiaJoan

I really love that this seems like a basic pasta dish but you can really taste the BBQ sauce.  Its easy to add or leave out different veggies if needed too. Very good as leftovers too!

We thought it was very good.  I went heavy on the BBQ sauce and used a can of Rotel since I didn't have the green peppers.  Very much enjoyed our dinner.  Will make again.

My family really enjoyed this easy to prepare supper. I doubled the recipe but added a lot more bbq sauce (a tangy honey sauce).  They gobbled up every bit.  I'll definitely keep this one handy.

I would consider this a healthy, homemade version of hamburger helper. It was easy to make and very kid friendly. Not the most gourmet meal, but much healthier than the preservative filled stuff in a box.

This recipe was different to say the least.  My boyfriend hated it but we saved it by adding some feta cheese.  We ate it for 2 days because it made so much I think it would make more like 8 servings.  I think I won't make this again but if I did I would use about a cup of feta and leave out the corn.

I thought this was really good.  My husband and I differ greatly on BBQ sauce.  I like sweet he likes spicy so I mixed the two and added it in.  It tasted really good.  I will definitely make again.  Very simple recipe.

It tasted good and was very easy to make.  I actually used venison instead of turkey and it was still good.  I thought it could use a little more chili powder to give it more of a kick.

A great way to use ground turkey.  Also, a quick and easy meal!  Everyone in my family likes it, and we have it often.  It's a favorite of my future son-in-law (I just made it for his birthday!)

Well, I've got to say that for us, this was just awful. My husband is willing to eat it, although he says he wouldn't recommend making it again. However, I think that it might be partially my fault - I was using low quality turkey and a BBQ sauce that may not have been the best choice. If it sounds good you should try it, but we definitely won't be making it again.

I thought one Tablespoon of the spices was a type-o, so I only put in 1/2 Tablespoon.  It had just the right amount of spice for me, and I'm not a real spicy person.  I also used macaroni.

Very very good.  I used a full box of Rotini (12oz) and I think that took some away from the flavor.  I'm going to add more sauce tonight.  However despite my mess up it is a very tasty treat.  I added a little black pepper and cayenne to spice it up a little more.  Very easy to boot!

Yum yum yum!!  This was really good!  I thought the BBQ sauce added just the right amount of sweetness!  I did add a little bit of hot sauce, too.  My hubby and I both loved this dish and it was easy!!  We always use ground turkey in place of beef and this recipe definitely compliments the turkey!

This has such a zesty barbeque taste and can be used with so many different pastas!  It was wonderfully quick and easy.  I had to tone it down just a notch for my kids but I even liked it without all the spice!

What a great way to use turkey instead of beef.  The taste is really good.

this is delicious, flavorful, and a cinch to make ... kids of all ages will love it, even the big kids (ie, boyfriend, husband, uncle, etc)!
