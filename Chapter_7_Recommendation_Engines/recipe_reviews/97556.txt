Add a little corn starch to mixture right before it is finished then it will set up nicer. Try a pineapple/papaya juice instead of orange juice. A really good recipe for rhubarb.

Easy and tasty but doesn't really set up on its own--it could just as easily be rhubarb topped with whipped cream.

I made this for an end-of-summer barbeque as the rhubarb was getting a little "long in the tooth". I thought the flavour of the rhubarb was spot-on. I might've over mixed the mixture a little but it still had a moderately chunky texture. I layered it with whipped cream in champagne glasses finishing with a huge dollop of whipped cream. I would've liked it a little more if I had made a "crumble" base and put that as the first layer in the glass just to give it a little different texture and taste. All in all I would make this again!

Judging from Corey's reaction alone (he ate three servings) this dessert is a hit. A good old-fashioned combination of that fleeting jewel of a fruit and sweetened whipped cream. I cooked the rhubarb for 10 minutes and paid close attention to the stirring instructions and it set up perfectly. It does thicken as it cools. Easy basic yummy delish!

Extremely easy to make and turned out amazing!  I did add a bit of cornstarch to help it set.  It was perfect! Will use this one again and again!
