We thought it was a great recipe!  I made some alterations:  we marinated the chicken in soy sauce/garlic/ginger/splenda, I also made extra sauce, adding a bit more hoisin sauce and added some splenda to the recipe to make it a bit more sweet to ward of some of the heat from the spices.  I skipped out on the salt in the recipe...  I found that this recipe was already on the salty side, so I also used low-sodium chicken broth.  This is now a family favorite!  It's also great with sticky rice.

Needs twice the sauce for best flavor and to coat the chicken and broccoli sufficiently.  Add some peanuts or cashews for crunch.    Also good with basmati rice.

This was a very adaptable recipe! We aren't big on really spicy food so I left out the chile paste and cut the crushed red pepper to 1/8 tsp. I could still taste some 'heat' which was just perfect for my family. Didn't have any hoisin sauce so I added 1 tbl brown sugar as others mentioned. It wasn't sweet tasting at all but was delicious.  I think there was a misprint in the recipe on the garlic so I only used 4 cloves. I also added celery, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and slightly steamed carrots.  I also added 8 oz of al dente spaghetti so I increased the chicken stock to 2/3 cup and mixed in 1 tbl of cornstarch to it to thicken the sauce a bit before adding the cooked spaghetti. Just what I was looking for. Loved the ginger in it.

very good recipe.  made a couple of changes.  used pork instead of chicken and white wine instead chicken broth becuase those are what we had.  also i marinated the pork in soy, wine, garli, ginger, and chili sauce.  i think it helped make the meat very tender and flavorful.  also i doubled the sauce ingredients and i wouldn't use the salt and pepper becuase i think the other ingredients cover that aspect of the recipe.  great recipe with veggies served over rice

This was really yummy.  I made a few changes just to up the veggies in it.  I added more broccoli, a yellow pepper, sliced celery and carrots.  I probably tripled the sauce too. I served it over some basmati rice. It was a great healthy dinner.  Thanks Amanda!

This was good and made for a nice dinner served over jasmine rice.  I did improvise a bit by adding some red bell pepper and mushrooms that I needed to use up.  I cooked the red bell pepper and mushrooms and steamed the broccoli early in the afternoon, then just added them at the end to heat them through - less chance of the veggies losing their nice color and overcooking the chicken.  I tripled the sauce, but only added 2 t. of garlic chile paste which was plenty hot for us and we like spicy.  Next time I might thicken the sauce with a little corn starch and add just a bit of brown sugar to sweeten it up.

This was good. I used a chili garlic sauce (found in the Asian section of your grocery store)aproximately 1 tablespoon and used fresh minced ginger approximately 1 tablespoon. I also added a lot more veggies: edamame, baby carrots, bok choy, red pepper and the broccoli. I seasoned my chickend with garlic and season salt and ommitted the reg salt that was called for. This was great but VERY spicy. Next time I will reduce the amount of chili garlic sauce that I use and perhap will add a little sugar. I doubled my sauce and added all of the ingredients (soy, broth, hoisin -- to taste.)

Very good base recipe. I took other reviewers suggestions and marinated the chicken in soy sauce, fresh ginger, garlic and some hoisin sauce for about 1.5 hours. The chicken came out so tender that I think this is key if you have the time. I also didn't think there was enough sauce so I doubled it as well. Didn't have any green onions and forgot the red pepper, but it didn't matter as there was still plenty of flavor. I also tossed in some sliced almonds at the end.

I thought this was great ... I marinated the chicken in a soy sauce, honey and garlic powder mixture overnight.  Really made the chicken tasty and stayed moist.  This is  definitlely spicy, even after cutting back the chili paste/red pepper.  Make sure you taste it after adding a 1/4 of what's called for ... might be just right if you don't like spicy food.   My kids even ate the brocolli they like this so much!  Served over sticky rice and will make again and again!

I made this stir fry tonight for dinner and my whole family loved it - even the kids...but I did change a few things.  I used about 4 cups of veggies (broccoli, carrots and red peppers) and only 2 chicken breast halves which was more than enough meat.  I used about 1/2 cup sliced green onion, a Tbsp of minced ginger and 5 cloves of garlic.  I omitted the chili paste, doubled the remaining sauce ingredients, added 1 Tbsp each of sweet Thai chili sauce, corn starch (to thicken) and honey.  Finally, I added about 1/4 tsp cayenne which gave it just enough heat for the kids.  I cooked the chicken in olive and sesame oils, removed from the pan and then cooked the onion, ginger and garlic. I added in the pre-steamed veggies (except for the peppers) and then chicken and topped it off with sauce.  The end result was absolutely delish!

Tasty and easy to make!  Instead of putting the broccoli in a steamer, I used the steam tray of my rice cooker (because who isn't going to eat this without rice?) and cooked those two at the same time while the chicken was cooking in a separate pot.  Instead of green onions I used a red onion just because that's what I had.  I also added a coarsely chopped red pepper for some extra flavor and texture.  As per another review, I also doubled the sauce.  It cooked up fairly quickly and was a tasty meal.  I plan on making it again.  Thanks!

I took a few hints from reviewers and doubled the amount of sauce ingredients, plus I added about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to balance out the heat. Instead of broccoli, I used snow peas which added another level of sweetness to the sweet/heat balance. I also added sliced scallions, fresh mushrooms, red bell pepper, and a rib of sliced fresh celery. Served it over brown rice. Hubby went back for seconds. This is a keeper. It is delicious.

I've had hoisin sauce in my fridge for months and finally have a reason to use it!  Great recipe...just a little to spicy for me. I added some carrots and snow peas that I had on hand because I didn't have enough broccoli for the recipe. Next time I'll try cutting back on the sambal (chili paste) and upping the sweet factor.

I cut this recipe in half as my hubby is out of town and I only had one chicken breast to use.  That said, I opted to double all 'sauce' ingredients based on other reviews and due to the fact that I was adding lots of veggies!  I steamed both broccoli and carrots and also used yellow and orange peppers for a nice mixture.  I used Sriracha Hot Chile sauce as I did not have paste and also used fresh grated ginger in place of ground (about a tablespoon).  This dish definitely packs more heat than sweet, but I enjoy spice, so found it yummy!  I do not feel either the salt or pepper are needed (left out of mine) and doubling the sauce is a must!  I served over organic red quinoa as I really wanted it over rice, but rice would be fantastic!  Great meal, glad I have some leftovers for lunch!

LOVE this dish.  My kids beg for it & would eat it every week.  The only changes that I made were to add sliced red peppers with the broccoli (I just steam them together) and  I also double the ingredients for the sauce part because my family likes to have a little more sauce for the rice.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I did make a few changes, added red peppers, carrots, and mushrooms as well as about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I tripled the sauce and was very glad I did or there would not have been enough. Cut down the chili paste to about 2 tsp for the whole dish with just a couple of dashes of red pepper and it still packed some heat. A little too spicy for my boyfriend so I will reduce the chili paste even more next time.  My favorite stirfry yet~

Although I have enjoyed many recipes from this website, this is the first time I have been moved to rate one.  This was one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had!  My husband could not wait to try it because the house smelled so good.  It tasted just like it smelled, sweet and spicy with lots of layers of flavor. I will make this again and again! Thanks for such a great recipe!

One of the BEST recipes I've ever made from this site!  Just as good - or even better - than authentic Chinese take-out from a restaurant. I was so impressed! I adjusted the proportions for our family and increased the sauce so there would be enough to serve over Pad Thai rice noodles. Warning! This is spicy!!!!!!  We like spicy, but even I think I'll tame this one a little the next time, so the little ones can tolerate it a little more! I used frozen Asian-style veggies (broccoli, snap peas, mushrooms, baby corn, water chestnuts, carrots), steamed them and added them to the skillet. DELISH!!! A definite keeper!

We enjoyed this easy stir-fry recipe!  As always, I made some changes & additions:  I added carrots, red bell pepper, and red onions to get more veggies in there!  I doubled the liquids since I added more veggies.  I used fresh grated ginger in place of the dried and I would definitely do that again.  In place of the chili paste & crushed red pepper flakes, I used chili garlic sauce - it gives plenty of heat!  Turned out to be a really great spicy stir-fry!  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe, it tasted like I bought it down at the local chinese restaraunt. The only change I think I would make, is less water to get the sauce thicker.

I had high hopes, but this just wasn't for us. It turned out so spicy hot that we couldn't even eat it and there was nothing sweet about it.  The recipe calls for chile "paste."  Since this is an Asian style recipe, I assume it means to use Asian style chile "paste" which is HOT, HOT, HOT!.  The Hoisin sauce I purchased wasn't all that sweet and definitely not sweet enough to overcome the chile paste or the added pepper.  I tried to salvage it by using sweet rice seasoning, honey, and other ingredients, but was unsuccessful.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

This turned out really tasty.  My family enjoyed it including my oldest who hates anything that has broccoli in it had a second helping.  My only change was that I added a splash of sake cooking wine.  Very tasty

Loved this!  I used fresh broccoli and threw it in with everything else.  I also added red bell pepper.  To have a thicker sauce, I didn't use chicken stock.  The flavor was great!

Made a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand and to taste (we really love spice): 1 chicken breast, 2 tbsp hoisin sauce, 1/4 tsp red chilli powder, 1/2 cup vegetable stock made with a buillion cube), 2 green chillies with seeds removed, 1 carrot, 1/2 onion cut in wedges, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 green bell pepper, mushrooms, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp corn starch. I had a lot more vegetables so it made up for not having enough chicken. I marinated the chicken for about an hour with the soy sauce, garlic, ginger and sugar. Stir fry the chicken in oil for a few minutes...ADD THE GREEN ONIONS! This will add an amazing aroma to the chicken. Fry until chicken is cooked, then add hoisin sauce and the veggies that take longer to cook: carrots and bell peppers. Then add onions and green chillies. If the veggies are not coated enough, add more hoisin. Add mushrooms. Add the stock (I mixed the red chilli powder in the stock) and simmer as long as you need to. Went great with white rice. Next time I think I'll add more chillies...! 

As a newlywed who is just learning to cook, this was a really easy recipe and the hubby loved it!

everybody really liked this, even my 3 yr. old ate the broc - maybe because i over cooked it! i added red peppers & carrots to the mix, & used fresh ginger. i also dusted the chicken with corn starch before i cooked it to help thicken the sauce. will certainly make again!

This was a pretty tasty dish; however, we made several additions and changes to add more flavor, based on other reviews.  I chopped up a variety of vegetables - julienned carrots, broccoli, snap peas, red bell pepper and green onions.  I stir fried everything but the onions for until the veggies were still crunchy and set them aside.  I marinate the diced chicken in soy sauce, hoisin sauce, red chili paste, brown sugar, 1 sliced garlic clove, and a splash of rice vinegar.  I then sautéed the chicken, remaining garlic, and green onions and then added the sauce mixture (same combination I used above, except I didn't add rice vinegar) Once it was done, I added the veggies back in with the chicken and the minced ginger, cooking only until the veggies were heated through.  I served it with sticky rice and additional red chili paste, to taste.  Delish! This is a recipe you could do a lot of things with and have fun with it!

This was great!  I will definitely make again.  Definitely double the sauce (except for maybe the chili paste - spicy!).  Next time I will add more veggies, maybe red pepper and carrots.  Also, just a heads up if you're making this for the first time - I wouldn't add the green onions until the end because they pretty much turned to mush being cooked for that long.

The title is right on.  This has a sweet/spicy flavor that is delicious.  I didn't have any chili sauce, so I just left that out.  I did have just a few carrots, so I cooked those with the broccoli and added them in as well.  This is the first stir fry recipe that I have made that my husband did not add extra soy sauce to his plate.  He said that the flavor was just perfect already.  Served over brown rice - this was a perfect light meal.

Very good and easy to make.  I doubled the sauce (with the exception of the crushed red pepper) and only used 4 cloves of garlic. I'll definitely make it again, but I'll probably add more veggies next time.

I did marinate the chicken in soy sauce, garlic and ginger for a few hours before. And I did double the sauce. We really like hot and spicey and this was HOT and spicey.

I made this for me and my lady friend and we really enjoyed it! 

My only complaint of this dish is that it was spicier than we really liked, but that's not really the recipes fault, it says it's spicy! So next time we'll cut out a little bit of the chili paste. 5 stars!

Simple and quick stir fry.  Added bell pepper and carrot along with the broccoli.  Did not steam the broccoli, but threw all the vegetables in after the chicken cooked, and cooked for a few minutes.  Followed suggestions and doubled the sauce, as well as used brown sugar in place of hoisin.  Also omitted the salt.  The sauce does not thicken up, might add some cornstarch next time.  Good level of heat, and overall great flavors.

I added celery and carrots based on some of the reviews, which did add to the prep time, but this was still a do-able weeknight recipe.   Easy and tasty.

5 Star definitely! I threw everything together (instead of cooking it seperately) and sautee'd it; that easy! Thanks for sharing. Going to be a regular in this house! Edit: I didn't double the sauce at all and it was perfect as per other reviews.

I made it twice, the first time following the recipe exactly, the second time with some slight adjustments that made it a 5. Definitely beware that this is the kind of spicy that will make you sweaty and give you the sniffles. Which I love, but some may want to slowly add and taste.

Alterations: I put in a bit of agave syrup to give it a tad more of the sweet, used fresh ginger, put in more variety of vegetables (just anything that I had), doubled the sauce (I may triple next time, though), and sprinkled some fresh chopped cilantro on top at the end (as I frequently do with Asian dishes). Delicious! This is definitely an easy recipe with stuff you usually have on hand if you frequently cook Asian cuisine and very easy to play around with.

I love love love this recipe! I have made it many times with different vegtables green beans are really good with it, and serve it over jasmine rice and it is comparable to a thai dish that I've had at a local thai restaurant! We also change the protien as well, tonight we had it with beef, but it is also very good with pork tenderloin and chicken.

Very good!  With just enough spice. I omitted the chili paste and used just a dash of chili powder.  I also tripled the sauce.   I used it over rice and was very pleased with the meal.  Thanks Amanda for sharing.

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it! Even asked to have it again tomorrow night! I marinated the chicken in soy sauce,ginger and garlic for about 2 hrs before I threw it in the pan. I also cut out the chile paste and only added a small amount of red pepper to not make it so spicy. For the sauce I tripled it to give it more to coat. Very great recipe :)

I thought this was delicious!  I just use whatever vegetables I have on hand at the end of the week.  My stirfry tonight ended up being broccolini, mushrooms, red bell peppers, and chicken.  Double the sauce and serve with rice.  You can also substitute different meats or tofu.  Thanks for sharing!

I made a number of changes based on what I had on hand but found that it was still excellent!  Had zucchini from the garden that needed to be used so subbed that for broccoli.  Added also red, yellow and orange peppers, julienne carrots and water chestnuts.  Also used teriyaki sauce instead of hoisin.  Did make more sauce because I had more veggies.  Thickened with a little cornstarch just before serving and topped with a few peanuts.  Great stir fry recipe!

This was pretty good, but not really our thing. Even still, this dish packs some heat and is a worthwhile experiment. I definitely suggest that you gradually add the chile paste and sample taste as you go so you're not overwhelmed at the end!

This has tons of flavor but you need to triple the sauce amount.  I found it to be WAY to spicy for me (and I like spicy dishes)  and my BF couldn't even eat it.  I would advise to start out with a small amt of the chile paste....then taste it and add accordingly.  Next time I think I will add some cashews.

Yummy! Don't over steam the broccoli like I accidently did. I also added unsalted cashews for some extra protein. It wasn't spicy at all... when I make it again I will be adding a serano pepper for some extra heat..

A bit too spicy for my family, but cutting back on the spice cuts back on the flavor. Needs a little something extra. Not our favorite stir-fry, but not a bad recipe!

So good!! I omitted the broccoli and green onion because I didn't have any and made it with a green pepper and a white onion. One packet splenda instead of hoisin, and at least 5 tbsps chile paste.

I thought this was tasty, but I give it a 4 (wish I could give it a 4.5) because it was soooo  spicy, even though I had carefully halved the amount of red pepper and black pepper.  Also, it needed some sugar to have a sweet taste, I added a few TBSP of brown sugar.  End result was for us was a tasty dish that was a bit on the hot side for us.  i will make this one again, but reduce further the amount of heat in the dish, likely I will cut down on some Chili Paste.  Oh, and I added some extra veggies (sugar peas & diced carrots) and they are welcome additions of flavor

A hot peppery taste is the overpowering flavor; I think it was the black pepper. I'd suggest less black pepper.

Really good! I like that this stir fry has a lot of sauce  - makes brown rice taste better if you use it.

We really liked this!  I've gone through countless stir-fry recipes, trying to find one that we want to have again... this sauce was great!  I used fresh ginger (I think it added a lot), and garlic chile paste (it's what I had).  Like others, I also doubled the sauce (except for salt), which was perfect.  I added mushrooms in addition to the broccoli and chicken, and I definitely overcooked the broccoli, but the sauce was awesome.  We'll definitely make this one again, but not make it quite as spicy (fiance doesn't like really spicy).  Thank you!

This is a great recipe, have made it three times now.  I skip the crushed red pepper, and only add 1 T chili paste - you can still taste the heat.  Increased the sauces (soy, Hoisen) to have enough for the rice. I also added some peanuts for crunch, and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs that i cut up and marinated in soy sauce, garlic and ginger.  You do NOT need to add salt to this dish if you use regular soy sauce.  It is a keeper!  Serve with rice or chinese noodles, YUMMY!

This was fantastic. It was easy to make and tasted phenomenal. I added some carrots too and the taste was great. I added a little extra soy sauce after I added the broccoli and carrots and that give it a little more flavor.

Very easy and very quick to prepare which is always a bonus on a weeknight. I made 2 slight changes. I used jarred chopped ginger instead of ground and upped the chicken stock to half a cup. This will definitely get a repeat performance. Many Thanks.

We love this recipe, the first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  We do like spicy food so since then I have been using a heaping TBSP of Hosin Sauce and a heaping TBSP of Chili Paste. Thanks for the recipe

This is a good recipe, but it definitely needs tweaking with personal preferences.  My husband and I LOVE hot food;  however, I think a tablespoon of chile paste is a bit too much.  I would suggest starting  with a tsp and going up from there.  For us, I think 2 tsp should do it.  It's also a bit confusing to say 2 chicken breast halves since those vary in sizes.  I used a pound of chicken breast.  I also added diced carrot, baby bella mushrooms, and baby corn.  It was delicious served over brown rice.  I'll definitely make this again.

I didn't get the great ratings for this recipe.  Leave out the salt and pepper - there's enough salt with the soy sauce (even low sodium soy sauce)and pepper is not an asian spice and it overpowers the rest of the dish.  Add some sugar for more dimension.  This really isn't that great - maybe with some modifications.  The one good thing is it is healthy and low in calories!

This was wonderful.  I did make a couple of changes, though.  I used asian chili sauce instead of chili paste, and I used two teaspoons of it since I didn't know how hot it would be. I left out the crushed red pepper. Also, I cooked the broccoli in less water and for a shorter time than the recipe directs, and it was perfect. I'll be making this often!

Don't pre cook the broccoli.  And add some cashews or peanuts.   Very good recipe.  Also drench the chicken in corn starch.

This is excellent! Added onions, red peppers, mushrooms which I stir fried first than added later with the chicken and the sauce. I quadrupled the sauce and served over rice. I also mixed the sauce ahead of time with the seasonings and let it marinate. Best stir fry I have ever made

I tripled the sauce and added lots of vegetables. Added red bell pepper, celery, extra green onion, extra garlic, extra broccoli. Could not find chili paste, made my own out of chili powder. Spicy!  Severed over brown rice.

I wanted to make chicken and broccoli today but didn't have chicken so I subbed pork, and I put it all in the crock pot.  I quadrupled the sauce but kept the chili paste to one tablespoon thinking it would be plenty, and it was.  I cooked the pork in the sauce, then tossed in baby carrots, then tossed in the broccoli.  Once everything was done and the pork was completely falling apart, I mixed in about 6 teaspoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce, then served over rice.  It was spicy but not too spicy, and pretty tasty.  This recipe clearly modifies well and using the slow cooker made it a breeze.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the "stir fry" my fiancee always asks for as long as I make extra sauce for it.  If I get it wrong or try to change it up she gets sassy and asks for it the right way.  And it is so easy.

I made this without the green onions (no one likes them in our household) and only 1/2 tbsp of chili paste. My husband said it was the best thing I've ever made...EVER.  He loves stir fry and rice so it was almost guaranteed to please, but I was very happy with the results.

This recipe would be a 5 stars with some tweaking.  You should double the sauce but without doubling the chile paste.  I would skip the salt as with it the dish is on the salty side. I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar to balance out the flavor.  Also, use 2/8 cup of chicken stock and 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. Very easy and quick recipe.

This is a great recipe, but if you can't handle hot, you will want to half the chili paste and maybe leave out crushed red peppers. I also took others advice & put my chicken in the frig. the night before with a little soy some fresh ginger & garlic. I used bell peppers, & no broccoli, I was out..also, used minced fresh garlic. Will make again! Thanks for sharing! :)

LOVED THIS!  I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of adding a boag a frozed mixed stir fry veggies and a bag of frozed mixed peppers, and doubling the sauce because of the extra veggies.  Just make sure you steam them in the microwave first or your sauce might become watery.  Can't wait to make this again!

Quick and easy gave this one 4 stars.  Flavor is more like a 3.  Doubled the sauce but cut down on the chile sauce and red pepper for the kids.  I left out the salt all together.  Used chicken broth as that is what i had on hand.  Added carrots.  The flavor was kind of average.  Not sure I will make this again.

I still can't figure out why this was reviewed so highly.  It was good.  At best.  It lacked flavor and needed many more vegetables than the recipe called for.

Very good, definitely double the sauce.  I only gave this 4 stars because I have a slightly sensitive stomach, and while this tasted delicious, my stomach had quite another opinion.  Otherwise, the taste is fantastic

Pretty good--I tripled the sauce because I was adding a bunch of extra veggies and noodles and it turned out great.  The chile sauce made it a bit spicier than what I was looking for; next time, I might by a sweet chile sauce instead and see what happens.  It tasted great combined with rice noodles.

I thought this was very good.  I didn’t have any chicken stock so I used water.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I make stir fry often and my daughter thought this was the best.

Simple and quick recipe made better served over sticky or bismati rice and tripling the sauce.  Found the red pepper made it too hot (especially for kids) and prefer to add chile sauce to taste when serving.  Chow mein noodles add nice cruch.

I loved this! It was delicious! I kind of took tid bits from some of the reviews. I marinated the chicken for two days in soy sauce, onion powder, minced garlic, splenda, ground ginger, with a little bit of chile powder and paprika. And I almost laugh to think how much I kept overthinking things when I started to actually cook. The thing I kept struggling with is the juice from the meat when you sear it. I didn't know whether to leave it in or drain some of it out.. But next time I will save myself the worry and leave it in. I did double the sauce but cut the chile paste out and cut back on the crushed red pepper(only added a little pinch of red pepper). This recipe is amazingly adaptable...even with a klutz like me in the kitchen, so "Hakuna Matata" and enjoy!

This was delicious and so easy to make, especially with the frozen fully cooked chicken breast strips from target. They are sold in the freezer section in a large bag and sooo convenient! I just microwaved the chicken, and threw it in with the garlic into the oil, added the broccoli and some fresh red bell pepper. Didn't hav green onion so I omitted, as well as the chicken stock b/c I didn't think it was necessary and it turned out delish. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and super easy.  I doubled the sauce recipe and added fresh mushrooms and yellow bell pepper.  I used a rotisserie chicken, which made it even easier to make.  It was very spicy and really good!  I will definitely make this again!

Very easy and very good.  I changed it slightly due to not having chili paste and wanting more vegetables.  I added two stalks of celery and half a cup of pre-cut carrot sticks for more substance.  To replace the chili paste, I diced two medium sized jalepenos.  Because I added a couple other ingredients, I increased the amount of soy and hoisin sauces to one and a half tablespoons while adding one quarter cup chicken broth instead of chicken stock.  This will become a staple in my diet as it was very tasty with the right amount of sweet and spice and easy to cook.

Very picky husband devoured this dish and even ate leftovers the next day (rarely happens).  I tripled the sauce ingredients with the exception of the red pepper which I only doubled.  I also added bell pepper for color and flavor.  Be careful not to overcook the broccoli.  The veggies should be firm.  Served over 1/2 cup of brown rice.  Will definitely make again.

Got two meals out of this sauce.  Excellent.  Had chicken and rice one night.  Chicken and udon noodles another night.  Both were great but DH prefers the noodles with it the best.   Very simple and easy to make.  Makes a super fast weeknight meal.  I always have cooked rice packaged up and in the freezer and a variety of different veggies in the house all the time.  So all I have to add is the "meat".  DH said large shrimp would be really good with this also.  Endless possibilites.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe has good bones but definitely needs to be tweaked if you like more flavorful recipes like myself.  In addition to the veggies it calls for, I added red bell pepper strips, used all 8 cloves of garlic, light sprinkle of red pepper flakes instead of chile paste and I used fresh ginger instead of ground powdered.  I also doubled the sauce and added 1T brown sugar.  Even with those changes, I still found it a bit boring for my taste.  In the end I tripled the sauce, used about 2-3T brown sugar and about 2T of creamy peanut butter.  I like a little more sauce; next time I'll quadruple it.

I was surprised at how thin this stir fry sauce was, I was expecting it to be a bit thicker with the hoisin sauce.  Overall, this was okay. Not really spicy or sweet. It was really mild to our taste buds. I ended up adding a lot more veggies (peppers, carrots, pea pods) so I doubled the ingredients for the sauce. I highly recommend doubling the sauce .   I doubt I'll make this again, I prefer something with a bit more powerful flavor.

This was outstanding!. I thought I had hoisin sauce but was Oyster sauce..different taste but worked well. The garlic paste is really spicy so go easy if you aren't used to hot foods. I used ground chicken which worked very well. I served this over Ramen noodles. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent and super easy. I tweeked this one by cutting the chicken into pieces, coating them in cornstarch and frying till slightly golden the day before; since I was making it for a big family dinner. On the day I stirfried the veggies, then added chicken and sauce. It was great for left overs, a bit of a kick when severed the second time around.

This was a little spicy for my taste, but my boyfriend LOVED it.  It did have a great flavor before I was overwhelmed by spice.  The minor alterations I made were to coat the chicken in cornstarch before frying, triple the sauce (except for the salt, I only put in 1/2 the recommended salt) I also only doubled (rather then triple) the chicken stock, I added 1 cup of peas and al dente angel hair pasta as well.  I wanted to make sure everything was nicely coated, the sauce ratio was perfect that way.  I also used sesame oil to cook the chicken in, I could be fooling myself, but I think it gives it a more authentic flavor.  It turned out great, next time I'll use less crushed red pepper.  But other then that the recipe is a good one.

I followed the suggestions of others and doubled the sauce, but it still did not yield much. I would suggest tripling if you want enough to cover the stir fry and rice. The dish was spicier than expected, even though I cut down on the chili paste. I used fresh broccoli and added water chestnuts and baby corn.

First off, I love this recipe. I made it with 1 lb. boneless beef steak (don't know what cut) and doubled the recipe otherwise. I did make a few changes though; here's what I did. For veggies used 2 pkgs. frozen broccoli, carrots and cauliflower cooked in the micro. Sliced steak into thin strips, placed in large Ziploc bag with 1/4 cup cornstarch and shook to coat then cooked in the oil in a large skillet with the garlic and green onions. I did 4 times the original recipe amount of sauce ingredients. Omitted crushed red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, second listing of 8 garlic cloves. Used 1 tsp. chili sauce with garlic for the chili paste and it was still spicy enough. Finally I used beef for chicken stock. The sauce (even though I doubled the amount) looked a little thin but turned out perfectly. Next time steak's on sale I'll be making this dish:) Thanks for posting.

I used this as a guide and kind of made up my recipe as I went along. Used Stir Fry sauce instead of Soy sauce and Hoisin sauce. Added 2 small packages of fresh whole small mushrooms and some pre-sliced matchstick carrots. Used red pepper flakes and chile powder instead of the paste and added some teriyaki sauce as well. Served it over Minute Boil in a Bag rice. It was fantastic! Way better than take-out!

Really like it. Used broccoli & carrots,made twice the amount of sauce, but didn't add the hoisin sauce to it.   I will make this again because it was so easy to do versitile, and taste good.

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly except for using fresh ginger instead of ground.  Did anyone else notice that "4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced" is listed twice on the ingredients list?  Since the directions didn't mention adding the second bunch of garlic, I assumed it was an error and left the second batch out.  This was pretty good, not spectacular, but I'd definitely make it again.  Thanks, Amanda1432!

Very good recipe!  I used Sriracha sauce in stead of paste and it wasnt too spicey.  Thickened the sauce with corn starch to make a light gravy.

I tried this last night with a few modifications based on what I had at home and based on users' reviews.  I wasn't really sure what weight 2 chicken breasts were, and I had 2 lbs. of chicken on hand, so ended up using 2 lbs.  I doubled the sauce and used stir fry veggies instead of broccoli.  It turned out great, and my husband said it was spicy, but "the good kind of spicy"...will definitely try again1

Very very good.  Instead of chicken I used tofu.  Some people added brown sugar but I thought the sweetness was just perfect.  I used hoisin sauce so I guess if you do not have any on hand you might need the sugar other than that I do not think it needs it.  I used chili garlic as another reader suggested and served with basmati rice.  Delicious

I made this for dinner tonight. I did enjoy it but felt that the sweet aspect of the dish wasn't really there.
 I also had to add extra chicken stock so there would be some moisture to the dish.
 Other than that I really enjoyed it and would make it again maybe pineapple chunks or honey would sweeten it up.
 Overall a very good and healthy stir-fry!

This was REALLY good... enjoyed it.  

I did screw up something.  I was making a cup of chicken stock with a bullion, and I forgot to just take 1/8 cup of it... I put all of it without realizing.  So it was really runny.  Well either way, it was still very good!

Instead of broccoli because my boyfriend hates it with a passion (sigh!), I used sliced yellow squash and zucchini and put it in the pan at the same time as the chicken and onions.

I thought the amount of spices were just fine.  Had a kick.  But I do see the missing sweet.

Very VERY very good!  Thank you so much for sharing!

We made this somewhat differently by doubling all of the spices and liquids and added an entire yellow and an entire orange pepper, about 2 to 3 cups of mushrooms and snowpeas.  It was excellent - I will make it again!  oh yes - also a little brown sugar - maybe 2 tablespoons - but then brown sugar makes everything better!

I JUST FINISHED making this recipie. I haven't even set the table yet, but I had to post a review. It is delicious! Its the proper amount of sweet and just enough spice to leave a pleasant tingle in your mouth. I followed the directions exactly,to a point. I didn't have any chili paste, so I mixed 1/2 tbl chili powder with water. I added more broth at the end b/c it wasn't enough yummy sauce for me. ( I just snuck another bite... DELICIOUS!)

I really liked this recipe - but its not quite perfect. The next time I make it, I will cut back the time I steam the broccoli so that they still have a little snap to them when they enter the stir fry. Also, I might add some peanuts, or raisins, or another dash of sliced green onions to garnish as this dish needed more texture diversity. But overall, VERY worthwhile starting place with lots of fun, rarely used, ingredients. Thank you.

Awesome dish, however it was a little dry so we added some Teriyaki sauce to give it more moisture.  The ginger/red pepper combo was the best part.  We also added tiger prawns and yakisoba noodles.

My husband and I loved this stir fry!  It was the perfect combination of sweet but spicy. My husband does not like  really spicy food and he said it was perfect. That said,  I did leave out the crushed red pepper but used all other ingredients. I'll be making this again in the near future.

We weren't fans, but admittedly could have been due in part to me using broccoli rabe instead of regular broccoli. Sauce was runny (I doubled per others' recommendations) and we didn't love flavor.

This was so good! I doubled everything and added just a tad more broth at the end to give us a little sauce.  We both loved it and ate far too much. The heat was exactly right for us but that's certainly adjustable.  This is a keeper for me, adding to my regular rotation as it's easy and served over rice, makes a nice healthy low fat meal.

Very easy and tasty. Marinated chicken in soy sauce, ginger, hoison and dash of chili powder. Added Tbs oyster sauce as recommended. Used 1/2 c. chicken stock with a bit of cornstarch to thicken sauce a bit. Will definitely make again with minor alterations.

I figured since I'm always using recipes from this site, it's only fair to give some feedback.
Made this last night for dinner and it didn't disappoint!  I did take some liberties with the recipe. For instance, I marinated the chicken a couple hours in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, ground ginger, brown sugar and a couple dashes of both sesame and Mongolian fire oil.  We also used sugar snap peas and sliced carrots instead of broccoli.
I tripled the amount of hoisin and soy sauce so there would be enough to cover the rice, but kept the same measurements of chili paste and pepper flakes.  The heat was perfect-enough to give it a good kick, but not overwhelming that we couldn't enjoy the actual flavor.  I also skipped the salt and pepper entirely (accidentally!) but didn't miss it a bit.  I stir fried the chicken by itself for about 6 minutes then added the carrots and peas, whisked all the sauce ingredients together and poured it over everything, covered and simmered for about 7 more minutes and served over regular white minute rice-delicious!
Hubby is on the paelo diet but is allowed one 'cheat' meal a week-this was his choice for his cheat and went back for seconds :)
Definitely added to my recipe box and is a keeper.  Thanks bunches for sharing!

Like other reviewers, I added more vegetables and increased the sauce.  It was plenty salty without adding the salt recommended in the recipe.  Also, I felt it was spicy enough so I didn't add the crushed red pepper.  Very adaptable and easy recipe and it tasted great!

As a novice at stir fry I was a little nervous but this recipe was so easy! I doubled the sauce as suggested and marinated the chicken in hoisin sauce, garlic and ginger. So easy and lots of great flavor going on!

This recipe had a mixed review in my house.  My husband was a big fan and liked the spicy profile.  I thought it was a little too spicy for my taste and I prefer a thicker sauce.  If you like it really spicy leave the red pepper flakes in - if not - leave them out.   I added red bell pepper, water chestnuts, & bamboo shoots for added veggies, but, left everything else as is.  I will try this recipe again, but, possibly add a little cornstarch slurry for a thicker sauce to coat the chicken and vegetables.  I also think fresh ginger would be better because the ground ginger gets lost with all the other strong flavors.  My husband rated 5 stars and I would give 3-1/2 as is.

It was delicious! Used all the ingredients and it was perfect. Very easy to make. & if anyone needs to find the ingredients Marianos and whole foods grocery stores have all the items. Mainly Marianos.

I Love this. I've made this three times. Twice using white wine instead of chicken stock and it taste so much better. I omitted the red peppers because I didn't have any and omitted the chile paste and just used crushed red pepper. I also followed the suggestion to marinate the chicken in soy, ginger and hoisin prior. Makes the chicken so tender.

I can't have soy so I replaced the soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce instead, and added a little lemon juice and it was very very tasty!

Delicious! Tripled the sauce, and had the chicken with carrots, celery, broccoli. And yes I did marinate the chicken first. Will make again with beef, pork, and even just the veggies over rice.

Excellent dish. I made this with pork tenderloin, and it basically disappeared off the plates. As with other reviewers, I tripled the sauce, though I only doubled the chili paste and crushed red pepper. I had a stir fry veggie mix in the freezer; I used that instead of straight broccoli. I imagine any stir fry veggie mix would work. Next time I make it, I may just try using stew meat, just to see how that works, too. One last thing--I didn't have green onions, so I used Maya sweet instead. I sauteed them a bit beforehand, then added the marinated blend together to cook.

I had wanted to find a simple, easy to make stir-fry. And this is it! Love it! I read through reviews and took a few suggestions for a variation on some of the suggested recipe. I also ended up adding a bit of corn starch because I like thicker sauce. But this is for sure a keeper!

This is my first succesful chicken stir fry and so far my favourite. I didn't change much except for adding more broccoli and doubling the sauce to coat it all. The broccoli really absorbs the sauce and explodes with flavour so there's no need for any other vegetables.

This recipe is very similar to the one you can find in, "The Ultimate Chinese and Asian Cookbook".  I would recommend not wasting so much time with the steamin of the veggies.  Go to the freezer section of Wal-Mart and buy their delux stir fry veggies, and defrost on the counter.  I added in black mushroom sauce, Soy sauce and Chinese white cooking wine.  Being half Asian, I already have most of these ingredients.  The recipe in the coook book has 1/2 tsp of ground tumeric and ginger.  2 tps cumin and 1 TBS of ground coarinader (smells divine).

Jonathon is spot on - i used some left over pork roast, sauteed in worcestershire sauce.  And, added some tinned crushed pineapple when i marinated - overnite - in the refrigerator.  Outstanding basic recipe/starting point

Too funny. I made this exact same recipe without viewing yours. It was fantastic!! 
Kudos to you. 


Only difference is I put a ton more veggies (snow peas, bean sprouts, red pepper, carrots and some wine) but seriously delicious. THANK YOU for posting this!

It was very good I tripled the sauce and made it with veggies only.  We like spicy however I make another sauce that takes the same amount of chili paste and its spicy enough for us, so I only used the amount of chili paste and red peppers for one portion of sauce.  It wasn't as sweet as I thought it should be but that could easily be changed with adding a little sugar.  I will be making this many more times.

Good flavor, very spicy.  I used 1 Tbs. of chile paste, but left out the red pepper flakes.   I used only a scant 1/4 tsp. of salt on the chicken as it cooked, and it was almost too much salt.  For me, this sauce needed a touch of sweetness.  In addition, a little cornstarch would give the sauce a sheen and to help it cling to the ingredients.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I didn't add any additional salt (figuring the other ingredients were salty enough).  That turned out to be the best choice for our family.  I will definitely make this again; it was a big hit!

I used Roasted Red Chile Paste and regular soy sauce.  I ended up putting in about 1/4 cup water and a little bouillon powder instead of 1/8 cup chicken stock.  It was delicious!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I changed it a bit because we try to follow a low sodium diet.  I kept the hoisin sauce, chili paste and soy sauce the same (1 tablespoon of each).  I used way more chicken (3 freezer ready packages of Perdue Fit and Easy chicken which I believe is 6 breasts).  I used two cups of chicken broth and I quadrupled the amount of ginger and red pepper flakes (2 teaspoons of ginger, 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes).  I was scared my version of this recipe would be bland but it wasn't.  The red pepper flakes give it the perfect amount of spice.  It was very tasty and healthy.

I adjusted this tasty recipe for 8 servings.  My husband and I really enjoyed it, however, it was a little too spicy for my kids.  
I couldn't find chili paste in my grocery store, so I used hot pepper paste instead.  I only used 1 Tbsp.  of it and 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes and it provided a good kick.  I would definitely make this recipe again, but next time, I would reduce the hot pepper paste to 1 tsp.  I did use a little more hoisin sauce, soy sauce and chicken stock because I wanted more sauce.

Good basic stir-fry recipe. I marinated the chicken for a couple hours in soy sauce, hoisin and brown sugar as per other reviewers. I also doubled the sauce and added extra veggies to beef it up. I added broccoli and snap peas lightly steamed.

Really good, I didn't have green onion so I used a regular onion. otherwise I followed it exactly. You can use any kind of vegis just don't steam them too long, I did, that was my mistake but it was still really good. Family loved it.

Very tasty, tried doubling the sauce and it turned out VERY spicy. Fantastic for me but some had to add sweet chili sauce to it which, was fine. I also made Jasmine rice to go with it and used gluten free tamari.

Delicious... for me a little less sweet and a little more spice, but that's just my preference. I've made this a couple times and steamed whatever veggies I had that day. Very adaptable. Thanks!

we really enjoyed this. i couldn't find any chili paste so I had to make it without it. It was still really good. we are watching carbs so we ate it without the rice.

yummy, my daughter thought it was a little spicy and I did not even use the red pepper flakes and cut down on the chili paste. I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested. My family loved it, very easy dish we will make again and again

I have never rated on anything but I had to on this. Husband didn't want stir fry but after eating this he said this was a great idea. Even my picky eater ate it and said it was good. High praise from her. I did like some other reviewers and doubled the sauce and used bagged frozen stir fry veggies. Thanks for the great recipe.

Lots of great flavor, and pretty quick and easy to prepare. I thought the sauce was a comfortable level of spiciness, but I imagine some with sensitive tongues might want to cut back on the chilis. Agree with others that the sauce is not enough. As written, it barely coats the chicken and broccoli. I doubled it and it came out a bit too liquidy for my taste, I may experiment with cornstarch to thicken it up when I try it again.  For broccoli quantity, I used about 2.5 large heads, cutting the florets and some of the stems, and it was a good proportion to the 2 chicken breasts.

It's a great meal and I loved it. I'm a so-called picky eater but my girlfriend made this for us and it was very good. She added brown sugar to the sauce and used jasmine rice. I recommend this to everyone to try it at least once but I'm sure you'll want it again.

This was definately one of the best asian dishes I have tried to make.  A couple of changes I made:  I used both beef and chicken (leftovers) that I had marinated overnight in a marinade from this site; I also did not use the last 4 cloves of garlic although it would be fine; I chose to slice the meat in thin strips to make it more "authentic" and to cok quickly; and I used some leftover cut veges as well as a bag of frozen stir fry veges.  The taste was great and just enough "heat".  I will definately be making this again...great for variety of options

Out of necessity I changed the recipe to accommodate my leftovers/veggies in the fridge.  I had leftover baked teriyaki chicken which I needed to use - so started the recipe by stir-frying broccoli, mushrooms, white onion, and garlic.  Then I added the chicken chunks along with the teriyaki sauce they were baked in. Added the hoisin and chile paste to add to the soy sauce and ginger flavor already in the sauce.  Simmered a few minutes and then served over ramen noodles.

I loved this! It is pretty spicy so be ready. In addition I added 1 cup mushrooms, 1 red pepper, and 1 carrot; sauteing when I added the chicken. Served over some whole grain brown rice, this was a satisfying healthy meal.

Followed the recipe  (omitted chile paste though as I couldn't find it) and everyone in my family loved it - including my 19 month old.  This is a great recipe and it is a keeper for us.  Thank you for sharing this.

I really liked the idea of this recipe, but it turned out very peppery and without much other flavor.  At the last minute (after a taste test) I added more hoisin sauce in hopes that it would give some flavor, but the black pepper was still overpowering.  My husband thought it was OK, so I will use as a base to create my own version next time.

Yummy! I wanted a spicy stir fry but not too spicy, this turned out perfect! I added carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, and pea pods to the broccoli. Using so many veggies I had to probably quadruple the sauce. I ran out of soy sauce so had to use some teriyaki. Will make this again, thanks!

WOW, is this spicy! I only used 1/4 of the chili paste & red pepper flakes & holy moly! My husband & son LOVED it-I only had a couple bites but it was really good. I have no doubt that this will be requested many times! I think I'll add green & red peppers next time too!

This was easy enough and tasty.  I would prefer more sauce to my stir-fry so maybe increasing the sauce ingredients would improve my rating.  I added red pepper and carrots because I wanted a variety of veggies.

We enjoyed this recipe and really did not change a thing (we like spicy food).  As others suggested, I doubled the sauce portion.

Used Beef instead of chicken, and celery instead of broccoli. I am not a broccoli fan. Sauce seemed a little spicy for me so I substituted a powdered peanut sauce mix from the grocery store. Yum. Added onions, water chestnuts, and bamboo shoots to give it a kick! Left out the ginger, chili, broth, hoisin and garlic, since the powdered sauce already had a lot of those items in it.

5 stars for a great base recipe. I did change things up a bit and I think it made it better the 2nd time I made it. I sliced up 2 chicken breasts, cooked with the garlic. Then added 1/4 cup of hoison sauce, 1/4 cup of chili paste, and 1/4 cup of soy sauce. After adding a double dose of all dry spices, I added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies. I served this over white rice and had enough for 4 good sized servings.

Yum and easy.  Sauce was good and only change I made was to substitue 1T chili powder for the paste.  The sauce was enough to lightly coat the chicken and veggies.  For veggies I used snow peas and red pepper which made for a colourful dish.  Thanks!

This was fantastic although I made some modifications. I marinated the chicken with soy sauce, omitted the red and black peppers and salt and reduced the chile paste to taste. Doubled the sauce as suggested by most reviewers and just used water instead of broth. Used a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce and added some fried tofu cubes and zucchini. Would probably use baby corn cuts, mushroom and carrots next time!

"This is restaurant quality" - first comment from my husband.  I added some brown sugar and used bok choy instead of broccoli.  I also marinated the chicken for two hours.  So very wonderful.  Thank you!

This is a great basic recipe.  However, I added much more.  I used one pound chicken and shrimp.  Also, mushrooms, shredded carrots, water chestnuts, 2 fresh jalapenos, and cashews.  With all the extra ingredients I quadrupled the sauce.  I sautéed the peppers with chicken and onions, and didn't add the fresh pre-cooked shrimp until the chicken was fully cooked.  All in all...turned out great!  Makes about 10 large servings

I made this with vegetable broth and vegetarian chicken substitute.  The flavor is quite good, but you really need to double or triple the sauce. Added onions, peppers, and carrots and served over rice...delish.

Great recipe.  As previous recommendations, doubled the sauce.  I left out the red pepper flakes and there was just enough kick for us.  My only complaint is that it really doesn't make enough so next time I will double it so we have leftovers for lunch the next day!  Chopped nuts on the top were the perfect addition and added water chestnuts for extra texture - yum!

Very tasty.  I doubled the sauce and added 1 cup thinly sliced carrots which I steamed with the brocolli.  This made it more colorful and darker than the picture.

Great, easy, healthy recipe for mi-week working people. I used frozen broccoli florets (steamed first) to save time. Tasty and a little bit of a spicy bite.

My husband and I loved the recipe but it was a bit spicy and we left out the Chile sauce cause we forgot to buy it (oops). I did add some brown sugar to calm down the heat.Sauce was fine I just added a bit more chicken stock being that I simmered it for so long and I didn't steam the broccoli. It cooked down just fine on a simmer while I made some pan fried pot stickers to go with this meal. MMM good recommend..

I made this for dinner last night, and we both enjoyed it very much. I did omit the black pepper, and we felt that it was still a bit too spicy for our taste. I think that next time I'll also leave out the crushed pepper, and just bump up the amount of chili paste a touch (I used Thai chili-garlic sauce because it's what I had on hand). I used about 6 cups of broccoli florets and peeled the broccoli stalks, sliced them and added them to the wok with the chicken for an extra nutritional boost. Quite tasty!

Loved this! I adapted it to fit my tastes and it was great. Instead of just using broccoli I used a variety of vegtables that I like in a stir-fry and then used the sauce with it. It had a wonderful flavor. I agree with others that there wasn't a whole lot of sweet about it but still so good. I will definitely be making this again.

We enjoyed this, including the kids (ages 2 and 4).  Left out the crushed red pepper for the kids, but my husband added it at the table for some spice.  Added more veggies (carrots, bok choy, mushrooms) and used fresh ginger.  Will likely use this again-- great way to get the recommended daily veggies in!

I though this dish was okay. When I started cooking it..I had high hopes because it smelled sooo good. But after tasting...it was missing something. I think it's sugar. It had a lot of kick but no bite.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I am not an expert cook but it was very helpful. I was unable to find Hoisin Sauce in my local store but I cheated. I used a packet of stir-fry seasoning I found in the local supermarket and added a few ingredients from the recipe. Nevertheless, it turned out great!

Easy to make, with not many ingredients.  But boy oh boy is it HOT.  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, except I didn't have any hoisin sauce, so I substituted brown sugar, completely skipped the red pepper flakes and salt.  If you are the type of person who likes medium hot chicken wings instead of hot wings, you may want to add the chili paste sparingly.  (All you folks out there who said 'it's not too hot'... have you checked to see if maybe you burned all of your taste buds off? ;) (Kidding!!)

This was easy and delicious.  I cut out the chili paste as my husband doesn't like overly spicy food. I also added carrots and snap peas. next time I will double the sauce and thicken it. Definitely a keeper!

It came out good, except that it was a little too spicy for my wife's tastes.  So if I fix it again, I will cut down on the chili paste.

This was excellent!  I used broccoli and carrots and also tripled the sauce and spices and it was pretty warm; will not put as much crushed red pepper next time.

Made this for the family and they like it very much.  I did use stir fry vegetables (frozen) in stead of just Broccoli which I liked better.  But like other readers suggested, I doubled the sauce recipe, in my opinion, if you do not, there isn't enough sauce.  Served with white rice.  I will make this again.

I marinated the chicken in soy sauce, ginger & garlic for 45 minutes. I added a lot more veggies, red & yellow peppers, sliced portobello mushrooms, & carrots. I quadrupled the sauce, but left out the salt and red chili sauce (I added red pepper flakes instead.) My family raved  about the tasty, tender chicken & the sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my "go to" stir fry recipe.  I always make changes, such as using sliced ginger, adding carrots or red bell pepper, but this is the one!  It's the sauce that does it.  Amazing recipe.

Delicious!  Very easy and quick to make.  I did not have chili paste so I just used a little bit of chili powder instead.  My family gave this 5 stars and told me we should have this again.

Really good! It was spicy and we really liked it but next time – and there will be a next time for this quick and easy dish – I would use a little less chili paste and/or omit the chili flakes as the heat overpowered the sweet a bit. I threw the broccoli in when the chicken was almost cooked saving some time. Served it over udon noodles.

The sauce to this dish was super tasty. I don't see the need to cook the broccoli first..i just added it when the chicken was almost cooked..we don't like soggy veggies. Didn't have green onions on hand but that's okay because I made this for my 4 year old and she wanted peas in it . Mixed in some stirfry noodles at the end. With that in mind I added about 4 times the sauce because of the noodles..they usually soak up extra .

Didn't get finished typing my last review before it posted. This is one of our faves!  The spice is just fantastic. I agree with other reviewers that tripling the sauce is best. You get more coverage of the veggies that way. I triple all ingredients: hoisin, chile, soy, stock, ginger and red pepper flakes. I also add red and yellow peppers for additional flavor, color and crunch. I cook them and set them aside with the cooked broccoli. Try this recipe; you won't regret it!

Way simpler than any other stir fry my family has made in the past and very tasty as well! I used a bag of broccoli stir fry vegetables instead of just steamed broccoli for more vegetable variety. Definitely a keeper!!!

Velveting the meat is an absolute must. I’ve tried making stir fry over the 31 years I’ve been married. The sauce and meat has always been clumpy. I “velveteed” the meat and it came out PERFECTLY.  The season seasoning was spot on and the house smelled liked we were at PF Chang’s. I doubled the sauce as I added a small bag of Udon noodles from our local Asian grocers. Thank you for the tip on velvelting as I now feel comfortable experimenting with other stir fry recipes.

This is absolutely delicious!  I have a hard time with Asian recipes because of the strong tastes-  this was perfectly balanced.  I followed the recipe as is, but used chicken boullion in dissolved in water for the chicken stock since it called for so little.  Wish there was more sauce!  - steaming the broccoli first makes it perfect!

I've made this a few times, this time I substituted sliced beef and beef broth  (1/2 cup instead of an 1/8th).  Cooking with chicken or beef are equally good.  It is easy to substitute your favorite veges to equal the 3 cups broccoli.  I didn't have green onion, but a small onion slivered worked as well.  I also thicken with about 1/2 Tbsp corn starch.  My chili paste is really spicy, so I tend to go a little easier (1/2 Tbsp instead of a Tbsp).  I stir fried the beef with a little oil and sesame oil and then removed to cook the veges.  I used a little of the broth to steam the veges.  Then readded the beef and finalized with the remaining broth mixed with corn-starch.  Good over basmati.

It was too spicy for us, but very good.  Next time I'll use only 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 T chile paste, and No crushed red pepper.

I used several of the suggestions made by others , marinating the chicken, and making twice the amount of sauce. I also used fresh frozen ginger, and put chopped roasted peanuts on top right before serving. It was delicious!!!

This was an excellent recipe. Easy recipe to follow, fairly short prep time, and a short list of ingredients. I did double the hoisin sauce, soy sauce and chicken stock since we all like sauce. I didn't have chili paste so I doubled the crushed red pepper. It came out delicious and spicy too! We all loved it. I will make this recipe again and again! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

7.12.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/70585/sweet-and-spicy-stir-fry-with-chicken-and-broccoli/ ... I'm surprised about this one.  I kept thinking I forgot something because it was "eh."  I didn't.  'Pretty bland.  I don't understand why.  Easy enough to "fix" on the plate.

I think the meat has to marinate longer after being cooked. The spices did not transfer well, though they were pungent in the broccoli. It isn't the best Chinese recipe I've ever eaten, but it's much better than your run of the mill 5 dollar dinner outlet. It took me much longer than the stated time because I sliced my own ingredients and made a double helping. Minus trying to figure out portions, I think it took about an hour to prep and cook.

It was tasty. I didn't change anything about the recipe, except I didn't have chile paste, but I read that I could substitute it with equal parts of hot sauce, & I added sliced white onion to the chicken and added sliced mushrooms in with the broccoli.

this is a really easy and quick dinner.  I didn't have chile paste, so it turned out pretty mild, which was actually good in terms of my kids eating it.  I did double the hoisin and soy sauce.  It didn't blow me away with the flavor, but was a pretty good one dish meal.

II made my own sauce vs store bought hoisin sauce- s1/4 cup soy,  with 2tbs brown sugar-not liking a lot of heat didn't add the red pepper flakes- just the chili paste. Also added a sliced yellow onion, red pepper  & button mushrooms. would go a little lighter on the ginger next time.

This recipe was pretty good but I feel like it was missing something, possibly oyster sauce. I marinated the chicken as others mentioned and it made the chicken tender and flavorful. I added peppers and mushrooms which brought it to a whole new level. All-in-all this is a good base recipe.

This was a great recipe!  I made a couple of substitutions based on what was on hand: steamed green beans for broccoli and sriracha for the chili paste.  I added a leftover half an onion and also used 1.5x as much sriracha instead of 2x (because my family is not as fond of spicy food).  It turned out really good.  My mother took several bites before saying that it might be too spicy, but after a few more she decided it was just right.  I will definitely make this again.

Instead of green onions I used sliced white onions, and I added a red bell pepper.  Probably because of the extra veggies, the sauce came out watery for me.  To correct it, I added another tbs each of soy sauce, red pepper paste, and hoisin sauce; at the end I removed the meat and veggies and added some corn starch and simmered a bit to thicken things up.  After that, it was delicious!

Very good. I live in a small town so the grocery store is rather limited. I couldn't find Hoisin sauce but they did carry a Stir-fry sauce so I used that with all the other soy/ginger/chili paste ingredients and it was still delicious. I also added some red, orange, yellow and green peppers at the same time I added the steamed broccoli.  I would definitely make it again. I found that the chicken was a little dry, so next time I'm going to try to boil the chicken first then shred it. Then make the sauce and added the shredded chicken broccoli and peppers.

This was awesome!  My entire family, including a picky seven-year-old, loved it.  I used chicken thighs because they were on sale and chili sauce instead of chili paste simply because my grocery store didn't have the paste.  It was delicious and the ginger made the house smell wonderful.

Very good flavor. Second time I made it I quadrupled sauce and reduced heat significantly (put chili paste on the table instead) to suit family.

I'm not a huge fan of spicy hot but my family is. I like others left out the chilli paste and it was still plenty hot. I also added mushroom and snow peas to the broccoli. Easy to make and the end result was great. It is a keeper. Loved it

Made this exactly like the recipe except I added red peppers and doubled the sauce and spices. Next time I will do the same except I will keep the chicken stop at 1/8 cup because it was a little too much liquid. It's delicious flavor tho!!

I saw this recipe in the most recent Allrecipes magazine and decided to give it a go for a little something different.  

I did follow the suggestions in the magazine to double the sauce, which is a must if serving over rice in my opinion. Plus, I added a red bell pepper.  This is a great recipe and versatile if you want to take out veggies or add others.  The only ingredient I did not use was the extra salt b/c it seemed unnecessary when I tasted the sauce.  There is a lot of flavor components and salt already in the other ingredients so I just wouldn't include it.  

Overall a good recipe.  My husband loved the spicy kick.

As my first time cooking anything other than something in the microwave or one of the oven cooked pizzas it was interesting because I forgot the vegetables :( but it was still so good. I didn't use the chili paste because my siblings aren't a fan of very spicy stuff but I will definitely cook this fantastic recipe again with the vegetables and chili paste for myself and my girlfriend :)

The family loved it.  I added some red peppers because I had them and needed to use them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Thank you!

Excellent flavor. 
I made a few changes. 
I used about 2 c. of broccoli florets (2 stalks) and about 1 c. of 3" carrot matchsticks (3 carrots).  I steamed the broccoli for 5 minutes, and steamed the carrots matchsticks for 3 minutes.   
I left out the salt.  (Didn't need it.  I guess there is enough salt in the soy sauce.)  
I doubled the sauce.  (At first, there wasn't enough to cover the veggies or to serve over rice.)  
My family and I loved this dish!

Wow! This was an extremely hot (spicy) dish.  We couldn't eat it as the recipe goes.  I added agave nectar to sweeten it up enough to eat.

Great recipe. Didn't have green onions so omitted them. Made hoisin sauce from scratch as I didn't have any on hand but had all the major ingredients to make my own. Doubled the sauce, went light on the chili paste and added carrot and matchstick red peppers, both of which I par cooked.

I realized after making this recipe it was a little too spicy for me. I doubled the sauce as people suggested. I should have added more broccoli and maybe some carrots as shown in the picture. It just lacked color after the broccoli faded in color. It was a nice bright green til I mixed it in then it faded. I will try it again but adding more color. I did not use the salt as people suggested and it tasted fine. I'll give it one more try.

This smelled wonderful as it was cooking, but was just way too spicy for me.  I'm not really familiar with all of the ingredients, so I wonder if there is a less spicy version of the chili paste.  Mine said "ground fresh chili paste", so I thought I had the right thing, but when I read other reviews stating that this wasn't spicy, I just don't get it.  I may make it again without the chili paste, or maybe with just a tiny bit, but definitely not the full amount.

Great recipe! I changed it a little according to my taste & what I had on hand. Added halved baby Carrots to the broccoli, do not have a steamer and didn't have time to improvise one up, so just boiled that duo covered in water instead. Added some sliced red bell pepper to the chicken mixture,and lightly salted/peppered the chicken only before sauteing. Did not have any crushed red pepper, so sprinkled a bit of cayenne in there instead to replace the heat. Used Sriracha in place of the chili paste. Added a bit of salt and garlic powder after taste testing to make it just perfect. Had it with white rice, DELICIOUS. And only took me about 30 minutes total to make! Preparation and all! Try this easy recipe and you wont regret it.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I only make it with the chicken and broccoli because I'm picky but its so tasteful. My boyfriend thinks the chicken tastes a little bland compared to the rest of the dish so I am going to try and marinate the chicken next time. I used brown sugar instead of hoisin and of course I made plenty of extra sauce. Definite keeper.

Easy to make.  Excellent flavor.  My 8-yr old loved it and both husband and daughter ate a second helping!  I included everything but the Chili Paste.  My daughter likes spice, but I didn't want to risk overdoing it on the first try.

This was easy and tasty.  I did as some of the other reviews did -- marinated the chicken ahead of time, but I also added an egg white, which tenderizes the chicken.  I also added some sliced water chestnuts.  I think this recipe would be wonderful with beef too!

Good, but make double the sauce. If you add veggies like others suggested like mushrooms & celery (which I did) you need to 4 times the sauce. I found this out to late, but will do next time. I really like the extra mushrooms & celery so that'll be a staple to this.

this is a great recipe.   I modified it a bit by using ginger/garlic paste (found in Indian product stores), with fresh garlic but not fresh ginger.   I also added button mushrooms, just because I love them.  I serviced this on the Barley Bake, which is just another great dish.

as is the recipe does not have enough sauce and is quite spicy and salty. I used half cup of chicken broth, omitted the salt and pepper, left the other ingredients in the same amounts and added 1 T of cornstarch and brown sugar.   I am very grateful for this recipe.

To be honest, it was just OK. It seemed a little bare without rice so I added brown rice halfway through cooking it. Also, it took me almost two hours in the store to find out chili paste was with thai/asian food. I made this twice now. The first time the broccoli was too mushy and the rice was hard (Since I didn't realized to add it until the last minute).

The second time I made it, the recipe was better, but there was too little broccoli and too much chicken. I suppose that's my fault for adding extras, but hey not everyone who I cook for eats the same portion. Not the easiest thing in the world to make. 

I got tired of chopping fresh garlic and just added minced garlic. It was still pretty good and I don't recommend the fresh garlic unless you just have a knack for that stuff. I honestly couldn't be bothered.

Easy to do and easy to alter to your liking. Added a bunch of other veggies, halved the salt, used firm tofu instead of chicken, and doubled the sauce as was recommended by other reviewers.

YUM!! I left out the spicy stuff since my kids don't like it. I added celery, red peppers, and cachews. Thanks for a great recipe. Will make again for sure!

Really good.  LOVE the combination of sweet + spicy.

Didn't have crushed red pepper (omitted) or chile paste (used sambal olek instead).

Served over sticky rice.

As many reviews state there is not enough sauce so had to make adjustments for that.  Got a little heavy handed with the hot stuff and mine got a little too spicy for my taste.  My hubby loved it!  I also used different varieties of veggies.  Bok Choy, asparagus, carrots, peas, red onion, mushrooms, green pepper.  Flavor was really good I just made it too hot.

I loved this dish but it was really spicy. I doubled the sauce and next time I make it I will hopefully come up with ideas on how to decrease the fire.

This is a great recipe. I made it without the chili paste only because I didn't have any. It was delicious.
