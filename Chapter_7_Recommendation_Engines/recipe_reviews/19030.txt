I made this dessert for my family. I am not much on banana desserts but this one is a keeper with a few changes. I used a muffin tin and put 1 crescent in each one. I formed it to fit the muffin cup. I also added brown sugar and cinnamon to the mix. I would think it would be bland without those flavors. I spooned filling in each cup and refrigerated it while we ate dinner.  I baked them as directed and scooped them out into small dessert bowls. I topped it with french vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! My family went nuts over them. Easy to pepare too!

This recipe is fabulous, and very easy.  
For an extra touch; before baking, I brushed the top of the pastries with melted butter and lightly sprinkled with Cinnamon and sugar.  It was GREAT!

This was quick, very easy to make, and was visually appealing, but my fiance and I didn't like the flavor.  It wasn't sweet enough - it almost had a bitter taste to it.

These are great but not quite sweet enough. I added some brown sugar in my second batch and they were perfect. These would make a good breakfast treat.

Excellent!  Add a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream to the side and viola!  Yummy, I also sprinkled the finished product with granulated sugar and cinnamon before cooking.

This turned out to be a very good recipe with some modifications. First of all, just the bananas with the butter and recommended amount of vanilla does not taste good. It tastes bitter. I sliced the bananas instead of mashing and tossed them with vanilla, butter and brown sugar. That made all the difference in the world. I needed more crescent rolls than it called for, too. After baking, I served with a caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. So yummy!!

This was a really good recipe! I added a dollop of whip cream on top before serving because it
is quite sweet. It is also kind of plain in shape, so I think the next time I make it I will either cut the rectangles
in half, pinch the edges or maybe even try it in a muffin pan.

07/04/01- added note: made this again, cut rectangles in half and put them in muffin tins. It looked really nice.
                 Also, did not have bananas so I used Smuckers Extra Fruit Strawberry Jam (very yummy!!). My roommate suggested 
                 drizzling this with chocolate sauce.

This was good.  Not too big on cooked bananas, but still good.  Tried it again with bananas that were not that ripe and it was better, not that mushy which made a difference in our taste preference.

This really is the best dessert recipe.  I added a bit of melted butter and cinnamon/suger on the top as per other reviews and my family complained there was no more left!

I made more of the banana mixture than the recipe called for and made double-size "packages" with a bottom layer of crescent roll spread with brown sugar and butter, then the banana mixture, then the top layer of the crescent roll, which I brushed with butter before cooking.  After baking, I put some of the syrup walnuts (found in the ice-cream toppings section) on, as well as the caramel sauce.  It was totally divine, and would make an incredible sweet breakfast dish as well.  This was a perfect ending to a delicious dinner, as well as being exceptionally easy to make.  (as a side note, I assembled the packages about 90 minutes before cooking, so I could enjoy more time with my dinner guests, and there was no problem with that as it was refrigerated.  all I had to do after dinner was eaten was pop them in the over, which needed to be cooked for 2/3 minute longer than the recipe calls for).

I would give this recipe a 5 star rating but my husband says 4. He feels that the dough should be a little sweeter so next time I will be adding some cinnimon and sugar to the top of his. We also added chocolate sauce and a bit of whipped cream to the top. It was delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

yum,yum,yum. It's sooo easy but tastes as if it was difficult. I added chocolate chips and a dash of cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves to the mixture. I agree that the shape is kind of weird and difficult to serve, so next time I may roll up each little triangle into something like a potsticker.

Made this for dessert tonight. I was super excited about this as I have a ton if bananas that need to be eaten. I added about 3 TBSP of mini chocolate chips, and chopped up 5 or 6 caramels and threw them in the banana mix. I then kinda gathered up the edges of the crescent dough over the banana mixture. Bake for about 14-15 minutes til golden on top. They smelled great, but they tasted like baby food. The bananas turned to mush. Maybe I would try and make a banana cream pie in it next time? I'm gonna play around and see what happens. Overall this wa a quick and fairly good dessert, but definately not a keeper. :(

These were impressive and SO easy! 

Like other reviewers I added brown sugar and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and sugar.  I also omitted the butter (because the crescent rolls have a lot in them already) and I added pecans.

Thank you for such a great and easy recipe!

Very good!!  I added some brown sugar (which tasted great!) but made it a bit too runny to hold into my crescent roll pockets!!  Had to make them more like crescent roll cups but came out great!!  Might try a large muffin pan and see if that would work!  VERY GOOD!!!

Very quick and super easy.  It does take like banana bread only in 10 minutes.  Next time I would double the banana topping to cover.You could divide into  triangles and serve with ice cream.  I also added coconut.

It was delicious and so easy.  I added some brown sugar as several others had suggested.  I assembled them earlier in the afternoon and baked right before serving. Put a scoop of ice cream on top.

This dessert tasted great (with the added brown sugar)and was super easy.  I used vanilla butter nut extract instead of plain vanilla to make it a more interesting flavor and used only a teaspoon.  Also, I had trouble with the crescent rolls.  They wanted to stretch out which made some of the servings too large for my dessert plates.  Next time I'll use the store bought frozen puff pastry and cut it to the size I want. It won't look like flat crescent rolls then either.  A great recipe to play around with!

This is one of the easiest to make ever desserts. And it is so tasty. My husband loves it and everytime we pass bananas in the grocery store he asks if I can make this again.

This turned out pretty well, but I have to say that a tablespoon of vanilla extract was WAY too much!  Next time I will use one teaspoon.  I added some sweetened angel flake coconut before drizzling on the caramel sauce - very tasty.

OH MY GOD!  This recipe is fantastic.  I am not really a banana fan, but I had some that needed to be used up.  When my friend and I finished eating this decadent dessert, we wished we had more. They're a nice treat, but not too sweet.  Good job to whoever invented this recipe!

Easy to make.  Tastes like a lot more work than it takes to make them. Is very good as side to ice cream. Depending on your presentation, can be an elegant surprise ending to the meal. I have also made these sealing the bananas in the middle of an individual crescent roll.

A cinch to make and looks lovely dusted with a pinch of confectioner's sugar.  I served it for an anniversary dinner on the weekend and it was a wonderfully warm dessert to serve.  I received excellent reviews by all.

These were all right.  Not great but not bad either.  I did drizzle melted chocolate along with the caramel over them after they baked.  My husband, who requested a dessert with banana, said they were ok but not something that he would ever crave. I will probably not make them again.

Oh man.  SO good.  I topped these with French vanilla ice cream, a spray of chocolate sauce, and a spray of caramel sauce.  Easy, inexpensive, and delicious.  My kind of dessert.

Easy to prepare.  Easy to bake.  I added 2T light brown sugar, 1t cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the banana mixture.  Didn't have caramel sauce, so brushed the tops with butter and dusted with cinnamon sugar.  I topped the little packages with a scoop of frozen Cool Whip.  My hubbs totally love it and said it's a keeper.  One more thing-I forgot to melt the butter for the mixture.  Just mix room temp butter with the bananas, and other ingredients and save yourself a step.  PLUS, the mixture doesn't spread out this way when you assemble the packages; makes for easier assembly.

I made this tonight for my fiance and he LOVED it!  I also added brown sugar to my banana mixture, brushed with melted butter, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  Instead of caramel, I drizzed honey on top and it turned out Awesome!

I love banana desserts and will try anything new.  This dessert was easy and tasted pretty good.  I think that the posters who made modifications by adding brown sugar, cinnamon, ice cream etc. did a wise thing.  It just needs a little extra something.  I also wonder if it could be made more attractive.  Maybe you could squish the rolls into cupcake pans and then fill them with the banana mixture.
All and all it tasted yummy but could be even better with just a few changes.
