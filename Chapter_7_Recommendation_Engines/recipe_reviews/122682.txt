This was pretty good. I used more like 1/2 and 1/2 on the fruit.  I also threw in 2 pluots that I had.  The color of the jam was beautiful.  It was a little too sweet even with 5 c. sugar.  It could have easily been sweet enough with 4 c. sugar.  I also always throw in an extra 1/2 box of pectin in jams.  I like a really thick jam and this helps that happen quickly.  I made this jam again with 2 pluots again, a handful of strawberries that I had on hand (and no one was going to eat) and an apple that started to get mushy.  I threw it all in, cooked, sugared and jarred.  It came out awesome!!!  You can't pick which fruit you taste, but it is wonderful.  The color is always awesome too!

Very Yummy and very easy!!  I had a bunch of plums that were over-ripe and getting mushy and they worked great in this.  I didn't make any changes!  Great Jam!  It made about 6 pint size jars.

I love this recipe, but it calls for way too much sugar. Both times I made it I only put it half of what it calls for. Its easy and tastes great.

This was a good and easy jam to make. i would have liked a bit more pear or plum flavor, I couldn't really taste either one to much & it was quite sweet. But it was a hit with the family, and thats the most important thing. I would make it again.

I always get lots of compliments on this recipe.  I like to use black plums as they make the jam a beautiful color.

Wow! Positively yummy! I followed other suggestions and used less sugar. I also, used Black Plums, left the skin on,  and ground the fruit; so there are reddish purple flecks in the jam and it is slightly pinkish in colour. It still tastes mostly of pear and I'm getting raves from everyone I serve it to.l

Very good recipe and a nice use of the fresh pears. I reduced the sugar level down to 4 cups and it was still plenty sweet and delicious!  Instead of plums, I used pluots.

I have made this recipe for several years now. It is my favorite.  Nice way to use up those plums and pears that seem to all come at the same time. Thanks.

I doubled this recipe, but only used 5 cups of sugar total. From that we got 7 half pints plus.
