I found this recipe in the AR magazine for Dec/Jan 2019.  The crust intrigued me so I went for it.  We were pleased with this dish overall.  I found Cavender's Greek Seasoning WAY too salty-240mg sodium for only 1/4 teaspoon and the salty flavor predominated each bite.  Next time I will make my own concoction of herbs for a Greek flair and separately season with Kosher Salt & pepper.  We enjoyed the pistachio crust a lot and I will repeat this recipe.  Even with some Panko crumbs, it's a relatively low-carb option.  I served with spinach that had been saut√©ed with butter/olive oil/garlic and some chicken broth added towards the end.

This recipe is very easy to make and it tastes delicious. I didn t have Greek seasoning so I looked up the ingredients and made my own. I added crumbled feta cheese to the dry mix. The entire family enjoyed it.

Absolutely delicious! Didn't have the Greek seasoning nor all of the ingredients to make it so just used the ones I have. It only took 8 minutes in my air fryer.
