Finally, Shorecook's recipe has been published! I've been making her personal recipe for a few years now. Here's my review: Perfect recipe as written! It wasn't overly creamy as you would get from a store. This potato salad tastes even better the next day as the ingredients continue to meld together. Even my husband, who is picky on potato salads loved this. Who ever knew potato salad was so easy to make? I added two stalks celery , chopped just to add some extra crunch to the salad (see her if desired suggestions in recipe description). We'll never use store bought potato salad again. We've brought this potato salad as a potluck dish to share with our cabin neighbors (they do a guys trip) during an annual trip and this potato salad had 5 star reviews with comments of best potato salad they've ever had, but don't repeat that to my mom or wife lol.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Shorecook. Still making and loving it!

This is exactly how my Mum always made her hugely popular potato salad, and it's still the best potato salad recipe out there. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Been making my potato salad like this for years. I always add celery. I let it sit in the fridge for 5-6 hours and recheck the seasoning and mayo level. I also sprinkle w paprika on the top before serving for a more traditional look. Always receive compliments, even from people who prefer pickles or viniger based dressing.

What?  No chopped gherkins?  And celery seed is even better than salt.

It's not that I couldn't eat it, I WOULDN'T eat it.  This (so called) Potato Salad leaves VERY MUCH to be desired!  Anyone who thought that this Potato Salad was good, obviously   has nothing more than a palate for (supermarket) Deli Potato Salad.

This is basically my motherâ€™s recipe with two notable exceptions. She added a small amount of white vinegar and celery seeds. Whenever I take it to a pot luck, the dish comes home empty.
