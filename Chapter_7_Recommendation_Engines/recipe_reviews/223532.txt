The fact that this is simply a lime variation of a fairly standard lemon bar recipe doesn’t make these bars any less delicious.  Some of these recipes, as does this one, call for flour in the filling; some do not.  I’ve tried them both ways with equally good results.  I wanted these really lime-y, so I upped the lime juice to a half cup and the lime zest to a full tablespoon.  In most cases (cake might be another story) I don’t care for artificially green tinted lime desserts and by doing so I was rewarded with its classic, creamy pale yellow color.  The shortcrust pastry is tender and buttery, offset by the fresh sweet/tart lime flavor.  Not sure how the glaze would hold up on these, I chose to just stick with the traditional dusting of powdered sugar.  If you like lemon bars, Key Lime pie or any citrusy dessert for that matter, you’ll find this a dependable recipe for a delightful, light and refreshing dessert.

I gave these 5 stars because this recipe is delish and even though I made a few small changes, the origional recipe would be still be great! I didn't put the glaze on top, just a dusting of powered sugar and they were great. However, there are a few things I would change in the recipe the next time I make these. First, I did use butter instead shortening because I like the flavor in a shortbread crust much more and will do so next time also. Second, I didn't like the ratio of crust to filling, about 50/50. Next time I will double the filling. Third, I increased the amount of zest a little to about 1 tablespoon because that was how much I got from one lime and wanted to use it all. I did only use the 1/3 cup of lime juice as the recipe calls for and overall I thought the lime flavor was great. (Other reviewers suggested to use more since the flavor wasn't strong enough.) I really liked these and will make them again for sure! Thanks

Made these for a family reunion.  Mostly the women liked them, not so much the men.  Followed directions with just a couple of changes.  While making the middle I used 5 limes so it equaled a little more than 1/3 cup.  Also, I had to increase the glaze by an addional 1/2 batch to cover the bars entirely.  I thought they were very tasty.  I did use green food coloring as suggested, so they were pretty to look at too.  I bet they would go good with a Corona - if your the type that's ok eating sweets with your beer.

Delicious.  If I were making these for company, I would have followed the recipe exactly.  But it was just for my own family, so I cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups (in the lime mixture) and just lightly dusted with Powdered Sugar (instead of the glaze.)  I also only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter in the crust (versus 2.)  My husband said they were to die for!  Great recipe.

Great recipe.  Tripled the lime zest and doubled the juice in the bar and doubled the zest and juice in the icing for the extra zip.  They were definitely zingy.  Everyone loved them and they were completely gobbled up.  I used a 9x13 pan for the recipe with no changes except those I've listed (and cooked a little longer).

So my lime tree is exploding limes, naturally, I am looking for any and every way to use them (extra Limey gin and tonics?!). About this recipe. It was alright. I went with some of the comments and doubled the lime juice and zest and I also used only about half of the crust and doubled the filler. Here's a list of what I liked: the glaze absolutely is necessary because the filler doesn't have any sugar so without the glaze it will be too tart, the added food coloring, the tartness mixed with sweet crust/glaze (it's hard to find a good tart lemon or lime bar), definitely glad I halved the crust and doubled the filling. Things I did not like: the crust was not crust like it was almost chewy...needed more flour or maybe shortening instead, next time I'm going to go with the suggested amount of lime...maybe a hair more. Otherwise the bars were yummy...but remember one thing folks...use the glaze!!!!!

These were delicious! I made them for a coworker's going away party. They got rave reviews from everyone. I made a few small changes: I made them in a 9"x13" pan, I also upped the lime juice from 1/3 c. to 1/2 c., I decreased the white sugar from 2 c. to 1 1/2 c., I didn't use the green food coloring and I didn't make the glaze. I just sifted powdered sugar on top after they cooled completely.

These are terrific! The only change I made was to use 1/2 c. of lime juice. Also omitted the food coloring  ... SOOOO good, and they came together easily! I sprinkled powdered sugar instead of making the glaze. Sweet, tart, tangy, delicious! Thanks so much for this recipe. I'll be making these a lot.

I made these with gluten free flour and they were delish! Next time I would make the following changes:  there was too much crust for the amount of lime topping.  So I would either use less flour or a much larger baking dish and spread it thinner. Secondly I would use more limes- I used two and got a little over 1/3 cup but it would have been even better with more. Lastly I would eliminate the 1/4 c flour from the lime topping - totally not needed. It gave the lime mixture a floury taste which I didn't like. I didn't use the glaze - just sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Also, I used less white sugar than the recipe called for, based on what other reviewers suggested. I think I used maybe 1 1/4 cups - I wanted it tangy.   I baked at 325 F on convection setting and it was done in 20 min. 
Yummy!! Definitely one to try!

These were a big hit. I reduced the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups in the bars. I sprinkled 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar on the top. They were plenty sweet! I used all of the lime zest off of the two limes I used for the juice. Plenty of lime flavor.

The taste of the bar is very good but the size of the pan is wrong.  I put it in a 12x15 inch pan and it came out the size of a thin pancake.  The next time I make it I will use a smaller pan.

I love this twist on the traditional Lemon bars and my husband raved over them!! We live in the Carribean where limes are a local fruit and they added such a fresh, delicious flavor to the bars. I will certainly add this recipe to our list of family favorites. I would agree though, that the crust was a little too much for the ratio of lime mixture. But otherwise, its a great recipe.

I baked in a 10x7 glass dish. My biggest gripe with this recipe is the crust. There's just too much of it! I only used about half. MAYBE in a 12x15 it would've been alright, but even then, I feel it would be a lot (and the filling would have been non existent). My crust could have used another 4 or 5 minutes in the oven, also.
I cut the sugar down in the crust and filling (a little under 1/2c powdered and 3/4c reg) because my gut told me it was too much. Tasting the end result definitely makes me think that the listed amount of sugar would make this way too sweet. I also did not make the glaze because of this. I increased the juice and zest a bit, as many other people suggested.

Ultimately, I'd recommend backing off the sugar, making half the crust, and possibly double the filling, minus an egg or two.

This recipe was almost like any other lemon bar recipie. The lime bars are a nice creamy  delicious treat. However in my opinion I would have liked a bit more filling because it was too thin. Next time I would make these lime bars in a 9x12 inch pan. This way I would be able to have more of a limey taste. They were a bit heavy so I would only have one. If you are planning to make these lime bars make sure you don't cut them up before they have cooled fully. Otherwise the limebars will be very messy and they will not look presentable.

Def will make again!  Made as stated except used a 12 x 9 inch pan (thought they made mistake) and put tsp or 2 of lime zest in the crust.  Came out perfect... Didn't time cooking crust just pulled out when edges were nicely browned.  Poured in and cooked filling about 25 min until nicely browned (not barely but a nice toasty color). Sifted a bit of powered sugar on top.  
Just can't see how a 12 x 15 pan could work.... with 12 x 9 they seem perfect thickness for both crust and filling.  Yum!!

They looked right and smelled wonderful, but even after thorough chilling, they were liquid when sliced.   I may have to try again, because my family loves Key Lime.

My 14 year old daughter made these for the first time for a cookie exchange.  She wanted something different from the usual desserts.  These bars are great.  She followed the directions as written adding only a little more lime zest since we had it.  The family thought they were full of flavor and her friends really liked them also. This will be one of our "go to" recipes.  Enjoy! (P.S. I would encourage cooking the crust longer so it is brown and crisper.)

Wow, talk about good. These were a huge hit at our tailgate party. Sweet and tangy , and frankly I liked these a lot better than lemon bars. We didn't use the frosting and opted for the powder sugar dusting instead. Delicious and incredibly easy !

Don't accidentally bake them too long like I did. 20 minutes might be enough time... not 25 like the recipe says. All in all a good recipe that I would make again!

Very delicious! I actually didn't add any topping, and they were amazing as-is. I do have to say I had a 9x12 and just used as much crust as I thought I should (probably ended up omitting about a cup) and used the whole amount of filling, and the ratio was perfect for me. Thanks for the great recipe :)

We truly enjoyed this recipe.  I  have made it following the directions and for me was way too sweet but most liked it. i agree about leaving out the food coloring.  However the complaints people made over thick crust is there own doing. if you follow the directions and use a large pan equivalent to the recipe you get a nice thin crust. I  doubled the lime top because I wanted that part thicker.  So if your more about the thick buttery crust by all means use a smaller pan. I did make it with half the sugar in the filling and used Brummel and Brown Yogurt Spread in place of butter to help cut calories and sweetness. My husband loved them and said not to mess with the recipe. And no we don't top it with the glaze or even powdered sugar.

Perfect recipe super simple and easy to follow . They
 don’t need food coloring  so I skipped  that. 
Perfectly tart and sweet.

What a waste of my homegrown limes. Where do I start? The shortbread crust was so grainy that I felt like I was eating sugar granules. I used Irish butter for a better flavor but it was wasted on this. The lime filling was flavorful but way too sweet. l actually doubled the filling and was disappointed by the lurid green color and the overly sweet curd. Lime is supposed to have a tangy, tartness and sadly these were lacking. Then when they cooled and I cut them, as I lifted them out of the pan, the shortbread crust just fell away from the filling. I guess I will keep looking for a recipe that is worthy of my homegrown limes.

I will most likely make these again. I was reading a bunch of reviews that said to double the filling so I did, and it took double the time (which I didn't mind), but it was a tad bit too much; next time I will try making the filling plus another half batch.  For the crust I used a fake butter (I can't believe it's not butter) and oil (1/2 cup each) since I didn't want to use all the butter and it turned out pretty well.

Oh my goodness, these were absolutely delicious. For anyone else out there making something like this for the first time, don't worry if the crust is slightly bubbly when you first take it out.

I love this fabulous melt in your mouth delicious recipe, but do read the reviews first. I made just a few tweaks. I used the size pan the recipe calls for, and the amount of cookie base it calls for, but I doubled the amount of juice to 2/3 cup, because I had a beautiful lemon to use as well as the 1/3 cup of lime juice. The lemon-lime taste was amazing. I used the same amount of eggs, and sugar, lime zest, etc. This gave me a thick enough filling to be just right for the thickness of the cookie base. I used powdered sugar instead of the glaze. I got raves, and everyone went for seconds. I would make this again in a heartbeat!

i followed the recipe with only one exception, I had to use a 13 x 9 baking dish. The lime filling was rather bland, everyone  agreed it didn’t taste much like lime and was not tart at all. The filling does not need baking soda, it caused the filling to bubble and leave a top that looks over baked while the filling was still runny in the center of the pan. I even added a couple minuted to each bake  to compensate for slightly smaller pan. I will not use this ever again and stick with my beloved lemon bars from now on!

Way too sweet and not enough lime flavour. I recommend increasing lime and decreasing sugar. I used 1.25 cups sugar and it was still too sweet.

I'm giving it 4 stars since as written, I feel like it would not have been as good as the modifications I made.  Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 a cup of lime juice and a tablespoon of  lime zest and I still didn't find it  overly limey.  I think these would be even better with 1 and a half to two times the lime filling over top of the regular amount of crust.  I sprinkled powdered sugar over top instead of the glaze too.  The bars are really good, and next time I will try it with the additional filling and I think they will be even better!

This looked like a tasty alternative to a lemon bar and it turned out well.  I did add an additional tsp of lime zest to help the flavor pop.

The glaze came in too sweet, so that will need adjusting next time.  Also, if you can get something pliable out of 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar and 1 tbsp. of lime juice, you are awesome.  I needed to add 2 tbsps. of water to even get it to com out of the whisk, much less spread.

All in all, it's a winner.

I followed the recipe to the letter but for me and my family they were just too sweet.  I plan to make this again as I love lime but I think I could cut the sugar in the filling by 1/3 to half and it still be sweet enough.

I followed the recipe except for the glaze because I prefer plain powdered sugar. I like lime, but am not too crazy about these. I prefer lemon and much less or a bit sweeter crust. Won't make again.

Love the crust the first time I followed perfect
This time I cut the sugar for the filling to one cup instead of 2 was way to sweet the first time but just perfect with just one cup of sugar.  My husband loves them we have a lime tree so I will be making them often.

When i first started making the crust i realized i didn't have  the full 1/2 cup of confectioner sugar so i decided to just use what i had which was 1/4 of a cup of sugar so i made but it made dough not a crumble crust now is that how it's supposed to be? i have made this recipe once before but i couldn't remember how the crust looked so i dumped the first dough then i did it over again with 1/2 cup granulated sugar  so 1 you need 1/2 cup of butter or more sugar and flour and 2 a smaller pan the was no way i was going to be able to fit that amount of crust in that size pan i didn't have the size pan you called for so i used a 11 by 15 and i still could't get it spread out evenly

I followed the recipe exactly, it came out amazing. Might add a bit more lime juice to the glaze layer this time round. Yes, it's barely been finished and hubby and kids demanding that I make again! 13/1/17: Made it with more lime juice in the glaze.... huge hit! Just remember to score it while warm, cutting it later becomes difficult otherwise.

Made this exactly as recipe directed and everyone loved it. I baked it in a 9x12 pyrex at 325 because of the glass pan. Sooo good

These Lime  Bars are even better than Lemon Bars.  I made this as written except I used a 9 X 9 pan.... I prefer thicker bars.   I did use a little less crust... Maybe 1 1/2 cups flour and less butter... Baked the crust for 15 min.  added filling and baked 25 min. more.  I didn't use food coloring or the glaze... just dusted with powdered sugar... They were perfect!

Delicious and super easy. I didn't have green food coloring which I think would have made them look more attractive

These are a very good flavor. I gave only 3 stars because this does not make a 9X13 size! Should have read the reviews, too thin. I get annoyed with pictures that don't really represent the finished product. If I make again I would use a 9" pan or double the recipe.

I loved the tangy  taste of these bars!  A nice change from lemon bars, which I also love.  The lime glaze made a great addition.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to make it in a 9x13" pan, and to cut down on the amount of sugar in the filling from 2 c. to 1 1/2 cups.  I like the tart taste of limes to come through.  I also needed to add additional lime juice to the glaze to thin it out a bit.  I certainly will be making these again!

Easy to make and easier to eat.  I made these bars last night for the first time.  My hubby's favorite things are anything lime and he loved these.  Two thumbs up from both of us.

I used this recipe as a guide for making something low carb. Used almond powder instead of flour, omitted the butter (enough fat in the almond) bound with egg ( a bit too eggy tasting) used Splenda in place of the sugar.  Next time half the crust egg?

Made this recipe as written with fresh limes from my tree.  Found it to be very bland with little lime flavor.

These were sooo good!!! I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful. I brought them to a gathering and everyone loved them. They're so zingy and I think the thing that makes them stand out is the glaze, which I've never put on a citrus bar before - really added more of the lime flavor.  I just added a couple more Tbs lime juice since the 1 Tbs wasn't enough to moisten the amount of powdered sugar called for. Two thumbs up!

Delicious! I used key limes for a more intense lime taste and skipped the glaze. Everyone loved them.

I swear by these! OMG SOOOO GOOD! I didn't have sufficient lime zest and I do regret that but still came out soo beautiful and tasty. I will make these again for St. Patricks day for my co workers!
