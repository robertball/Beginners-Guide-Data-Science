This was simply amazing!  The only thing I did differently was that I used whatever salsa I had on hand and just added some chili powder to the chicken itself.  I also left out the corn and didnt use guacamole.  (we dont like it in our house.)  Definately a new favorite!

These were pretty good. I liked how easy the recipe was and the cream cheese certainly added an unique richness to our tacos.

Made this tonight and it came out fantastic. Made it with Spanish rice. Also added about a half cup of white onions, 11/2 teaspoons of cumin, and 11/2 teaspoons chili powder. Didn't use the cream cheese because I felt that was weird and replaced it with a Mexican cheese mix. Also served with chopped red onions and green peppers.

Instead of cream cheese I used Mexican cheese mix.  Also put in one sliced onion, chili peppers; and used Spanish rice (Knorr mix) instead of white rice.  Really great meal with cornbread to watch football game with group.  Put extra pico de gallo and guacamole on side to use as toppings for tacos

This was very tasty and great for feeding a crowd. I doubled the recipe but only used one brick of cream cheese.  There was quite a bit of liquid so I might add rice raw the next time.

I made slow cooker chicken tacos tonight and they were excellent made exactly as the recipe says. They were delicious. We fed 3 adults tonight and have enough taco meat for about 12 tacos  so we have leftovers. Served on flour tortillas.

I am not sure why so many people complained about it being runny, I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I did rinse the beans only because it would be too salty otherwise, and maybe that is why ours turned out perfect. I cook a lot and have never used undrained beans so I just assumed I was supposed to drain them. I always try the recipe as written before making changes, and this one is five stars as is. If I make changes the next time it would only be to add fresh garlic and maybe garnish with cilantro. This is going in my recipe rotation for sure

I left out the corn, beans and rice. Kept them separate. I doubled the chicken, added taco seasoning, chili powder, magic seasoning,mgreen chilies and diced tomatoes and reduced the salsa.  I pur√©ed the sauce and cream cheese together and served it separately. We had a chipotle thing going on.

I made this last night for dinner and my entire family - 2 teens and husband and I - LOVED it. I followed this almost exactly as written but I did not add the cream cheese because it was a very healthy dish without it.  I used a different brand of salsa and added a small can or green chiles and served this on corn tortillas and topped it with shredded cheddar cheese - it was flavorful and surprisingly amazing!

This is a really tasty recipe. I gave it 4 stars only because it was a little runny. I used flour tortilla shells instead of corn. I also added 1 pack of taco seasoning to the mix with a small bit of garlic. Great recipe! Will make again just have to figure out how to cut out some of the liquid,maybe cook raw rice in mix.

Ive made it as written and also with additions.  It's good.
I prefer to add canned chopped chilis and black olives.
I also use this recipe to stuff enchiladas.

Love this! Added Sazon Goya to the chicken  and used Spanish rice. Great for kids and adults. I use mild salsa for my toddlers and spicy hot for my teenagers. Household favorite!

This is a creative way to make tacos! I like to add onion, chili powder, garlic and cilantro to the mix, and omit the rice and cream cheese. I serve them with sharp cheddar, guacamole, sour cream, diced red peppers, and diced tomatoes on the side. My husband and I love them!

This was really easy to make and very yummy!  Made my own guac to serve with it.  I accidentally added the rice to the slow cooker at the beginning, and it still turned out OK.

This recipe was fantastic! I used a mixture of chicken breast and thighs because its what I had on hand. To reduce the amount of liquid I drained the black beans and corn.  When it came time to adding the cream cheese I was hesitant to add 8 oz so I added little by little and ended up only using 4 oz (that was perfect for our family). I will definitely make this again!

We ended up not adding the rice, and just strained out the liquid.  Delicious in tacos with chopped onions and avocados.  Plenty of leftovers and had them the next day with Puerto Rican rice.  Delicious and so easy to make!

Just made this. Wow!! Awesome flavor!! I cooked my Spanish rice from a package on the stovetop and added it to the crockpot with a small amount of liquid left in it to finish cooking it with everything else. I also added saut√©ed onions (family preference).  My husband loved it too!! Definitely a keeper in this house!! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a family favorite.  We've made it again and again.  We've found now that we prefer it without the cream cheese added...all it really does for us is make it into a paste and you don't get as much flavor from the chicken.  This recipe is now a staple in our house and a favorite of mine as it is SO easy!  A previous reviewer mentioned to add the instant rice uncooked with 30 minutes remaining.  The rice cooks in all the juices and the dish has a great overall texture.

These were quite good. I only used about 3/4 of a brick of cream cheese and served with homemade guacamole.  I forgot to put them in the slow cooker before going to work that day so I just chopped up the chicken and cooked in a sauce pan when I got home that night.

They were a hit!!  Followed the recipe with a couple exceptions.  I agree with marycl311, that they were a little runny so next time I'll drain just a smidge of the juice before serving.  Went through 10 corn taco shells and could have served about 20 more with what was left over. (Recipe exceptions: canned corn, picante salsa, cooked gourmet bean blend beans, no cream cheese, served with homemade guac).

The first time I made this, I thought it was a good idea and much simpler to throw everything in the crockpot and then, shred the chicken after done.  I, however, did not like the cream cheese.  After sitting, the mixture became too thick, whereas I wanted everything to be looser and identifiable.  I've used this recipe many times thereafter.  I just omit the cream cheese, then it's perfect for me and my family.

This is my new favorite taco recipe! I use homemade salsa in it and 4oz of cream cheese instead of 8oz and it is SO good! It makes a lot, so beware that you'll have left overs if you have a small family. My family with 2 adults and 2 small children can eat this for 3 or more meals! Which is not a bad thing!!!

We thought it was great! Had to sub lemon juice for lime and green chilis for the corn, but it's just the right amount of spice with the cream cheese!

This was GREAT!!!  I made it on the stove top with boneless chicken breasts.  I didn't add the rice because I didn't have any.  I didn't add the cream cheese because my hubby isn't a fan.  I believe it would be excellent with the cream cheese, though. I did add some sliced garlic & chopped onion.  Very, very tasty!! Something different!!!

Tried it last night and loved it. Lots of flavour and very tender chicken. As other reviewers suggested, I added 1 cup of uncooked minute rice to the slow cooker for the last 10 minutes, and it soaked up all the extra liquid. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 tsp chili powder. Skipped the cream cheese step because my husband is lactose intolerant and served it with grated sharp cheddar on the side. Will definitely make this again.

I used the salsa I had on hand instead of the dip suggested as well as twice the chicken...thinking that is why it came out a little bland...regardless this is a great basic recipe to add to...so easy in the slow cooker...I ate it with chips and avocado.

This recipe was amazing. All I did different was upped the sizes, used more chicken for more servings and so on. I also just used whatever brand salsa. Threw some chilli powder, and garlic powder in. Had friends sop by and we had plenty to feed everyone, and we have so much leftover. Didn't really need to double it!

This is a great recipe!!!!  I precooked my breasts for 25 min at 325 to speed up the process a little, was running behind!  I added a little more salsa and a small can of jalapenos......:)

Very good!  I doubled it and it made sooo much!  TOO much!!  I froze half of it and it thawed nicely, not mushy.

This was delicious! A few of the reviews mentioned that it was a bit runny, so I rinsed and drained the black beans and stuck with Wholly Salsa (seemed thicker than salsa from a jar). The resulting consistency was perfect. I used 1.5 lbs chicken breasts and topped each taco with a dollop of sour cream in lieu of the cream cheese, plus Wholly Guacamole, which this recipe was clearly designed for!

I did not add the cream cheese to the whole slow cooker. I added a little to a small portion separately. I am glad I did this because the cream cheese made a sticky and kind of pasty consistency. The chicken itself was a little bland even after adding chili powder and cumin. I took the advice of other reviewers and added raw rice to soak up the liquids. The rice kind of disappeared but I think it took away from the flavors of the dish. If I make this again I would not add rice or cream cheese.  Just ok.
