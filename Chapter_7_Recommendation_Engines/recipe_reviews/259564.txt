I would add extra apple for a better sweet and savory balance. My husband suggested trying puff pastry next time.

Made as directed.  Video made it super easy to understand how to fold these.  I'll be keeping the ingredients on hand.  I'd like to know what dipping sauce or gravy was used in the video, but these are delicious as is.  The only thing I added was a BIG GLASS OF COLD MILK.   Yum!  Great dinner.  Thx.

Top with Hatch Chili Jalape√±o Jam!  oh WOW
