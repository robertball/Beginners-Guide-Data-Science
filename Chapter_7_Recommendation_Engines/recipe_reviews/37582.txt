Very simple to make, tasty, and healthy if you use low-fat or fat-free ingredients.  Be sure to spread the cornbread batter thin unless you really, really like cornbread, otherwise, it's overpowering.  A large cookie sheet covered in foil worked really well.

I made this pizza for a family pizza party where awards where given for the best and worst pizza.  There were 13 pizzas entered into the competition.  Needless to say this one was the big winner.  It beat out a Buffalo chicken pizza that was delicioius!  I made a few changes though.  Before I put the second layer of cheese on; I layered on an 8 ounce package of Sour Cream.  Then I put the second layer of cheese on as well as some crumbled tortilla chips.  Then I baked it and topped with fresh lettuce and tomatoes.

Simple, fast and yummy.  A great week night dinner.  I made the mistake of trying to make on a pizza stone though.  Don't do this, the cornbread is difficult to spread and sticks.  Next time I will add extras like olives, peppers and onions.  Great dish.

I liked this recipe, but I had some trouble with the crust.  It was very crumbly and hard to serve.  Plus, I used a Jiffy cornbread mix and found it to be too sweet.  I think the next time I make it, I will use a biscuit mix and add some cornmeal.  I think that will make it less sweet and provide a bit more substance.

This was great.  I served with sour cream, salsa, shredded lettuce, and diced tomato on the side.  I used only 1 cup of the cheese on the top of the pizza only (to cut a few calories).  This is a keeper!!

My family enjoyed this change of pace.  Added sliced onions and black olives.  Also mixed pepperjack cheese with the cheddar.  Very spicy and good.  Will make again.

This was an interesting twist on the traditional taco dinner. My boyfriend said, "This is good. It might be better with regular pizza crust though." I personally like the cornbread crust and think smearing a very light layer of refried beans on the crust before topping it with meat would be a great addition. I also think this would be a great party food-- I might even make it for a Super Bowl Party!

This a great recipe - quick and easy!  I had leftovers from tacos earlier in the week and this was a great way to make it a new meal.  The sweet of the cornbread with the spicy taco seasonings were great together!

This was a great, filling recipe -- and one you can "doctor" in many ways -- I added black beans and a bunch of other toppings...Yum!

I thought this was pretty tasty.  I did add some black beans, as one of the other reviewers noted.  My 4 y.o. daughter thought it smelled fabulous but didn't want to eat it.  I think most kids would love the taco flavor.  I didn't get the cornbread spread thin enough so it was a little messy to eat, but I'll make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy to make, however the cornbread mix has a sweetness to it and throws the flavor of the pizza off.  The pizza would also taste better if you put a layer of refried beans on as a 'sauce'.

If you're in the mood for Mexican, you'll want to try this recipe. I used 2 envelopes of Betty Crocker corn bread mix & cooked in a jelly roll pan. I substituted ground turkey, used way more cheese than called for (we love cheese)& served with chopped lettuce, tomato, salsa & sour cream on the side. It's the type of pizza you have to eat with a fork. If you like cornbread, definitely a must. I took leftovers to work & had to print the recipe for all my co-workers. Thanks

My whole family enjoyed this!I lightened it up by only using half the meat(and that was ground turkey breast)and light cheese.I also used some leftover green enchilada sauce as pizza sauce and tossed some sliced black olives on.I'm looking forward to making this again and fooling around with the toppings some more!

When I make this I have sides of lettuce, tomatoes, onion, etc. a lot like when we have tacos.  Everyone adds what they like best. It is always a big hit especially with the teenagers.

We love this recipe in my house. One change that a lot of people might like is using crescent roll dough instead of making cornbread. All you do is open the package and bake. no mixing needed and its not too sweet either

A definite winner.  We liked it very much.  I added a little green onion to the beef and it was great!  I will do this one again.

I love cornbread! But I should have realized after reading the reviews that my Jiffy mix wouldn't be appropriate, it is too sweet for this recipe. I know Marie Callendar mix is very sweet too. I think I'll try this again with a non-sweet cornbread from scratch recipe. I think it would be good also with one of the cornbread recipes that have green chiles added. Like Italian style pizza, this recipe is perfect for getting creative with topping choices.

This just wasn't good.  The crust didn't go well with the toppings.  Maybe it was the taco mix I used.  My taco loving son told me not to fix it again.  Sorry.

Really good and super easy!  As per other reviewers: made in 13x9, spread refried beans with fresh cilantro and lime juice over crust, and added sour cream and taco sauce.  I was afraid how it would turn out, but it was great.

Taking previous posted advice, I made cornbread from scratch.  Unfortunately, it was a sweet recipe.  Additionally, I didn't have a large round pan, so I used a 10-in pie plate.  The cornbread was too thick.  Other than that it was great, I also added a layer of refried beans.  Next time I'll probably use a 13x9 pan.

As other reviewers suggested, I added a layer of refried beans... also used half of a from-scratch cornbread recipe instead of from a box, so maybe mine was not too sweet as others mentioned.  We thought this was yummy!

Very simple and quick to make. I cooked the meat while the crust was baking. I used a generic corn muffin mix. I liked the sweetness of the crust. My whole family liked it except for my one picky son, but I know it'll grow on him. I will definitely be making this again.

This is so good.  We make it all the time.  I do a variety of toppings each time including: black olives, avacado, garden fresh tomatoes when in season, onions, shredded lettuce, hot cheese sauce, jalepenos and shredded cheeses.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Its filling, cheap and easy to throw together.

This was really good and the kids loved it..including the grown up kids. :) The only change I made was while the corn bread was baking, I heated a can of re-fried beans, then when crust was cooled just a bit, spread the beans on like pizza sauce...then assembled as normal. Served avocado slices on the side. A keeper for sure.

I think the problem with this recipe as others have stated is finding the right cornbread.  I used a packaged jalapeno flavored but the grainy texture ruined the topping.  Not worth trying again sorry.
