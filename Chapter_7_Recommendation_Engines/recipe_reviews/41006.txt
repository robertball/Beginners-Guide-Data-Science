I make this cake every year for my husband's birthday (Christmas Eve.) Once I made this, he will accept no substitutes. He loves spice cake, but this has much more texture and is "meatier" and is well worth the time.  
For the frosting, I use a plain cream cheese frosting, although my teenager likes it best just as is.
