I had one bag of rhubarb in the freezer from last year's harvest. I drained it in a sieve overnight to make sure it was somewhat dry. I found the dough very dry I added one more egg which was perfect. I pressed 3/4 into the pan then put it in the fridge with the topping portion to chill. I sprinkled the rhubarb over the base then sprinkled the topping then sprinkled with 1 tbsp of vanilla sugar. I skipped the extra sugar and butter as it was not necessary. Baking time was 40 minutes in my oven. We enjoyed this cake my Omi made kuchen all the time with whatever fruit was in season. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #InternationalFavourites #FacelessNoMore

Very simple to make and a great way to enjoy rhubarb! It turns out like a crumble but with a cookie-like base on the bottom. 

I didn't have vanilla sugar, but I don't think I needed it. I also used a normal cake tin - just made sure I greased it really well with butter. I'm so glad I did because it came out of the tin nicely when I did a quick flip.

Will make it again!
