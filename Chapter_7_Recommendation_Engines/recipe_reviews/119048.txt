What a gem of a recipe! We really lucked out on this one, and quite by accident. Since we were leaving town I looked for something to make use of things already in the fridge. The other criteria was that I wanted something light, especially with no heavy cream sauces or cheese. Wow... we just loved this. It was light, healthy, fresh, and simply delicious. I used cod loins and omitted the green pepper because I thought it might overpower the delicate taste of the fish, and I believe I was correct. Didn't have orange juice, so I just used lemon juice and I actually think I  prefer that too. I added a little chopped fresh parsley and minced garlic to the vegetable mixture, and olive oil rather than butter. I served it with "Brazilian White Rice" (also from this site) and sauteed baby spinach. In addition to being delicious, it was a beautiful presentation. Thanks for sharing your recipe Shannon!

This was absolutely wonderful!! I did use lemon juice as other reviewers suggested, and replaced butter with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray. A Couple minutes before fish was completely cooked, I uncovered it, sprinkled with parmesan cheese, and turned oven up to broil, so cheese could brown. I will make this again & again!!

With the lemon pepper seasoning, I left out the salt. I had colored bell peppers, so I used those. Topped with some pepperjack cheese instead of Parmesan. Also, I would recommend olive oil instead of the butter.

DELICIOUS! I didn't have lemon-pepper seasoning, so I sprinkled some lemon zest on the fillets along with S & P. Used cod fillets and omitted green pepper. As per previous suggestions, I substituted olive oil for butter and lemon juice for orange. I also added 2 cloves of chopped garlic plus a little dried parsley. Served over hot brown rice. What a delicious, healthy meal! This recipe will become one of our favorites. Thanks for sharing.

What a fantastic dish!  I used a red snapper filet and did not have orange juice, so subbed lemon juice as noted by others.  I also used evoo in place of the butter and minced a clove of garlic into my veggie mix.  I did leave out the green pepper and used fresh chives in place of the green onion.  This turned out so well, such a nice light dish and thanks to naples34102, served over Brazilian White Rice...so yummy!

This was awesome! I made a few alterations, that I read from other comments. I omitted the tomatoes, green peepers and butter.  I added julienned yellow zucchini, red peppers, minced garlic and fresh thymes.  I also used lemon juice instead of OJ. I prepared all the veggies (added more than a 1/4 cup of each veggie) and marinated with lemon juice, a little olive oil and the thyme for about an hour. I sprayed the dish with a little Pam; I donâ€™t think I needed to do that, I guess it depends on kind of fish you use. I served it with couscous and green beans.

This was very good!  I took the advice from several reviewers and added garlic and fresh herbs to the veggies and replaced the orange juice with the juice from one lemon.  I loved the diversity of this recipe and all the different veggies you could use.  (I added eggplant and yellow squash.)  It tasted like a ratatouille on top of the fish.  I only baked it for 22 minutes and it could have used about 5 minutes more.  Yum!

I made a few small modifications based off of some of the reviews saying it was a bit bland.  Along with the lemon pepper seasoning I added a dash of Cajun seasoning and then I also added thyme and minced garlic to the veggie mix.  Added some shredded parmesan cheese instead of the grated and omitted the butter all together.

This was the best fish I have ever made. I used cod fish and salmon and followed the recipe closely. The only changes I made was that I used lemon juice instead of oj because I didn't have any oj. I also had no green onion so I had used some yellow onion. I also didn't measure very accurately but got the general theme correct. I served it with steamed asparagus. Again, this was the bestest(if there is such a word) fish I have ever made! Thank you Shannon.

Very nice! I didn't have lemon pepper so I just dredged the fish through some lime juice and sprinkled it heavily with fresh ground pepper. Then followed the recipe as stated.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a great dish for entertaining. It was easy, I just chopped everything ahead of time. The only changes I made was to use lemon juice instead of orange, and add garlic and parsley. I mixed all of that with the veggies and put it in the fridge until I was ready for it. It kind of marinated, which I think helped the flavor. Very easy and delicious. Skipped the parm.

Used cod and this was very yummy.  I did end up cooking it about 10 minutes longer than called for.

Flavorful and relatively healthy.  I omitted the green pepper (didn't have any) but doubled all the other veggies.  I also subbed lemon juice for orange - good tip!  Served with a boxed side of mixed brown rice and bulgur for a quick, light dinner.

I made this with cod. Didnt add the additional salt b/c lemon-pepper seasoning had salt. Sub olive oil for the butter and didnt add the parm cheese. Good dish and a nice way to use up veggies.

This was fantastic. I opted out of mushrooms since I am not a fan. But the dish was delicious and healty. Love the idea of adding orange juice to the butter. Gave it a great flavor.

Super easy, super fast, good flavor and fresh taste. Passed the 2 yr old test (he likes fished if cooked to his liking). I don't like lemon pepper so used a pepper medley instead and didn't have any OJ so used V8 Fusion Peach-Mango juice.

I made this recipe with Tilapia fillets following the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. I've always been nervous to try cooking fish and this was a great way to start. I served it with brown rice that I cooked in low sodium chicken stock and seasoned with rosemary and thyme, and steamed broccoli.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!  I'll be making this again soon.

I never thought this recipe would be a favorite, but we loved it. We did exchange the lemon-pepper with seafood seasoning, just because I don't have lemon-pepper. Also we used tilipia instead of orange roughy. Still, a great recipe!

I follow Naples advice and use lemon juice and olive oil in place of orange juice and butter (and stir them right into the bowl of veggies). I left out green bell pepper, but used a bit of yellow bell pepper in it's place, since it's milder and doubled the mushrooms. When I don't have green onion I use dried chives, about 1 tbsp. I always add chopped spinach, dried parsley and plenty of minced garlic to the mix. I served it with the Brazilian Rice (made with chicken broth) and sprinkled just a bit of parmesan on top of it all. Since I'm generous with the veggies, I eyeball the lemon pepper and salt. Super good, I have made this so many times. Thanks for the recipe Shannon, and thanks for the great suggestions Naples!

My husband and i liked it, but the kids didn't think too much of it. We didn't have any green peppers, but we both agreed that it wouldn't have helped it. I really seasoned it well with the lemon pepper and salt and it baked up easily in 20 mins. I loved the zest of the tomatoes.

Fantastic!  I didn't have any green peppers and like others suggested, I used lemon juice instead of OJ.  I also didn't use any butter, but instead used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray (0 calories and does the trick).

My wife and I started a low fat low carb diet for the new year.  I prepared the recipe as directed EXCEPT I used extra virgin olive oil in place of the butter.  It was fantastic and smelled wonderful.

We really enjoyed this one! I did have to add more fresh herbs and seasoning, but I do that for most dishes! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I too, substituted lemon juice for the orange juice.  I also followed suit and omitted the green bell pepper but added garlic and parsely.  It was AMAZING!  My husband despises baked fish, but he loved this recipe!  We will make this often!!

This was so fast and easy and really, REALLY good. My fiance doesn't like white fish, and even he liked this enough to eat all the leftovers!
