This was quick and easy, but more importantly it was really good.  I used buckwheat pancake mix and 1 1/2 tsp of dried onions since that is what I had. I will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

I love potato pancakes but don't always have time for the traditional recipe. This one is very easy and has a good taste. I minced rather than chop the onion. If you need a quick side dish I would recommend these. Try adding some fresh herbs. Thanks for sharing.

We LOVE these pancakes! There was definitely a learning curve to cooking them as the thick texture of the batter makes them cook faster on the outside than the inside. Really simple, delicious potato pancakes.

These were great! I added some celery salt & dillweed. We never manage to have leftover mashed potatoes & we don't care for instant, but these turned out great we will be making these often.

I made a few alterations. I don't like cheese and my husband doesn't like onions...so...
 
1/4 dry pancake mix
3/4 instant potatoes
1 cup 2% milk
1 egg beaten
1/2 tsp. garlic salt
1/2 tsp. onion powder
salt and pepper to taste

I let it sit to long and it got thick so I just added a little more milk to make it the right texture. I added 1 tsp. extra virgin olive oil to the pan. 

They were perfect!! Brought back memories of childhood. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is a great potato pancake. I wanted it to be less pancake and more potato so I added more "flavor" with scallions instead of onions, more garlic salt & pepper.

Yum, these are delicious.  Perfect with a green salad, a dollop of sour cream or baked beans.

I must have done wrong, because all they were but pancakes. The taste was good, though. Only, my kids said they resembled more mashed potatoes with cheese tossed about in a skillet than pancakes: and in fact I wonder how you coul wrap 'em around anything, seeing my result.

These are a staple at my Elk Camp each year.  Absolutely a winner.  Some of my hunters ask for a tad more onion and the addition of jalapeno peppers.  But as written, this recipe is outstanding.  Thank you.

Followed the recipe and it turned out great!  Definately watch the pan temperature - medium heat is the key to crisp outsides and steamy/soft insides.

Pretty good!  I followed the recipe.  I topped pancakes with sour cream.  These would be good with a poached egg. Will
Make again and try serving with applesauce like another reviewer suggested.

These were very simple and fantastic. I followed the directions while mixing but did end up adding about another 1/8 C of flakes in the end because it was too runny. Next time will add more garlic and and chives. I also fried each side longer because they weren't crispy enough for us. Overall we all loved them and will definitely make them again. Thanks for the recipe.

Soooo good! I used left over diced potatoes and blended the mixture with a handheld mixer to mash the potatoes a tad. Great recipe!

I LOVED this recipe and so did my two toddlers (especially once I gave them some sour cream to dip them in)!  I made it "as-is" except I only had garlic flavored potatoes so I just left out the additional garlic powder.  I will definitely make these again!

Delicious!!! I used a prepackaged flavored instant potato mix because that was all I had on hand.  I increased the bisquick and milk (and a little extra cheese never hurts!) to account for the 1 cup of instant potatoes that came in the mix. I also used green onions instead of regular onion. I didn't add much additional seasoning due to the potatoes already being flavored.  Super easy and will definitely be making these again!

These turned out more like potato cakes than pancakes.  However, the flavour and texture are very good.  These are quick and easy to prepare without the mess and hassle involved in my regular potato pancakes.  The serving size was perfect for two people.  Although my DH isn't a big potato pancake fan, he really enjoyed these.  We will be eating them often.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great -  I cut back the milk and added shredded zucchini. Serve with a dash of hot sauce.
