Fabulous!  I stuck to the instructions and this was well received by my friends at the annual "chocolate party."  Although expensive to make, it's well worth the money - you won't be disappointed.  FYI - Baker's Chocolate is sold in boxes of 6 squares - I needed two boxes to have the 8 squares needed to make the recipe.  I think I will try the bulk store next time!.

This pie was so easy to make so well.  Delicious smooth texture and great flavor. 
The next time I make it, I'm going to try making the crust with almonds instead of pecans (my husband prefers them) and add a little more white chocolate to the filling.  I also grabbed 1 pkg of raspberry Milanos and one pkg of regular.  I'll use the called for amount of regular cookies in the crust, but use the raspberry ones to go around the edge.  The pie is really fantastic without any changes though.  For those who haven't made it before, I would make it per the original recipe, then make changes the next time around if you want them.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

The taste was good as was the presentation but the filling never set.  I followed the directions as written but it had the consistency of pudding.  I guess looking back on the ingredients I don't see what would actually make it firm up.
