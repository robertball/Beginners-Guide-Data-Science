This drink is really good.  if you like the flavor of gin and lime it is a recipe to try.  Several other people who tried it liked it also.

A good drink that's quick to make and a great starter for mixologists.
For the best results (and for the love of all things holy) use real limes for the lime juice, not that green lime-shaped bottle with the twist cap. If you have guests, rolling, slicing, and hand-juicing the limes gives a bit of show and makes the drink that much more personal. Not to mention it makes you feel more like you look like you know what you're doing. You cool bartender, you.
We bumped up the lime juice to 1/4 cup- about two lime's worth. Good for when you top off with a whole can of Sprite.

One of my favourite drinks of all time.
I make this relatively unknown drink slightly differently. I don't use triple sec. Instead, I add just a splash of orange juice or twist of orange. I also no longer use sweetened soda, opting instead for either club or tap water and a touch of sugar. The result is a much cleaner, fresher tasting drink. Give a try.
Oh, yum. Now I need one! So perfect for a hot summer day.

Great summertime drink.  We had a bartender a the Harrah's Casino in San Diego make this exact recipe and the blend is perfect. 

Caution - they sneak up on you!  

Enjoy!
