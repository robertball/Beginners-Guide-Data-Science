The recipe didn't say to toast the sesame seeds, so I didn't. They really need to be. I strained the dressing and started over. It was much better. As NanLan suggested, adjust the sugar to your liking. For me, the half a cup was too much. I would start with a quarter cup  next time.

Favorite salad dressing ever! But! You need a little sesame oil to make it 5 stars!
