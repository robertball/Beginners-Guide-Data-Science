I LOVED THIS RECIPE ALTHOUGH NO ONE IN MY FAMILY WAS NOT CRAZY ABOUT IT, THEY ARE NOT FANS OF EASTR INDIAN FOOD.  i FOUND THAT i PREFERED THIS SOUP A LITTLE SMOOTHER AND I PUREED IT IN THE BLENDER.  IT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE LENTIL SOUP SERVED AT MY FAVORITE EAST INDIAN RESTAURANT.

Turned out pretty good! But I did nix the peas and substituted it w/ mushrooms... learned couple cooking lessons there... oy. Just had to add more liquid ingredients to make up for the mushrooms. Will probably make it in the future again.

A tasty quick and nutritional soup.  I really liked the thickness added by the cornstarch.  I added a little chili garlic sauce to crank up the heat a notch.  Next time I'm chopping some garlic and throwing it in with the green onion and peppers.

Very good! And I don't like tofu! Well, at least I THOUGHT I didn't! I loved, loved, loved the snow peas, but the winner here was the broth! I am a huge fan of Pho noodle soup. I'll be trading out the tofu for shirataki noodles and shredded chicken next time. :) Thank you!
