This is a wonderful summertime side dish with all of its fresh veggies.  The dressing is sweet and tangy -- a nice change from the mayo based versions.  My only gripe is that the prep time is a lot longer than stated.  I knew it would be as I wanted to take the extra time too to cut things up nice and small so it would be visually appealing.  The pasta also holds up great with this dressing.  Definitely make the night before so all of the flavors have a chance to really soak in.

My husband and I enjoyed this pasta dish.  It has great flavor like no other pasta salad we have had.  I used Paul Newman's Italian dressing with it and it was great.  I hope others will enjoy this dish also.

My husband and I found it very delicious. It was my first time making a pasta salad. We prefer a little less Catalina dressing and more Italian.

This salad has a great tangy flavor - I will make it again!  Unless you are serving this to a large crowd, you might want to cut the recipe in half. I had a ton left over.

It was very good and something different than the usual summer salads.  It tastes like a spaghetti salad...the only thing I did different was add some mozarella cheese.

I used Kraft Tuscan House Italian and this was so good!  The pasta turns pink which can be off putting to some people, but once they realize it's Catalina dressing they love it!  I omitted the bell peppers as we do not care for them.

YUM! def. a new favorite!!!! The only change I made was I didn't add onion or black olives, and switched the measurment on catalina and italian dressings. It made enough to take to a party and still have leftovers. If you don't want leftovers def. reduce the servings!!!! Oh and I also used shells pasta instead of penne

Delicious! I had this at a recent potluck, and I was searching for a similar recipe. This is much better! The dressing is great. I strayed from the recipe a bit and added feta cheese but it would have probably been better without it. A+, this is my new go-to pasta salad.

Followed recipe as described except that I omitted the celery salt and carrots (don't like either). Came out great! Definitely will be making this again.

Made this recipe to the letter and found it to be just average. Taste was ok, not the really great recipe I was hoping for. Won't bother to make it again.

The salad turns pink from the dressing.  The dressing is overpowering.  I think a basic italian would be much better

I could see why this would be a crowd favorite at potlucks, but it was a bit too sweet for us (I anticipated that due to the extra sugar plus Catalina dressing).  I do recommend making it the night before as the directions state, and it is extremely visually appealing.  While I wouldn't consider this my go-to Summer pasta salad, it is a nice change from mayo based salads.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The blend of vinegar, sugar, Catalina and Italian dressing created flavors that I didn't care for. won't make it again.

This sounded great and looks beautiful but I'm not crazy about the taste.  Next time I will definitely not add the sugar and I will probably use less catalina.  It was too sweet for my liking.
