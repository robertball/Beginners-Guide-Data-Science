I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was good, but I felt that 1cup of peach preserve was too much.  The peach taste was too strong, but it also could have been the type of preserve I used.

My husband says it's the best sweet potato pie he has ever had!  I used a mixture of apricot preserves and orange marmalade instead of the peach preserves and it was great!

A real "husband-pleaser"!  Just bake 2 extra sweet potatoes and turn them into a dessert.

This was OK, but no big whoop at my house.
