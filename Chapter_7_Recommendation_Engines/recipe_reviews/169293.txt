I LOVED this!  I am not a ranch fanatic, but I made this because my husband is.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written.  And it turned out fantastic!  Also tastes just as good the next day for leftovers.  This one is a definite keeper!

These were fantastic! I made exactly as directed, but added onions. So good and even my picky eater gobbled them up! Thanks for the recipe!

I actually turned this into a casserole, didn't have time to roll the enchilada's, so I tore the tortillas into fourths and layered everything. Made this in a hurry for dinner and I forgot the ranch dressing! But it was still good! I served some Green Chili Salsa Verde on top.

I made this using: 4 C shredded, cooked chicken breasts, 1 C Ranch Dressing from bottle (Hidden Valley is Best), 1/2 C Sour Cream, the green chilies, 1/2-2/3 C Tostito's Med. or Hot Salsa, and the cheese mixed together & divided (using 1/2 in Chicken mixture & other half to top the enchiladas before baking) .These are the BEST Enchiladas my Family & I have EVER eaten!! This Yields: between 14-17 Enchiladas depending on how much filling is used.

So good!  My daughter loved these and she doesn't like regular enchilladas.  I made a couple of changes.  I used corn tortillas lightly fried in grease and instead of green chilles i used some salsa.  I added extra cheese to.  very good will definately make again.

Sauce (with only 8 oz sour cream)  is awesome!  Add a teaspoon or so of chipotle chile powder, can't go wrong!

Pretty good recipe, but the sauce itself is too thick and the ranch taste was overpowering. Next time I will only use half of the ranch called for, and thin the sauce down a little bit.

Saw all the good reviews this got so I tried this recipe, but was sorely disappointed. I am only giving this two stars because my husband and daughter said it was "OK", but personally I didn't like this at all. Way too much sour cream flavor in this, which is probably why because I am not a big sour cream fan. It also seemed to be missing something but am not sure what. Maybe a more cheesy sauce would help it? I'm not sure but I don't plan to try it again.

Very good. I did season the chicken breast with onion powder, Morton's Nature's Seasoning, and salt. I cooked whole then shredded when cooled. It makes a lot of sauce, but thats no big deal. Family really enjoyed these. Very easy. I will make these again. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I used salsa instead of green chilies and cheddar cheese instead of the Mexican cheese blend.   I thinned out the sauce to pour over the top with some milk.  My whole family enjoyed them!

Really easy recipe, with great results. One reccomendation- i used the Hidden Valley "fiesta ranch dip" mix rather than the dressing mix, not a good idea, a little too rich and thick. Once I made it with the correct mix, it was great!

Awesome! Never had such a quiet night at the dinner table. Even the pickiest eater asked for seconds. A little bit bland, but maybe that's because I left out the chiles. We also made due with one sour cream and it was super tasty. Thanks for the idea!

This was ok.  Way too salty.  I think I would cut the amount of ranch and maybe use a lower sodium soup.  Sause was way too thick.  I thought it was missing something...not enough variations in flavor to merit the time of assembling enchiladas.  Would be better as a casserole.

I really enjoyed this but it isn't "real" enchiladas like we get here.  They have a weird tang to them but still tasty. I will probably try another recipe next time but worth trying.

Ok as is, but sauce is too thick without diluting with milk as others suggested.  I added seasonings to the chicken, salt, pepper, cilantro and cumin, otherwise I can’t imagine it being anything but bland!  I thought a whole pot of ranch just physically seemed too much.  Half was really plenty.  In tasting the sauce before using it had no kick.  Maybe this isn’t supposed to be a Mexican dish, but I added some salsa to it, and would have added some chopped chipotle if I’d had it.  At least after the salsa was added, the sauce had some zip.  I will make again but with my adjustments, and perhaps add some beans, corn, &/or sautéed onion.

I followed the recipe this time. The casserole is tasty, but the sour cream is a bit overpowering. Next  time will cut back on sour cream and add chopped olives on the top of the enchiladas.

Simple, filling, and surprisingly flavorful. I wasn't expecting much from such a simple recipe, just a good, solid quick dinner. 
Have to admit was pleasantly surprised. 
I had to tweak it a bit and add some green chili's and used spicy ranch mix the 2nd time I made it.. both were good, just depends if you want something a little more zippy or not.

Tried it the first time and loved it! As we like things a bit spicy used the Fiesta Ranch dips mix and it really added a nice big of spice.

Our family loved this dish and the difference of the ranch dressing in it.

I made it just as the recipe instructed....except I used boneless thighs and breasts. The recipe was really good. My husband liked it also.

This is my first review on any recipe and I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great ! The kids (who are picky) had seconds. Will definitely start using this.

I stuck with the recipe only subbing plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I’m not to crazy about the ranch taste, probably an acquired taste and I’m not at the point of loving it.

Mine is very similar, but I add veggies such as onion, peppers, garlic and maybe celery (all sautéed first) to add a nutritional element!!  I like it better with 4 ounces of cream cheese in place of the sour cream/ranch and i serve it with guac. and pico de gallo of course!!  Yum!

I did not use all of the sour cream as needed some as a topping along with salsa sauce and some guacamole.

I made this with fried corn tortillas and flour tortillas. The corn was much better. I also added  some water to the sauce to make it thinner. I should have added even more. Also, cilantro is a must for Mexican dishes. I didn't use canned chiles but fresh Anaheim peppers. Overall I call this a gringo enchilada.

Very easy and tasty. I cut back on the chilies as hubby doesn't like spicy. I will make this again.

Family favorite. I use shredded chicken and mix it in the sauce and it is just as good.

My family loved it! I did it a little different. I didn't roll up the tortillas like enchiladas instead layered like lasagna. Bottom layer a little of the sour cream sauce, 2 tortillas, more sauce then the chicken which I had prepared in the crockpot, and cheese. I repeated this and then topped with 2 more tortillas, leftover sauce and more cheese.

For us, it worked better with 8oz sour cream and 8oz whole milk to thin it out a little and 1/2 packet or ranch powder was enough.  We've had this twice so far and like it enough to make it again with changes as stated.

This was a bit hit! I feel I didn't have enough sauce so next time I think I will add another half a can of the soup and half a container of sour cream and some more ranch. We love our cheese so we put the whole pound in! Thanks for the great meal idea!

I didn't use the Ranch dressing.  Added some fried onions, tomatillo salsa verde and chopped garlic.  My family loved it!!!
