This was excellent Guacamole.  I did add one ingredient that wasn't included in the original recipe; cilantro. It turned an already delicious recipe into a "restaurant" quality dish.

This is your standard, no-fail guacamole right here.  Nothing pretentious or stuffy, like a lot of the guacamole 'recipes' you run into on the internet.  Basic ingredients, full-flavor results.

My husaband and I ate a whole mixture of this in one night.  I did leave the seeds in for extra spice, but it was great and so easy. I also mixed it with a homemade salsa for another dish, not so spicy this time, the kids even loved it and its so good for them.

Very similar to our family recipe, but we use scallions in place of onion, more lime juice, or lemon juice, a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, one whole minced or sliced jalapeno, and lots of cilantro.  You can use jarred salsa too, in a pinch.  Garnish with a dusting of red pepper flakes.

Rarely Give a 5 Star :)

First let me say I rarely give a 5 star as that is "Thank God for this!" food.  That said, this is pretty good stuff.  I gave it a 4.5 but spouse gave it a 3 as it was "too oniony".  I did use 4 medium avocados and will probably cut the onions a little next time.  Overall, a very good starter recipe that can be customized for your (or your spouse's) tastes.

i made this to go with take out churriso burritos from the best little taco stand in our city. there was a huge gang of us and they'd run out of guacamole because it was so late in the day and only half of the group got some. i served this recipe which yielded lots of delicious guacamole. everyone ate mine instead! everyone i know has and makes this recipe now.

This is an excellent recipe, but to make it a 5 star one, ditch the onions and add cilantro and green onions. Very Yummy!

Excellent!  Never liked guacamole but the freshness makes all the difference!  Had this for lunch on fish tacos - YUM!  I did have to substitute lemon for lime and used red onion as I decided to make this at the last minute and had to use what was on hand.  Still came out great - can't wait to serve at our next party!

This is a great formula for guacamole and tastes even better after it's been in the fridge for at least an hour so the flavors can blend.

This is a quick and simple guacamole recipe that is easily modified to suit different tastes. For my family, I use twice the tomatoes (seeded) and a small garlic clove. I love that this recipe uses none of the fillers (mayo, sour cream, cream cheese, etc.) that detract from the wonderful taste of the avocado.

Delicious!  I used red onion and added some cilantro as recommended by a previous reviewer.  We ate it with Authentic Mexican Tortillas, also from this website.  Fantastic!

I actually followed this recipe pretty much exactly.  I usually am tempted to mess with them and end up with something that may be good but then I can't remember what I did that made it good.  This one turned out well and I don't have to remember since I didn't change anything, much.  Just a bit more tomato and jalapeno and a little less onion.  Served it over cheese and bean quesadillas topped with a dollop of sour cream.  Absolutely as good as you will find in any good Mexican restaurant.

Followed advice and added more tomato (1 med., drained on paper towel) and
5 green onions, chopped.  Used 2 dashes
of red pepper, 1 T of lime juice and 1 T
of dried cilantro.  Allowed flavors to 
blend for 2 hrs--it was faboulous!!!

I really enjoyed this guacamole. I did not use all the ingredients for the recipe, just what I had on hand. I used 3 perfectly ripe avacados, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of diced onion (eyeballed it), 1 clove of garlic minced, a dash of lime, and a dash of coriander. I only omitted the tomato and jalapeno/harbenero because I did not have it on hand. This was a very delicious recipe. It was also very easy to make. I will definitely make it again.
