Sorry, but I found this to be extremely bland as written. I had to add alot of spices, onions and extra chives to get any flavor out of it.

Made the first batch as written (plus a little salt) and really liked it. Made the second batch using half sour cream/half ranch dressing, and loved it. This is just my kind of potato salad - quick, easy, and best of all, tasty (I'm not a fan of those 'everything but the kitchen sink' potato salad recipes). Thanks!

This recipe is almost identical to the potato salad recipe my mom made when I was a young girl.  I use russet potatoes instead of red potatoes and lots of chopped onions.  I have never added the chives but I think they would be a yummy addition!  The key to this potato salad is to make it the day before and let the flavors blend overnight in the fridge.  Everytime we have a picnic/potluck and I bring this everyone wants the recipe and it gets gobbled up FAST!!!  The onions and letting is sit overnight are key to bringing out the flavors of this creamy potato salad.

This is my all time favorite potato salad recipe. Mainly because I hate potato salad and this is more like baked potato in a bowl. :) 

I add bacon and cheddar cheese and also dice my potatoes. Delicious!

Whoa, dressing and chive overload alert!  This ultimately was very good, but it can’t be overstated that it’s because I used roughly just half of both the chives and the dressing.  The only way you could use this much of both is if you also used double the amount of potatoes! I believe my photo illustrates that using just half the amount of each coated the potatoes nicely with just the right amount of dressing and chives. I’m surprised none of the other reviewers commented on this. Rather than just plain salt I used Jane’s Krazy Mixed Up Salt, a good, all purpose salt seasoning.  I also added some finely chopped red bell pepper for a little contrast in texture and color.  I did not use the additional chopped fresh chives for garnish as was indicated. Holy moly, no way! If I would have prepared the recipe as directed I don’t think I could rate this any more than two stars as the potatoes would have been swimming in dressing!  Reducing the amount of sour cream and mayo and chives by nearly half (with no additional chives for garnish!) elevates a 2-star rating to 4 stars.  Creamy and delicious, a nice departure from potato salad with the usual list of other add-ins.

This is very yummy, but I found there was way too much “dressing” for the potatoes. I actually doubled the potatoes and it seemed about right to me.

Just got finished putting together this yummy potato salad, and it's in the fridge 'melding'.    I did have to try some after getting all ingredients together, and WOW!!  This is really to die for!!  (or maybe to 'live' for is better:) I did alter it somewhat, added some green onion and garlic and also threw in some green pepper as I wanted to use one up.  To the dressing I added some ranch dressing just to give it some more zing. Husband doesn't like 'regular' potato salad (who doesn't like regular potato salad?) so I went with trying this one on him because to me, it seemed more like baked potato salad.  I hope he likes it, but if not, I will probably finish it all by myself!  Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe!!

Very good. I used 1/2 the amount of sour cream and added a splash of apple cider vinegar. A go to recipe because of the easy preparation and always have fresh chives available.

Tried this mainly because I had a larger container of sour cream to use. It turned out to be the perfect side dish for my weekend dinner. The taste is light and clean without the heaviness mayonnaise adds. Adding other ingredients would make it a much different recipe.
My menu was grilled pork chops with red barbeque sauce, grilled zucchini, and tossed green salad with orange basil vinaigrette. Had corn on the cob for dessert.
P.S. I grow my own fresh chives so that helps.
