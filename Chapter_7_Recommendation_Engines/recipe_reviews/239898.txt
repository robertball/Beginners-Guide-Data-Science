Made one change; I used roasted turkey instead of chicken.  I love the simplicity of this recipe, and these 0 cholesterol noodles were tasty.   I used Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock which IMO is the best. Just be sure to use a really good-quality stock/broth if you're not using homemade.  This comes together quickly, and I definitely will be making this again.  •••••UPDATE 1.13.18•••••  This is my go-to recipe for chicken noodle soup, and it’s definitely soup weather now.  I’ve never bought a rotisserie chicken and probably never will.  It seems far easier to me to just cook a boneless/skinless chicken breast in my Instant Pot®, shred the meat, and add the broth left from cooking to the chicken stock.  We love carrots, and I always add extra carrots and celery.

I thought this was pretty good and I liked the ease of using the rotisserie chicken. I realized after I started making the recipes that it wasn't 4 cups of water but actually 16 cups (4 quarts). When I got to the liquid part I added 8 cups, what I could fit in my 3" tall pot, and then 4 more cups right before it was finished. For the amount of noodles and chicken, I used, it seemed fine. I cooked the onions until almost soft and then sautéed the carrots and celery with it for a few minutes, too, before adding the liquid. When I added the first 8 cups of water I did 2 Tblsp plus 2 tsp of low-sodium vegetable paste. I didn't have chicken broth and wanted to use less sodium anyhow. I find bay leaf to be strong in flavor, so I just used 1 leaf instead of 2. I didn't have a sprig of time, so I used 1/4 tsp. dried. Other seasonings I added were a pinch of pepper, garlic salt, and dried parsley at the end. For the meat I just did 2 cups of rotisserie and pretty much all white meat. I weighed the regular egg noodles, I had leftover from another recipe, and it was 5 oz or 2 3/4 cup and that also worked good. I also simmered it a little longer than suggested to ensure the vegetables were soft and to have it warm for dinner. I would make this again. I got about 7 servings, and made as is, at 187 calories per bowl. ty

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly! Our family of four enjoyed this soup for lunches over a few days of "at home sick time". Perfect comfort food!

I liked this very much. Totally simple for an on the go family that doesn't have time to roast their own rotisserie chicken and/or cook a chicken and make fresh stock with herbs and spices. It's what I normally do for my family. This recipe totally cuts down the prep. While the recipe was so simple, I felt it lacked in the flavor department just a tad. So I added additional dried herbs to bring out the broth flavor more. About 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning and that did it total justice. The best part of the recipe was the noodles, I've used the No Yolks before and they never stick to each other and the never get gummy the next day or soak up the broth in make you add more. Love the fact I can over cook them and the noodles get super large and still retain perfectness. TY pretty good in my books.

Halving the recipe, I used homemade broth, cooked my own chicken and left out the garlic. This was a good, basic chicken noodle soup. It needs more vegetables for my taste and we only got two bowls of soup before ending up with next to no broth. Either the noodles kept soaking it up or it doesn't call for enough broth. This happens when I use pasta but from the reviews I thought these noodles would be different. They have a good texture so I'd use them again but I guess I'll go back to cooking my noodles separately.

This is a great basic soup recipe. I used my own turkey broth and leftover turkey meat instead of chicken. All other items I kept the same. Very tasty, and perfect for the head cold that I'm starting to get.

I eat a lot of soup and chicken noodle is one i feel should be kept simple and straight forward and that is exactly what this one is. What impressed me even more was the NO YOLKS noodles. Unless you are feeding a large number of people, you're always going to have leftovers when you make a big pot of soup and leftover soups with noodles can be challenging. Not with these noodles! They stopped absorbing the broth as soon as the soup was cool and my leftovers were just as good as when it first came off of the stove. I will never use any other noodle again when making soup!

First cooked 4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs in olive oil with garlic and onion.  Once done, I added 1/2 bunch of baby kale leaves, a dash of turmeric, a handful of flat leaf parsley and 1/2 quart of bone broth   This added a little more nutrition.  I let it simmer on low for 5 hours.  Added No Yolks noodles at last 30 minutes. Not only does my home smell delicious on this stormy, Winter day, but this NoYolks soup tastes SO good!

I enjoyed this recipe but would suggest using 3 quarts of chicken broth which seemed plenty.

The entire family loved it!  I used leftover grilled chicken breasts from the weekend, which gave a bit of a flavor oomph.  Also added some bok choy as it needed to be used up.  It was a hit in this house!

I believe that minimal and simple ingredients make the best chicken soup and this recipe fits the bill!   You get flavorful broth with just a few vegetables and tons of chicken and noodles.  I love the No Yolks noodles because they don't get mushy and have a great texture.  This was a comforting and hearty soup and perfect on a snowy winter's day.

This is everything chicken noodle soup should be:  easy to make, simple ingredients and tasty!   I like lots of noodles in my soup, so I did add in quite a bit more NoYolk noodles than called for it was just what I wanted.   Kudos to the NoYolk people for making a healthier product that still tastes great.

Easy, delicious recipe... added the 4th quart of stock at the end of the cooking time and let it rest for about 30 minutes. Also used 12 oz of No Yolks. Added sweet peas to the soup as well.

Make sure not to use an excessive amount of noodles, otherwise  all of the liquid will get absorbed by the noodles. I also like to use more carrots and celery than the recipe calls for because I prefer my soup chunky. And I used thighs instead of chicken breast, chicken breast is dry.

This was very delicious. My whole family gobbled it up. It also makes a ton so we have leftovers for another day/night. I did end up using my chopper for all of the veggies. I could also only get 4 14.5 ounce cans of chicken broth from the store, so I used water for the rest of the liquid. It was still really delicious and flavorful. Adding in salt and pepper before serving helped to bring out the flavors. I will definitely make this again.

Amazing- better than homemade. My husband and mother in law both said it’s the best they’ve ever had. I used regular egg noodles, 2 rotisserie chickens and only the breast meat. Wow!!!

Delicious. I used 2 quarts chicken stock from carton and 2 quarts broth made with cubes. I also loaded up the soup with carrots and celery (personal choice). The rotisserie chicken gives it a lot of flavor.

Five stars with the following changes.  After sautéing the onion and garlic, I added the rest of the ingredients ( but not the  carrots and chicken) and simmered for 30 minutes.  Then I strained the broth for a clear appearance and added the chicken and the carrots and simmered this  until the carrots were cooked. I cooked the noodles separately (personal preference) and served the soup in bowls over a portion of cooked noodles. Delightful soup! I Thank you NO YOKES(R) ! Oh yes, I added a few slices of peeled ginger and a touch of cayenne at the initial simmer.

Really good quicker version of chicken noodle soup.  I usually use a whole (raw) chicken but it takes half of the day to make!  I did double the carrots and celery because I like a lot of veggies.

I have made this several times. It's quick and easy and delicious! The only change I have made was I used spaghetti instead of egg noodles because that was what I had in the pantry. Very tasty and will use this again and again and again...

This recipe was good, but I didn't have fresh tyme so the dried tyme made it kind of strong. If I make it again, I will add less onion and use fresh herbs.

Good recipe. I didn't have the no yolks noodles so I used 2min noodles and they were fine.

Very good! I minced the veggies for my family, but the soup was good and restorative. The noodles were perfect. For a little added kick, add a dried, smoked chipotle or two and remove right before serving.
