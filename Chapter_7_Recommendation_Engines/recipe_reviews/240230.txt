We thought this was good! The only thing I did different was to use 4 raw potatoes cubed, because I didn't have the hash browns. It worked just fine and tasted yummy. Next time I will probably add onions, mushrooms, and green peppers for more flavor.

Great recipe! Skipped the mustard..  I used the Obrien Hash Browns that had peppers and onions already in it and  added pepper jack cheese to the cheddar cheese to add a little spice to this.  It was a hit for the office breakfast.  I also used the casserole crockpot which is not as deep as a regular crockpot.  I cooked it for 5.5 hours and it was perfect.

we liked this.  It is a great basic recipe for breakfast casserole.  Perfect for our Christmas potluck where picky kids didn't have to pick anything out of it!  we 1/2 it and layered so cheese and meat, potatoes were in the middle.  yummy!

Loved this recipe and so did my family. I forgot to defrost the hash browns (it was Christmas Eve!) and I used O'brien potatoes with the peppers and onions already in them. Even though the potatoes were still frozen this cooked very well. This recipe is also so versatile that you can add any seasoning to your family's taste, I added garlic because that is what my family loves! Thanks for making Christmas morning so nice for my family and so effortless for me.

This was a hit at the office party and I will definitely make it again.  I added sautéed onion and red pepper to the thawed hash browns.  I also omitted the ground mustard and added several dashes of curry powder to the eggs.  To make the eggs a bit fluffier, I used a 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup water instead of the 1 cup of milk.  I reserved a third of the cheese to melt on top when the dish was done.  It was very moist and flavorful!  This is a great base recipe that can be made to taste with vegetables, meat, and seasonings of your choosing .  This is the first time I made a breakfast casserole in the crock pot and I am very pleased with the result.  It took 5 hours on low in my oblong crockpot.

I used lbs of sausage and cooked on low for 6 hours with frozen hashrowns.  Will try another type of cheese next time.  Cheddar didn't melt well.  Made it for camping with a group and all agreed that I need to keep this recipe!!

This recipe was good, but a bit dry. I agree that the cheese should be dispersed throughout the layers. I would also use about half of the hash brown potatoes.

This was super simple to throw together. I added some garlic as others had suggested. Rated 4 stars only because the dish was still a little bland. But for a group, it works well, especially with kids. Great for camping as so easy to prepare. The adults jazzed it up by topping with salsa. Will add onions & more spices next time. Thanks for sharing- it's a keeper!

Was my first time making this - I was nervous it would not be finished in time so I started early.  It only took 3 hours to cook (so it was finished 3 hours too early).  I layered the hash browns, cheese and sausage throughout and added cheese at the top when it was finished.  Also I used hash browns that had garlic and onion in the bag. Initial taste when it was finished - pretty good.  Next time I will put mushrooms and spinach in the mix with it. Today am serving it with warm tortillas

Everyone really liked this dish. It was easy to prepare and delicious. Next time I would add onion and green peppers. I will also divide the cheese layer. It was too much melted cheese all in the same place. Overall I really enjoyed this dish and probably won't wait until next Christmas to make it again.

I will try to mix everything instead of layering them on top of each other and maybe add more cheese on top. Sticking with the recipe, everything  stayed separated in layers.

This is perfect for a “breakfast for dinner” potluck.  I made it for a high school team dinner and didn’t have any left.

I substituted in turkey sausage, fat free cheddar shreds, and unsweetened almond milk. It took 150 calories off and allowed for a bigger portion. Still tasted great!

Great no fail for groups...   I second what someone said earlier - limit the potato layer...  I had a thick potato layer and so that part was more dry than rest.

This recipe was super easy! The only thing that would make it easier is pre-cooked sausage.
I made it for a pot luck food day we did at work. EVERYONE wanted the recipe!  I used mild sausage for the varying tastes of the crowd, but added Frank's Red Hot to my plate as it needed a little zip. I also added broccoli because I felt it needed a veggie.
I plan to use hotter sausage and spinach this weekend when I make it for our nephew who is sleeping over  : )

This is great!    I make it for our church men's prayer breakfast.  It is gluten free so everyone can enjoy it.  It is a hit and very easy. I double everything except the cheese.  Only issue,  In my crockpot, the back side gets scorched no matter how long I cook it...usually 6 hrs on low. I also spray the crockpot first too.  Could just be my crockpot  though.

I go camping almost every weekend and there are usually 4-5 people for breakfast.  I usually do the cooking in my motor home for everyone.  This is the easiest recipe and everyone loved it.  The variations are unlimited.   No changes are needed.

Overall, a good base recipe. There is plenty of freedom to add what you like. I wish I would have used a casserole crock pot to thin out the layers. Used some of the suggestions from other reviews . I put the hash browns into  a preheated crock on high to crisp them up a bit. Partially browned the bulk breakfast sausage to allow some of the fat to absorb into the potatoes. Added some finely cubed ham to the egg mixture and also mixed some into to the potatoes. Bacon crumbles between the egg and cheese. Aerating the eggs really helped them fluff up. Extra salt, pepper,  and some red pepper flakes into both the eggs and the potatoes. 
Overall, good tasting but the sections are too thick to get all ingredients in a single bite.

It was OK, We put it in the crock pot the night before around 11PM and ate around 10:30 AM the next morning.  That is too long on the crock pot so it wasn't as good is I am sure it probably should be if cooked for a shorter time.

I made this over the weekend while camping, and it was a huge hit. I added a little seasoning to it (onion powder, parsley, etc.) however, I personally thought it was a little bland, but again the group loved it!

This recipe is always a hit with a crowd and I love that I can cook it overnight.  I followed some other suggestions and layer the potatoes, sausage and cheese and use the O'Brien onion and pepper potatoes.  This is easy and no fail!

Loved this recipe. Next time I'll either layer the cheese throughout or just reduce the amount of cheese.
