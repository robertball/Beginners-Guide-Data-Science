I just made this for my family and it is wonderful!! I would recommend cooking the chicken onion and peppers in the oil and butter before you add the potatoes. Awesome under an hour dinner!!

I used O’Brian potatoes with onions and peppers already in it, so didn’t have to chop veggies. Sautéed the chicken with Montreal seasoning and a dash of soy sauce, set it aside and cooked the potatoes in the same pan. Added cooked chicken to cooked potatoes to heat through. Threw in some frozen/thawed corn with the cheese instead of broccoli. Very tasty.

Kids and hubby loved this! Unfortunately, I didn't have the green veggies. I used less oil and less butter and I used cooked dark meat chicken.

So I changed this recipe a bit and found it to be delicious! I roasted some brussel sprouts with garlic and onion and then used this as the vegetable instead of the brocollini or peppers. It was delicious!
