A creamy, subtle-flavored dish. DO NOT USE REGULAR PEANUT BUTTER- the sugar will ruin it! The tomato and squash provide naturally sweet undertones, while the garlic, onion and bay leaf infuse the sauce with a savory flavor. I was intrigued by this recipe, and thankfully all 10 of us enjoyed it =) Not to tamper with the "traditional flavor... but I enjoyed this with hot sauce, and imagine that a minced jalapeno sauteed with the onions, or perhaps some red pepper flakes, could add a lot to this dish. Oh, and some chopped cilantro would be excellent too. Thanks for sharing, Anne-Marie!

This was only ok.  I had planned on making something else when I came across this recipe.  I had baked the squash completely.  I was unsure about how much the 2" cube should have been cooked anyway.  I didn't have natural peanut butter and I used regular peanut butter.  That could have made it a little on the sweet side.  I combined the garlic, salt, and peanut butter sauce all together.  I think I liked it more than my boyfriend did.  Thanx for posting this interesting/unique recipe!

This was really good!  Instead of boiling the butternut squash which makes you lose a lot of the vitamins in the water, I put it on a cookie sheet in the oven with a little olive oil mixed in at 475 degrees for 20-25 minutes.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I served it with quinoa.

I searched this site for just the ingredients I happened to have on hand, and I made Guinean Peanut Sauce with Butternut Squash with folete sauce. (Yes, I always have frozen okra on hand.)  It was easy and fast, and it tastes like home.  I love it!!!!

It was really good!  Don't be turned off by the ingredients.  My three kids saw what I was making and were very hesitant to try to eat the dish but they liked it.  I followed the baking instructions for the squash provided by another reviewer.  We ate it with sriracha.  Super yummy!

If I could rate this recipe any lower, I would have. I followed it to the letter and used the correct type of peanut butter, and the result was a bland, sloppy mess. Increasing the amount of salt and pepper did nothing to improve the blandness; it just covered the taste by making the swill too salty and peppery.

Delicious!  Reminded me of ground nut stew. Toss some tabasco or sriracha on to give it a kick.

What a delicious, filling, and healthy dish!  Truly is pure comfort food.  I served this over brown rice with greens sauteed with olive oil, sliced mushrooms, and garlic with a splash of soy sauce and rice vinegar.  So yummy!

Read the reviews and hesitated before making this dish. Ultimately I went ahead and made it as we have harvested two bushels of butternut squash this year. Followed the recipe exactly (which I rarely do) and 2 out of 3 of us thought it was great while the 3rd thought it was ok. A nice creamy sauce with well blended, if subtle, flavors.

I love it. It's one of my favorites. I use tomato powder cause we have e lots of dehydrated tomato powder for  long term  term storage of tomatoes.Also I add more water while it is cooking. I  usually do on the stove top and that is especially good that I have done it in the Crock-Pot which is helpful not having to stand in front of stove and it is pretty good.

I like this a lot! If you like satay, you will like this! Very easy (and cheap!) I made it exactly as stated and the whole family enjoyed it.

I was unpleasantly surprised by the lack of flavor in this dish. The peanut butter overwhelmed the squash and all other ingredients.

Made with soy nut butter and it was a mistake. I think this would be excellent with sunbutter tho.
