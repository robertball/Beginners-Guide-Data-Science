I made this vegetarian, using vegetable broth instead of chicken.  This is one of the most delicious soups I have ever eaten!  I will certainly be making this one over and over again.

My family is a big fan of lentil soup but they were skeptical when I tried something new. My husband was irritated by the carrots and tomatoes, but he turned out to love it and they gave it a very nice sweet flavor. I followed according to recipe but I also added a ham hock for flavor.

A lovely herby lentil soup, I really like the tomatoes in this one.  Next time I will use more garlic, add some celery and up the seasoning some.

Added celery and diced ham, used stock from hambone.  Also, I ALWAYS soak my lentils in water with a bit of apple cider vinegar for 12-24 hours prior to cooking.  Makes them more tender and easier to digest.  YUM.

Very nice and tastey. I had to make some substitutions since the cupboards were a bit bare.
Used herbs de provence for spices and had no tomatoes so I used a can of condensed tomato soup. Threw in a ham bone and it came out great, reheated very nicely the next day too and as is the case for so many soups and sauces allowed to sit overnight, tasted even better.

I made this soup during Ramadan. It was a nice winner in our house especially with my husband. The only changes i made was i used middle eastern soup spices that is  famous here. And it gave the soup a very nice taste as well as aroma. This soup is very filling after fasting. Thanks Joyce! :0)

love it perfect for an fall day, and because I live alone.  I love to make a big portion then eat it for a few days.  I added potatoes i needed to use and a bit of garlic.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make. It's also very affordable :)  I followed some of the other recommendations and added celery and made sure to cut the carrots into small pieces.  I topped mine with a dollop of sour cream.

Wow, this is a fantastic soup! Our carrot pieces were too large, so it really boiled down a lot by the time the carrots were done (maybe +1 hr). Has a mild, sweet taste. Delicious!

Great soup, I read the other reviews and decided to add a can of green chile/diced tomatoes, but then decided to add curry powder. I used tomato puree and water instead of chicken broth (wanted vegetarian) and tomatoes since I didn't have any. It was just a little spicy for my daughter from the chiles but the rest of us loved it. We also topped it with sour cream, delicious.

This was delicious! I added celery and a can of diced tomatoes and chilies, instead of tomatoes. I used 4 cups of broth and 4 cups of water. Yummo!

My family didn't really like it.  I thought it was okay.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used canned but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was easy to make.

Really good soup! I added water throughout simmering because it kept boiling away. I didn't have marjoram, so I substituted sage instead. I also added salt. I'll definitely make it again.

Good stuff. Good for you too. Can't wait until it's not so dang hot out so I can make it again.
