First time  making it, I made as is.  It was okay but I could tell it could be better.  Second time making it, I added chopped bacon, fresh ground peppercorns, caramelized onions, and a generous dash of nutmeg.  Excellent!

Very nice, creamy texture!  I've made this about 5 times now and have realized that putting twice the recommended amount of  truffle oil and adding some finely chopped mushrooms before baking makes this dish extra tasty!

The recipe was ok.. There was a huge amount of cheese versus pasta, so you definitely have to make the breadcrumb topping. I felt the cheese sauce was a little bland & even though I heavily salted my pasta, it didn't help the recipe very much.  I had a very good white truffle oil and it didn't really elevate the flavor as I had hoped. I would add a bit more for that lovely truffle flavor.

I halved the cheddar cheese and doubled the amount of bread crumbs (panko) and parmesan cheese for the topping. So good!

I used cream cheese in place of swiss and Velveeta in place of cheddar because it melts so well.  It was wonderful.  

To the leftovers I added meatballs and it was even better.  This a great base dish you can easily build on and modify. Just make sure the cheese you pick welts well.

I used truffle butter instead of regular butter and added mushrooms with a bit of sherry. This is an excellent dish and was very well received.

Loved this mac and cheese. I wasn't able to find smoked Gouda so I used regular. Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs because some of the reviews said they thought it was bland. Can't wait to make this for New Years Eve for my family in Cali. When we visit.

I have been making this recipe for thanksgiving and Christmas for about 3 years now and every year my family makes sure to ask me if I will be making it because they all love it so much, especially the little ones. It has become a staple at our holiday table.

I added some havarti and I mixed the truffle oil in with the cooked pasta before I tossed it in the cheese sauce. I will make it over and over again.

3/3 kids didn’t like it. My husband and I didn’t mind it and will eat the leftovers, but I won’t be making it again. Swiss is an acquired taste and it’s unfamiliar flavor wasn’t appreciated by the kids (11, 8, 4).

I truly can't imagine a more disgusting version of mac n cheese.  The smoked gouda totally pervades and ruins the entire thing.  I made a double batch for a party, and after having my entire family taste test it, I am throwing the whole thing in the garbage. Gross.

I made this for my solo Thanksgiving.  I reduced the serving to 8 on the app.  I bought everything but the truffle oil and the breadcrumbs.  I feel the all purpose flour and butter didn’t mix well.  It was real clumpy and I ended up mushing it out clump by clump when I added the milk.  There was a lot of cheese milk so I ended up letting it sit overnight to cool and decide if I should add the remaining noodles from the box which I did anyway.

It was a bit bland, but my family enjoyed it (supposedly) I think they were trying to spare my feelings. I think the Swiss cheese was the culprit. Next time around I'll omit the Swiss cheese and add something else, maybe gruyere.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was super creamy & cheesy!  My Husband loved it and had 2 big helpings.  I didn't have Truffle Oil so I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  And in addition to the Parmesan and (Italian) Breadcrumb mixture, I topped it with crushed Cheddar flavored French Onion Crisps.... it added a great crispy flavor!

Great flavor. Very versatile andrecipe. My only changes were the substitution of unsweetened applesauce for oil and apple butter and less sugar.

I added pepper to taste, sliced jalapeños and and a half pound bacon crumbles, and used smoked Gouda to give this recipe a kick! Yum!

Great recipe! I added pepper in with the sauce and since I couldn't find truffle oil I used extra virgin olive oil. Not sure if that's a normal substitute, but it tasted great to us!
