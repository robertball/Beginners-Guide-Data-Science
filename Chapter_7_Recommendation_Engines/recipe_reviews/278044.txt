No changes. First time I made it and I always follow recipe precisely 1st time I make it. “Red Lobster” night. Had crab legs , cod and this recipe. I usually make scallops, but Sams was out. This was by far the easiest of the 3 and also the best.  And I just used frozen bag of shrimp from Kroger.  We will certainly make again!!
