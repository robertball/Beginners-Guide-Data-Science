Very good! I got a free sample of the worcestershire pepper in the mail, so I decided to try this. I had the end roast of a whole pork loin that didn't cut into very nice chops, so I decided to cube it. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly (aside from doubling it and adding a little more of the pepper). Served over sauteed mushrooms. Yum. Thanks!

Yummm! I (mostly) followed the recipe and found a great new way to make pork chops. I didn't have the Worcestershire pepper blend so I just went with what I had on hand.  I put some smoked sea salt and pepper on each side of the pork chops first and then browned them up.  After that I followed the recipe except that I added a little Worchestershire sauce and chicken broth to the sauce just to have more of it.  Then I set the heat down to low and let the pork chops slow cook for an hour so they would be really moist.  I served them with some mashed potatoes and the sauce made for an awesome gravy!  Will definitely be making these again!
