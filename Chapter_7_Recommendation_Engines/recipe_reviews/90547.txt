Close, but not entirely authentic. Add parsley (about 1/2 cup finely chopped) and mint. Ironically dried mint (labeled as mint flakes in traditional grocery stores) works best - 1 or 2 tbsp. Also, for clarification, red onion not white onion. While lemon juice is typically used in this dish in northern Iran, try it southern style with lime juice instead. It adds a little more zing. We usually use at least one (if not two) freshly squeezed lemon/lime; 1 tbsp is too little.  Finally, let the salad refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to blend the flavors. This salad makes a great accompaniment to Middle Eastern dishes such as kabob, kofta, falafel, donair, etc, but also try it with steak or carne asada. Yum.

Living in a Persian household for many years, we have changed this recipe & it is even better.
Finely chop dill, italian parsley and mint, red pepper,red onion, persian cucumber (all a small dice) tomatoes are optional  Instead of Lemon juice, use Japanese rice wine... what flavor!

This is a traditional dish that all Persians have had in their lifetime. The only thing missing is chopped mint, which brings the whole dish together!

There were a couple of things I knew wouldn’t appeal to me in this recipe so I took the liberty of making a few modifications.  I decided for the purpose of what I intended this salad for that it would be easier to eat, and prettier to boot, if it wasn't all chopped up.  I used fresh crisp baby cucumbers, sliced, and tiny grape tomatoes.  Since I’m having dinner guests tonight and not familiar with their tastes, I played it safe and left out the onion.  Finally, with just salt and a little lemon juice, I knew this would be rather flat and lifeless in my view.  I had some homemade lemon-dill vinaigrette left over which worked ideally with the addition of even more dill.  The salad now is delicious - light, fresh and nicely enhanced with the dill, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper and Dijon mustard in the vinaigrette.  I’m sure my guests will love it.  I suppose my alterations effectively changed the authenticity of this salad (one I’m not familiar with) but I was quite pleased to use the recipe as a base reference for my own tweaks.  As is, however, I can’t rate it any more than average, as it lacks any real character or flavor distinction.

Fresh and crunchy. The only thing I added was some chopped mint because that is how I had it at a Persian restaurant. It tastes more authentic!

So refreshing and healthy!!!!  It was well worth all the effort of dicing and chopping.  Took other viewers advice and added dill, mint, parsley, red pepper and used the red onion.  Next time I am going to try the Japanese Rice Wine, but to me the flavor was out of this world even using the lemon juice.  With all the compliments I got, I felt like taking a bow...but really SABUYUKCAN and all the helpful reviewers ought to be the ones to do it!!!  Thanks so much for a keeper.

served this a few weeks ago with 'Lamb Shawarma' from this site, and they were both great. i love simple, clean recipes like this; the fact that it's both delicious on its own AND easy to customize to your own tastes makes it five-star worthy, nothing less.

I love how healthy & delicious this is !!!  I added a good handful of minced fresh mint & about half a handful of minced fresh italian parsley.  I topped with feta.  I recommend that you serve with a slotted spoon &/or place in a different bowl (after draining) before serving.  I accompanied this with baked pita triangles.

This is good and pretty quick to make especially when there isn't any lettuce in the house. It has a very fresh taste. I made 1/2 the recipe and still got nearly the same amount of servings. I think an unpeeled English cucumber and a red onion would work best, but the recipe as is works fine to if made right before eating. I found that it does not refridgerate well at all, as the lemon juice will turn it sour after sitting too long, so I would only make the amount that can be eaten in one meal.

This was very delicious, but I felt it was missing something. I think next time, I'll add feta cheese to it, as other reviews suggested.
*9-19-07*EDIT: I made this again, this time topped with feta cheese, mint leaves, and some parsley. This makes all the difference! So delicious, try it!

Excellent, refreshing salad.  Use a slotted spoon to serve, as the salt brings out the juices of the vegetables.  Whole family enjoyed, even kids, although I did use less onion than recipe called for.

Shirazi Salad is a staple in our house - (hubby is Persian).
I add a few dashes of Red Wine Vinegar, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and use about 2-3 Tablespoons of Lemon Juice instead of 1 Teaspoon - I also add dried mint!
Fantastic flavors!

Hi
In Iran, we make it in summer time.
for better taste, add some olive oil and black pepper. some grounded dried mint leaves can make it better too!

This was great!  Reminds me of my favorite Greek salad.  I added dried oregano for a little more flavor.  Great summer salad without oil.

Shirazi Salad (called "Salad Shirazi" in Iran) is a classic Iranian (Persian) salad. I soak my onion in the lemon juice with a tad of honey before adding the other ingredients to take the "skunky" taste off the onion (preferably a sweet onion) as I always do; however, Iranians do not do that. Iranians also commonly make this salad with lime juice (instead of lemon juice), including a very sour bottled lime juice available from the Iranian grocery store. I personally seed my cucumbers and tomatoes before chopping them. The vegetable pieces be chopped to about the size of peas for an authentic salad (no large pieces - Iranians eat with a fork and tablespoon - no knives). Dried mint, powdered by rubbing it between the fingers, is an optional ingredient in the classic version. I myself prefer peppermint over spearmint for the stronger taste. Iranians commonly serving this salad in small 3 ounce cups (not usually on the main dinner plate). Thank you SABUYUKCAN for sharing your recipe.

I am a big fan of shirazi salad and accompany it with almost anything!  This recipe is missing the parsley and mint.  I prefer lime juice since it's a bit more tangy than lemon and feel 1 tablespoon is simply not enough.  1 or 2 limes would be best and please, please, please use red onion.

Rather than dice all the veggies, I sliced cucumbers and onions thin. This also helped them soak up more dressing. I whisked lemon juice with olive oil to create a dressing that stuck better. I wanted to made a Greek salad except I did not have bell peppers or feta cheese. This turned out to be a good alternative.

This is easy to make and I let it marinate over night. The picture shows sliced cucumbers; but the recipe says to dice them. I have done it both ways and it is fine either way. I do, however, cut back on the onion and I usually use a red onion. I am not a big fan of raw onions. I have also added celery sometimes. It is a refreshing light salad.

When you serve a salad nearly every dinner, you're always looking for something a little different.  We really enjoyed this simple, 5 ingredient salad.  I added chopped parsley and next time will use mint.  It has a very fresh, cleansing taste.

I rather add verjuice than lemon juice.

This recipe needed alot of tweeking.  For starters, true Shirazi Salad has mint and parsley.  Red onion gives it the truer flavor and as a personal preference I use a clove of fresh garlic and fresh ground pepper.
