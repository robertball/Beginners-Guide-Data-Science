This is a very rich chocolate dessert but I am a chocoholic!  I threw all the ingredients in a blender, then froze in a glass dish stirring every 1/2 hour.  When it was done, I found it to need another 1 1/2 cups of water.  I used 1 tsp. almond extract in place of amaretto.  Thank you Warning Monkey Bites for sharing.  UPDATE:  I froze the mixture in popsicle molds and it was awesome!

This was okay as is for my adult tastes. However, since I made it for my dairy-allergic son, the amaretto just didn't work. I will try it again but with vanilla extract next time.

Really good flavor!  I mixed the ingredients in a sauce pan over some heat to dissolve the sugar and cocoa powder then chilled and froze as instructed.  It was quite soft though, so next time I may only add 1 Tbsp of amaretto to see if it sets up firmer.  Really delicious though - very rich.

Very tasty, though I did change it, I used the bones of this recipe. I used 3/4 cups sugar, 3/4 cup of crushed raspberries, an extra 1/4 cup of water, and a handful of chocolate chips chopped up. Turned out really good. We ate it all, though it could easily serve 4 or 5.

I substituted 2 tbs vanilla for the amaretto and it never froze, I wound up with more of a chocolate syrup mixture. It's very chocolately, more like dark chocolate, I think I'll use a milk chocolate powder next time.
