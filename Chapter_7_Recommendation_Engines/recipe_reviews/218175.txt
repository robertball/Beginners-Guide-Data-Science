These are really yummy with a bit of kick!!  I used boiled chicken breasts and fresh veggies like spinach and shredded cabbage in the center.  My husband and I both really enjoyed them!

Great! I loved these wraps.  I put shredded cabbage and green lettuce leaves in mine as well to add some veggies.  They are a tad spicy, but not too much.  Perfect for a quick lunch recipe!!!

I really liked these! Surprised that I couldn't find pad Thai sauce in my grocery store, so I used a really good Thai sweet chili sauce and it was delicious. You can do so many different things with this super easy recipe, I added chopped peanuts to my individual wrap and liked the additional crunch. Guess you could do the same thing just using crunchy peanut butter, but my kids wouldn't like that. Try this recipe!

My family thought this was a good - extremely quick weekday meal.  Family liked it.  Husband suggested putting ingredients on tostada shells or pizza.  I just put chicken in the crockpot all day, shredded and threw it all together.

Awesome, quick weeknight meal! I used whole wheat tortillas and reduced fat Jif to lighten it up and broccoli slaw with carrot to bring in some heftier veggies. It was delicious. Like others, I cooked the chicken myself and used shredded chicken. That way we were sure to have enough.

The flavor was ok, but I recommend more chicken. There was very little chicken in the first 3 wraps I made, and none left over for the fourth one!

Yummy! I didn't have the pad thai sauce, so I mixed coconut milk, yellow curry, powdered garlic, ginger and salt, I also used a little bit less peanut butter. It turned out wonderful.

Super delicious chicken wrap recipe. Has a little bit of a kick to it but nothing crazy in my opinion. I added in some shredded carrot and some cabbage. I also left the lettuce out and substituted with some fresh spinach. I prefer fresh spinach over lettuce on almost anything. The sauce matched up really well with the wrap. These are quick and easy to make, as well. Very tasty, I give it 5 stars.

very good, quick, and easy. Maybe use less peanut butter next time. It was almost too much?
