Took a bit longer than 5min for glaze to thicken.  Tastes great.

These were good but had a heck of a time trying to find apricot.  Its in the juice section of the store.  Seem to be too much apricot, I would cut down on it next time.  This is a keeper.

I made this for our Mother's Day meal (glazed ham) and everyone loved them.  Since it was for a crowd I doubled the carrots and all ingredients except for honey and I only used one can (11.5 oz.) of the apricot nectar.  For convenience I steamed the carrots in the microwave and cooked the sauce in a small pan on the stove until thickened.  When the carrots were done I drained them, topped them with the butter and honey and poured the sauce over them.  Easy and delicious.

One cup of apricot nectar was excessive...I think you could use about a half that and it would still work out well.  Otherwise, a VERY tasty recipe.

Good change from plain carrots but I think I will use less apricot next time to cut down on the overwhelming flavor.

Very nice complement to a pistaschio and apricot rolled pork roast recipe I frequently use for company. Throw in a fresh salad and you have a meal people remember!

I think I was thinking this glaze would be more on the sweet side and it wasn't. Once I added a little bit of sugar, the flavors came together much better. I was looking for something to kind of mask the vegetable taste :)

Steamed carrots.  Had more control  by thickening glaze in separately then adding salt honey and butter,   Add carrots to completed glaze.

Easy and tastes great!  I doubled the recipe, but only used 1 cup of apricot nectar.  Next time I'll add some nectar to the boiling water.

Great taste, but be careful not to cook the baby carrots too long.  I would put less nectar in the carrots next time (and drink the remainder of the can!)
