This beef recipe was really easy to prepare and was very tasty! I didn't have dill seed on hand, so I substituted some dill weed. The beef was unbelievably tender. I served it over rice but will try it over egg noodles next time around.

I used this to pour over rice but as it cooked was worried about the flavor of the dish.  I doubled the broth and added carrots and potatos making more of a beef stew combo than poured over mashed potatos.  Yummy Yummy Yummy.

I didn't care for this recipe. It was OK I guess. I probably wont make it again though. Oh, and I left out the dill, so maybe that's why. I don't know, there are just a lot of other good recipes that I would rather have.

We didn't care for the dill in this.  Won't be making this again.

I only used half the dill because I am not a dill fan, and served over pasta(I was out of rice).. It was excellent.

It was good, but it took too long and had too much dill flavor.

Turned out great! Didn't have two hours to spare so I sliced the cubed beef into thirds and cooked for one hour before adding in mushrooms. Used twice as much mushrooms and also added carrots as others did (can never have too much veggies for me :) and it was great!
Maybe our family members don't eat as much but this recipe was enough for at least 8 in our household (two separate dinners).

I loved it! I'm a novice cook and even though this had to be simmered for 2 hours I found it a simple yet delicious meal to execute!!
