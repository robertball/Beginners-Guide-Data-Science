I always enjoy trying your recipes because they are always fun, different and delicious,and this one was no exception! My only change was to use jarred jalapeno peppers. This was a great take on nachos, which is one of our favorite snacks. The whole family really loved these! A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing another winner! :)

This was really great. I added in some sliced fresh baby Bella mushrooms and seasoned it all up with steak seasoning. What a great take on two old favorites.
