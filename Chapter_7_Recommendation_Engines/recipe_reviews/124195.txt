Used light sour cream instead of mayo and improvised with my own version of taco seasoning (garlic & onion powder, cumin, cayenne, chili powder, paprika, salt, pepper). Super easy and yummy!

At first I wasn't sure about the mayo, but oh my gosh, this is so good.  I took my neighbor a sample and she loved it also.  I will pass this on to others.  Thanks.

This recipe works great. I used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream though. The husband actually liked it too!

This is awesome - grilled or baked!  The quality of the chicken breast you get always makes a difference.  I get the biggest pack of 3-4 unfrozen ones I can find and they always come out fork-cutting tender and juicy.  I have made this about 20 times now.  It has impressed many guests and is always a hit with the family.  To bake it, I put the chicken in a square glass dish, cover it with the sauce, and bake at about 400-425 for 30 minutes or until the meat thermometer tells me it is done.  I use my Kitchen Aid convection/toaster oven.  Thank you for this great recipe!

This is soooo easy to make with lots of flavor.  I wanted to make it healthier, so I used low fat yogurt instead of mayonnaise and let it marinade for a half hour.  With the left over chicken, I am making chicken quesadillas.  YUM!

Delicious! This recipe takes as long to prepare as it takes for your grill to heat up. I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 plain yogurt. Loved it, will definitely make again.

My husband and I loved this! I always say you win some and you loose some when it comes to new recipes and this is a winner!! I had some sauce left over that I didnt want to waste, so I stuck a tortilla chip in it and it was fabulous! I would actually use some corn chips with it for a dip. My hubby also said it reminded him of applbees tiquila lime chicken, but we needed to put some cheese & tortilla strips on top. Good thinkin hubby!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I was really unsure about this recipe.  I was wrong. It was fantastic!  I should have defrosted more chicken breasts and cooked twice as many as I did.  This was so flavorful I am tempted to do it again tonight.  I served it with Spanish rice and fresh green beans. Yummy!

This was underwhelming.  I hope the leftover chicken tastes better the next day as many reviewers state.  Needed garlic, cumin & more cooking time.

I tried this chicken and it was so easy and delicious! I made this food with my aunt and it was so yummy! I recommend pounding the chicken breasts and marinating them in the mix! When I saw three easy ingredients I thought"OMG!" Please try it! It is to die for~ :)

Fast, easy and absolutely delicious.  The mayo makes the chicken moist and the lime goes perfectly with the taco seasoning.  This a great weeknight meal when you need dinner in a hurry.

Amazing, easy recipe!! Not a thing I would change taste-wise, although I will experiment with some other reviewers suggestions for healthier versions. Great easy, quick recipe though. I made this when I unexpectedly I the in-laws over, and it definitely impressed:)

I'll tell ya, for me this is a 5 all the way.  Simple ingredients, simple to assemble, and tastes great.  I love it when there are only a few ingredients and a few steps to a great tasting dish.  My changes: I used lime juice but not fresh.  I used fajita mix instead of taco mix.  I used leg quarters instead of breasts.  I marinated in a skillet in the frig for hmm I am not sure how long, but then I took the same skillet straight to the stove top.  Cooked low and slow, covered.  This was so very tasty.  FULL of flavor.  All KINDS of flavor, and moist and tender.  It was great.  Updated: I fixed this on the grill last night, with some chicken breasts that I pounded so they would cook even.  Again, I had to use fajita mix, but once again, the flavor was great!!

I added extra lime juice. A whole lime was about 4 TBSP. I also reserved some of the sauce and mixed it in with white rice. So so easy and really good!

This dish was amazing and  my dad and stepmom loved it after I made it for them and I'm only 13. What I did was the original recipe. The recipes with sour cream and plain yogurt are probably good to though

Wow, I was not expecting this recipe to be as amazing as it was!  This had such great flavour - we were surprised!  A definite repeat!  One of those recipes that requires very little effort or time, but delivers on taste, fantastic!

Made as stated.  Added a small dollop of sour cream  a generous spoonful of salsa and then sprinkled cheddar cheese over each chicken breast.  Husband loved it and said "That was outstanding!" 
 Served it with "Trader Joe's Chimichurri Rice w/vegetables" (store bought).

Made this last night for dinner. I did half sour cream and half mayo(would have used all sour cream but did not have enough). I used the homemade taco seasong recipe and fresh lemon instead of lime. I pounded the meat then let the marinade set for about two hours and then grilled them and some corn tortilla. Very good will make again.

I made a homemade taco seasoning off this site and used light mayonnaise. We put them on buns with melted cheese with ranch.  Very good! I think we will make them again without the bread so they flavors stand out more. Simple and quick!

OK, this recipe is REALLY easy.  The key is picking the right seasonings, and my preference is anything BUT mayonnaise, so I substituted light sour cream.  I use McCormick's Taco seasoning which is sold in a large container at Costco.  I highly recommend pounding your chicken flat so that you get better penetration of the marinade as well as even and fast cooking.  I made extra for my Mexican buffet party, and while I ended up with lots of leftovers, I use them in my enchilada recipe to make an additional meal or two in advance and put them in the freezer.  Yum!

This was good, but there was nothing exceptional here for us.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it’s a very easy recipe and goes together quickly.  I marinated my chicken in the mayonnaise mixture, reserving some to be basted on while grilling.  It came off the grill looking great, but really lacked pizzazz.  I served this with Black Bean Salsa (also from this site).

It looked very pretty after grilling however, we didn't think it was anything spectacular.  It was just okay.

Although I didn't eat this, being vegetarian, my husband and daughter really liked it, and it was supe easy to prepare. Would be great cold, too, in a salad (that is, if there were any leftovers). Thanks for the recipe.

I used 1 cup mayonnaise and improvised by using hot sauce instead of lime juice. This is so simple ... for beginners learning to grill and experienced cooks! The chicken was tender, juicy with beautiful grill lines. This is an excellent recipe! I made this for my family and they said it is delicious. I am definitely making this again. :-)

Mayo over powered flavor of the other seasonings. Different, however not a good fit for what I was wanting which was an authentic Mexican Grilled Chicken flavor

My husband thought this recipe was the best.  He couldn't stop talking about it.  We did use skin on chicken quarters.  I always make my own taco seasoning because I don't care for store bought.  I use chili powder, cumin, ceyanne, salt, pepper, oregeno, crushed red pepper.

I have made this chicken three times now. My family really liked this chicken. I would like to say that my husband wasn't excited the recipe used mayonaise, but still he still liked it. I would like to know how to get the seasoning to stay on the chicken!! ;)

This recipe was excellent. I made one change to it instead of using mayo I used sour cream which complemented the yellow rice nicely. Even my 2 year old couldn't get enough!!

This is a really good recipe! The only thing I would change next time is to add a little more taco seasoning on the chicken. These came out nice and juicy and made for great leftovers in a wrap the next day!

I made this recipe on a whim because I had guests coming for dinner and I didn't have time to marinate anything for the grill. I used olive oil mayo because that was what I had and it turned out great! I will definitely make this again:)

I made this several times over the summer, and it has been a hit with everyone... kids included!  For less sodium, I made my own taco seasoning (cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper all to taste).  The end result tastes pretty much the same whether you use reg mayo or fat free sour cream.

This was really good.  I used reduced fat sour cream instead of mayo, but it was still delicious.  I only wished that the meat had a stronger taste.  Next time, I think I will try marinating the chicken in the mixture for an hour or so.  It was definitely quick and went well with my frijoles a la charra and rice.

I was a little hesitant of using mayonnaise on the grill.  However, this turned out better than I imagined.  The delicious chicken was a hit with my entire family.

Delicious as written and so simple. I might add cooked bacon slices and melted cheddar some time. The sauce would also be great for pork chops.
