I made muffins out of this recipe. It was a little work buttering and cinnamon-sugaring the little muffin cups but the end result was worth it. I remarked to my husband how much they looked like snickerdoodles on the top and after I tasted them, it is remarkably like snickerdoodles.......banana snickerdoodles! I'll make this recipe again, it's one of the better banana breads I've had!

Fabulous banana bread! Moist, sweet with just enough spice and the cinnamon-sugar crust is a really nice addition - what more could you want from a banana bread? I used half white sugar and half brown sugar and added 2 tsp. of vanilla and used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I topped this with turbinado sugar vs. regular sugar for that little extra "crunch".  This smelled wonderful while it baked and tasted even better!

Just made this and it was delicious especially with the cinnamon sugar.  Sprinkled what was loose in the bottom on the top and worked out great.  For those of you who love peanut butter and banana sandwiches, I must admit that I do put peanut butter on banana bread.  Don't knock it until you try it.  Will make this again.

This is a wonderful banana bread recipe! So moist and full of flavor. Plus the cinnamon-sugar crust gives it a sweetness that I haven't tasted in others.

This recipe was good, but not great. I made it at the same time as the Banana Crumb Muffins from this site to compare them. Everyone agreed that the other recipe was alot better. These ones came out kind of dense and just didn't have as much flavor or sweetness. I didn't actually try either breads myself, but this was what I gathered from the reviews my family gave me. I probably would not make these again. Thanks anyways for the recipe.

Great recipe without the baking soda.  Dropped the sugar down to 1/2 cup, used whole wheat flour and used 1/4 Torchbearer's Mango Papaya Sauce. Came out moist with half the sugar.

This is probably the best banana bread I've ever made.  Usually sweet breads are so difficult and don't get done in the middle before burning.  This one was perfectly done in the time specified.  And the taste is outstanding!  I do like the cinnamon sugar on the outside.  I used turbinado sugar on the top instead of plain.  I used buttermilk instead of regular just because I had some to use up.  I didn't measure the bananas, just dumped in three medium sized ones that were completely black.  This will be a repeat recipe for me.

I liked the cinnamon crust, it was very tasty. I wouldn't make this again, however. I found it fell apart and dried out too quickly, compared with my usual recipe.

I have been making this bread for years now. It is one of the first recipes I found on AllRecipes.com. I do not change anything except I may add more banana than is stated. I love this and everyone I have made it for loves it as well. It is in the oven as I am typing this. I cant wait.

This is absolutely the BEST banana bread I have tried! (And I have tried many!!) I have passed this recipe on to my mother and my daughter. I did put about a 1/2 teaspoon extra cinnamon in the batter. I also checked it at 44 minutes and it was actually a little over cooked for me, but still very delicious! I think 42 minutes would have been perfect. I cant imagine cooking it for the recommended 60 minutes.  This is by far, the best banana bread!!! Thank you

Absolutely awesome. I bake them in individual mini loaf pans (the disposable tin ones) and they come out perfect every time.

Delicious, delicious! I added an extra banana, which made the recipe more moist and tasty.  The sugared crust was a nice touch.  I was even shocked how good this came out!

Just made this after looking for a new recipe for my standard banana bread.  This was delicious!
I added extra banana because it's what I had. Very moist, great cinnamon flavor and everyone enjoyed it.
May add walnuts to the next batch or even try a little allspice instead of nutmeg. Either way, it's definitely a must try.

The taste is okay. However, the notion of covering the bread pan with butter is a poor idea. Butter tend to burn and stick to the pan. A two inch piece of the bottom of one corner stuck. It works much better to spray the pan with Pam or some such and then sprinkle some Wondra on top and distribute it.

This really was very moist with a great sugary crust. I used lactaid milk in place of milk, otherwise I kept everything the same. I would make again!

This recipe is delicious but I found it to be a tad on the dry side. I made two and ran into it with both. They also needed to stay in an additional 15 minutes to cook through. Love the cinnamon-sugar coating, it adds a wonderful crunchy flavor!

I made this recipe exactly as written, but it was already finished cooking after 30 minutes so I'm glad I was keeping an eye on it.  I couldn't wait to try it because I loved the idea of having a butter and cinnamon sugar coating, so imagine my disappointment when I bite into it and it is by far the driest banana bread that I have ever made (and I have made quite a few) and the nutmeg flavor was completely overwhelming.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Classic, straightforward banana bread with a good, moist texture and slightly crispy crust. I changed nothing from the original recipe. Mine was done in 55 minutes, so you may want to check a bit early. I think this will be my go-to recipe.

My kids loved this recipe.  It is a pretty basic bread recipe, but the uniqueness comes from the butter, sugar and cinnamon mixture that you add to the pan before adding the batter and then sprinkling the mixture over the batter before baking. The result was a nice, moist bread with a yummy crunchy topping.

You can bake the bananas on 425 for 8 min to help mash them up. It was really easy when I did that.

I love this recipe....the sugar crust is awesome. I added 1/2 c chopped pecans and was even better.
