I used chicken drumsticks and served over egg noodles which was good.  I found it a little bit rich - I might suggest using a little less BBQ sauce and adding some water or more coke.

This recipe was so simple to make and so delicious to eat.  My four children who are picky eaters loved it, as well as my husband.  Chicken is so tender and tasty.

This isn't bad, it's just very runny.  Very easy and tasty meal to try.

Great recipe but I would leave out the onion.  Also once the chicken is done in the slow cooker you may need to toss in the broiler to crispen the skin

FYI the bitter taste is from the white part of the lemon peel. Squeeze a little lemon over it next time. Grate the zest, but you never want to put the white part in any dish.

Not sure I would make this again. I wasn't real fond of the flavor. It had kind of a bitter taste.

This is so Good!!!! I used just the juice of one lemon. It was not bitter at all. The white of the lemon makes it bitter.

This was only ok.  It had a slight bitter taste.  I used skinless chicken, but with the bone in.  The chicken came out very tender, though.  It fell right off the bone.

I think it would have been better if I had crisped the skin under the broiler for a few minutes.  It had a good flavor, but it looked like I was about to make stew.

If I could give this zero stars, I would.  I think it's the lemon that gives this a bitter taste, or maybe it's the cola. The chicken was actually dried out!  I started with good chicken too, so I know it wasn't that.  Sorry, Taste of Home, your recipes always look so appealing, but this one didn't make the grade.

I just did not care for this recipe and neither did my family. I like the idea but the taste just wasn't there.

Sorry, but I had to through it out my family
wouldn't eat it.  My hubby said don't get any
more recipes off the internet.  I will just be
careful what I choose. It was bitter tasting,
and not very good.

Very good.  My mom said it tasted like barbecue pork.  I made one substitution I use six chicken breasts.
