I was looking for a recipe that my grandma used to make.  This was it to a "T"!!  Like pecan pie without the nuts.  VERY sweet but GOOD!!  Takes literally 5 minutes to prep.  So easy!!!!

It is exactly what the recipe reflects - super sweet and heavy.  It was a very pretty golden brown.  I am giving it two stars because I think the result is true to its description.  I think I just need a bit more complexity of flavor than sugar and butter.

This is one of my favorite pie recipes since finding it posted on this site a few years ago. I have made it with dried cranberries, or chocolate chips pressed on the bottom. My mother-in-law says it tastes like a pecan pie without the pecans. I might try the previous reviewers suggestion and put pecans on the bottom next time, then it would be like an upside down pecan pie.

I lost my recipe for transparent pie and this tastes just like it. Some recipes call for cream, but I like this version, just like my mom and grandma made!

This recipe was very good. When I was a little girl my grandmother used to make this pie. This recipe is very close to hers. I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. A couple of days later I made it again adding a cup of pecans on the bottom of pastry, it was also a hit!!! charlotte    lansing, mi

My stepson had been asking for this pie since he ate one at a friends.  I found this recipe and told him to go to it !! He did a great job and it turned out just as it should, very easy to make.  He commented it was a bit to "eggy" tasting and next time he would probably cut down the number of yolks to 2 and the rest egg whites.  We will see, but all in all very easy.

Made this pie for Thanksgiving.  My Dad who has a super sweet tooth loved it.  Don't make it if you are diabetic, which I am.  This is like the southern Chess pie, but without the cornmeal and the pecans.

Was a bit too eggy/custard like. In the future I'd use 2 whole eggs & 2 egg whites, plus make sure the vinegar is evenly distributed without so each bite is more uniform.

An okay pie for us, the recipe was easy to put together, although the pie crust browned a little too much even though I shaved of 5 minutes from the baking time, so be careful.  Too sweet; texture between a custard and pecan pie.

Everyone loved this pie! I added pecans and was nice to have a pecan pie with no corn syrup.

This recipe is spot on for a great transparent pie! Itâ€™s so easy to make and it is very very rich and delicious! The only thing I did different is I put 3 eggs and 1 egg white in it, becuz some reviews said it had a very eggy taste. It turned out perfect and everyone loved it!!!

Simple, easy to follow directions. Turns out awesome and delicious everytime. Took this to a potluck at work and it was a hit!  Since I work in Maysville, KY, where this pie originated, that says it all! Would recommend this recipe to anyone who loves transparent pie!

I made this recipe and loved it, but something didn't turn out the way the reviews said.  It turned out more like a custard pie.  I am not complaining because I will definitely make it again.
