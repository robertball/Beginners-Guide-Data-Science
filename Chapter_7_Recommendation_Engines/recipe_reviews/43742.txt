This is great!  I added 1 lb. sausage, omitted the olives, substituted chicken bouillon for vegetable bouillon, and substituted Romano cheese for Parmesan.  I put in a 9x13 baking dish (much easier to prepare and serve out of than the shells) and made each layer (sauce w/ sausage, spaghetti squash strands, and cheese on top) twice.  Yum!

So tasty!

To cut down cooking time, cut the spaghetti squash in half and place cut side down in a microwavable dish with a few tablespoons of water.  Heat on high for 8-10 minutes.

This is very good and healthy.  I pureed the tomato and onion mixture with a hand-held blender and boiled it down for about 25 minutes to reduce much of the water.  Next time I will nix the squash shells and opt for throwing it all in a baking dish - the shells are a nuisance.  I also added a couple dashes of crushed red pepper for some heat.  Oh, and it's just fine without the Parmesan.

Have made this three times starting with the original recipe and then lending attention to other reviewers suggestions in subsequent preparations. Substitute the 2 14oz. cans of tomatoes with 1 24oz. jar of Bertolli Tomato and Basil prepared sauce...do not substitute with any other jar sauce. All other seasonings as stated.  While microwaving is easier for the squash, oven roasting is best both for texture and flavor. Saute the onions and garlic until almost "dry" for lack of a better word and then add jar sauce and simmer until thick, about 35 minutes. You can prepare according to original recipe to complete. I left the olives out as I do not care for them in all of my preparations. You can add cottage cheese and or sauted ground beef/turkey. Both compliment the recipe and you would layer as if this were a lasagna with pasta. The one thing I can say about the water within this dish is that this IS squash...75% water. The more water you remove from saute or simmer, the less water in completed dish. If you allow this to sit about 30 minutes from oven to serving, it helps. The longer simmer time and 4oz. reduction in wet ingredients allow for the squash "water" to blend versus be runny. Excellent dish!!!

This was the first time I ever made spaghetti squash. My husband has always gagged at the mention of it. Well he had 3 or 4 servings of this recipe. It is one that even my kids who never eat vegies liked. This will be a regular now at our home

I've heard of spaghetti squash a while back as an alternative to paste andbeing on atkins control carb way of life I was looking for an alternative. So Igave this recipe a try. before I go any further I must explain that I'd never been a fan of Squash period. Well to my surprise this dish was delisious and I plan on taking some to work next week to share.
Many tanks

I love this recipe.  It gives Spaghetti Sqaush a whole new twist.  I love serving it in the squash rind.  I used my own lasagna recipe and just substituted squash for the noodles.  Thanks for the great idea!

This is a good recipe if you're on a low carb diet.  It was my first time using spaghetti squash, and I don't think I cooked it long enough.  It was much too crunchy for me.However, I will try again maybe using a little water on cookie sheet to soften the squash and adjusting cooking time.  I also wouldn't mess with putting it back in the shells... I would just use a baking dish.  I also it makes more like 3 servings than 6.

My 8 year old is the poster boy for picky eaters. Lasagna is one of his very few favorites.  He couldn't get enough of this delicious way to sneak veggies into his diet. I cooked it in a baking dish and did add a little ricotta and left out the olives.  Also the squaush I had took about 50 minutes to cook.  Adding some leftover sauce from a jar helped hide the chunky tomatoes.  Definately a keeper.

I thought that this was very good but it seemed to take a long time to make. It would be easier to bake the squash with a little moisture and layering a baking dish with pasta sause, cheese, and what ever else. I will probably try it again but do it a little different.

This was soooo yummy!!  I love spaghetti, but hate the problem with carbs.  It tasted just like it- but crispy from the squash.  I did use my own sauce and put it in a baking dish (the shell broke)  but it was so good.  I will definetley make this again.

This was very good with the following changes: cooked the squash, removed the strands, drained in colander and refrigerated overnight wrapped in paper towels to absorb excess moisture; used my own spaghetti sauce; and, cooked in a casserole dish, layering in the same manner when cooking lasagna.  Quite tasty (even hubby agreed).  We frequently use spaghetti squash strands when having plain spaghetti with sauce, but this is the first time we've done so with a lasagna-type dish and will cook this frequently.  Thanks for sharing!

Outstanding recipe! Even better left over. I sprinkled crumbled feta and sliced black olives on the left overs - a great addition to the layers of tatse. It was a little juicy the first night so I recommend draining the excess watery juice before serving. I did follow others advice adding a layer of washed fresh baby spinach. I also baked it in a 9x13 dish instead of the squash. I cut the squash in half - scooped out the seeds - and baked the squash cut side down on foil with Pam sprayed on. I baked the seeds with seasoned salt at the same time - made a good snack.

Yum! Two thumbs up from me and my teen. I cheated with jarred spaghetti sauce, so this was very easy to make. I bought the smallest squash I could find, and it still took 50 minutes to bake. Looked beautiful in the shell, great dish for company. Next time I think I will use a baking dish just so I have room to add more veggies. A keeper for sure!

This was a successful dish. I didn't follow the suggested presentation in the shell, just used a casserole dish. Only minor changes I made: microwaved the squash to speed things up. Added mushrooms. Used a pre-made pasta sauce. I used half low-fat ricotta and half fat-free cottage cheese, because that's what I had lying around. Topped it with mozzarella and some bread crumbs. Turned out great. The topping really added nice textural component. Will definitely make this again!!

This is a great recipe as is, or modified to your liking.  I added some ground beef to make it more filling for a main dish, and I didn't have any olives so I left those out.  I don't measure spcies, just threw in amounts to taste.  As for comments about it being runny:  if you cook it in the squash shell, just poke holes in the shell to allow for drainage.  I Will definately be making this again!

I have to say that I am not nor have I ever been a squash person however my husband and I are now on a low carb diet. It's not easy coming up with meals that don't include carbs. So skeptically I decided to try this recipe. All I can say is WOW! this was absolutely fantastic! I added some chopped up Italian sausage, tomato paste to thicken up the sauce and I mixed some fresh diced basil with the mozzarella cheese before adding it to the dish. I made it 2 days ago and my husband has already asked me to make it again tomorrow! This recipe is a keeper for sure :)

Wow, REALLY good.  The spaghetti squash took longer to get soft, so I stuckit in the microwave.  Used 1 can of stewed italian style tomatoes, 1 can of diced italian style, chicken buillon instead of veggie, added ground turkey, added chili flakes and changed the parm cheese to pepper jack.  I know, too many changes, but this really was good and I will definitely be making it again.

Delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and skipped the squash shell and baked it in a 9x13 glass baking dish.  I also microwaved the squash in the first step to save time.  This is done by placing the two squash halved face down in about 1/4 cup of water for a 9x13 pan.  I microwaved on high for 20 minutes.  I used 1 can of dicecd tomatoes and i can of tomatoe sauce so there were less tomatoe chunks.  I could have used 1 more can of sauce.  Beautiful flavor that my husband and 2 year old son also loved.

This was wonderful!  It was fun to make and quite easy.  The taste was incredible.  My husband even ate it and he's usually a meat and potatoes kinda guy.  It sets beautifully in its own shell...very festive looking.  Wished they're were more stars to give it!  :)

We've never had squash before.  My hubby, not the kids, is a picky eater, but we all loved it!  The only thing I did was I used my normal home-made tomato sauce.  The cooking time for the squash was way off for me.  It took me twice as long, so plan accordingly.  I ended up having to make something else for dinner that night due to this, but continued to make it and stored it in the fridge for the following night.  I also skipped making it in the shells.  I threw the squash in a 9x13 dish, threw on the sauce, then topped it with the cheese.  Wonderful!  A new staple in this house!

Well, for what it was, it was okay.  There was no fooling anyone but it wasnt claiming that.  It was only fixed "Lasagna style"  I used one can of tomatoes, seemed like gobs plenty and I pureed it.  I used lo fat ricotta cheese.  I didnt use the shells although that would have been a cute presentation.  I nuked the squash in the microwave first, so I used that same dish to assemble the dish.  I don't know if I will fix again.  I am still on my quest to find a way that I like to fix spaghetti squash, but thank you for sharing.  I am sure it is a perfect fit for some palettes.

very tasty. I baked it in a pan to speed up the process. It's a great "add to" recipe, easy to add addtl items and still retain the great basic flavor. I put in some mushrooms that I cooked up with the garlic. great fast healthy meal.

Yum! I admit to going totally off-road with this recipe. I microwaved the squash and used spaghetti sauce that I'd already made. It was so good. My youngest child was so surprised that the squash wasn't noodles. Definitely a winner.

I was looking for something that would be fairly quick and easy to prepare. While this fits the bill for those categories, it falls short in the taste department thus the 3 star rating, just OK, not something I would care to make again. One can of tomatoes would have sufficed and a LOT more flavor.

This recipe is AMAZING! I've baked it in the shells AND in a pan--both ways are great (you can make more layers in the pan, but the shells are a fun way to eat it). Try sprucing it up by adding meat & more veggies. I added zucchini & green pepper to the sauce mixture & used a chicken bullion instead. I cooked chicken pieces & halved pepperoni slices & added them to a layer of the lasagna. I also added fresh chopped spinach & a bunch of chopped cilantro as extra layers too. Mmmm...oh, so good!

This is a great base recipe.  I baked the lasagna in a dish instead of in the squash shell.  I used jarred tomato sauce and Italian seasoned ground turkey. I was surprised at how good this was. It was so yummy!

This recipe was pretty good, my family really liked it.  It was an interesting twist to layer the squash like lasanga but it's alot easier just to throw the sauce on top of the squash, sprikle some cheese and eat it.

This was a healthy alternative.  I used standard pasta sauce, added mushrooms and italian sausage.  Layered with ricotta, sauce, squash, and shredded cheese (everything twice) and baked it off until bubbly and the cheese browned.  The kids didn't even realize it wasn't spaghetti.  They really thought it was pasta. They were super surprised when i told them it was squash...  will probably make this again without the shells.  The novelty only works once...

This is a tasty way to use that abundence of squash from your garden (planted 6 and wow do they produce)  Make this several times a year and it is always a hit.  I do add more garlic and cheese, just a personal choice.

I followed the recipe, omitting only the black olives. This is the best spaghetti squash recipe ever! It is so much lighter than traditional vegetarian pasta lasagna, and full of flavor. I will definitely make this again, and soon!!!

My husband loved it.  It's a keeper.  I did however omit the olives (we both dislike black olives)  and I added a little Dried Tomato & Garlic Pesto Mix(Tastefully Simple).  I served it over spaghetti noodles.

This was my first time making spaghetti squash and I'm very glad I used this recipe! It was really good. I added some zucchini and I think that next time I'll add some ricotta like some of the other users said. Very good recipe overall!

I added a green pepper to the onion and garlic saute.  Had fresh tomatoes to use up so put those in with a jar of Prego garden style.  Used beef bouillion and 2 c. of Mozzarella because that seemed like the right amount for us.  Everything else, left the same.  This was a very tasty and wonderful vegetable side.  Will definitely make again.  May use pork sausage to saute veggies in if I ever want to make it into a main dish.  Hub doesn't even like spaghetti squash and he even loved it.  A keeper!

I made a bunch of additions to this recipe just to get rid of some veggies in my fridge, and it turned out great.  I added yellow zucchini, portobello mushrooms and feta cheese on top of the mozzarella.  It turned out really well and I'll make this again!

I don't know.  I think another reviewer said it best when they said it was lacking as a main dish.  Like a squash parmigiana really... left something to be desired.

I cut corners by using my favorite prepared sauce.  I baked in pan with added layer of fresh steamed chopped broccoli florets and carrots.  Topped with prebaked homemade Italian tofu meatballs and mozzarella/parm mixture.  Yum.

I have never tried spaghetti squash until now...LOVE IT!!!  I did make this dish in a 9x9 baking dish and it turned out perfectly!  I love to make all of my sauces from scratch so I can add tons of veggies so this recipe was great!!  Even the "meat" eaters in the house loved it!!

This was fabulous. I had it a really healthy restaurant in Phoenix and wanted to copy it. I also microwaved the squash for 8 minutes, then cooked for about 20 minutes in the oven. It was perfectly soft.   Then I sauteed onions in some EVOO, added ground turkey, salt and pepper, dried thyme, parsley and basil, and garlic. Once it was all cooked, added Marinara sauce and half a bouillon.   Layered just like the directions said in a 9X13 pan. It was a little watery, but I should have drained the turkey!  My husband thought it was spaghetti and said "Delicious!" when he finished!

This was so good. I have never had spaghetti squash before and bought one on accident thinking it was butternut squash. When I cut it open I got a surprise. I searched and found this recipe and tried it out. Only thing I did different was I layered it in a pyrex baking dish. What a way to eat such a fun squash! I recommend this to anyone who likes italian flavor.

Glad I made this! I used italian stewed tomatoes and herbs de provincial, and added a can of mushrooms. I made this recipe in two steps as I didn't have the time in one evening. I baked the squash last night, refridgerated, and put everything else together tonight. Tasty and filing, although I feel like I had to add a lot of spices and cheese to get a good flavor. I'll make out again!

Except for sprinkling with chopped parsley, I followed the recipe closely, and I was quite pleased with the results.  My squash was huge, so I had to double the quantities.  I think that baking the whole thing in the shells is a great idea-- it's no extra work, and it makes for a great presentation.  My guests were quite impressed.  Thanks for the recipe, Brisak! BTW, I removed most of the guts from the seeds, which I then mixed with sunflower oil, cayenne pepper, salt, and cumin, and then roasted them along side the squash.  (Mark Bittman's recipe for Fiery Pumpkin Seeds) Mmmm!  These taste great on their own, or on a green salad.  UPDATE:  I wanted to add protein and turn this into a main dish, so I added about 3/4 cup of red lentils to the tomato sauce, and let it simmer for 20 minutes.  On top of each layer of sauce, I sprinkled Italian seasoning, which really added to the flavour.

I used fresh basil vs dried and made my own stewed tomatoes vs canned. I only used 1 reg. size can black olives... 8 oz I think. The squash took far longer to cook then 35 minutes, I lost track of how long but I am guessing 1 hour. The last 2 minutes of cook time I turned on broil to brown the cheese. To serve I cut it, all the ingredients stayed together fine. This was the 1st time we've had spaghetti squash, it was okay but don't think we really like it.

I have made this twice now. I add sausage, mushrooms, onions (red and green) and bell peppers. I layer like lasagna and top with cheese. YUM

I've never made spaghetti squash before, and it turned out perfect! I hope to never use regular noodles again. My slightly-sceptical husband even liked this!

Delicious!  Fortunately, my husband likes spaghetti squash...I turned this into our main course!  Truly, I've been trying to wean him away from a lot of meat and with the cheese layered in, it seemed rich and satisfying.  He said I could quote him:  "Feel free to make this anytime!"  LOL  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is a new family favourite. Very easy to make.  I used my homemade sauce and added a few cauliflower florets and some  red pepper to the sauce for added flavour (and blended it with a hand blender).  I layered it twice- each half of the squash  made a layer. I omitted the olives and used a baking dish rather than the rind. Next time I'll add ground turkey to the sauce.

Made this yesterday for a "snack" planning to save the leftovers... we ate the WHOLE thing! I very highly recommend this! I used fresh tomato, added mushrooms and about 1/3 cup of left over Vodka Sauce to the veggies. This was the first time I have made Spaghetti Squash and it was absolutely perfect!

I loved this! I  cooked the squash in the microwave 10 minutes whole with holes poked in it, and used Bertoli sauce and mozzarella cheese in the layering to make it quick and easy! My husband who is a meat eater even liked it!

I was skeptical of the reviews saying it would get my kids to eat spaghetti squash better, but it did! They loved how it was baked right in the shell. Delicious, thanks!

Didn't change a thing and this was amazing!! Even the kids liked it. Instead of a large spaghetti squash, since none were available, I used to small ones - about half the size of a normal one. It was perfect!! I needed 4 portions and so I was able to place each half of a dinner plate and everyone got their own little stuffed squash :D Makes a great presentation for guests!

Our Girls' Night food theme this month was squash. I had only made spaghetti squash one other time before this and it was awful, so I was very pleased with the way this turned out. I'd still take regular baked spaghetti over baked spaghetti squash any day, but for what it is, this was pretty good. I did add a 1/2 lb ground beef to the tomato mixture and am very glad I did. I did use the olives, just because I had them in my pantry, but I think they could be left out.

The sauce was good, and the idea of cooking it in the squash shell was cool, but it was overall pretty underwhelming. It tastes NOTHING like baked pasta to be sure!

Omitted olives. Added a layer of cottage/ricotta cheese and egg mixture for more substance. Will add some italian sausage to the sauce next time and really cook down sauce to reduce the "soupiness".

Cheesy goodness.  I baked it in a pan thanks to the suggestions of other reviewers.  It came out of the oven sitting in more juice than I had expected, but it acted as a nice sauce.  Great low cal alternative to traditional lasagna.

This was good, but not amazing. I loved the concept of layering the squash, but I didn't like the sauce. Normally I prefer chunky sauces but next time I'll use my own sauce recipe or run this one through the blender. I also doubled the garlic and added oregano.

This is a wonderful recipie!  We all loved it. I made it as written except that I baked it in a 9x13 casserole dish instead of the shells.  Next time, and there definitely will be a next time, I may make a bit more sauce because it seemed like it could use more, but it was delicious as is.

This was GREAT!  I'd never even had spaghetti squash before, so thought this would be a tasty one to try.  NICE! Did one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce, and browned 1lb of italian sausage to put in sauce.  Had fresh basil and parsley on hand, so that's what I put in instead of dry.  Omitted olives since not a fan. Thank you for the recipe - a hit with my family too!

Really excellent recipe. I did not use the bouillon cube and it was still outstanding. Used much less cheese than called for as well. Next time, I might go full bore with the cheese and try some other ingredients too. This is a very adaptable recipe.

Great idea! This is the best way I've ever had spaghetti squash! I did not use olives, but had some zucchini saute with olive oil, onion and white wine. I also used sauce from the jar since I had some leftover from another dinner. I added fresh basil in there too. I used a baking dish since it seemed much more fool proof! thank you for sharing this great idea.

Really good.   I just baked it in a baking pan instead of putting back in the shell.  I also didn't have vegetable bouillon, so I substituted chicken bouillon and it was good.  1 onion seemed to be way too many.  Next time I make it, I will only use 1/2 of an onion.  Just like lasagna, it was better the 2nd day.

very good start - easy to alter to your taste.  I add burger for my little carnivores and use beef bouillon.  I'm a full time, single mom and have very little time (and too many helpers) for such a long prep time so I prepare the squash the night before while making that nights dinner.. then when I get home from work I just have to cook up the sauce and layer it up!  My picky eaters prefer if I overcook the squash (making it mushier) so I bake at 425 for nearly an hour.

I bought spaghetti squash for my 1 year old and then had no idea what to do with it.  Thank goodness I found this recipe!  Per reviews I used a jar of spaghetti sauce.  I browned the sausage, garlic and onions.  I omitted the olives because I didn't have any.  Just layer as specified and baked.  I baked it for longer until the cheese was bubbly- probably around 35 minutes.  I also baked it in a 9 by 13 baking dish instead of the shells as other reviewers recommended.  Such a good recipe and a good way to get veggies in!

I really enjoyed this recipe, good and versatile. Like other reviewers, I layered it in a baking dish rather than the shells, too many ingredients to fit in the shells and I didn't want to have leftover ingredients at the end. I used jarred spaghetti sauce and added cooked broccoli and kale, onions, and garlic. I also made it vegan by replacing the cheese with crumbled tofu.  For the tofu I used a recipe for tofu ricotta cheese but I'm sure crumbled tofu with basil and garlic would be fine as the sauce absorbs into the tofu.

Fabulous!  Made in a casserole dish, put in spinach instead of olives and added 1/2 c of tomato sauce.  Will become a staple in our house -- thanks for a great recipe!

Loved this and it was SO easy to make! My husband was also pleasantly surprised. Although it didn't fill him up enough so I would add some turkey or chicken sausage next time.

This is a good way to use spaghetti squash, and tasty fresh out of the oven; however, leftovers tend to be soggy and rather unappetizing.

I found this recipe to be absolutely delicious, as did my 6 year old daughter. My skeptical husband felt deceived by the name of this as it had no meat and no pasta... poor guy!  I ended up using Ragu pasta sauce because I didn't have other ingredients on hand. I also added 1 cup of cottage cheese with the other cheeses.  I am looking forward to sharing this dish for family gatherings. Deliciously healthy!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I used it the very first time I made spaghetti squash, and my husband and I liked it so much that I've made it several more times.  I also sometimes use the recipe for just the sauce part, and put the sauce on pasta.  Delicious!

This was GREAT!  I had never prepared or eaten spaghetti squash and this was a fantastic surprise.  I didn't use olives becuase I don't like them, so I substituted thinly sliced red pepper.

I loved this, although it took longer than 35 minutes to soften the squash enough.  I cooked it in a baking pan because by the time I finished scooping out the squash, its shell was rather thin and disfigured.

This was so delicious!  I was worried because the last time I had spaghetti squash it tasted bad but this one tasted great!  My skeptical husband also loved it!  We pureed the cans of tomatoes before using them.  Next time I will buy tomato sauce.  I also used slices of mozz instead of shredded.  Our squash baked for 1 hour before stuffing. Yum Yum!

This is a wonderful recipe... something really different.  I used vegan mozzerella cheese and no parmesan to make a dairy-free dish.  A+, I'll make this over and over.

OH MY GOSH this was good! One of my husband's "requested" favorites & we're not total health food nuts, although we do like healthy food. I guess I had a smaller squash cuz I only used 1 can of Italian style tomatoes and it worked out fine & no bouillon I'm not a big fan of any kind of bouillon. This was delicious! (my 3 yr old loved it too!)

We don't make it in the shell and we add the classic ricotta+ egg mixture you'll find in any lasagna. But this has become a staple at our house and was a hit at the last pot luck I brought it to.

My husband said on a scale of 1-10 it was a 14. I did make a few adjustments, I added about a 1/2 lb Italian sausage, sliced yellow and red peppers, oregano as well as the basil, I wasn't sure about the black olives but added them to the sauce after it simmered a while. I was glad I did. This was delicious, layered it as it suggested, the hardest part of the recipe is cutting the squash in half.  It's a keeper for us. My husband thought it would also be a great dinner party main course. S.Proctor

Very tastey!  I layered cottage cheese sprinkled with basil, salt and pepper and black olives (great combo!) alternately with the squash, cheese and sauce.  Also, I used prepared sauce with extra veggies and per another review about crunchy squash, I opted to add 1 cup of broth after my first layer rather than to the sauce, and cooked it for 1/2hr @ 350F.  I let it sit to allow excessive juices to soak in, it came out a touch juicy (maybe ony use 1/2 cup broth next time) but the squash was perfect!

I've tried many sketti squash recipes but this one is by far the best. I sautéed the onion and garlic together with some green chilies to add a kick and I did use the two cans of tomatoes but I drained them beforehand. Definitely cook the sauce until most of the liquid is gone. I also cooked the squash cut side up and liberally added spices and salt/pepper. Also cooked the squash a little extra to dry it out a bit more.
Finally I added a mixture of ground lean beef and homemade chicken sausage.
This was a wonderful meal! My husband is not a fan of squash but he really liked this.

Very delicious, though I baked it in a 9x13 pan and made the following edits:
- Reduced parmesan to 1/2 cup
- Added 1/2 cup ricotta to the sauce
- Added 10 oz spinach, 1/4 c broccoli, 17 asparagus spears, and 1 tbsp oregano to the sauce
- Used mostly fresh basil (2 tbsp fresh, 1 tsp dry)

This is delicious!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers - cooked the squash in the microwave (same direction as oven, but add a couple tablespoons of water - cook 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the squash).  If you want the squash to be more tender, you are looking for it to look like the insides will break away from the skin on their own.
I also reduced the amount of parm and increased the mozz - left out olives and added mushrooms.  I did not add the mixture back to the shell, but instead did it in a baking dish.
I can no longer eat pasta, so this was AMAZING to me and got approval from the carb-loving hubby too!

This is a family favorite.  I just added a layer of Jimmie Dean sausage and a can of fresh seasoned diced tomatoes to compliment the stewed tomatoes.  Then, I baked the casserole in a dish instead of the shell.   Also, the supermarket will often cut the squash in half for you which is a HUGE time saver.

The star thing on this review is not working but if it were I would give this recipe 5 stars. It was really tasty and I don't even like squash! I made it once following this recipe and than I made it once using jarred tomato sauce, olives and the cheeses - it was a lot easier this way than making my own sauce and I really liked how it tasted. I will make it again but using the jarred sauce. It is an easy recipe to make.

I personally loved this recipe.  My only change was adding a bit of italian sausage in with the garlic and onions for the sauce and baking it in a dish.  My family, however, wasn't so enthusiastic.  My picky 3-1/2-year old wouldn't eat it and my husband, who doesn't like squash in the first place, said it was okay and he would rather have the carbs with the pasta noodles.  Well, this was my first time trying spaghetti squash and I loved the texture of it with the sauce and cheese.  I will make this again for myself, anyway.  Next time I might season the squash with a little salt and pepper after I scrape it out of the rind.

From the first time I made this several years ago, this is my go to fall recipe for spaghetti squash.  Honestly, I don't change much, except maybe add more cheese and I use petite diced tomatoes rather than stewed tomatoes.  While the presentation in the squash shells are impressive, you can also use a 7X11 in pan instead.  It makes 6 generous servings and I always have leftovers which freeze nicely.  I have easily made this dish 10+ times and I still love it just the way it is.

I loved it.  Husband liked it and 1 of 3 kids liked it.  I used my own sausage & tomato sauce from the freezer and toped with cheese in a 13 x 9 casserole dish.  I ate it for dinner & most of the leftovers.  If you are looking for something low carb that tastes pretty close to real lasagna or spaghetti this isn't bad.  My kids are super picky and didn't like the "yellow noodles" (their words).

So yummy! I'm a terrible cook, but this was easy and foolproof. Like another reviewer, I also left out the olives and used chicken bouillon. And I used tomato sauce instead of stewed tomatoes. I added just one link of sausage to give it more substance. YUM!

A few changes and this was wonderful.  Took the advice from others and did not use the shells.  We all loved it.

Good flavors!  The only thing I didn't add was the olives because I didn't have any.  This is a good side dish, but a little lacking in the main dish department.

Turned out great! Didn't even miss the noodles at all! I read the reviews and microwaved the squash ahead of time to cut down the cooking time.

A great dish for sure! We all loved it incl. my girlfriend who's not too much into squash. I have to agree that one squash makes about 4 servings not 6 though.  I also microwaved the squash instead of baking it as one review suggested to save some time. Also, I used Gouda instead of Parmesan, because I didn't have any. I altered nothing else and am very happy with this and will make it again pretty soon! Thanks a lot for this great recipe!!

Fixed as written and it was wonderful. My husband said he didn't even miss the meat. However, in order to make neat servings, next time I will layer the ingredients in a casserole dish. Oh, and I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. A keeper, for sure.

I'm not a huge fan of squash, so I didn't really have high hopes for this. Well, I was just astounded at how great this was. I did make a couple of changes though: left out the olives because I don't like them, used fresh mozzarella, cooked the "lasagna" in a casserole dish instead of the squash shells and cooked it for 30 minutes instead of 20. I liked this dish better than the standard spaghetti or lasagna with pasta noodles.

Delish!! Very impressed with this recipe. I used a small squash and also cooked it longer than 35 minutes, it was almost an hour before it was done.  I also added 1lb browned lean ground beef to the stewed tomatoes and baked it in a 9X13 in baking dish!! My husband hates squash and was less than excited to try this, I am happy to say he LOVED it!! I will be making this again!!

This is sooo delicious!! spaghetti squash is kinda bland so the tomato sauce give it real flavor, and the few olives give it a kick! I will try it with the sausage next time. I baked it in the shells and just cut off a piece to serve it. Looked and Tasted great!!

Great recipe! I followed the recipe except for substituting chicken bouillon for vegetable, which I didn't have. The flavor is excellent. I'd have given it five stars, but the spaghetti squash was quite crunchy when we ate it. I didn't enjoy the texture as much as if it had been a bit softer. Next time I will bake (during Step 2) longer--I'll try 45-50 minutes. Other than that, I highly recommend this recipe as a great way to enjoy spaghetti squash!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I make it for. I usually just bake it in a casserole dish instead of the shells. I also use Kalamata olives and replace 1 of the cans of tomatoes with Rotel to give it a little extra kick.

I cooked each half of the spaghetti squash in the microwave on a plate for 8 minutes, one at a time. Added 1 lb. of spicy Italian sausage, a pinch of thyme, and 1 can of tomato sauce to the sauce. I did 1 layer of the ingredients in a casserole dish, layered 3/4 of the parmesan cheese on top of the spaghetti squash and the last quarter over the top of the sauce with the mozzarella cheese. Family loved it!! This is definitely a keeper!!

If you like spaghetti squash, I highly recommend this dish!  My husband and I both struggled a bit with the texture, so I'm not sure I would make again, but that's for personal reasons.  I used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoes, and I also added ground beef.  Cooked in a baking dish.

Great recipe.  I accidentally bought tomatoes with green chilies and didn't realize it until I was already cooking them.  So I improvised and used shredded cheddar and jack cheese.  Came out great, so if you're looking for a different lasagna try it!

Oh, my!  This is super duper yummy!  I don't do canned tomatoes, so I used 3 fresh tomatoes (and would have used 4 if I'd had them.  I also added about 1/2 of a green pepper which I cooked with the onion and garlic.  I served this multi-grain garlic bread.  I'll be making this one again soon...maybe even for special company!

Wow! This recipe is awesome! The squash is just the same as angel hair pasta. I added some kosher salt to the recipe, chili flakes, and a bit more cheese. I also strained the tomatoes to reduce the liquid. Turned out G.R.E.A.T. My bf who is a real meat and potato's guy said I need to make this (Vegetarian) meal more often.

The amount of cheese and sauce seemed disproportionate to the squash.  I also would suggest seasoning the squash while baking it.  Without, it tasted too bland.

Really good.  I added some crushed red pepper flakes and spinach.  I omitted the olives bc I can't stand them.  My bf wasn't fond of the squash because it is crunchy, but he loved the sauce.  It was a beautiful presentation.  The sauce didn't make enough for the amount of squash so I put half of the squash in a container for future use.  In the future I will double the amount of sauce.

We had a ton of Spaghetti Squash this year from our garden and we were desperate for different ways to eat it and this one is at the top of our list. Even my kids loved it. I didn't have the basil so I used a spaghetti seasoning packet instead and it was great! Thanks

OMG~ Love this recipe.  It is definetly a keeper.  I made it for dinner tonight as a low-cal, healthy recipe and everyone loved it (with the exception of my 5 year old daughter that doesn't like anything unless it begins with chicken and ends with nuggets :-)  I would not change a thing!

A hit with the family :D I used cottage cheese and colby cheddar versus the cheeses listed in the recipe.

This was easy to put together once I got the squash cut in half! The sticker on the veggie recommended putting it in the microwave for a bit to soften the skin. I'll do that next time. I used one can of stewed tomatoes, a small can of tomato sauce & a bit of water. We just put the sauce over the strands without the layering. I'm thinking cottage cheese & capers might be tasty next time.

This was very good.  Both my 5 year old and my husband (a meat eater) really enjoyed this. (Even the left-overs are good.) 
I did make a few changes. I used a jar if premade sauce, eliminated the olives, and added cottage cheese. 
I also rubbed a little olive oil onto the squash halves and the pan and baked it at 350 (instead of 325) for about 45 minutes.
Spaghetti squash is great as long as you don't expect the same texture as noodles. This is a healthy dish that can be altered in many ways by adding veggies or tofu for example.
I did bake in the shells but I probably will just use a casserole next time, did make a nice presentation though. 
I also think I will drain the squash strands in a collander or press them with a towel to make it less watery next time.  I served this with steamed broccoli and garlic bread. Yum!

Now I've tasted this I wish spaghetti squash was available all year long! This was so good, so filling and so healthy! We both loved the light buttery flavour of the squash, even my boy-friend who usually don't enjoy meatless meals that much...

This recipe was absolutely fantastic! The sauce was delicious, and most surprisingly even my carnivorous boyfriend loved it! Everyone should definitely try it (to safe cooking time, cook the squash in the microwave, which only takes 10 min)

Great recipe.  This was my first time cooking spaghetti squash and I don't think I'll cook it any other way.  This is delicious.  I used a can of stewed tomatoes & dice tomatoes.

You could easily cook the squash in the microwave rather than the oven. I tweak it by using 1/2 an onion and some dried minced onion (not 1 whole onion), 1 drained can of diced tomatoes and 1 can tomato sauce (not 2 cans of stewed tomatoes), Italian (not vegetable) bouillon, Italian seasoning, (rather than basil) and some cottage cheese. I baked it in an 11x7 pan instead of the shells. If you really want to simplify things, then use store-bought sauce. It still tastes great!

Wow, this was a very tasty dish.  I added 3 links of Italian sausage removed from casings and fried with the onions and garlic.  I used two cans of diced tomatoes, pureed in food processor.  My sauce was tasty, but on the watery side.  Next time I might use tomato sauce and paste.  I also made the dish in a 9x13 baking dish, worked wonderfully.  Don't skimp on the squash, after layering I still had a bunch of squash left.  I also layered some cottage cheese in.  I didn't have any olives, so I added about 4oz of sliced fresh mushrooms while cooking sauce.  My husband usually turns his nose up to the word squash, but said I could definatly make this again!

I have never had spaghetti squash before so I didn't know what to expect. We really liked everything except the squash. The tomato sauce and olives and cheeses make a great combination. We just didnt like it with the squash. I did like the presentation of baking everything in the shells. That was cool. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who likes this  type of squash since it was easy to prepare, beautiful to serve, and cheap to make.

This was really a wonderful recipe! My wife is pregnant, so the cooking has fallen to me more than usual, and I was running out of ideas when a friend gave me the squash. I loved how easy it was to make, she loved the taste! 
 After browning the onion and garlic, I put it into our food processor along with the other ingredients and the sauce was wonderfully smooth and rich.

This is definitely a keeper!  While spaghettis squash can never replace pasta it is a great change up!  We loved this recipe and next time I would probably cut back on the mozzarella a little bit.  Great job Brisak!

I decided to make this only because I had two (small) spaghetti squash. I didn’t realize that there was not going to be any meat in this meal so I concerned that my husband might not like it. But as it turned out, he loved it. 
The only problem I had was locating vegetable bouillon  and a 15oz. can of chopped black olives. So I used a beef bouillon and a 6oz. can of whole black olives and chopped them myself and it was more than enough. 
Also, instead of spraying the non-stick pan with cooking spray, I used a drizzle of olive oil and it worked out fine.

Can't wait to make it again! I also like others cooked squash, then put it all together in a casserole dish. I did add some sausage. That was the only change. I'm craving it already again. So filling without the bloat from pasta.

To decrease the liquid in this recipe, try making this in a meatloaf pan, with the insert that allows the fat to drain from the meatloaf.  It works like a charm.

I took some notes from the other reviews I read. Used chicken bouillon instead of vegetable, omitted the olives (my husband doesn't care for them), and added hot Italian turkey sausage and mushroom. Baked in casserole dish and served.

Alternatives:  Faire cuire la courge coupée en 2 au micro-onde 8 à 10 minutes les 2 demi-ronds au dessus.  Utiliser (+/-) 28 oz de sauce à spaghetti à la basilic déjà préparée en pot.  Ajouter 500 g de fromage cottage mélangé avec 1 œuf à la recette.  Étager avec des vraies pâtes lasagne (si celles au four, ajouter 1 tasse d'eau à la sauce).  Faire des étages de lasagne, sauce, courge, fromage cottage.  À mi-chemin saupoudrer de parmesan.  Disposer de la pelure des courges.  Utiliser plutôt un plat rectangulaire allant au four.  Finir avec le mozzarella râpé ou sac 4 fromages mélangés Italien râpés en surface.  Cuite à 350 degrés F pendant 30 minutes.  Vraiment bon !

Very good!  I am a new vegetarian and am trying to find fresh meals for my family to eat that will please all of us.  This was easy to make and a different use of Spaghetti Squash.  I did add Lasagna noodles because I was worried it would not hold its shape.  My children are asking me to make it again so it must have been a hit.  I think next time I am going to add a layer of spinach as well.

Gosh, this is soooooo good!  We were looking for something different to bring to the Thanksgiving feast, and we found it. I didn't really layer it (only because I didn't feel like it).  Next time I will make more sauce.  The sauce is so good, I'm sure I can find other things to use it for as well. Definitely will be making this again and again.  Thank you very much for sharing this tasty recipe.  Good job!

I added lean ground beef that was seasoned with Italian seasoning. I also used a jarred vodka pasta sauce, instead of making the sauce. I was skeptical that my husband would like it, but he loved it and said it's a "make again meal!"

It was OK. Very runny even after I took reviewers advice and strained squash after it was cooked and let finished product sit for 15 minutes. Made it with ricotta and substituted mushrooms for olives. Husband liked it, kids did not.won't make again. Tasted sour to me. Maybe ricotta did that? Not sure but definitely not close to how people raved.

This was very tasty. I liked the little bit of crunch from the spaghetti squash. I used fresh tomatoes from the garden instead of canned - otherwise made it following the recipe. Good stuff!

Used a packet of bouillion instead of a cube, only one Tbl of minced garlic (seemed like a lot!), and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes. Added ground turkey and used more mozzarella than the recipe called for. Did not use Parmesan except for a bit of grated parm on the top. Very good use for spaghetti squash!

a great way to prepare spaghetti squash. you can change up what you do with the sauce etc to your tastes or what you have on hand. a bit time consuming just cos of the cooking time on the squash, but it's worth it to let it cook properly in the oven for the flavour!

I went way off the map on this one (my first time trying spaghetti squash). 2 squash would have been better. I placed in a loaf pan, layered with squash, jar spaghetti sauce mixed with browned italian sausage, mozzerella, then topped with grated parmesan. Baked for 30 minutes--it was actually not bad! Two things: I roasted the squash for 55 minutes. Next, I pressed a lot of the liquid out of the squash strands by pressing in a sieve before using. This recipe begs for experimentation and is worth it overall.

excellent..added the turkey sausage per suggestion for another review...I bake in 9 X 13 pan like lasagna...easier than the shells. we just love it and it heats well as a leftover. it's great served with a green salad. my husband just loves this new dish...keep the recipes coming!!!

Great Recipe! This was even better than I expected. The changes I made: I microwaved the squash halves on a plate with a little bit of water for 8 mins before sticking them in the oven for 15 min. I added twice the basil, some red pepper flakes, and threw in some bell peppers and mushrooms from the fridge,

My hubby loved it and so did I.  We live at high altitude, ended up baking the squash for much longer to soften enough, but it was worth the extra time!!

This was excellent.  My squash must have been huge because it took over an hour to cook.  This was actually easy to make, I used a jar of Ragu instead of making the sauce.  I did add a sauteed onion, 1-2 Tbls minced garlic, 1/2 tsp of basil and 1/2 tsp italian seasoning to the sauce.  I only used about 1/4 c of parmesan cheese and that seemed plenty.  It was delicious and filling and made about 6 servings.

Awesome! Used chicken bouillon because I didn't have vegetable, and I substituted diced canned tomatoes because I didn't have stewed. I will certianly make this again. It is lovely with a side salad as dinner for two.

I had a 6 lb spaghetti squash to use from our garden. I cheated and cooked squash in the microwave. Added a lb of ground beef and used Cheddar since I didn't have any mozzarella and layered like the recipe said but in 2 9X9 pans. My husband loved it and said it was the closeted to to authentic Italian taste I've ever gotten. I did everything elt's the recipe suggested to a T. We loved it.

Great recipe, easy to adjust to your family's tastes and nutritional needs. We omitted the olives and garlic (due to pregnant food aversions...) and added a layer of frozen spinach to get some extra veggies in. I also added some jarred pasta sauce to the tomatoes to give it a smoother consistency, and omitted the boullion. Turned out great and we'll definitely make it again!!

A different take on both lasagna and on spaghetti squash. Very hearty and filling. Great comfort food. Very well seasoned. I added a pound of ground turkey to the vegetable-spice mixture. Also, it took my two squash halves about an hour to cook instead of 35 minutes, but this may have been because I was cooking them in a toaster oven. (C'mon, it's September in central Virginia and still pretty hot. Our regular oven probably won't be turned on until some time in October!) All in all, something different AND delicious! What a great combination!

I will admit I was a little nervous about trying this, but only tried because I was given a spaghetti squash, and didn't know what to do with it.  It was a huge hit, and my husband is wanting to buy a spaghetti squash every week.

Very tasty. I made it in a baking dish rather than the squash shell. I found it very watery, and would like it better with some suggestions on how to reduce the water from the squash and tomato sauce.

My husband and I absolutely loved this dish. I served it as a side dish with grilled chicken.  I used 1 can of tomatoes and 1/2 jar of marinara sauce instead of 2 cans of tomatoes and vegetable buillion.  I also used a mixture of black and green olives.  It made enough for 4 to six as a side dish.  The great thing about serving it in the shell is the shell keeps it nice and warm throughout your meal.  Definately adding it to my faves list.

Outstanding! This is the 3rd spaghetti squash recipe I tried this week, and it is the best, hands down.  It has a taste of lasagna - but with vermicelli noodles.  I reduced the amounts of the recipe because I'm only cooking for me. My changes - bottled sauce (1/2 bottle of TJoe's 18oz tradional marinara) with 2 tbls Splenda and 1 cup thick sliced mushrooms with the onions and garlic. I cooked the onions, garlic and mushrooms down for a few minutes then added the sauce. I layered in a 1 qt casserole dish,  1 cup or so squash,  1/2 sauce, 1/4 cup mozzarella and 1 tbls shredded Parm, repeated. Baked uncovered for 25 min at 400. This is very WW friendly!  Excellent!

This is a fantastic recipe - I haven't given spaghetti squash enough credit in the past.  I followed the directions exactly except left out the Parmesan cheese because I didn't have any.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I did not care for this. first of all it was way too watery and did not taste right at all. i followed the directions exactly except i added less cheese because i thought it was goign to be too heavy. i would never ever make this recipe again, and i love spaghetti squash and lasagna! a total disapointment.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because I changed it up to be more like a traditional lasagna (added ground turkey, made my own sauce, added ricotta/oregano/parsley mixture as one of the layers) but I loved the idea of this recipe.  I've been craving lasagna but we eat low carb so we don't eat pasta.  This satisfied that craving and honestly, I ate some of the cold leftovers out of the fridge today and if I hadn't made it myself I would have sworn it was regular lasagna!  Thank you so much for this great recipe!

I made this in response to my fiance's request for a meatless dinner (which is RARE!).  I really loved it, and so did he - although he said, "You know what this could use?  Meat!"  I think it would be great with sausage as well, but was perfectly good without any meat.  I added 2 layers of very thinly sliced zucchini and red pepper.  Too much for 2 people but great for leftovers.

I loved this recipe, and like so many before, so did my husband. 
I added about a cup of white beans to the sauce. I also substituted cottage cheese for the cheddar. I used about half the tomatoes reccomended, but found that it could have used a little more.

This was great! Made a few changes, however. Skipped the shell idea and baked in a pan. Added a whole jar of roasted red peppers (chopped) to the tomato sauce. Try it! It's amazingly good.

This was good. I didn't have stewed tomatoes, but used diced italian. I also only used one can and lots of fresh basil. It is a little watery, but could be the diced tomatoes. Didn't have vegie boullion, just added a little salt.I also cooked the squash yesterday and threw out the shells not knowing I was going to do this recipe so I put into a baking dish.
Would make again.

I love it far more than a pasta-based variety.  Give it a try--very tasty, though a bit of work.

My whole family loved this recipe. I thought my kids wouldn't eat it and they only commented on the noodles being a little "crunchy" as they called it. The noodles are a bit more firm than actual spaghetti noodles. We really loved this recipe and will be making it again and again. Super Super Easy!

I just made this tonight and it's fabulous!  Thank you Brisak for a great recipe!  My only suggestion would be that you could add diced tofu or chicken for protein to make it a "complete" meal. Other than that...YUMMM!!!

My husband was very sceptical, but needs to watch his cholesterol.  He askes for it all the time now.  What a nice alternative!  I actually like it better than traditional lasagna.  You don't have that heavy feeling in your stomach all day after you eat it.  My husband says this is "Super Delicious!"

Ths was absolutely fantastic!  I don't like black olives, so used a can of quartered artichoke hearts, which I cut into smaller pieces, instead.  (That was suggested in an earlier comment.)  I also did not cook it in the shells.  At the end of the cooking time, the cheese on top was not browned, so I put the oven on broil for a few minutes.

I thought this was really tasty, but my husband wasn't a huge fan - he's not big on squash or pumpkins so I was hoping this recipe would be one to win him over in disguise but it wasn't!

Very very good.  I did not have bullion, so I skipped it.  I also did not have much shredded mozz, so I cut up some fresh mozz, and added that.  I used a ton of crushed red pepper, and sauteed garlic, and then just used a jar spaghetti sauce.  My spaghetti sauce happened to be RAO Sausage variety.  The dish was very good.  I also microwaved my squash to make cooking easier.  Great starter recipe that can be added to, or even made easier by using prepared sauce!  YUM

When I first tried this recipe, I thought this was good, but I just dont know if I would have it again. I had a lot of leftovers (and didnt want to throw it away) so I tried it the second/third day. Wow! It was better the second day and even better than that on the third day. I took some to work and allowed a couple people to try it. Now they want the recipe. Thank you for submitting this recipe. Dawn

This couldn't be any easier!  I used a few shortcuts and it was a snap!  while baking some rolls, I just wrapped each squash half in aluminum foil tightly and placed on the bare oven rack.  The oven was at 375 and even at that, it took much longer than half hour..more closer to 50 min.  It shredded fine with still a little crunch and the shell held up very nicely and was sturdy to fill.  I used bottled Ragu which I like to keep on hand just for times like this!  I just eyeballed the cheeses, didn't bother measuring.  I did bake at 375...I think 325 would be too low of a temp for the cheese to bubble nicely on top...it took about the same amt. of time as stated in the recipe.  I have always used spaghetti squash in place of semolina and this is a wonderful recipe to keep on hand for a super quick and tasty meal!  thanks for the great idea.

Excellent.  I used two cans tomato sauce instead of the stewed tomatos, and sauted half a red bell pepper and a handful of mushrooms with the onion.  I also added a little crushed red pepper to the sauce along with the black, and cooked it in a 2.5qt casserole dish.  

The texture is definiatly different from regular spaghetti, but it works well in this dish.  Very filling.

absolutely fabulous. I didn't really know what to expect, but I was VERY pleasantly surprised. Probably one of the best recipes I've tried off of this site (and I use it atleast twice a week)

The only things I changed were that I used spaghetti sauce instead of stewed tomatoes, and I also added green peppers. I think the green peppers really added flavor as well!

Excellent way to use spaghetti squash which has no taste by itself! However I had to double the amount of sauce.  Another option is to use one can of Hunts 4 cheeses sauce and this recipe together.  Easy and tasteful. My husband really liked it and he's not a big squash person. The amount of sauce needed is in direct proportion to the size of the spaghetti squash you purchase.  And don't skimp on the sauce!

I made this dish with a squash from my first garden.  The 5 of us enjoyed it and had plenty to eat.  I thought it was a little too salty but can easily be fixed for next time.  I broiled the top at the end to make the Parmesan crunchy (interesting textures).  It is a great recipe to try on someone who does't like squash; it's unique.

Wow! I am so glad that I tried this recipe.  I had never even seen spaghetti squash before and I was shocked to see that it looks just like angel hair pasta.  It is a little more crunchy than real pasta but just as good.  If you're like me and smother your pasta with sauce anyway, then you'll never notice the difference.  And the calories you save will make the little extra effort well worth while. My squash had to bake for 45 min. Also, I added a small can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce and I substituted fresh mushrooms for the olives.  Also, I did not add the boullion and I never missed it. I also used fat free cheese (doesn't melt quite right but still tastes alright). Yum! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

We decided to add some turkey burger to the sauce.  I used what was in my pantry so I used a can of diced tomatoes, a can of tomato sauce and a can of tomato paste.  Then let that simmer while the squash was baking.  I also added some ricotta cheese with the mozzerala to make it more like real lasagna.  Pretty good.

Fantastic!!!!  I modified this by using one can stewed tomatoes & leftover tomatoes from the garden.  Also, I used beef bouillon instead of vegetable.  We used this as a main entree & it was very filling.  I liked this better than regular lasagna.

This was my first experience with spaghetti squash.  What a fun food!  This is a great recipe.  I added about a 1/2 cup of cottage cheese just because I needed to use it up.  My family loved it.

We loved this recipe - baking in the shell is a great idea!  I cooked the squash in the microwave as it was taking too long in the oven.

Didn’t have stewed tomatoes so used prepared marinara sauce, 2 tbsp. Basil, omitted veggie bouillon, added a pound of ground beef cooked with the onions and garlic.  It was very good.  Would definitely make it again.  Hubby is not a big veggie fan (which is why I added ground beef), but he still wouldn’t try it. Maybe tomorrow.  Will make again but without ground beef since I’ll be eating it alone.

We loved this!  I did use jar spaghetti sauce, left out the broth. Otherwise everything else is the same plus threw in some mushrooms, cauliflower and some sweet turkey sausage (Jenni-o). Easy, great tasting, will definitely make again.

I nixed the shells as well, baked in a 9 X 13 Pyrex casserole dish, added ground lamb into the tomato mixture and it was outstanding and still very healthy!   This recipe will be going into my meal planning rotation.

This is a tasty side dish. I followed the recipe as written except for using only 1 can of stewed tomatoes as that was all I had on hand and I'm not sure the shells would have held the additional can anyway. I would make this again!

I am new to using spaghetti squash.  I wasn't sure what to do with it.  This recipe works well.   I work so I just used a jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce instead of making the sauce from scratch.  I also halved the black olives and added equal amounts of artichoke hearts.  It was yummy!

Added extra lean ground beef to make it a main dish and didn’t add the olives bc I didn’t have any. Put it in a lasagna dish instead of the shells and it rubbed out great! It made a lot so I was able to meal prep for 4 days :)

I will definitely make this again and again! I omitted the olives and used seasoned diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. I also added a layer of cooked ground beef and ricotta cheese (because what lasagna doesn’t have ricotta in it?). My daughter is gluten-free so this worked for her.

I added 1 lb of italian sausage (I browned the sausage and then cooked the garlic and onion with it), eliminated the bullion altogether (plenty of flavor without it), and mixed it all up into a 9x13 pan saving the parmesan cheese for the top.  It was so good!  Enjoyed the sauce!  Loved the lower carb and higher vitamin/fiber content by the using the spaghetti squash instead of pasta.  Yummy!!!

I decided to throw the sauce in my ninja and purée it because I’m not a fan of chunky sauce or chunks of tomato and it came out texture wise, smelling and tasting AMAZING. My husband (who is NOT a big fan of garlic) was blown away by how good it was. One small squash was enough for a family of four easily. This was a delicious meal and it honestly didn’t take much time at all. I’d give it 10 stars if I could!! For those who have a hard time getting veggies into their family, this recipe is for you!

Don'tcha love... "I made it exactly like the recipe, but..." 
Well, me too. My changes were instead of tomatoes, I used a jar of Rao's marinara. (Too lazy to run back to the supermarket after just coming from there.) That and I too used chicken bouillon. 
But the result was terrific. I'll definitely be making this again.

I am always looking for dishes my gluten intolerant wife can enjoy.  This recipe gave me the idea of just making my regular lasagna but using spaghetti squash instead of gluten free pasta.  It worked really well.  Thanks for the idea!

Even though I did not have olives and vegetable boullion, my squash spheghetti lasagna style. Next time I may not even use the shell and make a big container of lasagna with more vegetables like red peppers, green peppers, carrots, zucchini and whatever I feel like. I may make one with ground turkey and vegetables one with plain vegetables for my Christmas get together:)

Super yummy! Squash took longer to bake than 35 mins. Added sausage and omitted black olives just to suit personal taste. My son (who doesn't like squash and was very skeptical) said we can keep it on "the list".... haha

I started with a traditional Italian sofrito and finished with fresh mozzarella pearls. Beyond all expectations and I will be making it again and again.

Really tasty, but I did add some ingredients (a small amount of sweet italian sausage and a few mushrooms). I would decrease the Parmesan a bit as I thought a full cup was a little too much.

Two times made, and it is an overall success.

Two notes:

1. Ignore the 35 minute roast time and just cook it until done. Neither time was  35 minutes enough.

2. Using "fire-roasted " tomatoes adds a lot of depth

I love spaghetti squash, but this recipe did not do anything for me. Cooking time for the squash is way off. I always lay my cooked strands on paper towel to absorb as much of the water as possible. I have also found that any recipe that involves using the outer skin as a baking dish, will result in a very wet product. Toss the skin and use a baking dish. This recipe was also very very bland.  I added italian seasoning, extra black pepper and 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic. Italian sausage in the sauce or even ground beef will improve the heartiness of the dish. Won't make this again.

My mom makes this a lot. She adds a bag of baby spinach, and it's delicious! Since I've started making it, I've made a few additions. I use kalamata olives. I reduce the amount of basil--1 tbsp of dried basil is way too much. I recommend taking it down to 1 tsp at the most or using fresh basil. Thyme is also a nice addition.

Very good low carb recipe!  I added some ground turkey and cooked it like lasagna with some goat's cheese. 2 out of my 4 children ate it, but the two who did not eat it are very picky eaters and they thought that the noodles were too "crunchy" and "weird". My husband and I enjoyed the meal and we didn't feel overly stuffed after having dinner like we would have with traditional lasagna. I would make this again!

Fantastic recipe! Just make these tiny adjustments and you won't have to worry about any problems at all: * Add 3-4 layers of lasagna pasta in between. (Boil them first, rinse and put them on a plate or so) * You can use tomato paste (a full 6 oz can) with an addition of garlic-tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes. I used 16 oz of the warm water leftover from the lasagna to make the tomato sauce.  ** These two additions to this recipe will make a perfect looking/tasting dish. No excess water. I used a 6 oz black olives and chopped them instead of slicing. I cut the squash in half with the help of the kitchen scissors on the sides and a knife on the bottom. This feeds a 4 ppl family easily. It would be good for a 6 people dinner with a salad on the side. Our family aren't big fans of squash or black olives, but they loved this dish!

Instead of canned tomatoes I used bottle of Francesco Rinaldi traditional spaghetti sauce no salt added, 23.5 oz. from walmart.  I sauteed 1 ch.onion, 2 ch. garlic cloves and 1/4 c. ch. green pepper.  I added spaghetti sauce and tried to cook it down for about 30 min. (not sure I made it thicker or not).  I added basil, oregano, 1 crushed chicken bouillion cube and just a small amt. of sugar to sauce.  I poked several holes in bottom of squash shells and layered squash strands, sauce, ch. black olives and mozz. cheese up to top of shells, topped with a little more mozz. cheese and then grated parm. cheese.  Baked in oven for about 20-25 min. and then put under broiler to brown the cheese.  It was very good. 2019 changes .  Left out sugar and bouillon cube still very good  layered in most of a can of mushrooms .  I did 2 layers of squash , sauce, olives, cheese and  mushrooms and then topped with parm cheese.  Didn't  poke hokes in  shells but probably  should  have as I had to try and tip shells and drain liquid before we ate them .

We liked this.  I halved the recipe as I had used 1/2 the spaghetti squash in another recipe, but kept the onion and garlic the same. Added a dash of red pepper flakes and italian seasoning, used fresh basil, and shredded a mix of mozzarella, Parmesan, Asiago and provolone.

Excellent way to serve spaghetti squash.  For easier preparation I used a tomato and basil jarred sauce, sautéing  onion and garlic until most of the liquid was gone.  Simmered sauce until very thick.  I  didn't add any extra vegetables or meat but probably will in the future.  Cut the squash lengthwise and oven baked cut side down in a little water about an hour at 350°.  The grated parmesan really added an interesting texture so I'm sure adding cottage cheese or ricotta would be good too.  Husband said to be sure to keep this recipe.  He  loved it.  Oh and letting it sit for about 20-30 minutes  after baking really helps water absorption so it's not too watery when serving.

Had to let squash cook 15 minutes longer. Too hard to scrape out. My family said it was a change from regular old lasagna!  Took a bit to getting used to.., however it is good.
Our whole family is switching to vegetarian so it WILL all taste different!

This is really good. I added 3/4 lb ground beef. I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I just used diced tomatoes.  I also used dried chopped onion and about 1/2 of a small can of chopped green chilies.  After that had cooked on the stove top for about 20 minutes, I used a potato masher to  mash up the mixture a bit so the sauce was more smooth. My husband and I are not typically squash eaters but I've been trying to add in some more healthy meals. We both said that we could substitute this for the  more unhealthy version of Lasagna 9 out of 10 times!  Maybe we can make strides towards a more healthy life!

This was so good that grandchildren took leftovers for school lunch.  I really veered off recipe, however.  Made own marinara sauce (12 garlic cloves, onion, 2 lg cans tomatoes, tomato paste, 2/3 cup olive oil, salt pepper, 1 tsp Italian seasoning), layer of ricotta cheese, fried Italian sausage, spaghetti squash.  The texture and taste were wonderful.

I added ground Italian sausage to the sauce and sprinkled kalamatas on top.  This was SO good!

Made this tonight and added sliced baby bellas. I also substituted tomato paste, diced tomatoes, and vegetable broth. My skeptic husband and friend absolutely loved it. This is going to be my go to spaghetti squash dish.

Great idea for spaghetti squash, needs some tweaks in the preparation to make sure it doesn't get runny. I always roast the squash itself for better flavor and exture. I'd recommend cutting back on the stewed tomatoes because the squash will release its own liquid and too much liquid won't make this "lasagna style". I left out the olives because I don't like olives but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Next time I'll add some cottage or ricotta to make it even more like a lasagna. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I did the short cut of adding sauce instead of canned tomatoes. Added mushrooms and ricotta cheese. My hubby said this was the best squash I've ever made. DO put in a 9x13" pan. I thought it was going to be too thin so I put it in an 8x8 and it almost overflowed. Super yummy!

I really loved this even though I made a few changes to it. I do not like olives so those were left out. Rather than using stewed tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic and a can of fire roasted tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. Since I wasn't using the olives I made a ricotta, egg and parsley mixture to layer with everything else. So, I did a layer of spaghetti squash then a layer of ricotta followed by the tomato sauce and the mozzarella and parmesan. I repeated these layers finishing it with the bit of spaghetti squash and tomato sauce I had left then topped it with some mozz and parm.

I used a combination of Romano/Parmesan/old cheddar as my cheeses. The sharpness of the cheeses compliments the mild flavour of the squash! 
I also made it in a casserole dish, the shells would have been neat but I was kind of in a hurry!
This recipe turned out great!

this is a great way to use spaghetti squash!  Here is how I elevated the recipe:  I used a base of onions, green peppers, garlic and mushrooms.  Added some club house vegetable spice mix and thyme while cooking the veggies.  Threw in some frozen spinach, added pureed tomatoes and diced tomatoes and some chili flakes and cooked it down.  All the meatlovers in this house loved it.

Added ground beef and Italian sausage for more flavour. Hubby & kids liked it. Was a little runny at bottom but used a slotted spoon to serve and it wasn't a big deal.

I love spaghetti squash but knew this would be pretty bland as written, at least for me. For the squash, I line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and roast as directed. It makes clean up easy. Once cooled, scrape the squash with a large spoon, a soup or serving spoon will do. It's easier and faster than a fork. I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with spicy red pepper and fresh basil and oregano. Layered it an 11 x 7 dish instead of the shells. Next time I would add a bit of crushed red pepper and smoked mozzarella would be wonderful.

This recipe was a delicious way to enjoy spaghetti squash. I did however take a different route from the recipe regarding the presentation. The original author bakes the mixture in the left over squash shells which I found creative. We needed to make it more portable though so my husband can take it to work. So this recipe was layered in a lasagna type fashion: sauce, squash, olives, and mozzarella. You repeat the layering and top it off with parmesan cheese. This recipe was seasoned to taste and finished off in the oven. This was fun to make and tasty as well.

This is so yummy! While I made the sauce, I let the squash drain in a colander. I cooked down the sauce so there wasn't much liquid. When this came out of the oven, it was delicious and I had no problems with it being runny. I liked using the shells to serve it, it worked well for me.

this is my favorite way to have spagetti squash - i cooked it in the oven, ( days before)- then just used the concept of layering the strands with marinara sauce and cheeses - and it was a hit!  Makes a great vehicle for the sauce and cheese - filling but way healthier!

Will definitely make again.  Used jarred spaghetti sauce since I was short on time, and I added sausage.  Baked in a 13x9 since I was using leftover squash and no longer had the shells. Yum!

This was exceptional! I included no-boil lasagna noodles because I like carbs ;) It was delicious and perfect and I will make this over and over again. Might throw in some crumbled sage sausage next time for the carnivorous boyfriend.

Having had spaghetti squash before that was only so-so, this was very good. We also modified to include italian sausage in the sauce and it was yum.  The kids still had some issues with the texture but my husband enjoyed it.

This was my first time trying spaghetti squash and I can't believe how good this was!!!  Even the meat eaters loved it!!  The only thing I changed was to cook the squash a little longer and I used spaghetti sauce instead of stewed tomatoes.  It was fantastic!!!!

This recipe was fabulous! I had roasted and shredded the strands out of a spaghetti squash the evening before and wasn't sure what to do with it. This recipe hit the spot with the entire family - I followed the lead of Lfharders (most helpful positive review) and made the exact substitutions. Since my squash was in the fridge, I had to make sure I squeezed most of the extra water from it so it didn't water log the dish. As I sit here eating leftovers, all I can think of is that this is a wonderful comfort food as fall begins!

I'm not a huge fan of black olives, but with the squash and cheese, it really needs that tang to round it out. I loved this recipe! My husband is a huge carnivore and he didn't miss the meat at all!

This was fantastic! Never had Spaghetti Squash and this was soooo good, and it fit right into my diet. I used Ragu with a few added herbs and mushrooms instead of olives.

Love it! Have used this recipe often as an alternative to pasta. Have used green olives or mushrooms instead of the black olives which I usually do not have on hand. A great meatless meal.

All of the flavor and *none* of the guilt.  Threw in beef bouillion b/c that's what I had, and a pound of beef and half a pound of sausage (otherwise the hubby wouldn't eat it), and it was amazing. I didn't think it needed the olives - it was already salty enough.

Just recently discovered spaghetti squash- WOW!  What a great alternative to pasta.  I used a chicken bouillion cube as that is what I had.  Omitted the olives- don't like them.  Cooked the squash for 50 minutes after sprinkling with a little Italian seasoning.  Added a 9.5 oz bag of turkey sausage crumbles to the tomato mixture.  Used fat free mozz cheese.  Baked in a 9X13 dish.  Delicious!  Will def make again but I think I will try another reviewer's suggestion of using jar spaghetti sauce in place of the stewed toms- not a fan of those big chunks.  Pretty good warned up the next day but best when fresh from the oven.

Will definitely make this again.  My 3-year-old loved it, and my 1-year-old had three (kid-sized) helpings.  The only changes I made were that I left out the olives and I used a beef bouillon cube instead of vegetable.

We followed a suggestion from another member and used Bertolli Tomato & Basil sauce and omitted the tomatoes.  Other than that, followed recipe to a T. Definitely bake squash in oven versus microwave. And be sure to scrape all of your squash out of rinds - noticed in quite a few photos that so much was left in some of the rinds.

This is a great recipe. I am eating a low glycemic diet and was needing some new tastes in my life. Spaghetti squash is ok but not my favorite vegetable, but this is a fantastic way to incorporate it into your diet. I used a part skim 4 Italian cheese blend for the cheese, and used a chicken bouillon cube as that is what I had and it was wonderful. I baked it, covered,  in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes or more until it was hot through taking the cover off the last 10 minutes or so.

This was a great recipe - it worked out really well. I improvised with the sauce because I didn't have exactly the right ingredients. I used a big can of tomato sauce instead of the stewed tomatoes and a chicken bouillon instead of a veggie one. The only thing I would say is watch out for the salt with the bouillon and the canned tomatoes. But other than that: Delicious!

This recipe turned out AMAZING.  What a great way to prepare this type of squash!  Like other reviewers, I chose to layer the ingredients in a pan, rather than the squash shells.

This is our new favorite way to use spaghetti squash. We added mushrooms and crushed red peppers to the sauce. Loved cooking and serving in the shells, it looked good and allowed you to get maximum squash out. Cooked the seeds with the garlic salt, great idea.

I thought this was really good... I made this dish for a friend who had never tried Spaghetti Squash and she was surprised that she liked it. I loved the presentation but I layered it different in the 2nd half.... I did the squash, sauce and cheese because I like the cheese on the sauce but it all taste to same.... Great with pepper flakes!

Don't be turned off by the cook time shown. You can microwave the halved squash for 8 minutes instead of baking. And although I followed the recipe for the stewed tomato sauce, you could even use jar spaghetti sauce. This was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend said it was one of his favorites. Also made excellent leftovers for lunch the next day. Will definitely make again!

This didn't scream "lasagna" when I ate it, but it definitely did hit that Italian food craving nicely!  I cheated and cooked my 3lb squash in its shell in the micro.  I added about a half pound of ground beef to the sauce so I could get some more protein in.  Next time I'll probably use more tomatoes or less onions- the balance was off, but still tasty.  I used an Italian seasoning blend instead of basil. This filled a 9x9 pan nicely.  Will definitely try again with a few changes!

I love spaghetti squash but get tired of just adding pasta and this dish was perfect.  All I added extra basil and Italian seasoning with a sprinkle of crushed red pepper to spice it up.  My husband loved it!

I had to add a bit of italian ground sausage (bout 1/2 lb) for flavor and filling. The shells are a nice presentation piece but prefer to make it in a baking dish. Other than that it is a great twist on lasagna and I will def make it again. Lasagna is versatile; as is this. Have fun with it

Yum!  My husband who isn't a big fan of squash or tomatoes loved this, and so did our picky three year old!  We're not a fan of olives, so I left those out but did throw in a pound of sausage instead.  For cheeses I used a 6 Italian cheese blend instead of just mozzarella (it's in there of course).  I used Italian style stewed tomatoes, and my sausage was sage seasoned.  Very simple tasty recipe that I plan on making again.

I roasted all the vegetables in a tiny bit of olive oil before baking.  Also, used a mix of fat free mozarella and pepper jack for some spice.

very good. the next time i do this, i am going to mix the squash and sauce together and then maybe layer a little more sauce once in the shells because i found it was a little dry. i used sauce i had on hand in the freezer and just topped with mozzarella. it was really tasty - i would make this again.

First, the squash had to be baked at 350F for an hour.  Second, the end product was bland and unfulfilling, but it wasn't inedible.  It may have been better with ground beef in the sauce, but the squash was tasteless and the coonsistency did not go well with the sauce. I think this may be a recipe for vegetarians, not for omnivores who enjoy tasty vegetarian meals.  Still this is the worst recipe I have tried at this site.

First time having Spaghetti Squash, I could not believe how delicious it was. Great diet food- you really feel like your eating Spaghetti! The leftover are suprisingly good- unlike reheating pasta.

Very good! Layered the cooked spaghetti squash and the other ingredients (minus olives, which I forgot) in a 13" x 9" lasagna pan, with some ricotta cheese. The only thing to watch for/be aware of is that squash doesn't absorb as much juice as lasagna noodles, so it was a bit on the runny side. Next time, I'll know to cut back a bit on the tomatoes/ sauce. Other than that, it was excellent!

Good recipe, and so healthy. Although I modified it just a touch so it's not quite as healthy- I put in about twice as much cheese. I figured I could get away with it since the veggies are sauteed in cooking spray. Oh, and I added a whole green pepper, so maybe that makes up for the extra cheese :-) Great sauce though, really good flavors. A wonderfully- vegetabley dish!

Really good recipe. I only used a 6 oz can of olives because normally I find black olives frightening. I added some fresh mushrooms I had to use and some shredded cheddar.  It took a long time to reduce & thicken the sauce. Like others, I just baked it in a 9x13 pan. Everyone liked it.

This was the first time I've ever had spaghetti squash.  At first I was worried that I wouldn't like the sauce, but it was absolutly perfect in the dish.  The spaghetti squash was really crunchy...I think it's something you have to get used to.

This was very, very good.  We loved it!  I added some Italian turkey sausage to satisfy my fiance's need for meat.  We had a lot of leftovers and reheated this lasagna for lunches throughout the week.  I would definitely make this again.

I didn't think I would really like this but I gave it a try and it was great. I sauteed onions and mushrooms then added a jar of spaghetti sauce added my usual spices and some brown sugar to take the acidity out of the sauce.  Everyone that tried it LOVED IT.   Thanks I will make this again.

Only 4 stars, because I did make some changes...I recommend adding finely/thinly sliced green olives or capers with the black olives. Also,  a layer of lean beef or lean pork sausage makes it a hearty meal and still LOW IN CALORIES AND CARBS.  If trying to keep it vegetarian, add some spinach...thanks for a great/healthy lasagna! It's a keeper!

I loved this recipe.  I left out the olivesand used tomatoes with jalapenos for a kick.  Sprinkled the squash with salt before cooking it.  I baked it in a dish instead of the rind because then my son would've probably caught on that it was squash!  He liked it OK saying it was "too chunky", but he ate it!  And I LOVED it!  We will be making this again, and maybe I can make it less "chunky" for my son!

This was a great meal.  I did substitute diced petit tomatoes for the stewed type, and just sprinkled a little parm on top before baking.  This seemed to work well.

I hadn't had spaghetti squash since I was a kid & thought I'd try it again.  Turns out, didn't like it then & don't like it now.  There's no way my kids would eat this.  I couldn't even do it. I'm not one to throw away food but this recipe went in the rubbermaid circular file.

This was pretty good.  I prefer pasta.  I was about to throw out the leftover spaghetti squash and then I found this recipe.  If you don't like spaghetti squash you probably won't be too fond of this.  If I ever make spaghetti squash again I will most likely use this recipe to use up any leftovers.

I too didnt think that I liked spaghetti squash, so after reading all of these reviews I had to try it and it was really good. I didnt realize that the squash itself was pretty bland, so you can really taste whatever you put on it. I didnt do all the layers and bake for lack of time. I made the sauce and poured it over the squash like you would spaghetti sauce and then topped with cheese and it was great.

I personally did not like this, BUT I have to give it 4 stars because it seemed to trick my 4 year old!  He is very anti-veggie, but loves lasagna, so I gave it a shot.  He didn't gobble it up, but took a couple of bites and didn't seem to notice! Thank you!

This was pretty good.  I added artichoke which was tasty.  I wasn't anywhere close to fitting in all the ingredients into the two halves of the squash, and I ended up having enough to make a whole other pan of it in a casserole dish!  I also recommend cooking the seeds on the pan with the squash... that made for a good appetizer.  I probably used about 9oz of olives rather than 15oz, and it was still really olive-y.

Very tasty!  My husband actually eats squash this way!  I might up the tomatoes next time I make it.

This was really good.  We added artichoke hearts, pepperoncinis, and red peppers. Yumm.

I think it was good, but a bit bland. I added 8 oz of tofu to the tomato sauce. I used a baking dish (8"x11")instead of the shells. It turned out to be quite watery.

This is the first time I prepared anything with spaghetti squash, so I was a little nervous. However, we loved it! My husband had three helpings! I did change the stewed tomatoes to crushed tomatoes to make it more saucy so kids would like it (they didn't)...but my hubby and I give it a thumbs up!

Good way to do squash, and my husband LOVES it. Can be made with just one can of tomatoes, and I find that intensifies the flavours and also makes a reasonable amount of sauce. The way it's written makes a lot of extra sauce, which is okay too! I have used 3 tablespoons of fresh basil instead of dried, and it's great with that too. Fun to serve it in the shells.

This was a good, healthy, and easy dinner and we will definitely make it again.  I added a touch of cayenne pepper to the tomatoes to give the sauce a little zip.  It also took longer to bake the squash than the recipe indicated.  Husband says cut back the cheese a little.  It worked perfectly for our family to serve it out of the shells since some of us like olives and some don't, so I could make one shell with and one without.  We have 5 in our family and we all liked it enough to give it a 4 or 5.

OH, Yum!  I really liked this for a healthy, hearty dinner with a salad.  I did not use the Parmesan as it seemed like too much cheese, and it was great without it (and lower in fat!)  Like others, I used a baking dish for convenience.

I made this for our church's Thanksgiving dinner. It was a hit. The only thing I did different was I used one can of jalapeno-spiced stewed tomatoes and one can of regular stewed tomatoes, cuz that's what I had in my cupboard. It made the lasagna a little spicier than expected. But it was still delicious. It was the hit of the Thanksgiving dinner (much better than tofurky if you're a vegetarian on the holiday), everyone wanted the recipe. Thankfully I thought ahead and brought 10 copies with me. :-)

This recipe came out quite better than I thought it would. I am not a big fan of squash, but combined with the tomato sauce and cheeses this was an excellent dish. The kids all loved it!

Not being a fan of pasta or tomato sauce I found this recipe an excellent substitute. Once you get the hang of it it's easy to just eyeball and adjust the ingredients to what you feel like. I've given this recipe to a number of people and it's been a hit every time!

Tasted okay, nothing special.  The squash was a workout to halve lengthwise, but that's not the recipes's fault.  I give it 4 stars simply because my friend's extremly picky husband gobbled it up & asked for the recipe.

We were overwhelmed with all the  amount of spaghetti squash coming out of our garden and this was a spectacular recipe to use them up!  I would recommend planning on more time preparing for this meal--it took me about an hour.  Also, I had to bake mine a lot longer!

Good. This was my first experiment with spaghetti squash. It was very pretty served in the shells, and good flavor. The tomato sauce was really easy - I added mushrooms, red wine, and used fresh basil and oregano.

I had a generous portion of chicken cacciatore in my fridge made with boneless chicken.  It had onions, peppers and olives in it.  I found this recipe and used it, adding only the mozzarella and (a sprinkling) of parmesan.  Wow, what a wonderful combination and a nice alternative to pasta.  Did I say wonderful?!?

I don't know if I would make this again.  Half my family really liked it, me & mom (who hardly likes anything "adventurous") thought it so-so.  Takes a while to scoop spaghetti strands out of squash & I had to use my hands.  Used chicken bouillon instead of veggie - I think it worked better, the flavour was very distinct.  Don't use beef.  Made 2 sets of layers in each shell, topped with cheddar and parmesan cheese (mozarella in middle).  You might use kalamata olives or unripe ones for some kick.  Lots of squash strands left over.  A good idea, but a little bland for the effort; needs more kick in sauce or mix something with squash strands for flavour before layering.

Excellent recipe- I've made it twice already! Good with green olives too. As a time saver you can also poke holes in the squash and microwave it.  It is also easier to cut it once it's cooked; cutting the squash while it's still raw can be quite a challenge.

We loved this recipe.  I used primavera tomatoes instead of stewed and I layered it in a baking dish instead of using the squash shells.  Very Very good.
