Great little recipe! It's perfect for a quick lunch, dinner or snack. Kids just loves these and they're much better than the frozen stuff. I sometimes sneak in some mushrooms if I can to add some veggies. I used "Exquistie Pizza Sauce" from this site. My niece just loves these! I always give her some extra sauce on the side for dipping.

I doubled this recipe to get 8 pockets. I made my own homemade pizza sauce and I used reduced fat crescent rolls and turkey pepperoni. The boys thought this was a fabulous idea--handheld pizza rolls! This really can bend to whatever pizza you'd like to make, really. Next time, I'd like to try this with sausage. NOTE: If you don't like crescent rolls, I'm sure this would work in a sandwich maker using two pieces of bread and be just as good.

You can also stuff them with berries and berry pie filling and glaze with icing, serve them still warm topped with ice cream or whipped cream.

The top two issues cooks seemed to have with this recipe are 1- The crescent dough opening at the seams and, 2- The dough being too sweet for a savory dish. To address those issues I decided to use the Pillsbury seamless dough AND I sprinkled garlic powder on the pockets before baking after brushing them with olive oil. I did use the parmesan cheese as well. I made 8 squares with the dough and had no issues whatsoever handling it. DO remember to prick the tops with a fork before baking to vent and therefore avoid the filling spilling on the baking sheet and ending up with a messy and empty pocket. I served this with marinara sauce to dip. Really yummy and very easy.

I cant decide on what to give this. Its between four and five stars. First off, I could not fold them diagonally, so I just made them into squares. I used a spicy basil tomato spagetti sauce instead (yum) and mexican cheese (mixed). Make sure you pinch together the sides and the seam in the middle ON BOTH SIDES! Dont have a cookie sheet like me? Put into a casserole dish and cook for 10 minutes on one side, and then 5-10 on the other. You get a really nice crispy crust, with warm ingredients. Its a good cheap meal for kids as well.

The cresents don't work well for this recipe, they fell apart entirely too easily.  I'd use a pizza crust from pillsbury instead

i made them exactly as describe and thought the filling was too much - popped out of all 4 of them while cooking - next time i will try making them with the seamless dough instead of crescents.

First off, this was a hit with my 5,6, and 9 year old kids. They "took a vote" and it was unanimous----I'm to make these instead of frozen pizza from now on. We'll see... Second, fold them diagonally? Yeah. That was SO not happening. Way easier to fold them into squares. However, using a fork to "seal" the edges works very well. I did as another review suggested: brushed each one with olive oil, sprinkled on granulated garlic and parmesan cheese, then baked for a full 16 minutes. Next time I'd like to try putting mushrooms inside as well. Thanks, these will be made again and again. :o)

It would be good if it wasn't for the crescent rolls. They are too sweet for the pizza sauce, but it was a neat idea!

Great snack or lunch idea for the kids. My 7 & 8 year olds helped me make these. We used a pizza cheese blend (mozzarella & cheddar), and also instead of pepperoni, we cut up some turkey sausages and fried them for about 2 minutes before filling the pockets. Also, we sprinkled the filling with a bit of Italian seasoning and garlic powder for extra flavor. Next time, i will add more filling to each pocket. I skimped on filling this time because i thought it would burst in oven, but it didn't and it ended up turning out great.  We would give it 5 stars easily, but because we could not fold these rectangles diagonally and had to fold them into squares, we took one point out for technicality. Wish we could do 4.5 stars. After they were done cooking (about 10 minutes), we just cut diagonally with pizza cutter. 5 stars for taste, and will definitely cook again.

Pretty good!!! 1 can of crescent rolls only makes 4 pizza pockets so if your feeding a crowd buy more...also don't skimp on the pizza sauce.

YUM!  These make a nice appetizer for a ball game.  I microwaved my pepperoni for 30 seconds to get rid of any grease as I don't like greasy pizza.  It didn't take long for these to disappear.  Thank you Pillsbury Crescents for a yummy easy recipe!

This is great with kids. You can also let them help build them and choose their own ingredients. I found this a great slumber party pick.

I served these as an evening snack, rather than as a meal.  They went over really well with everyone
who ate them.  I'll be making them again and freezing them individually, so they can be reheated in the microwave as needed.

CHICKEN PARMESAN Pockets anyone?  This recipe is great and so easy to make your own.  I baked some chicken nuggets and when heated through I cut them up into small pieces and subbed them for the pepperoni.  I did not even bother trying to fold these diagonally as 2 triangles makes a nice and easy workable rectangle.  I spread the sauce on half of the rectangle and sprinkled sauce with Italian Seasoning and topped with chicken pieces and finished with the mozzarella.  Poked each one twice with a fork and sprinkled w/parm cheese.  11 minutes is all mine needed and I cut each rectangle diagonally. I used reduced fat crescent rolls and served with steamed broccoli.  The husband and our 3 kids (7, 6 & 4) LOVED it and asked for more.  Wish I had made a second batch!

This was a super quick and easy dish! I actually had some pizza dough in the fridge so I used that instead of the cresent rolls. I cut the dough into 4 squares then layered with pepperoni, sauce, then mozzerella and rolled them up. I pinched together the ends and brushed the tops with olive oil, parmesan cheese and some garlic powder. Then, popped them in the oven for about 13 minutes. They came out great and we had no leftovers between me and my husband.

This was a recipe selection for the Allrecipe's Allstars, and I finally decided to try it. I thought they had a nice appearance coming out of the oven with the parmesan on top and the crimping. I liked the filling and I even used a homemade tomato sauce. However, the crescents were just a little rich tasting. They always seem so sweet and buttery to me. Interesting recipe to try anyhow. I might just try it with Pillsbury pizza dough, next time.

It's a mini-calzone that needs MORE. We did tweak the recipe by dropping the pepperoni and we used 3 cheeses. The crescents still soaked up too much so there wasn't enough gooeyness when we bit in. I married into an italian family so this one was held to very high standards. I doubt very much that I will make it again.

I'll give these a 1 for being good in theory.  First, you can't follow the directions to a T.  If you fold rectangle dough diagonally over filling, the dough won't line up.  Not a big deal, but just thought I'd mention it.  Second, the dough is kind of a pain in the you-know-what to work with.  Plus, I assembled them on a pastry mat and then transferred to a bake sheet but they wanted to tear apart.  Third, the flavor of the crescent dough and pizza sauce just didn't go well together.  Lastly, when you look at the market value of the crescent dough and pepperoni, these are kind of an expensive little snack, which my husband threw half of in the trash.

We loved this. I used the large crescent rolls instead of the smaller ones but kept the ingredient measurements. They got a little too dark (my fault, running my mouth, lol) but they had a nice crispy outside and gooey inside. I also just folded them over instead of diagonally folding them - it just would not work for me. Definitely would make them again.

My kids loved these! I folded the dough over to make a square and had pretty good success keeping all the filling in.  Great recipe for a quick easy dinner for the kids.

This was ok.  I made them in squares because a triangle looked impossible with the shape of the dough.  The perforations were hard to keep closed but they did.  I thought that the dough was a little too sweet for this.  I would rather use pizza dough.

The kids loved these & loved helping to make them.  I didn't have pepperoni so I used hamburger mixed with the pizza sauce.  The adults weren't as impressed but that didn't surprise me.  It was a fun afternoon project with the kids.

My children enjoyed them. I will note that I made them vegetarian & left out the meat. I replaced the meat with some veggies & fresh basil.  I wouldn't really recommend these for adults because the crescent rolls seem too sweet for the savory filling. Also it was extremely messy to put together.   It was a good test recipe.

These were okay. I agree with the post that says the crescent rolls are too sweet.  I love these as rolls and in sweet dishes but not so much in savory...

These were better than I thought they were going to be!  I couldn't figure out the "folding diagonally" part (I suck at geometry) so I patted all mine out into circles and then folded them up like a fried pie.  Whatever shape you use, however, is pretty stinkin' awesome.  I want to try it with different "toppings" and see what I can come up with.  I just made these for a snack at home, but they'd be handy for a party.  Very tasty!

Sooooo fast to make, and the kids will love it. It is definitely the type of meal you need on one of those days you forget to cook and then realize its an hour until bedtime. I would suggest salting the top of the pocket before baking, and don't be stingy on the cheese.

I made these exactly as written, but I used the reduced fat crescent rolls! I just shaped them into domes because it was so much easier! These were VERY good, as I knew they would be because I love anything made with crescent rolls! These were like little fluffy pillows of pizza goodness!

Easy and they taste much better than the frozen alternatives. I love the way the crescents taste in this application! It's the perfect, flaky crust.

Nothing special, but a nice go-to recipe with leftover pizza toppings.  Could use more filing, though.

The concept is very good. They are very cute and my kids loved them. The crescent rolls are way to small which made them very difficult to work with. They weren't big enough for a reasonable portion of filling, so it took a long time to manhandle them and get them to cooperate. Next time I would use regular dough and cut it to the size I wanted for the pockets or buy lots of crescent rolls and make them double wides.

Dough is hard to work with unless really cold.  To much filling and to sweet for pizza.  May be good for dessert.

This was another tasty and quick recipe. The one thing I would recommend would be to not be afraid to really stuff these. I was and it came out too thin. Other than that, delicious!

This made a great, quick lunch for me and the girls today! The only thing I did differently was to fold the crescent rectangle in 1/2 instead of diagonally b/c it wouldn't match up right, lol. I will def make these again...the girls inhaled them! Thanks for sharing. :)

Tastes good, very quick and very versatile. Great for lunches or quick dinners for two. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's not a show-stopper, but it is a good solid recipe

These are super-tasty, but I almost didn't make them because of the fat content... Found a few ways to tone down the fat content, though. I used the low-fat crescent rolls, found turkey pepperoni that has 70% less fat (and I couldn't even tell a difference in taste!), and shredded mozzarella made with 2% low-fat milk. I made two batches of them and six people demolished them in about five minutes after they were out of the oven! Will definitely be making this again (soon).

My family really enjoyed this recipe, it was a bit time consuming, but it was worth the work because everyone loved them.  I also added mushrooms, but you could add any pizza topping that you like!  The kids thought they were better then Hot Pockets, so I guess that is a hit!

I read the reviews and made sure not to overfill the crescent pockets.  So what I ended up with was some crescent rolls with not much filling, so I served them with a side of some pizza sauce for dipping.  I can see trying to use one triangle and making these into appetizers (yield 8), but they really don't taste much like pizza.  I really like crescent rolls and these were OK, but I probably won't make again.

These were ok!  Nice and easy for Monday Night Football however I did have some trouble with the dough.  Partly it was my fault for stuffing the rectangles so much and partly because the dough wouldn't stick even after I used the fork.  I think this would be a great treat to make with kids.  :)

As always, easy, fast and super easy to customize. We're vegan, so are crescents! Just subbing in vegan cheese and vegan pepperoni made these vegan (and great). I like to roll the toppings into the crescents sometimes, too. customize with any veggies or other pizza toppings you like.

These were tasty, but I had a difficult time with the dough. I think maybe the crescent sheets would work better with this recipe. I attempted to fold diagonally, but just made a huge mess and ended up just folding them in half - much easier.

Decent, but messy in the prep.  The crescents DO NOT match up evenly to make a nice pretty triangle like in the picture.  I separated the triangles immediately--the hardest part was ensuring they were sealed.  I added minced onion and red pepper to the 'adult' ones for a more grown up taste.  This needs more playing with--also, the dough is sweet enough that it throws the taste 'off' from traditional pizza.

I am a little embarrassed to admit that I had some trouble with this recipe. I struggled with the fact that it  says to fold the rectangles on the diagonal. Maybe I need to repeat Geometry (very likely) but I don't believe there is any way to fold a rectangle of dough on the diagonal and have it meet up. If it were a square this would work. I just folded my rectangles in half to form squares. Once I got past that everything else worked out just fine. Kids will love these! I could see adding additional ingredients and mixing it up a little.

What a nice quick snack!  Instead of putting the sauce on the inside, I made it more of a calzone with a touch of ricotta cheese.  I brushed the top with olive oil and sprinkled on garlic salt and parmesan cheese.  Yum.

These pockets were ok. I found them a little bit too buttery for my taste, but my family gobbled them up with no complaints. I will definately be making these again for the little ones. Great idea and a super easy dinner idea for us busy moms.

I made these twice.  First time followed recipe exactly.  During baking the pockets split open. Also when taking a bite the whole peperoni came out with one bite.  Second time I changed it up a bit by using (8 oz) Pillsbury® Crescent Recipe Creations® refrigerated seamless dough sheet.  With  sheet you don't have to worry about the seam splitting open.  I also diced the peperoni.  Instead of folding diagonally I folded the rectangle in half making a square.  These make a fun, fast snack or lunch.

Amazing and easy. My husband made these at my request as I can not have dairy. He made mine without cheese. Everyone at my office was drooling over my lunch. 
A good trick my husband found was to put the sauce and meat toppings in a food processor. I thought it was gross, but when I tried it I was a convert!
We used the instant pizza dough package.
We put pepperoni, left over bacon and leftover breakfeast sausage. YUMMMY!
I like mine with more sauce though.

Kids loved these, and they were simple and fast to make them for lunch.  I used turkey pepperoni and topped them with a little garlic seasoning before baking.  Make sure and seal the edges really well, as we had a few that "leaked" during the baking process.

Tasted great! My only complaint is that 4 servings was not enough for a main dish for 2 people! This was really easy to make on a weeknight, and I will definitely be making it again in the near future.

Thought these were very good and a good way to use up some crescents.  Only thing was I didn't add enough sauce - so in the future I know to add more or heat some up to serve as a dip

I made this for lunch today. It was pretty good. The only thing I dont like is that the crecent dough is sweet, unlike pizza dough. But I like them alot. Im going to see how they taste re-heated because I didnt have anyone to share these with.

my son is a total pizza lover but pizza dough is too heavy on my stomach.  I thought I would give this recipe a shot and we both LOVED it.  The Crescent roll is nice and light and gives the pockets a great flavor!

I liked this, my kids liked it, but there is room for improvement. My first problem was making the triangles. I did a double batch and when I tried to do triangle on the first half, I ended up with misshapen balls. So I did the second half as a rectangle and they worked much better. My second problem was related to my first - because of the difficulties in folding the pockets, I couldn't use much sauce. So I ended up with something that tasted like a crescent roll with a touch of tomato and cheese. Not sure how to fix this problem except to perhaps roll out the dough to a larger and thinner rectangle. But it was an easy meal to make that was easy (and not messy because of the light sauce) to eat in the car.

Quick and easy, and WAY less expensive than take out.  I didn't have any real issues creating these lil' gems, and my son loved them.  I followed the recipe w/ the exception of grating the cheese.  I just took two mozzarella slices from a package and put 1/2 a piece in each lil' pocket.  Saves time, and my family doesn't like too much cheese anyway.  Next time, I'll try ham and pineapple, or veggie. I also had a difficult time folding them in triangles, so just elected to fold into squares.  I rolled the sides up then pressed them with a fork, seemed to work well w/ no leakage of the yummy middle.

These are delicious! Like many reviewers, I folded them into squares and topped them with olive oil and Parmesan cheese. Although it seemed to take twice as long to assemble them as it did to eat them, we will definitely be having these again. Next time, I may try just using the crescent rolls as a crust in a jelly roll pan and make a regular pizza with them; seems like it would be less mess and less prep time!

The taste of these were fine. I didn't think the sweetness of the crescent rolls took anything away. I think the execution could use some work. Trying to seal those suckers and then get them in to a 6x4 rectangle took a little trial and error. Also, if I used the amounts that the recipe suggested, these would've been bursting from the seem. I cut back on cheese and pepperoni and managed to get them folded, but not diagonally.

Great quick and simple recipe. Substituted crescent roll with crescent reduced fat dinner roll, turkey pepperoni and low fat mozzarella if you're looking at lower calorie. Just as tasty.

The Crescent rolls used this way seemed much more successful than the other two we tried (mummy dogs and chocolate-filled crescents).  My son absolutely loved making and eating these!  What a fun activity to do for a kids party, they get to make and bake their own!

These were way too sweet.  They might be better if the crust was made out of biscuits.  My sweets loving son even thought they were to sweet.  I  might play with this recipe some day, and see if I can tweak it so that my family would like it.

Followed recipe as written, but didn't care for the sweet taste of the crescent rolls for a pizza pocket.  Plus it needed more sauce IMO.  Glad I tried it, but probably won't make again.

When making these, I got a bit frustrated and thought they wouldn't turn out. I used Italian seasoned tomato paste instead of sauce (excellent idea), a little less pepperoni and added kalamata olives. I, like other reviewers,  just folded them in half rather than diagonally but that worked just fine and didn't affect the taste, so no problems there. But, I couldn't have used any less of the other ingredients without making it almost empty and it was completely stuffed - I couldn't ge the sides sealed all the way and thought I'd have a gooey mess. But, the ingredients didn't ooze out and it stayed in a nice pocket. Flavor - it was ok, and I'd give it 3 stars for that. However, hubby loved them and for ease of preparation I'll give it 4 stars.

I really like the idea but the dough is too soft to support the filling. Made as instructed there wasn't enough filling for me and too much bread. I filled the second one more but the dough is soft and doesn't support the ingredients well when you pick it up to eat. The dough browns well but doesn't crisp well. If you stay light as instructed on the filling these are good and easy enough for kids to make and have fun.

Yummy. I liked these. Quick pizza snack/dinner. I think next time though I would use the mini pepperoni's and mix them with the cheese and add some veggies. Olives, green peppers, mushrooms. There is a lot you could do with this. Kids loved them. Thanks for the recipe.

Tried these today for lunch and they were fabulous! I used chopped onions, green peppers and mushrooms as that is what I had. I folded them in squares, baked them on my pizza stone and they came out perfect. Don't forget the step to seal the 3 sides with a fork. Cut them diagonal after baking and served with warm pizza sauce on the side. Served with a light salad and it was scrumptious! Thanks for the recipe.

I'm one of the current brand ambassadors and this is one of the Pillsbury recipes I chose to make. I really was really wanting to give this a 5 star rating but found that it was almost impossible to work w/ the dough -even after it was chilled.  I tried to lay one triangle down, place the topping on it, and the lay the other triangle on top of it but still had issues w/ it - it didn't want to seal properly. After attempting two of the triangles, I finally took the last four and made a jumbo rectangle pizza pocket.  Taste wise it's a simple 5 and if you want to bump it up, brush the dough w/ a little bit of olive oil, and sprinkle it w/ some parmesan cheese, granulated garlic and italian seasoning.

Kids and hubby loved this "experiment". I am a bit more biased b/c I just don't care for the flavor of crescent rolls but they ate the whole pan without me with rave compliments.

I found these to be very messy and hard to fold without losing everything inside. When I bit into my mini-pockets they were hollow. Not sure how to do these better, but the sauce and everything was soaked into the bread. I was disappointed, but would like to figure out a better way.

Quick and easy, can be made for a snack or pair it with a salad for lunch.  I'm vegetarian so I left out the pepperoni and used green peppers and mushrooms instead.  Other than that I followed the recipe and was very pleased with the results.  Pillsbury Crescent "recipe creations" worked really well for this recipe; didn't have to worry about closing up those perforations.  thanks for the recipe!

I gave this 5 stars because the taste was very good.  However I had a hard time making the Crescents into squares.  I think next time I will just roll all the dough out and then cut them into squares.....; I used fresh pepperoni's slices and  mozzarella fresh from the deli and also used roasted peppers and broccoli.  Tasted wonderfully!

I loved the idea i thought it was pretty good but the dough is too soft for it. it kinda makes it mushy. I bought pizza crust dough ( find it in the grocery store right by the crescent rolls) so gonna try it again with different dough

I omitted the pepperoni because I'm not a fan. They were fairly easy and not too bad tasting. I liked the soft "crust"- it was a nice change from hard crusts of normal pizzas. My child (super super picky eater) ate these very well, so I will make them again.

This worked great when I needed something for just me and my 5 yr old. He made them and I just put them in the oven. Ready in no time. He was so excited that he "cooked supper" and he saved one for the rest of the family to try when they got home.

These are perfect for kids. There is nothing gourmet about them. But, if you are going to feed your kids frozen pizza pockets, this is a much cheaper and tastier version. You can even freeze them yourself and use later. We made pepperoni and olive, canadian bacon and pineapple, and pesto with cheese. I made them with refrigerated pizza dough. One tube of dough made four large pizza pockets. My young kids only ate half of one pocket each.

Very tasty treats for an at home movie night, etc. My kids loved them! Like other reviewers, I did have a hard time with them staying sealed. Next time, I'll really pinch the perforations together better. I added a little Italian seasoning for a little extra flavor. They were really yummy!

Super easy and way more delicious than frozen pizza and pizza pockets! I changed a few things just to make it more my family taste; for one, I couldn't figure out how to make them into triangles  so I just folded the rectangles over into squares. I sealed off the edges and poked holes in the tops with a fork and didn't have any issues with the insides leaking out. Topped them with a brush of olive oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Then baked convection at 360 for 12 mins and they were perfectly done! Yes the crescent bread does have a flaky/buttery/almost sweet taste to it so the aftertaste is different but still WORLDS better than frozen! Combined the leftover tomato sauce with some chunky leftover pasta sauce I had and heated it up

I greased my cookie sheet before baking these. I made eight rolls where I laid out halve a slice of cheese, topping  with 4 pepperoni on the long end. On the V area I placed a small slither of cheese and two more pepperoni, rolled it up and placed it on the sheet..  Basted olive oil mixed with rosemary, oregano, basil and garlic.  Loved how the bottom came out crunchy alone with any cheese melting on the pan. Served it with a salad.    HUBBY loved this and it will probably become a favorite meal for us.

I've been making these for years. Pick your favorite toppings and let your creative juices flow. The crescent rolls work well as a pocket or flat as a more traditional style crust.

Kids liked them but these were a pain to make. The crescent roll dough doesn't stick to itself.  I even took two triangles smooshed them together and rolled it out & it still fell apart where the seams were. In the end I ended up using half the stuffing and just rolling them into crescents with the stuffing in; they turned out great!

I made this exactly as recipe said. Thought it was ok. Next time I will add olive oil to make it crunchy n add Italian seasoning to give more of a pizza flavor. Maybe oregano, but that's in the air. Good idea for crescent rolls though. I will branch of of this idea. Kids enjoyed it.

This recipe is simple and perfect. I used spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce and I substituted the mozzarella cheese for a 4-cheese blend. The mozzarella made it seem like the dough wasn't fully cooked. Overall I love this and so do my kids.

I could tell this wouldn't work as soon as I tried to get the perforation to close up. It kept separating again, so I just flipped it over knowing it would make a huge mess and a big disappointment for dinner. Maybe, if I ever try this again, I'll just use the pillsbury pizza dough instead. I was really looking forward to this and I've ended up just disappointed.

While this was a neat idea and simple enough to make, I found the taste and texture of the crescent rolls to not work with the pizza flavors. The flavor of the crescent rolls reminded me of Ritz crackers, especially along the edges. Really salty and buttery. If I made this again I'd try the pizza dough that Pillsbury makes instead of the crescent rolls.

I made these as a quick lunch on a rainy day off from work. They were quick and easy to make and cooked up perfectly. I love crescent rolls but I have to agree with some others that I think that the crescents are slightly too sweet. I'll probably try this again using biscuits or pizza dough instead of the crescents.

tasted good, and reasonably quick to make.  Not as pretty as the picture.

Perfect for a quick, easy lunch or dinner. We did fold them into squares instead of diagonally, and doubled the recipe since we didn't make any sides. We also did four with buttered crescent rolls and four with regular crescent rolls. Both were equally delicious.

We gave it a 3 because crescent rolls were way too sweet tasting for pizza - we much rather prefer pie crust or even biscuits flattened and folded over the toppings for mini calzones.

These are decent and kid friendly if you can get the crescent rolls to work for you.

These are fantastic!  They taste like pizza hot pockets, but much better.

These were easy and tasty. A couple of people had suggested the italian seasoning, garlic powder, and parmesan cheese, and I took their advice. It was wonderful! I also substituted the pepperoni with cut up, cooked chicken breast. I cooked the chicken breast in a nonstick pan, and added the garlic and italian there as well. I cooked them for 13 mins instead of 15 as well. I will make these again for sure.

These were fantastic!  I bought the extra large crescent rolls that they have out now.  Turned out great!  I think these would be great with some pie filling as well ;)
