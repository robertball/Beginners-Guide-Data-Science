Hi, everyone!  Gosh, I haven't checked these reviews for years.  I'm so glad to see there are so many people loving this recipe.  HEY... be sure to enter this chili in contests at work... it WINS all the time :-)  Last Friday I just won 1st place for "Hot"' category, and overall grand champion for receiving the most points from the judges.
Now... I have a couple of BIG secrets to share with you about this recipe, that might make it EVEN BETTER.  When I entered it online in 2000, the use of brand names weren't allowed, so I'll try to enter them here so you know.  The salsa is actually PACE PICANTE SAUCE... Med. or Hot.  The chili seasoning I use is Williams Original (not available in all areas), I use one package per 2 lbs of ground beef... sometimes I throw in a little extra from another package.

Enjoy! Best regards, Deb.

I wish I could give more than 5 stars to this recipe!

The chili I've been making for years is my mom's recipe, and it's really more like a thick spaghetti sauce than a chunky chili. I needed a new recipe for a chili sale at my work, and it needed to taste great.

Deb's recipe did not disappoint. I used Pace salsa (I think it's called Chipolte???) with jalapenos for a little extra kick and added a can of Rotel tomatoes and green chilis.

Everyone who tried it raved over the great flavor, and a lot of folks asked for the recipe. It had a little bit of a spicy aftertaste, but was mild enough to appeal to all but the pickiest eaters. My husband even asked me to make a batch for him to take to work Superbowl Sunday. I will never go searching for another chili recipe again! Thanks Deb!!!!!

HELPFUL TIPS: I halved the recipe because it's just for my husband and 2 toddlers (although one eats like a monster!), and we still had leftovers :)  Put the normal amount of onion and black pepper.  One 10oz. of diced tomatoes w/green chiles and one 14oz of tomato sauce because it needed it.  HALF a jar of chunky salsa (although I will do a taste test an hour in to see if I need more), half a jar of each DRAINED kidney bean, and half a can of ranch style chili beans (pinto beans).  They are the best beans on earth.  Added one can of drained mushrooms and 3/4 a can of drained corn.  After I browned 1 lb of meat, I put it in the crock pot for at least 2.5hrs.  Grrrreat!  We have it at least once every few months for the past several years!  Update: I now add things like diced green, yellow and red peppers which really adds to the taste (and gives it color).  Season with a few dashes of garlic, oregano, paprika, basil, sugar, and we're talking a real winner!  Our family eats it with rice the first night (fri), sat is "let's be lazy day," so we eat it over hot dogs, and sun ...can you say football and fritos and chili over cheese!!  We're not obsessed w/this recipe ...really ;)

Wow Deb and thanks for the easiest dang chili recipe I ever made - and with all the ingredients already in the house!  I used 1 lb. ground chuck and 1 lb. ground turkey and added 1 can of pinto beans to the mix. Made a mistake and used the whole pack of the chili seasoning mix, but it came out tasting great.  I recommend using either fresh garlic or garlic powder because the taste to me is the best.  The nicest thing was that you could spice the recipe up or down depending on the type of salsa you used.  I just browned the meat and onions, and threw everything into the crockpot and forgot about it for 8 hours on low.
Came home to yummy smells from the kitchen. Next time I will add green and read bell pepper.

Chili cheese fries?  You all are killing me!  LOL
--------------------------------------------------------
I originally wrote this review over 7 years ago, and It is still my go to chili recipe because it is so adaptable.  Chili season is approaching and I can't wait to make it again.  I wish I could give this 10 stars as it is that good........  BTW, I did have to indulge in those chili cheese fries and they were heavenly - as were the chili dogs and chiliburgers, and mexican omletes.  LOL
Debzdoo, you are my chili queen!

I made this chili at a recent Chili Cook-off at my church and it won! I was surprised, but then knew I had to write a review and share the news. I made this chili exactly as recipe described. I still have people telling me, weeks later, "I loved your chili!"

This chili is wonderful! I was looking for a recipe for chili that would be as good as Wendy's chili, this chili doesn't taste exactly the same, but it is just as good. It is very easy to make, takes very little time to prepare, and it's so super delicious! I did tweak the recipe a bit, I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and I used more than the recipe called for. I also increased the meat a little and threw in a can of pinto beans in addition to the light and dark kidney beans, and I added a little cayenne pepper to spice it up a little more.

Great recipe and easy. I have also added a little brown sugar and a bottle of beer. I also like spice, so added a dash of cayenne. Then let it simmer for an hour or so.

We love this recipe.  We make this all the time and we even made a big pot of it for our Super Bowl party.  We always use a couple cloves of garlic instead of garlic salt because we don't have any at home.  We use between 2-3 tsps of the chili seasoning and serve it with an assortment of toppings: dollop of sour cream, shredded cheese, green onions.  Thank you so much for an easy chili recipe.

Have made this recipe a couple of times and thought it not only easy but very tasty. And, as with any chili recipe, it lends itself to experimentation - or just adjusting to what you know your family will like.  What I really have a hard time with is when someone rates a recipe without EVER having tried it - and giving it only one star to boot.  If you look at a recipe and know that it has features that you don't like - then go on to the next one.  It is completely unfair to give a really poor rating to something that you KNOW you aren't going to like and even more importantly have not even tried.  That's mean spirited.

I absolutely love this recipe. You can easily control the spiciness by simply using mild, medium or hot salsa. I made it on a cold snowy night and my family loved it. The leftovers are even better. I didn't change a thing as I believe in trying a recipe first as the writer intended in order to leave an honest review. Thanks for this recipe.

Good Gracious! I don't know if I have ever tasted a chili so good! I have skipped over this recipe many times because it just sounded too simple, and I am not that crazy about salsa. NOW, I am crazy about salsa in chili! It seems to be the award winning ingredient. I thought I had found my favorite chili in another recipe on this site, but this one is the best to me. Thanks Deb! This was a doozy!

My husband who loves chili, really loved this and was amazed that it was so easy to make. You can really alter this as much as you like. I used tomato sauce made for chili, 16 oz mild salsa, Chili-o seasoning (the whole packet), and Busch's chili beans (1 large in mild and 1 med in medium sauce). I also, added Borden's shredded cheese with taco seasoning. I omitted the garlic salt and used fresh garlic and a whole onion. My hubby said he would like some corn in it next time. It was a hit.  As a note I'd like to add that for such a quick and easy recipe, it shouldn't harshly be compared to more extensive recipes. It's a great quick and tasty recipe worthy of 5 stars.

Very good and very easy. I did as another reviewer suggested and substituted a 15 oz. can of tomatoes and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce for the 2 1/2 cups of tomato sauce. My chili packets contained 2 tsps. each, so I definitely thought it needed the two packets. I only used 1/2 tsp. pepper and it was plenty spicy! Great recipe!

I stuck to the recipe and to the suggestions made by the recipe's author in her review (she says use Pace's Picante sauce for the salsa).  I served this to 3 families.  It was a big hit with the kids and adults alike.  The husband who was there without his wife said he wished his wife's chili was as good as mine!

This is delicious!  I cut the chili powder in half simply becasue I don't want it to have too much kick for my little ones.  I make it with ground turkey and I add a can of whole cranberries in jelly (trust me no one will have any idea cranberries are in there and it gives a very faint sweetness).  My family loves this chili- thanks Debdoozie!

Must use Williams Original Chili Seasoning.
Excellent!  Also used Medium Pace Picante and doubled the whole thing.  I REALLY liked this chili and I have been making chili for years---many with lots more ingredients and more work and I honestly like this one much better.  I did add about a cup of diced poblanos for some nice color as well.  So so good!

So easy!  I followed it exactly but then added 1/2 cup more tomato sauce.  Also, my secret ingredient...nutmeg 1/2 tsp.  Adds distinct flavor.  Loved this recipe.

I used lean ground beef and it was still very good. I use less chili mix than it calls for because its too salty. I substituted with a little bit of chili powder and cumin. I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt to cut down on the salt. Also good in the crock pot, just brown the meat first.

This was a good and easy way to fix chili.  I wasn't standing over the stove all day and it was very inexpensive to make.  I thought the taste was just ok.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't fall in love with it either.  There are so many other chili recipes on this site and I'm gonna keep looking till I find that special one.  For those of you who like to keep it simple and still have an enjoyable meal...try this one.  Thanks Deb.

Disappointed. It was easy to make but it tasted like canned chili. I made it exactly as the directions said to. I normally make the Flatlander Chili on this site which is excellent but I got lazy and thought I would try an easier recipe. The Flatlander Chili is worth the extra work.

This recipe was extremely tasty!  The addition of the salsa was an interesting and successful ingredient.

I only gave 4 stars because I made some changes. Instead of a packet of taco seasoning I used "Taco seasoning I" found on this website and added it as soon as the meat was cooked. While the meat was defrosting I started the onions in a separate pan and caramelized them (adds a kick of sweet to the chili) and added them in once the meat was browner a seasoned. I also half everything (as much as possible) in the recipe. It's a GREAT base recipe and allows for a lot of personal modifications. Oh and since I halved it I just used one can of light red beans and not both kinds

During a particularly cold spell, I decided I wanted chili; however, I didn't want to use my standard recipe that has a LONG list of ingredients. I looked on Allrecipes and found this simple recipe. Boy, am I glad I gave it a try!!  It was yummy!  I used an entire packet of McCormick's chili seasoning mix and also added about 1C chopped green pepper to it (personal preference).  Then topped it with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  My son and I gobbled it up!  Thanks for such an easy, and OUTSTANDING, chili recipe!  My new favorite, for sure!

If I could give it more stars I would.  This is the easiest chili I have ever made and it is wonderful each time I make it.  The only change which I have done is used a 32 oz can of diced tomatoes rather than the tomato sauce. I personally like the texture of the chunky tomatoes.

put three cups of this chili on top of half of a batch of  prepared cornbread batter (I use Jiffy), add 1 and half cups of shredded cheese, then pour on the rest of the batter and cook according to cornbread cooking directions, add 1/2 cup of the cheese as soon as you take it out of the oven and let it melt. My family loves this, we call it Cowboy Cornbread! Very yummy and filling!

This was a VERY excellent recipe for chili. My husband and I both raved about it for days.  We followed the recipe exactly with the exception on ground chili meat instead of ground beef. I don't think you can find a better recipe.

This chili is a pretty good, simple chili.  I like that it can be thrown together pretty quickly, and that it is versatile.  Sometimes I will put in a can or two of stewed tomatoes instead of salsa, or I will use black beans or whatever kind I have on hand.  We like to use this recipe to make "frito burritos".  We will make the chili as directed and then put it in a flour tortilla with some cheese and fritos. 

Not the best chili I ever had, but definitely decent for the amount of time it takes to prepare.

I was skeptical how a chili recipe this easy could be so good, but it certainly is! 
I have other recipes that result in a good chili, but this one is just as good if not better, and SO much quicker & easier! I made mine using the "hot" Pace picante sauce, and used fresh garlic. I let mine simmer in the slow cooker all day and what a treat it was! 
Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, after reading Deb's helpful tips in her review, and it was amazingly fabulous chili.....thanks for sharing Deb! This will definitely be my "go-to recipe" for chili from now on!

I love this chili!  Quick and terrific.  The only thing that I did different, was to add a few more ounces of salsa.  I used a canned salsa which was 7 oz, so I used about 1 1/2 cans, so about 10 oz total.  Hubby loved it!

Well...this was the first time that I had made meat chili. Hard to believe, but true. My family really enjoyed this recipe. It got rave reviews for sure. My fussy daughter, who never likes anything btw, just jobbled down 2 bowls! Instead of adding the 2.5 c tomato sauce, I subbed 15 oz diced tomatoes and 15 oz. tom. sauce. I also used a full onion with the meat. But basically, just followed the recipe. Very easy and very tasty. I just sat and waited while it simmered for an hour. And garnished with some shredded mild cheddar. Yummmy!

I tried this chili out of curiosity because the reviews were so great. However, I usually "throw my chili together" close to the same way each time I make it, and it's very good....my family, my husband and in-laws LOVE my chili.  Also, I made a few small changes to this recipe: I used lean ground turkey in place of ground beef; I knew I'd be adding 1 more can of beans so used a full 16 oz jar of Newmans' Own Salsa instead of an 8 oz jar; 1 large onion instead of 1/2 of an onion; 1/2 tsp garlic powder in place of garlic salt; added 1/4 tsp salt; 1 can each black, pinto, and white beans instead of 2 cans kidney beans.  I also added 1/2 tsp liquid smoke. As I said, it was pretty good, and a nice change of pace. However I will probably return to my old standard. If I get enough interest, I'll post my recipe.

This is a nice basic quick chili that is good on it's own or bends well to your own personalizations. I like to use beef stew meat, a whole onion, fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, and homemade chili seasoning. This is especially good poured over hot dogs (for chili dogs) or to make nachos, queso dip or chili fries. Freezes well.

I have finally found a chili recipe that is a keeper.  This recipe is super easy to make and not too thick or too thin.  I'm a true Texan so I like pinto beans instead of kidney beans.  Very good either way!

This is a great recipe.  Goes great over left over pasta for lunch!  However, mine was a little runny-  I added an extra can of beans both times I made it (about half way through), which made it nice and thick.

I've only made chili a couple of times.  We had a horseshoe tournament at our house yesterday with about 70 people.  I made the chili on Saturday in a crock pot and let it cook for almost 14 hours.  I reheated in the crock pot yesterday.  Full, 6 quart crock pot.  I followed the recipe to the T, only draining and rinsing my beans.  I even used Pace Picante sauce recommended.  I think the crock pot was literally licked clean.  Thanks for such a great recipe that I will use again and again!

Made exactly as recipe stated using the suggestions of the submitter which was to use Pace Picante for the salsa and a pack of chili seasoning per 2 lbs. of meat. My guys absolutely loved it. They request it once a week, and said not to change a thing. Just the right amount of heat. I might have to start tripling the recipe because the double batch is not lasting!! Thanks so much for a 5 star recipe.

Yummy!!  I made this with medium pace salsa and I only used 1 tsp. of chili seasoning and it was HOT.  The kids ate it but said it was too hot. It was Really esay...I was in a hurry so I only simmered it for 20 minutes, and it still turned out great.

This was great as written.  I decided to add some chopped green bell pepper and a small can of tomatoes and chilis....which added a nice kick to it.  I ended up using a whole envelope of chili seasoning.  This will be my new chili recipe.

I'm sorry, but I do not see how this recipe has gotten five stars from so many people. I made this for the superbowl yesterday and I made it exactly as recipe said and the result was not very good. It wasn't gross, and you could definitely eat it, but it was nothing great and nothing to talk about. I ended up adding some stuff at the end after I saw that the end result was not great...I added a 28 ounce jar of crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, chili powder and cayanne pepper...after doing this it was a little better, but definitely still nothing to rave over. will not be making this recipe again.

I saw this recipe this morning and thought sounds great! With all the great reviews I tried it. Followed it exactly.  My kids and I thought it was awesome. Some tried it in a bowl and used tortilla chips to scoop and eat it ...that was really good, and my daughter used it to make a chili dog! She loved it. Family vote says this is the new favorite. My mom made something similar but added about a cup or so of cooked elbow macaroni. Maybe something to try in the future, but it was great as is.

This is a great recipe. I have fixed it twice, and it has been delicious both times. Of course we all alter recipes to soot our own tastes, but the only thing that I did differently was after browning the meat and onions, I put everything in the crockpot, added a can of diced mushrooms and a little ketchup and then cooked on high for two hours. Thanks for a fantastic recipe that I plan on using for years!

I love the ease and simpleness of this recipe! It's just good chili that is quick to make. If you want leftovers, then be sure to double this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as it is the first time I made it, and it was excellent. Other times that I've made it and doubled the recipe, I add about 2 teaspoons of white sugar as well as a green pepper, which I cook with the meat and onions.  I drain the fat out of the meat and I don't strain the beans. I used the Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe from this site, and the chili was awesome! I will say that the first time I made this, it was pretty spicy for me, but that might have something to do with the chili seasoning, and not really this recipe. When I eat other chili that friends or relatives make, I always wish that I was eating this chili instead (but of course I'll never tell them that)!

I have always loved chili but never had a great recipe. This one is it!!! I love that it made a big batch so we have lots of leftovers. My husband and I will be fighting over who gets to take it for lunches.

I made this last night for the Superbowl, and it was the most amazing bowl of chili I have ever had in my life! I made a half batch of this with 1lb of beef (it was all I had in the freezer) and used the Chili seasoning mix II from this site (amazing!). I used 1 can of vegetarian baked beans instead of kidney beans, because I like the texture of them better, and added about 1/2 a bottle of dark-ish beer. This chili has a great kick to it, I didn't even have to add Cayenne. Once it was cooked just topped it with a little extra sharp cheddar and I was in game-day heaven. Thank you sooo much for posting, this is definately going to be a weekly dish for me and hubby!

Really great recipe!  I had never made chili before, but I decided to enter my hometown's chili cookoff with this recipe.  I doubled the recipe, added an extra can of tomato sauce, and threw in some chili garlic sauce, a tablespoon or so of Bullfighter steak sauce, and substituted one can of the light red kidney beans with black beans.  Also, when I sauteed the ground beef and onion I sauteed them with about 5 cloves of fresh pressed garlic instead of using the garlic salt.  VERY EASY TO MAKE!  And, the best part is that I won second place in the cookoff - pretty good for never having made chili before!

So Easy!  Sadly, I was very lazy when I made this in my crock pot.  Browned the ground beef, added it to jar spaghetti sauce, jar salsa, can of chili beans with the liquid and can of kidney beans.  Mixed in sour cream to individual bowl.  It's a keeper.

We love this recipe!  I don't usually like my chili so thick, but this was great.  I think this will be my go to chili recipe from now on.  I even made it for my brother-in-law from Texas.  I was worried he wouldn't like it because it wasn't to his liking, but he ate more of it than anyone else.  He even ate what was leftover the next day for breakfast.  The only thing I changed was that I decreased the chili spices so that it was very mild and suitable for all family members.

I joined this site just to review this chili.  Wow.  This is incredibly easy and tastes wonderful.  I used the Williams chili seasoning package (the whole pack) and Pace Mild Picante.  I love this recipe!

EASY! DELICIOUS! I used turkey instead of ground beef, substituted 4 cloves fresh minced garlic for garlic salt, and I also used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can rotel's tomatos and jalepenos in lieu of the tomato sauce..perfect!

I have been searching for a while to find a good chili recipe and I found a keeper. I used McKormick's chili seasoning, 8oz of pace medium picante sauce, 2 1/2 cups of tomato sauce in addition to a can of diced tomatoes and green chili. I added a little bit of minced garlic and omitted the salt.

This chili was very straightforward and easy to make. A lot of the reviewers compared it to Wendy's chili which I don't think is inaccurate. It IS good and easy, but I didn't really think it had a wow factor to it. I am however glad I made it for my co-workers, and I would use it again if trying to make something fast for a crowd and did not want to risk one of my "concoctions" of many peppers and veggies for.

original recipe is great...second time I made the following changes....replaced tom. sauce with 2 large cans crushed tomatoes and added 2 entire pkgs chili seasoning mix.  Chili is so forgiving and personal...I think the key to this recipe is the salsa.  I love it, this is my new go to recipe.

Great chili recipe though a little too spicy for young children.  Also, this says eight servings, but I could get at least 12 out of the pot.  I'll scale it to serve 4 next time or plan to freeze half.

This makes a delicious pot of chili & is a lot simpler, less expensive than my other "favorite" chili recipe on this site.  I followed advice from other reviews & tweeked to personal taste.  Used tomatoes w/ chili peppers instead of sauce; subbed chili beans for dark red kidney beans & added bell pepper.  Left it in the crock pot all day and came home to a wonderful aroma of dinner!  Thanks for sharing!

I have to give this recipe kudos for being quick and easy.  I decided at the last minute that I wanted to make chili and was able to throw this together quickly without a trip to the grocery.  I am sure that the chili seasoning makes a huge difference in flavor and perhaps what I had in my pantry was not a good choice.  I used fresh garlic because everything is better with fresh garlic and one can kidney and one can chili beans because that is what I had on hand.   I was surprised that a chili with so few ingredients could win awards and garner so many five star reviews but was hopeful.  Even after an overnight in the fridge, however, this chili was just okay for us.

Best chili EVER. My husband usually tolerates my chili, but with this recipe he was asking for seconds and eating leftovers the next day. It's delicious.

Best chili ever!
I made my own salsa because i didn't have any store bought salsa in my pantry. I also made my own chili mix from this website. It takes a little bit longer but it was well worth it.
Tomato salsa recipe- 1 canned  tomatos diced, 1/2 onion diced, 1/3c green bell pepper diced, 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced, 2 cloves garlic minced, 1/4 fresh cilantro chopped, salt to taste. Mix all ingredients in a bowl.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.

I've been looking for an easier chili recipe (mine takes forever) and this did the trick. I would have never thought to use salsa, but this saves so much time. And....this is some very tasty chili. My family loved it.

This is such a quick recipe to make that generally can be made without making a trip to the grocery store.  This recipe has such a very well balanced delicious taste, EVEN when it is only cooked for an hour or less!

I've tried several other chili recipes and this one is the favorite of my family. It isn't a thin or runny chili but it is thick and hearty. The flavor isn't to heavy on the tomato side or the meat side; it's just incredible!

We like to double the recipe and eat it for a few meals or freeze some for later. 

We love the recipe as is, but we also have added frozen corn, a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, and lil' smokies. Using the Pace Southwest Chipotle Restaurant Style Salsa was delicious. Cover the top with shredded cheese and a big dollop of sour cream... my mouth is starting to water just thinking about it!
-- If for your taste it has to much tomato taste, try adding the diced tomatoes with green chilies; this is a quick way to add spices and more of that chili flavor to balance the taste. Also, the salsa can make or break this recipe! Using the PACE SOUTHWEST CHIPOTLE RESTAURANT STYLE SALSA adds a depth of flavor that doesn't have a strong tomato flavor. Chances are, if you don't love this recipe as it is, you need to use these specific ingredients I've spoken about to keep the correct flavor balance. -- GOOD EATING

Debdoozie - this is my new favorite chili!  I was known as the Chili Queen in my family, but your recipe is better than mine.  This is great just as  written.  The first time I used Carroll Shelby's Chili seasoning - I think I prefer that to the one Debdoozie recommends.  The first time I used Pace Picante Hot - my daughter & I liked the spiciness but my husband & son preferred a milder taste so I now use Medium.  I have changed the recipe by using real garlic and adding a can of mild green chilies.  But as I said before, the recipe as written deserves 5 stars.  The negative reviewers sound like they haven't even tried it.

Great chili recipe! So simple to make for a weeknight dinner since there isn't much prep work. Followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect! A little on the  spicy side, just to warn people that are sensitive to a lot of spice, but it tastes great. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Deb, my whole family loved it!

Awesome chili! Used this recipe for the school chili cookoff, and won! Expanded the recipe to 12 servings, and made it exactly as listed, but added the extra picante that was left in the jar, so I didn't have leftover. Wonderful recipe, and is now my favorite.

AWESOME as written!  My chili was never consistent because I neve did have a 'recipe'.  Now this will be the ONLY way I'll fix chili.  That said, my husband prefers more tomatoes so I simply split the chili and toss a can of crushed tomatoes into his.  Thanks for a keeper!

This chili is AWESOME! I am not a chili person and I loved it. I added a little more tomato sauce because it seemed dry. I did not change anything else. Delicious. I will never make a more complicated chili recipe again!

Great basic recipe!  I used McCormick seasoning, I don't like a lot of beans in my chili so I did 5lbs and meat and 3 cans of beans.  I also added a can of zesty sauce by hunts and rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies.

This recipe lives up to the hype.  Like most Allrecipe chefs, I made a few changes that I had to make based on principle.  I used 5 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic salt.  I seasoned the ground beef with a great deal more pepper than the recipe calls for (nearly 2 teaspoons).  And I added about two teaspoons of chili powder in addition to the package of McCormick's Chili packet.  I used two jars of Pace HOT Salsa instead of one (for a total of 16 ounces).  And I added one 14 ounce can of diced tomatos.  Even with the added moisture, it is still maintained its hardy consistency.  As for the onion, I did not cook it with the ground beef but served it diced raw on top of each serving.  This makes a great deal of chili.  With my changes, it is definately a 5 alarm chili (for children and for those with delicate palates, use the mild version of the salsa and skip the extra chili powder).  Thank you, Deb.  This is now my go to recipe when the urge strikes.  For those that are wondering what makes this such a good chili, it's the salsa.   For whatever reason, it works very well in this application.

Great recipe. I made this chili 1½ times itself in a 6 quart dutch oven. For the third can of beans, I used a can of mild chili beans from the pantry. It turned out great.

Good chili recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of beef to lighten the fat content.  It is very tasty.

Best Chili ever! And I really love how easy it is!  I am a bit of a chili snob, and this was great!  I changed it up a little, added a few jalapenos and extra salsa (just to use up the jar), also used one can of black beans.  Then ate it with cheese on top and Fritos Corn Chips!  Heaven!  My whole family loved it! I cannot wait for a chili contest to come around!

I typically use a pretty complicated Williams Sonoma recipe for chili, with a long list of ingredients.  But one cold night I wanted a simple recipe.  I don't know if I'll make the complicated one again, this was so good!  Well, yeah I will, but not as often.  =)  The first time I used medium Pace sauce, because the kids weren't home, and it was perfect for us.  Today I'm making it with mild, since the kids will be home and I think it will be fine for them.

I made this during all the snow last week.  My picky son and husband both liked it.  It was very good and very easy to make.  The leftovers were great for taco salad and nachos.  I followed the recipe to a T except swapping 1 can of the kidney beans for a can of pinto beans.

Very Very Good.  Only four stars b/c still missing just a little of something just not sure what.  Followed recipe for the most part.  Could not find chili mix listed by deb so used chili seasoning recipe from this site.  Wonderful.... So far this is the best chili recipe I've found.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks

WOW! I wish that I had seen this recipe years ago, as it's so much easier (and tastier) than others! I used a jar of lower sodium organic salsa, chilli powder, fresh mushrooms, a can of low sodium mixed beans, and a can of diced tomatoes. Yummy and most importantly EASY (especially for those of us with kids!!)

This is my new chili recipe! It did seem dry, so I added a half bottle of Corona and I seasoned it with chipolte seasoning. Topped with cheese and sour cream, it was great!

What a fantastic chili recipe. I was reluctant at first because of the simplicity of the ingredients but what a flavorful and easy recipe. I usually make the boilermaker tailgate chili on this site but wanted something a little quicker this time. I added an extra can of diced tomatoes after cooking awhile because it was a little thick. I also added two roasted green chilis. Will make often!!

This is our go-to recipe for chili now.  YUM!  Everyone that tries it loves it, and my family raves about it.  The salsa is an excellent touch.  I make the homemade chili seasoning from the site also, and it is absolutely delish.  Whip it up with some buttermilk cornbread and it's a dinner everyone will love!  We serve with sour cream and cheese.

One of the first recipes I saved on this site and one of my favorites, I've used it for at least 8 years and I've never changed a thing, there simply is no reason for it. People always want the recipe! Thanks Deb for such a great recipe!

Thanks for this recipe! Super easy since I had almost all the ingredients on hand and absolutely delicious!  I added more tomatoes than called for and added some cayenne pepper and paprika since I like it hot, but overall this is a great recipe that I will definitely use again, my boyfriend even asked me to make more before he even finished the first batch!

I also used one whole recipe of Chili Mix II (minus the salt) like others had suggested in place of the chili seasoning.  I used a fresh, refrigerated salsa, drained.  And, I use a little more tomato sauce if I've got a several hours to let it cook down.  Wow!  Best chili ever.  Quick to make.  Enjoyed by all!  Thanks very much!

My new favorite Chili recipe.  I only added 1 can tomato sauce and instead of kidney beans, 1 can Brooks Hot Chili beans;  I also lessened the chili seasoning mix to 2 TB due to the seasoning in the beans.  I put it all in a crockpot for 6 hours. I had never used the crock pot for Chili before, but after tasting this, I'll try to always put in the the crockpot.    Thanks for the easy, super yummy recipe!

Made this and it was really good, sometimes simple is better and that's exactly what this is. I used 5 TBSP of chili powder, 1 tsp. onion powder instead of onions, about 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and a few dashes of hot sauce to give it a little kick and I used about 3lbs. of groud beef cause my husband doesn't like it "soupy" and it turned out GREAT, definately a KEEPER!

This was a very good recipe for me to start from. I made a few changes based on what I had available: ground turkey, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, one with green chilies, instead of the salsa.  It turned out really well. Next time I will try it with the salsa. I also added a taco bell packet of hot sauce and a bit of ketchup for sweetness.

I didn't have kidney beans in my pantry so I used Pinto Beans and a can of Chickpeas. I also added a can of Rotel for spicyness. WONDERFUL! Will make this again throughout the Winter & Fall.

Amazing!!! It needed a little more heat, so I added a chopped chili pepper when browning the onions (almost forgot I added a few cloves of garlic).  Overall and amazing recipe; Thanks Deb.

This was so good! and ridiculously easy!! I only had one minor change. I used chili power instead of chili seasoning mix. I went to the corner store and they were out of the mix so...just went with what I had. Fabulous results!!

I was very surprised that this was so good, with so few ingredients.  I will admit, this is not a knock your socks off stand out chili, but it is really good for the little amount of work that goes into it.  I used a whole 28oz can of tomato sauce, the whole 24oz bottle of Pace Picante sauce, and an entire packet of McCormicks original chili seasoning.  Usually, making chili takes a lot of time and ingredients for me.  This will become a go to recipe for a basic chili that doesn't take much work and tastes great.  Oh, I also added an extra can of beans, just because a) we like beans and b) we wanted to stretch this meal a little with meat getting so expensive.

I have made this recipe a few times in the last few months and everyone loves it. The best part is its easily customized to different levels of heat. My family doesn't like it too hot, but my co workers love a little more heat. By just changing the salsa from mild to hot i can get that result without changing the overall taste. I've already had to give this recipe out multiple times.

Just made this chili last night and was overall great. I modified the recipe slightly using 3 cups of tomato sauce, 1 can of kidney beans, 1 can of chili beans, 1 can of black beans and used the vegetarian "ground smart" in place of the meat. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon. I think the only change I would make for next time is more salsa. I might double the amount. Overall, a great recipe!

Was surprisingly amazed that husband actually liked it.  I did alter the recipe a tad bit.  I used the entire 16oz jar of Pace Picante salsa & the entire packet of McCormick's Chili seasoning mix.  This is a simple & great chili recipe.  It's a keeper.  Thank you for sharing..

This chili is very good. I modified it as some suggested by adding a can of Rotel with green chilies, more seasonings (i.e., garlic powder, seasoned salt, basil, paprika, oregano), and a can of Bush’s chili beans in mild sauce instead of the dark kidney beans, and a little sugar. My 5-year old daughter did not like it maybe because I served it with rice, but in any event, the next time, I will probably use a little bit more spice 'kick' (perhaps use hot Pace picanta salsa instead of the mild sauce). I also made cornbread to eat with this. This recipe yields a lot! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the submission and modification ideas!

Very yummy! We made this chili and put it over Fritos with cheese. Soooo good and SUPER easy. I didn't let it simmer for an hour like the recipe says, but it still tasted like like I had cooked it all day. My husband isn't a fan of any of the chilis I've ever made, but he said this one had great flavor. My four year old loved it, also! I call that a hit!!

Hooooooweeee! (That's Texas for "HOLY ").  This recipe is amazing, and deserves all the awards it's won. I followed Deb's advice in the first comment and used Pace Picante Sauce (Hot) instead of regular salsa. The heat doesn't hit you at first, but just wait a few seconds and your mouth will be on fire.

For an extra kick, use Buffalo meat instead of hamburger, and maybe a can of pinto beans as well for a heartier chili.

This tastes like canned chili.  I prefer to use fresh peppers, and roasted stewed tomatoes to add flavor, color and texture.

This chili is the BOMB!!  I have got it in the slow cooker right now and can't keep my grubby little hands out of it.  It is so-o-o-o-o good.  The only thing that I added to it was 1/2 of a large green pepper as I love green pepper with my chili and I used a chopped onion, with a can of Ro-Tel's chopped tomatoes with chili peppers.  I used Chili Seasoning II for the spices.  This is definitely going to be a keeper.  I will never ever struggle to make chili again hoping it will turn out.  This is fantasic and a MUST TRY!!  Thank you so much Deb for sharing this recipe.

This is my favorite chili recipe of all time since I found it here 2 years ago! Only one I use now, with just a few alterations to it, such as added a can of diced chili ready tomatoes, used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground chicken or pork vs 2 lbs of ground beef and some extra spices. Thanks so much Deb for posting it!

This chili is so good, and so darn easy to make. I made the recipe exactly as written and it got raves. I have to comment on a couple of things that aren't specified or are optional. You need to drain the beans. Maybe that's a given, but it didn't specify, and being a new cook, I wasn't sure. Also, I would highly recommend draining the grease. I have made it both ways and it's much better when made with drained meat. But quite delicious regardless! 5 stars, period!

I have made this chili twice and both times my guests can not get enough of it! One great thing about this chili is that you can use mild, medium or hot salsa depending on what you and your guests prefer.This recipe will always be my families chili recipe!

This chili was awesome!!  I added 2 cans of Rotel diced tomatoes w/green chilies and an extra 1/4 cup of tomato sauce.  I also only used 3 tablespoons of chili seasoning and put in some cumin and chili powder like some other people had said.  It turned out GREAT!!  My husband ate two bowls full and this stuff is quite filling.  Thanks for a great chili recipe!

This was quite good and made a good amount - we used 1 package ground turkey and 1 lb ground beef which seemed to give it a nice texture (or was it the slow cooking?) I used McCormick's chili seasoning packet (nearly 1.5) and made chili mac with it.  After cooking it on the stove, I threw it into a lined slow cooker for 2 hours (I was afraid to scorch the chili in the pot on the stove) and it was awesome.  Added a little extra tomato sauce to finish up the can (which is fine because we needed the sauce for the chili mac).  Good stuff! Great with a spoonful of sour cream.

More like 4-1/2 stars.  I made this, along with Smokin' Scoville's Turkey Chili for my Super Bowl Party this year and my guests preferred the Turkey Chili.  I did also.  That's not to say, this isn't a great recipe...it's quite yummy and pretty easy to make as well.  I doubled both recipes, prepared them as written and served them the next day, in Crock-Pots set on "warm".  Quite a crowd pleaser, but my crowd gave the winning edge to Smokin' Scoville.

Deb says that this recipe wins in every chili cook-off she enters it. So I entered this recipe in our church's annual chili cook-off. I have never been a great cook, so I thought it probably won't win any prizes. I live in Texas so the competition is fierce, and I had to enter it in the "Non-Texas" category because it has beans in it. (However, that's where the majority of entries were!) The judging was done blindly; the judges tasted in a separate room and the chilis were numbered. Mine was lucky no. 7 (out of 14 in the category), and it won! It is a true blue-ribbon recipe. It got lots of compliments. It could have been a might spicier for my Texan taste, but for those not used to spice it's perfect--award-winning in fact!

Boyfriend and I loved this recipe!! I made the mistake of adding 4 table spoons of chili powder instead of seasoning.. yes, there is a difference. I felt as though it was off and google came to the rescue! I added 2 teaspoons of cumin to make up for my mistake. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. This chili with corn bread was awesome!! My bf preferred chili cheese dogs. :) Will be making this for my nephews bday this weekend just to show off my killer "cooking skills". soooo easy to make!

When you goto make a chili this simple do you really need a recipe anymore?  This has got to be the most boring and bland chili ever, but then again it has nothing interesting in the recipe to make it shine.  Chili is very much up to whatever somebody likes and you can pretty much throw in everything but the kitchen sink to your liking and unique to your own taste.  But this one here is a real letdown and bland.

I am not a "gourmet" cook and I am not talented enough to experiment and come up with something worthy of a 5 star restaurant; however, I do enjoy a good, hearty, easy, crowd pleasing recipe such as this one.  I followed it to the letter and thought it was the best chili I've had in a very long time.  If you want to compete in the nationals for technique, artisitc flair and worldwide notoriety, then you are visiting the wrong site.  I loved this recipe because its down-home, easy cooking and it was soooooo delicious.  Some of the best professional chefs I know live by simplicity = perfection.  Deb...thanks so much for sharing.  One of the best recipes I've tried on here.  I will be making again and again and again!!!!

My hubby and I LOVED this chili!  It's so simple, and so good!  I only used one pound of lean ground beef, added a green bell pepper and used a bit more tomato sauce.  Delicious with Hot Pace Picante and McCormick Chili Seasoning!

A thick and superb chili. Simple and easy to make is an added bonus. Per DEBZDOO’s review, I substituted Pace Picante Sauce, Hot for the salsa and used a 1.75 oz. packet of French’s Chili-O Original Seasoning Mix (almost 5 tablespoons) as I could not find Williams Original. I substituted minced garlic for the garlic salt to lower the hefty 55% daily value of sodium for 1 serving – other ingredients add a sufficient amount of salt. This chili recipe is among the top rated and most saved, and that nearly says it all. We’ll be making this over and over again, and many thanks to Deb for sharing her prize winning recipe.

Figured I'd try a new recipe given the great reviews.  Sorry, I would have to say I prefer the salsa I typically use in my Chili which has chunky tomatoes, beans and corn in it.

Made this last night for supper and everyone loved it, including the picky one. Pickiest of them all was asking if there was any left over she could have for supper tonight and wanted me to make it again since there wasn't. It is a very good Chili though doesn't make a very big pot. The key to a good Chili soup is to simmer and then let set for a couple hours before eating. I used a quart of my own home canned tomato juice instead of of the tomato sauce and a pint of my own salsa is all I did different. Oh kids like noodles in theirs so I cooked some macaroni on the side for the 2 that wanted that.

The best and easiest Chili ever!  This recipe is SO adaptable to suit anyones taste.  I made a few minor alterations for myself, I used one can kidney, and one can black beans.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with green chili's.  A couple cloves of minced garlic (cause I love garlic), and viola!  Awesome Chili!

This chili was just what I wanted in chili....nothing funky, nothing I never expected to be in chili....just standard, good chili.  It was a little bit spicy for us, but I can never be totally sure how close my version is to the original, because we live in Germany and the ingredients are sometimes a little different, like the chili seasoning.  I added a little more tomato sauce, because it was a little bit thick.  Next time I will add less chili seasoning.  This chili wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was the best I've made and I will make it again.  It's perfect for hotdogs!

Well this is certainly an easy chili.  Like most people I used the chili mix from this site.  Okay so I figured out why it was dry the last time I made it, I used tomato paste instead of sauce. I can't believe I didn't catch that.  After making it with sauce and 1lb beef and 1lb sausage, it came out as some of the best chili I ever had if not, the best.  

I will certainly make this again, thanks so much for sharing.

Definitely the easiest chili recipe, but I would not necessarily say it's the tastiest that ever existed!  With that being said, I would use this as a nice base recipe and add the things that I would prefer (real diced garlic instead of garlic salt, for example.)  Overall very good!

This was pretty good, but I didn't think this was the best chili I'd ever had like so many other reviews.  I'm not sure if it was the salsa (Tostitos) that I used or what, but it was almost sweet.  I think I will stick with my old faithful, but this was a nice little variation.

Super easy and very good.  I like that you can easily change the level of spice by using mild, medium, or hot salsa.  I've used McCormick mild and hot chili seasoning packets with this.

Used Pace Picante and one two packs of seasoning, one original and one hot to even it out ( I have kids) I like it spicy but edible.  Great and easy recipe in the crock pot.

One of the simplest chili recipes I have ever made, and simply THE BEST.  For seasoning, I used the recipe Chili Seasoning Mix II (from this site) minus the flour.  Delicious!  One word of advice for those who don't like spicy heat: watch the salsa that you use for this dish.  I am no wimp when it comes to spiciness.  I use a medium salsa, and the end result is always very spicy.

This is a quick recipe that can be easily modified to you own taste.  

I like to season ground beef while it is browning with a little seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and worcestshire sauce.  After all the ingredients were combined and had cooked for 30 minutes, I sprinkled all of the same seasonings, plus a 3 dashes of hot sauce, and a couple of pinches of pinches of granulated sugar to break up the acidity. The results were awesome! My whole family loved it!

YUM! Used turkey instead of beef and used a packet of Mc Cormick Chili seasoning. Salsa was an off brand you can buy at Kroger called Private Selection Restaurant Style. LOVE it. Has a lot of heat, which I like. Minor changes to a great recipe!

I'll rate again after making it the next time. I added some of the items the viewer said made it yummy and I did indeed love it. However I didn't win my cook off. I am going to blam it on not following the recipe. I still thought it was better than the others. And I will be using this recipe next time.

Quick, easy, convenient & the use of salsa give this chili a cooked-all-day big flavor. We made this for a small local Soup Kitchen our church is heading up because it enabled such a low prep/cook time & it was a huge hit. I think it just might replace my regular chili recipe I use at home as well. Thanks for sharing!

This is a terrrific recipe.  Be sure to read reviews. Sort by most helpful.  The contributor of this recipe comes up first and she says what brands to buy of salsa and seasoning.  I did add a bit of chili powder to make more spicy.

I made this using half ground turkey, half lean beef, and mixed up the beans using half red kidney beans, half black beans or garbanzo beans. You can also make this vegetarian by substituting Morningstar Crumbles for the meat. Delicious! This recipe got rave reviews from everybody.

Good & easy to make.  I added 2 jalapenos to kick up the heat a little bit.  After browning beef & onion, I threw it all into the crock pot to cook for the day. You can cook on high for 4 hours or low for 10 hours.

I loved how easy this was to prepare!  I did make a few minor changes.  Instead of garlic salt I used some dry garlic flakes, because I have to watch my salt intake.  I also changed the chili seasoning mix to cayenne pepper (powder).  This again was due to my watching the  salt content.  Next time I think I will add some Mexican style stewed tomatoes, because I just love tomatoes.  My husband liked this chili so much that he said to keep this recipe!

I made this today for tomorrow night's dinner.  It is sooo good!  We're currently waiting for our steaks on the grill that is tonight's dinner, but we keep going back to the chili!  The only change I made was I added a whole onion and I used a the whole package of chili mix.  This is a keeper!

What a great recipe for Chili. Great flavor for the few ingredients that are added. I did add a little more Hot Mexican Chili powder and also a little more Cumin. I love tomatoes and added 1 lg can of diced tomatoes to it and it was Fantastic!  Only one problem, NO LEFTOVERS!  Will have to double next time!!

This is exactly how I make mine except that I double and maybe triple this recipe.  I also add a little more spice to mine.  My husband loves spicy.  I'll put a far of pace salsa that is HOT in it to give it more kick.  I also cooked the meat in olive oil.

YUMMY!!  I didn't have any tomato sauce or canned tomatoes in my pantry tonight, so I subbed in a jar of spaghetti sauce and crossed my fingers!  Success!  The family loved it!   Will definitely make again, but will use the recipe ingredients next time.  ; )

This is my all time favorite chili recipe. Today instead of ground beef I used leftover chopped up tri tip that I roasted yesterday.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes and a smaller can of tomato sauce. I use what ever canned beans I have on hand. This variation was delish! I love this basic recipe!

Wonderfully simple and tasty!  I used home-canned salsa and tomato sauce, which can sometimes taste a bit more acidic than commercial, so I added a little bit of brown sugar to counteract the acidity.  The recipe didn't specify whether or not to drain the bean liquid; to reduce sodium, I did drain them and didn't miss that liquid at all.  I served this with sour cream and grated cheddar cheese on the side - it was delicious with or without the extras!  My hubby has already requested I make this again.

So good! This was pretty painless to make, but it is SO delicious. I literally had it three times within two days. Couldn't stop eating it. So easy to add any vegetables you want as well.

This is the chili I am known for making and it is always popular! I do add two cans of pinto beans as well as the kidney beans for texture. If you do that, add 1 more cup tomato sauce and 1 more tablespoon chili seasoning.

I am sooo happy !! Just finished eating this easy to make chili. I live in Norway and have always wanted to try this dish americans talk about on tv and internet. And unfortuneatly tried some bad recipes. But after I tried this recipe I no longer have to search - this is a keeper. I don't always have the right ingredients for american recipes since they aren't sold in this country so I have to substitute. And I used 1 clove garlic and an asian chili sauce - tasted awesome.   Since I am pregnant I always want something spicy and this was perfect !!! And I saved a huge portion for my kids before I added the chili. My 3,5 yr old and 15 months old who have hardly been eating for the past weeks - wolfed it down. My eldest ate a big grown up portion and said M-m-mmmm....the whole meal :o) my youngest opened his mouth wideopen (for a change) and ate without having toys to distract him. So I understand this chili is such a crowdpleaser and awardwinning !!!! Can't wait until I make this to some of my friends and family....  Thank you for a great recipe !!!!!

Made this with venison, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  My husband told me to get rid of my "old" chili recipe that I had used for years.  This is the "new" favorite chili.  Made it for our church chili cook off and won first prize.  Just enough of a kick to make it interesting, but not "nuclear reactor melt down" as some chili that I have had.  Perfect in every way.

Awesome.  I took out half the ground meat and added that much stew meat (browned) in little chunks.  And I threw in some garlic cloves with the hamburger.  The stew meat gave a great texture.  EVERYONE loved this.  I simmered it in my slow cooker for about 5 hours.  It was the best chili I've ever made by far.  Won't be looking for another recipe!

This is the easiest chili recipe I have ever used, and I ALWAYS get rave reviews when i make it. I always cook it in the crock pot on low for 6-8 hours rather than on the stove top (easier to start it and leave), and have never been disappointed.

This chili was so easy to make, & delicious.

After the chili had simmered for one hour: I layered the chili onto a bed of  white tortilla chips on a baking sheet, put a layer of mild grated cheddar cheese on it, & baked it in the oven until the cheese melted.

Then served the loaded nachos with 4 different bowls of cold condiments: shredded lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, fresh mild salsa, to dip.

I wish I would have picked up pickled jalepenos & sliced black olives too. Next time!

It was fun to eat the chili this way & we enjoyed the meal.

Thank you for this excellent recipe. I also loved that I didn't need to use a knife at all to prepare this entire meal! Preparation was so simple & efficient.

someone else mentioned how they often skipped over this recipe because it sounded too simple. I must admit I did the same thing. I would go to the most labor intensive chili recipe on this site and toil over the stove to make an awesome meal for my family. I finally tried this recipe about 4 years ago and was so happy with the end result. Not only was it delicious, but it was so simple!! This is now my "go to" chili recipe and we look forward to the cold winter months when I will cook it often. Thanks Ded for sharing such a treasure with us!!

Now, that's a great bowl of red!! Very easy recipe, no unnecessary flavors/ingredients, and was on the table in about 2 hours start to finish. I followed the recipe as given and we loved the taste but because we enjoy a little "sweat" with our chili I added some cayenne pepper and simmered a bit longer. Personally, we think that only upped the overall appeal.  By far this is a great base chili to get creative with your own family’s likes and dislikes. A different salsa, diced tomatoes in place of sauce, some chopped green pepper, more or less beans … the combinations are endless … but so delicious!!  Here’s a suggestion that doesn’t pertain to this recipe, but chili in general … both of my grandmas and great-grams added diced potatoes to their chili … sometimes sweet corn … who knew?!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I always make the recipe the first time as written and then if I don't like something in it, then I may add or change it the next time.

My husband told me to not change a thing in this recipe, it was delicious the way it was written.  Thanks for sharing.

This was my first attempt at making chili and the whole family loved it!  Since I'm not a huge fan of beans, I omitted them and added some canned corn.  Also upped the chili seasoning a bit and added a bit extra salsa.  It was delicious!!!!

I almost wish I had a chili contest to enter this into!  Of course being from the SW I modified it just a little. I used one pound of buffalo and one of ground beef.  Instead of tomato sauce I used 2 cans of diced tomatos with fire roasted chiles, half a jar of hot salsa - though I may add the other half jar later.  Then to sneak in more veggies I grated one large carrot and diced up two large ribs of celery.  This is the chili recipe I've been looking for for a long time!

Good basic recipe but not spicy enough for me. Went with 1# ground beef, 1# hot sausage and added another tbs chili pepper, 1.5 tsp of salt, and 1 can beef broth. If you want it hot add 2 tsp diced jalapenos. Like mine a little smoother rather than chunky so I pureed 1/2 mixture for the texture I like. Everyone's different but I think the changes I made put it over the top.

This was very good.  After reading the reviews, I too, used fresh garlic instead of salt and added a can of Rotel.  I also put in 2 cans of chili beans and a can of diced jalapenos.  Even better the next day!

I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey instead of ground beef and it still turned out wonderful! Other healthy substitutes include low sodium kidney beans and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I am a spice baby and this has a lot of kick so if you have a delicate tongue i recommend mild instead of medium picante sauce. Fantastico!

Our new favorite chili recipe!  Easy to prepare with fabulous results.  Could not find William's Original so I had to substitute with Lawry's Chili Seasoning.  Used a potato masher to finely mince the browning meat.  Added the beans and mashed lightly again to open up the beans for a smoother texture. Topped with a little shredded cheddar, sour cream and minced green onion...this is chili perfection!

This recipe is definitely worthy of a 5 star review. It uses basic ingredients, is easy to prepare, and is the BEST chili I have ever had. This is my new chili recipe and will replace all others. Usually a chili tastes better the next day, but this one is good from the get-go. I absolutely recommend you try this!

This was SOOOO good!!!My husband is VERY particular and picky about his chili because his dad makes the "best" chili (in his eyes) that he's ever had. I was unsure how he'd like this considering how simple it seemed; however, he raved about how delicious it was! He even admitted that it's better than his dad's chili, which means this recipe definitely gets 5 stars from us! I pretty much followed the recipe to the "T". The only difference I made was using 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey. We used Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site as well (as another reviewer suggested). It was perfect!

This is GREAT, and ridiculously easy! Slightly on the sweet side, probably because of the onion I used, very pleasing and you can kick up the heat or tone it down from the chili seasoning you use! I let it simmer for about 2 hours, 3 if you have time. Even better the next day! Total keeper for ease and wonderful results!
UPDATE: I have made this....dozens....of times at this point. Ii is still amazing. This recipe is extremely flexible; when I need to make it on the cheap, use 1 lb 80/20 ground beef, double the onion, use a whole 15 oz jar of salsa, (3) 15 oz cans of beans, and a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, and a 15oz can of tomato sauce. If you happen to have fresh garlic cloves, put 2 or 3 of those in there, too. Corn bread is a GREAT side to fill you up on the cheap, too.
I can make a POT of this for $9 or less by cutting the beef and making it veggie heavy. Shop sales to make it even less expensive. Keeps in the fridge for DAYS or freeze it.

Holy !  Sometimes simple is the best!  I made this chili specifically for the suggestion of chili-cheese fries mentioned on these reviews.  In order to make, I used the Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe from this site since I hate all the funny ingredients listed on those seasoning packets.  Amazing!

Very good chili. Not a lot of heat for us though so we added about 1 T. chili powder and a dash of cayenne pepper.

I must say that my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by this simple chili! It's so easy and tastes really good. It's been raining here for 2 days so I decided to make chili last minute which I would never do. My normal chili recipe takes all day! This is a great "quick fix" chili recipe! I followed the directions and it turned out perfect.

First time making chili, and it turned out so good! Both my husband and 3 year old daughter were saying "mmmm" as they ate it. I let it simmer about 2 hours and made Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site also. Topped the chili with cheese and sour cream. Hot sauce and onions on the side. So easy, so delicious!

Absolutely delicious! The best tasting chili I have found. I discovered this recipe 2 months ago and have already made it 5 times due to requests!! I tried putting a tsp of brown sugar in it the last time and it came out great- just a hint of sweet and spicy! This recipe also works well with ground turkey.

Did this exactly as described and it turned out great.  My only thought is that it could be more spicy!  Would add more chili powder in next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was so easy to make and it tasted delicious. If you like your chili spicy, make sure to add chili powder and use a hot salsa. This is going to be my "base" chili recipe now and I look forward to adding more ingredients to it and trying new things. Thanks Deb!

Yum!  Made it just according to the recipe.  Used a "hot" chipotle salsa and it added just the right amount of heat.  Used the lower salt chili seasoning mix to help eliminate some salt. Perfect!  Will definitely make again.

I am originally from Texas and I have made my own version of chili for years but when I saw this one, I had to try it. Following the recipe to the "T" (retired military) and using Debdoozie's update using the Pace picante sauce (it is made in my hometown of San Antonio) and McCormick’s chili seasoning mix, (my only choice locally) my family absolutely love it over my own rendition. This is a keeper, thanks!

The only change I made was that I used one envelope of chili seasoning mix (1 1/2 tbsp) instead of the 4 tbsp. I prefer a mild chili and one envelope was perfect. Adding more would add way too much sodium (1 envelope has 420mg). I had Mild Salsa on hand, so that is what I used. You could always make this hotter by using Hot Salsa or add chili powder. I will make this again.

This was delicious!
I've been wanting chili for the past week and I finally decided that I would make it myself. I used this recipe and I also used some of the pointers that I found in the reviews. 
I used ground turkey, red onion, no garlic salt.
I added a can of drained corn, a can of drained mushroom and used the whole can of both of the kidneys (after draining them). I also didn't use as much of the chili seasoning (didn't want it to be too salty).  
I let it simmer for an hour and I served it with corn bread and shredded reduced fat cheese.
Everyone loved it! Will be my staple chili recipe!

We weren't wowed by this recipe. The flavor is awful if you eat it the first day, all you can taste is the chili powder in the seasoning pkt. Much better the 2nd day. It's super thick & does taste a bit like Wendy's chili.

Not the best I have ever had, but the closest I have gotten to the best! My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with this. Next time, I will only use one can of beans and I will use a tablespoon or 2 more of the chili seasoning mix. GOOD!

Loved this chili just as it was.  I followed it exactly and only added a can of corn for a little color.  It was so easy and tasted great!

Yummy....made it for the superbowl with jalapeno cheddar cornbread and it was all a hit. I added canned corn, rotel, and used spicy pasta sauce in place of plain tomato sauce. This is my new chili recipe!

Chalk up another 1st place ribbon!  I used this recipe for our church's annual chili cook-off and it was the winner.  Because I tripled the recipe, I used tomato juice instead of sauce and added a large can of diced tomatoes, too (just because my family likes them).  I think the salsa makes it stand out above the rest.  This recipe is simple, quick and inexpensive for feeding a crowd...Thanks for a great recipe!

Great, easy recipe. I wouldn't recommend it for folks who like it spicy (as it's not spicy at all), but with young children this was perfect. Thanks for sharing!

WOW!  The best I've every made!  I ONLY changed 3 small things: when I sauteed the meat in the onion, I included the garlic salt; used one can of beans because my husband doesn't like too many; drained the beans but added about a 1/2 c of water.  Those are just little tweaks.

This is a phenomenal recipe!!!!  It's a keeper!  I may even try it in a chili cookoff!

The chili is really good.. I personally am not a fan of Williams seasoning but I took a chance and made it accordingly..4 tablespoons is waay to much.. should only b 2.. really.. 3 is pushing it..fan or no fan Williams is overbearing and I tasted it prior to adding the last 2 as I was debating..man I regretted it.. Great recipe to play with for sure... will make again but with my own twist.. Thanks DebDoozie!

So good.  I think this is our new "go to" chili recipe.  It was really easy to make, which is always a bonus.  The only thing I did different was I used one pound of ground turkey and substituted one can of pinto beans for one the cans of kidney beans.  I served it with "Golden Sweet Cornbread" from this site and it was exactly what I was looking for!  Tasted just as good as my mom's chili.

This is the BEST chili recipe I've tried!  Great as written, thanks!  Adding this 3/09/11, although we LOVE this recipe as written, we have started adding one can of sloppy joe sauce for 1 cup of the tomato sauce ocasionally for something different and really like it that way too!

I think everyone that has ever commented or put a positive opinion on this recipe was right. I made a few tweeks for my own personal preference but their is nothing that can ruin this if you just follow what it says and only add or take away a few things here and there.

Made this for a party and everyone loved it. I browned the meat on the stove and then combined all the ingredients in a crockpot and heated on low until I was ready to serve.

I tried this chili for the first time last night.  After eating it, my husband told me to throw away all my other chili recipes and to make this one every time!  He loves our local restuarant's chili but said this was even better!  Thanks!!

After trying numerous chili recipes, I have turned to two as my go to chili recipes.  I use this one for when I am pressed for time.  I love how easy the recipe is and how little time it takes to throw a batch together.  You can adjust the heat easily too, by the type of salsa used.  It really doesn’t get much easier!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I was worried there would be too much spice. But using the full spices and only 3/4 cup of salsa walked the line perfectly between adaquate to give it a kick while being edible.  Unfortunately, it tastes like every other chili out there. With way too much beef - 2 POUNDS!! That's insane. Maybe if it were 1.5 lbs, but that still sounds like a ton. There just isn't enough variety of flavors in it, it's all beef and beans - boring, if quite good.  I will give you that this is incredibly easy to make, and be sure you drain that fat. And now I have TONS of leftovers... oh boy.

After all of the wonderful reviews, I was excited to make this recipe.  I followed this recipe to a "T" and found it edible but bland with lack of any flavor excitement.    After letting it simmer for 1.5 hrs and tasting, I added green chiles to help.  This made it spicier but still no flavor.  there are much better chili's out there

I absolutely love this chili, as does everyone who tastes it!

Updated 6/25/2014: In my last couple of batches I have substituted 1lb ground turkey and 1lb turkey italian sausage to lower the calorie count. Fantastic flavor. I also use "Chili Seasoning Mix II" for the chili mix. Great flavors all around!

Yummy chili with a kick!  (Depending on what salsa you add; plus I did half HOT italian sausage and half ground turkey-spicy)  I will probably just make it with ground turkey next time to cut down on calories bc it has great flavor, and I don't think turkey will cut down on taste.  I would also add another can of beans next time because it is really meat-y.

Awesome! I used garlic powder and a little salt since I didn't have garlic salt. I could not find the recommended chili mix :-(  I did add a can of drained pinto beans and corn. I served it with corn muffins made with sour cream. We had more than enough for 2 days. Perfect for "football" Sunday! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I LOVE this chili, I am not a very experienced cook and was looking for something that tasted great, didn't take a lot of work and didn't have a ridiculous amount of ingredients, and this was perfect, it does taste a lot like Wendys Chili which I also love lol..I threw mine in the crock pot after I browned the meat and onions and left it for a few hours, and threw a few splashes of tabasco in there, and ate it with sharp cheddar and oyster crackers yum!

This was the first chili I have ever made, and I did make several changes to the original recipe.  First, I used lean ground turkey to make it a bit healthier.  I added 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and a sprinkle of coarse kosher salt. Tonight was my first time using my chopper machine and I must have done something wrong because the onion somehow pureed in the chopper. I still used it, it just made the chili less chunky.  However, I did add about 1/2 of a chopped green bell pepper.  Finally the last bit of difference is that I sprinkled a few sprinkles of Louisiana Hot Sauce in it to give it some heat.  I don't know if it's beginner's luck or what-- but it came out beyond perfect!

I made this EXACTLY as written, and it's so good! I don't know how many chili recipes i've tried off this site, but this recipe goes to show that the simplest can be the best! This is the one i'm sticking with from now on.

I make this at least once a month, and I never, ever have enough leftovers. I make it in the crock pot for at least 6 hours. Brown meat and onions and throw everything else in, stir and let cook! I use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, hot chili seasoning, hot Pace Picante (about 2/3rds of the bottle), and a good dash of Tabasco. Add a little water if it's looking too thick. Perfect!!

I won!  This was my first time making chili ever and I entered it into a neighborhood chili contest and we won!  This is a great tasting and so simple to make chili.  I used the Chili Seasoning Mix II as the homemade chili seasoning instead of store bought and it complimented this recipe perfectly.  I will definitely be making this as my "go to" recipe from now on!

This was soooo easy and delicious! It had good heat but not burning (I used HOT salsa and a can of Rotel tomatoes with Green Chilies). I usually experiment with chili, but I think I have found a regular recipe with this one!!
**Update...still making this chili, over and over. I've had several requests for it as well! My own personal tweaks, but the recipe as written is darn close.This WILL be your go to chili...promise!! Enjoy!
UPDATE: 4/2/11- still making this my staple chili...this served with Cheddar cheese, sour cream and crushed Fritos on top= HEAVEN!

This is a great recipe! I made this for the  family tonight and everyone loved it. I had six adults and it was plenty. I served it with Rice and had corn muffins. I only added a little more chile seasoning. I like it a little more spicy. Iwill use this recipe from now on. Thank you Deb!

Great, easy go-to chili recipe. The only changes I made to this were to add a can of chili beans, a few tbls of balsalmic vinegar and I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Excellent!

I've been searching for a chili recipe to suit my taste and here it is!  I used the slow cooker method and was very happy with the results.  I used Morningstar Vegetarian Burger Crumbles instead of ground beef and found a Wendy's chili seasoning mix copycat recipe online that I used.  Medium salsa lends the perfect amount of heat.  Next time, I'm going to add just a touch of brown sugar and see what that does.  Brilliant recipe; thank you for sharing!

I really liked this recipe, I only had 1 pound of ground beef so I halved the recipe.  I used the chili seasoning mix recipe called (Chili Seasoning Mix ll).  I also only had pinta beans so I used those.  I browned the onion and beef then threw everything in the crock-pot for a few hours.  It was great and I couldn't stop eating it!

This is the best chili we've ever had..even better than Tim Horton's!  I added fresh garlic,celery,red & green pepper to the meat as it was browning along with the garlic salt & 1tbs of the chili powder.  I then put the meat in the crock pot with 1 28oz & 1 15oz can dark red kidney beans and the rest of the recipe and added a can of chopped tomatoes. cooked on high for 1 hr then low for a few hours. Served with Favorite Corn Bread..mmmm delicious

Used this recipe and entered it in our chili cookoff at work and won 1st place.  It's very Wendy's-like.  I used Herdez picante instead of Pace just because I like it better.  I also used 1/2 ground turkey instead of ground beef.  The seasoning is just right - I was worried about dumping so much black pepper into it - but it was just perfect.  This is a keeper for sure.

I've got this in the crockpot right now. I brown the meat in the skillet, then add in chopped onion and 3 garlic cloves. Drain the grease, and then I add it to the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients. Also, I add in a can of drained corn, and about 3 tbsp. jalapenos. Cook on low all day and serve with cornbread. My family loves this meal!

We enjoyed this recipe alot. I added a 16oz jar of Chipotle salsa and used garlic powder instead of the garlic salt. I think it adds more flavor. With a sprinkle of sharp cheddar cheese on the top it made it a very hearty meal. Next time i think i am going to try chili fries!! Thanks for this delicious recipe :-)

I really love this recipe!  The first time I made it, I made it as written and it was really quite enjoyable- but I could see some adjustments I could make to suit my family and make it really shine at our Christmas Eve dinner.  So what I did the second time around was the following: I used one pound of hamburger and one pound of Jimmy Dean spicy sausage;  I used a whole large onion, and also several cloves of fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic salt; I replaced about half of the tomato sauce with Spicy V8 Juice; and I added a can of Rotel.  I cooked the chili the night before on the stove top, then let it meld overnight in the fridge and the next day I tossed it in the crock pot to simmer for a good part of the day before serving.  Finally, after tasting it, I opted to add a couple dashes of hot sauce, as we like our chili rather spicy.  My family REALLY loved this!  One of my favorite things about any chili recipe is how adaptable they are to personal tastes, and I am sure I will continue to play around with this one some more throughout the winter.  Thanks for a great recipe Deb!  It really is a winner, even without any changes  :)

DELISH!  So easy!  I scaled the recipe to 16 so we could freeze some for lunches.  I used 2 packages of McCormick MILD Chili Seasoning and one 16oz jar of MEDIUM Pace Picante.  Served over elbow macaroni, and everyone loved my Chili Mac!

This recipe truly lived up to its name!  I've never made chili in my life and was coaxed into entering a chili cook-off contest at work because someone had dropped out at the last minute.  Based on the number of reviews and the ratings this recipe received and how simple and easy based on the ingredients listed and directions, I decided to give this one a try.  To my surprise, and I shouldn't have been, it won 1st place!  Thank you for posting this!  This is definitely a keeper!!!!

Okay, i have to admit at 1st i was skeptical...but then i made it yesterday and my hubby kept telling me how good this was (huge smile on my face) - best one i have ever made he said!  I like to read other reviews to see what needs tweaking before i try a recipe.  I did almost exactly as stated by Deb.  I just added chopped garlic to the onion and ground beef mix and i used a whole 16 oz jar of chunky salsa (Pace Medium) and then a can of mexican diced tomatoes vs. tomato sauce.  After cooking beef/onion and garlic i drained and put in crock pot over the beans and tomatoes.  then layered remaining ingredients w/1 tsp each of cumin and cayenne pepper.  Cooked on low for couple of hrs; turned it off and added 1 chopped green pepper and 1/2 red pepper.  stirred and let sit for 30 min.  I like my peppers al dente/crunchy.  Came out PERFECT!!!  i actually wish i had doubled the recipe!  Served over Ditalina pasta and my hubby likes to eat his over salad and/or with Fritos on top.  I think the package of chili seasoning mix, salsa and can of mexican tomatoes it what made it so much better than any other i have tried.  I am tossing out all other recipes and replacing with just this one.  Like Mac and Cheese recipes, I like to keep trying a bunch until i find one that i can perfect and call a keeper.  This is a DEFINITE keeper!  Would rate on scale of 1-10 - a 15!  Must make it!

I am a 53 year old man who loves chili.  I have only made chili from the recipe that my Mom passed down to me years ago.  Since discovering your recipe, I am sorry to say Mom,  this is the best chili I have ever tasted.  I only use your recipe now.  It gets two thumbs up from my family.  Thanks Deb.

EASY! EXCELLENT!

I didn't see the note from Deb about using a specific brand of salsa & chili seasoning until I was already cooking..will try her brand next time.. 

I used Turkey, generic chili spice and a very nice black bean and corn salsa. 

It was super easy to make, tasted very good the first day and was beyond fantastic on day two. 

Especially because it was so easy, this will be one I'll make again!!

This recipe is great! I have made it maybe 10 times. Every time it comes out great. Easy to change to your taste buds. 
I use ground turkey and spicy Italian sausage, a whole onion, garlic and a can of chili beans with whatever goes in the can. I just put it all in our stew pot all clad thingy. It's 8 am ATM and i can't wait for tonight it will be so good! I pair it with homemade cornbread(the neelys cornbread muffins) but i can't wait to have it with french fries and cheese!. Thanks for the wonderful Recipe.

I use Hot salsa and Hot chili seasoning mix. Hot but not too hot. I cooked mine about 4 hours in a crock pot. 5 stars are not enough to rate!

Actually, I doubled this recipe and added fresh chopped green peppers and sliced mushrooms the last 10 minutes of the simmering time. My family loved the chile--- a bit on the hot side, but that's the way we like it.  FYI--- 4 tbsp. of chile seasoning is equal to one packet of pre-packaged chile seasoning. This recipe is very easy and good. I have a family recipe that I have used for years, but this one is so easy, it is a keeper!

I'm usually very liberal with five star ratings because most recipes on this site are really good. This chili recipe is an exception. It's not bad, per se, it's just very ordinary and uninspired. I made it exactly as instructed and was very underwhelmed with the results. I don't get the hype, to be honest. Chili isn't rocket science... the more onions and garlic and tomatoes and peppers in it, the better. This recipe lacked the good fresh chunky stuff and it shows. Now I have a huge pot of leftovers.

Delicious! This was a big hit and will be my permanent, "go-to" Chili recipe.  The salsa really IS the key to great flavor.  I used lean ground pork instead of beef, and I reduced the tomato sauce to 2 cups, making up for the the other 1/2 cup with beer, which I've always added to my chili.  In addition, I used the entire envelope of chili seasoning mix, and I used garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt, as the packaged mix and salsa already contain salt. Next time I might do the entire 12-oz. jar of salsa, but I wanted to use the suggested amount for the first attempt. I snipped some green onions (scallions) to sprinkle on top of each bowl to add a little color.  Heat level can be easily controlled by using MILD chili mix and MILD salsa. I used Medium for both, and might even ramp it up next time to HOT!  Thanks, Deb - this is definitely a keeper.

A good and easy chili recipe. I prefer mine with chunky veggies so maybe a more chunkier salsa. I topped off with cheddar and green onions. Yummy!

I made this Chili last night and it came out pretty good. I followed the recipe and suggestions. I did you one can of light red kidney beans and one can of chili beans. I also used some maggi sauce for a seasoning to add flavor. Again, it was very easy to make and will use it again for something quick to make. Thanks

I followed this recipe almost exactly but I added a jalapeno and used Lawry's chill seasoning--used the whole packet.   Used a mix of chli beans and red kidney beans, and added a 12oz can of diced tomotoe/green chili mix.  Added a dash of chipolte powder, a tablespoon of garlic (have a 24oz jar of garlic from Costco)  Making it again today but using antelope hamburger instead of ground beef.    A very good recipe and easy to make.   VERY GOOD recipe!!

I am a chili newbie, and this chili turned out fabulous. I made it for a party I had for a bunch of French people. They all loved it! Yay for simple American chili.

Very tasty. All I had were black beans, so I used them instead. Great recipe with lots of flavor.

My chili gets rave reviews but it takes a long time to prepare and tonight I was in a lazy mood so I thought I'd try this recipe because of all the great reviews. Hubby and nephew liked it well enough, but for me it was just okay. A little too tomato-y (even though I cut the tomato sauce to 2 cups and added a can of diced tomatoes) and super thick. I had to add beef broth to thin it out a little. I don't care for kidney beans so I used pinto, black and great northern beans. It had absolutely no kick and we like our food spicy, so I added a teaspoon of cayenne and a jalapeno. All in all I think this is a good springboard recipe.

OMG this is my first time making chili and chose to go with this recipe because I was on a very tight budget and I wanted something that would be easy,filling,and quick to prepare. Well by far this was sooooo good and meet my family expectations. I used pinto beans and kidney beans also added a little texas pete hot sauce and a few sprinkles of sugar to take away some of the tomato paste. Followed up with buttered yellow corn muffins. Great chili thanks big time for this recipe.

I've tried a few chili recipes from this site, and this is my favorite.  I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. ground venison.  I don't keep chili seasoning mix on hand, so I used "Chili Seasoning Mix II" from this site.  This recipe will be a repeat at our house.

This is truly the best chili ever! I have entered it into a chili contest and won 1st Place.  I do add a can of Bush's Baked Beans chili starter, and hot pepper flakes to this recipe which really adds to the already awesome ingredients.

I made this chili for supper tonight,  absolutely wonderful!!   I have made lots of chili over the years but could never find the perfect one.  This was super delicious.  I did put in some diced tomatoes with green chilis,  and I used homemade chili seasoning and used as much as I wanted to my liking.  This recipe is definately a keeper!!  thanks

This was my first time making chili and my BF said that it was better than his mom's!!! This was a simple recipe. I used black beans because I don't care for kidney beans. We ate it plain and also over spaghetti noodles with cheese and sour cream. 
Dee-lish!!!!

This was a really good chili, the only thing different is I threw the whole package of chili mix in. Other than that my husband practically ate all of it I only had two bowls (about  a cup each..)

This recipe is fantastic with both recipes.  Hope you reprint    Chili Mix   4 T chili powder  1 T crushed red pepper   1 T dried onion  1 T dried onion   2 tsp sugar  2 tsp cumin  2 tsp parsley  2 tsp salt   1 tsp basil  1/4 tsp pepper  Store in air tight container.  This is meant to go with the chili recipe

Very good.  As mentioned in another review, it is a lot like Wendy's chili, but with more flavor and not mushy.  I used 93% lean hamburger, which came in a 2.25lb package (I used all of it), diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and drained the "sauce" from the kidney beans, as well as drained the fat off the hamburger.  I added a cup of water since it seemed a little dry and I like it slightly soupy.

Serve up with some cornbread for an excellent meal!

This was the first Chili I ever made and my husband loved it!! I have to admit it is really good and has great flavor! I looked at the reviews and like others I added a can of diced tomatoes and diced green chilies (rotel). I also used a little salt and garlic powder since I didnt have any garlic salt on hand. I used one can of dark red kidney beans and one can of pinto beans! Definitely a 5 star chili!!

Awesome chili! I used a pound of extra lean ground chicken and a pound of hot turkey sausage out of the casing and crumbled.  Used Spicy Chili Seasoning Mix from this site instead of store bought packaged.  Also added a 14 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Loved the use of salsa in this too. Very flavorful and tasty chili.  Topped with low fat sour cream and 50% less fat shredded white cheddar. Thanks!

This chili is really easy to make and tastes great.  This recipe is a keeper.  I think it's better than the chili I was making using dried beans, so I think I'll be making this from now on because it is so easy and tastes great.

Yum yum yum! This was my first time making chili and it was very tasty and easy to make. I dont enjoy cooking most of the time, but i enjoyed making this. We did it in the slow cooker over night. mMmMmMm

I was surprised how good this chili was.  I'm not really a chili fan.  I also used the Chili Seasoning Mix II found on this website.  However next time I will leave out the salt because it was way too much.

Fantastic!  This is the recipe I will be using from now on.  I made it exactly as written, no changes needed.  Thick and hearty with lots of flavor.  I can see why it wins in contests.

This chili is super easy & super awesome!!!  We make it with ground turkey, which gives it more flavor & less fat.  It's also good with different varieties of beans, such as chili beans & Great Northern beans!  This recipe will not disappoint!

I made this a few days ago. This is an excellent recipe without a lot of fuss. I got rave reviews. I did make two slight changes. I used more chili seasoning then the recipe called for and I added a cube of chipolte seasoning. Other than that, I followed the recipe and this will be my go to recipe from now on. One thing I did notice was I thought my beef tasted a little bland so next time I think I will add some seasoning to the beef while browning. By the way, I made a double batch and it fed seven people with no leftovers.

Excellent recipe. Basic ingredients you usually have on hand. And so easy to adjust spice level to your own personal liking.

I made this just as directed and it was way too salty.   I used a 1/2 jar of the Picante (16 oz.) sauce as others recommended and even used a chili seasoning where the salt was in an optional packet (and I did not use it).  I typically add a lot of salt to my food and it was too salty even for me.  Maybe leaving out the garlic salt and using fresh garlic or a powder would improve it.  Can not serve it at party tomorrow.

This was a good, simple chili and I loved the ease of ingredients.  I had 3 lbs. of chili meat and thought it would be okay, but there really was too much meat, but that's my fault.  I also used a 28 oz. can of tomato sauce rather than throw away the 1/2 cup or so remaining in the can.  I may make this again with the 2 lbs.

I would highly recommend this recipe!  It was my first time making chili and it was SO easy and delicious!  It's one of the best chili's I've ever tasted...and I love chili so I've tasted a lot!  My husband loved it too!  I've already made it twice in two weeks!  If you're choosing a recipe to make, choose this one!

I followed this receipe pretty closely, i only made a few changes.  I used only one can of sauce and instead used 2 cans of Red Gold Chili Ready Diced tomatoes, one of the cans i blended down and one i just dumped in, also i added some paparika.  It was a big hit.

Very good.  Agree that the Pace Picante is the brand of salsa to use.  The 2nd time I made this I used a different kind and it was not as good.  A keeper!

Thanks for sharing this easy, delicious recipe.  I used ground chicken because that is what was in the fridge.  Never one to waste, I used a full onion, one large can (15oz) and one small can (8oz) of tomato sauce.  I bought a 16 oz jar of Pace Picante, so I just used the entire thing.  Glad I did! It was perfect.

I don't think I can ever make chili another way, we loved this recipe.  I did add a small can of corn because we love corn in our chili. We also topped it with shredded cheddar and sour cream  I also have made this with ground venison and it's wonderful like the ground beef.

Great recipe and I love how few ingredients there are for a chili recipe. Only additions we made were by adding diced 1/2 red bell pepper and 2 red chili peppers that we sauted with the beef.

Great, easy chili!  Like others suggested, I added pinto beans and a little extra tomato sauce (I actually used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes).  Put it in the slow cooker on low and served with biscuits, Fritos, cheese, and sour cream.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The perfect chili!  I usually just make chili from a packet and was bored of that so I tried this recipe - wish I'd found it sooner!  I halved the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  I added some leftover spaghetti sauce because I thought it needed some but that was my only change.  I used Tex-Mex chili seasoning and "medium" salsa and it was the PERFECT amount of heat!

Used this recipe last night and it was a huge hit... with a couple of minor adjustments. I used a 16 oz. jar of salsa, added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic, and 1 medium jalapeno pepper diced. I then split the recipe between 2 crock pots and in the 2nd one I added 4 more diced jalapenos and 2 tablespoons of habanero sauce to create "man chili" as my gang called it. It was HOT but delish! I served it with regular and jalapeno cheddar cornbread and they had a feast! Thanks so much for sharing!

My husband found this recipe about a year ago.  He doesn't cook very much, but insists on making this chili anytime its a "chili" day.  His "secret" ingredient is a pound of Bob Evans spicy sausage to kick it up a notch.  I have to admit - although I love my own chili - this is outstanding.  I prefer it over rice, but anyway you serve it, it's really great.

This recipe was so "semi-homemade" that I was a little suspicious at first, but it turned out delicious! all the flavors combined wonderfully and it tasted like made-from-scratch chili! My husband loved it, which is the ultimate test! Next time I will make it in the crock pot and let it simmer all day.

This is a fabulous, easy-fix chili recipe, just as written!  It can also easily be tweaked to suit one's taste. Since we like chili with NO beans, I omit the beans; use 1 lb. ground beef; 1.5 lbs. stew meat, chopped. I omit the garlic salt. Use 1 whole packet of McCormick Chili Seasoning; add 3 cloves fresh garlic. I add some beef broth (about 1/2 cup), strong brewed coffee (about 3/4 cup), 1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa; a dash of worcestershire sauce; 1 tbsp cumin and chili powder; 2 tbsp brown sugar. I think it's key to let it simmer (crockpot or stovetop) for 4+ hours for best flavor (best next day). My very picky DH loves this version of Deb's chili.

This chili was awesome! I made it with 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb ground beef. Browned meat with the onion (1 small) and 2 cloves garlic (instead of garlic salt). Threw the rest of the ingredients with drained meat in the crock pot, and had it at our football party. Everyone LOVED it! They were all asking for the recipe! Thanks!

Had this for dinner on Halloween and it was good. We like to top our chili with Doritos (crushed into bite size pieces), sharp Cheddar, and chopped onions. I used a slow cooker so each family member could serve themselves when they got home.

Ummmmmm..Ummmmmmm! I have been making chili for thirty hohum years and I thought I made really good chili. I made this chili recipe for a group of people for the Sunday Packer game and everyone (including me) just LOVED it. Guess my chili wasn't so hot after all. And the Packers won their first game out of 3 this season!

I have never liked homemade chili, but I absolutely love this.  I added a little bit more picante sauce, and I used the hot chili seasoning.  This is the BEST!!  I will be making this alot.  Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

This was the absolute best chili I have ever made.  Better than my moms and that is saying a lot.  The only thing I did different was add 3 garlic cloves, a lil chili powder for extra kick, garlic salt, and season salt to the meat itself to give it a lil flavor of its own. I also substituted the kidney beans for 2 15 oz cans of pinto beans.  One flavored with jalopenio peppers and one regular.  The spicier the better I say.  :-) Kellie

The final product was 5 star but I can only give this four because I altered this a bit.  I added one minced garlic clove when cooking the onions.  Added double chili seasoning.  Used one 14.5 can of chopped tomatoes with juice and just one 14.5 can of tomato sauce.  I also used chunky medium salsa about 10 oz.  Added a little brown sugar, black pepper and worcestershire sauce to taste.

This is Hall of Fame material, in my opinion.  I doubled the recipe the first time I made it, and we are looking forward to what little is leftover tonight. My only change includes adding  much more chili powder and quite a bit of tabasco, as we like spicy food. Otherwise, my first attempt at making chili was a great success, thanks Deb!

Delicious and easy especially if you have never made homemade chili and are used to the canned variety. I used a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the 2 1/2 cups of sauce. Simmer it in the crock pot for more ease and dont't worry about just the right seasoning. Two envelopes of any old store brand chili seasoning does the trick.

Good, basic chili. Not the best but it was good. I reduced the beef to 1 lb, sauted some chopped celery with the beef & onions, and used a less salsa. Also, I only used 1 can kidney beans and then a can of northen beans. Turned out tasty, esspecially with a sprinkle of sharp cheddar cheese over each bowl.

I didn't have a clue that chili this good could be so easy to make. This is the best recipe for chili I think you'll ever come across.

This was a really quick and easy recipe. My husband is not a big fan of beans, so we left them out and added a can of diced tomato. We all enjoyed it.

I made it with  the chili seasoning recipe I found on allrecipes, and used 2 cans of tomato sauce as 2&1/2 cups was more than 1 can but less than 2 and I thought it needed more liquid anyways.  I thought it was absolutely delicious, very easy to make, and the best part it is uses pantry staples so I can whip it up on a whim.  The only negative is I am not that intuitive of a cook and would love the recipe to be clearer on whether the beans should be drained or undrained (I drained them) or whether it should be cooking covered or uncovered (I left it uncovered).

I did make 1 change but don't really think it affected the recipe. I used a can of rotel tomatoes instead of salsa because that is what I had on hand. But I must tell you this was by far the best chili I have made.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.for me the rotel gave it a little too much kick so I added a little sour cream to mine. next time I will use mild salsa although DH loved it spicy.

This is an awesome and super easy recipe! I kind of tweaked though because I didn't have everything in my pantry. I didn't have premade chili seansoning so I made my own chili seasoning with chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, cayenne pepper, pinch of corriander, garlic powder, marjoram, and paprika. I had dark kidney beans, but I didn't have light kidney beans. I had ranch style beans with sliced jalepeno's which was an awesome substitute that I will probably use forever now! I also used a high quality organic lean ground beef which seriously is way more flavorful than the stuff in the plastic rounds. I didn't have tomato sauce either so I used tomato paste and made sauce out of it. And wow does mild pace picante make the biggest difference ever versus your plain diced tomatos! My husband said this was the best beef chili that  I have ever made and it was so easy. He wants me to make this every week now. Awesome recipe! this will def be a staple dinner in my house!

This chili recipe is amazing!  I have made it a number of times, and have made minor changes that make it taste even better in my opinion.  I use 2-3 pounds of ground turkey and use two full packages of chili seasoning.  I also cut down on the tomato sauce and increase the salsa.  I use a 14 oz container of rojos restaurant style salsa as well along with a 12 oz - 16 oz container of salsa verde with tomatillos and cilantro.  I also add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. Yum!!

I really must thank you Deb because I have made your wonderful chili many times and it is amazing.  Everyone I have served it to has just loved it.  I have been cooking for over 40 yrs and have made many types of chili, and even my own recipe, which is very good, cannot compare to this one.  I don't change it at all but I do add mushrooms because I love them in almost anything and I always have to double it to have leftovers the next day.  I have even had it for breakfast, it is so good and my family has even asked me to use this recipe from now on.  Thank you Debdoozie and if you have any other recipes to share I would indeed give them a try.   Pretzeld

I really like this recipe. I used the Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe on here. I also used pace medium for the salsa and a whole onion. That's the only changes I made.

Gave it a shot and won a Chili contest against people who labor intensively over their chili.  Only real changes I made were to make my own Chili Seasoning (with a little cinnamon in it) and soaked by beans instead of from a can.  I'll definitely make this again.

what a wonderful recipe. did not change a thing.  took a pot of this to work and the boss came back for more 3 times.  used mild salsa and it had just enough zip for most of us.  1 of the people added additional heat.  thank you for a really great recipe.

I made this yesterday because it was a rainy/overcast day, and a little cool.  I wanted to make chili that wasn't complicated but tasted great.  I have my own recipe that has a LOT of ingredients, but I didn't feel like doing all the work.  I stumbled on this recipe and gave it a shot.  Seriously... outstanding! I followed the recipe with no changes, other than that I simmered it in a crock pot for about 4 hours on high.  To me, it tastes like chili should! My mom used to make a recipe that tasted very similar - over the years she changed her recipe and I didn't like the results.  This is like am homage to my childhood :)  And quite honestly, I like it better than my complicated concoction.  Perfection!

Oh wow!! This is my first time cooking chili and it turned out great!  

It was so easy.  I cut the recipe to half as it's only 2 adults and 1 pre-schooler.  Hubby totally loved it..he ate it on its own whereas I made chili burritos.  

For lunch today, hubby and my LO had it with rice.  

the only change i made was the garlic salt which i didnt have.  So I just chopped the garlic and saute it together with the onion and beef.  Though i think i need to omit the salt the next round as the seasoning is salty enough.  

Definitely a keeper as it's easy to whip up after a hard day at work.

YUM! This was great, but I did a vegetarian version with no ground beef. I used homemade salsa, a can of corn, garbanzo beans, kidney beans, pinto beans, green bell peppers. I also added a little spice by using spicy salsa and green chilis. It was delcious

This is easy, tasty chili.  I've made it three times now.

I used the same ingredients just more of everything.  A whole onion, 2 cans of light and 2 cans of dark kidney beans, 15oz jar of salsa, 28oz can of crushed tomatoes (instead of sause), real garlic, two packages of chili seasoning (1 mild, 1 hot).  The extra salsa and extra crushed tomatoes made it a little soupier than I would have liked so next time I will hold back a little on both.

The only thing I did differently was I sauteed the onions, then added the garlic, then put in the meat and the chili seasoning so the meat could cook with the spices.  Then added everything else in and let it simmer.  I've tried it with ground beef and ground turkey.  Both were good, however I like the beef better.

It was a little sweet and I'm not sure where the sweetness is coming from.  I like a different tasting chili, but because this recipe is fast and easy it ends up winning.

Excellent simple chili recipe! Loved it, perfect seasoning in one chili season packet. No need to add any extra. To make mine a little sweet I added peach salsa instead of regular, yum! This will be my new go to chili recipe!

My son and I really enjoyed this one - although I must admit if you're not used to eating the beans and chili seasoning - don't be afraid to lighten up, the flavor was great - it's just a lot on your system if you're not used to it...  You could probably 1/2 all three of those items and be okay ;)  The taste really was great though!

Debdoozie - Thank you!!! This recipe won first place at my husband's company's chili cookoff today! I just browned the ground beef with the onions, then threw all of the ingredients into my slow cooker overnight on Low/10 hours.  I didn't even measure the ingredients, just threw in two 10oz cans of tomato sauce and a large jar of Pace salsa.  For the chili seasoning I used McCormicks Hot Chili seasoning (one packet).  Thanks SO much for this recipe, this is going into heavy rotation at our house!

This recipe is wonderful. I'm not a "Chili Purist", and I love EASY. When it's easy and delicious, it's a bonus.  I also substituted a 16 oz. jar of medium salsa, and a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes.  I used ground turkey, rather than beef, and one can kidney, and one can chili beans. It was such a hit!

This chili turned me into a cook! Or at least I felt like one. People LOVED it and couldn't believe I made it. It's got an incredible taste that makes it seem like it takes you hours to cook, and it's actually very easy.

When my friend gave me this recipe I thought she was crazy. It looked to easy to be as amazing as she said it was. Boy was I wrong. Best chilli I've ever had. I did add a large can of diced tomatoes just because we like them so much.

Loved this recipe!  It was simple, easy to prepare, and tasted great!  I used a homemade chili seasoning from this site instead of the packaged stuff.  My husband couldn't stop eating it.  Thanks!

The only chili my young kids have ever liked! My 5 year old daughter has asked for it again this week.  (They loved the sweet corn muffins recipe and crumbled it into their chili!)  My husband and I added Sriracha sauce to our own bowls to add some extra heat.

Very easy chili to make. I made it my own with these slight change: Lean chili meat browned and smoked outside on grill. Substitute two jars of Chili Starter instead of tomato sauce and chili seasoning mix. Slow cook in crockpot for three hours. Well worth 5 stars!!!!

Pretty good--I skipped the salsa because I didn't want it to be too spicy, but it was still quite delicious.  I'll probably make this again.

It really is delicious.  I didn't have sauce and salsa in those sizes, so I used 16 oz of salsa and just one 15 oz can of sauce.  It really is delicious.

Oh, I only used 1 pound of ground beef and Hubby didn't notice at all. :-D

This is the BEST chili!  I think those who rated it low added salsa instead of pace picante SAUCE.....depending how hot you like your chili, Pace comes anywhere from mild to hot.  I also slightly decreased the amount of beans.  And I also cook this one day ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge all night to really soak in the flavors.  I then put it in the crockpot about two hours before serving.  YUM - Thanks Deb!!!

- Used whole large onion instead of half, figuring I had no other use for it.  Worked out fine.
- Used relatively lean ground beef, but kept the grease in the chili.
- Used significantly more pepper and garlic, it was good but probably _not_ necessary.
- Used pure garlic powder instead of garlic salt because my store brand chili seasoning contains salt, unlike the williams brand used by the author.  *No additional salt was needed*
- Used 1 can (around 1.75 cups) of tomato sauce and a 15oz jar of medium-spice salsa (about the same total liquid but more of it from the salsa), because that was what was available.  Excellent.
- Used whole packet (just under 2x) chili seasoning.  It wasn't too much but was certainly more than necessary.
- Used the prescribed beans plus a can of black beans (was looking for pinquito/pinto but didn't find any) - was worried that the black bean would be too tough but it was great.
- Used pressure cooker - 15 psi for 20 minutes (starting from full pressure) and natural release.  Ended up spending forever trying to remove the stuck lid but it worked great, perfectly moist and tender.

I like a thick chili but was concerned, especially with my extra dry ingredients, that I'd too little liquid, but at least in the pressure cooker it was absolutely perfect - thick, but with enough liquid remaining to be a real chili (not chili-flavored-casserole or whatever)

FWIW my adjustments were mainly about convenience, habit, or nutrition-density - not necessity.

Made this last night on a whim. This hit the spot! I followed the recipe exactly, except that after putting in one can of beans, I decided not to add the second. It does not need that many beans! One can was the perfect amount. I topped mine with a dollop of sour cream, cheese, and Fritos. YUM! My fiance also loved it and said that it was better than his mother's (but don't tell her!).

Best chili i ever made and so simple!! Pace picante sauce was the most important to make this so flavorful. Canned Mexican flavored tomatoes if you don't have tomato sauce will give it extra kick! Just like Wendy's chili!

GREAT BASIC CHILI !
I am reminded of the story of the guy who was going to WIN the Texas Chili Cook-off when a competitor stopped the judges from giving him the award for BEST CHILI until they heard HOW he made the CHILI.
The guy DID NOT bring any ingredients, but visited EACH cook-off contestant and collected a sample and dumped them all in a pot. He had a great tasting chili ( best of the best).
So I took out my cook-books and highlighted all MY FAVORITE INGREDIENTS to add to my chili.
Chili is like pizza. ANY FAVORITE INGREDIENT can be added for layers of flavor.
I like Deddoozie's chili. I would for sure add some brown sugar and garlic in small amounts.
People who do not like beans can remove them and add sausage or steak chunks and/or chopped celery. Extra tomatoes and onion are always good too.

I made this almost exact.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and used a little more than 2 pounds of ground chuck.  I used my dutch oven and it turned out so good.  I love a thick chili like this. 2 thumbs up.

Calling this a "Blue Ribbon" Chili couldn't be more right! Great, great, great recipe. I actually ladeled some chili over nacho chips, topped with cheddar and put it under the broiler for a quick melt. It was a big hit during the big game!

Of course this all depends on what salsa and which chili spices  you use but if they are your favorites, your chili will be fantastic! This is one of the easiest, tastiest chili recipes that I've come across!

Delish!!! I couldn't stop eating it.  I am 6 months pregnant so I used the mild version of everything and so far so good... no heartburn.  I also used lean ground beef to cut the calories/fat and diced tomatoes instead of sauce I didn't miss a thing!

This chili had great flavor.  I made it vegetarian by using veggie crumbles.  I kept everything else the same.  I paired it with a green side salad.  Really good!  I will probably add some green peppers and tomato sauce next time.

This chili is so good! The consistency is just right...it's not too watery and not too thick.  Only thing I should have done differently: I used tomato sauce with green chiles and it came out too hot.  However, when I use regular tomato sauce next time, I think the flavor will really come out well.

This was great.  I used Pace HOT picante which got out of my hands so  instead of 8 oz it was more like 16 oz that got in the pot.  The taste was outstanding BUT the chili was SO HOT so next time I'll use Pace medium picante.  I also used chili beans instead of kidneys, which is my personal preference.  The taste was wonderful and I'll probably use this recipe as my main chili recipe from now on.  Super easy to make.

My husband asked me to make chili for tailgating at an Army/UCONN football game at West Point here in NY.  Everyone loved this!  It went very quickly!  I followed the advice of others and used 1 (10oz) can of diced tomatoes w/ green chile peppers, 1 jar corn, a little more than 1 (14oz) jar of tomato sauce, a half jar of chunky salsa (couldn't find Pace at my local grocery store), oregano, paprika, basil, and sugar, in addition to the pepper.  I used onion powder in place of the chopped onions and left out the beans, because my husband doesn't like chili with beans.  I browned the meat (half beef and half Johnsonville sausage) with some sauteed, finely-chopped garlic and put everything into my slow cooker on low overnight.  Oh, and I also mixed in a bit of cinnamon (just enough to compliment the meat) and also bacon bits.  Served it with shredded cheddar on the top.  They ate it all!  I didn't even get to try any, because the tailgaters had 2nds and 3rds!

We thought this was great, and we really LOVED how thick it was! I used the submitter's recommendation of using the Pace Picante Sauce (I used med.). Also, I used a whole onion, b/c we love onion and threw in some fresh minced garlic while browning the meat and onions. This was super easy to throw together. I topped ours with shredded cheddar and sour cream~YUM! This would be wonderful on hot dogs or chili cheese fries...a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I doubled this recipe w/o any changes, prepared as stated and cooked in a large crockpot. It turned out perfect. I've gone through many recipes looking for one that could be my "go-to."  My search is over. Thank you Deb for posting this delicious recipe.

I didn't believe Debdoozie when she said this would win at chili cookoffs at work, but I entered anyway.  How wrong I was!  First place, red chili category!

It's a wonderful chili that is so easy to make, tastes great, and you can easily spice it up as needed.  With two picky kids at home, we have no problem with them finishing their dinner with this chili.

I really doubt you'll be disappointed with this one.

Very good and simple to make. I browned the ground beef and sauted the onions then added everything to the crockpot.... I also added some fresh jalapenos diced and added to crock pot... One of the best chili recipes I have found in a long time. Will make again. My husband loved it!!!!!

This was delicious and so easy! I made it before my son's football game tonight and left the crock pot on low. By the time we got home from the game it was ready. I served it with a little shredded mexican cheese and a dollop of sour cream. I'll definitely be making this again, THANKS!!

Great recipe. I did use 16 oz jar of medium salsa and three cans of tomato sauce. To spice it up a bit I added a few dashes of hot sauce and hot pepper flakes. A freind of mine is a food and beverage director at a local restaurant and said I nailed this recipe. Thanks

Really good chili!  I changed it up a bit from the original recipe and it turned out great! I exchanged the beef for ground turkey, added a can of diced tomatoes, chopped green pepper, frozen corn, full chili season packet, and replaced kidney beens with 1 can each of black, pinto, and white kidney beans.  I made it for a camping trip and everyone was super happy :)

This was REALLY good.  I took the advice of other readers and added basil, oregano, sugar, paprika and garlic powder to the recipe.  I also used one can of stewed tomato's (and basil) and 1/2 cup tomato sauce (instead of 2 1/2 can sauce).  I used about 10 oz of salsa (instead of 8) and used 4 tbls of taco seasoning mix (instead of chili seasoning, because I didn't have any). After the meat was browned I put it in the crockpot for 2 and 1/2 hours.  Then I put the whole thing over pasta and sprinkled it with chedder cheese.  Amazing!!!

This is an AWESME - EASY chili!!  I've tried many different ones and this will definitely be my GO-TO chili from now on.

I didn't use the onion (dont like,) I used the whole chili seasoning mix packet and the "Hot" Pace Picante salsa because we like spicy at my house.  Topped it w/a dollop of sour cream and sprinkled some shredded cheese on top before serving.

If you're like me and not a wiz in the kitchen but are constantly looking for new (not too hard,) recipes to try - THIS IS THE 'CHILI' RECIPE FOR YOU!!  Trust me.

This Chili is the best!  My husband is a very picky eater and LOVES this Chili.  He compares it almost to the Wendy's Chili that he loves so much.  This is a favorite fall dish in our house.

WOW...The EASIEST & ABSOLUTE BEST CHILI I HAVE EVER HAD AND MADE!!!!  I threw this together in no time with ingredients I had on hand, and am SO impressed!!!!  Everyone LOVED it!  I doubled the recipe and used less chili powder and beans because of my elderly parents who live with me.  I had a really mild marinara sauce on hand and used that for the "tomato sauce", and I also used 1 can of rotel tomatoes w/ green chilies along with the Pace Picante Sauce, It was still fabulous and I can see that you can easily adapt this recipe to your taste or use it just as it....it couldn't be better!!!!  Thank you, Debdoozie!!!!!!!  This is my new permanent go-to chili recipe!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!!!

Would definitely make this again. For the salsa, I used pineapple-flavored salsa; initially a mistake at supermarket, but it turned out extremely well. We used standard chili seasoning sauce, and some masa flour at the end to make it a little more thick (not that the recipe without masa flour isn't thick). Will definitely make again when the weather turns cool again.

I've made this chili for a few years. My husband and daughter, now 9, LOVE it! The last time I made it, I added just 2-3 shakes of cumin without telling them. They both said it tasted better than ever! I thought so too.

We love this recipe! It's so easy to make or to customize. I prefer it with just 1 pound of beef and I usually make it with fresh garlic and more tomato stuff than in the recipe (tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, salsa). We use different bean combinations every time too. Black beans blend in quietly. A really great pantry stashbuster!

Fabulous!  We don't like beans, so i used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef and 1 lb hot sausage.  Also used a jar of picante along with the salsa, little bit more chili seasing (we like spice!)  Also did green peppers along with the onions and some celery.  Cooked it on low in the crockpot all day.  Best chili i've ever had...and sooo easy!

This is the absolute best chili recipe i've ever made. And everybody whose ever tried it, both home and at work rave about it. I almost feel like it's cheating, because it's so easy. Everybody alway fights over the leftovers the next day, so i easily double the recipe, well that is everything but the meat and it's still delish!

This chili was good, but I thought it was a little too pepper-y.  It came together very easily, though, which was nice.

Sadly I must admit my family and I were very disapointed with this chili recipe. It was extremely "sauce" heavy, I think it would have been better with a large can of sauce and a large can of crushed or diced tomatoes. The salsa was a nice touch, I also chose to add a can of shoepeg corn which was also a nice touch. All in all though I think I will keep searching for the "perfect" chili recipe.

I have never used another recipe since trying this one. I use my dad's homemade salsa which is spicy and adds a little extra kick. Even my kids eat it and everyone knows how hard they are to please. This goes great with a homemade sweet corn bread and a big glass of milk. PERFECT!!

Last year I got 3rd place with this recipe in a chili cookoff using mild salsa. I'm entering this recipe again in the Spicy category and will use the Pace medium salsa. Wish me luck!

So..I made this for hubby and kids for when I was at work (browned meat,onions,and garlic-then threw into crockpot on low)..they got home at 3:30 and it was reported gone at 5:00. WOW!! I made a few little changes (fresh garlic and less beans) but nothing to interfere with the integrity of this great recipe. Only big change I will make is to double the recipe next time =) Thanks so much!!

I'm not a big chili eater, but I was bored and wanted to try something other then poultry and steak recipes.   I followed the recipe pretty closely and found that it was a little bitter when I tasted it. I added the other half of that 1/2 of tomato sauce, a little adobo seasoning and a little honey.  After I did all of that my chili came out tasting EXACTLY like the chili they give you at Wendy's (mind you, that's the only chili i ever eat). I was really delighted by that. Made some cornbread muffins and white rice. Tomorrow, with the left overs, I think I'll make a taco salad. Great recipe! Easy too!

I'm not a big cook but we had a chili contest at work today so I used this recipe and it was the favorite.  I like the ease of the recipe and I made a few rookie changes to it.  I used 1 lb. of ground beef and 1 lb. of pork sausage.  I only used 1 3/4 cups of tomato sause (that was the size of the can) so I used 16 oz. of salsa.  Put is a little more garlic salt and some cajun seasoning.  It needed a bit more liquid so in goes a can of Bud Light.  I should have had another can today as a fair amount of liquid was absorbed overnight so water had to do today.  A little cayanne and it was complete.  $75- first prize is mine!!

I only used 1 lb of ground beef (my mistake).  I also used homemade salsa,  16 oz jar of my canned crushed tomatoes, 1 can sauce,  substituted chili beans for the dark red kidneys, and used 1 packet of chili seasoning (again, my mistake).  I also added some water for simmering (we like it a little soupy).  Didn't really change anything, just used what I had.  My husband declared it the best chili I have ever made!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I follow the recipe, but it was too salty for my taste, I ended up have to water it down and add more beans. It still turned out good.

Probably 4.5 stars.  VERY easy.  I accidentally put garlic powder instead of salt, so I'm sure that screwed it up a bit.  I added half a cup more paste, a little more salsa and chopped four small roma tomatos and added them, to make up for it.  I also added oregano.  SUPER good.  Especially over pasta.

I've made this twice & both times I've been really impressed with how good it is & how easy it is to make. I guess it's the salsa that makes the difference. Better the longer you cook it. I added a can of crushed tomatoes and 1 tablespoon of sugar, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

This is an excellent chili recipe.  Fantastic flavor and just enough spice.  The only change I made was to add about 3/4 cup of water so it wasn't quite as thick. Thank you for sharing :)

I modified the amount of liquid in this because I cooked it in a slow cooker. So, used 1/2 the tomato sauce and drained the beans.  Will try it on the stove top next.  I like spicy food, but use caution with the chili seasoning mix.  Depending on the hotness of your salsa, you may want to increase or decrease your seasoning amount.  Good recipe to start with, now I'll start tweaking it for our tastes.  Thank you!

Best chili recipe I've had and the only chili recipe I ever use. I've made this exactly as written but over the years I have tweaked it a bit.   I saute 3 cloves of chopped garlic and bell pepper along with the onions. I use one can kidney beans and one can pinto beans.  I use Herdez medium because I'm not a big fan of pace. Herdez is more authentic.  Topped with shredded cheddar, chopped jalapeños, sour cream and green onions.  
 Delish!

Absolutely wonderful--my husband's new fave for football season!  I modified it by putting the cooked ground beef and onion in our slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients and cooked it on low while I was at work.  It came out perfectly!

I followed the recipe as instructed and it ended up with a strong tomato flavor and it seemed like something was missing.  Maybe I did something wrong since most of the reviewers raved about it.  Good base, but I would need to tweak it a bit for my taste.

I was looking for a good all purpose chili recipe, and I found it right here. I was out of the chili seasoning mix so I used the Chili Seasoning II from this site. We also added a little green pepper and used chick peas for the beans. It was excellent, this once is a keeper.

Very good!!  Added a spoonful of sour creme and finely chopped scallions to each serving.  Will definitely make this recipe again.  The kids loved it..they are fussy.  I substituted the chili seasoning mix with allrecipes.com chili seasoning mix II (omitted flour).

My husband has been hounding me to make chili for ever it seems. I always thought it was a long and involved process, but this recipe was perfect! I used a whole onion instead of a half. I couldn't find any "chili seasoning mix" so I used chili pepper instead. I also added two handfuls of brown sugar and a splash of sweet red wine. I will definitely be making this again!!

Great recipe and unbelievably easy, but it tastes like it took all day to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and topped with white onions and shredded cheddar cheese.  This is so good I would not hesitate to take to a chili cook-off!

mmmmm delicious!  It was by far the most simple recipe for chili I've made, I usually go for the complicated ones with 20 ingredients but was feeling lazy.  I'm glad I was!  I'm using this one from now on.  The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 turkey italian sausage (hot), and I added an extra can of beans because I like thick chili.  It was a bit salty (even though I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt), so I think next time I will make my own chili seasoning mix with less sodium.  I can't wait to eat this tomorrow!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe, Deb.  UPDATE: I made it again with all ground turkey and no extra beans...I used homemade chili seasoning mix that I didn't put much salt in, and that remedied the salt problem.  Excellent and EASY!

I think this may be the best chili I have made over the years.  I used 1 pound sirloin and 1 pound ground turkey.  I used the Chili Seasoning Mix II on this site and the result was just delicious.  A real keeper.

My husband LOVED it. I made chili before and he didn't care for but this one he did. I left out the beans because we don't like it much and added some kernel corn and it's ready it way under an hour. Great recipe!

This is great chili. The only change I made was using some V-8 juice in place of the tomato sauce (it was about half sauce half juice). My family loved it, and I will most definitely be making this one again!

I really liked thje fact that this uses tomato sauce & not tomatoes because I do not like chunks of cooked tomatoes. I used a medium heat picante sauce (I prefer hot, but I was making it for a few people and didn't want to overwhlem them). I also doubled the recipe, and ran out of chili seasoning, so I substituted the remaining qty with just regular chili powder, and it seemed to work just fine.

Followed the recipe almost exactly.  Added a little more salsa than what was called for, but other than that didn't change a thing.  Served it over fritos and topped with shredded chedder cheese.  Great recipe .  Everybody loved it, will definately be making again.

This chili was amazing! The best I've ever made. I used pace picante salsa and added a can of mushrooms and a chopped green pepper just to up the veggie count. I halved the recipe and it was more then enough for 2 of us to eat plus have 2 days worth of leftovers. Definitely a keeper!

I've made this several times already with beef and it's so easy and delicious. Instead of garlic salt, I used kosher salt and real garlic.  I just tried this using ground turkey and forgot to put in the mccormicks chili packet and it still tastes great!

Best chili ever!!  My husband and I have been experimenting with a number of different chili recipes and this one is our favorite.  I recently tried it with using 1pd of beef and 1pd of ground turkey, and this has become our new favorite way for preparing it.  I also recently used the Hot Pace Picante Sauce.  It was a little too spicy for me, but my husband thought it was just right.  Great and easy recipe!!

This is the best chili recipe I have made from this site so far, and I have been using this site for seven years.  I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing if I were to remake it.  It was very easy to make and had a lot of flavor.

I threw everything into a crock pot after I browned the meat and onions. Let it cook for about 2 hours. Highly recommend this recipe. I sauteed jalapenos and grn/red bell peppers in olive oil with garlic and added it to the chili!

For some reason, I wasn't expecting good things from this recipe.  I couldn't believe the rave reviews I got.  I took this to work for a chili fundraiser.  It was gone in a flash and people kept telling me all day how great it was.  I used more salsa than the recipe called for and pinto beans in place of the light kidney beans.  Not only was the taste great, it was very attractive too.

I joined so I would be able to add my review. I won my work's chili cookoff this past Fri using this recipe.  I made some tweaks based upon other reviews.  Added fresh garlic, chopped red pepper, cinamon and 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.  It was delicious and it all went quickly!  Made it again today for my family.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved it! I did follow some of the other suggestions - I used 10 oz of diced tomatoes with chilies, an extra can of tomato sauce ( I like it saucy!), a little bit of sugar, and next time I will add more beans.

This was even a hit with my fussy 3 year old!  I used mild salsa and it was absolutely delicious.  I made my own chili seasoning because I couldn't find it at the store:  2 tbsp. chili powder 1 tbsp. seasoned salt 2 tsp. cumin 1 tsp. oregano 1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. onion powder 1/2 tsp. garlic powder  I added pureed sweet potatoes at the end (my son had no idea) and served it with brown rice -- made a really well balanced meal.

Very easy and very tasty. I substituted the ground beef for "ground beef" made out of veggie crumbles. I used two 12-ounce packages (typically found refrigerated in the produce department) and it turned out fantastic. The veggie crumbles don't need to "brown" for ten minutes, so begin by sauteing the onions for 6-8 minutes and then throw in the "ground beef." I also made the Blue Corn Cornbread recipe from this site to accompany- amazing!

This was just ok. I think I was expecting to much. It tasted way to tomato flavored, just not exactly what I was hoping for. It was not bad just not 5 stars that is for sure! Won't make again, though it was an easy recipe to make.

Delicious! I was skeptical of making this chili because of the few ingredients - it sounded too easy to be tasty. But I was pleasantly surprised. Here are some modifications I made: Used ground chicken instead of beef, used fresh chopped garlic and sprinkling of salt instead of garlic salt, added 1 t.coriander, 1/8 t. chili powder, 1/2 t. cumin and 1/4 t. red pepper flakes, added 1/4 chopped green pepper, used entire envelope of chili seasoning. I am so excited to have found this recipe and plan to make it on chilly winter nights in the future.

This is a solid dish and SUPER simple. I threw everything into the crockpot on high for 3 hours. I also used Morning Star veggie crumble and made is a low-fat vegan dish. Great.

This is very tasty and VERY easy.  It just may become my main chili recipe.  The salsa I used was pretty hot so I omitted the black pepper.  I also added chopped bell pepper and used one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans.  My guys loved it!

This is our favorite chili recipe.  I don't change anything and it comes out perfect every time!  We serve with corn bread and everyone spices it to taste at the table (habenero hot sauce).  Even my kids love this recipe and take it to school for lunches.

Delicous. Everyone in the family liked it. I wasn't sure what to use for the chili seasoning so I found a homemade recipe on this site (Chili Seasoning Mix II). Only used 1 can of beans. Used a little bit less salsa. Subbed tomato paste & water for some of the sauce. Really easy, tasty recipe that you can tweak with ingredients you have on hand.

This recipe is great because you can make it as mild or spicy as you like. It is so fast and easy. I usually throw it in a crock pot for a few hours and forget about it. My family loves it!

Thanks for the great recipe Deb. I accidentally poured an entire 16oz. bottle of pace picante hot salsa in instead of the recommended 8oz. jar, and it didn't make a difference in the taste. It's so easy too. Awesome!

Outstanding! I did a quick search for a chili recipe before heading out to the store and thought, how could this be so good with so little effort? I was 100% wrong! This is the EASIEST, Tastiest chili recipe ever. We actually used cubed london broil instead of ground beef and cooked it for an extra 30-45 mins. It was perfect! Can't wait for leftovers today! My husband and I are hooked!
Thanks for a great recipe Deb!

Not sure why this recipe gets rave reviews.  I followed it to a tee (but added cubed beef) and it wasn't flavorful at all.  So, I decided to add the following and it came out just perfect:  1 cup of strong brewed coffee, 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder, extra 8 oz of salsa, 1 tablespoon of ground cumin, 4 extra tablespoons of chili seasoning mix.  It makes a huge batch that only lasted our family 2 days.  I give the revised recipe 5 stars.

Just excellent! So simple, and so good.  I didn't give 5 stars because I modified slightly-  I substituted 4 TB chili powder and 1 tsp cumin for the chili seasoning.  I also added a few cloves of chopped garlic with the meat and onion.  Yum!

wow, I used this recipe as a base to enter my 1st chili cookoff... and I won 1st place!!! I changed a few things by adding more onion, fresh garlic, homemade salsa, beef broth (just to thin it out) and a ton more chili seasonings... but this recipe was the key.. truly a blue ribbon recipe.. thank you!!!

I've never made homemade chili before and we had a chili cookoff at church. When I saw how easy this recipe was, I decided to try it. Guess what? I won 1st place! Don't worry, I didn't take the credit and told everyone where I found the recipe. This was so easy that my 3 year helped me! Thanks!

Easy and very good!  I use different salsas to change the heat and add different dimensions. I fry a few batches of the the hamburger and onions ahead and freeze them.  When I need a quick "fresh" meal, I just thaw the hamburger in the micro and add the rest of the ingredients.  Fast and delicious.

GREAT! Easy to make and hubby said best chili I ever made! Only thing different I did was to add some of my own canned tomatoes, and a little extra chili seasoning. Thanks for this recipe, will be making again and again!

This chili is fabulous! My husband had three helpings and then devoured the leftovers the next day. I made the following alterations: I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and drained the fat, used half the onion the recipe called for, and used only one can of Mexican-style chili beans. This one is definitely a winner, and I have a feeling I'll have several requests for it this winter. Thanks Deb!

I've tried many chili recipes and everyone agreed this was the best.  I, too, added the 1 Tbsp. garlic.  It was great!  Thanks!

This chili tastes just like Wendy's. I'm serving it to my parents tonight for dinner at my new apartment. I actually baked a potato and then chopped it up and threw it in while it was simmering. It's an excellent addition. I made it last night and this morning it tasted even better. can't wait to eat it for dinner!

How can something so incredibly EASY, taste so DELICIOUS?!? I almost went for one of those complicated chili recipes but chose this one instead because I wanted something quick and I'm so glad I did! I used Hunt's plain tomato sauce. I doubled the salsa and used one of my favorite brands - medium Green Mountain Gringo salsa. I'm making it again this week!

This recipe was great!  I followed it almost to a T.  The only change I made was that I used a can of diced tomatoes and one whole onion instead of 1/2.  The flavor was excellent and the grand children ate the whole batch. (Even the 5 year old).  Thanks for a great quick recipe!

I used ground turkey instead of beef and took it to a potluck. Everyone loved it. This is one of the best chili recipes I've tried.

This is very easy, and very good chili!  I never would have thought of putting salsa in it, but it tastes great!  I used 2 teaspoons of chili powder, and it had a nice but not overwhelming kick. I think next time I will add one more can of beans, but other than that I was extremely satisfied!  Thanks!

Great chili, and so easy!  I won runner-up in a chili cook-off on Halloween! I put everything in the crock pot in the morning, and let it cook all day (8-9 hours) on low.  I used roasted garlic salsa, which added a great flavor.  I also added some extra tomato sauce.  
Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!  This will be my standard chili recipe from now on.

Husband loved it, so did everyone else.  I made the chili seasoning from this website under chili seasoning by Sal.    It was awesome.  I added one cup of chicken broth to the chili because it seemed so thick because my meat portion could have been a little over.  Cooked everything in slow cooker on low all day.  FAB!!!!

I love this chili recipe.  I use a spicy salsa and hot chili seasoning and it comes out just the way I like it.  Chili with a little kick!  I've made this a few times already and this is my go to recipe.  I was so proud of it I had to have some family and friends try it, lol.  All were impressed!

First let me say our whole family thinks this is the best chili ever. Made it several times as per recipe then I made these small changes that seemed to make a positive difference. The additions are a can of quality diced tomatoes and I take one can of red kidney beans and puree them in my small Ninja. It adds an amazing creaminess to the recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

I've never made chili before.  I made this to test a recipe for my boss because the supervisors were having a chili cookoff at work today for Super Bowl and she's uber-competitive but can't cook to save her life.  But this was great.  I made a mistake and only put 4 tsp of chili seasoning in instead of 4 Tbsp so I added more chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and cayenne to spice it up.  I also followed some other reviews and used a 14 oz can of tomato sauce, a can of Rotel, and subbed one can of kidney beans for chili beans.  Then my boss made it for today and added hot Italian sausage to it and she won!  I'll be making this again for sure!

Very thick and meaty chili.  Fabulous as is, or thinned with 1 can of petite diced tomatoes.  I also prefer to add 1/2 - 1 t. cumin.

Followed recipe as written and doubled it! Made this for a neighborhood chili cookoff and, true to the claims, it took 1st place! Everyone loved it! Best part - I had never made chili before! Will definitely keep this on my list of favorites - and it was SO easy!

I've been looking for a really good chili recipe for some time and I finally found it! This IS the EASIEST and BEST tasting chili I've made yet!! I followed the recipe except for a few changes, I added diced green pepper with the ground beef and onion. And as many suggested I added one large can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I also added one can of DelMonte diced tomatoes (garlic & onion with the liquid). I did use "Williams Original Chili seasoning" (found it on line), and "Pace" medium salsa. The only thing that wasn't clear to me in this recipe is if I should drain the beans or not. I decided to drain most of the liquid off before adding the beans. This recipe has been added to my favorite, and I will definitely be making it again and again. My search is over THANK YOU Deb!!!!!

I've been making this for a couple of years now and it is terrific.  Per other reviews, I brown the meat and onions, drain them and then throw everything into the crockpot and let it cook on low for around 8 hours.  Sometimes I substitute 1lb of ground turkey for 1lb of ground beef and the recipe still tastes great.

This is a very good recipe. I made it for my family and everyone had good things to say about it. I substituted lean turkey meat instead of regular ground beef and it worked out really well. This recipe can also be made in a crock-pot to if you’re a person who is on the go. Depending on the type of salsa you use, you’ll acquire a different taste. This recipe is great not only in the winter but year round if you’re a big fan of chili. In conclusion, this recipe definitely deserves 5 stars.

This was a great basic recipe.  Based on other reviews, I made the following changes.  I substituted a large can of Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes for the tomato sauce and a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies for the salsa.  I  also added a bottle of Fat Tire beer.  I used 3 Tablespoons of Chili 3000 from Penzeys and a couple shakes of cayenne pepper.   I served it with another recipe from Allrecipes;  Grandmothers Buttermilk Cornbread.  It was a fabulous meal!  Lots of depth of flavor.  My husband and I both loved it.

I made this with the Chili II seasoning mix recipe and my own homemade roasted tomato salsa and it is delicious!  I only used one can of beans since I like mine less bean-y and added in some corn.  Oh, and I used 1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 crushed tomatoes (home canned!).  YUM!

WOW this was great! It was our first time making chili and we were so pleased it turned out as good (or better) than mom's. Next time we will try turkey as the chili doesn't rely heavily on beef for flavor. We also used the Chili Seasoning Mix II found on this site.

Delicious! I added a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar.  Used diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and fresh tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  Really enjoyed it.

This recipe is fool proof!  Chili turned out similar to Wendy's but even better.   I added a can of Rotel, corn, a few cloves of garlic with the onions, gave an extra dash of onion and garlic powder, along with a teaspoon of sugar.  This recipe is awesome because you can adjust the heat by the salsa and chili powder you choose. This is the only chili recipe I'll use.  Thanks Deb for sharing this!

Loved the simplicity. Goes to show you don't need 50 ingredients to make a delicious chili. Fast, convenient, and good. I had to almost double the recipe since I was cooking for the house, and wanted leftovers. I also had to omit the chili seasoning since I had someone who doesn't like spicy foods (boo!).  I went real generous with some garlic powder since I love it so much. This was great!

Made this for my first time tonight. For my son who is craving home cooking which lacks at university! Our staple here in South Texas is Fiesta brand Quick Chili Mix. I like to let it sit over night to blend flavors. Went by recipe to the T. When done had a Tablespoon taste. WOW! This Chili is THE ONE! My usual for all my life is now tossed out. The Pace picante is definitely a great addition! His Thanksgiving holiday at home will start with a nice hot bowl of Chili! Thank You!

Great recipe! My daughter HATES chili and even she had a bowl. Only change I made was to add brown sugar.

This is the second time I made this basic chili for a competition and the second time I won.  I did make my own customizations to the recipe but I think it would have won anyway without my changes. I added 3 cloves crushed garlic to beef/onion mix. I used diced tomatoes instead of sauce to make a chunky chili.  I used 4 cans of the diced tomatoes and 2 cans diced green chilies. I used two cans of pinto beans and 1 can of red kidney beans. I made my own chili mix from a recipe on this site.  I added 2-4 T of maple syrup (I don't like sugar) which I think is important to cut the acid flavor in the tomatoes and I used 2 jars of salsa, one mild and one medium.  I added salt as needed, and it was needed. This filled my 6 quart crockpot.  One hour before the end of cooking time I added three diced bell peppers, one red, one yellow and one orange.  This makes it look beautiful and adds that winning touch!

Boyfriend and I loved it!  My alterations:  
I used a big can (24 oz) of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Used fresh minced garlic rather than garlic salt.  We used 2/3 of a 16 ounce jar of Pace Hot Picante salsa and a generic brand of hot chili seasoning.  Turned out great!  Ate it as soup the first day, and then had it over hot dogs and baked potatoes later on in the week!

I've made this two different ways; original as written which is awesome and easy!!! The second way was for a batch and a half. I added 1 lb Italian sausage, a can of black beans and the Pace Picante sauce I used was mild, so I added 1/8 tesp ground cayenne pepper. All other ingredients were the same with the amounts adjusted for 12 servings. RAVE reviews from everyone at the potluck that day and the pot was empty!

I had to pick a recipe for All Recipes All Stars that I enjoy preparing and switch the beef it calls for with Johnsonville Italian Sausage. This was my pick and I'm so glad I did it! It tasted great and disappeared in no time. I learned in the past that this recipe calls for too much beans for us, so I only use one can. But otherwise, we keep it the same. Will make again using both!

This is a perfect basic chili that can be adjusted according to your palate.  I will never make another chili!  I made it as written, no changes and served with jalapenos, hot sauce, cheese, and sr. cream.  This way people could add what they wanted to bump up the heat, but the kids could still eat the same soup.

When I make chili for my family this is the recipe I use. I double the recipe and make corn bread to go with it (for 7-8 people). I often get asked from my kids, "when are you going to make chili again?" I've used this recipe now for about a year. I make no changes to the recipe other than adjusting the seasonings to taste. My kids always go for seconds and thirds of this great recipe!

This chili was delicious!  I used the hot salsa and it did have quite a kick to it.  I had to add some extra beans to counter balance. We topped it with sour cream, onions and cheese.  Served it with cornbread.  I will definetly be making this recipe again!!!

I made recipe per the instructions and did not find it that spectacular.  However, when I added a bit of seasoned salt and a tablespoon of cocoa it was very good. Thanks for sharing the recipe Deb!  Sorry, I don't mean to be critical. :)

I just made this, it's simmering now, and my preliminary review is VERY GOOD!  I imagine it will only get better with time. Made as written using Spicy Chili Seasoning from AR, plus Perfect Pace Picante Sauce from food.com. I hate pace picante but since everyone raved about it in Deb's chili, I decided to give it a try. The recipe I found is a spot on duplicate, FYI. I'll likely never use it in anything else, but it's amazing in this chili. The only thing I might add is some diced jalapeño to brighten things up, but so far the chili is tasting really good. Thanks, Deb!

Simple and tasty! I love the use of salsa (you can pick a really good gourmet salsa if you like to experiment) and it adds great flavour. I usually make it with a can of dark red kidney beans and a can of baked beans. I have also been known to add a few carrots and a bit of spinach (pureed of course) to it so my kids would get their veggies in - the chili hides these wonderfully. I top it with grated cheese and a spoon of sour cream. The kids love it and my hubby adds his hot sauce and it still tastes great. Well done Debdoozie!!

This was great!! So tasty!

I added a few extras, that weren't called for, and it made it that much better:

Can of mushrooms
Can of Crushed tomatoes
1 green pepper - chopped
2 tbsp vinegar
3 tbsp chili powder

I will be making this again!

DEE-LISH-US. :)  My husband said it was the best chili that I've ever made...and then said, "actually, this may be the best chili I've ever eaten."  Kids loved it too.  I made the chili seasoning recipe "Chili Seasoning Mix II"  from the all-recipes site.

Sorry, it was too strong a flavor for me, too spicy, after I added a cup of water it was better, I needed water to go with that tomato sauce

My new favorite chilli recipe.  I added the whole pack of chilli mix and an additional tsp each of chilli powder and cumin.  This is probably because I used a 28oz can of sauce. Delicious

my kids loved this chili and ask for it all the time now. I'm always throwing in all different kinds of beans but other than that I keep it the same. Too easy and good to alter anything.

I really enjoyed this!  This is the best home-made chili I've ever made.  And it was soooo simple to make.  The only thing I had a problem with was the american measurements (I'm from Toronto, Canada), so I just added: 1 large jar of salsa, 1 jar of tomato sauce (spaghetti sauce) and 1 full can of stewed tomatoes.  I also added a packet and a third of chili powder, since I added much more sauce than suggested.  I also diced some green and red pepper and added it to the mix.

I love chili and have tried numerous recipes.  This one is so-so.  I followed directions except didn't use the brand name chili seasoning the original poster suggested.  I did use the salsa she suggested though.  It came out ok, but nothing spectacular.

Very good chili.  Love the quick and easy recipe.  Proves you don't need tons of ingredients to have a tasty chili.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because I do prefer my chili to have a sweeter sauce, so I added a couple tbl.s of sugar. Otherwise excellent.

This recipe is EXCELLENT! Perfect blend of flavor.  Beats any canned chili I've tried. I wouldn't add or subtract anything. My only suggestion for those who don't like "Spicy" is that they buy mild chili seasoning. I brought a brand that didn't specify whether it was hot, medium or mild and our chili turned out to be quite HOT. I love this recipe and my husband is already asking me to make more and freeze it for his lunches. Yummy!!!!

I was a first time chili maker.  This was an easy way to make chili.  Although I used black beans that i had soaked myself. I used homemade salsa.  Next time i want to try it with turkey.  It was awesome.  we loved it.

Perfect Chili, everyone loved it!
I actually used 1 lb Elk ground + 1 lb ground beef, and 1 whole onion and more chili spice... it was awesome!  Thank you for the delicious keeper of a recipe :)

Recipe I've been using for years, add green chili for flavor.  You must live in the Northeast.  Chili is a southwest dish.  No one in the Southwest would use kidney beans in chili.  Otherwise a very good recipe.

Great recipe. I can't stand beans, so I cooked up some elbow macaroni to make it a "chili mac" instead. I use Pace picante sauce (medium) instead of salsa.

So good! When I "need to have chili tonight" but don't have the time to use my own time consuming recipe, this is what I use. I added diced green pepper and some diced garlic as suggested by others. Topped with cheese, japs, and sour cream, my Tostitos have never tasted so good! Thanks Deb!

Fantastic recipe.  I've made it twice, and it was great both times. I did substitute one pound of ground beef for a pound of hot Italian sausage.

Outstading! Just what I was looking for, nice & simple, everyone loved it! This will be my  'go to' chili recipe from now on. Used a recipe from this site for the chili mix (will use that again too) , will decrease red pepper next time just so everyone with senitive tongues can enjoy also. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I made this chili and followed the recipe to a T for the first time two weeks ago. I had been following another recipe for years but when I saw this recipe and its rave reviews I decided to give it a try. I won't go back to my old recipe now, and I am making this very chili for the second time as I am writing this review. Absolutely amazing taste!

Fantastic. I added diced bell peppers, and a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with chili seasoning and green chilies--but you could add any veggies as you like. Will definitely make again.

This chili was wonderful!  We followed the instructions exactly, and it was a hit.  The only change that I will make next time will be to add more liquid.  It was very thick and hearty.  :)  Thank you for sharing!

These was very easy and very good.  I followed the directions exactly.  I drained the beans, but would not do that next time.  It's a very thick, hearty chili that I think needs the liquid.  I will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  I made for a Birthday Party and had lots of people comment how good the Chili was.  Next time I think I would only do 1 can of beans instead of two just because I personally thought it was too many beans, but it that didn't change my rating at all.

I love this chili! I made it for my co-workers and they devoured it. My family loves it too! I did add red/green bell peppers, the entire can of tomato sauce, pinto beans, and a dash of salt! I also use McCormick Original and Mild chili seasoning! It's easy and has a nice kick with lots of flavor!

I've tried numerous chili recipes. This is now my go to chili recipe. My family says the best they've ever had. The Chili Seasoning Mix II is easy to mix, and will be kept on hand. I plan on making some of the Chili Seasoning mix and put in containers to give with this recipe and a dutch oven for a couple of Christmas gifts!

Delicious! Best chili! I only added one can of tomato sauce and used 3lbs of lean ground beef. I also used two packets of chili seasoning and added extra seasonings as well of paprika and garlic. I also added chopped green peppers. I served with sour cream and chedder cheese on top!

I give this 4 stars only because it is missing that little kick that you get...maybe cumin?  But it was darn easy and darn fast, and I thought it was really good.  Will be putting this in rotation at my house.

I didnt win any awards with this one but I was told it was the best chili in the place. They changed it up and gave out awards to the people who's chili wasnt gone after the tasting. This one was the first one to disappear. This will definately be my new go to recipe. The only change I made was to use ground turkey in place of the beef. It was still AWESOME! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great chili. The boyfriend dubbed it "delicious." I halved the recipe because I only had about a lb of ground beef thawed. The only ingredients I didn't have were the tomato sauce (used about 1 3/4 cups) and the seasoning mix (because I accidentally threw in three tablespoons before realizing I meant to halve it :). I didn't have chili seasoning on hand so I subbed in taco seasoning and it was still really tasty. I like my chili on the hotter side so I added some chili powder and red pepper flakes. Good stuff - will definitely make this again!

Very good flavor.  Note that this is a very "meaty" chili - when you look at it, you see the meat and beans here and there.  I would definitely add an additional can of beans, perhaps even two.

i love this recipe! thank you so much deb. i modified it just a little by adding small chunks of tenderized chuck roast and some smoked bacon. i also used tomato sauce that was herb'ed up with garlic, basil, and oregano. i participated in my very first chili contest today with this modified version and was just 5 pts away from getting first place amongst over 20 hardcore contestants. my pot of chili was the first to go, eaten up in less than 20 minutes. for a first-time chili maker and contestant, that's not too shabby! i absolutely trust deb's recipe.

WOW this recipe is great! I see why it wins awards, it was so flavorful and easily customizable. I used ground turkey to cut the fat, and medium Pace Picante salsa. I recommend adding the chili spice in slowly and tasting as you go because the only brand available to me was POTENT! Cant wait to make this again!

Excellent chili and easy to make!! I browned meat and onions the night before, then, added all ingredients in crockpot in AM and came home to yummy dinner!! I used one can of sauce and one can of dice tomatoes. (It didn't come out soupy but had a little bit of liquid...which we like.) I also made my own chili seasoning (b/c I forgot it at the store). I used the Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site but without the flour and did not use the dried onion or garlic (I put both in the ground beef). I also did not add very much red pepper since I have 2 small kids and didn't want it too spicy! This was a great Halloween evening meal!! Thanks!!

This was delicious! I did change a few things. I used 1 lb. ground turkey, 1 can light red pinto beans and one dark, 1 can of chili beans, I can of diced tomatoes with spices, a packet of chili seasoning, and added a whole onion and lots of garlic. Oh and the cup of salsa. The extra spices in the beans and tomatoes made it pretty spicy but it was still delicious, thick and flavorful!

Wish I could give this more stars than just 5...I've never made chili before (I'm 25 and just recently married so I'm experimenting more with different stuff).  I'm not a huge fan of chili, but I won my office chili cookoff out of 17 different chilis that were entered.  I added some extras, but followed the recipe for the most part.  If you like it a little spicier then I siggest adding a half can of the Rotel HOT and alot of extra cayenne, chili powder, and the chili seasoning packet.  I also cut up Cajun Andouille sausage and everyone seemed to like that.  This is a great recipe though and it is very impressive if you want to show off a little.

This is the best chili recipe I've ever found.  Added a little salt, some corn and some hot sauce to it and cooked in the slow cooker for 4-5 hours on low.  Tasty, good full taste that you expect a chili should have.

I come from a family of chili connoisseurs, and I was looking for a recipe that would be fast and easy to make that would still fool my taste buds into believing it was slow-stewed magic. I have to say that this recipe got me to that place - you definitely have to be aware of the salsa you're using and maybe add in a couple of your favorite spicy peppers, but this is definitely a great launching point!!

We *love* this chili!  The only things I change are to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and ground turkey instead of beef.  I make my own chili seasoning instead of commercial packets.  I have doubled, tripled, and even quadrupled this recipe to serve large crowds of teenagers, and men watching football.  Everyone raves.  Can't understand the folks who didn't like it.  And it's so easy!  It's been a lifesaver when it's my turn to host Teen Lunch :)

I absolutely love this recipe! I've been obsessed with my mom's chili recipe for years, but I truly think this one tops it. I add an extra can of tomato sauce. Also, I use two different chili seasonings - an original and a mild (this seems to add a little more spice and a lot more flavor). Fabulous recipe and super easy!

Very good chili! I make my own chili seasoning and use store brand picante salsa.  This chili won 1st place at my church chili cook-off. It has a resemblance to Wendy's chili.

very easy to make. I'm not a chili fan, but hubby says it tastes great. He suggested adding some green peppers next time for "filler" - although it's already a thick chili, there's a LOT of meat in it.

This is the same recipe my Mom gave me 20+ yrs ago, it's easy and fantastic...I do tend to add more Chili seasoning than the recipe calls for (any brand is fine).  I also add some Chili Powder.  Love to top this chili with Light Sour Cream, chopped onion, shredded cheddar and Fritos (or Saltines).........YUMMMY!

I used Picante sauce as suggested by the woman who submitted this recipe.  I used 1 can dark kidney beans and 1 can seasoned black beans (both with their juices) as that is what I had on hand.  After I browned the meat with onion I added everything to the crockpot.  I had to add another whole packet of chili seasoning half way through cooking as it was pretty bland.   The final result was really good.  Will likely make again.

I just love this recipe! I love that it calls for salsa and two different style of beans. It tastes great and looks great and it's easy to make. This is one of the very few recipes that I felt was great as is. The only thing I do differently is I cook it in a crockpot with slow cooker chili seasoning.

We found it to be rather blah. I added lots of cumin and chili powder.

This was amazing! My husband who is very picky loved it and asked me to make it again in the future. Very simple to make. The only thing i changed in this recipe was i used low to no sodium sauce and seasoning, you couldn't tell the difference. This is a keeper for me for sure.

Made this for a family gathering and used medium salsa and it was a hit! Everybody was telling me how awesome it was. Husband told me this is the new chili recipe LOL. A lil spicy for my moms taste with the medium salsa but she tastes even the slightest hint of spice in food. Love it!

This was a very good chili! The only things I did outside the recipe was seasoning the ground beef with some cayenne and cumin, and adding 2 fresh jalapenos along with the onions for extra spice.  I also added a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar to the chili mixture!  It was wonderful!

I think my chili quest might be over!  I used about 1.5 lbs. ground beef and 1 lb. ground turkey.  I opted for mild salsa because my two year old is in a stage where he thinks even cookies are "spicy" for some weird reason, but added a few liberal splashes of Texas Pete to my bowl before eating.  I added some additional garlic powder, chili powder, etc., as the one spice packet didn't quite give it enough kick (but I used extra meat).  I also didn't know whether or not to drain the beans, as it doesn't say in the directions.  I did NOT drain them, but next time I will.  This is a versatile chili, and I can envision adding lots of extra veggies, lentils, grains, or other meat "stretchers" which would take this meal even farther.  I thought salsa in chili sounded so weird, but I'm glad I tried it!  As it was cooking, I didn't think it was all that spectacular, but after about an hour of simmering (and the extra spices), this really came together.  Everyone gobbled it down.  We served it with a choice of tortilla chips, cornbread, saltine crackers, sharp cheddar, and sour cream.  Soooo yummy I can't wait to get hungry again! :)  My only changes next time would be to use my own spice blend, as I try to stay away from the packet version of things like that (but in a pinch, it was still good!)

This is the best chili recipe ever.  The only thing I changed was I didn't add the beans because my family doesn't care for beans.  This chili is amazing.  I used another user's suggestion of Pace Picante Salsa.  I debated between medium and mild and went with medium.  It gave the chili hotness but not too much.  You won't need another chili recipe after trying this one.  Thanks for sharing!

For a fast chili recipe this is really good! I made it on Halloween and everyone really liked it! I used Pace picante salsa but will probably use a different one next time.  I prefer homeade....Thank you for sharing this! I will most definitely make it again!

Love - Ideal for a single girl cooking a tight budget!  Perfect to make on a Sunday for football games then re-heat leftovers during the week!  The only change I made was to add a can of pinto beans and a bit more tomato sauce.

This was a winner!  I used Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site (fabulous) instead of the premade stuff.  Even my non-loving chili eater liked it:)  Thanks for my new go-to recipe.

I have made this twice now. The first time I made exactly as the recipe called for. The second time I was making it for a crowd and was concerned about the spice level so I excluded the garlic salt and black pepper. I made my own chili seasoning mix from another recipe on this website which may have made the difference in the needed seasoning. Got rave reviews both times and will never make chili any other way. I used Costco's medium organic salsa. YUM!

This chili recipe is really good. We have a family of seven, so trying to make something for dinner that everyone likes, is almost impossible. Not with this recipe. I always double the recipe for left over, and use the pace chunky salsa. I mix half of a medium one and half of a hot one. I also make my own chili seasoning mix, which makes a big difference.

This was so simple, only thing I could not find was the chili seasoming mix, that Deb reccommended.  I used some McCormicks, mix along with some that I made from the chili spice recipe on this site. I think next time I will only use the homemade mixture, not the package mix.  Thanks for the easy recipe

This was very yummy.  I halfed the recipe, also added green pepper, forgot garlic salt, used crushed tomatos.  I used a recipe on here for the seasoning called Chili Seasoning Mix II.

Super-duper! I was a bit skeptical because it seemed so simple, but Wow!! The taste was perfect, probably the best chili I've ever eaten.  Even the pickier eaters in the family wolfed it down and said how good it was.  This one's a keeper. Thank you Deb ! :-)

This is actually the recipe my father has used for years. However, I have made my own changes that I thought I would list here.  I love spicy chili so I substitute one lb of the hamburger for one lb of hot sausage, I have never really cared for kidney beans so instead I use one can of hot chili beans and one can of mild chili beans and I swear by the generic chili beans you can buy at Save-a-lot!  I also use one can of Rotel tomato and green chillies and one can of diced fire roasted tomatoes and this is in addition to the salsa.  I have won a few contests with this recipe and everyone loves it!  Have fun and add whatever you want!

Great basic chili, and ridiculously easy! I used one can of dark kidney beans and one can of pinto beans. I also added a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes & green chiles, 1/2 a can of yellow corn, extra garlic, and used hot chili seasoning mix.   It would be TOUGH to mess up this recipe! Give it a shot! My man took a double batch to a party at work and didn't have ANY left to bring home. Thanks Deb!

Delicious! This is the BEST chili recipe. My husband and I just prepared this chili to take camping with us. After reading the other reviews, I would have to agree that this would be an easy recipe to tweak and make it your own- spicier or not. Thanks for this recipe!

This worked out well. I like the ability to control the heat based on the type of salsa used. Very tasty, good chili base flavor. Will make again.

Had I not read the reviews first, I'd never have made this. Thank God I did. Everyone I shared it with wanted the recipe, they LOVED it too! I added 1 large whole onion and celery, simply because I love them in Chili. Also added 1can of chopped tomatoes. No one could get enough of it.  Thanks, Deb.

I use pasatta in place of the  2 1/2 cups of "tomato sauce" as stated in the recipe. (I'm Australian, and tomato sauce means the sauce you put on hot dogs or ketchup!)

I chose this recipe because it looked like it would be the quickest and easiest--and it was voted 3rd place out of 18 chilis!  I used 16 oz of salsa and a bit more tomato sauce than called for, with Tex-Mex chili seasoning. Yum!!

This was the first time I made chili, the only changes I made to it was I didn't put the jar salsa and I adding some more garlic just because I love garlic.

Very good recipe as is and it got 5 stars for that. I tailored it to my likings though and added a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes , 1 tbl spoon of cumin and a couple of really finely diced hot peppers.   Oh , I also added 8 oz of hot salsa sauce as suggested.  Great recipe thanks !!!

Excellent recipe! I have made it twice now, and while its very good the day its made, its even better the next day! I drained my beans before adding them. I also like to add extra garlic powder and cumin to taste. If you can't find light kidney beans, substitute chili beans. I added a half can of Rotel tomatoes/peppers last time and it gave a nice kick. This is my new go-to chili recipe.

I will never use another recipe for chili again.  This was really good.  Sharp cheddar cheese and a little sour cream on top.   I also used a medium salsa and it was just the right amount of heat for us.  Great recipe.

This is really good chili! I never had it with salsa, but it tastes great! Whenever I make this there are never any leftovers. I hate to say it, but this chili is far better than my grandmas! I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than I didn't have any chili seasoning so I just used chili powder. It was spicy, but still very good. Thanks so much!

This got rave reviews from my hubby's poker pals tonight.  I used the Chili Seasoning Mix II for the seasoning and medium Pace Picante sauce.  It was pretty spicy for me, but the men loved it.  They said it's a keeper.  :)

I am a total novice and I made this recipe.  It came out great.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and made a few minor adjustments based on the advice of my partner so that I could use the turkey.  We were both really pleased.

Wow, this was good. I made the chili seasoning but didn't use the full 4 tbl. good thing it was more than spicy enough. Added a jalapeno as well. Instead of kidney beans I used a can of baked beans. My husband doesn't like beans.

Ive made this chili probably 50 times if not more. Its hands down the best chili recipe Ive come across. I started out following the recipe to the letter. As I got comfortable with it, which didnt take long because its as easy as they get, I started altering the ingredients and whatnot to suit my taste or mood or budget, whatever. This one is pretty hard to screw up. It just tastes good no matter what you do to it. I even had a vegetarian version that I made for a while that the most manliest of men enjoyed. I get rave reviews every time I make this stuff. Seriously, this recipe belongs in everyone's arsenal.

This recipe was so easy, and the rewards were great. Just a zesty, tasty, red chili. We grated cheddar for sprinkling on top. A dollop of sour cream would have been tasty, too.

Everyone loves this recipe. The nice thing is that you can make it as mild or hot as you like, and it still tastes great. It is a fast meal when you have a time crunch. I make it and put it in the crockpot on warm for nights that I have to work. There is never any left for me.

Great, made for a potluck and got many compliments.  Used Lawry's chili seasoning since we couldn't find Williams, (as Deb noted in her review) and Med. Pace Picante.  Next time will probably add fresh garlic.  Great over a baked potato!!

Excellent! I made a few changes: increased salsa to 16 oz jar medium chunky style, 1 full packet chili-o mix, and 1 small can V-8 juice. Used slow cooker and cooked on high for 1 hr, then reduced to low and cooked all afternoon stirring occasionally. Very pleased with result! Leftovers made great chili spaghetti.

This is my first time making this and boy am i impressed! My boyfriend has actually never had homemade chili before and he about had a heart attack trying to tell me how great it was! I made exactly as stated except i added a clove of minced garlic and a little extra chili powder. Im gonna look into chili competitions because this one is a winner! So easy to make and it tastes exactly the way chili should. Thank you, i will definitely make again! =]

Just made this using 16 oz of Herdez Hot salsa (product of Mexico) and the Chili Seasoning II recipe from this site.  Best chili I've ever made!  It was spicy enough for me (and I also love the Habanero Hellfire chili recipe from this site), but mild enough for the wife (who gave up on the Hellfire chili after a single bowl).  We made Grandmother's buttermilk cornbread (also from this site) to serve with this.  For now on this is the recipe I'll be using for chili!

the way a person likes thier chili is very different from one individual to another, I think. But this is a great simple recipe. I've made lots of chili recipes, and I find the complicated ones just aren't worth the time at all. The only thing lacking is diced tomatoes, but I made the recipe exactly - figuring I could change it once I tasted it. But it doesn't need any changes, I really like it without the tomatoes. I used Pace salsa (will try a better brand next time, I'm not a fan of Pace, but figured I should stick to the recipe) and McCormick Chili seasoning. I'll be making this in the crock pot frequently this winter!

Now I love making chili!!  This is so easy to throw together, that I make quadruple batches and put it in the freezer for my husband to take to work.  I've taken it to family gatherings and been asked for the recipe.  We serve it with a dollop of sour cream and some shredded cheddar.  Yum!  Great served with camp cornbread.

This was so  good.    I used a hot salsa and hot chili seasoning and it was really spicy (and delicious).  Used just a pound of ground turkey and simmered for a really long time as I love me some thick chili.  Fed this to the picky boy who had never had chili before (!) and he loved it.  I'm going to make it again soon, but instead of using ground turkey I'm thinking of dicing a pound of portobello mushrooms and throwing them in when I simmer.

This is a perfect chili recipe and exactly what I was looking for.  My kids LOVE chili and will eat it every night. I try to feed them (somewhat) healthy, so I was not feeling good about giving them canned. You can throw this together so quickly! I made it with the chili seasoning II from this site and fresh pico de gallo. Next time I make it, I'll double it and freeze the other half. A side note-I looked at my last can, and the chili I was serving had 23 ingredients, many I couldn't pronounce! Now I can make it fresh, healthy and delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

This has been my only chili recipe for the last year. It is so quick and easy to make, and everyone loves it! If I am feeding more people, I throw in a few extra cans of beans, and I always add a can of corn, but otherwise, I follow the recipe as written and it always comes out perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent, I did add a can of diced tomatoes for a chunkier chili, and I used two McCormick's chili packets for more flavor, but this is your basic no frills, really good chili!

This is fabulous chili. I will never use a different recipe. I used Pace picante sauce as suggested by the writer but I couldn't find Williams Chili mix so I used Lawrys.

mmm...yum, this was so good. I think this was the best chili I've ever had, and I'm not usually a fan of chili.

Recipe was delicious as is. Will take the place of my slow cooker recipe. Didn't seem spicy at first, but did as we continued to eat. Used 3 tbsp med/hot chili powder (Penzey's).

I used ground turkey and minced garlic instead of powder and it turned out really good! It was for a Superbowl party and we made chili cheese fries. I baked the frozen crinkle cut fries and used the cheese sauce in the jar that's mixed with salsa and sour cream on the side...yum! It was so easy too.

I gave this 4 stars based on being a great starting point, but I think the yummy factor really depends on the type of salsa and chili seasoning you use.  Whatever combo I used was yummy.  However, I did doctor it up with a variety of spices to add some heat. I think next time I will blend some chipotle chiles and mix it with an additional can of tomato sauce instead of the salsa though.  I wanted more flavor and more of a kick.  Anyway, this is how I served it:  I baked potatoes, cut them in half, and carved out a bit of the middle.  Then I filled the potatoes with chili and covered it with cheddar cheese and green onions. I plopped the potatoe on a hearty  ladel full of chili on a plate, and then sprinkled a good handful of fritos on top. I had sour cream and jalepenos on the side as extras.  This meal was gobbled up.  5 stars all around from my mom, dad, and husband.

Delicious!  I followed the directions exactly. Tastes very much like Wendy's Chili. I used McCormicks Original Chili Seasoning Mix in the envelope. One envelope is exactly 4 Tablespoons. I also used Mild Chunky Salsa.  The chili still had a little kick to it.

This chili is delicious.  We just ate it for our Super Bowl dinner, along with cheddar & jalapeno bread, & the usual chili toppings.  I added chopped poblano peppers along with a couple cups of water while cooking.  I used a combination of pinto & kidney beans.  I started it on the stove then transferred it to the slow cooker on low for about five hours.  Thanks, Deb!

I have been looking for a good, easy chili recipe and this one rocks!  I doubled it, and used 2 cans of dice tomates plus 3 cans of 8 oz. tomato sauce. I also added red and green bell peppers. I put it together as instructed,  simmered on the stove, and then put it in the crockpot on low while we were at church...came home to the best chili I have ever had! My husband raved, I think we have a keeper here!

Yesterday was having company for dinner and cards, looked for an easy chili recipe and chose this one having read the reviews. Scaled it up a bit as I wanted to be left with some for today, I think there's some kind of football event on this afternoon. lol As had been noted by others easy to substitute a bit based on what's on hand, but I tried to stay close or I'm not actually making this recipe am I and then why offer a review or comments? Anyway, I used a 14 0z. can each of light red kidney , pinto and chili beans, ( a mix). Used Scarpone's Strained Tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce, also used Herdez mild salsa and added a small can of diced mild green chili's and one of salsa verde. If this was just for me I would have used a spicier salsa, but laid off doing so, not knowing my guests tolerance for heat. Therefore, offered assorted hot sauces on the table. Served over rice, and the ladies brought a nice salad, assorted buns and squares and sorbet for dessert. The ladies all loved this and said so, and then proceeded to kick my butt at cards. Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good and simple!  I had everything on hand.  I added about a can of V8 because I like my chili a little soupier.  Even with that it was still pretty thick.  Thanks!

This was great!!  I did a couple things different though, 1st I used 1lb of ground chuck/round,and 1 lb of hot breakfast sausage.  I also added a diced green pepper and an onion for a little extra flavor and some color.  I added some diced tomatos as well, then when serving topped with some shredded Chedar cheese.  It went over great.  Thanks deb.

I have 5 people in my family and I doubled this recipe.  It was gone in two days!  I even took some to work and shared with a coworker. I got an email after he ate it saying that it was the best chili he had ever eaten!  This was great chili!!  I made homemade cornbread to serve with it.

I have made this a few times now and I pretty much follow this recipe as is. I crack the pepper right in the mix i dont measure.. My husband really like his food hot and spicy and he was really pleased. Also made this for company and got rave reviews all around. I make this with cornbread and add some fresh cut chives and shredded cheese on top before serving. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good! I only put 1lb meat in it but rest according to the recipe. It was a really good chili, and with not very much effort! I looked up some other chili recipes on the site, and they ask for like 200 ingredients.. why do that when you can do this one with no hassle? I added some corn to it and husband ate 2 bowls of it

This was the best chili I've ever made - I had some friends over for a party, and the only problem was - I didn't anticipate everyone going back for 2nd & 3rd helpings, and so we nearly ran out.  Some of the changes I made: I added a can of diced tomatoes (drained), 1 TBS. of minced garlic, a couple dashes of hot pepper sauce, and I had to make my own chili seasoning mix because I didn't have any.  I found a great mix recipe on this site that included flour, basil, salt, pepper, paprika, white & brown sugar, oregano, cumin & crushed red pepper - and made my own instead of using a store-bought chili seasoning.  Otherwise, there was really nothing that I changed.  I think the salsa is the key to this recipe.  It was wonderful, and I will use this every time I make chili.  Thank you!

Wow, even a newbee like me could make tasty chili. My husband and daugter always complain my chili is too bland, so they were ready to get the chili powder and pepper out, well, I told them to try it before they sprinkled anything on it, no one used any spices. What I did was use a 3/4 package of "hot chili spices" the kind that's pre-made from the store. You won't regret using this. We put a slice of american cheese in it right before we ate it in our bowl.

Super easy.  Super quick.  I took some leftovers to work for lunch and shared with a co-worker.  For the rest of the week, he kept talking about it.  One evening, he called me at home asking me for the recipe.  I pointed him here.  He made it that night!  When I made this recipe, I used a mild salsa so everyone in the family could eat it.  I probably could have used a medium salsa.  I also added chick peas.  I'll probably do with them next time.  Thanks.

This chili is delicious! I was looking for a chili close to mine, but that had the little extra something I was missing. Salsa and Williams seasoning was it! I halved the meat (used 1 pack veggie crumbles) and used 1 pack of Williams seasoning. I further followed Deb's advice and used 8 oz of Pace Picante Sauce, medium. Instead of 2.5 cups tomato sauce, I used 1 can tomato sauce and 1 can diced tomatoes, pinto in place of kidney beans, and some garlic. These were minor changes and the recipe is just about foolproof! I highly recommend making this yummy chili - tweaked or not! And of course, like most chilis, this is even better the day after. Thanks for the wonderful recipe Deb!

I tried this recipe because I needed a simple recipe w/out too many ingredients for my son's boy scout campout.  I made a test batch at home and thought it was really tasty; for his campout, he cooked the beef and onions first, then drained and cooled it, and mixed w/ salsa so he wouldn't have to take a glass jar camping.  Then at camp, he mixed the meat w/ the other ingredients and simmered for a while.  Well, his chili pleased his patrol very much (they ate it w/ Fritos scoops, grated cheddar, and sour cream.  Then the older scouts and the grownups came over to get in on the action!  This is a great kid-friendly recipe -- you can adjust the heat w/ your choice of salsa and chili seasoning.  We used Safeway Select Chipotle Salsa (and I added some ground chipotle powder to the batch I made for my family).  This recipe is a keeper!

It's delicious! I halved the recipe for myself so I could have leftovers. It's also great on a college budget. :) I added a little bit more onion than called for, but followed the rest of the recipe. If it gets too thick at the end you can add a tiny bit of water and it goes back to normal. I will make this again in the future for sure!

Suprisingly good for what this is consisted of. I cut htis in half and I had some odds and ends in the pantry to use (a foil pouch of salsa from a taco dinner kit, a half pkg of taco seasoning I found in the cabinet) and this put them to perfect use. This had a little heat to it, but it was medium sweat. Excellent use of pantry items and made a great chili so easily! Thanks Deb, this was really decent chili.

Warning!  If you like your chili spicy, this is the recipe for you.  I enjoyed this chili the way I prepared it, but would have found it too hot if I had made it exactly as written.  I cut the amount of ground black pepper in half and used mild Pace Picante Sauce instead of medium or hot.  Be sure to read Deb's additional advice (currently listed as the most helpful review) in which she recommends using Williams Chili Seasoning and Pace Picante Sauce.  This is a great recipe that you can easily tweak to suit your own taste.  Thanks Deb.

This was fabulous..the best and easiest chili I have ever made! Based on other reviews I of course had some additions. While browning the meat, I added a whole onion with some garlic. To the chili, I added 1 can (15oz) of pinto beans, a whole (16oz) jar of salsa, and 1 (15oz) can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. To spice it up, I added ceyenne pepper, oregano, basil, and brown sugar. My coworkers all raved!

Even my 7 yr old ate this!  I coupled it with the "Absolute Mexican Cornbread" and, needless to say, it was a keeper.  I followed the recipe only substituting the dark red kidney beans for pinto beans and added a little bit of fresh jalapenos...other than that it really doesn't need any tweaking!

I have made chili about a dozen times in the last 6 months using different recipes just in an effort to learn and get the hang of it. I like this recipe, i didn't have chili seasoning but i used a combination of cayenne pepper, cumin and chili powder instead. Very good. I was excited to use up the salsa i had in the fridge. The salsa ingredient is what i think is special about this recipe.

Let it simmer all day.. it's worth the wait. When it simmers longer, it absorbs all of the flavors and it just explodes in your mouth.

Good recipe to be sure, I use it as a base and add for my tastes.

I always add a tablespoon or two of brown sugar to chili and lasagne sauces it cuts the acidity of the tomatos.

Also I highly recommend getting an assortment of peppers ( chili, habenaro, jalopena, pablona, and even red and yellow for color ) based on your tastes and chopping them up ( I use a food chopper ) and adding them in.

I also make mine with 3-4 cans of beans ( add black, red and/or northern and it comes out just great.

This is a wonderful chili recipe! I've never thought to add a whole jar of salsa to my chili and it was great! My all time fav salsa is Meijer gold brand Roasted Black Bean & Corn.. went so well with chili. Another tip for all of you out there who like natural products. Williams Original Chili seasoning is all natural. No MSG's, no salt, preservatives or fillers. This is the best chili seasoning ever! I have only found this product at Super Target and make a special trip just  for it. I altered the recipe and put a little extra chili seasoning and beef stock for more juice without it it was really thick. Just a preference of mine. Try this recipe and you'll be hooked!

Great recipe!  Since we're in Canada, we didn't have access to Williams seasoning--but will look for it when we visit the USA over Thanksgiving.  My husband is particular about spicy food, and he went back for two helpings.  Simple, GREAT recipe!
Update: Couldn't find Williams Spices--use two packets of Spicy McCormick's Chili Seasoning instead!

Wow - my husband isn't a big chili fan, but I made this for him, and he loved it.  The only changes I made, was that I didn't have a thick salsa, so I chopped up a tomato and green pepper to add to it.  I only used 1 Tbsp. chili powder since my Norwegian palate is opposed to thigs too spicy.  And finally, I used ground venison since that is what I had thawed at the time.  Topped with a little shredded cheese and sour cream, and served it with the Golden Cornbread from this site.  This is going into my supper rotation!

I made this for the Superbowl.  It was a hit with all my guests and family, even most of the kids.  I made a few changes--I used ground turkey and half black beans/half kidney beans.  This was just spicy enough for us.  If you like HOT chili just use hot salsa and more chili seasoning or other spices.  Plus, it was very quick and easy.  DELICIOUS!  This has become a frequent meal for my family.

My husband doesn't like beans so I increased the hamburger to 2.5 lbs, added about 1/2 cup of tomato sauce, used the chili seasoning II recipe from this website and a can of rotel tomatoes. Awesome flavor with a real kick to it!  I have found my new chili recipe...and so easy!  Thanks Deb!

Made this for a surprise b'day party for my boyfriend.  Had to really bump up the qty as it was to serve 30+, but was SO easy and everybody was raving about the chili!    Still eating it 3 days later and just as good!

Yummy! Instead to 2 1/2 cups of tomato sauce I used one can and one can of diced tomatoes and added about 1/2 a can of water.  I also used pinto beans instead of dark kidney beans. Put all in slow cooker for 4 hours on high, delicious!

Awesome, Awesome recipe.  Can't say enough.  I added a jalepeno for more spice the second time, but that's a personal preference.  First time make it exactly like recipe says.  Definatetly a keeper.

I just won a chili cookoff!  I tried a couple different chili recipes before chosing this one, because I didn't think a recipe as simple as this would work, but it did.  I changed a few things, by only using one pound of ground beef (after I won, everyone wanted to try it, so I should have stuck with the two pounds.) I also added 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and a whole package of French's "Chili-O" chili seasoning mix.I only added three cans of tomato sauce and I added a can of diced tomatos. I also added 3 tablespoons of Cumin. (My supervisor thinks I won because of the three tablespoons of Cumin, used under her advice!)  I used Pace Picante sauce.  People were putting it on their hotdogs because they said it was good for chili dogs.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's the first time I've ever been in a chili cookoff.

Thought this was a great chili.  Taking advice from previous reviewers, I used one can chopped tomatoes and one (15oz)can tomato sauce instead of all tomato sauce.  I increased the onion and added one tablespoon of sugar to even out the tomato base.  I also substituted canned, hot chili beans, including the sauce, for one of the cans of kidney beans and it really kicked it up to the right temperature...not too hot, but certainly not bland.  Served with Trader Joe's cornbread, which is out of this world.  Thanks for the recipe, Deb.

Great recipe!  I changed a few things based on what I had on hand (diced tomatoes rather than tomato sauce), and used different beans.  Overall a great recipe.  Will definitely make again!

Very very tasty.... it's also very versatile.  I've worked with this chili for months and have made modifications such as doubling the amounts of tomato sauce/ salsa, adding homemade salsa, adding cilantro, doubling the onion, adding tomatoes... you really can do anything with this recipe!  I think it tastes better with my little add-ins.  Without it, I think it is too much like Spaghetti Sauce.  But it is a great base recipe, work with it and add to it and make it one your family will love.

Homemade chili is just sooo much better than popping open a can. I make this for my family along with homemade cornbread. MMM,MMM! I haven't made any changes, make it just the way it is. This is the best on a cold winters night. Thanks!

I finally decided to make a chili (still hard to believe after cooking for 30 years I had never made it) after pouring through many recipes I decided on this one..tweaked it a bit..followed someone elses suggestion of putting in a can of whole tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce...I added a small can of jalopeno peppers along with chili powder and a tex mex chili mix (which was 4 tablespoons)..came out awesome and just the right amount of hot..will definitely put this in my recipe box and SO easy to make

Love this recipe! I made it for a staff luncheon yesterday.  Added a can of stewed tomatoes for a little extra texture.  Got rave reviews.  I made a double batch the night before and warmed it in the crockpot.  Served with a sprinkle of cheese! Delicious!

This chili is the tastiest chili I have ever had - bar none!  I am not a very good cook, but can follow a recipe.  It was easy and fast.  I love this chili.
I made a couple of modifications to the recipe.  I replaced some ground beef with Jimmy Dean Italian Sausage.  Where it asks for chili seasoning, I added Texas brand Chili seasoning.  I put in a mild salsa.  It still had a kick to it, but it was the perfect balance of taste and heat.
I highly recommend this recipe because it provides enough lattitude to craft it to your liking.

This was DELISH! The guys gobbled this up FAST. Hubby was looking for the leftovers later that night and was so sad to find...NO LEFTOVERS! My brothers happened to stop over (and eat) so did my dad who is picky about his chili. He said it was superb! Very easy to pull together. Easy chili with great results. A+

All I have to say is...WOW!!  I never thought an awesome chili recipe could be soo easy!  The only change I made was substituting the kidney beans with small white beans (that's all I had), with very delicious results.  I used Pace thick & chunky salsa and a chili seasoning mix recipe from this site with great results.

This chili was delicious, and so easy to make! My kitchen smelled heavenly! 

I did make a few modifications. First of all, I halved the recipe (and still had a lot of leftovers...but not because it didn't taste good!) but I still used 1/2 an onion. When browning the beef and onion I also threw in a tablespoon of minced garlic. I used a roasted garlic flavor salsa, and to make it even spicier I used the entire package of chili seasoning mix. I only used one can of beans - I opted for the dark kidney beans. I also threw in a can of corn. The chili was definitely hot and spicy! We had it on top of rice.  OH! I totally forgot to add some cheese. Next time! I'll definitely make this again!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I used a 16 oz. jar of Tostitos Fire Roasted Salsa, and it was sooo good!  Will definitely be making this one again!

Whoa!!! This is great chili, the salsa added a great kick (and I used mild salsa) I even liked it! (And I don't particularly like chili!) Thanks for this recipe.

First off, this recipe is very easy and quick to make. Second, it is very good. It was the first time I made chili, and I was excited with the little amount of prep time involved and the rave reviews it got. We used super hot salsa to give it some kick and topped it with cheddar cheese.

This is the best chili i've ever had!!!  I have a very picky family that does not like tomatos and this hit the spot.  The recipe makes enough for a wonderful dinner and a yummy lunch the next day.

Good chili recipe.  I halved the meat (ground turkey--we don't eat beef) and used an extra can of beans instead.  It was yummy.  :)

This recipe is a keeper!  I have made this many times. Our family doesn’t like spicy food, so I use Chi-Chi’s Mild Thick n’ Chunky salsa and McCormick’s Mild Chili seasoning, but I cut back a little on the amount.  It turns out wonderful!  For those who don’t like spicy food, these are simple modifications and it preserves the flavor without the pain of hot spicy foods. I highly recommend this recipe.

I thought this was a great recipe!  The changes I made due to what I had on hand in the house:  1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can sweet corn, 1 diced red pepper, 1 diced yellow pepper, 1 16oz jar Newman's Own Salsa (medium), 1 teaspoon cumin, garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I only simmered for 20 minutes.  It was great. (I know I changed it all up but I couldn't help myself!)  My boys aged 4 and 7 ate it right down with a glop of sour cream and some shredded cheddar on top with corn muffins on the side.  My husband ate 2 ladlefuls in the first bowl and said "that went down too fast!" and got up for seconds.    :)

I never would have believed this recipe would win me first prize in the Malibu Big Rock chili cookoff.  I doubled the recipe; used a cheap store brand chili seasoning (3 pakets was plenty for doubling this recipe) and instead of kidney beans I used 3 cans Northern White Beans and 1 can black beans.  Also crockpot simmered for 4 hours, cooled for 2 days, then brought back up to temperature.  Next time I make it I'd like to try using smoked brisket instead of ground beef... yummy yummy permanent recipe for me

Want to win the chuch chili cook-off? Make this recipe! It's a winner.... literally.  

I usually double the recipe and freeze any leftovers (which sometimes is none). I use whatever beans I have on hand: pinto, black, navy, etc. I make my own chili seasoning mix and I usually just add the whole can of tomato sauce so I don't have to throw away/save any. I'll also (sometimes) use ground turkey or pork for one pound of the ground meat.

I've tried a dozen different recipes.  Some of them were as simple as throwing two cans and a chunk of meat in a pot, while others called for 20 different ingredients including stuff like unsweetened cocoa which no one has in their cupboard, beer, coffee, every single herb and spice fresh from the dirt, 300 different types of meat, 7,000 different beans  and then simmer it until you retire and give it to your children as a graduation present. Any subtle omission or superfluous inclusion completely destroys the dish and you would be better off eating dog food.

Therefore, until I found this recipe, I stuck with the most basic method. It always comes out tasting decent and it takes next to no time and effort. Sometimes I'dd throw in a can of green chiles, maybe use a different bean or an uncased sausage if I was feeling dangerous.

The first time I tried this recipe I realized I had been living a lie. I didn't have to settle for good-not-great chili or spend hours in the kitchen with 1,000 ingredients. Some sort of magic happens with the salsa and the tomato juice. It gives the chili this certain bright tangyness that doesn't at all overshadow the deeper flavors and  overwhelm you. The only real problem is that it's hard stop eating it.

Now this Chili's not going to work with everyone. Some like their chili extremely thick, while this one's a bit thinner. It doesn't have a bitterness from coffee or cocoa or whtever which some might find disappointing. There aren't a ton of dif

This recipe was awesome and very easy to make! ! I did change it just a little and I used 2 cans of  chili beans instead of the others and a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomatoes sauce. I used 3/4 of a large jar of the picante sauce. It can really be adjusted to taste. My family loved it!!

This review isn't even necessary as their are so many positive remarks. But this was my first time making chili and turned out great! I even think I might have put too much salsa by accident. I've made it a few times since then with beef and turkey and its always delicious!

Unbelievable!  Had never tried this receipe but went to a high school friendly parent chili cookoff and made this receipe and it WON!  Its so easy and fast but the end result taste like you spent hours.... Really really good. Made only minor changes - added a can of rotelli tomatos/ chilis and used  1 can of kidney beans and 1 pinto just to mix it up. I used pace picante hot sauce and mccormick seasoning ( 1/2 pkg hot and 1/2 pkg regular). This had just the perfect kick to it. You wont be disappointed!

Super easy and delicious! I had a 15oz and 8oz can of tomato sauce but was short of 2.5 cups so I used the entire 16oz jar of Pace. I used ground elk instead of beef, one can of dark red kidney beans and one can of pinto beans and added a can of corn. Super good!

I tried this recipe last night and it was a huge hit! I'm throwing out my old chili recipe and this is my new one!  The only thing different I did was I used 1 1/4 lbs of ground beef and 3/4 lb Jimmy Regular sausage.  I think a little sausage gives chili a little more YUM :) Delicious recipe.  Thanks, Deb!

Tried this recipe last night and was a hit.  The few small adjustments I made were using the chili seasoning mix recipe from this site instead of a prepackaged one, added an extra teaspoon of ground cumin, and added a teaspoon of smoked paprika.  Also, I let it cook for 2 hours.  Everyone loved it.

Outstanding.  I used corn & black bean salsa as it was all i had.  Used half venison half ground beef-excellent flavor with NO gamey taste.

This IS really good. Really easy too. I felt like I was cheating using plain old McCormick chili seasoning.  I don't make chili often, but, on a cold rainy evening this was really perfect, recipe just as written.

Great chili! Used grounded top round and it's worth it for the tenderness. Not too spicy, just enough to feel it. Next time I'll make it a little more spicy but following the recipe it turns out just right so everyone can enjoy it.

This recipe is ridiculously easy and tasty! I halved the meat using 1 lb ground turkey. Used whole sweet onion chopped. One packet taco seasoning and threw in a can of creamed corn! Wow so delicious!

I have used this recipe many times.  Won #1st place in our church's annual chili cook-off 3 times in a row.  Only alterations - add a bit of brown sugar and some jalapenos for kick - we like it a bit spicy, so I used medium salsa and hot chili seasoning.

Absolutely loved this chili, as did my family and guests! One reviewer said it tasted too much like tomatos, and if thats the case then you didn't add enough chili seasoning (please note thats not chili powder. I used Chili Seasoning II here on all recipes). Only change I made was I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I blended up some stewed tomatos and Rotale together and it was perfect. My wife who can't handle much spice also loved this chili as it was just fantastic, and not too spicey (though red chili peppers and jalapenos could fix that fast!)

This is a good idea... However I found that the bottled salsa left me with watery jous. You have nailed the consistency of the meat however I would suggest not cooking down the salsa. TOMATO are still a fit that should be treated very delicately so don't allow it to break down too much or you will lose the nutritional and sweetness factors in your dish. IT WILL BREAK!!!

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  And delicious.
I don't normally change a recipe and then rate it, as it seems unfair to the original cook.  However my changes were minor and due to family preference.
I substituted black beans because my daughter doesn't like kidney beans and added a teaspoon of smoked chipotle powder for some extra kick and flavour.  I also used fresh garlic.
It is our new family go to recipe.

Unless everyone uses the same salsa u won't be eating the same chilli. That is the reason I gave it a lower rating because without the salsa it is NOT very flavourful. The flavour is mostly from the salsa. So if I were to enter a contest and it wins, it would be Pace, old Dutch,......(insert your brand)  that is the winner.

My family loved this recipe and I am PICKY! The only thing I did differently is that I used Great Value brand white corn and black bean salsa! It was amazing. The only thing I would do differently is that since my salsa is only available in mild (from what I've seen) so I would use a packet of HOT chili seasoning, because I prefer a little more kick to my chili. Thank you for the recipe! We will use again and again.

Perfect pairing for this delicious chili is white basmati rice; I only use 1 can of dark kidney beans when I serve it this way. I use Chili Seasoning Mix II by Sal here on allrepcipes for the chili seasoning, and it comes out fantastic every time! I'm mildly addicted. Thank you for this recipe!

Being a poor college student who only recently converted to the "cooking every meal you eat" lifestyle, this recipe was amazing. The first thing that drew me to it was how wonderfully few ingredients it needed, and the simplicity of the ones it did need. The next was how simple it was, 2 steps, not much prep time, only one dirty pot, and food enough to last we almost a week? That's a winner in my book even if the recipe doesn't taste incredible (which this definitely does). Even more amazing, after I failed to use my common sense and burned the bejeezus out of the bottom of the pot by not stirring the chili at all while it was simmering, the chili STILL TASTED AMAZING (once the kitchen stopped smelling like smoke). Basically, this chili is disaster proof. I highly recommend it.

I have never made chili before. I used this recipe to make my first batch. It was AWESOME. Never used to like chili but this recipe changed that. I had it for several meals after. It makes quite a bit. Enjoyed with tortilla chips, too. I didn't have chili mix but made my own. So, so goood! Thank you!

Thank you for this wonderful, easy recipe! I had never made a pot of chili in my life, and I made this yesterday for a chili cook off and won first place! 

The only change I made was to add a can of mild rotel for a little extra spice.

This recipe is OK. Nothing bad about it -- just turns out this is not the way I like my chili. I did stick to the recipe.  I like the idea of using salsa and I used one with roasted poblano peppers in it.  I may try salsa in my chili again but not this recipe.  Everyone has different preferences and chili is a great example of how different our tastes can be regarding a particular dish. I see where someone even likes mushrooms in their chili. :) For me, there was too much tomato sauce and not enough heat.  I now know I much prefer tomatoes in my chili and only a little tomato sauce if I use it at all.  This Texas cook also likes my chili with a lot more hot chili pepper flavor.

This is the very best chili recipes I have ever tasted, a few added ingredients enhanced the overall tastiness, chopped peppers, garlic, chipotle peppers & a small can of green chilies, then the usual toppings! So good

This was ok, I tried it, because I had some salsa I wanted to use up. It tasted good, had some nice flavors, but it was a bit too basic for me. Just meat and bean chili. Next time, I'll modify it and add some Hoosier fixins to it. Like corn, and macaroni. It's a good chili base. It would be GREAT on hot dogs, or with nachos, or even chili cheese fries. I liked it, but needs some more power arrr arrr arrrrgh

Just made this chili last night.  My entire family of very picky eaters loved it!  It couldn't be any easier.  I pretty much followed the instructions, taking the advice of the recipe owner and using Pace Salsa (med) and 2 entire packages of chili seasoning mix (McCormick's).  I ended up using about 3 cups of tomato sauce (was using up the entire large can).  I also drained the kidney beans before adding.  We topped this with cheddar cheese and ate it with cornbread on a rainy evening.  This is my new favorite chili recipe - thanks Deb!!

Great crowd pleaser (used the chili seasoning 1 recipe)! Only downside: recipe did not make suggested 6-8 servings. At best, it serves 4 adults and a child so I had to rated the recipe based off a taste test I did while cooking combined with the reviews of those who actually ate a bowl full:-)

Totally underwhelming!  I thought I had goofed on the recipe so I double checked and I had followed the recipe exactly.  A bunch of twenty somethings watching football could hardly eat this on dogs! I don't get it?

Very hearty, easy and tasty.  I made the taco seasoning without chili powder from this site for the chili seasoning mix and it worked out very well though my personal preference would have called for less paprika.

PERFECTION. As an extreme beginner, this recipe was easy and delicious!  Something I plan to serve at the next family gathering without a doubt.  It is easy enough to change how spicy it is by changing up what kind of salsa you go with, which means I will definitely be continuing to experiment with this one.

Real nice chili.  Made up a picante sauce, per debzdoo's comments, used a clove of garlic in place of garlic salt, and added about 2C frozen corn.  Thinned the chili with a little water, as was very thick.

It's a family favorite! The main change I made was to use half ground beef and half beef tips; my family liked it much better that way.  If I don't have a jar of salsa on hand, I substitute with 1 can of Rotel with a small can of green chili's (it sometimes saves money too). I start with 3 Tablespoons of Chili Seasoning and add more if needed. I have used it in the crockpot as well as stovetop.

My family loved this recipe.  I browned the ground beef and onions in a skillet, then transfered them to my crock pot.  I added the rest of the ingredients into the crock pot (I used the Chili Seasoning II recipe on this site) and let it cook all day on low.  I served with warm corn bread.  The flavor was great, the meat was tender.

Gave this 5 stars because it tastes good and is VERY easy.  It may not be the hotteset, or the most slow cooked, but if you want chili during the week and have kids that can't handle a lot of heat, this one is for you.

Read all the reviews and figured 1780 cooks couldn't be wrong.  And, OMG, this is THE BEST CHILI I have ever made.  Followed the directions exactly. Used Pace's Piquante Medium Salsa and McCormick's Chili Seasoning.  Absolutely fabulous.  We (son, daughter, son-in-law, grandson and moi) really enjoyed it.  Thanks, Deb.

Great chili.  I cut back on the sugar but still found it a bit sweet so would completely eliminate it next time.  I couldn't find the Williams chili seasoning so used a chili seasoning recipe on this site in its place.  Super easy to make in the slow cooker.

Very good chili and fast to prepare. The only thing I adjusted was the dry spice and a special ingredient addition.  I added a about 2 tablespoons of chili powder and a can of dark beer. This is one of the best chili recipes we've tried by far. YUM! You will not be disappointed.

I have made this recipe a lot. It really is good! I think that the reason people have said that it's too hot without much flavor is that they added chili seasoning not a chili seasoning MIX. That would change the flavor a lot. The reason I think that is that I almost did the same thing. I almost did that because mix is on the next line and I just read it quickly saw chili seasoning. I also didn't know that packets even existed until this recipe. :) My mom always made it from scratch but hers is different than my husband is used to so I looked for a recipe that he'd like. And this was it!! If you don't have a packet on hand, someone suggested using Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site. It has all the same spices as the packet. Again, this has great flavor and smells wonderful while it's cooking. Thank you for the awesome recipe!!!

I used black beans and added additional salsa. My husband also tweeked the recipe and it turned out great. I think this is a good recipe but it did lack tomato and pepper flavor that I prefer.

This chili is a blue ribbon winner! At every function we attend I am always asked to make this chili and there are never any leftovers. The spices are perfect for our taste too. I always make a double batch and freeze 1/2.

I followed the recipe exactly, it was a little meaty for me. Added two more cans of beans, after that it was amazing!

I just tried this recipe for the first time tonight. We had chili at a party and she told us where to find the recipe so I decided to give it a try. This was my first ever time I've made chili, even though I love to cook. I think I was intimidated by it for some reason, but this recipe is super easy, and it was a BIG hit with our family. My 6 year old thought it was too spicy but everyone else loved it. It tastes really good with sour cream, cheese, and cornbread mixed in. YUMMY for my tummy. Perfect for a cold night.

I made this last weekend. I used the entire packet of the taco seasoning and added about a tablespoon of chilli powder, the rest I followed to a T. It was great but even better then next day reheated!

This chili is GOOD! It tastes like what you think chili would or should. You can control spicy-ness by salsa added. More of the spice is tasted and salsa taste gone after cooking. It is meaty. The recipe doesn't make this 'huge' batch - it makes enough.[An envelope of McCormick's or Old El Paso chili seasoning is 4 tbsps.]

Good and easy.  Note, it is chili seasoning (1 packet is 4 TBS)and not powder.  It looks like a lot of the folks that did not like used chili powder by mistake.  We liked it - it was not too spicy for us and we usually order thai food with the lowest rating.  A bit too many beans for us.

I found the recipe, chopped the onion and left the instruction for my daughters.  Pleasantly surprised is an understatement. My family doesn't like beans so the girls added corn. Just delishis and perfect for a cold autumn dinner.
I will be making this again and will try someone's suggestion of brown sugar and beer!

Above Average!!  Love chili and am always trying new recipes.  Didn't have my usual ingredients and found this recipe.  When made as is too much tomato flavor for me (and I love tomatoes).  Second time I made it I replaced tomato sauce w/1 can rotelle and 1 can whole tomatoes, used Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site minus 1/2 the flour and sugar in that recipe, the rest of ingredients as is plus some beef broth to thin it out a little.  OMG! It was awesome.  Family of 5, no left overs.  Made the Homesteader Cornbread (from this site) which was excellent.  Serve chili w/sour cream, chopped onions and jalepenos and wedge of lime.

This is now my go-to chili recipe. My fiance loves it, even though he calls it soup since he's from Texas and "Chili doesn't have beans". I recently took it to a work chili cook off and tied for first place. It has a little bit of spice without being too overpowering. I love adding a little sour cream and chopped onion as a garnish. If you like your chili with a little bite, you'll love this too.

We just made this tonight and it was delicious!!! Best chili we ever had. We used McCormick's mild chili mix and just added a little bit more Pace Picante sauce. I think the Pace gives the chili an extra taste boost. This will be our chili recipe from now on!

I've been making this chili for over two years now.  Soooo delicious.  I had to buy the large container of Williams Chili Seasoning on Amazon but it's worth it.  That along with Pace Picante Sauce makes this chili amazing.  So many flavors going on here and it works so well with one another.  Thanks so much for a great recipe Deb!

This chili is AMAZING. I'm one of those people who usually loves recipes with 87 different steps, crazy ingredients and no shortcuts, but I can't stop making this chili. I tweaked it only slightly but it's still amazing as-is; I can't believe how easy it is, and how much tastier it is than other recipes that take way longer! So many people have asked me for this recipe. My (small) changes/specifications are as follows: 

for the tomato sauce, I used 29oz (a little over 3 1/2c) instead of 2 1/2c ... 1 pint of fresh tomato sauce from freshdirect, and one 15oz can of hunt's tomato sauce.

I also added 2tbs muscavado sugar.

Everything else is the same! 

For the salsa I used Paul Newman, and for the chili spice I used the freshdirect brand.

This is an excellent recipe.  When I first saw the list of ingredients, I was skeptical.  But the result was very good.  As suggested, I used Pace picante sauce (medium heat).  I think my regular chili recipe just found a competitor.  Thanks, Deb!

YUM!  This is going to go on my list of favorites for sure!  I used a mild salsa, and the suggested chili seasoning brand (Williams).  I may tweak it occasionally just because that's how I am, but?  The recipe as written is great!

This is so quick and easy.  We made it on a camping trip and there was none left!  Serve with shredded cheese and chips.  We had a jar of Newman's Mango Salsa that we used.  Sounds strange, we were worried, but it was delicious!

I made this exactly per the recipe and it's the best chili I ever made. I don't ever eat leftovers, but was even happy to eat this for leftovers, which is saying a lot! Very flavorful, and a thick chili, which I like.

This chili is AWESOME! My husband's response was "is this REALLY the first time you've ever made chili??". I made some very small changes based on recommendations from previous reviewers, and it was DELICIOUS!

I added a 1/2 teaspoon sugar, a teaspoon salt, 5 tablespoons of the chili seasoning (rather than 4), and just a DASH of hot sauce. 

Thanks for this recipe! I will definitely be making it again!

A great turn out for my first chilli, the kids weren't into the beans, but I liked it.  I used one packet of taco seasoning instead but it was still tasty.

Just made this tonight. Loved it. Super easy, and tasty. Awesome.

I used Great Value Medium Salsa for the base, this worked out quite well as Great Value salsa has a thick consistency and is my favorite flavor. This was the first time I had made a chili outside of my grandmother's recipe and I was floored by how good it is. My mom said it was the best she ever had.

Yummy! I love this! I used more than 8oz salsa, just a whole jar (I think it was 12-16 oz) and an extra can of kidney beans. Yum Yum Yum!

Awesome chili!! I got alot of compliments. 
For the salsa I like using Tostido's brand-Medium. I don't like things too spicy and the medium is perfect once it simmers down. 
From some of the other reviews, I substituted the light kidneys with pinto. I added 1 can of tom paste and 1 can of 'diced tomatoes with pepper and onions'. 
I would skip the garlic salt and pepper on this recipe next time b/c the chili seasoning which I got from this site, I made myself and it covered those ingredients. As a result, I found I had to add a bit more sugar to it to cut some of saltiness out.
I left it in the slow cooker for a few hours and served it over rice with the cornbread that I also got from this site. Sprinkled the top with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream and I fed 5 adults with no left overs!!

This chili  was so good! Everyone in my family really liked it a lot. The changes that I made were to use real garlic (maybe 3 cloves), and I added sauteed green pepper. I also added about a tsp of cumin. I used Pace original picante sauce and McCormick's chili seasoning packet. Served with Frito scoops, shredded cheese and sour cream! YUMMO!!

Very good meal I changed it by adding ~2 jalapenos, a red, orange, and yellow bell pepper (for color) and used a can of tomato paste instead of about a cup of the tomato sauce so as to make it thicker.  Came out better then my mother makes it, by her own admission.

I usually just enjoy cooking mexican food because it's the easiest for me. I tried this CHILI and the recipe was so easy to follow. I did add ground Turkey instead of the ground beef. I like my food spicy so I also chopped a few jalapeno peppers and I added the Peace Picante (HOT) salsa. I topped it off with sharp cheddar and a french roll to go with it. My husband loved it!!

Yep. It's excellent chili! Thanks. Here is what I used just because it's what I had on hand:
Browned chuck roast cut up in small pieces and chopped garlic. Added 2 cans kidney beans, 1 can Ranch style pinto beans, 1 can Rotel with green chilies, 1 can El Pato (hot), black pepper, chili powder (Gebhardt's becasue I was out of New Mexico which is my favorite) and a cup of Pace Picante hot salsa. Simmered for a few hours. Delicious!! My son is a very picky eater, especially regarding chili and he said it was EXCELLENT!

Fast and easy.  Added a cup of chopped green peppers, substitute chili sauce for the tomato sauce and threw in a tablespoon of minced garlic sautéed in olive oil.  I also substituted Hotshot black/red pepper.  Yummy.

There is only one word for this...HEAVEN!!!  I am always very critical of chili...but I have absolutely no complaints.  I cut the recipe in half, but I accidentally forgot and put the full amount of chili seasoning, and it still worked out great!  I topped mine with some shredded cheddar mix, raw onion, and oyster crackers.  YUM!!  This one is definitely a new favorite!

It was a real hit with the Grey Cup crowd this year! I made a double batch just as the recipe says and it turned out great! I used Old El Paso chili seasoning and a mild salsa with corn and black beans in it. This one is a keeper, only problem is no leftovers!

Delish and soooooo easy! It's great for when you crave chili but don't have all day to cook it! I threw it all in the crock pot as well. Perfect!

This was really the best chili I've ever made!  I followed it exactly except I added a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles.  Amazing!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have never made chili in my life. Our church had a chili cook off so I decided to try the contest. I found Debdoozie chili on all reciept.com. Well I took first place in the cook off. Everyone loved the chili. The best chili I have ever put in my mouth. Thanks for great tasting chili.

So easy and so good! I used about 12 oz of paces picante sauce mild since I don't really like spicy chili. I used one pound of ground pork and one pound of larger cut ground beef so it stayed chunkier. And I followed other reviewers recommendations, and used a can of tomato sauce and a can of tomatoes (I used the fire roasted diced tomatoes!). I will definitely use this recipe again, even the kids ate some and asked for more. I think this would be a great work potluck also, since you could brown the meat and onions the night before and just open everything day of and put in crockpot.(oh yeah, I put it in crockpot on low for about 4 hours while I was running errands). Now that I think of it, chili is often better on the second day, maybe you could make it the day before and just put it on warm at work until lunchtime?

Anytime I use salsa in a recipe, I try to make sure I actually like the salsa first. This time I used Herdez Salsa Ranchera without trying it.  The flavor was good but still overpowering. Next time I will use El Pato sauce, which I think my turkey would have a better chance of standing up to.  That said, it is an excellent, simple recipe, and with the proper tweabook for my tastes, it would easily reach five stars in my book.

Delicious -- my two children loved it and my wife thought it was better than the one she usually purchases at a local diner. I added an extra can of dark red kidney beans to balance it out. It was a hit for our household. Another small adjustment was that I substituted fresh cloves of garlic instead of garlic salt. You can also add cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper flakes for a little kick. I served this to a crowd during Christmas -- everyone loved it !!

This is a such a great easy recipe.  I added a few things, a dash of cocoa, a dash of cinnamon, three grilled chili peppers chopped small and a few splashes of guiness beer. I also always add stew beef for the meat eaters in my house.  Top it off with shredded cheese and sour cream...mmmm!

Made this recipe for chili dogs at our church's Fall Festival and got many requests for the recipe! I used Williams Chili Seasoning and as I used 10lbs of hamburger I wound up just using 2 whole packages of the seasoning. My husband is already requesting I make it again at home!

I used 2/3 of the chili seasoning and it was still a little spicy for my young family.  Had great reviews from others and was good - just will lower the heat next time.

This was AWESOME - my modifications - used the medium salsa - whole packet of McCormick chili seasoning - added a bottle of dark beer, black beans, medium chili beans and white kidneys as well as one can of regular kidneys - added some red pepper flakes and some granulated garlic - and cooked it on low all day in my crockpot.  Heavenly!

Best chili I've ever had!! I added more tomato sauce and instead of kidney beans used pinto and ranch style beans. I also took the advise of another reviewer below and added a dash of basil, oregano, garlic and about a teaspoon of sugar. Oh and don't forget to add a little cheddar cheese to the top! My whole family loved it!

I tried this recipe tonight for my husband and myself.  It was so delicious! To me this dish has all the elements I look for in a top-rate recipe: its budget-friendly, easy to prep, oh so good to eat, and plenty leftover to freeze.  We had enough leftovers for at least 2 more meals.  Thank you!

I made this last night with cornbread and had several friends over.  It was delicious.  I used the the whole jar of Pace picante sauce (16 oz) and substituted diced tomatos with chiles for some of the tomato sauce at the advice of some of the other reviewers.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  It had the perfect amount of spice and I have already been sneaking into the kitchen to eat more of it today. I have already told several friends about it and they thought the salsa was a great idea as well and are looking forward to trying it!

I was looking for a chili recipe for my husband and I when I stumbled upon this recipe last year.  let's just say that the reviews are ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!!  Delicios recipe.  We add a little extra spice to ours, because we like it extra spicy!  Then we sprinkle with freshly shredded cheddar cheese and dip tortillas in it.  :)

I was actually suprised that this came out so good.  The recipe does not state what chili mix to use but I used Shelby's and added some cyan pepper to it for some spice.  My whole family loved it, and i will be using this recipe again.

So yummy! Thank you for sharing. I added a 14 oz can of chili ready tomatoes, fresh minced garlic, frozen sweet corn, and used best choice fire roasted salsa. It's simmering on the stove and I can't stop 'taste testing' it!

Very tasty and delicious.  Made even better by the substitution of homemade salsa for jarred stuff and the addition of tomato from our garden.  Blue ribbon material for sure!

This is a fantastic and very easy chili recipe.  I used "Chili Seasoning II" from this site and it was perfect!  And to all of you with the comments about the beans - no one is calling this Texas chili.  Chili can obviously vary depending on the region you live in.
**Update:  I too have now won first place in my neighborhood community association's chili cook-off with this recipe...a true blue ribbon chili!!!

Not only is this recipe delicious but it's the easiest chili recipe i've found. I didn't change a thing. I served it over freshly baked corn bread and topped it with shredded cheddar cheese. So yummy! I think i'll try adding some jalapeno peppers next time just to give it more of a kick but otherwise, it's perfect the way it is.

Absolutely delicious! I used 1 entire Walla Walla sweet onion, 3 cans of beans (pinto, white kidney and red kidney) and 8 oz of medium salsa verde. It's only been simmering for about 15 minutes and I have already declared this as our new homemade chili recipe. Thanks so much for such an easy and delicious chili recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was one of the best pots of chili I've ever made. So easy. We like a little more heat, so next time I will add a can of diced tomatoes with chopped green chilis.

Delicious and super easy! (it was my first time making chili and even I call it easy!) Its a thicker chili so next time I might do less (turkey) burger to save on calories/fat content and it will still be delicious. Will definately make again!

I'm getting old I think because I can't remember if I've reviewed this recipe or not - but just in case .... THIS IS AWESOME.  I've been making it now for five or so years, both with and without beans.  My husband is not a chili lover, but he requests this one now.  Thanks Debdoozie.

I really liked this chili - I prefer a mild chili which this was. I wasn't sure if the beans should be drained and rinsed like a lot of recipes, so I did - next I would not do this, or if I did I would add some broth or beer - it wasn't dry, but I would've liked a little more liquid. I will definitely make this again - thanks!!

I make this with ground turkey.  It is AMAZING.  I get so many complements on it.  The only change I made was to add more tomato.  I like my chili with more saucy liquid.

This was my first attempt at making chili. I used ground pork, as I can't eat beef. It was FANTASTIC even my fussy hubby eat all his.   Leftovers were great too!

I've been using this recipe for years, minus the garlic and adding pintos as well. Its the best thing my mother-in-law has ever taught me! You can also put the browned meat into the crockpot and let it do its thing all day. Ground turkey also works for me, but the husband doesn't like the texture as much. This is my favorite easy winter meal!

I made this last night with Grandmother's Buttermilk corn bread (also from allrecipes).  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was really easy to made, smelled great when cooking, and was rich and hearty.  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

SO Good! I have been making this chili for years, I add some extras that my family enjoys such as corn and since I usually at least double the recipe I add some different beans such as pinto, black, great northern. I get so many compliments every time I make it and it is SO easy! No need to ever try another chili recipe!

This chili is excellent!  My chili recipe has an ingredient list a mile long so I was hesitant to try this.  I'm sure glad I did as this makes a wonderful chili when I don't have time to grind my own meat and use my own recipe.  I highly recommend this!!!

This recipe is soo simple but it tastes like you spent hours and hours on it. Will definitely make again. A perfect chili that is not over powering & has a nice balance of flavors.

This was alright. I don't know that I would call it Blue Ribbon chili? I made for a work pot-luck. It reminded me of regular chili but, with a lot of meat! It filled the pot I was using. It was different, as I  don't normally make chili with 2lbs of hamburger and I have never added salsa to chili! The men seemed to really like it though. And, it all pretty much got eaten up.

Finally, a chili recipe that doesn't take all day!  I used a packet of taco seasoning instead of chili powder, only had one pound of ground beef, and just simmered half the recommended time.  It still came out delicious!  My chili-hating husband even liked it.

My entire family enjoyed this recipe. It was quick & easy to prepare. The only change I made was to use fresh garlic cloves (4) because we were out of garlic salt.  One comment I would like to add is that this chili has just a hint of heat. It wasn't a problem for us, but I was planning on making this for someone recovering from surgery (to have in the freezer), but they cannot tolerate any "bite" in their food, so the chili powder will have to be reduced in the next batch.  This is in no way a criticism of the recipe.

I've made this chili twice without changing anything. I cooked this in a crockpot both times. I have a bigger crockpot so I change the serving size to 12 so that it fills it up. I have used medium salsa and hot chili seasoning(split with regular chili seasoning) but it wasn't really spicy at all.

This chili was SO EASY to make.  I am a new cook and it was so simple but packed with flavor.  I only used a quarter of an onion but a little more garlic than called for.  I served it over white rice.  I used pace medium salsa and McCormick hot and spicy seasoning.  also only used one can of beans... very yummy and i was concerned about it because it made my stomach hurt but my husband came home and said "this looks like a winner" when he smelled it and stirred it.  Anyway- i served him and he goes "that's wayyy too much!" and at the end, the plate was completely bare lol.  he loved it. thanks for the recipe, will do again but with normal seasoning not hot n spicy because it made my stomach hurt.

My daughter, who "hates" chili, begs me to make this weekly; even in the hot summer.  I use a low sodium chili seasoning mix and garlic powder instead of salt to help lower the sodium level.  For so few ingredients it is delicious! I made it one time with the salsa and one time without and tasted great both times. Thank you so much for sharing!

I'm not a big chili fan, but I was just looking for something different to make this week for dinner. But I must say this is the best chili I have ever eaten! It wasn't too spicy, it was just right. I like alot of cheese in mine, so I practically smothered it, and a dollop of sour cream on top. Even my 2 1/2yr old loved it!! Great recipe!

This is hands down the best chili recipe EVER!!! My boyfriend can't get enough of this. You can really adjust the flavors to your personal taste with seasonings, without altering the original recipe. My bf is an avid hunter so I use deer meat instead of ground beef. I add an extra 4 oz. of tomato sauce and salsa, and also add in a bit more onion than called for and some minced garlic. This really conceals the flavor of the deer meat and no one I have ever served this to can believe it is deer! Bf even had me make it for his company picnic, and I won a chili cook off contest with it- with the deer meat! If your man likes to hunt, you will LOVE this recipe! And if he doesn't, you'll still love this recipe! Thanks for sharing Debbie!

This recipe was definitely a hit and tasted great! Instead of garlic salt, I minced some garlic for a more flavorful taste. You can also already buy minced garlic to save on cutting time. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I love this recipe because it isn't complicated at all and tastes amazing. I have made it as written which was delicious. I now substitute the beef with ground white turkey, which is a healthier but just as tasty option. I tend to like spicier foods so I use hot salsa and hot chili seasoning mix. Adding rinsed canned corn was yum! Delicious served with some corn chips!

So simple, so versatile.  I've been making this recipe for yrs.  I've done so many things to it and it always comes out tasting great!  I've used a whole jar of salsa vs only half.  I've subbed cans of tomato soup in place of the tomato sauce.  I've used 2 pkgs of chili seasoning mix for an extra kick.  You CAN'T mess up this recipe.  We love it with crackers and cheddar cheese on top.  Leftovers are great for chili dogs or frito chili pies.  Mmmmm.  I always double this so we have easy leftovers for my family of 5.  Also freezes REALLY well!  Love to put half in the freezer and a simple thaw overnight in the fridge makes reheating taste 100% fresh.

Taste is just like Wendy's (fast food chain) chili which is a compliment!  I love their chili! I only added 1 lb. of meat. We like our chili a little less on the thick side and add crackers or frito's and cheese. Would be good with a hot dog on a bun too!

I have to say I am quite perplexed as to how this recipe received so many stars. I made the recipe exactly the way it said and even used the allrecipes chili seasoning from the site and it turned out SUPER SPICY and WAY TOO SALTY so it was inedible until i fixed it by boiling a chopped up potato in the chili. It helped a little but I still had to add additional sugar to counteract all the salt. My husband and I, who both like spicy food, were also overwhelmed by the heat in this dish even though I only used medium salsa. Next time I make this dish I guess I'll have to use mild salsa and I will definitely not put any red pepper or salt like was suggested in the chili seasoning mix. I can't really give it a good rating since i couldn't really taste it. Sorry.

This is such an easy and delicious chili recipe!  I used ground turkey to make it a bit healthier, and you would have never known the difference.  It turned out a bit thicker than I like my chili, so I used a full 3 c. of tomato sauce and doubled the salsa.  It was still nice and thick, but didn't stick to my ribs!  I used Pace Picante Medium, but since I doubled it, this made it a little too spicy.  Next time, I'll use mild instead.  Thanks for a great recipe!

excellent.  Used large can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce & only 1 can of red kidney beans.  Used 1 envelope of chili spice mix plus about 1 tbs of chili powder.  Nice kick.

Pretty decent considering the ease of this chili. It was missing salt though. Once I added about 2 tsp of salt it tasted better but not quite 5 stars. Served with tortilla chips, cornbread, sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.

I love this recipe. I used it for the first time I made chili. I now use it as a base recipe, and just play around with it. I never use salsa though, just didn't prefer it. I add alot of chili powder, garlic, onion, etc. It's a very good, thick, hearty chili. We always top it with sour cream and cheddar, and eat it with crackers. I've also cooked it in the slow cooker instead of the stove top, after I browned the meat of course.

This is the best chili EVER! One reviewer said that it tastes like Wendy's chili, although to them it wasn't a good thing.  Personally, I LOVE Wendy's chili, so I gave it a try, and it is fabulous! It is very thick and creamy and you can make it as spicy as you like.  Here in Fairbanks I couldn't find "light" kidney beans so I just use 2 cans of the dark.  I make this twice a month in winter.  Yummmmm!

This is good overall chili.  Easy of preparation=5, cook time=5, flavor=4, personality=2.  If you need to make chili in a hurry, then it works great.  The canned ingredients lack fresh flavor and personality, but it still works.  I had to add at least two more cups of tomato sauce and salsa for liquid, if not it would be a huge mass of meat and beans.

I made in two 18 quart roasters for a company function.  It was a hit, as it should be.  I got lots of compliments, even days later.  I thought it was fantastic and easy to do in mass quantities since they're aren't a lot of ingredients compared to other chili recipes.  Definitely will make again!

I prefer chili that isn't quite as thick.  I thought it tasted great but some thought it was a little too spicy.  Next time I might add more tomato sauce and cut back on the chili seasoning.

Loved this!  I have never made chili before and this turned out exactly as I love my chili.  The only changes that I made was to add 1 green bell pepper and 1 large can diced tomatoes.  I WILL be making this again.

Good but a little thick for me.  After trying it I added some more sauce and water to thin it out a little.  I used Pace Picante Hot and it was very warm. Won my company chili cookoff with this recipe.

Great recipe!  Cold and raining, so I didn't feel like stopping at the store on my way home from work just for some chili seasoning.  Searched the internet and found a perfect recipe for some.  I had everything else in my pantry.  Used 93/3 ground beef so didn't need to drain any fat.  Added a roasted jalapeno and some fresh garlic; other than that, followed the recipe. I found it a little salty so added a little water.  Thickened it at the end with some masa harina...GREAT!

You're not going to believe this, but I made this recipe for a church chili contest and won 1st Place with it the first time I made it.  I made very minor modifications, I used one can of Pinto Beans substituting the can of Red Kidney Beans and managed the use of the tomato sauce during the simmering to get the consitency I like.  I enjoyed this Great Recipe and so did our church and I have the blue ribbon to prove it!!!!!

The best and easy , easy , easy !! I used abour 3 pounds of Ground beef because it was all frozen together. Drained and rinsed the beans and used a whole large jar of salsa ( because of the extra meat ). I also used the whole packet of seasoning mix- about 5 or so tbsp instead of 4. We like things a bit on the spicy side :). Simmered for one hour and served with icy cold sour cream , grated cheddar cheese ,diced avacado with a squeeze of lime and crispy nacho chips on the side. Tonight , chili dogs !!!! Thanks Debdoozie !

I have made this once a week for about the last 6 weeks!  Only change is I add a whole jar (16oz) of salsa and a large jar of tomato sauce.  I've already shared this with several friends!  Thanks so much for sharing it.

With so few ingredients, and many of them "run of the mill", I was concerned that this may turn out to be just okay. I followed the recipe as it was written. This is the BEST chili around! I let it simmer for a few hours on the stove. I served it with fritos, shredded cheddar and green onions. I can't wait to try it with cornbread.

I loved this recipe, my wife did not. It was so quick and easy so I give it 4 stars.  I made it again, but with my own home made salsa and she loved it. Avoid the Pace Picante if you can and use the best salsa you have.

Growing up my best friend's mother made the best chili. Whenever she made it he'd call me (and the 3rd in our trio) and we'd find an excuse to come over right before dinner. This is almost exactly her recipe. To make Mrs. Smith's chili follow this recipe, but use pinto beans in place of the light kidney beans. Also, use one whole red onion sauteed with some minced garlic, a 1&1/2 teaspoons of cumin, and black pepper to taste. YUM YUM YUM.

Made per directions by first time chili "rookie"--and wow!! I made a BLUE RIBBON tasting recipe that had that simmering low to medium "nice heat" to it!!!  Works very well w/ some "jazzed up" cornbread!!  This one's a 5-star keepter.

Loved it! Simple. I made this for 50 people and there was not one complaint. Everyone loved it! The only thing I will adjust in the future is the amount of pepper and I will substitute the garlic salt with real crushed garlic; adding it to the meat while browning. Try it - you will love it too!

Fantastic! I threw everything into a crockpot and let it simmer on low all day, just because I was feeling lazy. I also substituted 2 garlic cloves, and threw in 2 cans of tomato sauce, 16 oz of salsa, and a full can of drained dark and light kidney beans. I will be making this again!! Thanks!

I hate chili with a passion!  Always have growing up.  After trying this recipe because I was so desperate to make something different for dinner, I have to say I will be making chili more often.  I'm only sorry I didn't find this recipe sooner (and so is my husband as he loves chili)!  This was incredible!  My husband loved it too.  Thanks littleladyjones!!!

My husband is a huge chili fan and is usually hard to please when it comes to chili. And he said (after one bite) this recipe is a keeper! I used Hot Chili seasoning to spice it up a bit but other than that I made no changes! I will definitely make this again! Love it!

I was trying to find a recipe that would be close to what my BIL used to make as my husband raves about it and this (according to him) came pretty close.  I used a the chili seasoning II mix recipe from this site for the seasoning part, used half hamburger and half ground turkey, ended up adding a can of chili beans and a can of mushrooms and was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.  A keeper!

Fantastic recipe! Husband loved it as well.  Used one package Williams original seasoning, 8 oz. pace piquante sauce medium flavor, can of garbanzos and can of black beans.  Did use one can Rotel with chilies and an extra can of tomato sauce.  Freezes perfectly.  Definitely fast, easy and a keeper!

I thought this was very good, my husband thought it was fantastic.  I did add 1/2 a green pepper and only used 2 Tbsp of Chili powder.  I used 2-19oz cans of kidney beans, but pureed one of them as my daughter really doesn't like beans so I find this is a good way to hide them. I let it simmer for 2 1/2 hours.  Just before serving I added 1 Tbsp white wine vinegar to enhance the flavor of the beef. Will definately make this again.

I made this for dinner the other night and am surprised that after everyone had "just a little taste" before dinner that there was enough left to make it to the table! This is the best chili I have ever had and a definite keeper. I added a little cocoa to it and I had some leftover Rotele tomatoes from another dish I had made so I added those to the recipe...the chili would have been just as great without those additions, too. A five star rating!!

Quick, easy & delicious!  I added a little chopped jalapeno pepper for zing and a can tomato soup w/ 1 can water only because I didn't have enough tomato sauce.   Also used black beans.  This is a keeper!

Made the Deb's Chili for dinner this evening and my husband rated it 5 Stars!  he said he liked it as much as my favorite chili which he has loved since we got married. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for which is something I never do as I love to experiment but in this case I found the recipe so simple and straightforward that I had to see if it was good 'as is' and it was.  I used the middle of the road spiciness in the Pace Sauce and was happy with that.  If you are a "heat" lover this will be too mild for you but the best part is how easily it cam be made spicier in the same number of steps.  Enjoy!

This is the best chili ever! I used all the ingredients and after browning the meat I put it all in my crock pot.  I served over white rice, cheddar cheese on top, slices of avocado.  It was delicious.  I will be making this chili from now on.   Thanks so much!

I agree with previous posts about rating recipes on this site. Therefore, I made this chili as written, and it is very very good. I am taking it to a Super Bowl party to watch my Steelers kick Cardinal butt. I am excited for everyone to try it, and will  post an update. DON'T CHANGE A THING!  Doris from Steeler Nation

This recipe is almost identical to a recipe I use for making Chili and also Mexican Lasagna.  I use Ranch style beans (rinsed) for making Chili, as the  Ranch style beans are so much more flavorful.  For the Mexican Lasagna, omit the beans, and alternate layers of flour tortillas (cut in fourths), meat sauce, sour cream, and mixture of Colby and Monterrey Jack cheese.  Delicious!  Also, I control the heat by the salsa I use - mild, medium, hot, etc.

This is one of the best chili recipes!!  I use it all the time now.  I make it with a homemade chili seasoning mix also found on allrecipes.  I use fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder. I also go with medium salsa and it gives it a nice heat.

This is very similar to a recipe we've used for years as a "throw-down" chili when we've wanted chili but didn't have the time to spend hours cooking down thebeans and so forth. Serve this with cornbread - forget the crackers - either sweet cornbread or jalapeno cornbread. The author uses Williams chili mix but I have also used Cin Chili and Chow Time Chili mixes. They both offer a spicier base. The Cin Chili is from a two-time winner at Terlingua. She's a really nice person, to boot.

This looks very similar to my own chili, though I play around with the seasonings like adding extra cumin.  :D  Also, I throw in about 1/2 Cup frozen kernal corn.  And I agree with a comment already made that it's great 'cooked' in a crockpot!  Tender.  Juicy.  Chili perfection.

This is my basic chili recipe that I've been using for years; I mean these are the basic ingredients I've been using - I've never seen this recipe until it arrived today in my e-mail box. However, I add 2-3 cloves of garlic, chopped and 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of cayenne because I like my chili just a wee bit spicier than most.  I call it my "man-slayer chili" as several relationships have been launched by this concoction.  It's always a hit with men and women ;)

I loved how easy and quick this was! I loved that there was hardly any cleanup or prep. Just out of the can and in the pot! I added a can of diced tomatoes, used less tomato sauce and instead used a 16 oz salsa. I also added more onion and pepper flakes because we like spicy chili. This will be my goto recipe for Chili!

This was a very easy and quick meal to assemble.  I was a little skeptical at first due to the simplicity of it all but the end result was outstanding.  I will add more sauce next time since we like our chili to have more liquid but ultimately we will have this again.

This is a great, simple recipe.  I chose it because of its minimal ingredients.  The only changes I made were to use crushed tomoatos instead of the sauce and I threw in a couple cans of rotel.  Delicious!

Thank you for this recipe.  I've tried several recies and this is my favorite.  I've tried for a long time to make chili without the tangy sour tomato taste.  This recipe takes care of that.  I would have given 5 stars, but I made a few minor changes and I'm still not sure I like the full 2 lbs of meat in it.  It's a little too thick for my taste.  I used Pace Picante Med for the salsa, used kidney beans and black beans, and since I couldn't find William's mix, I used French's Chili-O and added a little sugar. I'm entering this in a church chili contest next weekend!

Update -- My chili was not the favorite.  Almost everyone at church preferred a thinner chili. However my minister would only eat mine and came back for 2nds. Actually, I came home with only enough for 1 more bowl, so it was good, just not the winner.  I think my part of the country is not used to chili being that thick.

I have been in search of the perfect chili recipe for years.  I have spent hours in the past browning pork and beef...dicing and sauteing fresh tomatoes, peppers, garlic and onions...measuring half a dozen spices... and allowing the chili to simmer for hours.  I just threw this recipe together in 15 minutes and it is the best chili I have ever tasted! Definitely use medium Pace Picante Sauce and William's Original Chili Seasoning. Just don't admit how easy this is to make...no one will ever know.

I made this chili exactly as the directions dictated and came out with a chili that was much less then what I had expected.  Overall I was not impressed because it was just your typical meat and beans chili with nothing to make it stand out as "the best".  I can understand why in many of the reviews people reported adding several other ingredients to liven it up.  This recipe is a good base to begin creating your own personal chili but I wouldn't count it as a prize winning recipe.

I made this last night and it was a huge hit.  It was so simple to make.  I added shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream to top it off.  Yum!!

Wow, I've finally found a chili recipe that tastes like actual chili! The great thing about this recipe is that it is simple, pretty quick to prepare (tho you have to wait a few hours for it to simmer), and modifiable. I read a lot of reviews where people changed ingredients and it tasted great! 
Here's what I did: As soon as the meat was browned/onions tender, I added all the spices to the meat and stirred it well (before the sauces). I added some Worschire sauce and one chopped fresh jalepiño. I also didn't have any tomato sauce, but had pizza sauce in my cupboard and that worked just fine! I added all the liquids and a little bit of water because it was too thick, and let it simmer for over 2 hours. I tasted it part way and it was missing something so I added Johnny's Seasoning Salt and that was the trick.
It was soooooooooooooo good.
Thanks for giving me a great chili recipe that I can use over and over! :)

Wow! This is the first time I have ever made chili and it came out perfect! My husband and I loved it!  I read other reviews and here is what I did.  Medium Pace Picante Sauce for the salsa, 1-15 oz jar of Tomato Sauce and 1 can of Rotel Tomatoes.  You can make it as spicy as you want by getting hot Pace or hot Rotel. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Delicious chili recipe...I added a bag of frozen corn to the mix as it was simmering to add some sweetness and texture, and used 2 packages of chili seasoning mix, with extra tomato sauce.  Turned out excellent!

Very nice flavor.  I added 1 small can of corn drained and used black beans in place of the light kidneys.  I also used and entire onion and 1/3 cup of chopped red bell pepper.  The entire family loved it.

This is the best chili I've ever made. I added extra heat by adding a Jalapeno in it. I also added some celery as I like the crunch and topped it with cheddar cheese. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Yummy!!! I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious. It has good directions and is very simple to make. The only things that I changed were using garlic powder instead of garlic salt, adding a few shakes of regular salt, and using double the Pace Picante Medium Salsa. It plopped out of the jar. I plan on making this recipe again soon! The only thing I'd change is adding a few different kinds of beans. Thanks for sharing!

This is the 1st time I've ever made chili. It was extremely easy. Used mild salsa and my husband and I loved it. He said it tasted better than his dads! Using a tip from here, I used 1 can of ranch beans instead of one of the cans of kidney beans. Tastes better than any canned chili I've ever tried!!

I thought this recipe was awesome. I tried to follow it exactly, but I didn't have salsa, so I left that out and put in one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes instead. I also did only 1 lb of beef and extra onions. I'm sure the salsa would have been good too. Both my husband and I really liked it, and it was the perfect spiciness for us. Thanks Deb!

Absolutely love it...we finally found the chili for our family...we'll make it for years to come.  The only thing we did differently was omit onions b/c we don't like them.  It tastes great and makes a good, thick chili...perfect for Frito Chili Pies, Chili Dogs and most importantly, a good bowl of chili!

Awesome chili! First time I ever made chili and the leftovers went so fast! The only thing I changed was adding a little more seasoning (just pulled different spices out of the cupboard and started sprinkling them in to my liking). We ate this for leftovers everyday until it was gone because it was so good!

EXCELLENT recipe! I used Pace picante sauce like Debdoozie suggested, and it turned out great.  It was a big hit, and so easy to personaize the "hot and spicy" level with the kind of salsa used and amount of chili seasoning.  I had to make mine mild for the kids.  Definitely give it a try.

This is amazing chili! It was my first ever time making it and it was a simple and fun recipe to follow. I halved the recipe. I added a little more than 1-1/4 cup of spaghetti sauce and a little more than half of the chili seasoning packet, added 3/4 chopped green bell pepper, 2-3 tablespoons of hot cocoa mix, and 3 jalapenos(one de-seeded, 2 regular). 

Love it! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Perfecto!!!    YUM!   This recipe is AMAZING- and sooo easy!  I've done it stove top and crock pot, and they've both been amazing.  I added 2-3 cloves of fresh pressed garlic.   I love that the recipe uses salsa (i used medium). . . cut down on having to cut up a bumch of peppers and onions, etc.    I made this for a New Year's Eve Party and got a ton of compliments and requests for the recipe.   I will never buy chili again or use any other recipe. Nothing tops this!

Deb, thank you so much for posting this fantastic chili recipe!  I'm not a big fan of really fiery food, so I cut the spice mix in half, and used a mild picante sauce.  (It still had plenty of kick.)  I used 1 lb. of "meatloaf mix" and 1 lb. of regular ground beef, and also added some fresh garlic.  This will be my go-to chili recipe from now on.

Thank you so much.  I get lots of wonderful recipes from this website.

Delicious and EASY! I make this ALL the time! I use Pace Picante mild salsa, 1 package of chili seasoning, and melt some cheddar cheese on top. This would be good with more beans too- but is terrific as is!!!

Very good and quick and easy to prepare.  I used one can of chili magic starter Texas medium, and chunky salsa medium.  It had just the right amount of heat for me and hubby loved it.  It had a nice and think consistancy which I like in my chili.

I'm new to cooking and although I'm really into trying anything I've had a few not so great experiences thus far. Not so with this chili it was amazing, a huge hit with my boyfriend and plenty left over to bring to work the next day where it was revered! 
First time ever being asked for a recipe. I took the advice I found here and used real garlic and tossed everything in the slow cooker on high for about 4 hours. Thank you so much!!

It was good regular chili.  Not Blue Ribbon chili, but good.  I don't think I'd make it again.  There are other better chili recipes out there.  If you do make it, be sure to use a BIG pot.

I made this last night for the giants game, it was win, too bad the giants didn't win. I made a few changes as well like fresh garlic, a can of diced tomatoes with chiles and a can of red kidney beans in sauce as well as adding more salsa then the recipe called for.  My husband is hanging up his chile recipe and has declared me the reigning chile maker!

The flavor of the chili is very good - sweet and tangy.  My wife and I felt as if there were too many beans, and too much hamburger though.  We will use one pound of hamburger, and just one can of beans next go round.  Also, I'm not a huge kidney bean fan, and will most likely use chili beans instead.

I loved it!  I used the entire onion (it was small) but that's all I changed.  I served it to some friends & I just sent them the recipe.  So easy to make!
Updating - I gave been making this recipe a few years now, and I am now *required* to bring this to every party I attend.  Thank you Deb, I am famous for your Chili.

Quick and easy.  My family enjoyed it.  Made minor changes - pulverized beans, mushrooms, zucchini and red and yellow peppers and added.  Family had no idea veggies were in it.  Made enough for leftovers and to freeze for another meal for my family of 5.

Best chili ever. I made one batch "hot, no beans" and one batch "mild, with beans" to accommodate my extended family's tastes, and everyone raved about it. People had 2 or 3 helpings, and my husband and brother finished up the leftovers later that night! 

My only suggestion is to use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.

I registered on this site just so I could review this recipe.  This is the BEST and EASIEST chili recipe I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and added a diced red pepper and a diced green pepper.  I've made this for my husband and his shop and everyone always says it is the best chili they've ever tasted.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I just made this recipe two times in the last month. Once for my husband and me and then once for a potluck at work. It was a hit! I used the hot Pace salsa and I found that it made it moderately spicy. I think next time I will add some chopped jalapenos to make it even spicier. Also, I browned the meat/sauted the ingredients separately (I used onions, garlic and bell pepper) and then added the tomato sauce and salsa and simmered on low/medium heat for a while.

This is the best chili I've ever tasted!  I did use one can of chili beans and one of kidney beans instead of two cans of kidney beans.  I also added fresh garlic while browning the hamburger.  Also, I only used one pound of hamburger and a little less tomato sauce as I don't like my chili quite as meaty and it turned out just perfect!

I can't stop making this chili!  I now add a bottle of Shiner Bock to it and put in 3-4 cans of beans and some jalapenos.  

In the past I've barely been able to stand chili, but this recipe is a pleasure to eat and the meat turns out buttery tender!

Let me add my voice to those who praise this recipe.  It is the easiest, best tasting chili out there. I've been making it for years now.  No other recipe compares. I make very few alterations to the basic recipe.  I usually use a fresh salsa, a can of pinto beans instead of one of the cans of kidney beans and a full packet of seasoning from the "Carrol Shelby's" Texas Chili kit.

This chili is amazing!  Far better than the chili recipe I was using for years.  I always felt that the meat in my chili was slightly bland and boring, the taste lacked depth, and it was far too spicy.  Then I followed this recipe exactly, plus I added a can of black beans, a can of diced tomatoes, and 1/2 a tablespoon of cinnamon.  It tastes wonderful!  The addition of salsa is perfect!  It's the best chili I've had in a long time, and it's so easy to make.  This will undoubtedly be my chili recipe from now on - thanks Deb!!!

The perfect, simple chili recipe that tastes like you’ve been cooking all day. I rarely use all four tablespoons of chili seasoning and always use Pace salsa as someone recommended. Perfection.

This is the BEST chili recipe.  It gives me restaurant quality results every time.  Instead of 2 lbs of hamburger, i use a lb of hamburger and a lb of sausage.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made a few additions. With the ground beef and onion, I sauted a couple cloves of fresh minced garlic. I added a little chopped bell pepper; red, yellow and orange. Used 14 oz of tomato sauce and added 14 oz of diced tomatoes. Omitted the salt and pepper as it's not needed with the use of the salsa and chili seasoning. Used the chili seasoning to taste. After the chili was cooked I put it in the crockpot on low until dinner time. It was fantastic!

Very good recipe! My boyfriend is very picky and he loved it. I did make a few changes as others suggested. I used a 14 oz tomato sauce and a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. I also used a whole package of chili seasonings. After I browned the ground beef and onions, I threw it all in the crockpot and 5 hours later, it was perfect!!!! Thanks so much.

I did what the others recommended. Used two 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and 15 oz of diced tomatoes. Browned the beef with onions and garlic, and put into the crock pot on low heat for around 8 hours. It is very good but still not the best. I actually added two packages of chili seasoning, but the 30% less sodium ones. Added extra 1 tbsp of cumin powder , a tsp of chili powder, and a dash of cayenne pepper.

This is my favorite chili recipe.  It goes together really quickly.  I make it with the chili seasoning from this site and it is great.  The seasoning is a little spicy but terrific.  It warms up great and the other day I was in a little bit of a hurry so we actually ate it after 30 minutes of simmering and I let it finish while we were eating.  It was still great.

What I love most about this chili is that it's SO easy and doesn't take very much time.  A little spicy and could use maybe a small can of diced tomatoes also.

Awesome !! It is now my "NEW" chili recipe. Only thing I did different was change to pinto beans because we do not like kidney beans. I used Pace chunky hot salsa and "wa-hoo", did we feel the heat! Yum and thanks for sharing this easy and good recipe.

This is wonderful, I used 1LB beef, 2tsp chili seasoning, 1 jar mild pace salsa & 1 cup water...it was wonderful and the kids were happy that it was not too spicy.  Served it with cornbread, wish I had doubled the recipe.  Thank you for a keeper!  :)

This was the perfect chili recipe for me.  It leaves lots of room to add your own favorite chili seasonings.  I did some slight changes - added tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes with mild chiles (to equal 2 1/2 cups), used 1 1/2 tbsp of chili powder instead of chili seasoning, added a little cumiin, and of course I seasoned my beef spanish style (adobo, sofrito).  In the end it wasn't too spicy for hubby, and I added my red hot sauce to make the perfect bowl of chili. Went great with the Absolute Mexican cornbread on this site.

This was pretty good. It was such an easy chili to make, I browned ground turkey with fresh garlic cloves and onions and threw the rest of the ingredients into my slow cooker. I served it with cornbread and added some shredded Monterey Jack/Cheddar Cheese.

I have been making this for a couple of years and I never get tired of it.  It's always a hit with people!  Great recipe and so easy to make!  I brown the beef and put everything in a slow cooker.  Sometimes I add fresh jalapenos for an extra kick.

I have used this recipe as a chili refference for a couple of years now. It is always a winner with my friends and family. I add carrots, celery, and mushrooms all chopped pretty small. I also buy the canned beans that are mixed. White, black and red beans all mixed together.

Thanks!

This chili was very good.  I made some small adjustments to the recipe based on what other reviewers recommended: I used one 15oz can of tomato sauce and one 19oz of diced tomatoes (Primo sundried tomatoes).  I also added some red pepper flakes.  To finish it off, I added a spoonful of sour cream, cheddar cheese, and green onions to each bowl.  My husband said it was the best chili he's ever tried and wanted the leftovers for lunch and for dinner today.

This was sooo good and sooo easy!  I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added 1/2 tsp. cumin and 15 oz. pinto beans.  My family loved it but my dad did think that it was a little to hot.  (He likes things pretty bland!)  Maybe reduced the chili seasoning would make it more mild.  Overall, a great chili recipe!  Thanks so much!

I made this chili for a potluck and it got rave reviews.  It is a very meat-based chili, unlike some of the more vegetable/ beans based ones that I prefer.  This is a wonderful recipe if you like alot of meat.  If not, I added lots of garlic, green peppers, onion and tomatoes to give it more of the consistency that I like. :)

My boyfriend makes awesome homemade chili, so I was a little reluctant about making chili for him, but this definitely stood up to the challenge.  I followed the suggestion of Jenn_77 and used one 15oz can of tomato sauce with one 15oz can of diced tomatoes.  I used medium salsa, a whole onion and added 4 habanero peppers since my boyfriend likes spicy, topped it with some Colby/Jack Cheese and the chili came out wonderfully.  My boyfriend even suggested I enter the recipe in our work's annual chili cookoff along side of his.

I wasn't sure if the tomatoes and beans should be drained or not, so I drained the beans but not the tomatoes--I think I should have left them all undrained.  It was still very good, though.

Not very good at all. Maybe it was the chili powder I used. I followed every detail of this recipe. I made this for a Super Bowl party and everyone that took a bowl dumped half of it. I will not be making this again!

It was good but I felt so sick afterwards and I didn't eat that much.  I probably won't make again because that smell just kills me now.

This was really good and easy. I used a whole onion and tossed in some red pepper flakes. It was great and simple. Whip up some cornbread and eat it all nite.

Really, really good.  I thought the recipe looked too simple to be good, but tried anyway.  Only used 3 T of chili powder (ran out), but it still had a decent kick too it.  Only downside is it was too spicy for the kids.

So easy to make and delicious.  A great solution for those who don't like tomatoes in their chili, since the salsa is a perfect substitute for diced tomatoes.

This recipe was extremely easy to make and very tasty.  We added hot salsa to give it a little kick.  Depending on what type of salsa you use, you could really change the flavor of this recipe.  Next time I might try a fruity salsa, such as mango or peach.

Excellent. I used hot salsa and it was a bit spicy for the kids, but my husband loved it! He couldn't stop eating it. Served with corn bread and it made a hearty meal. Will definitely make again.

I wish there was more than 5 stars.  I had never made chili before and don't even really like it but this was terrific.  I added 2 sliced jalapenos and garlic cloves.  Came out perfect!

I left instructions for my 14 year old daughter to make this chili for dinner last night and it was delicious! She followed the recipe exactly except we only put in 1/2 pound of ground beef. That was plenty meat for us. I always bought chili in a can because I never found a recipe that tasted right. Now I have a quick and easy way to make chili. We served our chili topped with cheese and sour cream. Corn bread on the side. Thanks Deb!

Love this chili I did win 3rd place at my local farmers market. I only changed a couple of things instead of 2 cans of kidney beans I used one and one can of ranch beans and added a can of diced tomatoes. I also used the entire pack of grandmas chili season mix. It is my go to chili recipe everybody loves it

I pair this with Sarah’s Chili Seasoning Mix from this site and it is simply delicious! I alter the following for the seasoning mix: 3 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp dry mustard; omit the cinnamon and bay leaf; add 1 tsp ancho chili powder and 1/4 tsp dry unsweetened cocoa. Makes 11-12 Tbs, depending how generous you measure. I use half of this recipe per 2 lbs hamburger. That’s the spice mix; for this chili recipe, I omit the black pepper and garlic salt, use one can each of tomato sauce and Rotell tomatoes and green chilis, and half of the seasoning mix mentioned above. One of the easiest and best tasting chili recipes you will find!

I’ve made this for years now and it is delicious! I’ve tweaked it to become my own and even won a contest with it!  It’s terrific as is, but lends itself too many modifications to personalize your own award winning chili!
I use fresh mild salsa, ground turkey and add corn and black beans ( with the kidney beans) and my own sweet secret ingredient, half a cinnamon stick while it bubbles for a long time on the stove! It is sweet and just a tiny bit spicy and my family adjusts the heat with Chohula hot sauce. It’s requested at every family gathering  and even on vacation in the summer! Enjoy the original and then make it yours. Thank you Deb Doozie for helping me make the best chili ever!

I generally can’t stand when people review with tweaks, so let me first say this recipe is perfection when the directions are followed to a T. That said, I use chili beans in place of dark red kidney beans, half turkey/half beef, and add a 12oz bottle of IPA, 4 oz of coffee, and a packet of beef stock concentrate. I’ve gotten in the habit of making this recipe at least twice a month because it’s so easy and it makes so much - easy to munch through the workweek when things get busy, unless it’s football season in which case we’re lucky to have enough for two bowls after using most of it to make nachos on Sunday!

Just made it New Year’s Day. So easy and perfect for a lazy day. I made it in the crockpot and we ate it all day. If you want some heat put a few dashes is Tabasco in your bowl.

This is a great easy chili recipe.  I use Impossible Ground beef to make it vegan and my husband can’t tell the difference.  I’ve been asked for the recipe several times.

Wow! My husband looked at the recipe and offered to make it, so I said have at it. This was the best chili I've ever had. 

Made according to directions, except he added a tiny bit of red pepper.

I had my doubts about making this chili as I do many, it did not disappoint!  My whole family loved it.  I added a can of Hunts seasoned diced tomatoes in sauce for medium chili and used a can of chili beans instead of two cans of kidney beans.  I did use the Pace Salsa in the medium chunky style and used Williams medium chili seasoning.  Will definitely make again soon!

Since I found this recipe years ago, it's the only chili I've been making! So easy and so good! The only thing different I do is buy Hunt's tomato sauce for chili instead of plain tomato sauce, and for the salsa I get a huge bottle (24oz?) of Pace medium piacane. My packet of chili seasoning is usually hot (we like spice). Love this, you won't be disappointed.

I added some more kidney beans and used a home made chili spice mix from this site.  Very good flavor.

The only change I made was adding a small can of Rotel, Fire roasted tomatoes and chili’s along with everything else Debbie used in this delicious recipe.
I used Williams Chili seasoning and pace medium Picante sauce as Debbie stated! It won second place in a Chili cook off! Thank you Debbie for this wonderful recipe, it’s surely a WINNER!

Just made this today on a whim for my husband and used bison instead of ground beef and it was absolutely delicious!! The bison was a favorite of my husband’s but I’m sure this would be just as yummy without it. The recipe is super simple and can be customized to your family’s preference. I actually had all the ingredients except for one. My husband said this chilli could be bottled and sold! I made a side of cornbread with it and we will be using the little leftover chilli to top our baked potatoes for dinner tomorrow. This is definitely a keeper!!

This chili was wonderful. I did add one can of Rotel original and one can of Rotel Fire roasted tomatoes. I also used about 2.5 pounds of ground chuck and the entire packet of chili seasoning. Topped it with shredded cheese and sour cream. Delicious and easy!

I saw salsa as an ingredient and almost swiped past but the reviews were outstanding so I tried it. My husband saw me add salsa and questioned why I wasn’t making my own chili recipe. We were both so so wrong! This chili is SO AWESOME!! I used mild chunky salsa because I’m adverse to spicy but this is still spicy, but not in a bad way. I used McCormicks Original Chili seasoning which may have added the kick (cumin is included in the seasoning) so I didn’t add any extra. Love this recipe!!! And my husband loves it? Win Win Win!!!!

Easy enough to make, even for the unskilled chef. Flavor is definitely there as well. Pair it with a good cornbread and I'm in heaven.

I make it exactly by the recipe. The ingredients are simple enough. I used ChiChi's salsa. We put some thick cut cheddar cheese and sour cream on top. I added a bit more chili seasoning to it than the recipe called for. I think the brand I used is McCormicks. So good for a cozy, warm meal in cold weather. I am going to use leftovers to make chili dogs next time!

This is a really good, simple chili, and I like that it's fairly spicy- I think chili should have a kick to it. The only thing I would fix is that the flavors could be a little more complex. Maybe an additional seasoning (another commenter suggested cumin, which would probably be excellent) and maybe some corn or green pepper or some other addition to give it a little more variety, and it would have been just right!

This has been my go-to chili for years. I’ll often use just one pound of meat and add an extra can of beans. I also like to add some frozen corn towards the end of simmering.

First chili cookoff I have ever entered.Just won first place with this recipe. I was going against 5 others. I won $100.00  and a blue ribbon. Made it exactly like the recipe. Used McCormmicks Original Chili seasoning and Pace Picante Mild salsa. It was so yummy. Posted a picture of my chili and blue ribbon on here.  Thanks Deb for the recipe.

Fantastic recipe! And I admit, the salsa ingredient threw me- but I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Reviewing as written- it isn’t perfect. This will make a VERY “thick” chili, as is. So, I ended up needing to add in another 1/2 cup of tomato sauce leftover from the large can, and then dumped in the remainder of the 8oz of salsa leftover from the 16oz minimum of the jar. When you let a dish simmer on low for 1 hour- liquid dissipates! When I checked the dish (as written) after 30 minutes- it was THICK & DRY! It was necessary to add the “extra” remaining liquids. 1/2 an onion also depends on the SIZE of onion. I ended up using an entire small (baseball size) onion & still felt I had to add a bit of onion powder to gain the proper ratio. 

As far as flavor goes- this is really good! One of the basic chili seasoning packets from McCormick is the equivalent of 4Tbsp. (I wish the recipe would have hinted towards or stated that!) But this is also one you may want to sit overnight & let the flavors seep. I found it to be much more delectable the 2nd day. Reheating is a breeze! And it goes perfect with cornbread. Definitely keeping thing one, but adding more tomato sauce, entire jar of salsa & some additional beans because the quantity of ground beef is a bit on the heavy side for only 2 cans of kidney beans. I also added a pinch of cumin & garlic, and topped with some shredded cheddar to serve. 

I can’t say it it “award winning” in comparison to recipes that take a handf

I made it as instructed. It's only fair. The salsa is Medium Pace Picante and 1 pkg. of 1.25 oz McCormicks Chili seasoning mix.
 I also did not drain as fat is flavor and did not drain chili beans. 
 Do not cover but use a splatter screen to reduce sauce without making a stovetop mess. 
It really does remind me of Wendy's Chili. I LOVE IT.

Very good. Used 2 TBL spoons chili powder instead of 4.  Very hot for children still. Would add 1 and then see where we stand. Used chili diced tomatoes instead of salsa. Pureed 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Added a little brown sugar.

This was delicious! I only had 1 lb of beef, so I used Bob's Red Mill TVP to supplement the meat, and used a packet of taco seasoning and one dried chipotle pepper for extra kick.  It was a hearty meal served with rice and biscuits (basic biscuit recipe from this site), roasted cauliflower and mixed salad.

I made this recipe with no changes and entered it in my church’s “Men’s Chili Cookoff”.  I had never made it before, and I’m not a good cook.  I’m a precise recipe follower, not a creative cook.

I was surprised when they announced that it had won.

I was shocked that something this easy won, but it did.  No changes, just followed the recipe.  Worked well.

This is a delicious, easy chili! It took me about 30 mins to prep. I used medium picante sauce for the salsa and Williams original chili seasoning like OP recommended and I thought it was a tad spicy, but I’m a bit of a wimp on spice haha. I made it primarily for someone else who likes things spicy, so I think it will go over great!

Well it taste great! I must also admit that this is my first chili ever! With that said it’s not my first time eating chili. The wife makes a mild chili that is very good and it has mushrooms in it so I added mushrooms to this recipe. I believe I will enter this in our next chili cook off!

This was very easy and very delicious! One reviewer stated that she drained the kidney beans. I wasn't sure whether to do this or not so I drained one can and not the other. It was so thick I had to add some beef broth, so I definitely wouldn't recommend draining the beans. I used medium Pace Picante sauce and McCormick hot chili seasoning. I also let it simmer for almost three hours. Yum!

This is a great chili recipe- and I think the secret is the salsa- just never occurred to me to add it-I only used a lb of ground turkey & half the amount of chili seasoning & tomato sauce for a smaller pot but this is just a great recipe no matter how many servings you need.

I have made this so many times.  Just entered into chili constest on Sunday...won first place.  I used Hot Pace Picante, but the rest just store brand kidney beans light and dark and store brand taco seasoning and store brand tomato sauce, so only brand name I used was the Pace Picante.  I did use three pounds of ground beef instead of two, we like our meat. LOL
Yummy I handed out recipe and everyone couldn't believe how easy and economical of a recipe this was.  Thanks for sharing.  Whole huge pot of chili, $21.00, fed a crew.

I've made this recipe as is and it is fantastic. I have also changed it up a few times here and there. I now don't use salsa but Rotel instead and I add cumin. I also use chilli beans instead of the red beans. I have made it using beer and also have added celery and used steak before. It's a great base chilli recipe and just play with it until it hits the right spot for you and your family!

this chili was amazing. all I added was one can of Rotel and that was only because I had it lying around for a while and it was feeling unappreciated.

This was very good. Only simmered it for a half hour because we were hungry. I halved the recipe because there are just two of us and there’s plenty for lunches tomorrow. I accidentally added the full packet of chili seasoning because I didn’t read the recipe close enough and it was just fine.  I did add a quarter of a green pepper, chopped and I think it was a good addition. Served with Freetos. Highly recommend.

I made it for the first time today. I was not able to get Williams seasoning. But followed the recipe exactly...for a mild chili category and won first place! What fun! I’m going to see if I can order Williams on line and see what the difference is. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

This was a huge hit for my family this evening!  I have six kids who can be pretty picky eaters and they all went back for seconds!  I had to make a few minor changes to the recipe so I wouldn’t have to make a trip to the grocery store.  Instead of using ground beef I started with a frozen 2 1/2 lb beef roast with the whole jar of salsa (Herdez) in the crockpot, turned on high.  I cooked about 4-5 hours until roast was tender.  Took roast out, trimmed off fat, shredded beef into nice bite-size chunks and skimmed some fat off liquid in crockpot before adding shredded beef back to crockpot.  I then added the rest of ingredients minus one of the cans of tomato sauce I was short on.  I had to replace with about 3/4 cup of chicken stock to thin a little.  I cooked for another hour on high.  I served with shredded cheese, sour cream and deep-fried corn tortilla chips (from grocery store bakery).  Thank you for your recipe!  It was a big help as I was able to use groceries I already had on hand!

I was optimistic about this recipe due to the high ratings. If I could give this chili recipe more stars, I certainly would. I rarely use recipes, as I prefer to throw stuff together and create my own dishes, but I have to serve 30 to 40 men at my church tomorrow night. Though my kids have always loved my chili, they rarely complain about anything I cook. I wanted to try this recipe out before serving those men, so my kids and I had this for dinner tonight. I went back to get seconds and the pan was practically licked clean. We LOVED it and I am thrilled to have a new chili that will replacing my old. I followed the recipe EXACT, as I felt that is the only true way to leave a fair rating, and it came out absolutely delicious!!! Thank you Deb for this amazing chili recipe!

I used elk meat and used little more than half of the pepper.  This is great chili and I have to admit, better than my mothers!  I like my chili thicker than hers, and make it that way.  Very tasty.

I made 4 times the recipe to serve to a crowd.  It was well-received.  I ended up not using 4 times the quantity of beans, however, because it seemed that amount was going to be too much.  I served it with a cheese blend on the side for topping.

I liked the fact that this recipe called for tomato sauce and salsa. So I decided to use that and dress it up a bit more.  I made it with ground turkey meat and added minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  Since I am gluten free, I didn't use the chili seasoning mix.  Instead, I used chili powder, paprika, salt, pepper, oregano, sugar, basil and oregano.  I also ground up a red pepper and 2 jalapeño peppers to spice it up and a whole onion.  I sauted the ground up red peppers and jalepenos and 1/3 cup of the onion in butter for 4 min. until tender.  I used a can of green chilis and 1 can black beans and 1 can of kidney beans and cooked it for 20 min. to let the flavors blend.  I tested it on my grandkids and the pot was gone in 15 min.  They were coming back for more!!!!  They LOVED it!!!! I know I added a lot and it isn't the same recipe as above, but the chili seasoning mix has gluten and I like using my own spices anyways.  My grandkids raved and told me it was way better than my other recipe.  They liked that one okay, but I decided I wanted  to feed them something that they would really like.  So happy I found this one to use.  Thanks

This is now our base chili recipe. We change it up to suit our tastes---we like black beans, pinto beans and kidney beans in our chili, and also like to add a can or two of fire roasted tomatoes instead of plain tomato sauce or plain tomatoes. I love the idea of how adaptable this recipe is. If you have guests that can't handle heat, just use a mild salsa, or crank up the heat if it's just for us. Leftovers are delish next day also!!

As I was making this, I worried my family was going to turn their nose up to it since normally when I make homemade chili, it's def not an easy recipe like this.  Both kids and husband said it was really good, as good as my any other chili I have made.......I will be saving this one and using it whenever I want to make a quick and easy while tasty dinner

Because I did not have all ingredients on hand.  I substituted 1 can of Rotel Original for the salsa and black beans for the dark kidney beans.  Because I did not have enough tomato sauce, I  also used whole tomatoes in the food processor.

This was simple and delicious. The only thing I wasn’t sure of was if I had to drain the kidney beans or not. I ended up draining and the chili ended up needing liquid so I added 1/2 cup of water.

This is my "go to" weeknight chili recipe. I seem to always have the ingredients on hand to make it work. One can of tomato sauce is almost two cups and I didn't want to open another can so I just added about 3/4 of a small can of tomato paste. I use two cans of whatever beans I have and don't drain them (kidney and black beans were in tonight's meal). I also didn't have chili seasoning on hand, so I made my own with chili powder, onion powder, cumin, garlic salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Love this chili! Thank you Deb!

This is my go-to for homemade chili. Turns out perfect every single time! Rich, thick and full of flavor. I don’t like chili to spicy so I always use mild salsa and mild chili seasoning. Thank you for this great recipe:)

WOW!! Just won my first ever chili cook-off with this recipe. Only change I made was per one of the reviews when I halved the tomato sauce with diced tomatoes. Also, I left out the beans. Texas chili has no beans! Must not have made much difference to the taste because I WON!!

I loved this recipee. changes I made were: 1 1/2 lbs hamburger, 1/2 lb hot ground sausage, 2 15 oz cans tomato sauce, 1 can dark red kidney beans, 1 can spicey chili beans, hot red pepper, 1/2 tbs butchers blend black pepper, 1 clove garlic, medium salsa, and cayenne pepper (amount is personal preference). While brown the meat, I added all ingredients in a slow cooker. I added the meat when down browning and let it cook on low all day.

I’m rating this recipe as written. In my opinion, it’s a bit bland and just average. A lot of this recipe depends on prepackaged chili seasoning, which varies greatly from brand to brand. The author of this recipe admitted that the particular brand she used is difficult to find (and I could not find it) and resorted to McCormick’s Mild Chili Seasoning. After simmering for 90 minutes, I was unimpressed. That is where the 3 stars come from. It’s not horrible, but it’s not spectacular. It would work nicely in a pinch if your using it as a supplement to another dish, like chili dogs, taco salad, etc. It really doesn’t work as a stand-alone dish.

I try to make recipes on this site the first time exactly as written. Used Pace Picante Mild as suggested. I couldn’t find Williams Chili Seasoning so used McCormick. Half teaspoon of salt and half teaspoon of garlic powder. Three small cans of tomato sauce. Let it simmer for 2 hours and served over rice with sour cream, shredded cheese and Fritos as toppings. So easy and surprisingly good too! It was a little mild for my tastes but hubby thought it was perfect so I may use Pace medium next time.

This chili was amazing.  I'm not known for my culinary prowess, but my family loved this!  I prepared exactly as recipe called for.  The only adjustment I made is after browning and draining ground beef, I put everything into a crock pot for about 5 hours. I served with sour cream and Mexican blend cheese.

I picked this recipe to enter a chili cook off and I won! Very easy to make. The only thing I changed was to add mushrooms. I know it may seem weird to have mushrooms in chili but everyone loved it. I couldn’t find the Williams Chili Seasoning in my area so I ordered it from Amazon. Well worth it! Great recipe!

We used ground turkey instead of beef, and I swapped out the light kidney beans for chili beans. I draines the dark kidney beans before adding them. Besides that, I left the recipe as is and served with sour cream and shredded cheddar. It’s our go to recipe. It’s quick and easy and the kids love it. They always ask for seconds.

I add black beans and pinto beans to the mix, but that's all I really change. It's just so good.

This is my new favorite chili recipe. I made it exactly as written. What I really liked about it is that less of the chili seasoning mix is used and flavors are added from other ingredients. I didn’t realize how big of a difference that would make. We topped ours with corn chips and are looking forward to adding this to the rotation.

Winner! For the less experienced cooks (like me) 2 1/2 cups of tomato sauce = three 8oz cans, and 4 Tbsp chili seasoning = 1 pkg of Williams Original. Just because of our taste pallet, I added additional chili powder, garlic powder, ground cumin, kosher salt and half of a beer at the end. Deeeeelish!

GREAT CHILI!  I changed 3 things...I used buffalo instead of beef, added a can of rotela fire roasted tomatoes and put in a red and green pepper.   Other than that...followed the recipe to the T.  So Good.  I never thought of putting salsa in chili, but I think it's the ingredient that really makes it.  Oh yeah, I put it in a slow cooker.  I  think I will never make chili any other way for now on.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I adjusted the recipe to make 3lb.  Ground beef. 

I used the Chili Seasoning Mix by Terri on this site, to this I did add 2t of Chili powder.

Because it was was a little thinner than I like I  made a ruex w 2t of AP flour, stirred in and let it simmer 1.5 hours...it was thick and hardy,  its jusr RIDICULOUS ?? how good this chili is.  It's the best Chili I've ever made, actually the best I've had.

This chili was absolutely delicious, it was delicious fresh off the stove and it's even better today!

It is a phenomenal chili recipe that I will most certainly make many more times. 

THANK YOU FOR SHARING DEB!!!! 

IT REALLY IS SO SOOOO GOOD!

Really good. First time making chili and I would recommend this recipe, pretty easy. I made a couple of adjustments, added liquid smoke, added some italian sausage, stuff like that. Made mine with cornbread and I really liked it. A bit on the hot side (I dont like spice too much) but tasty.

I gave the recipe 5 stars because my son who likes the right amount of spice said the chili was delicious. I made some minor adjustments:  I used the recipe from Chili Seasoning Mix II with 2 Tbls. of flour, 15 oz of tomato sauce and 1can of Rotel  tomatoes with habaneros “hot”.

I’ve been making this chili recipe for many years and don’t know why I haven’t reviewed it before now.  It really is a ‘blue ribbon’ winner and a family favorite!  I always seem to have everything on hand and probably make it once a month or so because it is so easy to put together, nutritious, and delicious!  We buy grass fed ground beef on sale and keep it in the freezer, beans & tomato sauce from Costco.  I always use 4 different cans of beans (red kidney, white kidney, black, garbanzo or pinto) as they’re so nutritious and it stretches the chili for a few days and freezes well.  I also add some Trader Joe’s green salsa along with the red salsa to give it an extra zing but only use about 1/4 tsp. black pepper because  my husband’s stomach is sensitive.  Shredded cheese finishes it off.  This is also a great vegan dish by omitting the meat and cheese.

My young teenage son wanted to make some chili.  I am so happy we found this recipe.  It was easy to make and didn't have a long list of ingredients like some others. He tweaked it by eliminating the onion and only doing 1/8 tsp. of black pepper.  It was delicious and he was so proud of himself!

First time in my life I’ve ever left a review for a recipe. This chili is amazing!!! Great flavor and a little bit spicy but I used original chili seasoning cause I couldn’t find mild. Husband absolutely loved it! The only thing I’ll be changing next time is adding a half cup of water as I like mine with a little more juice. The end result was a really thick chili. Definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who is currently searching for a nice chili recipe right now online!!!!

This is the best chili ever. I've made it for several years now. I use ground turkey most of the time though just to make it healthier.

I have been making this chili for years and it's always a hit. Through the years I have made a few tweaks - I use half ground beef and half Italian sausage. I use fresh garlic and omit the garlic salt and I usually add more salsa.

I liked this very easy version of chili.
I did use garlic powder on place of the salt.
I used mild salsa. then added a little tabasco sauce.
I will make it again when I'm in a rush for chili.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this chili!  Per the comment by the author of the recipe, we used Pace picante sauce in place of the salsa.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  We will definitely be making this again.

We have been making this chili for several years now. It is my husband’s favorite. We have been having a chili cook off at work for the last three years and I took third of this year. I always get a lot of compliments on it.What prompted me to write a review though is that someone in a previous review wrote that it was like canned chili. Nothing could be further from the truth. At my brother-in-law‘s request we recently made chili dogs using his favorite canned chili. We didn’t even finish the can and I didn’t finish my hotdog with that canned chili on it.  My brother-in-law is getting the extra cans of chili we bought! We have been having a chili cook off at work for the last three years and I took third this year. I always get a lot of compliments on it.

this was so easy and delicious! I did tweak it a bit. I added a couple of splashes of hot sauce for extra spice, corn, oregano, cumin and topped it with cheddar cheese. maybe it was the chili pack i bought i thought it was missing something. I will definitely make it again. even my brother raved about how it was better than the NYC restaurant he works at.

TO DIE FOR!  Delish is the only words for this.  I made this using a crock pot to simmer for a tailgate party at work and used the Chili seasoning Mix II recipe.  I wanted to use New Mexico Chili powder, but could not find any, so I purchased the dried ones at the grocery store, toasted them for 5 minutes on 325 (until you start to smell them),let them cool and ground them up in a dedicated coffee grinder I use for spices.  Gave it just the right amount of kick.  Not overpowering at all.  I LOVED this!  It was a huge hit and got lots of compliments.  Make it and you will not be sorry!  **Warning** You may want to make two batches because one will be gobbled up faster than you realize!!

I have never made chili before this.  And I haven't eaten much chili in my life so I do not have too much to compare it to but the 15+ people that i made it for said it was some of the best chili they have ever had and they all made and ate chili their whole lives.

I made this chili for a family chili cook off get together and this was the favorite out of five different chili's. I used kidney beans that were from Bush that had chili seasoning and also a can of Bush chili flavored pinto beans. I did tweak it with green peppers and  a few more spices and added a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce. 
I think what made my chili the favorite was that this recipe had the jar of salsa. I will now add salsa to my chili.

I’ve experimented with many chili recipes over the years. This is hands-down the best chili recipe. It’s easy, quick & super delicious.  I follow the recipe & have added green chilies, chopped bell pepper & some extra tomato sauce on occasion.

I was hesitant to try this recipe but couldn’t find my normal go to recipe. Glad I did, not only is very tasty but easy to put together! I used mild pace picante sauce with 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can diced tomatoes for texture (14.5 oz each). Also for added texture I used 1# ground sirloin and 1# cubed stew meat cut into small pieces. Along with the light and dark kidney beans I added a can of pinto beans with jalapeños.  For the chili seasoning I used 1 packet of McCormick, and fresh minced garlic in place of garlic salt.  I will definitely be making again but will try with medium pace picante sauce because I feel it can use alittle more heat! Thanks for sharing!

Just wow!  Made one change...I used Taco Seasoning instead of Chili Seasoning because that’s what I had. Thanks for a great recipe...so easy and good. The Picante is definitely the secret...

I made it per instructions.  It was just ok, not a bad chilli but did not live up to the reviews. I put in the ref and warmed up the second day as chilli is usually better the second day....still  not impressed.  I added a T of brown sugar and that helped but it is still lacking.  I will use to make Nachos with and it  is certainly a good chilli..just not a great chilli.

Made this twice so far and so yummy! For the salsa I used pace picante in medium, for the chili seasoning I used this brown bag blue ribbon one I found at my grocery store. I added a can of whole peeled tomatoes, because my husband likes them in his chili. So yummy! Haven't tried it at a chili competition yet, but plan on it!

After reading the reviews, and having been invited to a chili cook-off, I had to try it.  Winner, hands down!  The recipe was easy to prepare and won first prize.  Can’t ask for anything more!  Thanks so much for the recipe, it’s a keeper.

My husband loved this recipe. I did make a few changes: I didn't have garlic salt so i substituted with garlic powder and salt. I added extra beans as I like a lot in my chili and I also used a whole pack of chili seasoning to make it spicier.  I will definitely be making this recipe again but  next time I wont't drain the beans as I think it made it taste a bit dry. Besides the dryness, I though this recipe was great!

Yummy! I made this on a "chilly" Halloween night and it was a big hit! Used one can of Bush's medium chili beans, one can black beans and one can dark red kidney beans. Used one package of McCormick's medium chili seasoning.  Also added extra ground beef so need a little more tomato sauce as it was very thick. All in all, a big winner with several recipe requests.

Awesome.  I ended up using almost 2.5 lbs of beef because that’s what I had and it was still great, though I added a touch more salsa.

I made this tonight, and it is REALLY good. The flavor will vary greatly depending on which chili seasoning mix you use, and the salsa will make it vary quite a bit. I used a mild, unchunky Texas home-made salsa, and the seasoning mix came from this recipe on Allrecipes.com: Chili Seasoning Mix II 

I found it slightly lacking in a bit of a bite, so I added about 1 tsp of chili powder and 1 heaping tablespoon of fresh minced garlic, also about 1 tsp of onion powder. It still has to simmer a bit longer, but I think this is the best chili I have ever made. A perfect medley of smokey sweet flavor. I wonder if a tiny bit of paprika could add to that flavor...Well, something to try for the next time. 

This is a great recipe, super simple, and tasty!

I made this recipe last night for a chili cook off tonight. I was knocked out over how easy it was to prepare but truthfully the flavor seemed a little off last night. I chilled it over night and this afternoon got it out and put in the crockpot to gently heat. I was so pleased when I tasted it after warming. The off flavor was gone, and the consistency was thick and perfect! I did add some extra chili powder for my own personal taste, but it was really good just as listed!

I have made this recipe over a dozen times! every time it comes out excellent! I would use fresh ground beef because the flavor is a little different if you use cheap ground beef. It's quick, easy and Hearty to feed a family or crowd. In fact they always have the ingredients on hand.

I was really excited about making this based on all of the rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. A few ambiguous points were wether or not to drain the beans and, for obvious reasons, the brand of Chili seasoning and Salsa. I found the dish to be over salty and under seasoned.

We were having a chili cook-off at work and I wanted to enter...so I researched for recipes online. I came across this one and I was intrigued because it had 5 stars...I read the reviews and decided I was going to give it a try...it did not fail!!! I won first prize. I made it almost exactly like the recipe with exception of adding black beans and ground sausage...everyone was asking for a bowl of chili #3...it sold out so fast...this has now replaced my granny's recipe

This is literally the BEST chili I’ve ever had! Made this on impulse one chilly evening as I had almost everything on hand and I’m so glad I did! I brought the leftovers to my sister and family and they couldn’t quit raving about it! We’re not exactly “chili” people but this is incredible. I made a few slight modifications by using turkey instead of beef, adding a full onion, a bit more chili seasoning than it called for and also a few heavy dashes of Worcestershire sauce and it turned out absolutely perfect. I’ll be making this again this weekend per the family’s request.

This IS the easiest chili you will ever make.  Super tasty too.  Took it to a teacher appreciation lunch and I had multiple notes left on my pot at the end of the event asking me to forward the recipe!   I did couple embellishments however...  instead of 2 cans of Kidneys I subd. with a can of  Bush's chili beans in  mild chili sauce   I also used 1/2 beef and 1/2 turkey breast and I cooked the meat in 1/2 C of red wine, and I simmered it for 3 hours before serving.  It was DELICOUS.  Way to go Deb!

I followed the recipe and only changed the serving size since it was just for me.   It tasted even better on day two.  Will definitely be making this again.

I didn't like this chili at all followed it exactly with recommend picante sauce.  it was better if you add cheese and sour cream to it and eat it with fritos.

This chili is delicious.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe and never do.  I've made it four times and it's in our regular rotation.  Needs no tweaking at all.  My family of three loves it and it lasts for two nights.  First night chili with cheese and sour cream.  Second night delicious as a nachos topping.  A+++

Very easy and delicious - I have tried many "quick" recipes that fail to match the taste of slow cooked chili.  This recipe is just as good as chili that takes days to make.  Everyone we serve this to loves it as well!

Instead of the kidney beans, I use one can of black beans, and one can of corn. We love it! I also like to kick up the spice a bit.

I have made this recipe more than once and it is SOOOO BORING but it can be turned into something amazing!  Here is what I added to the recipe to bring out some bold flavor and to make it a 10+:  Add 1 can italian stewed tomoatoes (14 oz), 3/4 tsp dijon mustard, 2 cloves garlic, 2 green bell peppers diced, salt to taste, 2 tsp honey, two dashes of worstechire sauce.  If you add these ingredients before you simmr for an hour it will go from blah to fantastic!  My guests LOVE the better version and I had a house full of people who couldn't believe that I could turn the blah chili into something amazing.  Wish I had doubled the recipe!

Delicious!  I have found my go to chili recipe!  I used 8 oz of salsa, a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and one can of mild Rotel.  I pureed all of that before adding the beef.  Next time, I'll cut the ground beef to 1 lb. and cut down a little on the black pepper.  I used mild chili seasoning and the flavor was great.  I threw it in the slow cooker on low for about 5 hours, and it was perfect at suppertime.

I wish there were more stars because this is 10-stars. Most easy chili to make ever! Tons of flavor. Meaty. I add an extra can of beans. I've made this chili about 5 times. So good!

Really great chili!  I made a few changes... I was making a larger batch for a chili contest, so I doubled everything, plus added a couple of pounds of pork sausage.  Also used the whole packet of chili seasoning, versus just 4 tsp.  And I chopped up two jalapeño chilis (deseeded, of course) for good measure, too.

Very tasty and very easy! The salsa is key, so don't leave it out. Very easy to adjust recipe to accommodate individual needs. I was cooking for my parents who can't handle too much spice anymore (Dad's 78); so I made this chili with mild versions of the chili powder and salsa. My parents love chili but have been avoiding it for the past few years.

The recipe was still excellent, even with the mild chili powder and mild salsa.  If you (or someone you cook for) has a problem with spicy or hot dishes, I can recommend this chili. Just don't lessen the amount of chili powder too much,  I used the amount called for and it wasn't too spicy but enough to actually taste like chili. A dollop of sour cream is a tasty topper and helps mellow the spiciness further (Dad's chili). Serve with bread, as well, I find that helps soothe the stomach.  I grated some Monterey Jack to top Mom's chili (her stomach isn't quite as sensitive as Dad's). For myself, I topped my serving with Pepper Jack cheese to up the heat a bit.  
 I'm looking forward to making  this chili again (very soon!) when I'm cooking just for myself. I'm sure regular chili powder and hot salsa would be perfect for me. Chili freezes and reheats quite well, IMO. I'll  freeze it in individual servings and it will be perfect for lunch at work. A whole pot of chili just for me, LOL!

this was amazing! i didnt use the salsa brand which DEBZ recommended, just used the cheapest one i could find in the supermarket. But it still turned out great! 
NOTE to myself would be to eliminate garlic salt altogether and use real garlic (not garlic powder which also has some salt in it i think?) because the addition of all the canned beans and seasonings and salsa already has alot of sodium inside - i think my chilli became a bit too salty because of that!

I've been using this recipe for the past year and it's amazing! The only changes I made are I use one can of kidney beans and one can of pinto beans (because I have a pinto bean enthusiast in my house). I also generally use ground turkey instead of beef. So good!

Made this recipe for the first time ever for a chili cook off at work.  I won!  I added 1 more can of sauce.  Next time I will add some Jimmie Dean or Bob Evans sage ground sausage, and use The Pace Hot Picante instead of medium. Everyone wanted more heat. Great recipe!

I make this recipe once or twice a month during ski season.  Everyone loves this and it's so easy to make.  I substitute Chi Chis hot salsa and use a whole pack of McCormicks hot chili seasoning to give this dish a medium kick.  We laugh as this awesome dish will be one of the recipes my son makes at college.

I made this last week, left out the onion, and used canned "chili beans" instead of the kidney beans as listed.  It was excellent, and even great as leftovers the following few days.  Husband has asked me to make it again already.

I love it. It couldn't be simpler: brown the meat, throw in all the ingredients, and simmer. One pot and done. It was pretty mild, which is fine for me, but you can always add more seasonings if you like your chili spicier. This is a great basic recipe that you can easily adjust any way you like. I'll definitely make this again!

All I can say is awesome. I added four chopped jalapeños and half a cup of water and let simmer most the day. Topped it with Mexican cornbread, loved this recipe.

It was just okay.  It had wayyy too many beans.  And it was just normal chili:   nothing special about it except for the fact that it was extremely easy.  It was a little spicy with the Medium Picante Sauce, so I would make it with Mild if you prefer to individualize your chili.  I just like more veggies in my chili and more cumin.

Won Tasters Choice at a Chili Cook Off!  Surprising for someone who cooks at Thanksgiving, maybe.  Tried variations with salsa from scratch, but used the jar salsa and replaced tomato sauce with jar of spaghetti sauce with roasted garlic (not traditionally other spaghetti flavoring).  Only entered contest to help the fundraiser.  Won on two fronts!    
**** UPDATE ***** Entered Chili Cook Off again this year and won again using salsa from scratch and no spaghetti sauce, just canned tomatoes.    Still a winner recipe!

Great recipe and love that most items you'll have on-hand.  Add shredded cheddar, chopped green onions and a dollop of sour cream if you like. Yum!

I always come back to this recipe!  Simple and tasty!   Sometimes I substitute sirloin for one of the pounds of ground beef just to bulk it up.

I have made chili using a recipe that I had for years. My husband was upset that I was trying this one because he liked the one I was using. So I made chili using this recipe and my husband LOVED it! We have now replaced our old recipe with this one:-) Very easy to make!

Very delicious recipe.  Used the Pace salsa as was recommended.  My family loved it.  Mother in love had multiple helpings and that says a lot.  DD inhaled it and as a picky toddler that's always a good thing.  DH and DS also enjoyed it.  I will make again.

I saw this "award winning" recipe in a work contest and that is exactly what I was looking for!    My competition had been planning and testing their chili for weeks and I selected this recipe the night before and stopped to buy the ingredients on the way home.   I WON first place and was told there wasn't any competition.

Thank you for sharing!!

This is excellent!!  After reading other reviewers' suggestions, I added some chopped green pepper and tomato, as well as some brown sugar.  I also added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce (always a good idea with any beef-based soup or stew, in my opinion).  Finally, I did not have pre-made chili seasoning, so I made my own (see Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe).  Everybody loved it!  Will definitely make again.

This is a keeper for a basic, easy to alter recipe.  I changed it up a little to suit my family's tastes.  I used a pound of ground beef and a pound of mild Italian sausage, threw in about 3T of crumbled bacon, and cooked it with the onions, minced garlic, and some hot chili powder since we like extra heat in our chili.  For the salsa, I used a jar of chipotle salsa, which gave it a nice smoky flavor, and I omitted the garlic salt since I used fresh garlic in the beginning.  The result was a nice, spicy chili that had a good depth of flavor.  It was great on a chilly night!

I just made a couple changes and I don't think they made it any better it's just what I had on hand.  I used white kidney beans and near the end of cooking added one cup of frozen corn and I also had some Frozen New Mexico mild Hatch Chiles that I defrosted and minced and added 1/2  cup for a little more heat.   what Terrific recipe.

My husband normally makes our chili (and it's AMAZING), but I decided after all these years to make it. He said from this point on he will use this recipe. The only thing I changed was using about 3 1/4 cans of kidney beans. I may try and add some cumin next time to see if it adds to the flavor although it doesn't really need help. DEFINITELY try this recipe. It won't let you down.

I am used to getting at least double this amount of ingredients for chili, so I was very surprised at how delicious it was. I have never used chili seasoning before, so I didn't know it contained salt. I added salt to the onion when sautéing and added salt to the meat when I was browning it, so my chili ended up being pretty salty, but still great. This is so easy and fast, I know I'll make it again and again!

We really enjoyed this chili! Especially how easy it is. I've made many chili recipes that were much more complicated and we liked this better. I only used 1 lb of ground beef but left everything else the same and it turned out perfect. I also used a 28 oz can of tomato sauce (that's about 2 1/2 cups) and the whole packet of chili seasoning. Yum!

Extremely easy, even for a a guy with limited abilities in the kitchen.

Absolutely delicious taste as it's spelled out here, but the beauty of this chili is that it's so flexible. I have experimented with adding various sources of spice and I'm always delighted. 

I highly recommend this chili. Every time I make it, people want a Tupperware full.

I LOVE this recipe! After making this so many times, I've made just a few alterations. SO GOOD! I use 1 lb of pork sausage and 1lb of beef (instead of 2lbs beef) I also add 1 clove of garlic (minced), 1/4 cup of brown sugar, a can of rotel, and a small can of mushrooms (6.5oz). Yum!!

This recipe was perfect! The only thing I added was 1/4 of brown sugar just to add a little sweetness. My husband and I don't like much spice. This is my new go-to chili recipe for cold winter days!

I love making this chili! It's quick and simple, but tastes exactly how chili should. I've made it so many times that I remember the recipe by heart! Because I'm a working mom, I usually throw the ingredients in the crock pot before work (this tastes great), but there's nothing like simmering for 2 hours stove top. My only chili recipe. Deb, you ROCK!

Delicious chili recipe! I wouldn't call it the greatest chili I've ever had, but it's definitely worth making again. I only had a pound of hamburger on hand, so that's what I used and it came out great. Next time I will use 1 1/2 pounds, because I think the 2 pounds of meat that is called for would be too much...(along the lines of "having a few beans with your meat"). If you can't handle much spice, I would make sure to use mild salsa (as the chili seasoning added is plenty spicy). A winner!

This is absolutely delicious!  The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, and although it was wonderful, it was a bit thick for my taste.  Now I normally only use one pound of ground beef, or I'll add some tomato juice to thin it down a tad.  I use the Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe from this site and homemade salsa I canned this summer in place of store-bought salsa.  I also put a whole onion versus 1/2 and a couple of cloves of garlic.  To quote my husband, this chili is "the bomb."

Great chili recipe, which I've refined over the years to suit our tastes.  Instead of 2 lbs of ground beef, I split 1 lb of ground beef with 1 lb of Hot or Sweet Italian sausage.  Cook both in Liquid Smoke and Worcestershire.  Also we love beans so I add one extra can of dark kidney beans.  The tomato sauce is a very important flavor component, usually a good one with garlic in it does great.  We've tried the mushroom tomato sauce, it was definitely not for us.   A can of fire roasted tomatoes is also a great addition.  Thanks for posting this one so long ago, it's been a great staple in our meals!

I was trying to find a recipe that was easy to put together, this recipe didn't disappoint. I was a bit skeptical about adding the picante sauce into it, because I'm not a picante sauce fan. So, I put it in my bullet blender first to make it smooth instead of chunky, Turns out I really liked the addition of it to the chili.

Yum! Probably the best traditional chili recipe I've found. I used a can of chili beans instead of a second can of kidney to replace the chili seasoning mix and have a little variety. Killed two birds with one stone.

My husband likes thick chili, but this stuff is super thick...like you could eat it with a fork thick.  It was delicious, but the 2nd time I made it, I doubled the tomato sauce and salsa (I used Herdez salsa) and it was the perfect consistency for us.  Also, I do throw in one large can of Bush's chili beans (pinto) instead of dark kidney beans.  I  also throw in a dash of cayenne pepper since our chili mix (McCormick's) isn't super spicy...My husband LOVES this chili and so do I.  Perfect amount of heat!

I looked up the highest rated chili recipe on the site to take to a church chili cook-off. Great strategy! We won! My husband threw a ton of other stuff in the pot since we didn't have a chili mix packet.

I did not win my company's chili cook-off but the recipe was easy and very tasty. We loved it. The hardest part was browning the ground beef and chopping the onion. 

I'm not sure how much 4 tbs of chili mix is but I used 2 packets of McCormick's Classic Chili seasoning.  Also, it did not say what kind of salsa to buy so I got the Southwest style. Further, I could not find 8 oz jars of salsa in my grocery store so I went with a 16 oz jar of salsa. Also, I used salt and fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Finally, I dumped it in a crock pot and let it cook for 3 hours the night before and then reheated in the crock pot when I got to work.

Loved it. I can see how this recipe could win at a chili cook off. 2 lb of ground pork, 1 diced onion, 2 cloves of crushed garlic cooked together in a pan. In a Dutch oven, a can of tomato sauce, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 4 oz. can of green chilies, can of black beans, can of kidney beans and 4 T of chili seasoning. Simmered for 2 hours. Heat, delicious. Served with Tex Mex cheese and sour cream.

This chili is sooo good!! I added one Tbsp of cocoa powder for richness but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Entering it tomorrow in a work chili contest. Even if it doesn't win, it's pretty much perfect chili!!

This was my first time making chili.
 I seasoned the meat with my usual spices first ( garlic powder & adobo). It was such an easy recipe to follow.  The end result was delicious! I would definitely make it again.

I made this as written and it was so, so good. I served this to my 20+ family for a birthday party. Everyone said that it was the best chili they have had. I wish I could have a bowl of it now. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Thanks Deb.

This has been my go-to chili recipe for a while.  I was super skeptical the first time I made it (the salsa threw me), but this is excellent chili.  Aside from caramelizing the onion (and adding fresh garlic), I follow the recipe exactly.   I use "Sarah's Chili Seasoning Mix" (from Allrecipes) as the chili seasoning mix, and I highly recommend it.  When the weather is chilly, make this chili :) !

Doubled the recipe. Used 4 lb ground beef. Browned in sauté pan, drained, and then sautéed onion & 2 tsp minced garlic in some of the drippings. Added some of the beef back to the pan & added 8 Tbsp (entire recipe) of "Chile Seasoning II" on this site as well as some of the tomatoes. Transferred this mixture to 2 slow cookers, added the rest of the ingredients. Substituted diced tomatoes plus some tomato purée  for the  tomato sauce. Also used 2 cans kidney beans plus one can pinto beans in each slow cooker.

This is our favorite chili.  I use Skip's Chili Seasoning mix (found on another site) that I mix up myself instead of the individual spices.  We've been making it for years.  I also add more salsa than the recipe calls for.

I used store bought fresh salsa, either mild or hot. I use a jar of marinara sauce inplace of the tomatoes.  I prefer pinto beans to red beans so that's what I used. Also, for additional l seasoning I use Bush's chili magic which has all the seasoning as well as more pinto beans.

This is a great basic recipe that allows for endless tweaks - all delicious! I've made the recipe as is, and love it. Also made it with brisket, green pepper, or ground turkey. So tasty!

Loved it!  Didn't have also so I subbed a small can of fixed tomatoes with green Chili's.  Also added a teaspoon of my favorite beef bouillon paste to round out the flavor. Yum.

I've been looking for the perfect chili recipe for years. This one is it! Made it exactly as written and it's perfect. If you're making for kids, don't add the black pepper to cut down on the heat, but leave it full for the adults. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is very flavorful. The addition of salsa was a great idea. I added celery, more salt and pepper and a small amount of brown sugar. Toppings included shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream and corn chips. This recipe is my new favorite. Thank you!

I'm a chili girl.  I love it, deeply and profoundly.  I found this recipe while looking for a good chili recipe to make for my husband and I.  I needed to find a good one, because up until this point (marriage)  I had been having my Mom's homemade chili, but now it was officially time to grow up and make my own chili.  So I did, sort of, with this recipe.  I used a cross between Deb's recipe and my Mom's, and, I must say, that it makes a dang good chili that gets rave reviews.  Here is what I added: used a whole onion instead of half, a 15 oz can diced or crushed tomatoes, 3 cups of salsa instead of 1 cup, a can of chili beans with the juice instead of the can of light red kidney beans, and a green pepper when I have it.  Also, to make it easy, I just use a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, which is a little less than she calls for, but I make up for it in my other tomato ingredients.  I always serve it with jasmine rice, cheese, and onions.  Again, love this recipe!!!

I used a can of pork and beans instead of the light kidney beans (didn't have)  and added mushrooms of course because I add them to everything. Added a couple hot peppers I had in my freezer from last years garden and a red bell pepper. I haven't tried it yet, it's in the slow cooker. Need this for my notes.

I've been making this recipe for two years now and I realized it was time for a current review. It is fantastic and versatile. Make it as is or use it as a base to suit your needs. I use it as a base for chili sauce for chili dogs and burgers (just use less liquid), as a straight up chili, or for turkey chili ( sub the beans for black beans, beef for turkey, and throw in a can of corn). This is my favorite recipe I've found on this site so far and will use it until my day's end. I've never had anyone not comeback for seconds. Thanks Deb!!

This was a very good chili made as written.
That being said, I am amazed it won several chili cook-offs.
I have at least 2 other chili recipes that are as good.
All different, but all good.

This recipe is very easy to make.  I love a bowl of thick, meaty chili and this was a great recipe for that.  However, I am very sensitive to spice.  Anything that has any "heat" at all in it is most always a turn off.  Unfortunately, the low sodium chili seasoning that I used had some heat and it didn't mention it on the label.  I just used the packet which wasn't quite 4 tablespoons, it was short by half a tablespoon.  With cheese and crackers added, I still managed to eat a bowl and the next time I think I may just stick with chili powder since I can't handle the heat of the chili seasoning.  I'm the only one at home that will eat chili, so leftovers are going to work with me.  I know there are people there who enjoy hot and spicey foods.  Thank you for sharing this simple recipe!

I love this recipe, it's very versatile and can be added on to very easily. I put in a healthy amount of garlic, extra spice, multiple beans, chunky tomatoes and some corn usually. I also use ground turkey and it comes out great.

Usually, recipes tell you to drain the kidney beans. Luckily, I followed the recipe exactly. It came out very thick, just the way I like chili. I will definitely use this recipe from now on!

So easy and delicious!  I saute the ground beef with onions AND minced garlic.  Throwing this in the slow cooker after the beef is browned makes it even easier.  Great chili for a cold winter's day!

This chili was just what I was looking for. Keep in mind, chili is a HUGE category of food, and this recipe might not be right for everyone on every occasion. I'm from the north, but have lived in the south, including Texas, so I know a lot of people have firm ideas about what chili should be; how hot, how meaty, etc. This chili is great as a standard recipe, similar to Wendy's-style chili and something hearty and solid to feed a diverse group. I made it for a group of visiting Irishmen, and they enjoyed it over rice. That may freak out some purists, but that's how they eat chili. :o) I enjoyed the flavor, and was able to make it in a crock pot after just sauteing the meat and onion. Easy and crowd-pleasing! Thanks!

I just made this dish for a rainy weekend on 02/21/16.  First, I used a great quality 2 pound beef brisket in lieu of the ground beef. I grilled the brisket outside for about 10 minutes on each side to give it the proper color.  I brought it in and sliced it into bite sized edible pieces; it was rare in the center, so I knew it would be tender later.  It was placed into a crock pot.

Next, we followed the recipe, but added the following: 1 beef bouillon cube,  4 cloves of garlic, 2 Bayleaf's,  1 Tablespoon rock sugar.  We only used one can of beens and added  one-half cup of water.

After simmering an hour, it seemed heavy on the onion, but later, it dissipated.   We cooked it for 4 hours on high in the crock pot, stirring occasionally and sampling as we went.  We turned it off and let it stand overnight and the re-heated it for 1 hour before we ate it a lunch.  Topped lightly with shredded cheddar cheese.  DEE-LISH !!!  5-STARS!  Girlfriend says it's "restaurant quality!"  I say, BS, it's far better than any restaurant can make.  Try this dish, you will love it.

This is the easiest, best tasting chili recipe ever! I use half mild, half medium picante sauce and an entire packet of chili seasoning.  I've made it on the stove top and in the crock pot and it comes out delicious either way.  When using the stove top I add a little beef broth which gives it the perfect consistency for us. My family loves it!

I made it exactly as written and was surprised at the results.  It is the type of chili recipe that I like, but the proportions didn't result in anything I cared for.  As is, it would be ok for sloppy joes.  I ended up doubling the chili seasoning and the beans to turn it into something my family would eat from a bowl.  Still, I might make the original as sloppy joes some day.

Thanks Deb, have been making this for years and let me tell you that this is the best Red Chili recipe ever. I have never rated any recipe before but am compelled to do so because of the wonderful flavors. I am also a chili fanatic growing up in Colorado where chili recipes of all sorts are king, red or green. I had to order the Williams Chili Powder as it is not available locally. I only add 2 more ingredients. I dice up Flank steak into 1/2 inch cubes then brown them and add to your recipe. I also add diced Lumbre green chilis for added heat and flavor which I order from Hatch New Mexico. Funny thing here is that of all the people I know that we share recipes with none of them will admit that this is the best they have ever had, yet their spouses will secretly tell me that this is much better. People out here are very proud of their own chili and would never confess that someone elses is better. Have taken it to work for potlucks and usually there are at least 2 other renditions and was told by almost everyone that this was the best. All except the other chili makers. Also, the addition of a good fresh grilled sweet corn is a plus served on the side which can be added if desired. We find that most will add it after testing a sample. Thanks again.

This recipe was so good and easy. My husband thought it was the best chili we've had. The only thing I changed was I added a minced jalapeño to elevate the taste. Yum!

This has to be one of the best chili recipes ever!  I made it with one less can of beans (family preference) but other than that exactly as listed and WOW, everyone loved it!  Served it with an awesome cornbread.  YUM!

This is pretty darn tasty and the cornbread is a must for me.  I wasn't even tempted to add mustard and crackers, my stamdard chili desecration mix ala Texas Tavern style.

The best chili! After making this, I can no longer eat chili from a can. Household favorite. Makes a lot, but sooo good there's never leftovers. Simple and delicious. Perfect as is.

I've made this a bunch of times and eventually started putting my own twist on it. I suggest chopping and de-seeding, 6 Jalapenos, 2-3 poblanos and toss those in. Then add between a 1/4 and half cup of honey. Finally, use serrano peppers to add heat. Of course you will want to leave the seeds in. My wife and I cut up two or three and that makes it pretty delicious. The good part about adding heat this way is you can buy like a half dozen serranos and just add more to get it to the potency you like. If you go too spicey, just increase the honey. it's win win.

It's good, not special. I personally don't' think the cheese salsa added anything to the flavor but perhaps extra calories. I'd prefer fresh shredded cheese over the top in that case. Definitely easy to make tho.

This was great chili! The entire family loved it, and my mother-in-law said it was the best she's ever had. I followed suggestions to use Ranch Beans and added tomatoes with green chilies. I browned the meat with the onion and threw it all in the crock pot. It was delicious!

This had a really good taste but was way too meaty.  I would cut back the meat and add something else to replace it.

LOVE this recipe!  I saute in a few cloves of garlic in with the beef and onion and I used the Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe from this website (made a big batch of seasoning mix for future chili- it's a great seasoning recipe!)

I have made it several times for family and friends in the past year, and it always got rated highly. I love that it is so easy to make!  I like to serve it with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and Fritos Corn Chips. 
Today I entered it in a Chili Cook-off at work, and it won First Prize!!  Thank you, Debdoozie!!!

I made this recipe as written or I wouldn't review it. I think chili is one of those dishes that is a personal preference. I have been making the same recipe I have used for 30 years which I won a chili cook off at a festival. This chili recipe was very good but my family fussed at me for not cooking what they were accustomed to having. Although I will go back to my own this is a good recipe if you are in the market for one

I don't like the Chili recipes with all kind of tomato products in them, tomato juice, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes.. It makes me feel I am eating tomato soup with some meat mixed in, and no doubt will result in some heartburn later ..
This recipe is all but that. It has a good ratio, meat to tomatoes , to beans. I made my own Chili seasoning mix. "Sarah's Chili Seasoning mix" from this site. Served with corn muffins.

I really like this Chili but I feel like it's a little plain. So I add Green, Red, and Yellow Bell Peppers for more sweetness. I don't use the salsa jar but I do get diced tomatoes with Italian herbs, and use Complete Sazón to season because I'm a Latina. XD

I made this chili (doubled recipe) for my daughters first birthday party in November. Everyone loved it and it was gobbled up. Featured fixings / toppings on the side. Very easy to make and the ingredients work together well. It's a crowd pleaser addition to my recipe collection.

This has been my go to chili recipe for years! Quick, easy, and super good. Friends and family have request this recipe over and over. For awhile I made exactly according to recipe, but I have found it's super adaptable. I've used black beans, adjust seasoning to taste, and doubled batch easily. If you're looking for a great tasting incredibly easy chili, this is it! One last thing, this chili is great to freeze in small portions and take out later. Hope you enjoy!

I'm giving this one star because I got last place in the chili cookoff. I cooked it the night before to let it sit in the fridge and get spicier, it tasted fantastic. The next day I reheated, and what was already a drier chili became completely dry. I didn't have anything to add to make it better.

This was my first time ever making chili. We LOVED this recipe. First, it's SUPER easy and quick to make. Second, my husband, who is not a fan of beans, had two bowls of it. It was DELICIOUS! we are looking forward to the leftovers tonight!

My husband made this for our church's chili cookoff and won! He added an extra pound of hamburger, substituted the fresh onion for the equivalent of dried minced onions and used 2 cans of original Rotel in place of the salsa. It was super simple too! He browned and drained the hamburger then chucked it and everything else in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours until it was hot! It was such a crowd favorite that by the time he was announced the winner, there was none left for those that wanted a taste (unless you licked the pan...which was tempting!)

Loved this easy chili recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. I used HOT chili seasoning and HOT salsa, resulting in a nice burn going down. Perfect for a winters day.

Delicious!  Used 1 can red kidney beans, 1 can light red kidney beans, and one can ranch-style beans.  Additions: 1 yellow, red, and orange bell pepper; 2 heaping large spoons of light brown sugar; a whole jar medium pace picante sauce; and 2 tsp cayenne pepper.  Served with sour cream, shredded cheese, and corn bread.  Husband loved it.

Only chili recipe I make because it's AMAZING!! Normally make as-is using medium salsa. But for the group that wants a kick, I throw in hot salsa and a chopped jalapeño. Make with a side of corn bread, and the perfect winter comfort food!

I added real garlic, some chopped ginger root, chopped celery, chopped green onion, dry white beans and dry kidney beans and basically followed the recipe.  It's been simmering for almost 5 hours.....the red beans are almost done!!!

I liked this recipe, however I sautéed 2 cloves of garlic with the onion and burger. I used a medium salsa which gave it a good kick for my spice loving family. To cool it down for me, I added in fresh tomatoes from our garden.  It was wonderful and we loved it. Simple to make and a great hit.

I followed the recipe the first time I made this, and it was okay but lacking something.  The next time, I took my hubby's advice and added a can of diced tomatoes (I had basil, garlic, oregano seasoned ones on hand) along with my hubby's secret ingredient of 2-3 Tbs of honey.  The slightly sweet with the spice of the chili seasoning is the perfect blend of flavor.  Will probably continue to make this recipe w/ my modifications.

I have made this recipe for my family 3 times now and each time my children rave about the marvelous taste of the chilli.  I followed the recipe from start to finish.  The only thing that I add is a pinch of sugar.

I'm sorry, but I made this and it finished in the middle of the pack in a Chile Cook-off at work, and the competition wasn't that tough.  While it wasn't bad, I found it to be somewhat bland.  I must admit, I like stronger spicing and more heat than most people, but a dozen people tasted it and judged it average.  Then again, I've done this Chile Cook-off three times and always finish in the middle of the pack, and I only made this recipe once, so maybe it's the cook.

This recipe is great as-is. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe and used our Medium salsa, it was too spicy for my liking but my husband was happy with how spicy it was...next time i'll go with mild.
  The second time I made it: I didn't have enough chili powder so I substituted with chili-garlic powder, and cut out the garlic salt... my mistake, too much garlic.  I didn't add the salsa (because we didn't have any in the house).  Also I substituted the tomato sauce with pasta sauce because that's what we had in the house - my husband said the chili tasted like a meatlover's pizza.  Regardless of my mistakes, IF you follow the recipe as-is (like I did the first time), it's a great recipe.

Have been making it since 2009 after I tasted it at my neighbors, best recipe I have ever found for chili! I use 3 cloves of fresh garlic minced. and I DO NOT add any salt as I use McCormicks low salt chili seasoning mix.  McCormicks mix equals the 4 TBS of chili seasoning called for in the recipe. Can't say enough good things about the recipe.

This recipe packed amazing flavor for such simple ingredients. I did customize it for my personal taste. I added chopped green and red bell pepper along with some diced garlic, green chili peppers, and onion to my ground beef for some fresh flavor and color. I also seasoned my beef with some black pepper, season salt, and itialian seasoning. Reduced sauce to one can and added can of chili ready diced tomatoes. Used Mccormicks reduced sodium chili seasoning packet, the extra salt isn't needed if the meat is seasoned properly. I was sceptical of using salsa in chili but used Pace Picante mild and I'm glad I did. Added all ingredients to my crock pot and turned on high for about 1hr 30mins to 2 hrs. Served with cheddar cheese and crackers  used left overs for chili cheese dogs the next day :). This is my new go to chili recipe my son and fiancé agree this is a winner.

Let me first begin this review by saying, yes this is the only chili recipe for you.
Cooking for me has developed since age 8-ish and to this day I pride myself on having a collection of only five star recipes. This chili recipe is no exception.
If you want to make this chili the very best here is what I do:
Add one can of drained yellow sweet corn
Substitute the two cans of kidney beans for one drained and rinsed can of black beans
Drizzle Kahlúa on top before cooking it makes all the difference in the world.
I would say about 2 to 3 tablespoons.
Make sure that you drain the ground beef completely  before you add the remaining ingredients, even if you have to use a strainer.
Garnish with avocado slices finely shredded Mexican cheese , fresh jalapeno slices , sour cream and a few crumbles of cornbread.
Serve with tortilla chips.
ENJOY!

This is the easiest and best chili recipe I have ever made! I use McCormick chili seasoning and Kroger brand medium salsa. I also use ground chuck instead of ground beef. Awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing!

It was a pretty good basic recipe, but didn't taste enough like chili in my opinion. I added 2 tsp. of cumin and 2 cloves fresh crushed garlic instead of powdered garlic. My husband loved it. I also added a finely chopped green jalapeno pepper and some diced regular green pepper to give it more flavor. Served over white rice with cornbread on the side. It was a hit!

Have to say it's pretty darn good. We loved it. Added sugar, cumin and a bit of brown sugar. It was sweet and tangy. Nom nom nom...

I used black beans instead of dark red kidney beans to offset all the red in the chili.  It was delicious.

Added:
-30 oz diced tomatoes
-1 chopped green pepper
-1 chopped red pepper
-1 chopped jalapeno pepper (seeded)
-1 chopped pablano pepper (seeded)
-3 tsp fresh chopped garlic
-1/4 tsp cumin
-1/2 tsp crushed red chili pepper
-1 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
-2 tbsp chili powder
-1 tsp sea salt
-1/8 tsp of Italian Seasoning
-1/2 tsp garlic powder
-1/4 tsp onion salt
-1/4 tsp sesame seeds

OMG! This was great!  My husband said this was the best Chile he ever had.  I used Ortega low sodium chile seasoning, Hunts tomato sauce, Pace jar salsa medium not the chunky.  Had a little over 2 lbs meat so used 1 whole onion.  Midway cooking I added 3-4 drops of hot sauce.  I will be making this again.  Thank you for the yuuummmy!!!!!

We loved this! Cooked for my husband and mom, said it reminds her of Wendy's chili,  which she loves. Only thing I would do differently is add a little heat or spiciness, maybe add minced jalapeno or something like that

Good recipe. Used medium Pace picante, I still prefer mine spicier but this is good for a crowd of all ages. I just made sure I had some hot sauces on the side!

This chili tastes great and the best part is that it's easy! I used medium PACE PICANTE SAUCE and medium chili seasoning mix...next time I will try the hot version as I think the chili needs a bit of spice. I also added a can of pinto beans.

This is perfect as written. I am however one of those chili makers that often does not look at a recipe and just wings it and some times it's amazing and others not so much. I always go back to this recipe to right my wrongs. Definitely different and perfect mix of flavors. We do turn up the heat and top with sour cream, cheese, diced green onions and the kids use Fritos scoops to dig in.

I really enjoyed this, as did my family. I tend to add extra veggies into whatever I am making so I added mushrooms, green pepper,and a can of corn. I didn't add the salsa though but crushed tomatos along with the tomato sauce. Some people commented about it being bland and adding chilli spice I don't think were using the right spice. You shouldnt just use chilli powder but the chilli seasoning packets. Delicious.

So Easy and delicious! The only thing I changed was 93% ground turkey but everything else exactly the same.  I made this mid-morning and put in the crockpot on simmer until dinnertime. This is a must have, no muss no fuss recipe. 2 thumbs up! Thanks for sharing Deb!

I have made this several times and everyone loves it!  My husband is crazy about it and i consider him a true chili critic!  I even made it for a work potluck and every single bit was gone!  It has the right amount of spice for good cold night chili!  We love it and it will be a permanant recipe in our house!  Suzy 2014

This was great chili and the only alteration I made was substituting a pound of sausage for a pound of the beef.  Everything else I left as is.  The wife commented this was the best chili she's ever have. Never would have thought pace picante sauce in chili would have worked.  Extremely surprised.

Every time I make this recipe people rave. I make a big pot adding 2 big cans tomato sauce, 16 ounces salsa, 2 cans black beans, 2 cans chili beans, 2 cans light red kidney beans, 1 can dark red kidney beans, all untrained.  one whole chopped onion. Add a couple more tbsp of chili seasoning for big pot.
It freezes very well.

Ok. When everyone says they used this recipe in a cook off and won, they aren't exaggerating. In a last minute decision to join the cook off, I found this recipe and decided to try it. I've never made chili before, it was simple enough and the best part was it didn't take much time to make. I did however add some minor personality touches. I found the recipe to be too thick (probably because I drained the beans), so i added two beef bouillon cubes and a cup of boiling water. I used fresh garlic, garlic powder and sea salt instead of garlic salt. I also added fresh peppers from my garden to give it that extra kick. Yum! It was a hit and yes, I won the chili cook off! - oh and one word of advise, the most important step is to let it simmer for at least an hour! I tasted it immediately and it tasted like tomato sauce. Against my will, I left it alone and let it just simmer. Then it started tasting like chili. I'm sure those more versed in chili making know this last word of advise. I added for my fellow rookies. Thanks Deb for sharing.

Soooo heartwarmingly good and no-brainer easy. I'm done looking for chili recipes... this is IT. No tweaks other than I added a little brown sugar to taste.  Debdoozie... thankyou!

Deb, I won tonight at our Church chili cook-off! Just wanted to say thanks for posting this very simple  and excellent recipe. I modified it just a bit as others have but it was sooooo good I taste tested almost half the initial batch I made yesterday. My modifications were substituted half the ground chuck with ground buffalo and mild sausage. Used a Kroger brand chili mix and used minced garlic instead of garlic salt and subbed ranch beans for the kidney beans. Thanks again, I will be serving this up for years to come.

I was looking for a quick chili recipe that didn't have to simmer all day, and came across this. I think the recipe largely depends on what kind of salsa you use. I used a high quality salsa that was balanced in flavor, and really liked it. I also used homemade chili seasoning instead of a packet. I omitted the garlic salt, since the chili seasoning was salty enough, and used 2 (15 oz) cans of tomato sauce. I also used only 1.3 lbs of ground beef. My whole family really enjoyed this recipe.

This chili was the bomb! Super easy to make. I made the recipe exactly as is but added a dash of nutmeg and a teaspoon of brown sugar for fun. I have made other chili recipes from this site. This one was the easiest and tastiest! I made it on a cold, rainy night and served it with shredded cheese, fritos and chopped purple onions. MMMMMMMMMMM

This is great.  I used one can of black beans and one of kidney.  Easy and relatively quick - minimal prep time, and cook time is pretty short for chili.

This makes a great base chili -- the balanced flavor stands well on its own, but also leaves plenty of room to grow for those who like to add more heat or spice. There are a lot of good chili recipes on this site; this one earns its stars not just for its taste, but its simplicity. You won't find a better batch of chili that can be made so quickly and easily.

This is a great quick weeknight chili.  Goes together super fast.  My picky 8 year old had 2 helpings!  Made exactly as written only didn't have the chili seasoning.  Just used a mixture of chili powder & cumin.  Chili doesn't have to have tons of ingredients to be tasty.  This recipe is a good example of that. Thanks for posting!

I tried this and followed it as best I could (couldn't find Deb's seasoning where I live) but just can't give it 5 stars as other testers.  I have tasted much richer and spicier chili recipes.

LOVED it!  I am very picky about my chili recipes and this one is a real winner.  I used the spice recipe for Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site along with this recipe and I'll never make chili a different way again.  I allow it to simmer for 20-30 minutes to really be sure that the dried spices all open up.

I made this chili for the Superbowl and made enough for 30 people. It was fabulous! I did use Pace Picante Sauce as suggested. I will say that it was a tiny bit spicy for some of the younger kiddos, so I would adjust the heat a bit if you have a younger crowd. I served it with cheese and sour cream, so that did cool it a bit going down. Thanks SO much for this recipe!

All I can say is THANK YOU. This recipe was simple and downright delicious. I made it for my husband and parents (who only cook from scratch) and everyone loved it. It will be in rotation every week for sure.

I added one small can of diced tomatoes and used the whole 16oz jar of salsa.

This made a very good pot of chili, and can be adapted so easily.  I have always had to rely on chili kits before, but now I don't have to!  I can make my own chili from scratch!!

I found this recipe a few years ago and it's been a staple for our family ever since. Because I like my chili thick and chunky, I omit the 2 1/2 cups of tomato sauce and use two, 28 oz. cans of diced tomatoes (including juice). For a lower fat option, I will also use ground turkey instead of ground beef, however the flavor is better with ground beef (this is a personal preference as my family can't tell the difference). Toss the entire recipe in the crock pot and let it simmer on low all day. You won't be disappointed when you sit down to dig in. I've yet to have a complaint when I've served this dish.

Taste just like what my grandma used to make.  Made it for a large crowd and I ended up with no leftovers!  BTW:  I didn't modify a thing.

I made this recipe for a chili cook off at my husbands work and it WON!!!  I made it 2 days before the contest because as most of you know chili taste better reheated. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did use a can of stewed tomatoes because it needed more liquid. I wasn't able to find the chili seasoning that was suggested, I used Lawry's chili seasoning . It was great! Thanks for sharing!!

Awesome recipe!  Both my husband and I love a good chili and this one certainly fills the bill.  Of course, we always tweak to personal preferences...so, being the avid hunter, the freezer is always full of venison.  Substituted ground venison for burger, cut out the salt (let user determine personal taste), decreased tomato sauce to 8 oz and used a qt of home canned stewed tomatoes in place of salsa.  Also added green pepper and a clove of garlic.  The Chili Seasoning Mix II by sal was an excellent seasoning choice as well...please try that recipes (with modifications as well...LOL).  Wonderful blend of flavors!

Have made this many times, always a hit with my family (and coworkers when I entered it-and won- a cookoff!) . Recipe is great as-is, I however do opt to add a drained can of diced tomatoes simply to make it heartier and to add another texture element. I use the Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe from this site for my seasoning (though on that recipe I cut back on the flour a bit and bump up the spices, it's a great seasoning recipe that is FAR better than packaged mixes and I highly recommend making your own mix over packaged, no matter what chili recipe you are making). Simple and great recipe!

Great recipe as is.  I add a can of Hunt's fire-roasted diced tomatoes to make it even more flavorful.  Freezes well, and tastes even better a few days after you make it.  Add a few drops of tabasco or habanero sauce to spice up an individual bowl.  Substitule white kidney beans in place of the light red kidney beans, for a more contrasting look.

I am giving this 5 stars because the salsa is pure GENIUS!  I added onions, peppers,celery,and plenty of extra seasonings in addition to the whole packet of chili seasoning (like I always do) and almost a whole jar of Pace salsa (which I have NEVER done.) Then, I won the chili cook-off at our local country club yesterday! Who doesn't love salsa?  And, I think the vinegar in the salsa gave it just enough zing to be interesting and stand out a tad, while still being traditional chili.  Thanks, Deb!

My family loves this recipe!! I'm a mom to a family of boys - picky eaters who love good food. This receipe is simple and great. It's crockpot friendly. We make it camping and love it for football games. It takes all the fuss out of delicious chili. I make a ton and freeze it for taco salads, stuffed potatoes etc. Happy eating and thank you Debbie.

LOVED this recipe! I had all the ingredients except minced garlic (used garlic powder) and the chili seasoning mix (so I made my own from a recipe off this site : Chili Seasoning Mix II). Would never have considered adding JARRED salsa to a homemade chili, and I have no idea what it's impact is/was, but this chili was fan-effing-fantastic.

My family loves this.  Sometimes I taste a little too much of the sauce, depending on the brand, so I cut back on it, but only a little bit.  We also add extra beans to make it last a little bit longer.

Very easy and very tasty.  I put all the ingredients except for the meat and onions into the crock pot.  Then, I started cooking the meat and onions.  Once they were done, I drained them and added them to the crock pot. Turned out great...there wasn't any left.

It's good and super easy.  I may add more beans and a little more heat since it's pretty mild.  In addition, when I serve it tonight I'll sprinkle raw onions, a little shredded sharp cheddar cheese and some avocado on top to ratch up the flavor.

I've made this recipe several times and absolutely love it.  The only thing I do is add some hot sauce and a little worcestershire sometimes. I make a mean cornbread and serve it with it.  This time I'm simmering it in the slow cooker (let's see how it turns out).  Of course I browned the meat and all first just want to see if slow cooking increases the flavor more :).  Thanks Deb.

Love this recipe! It is so easy to make. Adding the salsa helps to cut out a lot of steps of other chili recipes I have seen. I make it as the recipe shows but add a little more chili powder to taste. Highly recommend!

We've made this recipe more times than I can count, and each time the outcome's the same... outstanding!! My only variation is, more salsa n less tomato sauce, and I make my own chili seasoning mix. Tastes great served in a variety of ways...over noodles,or rice; with crackers, Parmesan or shredded cheese; or as chili cheese fries.....oh, so good, and oh, so easy!

I've made this recipe several times, and every time I get rave reviews! Of course I never let on how incredibly easy it is to make. ;) Best chili recipe I've ever made, hands down.

I just served this tonight and even my picky 7 year old boy ate two servings.  I had to use a large can of whole tomatoes because I didn't have any tomato sauce.  I liquified them in the blender, measured out 2.5 cups... still delicious!  We ate this with rice and cheese... and what I really loved about it was that it was technically ready to eat right away.  I let it simmer for an hour as instructed, but that seems unnecessary from my experience.  I will definitely use this recipe all the time!!

I used (hickory/mesquite) smoked London broil and country style pork ribs for the meat.  The overall flavor was very sweet and acidic.

This is one of my husband and I's all-time favorite recipes, but I've gradually made some changes in the 2-ish years that we've been making it.  Firstly, I use a full 29 oz. can of tomato sauce (3 5/8 cups rather than 2 1/2 cups).  I have experimented with using hot salsa and it turned out wonderfully and I'd highly recommend making it hot, but my favorite salsa I've used so far is the Guy Fieri Original Salsa... it gives a very hearty, savory flavor.  I also add chopped green bell peppers immediately before serving.  They taste great with the chili and gives it some crispiness.

This is now my go to chili recipe. I have made it about a dozen times, and I leave it as is except for my own adjustments of red pepper and a bit more onion. Easy and practically perfect.

Love, Love, Love this chili Deb!! This is now my chili recipe, it's so easy & delicious. So simple to add to also, like if I want black beans etc. But using Pace Picante sauce is key makes the taste amazing!!! Thank you so much for sharing this fabulous recipe!

Oh man. SOO good. I think it's the Pace Picante Medium salsa that does it. Really liked this and super easy. I halved the recipe and there was plenty.

Great! I made it using ground turkey & a chili seasoning recipe from this site. Everyone raved. In the future I think I'd add some other stuff to it to make it more interesting but as is the recipe is great

I used 2 1/2 lbs. of hamburg, a little more onion, added one 4.5 oz. can chopped chili peppers (drained), 1 1/2 15 oz. cans tomato sauce, and 2 can of canellini beans in addition to the red and light red beans (I drained all the beans), and 2 envelopes of Ortega reduced sodium chili mix.  Served with with a little grated sharp cheddar sprinkled on top, and sour cream and chopped green onions.  SOOOO delish!  YUM!

Quick, easy, tasty, versatile. I loved the recipe just as is however the 2nd time I made it I was missing salsa & had only 1 small can of tomato sauce. This basic recipe is open to variations so I added taco seasoning and canned tomatoes. Thanks for providing such a mom friendly, delicious, chili.

Are you kidding me?!!  Yummy!!  10 stars here...for flavor and for how easy it is to make.  Made it for superbowl as I had a baked potato bar...no chili left!  Not a morsel.  I never follow recipes to the T, but I did w/this one!  Well, that's not really true.  I could not find that brand of Chili seasoning at any of my local stores.  So, I made the Chili Seasoning Mix II from this website. Home run baby!!  Oops, sorry that's not football lingo:-)  TOUCHDOWN!

I tried this recipe for a pot luck, and got raves about it, not only from the college kids that are happy for any home cooked meal, but also from the experienced troopers. Added a little brown sugar, tweeked the spices for our taste, I also made it well ahead and just let it simmer - probbaly 4 to 5 hours.  Great recipe to start with, or adjust to make it you own.

I think the bones of this recipe are good. But I think it ended up tasting too much of tomato.  I ended up having to add a lot of chili powder, more cumin, some chipotle peppers, and finally a squirt of barbecue sauce for it to tast like chili. But since the outcome was pretty good, I gave this recipe three stars.

Made this adding more tomatoe sauce, and used a medium heat picante salsa. Took it to a local chili cookoff...I was one of 25 contestants and took home a 3rd place ribbon. The proof was a scraped clean crock pot.  Deb's recipe is easy and delicious.  I used 3/4 tsp of black pepper instead of a whole tsp. The chili seasoning I used is Old Westport.

I just tried this recipe and it's safe to say it's a keeper! I used the Pace hot picante sauce and (along with the William's seasoning and other spices) and it gave it the perfect "heat". Glad I bought one containers because I'm going to freeze the rest for later! :^d

Although my husband likes chili, the kids and I weren`t big on chili until we tried this recipe!  Because I like spicy foods, I added a bit of finely chopped Jalepenos and Habeneros, 1 tbsp chopped garlic + pinch of salt, and used only 1 lb of grd beef + 4 hot italian sausages

I used the Pace Chipotle salsa and added extra as suggested in other comments.In addition, I used a can of Rotel Tomato and Green Chile sauce as well as one can of regular Tomato sauce. Added cumin and crushed red pepper to taste! Also, i cut the recipe in half for my bf and I and we had plenty of left overs! This is def a keeper!

Great recipe. I was surprised that a chili recipe included salsa.  I just recently aquired the taste for chili.  I used the allrecipes chili seasoning mix II.  I wonder what this recipe tastes like without the Pace salsa, as I don't particularly like the smell. Thanks for sharig Deb I will be making this again.

This was good, but I didn't find anything extraordinary about it; tasted like regular chili. I liked the idea of adding salsa, saving me some chopping, but my husband asked for more green peppers next time. Nice and easy.... I let it simmer for many hours while I was waiting for the Super Bowl lol. Will make again with some additions.

I doubled the recipe to 16 servings, served 7 people just enough leftovers to maybe feed 3.  It's delicious!!!  I would recommend just making a lot more because everyone seems to eat so much of it.  I feel so proud that I made it.  I did change it up just a little after reading other suggestions.  Instead of only using tomato sauce, I used some chopped/stewed tomatoes because I wanted some texture and I used more chopped onion than they said.   I also used fresh garlic and added 1/2 the amount of salt.  I added about 1/3 cup of beer (keep in mind I had a double recipe) and about a tablespoon or two of brown sugar. Topped it with medium chedder, but I actually think it was better without the distraction of cheese on top.  Served with cornbread with butter and honey.

Not quite blue ribbon. I had to add some other spices to bring it up to par but it was a good starter recipe. I added more beans (a can of black and a can of Great Northern). I also added a whole package of Schilling Chili Seasoning Mix (mild). It was WAY too thick so I added a can of Rotel tomatoes.

This recipe is great, I've made it a few times for our potluck beach parties and it always goes over great, never any leftovers to take home. Definitely will be using this again, thanks.My wife preferred the medium salsa and a little less chili seasoning.

While the chili tasted good, this recipe depends primarily on the chili seasoning mix used. It would be better if the recipe  contained the actual contents of the seasoning and the amounts used else one has to assume  that a store bought seasoning was used and that can vary the taste dramatically.

It's worth the hype! This chili has it all - great texture and flavor! I swapped out some of the tomato sauce for diced tomatoes, but keep everything the same. It was the most popular chili at the cook off (and I was skeptical).

A wonderful base recipe but here are my own modifications. I like to dice up and add a variety of fresh peppers (jalapeno, poblano, etc.). I also prefer to add a 15oz can of corn (no salt added), substitute 1 can of black beans for the kidney beans, and reduce the salsa to just 4oz. For the seasoning, I use the Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe (but reduce serving to 1/4 cup) and omit the pepper and garlic salt from the original recipe. Be sure to shred cheese from a fresh block rather than buying the bagged Kraft stuff - which is terribly dry. Serve with Homesteader Cornbread - incredibly moist and delicious!

OUTSTANDING!Ingredients were simple and the chili was probably the best I have ever eaten. We top it off with a little shreaded cheese and dolop of sour cream. My husband and in-laws raved about it! This is destined to be a repete recipe in our household.

I have made this chili several times and enjoy it for many reasons. This is a simple recipe and it has great flavor. I made a few changes due to personal preference. I took the beef down to 1 1/2 pounds. I also use pinto beans instead of light red kidney beans. Last, the chili is a bit thick for my taste so I add a 12 ounce beer prior to simmering. Served with a little cheese on top and a side of jalapeno. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was a great base recipe to work with. I never made Chili before, and I loved the simplicity of ingredients used. The only changes that I made were to use an entire onion, instead of 1/2 onion. So I wouldn't have any waste, I used one 15 oz can of tomato sauce and one 16 oz jar of salsa...it's not the exact measurements the recipe used, but I figured salsa has a little bit more flavor due the different seasonings and peppers used than tomato sauce and it was great. I used one 1.25 oz packet of chili seasonings which is approx 4 tablespoons.  I seasoned my meat and onions with a little seasoning salt and garlic salt...careful to not over season...drained my beef..and mixed everything in the crockpot and set it on low for 8 hrs.

I hate Chilli and i thought this was amazing! I hate beans and I ate these ones too! I cut the recipe in 1/2, like I said before I hate chilli and thought if it turns out bad I didn't waste so much. I used 1/2 an onion and 1/2 cup of mild salsa. I used Mild chilli seasoning but there was a tiny kick to the Chilli beans I used- I tried to drain most of the flavoring before I added them. Over all I have to say this was awsome and now I can say I like Chilli- at least this one! :)

I like that the recipe had so few ingredients, however I felt the proportions were off. For me this is WAY too heavy on the meat and light on the beans. I'll probably make it again and double the amount of beans. Additionally, I found a recipe for my own chili seasoning instead of using the packaged chili seasoning. I recommend making this substitution. You likely have all of the spices in your cabinet and you can avoid the MSG and other chemicals in the packaged seasoning.

We make this all the time now! We use a whole onion, half to saute and half thrown in as it simmers. We also throw in a diced green pepper and red pepper. We add a little more salsa to balance things out.

delicious! even better the next day after sitting for a while. made exactly as stated, but i wasn't sure if light red kidney beans are the same as white cannellini beans but it's all i could find so i used it and it was great. with some homemade cornbread - great! the original yield makes plenty and it freezes well. the boyfriend (who is the pickiest eater EVER) loved it. will definitely make again.

My whole family loved it! Served with crusty bread it's great after being out in the cold. Even better if you refrigerate overnight and have it the day after making it! :)

This is a quick, very tasty recipe using the Chili Seasoning  II mixture. I make a big quart size container of the seasoning mixture and use it for months. You can make pot of chili in 15 minutes this way.   I usually make it using ground turkey and it's just as good.  This is a regular in my house especially during the winter

My husband was very skeptical (and not a fan) of chili when I said it was for supper.  This recipe has sold us both!  This is my first time making chili and it was so good!  I didn't have any chili mix on hand, so I used the Chili Seasoning II recipe from this website instead.  Substitutions I made were: 1 can of black beans and 1 can of dk. red kidney beans; 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies.  (Ended up with LOTS of heat to this chili)  Browned frozen meat on stovetop and tossed in crockpot to let it simmer for a couple of hours.  Served with some french bread.  Perfect for those cool winter evenings!

This is a good, simple recipe that requires few ingredients.  As it is, I would rate it with 3 stars.  However, this recipe provides a great base for a potentially fantastic chili by adding a variety of different ingredients.  It came out a little dry, so I added a wee bit of water...because you've got to have some liquid to sop up with cornbread!

Very good recipe as printed. First time made the chili I followed the recipe as directed. The second time I made changes that we like. I added chopped green pepper, reduced the tomato sauce by 1 can and subsutituted 1 can of Rotel Mexican style chopped tomatoes, also used one can of black beans instead of the light red kidney beans.

The overall taste was bland and I ended up adding another 1/2 packet of Williams Chili Seasoning mix.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes as the consistency was too thick.

My family always raved about my chili but for something different I tried this recipe. The ooo's and ahhh's on every bite were crazy. My husband asked if I could make it exactly like this again! 
I followed the recipe ALmost exactly, except that I didn't have light kidney beans so I used black. I also used "Newmans Own Peach Salsa" which gave a sweet and spicy flavor.  My son is a vegetarian so I used "Quorn" brand soy meat. Nobody else knew it wasn't beef because that brand is so good. 
I will be making it again next week, exactly the same :)

I get a lot of compliments on my chili and it makes me feel like chili is "my thing."  Thanks to this great recipe!  Now I do tweak it a bit just by adding additional beans ( I add about 4-5 cans.) I do like to add black beans, pinto, red, and kidney beans.  I also use more salsa than it calls for because I like my chili to go a long way.  I don't use chili seasoning mix anymore but instead just dash chili powder and cumin to taste.  Mmmm!

My husband said this is the best chili he has ever had! I loved it as well, and I normally don't like chili. I did add 2 seeded jalapenos to it, (just to use them up from the garden) and 1 chopped bell pepper. Also added about a 1/2 c. of water. Topped with cheddar and sour cream and served with cornbread. Very yummy! Thanks for this delicious recipe!

This really is a winning recipe.  I made a few small variations such as garlic cloves vs. garlic salt, and introduced 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt instead.  I also added Black bean salsa and a small can of mexican salsa.  I also introduced diced tomatoes into the recipe.  In a nutshell, I was forced to do this years chili contest for my department, so I went into this with reluctance but found that it was a big hit. In fact I won both of best Chili award and the People's Choice award.  I was elated!  So, this receipe will gets 5 stars.

When chili is the star of the show, I make the Boilermaker Tailgate Chili from this site, but today I am making chili cheese fries so I didn't feel like putting quite as much effort into the chili. If you've seen the other recipe, you'll know what I mean! Debdoozie's chili is super fast to prepare and tastes decent.

Very easy, fast recipe and delicious!  Thank you.
Make this with the Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe by Sal on this site instead of the chili seasoning packet.  Delicious!!
Edited:  I used a mild Picante sauce so next time I won't use any red pepper cos still too hot for kiddos.

A good chili. There wasn't a wow factor for me though. I think I was wanting something chunkier. I missed the stewed tomato chunks that chili often has and this recipe needed some chili powder for a kick, not just the chili seasoning.

Ok, So I did a few things differently but it turned out great anyway.
First, I had 4 different homegrown chiles that needed using because they were getting soft and shriveled. So I added them in with the onion and burger. I also added a big pinch of minced garlic during that step.
I used 2 (15 oz.) cans of tomato sauce because my guestimation was off which lef
t me with 3 cups of tomato sauce rather than 2 1/2. I also did a booboo with the salsa, I had a 28 oz. jar of medium heat, Pace Picante Sauce and I was telling myself "eh, I'll eyeball that 8 oz. (1 cup)" Um... yeah, ended up with about 2/3 of the jar in there. So to compensate, I measured the seasoning as directed but added the entire packet of (low sodium) chili seasoning.
As it simmered, I have to admit it started smelling like boiled Pace Picante.... TOTALLY my fault, not the recipes. So I started brain storming on what I could do to off set that a little. I ended up adding 2 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar, a pinch of salt and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. Totally did the trick and the family loved it. Turned out slightly sweet with a nice underlying heat. Served with a little reduced fat cheddar, light sour cream, fresh onion and cilantro as toppings. Super Easy and a must make again recipe!  Oh! And since it was really saucy (because of my messed up measuring) I added a can of pinto beans and a can of black beans to the mix.  Still was very tasty and we got plenty for leftovers or perhaps the freezer.

I made this for the contest at the hubby's job and won!!!!   It was fantastic.  Only changes I made was add fresh garlic, pinto beans, canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and added some chili powder cuz it tasted a little too tomatoey.  He said they licked the pot clean!  I made it the night before and he had it on "Warm" in the crock pot.  This is a keeper !!!

This is a very good starter recipe! I had all day to play in the kitchen so I just made a few improvements & changes from stuff I had on hand..after the ground meat onion cooked & drained mix I added a can of Ranch Style beans instead of the ones here,then in addition to the garlic salt I added 2 chopped cloves of fresh garlic,1 tblsp chopped jalepenos,1/2 can corn,2 tblsp green pepper,1/2 jar of Texas-Texas hot sauce,1 tblsp Herdez salsa verde,2 tblsp canned mushrooms,1 pint of chopped tomatoes canned,1/2 cup of prepared pico de gallo(had made already in fridge..for this you could just add some chopped fresh cilantro). Then I put it all in a big crockpot & cooked all day. I made some Mexican cornbread to go with it and served over Fritos corn chips and cheddar/Monterey Jack Cheese on top. It is HEAVENLY!(especially for a Texan like me!)Thanks Deb for the inspiration & ideas!

This chili is missing a lot of flavor and was really bland, so I added quite a few more ingredients: the whole packet of chili seasoning, cumin, cayan seasoning and a bottle of beer. I couldn't even tell there was salsa in it.

I made this chili recipe today & it was amazing. I did make a few changes. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef & since I didn't have garlic salt I used minced garlic instead. I added it to the meat along with the onion. I also add some of the chili seasoning to the meat while it was browning. Then I put everything in the slow-cooker to let it simmer all day. When it was done I topped it with some shredded cheese & had some fresh cornbread on the side. I will definitely be using this recipe for now on.

Very tasty - liked the use of salsa to give it some more zip.  I used Taco seasoning I from here and the heat level was just perfect.  Good level of sauce too - not too dry like some chilis.  I've made this a few times now and it is consistently good.

I've made this recipe twice....the first time I used an 'authentic Mexican Salsa'.....a wee bit on the hot side, but delicious.  5 Star for sure.
The second time I used all Old El Paso Salsa, and it was nowhere near as tasty!
Today, I'm again making it with the 'authentic Mexican Salsa'....and I know it is going to be deeeelicious!   So little work for such delicious results - what's not to like about that ;-0
THANKS FOR SHARING DEBDOOZIE!

Great chili. Never made chili before with a jar of salsa and I liked it. I did however use a large can of crushed tomatoes because that is what I had on hand. Also used my own spices because the chili packets are high in sodium. Thanks for sharing!

This is very similar to the chili that I make, the biggest difference is I usually use 1lb ground beef and 1 lb hot italian sausage removed from the casing and browned with the beef.

This sounds delicious and I plan to prepare it. A question:

1 (8 ounce) jar salsa
4 tablespoons chili seasoning mix

Could someone send me examples of a good salsa brand and the ingredients in a chili seasoning mix. Still a novice with chillies. Would appreciate it: tnosugar@gmail.com

I use Rotel instead of salsa and use cut up steak or roast for meat instead of ground beef.  If you use a crockpot and leave it on low for about 7-8 hours it is so good.  I also use minced garlic instead of garlic salt.

Four star for the ease of making, but the chili was a little too thick and strong flavored for our liking.  Next time I'll use 3 TBS. of chili seasoning instead of 4 or a mild chili seasoning with only 1lb. of beef and add 1 TBS. sugar to the chili.  Using the salsa is a great idea.  Thanks for posting.

This chili was simple and amazing. I added a dash of chili powder, cayenne and paprika but I still think it would of been delicious without it. The best compliment I got was that it was better then Wendy's and just as good as my grandmothers. I will definitley be making this over and over again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! I could not find the Williams Original chili mix that Deb uses, so I used Carroll Shelby's Original Texas Brand Chili spices. I cut the recipe in half since I only had 1.27 lbs of ground beef (4% fat). I was really impressed with the outcome, and was amazed that it only took an hour too cook. I was able to prepare and bake cornbread while the chili was simmering in the pot. I have some leftovers in the fridge that will probably be gone by tomorrow! Thanks for sharing this recipe Deb!

I have always wanted to make a traditional chili, but I never have.  I used this recipe tonight, and I will never search for another chili recipe again!  This is seriously so flavorful and delicious.  I followed the directions exactly.  I wouldn't change a thing!  The only thing is it is a TAD too spicy (but I'm a wimp).  I'm not sure how I could lessen the spice flavor?  Suggestions?  I cannot wait to make this for my Mom and get her approval.

Great chili recipe and so easy! I made a larger batch and tried to make it a bit healthier for my family. I used 1 lb. of groud turkey, 1 lb. lean ground beef, and 1 lb. ground pork. I also added in black beans since my family loves beans. You can adjust the spiciness with the heat of the salsa which is nice for my family who doesn't like too much spice. I'm going to make this recipe a lot this fall!

This chili is fantastic!  I used the recipe with a couple of my own customizations and won "Most Original" in our company chili cook-off.  I added a pinch of brown sugar, beef boullion granules and a touch of sour cream to it and it was delicious!!  Will absolutely make it again.  I used medium Pace picante sauce and it had quite a kick to it.  If you prefer chili with a bit less kick to it I suggest using mild picante sauce instead of medium but it had a fabulous flavor, was so easy to make AND it won me $50!!

I found this recipe 2 years ago and have been made it throughout the fall / winter for the past 2 years.  Can't wait for the cooler weather to start making it again.  Everyone raves about it when I make it.

This recipe has all the stuff that I use but I added 1&1/2 tbl. spoons of white sugar, 1 15oz can of sweet corn drained, 2 small cans of tomato paste, 3 stalks of celery cut up, 1 or 2 green bell pepper cut up, 3tbl. spoons corn starch as a thickener.This is more than campfire chile, and you will know what I mean when you dig in. P.S. don't forget the cornbread. If you want 5 stars add these items to the sauce and simmer for 1 hour. If it starts getting to thick just add small amounts of water.

Excellent.  I love my favorite chili recipe, but this is so easy and delicious, I can't imagine making the long version any time soon.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks, Deb.

For a simple & quick chili this is the way to go. I threw it in the crock pot & was done in no time & great taste as well. I used diced tomatoes instead of the sauce as I had no sauce & it was great!

Great. I made it with ground turkey and personally I felt the other ingredients (salsa and chili mix) had enough salt added to them to leave it out. Just added a dash of garlic powder. Hearty and healthy!

Incredible! The best chili I've ever had! I used chili powder (not chili seasoning mix) and only used about 2 Tbsp because my husband doesn't like really spicy food. Amazing!

This truly is by far the best chili recipe ever.  I love thick chili and that's what this is.  I do add more beans and I use ground turkey to make it more healthy.  I also add 1 small jar of tomato paste for the nutrients.  I will add craisins to my little pot of it because I love the sweetness alongside the hot.  Sounds crazy but it is delish!  I make this quite a bit and all I can say is that I probably will make it tonight because now am having a HUGE craving!

AMAZING!  I added 1 small can of Green Chiles snd used 1 can of pinto and 1 can of red kidney beans, both undrained.  Also, I only used 1/2 the amount of salsa and subbed in an 8oz can of diced tomotoes with the juice.  Very hearty.  This chili is similar to Wendy's chili (which I LOVE)!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This chili was good but not blue ribbon like I expected. Since it is easy to make I'll keep it around until I get a GREAT chili recipe. Also, I will cut the recipe in half because I don't wanna live on leftovers more than two days. It went well over white rice and jiffy cornbread on the side.

This was a very easy recipe to follow! For a first timer making chili at home, this recipe rocked! Definitely better day 2 as all chili's usually are. We added a bit more chili powder and salsa, and it had a nice amount of "heat". Will definitely cook this again! Thanks!

I'm not a chili fan, but my husband is and he gives this recipe 5 stars! I did make the following changes: used 1 1/2 pound lean ground beef, used 1 clove minced garlic instead of garlic salt, added 1/2 each of diced red and green peppers and only used 1 can light kidney beans. Watched it closely and found it didn't require 1 hour cooking time. We topped ours with shredded cheddar, a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of crushed Fritos.

Blue Ribbon indeed! I used hot salsa to up the kick factor since my boyfriend and I love spicy food. This recipe creates delicious chili that's also really easy to make when you're short on time and money. It did come out a little more watery than I like my chili to be, so I think next time, I'll be more careful to fully drain the beans, and maybe even add a roux.

Doubled the recipe and brought it to a church luncheon. There wasn't a single spoonful left. Heard it was the best chili ever from some and got many requests for the recipe. Just the right amount of spice for everyone--even my father who cannot handle spicy food (I used Pace Picante HOT salsa).

Amazing!!!!! This was the first time I've made chili and I will NEVER eat chili out of a can again (I'm embarassed that I actually thought that stuf was good...).  This recipe was so easy and quick to make.  This will definitely be my go-to dish to bring to potlucks and make for friends and family.  Thanks Deb for a truly great recipe!  Also, I chopped up a couple of serrano peppers and threw them in the mix with everything else in the crockpot.  Very spicy and sooooo good!!!

Absolutely the easiest and most tasty chili recipe I've tried.  This went together quickly and and is great for dinner on a weeknight since it doesn't have to cook all day.  I also made the chili seasoning recipe from this site as recommended by others and I will never buy store bought chili mix again!

I thought it was great. I customized it a little by doubling the chili seasoning, doubling the salsa, + tsp. cumin and added a cup of strong coffee. I think it was a little dry otherwise.

Followed recipe exactly. Tastes just like what you get at the Wendy's drive-thru. Won't make again. Cheaper at the drive-thru and I can order fries and a frosty.

This is very easy chili to make and tastes good as well. The addition of cinnamon gives it a nice hint of sweetness that my family really enjoys.

Made it with vension and used minced garlic and organic tomato sauce. Best chili that I have ever had.  I am passing this recipe along to all my friends.  The great thing about it is that you can change how spicy it is by that salsa that you use.  Took it to work with mild but when I make it for the guys am going to use extra spicy

Mmmmmm!!!  This really was fantastic and flavorful.  I used 3 T. of the Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe from this site instead of store bought.  My only change was adding a can of diced tomatoes with chilis.

Delicious chili!  I did change a few things to go with what I had - cut it in half as well.  Instead of garlic salt added a finely chopped garlic clove, and instead of adding 1/2 and 1/2 for beans, I just used a can of light red.  Probably added twice as much salsa as is called for, and a bit more of the chili seasoning too.  I like it spicy, and boyfriend doesn't so I added some Red Hot to my bowl as well :)  This came out great, will definitely be a new staple! Leftovers were great for chili dogs the next day!

This was very good and easy to make.   Think I'll try it with chili beans instead of kidney beans next time.  But this gave me a few lunches after and just tasted better each time I ate it.

This recipe was great.  We didn't have any ground beef so we used flank steak (yummy!).  We also added a can of green chilis, chili beans and ranch-style beans.  Everyone really loved it.  We are planning to make it again this week!  Thanks so much!

This is a really good recipe. The salsa added a great depth to the overall flavor. Only thing was, I didn't know if I should use the beans AND the juice they were in. The bean liquid looked kind of goopy, so I used beef broth for a little extra liquid.

Ive tried many chili recipes..many on here, many from friends. This is by far the best chili Ive ever had. It really does resemble Wendys Chili. I had no chili seasoning mix so I made my own using the chili seasoning recipe on here. Instead of tomato sauce, I used a can of stewed tomatoes. I added a can of mushrooms, chopped bell peppers for colour, chopped celery and 3 cloves of garlic. I also simmered the whole thing for 1.5 hours. Absolutely delicious!!

Hubby, who is VERY PICKY, begs me to make this every week!!  I'm making it tomorrow for our monthly BUNKO at our house.  I am going to do it in the crock pot this time though.  I did add 2 whole 16oz cans of Tomato sauce, and a big can Hunts Diced tomatoes with Basil and Oregano.  Even with that it's still a bit thick.  You really can't go wrong with this easy easy recipe.  Oh and I used Lawrys Chili Seasoning!! It's just TOO EASY not to make!!

Very good recipe, although we made a few changes. I subbed 1 lb soy crumbles + 1 can garbanzo beans for the ground beef, and used diced tomatoes (Rotel) with 2 cups tomato sauce. Next time, I will use way less pepper and just use more kidney beans instead of garbanzo beans, and I will use more tomato sauce. Overall, very yummy and filling. Great fall food.

What a fantastic chili!  I eyeballed the chili powder and added a little cornstarch before it finished cooking.  Simmered almost 2 hours total and served with Buttery Corn Bread from this site.  Perfect combination of spicy & sweet!  This recipe was so easy to follow, I already had most of the ingredients in my cupboards.  This will be a staple as the weather continues to get colder!

We loved this chili but the next time I make it I will cut back on the chili seasoning just a bit. It was a little spicey for my taste.I served it with grandmas corn bread from AR.

Five stars for how easy this is!  It's a very good basic chili.  I thought it might taste too much like tomato sauce since it calls for 2 1/2 cups, but that was not the case.  I made it as is and really liked it.  You can adjust the spice, heat, sweetness, etc. based on your preference (and based on what type of chili seasoning and salsa you use).  I used Herdez mild salsa and McCormick Chili seasoning.

AWESOME RECIPE. As a newlywed currently living with my in-laws, I find it difficult to cook for 6+ people (the bro-in-law brings friends over frequently), three of whom have to follow special low-starch diets, and still have downtime, and this recipe is perfect! I adjusted for 8 servings, used a half-pound more beef than the recipe called for, added an extra couple cans of beans, and used a whole 16oz jar of Mrs. Renfro's Roasted Salsa. My husband and new family loved it, the mother-in-law could actually eat it, and there was enough to pack for the husband's lunch for days afterwards. Grade-A recipe!

Pretty good, we add corn and eat it with some corn chips, also use chili beans instead of dark read kidney. We add some Red pepper and cumin to add spice. Very tasty.

Great recipe!  I'm a complete novice when it comes to cooking and this recipe was super easy to make. And, not only was it easy, it has a great taste to it.  Really hit the spot.  Thanks for helping this single guy find a great, easy recipe.

I was a little hesitant to use jarred salsa but I really think it's what elevated this chili from good to great. I added some veggies at the beginning (bell peppers and onions) and stirred in bittersweet chocolate and minced garlic about thirty minutes before I served it. I also left the lid off the slow cooker for the last hour to let it really thicken up. Mine was almost too spicy (I used Hot Salsa and made my own chili seasoning from a recipe on this site: Chili Seasoning Mix II. I should have tested the ancho & chipotle powders I was using because they were super spicy. I tempered the heat with a few scoops of peanut butter...doesn't change the flavor a bit and actually gave the chili a nicer body) Best chili I've ever made.

What a great recipe! I had to cook a pot of chili for a Superbowl party and this looked easy and had great reviews.  Since I had to cook for 25, I had to re-calculate (which is a great feature on All Recipes, BTW)and didn't use as much meat.  Used 1/2 g beef and 1/2 turkey.  Also, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes w/ green chiles, which took it up another notch, but not too hot. I will most definitely use this again!

Great recipe & so easy! After reading some reviews, we used 1 lb. ground beef & 1 lb. Hot sausage, added a small can of chilis & only 1 can of beans since my husband doesn't like alot of them. This was great & I will make again & pass the recipe along to others! Thanks so much for posting!

Great basic recipe! Tastes good on its own but we like it with a bit of kick so we used hot salsa and hot chili powder. We also added a can of Rotel and a small can of diced chilies. It came out nice and spicy. We enjoyed this with the Homesteader Cornbread. They complemented each other nicely. Yum!

This chili is GREAT! Perfect for a day of watching football.  I served it with cheese and tortilla chips.  The only thing I would add is more tomato sauce because it is a little too chunky.

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN BUT THIS TIME I FOLLOWED DEB'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER. THE KEY IS TO USE A GOOD QUALITY CHILI SEASONING. I ADDED AN ENTIRE BOX OF CARROLL SHELBY'S SEASONING (ALL BUT THE SALT PACKET - EVEN THE MASA / THICKENER). I ALSO USED 80/20 BEEF AND DRAINED MOST OF THE FAT (BUT NOT ALL OF IT). MY "BEANS IN CHILI" HATING HUSBAND EVEN LIKED THIS... WOW! :) Not bad, although not my "favorite" chili recipe (by far). This just wasn't spicy enough for me. Actually, this didn't really taste like chili at all (but the texture was spo on...). I made this last night in my slow cooker. Set on low for 8 hours and then put it all in the fridge this morning so that when my dad comes over, he will have something hearty to eat (he's working on a bathroom remodel project). I followed Deb's recipe *mostly* to a T except for how I cooked this and subbing a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes & green chilies (undrained) / a 15 oz. can tomato sauce for the 2 1/2 cups of tomato sauce called for (per another reviewer's suggestion). I also added an entire 16 oz. jar of medium-heat Pace picante sauce and a whole packet (~ 6 T worth) of chili seasoning. Topped with shredded cheese and crushed Frito's, this was pretty good. Thanks for sharing! :-)

It was my first time making chili and it turned out great! I only had a 16 ounce can of tomato sauce so I added 1/2 cup more salsa and it still turned out fine.

This is an easy 'tweekable' chili recipe that is just great for winter cooking. I used 1/2 the jar of salsa and I added a large can of diced tomatoes. Yummy!

I made this once so far and it is really delicious! I used a big can and small can of tomato sauce and I was still short but used a big jar of salsa and made up for it. I had leftovers that I brought to my aunt and grandmother and they both told me last night that they want more chili!!!! High compliments to this recipe! They often tell me that I am gonna be the next best cook (after my grandmother) in the family, but I believe that i believe its only because I LOVE LOVE LOVE to cook. (and great recipes like this one) Thank you again

All I can say in WOW!!!  The was not only the best chili recipe but the absolute best chili I've ever eaten. 

I always make the recipe as given and don't tweak it but instead of the light kidney beans I used chili beans because I love chili beans. 

Honestly I will never make chili any other way.  

Post some more recipes!!!!!! lol

I make this all the time with cornbread and it is always a hit. Very easy to make as well. I usually use mild Pace Picante Sauce and I did use all Dark red kidney beans once when I couldn't find the Light ones. Still came out great!

This is my first time making chili.  I used ground turkey rather than ground beef, one can of crushed tomatoes, and only 3 tablespoons (instead of 4) of chili seasoning.  The recipe does make a lot of chili.  We were eating it for days.  It was very good and I would definitely make it again.

This is a very good chili recipe!  I've made this several times for my husband and he always loves it!  I do not add beans to the recipe since my husband does not like them, but it still turns out very delicious!

I didn't think that I would find a chili recipe that I liked as much as my mother's, but this is delicious!  

I "mostly" followed the recipe, but made the following changes: 1/2 t. garlic salt and also 1/2 t. of Petey's Garlic & Onion seasoning; 1 full packet of chili seasoning (it needs it - otherwise starts to lose flavoring); about 10-12 oz. Med. chunky salsa (I used a generic brand to keep cost down and still was yummy); 1 can pinto beans in addition to kidney beans.

This was so easy and really good! I never made chili before and I do not like it spicey. I made it with turkey and cut it in 1/2.  It was really good with tastefully simple beer bread. Thanks for the great recipe!

Tasted Great! I reduced the pepper, and added a can of chili ready crushed tomatoes and 1 can of chili beans and water(just because my family doesn't like thick chili). My 6 picky eaters request I make it again.

The first time I made this I used morning star veggie crumbles in place of hamburger. I used chili mix II, but it was too spicy for me. Lastnight I made this recipe again and it was a HUGE hit, with vegans, veg heads and carnavoirs alike!!! I used a whole onion,veggie crumbles, subbed half mexican tomatoes for the sauce, added 5 heaping T. of chili seasoning pluse a 1/2t of cumin.I used the Chili Seasing MixII from this site, but I cut the cayenne in half because it's just too spicy for me.

Verrry Good! I added half of a jalapeno that I had in the fridge and I only used 1 lb of "meat" (I used vegetarian soy crumbles). I used two 15 oz cans of tomato sauce and a 16oz jar of salsa. I threw all ingredients in a crock pot (since the soy crumbles are already cooked you can do that) and cooked on high for over an hour. Turned out fantastic!

This is the best tasting chili I have ever had.  My only complaint it that it is WAY too thick for my taste.  I will be adding a can of tomato soup next time and will continue to alter to get it to my personal preference for thickness.  Flavor-wise, though, the best ever.  Thanks!

My husband says that this was the best chili I made so far!  I accidentally added a whole 16 oz jar of picante sauce, but I was glad I did.  Since we like it spicy I added more seasonings such as more chili powder, cumin, fajita seasoning, and a dash of cayenne.

This is my first Chili, and I just love it so much, I'm going to keep making it, and I am the kinda person who always changes up things, whereas this, is just right, and easy! I do like to use 1lb ground turky, and 1lb ground beaf.

I've used this recipe for years now and it always gets rave reviews. It has become infamous among our circle of friends. I love how you can switch it up just by trying different salsas. Thanks!

I loved how simple this recipe was to make.   The first time I made it I followed it exactly and it was very good.  The second time I did make a few changes however due to what I had available and preference. My husband liked it better with these few tweaks...
I chopped some green bell pepper and added crushed garlic while I was browning the onion and beef.  I also added a small  can (I think 8oz) of garbonzo beans and a   15 oz can of black beans that have been rinsed and drained instead of 2 kinds of kidney beans.  My husband came home and was like "what smells wonderful?  I want some of whatever you're cooking!"  My kids even thought it was yummy with crackers and cheese melted on top!  This is a recipe I don't think you can mess up and cooks in about an hour but can be simmered longer for even better flavor.  thanks Deb for the easy chilli!

This was pretty darn good.  I exchanged one can of kidney beans for Ranch Style beans with Jalapenos.  This really kicked it up a notch.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  This was a big hit with my husband and me.  I can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow!

Definitely good - very basic chili.  A little too much meat for me - but I guess Chili is supposed to be all meat anyways.  Very good though.

This is a great, classic chili recipe. Everyone loved it and the leftovers were even better the next day. I used Pace Picante sauce and an entire package of McCormick chili seasoning.  I also used 2 cans of Chili beans instead of a can of light and a can of dark kidney beans. Yum!

Wonderful chili recipe. This is such a thick chili and full of flavor, hard to believe it was so easy to make. I am always switching recipes trying to find the perfect one...now I have, so there is no need to search anymore.

This is very good as is but also a great base to add or subtract as you like. If you like spicy you'll need to add that in but it has a great flavor even without the heat.

I didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted a can of manwich, still tasted Great! I let all other ingredients simmer in a different pan while cooking meat, It was all done in 30min. Top with cheese and crackers.

Easy to make! Husband loved it! Would replace one of the kidney beans with lima beans to mix it up! Still a great recipe.

This was excellent! We were looking for something warm for a VERY cold day and this was it! Followed exactly, it is spicy but really good. Topped it off with some sour cream, cheese, green onions and Fritos. Big hit with the family. Thank you!

Got lots of compliments on this one! I added a can of rotel and used pinto beans and chili beans (hot) instead of the kidney beans. It was good with some cheese on top!!!

Thank you, Deb! I needed to make a meal for 20 people and decided to make chili. I decided to give your recipe a shot. It was a HIT! I thought I would have enough left over to at least have one more meal...negative - there was not a drop of chili left. My mom wants to make it now for a Superbowl party. I am now adjusting the recipe to feed 25.

This is a very good and easy chili recipe, but be aware that it is spicy. I used the Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site and followed the recipe exactly. The entire family enjoyed it, even though we have different levels of spicy "tolerance", so I will definitely make this again! Thank you, Deb, for the recipe.

This was prety easy to make.I made the mistake of adding the whole packet of chili seasoning. Next time I'll add just half. It still came out good.

Excellent, easy chili - my standby from now on! I didn't have tomato sauce so in my halved recipe I added 1 can tomato paste w/ 2 cans of water.

Followed recipe except added 1 tbsp of chili powder...we like it a bit spicier. Based on all the reviews it seems like you can pretty much add what you like and use this as a good base recipe. The salsa does wonders to the chili. My husband loved it which is a great compliment since this was the first time I ever made chili from scratch.

Thanks for an easy recipe!  I'm not an expert at cooking and this came out perfect.  I did add a can of stewed tomatoes to it which I think added a lot.

This chili was okay but I found it kind of bland compared to chili I've enjoyed in the past. I had to add more chili power, garlic salt and onion powder until the taste was near my expectations.

Excellent Chili.  My husband said this is the best chili he had ever tasted.  Although I did use only one can of light red kidney beans and added some Texas Pete's hot sauce.  We ate it with Frito Lay Scoops and low fat sour cream.

I have to rave about this recipe!!  It is super easy and very, very good.  My husband liked it a lot and I have spoiled him by making the more labor-intensive boilermaker recipe from this site.  I don't know if I will ever make it again as this is easy and just as good in my opinion!!!

Great easy recipe. My wife loved it and asked what I did this time because it was so much better than usual. I fessed up. :) The only change I made was to add a beer at the beginning to cut the thickness a bit.

I made this last night because I had all the ingredients on hand, which is obviously a plus.  I let it simmer for 2 hours on the stove & I used one can of kidney beans, and one an of pinto beans.  It turned out excellent.  Wonderful flavor with a bit of kick, but nothing too spicy.  My 6 and 7 year old daughters even liked it.  I will definatly make again.  Super easy to prepare and very low cost!

The best part of this website is finding great recipes then making them your own!  I liked this chili very much and over the years have tweaked it so it better suits my families taste.  I use 1 lb ground turkey, 1/2 onion, 1 tsp crushed garlic from a jar, 2 T mild chili seasoning packet, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of tomato sauce, 1/4 C Pace mild salsa, 1 can dark red kidney beans, 1 can white beans (great northern).  I serve it over saffron rice with a little sour cream and some corn bread.  Thanks Deb!

Aaaah, yum!!! This is a very good chili and not hard to make at all.  It is a thicker chili, not what I am used to but still taste wise, awesome...  This is my new chili recipe... Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe Deb!!

mmmmm, we really enjoyed this chili. i made a few changes like using minced garlic, adding more onion, substituting stewed tomatoes for the salsa (what was on hand) & hot chili seasoning to spice up the tomatoes. delicious the same day or as a leftover. many thanks deb!

Amazing recipe, easy to make, and though I doubled everything for a slightly larger crowd, thinking to have leftovers later, it was gone and people were looking for more.  Follow the original recipe for the best flavor.

Easy and tasty. I sprinkled the chili with cheese and served with tortilla chips. However, this chili was so good on its own that we ended up not eating many chips. We left out the onion, but the chunky salsa has onions in it so we didn't miss anything.

Good, easy recipe. I used "Hot Chili" seasoning, medium salsa, 1/2 can dark kidney beans, 1/2 can of black beans. I slowcooked on low for 3.5 hours and served for dinner the next day (reheated in slow cooker). It was very tasty. Garnished with cheese and sourcream and cornbread on the side. Boyfriend and I both thought it was delicious, especially compared to ease of prep. Will possibly use more tomato sauce, and probably add some chili powder for more seasoning. Will also use hot salsa instead of medium, as it wasn't very "alarming" at all.

This is the simplest chili I've ever made - and the best!  I used the chili seasoning II recipe from this sight, a whole jar of tostitos brand medium salsa and the full can (32 oz) of tomato sauce.

WOW. Really really great chili, and easy too! Knowing that salsa brands can taste different I was at a loss as to which brand to choose. My husband and I like food with a kick (spicy but not to make your eyes water!) so I chose Emeril's Chunky Hot salsa and "Chili Man's" packet chili seasoning. I followed the recipe exact, served it with cornbread and we both loved it. Not too soupy, not too thick -spicey and just right!

I've made this chili probably 2 or 3 times now and everytime I love it! It's so easy to make and has a very good flavor. All though I definately suggest using a sweeter salsa instead of the saltier kinds.

This chili is terrific!!  Everytime I make this I get requests for the recipe and then people are surprised at how easy it is to make.  I substitute black beans and Northern white beans instead of the kidney beans.  Sometimes I use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 zesty hot sausage for a little more kick!  You'll love it!

This was really good.  It's hard to find a chili recipe that's a little bit different, but this was -- only slightly, but enough that it made a difference.  I think it was the salsa that made it.

A good basic recipe with plenty of room for one's personal adjustments to taste. I picked this out because I hadn't made chili in a long time and wasn't sure I knew how anymore. This gave me an excellent starting point with which I could then add to it to make it my own.

Great Chili!  Very easy to make.  I also made extra so that it could be frozen and reheated easily.  It's just as great when defrosted and reheated.

this chili is fabulous and when i bring it to work it gets eaten as soon as i put it out!  i usually modify the recipie to add jalapenos and corn.  i like spicy things so i usually use hot salsa.  this is quick, easy and tasty!  definitely a keeper!

I made a couple of changes:  added a chopped green pepper, used 2-8oz cans of tomato sauce plus 15oz of diced chili ready tomatoes.  Also used the Chili Seasoning II recipe for my spices.

Great ultra-easy cold weather comfort food!  I browned the beef and onions the night before and got up and added all the ingredients to my slow cooker in the morning.  Cooked on low for 8 hours and came home to some of the best chili I've ever made.  I did add a can of beef broth to keep it from getting too dry and used one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans.  Definitely a keeper!!

This is my new chili recipe.  I made a few minor changes.  I didn't use a can of light beans, just 2 cans of dark.  I didn't use an onion just alot of onion powder.  And because we love garlic and spice I added extra garlic powder, red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.  I wasn't sure if I should have drained the beans or not so I drained them into a bowl, but it turned out that I did add the juice, not for flavor but to help thin it a bit.

This was Easy and Yummy!  My family of 4 devoured the entire pan at one sitting.  I used close to 12oz of Pace Salsa "HOT".  It really gave it a great kick.  I also used an entire pkg of Williams Chili Mix.  I can see this recipe becoming a family favorite!  THANK YOU DEB!!!

I took this to a potluck and had many compliments.  My hubby said this was one of the better chili recipes I have made for him but it doesn't get a five star rating because it didn't give him the "wow" factor.  The recipe definitely makes more than 8 servings, it actually   filled 12 people.  When making it for the  family I would definitely half the recipe.

Very good and very easy. I always like to make a recipe as written the first time and this one is good as is. The only thing I changed the second time was, I used a whole onion and mixed up the beans, one can each red kidney, black, and pinto. Next time I might try hot salsa instead of medium.

Excellent chili! I improvised (of course) :-) But it was outstanding! I substituted 1 pound of spicy ground sausage for 1 pound of the ground beef. Also, I didn't have any pre-mixed chili seasoning on hand, so I pulled a reciped for a mix up on this site, and as I stated, the final product turned out WONDFERFULLY!

This was very good.  You could really taste the salsa, which gave it a very different flavor.  I used ground turkey and 1 can of kidney beans with 1 can of pinto beans.  I also took the suggestion of using 1 can of tomtao sauce and 1 can diced tomatos with garlic.  I also didn't have "chili seasoning" so I just used 2 TBSP. chili powder.  It was really good!

Wonderful and soooo easy.  Only changes:  I added fresh garlic with the onions and meat while browning, added only 1 can (almost 2 cups) tomato sauce, and 1 can diced tomatoes (chili spiced) with juice.  I also added about 2 cups of water because it was a little thick for me.  My husband spiced it up with a little tobasco (even though we used medium heat salsa).  Served with sharp cheddar, sour cream, and crackers.  Just better and better as leftovers are reheated!

UNBELIEVEABLE! I've never made chili. I've never even LIKED chili and this recipe changed my mind. It was delicious and I froze the extra and it still tasted amazing upon reheating. I would definitely recommend this recipe. Enjoy!

Incredibly easy, and even more delicious! I typically use 1# ground beef and 1# ground turkey, and 1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 crushed tomatoes. I've used McCormick's chili seasoning (1/2 hot and 1/2 regular) but Williams is the best (I have to order from Amazon). Typically add a can of pinto beans to make it even more hearty. Pace medium picante sauce is our fave.

I followed this recipe exactly as directed, and it was just so-so.  I've gotten far better results following the recipes that are printed on the backs of "chili kits".
