For those that have reviewed this recipe and said that it had a chalky taste, it's your GF pancake mix.  I usually use Pamela's pancake mix and it doesn't have the chalky taste.

These are REALLY good! I used Gluten Free Bisquick and made them vegan by using vanilla almond milk. I added a little more almond milk than called for to make it more workable. They turned out really good! Definitely cured my pastry cravings I've had since going gluten free and since I'm vegan! LOVE THESE!!!

yummy. made them with Pamela's.  be careful to make shallow indentation because the jam will bake through the bottom of the danish.

These are delicious!  I use seedless raspberry jam and almond pie filling in the centers-AMAZING flavor and texture.  I've found that if you substitue half and half for the milk, the texture of the danish is very rich and smooth.

These were good! I used a combination of 75% Bob's Red Mill and 25% Namaste. The chalky texture may be due to the brand of mix used. I prefer Maple Grove Farms, but didn't have it on hand. I sprinkled sliced almonds on top. I will make these again but next time I would make them a little smaller & thinner. Thanks for giving us a new breakfast option!!

Judith is right - these are too chalky (I called it floury)...next time I'm going to try 1/2 cup less flour and maybe an egg - maybe that will work...I used the cream cheese filling on this site by pokey-turtle & that was really GOOD!

It does not taste like the flaky buttery danish pastries I am used to.  However, it is probably the best thing I am going to get while dealing with gluten sensitivity.  It tasted a lot like pancake with jelly.  It was easy to make, it tasted good...I've eaten three of them, but it is NOT a standard danish.  So while I definitely will be making these again, I still mourn the memory of the danishes I knew.

Okay, this was AMAZING!!! So delicious and so easy, one heck of a combo! Soft, moist, simple and homey.  Perfect on a cold day with a warm drink. I made a blueberry cheese kind using homemade blueberry jam and the cream cheese filling by Pokey Turtle that other reviewers mentioned, sooo yummy and perfect compliment to this pastry. I used Maple Grove Farms pancake mix, half and half instead of milk (to add more moisture to avoid the chalkyness other reviewers talk about), Cabot unsalted butter, vanilla extract instead of almond since I don't care for almond extract and I added an egg and a tblsp of apple cider vinegar for a fluffier pastry . All in all, the flavor was smooth and creamy, rich and lightly sweet. Not a traditional danish, but delicious nonetheless. Thank you so much Melissa for a wonderful and fast recipe and thank you so much all those who reviewed and left helpful tips! It's so nice when those with food allergies help each other make delicious food. We can avoid gluten and still eat well, this recipe proves it.

Not bad. Tasted more like  a biscuit with jam rather than a danish. Very crumbly, maybe an egg and less flour next time .

I liked these danishes.  They were good w/o being too sweet.  I think they are perfect to have with a cup of coffee or tea.  From my experience, the consistency varies depending on the gf mix used.  Some mixes absorb more liquid than others and that definitely affects the ratio of ingredients.  I used Bisquick gf mix, and had to add a little more milk.  The texture of mine was similar (not exactly) to the biscuits that they serve at red lobster.  That makes me think, they might also work with cheese and other spices for a variation.  Overall, I was very happy with them, and so was my family who do not even eat gluten free.  Thank you for posting.

I made this recipe and loved it. I used Pamela's baking mix. I wanted a larger size danish, so I used a ice cream scoop to scoop the batter out.  I didnt have almond extract so I used vanilla. I used cherry pie filling instead of raspberry jam....soooo goood.  I cooked them a little longer since the danish was bigger. A trick I learned from a another celiac ...wet two fingers to make the indentation in the danish, it keeps it from sticking.

I don't know what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe, but my batter was like a pancake batter - way too thin to make what the picture looks like.  I ended up treating it as a cake batter and swirled the raspberry jam in the mixture.  When I took it out of the oven, I immediately smeared on more raspberry jam.  When it was cool, I drizzled the icing over the top.  It tastes very good.  I will try it again to see if I made a mistake in the amount of milk.  Anyway, thanks for the recipe!

We loved these. I had to substitute vanilla flavored coconut milk ( I am allergic to dairy) for milk and margarine for butter. I added an egg because one of the reviews mentioned they tasted like pancakes. I left out the vanilla from the icing  because the coconut milk had vanilla in it Granted, they don't taste like the danish we remember but they are soft, sweet and yummy. Hubby loved them. Thanks for the recipe!

Chalky is the word that comes to mind. Accepting that gluten free does have limitations, I was still disappointed with this recipe. The raspberry jam and almond extract made it tolerable.

I have made these a few times and found these tips helpful. (1) use GF bisquick for a smoother,  less grainy consistency (2) substitute heavy cream or half and half for the milk to make them more moist (3) let them sit in an air tight container overnight.  That makes them even more moist.  I brought these to a holiday party as the GF baked dish and everyone gobbled them up!

This recipe was so good! I used a cream cheese filling and I thought they were wonderful. However, these were not so much a Danish as they were a buiscit or a cookie. But the flavor was great and the texture was nice (not chalky at all-I used the King Arthur pancake mix), I will definitely use this again!

The only thing missing is the flaky texture that a glutenous danish would have; this one is a bit dense.  Taste is great though!!  Definitely a recipe worth playing around with!

The flavours are great! I used a home-made strawberry-peach marmalade instead of raspberry jam. I found that the baking time was hard to get right. The bottoms of the pastries were a dark gold while the tops were very pale. The jam ended up falling through the middles. Maybe I need to move the oven rack up a step next time?

It tasted like a biscuit with jam and icing.  Even with good gluten free pancake mix, it was still a bit dry.  I made some with jam, some with lemon curd, and some with gluten free apple pie filling.  I was hoping to take these for a baby shower brunch where the hostess can't eat gluten, but not sure they're going to make the cut.  thankfully, I have a backup to take.  I'll see if these get any better after sitting overnight in a tupperware.  I saw another reviewer saying that helped them be moister.

I thought these were pretty good and easy to make.  I will try them again with a different brand of mix to see if they turn out less crumbly.

I made these today, and found them to be delicious! More like a scone, but with more flavor. I used raspberry jelly and apricot preserves as the fruit filling. Also, I used Pamela's GF pancake mix. Nice texture.

These are fabulous!  Pamela's GF mix is perfect to use! I have filled with blueberry pie filling (since you use so little, freeze the leftover filling in several small containers for the next few times), strawberry and raspberry jam.  A HUGE hit with my friends and family, especially when served with cheesy potato egg casserole!

I made these with Pamela's gluten-free pancake/baking mix, and they were wonderful!  But then again, I haven't eaten a regular danish for a long time, since I found out I don't tolerate wheat so well, so that might skew my opinion a bit, I was just so happy to have a treat that doesn't make me sick.  I didn't have almond extract, so I just used vanilla, and it was still good.  I used raspberry jam, next time I might try cherry or blueberry jam.  And when I made the glaze, I added some softened butter, for more of a drizzly butter-cream type frosting than just a plain glaze, that was good too.

These are fantastic when fresh, but they get cakey by the next day.

Way too dry and blah. She needs to specify a brand of pancake mix. Very disappointed.

my gluten-free husband liked them a lot - added way more milk to the mixture to make it "sticky".  Experimented with different fillings: peach/mango preserves, blackberry, poppy seed filling.  Yum!

This is perfect! I am always so skeptical of gluten free recipies because most times I'm afraid they'll taste horrible. But this was amazing!

Thanks Melissa

The flavor is very good using Pamela's pancake mix. Easy to make and not much time involved either. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I used the Aldi brand gluten free pancake and baking mix.  I haven't made it before with anything else but I thought it turned out pretty good.  I don't think its quite a danish texture but I still think my two GF kids will be excited to eat something fun at Easter brunch tomorrow that kind of looks like what the rest of the family is eating, so I consider it a win!  Thank you!

Danish was chalky. Added 1 1/2 cups milk and an egg for mixture to stay together. Might try one more time with different gf mix.

I made this with nameste perfect flour blend (from costco) and it came out great.  It reminds me of a Fisher scone more than a danish however.

My dad is new to gluten sensitivity. Added 1 egg and used half and half instead of milk. Added extra dry mix to compensate for egg. Used homemade apple filing and lemon filing,  both were great. Pastry is cakey but good with the fillings. And could be customized to your tastes. Great starter recipe for gf!

I love this recipe!  I made cheese danish instead of jam.  As someone else suggested, I used the cheese filling from Pokey Turtle on this site.  It was absolutely delicious.  I also used Pamela's mix.....the taste and texture were perfect.  I was worried about what refrigerating it would do to the texture, but I think it made it even BETTER.  Even though it's not a traditional danish, there is something about it that is very satisfying.  In fact, I wish it wasn't so good......I now think I need to have a steady diet of Gluten Free Cheese Danish!!

These turned out delicious! Was worried because mine turned out ugly because the batter was so sticky but they were a hit. I will definitely make again. I would double the recipe if you plan to entertain as it does not make a lot.

These were really good. I made them for Easter brunch and they were all gone by end of the day!  The glaze was a little thin so, next time Ill add less milk. I used Pamela's pancake mix as I do for most of my sweet baked goods. These do not have the flaky pastry texture of traditional Danish, but the taste is as close as I can remember!

I’m the one who has to be gluten free, but ironically, my husband and son liked these even more than I did. I wouldn’t call them a “pastry”; they have more of a fluffy scone, type-of consistency. I was hoping for something flakier, so I was a little disappointed. But overall, they are pretty tasty, easy, and I will make them again. I might try them with a cream cheese and jam filling next time.

Just made this - have been craving a nice danish for a long while now. Reduced the serving size to 1 and baked this for dessert tonight. Kept recipe as is except I didn't add the drizzle on top and I added a layer of cream cheese between the dough and jam before baking. So good!

I have gluten allergies my husband doesn't and we fought over the last one!! They were wonderful especially when it's been forever without a pastry. I didn't have any jelly so I used apple butter in the middle. Will make again and again!!

This was good, I used almond milk because we have some dairy sensitivities in the family, but it turned out great, but it needed a bit more mixing to get it right. I also added more powdered sugar to get the icing to thicken up, because it was runny. But I will definitely make it again.

It's been far too long since I've had real danish, but this is definitely a satisfying substitute. I used cherry jam as a filling  (turned out delicious) and I'm also experimenting with cream cheese. I can't see how these would be any more perfect, especially being gluten free. Kudos!
