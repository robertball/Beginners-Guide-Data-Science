Made exactly as written for CQ#3 & I love this recipe, Mike.  This is a very tasty quick-fix that comes together in minutes. I can't wait to share this recipe w/my best friend here who has 2 severely lactose intolerant daughters. She tries very hard not to let them feel deprived & will be very pleased to welcome your recipe into her home -  Just as I was. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper that will be repeated. :-)
