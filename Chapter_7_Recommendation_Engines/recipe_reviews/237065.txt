I've made this recipe a few times and it is awesome! The last time, I used fresh yellow fin tuna in place of the canned tuna. I cheated by not making the sauce of this recipe the last time by using Chef John's "Hide The Little Fish" pasta/pizza sauce that I had leftover in the fridge and it was great! I prefer using imported pasta from Italy because it is pressed through bronze extruding equipment that gives the pasta more texture and that makes any sauce stick to it a little more. Another tip: ~ 1 teaspoon of anchovy paste equals 1 anchovy filet. I keep a tube of anchovy paste in my fridge for sauce recipes like this or for my Caesar salad dressing recipe.

Excellent!  I know this as tuna fish gravy.  I didn't  have capers and I used red wine.  Traditionally no parmesan cheese with fish in it, but I love it on my pasta.  I like to saute my tuna fish for a minute or so after putting the garlic in and use my immersion blender on my tomatoes before adding it into the pot.  I also like to simmer it covered an hour or so.  Thank you for reminding me of another great economical way of getting fish  into my diet.

I probably shouldn't rate this because I left out a couple key ingredients but I loved it so much I just had to. Plus I can only imagine it would be even better with the full ingredients. This is what I changed. I left out the capers and anchovies because I didn't have any. Also I used red wine instead of white because that's what was open. Also used dry parsley instead of fresh. Other than that, I made it as specifies and boy was it delicious. I will update this rating when I make it again with all the right ingredients.

I'm nursing an injury and having a grocery crisis.  Had two cans of regular tuna in water so I modified this recipe to what I had.  We needed enough for two plus lunches tomorrow and it worked out pretty well for four servings.  Used three anchovies, 4 tbsp capers, olive oil, but had to substitute reserved tuna water, white wine vinegar, a tiny bit of mirin and enough water to make 1 cup of liquid to replace the 1/2 cup of white wine that is called for.  Added that and then reduced it down to about 6 tbsp liquid then added one can of red pasta sauce and one can of diced Italian style tomatoes, thickened it then added the two cans of drained tuna and the parsley.  Thickened it a bit more and then added very al dente vegetable spaghetti noodles (1 lb. when dry) and let it finish.  Used double spices and subbed Italian seasoning for oregano.  We garnished with lots of fresh parsley, shredded Italian cheese blend ( out of Parmesan,) some of the olive oil from the anchovies and a little minced anchovy cause we love them. . Awesome!  A small mixed green salad with a slightly sweet vinaigrette, some crusty bread and a slice of cheesecake would have made this restaurant worthy lol.  Note: doubling the red pepper and cayenne was fine the first day, but a little spicier than necessary the next day (still good though.)

Made as directed, it's a tuna "bolognese" and is very tasty.  First  time I made it I didn't tell my husband what it was because I thought he'd prejudge "tuna spaghetti".  However, he really enjoyed the dish.  In fact, he asked for it again.  Made it last night --- yum!

Delicious! I saw the video last week and went to Food Wishes to get the recipe; I'm glad it's on the site. We omitted the Parmesan.

`Mamma Mia, this is fabulous pasta!   Thanks Chef John, you've impressed my taste buds again.      When possible, be sure to use San Marzano tomatoes.  They are well worth the extra $1-2, and they are most certainly different from other tomatoes: sweeter, firmer, lower in acid, and fewer seeds.      My only change to this recipe is that I use more tuna.    I make the recipe as directed, and at the time of serving, I top each portion with a generous dollop of flaked tuna.  I use albacore packed in olive oil, and I do not drain it.  I pour the tuna and oil into a bowl, break up the tuna with a fork, and it immediately absorbs the olive oil.    Beautiful!

So so so delicious. I will definitely make this again. I didn't have an anchovy so I used two sardines, and also had no wine so I substituted juice from one large lemon. So yummy and easy!

I would make this one every day until I couldn't eat it any more. This was the most enjoyable pasta dish I've made/eaten in a very long time. I had to leave the table after two helpings for fear I would just keep eating! My wife's comment was, "I can see why Chef John says he makes this once a week!"

This is a fantastic recipe. We have it once a week at least. Tuna in oil was on sale last week so I bought 10 cans. I love it.

Great recipe for a filling and flavorful weeknight meal. I served mine with zucchini "noodles" and they soaked up that salty, spicy sauce!

Loved this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand except for the San Marzano tomatoes so I took 2 cans of Fire roasted diced tomatoes and I pulsed it in my blender to get it to a "crushed" consistency.  This was a quick and easy meal that I will definitely keep close at hand.  I think i would like to try it with a can of salmon next time.  Overall, it is a great dish!!

Go, anchovies! A wonderful introduction to traditional italian cooking. Just had it for dinner tonight and my 6 year old loved it. We made it non-spicy for her, and then added pepper flakes for us... I will add that this is a recipe where high-quality ingredients make a better dish, so spring for the italian pasta and tuna, and even the San Marzano tomatoes, it is worth it.

I made this last night and it is truly among the best meals you can make from stuff you already have around the house. I've had this type of meal with crab meat since I was a kid catching blue claws at the Jersey Shore so I hoped this cheaper, on hand option was good. It sure is. It's not as sweet as crab, but as John says, it's meatier. Two notes -  cans of tuna are not generally 7 oz so I used the large 9 oz can. Dry pasta comes as 16 oz, but 8 - 12 oz is all you should make to let this sauce take center stage. I used angel hair pasta which is not really my favorite, next time I will use cavatelli (the preferred pasta for crab gravy) or rotelli which will hold the sauce much better.  This recipe is truly a keeper!

5 stars but only provisionally, contingent on using only yellow fin tuna, canned (Genova is a very good brand) or fresh, as per Dale below. Remember when that singer Jessica Simpson became an internet laughingstock for asking her boyfriend "Is Chicken-of-the-Sea really chicken?" Silly as she was, she did have kind of a point. Most American canned tuna is almost tasteless, and a lot of it is (I think) not quite tuna but the related species bonito and albacore. Anyway, tasteless!

Really simple. It packs a lot of taste. I used a whole rolled 2oz cento (with capers in olive oil) can. Cirio italian crushed tomatoes with onion and garlic. I was generous with my garlic bc the cloves I had were small and nonetheless I love garlic. I used one can of tuna with oil and one in water—-it’s what I had . Didn’t hold back with the red pepper kinda just eyeballed it. I wish I did have fresh parsley but dried parsley held down the fort. Sprinkled some peco-romano and was wowed. It’s meaty and so simple. Definitely a recipe to change things up.

Good enough to become a staple, but while I found domestic yellowfin tuna packed in olive oil was fine,  the tomatoes used are also key. The dish can be bland if the tomatoes are bland. In my last go-round i would up adding a quarter cup red wine and a teaspoon of brown sugar at the end to brighten it up and then adjusted the salt, but this would vary with how sweet and how acid the tomatoes are. And good, freshly grated parm is key.

After I saw this recipe on Food Wishes I had to make it right away, and I make this dish often, as we literally crave it. Perfect for a weeknight supper.  It's quick, easy, budget and pantry-friendly, and so delicious!  Chef John, I love you!

For a more traditional way to prepare this, before starting the recipe toast some breadcrumbs first, then reserve and proceed. After plating the sauced pasta, substitute the breadcrumbs for the cheese.

My husband and I tried this recipe tonight. 
I will admit that we used tuna in water,  which may have been an issue. But we both feel the addition of shallots  sauted  withe the tuna and  anchovies, more anchovies, and more capers would probably benefit this recipe. Coming from an Italian family I was always taught that you don't put cheese on fish or fish sauces. While I was hesitant to do so, I did for this recipe because it needed something

Delicious!  I didn’t have any parsley and it was still delicious. I will definitely make this again.

My Mother use to make this all the time when I was kid. She said she got the recipe from a neighbor when we lived in Sicily. My Dad and brother never liked it, so me and my Mother would dive right it and eat as much as we could. My Mother passed away when I was in my early teens. So, I never had the recipe to cook it for myself. Thank you Chef John for bringing this delicious recipe back into my life.

Well let me say first that I used Chef John's Olive Oil Poached Tuna for this recipe which is a great way to prepare Tuna!  This recipe was easy to make but the sauce left me a little off, I made the sauce exactly as called for but continued to add more oregano along with slat and pepper to move it away from an acidic tomato flavor, I never added sugar but might have some on hand the next time around.  While the sauce never got to exactly where I wanted it was very good!

I hate canned tuna and was surprised by how good it turned out! We had a bunch in the pantry waiting to get used up! We added jalapeños and poblano peppers. I would make it even spicer next time and add mushrooms.

A tasty alternative to regular spaghetti. I did not have thick spaghetti so I used fettuccine noodles. I will have to make again with regular spaghetti and a better grade of tuna. Now what do I do with the rest of that can of anchovies?

I made this today, as I didn't have anything thawed to cook and wanted to use what I had available. It was great! It took me a full hour to prepare & cook, so Chef John was quite accurate in his timing. During the 10 min. of simmering (twice), I was able to make up a cup of aioli, and to clean up the kitchen. At the end, I only had the pan the tuna was cooked in to wash. Anyway, my family loved this recipe. I made it almost exactly in accordance with the recipe. I didn't have the recommended San Marzano tomatoes (I live in Greece, and don't think they exist here), so I used  1 can of chopped Italian tomatoes (400 grams) and a container of Italian passato (500 grams), which would have been a little more than the 3 cups in the recipe. I also used two cans of oil-packed tuna. It turned out lovely.  I didn't have fresh parsley, and don't really find that dried parsley does much for any dish, so I left it out. My daughter doesn't like her pasta with cheese (silly girl) so she omitted it, but the rest of us enjoyed it. I get my Parmigiano in the form of Grana Padano, freshly grated at the delicatessen.

I'm trying to eat more tuna, but honestly, I hate it. I thought this dish was very palatable, despite my personal dislike for the main ingredient. I did try the crushed tomato style recommended in the recipe, and I'm sold on that! Also, have no idea what to do with the rest of the anchovies now!

Sooo good! I didn't get to use anchovies, parsley, or capers because I didn't have any on hand : / but the rest was all put in and it was really delicious. Maybe next time I can add the other stuff and see how more delicious it can be : ) thank you John!
