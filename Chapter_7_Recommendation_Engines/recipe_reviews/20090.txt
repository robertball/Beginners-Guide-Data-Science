YUMMY! I'm sure it would be great as written, but I was looking for a main dish, so after reading other reviews I used 2 large zucchini and devided 1/2 lb browned ground beef seasoned w/ italian seasoning between each half. I was out of sour cream, so I sub'd cottage cheese & a little lemon juice in the cheese mixture and added a little oregano. I didn't have a pan big enough to boil the squash in, so I just put them in the oven w/ a little water in the pan while I was mixing up the filling & baked them for 20 mins. after adding the filling.  My whole family loved these.

Very good recipe. However I added some shredded mozzarella and provolone to the cream cheese mixture. Also after putting the cream cheese mixture in I sprinkled on more cheese, tehn sprinkled with paprika. My husband loved them. I served them as an appetizer for the hockey game.
We'll definately make them again.

My family loved this recipe!  I added mozzarella cheese, and used fat free sour cream and fat free cream cheese.  My kids, who are getting sick of zucchini, even loved it!

One of my favorites. Be careful to not over-boil the zucchini or it will be soggy and won't hold the mixture well.

This filling had such a rich taste to it, that I found making it in smaller boats was a big success. Every one at the table wanted the recipe!  Hint: I put the filling in a zip seal bag and cut the corner to squeeze it into the boats.

Yummy recipe...i will go a little lighter on the garlic next time (and I am a garlic lover!)and I will probably use a medium zucchini with the rest of the ingredients cut in half. There was just a little bit too much filling. I will definitely be making this again.

This was okay. I wish I had taken the advice of previous reviewers and cut down on the garlic though; it made it too spicy. I had two very large zucchini from the garden, so I doubled the recipe...but I didn't need to - we had way too much filling, and it overpowered the zucc's flavor completely. I might try this again keeping these things in mind; I think these changes would make a positive difference. I also like the idea of adding taco seasoned meat or italian sausage to the mixture. hhhmmm...

I LOVE this recipe.  It is the best.  I have seen this recipe on other sites and have always enjoyed it.  Sometimes if I want this as a side to mexican dishes I add a half tablespoon of chili powder in with the stuffing mixture.  YUM!!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. I used a medium sized zucchini, boiled it in SALTED water for 5 minutes, then immersed it in ice water for later use. I also prepared the filling early. I cut back a bit on the garlic as suggested, and added a little salt and pepper. With it being so cold when I put it in the oven, I needed to bake it longer, but the texture stayed quite firm. I will definitely make this again. Thanks.

Very good.  I used 2 med zucchini and filling was plenty.  I also used only 2 large garlic cloves pressed.  Next time will try with low or no fat dairy products.  Great recipe though very easy.

My family LOVED this!  The store only had very small Zucchini's but I actually like that idea better - then everyone has there own individual serving and no one is fighting over the last piece!

Well, I slightly changed this recipe, and my husband loved it, although it was a bit too garlic-y for me.  (My hubby *loved* it, though.)  I did not boil the zuccini first.  I just scooped out the seeds, then put the cream cheese/sour cream filling in, then baked them.  I liked the texture, which ended up firm.  I'll probably make this side again; however, I'm going to lay off the garlic just a bit.

Delicious side dish and so easy to assemble.  Next time I make this I will either skip the parboiling (15 min was way too long and my zucchini was almost mush) or I will cut it down to 5 min.  Also, while the filling was delicious, it made way too much.  I used less than half for the zucchini and we used the rest as a cracker spread before dinner.

We loved this!  Would definitely not parboil the zucchini next time as others mentioned.  I added a colby/mozzarella mixture to it and it was delicious.  Definitely going to make again.

I had half of a large zucchini that I had picked fresh, so I decided to make this- it turned out really well, despite the fact that I had no sour cream- I used mozzarella instead, laid slices of it on top before baking.  I did not cook the zucchini beforehand so it took a lot longer than 20 minutes to bake in the oven, but it was well worth the wait- my husband loved it, as did I!

I LOVED this stuff - it makes WAY to much stuffing for just one large zucchini though - I could use it up in about 10 zucchini's = great for a party appetizer that way, though - and u can use the cream cheese stuffing on crackers or as a veggie dip on it's own, too, if you have left overs!

This recipe was pretty good however, My grandma used to make something like this. She called it Zucchini Boat. She got a HUGE zucchini from a farmers market. Cut and boiled it the same way, scooped out the insides. Then put salt, pepper and butter all along the inside of the shell. The seeds and stuff that she scooped out she would put into a bowl with lots of butter, salt, pepper and parmersan. She would scoop it all back into the zucchini and top it off with more parmersan. Put it in the oven to crisp up the top. Then we would eat the filling out with a spoon. Oh man I am going to go make me some zucchini boat.

Easy to follow - I baked uncovered. I sliced it to serve it. The next day, with the leftovers, I made a marinara sauce and poured it over the bake. It was even 3x as good. Thanks for this new side dish!

This dish was very yummy.  I used recipe as is, except I used 2 zucchinis, instead of 1.  I made the filling as stated, and it was way too much filling.  I think halving the sour cream, cream cheese, and Parmesan cheese would be sufficient.  It was very easy to make and is a good side dish/appetizer.  Next time I may try to make with ground sausage.  Hmmm...that may be good.

Yummy Yummy!  I changed up a couple things as follows.  I scooped out the inside of the zucchini and sauteed with some onion and the garlic that is called for.  I then mixed all that in with the sour cream/cream cheese/parm mixture. I also added a bit of ricotta cheese b/c I didn't have enough sour cream.  I didn't bother do precook the zucchini at all either, I just cut them in half, scooped out, made the filling and then cooked them for about 7 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.  These were outstanding and could easily be a meal in themselves with the addition of some ground meat which I'm definitely trying next time!

this was ok.  i halved the recipe and used a large zucchini and there was still plenty of filling.  From one of the reviews I skipped the boiling and baked for 20 mins.  Not something I would make often as the filling turned more into a very rich cream sauce after cooking. Would try a lower fat version next time.

I liked it, but won't make very often.  Not sensational.  I did sprinkle mozzarella on top.  Yummy.  Next day it was good sliced and eaten cold.  I found that one giant zucc from the garden was filled perfectly. Not too much filling and the boiling time was great, too (actually, I steamed them for this amt. of time).  Good texture, not mushy but cooked a little beyond al dente.

This was delicious!!! I added about half a cup of mozzarella cheese too and it was soooo good. I could only get super market sized zucchini (about 7 or 8 inches long and fairly thin) so I used three. Wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!

The topping was a bit too bland for my taste.  I recomend adding twice the garlic and some pepper.  Was an easy meal but was very messy.

Even with a bumper crop of zucchini this year, and everyone becoming a bit disenchanted with them, this simple recipe was received with delight by my family and friends.

Easy to make, tasty, if not the healthiest use of a vegetable.  You can *definitely* use 2 large or 3 medium zucchini in this recipe as there is plenty of filling.  Adding mozzarella or provolne is an excellent idea.  If I make this again I'd try a dash of worstershire or Tabasco in the mix.

Holy garlic! I didn't pay much attention to the complaints of too much garlic since I love the stuff, but whoah, way too much! This also makes a lot of filling. I stuffed two large zucchinis and had plenty left over. I sprinkled some italian seasoning onto the zucchini before adding the filling, but the garlic overpowered it anyway. I'll definitely try it again though, cutting the garlic down.

Enjoyed by everyone of us.  Even my 7 year old son who we encourage to try, asked for more.  He is so exited that he can now brag that he likes another green vegetable!  

There is plenty of topping for at least 1 large and one small zucchini.  I think next time I might try topped with some bread crumbs also.

IT'S GREAT THIS WAY,  OR ADD ANYTHING IN IT THAT YOUR FAMILY LIKES JUST BEFORE BAKING.  SUCH AS VERY THICK CHILI MIX OR TACO SEASONED MEAT.  GOOD STUFF !!!

This came out pretty well. This made enough fillings for six zucchini. I think 15 minutes precooking the zucchini was a little long. Next time I think I'll cook it only 10 as it was rather soft.

This was OK, though I would cut the filling by about half. It is something different for veggies and I have a husband who is eating low carb, so I will probably make this occasionally when we need something different, but I wouldn't call it a favorite.

Well, there were a couple of things I did not like about this recipe.  When I tried to scoop out the seeds, most of zucchini came out with it.  I don't know if I boiled it too long, but I boiled it for about 10 minutes.  Also the filling had way too much garlic in it for me, and I LOVE garlic.  Also it was way too much filling, you really only need about half of what it calls for.  Although without so much garlic, I think the filling would be really good with something like townhouse crackers as an h'orderves, or a snack.  I don't think I'll be making this recipe again, but I might make the filling for other uses.

Great recipe. I was out of sour cream so I substituted ricotta cheese with a squeeze of lemon. I also took someone's suggestion and added a dash of worcestershire. It turned out fantastic. I'd like to mention this recipe is low carb as well for those of us watching the carb intake. Thanks for sharing, Joe.

This was a awesome recipe.  Excellent use of Zucchini. Very easy to make.  It did make a lot of filling...Used 1 large zucchini and 2 small/med ones and it filled them nicely.  Even my 4year old loved it....he took the filling that was on his plate and dipped his chicken in it!  My husband didn't care for it too much.  My daughter and I loved it and were fighting for the last one!  Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe Joe.

When I made this, I did not have any Parmesan on hand, so instead I shredded some Provolone...Do not try this at home! It was just too bland without the Parmesan. Next time I think I will make it without the sour cream, and I will definitely add Parmesan.

Yum. These were a big hit at my house. My non veggie eating husband couldn't eat enough. The recipe makes a ton of filling. I actually used the amount to fill 4 medium zucchini. I used the reduced fat cream cheese and light sour cream and no one seemed to notice.

I'll state straight out: I don't like zucchini.  But with sour cream, cream cheese, and parmesan, what wouldn't taste delicious?  I also stuffed some mushrooms, baked them with the zukes, and they were very tasty as well.  Didn't change the recipe and will make it again when a stray zucchini wanders into my kitchen.

Excellent dish! I only boiled the zucchini for about 8-10 minutes and added the seeds to the cream cheese mixture.  I added extra parmesan cheese, added some Italian seasoning, baked it with mozzarella cheese on top. Wonderful dish!

I love this recipe and my family loved it also when I made it for them. But it took longer than 10 minutes to cook the zucchini.

Made as recipe stated it was lacking seasoning. Next time I will add salt and pepper to the cheese mixture and a little less garlic.

Made no changes to the recipe at all and it was a hit! Fed a family of four and they all loved it! One suggested we add bacon bits next go round, so I may try that to give it an extra kick! Overall easy to make and follow the recipe. My new low carb fav!!

Well, I did something a little different and my husband who never eats zucchini loved it. I took some Olive Garden signature dressing and soaked the sliced zucchini for 24 hours. Then, I scooped out a trench and placed the mixture described, but omitted the garlic. I figured the Olive Garden dressing had lots of flavor so it was not needed. I did not boil the zucchini in advance. Instead, I stuffed it and baked it for 30 minutes. The zucchini was crisp and the filling was delicious. I think baking it in the marinade of Italian dressing was a plus too. It was easy and simply delicious. Thank you for the basic idea of stuffing with cheeses and sour cream. The paprika gave it a nice color too. Oh, I added a little cheddar cheese to the mix too. Very yummy.

Tried this tonight.  I halved the filling for one medium zucchini, and had some left over.  I also added a bit of shredded Romano cheese and topped it all off with some Zesty Breadcrumbs.  It was delicious!!!!  Might make this as a side for Thanksgiving instead of my usual creamed corn.

I made this today before work and it was really easy.  I didn't even bother boiling the zucchini beforehand, I just scooped out the seeds and filled them with the filling.  It takes a little longer for it to cook, about 20 more minutes, but I hate dirtying pots for no reason!  I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of the parm b/c I was out of it.  The only thing I reccommend is not to reheat too long in the mircowave like I did... the filling melted out after 2min on high :/  Still good though!

This was a very quick and delicious recipe!  My husband and I both loved it, and it helped to use up some of our zucchini!  We are cheese lovers, so of course we topped it with some shredded cheese.

Too much garlic, and I just didn't really like all the filling.  Would have given this two stars, but my fiancee liked them.
