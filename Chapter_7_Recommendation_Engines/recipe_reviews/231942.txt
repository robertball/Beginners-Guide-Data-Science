I did not use the cream to reduce calories. I cooked the beans in chicken broth for 50 minues then added the sliced, sauted bacon with, 1/2 chopped red onion sauted in bacon grease, 6-8 chopped baby carrots, 3 stalks chopped celery and 2 tsp garlic finely diced,1 t  Thyme & 1/2 t Marjoram.  Another 25 minues until beans & veggies well done.  Served with assorted crackers and fresh peeled, sliced tomatoes.  My son ate three bowls!

My daughter is a very picky eater.  I made this dish with a side of cornbread and cut up some smoked ham and put into the pot.  When we were finishing up eating I noticed that she was using her finger to get out off of the good stuff from her bowl.  Yep, I think I will have to make this again, and again, and again, . . .

I have never heard of butter beans before and i am very sad i have missed out on this for years. I made this and I must say this is one of the best and easiest things I have ever made. I have  made this many times and it's always one of the best comfort foods you can have . really hits the spot

I cooked beans in chicken broth and used less butter and whipped cream. Had some left over spiral ham I diced up. Delicious! There was none left! Must make more!
