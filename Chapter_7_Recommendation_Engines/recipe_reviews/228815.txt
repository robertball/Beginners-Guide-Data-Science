This is super quick to make.  Whole thing from start to finish took about 30 minutes.  If you are using instant lemon pudding, it does not take an hour to set-it really only takes about 10 minutes.  This ends up being a very light tasting dessert.  It is not overly lemony, so if you are looking for a strong lemon taste I would use a lemon pie filling layer instead of pudding.  I often use cool whip instead of whipped cream, but did not this time and I think it takes the receipe up a notch.  The other thing I would try next time is whipping in a package of cream cheese into the pudding.

Very good!  The lemon pudding gives this a very light lemony flavor that makes this such a light dessert.  It was enjoyed by everyone.

At first people were afraid to eat what they saw as "food art"!  Once I helped myself to the deliciousness, my guests couldn't get enough.  Made this twice now, and you should definitely add cream cheese to the pudding mixture - it's way better that way.  I also added lemon curd for a bit more zip.  I baked my own shortcake the first time, but I actually preferred the angel food cake I bought from the bakery for the second time.  This is just a fantastic and versatile recipe - my brother thinks it tastes like skittles (in the best way).

This was really delicious, a big hit at a summer gathering.  Quick and easy.  I modified:  used one lemon pudding and one vanilla pudding.  I added 8oz cream cheese to the pudding blend.  Will definitely be making again!

This trifle was a huge hit for our Easter dinner. Everyone raved about it. As a garnish I added some lemon zest to the top with some fresh blueberries and a fresh strawberry. It was super easy to make as well. My pudding (using instant) did not need a full hour to set. I was requested to make it again sometime.

I am making it now, but wondering if it can be done a day in advance? I have the pudding chilling in the fridge. Wonder if I should do the rest of the prep tomorrow? Of finish it up now.

I made this with pound cake instead of angel food because that's what I had in my pantry and everyone loved it. The lemon flavor was not overpowering which was nice. I will def make this again and you can use any fruit you prefer I might try raspberries next time.

I used lemon pie filling and folded in whipped cream and deleted the milk. It was a big hit.

I made some changes- - mixed  berries with some créme de cassis and put them on top of cake layer so that juice would sink into cake. Added pudding as in recipe, then cake again. No whipped cream--seemed like overkill and too much for my trifle bowl. Then I repeated the layers and topped with whipped cream--probably half the recipe amount would be enough. I topped with a twisted thin slice of lemon. I could have adorned with more berries or drizzles of créme de cassis. I included raspberries--framboise would have been good too!  To me, trifle needs liqueur or sherry to moisten the cake.

Made this for Mother’s Day. My family loved it. I used 2 cups of strawberries and then a pint of raspberries, blackberries, and blue berries. Wonderfully light, was hard to keep everyone from going back for thirds!

Have made this twice now, the family loves it.  The first time  I followed the recipe  and used orange segments, blackberries and sliced kiwi.  It was delicious!  The second time I  used  cooked lemon pudding/pie filling (two small packs).  I used canned orange segments, pineapple tidbits and fresh blackberries.  Again delicious.  The instant pudding has a creamier texture, the cooked pudding seemed to have a more pronounced lemon flavor.    This recipe can be adjusted to use whatever fruits are in season.

So easy and beautiful, too! I didn't change a thing. If you are using instant pudding it only takes about 10 mins. to set. I garnish with lemons and the fruit. Excellent!

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I had a difficult time making the whipped topping. But I think I lack a good mixer to make the topping plus my lack of experience with making whipped topping. So I will be using cool whip next time. Otherwise in

This was great. The only change I made was to use pound cake (frozen) instead of angel food cake. I was taking it to a friend's for dinner where there would only be 4 of us, so I cut the recipe in half and it still served all 4 of us and I brought about half of it home for us to have later  :)

This was a big hit at our Fourth of July meal. It is so creamy with the whipping cream and lemon pudding mix. Great flavors throughout. I had several requests for a copy of the recipe. The only substitution I made was to use a regular cream cake rather than an angel food cake. Think it would turn out great either way, just had the other on hand. :)

I took this to share at a New Years Eve celebration and it was a huge hit!  I couldn't find instant pudding, so used the regular cook & cool and it was fine.  I also added raspberries, along with the strawberries and blueberries.  This trifle was a huge hit and I've been asked to bring it to another party coming up.
