This was really good. I cooked the asparagus separately for about 10 minutes with some organic butter and minced garlic. Once the asparagus was done I cooked the scallops in the same pan with a little more butter. They came out perfectly. I used a baby spinach and arugula blend and it was great!

There is a lot to be said for great food, prepared simply.  This is an  uncomplicated recipe.  It relies solely upon the quality of the oil and vinegar, and the freshness of the scallops and the veggies.  I can pronounce every ingredient, and appreciate every one of them.  We did not require all of the vinaigrette, but other than using less of it, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the idea!

This dish is fantastic. I was a little nervous since this was my first time cooking scallops, however I followed the recipe exactly and it far exceeded my expectations! My husband actually told me it was one of the best things I've ever cooked for him, and was raving about it all evening! This recipe is simple and delicious as is, yet leaves room for experimentation if desired. Love it and will be making again and again!!! Thanks for posting!

Very unique idea but tasty and a nice change.  I added some mushrooms in with the spinach and cooked the asparagus a bit  before adding the scallops.
