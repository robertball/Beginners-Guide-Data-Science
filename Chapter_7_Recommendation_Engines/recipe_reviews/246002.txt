I made these into muffins, and used chia seed instead of flax seed because that's what I had on hand. I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and one of stevia powder, and 2/3 cup of blueberries. Great muffins! Lots of protein, and perfect for my reactive hypoglycemia diet as well as my daughter's gluten free diet. It's a keeper.

Ok, made it a second time!  This time I followed the recipe exactly, except i was short 1/4 cup almond flour so substituted coconut flour and I only had 3 eggs on hand so used a tad extra almond milk. And I shaped it as a loaf this time, again,  it was great! I might add some rosemary next time? With the olive oil that might be nice.

This recipe is excellent. My family says it tastes akin to cornbread, but it doesn't fall apart like cornbread does. Works great as sandwich bread, and I've been making it every week or so for specifically that purpose, or just as a snack with cream cheese. Very filling and a great low-carb option that still has some fiber! One of the few recipes I was able to find that didn't involve beating egg whites, which when I first made this I did not have access to a beater. 

This may be obvious (though it wasn't to me) that the default 8 servings will not nearly be enough to fill a bread pan, or at least my bread pan. Had to go with the 16 servings option at the top there. 

I have been using psyllium husk to add fiber to other breads, but have not tried it with this recipe. For a more fiber rich alternative, some or all of the flaxseed meal could probably be substituted for psyllium husk if you've got it!

Try adding more liquid (olive oil and milk) if your bread ends up really dense and hard to chew. I added an extra 1/4 cup of each and the batch turned really fluffy and delicious. My girlfriend will finally eat it!

I made this exactly as shown.  It was a very dry dough and I figured more liquid should be added, but went ahead with it. The top was crumbly, but I allowed it to cool 10 minutes as stated. When I dumped it out...it completely fell apart...crumbly.  However I did taste it and it does taste like a thick hardy bread. I will try this again, and add more almond milk

Fantastic Gluten Free No Carb Bread!
I made this bread exactly as described in the recipe except I used almond meal (basically ground almonds) instead of almond flour which doesn't have the almond skins.  It really turned out great, better than I expected! I am not sure why another baker found the recipe too dry because I was worried that it was too wet. The picture also shows a square shaped bread but I used a loaf pan as in the recipe. The result was very "bread-like." Good sliced and toasted with butter and jam, good with peanut butter, or cream cheese and smoked salmon. I had several non gluten free friends and my husband try it and they all liked it too. Thank you so much!

I made this exactly as instructed and was pleasantly surprised how moist & delicious it came out.  The dough is more like a batter when it was all mixed & used parchment paper in the loaf pan for easier extraction. The loaf took 30 minutes in my oven, it was golden brown & a knife inserted came out clean.  I will make this again & again.  I plan on trying to sweeten it a tad since I want to have this with my morning tea.  Thanks to the original poster!

The recipe was easy to make. The bread looked amazing once I took it out of the oven. But Looorrrddddddd, I can't eat this . This has the worse taste I've ever put into my mouth. I tried to put peanut butter on it and fruit to make it taste better and it didn't help at all. Seriously, please.... find another recipe! Don't waste your money buying the ingredients to make this. The pictures look great, but it taste like butt.

I cut this recipe in half because you never know how these things will turn out when you're the first one :)  Since I cut it in half, I made three mini loaves and cooked them about 25 minutes. Moist for almond bread and perfect for a low carb way of eating.

It is very fluffy and tastes close to a whole wheat bread, I would give 5 star but, unfortunately mine ended up getting stuck to the bottom of the pan, I definitely cooked it enough and greased the pan ( did the toothpick test and all ) but still it stuck, so there is a small hole in the bread on the bottom, so next time I will use parchment paper as well.
Edit: The reason mine is fluffy is because I beat the eggs until frothy before adding everything else, also as others have said you should double the recipe, even with me beating the eggs the loaf was still small.

This bread is WONDERFUL! I had just about given up finding an almond flour recipe I liked. After trying 5 others, I decided to try one more. I am SO glad I found this one. I was so anxious to make it but I didn't have flax meal, searched and found out 1/3 cup applesauce can be used as a substitute for the flax meal. This bread is delicious! It doesn't rise high, but that's ok, I'll just double the recipe and adjust the cooking time, good old knife test works great to see if it's done. I can't thank you enough for this recipe. I have real problems with grains of any kind, but especially wheat, had to stop eating that a long time ago. Seeing the high prices of grain free products, I decided to start finding recipes. This one is a life saver. I miss having sandwiches on real bread, and this is like having real bread. This one does NOT taste eggy like some of the ones I've tried that asked for 5 to 6  or more eggs. Let it completely cool before cutting, then it doesn't crumble. Had to try a piece while hot and I put some bacon grease on it, a touch of salt, and OMG, it was heaven! Thank you, thank you, thank you again for this.

I made this exactly as written as I had never used almond flour before and it turned out pretty good (true rating 3.5 stars) As it was baking, it smelled very eggy, like a breakfast casserole. Now, I like breakfast casserole but not as bread. To my surprise, the taste is quite neutral. Does not rise and has the consistency of banana or zucchini bread. Being neutral in flavor it would be very easy to add spices for a savory bread or fruit and nuts for a sweeter version. So I like the potential to use it as a base and add to it which I will do,

This bread is delicious!  Firm texture slices as thin as you like.  Parchment paper does make it easier to get out of the pan.  Done it with and without.  Try with cheese or peanut butter on top. I recommend tightly wrapping in plastic wrap after completely cooled.

Simple and delicious. Very similar to cornbread but fills that high carb void for those who miss bread. I followed the recipe exactly except I beat my eggs before adding them.

This is ok, just not what I was hoping for. It's too eggy and that makes the crust tastes like scorched eggs. If I cut the crust off it's better, This does NOT toast well, when toasted it just tasted like burnt eggs.

Great! Loved the crisp crust and the extremely moist and light, yet dense texture of the bread. I doubled the recipe, and used half eggs, half flax eggs; half coconut, half olive oil; and subbed ground, sprouted buckwheat groats for just under 1/3rd of the almond meal (which I ground, not-so-fine, myself) instead of almond flour. Because I used so much more flax, I had to cook it for an extra 10 mins, as it was still very wet inside. I let it rest for 15 or minutes in the pan, and when took it out and I knocked on the bottom, it sounded deep and hollow. Ready! Next time, I'll use half the oil and will try using all flax egg, to make it vegan. (Because this was SUPER moist with the extra flax, I'm guessing I'll be able to reduce the egg by 1/4 and oil by half, so only 6 flax eggs and 1/8c coconut oil for a double recipe.)

Loved it! I do not cook, bake, etc. Very uncomfortable in the kitchen ... but I just got a new house (and kitchen) and thought I would give it a try. I was looking for a wheat-free recipe and this one fit the bill. I followed the directions exactly.  It easily came out of the pan. Next time, I will double it -- as suggested by some others -- but this smaller size was perfect to discover the taste of the bread. Thank you for giving me some confidence in the kitchen.

It is the most delicious recipe I've ever tasted. My husband was forced to cut down on carbs or take insulin. I found myself glued to the internet.  My husband is a bread fanatic. 

Well he's always asking me to make him your recipe. He loves it!

I added solid veggie oil, added 1 egg white beaten to just before it gets hard, and top with dried onions, poppy & sesame seeds! 

Making twice as much. Not sure about cooking time. But I'll let you know.

Thank you!

This is really good bread. It's hard to believe that it doesn't have any flour in it. I added a tiny bit more oil to it and that made it extra moist. I also doubled the recipe to make a bigger loaf. I definitely will be making this again.

Better than most almond bread recipes online: it seems that so many people do not know that bread is not cake, so they add butter and other useless things. This recipe with olive oil is a lot better if you really want to make bread.

I will definitely make this bread again - but I prefer coconut flour over flax seed, based on past experiences.  
For a holiday twist, I added the following organic ingredients:  coconut oil, stevia, cinnamon, raisins, pastured butter, and light agave syrup.  It turns the bread a beautiful brown, and definitely  gives it a sweet bread quality!!  
I love the straightforward layout of the ingredients provided.  I didn't even have to knead it - just used a tablespoon.  
I look forward to making it just as it's laid out!!

Mine came out nice and moist. I did use paleo baking powder, which is a mixture of baking soda, cream of tartar, and tapioca starch. It does create more of a batter than a rough but it bakes up nice.

I made this exactly as written. Very easy... cooked for just 30 minutes. It's a little dry but the flavor is good. Had it with almond butter and some paleo raspberry blueberry jam. Delicious!

Loved it. I agree that it's a batter, not a dough. The only replacement I made was that I used un-sweet coconut milk in place of almond milk. Very easy to make and turned out great.

I doubled the recipe but used 6 jumbo eggs. I also used a half cup of Half and Half cream in place of almond milk, and I added a tablespoon of honey. It was moist and delicious. Next time I may try poppyseeds in place of flaxseeds

I made this, I added garlic powder and used the coconut milk I had available. The taste and texture is similar to cornmeal made cornbread (not Jiffy mix). I've been wheat product free for almost a month and missing bread really bad.  This worked as as a substitute and I will be making this from now on.

I have made it twice in two days. It looks like and feels like real bread. It is a little eggy, even though I reduced the  eggs to 3 instead of 4. However, I love that I can now incorporate bread in to my low carb diet.

Love it! So tasty. Definitely recommend adding the teaspoon of cinnamon. I didnt have flaxseed meal, someone has suggested using a 1/3 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and that was great.

Next time I will double up so it rises a little more. My first time making this and I'm generally new to bread. SUPER filling.

I've made this as is a number of times with great success. Works great sliced/toasted with some eggs for a huge protein boost in the mornings. The recipe also takes add-ins very well.  I've made a sweet version with cinnamon and some honey and a spicy version with chopped jalapeño and cheddar cheese.

This is the first time I've made bread with almond flour. I really like the consistency of the flour. The bread came out pretty good. I baked it in demi loaves in my air fryer. Saved this recipe as I will be making is again.

I doubled the recipe and still wasn't quite tall enough to make a full slice of regular bread. I did add a tbsp. of each spice, onion powder and garlic powder for a more savory taste. I hope it freezes well... will get back to you on that.

My first try at an almond flour based bread.  It tasted pretty good, similar to a semi dry corn cake with less flavor.  I will make again with advice from others to sweeten. I made cup cake sized muffins...8.   Each had an estimated  210 calories and 2.875 carbs.  Seems high for such a small portion.  For the love of God someone come up with something I can eat more than one of.

This is a good, basic recipe for almond bread.  I'm gluten-free, and this satisfies my desire for a slice of bread now and then. Nice, dense texture, and good taste.

I made this bread and it was amazing. The recipe is simple and the ingredients are commonly found in my kitchen. I used this bread to accompany a homemade chicken soup. It was firm. I didn’t have a loaf pan so I used I flat pan for baking cookies. The bread was flat and it needed less time in the oven and it was fun. You just had to break the bread with your hands. There are however some aspects to take into consideration for next time after following the recipe step by step and without any changes in the ingredients used: 1) it was a little too salty for my taste so I will use less salt next time. 2) it was too eggy for my taste. I will see what I can do differently next time. May be adding three eggs instead of four? 3) I want to try some herbs and spices. I think it will go very well with italian spices. Mmm some oregano or basil.

So, I'm the worst cook in this hemisphere (they haven't tasted my cooking in Asia yet). Followed this recipe, except I added two teaspoons of Stevia. It turned out perfect. Kind of a cornbread texture, maybe a bit of an acquired taste, but a great alternative to wheat based bread.

It was more like runny cake batter than dough. Because it was the first time making it I was super careful to follow directions and measurements exactly! Needless to say it does not look anything like the picture of the poster! I am not sure how you are supposed to make a sandwich out of something that’s barely 2” high. It definitely will not go in the toaster ! When I read the other positive results I wonder if the size of eggs have anything to do with the flop?

It tastes amazing plain. It tastes a lot like corn bread if served with butter and honey. :)

I made this bread yesterday and followed the recipe exactly except that I thoroughly beat the eggs before adding them, I used a brand new can of baking powder as I heard that it loses potency fast, light olive oil and natural almond flour (it's darker in color.) I could barely wait until it had cooled down before trying it and I was in bread heaven! It's light, moist, and the texture is somewhat like a whole grain bread. Sorry, no photo because it didn't last past breakfast this morning.

I took away a star for texture and a star for blandness, however it was very moist. Needs more flavor. I will make it again and make some changes.

It’s a good bread. No issues with dryness, it’s a moist bread. I will make a double batch for taller bread. I have to make my own baking powder so I don’t know if that’s why it doesn’t rise or if it’s the nature of the ingredients. Will continue to make (have made 3 batches so far).

I made it following the instructions to the letter and it was great!  you can toast it with butter - if you have any leftovers that is :)

Definitely a keeper.

I only made this almond bread once and I am so pleased.
I did substitute the olive oil for 3T of mayo and I added 1T sugar substitute so it wouldn't be bland. It came out beautiful, moist and really tasty. 
I will definitely make it again?

I used the exact ingredients listed and this loaf turned out very well.  As long as you keep your expectations realistic it tastes fine and makes good toast. I made one adaptation to the instructions: I beat the eggs in my stand mixer until they were pretty fluffy.  Then I added the rest of the wet ingredients, mixed again, then folded in the dry ingredients.  I think this made the loaf a nice texture.  I baked 2 small loaves for 30 minutes; the result was beautiful.  Leftovers went in the fridge and are holding up well 2 days later.  I'll be sharing this recipe with my low carb eating friends!

I made this twice and eliminated the Stevia the second time around.  An odd taste developed while chewing it.  The consistency was good like a very moist light bread.  Not too dense.  I will continue looking for another recipe to cook with less egg.  The technique of whipping the whites was cool to work with.  Could be a keeper with other egg based meals.

Fantastic recipe, as is. Note: You cannot rate any grain-free recipe as compared to a loaf of yeast bread. They are entirely different (I imagine that is the source of dissatisfaction behind some of the less-than-great reviews).
That said, this came out of the oven and was slathered in Kerigold butter - very yummy!  Dark with a mild, nutty flavor (not “eggy” like others I’ve tried), with a fairly dense-but-moist texture.
Once cooled, made a perfect base for an open-face tuna sandwich. Thin slices hold up, but flavorful enough for thick.

I made this exactly to this recipe, and it turned out great. I love the simplicity and healthy ingredients.  But the reviewers who suggested lining the baking pan with parchment paper were right. I used baking spray and the bottom stuck.  I will make this again!

We did 6 drops of stevia, we took the eggs and separated them and fluffed the whites just added the yolks to the mix, and then added the fluff to the mix last, and instead of 1/4 of almond milk we did a half a cup..looked runny at first but turned out amazing!!!

I followed the recipe exactly. It wasn’t dry, it didn’t crumble and it was pretty darn good! If you don’t stir or sift your ingredients you may over measure. It’s low carb which is what I was looking for. It’s not like bread from traditional flour so if that’s what you’re expecting you’ll be disappointed. But if you’re open minded you’ll be pleasantly surprised! Making this for Christmas with some variations in a couple loaves. Thanks for a great recipe.

I doubled the recipe and substituted hemp milk .  But batter was very liquidy so I added an extra cup of  Almond flour. I might not double the eggs next time.  I also baked this in a 18 mini loave pan for about 12 minutes.  This is a great high protein buscuit ~ 4.8 gm PR/oz.   Great tasting bucuits.

I love this bread! 
I did add about 1/3 cup of stevia. It certainly isn't bread like I would use for a sandwich but it's very nice to have a slice with a little natural sugar free strawberry jam.
Will definitely make again.

Thank you so much for this recipe. This bread is better than any gluten free bread I've ever tried, the consistency amazes me, it feels and looks like real bread, slices and toasts really well plus it's super healthy. The only reason I took off a star is because your measurement's weren't enough to fill my loaf pan and I grabbed the smallest loaf pan I could find. I would literally have to add 2 x more ingredients next time, and almond flour is not cheap around here, but am willing to make it again and invest in more almond flour because this is such good bread and healthy!

Fabulous.  I had some almond flour and flax seed meal around so decided to make this though I have no problem with gluten. It is delicious.  It has a subtle delicious flavor of almonds and you can vaguely feel the almond meal in your mouth. So nice and complex.

So...made the first loaf last night and it's gone.  Today I tried the same recipe but substituted coconut oil for the olive oil and threw in some maple syrup.  Equally delicious as the first loaf but slightly sweet. You can, of course, play with the amount of maple syrup. I can think of many variations! A bit of jalapeño might work very nicely. And on and on. 

Overall, a fabulous recipe with lots of potential for variety.  Thank you!!!

Thank goodness for the review saying dough is more like batter.  I added 1/4  c. extra almond milk. Also added 1 T chia seeds, 1 T flax seeds,  a sprinkle of onion powder and 1 T Italian herbs for a savory taste. Turned out great! Good consistency.

I made it. Was a little dry. I just started using almond and coconut flour and finding it it dryer and need more liquid than regular flour. I did add some blueberries in it, which added a little moisture and taste.

Great recipe. I made it exactly by the recipe. Except doubling salt (sea salt) by accident. I  really liked how it turned. Since on I will be using  double amount of sea salt. Also, I will double amount of the batch to make the loaf more full. I sprinkled some coriander seeds on the top before baking.

Its low carb. Bread doesn't taste good low carb.  But, it helped with my bread craving.  I toasted it and buttered and used natural peanut butter for a delicious treat.

I added about 3 T. almond milk and 1 T. of honey so the batter would thin a little, which worked well.  I made the recipe for 12 servings, and that produced 3 nice 3 x 5 loaves.

I  mixed it as noted but the batter seemed thin so I added 1/8 cup more of almond flour. It didn't dough ball up, still looked like pancake batter.  I sprayed the pan with coconut oil. I cooked it per recipe and it came out a nice light brown. It was denser than I imagined (not surprised since I added additional flour). The texture was good but was flat tasting.Put some butter and preserves on it to add flavor . I think next time I will add some honey to the batter and not add more flour.

I'm very impressed,  it turned out great.  I beat the eggs until foamy and light yellow and then added the rest of the ingredients ,  that helped it to be more tender (I was afraid it was gonna be too dense). I also decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp after reading the reviews, great advise. The batter was pretty wet, just like a quick bread batter.

Love this recipe and make it at least weekly. I substituted ghee for the olive oil and slightly increased the baking powder and it makes for a great sandwich bread or sometimes we even warm it up and add some raw honey for a quick sweet snack. I only wish it was a little lighter as mine tends to be a bit of a heavier bread.

Did come out tasting rather good. my loaf pan ended up being too big for the amount the 8 servings made. I will definitely try and make the 16 servings one. I suggest using parchment paper instead of oil, my loaf got stuck in one section and ended up in several pieces. Def try it out, tastes good.

This was my first time making anything with almond flour.  It turned out really well and is quite tasty. My husband likes it too. We made French Toast with it this morning and it was great!

I made this bread twice. The first time I used half n half instead of almond milk, since that was the only milk I had. The second time i used 2% milk. I couldn't tell a difference between the two. Also, it only needed 30 minutes to bake.

I made this exactly as written.  The instructions called the mixing results "dough".  I would call it "batter" .  I cooked it exactly as directed .. to the minute.  It was perfectly formed and done throughout.  It is a dense, moist bread which does not crumble when sliced.  It is high calorie and cholesterol but MY concern was the carb count.  I am diabetic.  This bread doesn't have much of a taste so I topped my slice with butter and just a tiny schmear of honey.  Delightful.  I will make it again.

Made it exactly as written and baked it with parchment so it would come out clean- which it did.  Did not crumble.   I tried a piece dry so I could get  the flavors and it actually tasted too salty for me..  I think  I'll try it as muffins next time and add some blueberries or cranberries.  I will make it again and reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon

I made exactly as shown, but took it off the oven in about 30min because I was afraid of my crazy oven, it was not totally done, so I sliced it and put it back in the oven. Turned out great toasts! Love it!

Trying to go low carb and thought I would try something different. I made this recipe exactly as the recipe states, using parchment paper in the loaf pan. I just had a warm slice and think it is delicious. It would serve as a great base for other types of bread, adding thyme, rosemary, garlic....or even adding blueberries or cranberries to change it up.  I will definitely be making this again.

I still find this recipe a little dry. I used soy milk instead of almond milk, a little more than the suggested amount, and I slightly beat the egg. Great result.

I just started a Kato diet and this bread is going to make it so easy! Like others it didn't fill the  pan but I'm going to play around with it. I don't really want to double the recipe because I want to make it much more net carbs. I'll try increasing the baking powder and then play around with the flour and eggs. But an awesome base! I already made a mini pizza with some and a grilled cheese sandwich! I think tomorrow I do raspberry muffins with the dough for breakfast!

Being new to Gluten Free, the new eating challenges are interesting.  I also strive for a Keto diet without red meats.  Anyway, this bread was sooo easy to make and sooo delicious.  I substitute MCT oil for the olive oil, since olive oil breaks down above 100 degrees.  Also, I use a small loaf pan rather than the standard size.  It comes out perfect in 45 minutes.  In the morning I toast a slice in my toaster oven and then lay on the coconut oil... or butter.  Yum!

I used lemon flavored olive oil, and added a little gluten free all purpose flour. It was the best gf bread I've made so far, and actually gets better as the week goes on. It toasts fine, and makes a great snack with cream chese and a little jam or honey maybe.  Thanks for this super recipe!

Made a couple different ways.  One according to the recipe. It is a nice rustic bread. Second was to switch out the olive oil for coconut oil, add spices measured from a pumpkin pie recipe,  and added baking Truvia white and brown sugar.  Very tasty spice bread.

This is my first time baking with almond flour and did not expect a great result! I used a toaster oven.
I didn't have flaxseed meal, so used another half-cup of almond flour. Because I like fiber, I threw in 1/2 cup wheat bran and 1/5 cup of wheat germ. (for those doing low-carb, this might be problematic)
When I tried to remove it from the pan it tore some bottom crust off; it seemed a little soggy - so I gave it another 10 mins in oven, upside down.
And it slices perfectly, not at all crumbly, and tastes great.

I didn't have any flax seeds or chia seeds, but I did have raw pumpkin seeds, which I turned in to 'meal' with my smoothie blender.  It is delicious!  Hot out of the oven with some ghee.  I'm in paleo heaven!

This is a terrific recipe.  Only change I made was to replace half of the olive oil with melted butter. Very moist and my family enjoyed the taste.  Would also be ideal as previously stated, if it were a muffin with whatever you wanted to add to it, and a bit of stevia.

Did not taste very good. Thought it would be  the size of normal bread so I could toast it
