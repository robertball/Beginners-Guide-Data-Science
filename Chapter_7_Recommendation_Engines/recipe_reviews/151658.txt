Flavor was good but too many ingredients on top of stuffing mix that the egg mixture didn't make it all the way through. Bottom was dry and ended up very dark but not quite burnt. It was a great way to use leftover ham but the recipe needs some work.

Good recipe. But it definitely needs more tweaking. This recipe could be adapted many ways. I think I would make a breakfast strata. Make sure you use a shallow dish. I used a deeper one and it had to cook for 1 1/2 hours. definitely not worth it. It was plenty moist. Skip the mustard too. It was not great in it.

Great idea...though I had to use what I had on hand, which meant a couple substitutions:2c. shredded jalopeno pita plus 1 box cornbread stuffing, sharp cheddar instead of swiss, cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of asparagus. Left out the mustard cuz the bf can't stand it. Was a hit!

Made this for dinner last night as I was looking for something that had ham, aspapragus and eggs.  Luckily, I also had a bag of stuffing in my cupboard.  Had to use shredded cheddar cheese and cream of celery soup in place of the swiss and cream of asparagus.  I added some onion powder and I also added a packet of bernaise sauce mix due to some of the reviews saying it was little bland.  Family liked it.  Texture a little like bread pudding.  May make again with other combination of ingredients.

This is a super good, tasty dish. I omitted the ham (cause i didnt have any) and it was good. Used stove top stuffing (lower sodium). But above all it is an EASY recipe for a busy mom!

My family LOVED this recipe!  It was a cinch to make and tasted delicious.  We are already thinking of ways to change it up in the future - maybe adding mushrooms!  :) Very good.

This was pretty good...bacon might be good in this.  Be sure to choose either unflavored cubed stuffing or maybe an herb flavored stuffing.

This was really good!  Everyone in the family liked even with my substitutions.   It would probably have been even better if I had the ingredients on hand.  What I did: cooked fresh asparagus, used Kirkland (costco) deli style ham cut up, cream of mushroom instead of cream of asparagus and pre-shredded mexican style (4 cheese blend) cheese instead of swiss.   I also added quite a bit of pepper for a little seasoning.   I might try it again with a mix of the mexican style cheese and swiss.

I was not fond of the combination of flavors plus needed more spices.

Great way to use Easter leftover ham and fresh spring asparagus.  I did add onion and even put 
French's onions on top for a crust.  A hit.

I used an equivalent weight of jumbo croutons for the stuffing mix.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I think next time I will use either Cream of Onion or Cream of Potato soup.  I didn't like the greenish tint that the Cream of Asparagus soup gave to the strata.  Otherwise, it was delicious and was well accepted by my guests.  Thank you Campbell's Kitchen.

Really good quiche, easy to make. We ate the entire quiche for brunch on Mother's Day. Even the non-asparagus eaters liked it.
