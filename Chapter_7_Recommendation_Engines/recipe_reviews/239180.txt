The fresh lemon juice really shines in this recipe.   Followed the instructions to the letter, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks, koko, for a new potato dish.

Just like the potatoes at my favourite restaurant. Don't change anything.  if you omit the lemons and oregano, like some suggested, then your not making Greek style Lemon potatoes.

I love lemon potatoes from my neighborhood Greek restaurant and this recipe is just about as close as you can get to theirs! I definitely will be making this again!!! (The only thing I did different was use vegetable stock instead of chicken because I'm a vegetarian. Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as it says.)

Made these two nights in a row, grilling them both times; the first with oregano and I overcooked and over browned them. Watch carefully, as the broth evaporates quickly. Also, I found  I wasn't particularly fond of either the lemon or the oregano. Tonight  I tried them again, this time with fresh dill and I kept a closer eye.   Much better, although I still found them too tangy from the lemon juice.  If I was to try them a third time I'd either cut way back on the lemon or eliminate it completely.

Very good! I also added some fresh, finely grated garlic and some rosemary and thyme. Marinated for a couple hours before roasting.

Excellent and very easy! I lined my pan with foil which helps a lot in the cleanup. It's a good thing that I always check because even after adding the broth, the liquid was eventually absorbed or evaporated. So each of the times later when I checked, I added a little water which helped. It would have been awful if the potatoes became stuck to the pan, and they were starting to. Great recipe, koko!

I added a few more teaspoons of Oregano! My boyfriend is Greek and was over my shoulder screaming "it needs more oregano! If its going to be Greek, it needs MORE!" lol and he was right, tasted better with more. Also, I saved 1/2 a lemon for the end and when the dish was almost done, I poured it on top. When lemon cooks, I find it to turn bitter and lose it's 'lemon' taste, so I just added some in the end just to keep the flavor. It turned out great.

I was afraid all that chicken broth would make the potatoes soupy, but it didn't and the lemon and oregano made the dish taste authentic. Very yummy, have made it twice and can tell I'll be making it again and again. Thanks!

These potatoes are a hit at our house!  I only used about a pound of potatoes, so I had to cut the recipe back (for only two of us).  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!  Yummy stuff!  Thanks, koko!

I think these were very tasty.  I did add Cavender's Greek seasoning and cut back on the salt.  With that addition, they were very good.  Served them along side Greek stuffed meatloaf and Greek salad.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made it for supper tonight as we were having souvlaki.  I followed the recipe as written and it was absolutely delicious!  Tastes just like the potatoes at my local Greek place.  Can't wait to make it again.

It's a simple recipe and just like traditional Greek potatoes. I wanted whole potatoes and they worked with the designated time. May I suggest if doing whole potatoes pick a roasting pan that is "tight" to the potatoes. This will keep the moisture in the pan and give you fantastic potatoes. have tried many of these and this is the only great recipe

Magnificent!  Can cook longer in the oven if you have to (coordinating, say, with meats being cooked).  Can't wreck them at all.  Leftovers are great too.

I followed the recipe exactly and don't know how I could improve on this great recipe. I made it last night for a side dish and went right to the fridge today to have it again as a snack. I'm not sure I've ever made a potatoes in a more pleasing way and it is healthy! I'll definitely make it again.

This was delicious.  My only problem was that I lined the pan with foil and I know from past experience that this reduces the evaporation.  Hence the liquid the potatoes were in did not evaporate.  Way too much liquid.  Next time I will do it with 3 lbs. potatoes but only 2 cups of chicken stock.  The flavour was just lovely though and I hope that next time they will be less "white" and hopefully a bit more 'browned'.

This recipe was amazing, all my guests loved it. Turned the oven to broil for the last ten minutes with the lid off to crisp up the edges.

These potatoes are very tasty - quite  similar to the potatoes at our favorite local Greek restaurant.  I had to make a few substitutions ... used Wylers Chicken granules to make the broth (I think it made the potatoes a tiny bit too salty but I was out of Swanson's).  I roasted it for 40  minutes at 400 and then an additional 15 minutes at 450 to use up the liquid.  The Yukon Gold potatoes began to get those beautiful golden brown edges. My husband loved them.

As usual the first time I make something I used the exact recipe.  Tasty and a lovely texture, just like at Greek restaurants.  I think it would have taken much more time to get the full amount of liquid mostly absorbed so I will account for that next time.

Delicious! I used 2 lbs of potatoes but kept all other measurements the same. The broth didn’t all cook off, but the potatoes were cooked perfectly. I used Yukon Gold potatoes.

My family loves these potatoes! I tried with skin on and my husband really liked it, I prefer skinned just for the consistency. My kids are teenagers so, skin on skin off they don’t care, they ate them up!

I used less oil, added fresh garliic, basil, dill, and sometimes add greenbeans and kilbasa or sausage.  Also, I added feta at the end.

This is an amazing recipe, I dated a Greek guy and miss the food and this is the closest I've come to finding potatoes that turn out like his. I'm not an oregano fan so I substitute it with dried mint and basil to get a similar flavor. Recommend this lemon potato

I doubled the recipe but otherwise followed it exactly, baking it in a large disposable aluminum roasting pan. After an hour in the oven, the liquid had not evaporated at all and the potatoes were not fully cooked. Now it's been over an hour and a half, and still the liquid has not evaporated and the potatoes are not fully cooked.  I am hoping they turn out in the end.

I like it, but I would cut the lemon from 2 to 1. I found out tonight that juice from 2 lemons made my potatoes too tangy and acidic.

Pretty tasty but way too salty as is. I used powdered chicken broth and the 2 tsp of salt. Next time I’m going to do a half tsp of salt as the broth is more than enough.

I even messed them up ( I totally forgot the chicken broth) and they were GREAT!! So I am going to remake them again tonight and I'm sure they will be even more amazing. If you like Greek lemon potatoes, this is your recipe.

Loved it!  After a few rounds, I ended up cooking them for  about 1 hour 10 mins because they were not as crispy as we liked at first.  I also added more lemon juice the last time I made them and it was great.  A good, simple, tasty side dish.

Nice delicious potatoes. My cooking time in a gas oven was a bit longer at about 1 hour and 20 minutes to get them to a slight crisp. Served with chicken souvlaki and a Greek salad. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is one of the most savory and enjoyable potato dishes ever!

The lemon was on point, and I later added this to a soup I made, making for one of the best comfort soups ever.

I tweaked the recipe by adding just 1.5 lemons and added fresh rosemary. It came out fine except the broth took too long to evaporate so I took out the potatoes and roasted them on a separate tray. Next time,  I would only use 1/2 a lemon juice and  1-2 cups of broth. OR parboil the potatoes in the broth and then finish them in the oven so it won’t 2 hours to finish.

This recipe is so good! We found out that our stock contained MSG and tried making the potatoes without it, but it just wasn’t the same. We recently found an organic, MSG free stock which is better, but still not the same.

My favorite Greek potato recipe. It is always perfect unless you make the mistake I did once and experiment with unpeeled baby potatoes. They don't absorb the oil and lemon; they just get hard and nasty. If you follow the recipe as written, it's great!

These turned out fantastic! Lemon is my favorite so the only thing I added was 1 extra lemon juices and a little more oregano!

I reduced the amount of chicken stock to 1.5 cups because I wanted the potatoes more roasted than boiled. They were delicious. A definite hit, will make often.

Loved these. So easy, and tasty!  Have made them a couple of times. Reduced the chicken stock liquid a little the second time (about 2.75 cups instead of 3). Also used lime juice in place of lemon.  I prefer lemon.

These potatoes were amazing! Only 2 things I changed. I always scale my recipes down for two servings just to try it out and I left the skin on the potatoes. Didn’t change any ingredients. Thanks for a great recipe.

The secret to this recipe is the ratio of olive oil to lemon to salt. Get it right and it is very yummy, get it wrong and it can be too bland or too bitter. For consistency, I prefer using bottled lemon juice these days, no surprises that way.

This turned out great! I cut down the recipe but I agree with others to ensure you fill with enough liquid to cover the potatoes as the uncovered pieces get a bit dry in the oven! The liquid will evaporate!

So, I didn't weigh them but used about 8 yellow-fleshed potatoes and Realemon (equal to 2 lemon's worth). My broth didn't evaporate, but the potatoes tasted exactly as I'd hoped! I may cut down a little on broth next time.

I made this recipe twice now.
My husband loves it so much!
Tastes just like the restaurants! 
Amazingly easy and that makes me happy as I am not a chef by any means. 
The ingredients are mostly things you already have too! So perfect !

These were great but I did make changes.  I don’t think you need 3 cups of broth as this is too much.  Too begin with, I used all the ingredients plus I used 3 lemons instead of two.  I added a teaspoon of fresh garlic and a tbsp of Greek seasoning.  I marinated the potatoes in the mixture for two hours before I put them in the oven.  I would also watch the potatoes as all ovens are different.  Next time I will bake them for 45-50 minutes only.

We used only one lemon. It must have been really fresh because my family found the potatoes too lemony. I would cut back on the lemon next time and/or maybe add some garlic.

Loved the flavors, definitely have to use fresh lemon juice as opposed to bottled. Also added minced garlic to the mixture. After an hour of cooking, I broiled for an additional 5 minutes after adding some Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of some more fresh lemon juice.

3 cups of broth seemed too much, but I tried it, and it worked great.  The potatoes were highly flavorful.  Next time I'd cut down the lemon juice just a little bit and leave everything else the same.

Followed the recipe, but thought the chicken broth was overpowering and I used a low sodium natural broth from TJ's.  I will try again with a Vegatable broth and butter instead of oil to see if it gives me the results I'm  after.

VERY GOOD  I used foil pan on BBQ . Very fast to put together.
Don't be stingy with broth. It keeps potatoes from sticking .
Soaks in nicely and nice lemony flavour.

I LOVE Greek Potatoes, and this is my absolute favorite recipe.  I like that it has oregano as the only herb...very true to the flavor of the potatoes I get at my favorite Greek restaurant.  Try these...you will be glad you did!

Thanks for this recipe. These potatoes were a total hit at my dinner party! Didn't end up adding the chicken stock because there was already so much liquid and marinated the potatoes for about 3 hours. Will definitely be making these again!

We love Greek and I make it at least once a month.  I found these potatoes too bitter, perhaps it was my lemon.  The only changes that I made was to half the recipe and add garlic.

I made this dish as was instructed with the only exception of using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. It was delicious! It tasted just like the lemon potatoes at the local Greek restaurant... and maybe even tasted better then theirs!

I tossed the potatoes in the oil lemon mixture and let them marinate for a few minutes before putting them in the oven.  To get some browning on them,  I bumped the temp to 450 for an extra 15 minutes at the end.  Very lemony ... just like from a greek restaurant!

it was good but not outstanding (like the ones they serve at my local greek restaurant). 
Still I would make them again adding more condiments and lemon.

So, a friend from work who owns a Greek restaurant gave me this recipe but I didn't write it down. Then, when I want to make them of course she doesn't answer her phone so just going on memory I found this recipe and it is exactly the same. This is absolutely delicious
