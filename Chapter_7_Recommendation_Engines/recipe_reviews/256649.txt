Did the recipe as it was written and it came out lovely.  I left one jar out and put the rest through a 15 boiling bath.  Taste is great and it looks very nice.

I made this recipe to use up several packages of fresh figs that I had frozen.  I adapted it combining a couple of recipes on the Allrecipes site.  The biggest changes I made were to substitute red wine for water and to greatly reduce the amount of honey in the recipe.  My husband and I love the outcome.  It is a warm, buttery jam. It will go on the morning toast, but I think it would make a wonderful filling for a jam spice cake..
I look forward to harvesting more figs in the future so that I can further experiment with this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I used Peter’s Honey figs because that’s what grows in my yard. I had to simmer it for three hours to get jam consistency rather than a sauce consistency, but the finished jam is delicious! I love it for  a grilled chicken sandwich on rustic bread. I top the chicken with  Brie, very thin tart apple slices, and some fig  jam before toasting the sandwich.

Made mine without nuts b/c we have a daughter with a nut allergy and left out the ginger b/c we didn't have any but still delicious! Had to reduce for a bit longer.

Fantastic recipe! Had about 30lbs of Figs off my bush this year, needed to find a good recipe and this one is excellent. My variety is Turkish Brown, and they are a meaty fig.  Didn't have any problems with the preserve being too thin. It cooked, jarred and water bathed very easy. Will use this again and again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe

The taste is wonderful but it's too thin. I actually cooked longer than the recipe called for. I'm going to put in hot jars and process is a hot water bath.  I'll give as gifts as a sauce/salad dressing rather than preserves

The original recipe was very tasty, but I added a couple of handfuls of dried cranberries to the mix as it cooled. Then I put it in jars left in the fridge for a couple of days and everyone loved it

I made this recipe exactly as written and it is fabulous! Reminds me of the flavor of mince meat pie that my dad always made at Christmas.
