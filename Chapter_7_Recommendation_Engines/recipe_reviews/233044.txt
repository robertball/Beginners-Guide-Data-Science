I make these all the time, I just use sugar, no cayenne. After coating with sugar, I lay in a tray and bake at 350F for about 10 mins or so, just to roast them a little so they don't have that raw taste. Really, really yummy.

Yummy! I made these tonight and added a bit of Cheyenne pepper as others suggested.  Be very careful to watch them though. I cooked them what seem like forever and kept stirring and the liquid was not evaporating. I stepped away to get a few things out of the fridge and next thing I know it had all changed over to a solid form. I smelled a few nuts starting to burn so quickly moved the pot off the burner and emptied onto baking pan without any issues. ** just be careful to watch them, I learned my lesson.

Yummy.  I may have over cooked it a bit but is was still good.  I sprinkled cinnamon on it and bake it for 10 mins.

Turned out great. I added 1.5 cup peanuts more without adding more sugar. Baked in oven at 350 for 10 min with cinnamon sprinkled on it.
