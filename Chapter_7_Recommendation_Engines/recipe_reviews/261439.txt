I made no changes to this recipe  and although the texture was very nice and I enjoyed the process, the end result was a coffee cake screaming for flavor like maybe some cinnamon and nutmeg or allspice.
Not enough almond flavor either... of course that is my own issue , as some may like a subtle, simple, clean flavor coffee cake . Will make again and find my happy place with it. Thank you for the recipe. JG
