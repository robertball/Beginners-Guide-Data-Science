Excellent recipe.  I omitted the potatoes and added one small Mexican squash instead.  I only used a half pound of lentils also as there are only five of us to feed.  Thank you for sharing.

Just made this soup.. even though it may sound horrible..it is delicious! I added a small can of tomato sauce in mine , that only added more flavor and hardly ANY Calories.. I did only 1/2 pound of lentils and cut the recipe in half since it is only my husband and myself.. It will be delicious with a piece of cornbread.

Thanks!!!! Made it exactly as written even though I was only feeding three men, myself and my two small children and it was just enough. Everyone had seconds, a few had thirds. Lol. Changing this recipe would be akin to butchering it. It was great!!!

Great recipe! The lentils and cactus go amazingly well together. I omitted the potatoes since I didn't have any and used more cactus than what the recipe called for (since my partner and I really enjoy it). I also didn't have any chicken bouillon handy so I substituted with some Maggie's Seasoning. When boiling the cactus, I added a couple of dry bay leaves and salt to give it more flavor. I added the cactus to the onions then threw in the tomatoes. And to give this soup an extra kick, I sprinkled some ground cayenne pepper along with the cumin! Turned out great, I will be making this again soon!

The group thought it was delicious! We used 2 tbsp tomato paste instead of fresh tomato. We also used pickled cactus which added spiciness to it and we enjoyed the texture of the lentils.

Everything is fine except the addition of the chicken bouillon. it takes from the taste of the lentils. I like to boil the lentils with salt and then add cilantro onion and tomato and that's it. the measurements/time are perfect though.

This soup was delicious.  I used yams instead of white potatoes which gave it some better nutrition, color and a little sweetness.  I would recommend checking the lentils after 20 minutes, they cooked faster than the hour that was suggested.

I would have given this a higher rating, except I used fresh cactus fronds.  I had to look up how to cook them, and they turned out really mucilaginous.  Next time I'll try jarred cactus.  The lentils were really yummy.

When my husband brings home a lot of cactus (nopales), I don't know what to do with the abundance.  How many ways can I prepare and  eat cactus salad?  Well, this recipe has become a family favorite.  Everyone who tastes this soup asks for the recipe.  Thank you so much!  A twist on lentil soup and tasty too.

Sorry, I thought this was just okay. I tried to make it exactly as written. This recipe used 3 ingredients I'd never used before: jarred nopalitos, dried lentils, and chicken bouillon (granules) - I found the last item (Knorr brand) in the Hispanic section of my grocery store. I wasn't sure if there was some other form of nopales to use; all I could find was jarred "nopalitos", which I didn't cook but just used as-is. The results were probably pretty healthy, but I didn't find it all that exciting, plus I would've liked a lot thicker soup. If I were to make this again, I might cut the water by up to half. For what it's worth, I did share this at a Mexican-themed potluck lunch, and several people said they liked it; and one family took most of the leftover soup.

I'm the type who doesn't love lentils at all but had some in my pantry and wanted to find a good use for it. This recipe did it! It makes people who are not fond of lentils eat it. Great recipe.

Really delicious!  The cactus tastes exactly like green beans.  I really enjoyed making something so out of the ordinary.
