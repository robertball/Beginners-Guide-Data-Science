I baked this for a pre-prom dinner for my son, his date, and another couple.  I wanted it to be perfect - and it was awesome!  I bought two pre-made chocolate crumb pie shells to use as the crust.  I buttered the sides and the bottom of the springform pan before pressing the crumbs/butter mixture in the pan.  I used two premade crusts in order to have my crust go up the sides of the cheesecake.  All my cheesecake ingredients were at room temp.  I researched (on this site) how to bake it in a water bath...check the article by Jennifer Anderson.  I so hoped it would not have a crack when it was baked, but there was one (just one) and so I used a hot,wet knife to rub on top until the crack was gone.  I kept the cake wrapped in the fridge for two days.  On the day of the prom, I took it out of the springform pan, and prior to serving it, I sprinkled oreo crumbs on top and placed oreos (cut in half) around the edges.  I cannot tell you how wonderful this looked and tasted.  It's not easy to totally wow teenagers, but this did the trick.  Thank you, Kristy!

The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the base ingredients as written are not enough to cover the pan. I had to double the amount to get a decent base. That aside this is an excellent cheesecake that went down very well on Christmas Day. Thanks.

This was fabulous! I did add more cookie crumbs for the base, as well as butter to accommodate. I also melted some semi-sweet chocolate and marbled the top. My guests LOVED it!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was a very easy cake to make and a very classic cheesecake.  It's dense and flavorful.  The first time I made it, the top stuck to the sides of the pan so I recommend buttering the sides of the pan.  Also, a pan of water in the bottom of the oven helps.  For the bottom, I used used crushed oreo cookies with the filling removed.

I made this for my brother-in-law's bday yesterday and it was a hit! I used a satiny chocolate glaze recipe that I found here to top it with(3/4 cup chocolate chips, 3 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of dark corn syrup and vanilla extract...heat all the above up and mix well until chocolate is liquified). I also topped that off with crused oreos and chopped chocolate pieces. This is a keeper!

An excellent recipe...tastes decadent when topped with whipped cream and the mentioned toppings. I found this has a tendency to cook quicker than the alloted time so keep your eye on it after 40 mins.

Very good. I used the exact recipe for the filling. For the crust I used one package of graham crackers with 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, and 1/3 cup melted butter. I topped the cheesecake with chocolate ganache made from 1 cup melted semi sweet chips, 3 T of butter, 1 T corn syrup and 1 tsp of vanilla. Sprinkled crushed chocolate chip cookies on top.

I couldn't find any chocolate cookie crumbs so I made the crust with 1 1/2 cups graham cracker, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/3 cup butter (from the chocolate chip cheesecake I recipe). This was my first time making a cheesecake and it was very good. Rich & filling. The only thing I'll do different next time is add some chocolate chips to the top prior to baking for a more chocolate taste.

I scaled back this recipe to 1/3 to use in my 6 in. springform pan.  *Cook crust 6 min, cake for 35 min.*  Turned out yummy!  Also, if you don't have the chocolate cookies, you can always substitute graham crumbs and some cocoa.

This was my 3rd cheesecake recipe.  Although the first one I tried (from Allrecipes) I have made 3 times - White Chocolate Blueberry Cheesecake.  Compared to that this was bland.  But, still good.  I doubled the crust recipe because I like mine halfway up the side of the cake.  I also clarified the butter.  I did the pan of water in the oven as suggested but still developed a massive canyon of a crack in the cake - I am sure my fault and not that of the recipe.  So I took one user's advice and made a chocolate sauce to pour into the crack.  I used mini chocolate chips, sugar, milk and corn syrup.  Also, 55 minutes baking time was too long for my oven, the cake turned an unattractive brown color around the edges and top.  And, if you forget to put the mini chips in and accidently pour the batter into the crust never fear.  You can still gently mix them in, just be careful not to disturb the crust.  On the flavor issue, it was a very good tasting cake.  If you want flavor, you have to make a flavored cake ie)peanut butter or chocolate.  This is a very good basic cheesecake.

I've been making this recipe for many years, my additions some orange and lemon zest that give it a little more zing. Other than that I follow the recipe as written.
I use chocolate ganache as the topping.

This might be a 5 star cheesecake for those that really know how to do them right.  Mine turned out pretty well, considering it was one of my first.  It was a bit heavy and dense, but maybe that's from my technique?  I followed the instructions pretty closely, but I used the chocolate cookie crumbs from one premade crust, with some butter, pressed into the bottom of the pan.  I suggest using 2 premade crusts - 1 is not nearly enough to cover the bottom, and it would have been nicer to have the crust go up the side a bit.  Use a good amount of butter in the bottom of the pan and up the sides!  I also baked it in a water bath (pretty easy!  follow the instructions on this site) and it turned out without a crack.  All in all, a good recipe, especially if you really know how to do a cheesecake!

Excellent desert!!  My dinner guests kept asking me "Where did you BUY this from" The recipe makes enough for two pies if you use the ready made crusts in the pans.

The cheesecake itself was excellent but the crust was hard as a rock.  Will not bake the crust next time and I think it will come out perfect.

i made this cake the night before new years eve and after it cooled down from baking- i tossed it in the freezer.  the following evening i brought it to a dinner party and it thawed nicely by dessert time.  i was amazed at how many compliments i got...considering it was soooo easy to make.  i used all lowfat cheeses in my recipe (not fat-free) and i think it tasted just as rich as if i hadn't skimped on the fat and calories.  this one is a keeper.

This recipe was excellent.  Very easy to make, it came out beautiful.  Not even a crack on the top.  However I did use more cookie crumbs and butter for the crust and had it go half way up the sides for a nicer presentation, and love chocolate crust.  I also would have cut down the prebake time to only about 6 mins since it does bake later.  Will be making it again.

This was absolutely fabulous! My husband raved to friends about it for weeks. I will be making it again soon! It was the best Chocolate Chip Cheesecake I ever had, and it was the first time I made it. For me, that's amazing because I always mess recipes up the first time. This is a must! Thanks!

The cheesecake came out really well. I got great reviews on it and was even approached to sell one! It tastes best, IMO, with a chocolate topping made up of melted semisweet chocolate morsels.

This was delicious!  I used a premade Oreo crust, instead of making one as the recipe calls for, but it turned out great.  After the cheesecake had set overnight in the refrigerator, the oreo crust had picked up some of the cheesecake flavor, and was a great change as opposed to the usual graham cracker crust.

I made this cheesecake to take to my parents for Christmas.  It was my first attempt at a cheesecake from scratch and I was so very excited.  It did crack at the top (due to my inexperience) but it was soo delicious.  My husband loved it!

GREAT recipe!! This was my first ever attempt at cheesecake and it came out perfect! Everyone raved and couldn't believe that I didn't buy it. I also liked it because it didn't seem as dense and heavy as store bought ones, but had all the taste. I am going to make this again and again!

This was my first attempt at cheesecakes and I made it for a my housewarming party. It was a HUGE success and, since then, I have been hounded to make it for work parties and friend's barbecues. A perfect cheescake!

Yum! We had some mint chips that we needed to use, and I found this recipe. We used 2/3 of the recipe, and it fit nicely in a premade, storebought chocolate graham cracker crust. For those curious, the 2/3 recipe bakes for about forty minutes. With the mint chips, this dessert was super rich, but super delicious!

I was practicing with a new mini (4.5 in) springform pan and found this recipe.  I divided it  by 3 and still had enough for 2 'baby' cheese cakes.  My husband is my Guinea pig and was tickled pink with my experiment!  I shared 2 pictures, but only meant to share one.  It's only a baby cheesecake after all ;-)...

I've made this cheesecake 2 times now, and both were fabulous.  I used Mint Chocolate chips entirely for one and a mixture of Mint and regular chips for the other.  Rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  For the 2nd one, I made a chocolate topping I found in another cheesecake recipe (Chocolate Cheesecake II), using  1/4 cup Heavy whipping cream,  1 tsp. vanilla and 1 cup of chocolate chips.  The original topping called for 1 1/2 cups of chips, but I reduced it and poured off a bit of the liquid when I was mixing in the chips.  That was a really good addition to this cheesecake.

Very yummy, I added cocoa powder to make it even more chocolatey. I did have some issues with the cake cracking on top so I just covered it with melted chocolate. Also had to cook it a little bit longer than on the recipe.

The best cheese cake I have ever made. Better than what I made in pastry school. I did not have chocolate cookie crumbs so I added cocoa to graham crumbs. Also used vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Delicious :D

Nice recipe, but with the quantity of ingredients specified, it's more suited to an 8-inch springform pan.  To make it for a nine-inch springform, the recipe has to be doubled.  I would suggest for the crust using either chocolate graham crackers or the Nabisco Chocolate Wafers instead of the chocolate sandwich cookies.    Also, add about 1 tablespoon of sugar to the crust before adding the melted butter. It gives the crust a little sweetness without being cloying.  When patting the crust into the pan, you can either use your hands or a flat-bottom glass to press the cookie mixture into the pan, while building it slightly up the wall and using the side of the glass to flatten it a bit.
