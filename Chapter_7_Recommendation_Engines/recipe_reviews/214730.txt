Pretty dessert! Very tasty! We added Orange juice instead of milk just to add a little tartness to the sweet of the marshmallow! Lightens ups the sweetness a bit!Really great dish to share during the summer months!

Made one with peaches & one with strawberries for a party. Everyone loved them, but they seemed to like the strawberry one the best. I will make this again. :)

I have had this recipe for years, but it was made with either cherry or blueberry pie filling. Tried it with the peaches--it was phenomenol!! Thanks for a new twist on a family favorite.

This was a wonderful dessert!  I used a combination of ripe and almost ripe peaches some were slightly tart.   I am glad because the creme is very sweet!  I can see how the others liked it with strawberries for sure!  I used the home made vanilla bean marshmallows from Whole Foods... M.mm.mmmmmm! Ps...Wait for the marshmallow to cool...Don't ruin it with cool whip! It wouldn't compare!

Absolutely delicious. It melts in your mouth. I bet you can't just eat one piece. I brought it to a women's get together & it got rave reviews. In fact, I'm making it again for my dinner party. yummy. I followed the directions exactly & it was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing.

Used fresh strawberries. It was amazing, my new favorite dessert. Our dinner guest just asked me for the recipe. Note: I added the whipped cream before the marshmallow mix cooled and it 'deflated' the whipped cream. I wonder if using a tub of coolwhip would change the taste/texture?

Great Dessert! Everyone enjoyed it and several commented on the fresh peach flavor. I followed the recipe with the exception of using 7 peaches (mine were not very big) and I forgot to reserve 1/4 cup of the crust to sprinkle on top. I am looking forward to making this again before the end of summer and fresh peaches. Thanks for sharing!

Everyone loved this! I microwaved the mini marshmallows and milk at 50% power for 45 seconds twice, stirring after each time increment which makes quick work of the melting marshmallow step.  For the crumb base I subbed 1/2 ginger snap cookies and processed them in the food processor with the graham cracker crumbs and the butter.  I reserved 1/2 cup to sprinkle on top just because the crumbs were so tasty! Used a chilled bowl and beaters which helped with the whipped cream on such a hot and toasty day! I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is one of those desserts that you pull from the fridge to take one little bite and end up eating a whole bunch!  We all loved this!  I followed the directions to a T, and I wouldn't make any changes.  Don't be tempted to use other products in place of the marshmallows/whipping cream mixture because it won't be quite the same!  Yes, that does take a little time, but it's worth it. You'll need a 10 oz bag of marshmallows for this.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is amazing and simple.  If you don't want to make the graham cracker crust then buy one pre-made, but you'll miss out on the crumbles on top.  Don't let the marshmallow cool too much or it will be difficult to combine.  Feel free to experiment but this is perfect just the way it is.

OMG!  My great aunt made this dessert when I was a kid some 20 years ago (from Illinois)!  I've been searching for the recipe and this is pretty dang close!  My whole family loves it, kiddos too.  Since I live in New Zealand graham crackers aren't easy to come by so I just used a plain cookie which was ok but not recommended.  My great aunt used vanilla wafers which is what I would definitely recommend!  I too melted my marshmallows in the microwave and would also suggest you do that first so they can cool.  In my opinion there is no substitute for fresh cream.  My husband isn't a huge fan of fresh cream but mixed with the marshmallow he loved it.  I've never tried with other fruits but man, with peaches it's divine!  Simply yummy and incredibly easy!  Will keep this forever now I found it again!!!  Thanks.

This is a great end-of-summer recipe -- along with peaches being in season this time of year, we had marshmallows and graham crackers left over from a Labor Day camping trip! Thus, instead of mini marshmallows I used 5 c. of the regular size. Also, I had Redi-whip left over from a party so I used 7 c. of that instead of the cream and sugar.  I added about 6 iced oatmeal cookies with the graham cracker mixture for added flavor.  I used 6 white peaches, diced, and made these in muffin tins.  I made a dozen individual servings in muffin tins, then had enough left over to fill a pie dish as well -- and still had about three cups of peaches left for snacking! I filled each muffin tin with about 1 T. graham cracker mixture, 1 T. whipped mixture, 1 1/2 T. peaches, 1 T. whipped mixture and a sprinkle of graham cracker mixture on top.  The dessert holds up fairly well in the muffin tins and doesn't require spoons if you eat carefully.

Made this 2 days ago with fresh Tx peaches, and it was delightful, but the crust wasn't light and crumbly and had to be eaten with spoons. Although it was delicious, I think there are other faster recipes of the same sort that don't require quite the effort.

This dessert was wonderful. I put 1/4 cup of sugar in the graham crackers instead of 1/2 (by mistake initially), but used the 1/4 extra to keep the peaches from turning brown. I chunked my peaches and put sugar over them versus slicing and laying flat which also worked well, but took more time. I have found that it works well to melt the marshmellows first so that they can cool while you are doing the other steps. I have taken this to work and also served at my son's birthday party. I have printed several copies of the recipe for others per thier request.  It is very good and would be excellent with other fruits as well.

Wonderful recipe. Enjoyed by every one of the 30 who had it for dessert today.  I used nectarines because the peaches didn't look so good.  And in the second go around I eliminated the sugar in the whipped cream.  Given that marshmallows are entirely sugar, it was a bit of overkill to add sugar to the whipping cream.  An excellent dessert, elegant - and even those who wouldn't normally care about having dessert raved about this.

We love this!  This is my go-to dessert for gatherings.  I've made this several times, always layered in a trifle bowl for a lovely presentation (3 layers of crust, cream, then fruit, ending with a sprinkling of crust on top).  I've used peaches, sweetened strawberries, and a tropical concoction of crushed pineapple, sliced bananas, and coconut (added coconut cream to cream mixture).  I'm always asked for the recipe.  It gets better as the days go by.  Hubs wants me to try blackberries next.  Hmm, we'll see ;)

Super easy and very good - I learned that I cannot whip coffee cream so I used 1 tub of cool whip instead and it was super good - I can imagine how amazing this would be with real cream!

My sister made this exactly as the recipe said, as we always do.  It was so sweet my teeth started shaking! We knew this still had potential, so we made changes to better suit my palate (she was OK with the sweetness). Cut out most of the added sugar - added just 1 TBSP of sugar to the graham cracker crust and also only 1 TBSP of sugar to the whipping cream, along with a bit of vanilla. We used orange juice concentrate instead of milk, too.

I made this recipe to take to my church picnic! WOW! It was a hit. I only had one tiny piece left and everyone wanted the recipe. I did not change a thing. The great thing is that I took a chance and made it Saturday morning hoping that the peaches would not discolor by Sunday at noon. I was not disappointed. I will definitely make this again!

Totally AWESOME!  As some others, I used strawberries instead because I couldn't find any good peaches.  I also used a store bought graham cracker crust and popped it in the oven for about 7 minutes.  Didn't have any 'leftover' cracker crumbs for the top so I sprinkled it with a few walnuts. Totally refreshing and YUMMY dessert! I will make this again and hopefully get my hands on some good peaches!  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

It is easy and sweet, even though I did the bellow changes: 1/2 cup butter instead of 3/4cp. No sugar is added I'm
N grahammix. 4 TBSP sugar into whipping cream instead of 1/3 cup. 32pcs regular size marshmallows instead of 4 1/2 cup mini ones.

I needed a recipe for fresh peaches and was tired of making peach cobblers and crisp.  This was so delicious and a really fresh changeup

I was looking for a dessert that would use fresh peaches, uncooked.  It is a shame to bake in a pie when you can get local, in season fruit.  This dessert was perfect!

I used fresh strawberries in mine as peaches are out of season. I heated my marshmallow and milk mixture in the microwave which worked very well. I heated it on high for 30 seconds, stirred it, and heated it again for 30 seconds more and it was enough to melt the marshmallows. I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't take long at all to make. I did purchase a prepared graham cracker crust pie shell to save time. I had enough filling for that plus two cups  worth of dessert without crust. I sliced the strawberries in the first layer, then halved strawberries to make a design on the top of the pie. It sliced nice and clean. It tasted like strawberries and marshmallows. While it was very good, this is not a "to die for" recipe which is why I am giving it 4 stars. Still, it fit the bill for a light, fresh tasting dessert to follow a heavy meal. The company enjoyed it and hubby was happy to have more the next day.

warmed the marshmellows on low, added 2 containers cool whip when mix was cool. Chopped peaches (didn't read directions) and added to mix. Then I read the directions so sliced more peaches and layered per recipe. Used packaged graham cracker crust as I was in a hurry. crushed gingerbread for the crumb topping (added right before served)

First of all, it was a huge hit with my family!  It was easy to make and very delicious!  I have to admit that I subbed cool whip for the whip cream though cause my whipped cream was not coming out wrong. 2 thumbs up!

I wanted to really like this... But I didn't.  I liked the fact that everything's made from scratch.  It yielded a lot, and it's a shame because I didn't think it was good.  A lot of this could just be the peaches I used were not that sweet.  If I had used the peaches for something that required baking they may have been better.  The crust and whipped cream came out good.  Just way too much work for just a so-so dessert.

It was ok but I wouldn't make it again. Wasn't much peach just a whip cream graham cracker dessert mostly. A little disappointed.

Not a fan. I was expecting the peach flavor to come through more than it did. The volume of very sweet whipped cream was overwhelming. Crust was okay. My guests and family agreed this was not a keeper recipe for fresh peaches.

I've made this exactly as written, and then two other ways. The most popular was exactly as original except 4 peaches and a little over 1/2 pound of fresh cherries. This dessert gets completely eaten every time, and I get a ton of compliments. So a five star for orig, and with variety. I made a banana/ chocolate version but it was too sweet. Stick to the fresh, summertime, stone fruits. Yum!!!!

Ive made this recipe for years.  But I make the crust with vanilla wafer, which gives it a more delicate taste with the peaches.

This was just okay. I thought this would be a no-fail recipe but I was found it was a lot of work for what you got. I used raspberries as well as peaches (but otherwise followed the recipe exactly) and it was really the fresh fruit that carried the dish - serving them with sweetened whipped cream would have been a lot less work and tasted better.

I've made this numerous times…Might be the best dessert I've ever had and all of my guests have concurred.  Peaches MUST be fresh and ripe though.

This was AMAZING!  My only hint would be not to let the marshmallow cool toooo much as it doesn't blend easy with the whipped cream. Will make again and again and again.

My husband and I LOVE this dessert and make it almost every summer.  Sometimes, instead of peaches, we will substitute strawberries and blueberries and it tastes just as good!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I would like to make this dessert for a pot luck church picnic in June.  I have a 5 pound bag of graham cracker crumbs in my freezer that I bought at my bulk store.  Can anyone tell me how many cups of crumbs I need to equal 16 full crackers.  Thanks for any help or suggestions.
