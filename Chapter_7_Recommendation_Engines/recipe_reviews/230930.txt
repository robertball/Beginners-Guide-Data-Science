This was so delicious! I don't like cauliflower, so I used all red potatoes. I also found they needed some cream because my family likes creamy potatoes. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I'm making this again today.

It was healthy, filling, better if it wasn't so runny. Next time drain the tomatoes. We did not use green pepper.

good just like it was. (except did not have a yellow pepper).  I think the balsalmic vinaigrette really spiced it up.  will definitely make again, maybe trying to increase the tomato/mushroom/pepper sauce since it was good to also top the mashed potatoes with.  plus fresh basil!  Yum!!!
