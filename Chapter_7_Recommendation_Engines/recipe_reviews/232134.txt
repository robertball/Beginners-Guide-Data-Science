Made this for a dear friend's birthday. He prefers pudding over cake. I doubled the batch (whole package of Oreos) but only used 8 ounces of Cool Whip. It was fabulous and gobbled up quickly.

5.12.16   I needed something quick and easy when  our neighbors decided to get together for an impromptu  cook-out last night and asked me to bring dessert.  Didn't have any vanilla pudding on hand, so I used white chocolate sugar-free pudding, skim milk, and light whipped topping to lighten the recipe.  This is sooooo easy to make and was a total hit.

Very easy, my son especially loves it.  Extra cookie crumbles recommended!  We served it with fresh strawberries also, yummy!

I love this recipe!  So delicious and a lot less calories than the dirt pudding with butter, powdered sugar, and cream cheese!  Always a big hit at parties and super easy to make!
