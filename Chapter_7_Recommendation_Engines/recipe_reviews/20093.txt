These were great.  For breakfast, with pasta, soup or salad.  I doubled the bacon and cheese. I only used about 1/3 the garlic, maybe a little more.  And I used about 4 TBSP of chopped fresh green onions, instead of the chives.  A definate keeper. My family loved them.

I loved these muffins!!!  But I think that next time I make them I will cut back on the salt and oil.  They were a bit greasy, and a little saltier than I like.  They are crusty on the outside,and soft and fluffy on the inside.  Yummy!

I changed the recipe a bit myself and used two cups of cheddar instead of one and used fewer garlics than it suggested. The taste is good. Think goes better if with soup.

Took the advice of others and used butter instead of oil and I think that was the right move.  These smell wonderful and taste just as good.  They came out pretty dense and rich so they go a long way.  Will make again.

I give these 4.5 stars.  They are delicious!  I served them for a small meeting in my house.  What a hit!  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I used bacon bits (made of real bacon, not the plastic-y ones) instead of cooking bacon.  For one, it was what I had.  For two, it made it less of a mess to make.  I also substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil to make them a bit healthier.  I don't think either substitution changed the outcome of the recipe at all.  Delicious!!

The muffins stick to the liners--greased pans would probably be better if you're having company over. Also, I substituted 1/3 cu. mozzarella cheese, 1/3 cu. extra sharp cheddar, and 1/3 cu. cheddar cheese for the 1 cu. sharp cheddar cheese.

Amazing savory muffin, more of biscuit.  Perfect for brunch with eggs.  This is a keeper.  I used fresh snipped chives instead of dried.

I tried, I really did. These sounds so good in theory but even with adjustments they come out heavy and bland. I tried twice but I think they got nibbled on and then tossed both times.

Amazing recipe, the tastes are so delicious!  Only thing I would suggest is rolling the dough into balls and putting out on baking shee instead.

These are delicious muffins, although I think biscuits would be a better description for them.  I've followed the recipe as is and it's delicious, although I recommend using mini muffin tins instead of full size.  More recently, I had to substitute a few ingredients and I think they came out even better!  I used a whole can of broccoli cheese soup in place of cream of mushroom and decreased the oil by at least half.  Not having chives on hand, I chopped some green onions instead.  Threw in about a quarter cup of shredded Swiss along with the cheddar, and baked in mini muffin tins for 12 minutes (no wrappers necessary).

These are delicious muffins, although I think biscuits would be a better description for them.  I've followed the recipe as is and it's delicious, although I recommend using mini muffin tins instead of full size.  More recently, I had to substitute a few ingredients and I think they came out even better!  I used a whole can of broccoli cheese soup in place of cream of mushroom and decreased the oil by at least half.  Not having chives on hand, I chopped some green onions instead.  Threw in about a quarter cup of shredded Swiss along with the cheddar, and baked in mini muffin tins for 12 minutes (no wrappers necessary).

Not something that I'd make all of the time since it took over an hour to make a double batch, but everyone really liked them.  Although I'd be willing to eat them for breakfast, I'm not sure that I'd call them a breakfast muffin.  Also, they remind me more of drop biscuits than muffins and didn't cook for nearly as long.  Mini-muffins took 12 minutes and full size muffins took 16 minutes.     After reading that some other cooks found the recipe a bit bland, I made these changes: 1.  I increased the amount of Parmesan, garlic, & chives by about about half again. 2.  I substituted buttermilk for the milk and added a bit more to make up for the extra thickness 3.  I used the bacon fat instead of the oil  I might make them next time w/o the bacon.  If I did, I think that they'd remind me of the Red Lobster biscuits.

These were very good, I didn't have chives so I substituted a teaspoon of onion powder and a teaspoon of dried dill for color. The flavor and texture were excellent.

These turned out great.  I served them to 15 people for breakfast and received lots of compliments on them.  I left the recipe exactly as is and it seemed to turn out perfectly.

We loved it as the recipe was written, however I think next time I will add chopped onion and maybe more seasoning. I think those who complained it was too salty should have made sure they used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. There is salt in bacon, cheese, and mushroom soup. Really don't need to add salt at all. Consistence was great, taste was good, more like addicting rather than tasty. My husband thought they tasted great! They will be made again and again.

How could people write that these are bland?  Surely they couldn't be.  But they are.  Somehow all the bacon and chive is lost in these.  I even put extra of both because I didn't have enough of either to bother saving.  Didn't hate these, but won't try again.

Made these this morning and they were pretty good.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Next time I might do half and half.  I also used half oil and half applesauce, to cut down on the fat content.

Mine are in the oven now, I messed with the recipe a bit: Instead of bacon I used a handful of chopped white onion, instead of condensed soup I used a bit more milk and chopped parsley instead of chives. I have made them with bacon before just wanted to try something different. We'll see how they come out!

YUMMMM!  I made 30 mini muffins to bring to my MOPS meeting tomorrow.  I baked for about 10-15 minutes.  My family and I just had to each have one, since they smelled so good while baking.  The outside was nice and crisp while the inside was moist and soft. It's a perfect breakfast food for me since I don't care for sweets!

I've made these numerous times and they are always a hit. I use more bacon than the recipe calls for and I use cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom. Sometimes I use the bacon fat instead of the veggie oil but the texture is better with the oil.

These are always a huge hit when I make them.  I double the cheese, and use mini-muffin pans and they are always gone in minutes.  They are a great side to a meal or alone for a breakfast muffin.  Thanks for the recipe!

These had great flavor! I have to say though that these are very time consuming to make (longer than the 15 minutes stated) so I most likely won't add them to my regulars. I would reccomed warming any leftovers before you eat them to get the most flavor out of them!
