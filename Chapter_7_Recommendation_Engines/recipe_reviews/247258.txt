I loved these. I like that they are oven fried and still nice and crispy. I followed as written except I added a bit more garlic. Will make again, thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used salt-free veggie spice instead of seasoning salt. My toddlers absolutely devoured them and hubby loved them too. Definitely a keeper.
