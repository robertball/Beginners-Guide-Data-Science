Awesome recipe. I was a bit apprehensive at first with only 1 review but I tried it and love it. I used cow milk and it worked also. I filled it with savoury filling and it will be my lunch at work often, and weekends. Enjoy :-)

Followed the recipe  as written and the pancakes were nice and fluffy and I couldn't tell they were gluten free.

followed recipe to the t  & they were great.  be careful when flipping 1st time -- wait til fully cooked on underside so crepe won't tear (very delicate). let them cool a wee bit and serve with cool whip and blueberries  (yum x 100)

Great pancakes for gf. I now add in more flour and cook for longer on lower heat to make them fluffier. and to simplify I just use all purpose flour from king arthur. I think it comes out to a little over a cup for 2 people, like 1 1/3.

I have tried several different gluten free crepe recipes and these top them all!  Very tender, flavorful, and crispy on the outside.  The only change I made was to substitute dairy free butter.  My seven year old granddaughter ate 6 of them and said, “Grammy these are the best!”  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.
