These were pretty darn good. With a couple changes, the texture came out just perfect; they weren't too crunchy or too soft as other reviewers have stated. First, I replaced the oil with butter. I make a few different kinds of biscotti, and I've never seen a recipe call for oil. I figured the butter would be tastier. Second, to ensure a crucnchy yet not-too-hard texture, I mixed the ingredients according to most biscotti recipes I've tried. I mixed all the dry ingredients, incuding the sugar. Then I cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembled course crumbs. In a seperate bowl, I lightly beat the eggs and the molasses together. I added this to the dry mix. I mixed this concoction until it was just combined. No overmixing! The dough should still be crumbly. I divided the dough in half and formed them into their log shapes on the cookie sheets. It's still pretty crumbly at this point, but it all firms up when you bake it. This looser dough allows the biscotti to cook up crunchy without being dense or hard. I think that's the reason some people ended up with tough cookies. You have to keep the dough kinda loose. Anyway, when I finsihed the baking process, I dipped them in white chocolate. Deliciousness.

This is a good recipe after I changed a few things from what other reviewers have said and from other biscotti recipes I use.  I used 6 T marjarine instead of oil.  I omitted the whole wheat flour and ended up using about 4 cups white flour to get the right consistancy.  I also added a teaspoon vanilla and used 3 1/2 t. Pampered Chefs Cinnamon Plus instead of all the seasonings, it's just easier as it has all of them in it.    Next I divided into 3 logs and rolled them in Raw sugar mixed with a little cinnamon then flattened them.  It gave it a nice look after baking.  The easiest way to make biscotti is to bake on a Pampered Chef Bar stone(yes there is a difference in stones) They won't burn and when you bake the 2nd time, you just stand them up about 1/2 inch apart and don't have to flip them.  I'm not sure if I will do any white chocolate on them or not.  They do look pretty the way they are.

this may be the best biscotti I have ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly (even the cooking time) and they came out perfectly.  I don't know why some others had so much trouble.  The dough wasn't sticky at all.  Even my 6 year old had one with milk tonight and loved it!  This is a keeper. Thanks so much Christina!

Nice crispy, crunchy, spicy little treats. I followed the recipe as written with the oil, because butter is not normally used in genuine Italian biscotti, which never have a buttery taste. Those who think these taste bland might benefit from the addition of 1/2 tsp salt. Also, adding 1/4 tsp baking soda will keep the spices from giving a slightly bitter edge. If you want the spiciness to have a kick, 1/8 tsp black pepper or a couple of good shakes of cayenne will accomplish what you're looking for. I baked for exactly the time specified (25 minutes,) sliced and baked another 7 minutes per side. They came out properly light, dry and crunchy. Also avoided overmixing, which kept them from turning out tough. Painted the bottoms with white chocolate. Also, used half Splenda and half sugar. Delicious!

Look out Starbucks! This recipe is fantastic. I've made a lot of biscotti in the past, so I decided to use butter instead of oil (1/3C). To get the gingerbread into the right size logs I wet my hands and had no problem shaping them into the desired shape. I baked them for 20min, let them cool for 5min, then cut them and turned them on their sides, baked for 4 more minutes, and they were done. I drizzled white chocolate on them when cool. I will make this over and over again!

Maybe it's me, but I always like a little bite to my gingerbread so I add a dash (or two in my case) of finely ground black pepper.  This is one cookie that I always get recipe requests for. And people are impressed that biscotti is not something that has to be purchased.

I thought this was a great recipe. I did sub 1 stick of butter for the oil, Blackstrap molasses for regular molasses, used all wheat flour and rapidura suger instead of the white.

I also followed "Firefly07"s instructions for how to mix it up They said "Second, to ensure a crunchy yet not-too-hard texture, I mixed the ingredients according to most biscotti recipes I've tried. I mixed all the dry ingredients, incuding the sugar. Then I cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembled course crumbs. In a seperate bowl, I lightly beat the eggs and the molasses together. I added this to the dry mix. I mixed this concoction until it was just combined. No overmixing! The dough should still be crumbly. I divided the dough in half and formed them into their log shapes on the cookie sheets. It's still pretty crumbly at this point, but it all firms up when you bake it. This looser dough allows the biscotti to cook up crunchy without being dense or hard."

Thank you Cristina & Thank you Firely 07..this is the first time I ever made biscotti and it was awesome!

GREAT taste!  I did use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour as I didn't have any.  The only other change I made was to lower the temperature to 325 degrees for the second baking.  I put them in for 10 minutes on each side.  The recipe was hard to follow because I had to make adjustments for the spices.  They are written in fractions of a tablespoon and my measuring spoons are not that size.  The ground ginger at 1 1/2 tablespoons would be 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons...the cinnamon at 3/4 tablespoon would be 2 1/4 teaspoons....the ground cloves at 1/2 tablespoon would be 1 1/2 teaspoons..the nutmeg is fine!  I hope this helps others so you don't have to figure it out.  (and myself the next time I make it.  lol) The biscotti is so good the recipe is still worthy of 5 stars!  The aroma of this baking will knock your socks off!  Thank you Cristina for sharing.  It is being included in my assortment of biscotti Christmas gifts.

Delicious and easy!  Fills the house with the smells of Christmas!  I dipped them in white chocolate melts, and hubby loved them!  I did reduce the baking time, as they were burning a bit on the bottom.

These biscotti are delicious! I made it with oil as stated in the recipe and  used all white flour, and they turned out great. Please do not let the oil scare you - you do NOT have to substitute butter, margarine, or shortening.  This recipe couldn't be simpler and the oil is the reason! Just add it in.  I did bump up the spices, and I dipped the  biscotti in melted white chocolate and then drizzled with melted dark chocolate for a pretty effect. Absolutely incredible. UPDATE: I made these for Christmas for some of my co-workers, and ALL of them absolutely raved!! I wrapped them up in colorful cellophane bags from the dollar store, and tied with a pretty ribbon. I will definitely make these again!

Very yummy biscotti, great in coffee, good with cream cheese cinnamon roll icing too.  25 mins cooking time was slightly long and I unfortunately didnt check it, but turned out ok, just slightly overcrispy and dark on the ends. I'll watch it more closely the last 5 mins next time.

The taste is very good and easy to make. Make sure you flatten the dough to 1/2 inch thickness as directed, mine was a little thicker and ended up very doughy in the middle when I cut them, they did cook through when I baked them the second time. I did dip one side in vanilla almond bark. My husband said they were very good dipped in coffee.

These are decent but really need a little more kick! Next time I am going to add real ginger (either crystallized or fresh rather than ground) and some more cloves. Also, they benefited from some icing.

Not sure why everyone is changing this recipe....make it exactly this way and they will turn out so yummy! My Sicilian Grandmother would be proud.

Just have to start watching it around 20 minutes, depending on your oven. If you use a long serrated knife and cut slowly, they turn out great. Biscotti should be a little crumbly when cutting because it gets crispy when it goes back in for the 2nd baking.

Remember that baking takes patience and love. Great recipe! Mangia

i have to strongly disagree with firefly's recommendations. first: biscotti are an italian cookie, and italians rarely use butter in their cooking. and honestly, for those with cholesterol issues, oil is the better choice anyway! second: there is no reason to change the directions for mixing the dough. most cookie recipes call for mixing fat and sugar, then adding eggs and any liquid flavorings, and last mixing in the dry ingredients (which have been stirred together) about 1/3 at a time. do not mix thoroughly each time you add the dry ingredients - you should still see a bit of unmixed flour when you add the next bit. that being said, these are wonderful cookies! i did add some chopped pecans and raisins that i soaked in triple sec before mixing in - i like little crunchy, chewy nuggets in my biscotti - and i dredged the slices in cinnamon sugar before the second baking, to give them a bit more crunch. even my rather fussy 18-year old likes these!

Oh my goodness, this was absolutely delicious!  I've made a lot of biscotti and I think this is my new favorite.  I did use egg beaters instead of eggs but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  As with all biscotti, you need to use wet hands to form the loaves on the parchment covered baking sheet.  Smooth them out and shape into long rectangles.  They probably should have baked for about 5 more minutes but I just upped the baking time after they were cut.  I then spread a bit of white baking chocolate over the cut edge on one side.  I had to make a pot of coffee just so I could try one of these little gems and I wasn't disappointed!  Tastes like autumn in your mouth!

Excellent!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used butter instead of oil.  I was going to drizzle white chocolate over it, but I scorched the chocolate while melting it, so I just made a vanilla glaze and drizzled that instead.  They are so tasty!  These are going to go so well with coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. I've never made biscotti before so I am pleased how well this came out for me.  Thank you for this easy recipe!

Wonderful recipe as written and does not need any modifications. I did bake them a little bit longer on the second bake, as I wanted them a little bit more firmer then they were. I also dipped some of them in a little white chocolate. It helps to dampen your hands in cool water when shaping the logs on the cookie sheet, that way they are not as sticky.

Well, these did not turn out for me at all. They were heavy and dense, and tasted flour-y and slighlty bitter. I'm not sure if cutting back on the flour would solve all those issues. Seems like there is a little too much baking powder. They rose, and became mishapen on the second bake. I had no problems with stickiness - rather, it seemed dry. The concept of gingerbread biscotti is interesting, but this is not the recipe I need. Sorry. :(

I woke up this morning to this recipe in an e-mail from Allrecipes.com, and thought it sounded easy enough for vacation baking.  I am SO glad I tried it!  It's delicious!  It has the perfect biscotti texture - very crunchy, but not HARD.  I only changed one thing, on advice from a friend who bakes biscotti often:  After I sliced the baked loaves into the biscotti pieces, I lowered the oven temperature to 275 and baked for 15 minutes, then turned the cookies over and baked for 15 more minutes, just to be certain that the cookies had dried and crisped all the way through so that they would be crispy-crunchy, not just plain HARD.  There's a houseful of company, and everyone loves these!  Even the smallest children are munching happily :-)

Loved this recipe!  I was a little hesitant about using the oil, based on other reviews, but they turned out great!  I only baked for 4 minutes per side for my second baking.  The dough is very crumbly when you first lay it out on your baking sheet, but it does bake up nicely.  I drizzled mine with white chocolate to which I added a few drops of lemon extract.  Nice combo!

Turned out great!  Followed recipe exactly, except I added a tsp of allspice, cause my grandma taught me that when you add nutmeg you add allspice, also, I just used all purpose flour...
The dough was far too sticky to do anything with, so I added flour until I could work with it. Turned out great!  Even the baking times were spot on for me.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and came out fabulous! I formed my roll right on the cookie sheet instead of forming on the counter and then transferring it. so easy!

Good, but not the best biscotti I have made. The dough was VERY sticky. I baked mine at 350 for 35 minutes and only made it into one long log and it was perfect in texture and color. My husband and I found them to be somewhat of a bitter after taste. Next time I would switch out the oil for butter (prefer it in my biscotti) and add a bit of cream of tarter for the slight bitterness and definitely another 1/4 cup sugar. True Italian Biscotti never uses butter only oil, but we prefer it done with butter. Happy cooking to all!

This was the first time EVER making biscotti and it turned out perfectly thanks to the recipe and a few suggestions from other reviewers!  I mixed the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients sperately then added the wet to the dry to form the dough.  Once I had the dough sperated and each rolled out I brushed lightly with vegetable oil and sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar in the raw onboth sides.  I baked each according to directions, the let them cool--just to the touch-and sliced them with a pizza cutter!  (The pizza cutter works great for this!).  I then baked them for 7 minutes on each side to make them have the crunchy texture I love.  They turned out do beautifully they looked professional!  Next time I may go to the extra effort and dip then either dark or white chocolate.  Should be delish!

Wonderful recipe.... I made it twice this holiday season - the first time I did not have any wheat flour so just substituted all purpose.  I also added chocolate and white chocolate drizzle on top.

This second round, I used the original ingredients although used a little more molasses than called for.  

They're in the oven now and looking really promising!

Great recipe as written. Modifications: added chopped dried fruit (apples, pears, apricots, red plums and black plums).  They cook better for the second baking if placed on a non-stick pizza pan rather than the original cookie sheet. The cookie sheet batch had to cook longer and I ended up standing them upright. Glaze:icing sugar, a bit of butter, milk, and citrus zest.  Delicious for a first attempt at biscotti.

After reading reviews I decided to follow reviewer Baricat's advice, adding 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp. baking soda and 1/4 tsp ground black pepper. Substituted 1/2 splenda for half of the sugar. Used only white flour, cuz I didn't have ww flour.Did add about 3/4 cup more flour to combat stickiness. Very good results, though have since learned that biscotti dough should be very sticky and worked with wet or oiled hands. Traditional biscotti does call for oil instead of butter which I think adds to the crunchier texture. I also chilled over night because it was way past bed time.  Worked beautifully. Next time I will add chopped candied ginger. These will fly off the shelf. Thanks!

Super Delicious!!  I did make a few changes to the recipes, as others suggested.  I substituted 1/2 cup cold butter for the vegetable oil.  I first mixed all dry ingredients together, then cut in the cold butter until coarse crumbs.  In a separate bowl I mixed the eggs and molasses, I then added it to the dry ingredients.  Next I split the dough into 3 equal parts and shaped each into a log, then brushed with an egg wash and baked in a 325 degree oven for approx 22-25 min.  (Do not bake in a 375 degree oven or they will burn).  I sliced them and baked each side for 5-6 min.  Once cool, I dipped each half of the cookie in melted white chocolate.  SO YUMMMY!!

Delish! Went down a treat :) I dipped them in white choc but next time will drizzle the chocolate on.  Yum will be making these again.  I followed FireFly08's suggestions and alterations and they came out great, think next time I will add vanilla and bake them longer on the second bake to get them crunchier.

Great recipe as written. I actually didn't have any cloves and it still turned out great! A bit of trial and error as far as how long to toast the pieces, but I would highly recommend it!

Absolutely wonderful.  I let the dough chill for about 30 minutes and oiled my hands before forming the log.  Baked on parchment paper and they turned out great!  I coated mine in white chocolate with red sprinkles as a Holiday treat for friends.

This was great and perfectly spiced.  My Italian grandmother could NOT get enough of these at Christmas!  I ended up giving her all of the double batch I baked to freeze.  I baked mini biscotti by making it into 4 thinner loaves that I sliced and toasted as usual.  The smaller size is great for inclusion on holiday cookie trays.

This turned out so good!  I did double most of the spices and added a 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.  I can't believe how much it made the spices "pop".  I also added 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda.  I got tons of compliments on it when I took it to work.  The taste got better the second day.  I did dip some of them in white chocolate which tamed the spices but I love the kick.  If you like a sweet treat, I would definitely leave the spices alone and follow the recipe as written.

I will be keeping this recipe for a long time.  I did take the following tips from other reviewers: 1) bump the temp down to 350. 2) add a little more flour (helped to combat stickiness) 3) add a little black pepper for some zip 4) wet my hands to make the dough shaping easier. The flavor was exactly what I hoped it would be.  I left some plain and I drizzled some with a simple sugar glaze (powdered sugar, water, vanilla).  I'm going to try these with Splenda for my diabetic family and friends.  A tip for first timers: the logs spread when baking, so don't put them too close together if you're using one cookie sheet.  And I was too lazy to move the baking rack from the bottom to the middle shelf and they got a little browner than I wanted.  Good thing the temp was only 350.  If it was 375, that laziness could have been catastrophic!  Even with these boo-boos, they turned out awesome!

My mom loves these so I've made them a few times now. I usually add about a tsp more of each seasoning. I have replaced the oil with applesauce, and once with margarine. The margarine made it a bit more brittle, but it had better flavor. I find as well that chilling the dough for at least an hour makes it a bit more manageable.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. I didn't love it. I don't think they had enough gingerbread flavor for me. They did have a good crunch, but the flavor was weak. I may try again and add more spices. Okay base recipe.

These were easy, delicious, and they made a ton.  What more could you ask for?  I made three kinds of biscotti for Christmas gifts at work this year, and this was by far the favorite.  As with others, I found the cooking time just slightly high, causing dark bottoms and ends.  Dipping them in the white chocolate made me forget all about the dark ends though and added quite a bit of appeal.  I found that adding a tablespoon of shortening to the chips helped make the consistency easier for smooth dipping.

Wow.  Great receipe!  I made them once..no one liked them but me.  I made them again.  This time I spread the bottoms with melted white chocolate chips. Everyone went crazy..even some tough critics or said they don't like gingerbread.   The white chocolate is a perfect addition because it mellows out the spice of the cookie with an added  creamey flavor.  Not as crunchy as other biscotti..but no one cared due to the yummy flavor.

This recipe  definitely made it to my make-every-Christmas baking list! Loved the flavor and how easy it is to make.  I used the lemon icing recipe by Carol to ice the biscotti and then after the icing had set, I used bittersweet chocolate melted and drizzled over the biscotti to make a very professional looking cookie.  Gave them as gifts this year to rave reviews.

Love this recipe!  Very easy. I made exactly as written and they turned out great.  I used blackstrap molasses because that's what I had on hand and I don't know if that made any difference, but they tasted great!  Will definatley be making these again!

Delicious!  I did reduce the spices considerably, because I wanted a milder cookie (1/2 t each of cinnamon and ginger), but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I shared these at work and got rave reviews!  Thanks so much!

I enjoyed this recipe. As others have mentioned, they're not super-spiced, but I think that makes more sense for biscotti, as they don't tend to be super-sweet cookies. Dipped in milk or coffee, they taste like Christmas.

However, mine didn't turn out crispy; they're more dense and a bit chewey. I have another biscotte recipe that calls for doing an initial bake at a lower tempt for longer, and I may try that next time to see if I get a more biscotti-like texture.

And a warning: These really spread out during baking. It's not a negative of the recipe, but I wish I had known that in advance because I would have made my logs narrower.

This recipe is a keeper as-is. Made a batch this morning following directions as printed.  They came out great but missed a bit of a kick only because I had one tablespoon of ginger left in the jar.  I'm making another batch this afternoon (bought some ginger) and plan to spice it up with more ginger, some crystallized ginger and black pepper.

I have to admit I made a few changes the first time I made these. (I usually try a recipe as is the first time). I used brown sugar instead of white, and only AP flour. They are fantastic, I love the flavor, but they needed to be a little crispier, so next batch I make I am going to decrease the temp and cook them a bit longer.

Great recipe!  It was even better when dipped in melted white chocolate.  Would give it 5 stars if the recipe suggested to dip it in white chocolate.  Besides that wouldn't change anything about the recipe.  Very good!

I thought this recipe was good, but not all that flavorful. Maybe it was missing vanilla or something. I did follow all directions exactly, but I've had better and made better. Sometimes things like this taste better after a day or two so if I like it better I will come back and change the rating. It was easy to make though, which was nice.

Very nice recipe. The spice is nice and light. If you're looking for a nice change of pace, this is definitely up there. I dipped part of ours with white chocolate, and next time, maybe I would add chopped walnuts.   But turned out lovely. I would make it again.

Oh my gosh, YUM!  I added a little pepper to give the gingerbread a bit of a kick, but other than that I followed the recipe.  Very easy, good results.  I'm going to make a whole slew of these biscotti for our Christmas party!

Perfect.  I didn't change a single thing.  They mixed together perfectly and taste delicious.  Just have to frost them a little and am taking them for gifts tonight.  Next time I might put them in my big Kitchen aid to mix, but I was really pleased with the mixture.  Will definitely make again.

LOVED these. Followed the directions precisely as written and they came out perfectly! I made a orange frosting glaze to dip each of the finished biscotti in. You can't go wrong with orange and ginger. Perfect for coffee or a hot cup of earl gray tea.

these came out pretty good---I am NOT a baker, and have never baked anything from scratch before;  these don't have quite the familiar texture that I'm used to with biscotti, but that might be because I substituted stevia for the sugar and EggBeaters for the eggs.  The flavor is lovely, and overall, I'm pleased with the outcome.

I don't know what the difficulty is that some folks seem to have with this recipe. With the exception of normal adjustments I make due to my altitude (8,000 feet), I followed the recipe and these biscotti come out fantastic! My dough was not as "sticky" as it probably should have been, but then, I add 25% more flour. Still, the texture and crumb were perfect and they toasted up beautifully during the second bake. I added a sugar glaze (1 cup confectioners' sugar and 2 Tbsp. water) after they were done.

I love gingerbread.  Biscotti has not ever been a favorite but like well enough.  This recipe was very good but I wanted to explain why I didn't give it 5 stars.  First, I followed the recipe exactly.  The dough was very sticky and hard to manage.  I didn't read until later about not over stirring etc. etc.  Also, even after letting it cool it still was difficult to cut into 1/2 inch slices without it breaking.  Anyway, my opinion is that the recipe is good but the directions need to be altered to include some of the tips in it that would make it easier for a first time biscotti maker like myself to be more successful.

I followed the recipe exact and I think the oven temp is way too high as others have mentioned, My ends started getting really dark before the middles cooked.  Also when mixing the dough it never came to a nice smoothness, it was still very sticky, but I didn't want to add more flour and make them tough.  I will try again at a lower temp, hopefully it will be better, the taste and smell are great.

Fabulous!! I, too, reduced temp to 350, and added 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. baking soda. The flavor was perfect, no bitterness. I drizzled them with a simple vanilla glaze. These just taste like the holidays, and the whole house smelled wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe gets points for its uniqueness, but not for its flavor.  I followed the directions exactly, but they burnt around the edges and the taste seemed to permeate all the pieces.  The texture was very tough and cardboard like instead of crispy and light.  They did not look very attractive, but maybe adding stripes of white chocolate would help.  Kudos to those of you who can make this recipe work.  By the way, a tip for cutting biscotti: the sharper the angle of your diagonal cut, the longer the pieces will be.  You can snag the little rounded end pieces for yourself.

This was my first time making biscotti and I could not believe how easy it was! Everyone liked the amount of spiciness as it was written, but I would double it if I make them again just for myself. I dipped the flat bottoms in white almond bark and drizzled more on the top. They looked really beautiful and I will certainly make them again.

This is one of the five biscotti recipes I used this year at Christms.  People loved the gingerbread flavor, especially my husband and father.  A friend of mine from Germany was also delighted with the flavor.  I was unable to find whole wheat flour in my small town grocery store, so I used regular, but the cookies didn't suffer.  Next time I make these, I'll go a bit farther afield so I can make them as the recipe dictates.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My family absolutely loved these.  My daughter thought they were to spicy plain, however after I dipped them in white chocolate, she said they were the best she has ever had.  Great dipped in a good cup of coffee.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I added some minced fresh ginger to the wet ingredients before mixing.  They turned out perfectly.  I gave them out at our office cookie exchange and everybody seemed to love them.

I made this biscotti last night.  I liked the idea of gingerbread biscotti and decided to try it.  I'm happy I did.  I used canola oil instead and I used 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of 1 and then just 1 and 1/4 cup all-purpose flour.  I also added some finely chopped candied ginger.  These biscotti had a nice ginger flavour and the texture was great.  I did find that I had to increase the second baking time and I flipped the biscotti a few times to make sure they were done.

This is delicious!  I followed the suggestions of the others who mixed the dry ingredients together and then added the wet ingredients (including using butter instead of oil).  I also substituted fresh grated ginger (about 1/2 T) for the dry ground ginger.  This biscotti was very easy to make, and will be a regular treat during the holidays.  Thanks!

Fantastic recipe!  I've made this several time, several different ways, and it's almost impossible to mess up!  Since I'm a butter lover, I switched out the oil for butter and also switched out the eggs for 1/3 cup applesauce.  I left the rest of the recipe the same.  I did cut the cold butter into the dry ingredients as others had stated, and found the dough to come out just perfect and slightly crumbly.  The cookies came out perfect too!  Not too hard, and not soft.  Dipping them in white chocolate makes them the perfect snack and they compliment a cup of coffee wonderfully!

These are super yummy!! I followed firefly's suggestions of using butter and cutting it into all the dry ingredients and then adding the eggs and molasses.  If you live in a high altitude make sure you lessen the cooking time.  My first batch burned slightly on the edges and bottom.  The second batch I baked for 18 minutes, then 6 minutes on each side after slicing.  I drizzled with white chocolate that I added a little amaretto to.  SO GOOD!!

Never tried to make biscotti until I saw this recipe and it was easier than I'd anticipated. The taking out and putting back in the oven seemed strange at first but it makes sense - that's how it gets so damned hard! Went perfect with some coffee, hot chocolate... hell, even cold water! Plus, with the melted chocolate I put on top of them, they even looked sort of professional looking!

I can't believe how amazing these taste. I made a batch to send to my grandparents for Christmas and ended up eating quite a few of them. I loved them. I think next time I am going to throw in some fresh ginger too to kick up the spicyness. These biscotti go very well with a nice cup of hot chai tea also.

This recipe is perfect, just the way it is written. I bake lots of biscotti and have tried several recipes. I use oil in some of them with great results. This one is no exception. I decorated the biscotti with white chocolate laced with lemon flavoring. I may try a batch adding toasted almonds. Outstanding!

I made these today for Thanksgiving, and it will be a miracle if they last until then.  My husband and I both love them. My original intention had been to drizzle with white chocolate, but why mess with perfection?  My dough was very sticky, so I added a bit more flour, and I lowered the temperature to 350 degrees.  I didn't bother turning the cut biscotti.  Magnificent!!!

Temperature was too high.
Biscotti were dry and burned on edges.
Smelled good and flavor seemed right.
Needed less cooking or lower temperature.
I will try again with more shortening and all white flour.

I liked this recipe overall.  However, next time I will eliminate the whole wheat flour and use all white flour.  While I love to use whole wheat flour most of the time, I thought it competed with the gingerbread flavor.  This was also commented on by my friends.  The cookies were still very good and the cook times were dead on for me.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made a double batch of these biscotti as Christmas gifts for the office, and they were an absolute hit.  As suggested in other reviews, I drizzled the biscotti with melted white chocolate after the second baking, though they're quite good plain as well.  They could have been a bit more gingerbready, though, so I'll probably add a bit of vanilla extract, ground allspice and finely chopped candied ginger next time around.

Smelled good but it was doughy in the center.  I baked it twice which helped.  This was a very stick dough.  If you make it I would suggest making it in a low profile like one inch or less then it might cook through better.  I sprinkled it with 10x sugar.

This is a five plus!  I made several batches of these to give to my neighbors and they were very well received.  Perfect biscotti.  The only changes I made were to brush the loaves with an egg wash before baking and sprinkle on some red and green sugar.  I also did the second bake with the cookies standing up rather than flipping them.

These were quite good.  I only baked for 20 min - 25 would have been too long.  Also I only baked for 9 min the second time (didn't turn them and bake again).  They were the perfect firmness for me - could eat them without dunking but stayed together when dunked as well.  Nice flavour, very gingerbready.  Could use a sweet topping to finish them off - I think I'll try an icing on them (like gingerbread cookies).  Were a little hard to get all mixed together, but that could have been made more difficult due to the bowl size I used - recommend a nice wide large bowl so you can really get in there.

Nice spicy gingerbread flavor! It's definitely a good recipe to keep (will be splendid for the holidays!). I had substituted 1/2 the sugar with Splenda, replaced 1 of the eggs with egg substitute, and also added 1/4 tsp of all spice for a little extra punch. The flavor was good, could be a bit sweeter, and I definitely had to bake it about 10 to 15 minutes longer to make it crunchy and not too soft. Otherwise, it's delish!

Not good. Is the 1/2 tablespoon ground cloves a typo??? I have never put that amount in any recipe and it totally ruined the flavor of this biscotti.

Made as directed, the oven temp is too high or the cookie has to cook too long resulting in scorched ginger leading to a bitter cookie that did not completely dry out as biscotti should. If you make these maybe decrease oven temp to 325 or 350? Won't make again.

I also used 1/3 cup of salted butter instead of oil, and I cut it into the dry ingredients, minus the sugar, then mixed the sugar with the wet ingredients and added the wet and dry together. I was a bit skeptical of how crumbly the dough seemed, but just as many other reviewers have said, it firmed up significantly on baking. One thing I did to help with forming the loaves since it was so crumbly was put a sheet of parchment paper on the cookie sheet, then dumped half the mixture on and formed it into a loaf, then did the same with the other half and baked them on the parchment paper on the cookie sheet. I don't think I could have made loaves and then moved them onto the sheet, but doing it this way worked really well. I also baked them the first time for 30 minutes, which seemed to be just right, as they seemed too soft at 25 minutes. I made a confectioner's sugar glaze to drizzle, and am loving them!

These were pretty good.  I think they needed a little more of a spicey taste, I might increase the ginger next time and add some salt. Otherwise very good.  Do not use butter, a friend of mine who makes great Italian biscotti says you always use oil for a genuine biscotti. I drizzled they with a lemon glaze made from powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice and that really added a nice touch.

I loved this recipe!! I read a lot of the reviews and this is what I did.......  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the regular whole wheat.  I also threw in some finely chopped crystallized ginger.  I did lower the temperature to 350 for the initial baking and for the second baking - I did not lay the cookies down - I kept them standing up, separated and baked at 300 for 20-25 minutes.  I did not put the white chocolate on either - loved them exactly the way they were. I had no problems with the dough, maybe the pastry flour helped, not sure, but I cannot wait to make thee again!!

Absolutely delicious! I make biscotti for the holidays and this will definitely be added to my collection. The only thing I did different was use all white flour because I didn't have wheat and I added white chocolate chips.

Made as written except I added crystalized ginger cut up in tiny bits and a few turns of fresh ground pepper and I used Siagon Cinnamon. Really ramped up the spice level! This was my test run, will make again for upcoming guests and as gifts. I'd like to try it with butter sometime just to see the difference. This is as good or better than the Starbucks cookie. My husband who usually doesn't say much with my cooking experiments said this is a keeper.

I had few changes.  I had to use all white flour due to an allergy to whole wheat and not sure if the sub is actually 1:1 but that's what I did.  I didn't follow directions and made into one log due to the fact that I wanted long biscotti.  My own error was not baking longer because part of it was undercooked.  Not so bad when you have to bake two more times but it made it harder to cut without chunks coming out and still maintain a nice looking cookie but that was my error.  The reason for the 4 stars is because it needs more spices.  It was a pretty bland gingerbread and needed more of a kick.  Would make again with more spices.

I have a new favorite holiday cookie!  Firefly08's additional instructions were helpful, and I did dip in white chocolate as suggested by many.  Delightful changeup from the traditional gingerbread cookie!

Made these last year for xmas and I will definately make these again this year. Was nervous that it was my first time trying a biscotti recipe but followed the directions closely and they came out perfect! Dipped them in white chocolate and added crushed peppermint sticks, the presentation alone was divine. Very fun to play around with different designs with the chocolate. Added these to my bag of treats to hand out to loved ones along with "Oatmeal Chip" cookie recipe on this site by Nancy Fridirici, made them with holiday green and red m&ms, so good! THanks for the wonderful recipe!

I am not a fan of molasses or gingerbread, but after two years of a friend raving about these, I made them... and now I'm hooked!  They are amazing!  Definitely follow the changes Firefly 08 suggests.  Okay, I'm going to go and eat some more :)

After reading some reviews I used butter instead of vegetable oil and these came out PERFECT! They weren't too hard or too soft and had the right texture. These were delicious and had the perfect amount of spice for my taste. Though I had no white chocolate on me I'm sure it would be a great drizzle for it.

This is a nice textured biscotti.  I have made a lot of biscotti and this dough was definitely not stiff.  Indeed it was wetter than most biscotti dough.  I formed it into one log, making longer biscotti.  You could form it into two logs and get smaller biscotti.  I think the time in the recipe is set for one loaf.  I had no problem with baking time.  This has mild gingerbread flavor.  I prefer more spice!  I added 2 Tablespoons chopped candied ginger, used brown sugar instead of white and rounded the teaspoons on the spices - but for my taste, it was still quite mild.

I followed the modified recipe from Firefly08 and it turned out great! I added just a few drops of water to the dough as I worked it, which helped with the dryness. I added the lemon white chocolate drizzle as well, but the most significant change I made, which made these truly irresistible was I sprinkled a mix of sugar-in-the-raw and coarse sea salt on top of the dough before baking. Scrumptious!

I made this last year and it was a HUGE hit. I added just a little lemon flavoring to the almond bark and it made a huge difference. Not to mention, I probably spent only $20 to gift to 40 people!

This was my first try at making biscotti and I was very happy with the results. I think I over-kneaded them because my dough was rather crumbly and hard to form for me, but I will try another reviewers tip of oiling my hands before I make them again - and I will! It made the kitchen smell divine!

Amazing.  Even my picky eater loved these.  Great flavor.  We dipped ours in white chocolate, milk chocolate, and leftover icing from our gingerbread cookies.  Will be baking more and giving them away as small Christmas gifts.  Thank you.

mmm... Made these exactly like the recipe states with all the spices being heaping measurements since I do like a tasty biscotti. I appreciate recipes that call for oil since it is so much cheaper, and these were delicious regardless. And it sure is nice and crispy but not tough and crunchy. The dough wasn't hard to handle, but even easier when I added oil to my hands. I didn't have to cook them as long and maybe that is related to my elevation but it was only shorter by a minute or two. I have made these for a family Halloween dance and for a bake sale so I haven't dipped them yet in white chocolate like I plan to the day before. They are still amazing and can't wait to try them dipped.

I used 1 teaspoons of cloves rather than 1/2 Tablespoon, to avoid the strong clove taste that I don't enjoy. Otherwise, everything is perfect with this recipe and I had no problems with the dough as it had great texture.  I think it is important to avoid overmixing the dough.  I cooked the biscotti for the full seven minutes on each side for an incredible professional-like texture.  These were a winner in my house and will be including in my upcoming Christmas gift baskets.

Very good flavor, dunkability, texture to this striking biscotti.  I substituted oatmeal flour for the wheat flour. (just whiz quick oats in blender until powdered).  Used 1/3 cup molasses, and 2 eggs. Also substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar, and used 3/4 cup granulated white sugar.  Manifique' !!!

I make these every year and they're a HUGE hit.  Dipping in white chocolate is a must.  I've made it with various molasses, and I find Black Strap Molasses gives the best flavour.  Love this recipe!

I followed FireFly08's suggestions as I had never made biscotti before. Thank you FireFly08! Great suggestions! Mine turned out very well, although I made a few changes. I had a commercial pumpkin biscotti at my local coffee shop and wanted to make something similar without all the chemical preservatives. Instead of the molassas, I added canned, pureed pumpkin- just a smidge more than the 1/4 cup of molassas and I reduced the ginger a little bit. They were amazing!

These have more ginger in them than I like.  I followed the recipe exactly and the consistency of the dough was perfect.  I drizzled them with white chocolate when they were cooled and gave them as gifts.  Everyone loved them and the presentation gave the illusion of hours in the kitchen.

These cookies were all right.  A little hard and not very interesting.  I did dip some in white chocolate and some in dark chocolate with red and green sprinkles for the holiday.  I would not make these again.  There are lots of better biscotti recipes out there.

Let me first say, I always try a recipe as written first (get sick of people making up their own version and rating that).  This was terrific.  The whole family loved it.  Ok, so I didn change one thing... instead of veg. oil, I used light olive oil.  Ok, and for the oven temp. I set it at 360 (I was worried from other reviews about burning, and since I was making this as gifts, I wanted to make sure they I didn't screw it up).  And I did lay my "logs" on parchment paper.... other than that, followed all the ingredients to a "T" and it came out perfect.  I ended up making a second batch because they were so good I wanted some for myself.  The consistency was perfect and easy to work with.  The spices were spot on... make sure you're adding the correct amount.  At first I thought it said 1 1/2 teaspoon, but it was tablespoon... maybe that's where other people went wrong when they said it didn't have the spices that they wanted.   Anyway, I dipped in in white chocolate like in the photo and... it's a beautiful thing!  Very good.  Make them... and follow the recipe... it's good!

The consistency would have been perfect but, even being generous with the spices and adding black pepper, they were 100% bland and therefore, with the texture, tasted like dog biscuits. No one in my house would touch them after one bite.

Five star recipe!  I did make some adjustments, however - I used only white flour, no whole wheat.  I added a tsp. of baking soda and 1/2 tsp. salt, used 2 heaping tablespoons of ginger, and 1 1/2 tbsp cinnamon in addition to the usual cloves and nutmeg.  I also added some finally minced candied ginger - probably about 1/2 cup (I bought this at Trader Joe's).  After slicing and cooling the biscotti, I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes while I melted vanilla candy coating, then dipped the top side of each in that and placed on waxed paper to harden.   They are SO delicious.   Perfect for a holiday gift exchange.

I made this exactly as the recipe intructs.  It was very sticky.  I think these are delicious and I like the texture.  I am going to make myself another batch and try the black pepper recommendation.

I made 2 batches of these.  My second batch, I followed Firefly 08's directiosn on how to mix and they turned out much better as far as density - lighter and crumbly! Yum.  Excellent recipe.  I'm giving them as Christmas gifts to friends.

These are sooo yummy! As others, I substituted (same amount of melted)butter for oil and shortened the first baking time to 15 mins! Perfect! The lovely, spicy christmas smell in the whole house is a bonus!!!

soooo good!!! I dipped one side in traditional gingerbread cookie frosting of 1C powdered sugar and 2T milk. These made me look super fancy at the wives tea, instead of bringing the boring sugar cookies.

I altered a little as I didn't have wheat flour, I used all white.  These are easy to make and very tasty.  I did drizzle with lemon flavored white chocolate and the result was great.  Would recommend!!

Great flavour that lasts, unlike cakey moist gingerbread recipes...and this is key when doing holiday baking weeks in advance!! They pass the test, these will be going in mailers and gifts to family and friends :-) I followed the recipe exactly, lining sheets with parchment instead of greasing.

Made these for a Christmas Cookie Exchange...and they were a hit.  I split the dough into 3 logs so the cookies were a bit smaller but perfect for this type of event.  I dipped half of the cookie in white chocolate and sprinkled with red and green sprinkles.  Great display on the cookie table.  Everyone loved the thought of having a cookie that they could have in the morning instead of all cookies that are just for dessert.

These were okay. I don't particularly care for biscotti, but I thought I'd make a few to give as gifts. Waiting until their cooled to cut them is really the trick to making them look pretty. I cut the first batch when they were hot and it just didn't look as smooth. Also, the dough was pretty crumbly/sticky, but loosely wrapping it saran wrap while shaping it and rolling it (I used a rolling pin) makes it a whole lot easier to work with. I'll probably melt some white chocolate to drizzle over them.

This was by far the best, not to mention the easiest, recipe of the cookies I made yesterday. These turned out great. Drizzling or dipping in white chocolate is a must.

I've made biscotti before and understand that they are not sweet like a cookie, nevertheless there was hardly any sweetness to these biscotti,  The spice and molasses flavors were good.  The recipe says it will make a stiff dough.  Well that's an understatement.  I was afraid it was going to burn out my Kitchen Aid mixer and finished trying to get the dough together by hand.  I think there's far too much flour for the amount of liquid.  In addition, the whole wheat flour gave the finished biscotti the consistency of sawdust.

I loved the flavor of the biscotti and made a few changes.  I used butter instead of oil, used 3 1/4 cups white flour and omitted the whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup chopped crystallized ginger to the dry ingredients.  Everyone loved them and said the biscotti tasted like the ones from Starbucks.

These turned out well. They were not anything spectacular, but good nonetheless.  Instead of making then super hard like biscotti- since i knew i would be having people over with delecate teeth, I baked at 350 - like cookies- and didnt return them to the oven. The came out semoi soft like a cookie but not as hard as biscotti- I enjoythem them- and instead of baking it all at once, I rolled and shaped each one into a biscotti stick- I didnt want to bake the entire dough then cut- You can shape the dough into anything. I made candy canes-

I had trouble with this recipe. I made it once just as the recipe calls, but it turned into a puddle on the baking sheet (It did taste good though). I tried it again with 2 1/2 cups of flour, and it turned out great. I dipped them in melted white chocolate with a dash of amaretto and they taste great. I am planning on giving them as gifts for Christmas.

After reading many of the reviews, I made many of the recommended adaptations to this recipe. I also changed the spice ratio, and used both fresh and candied ginger instead of dried. The results were awesome, but it seems like I'm rating an altogether different recipe. So I submitted the new version to this site for people to try. Folks who had issues with this recipe can try another version.

These turned out really good!  I was afraid they'd be too spicy, but I took a chance and didn't reduce any of the spices, and I'm glad! The only change I made was to add about 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips, they went great with the spicy cookie. Mixed it all up in my Kitchen Aid and they were ready to eat in no time!  Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make it again!

Very good. I thought they were going to be too spicy but they weren't, they were great! Excellant with a cup of coffee. Didn't alter the recipe either. I did dust some with powder sugar, smeared the tops of others with white chocolate and left some plain. Nice change from chocolate and perfect for the winter holidays.

Wow!  What a wonderful and easy recipe.  I made these twice and both times they came out perfect.  I added a little extra ginger and cinnamon and that gave them alot of great gingerbread flavor.  I am sure they would be perfect without the extra.  They disappear in 2 days!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These were the perfect treat to have with coffee on a cold winter day.  It was a surprisingly easy recipe.  I did end up using 1/3 c. more flour to make the dough easier to handle and I used white, not whole wheat flour because that's all I had on-hand.  I dipped one side in white chocolate, which makes for a prettier presentation.  I received many compliments on these and plan to make them again.

YUMMY!  I made this recipe for gifts.  I dipped half of them in dark chocolate and half in white chocolate then added Christmas sprinkles.  I may add more ginger next time but then that is a personal preference.

Delicious!  I baked these for Christmas gifts and they were hard to give away.  The texture helped them travel perfectly.  I found the cooking times to be accurate for a crisp, traditional biscotti.

I thought that the dough was hard to work with.  Definitely grease the cookie sheets and your hands for shaping the dough.  It was very sticky!  However, the end product was quite tasty.  I also took previous reviewer's suggestion and coated one side with melted white chocolate chips.

I love this treat. I think it's great whether or not you bake it twice. I actually like it better slightly softer (by not baking twice). But either way, it received rave reviews when I served it.

Crispy, gingery and delicious. I was somewhat concerned with the large quantity of ginger in these, but turns out they're perfectly seasoned!

I personally don't know what the other reviewers are talking about (the ones who dissed this recipe).  These are dee-lish!!  I make them alll the time, and drizzle them with white chocolate.  They are to die for!!!   These are a  staple in my house.  In fact, I am having one right now with my tea!  :-)

Tried out this recipe for a cookie swap and wow!  I was impressed!   I've tried to make biscotti before, and they never came out quite right, but the texture and taste of these is absolutely perfect.  Not to mention the recipe is SO easy and quick to make!  Delicious with a cup of coffee.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Delicious biscotti that cut very easily and cleanly.  I got my biscotti about 9 inches long without cracking or crumbling.  The smell while they are baking is heavenly.  Wonderful for gifts. I'm going to make another batch of these soon.

a little boring.  I don't think I cooked mine long enough because they were not as crispy as other biscotti that I have tried.

I've made these every year for the past 4 years, and they are requested by friends and family regularly for Christmas gifts. I decrease the cloves to 1/2 teaspoon instead of tablespoon, and add some fresh ginger. Easy and delicious!

Bland. And that's after adding salt that wasn't even in the ingredient list. My daughter already said that she likes them so at least they won't go to waste.

This was surprisingly good. I did not have almond bark so I drizzled some AR's Gingerbread Frosting for Cookies. The dried frosting is more of an icing texture. It enhanced the biscotti perfectly. The biscotti was perfect as far as texture and flavor. I made the original recipe as is and was able to make about 2 dozen. Not sure how 4 dozen is possible unless you double the original servings. Either way, I will make again eapecially in December.

Yum, yum, YUM!! I followed the recipe exactly as written in regards to ingredients and mixing method. I only made one large log, though. 

I ended up baking the cut biscotti for about 9 minutes per side to get them perfectly crunchy! These are great without the white chocolate, but spectacular with it! Thanks for sharing!!

These should be called clove-ginger biscotti.  If you are not crazy about cloves, cut back on it.  It is pretty potent.  Love these with coffee, however.

This recipe was good but I think it could be better. I agree with many other reviews that it needed a little more flavor. Next time I make these I will increase the spices two fold and add an icing to it.

Absolutely delicious! Wow! Melted vanilla almond bark & dipped bottoms of biscotti's, then when cool, layed them on their side and drizzled one side as well. Absolutely gorgeous and they were gobbled up by the family. Also gifted a tin of them for Xmas & they were thoroughly loved.

Baked the biscotti yesterday, they turned out good, no fuss with preparation. Although I tweaked a bit, omitted molasses (molasses are not available in my country, and I had no honey). I used oil, and my experience with some excellent biscotti recipes from this site is good oil-wise. I like unblanched almonds and thus added 1 cup of those. Used brown sugar for ginger-bread appearance. Summarized, excellent recipe, works, tastes good... just do it

The taste was good, but the temp of 375 is way to high. It burned my first batch on the bottom. and I only left them in 17 minutes. Will remake the recipe again at 350 for 15 minutes like all the biscotti I make.

This recipe turned out well and I definitely would make it again. I feel like it could use a little something-something to make the flavors really come out, but I can't put my finger on what exactly it needs. I had no problems with the biscotti coming out too tough and I followed the recipe exactly. After they cooled I drizzled some gingerbread frosting (recipe found on this site) over top and it did help a bit with jazzing it up. I would even consider adding some dried fruit to this recipe.

very good.. I think the reason for using oil rather than butter is for food safe reasons. Biscotti is meant is to be long lasting & none refridgerated. 
Just a guess...not sure..but that makes sense to me.
Very tasty indeed..didn't change the recipe at all..they are sticky to shape due to the molasses. I just dusted my hands with flour to make it easier.

These turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly and loved the texture and flavor. Based on other reviews I debated using butter instead of oil, but in the end opted to go with the oil. I am glad I did. The crunch was perfect and the cookie didn't crumble away when dipped in coffee. The only thing I would do different next time is make one loaf instead of two. They came out like mini biscotti, I like them a bit bigger (I would have to play with cooking time though).

My daughter used this recipe for county fair and got a purple, she qualified for the state fair and got a purple at the state fair!  She followed the recipe exactly.  She baked it on a pampered chef baking stone and drizzled it with melted white chocolate.  Wonderful recipe Cristina, thanks for sharing it!

baked this for a friend, but the biscotti burned at the edges and i had to cut them off. added 1/4 tsp ground pepper, 1/4 tsp more nutmeg and 1/2 tsp salt, and it still was pretty bland. was not impressed, waste of my ingredients and time.

5 stars with these changes:  Use bread flour (not wheat or all purpose), add (in addition to oil) 1 softened stick of butter, add 2 level teaspoons of pepper, a little more cinnamon, (and don't be afraid of a little more of the other spices depending on what you favor).
The temperature was fine.  28 - 30 minutes initial cook, let cool completely, cut and recook 8 minutes, cool completely and even leave out to harden some more- then store.  *The pepper is needed to give it that spice you need.

Great flavour.  Added 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts.  Next time I will split dough into 3 logs to make smaller cookies - they really spread.

I substituted molasses with honey; the first bake took 19 min, and for the second I put them on a rack, so they only need 5 min once. Glazed with powdered sugar mixed with fresh orange juice. They came out spectacular, next time though, I might add an extra half tablespoon of ginger.

So easy!  My first time making Biscotti and this was easier then I thought.  I made a chocolate glaze.  3/4 cup icing sugar, 1-2tbsp water, 1tsp vanilla, 1Tbsp butter and 1 oz semmi-sweet chocolate(melted), butternilk to thin out enough to drizzled on top.  very good.

Wowie!  I loved this biscotti.  I made as the recipe stated with oil.  The explanation about Italians using oil instead of butter makes sense.  I also poured oil on my hands before forming the logs to keep the dough from sticking to me.  I drizzled the tops with a white chocolate glaze.  This will definitely be in my Christmas keepers.

I made this recipe but used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I used only about 2 teaspoons of ginger and it was still pretty ginger tasting in the end.  I recommend using less ginger. Also, the bake time of 25 minutes was too much- I recommend checking the oven around 20 minutes.  And I will DEFINITELY not have the Biscotti dry out in 6 minutes. one batch ended up burned.

Yummy...but not quite spicy enough. I'll add pepper next time like other reviewers suggested. Once I dipped in white chocolate it was VERY yummy of course. It would look prettier with a drizzle of white and milk chocolate. NOTE: the oven may need to be turned down to 350. It burned on the bottom before it was done then when I baked the second time it was already too brown to leave in for very long. It didn't turn out as crispy as I would have liked.

I think I over cooked my biscotti. When I put it in the oven the second time I felt like it wasn't crunchy so I cooked it about another 20 minutes and it was really hard. It does get crunchy when it sits out of the oven. So I will try again another time! The taste of the spices was very tasty!

I love gingerbread and I love biscotti crunch, so this is a match made in heaven!!! It was much easier to make than I feared (hey, biscotti sounds intimidating) and I love that the recipe already includes whole wheat flour. I used brown sugar instead of white+molasses, and added craisins for a festive bit of tangy chew. To make them extra gift-fancy, I smeared chocolate ganache on one side and drizzled w/ white chocolate. TOTAL KEEPER I will make this for stocking stuffers every year now! Thanks!!

I'm not sure what happened - maybe I left it in for too long, but my logs turned into a crumbled mess.  No biscotti for me :(  I put what I could salvage in a pie dish and melted chocolate chips on it.  I'm planning on serving it with ice cream.

Wonderful for the holidays!  I doubled the spices and added 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp salt.  Baked at 350 instead of 375 like someone suggested.  Drizzled with white chocolate.  They were the perfect spicy companion for coffee after Christmas shopping.

Great alternative to the extra sweet holiday cookies... I used olive oil instead, brown rice flour & whole wheat instead of any white flour.... splenda instead of sugar and I dipped 1/2 in white chocolate....overall a nice addition to my holiday baking collection

I am very critical of my own cooking and did not care for these when I first made them.  However, I love them now!  They have a nice crunch and a great spicy flavor!  I should have dipped in white chocolate, but ran out of time - still very lovely!  I will make again!

Very good Biscotti recipe.  Just about the same as my recipe except this one is a bit sweeter due to the added molasses.  The dough was sticky and a little hard to work with but with a little flour on my hands it was ok.  I followed the recipe exactly and drizzled with melted white chocolate.  I would make this again, but think the gingerbread theme is very seasonal so would probably make this during the holidays.

I made this recipe as is, following the instructions and was disappointed with the results.  The children didn't care for them much and normally they eat biscotti like it was going to be gone before they can get another piece.  I won't be using this recipe again.  But I want to repeat... I made the recipe like it's written.  I didn't try any of the suggestions from other readers.

This was so good! I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble with it at all.  Maybe I'll add a little more spice next time.

My dough was really crumbly, and it never quite came together.  I wonder if I didn't add enough butter?? I substituted butter for oil, equal parts.  Other than that and the addition of a bit more spice, I followed the recipe to the t! Delicious - just crumbly and dry.

This was very tasty !  I did make a minor change by using 6 Tablespoons of butter rather than the oil though.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes then after slicing I baked them again for 15 minutes.  Other than the buuter and baking times I changed nothing else.  Will certainly be making these again.  I did get out white chocolate to melt and drizzle over them but after tasting them I felt they were delicious as is so I put the chocolate back in the cupboard. Thank you very much for the recipe.

This was the first time I had made Biscotti. It turned out great! I used white flour only because I had no whole wheat flour at the time. Used my Pampered Chef baking stone. Perfect!
Great recipe!

Fantastic!  I followed Firefly's advice for mixing the dough, and these came out perfect.  After the initial baking, I toasted each side for 10 minutes to make them extra crispy.

These were a huge hit with my family. I didn't have whole wheat flour so I used all white flour (about 4 cups), and they were still great. Will definately make again!

I have been baking various kinds of biscotti for years and I have to say that this was one of the best doughs I've worked with.  They baked up beautifully and the house smelled wonderful while they were in the oven.  They also slice very easily without breaking.  I increased the amount of spices just slightly to make it spicier and am going to finish them by dipping the ends in white chocolate and adding holiday colored sprinkles.

I made mine just like Raphaella wrote in her review.  I think butter is the way to go instead of oil.  Also, adding the eggs and molasses last to bring it all together...  Try the lemon-flavored almond bark, that makes it extra yummy!  However, if you're planning on keeping the biscotti for more than a week, you should know that dipping the biscotti in almond bark causes that part of the cookie to soften a little.

These biscotti are delicious as is. But if you really want a treat, add chocolate chips to the batter. You just turned something delectable into fabulous! These are a real favorite with all our family.

Very good biscotti recipe. I liked the texture of the cookies, but I might try them using just the AP flour for the whole flour amount just to see the difference.  I dipped half the cookie in white chocolate to spruce up the presentation.  I might even try adding some chopped up macadamia nuts to the batter next time!  Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

I made these for a family get together recently. I'd never made biscotti before so it's safe to say that I didn't really know what I was doing.Everyone agreed that these were absolutely delicious. I'm not a big fan of gingerbread and disliked the strong bite, but everyone else said the flavor was perfect. I will be making these for them again.

Fantastic!  These came out perfectly.  The taste was great & unique enough for people to get excited about biscotti.  I brought this to a party with a homemade lemon dip (same recipe as lemon pie filling--I just didn't let it get as stiff as that so that it was easier to dip into).  People asked to take the leftovers and also for the recipe.

Just finished make this recipe for the first time.  Followed other's advice and used butter in place of oil.  Had no trouble with mixing the dough. I made two logs and baked on pampered chef stone.  Turned out great.  I dipped the ends in melted white chocolate.  Waiting for the chocolate to harded right now before taste testing but the pieces I tried without the chocolate tasted really good.  Thanks for sharing:)

This recipe is fantastic!  The only changes I made were to use butter and follow the derections of a pp about cutting the butter into dry ingredients then mixing the wet ingredients in.  I kneaded the dough for about 5 minutes straight before it was the right constistency (it seemed VERY dry at first but just right after kneading).  The other change I made was to add a bit of vanilla to the wet ingredients, I just like vanilla.  After forming the logs on the stoneware I pressed sugar into the tops.  The biscotti came out tasting and looking great.  I'm using it for gifts.

Mine turned out okay.  I know biscotti should be dry, but mine was not a good dry...too floury when eating it...???  I just sprinkled turbinado sugar on the top - it looks and smells beautiful.  I guess when I dip it in coffee, it's better.

Not bad. If I were to make it again, I would probably cut back on the flour a bit to make the dough easier to work with. It was a bit too crumbly according to the recipe. Also, the gingerbread taste was a bit subtle. I might try increasing the amounts of the different spices next time too.

Great! Very easy and tasted wonderful! I also drizzled white chocolate on them...so attractive. I froze them to serve over the holidays, if they last that long. May have to make more! I might only suggest a little bit more of the cinnamom and spices.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe! The texture is lovely and the molasses flavor is perfect--just assertive enough, and not overpowering. I modified slightly per personal taste by omitting the nutmeg and cloves and sprinkling with cinnamon sugar before baking. A keeper!

I would've given it 5 stars, but I changed the oil to butter as others suggested. They were delicious! I had to bake mine, once sliced, more than the recommended time to get them crispy enough. I didn't have ground cloves, just whole, so I tried to grind them in the coffee grinder and didn't have quite enough. But still very good! I also followed the suggestions of others by mixing all dry ing. first and then adding the wet. I did have to knead mine quite a bit to get it cohesive. Rolled in raw sugar. Will make again:)

Great recipe! Co-workers enjoy these biscotti. I dipped half of them half-way in white melted chocolate and then sprinkled red,white, and green non-perils on them. They looked very festive. Made recipe as stated and was not over powered by the spices. Thanks!

So good.  I've made it many times for my kids who eat it like candy.  Could probably back off some on the ginger.

This recipe is wonderful!  My biscotti turned out perfectly and everyone loved them.  The gingerbread spices were not too overpowering and paired perfectly with a cup of coffee.  Also, very simple.  If you can make a batch of cookie, you can make this recipe.

This recipe tasted great, and was a major hit. However, the texture was off each time I made it. The first time was slightly underbaked, causing the cookies to hold together better without being as crisp. The second time, when they were fully cooked, they were fairly crumbly, but still good for dipping. Definitely a recipe that I'll try again, though!

I'm not confident in my cooking abilities, but these turned out so wonderfully that I ended up three batches for different Christmas parties.
I didn't toast them as much, and every one appreciated biscotti that wasn't dry and crunchy.

This turned out great for me.  It's a bit softer than most biscotti because of the molasses, but we really liked it.  Others who tasted it are asking me for the recipe.

I added some dried cranberries to the mix before baking these, and it was a nice addition.

Everything they say is true!  These are the best.  I made around 200 last week for various cookie trays and plates (and personal edification).  I did put the white chocolate on one side, and on some, I put the melted chocolate in a piping bag and wrote "HO HO HO" on the sides, very cute!  Just delicious, making more tonight for Santa!

We enjoy Biscotti so I thought I'd try this recipe. I sprayed the cookie sheets..glad I did. I was hoping for the taste of sweitzel's gingersnap cookies...but the flavor was a little lacking... I even put in more ginger and other spices. I'll see how they taste in a day or so...

Back with the next day's report, they had a nice strong ginger taste...definite dunkers. If you want them a little softer, don't bake them laying on their sides.

These were delicious!  I had never made biscotti before, so I decided to give it a try-they were easy and turned out very well.  I topped them off with white chocolate and enjoyed the cookies with a cup of coffee.  I'll definately be making these again. :)

These were super easy to make.  I made them as if I were making pasta with the well method and my bare hands.  I did make them with a wooden spoon the first time, but it didn't come together very well, when I attempted to shape them.  Everyone so far has requested these as a Christmas gift or has requested the recipe.  Just Fabulous!!!!

The flavor of these biscotti is very good and true to gingerbread, It made the whole house smell like the holidays! I happen to like my biscotti in the Italian tradition-meaning I prefer them to be more crunchy and these were rather soft for my taste, even after elongating the sencond baking time.

These are fantastic! I used a blend of oil and butter. That seemed to work best for me. I feel like the oil vs butter choice is more personal than anything. These were super delicious and a wonderful way to begin every morning of my staycation.

I have made 100's of recipes of cookies/cakes/desserts.
This has to be one of the worst recipes I have ever come across.
Dough was beyond sticky. Way, way too much ginger and this recipe does NOT make two cookie 'loaves'.
Add 1/2c more flour if you want to make this easier.
or, just don't make it.

Yum, yum, these are soooooo good!  Made per the recipe except took the suggestion of a reviewer who said she added 1/4 t baking soda and about that much salt. Oh, and I added about 1/4 t cayenne pepper! I noticed that several reviewers dipped or drizzled white chocolate, but since I didn't have any, I made a glaze of powdered sugar and the last of my maple syrup, with a dash of salt.  The finished biscotti looked so elegant! And really, it was an easy recipe.  Thanks for posting it!!!

Great biscotti, but I knew before making that it could do with a bit of a kick, so I did add a half cup of chopped crystallized ginger, a couple of TBSPs chopped fresh ginger, and about an 1/8 tsp pepper.
Doesn't need any kind of icing/drizzle - great as is!

I've been making biscotti (from my own recipe) for years. I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try someone elses recipe, and gingerbread biscotti sounded like fun. Here's my take on the recipe.

INGREDIENTS

1) Use whatever flour you have available, it doesn't impact the taste all that much. I used 2 3/4c unbleached white and 1c oat flour.
2) Oil vs butter is a matter of taste. But if you're using a salted butter, drop the added salt a bit to compensate.
3) The dough should properly be described as sticky, not stiff. You'll need up to 1/2c more flour to get it to hold together, and more for your hands to pat it into shape.
4) Needs 1/2-1t salt. Without salt, the flavors don't pop and there's no contrast.
5) I cook with sorghum rather than with molasses. 1:1, just changes the taste a little.
6) It may sound like a lot of spice, but the amounts listed don't overwhelm the cookie. Don't worry about exactness, and don't bother calculating what 1 1/2 T is. Just eyeball it. You'll never taste the difference.
7) I added 1t of ground black pepper (Tellicherry, FWIW). Black pepper is underused in baking IMHO.

TEMP & TIMING

8) The temperature listed is way too hot. Preheat your oven to 325°, bake the loaves for the same 25 minutes, then let cool. 
9) Slice the loaves, put the slices back into the oven for 10 minutes per side at the same 325°. Stand them up on the baking pans to cool and dry.

Would I make this recipe again? No. The tast

very easy to make, I want to also mess with the time and maybe a shorter time to make these the very slightest chewy in the center!  But a success overall!  (also, I doubled the spice ingredients, I think they are too bland if using the recipe recommended)

I have to wonder if the spice measurements were correct, as some of them were listed in tablespoons.   Half a tablespoon or 3/4 tablespoon seems awkward.  Did they mean teaspoons?  Anyway, I made these with a gluten free flour blend, sub cup for cup, but added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of xanthan gum to help cohesion.  I subbed gluten free oats for the whole wheat flour.  Dough was extremely sticky, even after adding extra flour.  I cut the slices thicker, about 3/4", to avoid crumbling.  On the second baking, I had to do at least ten minutes per side.  Flavor was good, but very heavy on cloves.  Half a tablespoon of cloves is too much.  I made a simple glaze of lemon juice and confectioners sugar to finish them.

First time I’ve ever made biscotti, this is an uncomplicated and delicious recipe.  Though I did use coconut oil in place of vegetable oil.  They came out beautifully and taste better than store bought!

Made as written using fresh grated nutmeg. Left off the drizzle/glaze partly  because I like a plain biscotti and partly because I'm lazy. Give them out at a work cookie exchange where they received rave reviews; one woman ate all at her desk before going home :)

Well,  I would use 1/2 cup of butter instead of vegetable oil and much more spice, I like the idea of adding black pepper.
This biscotti turned out extremely hard, dried out and over cooked!
The cooking time should be 20-25 min on 350* "not 40 min"!
I looked at several other biscotti recipes and lower  temp and shorter times are recommended.

These were great. It is my second try at biscotti. The first one was pistachio and cranberries and it seem very labourious.
But that was because I hadn't made them before. This time with the experience behind me it was so much easier and I wasn't so nervous about doing the wrong thing. I chose to follow Baricat's advice (Thanks Baricat!) for ingredients and baking. I agree no butter just oil. When they finally came out of the oven they looked like an ad for biscotti! I am so proud of myself and they are delicious!

Only suggestion I can make is to read the other suggestions. Quite bland as the gingerbread taste goes, will use the recipe again adding an extra teaspoon of ground clove and perhaps allspice. 
This was my first go round for this recipe.

These are perfect, lots of spice, I even add a bit of black pepper.  The dough is sticky, it's supposed to be, don't over handle.

As is maybe a 3 star. We will keep this but use regular flour instead of whole wheat. Also we did use 1/2 tsp cloves per reviews since we didn't want a real strong clove flavor. When buying the molasses they only had one kind & it wasn't what I usually use.  This bottle wasn't as strong of a molasses flavor as we like.  Once I can use up this bottle on something I'll get my regular molasses for the next time we make.

I made this recipe using Firefly08's tips on using butter instead of oil and cutting it into the dry ingredients and the biscotti turned out perfectly!  We love this recipe and will now make it a holiday mainstay. Perfect to give as gifts to good neighbors ;)

This recipe is wonderful! I, too, used butter instead of oil, and followed another reviewer's suggestion to add black pepper to the mixture ~ The results were outstanding! The biscotti is not too sweet, and has a bold, flavorful kick. The best tip I've heard so far & can attest to is to not over-mix the dough. Opt to mix by hand instead of using a mixer :)

I had a really hard time deciding between 3 or 4 stars.  I made these exactly as stated, my biggest complaint is that the taste was good but too subtle.  Maybe my spices are too old?

in a word.. YUM !!
used all white flour - as I can't 'do' whole wheat..
drizzled very lemony icing over top then sprinkled icing sugar over that..
I make biscotti quite often -- this recipe will be right up there with my all time favorites..
thanks Cristina..

This recipe is great! My dough had nowhere near enough moisture (thanks high altitude Alberta) so I added about 2/3 cup water gradually until I could work the dough. I also followed the recommendation to mix the dry ingredients together, cut in the butter and then add the eggs and molasses. They were a hit!

Wonderful! This was my first attempt ever at making biscotti.. I've always been intimated by it, and I'm not sure why. I didn't change a thing although I thought the measurements were too much at first. After tasting they are great.. If you like Gingerbread you will like these! If the clone is too much for some people just cut back and add more ginger. I wouldn't change a thing though! This was just a trial run, and I want to make some for Christmas gifts this year. Will definitely dip and drizzle with white chocolate and maybe some festive sprinkles. Thanks for this recipe :)

Great biscottis!!  Normally ale almond but tried this for Christmas. Instead of oil I softened about 6 tablespoons butter. I normally use butter in ally recipes and used white flour. Drizzled powder sugar icing. Awesome.

Like other reviewers, I added 1/4 t. each salt and pepper, and 1/2 t.  baking soda. I upped the spices, added cardamom (just because I like it) used all AP flour and went 1/2 and 1/2 brown sugar and white sugar. Then I folded in 1/3 c. finely chopped candied ginger. Handled the dough as little as possible, dividing it in half early in the mixing and adding 1/3 c.  raisins to one half, because DH is a raisin freak. Raisins work, but are not needed, and they make slicing more challenging. Result is pretty, sliced well, and has a decent level of spiciness. Still, mine is not as crispy as other reviewers thought, and I need to up the spices still more - mostly black pepper, I think, and some fresh grated ginger, too. Dough was dry enough to handle that much extra moisture.

I followed what another viewer mentioned about cutting in butter vs using oil. Especially since I don't know anything about making biscotti. This is really nice biscotti. I'm surprised with all the spices in it that its not more spicey. Maybe tomorrow after sitting overnight it will be.

These are fantastic! I halved the amount of ginger because I didn't want them too strong for the non ginger eating daughter. Just delicious and so pretty drizzled with white chocolate! Good enough for a cookie exchange this weekend :)

These went over really well at a fall-themed dessert night. I dipped mine in white chocolate chips.

These biscotti were really great. I dipped half the cookies with milk chocolate, and half the cookies I dabbed the end in white chocolate.

I tried a test batch of these for my xmas gift boxes.  I think they're a winner.  I made them as the recipe called except for adding a little more flour until it came together in my mixer.  I also needed to cook them longer than specified.  The taste was gingery, but not overwhelming.  Be sure to wet your hands while forming the logs, it solves the sticking problem.  I'll be drinking hot tea tonight with my first successful batch of biscotti.

This was my first attempt at making biscotti, so I can’t compare it to other biscotti recipes.  I was pleased to see how easy they were to make and I love them with coffee.

Oh my gosh this is wonderful.  I did add about another 1/4c flour to kneed with but otherwise followed it exactly.  I made these for Thanksgiving party favors. My guests loved them, they are awesome dunked in coffee.  These are my new holiday biscotti.

I started out following the recipe exactly, but it was super wet/sticky and did'nt form a dough.  I had to add an extra cup of ap flour, knead it a little, and use a 1/4 cup MORE flour (for each "log")on my hands and to coat it just to form the dough on the cookie sheet.

This one is a keeper! Even my 1 year old loved it! I piped on some glaze (icing sugar and water), which added the perfect little punch of sweetness.
