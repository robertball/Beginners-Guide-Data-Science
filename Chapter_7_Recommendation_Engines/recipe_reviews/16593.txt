Well, after reading all the reviews for this recipe, I decided to try this one for my first attempt at a roast...and it was well worth it! I did make a few changes...used a sirloin roast, used a oven bag instead of foil, used a spice rub for the meat, used 2 cans of soup, and spiked the soup/onion mix with a few healthy doses of Worcester sauce...threw in a few redskinned potatoes quartered, a couple small onions...baked at 325 for the full 4 hours, and it was a HUGE HIT! The meat was so tender, juicy and flavorful...and the gravy was out of this world, use 2 cans soup for extra gravy, you wont be sorry! 
Thanks for a great recipe Lynn!

This is EXCELLENT! I made some changes, though. Since I had a meeting and wouldn't be home at dinner time, I needed to make a meal in one...I used an oven bag inside a 9 X 13" pan, coated with 1 TBSP of flour. I set the roast inside the bag and topped it with about 1/4 cup of Lea & Perrins steak sauce. I mixed 2 cans of mushroom soup (instead of 1) with the dry onion soup mix and spooned and patted it over the roast. I then set 6 peeled and 1/4-ed potatoes and many baby carrots around the roast. I closed up the bag, following instructions included with bags. I baked it at 325 degrees for 2 3/4 hours. The vegies were perfect and the meat was tender. The gravy was AWESOME! My family LOVED it and I enjoyed it VERY MUCH, even though I had to eat it reheated! Thanks, Lynn, for a GREAT recipe to build on!

Oh, boy, was this good!  It was also very, very easy to prepare.  
My husband loved it, and I ate the left overs for three days while
he was out of town.  I added sweet onions, potatoes, and carrots 
around the roast, inside of the foil, and also doubled the gravy
recipe, as others recommended.  Also, I did not cook it as long as 
was recommended, only until a meat thermometer registered an appropriate
temperature for medium rare beef.  It came out very tender!  
My foil was apparently not tight
enough to hold all of the juices in, but it ended up being a good
thing, as the thinner juices that ran out were a perfect complement
to the beef (almost like 'au jus'), while we thought the thicker 
gravy was excellent to pour over the veggies.  This is a DEFINITE
keeper, and I can't wait to make it again!

Yum! My husband told me I can make this every Sunday! Only one thing I would note though - don't make the mistake of salting the meat. With the salt in the soup mix, you definitely won't need it.

To make this a 5 star recipe, use 2 cans of soup, add a 1/2 tablespoon of horseradish, a splash of worcester sauce, and a tablespoon of steak sauce to the mix. Follow the rest as indicated. Wow!

This was really good.  I did not put it in the foil pack like the directions say, instead I just put it in my 9X13 pan and covered tightly with foil.  I threw in pearl onions, carrots and mushrooms. I added about 3/4 of red wine to the soup mixture.  I got lots of gravy, it was a bit thin, but thickened with some corn starch.  I baked it for about 2 1/2 hours, it was very very tender.

If I could give the recipe more than 5 stars I would.  It is perfect.  I have been looking for a good roast recipe for a while.  My 7 year old gobbled this up and my husband said it was the best roast he ever had. I highly recommend this recipe, you will not regret it.

I tried changing it up a bit by using cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup.  We have been trying to find a pot roast recipe that we all loved and this is the first!  Delicious and easy!  I have also used this recipe to make a pork roast, but used cream of chicken and mushroom soup and herb dry soup mix.  Only note for making it with pork is I would recommend using a low sodium soup because it can be rather salty.

This was a fantastic roast!  I added two cans of mushroom soup and some red wine to the mixture so there was plenty of gravy.  Also, I cut a hole in the top of the round and put in a clove of garlic so it would flavor the meat.  Tasty!

This was the very first pot roast I ever made. I remember calling a friend and she suggested I braise the roast before adding it to the roasting pan and using red wine instead of water. This is a go-to comfort food for me now--it always varies how I make it but the base ingredients are always there. Mashed potatoes are a must have with this roast.

I wish I had this recipe when I was a "blushing bride" nine years ago.  I have never had much luck with pot roasts until I tried this recipe.  Even my children had seconds and hubby said "wrap up the leftovers, they will make a great sandwich later."  This is one I will definitely cook again. Thanks!
------------------------------------------------
I have been making this recipes for years and it has never failed me.  It is the only roast recipe that I have ever had any success with!  We just had it for dinner again tonight and there is not a scrap left! 5/17/2010

This turned out really well! I made this last night for my parents, boyfriend, and two dinner guests and they all liked it. My boyfriend, who doesn't like pot roast, actually enjoyed it and said it was better than what he's had in the past. It came out moist and tender. I used an extra can of soup, a little red wine, and some worcestershire sauce to the soup mixture, and also added some garlic cloves, mushrooms and onions to the foil packet. Served this with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli. SO GOOD!

Used a chuck roast--because that's what was on sale!  And added 2 Tablespoons steak sauce and 2 T. Worcestershire and dotted with butter (smart balance blend).  Sealed in foil-as recipe states-very tightly.  (Cooks, you have got to quit cooking in those deathly plastic bags--cancer, cancer; I wouldn't dare.)  Anyway, the roast came out great very flavorful, delicious, and moist, and most of all it was simple.

The PERFECT roast!  What we did was to brown a completly frozen 3.5 LB. roast top and bottom in a little olive oil.  Place carrots, celery, onions and potato chunks in with the browned roast in the foil.  Tripple wrap it in foil and bake for the specified time.  Perfect every time, we love it and it could not be more simple, starting with a frozen roast straight from our freezer.  Thanks!!

i made this for sunday dinner. i used a chuck roast ( it was on sale), i used a 15oz can of  beef broth for the water and 2 cans of cream o' mushroom with the onion soup packet.  i sliced 2 cloves of garlic and make slits in the meat and poked it in then splashed some worchester sauce over it.  i mixed the liquids and poured it over the whole thing then scattered a sliced onion over all.  i covered the whole thing with foil and it was delicious!  the meat was fall apart tender.  great recipe even with my slight modifications.  this is my only way to cook pot roast from now on.

This was delicious and easy!  I followed the recipe exactly except I ended up buying the wrong cut of beef (I don't know all about cuts of meat and ended up getting a rump roast of some sort), but it turned out great anyway.  Definitely how I'll prepare this from now on, next time I'll probably add some carrots and potatoes to the little foil pouch.  Oh and speaking of foil, I did what some others did and first lined the pan itself in foil just in case there was overflow, and there was.  But the extra foil kept the pan nice and clean!  Thanks, Lynn!

Simply delicious!! Except mine was overdone.....should have checked it with a meat thermometer.  Cooked a 2.87 pound bottom round for 3 1/2 hours, turned off the oven and let it rest in the oven for another 15 min.  The flavor was delicious and made the " gravy" exactly as written.  Will definitely make again!

This is the most simple, yet perfect roast I have ever made.  Also - because it's so simple, it's easy to memorize and therefore a great main course to throw together.  The gravy that it "made" was also delicious!  I served it with mashed potatoes (cooked seperately) and carrots in a butter sauce! 
EXCELLENT!

This is so simple and gratifying.  I highly recommend doubling the soup mixtures and adding potatoes and onions.  Make sure to seal the foil!  The second time I made it I used a larger casserole and wasn't as careful about folding the foil.  Alot of the gravy leaked out and burned on the bottom of the pan.  Sadly the overall flavor was affected.

I have been married for almost 1 year and I wanted to try mu luck at my very first roast.  I saw this one and was a little iffy when I saw the ingredients, but decided to give it a shot.  My husband loves it!!!!  He asked me when he was finished eating if we could have it again tomorrow night lol.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with this new bride, with very little cooking experience.

This is the best use of bottom round I've ever tried.  I used 2 cans of soup as suggested, but didn't make any other changes.  The meat came out perfect and I overate.  Will make this again and again.

Wonderful recipe!!  I added carrots, onions and potatoes before sealing foil.  It's important to put meat and soup on bottom of pan and put veggies on top of meat so the meat is able to sit in the soup sauce...this is key.  I've made it 3 times so far, twice for my family and once for a friend who just had a baby...rave reviews from all.  I told another friend about it and the next day she had to call and say they just finished it and wanted to thank me for the recipe AND for turning her on to allrecipes.com.  She used lowfat cream of mushroom soup and still said it was great!!

I've been cooking for over 40 years and I've done my share of pot roasts. But I will be doing it this way from now on. Melt in your mouth tender and the flavor...phenomenal.

This is such a great, easy recipe! The only changes I made were that I did my roast in the slow cooker, and added potatoes to the bottom. It turned out so tender and delicious. Will definitely make again and again!

This was very good.  However, I did have to make some alterations because I didn't have the onion soup mix.  I used 1/2 packet of dried italian dressing packet and 1/2 packet of brown gravy mix.  My husband LOVED it the altered way!  I will try the recipe next time with the soup mix to see if he likes it any better.

Yum!  I thought the gravy might be a little strange, but it was delicious.  It was nice not to have to actually make the gravy since it was already done.  I didn't change anything in the recipe.  Both of my little girls loved it and we're keeping this one.

This recipe is very easy!  The only problem was the cooking time was too long, and it came out somewhat dry.  Next time, I'll only cook it for 3 hours at the most.

I've been using this recipe since I made my first roast--probably almost 8 years ago. It is always a hit. Even my mother now makes it this way. It's just too easy and tastes too good to make it any more complicated. I started out making it just like it says, although I now usually add a dash of worcestershire or wine. I have also made it in a crockpot with good results--although all day cooking is not necessary with that method and time depends on the roast size. To extend time, you can start with a frozen roast. Served with veggies, and mashed potatoes or oven fries, this is an excellent staple recipe for any family.

This turned out delicious! I did however follow the advice to use 2 cans of soup. I also added 1/4 c. Worcestershire,  1/4 c. water, & 8oz carton of beef stock and bombarded it with baby carrots, quartered potatoes and quartered onions. I love using oven bags, so I can guarantee my meat to be moist and also so I can control the drippings easier. I cooked it for the full 4 hrs. I bought a cheap 2.17 lb. sirloin tip, and it was really moist and delish! Everyone loved it and quickly scarfed it down. Did a little personal tweaking, but for the most part this recipe was a real keeper!

This meal was super easy and tasted "just like my mom's pot roast."  The gravy made itself in the tin foil; all I had to do was make the mashed potatoes.

Excellent recipe! Juicy and delicious. I browned the roast first in olive oil and red wine vinegar for about 10 minutes. I increased oven temperature to 325 and it took about 2.5 hours for a 2.8lb roast.  After 1 hour, I added baby yukon gold potatoes and baby carrots around the roast (after dipping in vegetable oil) and they came out perfect.  Easy recipe that I'll definitely make again.

Meat turned out great. I covered the pan with foil instead of wrapping the meat in foil. Even my husband, who doesn't usually like pot roast, had seconds!

As good as promised. I browned the meat in butter over high heat first and just covered the pan (instead of wrapping the meat in foli). 3 people devoured it all - no leftovers.  Delicious.

My husband and I made this for the family today and it turned out great! I doubled the portion for mushroom soup and the gravy turned out just enough. Added potatoes, carrots and mushrooms to the gravy. Chopped up 1 1/2 onions, crushed like the whole garlic to mix in the gravy too. Will definitely make this again, it's easy, convenient and tasty! My 1st time cooking beef and it is now a family's fav! Thank you so much for the recipe!

My family loved this recipe. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and put some potatoes and carrots around the meat. I thought it might be too salty so I used low sodium, low fat cream of mushroom soup. It was really great!

This is the best!!! I have been looking for an easy, tasty, moist roast and I struck gold on the first try!! I added 3 tsp. of garlic powder to the roast as a quick rub and seared the roast with a bit of olive oil  before cooking. I also added an extra half can of mushroom soup and followed other suggestions of doubling up on the foil and no juices/gravy leaked out. My husband follows a low-carb diet and this fitted great within his restrictions (an added bonus!!) I suggest that everyone tries this!! Goes great with mashed potatoes (much to hubby's envy)! Thank you so much for sharing Lynn!!

I had never made pot roast in the oven, so I wanted to try this recipe.  I have made almost this same recipe in the crock pot, and prefer it that way.  The only difference with the crock pot, is to increase the water to 1/2 cup and cook on low 8 hours, or high 4 hours.  The gravy is thicker in the crock pot and is all contained, rather than all over.  I will make it this in the oven on a cold winter day to warm up the house though.

This pot roast was fantastic.  I cooked it with carrots, potatoes, onions, and a little bit of garlic and it came out fantastic.  The soup made a great gravy and I was a little worried that it wouldn't be enough to cover it, but it turned out perfect.  The mushroom flavor in the soup wasn't overpowering so even my husband who hates mushrooms ate it!  My roast was also a little bigger than what was called for but it worked out just fine.  Very easy for anyone who doesn't have a slow cooker and wants a great roast!

This roast was very good, and really tender.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can cream of celery (didn't have another can of mushroom).  My husband and 4 year old son loved it.  This is the best roast recipe that I have tried.

This was fabulous!  I doubled the mushroom soup and added two Tbsps of water, so I had lots of yummy gravy for the meat, as well as the potatoes, carrots and videlias I cooked along with it in foil.  I used a couple of cloves of garlic too...it was great.  Even my husband, who isn't a big fan of pot roast, loved it!!!

This is comfort food at its best.  Mashed potatoes are obligatory with this since it makes a terrific gravy.  My husband raved about it and the leftovers were just as tender warmed up.  Any new bride is sure to impress the in-laws with this.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks Lynn

I have been making this for years.   It is a great way to fix a roast!!  My changes are:  I make a few slits in the roast and insert garlic clove halves.  I use low sodium soup and I use one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery soup.  And I add a little Worchestershire sauce, maybe a tablespoon.  The best thing is, I use my crock pot!!  So I put it in the crock pot in the morning and dinner is ready by evening.  You can also use the same recipe but instead of a roast, use stew meat.  Serve on buttered poppy seed noodles or rice.  YUM!!!

This recipe was passed down from mom many years ago.  I always double the gravy, adding a bit more water and throw it in the crock pot.  Sometimes I put baby carrots and quartered potatoes in the bottom, while other times I omit the potatoes and make mashed for that wonderful gravy.  I takes about 7 hours on high but it's great to do it in the morning and know you are going to have a fantastic meal that evening!

Awesome! I substitute the onion soup mix with 2 tbsp. onion powder, salt, and pepper. Potatoes, carrots, and onions taste great when added an hour or two before it's all ready. Five stars for needing only a few ingredients and the no-brainer technique! Thank you for the recipe!

Pretty good... It made lots of gravy. We served it with egg noodles. We did over cook the meat a little. Watch your cooking times!!!!

oh this recipe for pot roast is so easy and yummy. The instruction is easy. The only thing I added was a 1/4 can of water into the condense soup and onion soup mix to have extra gravy. The meat was so tender. I will definitely make it again. My family really enjoyed it.

Next time I would pour the sauce over the roast every hour to keep it moist.  First time making a roast and it was incredible. Added red potatoes and baby carrots and onion for the entire time.  Cooked beautifully and not too mushy.

AWESOME!! I added pearl onions, potatoes, and carrots to the roast - yummy. I am not a fan of mushroom soup, so I changed it to cream of chicken soup. We all LOVED it.

This is a bit different from slow cooked pot roast...the flavor is really in the gravy, not the meat itself, but it was really tasty and so easy! I used two cans of mushroom soup.  This gave me plenty of gravy for leftovers as well...the next night I shredded the pot roast and warmed it up in a pan with the leftover gravy to serve over egg noodles.  I also took reviewers' suggestions to brown the meat first, use an oven bag, shorten the cooking time to avoid a tough roast, and added the vegetables.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Ok so I didn't follow the recipe exactly...  I decided my husband after many weeks of eating recipes made for toddlers (who only like things smothered in cheese or on bread if you get my drift...LOL)deserved something a little more adult.  Frankly I was in the mood to do something else too.  This recipe looked simple and perfect.  I didn't have the right meat so I pulled out three boneless eye round steak to thaw.  Then when I was putting it together I found my husband had used the last can of cream of anything soup in yesterdays casserole and had not told me so I used regular condensed tomato soup.  I figured with the change in taste it probably could use a bit of spicing so I added probably 2 t. worcestershire sauce and a small can of chopped mushrooms (drained) over the top.  The onion soup mix and foil I actually had!  Go figure.  Anyway I ran short on time so I put the heat at 375F and cut the time to 2 hours although 1.5 hours probably would have been enough.  It tasted great!  It was firm to cut but actually very soft in your mouth.  Next time I would add more W. sauce and cut the cooking time.  I would also suggest trying this in a crock pot/slow cooker to keep some of the juice, mine leaked out everywhere.  My husband's comment was that it tasted very "professional".

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe ::but:: be careful to keep the foil packet well-sealed; mine came apart a little bit and some of the juices leaked out. As a result, the meat tasted a little dry. Other than this little drawback, the recipe was yummy and the leftovers lasted for days!

At this point it seems worthless to add my comments to this recipe but I just have to say that it was absolutely great.  I opened the bag and added fresh mushrooms for the last hour and my wife and some just raved about it.  So easy and really tasty.  Thanks to Lynn Beach

This was my first try w/ pot roast.  It was so wonderful.  So easy, too.  I read the reviews and used an extra can of cream of mushroom soup.  It made the best gravy.  The meat was very tender and tasted great.  Even my husband loved it!  No easy task!  Thank you very much.

This is super easy to make, and delicious even if you don't have the onion soup available (just omit).  I have made this several times, it always gets eaten quickly.  Prior to this recipe, my attempts at roasts always failed, this one is a winner.
Eash time I have added sliced onion, carrots, potatoes, celery and garlic before sealing the foil (use the large foil).  My family really loves the vegetables, so can't leave those out.

This roast is so easy to make. You can throw everything together and have it in the oven in under 5 minutes.  I made gravy with the sauce that was left over, both the roast and the gravy disappeared.  My family loved it so much I made it twice in one week.

I don't know what I did wrong. It came out tough and dry; used a boneless cross rib roast.  300 degrees for 3.5 hours.  Maybe I didn't seal the foil tight enough?

Best ever pot roast recipe.  I did make a few changes.  Used a 4lb rump roast, Golden Mushroom Soup, a can of Campbells Beef Gravy and 2T cooking Sherry.  Also put a sliced onion on top.  Cooked as directed.  The meat was so tender it was like cutting butter.  Gravy was spectacular on mashed potatoes.  This is my new 'go to' pot roast recipe.

This recipe is simple, fast and tasty. We tried the recipe today and it was moist, tender and delicious! I would certainly recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys a good pot roast. I think the whole idea of the foil is to prevent the roast from losing it's moisture and locks in the flavour.

I found this recipe after breaking my crock pot on the day I intended to put a roast in it and it was a lifesaver for an easy oven roast.  I doubled the mushroom soup as suggested and put in an extra 1/2 packet of onion soup, but I won't add extra onion soup mix again, as I made it too salty.  (Everyone else thought it was great)  This is a great and easy recipe and unless you want extra gravy, the original recipe is perfect as it is posted.

Delicious. Simple to make and the end product is wonderful. I was worried it would be too salty but it wasn't at all. I made no adjustments to this recipe though I'm sure adding some veggies would be good too. Served this over rice. For the minimal amount of work this takes, you get great flavor.

This is the only pot roast I've been able to get my husband to eat... partially because I always somehow screw them up. This one is so fool proof, though! The onion soup mix and canned soup do make this one amazingly tender roast. I like to add baby carrots, onions, and potatoes around the roast before I seal up the foil. Great, great recipe!

Don't use the onion soup mix -yuck.  Instead, give the roast (underblade chuch roast) a heavy rub on both sides with garlic powder.  Slice fresh onions and put on bottom of pan and then on top of the garlic-rubbed steak.  Then pour 1 can of mushroom soup on top.  No water required.  Cover 13x9 pan tightly with tin foil (no need to wrap the whole thing in tin foil, just the top) and bake as directed.  Melt in your mouth good with amazing gravy that has real onions in it.  With these changes, it gets five stars.

This was my first time cooking a pot roast and it turned out to be the best one I've ever had! After  reading the other reviews I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and added some crushed garlic and a little bit of red wine to the sauce. My roast was larger than the recipe recomended so I had to cook it longer, but basted it every 30 minutes or so. I also used a roasting pan with the lid instead of tin foil since I did not have enough on hand. The gravy was delicious, I fried some mushrooms and onions and mixed them into some of the gravy, and also served some gravy just plain. When it came time to carve the roast, there was no need it just fell apart. This was by far the most tender and moist roast I've ever had. I will be making it again soon!

This is so easy to make and tastes great. I love roast when it falls apart and this recipes did not disappoint. Everyone I have made it for loves it and they have asked for it again.  I am a salt person so I would add more salt but I love salt a lot and I usually add it later  so I do not ruin it for others.

This flavor was fantastic! My roast was smaller than the recipe calls for, and so I kept a close eye on the time and still overcooked it slightly. The gravy made up for it though. I will make this many more times!

At first, I was worried about the salt not penetrating the roast but I found that if you cut the roast (cooked) into small slices and pour the sauce over them, they're just fine. Wonderful recipe, very easy. Everyone had seconds.

WOW! This pot roast was DELICIOUS! The only changes I made was that I used 1 1/2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and added fresh potatoes and carrots. The gravy it made was very good, if you do not like potatoes and carrots with your roast the gravy would be great over mashed potatoes. I will make this again and again!

This was my first attempt at a pot roast and it was absolutely amazing.  One of our friends (and his girlfriend) just polished off all the leftovers an hour ago, issuing compliments that would make even the vainest person blush.  I took others' advice from here - I doubled the soup, used a rub (in my case, peppercorn, which made the meat spicy and hot and absolutely incredible, and it complemented the soup way better than I dared to hope), used a bag instead of foil, threw in red pearl onions and quartered red potatoes (along with carrots and celery).  The meat reached 180 degrees within 2 hours, so I took it out at 3.  I probably should've left it longer, as the flavor was excellent but it wasn't as tender as I was hoping.  I plan to try it again using a savory herb rub and a longer cook time; we'll see what happens!  This website is making me appear to be a much better cook than I am.  :)

This is so easy....I love it!  Instead of placing in baking dish and foil I put this in a regular pot and cover it and its super moist and tasty.  I usually cut up potatoes, onions, and carrots and put them around the edges of the pot roast.  The natural juices and mushroom mixture makes them taste delicious.

This is the best recipe... I have made this 4 times now... I didnt add the dry onion mix though.  First, I rubbedd the meat with seasoning then used a couple of tsps of olive oil and rubbed the meat on both sides. Then I placed it in a oven bag... I used 2 cloves of garlic(using my garlic press)which I put on top of the roast(used Sirloin instead). Then poured 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup on top... 2 tbsp of worcester sauce, I quartered a medium onlon, quartered 4 medium red skinned potatoes, a handful of the small baby carrots, instead of the water(I used beef broth for the flavor).
Amazing!  This was the best meal ever.... My husband wants this meal once a week and my kids loved it... I makes tones of gravy.. By the way I made mashed potatoes with the red potatoes unskinned... you just add butter and canned cream with salt and pepper talk about wonderful!  I tell everyone about this recipe.....

This was the first roast I've ever made and it turned out great!  I did however use 2 cans of low-fat cream of mushroom and 2 packets of the soup mix as the first time I made it there wasn't enough gravy!! In addition I added baby carrots (towards the end)and baby reds and it was sooooo tasty.  This is for sure a favorite!  Oh and so easy too :-)

I can't remember how many times I have made this.  It is my favorite pot roast recipe.  I've never had a problem with it being dry.  I use fresh onions instead of the soup mix and adding misc. veggies works great.  I've made this for company too to rave reviews.  I LOVE this recipe!

This was awesome! It passed the ultimate test, all four of my kids loved it.  The only problem. . . we ate it all so no leftovers. bummer.  I did cook it at 350 for 2 hours and it came out a perfectly medium. Everything else I did just as the recipe said.  Thanks to the submitter.

This is the ultimate in easy and delicous!  I did modify a few things: I seasoned my roast with salt, pepper and garlic powder, then browned on all sides before wrapping it in foil.  I doubled the gravy as many others have suggested and grateful for!  I added carrots, onions, red potatoes, and whole garlic cloves.  Clean up was a snap and the leftovers got better tasting with each day!  The leftovers also made a fantastic base for beef hash.

This is a great base recipe. I usually throw all the ingredients along with onions and green bell peppers into my slow cooker in the morning on low and when I get home from work its so good and tender that it falls apart before I can get it on a serving platter.

This was delicious!  I'll definitely be making this again.  The only thing I changed was I browned the meat on the stove top first.  I also think that I'll shorten the cooking time next time.

I am 72 years old and this was the best and tastiest roast I ever cooked! I did add a couple of tablespoons of Beau Monde patted all over the roast, which always enriches beef. My grandchildren who can be picky, ate the entire roast!

This is really good.  I like my meat well done so I cooked for the full 4 hours.  I used 2 cans of Cream Mushroom soup and 1 packet dry onion mix.  I added baby carrots, whole mushrooms, and baby red potatoes (cut in half).  Unfortunately I used a larger pan and there wasn't much gravy (it just dried all over bottom).  Next time I will use a 9*13 inch pan and see how the gravy turns out then.  Everything still tasted delicious.  The meat was so tender, but I think it needs some more seasoning.  I will definately make this again and play around with the seasonings.

WOW, This was so easy and tasted wonderfull. because the first couple of times I made this, the gravy leaked out so now I just put the tin foil over the top of the pan and the gravy never dries out and I also add two cans of mushroom soup just so we have extra for our mashed potatoes.
thanks for the great recpie

I almost want to say that this tasted better than previous pot roast that I've had that was cooked in a crock pot - although I've haven't made any myself with that method.  I must say that that my first try with this I overloaded it with carrots, mushrooms, and potatoes b/c I didn't want to have leftover veggies.  The meat lady at the market also sold me the wrong kind of roast and it was horrible.  After trying a 2nd time and not adding veggies at all b/c of my downfall the first time, this is an absolutely perfect home-cooked meal.  Tastes so good with mashed potatoes and green beans!  This is definitely a 3...er...2 thumbs up!  Flavor is absolutely wonderful.  MAke sure to wrap it very tight with lots of tin foil so gravy doesn't leak out and burn onto your pan.

Simply Fantastic!! My husband and I really enjoyed it. I was looking for a new way to spice up my boring roast. I did not have the oinion soup mix, so I made my own using 2 beef bouillon cubes and a 1/8-1/4 cup dried onions. Thanks Lynn!

This is the best pot roast recipe EVER!  It tastes just like mom's, and this method is easier!  The soup makes a wonderful gravy that is more than enough for the meat and potatoes.  At first bite my boyfriend said "Yup, add this to the dinner rotation!"  THANKS!!

This turned out great! I too added some cubed potatoes and carrots and in addition to the water - I added a couple TBLS of red wine. Per "LuckyChilds'" advice - I also added some parsley and dried rosemary. It did leak in a couple of spots but clean up was still a breeze.  Easy prep, tasty, and a well-rounded & filling meal in one dish makes this a winner in our book! Thanks Lynn!

I am a "new bride," and while I have used my slow cooker to do pot roast before, I didn't know how to do one in the oven.  This recipe really helped and was easy enough that I could do it!  I also did some turnips, potatoes, carrots, and parsnips on the side and added some thyme, parsley, oregano, rosemary, and black pepper.  Yum!

This is probably the best pot roast I've had since my slow cooker disappeared on me!  (don't ask, I lose everything!)  I made it last night fot a late night supper and the hubby and I both loved it!  I hate anything mushroom related, so I use one can cream of chicken and one can cream of broccolli.  Odd coloring at first, but the taste was awesome.  I also used the herb and garlic soup mix since I hate onions, too.  I rubbed some cajun seasoning, garlic powder and black pepper onto the roast first and shoved some minced garlic (garlic fiends here) into the roast which REALLY enhanced the flavors.  Also added about 5 cubed potatoes, which were just scrumptious!  Wrapped it up tight (well, I thought it tight, did leak some) and baked my 3 pounder for about 3 hr and 15 mins.  By then, the smell was too good to resist so I took it out (burned myself on HOT foil! duh!) and let it sit about 5 mins.  Then couldn't hold hubby back any longer!  lol  We sliced it up and just devoured it!  The roast was tender, the gravy to die for and the potatoes perfect!  Thanks for the recipe; I'll use it again and again!  :o)

Easy recipe and easy clean up.  However, my roast took the full four hours to cook before it was tender enough.  I'd probably use this recipe again but in a crock pot.

Delicious!  The meat and vegetables are tender!  A great comfort food recipe!  My family likes worchestershire sauce added to the soup mix.  It adds a nice flavor to the roast.  Thanks Lynn!

A truly fool proof recipe!  I love mushrooms and onions so I sauteed some sliced onions till golden and added them with some fresh sliced mushrooms to the top of the roast before sealing the foil.  Extra yummy!

I don't typically prepare a lot of beef dishes, but I will definitely make this one a regular!  So easy and so good -- you can't go wrong!  Doubling or even tripling the gravy is a must.

Great recipie!  Using foil beats the Nesco for taste and ease of cleanup.  I was sceptical of the 4 hour baking time and took the roast out at 3 1/2 hours.  It was just right.  The meat, potatoes and carrots were just right.  Next time I may add some celery and a couple cloves of garlic to enhance the flavor a little.  Great job!

Great basic recipe! I don't penalize anyone on the stars just b/c I'd add more spices or anything that adds flavor. The basic concept of the recipe is sound and everybody has different tastes when it comes to seasoning.

Excellent!  Watch cooking time, and be careful of salt. There is plenty salt in onion mix and mushroom soup!  I roasted potatoes, carrots, & onions in cast iron skillet and poured gravy over them for the last 15-20 mins. Turned out great.

My ma and I used to make this with a chuck roast and "Bert's Superb Barbeque Sauce" ... with heavy duty foil, it could be put on a grill even. Lay the meat on onion slices, for no sticking, and juicy bottom. 5 stars easy.

this is an excellent start for beginners making a roast. as this was my first time, i appreciated the simplicity. i did read some of the reviews for other suggestions & made the following changes:

1. i lightly seasoned the roast with "mccormick grill mates montreal steak seasoning" but i'm sure any seasonings you prefer would be fine (for those who said it liked taste)

2. sprinkled both sides with worcestershire sauce, maybe 1 tbsp each side (again for taste)

3. definitely use 2 cans of mushroom soup if you want more gravy

4. i cooked it at 300 deg for 2 hrs & let it rest (covered) for 30 min before cutting. once my internal temperature hit 190, i felt it was done. i think that's why some people are getting overcooked roasts. they are definitely cooking them too long.....mine came out very tender!

I was super excited after reading the reviews, I followed the recipe exactly with out any add ons, and was very disappointed. The meat came out super bland, dry and tough. My husband is pretty tolerant of most of my kitchen experiments but he actually asked me to go back to my normal recipe and not make this again :(

This is the recipe that I was raised on and in turn I raised my children on. My mother always made this and it is my go to for good 'ol fashioned comfort food. The only thing is that I strongly disagree with listening to others and doubling the soup. I tried it once and if you prefer boiled meat, then it's right for you. I prefer roasted and too much liquid boils it instead, making it rubbery. If you want more gravy, add the second can AFTER the roast is finished, not during the roast. I don't do the water sprinkling thing and here's a tip for one less dish: sprinkle the dried soup on the bottom, lay the roast on top, then top with the mushroom soup. They will mix on their own with all the meat juices and now you don't have to mix it beforehand, saving dishes! I always serve it with garlic mashed potatoes, seasoned green beans and hot yeast rolls. It's the ultimate family dinner.

Great, easy, fast - family loved it! I love to oven braise in LeCreuset, so seared the roast well & removed from pot. Added quartered onions and big chunks of carrot - tossed around for a couple of minutes. Added 1/2 C red wine to deglaze and reduced liquid to half. Put roast in pot, tossed in a small handful of dried porcini and a bouquet of fresh rosemary, thyme and 2 bay leaves. Poured in 2 cans mushroom soup and packet of onion soup mix. No seasoning except cracked black pepper. Covered with foil and topped with pot lid. Into 300 oven for 3-1/2 hrs (3#bottom round). Took 15 mins to prep and relaxed all afternoon while it braised. Guests raved about it. I know I tweaked it a lot from original recipe - but recipe begged to be tweaked! I happen to know original recipe rocks too!

I followed the recipe as written and my family loved it!  So simple and so delicious! I will definitely be making this again.  I will never understand why some reviewers make changes to a recipe and then submit a review.  This one actually works very well, just as it is.  Next time I may try to add a few things, but as an 'amateur' cook, I appreciated the simplicity and flavor of this recipe.

I've made this several times over the years. Made it again today and decided to go ahead and add a review. I made it "as written" for the first couple of times and here's the bottom line: it's QUITE tasty and relatively fool-proof. And the fact that it's wrapped in foil means that clean-up is pretty easy and it stays moist. This time, I ended up making a couple of small changes. As I was missing the onion soup, I subbed a packet of McCormick's brown gravy mix. Also added a dry rosemary and garlic seasoning mix and threw in a healthy shake of onion powder. Also cubed up some root veggies (carrots, red potatoes and rutabaga, tossed in at the start of cooking and sealed in the packet.) It all worked quite well...just the right thing for a cool fall dinner. Thanks!

This roast was awesome!  I used two cans as other reviewers had recommended, and I added a healthy dose of Worcestershire sauce to the gravy mix as well as the bare roast before cooking it.  I also added a half a pack of powdered ranch dressing mix, some ground mustard, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder to the gravy mix.  This was more of a preference thing really.  I'm sure it would have been just as good as written.  I made it last week and my boyfriend already asked for it again.  I added carrots today to the roast and will serve it with mashed potatoes.  Already a household favorite.

Love it! My grandpa used this exact same recipe my whole life and I may be partial but it was the best pot roast I still use it to this day.  You can also use an au jus from the bottle or make some from powder I use the one from Johnnys and its a nice change if your not an onion person

Excellent recipe!  Like some other comments, I used 2 cans of soup (1 condensed cream of mushroom (low fat) and 1 condensed cream of celery) to get more sauce.  I also added the potatoes, onion and baby carrots.  The whole family loved it! My husband couldn't stop raving about it and my son had not only seconds but thirds!! I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved how simple and delicious this recipe was! I didn't change the recipe, but the cooking time was a bit too long - I needed about maybe 3 1/2 hours or a bit less. Other than that, I'd love to do this easy one again!

I would have to stay normally I cook my roasts in the crockpot but this recipe I did in the oven and it's really good.  I think I may now slow cook some of my other means in the oven instead of the crockpot.  I did though add some minced garlic.

Have always made our pot roasts in the crockpot...gave this a try when short on time...will NEVER cook a roast any other way again!  Absolutely delicious & oh so tender.  Add potatoes and carrots...fantastic!

My husband thought it was great, but the meat wasn't as tender as I was expecting....   Think I might try it in the crock pot next time.  I made beef and noodles with the leftovers, and it was AMAZING!

Delicious, I used a crockpot instead of the oven just because I don't have the 9X13 Roast Pan.  What can I say, I'm a guy.  Definitely loved the smell of my apartment with this thing cooking all day though!

Made this last night for dinner.  I followed the suggestions of a couple of other reviewers; to the sauce portion of the recipe I added some Worcestershire and steak sauce and a bit of Tobasco (everyone likes things hot at my house) and then just placed the roast into a roasting pan and covered tightly with foil. Excellent. Massive quantities of gravy for the roast and mashed potatoes. 
This really is an easy and delicious meal to fix and forget and you won't break the bank serving a beef roast!

This recipe is perfect exactly as is written. Meat came out moist and flavorful, and the gravy was wonderful. This will be made in our home regularly. Bet it will go for sandwiches tomorrow.  thanks for the recipe.

This was really great, so easy! of course I had to make a few changes due to not having some items in the house.  I used an oven bag and didnt have the onion soup so I added chopped onion.  My BF hates mushrooms so I added one can of cream of potato soup and one can of cream of chicken soup, it was DELISH!!! It smelled so good cooking and make the BEST gravy!! The roast was so tender.  definately a keeper!

This roast was incredible.  I made a smaller roast (1-1/2 lbs.) and only cooked it 2-1/2 hours, and it turned out great.  It was tender and tasty and I will definitely make it again.  I used a ranch roast which was awesome.  Perfect Sunday meal accompanied with homemade mashed potatos and corn.  Yummm-eeeee!

Loved it!  I used cream of mushroom and roasted garlic soup, and a dry rub of garlic powder, thyme and pepper.  I put onions, quartered mushrooms and potatoes in the foil.  Next time, I'll leave out the onions as they overpowered the garlic.  This is a terrific recipe!

Ultimate comfort food, American style. So incredibly easy, and very tasty. I used a 3lb eye of round cut and it was delicious. I had plenty of gravy just following the recipe as written, but there were only two of us.

I invited my nephew and his fiance over for dinner and prepared this. I got such wonderful praises. It was indeed delicious. I used more water(half a cup) to make more gravy, and used half a package of dry onion soup mix. I also added potatoes and carrots. I will prepare this again tomorrow night when my brother and Dad visit. Serve it with a big tossed salad!

This is the second time I have made this pot roast.   I used a boneless 7-bone roast each time, and the first time I used the foil method, and it was delicious.  This time, I am making it in a crock pot, with the same soups, and will serve it with Oprah Potatoes; Oprah potatoes are mashed potatoes made with butter, milk, sour cream and prepared horseradish ....... they are truely wonderful with the gravy from the roast.  I also used a crock pot cooking bag ...... simple cleanup, and a delicious meal - just add a veggie and you have dinner!!

This was the best pot roast I have ever had.  I used a chuck roast instead, campbells golden mushroom soup and also added 1 onion, carrots and potatoes. It was so tender my whole family loved it. I do agree with other reviews that you should use 2 cans soup and 2 packet of onion soup to make more gravy.  I will definitely make this again.

This was such a great dish.  I had made this in an oven bag and pretty much followed those directions.  I only used about a pound of meat so I cooked it about 2 1/2 hours.  It turned out great but I would have liked it a little bit more tender.  This was my first time making a pot roast and I will definitely make it again.

The first time I made this my meat was a little dry but nonetheless was the best tasting roast I had in a long time...made it again today but used an oven bag and it was even better! I added potatoes, onions and carrots both times for a complete meal and spiced up the meat a tad with some crushed garlic...awesome recipe !!

This recipe is really easy to follow and the gravy is delicious, although I did add a little garlic and steak sauce to mine.
BUT 4 hours is WAAAY too long to cook a 3 pound roast.  I took mine out after 3 hours and it was still a little over cooked.  I would suggest 2 1/2 hours to make sure that the meat stays tender.
Overall, a good recipe and a keeper with a few adjustments.

Wow!  So easy!  Worthy of 5 stars for that alone.  I took the advice of others and cooked the beef for a fraction of the time (used a meat thermometer) because we prefer it medium.  Also cooked mushrooms, carrots and potatoes in the foil with the beef.  I added red wine instead of water to the gravy and used reduced fat soup.  Delicious meal with almost no clean up! 

Thank you for this recipe!

This was delicious. I wish I would have used two cans of soup so there had been more gravy. Instead of wrapping everything in foil I covered the 9x13 in foil and it worked just as well. I've always been wary of making pot roast becuase my mom's was never that tasty (sorry Mom, I love you anyway!). But this was so good and so simple.

Very tender with wonderful gravy. My husband liked it better than my usual pot roast. Next time I will cook it in the crock pot.

we thought this was good but not great. try to cook your meat for the full 4 hours.  i read several reviews recommending a shorter time so i crumbled & took my roast out after 3 hours. the meat was tasty but far from tender. i know another hour in the oven would've made the difference. this went well with mashed potatoes & mixed veggies. thanks lynn!

Quick, easy, good.  I've heard the mushroom soup before...but the onion soup mix added to it gave it an edge! Good meal...and key word is QUICK!

I LOVED.. 
1) that I only had to buy 3 ingredients! 
2) that it was so simple to make!  
3) that it tasted delicious! 

I would make this again and again.  This is good for family meals or having company over. If you plan on really serving 8, make more! I don't think this would be enough.

I was happily surprised. Even with all the rave reviews I was worried the gravy this makes would be too thick and rich. It was perfect. 

I served this with baby carrots (made seperatly) and a little horse radish on the side.  We eat moderate carbs in our house, so I can only imagine how delicious this would be with mashed potatoes, as the submitter suggests.

Oo I cooked it for 4 hrs and it came out a little dry; it was almost like all the gravy didnt soak into the meat, I had a ton of liquid, and a roast that was very dry on the inside... Next night it was better, I revived the meat by popping it in a glass dish w/ a lid, a bit of water, the remaining gravy and heated it up on low (250 I think) for about an hour, which really helped the meat absord the liquid... Next time I'll probably skip the foil, as I think the meat did better submerged in the gravy rather than surrounded. Good stuff though, reminded me of home :)

This turned out great!  I hadn't had pot roast in years and my family moved overseas a few months ago, so I decided to try it.  I did alter it a bit (some by my choice, some by the recommendation of others).  I cubed the beef (fairly large cubes, about 2-3 inches in thickness), browned the beef on all sides a bit in a little olive oil (as others recommended), added cut mushrooms, carrots, and onions, doubled the amount of condensed soup and onion soup mix, increased the water to 1/2 cup, and cooked in the slow cooker for about 7 hours on low.  Served with mashed red potatoes...WOW was it good!  My boyfriend and roommate both loved it!  I'll definently make it again, but next time, I'm gonna stir it a few times while it's in the crock pot.  But, definently a keeper!!

I used 2 cans of mushroom soup, added one cooking onion, sliced, a dash or two of garlic powder, some chopped carrots and potatoes.  All I had to do was make a salad and we had a complete meal.  Fantastic!!

5 STARS!!!! Not only was this SO easy,it was delicious!  I rubbed the roast with garlic and added fresh ground pepper.  I also drizzled a small amount of olive oil.I also added fresh rosemary,YUM! I used the one can of cream of mushroom soup with the onion soup and had plenty of gravy!  Adding cubed potatoes, baby carrots and sliced mushrooms, it was the perfect "all in one dish!"  After reading the reviews of various cooking times, I watched it carefully and it was perfect after only 2 hours and 45 minutes(otherwise, I think it would have been dry if kept in for remotely close to 3-4 hours!)Thanks!

good, basic recipe for pot roast.  very easy.  as others, I only cooked for 3.5 hrs even with potatoes/carrots and it was done.  4 hrs would have been too long resulting in dry meat, although plenty of gravy.

Pretty good.  I added some baby carrots on the sides of the roast.  4 hours is way too long to cook--I pulled it out at about 3 1/2 and it was already more well done than we like.  I transferred the gravy and carrots to a saucepan with some slices of the beef to keep it warm and to really let the beef soak up the gravy. Garlic mashed potatos and green beans finished up the plate. Afterwards, I refrigerated the leftover beef for a bit and then sliced it in the meat slicer for sandwiches for lunch.

This was FANTASTIC!  My 8 year old son went NUTS over this!  I’ve never made pot roast before and I wanted to try something easy.  I will make this from now on.  Better than my Mom's!  (Sorry Ma).  A few tweaks... Omitted the onion soup.  I browned the meat in olive oil.  I rubbed the meat with garlic and I added celery, potatoes and parsnips.  I topped it with the mushroom soup and a little water.  (Next time I will double the soup to make a thicker gravy).  I also added basil, pepper, oregano & rosemary.  I topped it off with some grated pecorino romano cheese.  (We’re Italian. I couldn’t help it :)  I cooked it to 155 F and it took 2 1/2 hours.  YUM!

LOVE IT!!  I have made pot roast many times with the different pre-packed seasoning packets. I never really liked them and I am still new at cooking and wasn't sure what to try. I decided to give this recipe a try and am I glad I did. The beef was really tender and had great flavor. I did add potatoes and carrots to it. It made a great gravy which my husband really liked. I will probably make pot roast a lot more often now. Thanks!

This was awesome! I used a 4lb roast which I sprinkled with garlic and pepper and browned on the stove first. I then added a handful of chopped celery, sliced carrots and sliced mushrooms. I would have added potatoes but I ran out of room. Served it with mashed potatoes instead...again, awesome! My family had seconds, my eight year old licked his bowl clean :) and my five year old said "Mommy, make this every night." Thanks for sharing!

This is my favorite pot roast recipe but I substitute French Onion Soup for the dry onion soup and omit the water. I mix the two soups together and pour over the meat.  Yummy gravy!

I made this today and it was wonderful!  I added cut up carrots and potatoes to the foil and cooked them right along with the roast....it was great.  The only problem I had was that a little juice leaked out of the foil.  Buy the large size (width)in the foil, or I was thinking the next time I make this, I might try using a cooking bag that would seal in the juices better.  Thanks Lynn for a wonderful recipe!!!

Excellent!  The only time my roast has been so moist and easy.  Use heavy duty foil or a double layer to ensure super easy cleanup.

WOW! This was so delicious and tender! I can't rave about this enough. The whole family loved it. I double wrapped the roast in foil in two different directions to prevent the gravy from leaking out. I also browned the meat first. The meat literally fell apart as I was cutting it. This is my favorite.

I usually use a slow cooker, but didn't have the time, so I tried this one.  It was great!!  I added soya sauce, worchestershire sauce, onions and sour cream to the recipe.  My family loved it!  I only cooked for about 3 1/2 hours also.  It was moist and tasty.

This recipe is a good basic recipe, but I like my slow cooker recipe better.  I had never made a roast before using this recipe, and I guess I should have browned it in oil first (mom's advice too late) and the roast turned out too dry and looked grey.  It had a good taste, so it would probably be fine with some tweaking.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The meat came out dry, the gravy was very salty and there was hardly any of it.  I had better luck with the crockpot recipes on this site...my roasts have always come out tender with plenty of gravy.

What a great way to cook a roast!  I had never baked a roast before and this was easy.  I followed previous review and didn't make a foil packet, but put foil over the pan.  Also, I added carrots, potatoes, and onions; these cooked up beautifully.  The gravy that was made was wonderful and the meat was tender.  I only had to cook mine for about 3 1/2 hours.  My husband who doesn't like beef roast raved about it.  This recipe is a keeper and we will be making this again.

I make this recipe all the time. I often use a chuck roast and place in in one of the reynolds pocket type foils for baking and bake for 3 hours...My husband and kids love it especially since it makes a wonderful gravy

One of the easiest recipes around!  It takes a while to cook, but is totally worth it--so tender.  I always add potatoes and sliced onions, and it turns out very well.

Very easy and tasty. Meat was very tender. I agree with other reviewers that the gravy should be doubled. I cooked carrots, celery, onion and potatoes in the foil with the meat.

My friend's mother showed me how to do this with cubed stew meat, using sherry or dark beer instead of water in  her oven. I then tried this without liquid in the crock pot, but it turns out ugly, watery, and the carrot and potatoes a bit overdone.  The best thing I have found so far is to trim the meat, brown the whole roast on all sides in a little oil, then cook it on high pressure in my electric electric pressure cooker for 75 minutes, using half liquid.  

Serve with steamed vegetables and wide egg noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes and watch it disappear.

The roast beef couldn't be better.  And the gravy was wonderful!  I cooked it with carrots and cubed potatoes ... the family devoured it.  I have been searching in vain for a tender, juicy roast beef recipe and now the search has ended.

I made a few changes on this recipe.  I used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom soup and added more water to make creamy.  I cooked this in my crock pot for about 8 hrs.  The flavor was wonderful and meat extremely tender.  Not a bite went to waste!!

Great! When I pulled it out of the oven it was so tender we didn't even need a knife. The wife kept saying as to how it was so tasty. It'll be one of the staples at our home, you can count on that.

I made this for my husband and his parents and they were impressed.  My husband thought it tasted better than the one I made in the slow cooker.  I too added baby carrots and halved baby potatoes before adding the sauce mixture and it turned out to be DELICIOUS.  The only thing I did differently was that I seasoned the meat and vegetables with seasoned salt  and some MSG before adding the sauce mixture.  This little thing does make a big difference.  This dish is perfect for the cold weather and so easy to prepare!

This roast was very tender and moist - I could cut it with my fork!  I used cream of onion soup and minced garlic instead of cream of mushroom and onion soup mix.  I recommend this recipe.

It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I added small, round potatoes to the roast in aluminum foil. We had red cabbage and beets as sides. Definitely will make again.

My mom has made pot roast this way for over 70 years, with a couple minor changes that make all the difference in the world! Use a chuck roast and substitute Worcestershire sauce for the water!  I make this all the time for my husband and our family and friends and no one is ever disappointed they love it!

I did make some alterations.  I omitted the cream of mushroom soup and used 1 pack of Lipton's onion soup mix.  The roast still came out moist and savory.  I also threw some carrots in to cook with the roast.  Nomnom!

When I make this again, I think I will double the soup mixture and buy a thinner cut of meat.  I made mine with potatoes and carrots and the taste was wonderful. The roast was really thick, though, and didn't turn out as tender as I would have preferred.

I've been making this since I was a new bride well over 50 years.. My family still loves it! We like it with mashed potatoes & green beans too.I hope lots of new cooks find this recipe.
ps. I use a frozen shoulder roast and if you keep one in the freezer it's a life saver on short notice. also wrap mine in foil.

My husbands favorite. The only change is the gravy. My family goes through it so fast that I triple the recipe. 33 oz cream of mushroom soup, three packets of onion soup mix and 6 Tablespoons of water. Yum

I've been using this recipe for years, can't believe I haven't reviewed it. I have tweaked it a bit over the years - I use 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 packet dry onion soup mix, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, a few splashes of red wine, about a tablespoon of horseradish and about a tablespoon of beef broth base mixed in 1/4 cup hot water. I usually add potatoes, carrots and onions. I don't line my pan with foil, but I do cover it tightly. 300 degrees for the full 4 hours. It always turns out fork tender with plenty of gravy. (I really don't understand how some reviewers say the roast turned out dry and tough - this recipe always works for me.)

The best roast we've ever had! We followed T1INA review except we used A1 steak sauce instead of Lea and Perrins. Cooked in a cooking bag and it was perfect. We also used a chuck roast. Will never cook a roast any other way!

Good but didn't live up to the hype.  I prepared the dish as instructed, will add more seasoning next time.

I'm giving this 5 starts because of the gravy alone. It was AMAZING. I doubled the soup as suggested by others. I tried to rush my roast, cooking it in the convection oven so the meat wasn't very good. I saved the gravy and am making chicken tonight just to serve it with the rest of the gravy. I will try this again following the recipe exactly.

I was really nervous due to some of the negative reviews, but aside from using a 2.5 pound tip sirloin roast because that's all I could find at the store, and adding a few shakes of black pepper I followed the recipe exactly as written. It turned out great, my picky boyfriend gave it an 8/10 and requested it again. I found the gravy to be borderline perfect to just a little too salty but when spooned over steamed veggies was perfecto. 4 hours was a perfect amount of time to let it cook and it fell apart at the touch - no slicing needed. Easy and yummy! Thanks!!

I often look for different ways to use cheaper cuts of meat.  This recipe was wonderful and very east to make.  For this cut of meat, it was very flavorful too and very tender.  Will make this agina.

The only change that I made was making a few slits in the meat and putting a few slivers of garlic in them just because I really like that extra garlic taste..

Got a great price on a roast so I thought I'd try this one.  I used Cream of Celery soup since my daughter hates "fungus", but otherwise all the same.  It was VERY tasty.  I put whole yukon little potatoes in with the roast and they cooked wonderfully.  I used the sauce as gravy and it was just the right consistency.  But almost best of all.... clean up was a breeze.  Thanks.

I have been making pot roast this way for more than 40 years.  I haven't found a better way yet.  My family will drop what they're doing and run to the table.  Easiest way to make people say mmmmm.

I should be ashamed to cook this, as it has so much sodium, but, darn, it is good.  Sometimes, there is  nothing like a good "cream of soup" based meal on a cold night.

This is a recipe I've made many times and is a favorite, go to for and an easy flavorful dinner.  I usually use a chuck roast and will up the soup to two cans for more gravey.  I do prefer to add the potatoes and carrots later so they don't get so mushy.

A very simple and delicious dish. I followed what one of the replies and did not salt the roast. After it finished it needed salt...until you put the gravy it makes over it and it was perfect. I also added potatoes and carrots and still delicious.

Amazing! Best pot roast I ever made. I didn't use any canned ingredients. I just used red wine vinegar, soy sauce, worstecire sauce, and a whole onion. I also seared each side in olive oil and when the oil cooled a little I poured it over the roast before I wrapped it up.

Just make this last night. It was my first time making pot roast, and I'm still pretty new to cooking, but I have to say this was the simplest recipe and it came out amazing! I cooked in an oven bag(no mess!), I used an extra can of soup, and I added cut up potatoes and mini carrots. Only thing I would change next time would be I would make my own gravy separate as well because it didn't make as much as I would have liked

Made this for dinner tonight! DELICIOUS! Now in dinner rotation. Even my crabby dad declared it PERFECTION! He said he had never eaten a more perfect pot roast. Followed recipe (except for extra can of mushroom soup, 1 T minced garlic, lots of salt & pepper and a whole sliced onion). Dad's contribution was the roast, all 9.52 lbs of it. As soon as I saw it I started mentally adjusting the recipe to accommodate it's size. There were only five of us for dinner so I asked him what he was thinking when he bought it, he turned to me and said,"leftovers". Well, that didn't work out too well because there was NONE left. People kept eating and talking and eating, soon it was all gone and everyone was laying around the family room groaning My dad then informed me he was spending the night and buying another roast tomorrow for me to cook the exact same way. This one he's taking home. I asked him if he had any changes to request and he grabbed me by the shoulders and told me not to change a thing. Do it the same way!!, he said, & don't change a thing! Thank you so much! Tender, juicy, flavorful and so easy you'll have a hard time believing you made it! We served it with biscuits, green beans with bacon, beets with apples, mashed potatoes and gravy for days! Oh and I only increased the cooking time by a half hour. Even as large as it was the entire roast was completely cooked, completely tender and is now completely GONE!! The never ending compliments are starting to get embarrassing.

I have made this recipe many times ( as written)  It comes out perfect. Sometimes I put veggies in the foil,  other times not. This is a five star because as written it's perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a perfect roast every time!

I just tried this recipe last night.  Excellent and easy!!  After reading many of the reviews I added a 2nd can of soup and a little garlic (since I love garlic).  I have never done a roast in the oven, I have always done them in my crock-pot so was a little nervous that it would be dry.  It was so tender and flavorful.  My husband has requested that I make it on a regular basis.

It was ok. I used 2 cans of the soup as suggested and there was still only a little bit of sauce/gravy. I cooked 10 minutes less than what was directed and it was a bit dry.

The roast itself was ok, nothing special,  but the vegetables were fantastic,  I added potatoes,  onions,  carrots and slices of garlic as well as used 2 cans of soup. Overall the vegetables made this meal worthwhile, might try making the roast differently next time.

This recipe has been around for over 30 years and is one of those you keep using.  I make it quite a bit because of the gravy. I am not a gravy
 person,but this one I love with mashed potatoes. And....
So easy. Perfect ror those days you want comfort food.  It never disappoints. I see a few that say it is nothing special, but I think it is as good as it gets.

Wow, awesome recipe. This by far the best I have tried. The gravy was second to none. Two thumbs up.

I put the potatoes, carrots and onions in another foil packet by themselves using the left over dry onion soup mix. and a bit of water. For you see there is only two of us again. And I hate wasting food of seasoning. I broke this down for two.

I've been using this recipe for over 30 years. I just put it in the 9 x 13 with 1/4'd red skin potatoes, baby carrots, a few ribs of celery, and cover it with foil. Bake at 350° for 2 hrs.  I've also used various roasts -chuck, bottom, sirloin, london broil...Always tender.

This is very good as written. It made an abundance of gravy and I was actually very surprised at how tender the beef was. I can only guess that some of you, complaining that the meat was dry, used cuts with little, or no fat. Next time, I'll add some sliced onions on top of the gravy mixture. Thanks, LBEECH!

I usually use the slow cooker for pot roasts but I decided to try using the oven when I came across this!  Easy to make, and it was delicious!  I will definitely make this again!

Wow! I never made a pot roast, and nailed this recipe on the first try!!! Everyone asked for seconds. I used Angus bottom round, two cans of mushroom soup for extra gravy, and added Worcestershire sauce.  I baked it in an oven bag for four hours at 300. The meat was so perfectly tender!

Mine turned out dry. The gravy was excellent though. Just wish the meat would of been juicy. Maybe I should have cooked it a little less.

Well, I "failed" at the "no fail" recipe.  The beef was not very tender and the gravy tasted just okay, although it looked like a grey, gelatinous mess with strong, oniony overtones. Probably my fault.  I only cooked it 3 hours instead of 4--because I happened to have a 1.7 pound roast instead of a 3-pounder.  But I checked it with a meat thermometer at 3 hours and it was way past done for beef, so I figured I'd better take it out. So was it overdone or underdone? Or maybe the problem was I used a different cut of roast; can't recall what it was, but it wasn't bottom round. Also, I followed the recommendations to add two cans of the soup...maybe I should have added some other additional liquid too to avoid the gloopy-ness of the gravy. Not sure what I did wrong or if I dare try it again or should move on to another recipe.

I have been messing up pot roasts until I came across this recipe. But the difference is, I had no Lipton Mix or can of soup. 
I researched a copy-cat mix to Lipton's, mixed those ingredients, rubbed down onto the roast, sprinkled with water and a little to go in the pan, covered in foil and set at 300 degrees for up to four hours.
Came.Out.Awesome. We barely had any leftovers. This is definitely a staple for Sunday dinners.

It's nothing like a great pot roast. This quick and easy recipe yielded one of the most tender and juicy dishes that I have made in quite some time. Can't rave enough.

This recipe worked out really well and I did a few things differently as well.
1) Instead of sealing it in foil, I just lined the roasting pan I had and used it's lid to cover.
2) I added onion powder, basil, salt, and pepper to the meat on the top and bottom of the roast.
3) And to the onion soup/mushroom soup mix--added a couple drops of A1 sauce.
4) Cut up some potatoes and put them around the roast as well.

Everything turned out delicious and moist for a very good flavor and aroma throughout the house! I will definitely make this again.
(I must also add that I only made 1.7 lb. of beef bottom round roast, cooked at 325F for 3 hours--could've dropped the cook time since I was only doing half of what the recipe suggests.)

This was easy to make but came out a bit bland. I expected more flavor so I will likely add more spices next time. This was ok.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it always comes out great.  The meat is fork tender and the gravy goes great with mashed potatoes.  This is my go to for when I am craving a fall off the fork roast, it is better than in the crock pot. Wish I had gotten this recipe when I was a new bride 20 years ago!

I went off another reviewer's opinion, and added about 1 tablespoon horseradish sauce, 1 tablespoon steak sauce (I used A-1), and a good couple dashes of worchesershire. I was iffy on using 2 cans of cream of mushroom, but decided to use both in the end and trust me, you will not regret it! I added diced carrots, celery, onion, and mushrooms to the beef. Then when it was done, I served it over garlic mashed potatoes and my fiancee ate 2 full platefuls. I only had a pot roast that I had previously diced into cubes for stew meat, and only cooked it for 3 hours, and it still came out tender and awesome. This will definitely be a make again recipe.

Such a yummy and easy recipe.  If you don't want to run the oven for 4 hours, you can also put it the crock pot overnight on low for 8 hours.  Or I use a timer and run the crock pot during the day so the roast is ready by the time I come home from work.

For someone who hates to cook like me, this recipe really is awesome! It could not be easier to do and the flavor is great. I do recommend following the oft-said advice in here of adding more soup because you FOR SURE will want more gravy!

This was incredible.  I used a 3 pound chuck roast instead because the store didn't have a bottom round.  The only other thing I did was to tuck some baby carrots and red potatos in around the roast. Tender and moist and perfect flavor... I wouldn't change a single thing.  This recipe will be going into my regular rotation.  Thanks LBEECH!

This recipe was amazing.  I never got so many compliments on my cooking before.  I told them all of your recipe.  I did add an extra can of mushroom soup as instructed by other reviewers but besides that I did nothing extra.  My husband is still in love with the leftovers.  This was my first roast to turn out so well I thank God and you.  My roast was a little bigger than called for in the recipe so I had the oven at 325.  Thanks again.

I expected more after the many great reviews.  This is an alright recipe.  We ate it, but no great shakes.  I probably won't make it again and will keep searching for the perfect pot roast recipe, if there is such a thing.

I did do this recipe in the crock pot because of my work schedule - but wasn't really that impressed with the flavors. My husband "the pot roast lover" had good things to say but it left me blah...
 I may try it again per the instructions.

Pretty good. The meat became quite tender and the flavor was ok but next time I think I'll add some spices. This is comfort food - the way grandma made it - bland, but tasty.

WOW! I was very impressed with this recipe! I was sckeptical of the taste of the soup and onion mix - but it was great....this is a man pleaser and a comfort food. I threw in some nugget potatoes an hour prior to it finishing.

Another first satisfied pot roaster.

Followed the recipe, plus an extra can of condensed mushroom soup.

AWESOME!!! Fell apart trying to get it from the pan to the serving dish. So tender, and best of all moist and delicious!

Cooked up some carrots/celery/onion separately and combined the pan gravy with it and pureed it for a thick gravy, served over the meat and mashed potatoes sidedish.

The sleeper recipe for pot roast!!!

Deserves an award.

Leftovers will become BBQ beef sandwiches!

This was a very easy recipe to follow and seemed fail proof. It was quick and easy but tasted superb. I didnt have the onion soup mix but it still tasted great. It was so tender, and everyone was very pleased with my efforts

I added potatoes and carrots to mine, and also used beef broth instead of water. A good alternative if you don't have a slow cooker, but doesn't produce really moist, falling apart results.

My roast was literally falling apart hwen I transferred it to my serving plate.  This was very very good!  My fiance missed the carrots and potatoes that I usually cook with a roast in the slow cooker, but I'm sure those could be added to the foil as well.  The only problem I had, and this is my own doing, was that I didn't have the edges sealed as well as I thought I did, and I lost a lot of the gravy that way(It burned to my pan)  Next time I will take better care to seal better, as what was left of the gravy was delish!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Oh, and instead of seasoning up the soup, I rubbed down the meat.

I love this recipe!!  I have tried so many times to get my roast tender like my mother-in-law.  Last time I made this my husband told me I had finally done it.  It was so tender and juicy!!  I add veggies to mine and serve over minute rice!  Excellent for a fix and forget it meal!!!

This was a bit more dry than our usual way (which is to simmer it all day in seasoned water, so obviously it's VERY moist). The kids LOVED the "gravy" that the soup mixture made. They couldn't get enough.

What a wonderful recipe!  Quick and easy to prepare and just pop it in the oven.  The soups combined made a lovely gravy.  This was by far the easiest roast dinner I've ever made and I will definately be making it again.  Thanks so much for sharing... brides shouldn't be the only one you're giving this recipe to - I plan on passing it along to my mom!

Used this recipe for a Christmas dish feeding 25 people. I cooked 2 roast weighting 6 pounds and piece. I put them in seperate foil and cooked for 5 hours. It was a definite hit. Everyone loved it.

I followed the directions exactly, and I wasn't happy with the results.  The roast turned out tough and dry, so I was really disappointed(especially after spending close to $10 on a piece of meat!).  The veggies that I threw in were delicious, and the gravy was great, too.  However, I think I'm going to keep looking for the perfect roast recipe.

Excellent. I used 2 cans of the cream of mush. as others suggested. I also added red potatos seasoned with garlic salt. It was delicious, not one bite left.

I was a bit skeptical because I'm not a big cream of mushroom soup fan.  I used the lower sodium/fat cream of mushroom soup, added celery, potatoes (whole not sliced), carrots and a little extra water.  It was amazing.  Didn't taste salty at all, only very flavorful.  It's a keeper!

Excellent and easy roast. I made it for guests and they loved the gravy it made. I cooked potatos, carrots, celery, and onions with the meat - it was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe.

This roast was very easy to prepare, but bland and not very tender.  I did exactly as the recipe instructed.  ??

By far the most delicious, tender pot roast I have ever made! Sure to become tradition in our house. I've already been asked when I'm making it again. The best part is no pots to scrub. A busy person's dream recipe.

Outstanding recipe.  The meat came out very tender.  I used 2 cans of the soup mix, will use 3 next time for the purpose of having more gravy.
Definetly put some spuds and carrots in as well.

Definitely a keeper!  It was so easy to put together.  I also doubled the soup mixes to make enough gravy for the mashed potatoes.  Both my husband and 10 year old son went back for seconds!

This was wonderful !!  Even my 5 year old had seconds.  I didn't get mine sealed tight enough, but not much spilled out and the gravy was incredible.  My husband raved and raved about dinner last night...Thanks for the recipe !

I LOVED this pot roast! For years I have been looking for a tender pot roast recipe, and found one that I liked okay--that is, until I tried this recipe!  This is my new favorite!  Next time I may skip the mushroom soup and just put a paste of mustard and onion soup mix on top.  Yum!

This was very good, but a little salty. I still liked it though. Will try it with lightly salted potatoes or maybe with some egg noodles.

i added new potatoes and baby carrots to the roast.  i only wish i'd doubled the soup mixture i'd put on top.  i wanted more of the yummy gravy with this dish than i ended up with.  overall great flavors, just wanted more gravy!

I used an arm roast and didn't add any vegetables.I made mashed potatoes instead. This makes the most wonderful gravy I have ever tasted in my life! I will fix this one over and over.

This is a fantastic recipe!  The roast turned out moist and delicious, and the sauce was great as gravy over mashed potatoes with the skins on.  Thanks!  I'll definately be using this one again.

Very tender, but a little bland - even with all the soups!  Maybe I'll add tomato paste next time.
