I have made this once before - the first time we had tuna steaks.  Very simple, yet very flavorful.  I will be making this again tomorrow.  We love it.  I just throw the steaks on our gas grill and they come out perfect.  I also add a little garlic powder when I am seasoning with salt and pepper.  Very yummy.  There are never any leftovers.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The left overs were used to make the most wonderful tuna salad I've ever eaten.

Delicious.  Hubby came home from Seattle with a ton of tuna and I needed some ideas on what to do with this.  We loved this recipe.  It was so moist and flavorful.  Thanks for the post.

Really great fish!  I used our little counter-top grill indoors instead of the barbeque, and it turned out great.  My 4 year ate a whole steak, and he hasn't finished a meal in 2 weeks!

Very good - the tuna was moist & flavorful.  Cooking time depends on the tuna that you are working with & the temperature of your grill - my tuna took 5 minutes each side.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much flavor the lime juice added. I added some garlic and pepper to the olive oil marinade.  would definitely recommend this easy recipe.

Liked this better than another recipe I tried the same night. Used a mixture of green and black crushed peppercorns. Husband overcooked the fish; still edible but not as enjoyable.

This was in need of more flavor. I made exactly as written. I think the addition of garlic to the olive oil may help this have alittle more flavor.

so my dad came home with a bunch of fresh albacore tuna and i had no idea what to do with it. this was a great starter. i marinated it in the olive oil for an hour and then cut it into little pieces (about 3 inches) and seasoned them with salt and garlic pepper. and then drizzled with fresh squeezed lime juice. it was amazing!

The grilled tuna made the best tuna casserole I ever had. The charcoal gives the tuna a really good taste.

Very good. My husband grilled this on the George Foreman grill. I added some garlic powder after I seasoned with the salt & pepper. I will make again. I served this with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil from this site. Thanks.

A super easy recipe that's incredibly delicious! My daughter flipped out over this recipe. My fresh tuna was cut in 2 1/2 - 3inch thick triangle steaks. As I have a gas grill I did not use soaked hickory wood chips. I marinated it for 2 hours in EVOO. Then covered it with Garlic Salt, Garlic Pepper & Garlic Powder. I grilled it over high heat for 5 minutes on each side. Then I tented it in aluminum foil until I got inside and squeezed the fresh lime juice over the tuna.

Drizzled olive oil on the 2 pound loin, sprinkled with salt and pepper (didn't have the wood chips) and oven baked 500 degrees for 8-9 min, then squeezed 1/2 lime. Yummy!!

With a few more seasonings, this came out awesome. We enjoy our tuna still swimming, so hubby cooked it on a high heat grill for about a minute and a half on each side. This was a great appy at our barbeque on Saturday. Delicious and thanks Gordon!!

This tuna was just average.  It could have used more seasonings.  A good basic tuna recipe though.

This recipe is sooooo good. I've made it a few times now, and yesterday sprinkled some Herbs de Provence on top --- the flavor was FABULOUS! One thing to keep in mind, DO NOT OVERCOOK Tuna - pretend that you are cooking a fillet and cook accordingly to your liking.

Given the tiny amounts of prep/cooking time, there is HUGE returns in flavor & presentation! 2nd time out I put a level TSP of finely minced fresh tarragon into the oil for the tuna to absorb... WOW!!

This was a great meal. I used sushi-grade red salmon and wanted it rare-medium rare but cooked it too long (6 min total) and it was barely pink in the center.  The real treat was the salsa!

Fast, easy and absolutely delicious!!!  

Amazing how so few ingredients could be so tasty. Be sure to use high quality tuna like Ahi or Yellow Fin and don't over cook the tuna.  I kept my grill cover open to sear the fish without overcooking it.

This was delicious!  The only thing is that I didn't have the wood chips to use so I followed the rest of the recipe along with adding a little garlic powder as others suggested.  Simple, easy and delicious would definitely make it again!

I did not have the wood chips to cook on the grill, although that sounds very good.  I thought the recipe was really good without the wood chips too.  I will definitely make this again and will most likely use the wood chips.

There is nothing better than a great tasting meal that only takes a few minutes to cook and prep. Added garlic to recipe.   You better believe I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe

Amazing and healthy.  The only change I made was to add garlic in the marinade.

Who doesn't love seared tuna? I found this recipe and added virgin/original margarita mix to the marinade and let the steaks sit for about 45 min to let them soak up some of the citrus. DO NOT cook them for more than 2 1/2-3 1/2 min per side. They'll become chewy and not good at all. HIGH HEAT and LOW COOK TIME and you'll be alright.

I was reluctant to make this because it was SO simple.  I opted for it because the reviews were so good. I had a BIG tuna steak and thought since its flavor profile was so simple I could make tuna salad with the leftovers.  I guess you know what I'm going to say next....there were no leftovers!  The pop of lime at the end has to be the success of this recipe, since there is not much else to it. Will make again for sure.
