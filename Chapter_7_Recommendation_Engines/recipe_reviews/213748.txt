I have been on here for years and have yet to leave a rate. This recipe really deserved it. 5 stars from a very critical cook. I made a few adjustments based solely on my own personal taste, but this was 5 stars before I ever got near it. My tweaks were substituting 2 tablespoons of siracha for the 3/4 cup salsa, using creamy peanut butter, using a full can of full fat coconut milk, 3 tablespoons of soy, & leaving out the sugar. again these were tweaks to adjust to my own taste.
I served a bed of fresh spinach, topped with bean sprouts, topped with Jasmine rice, then the chicken, then the sauce . . . AWESOME!

I have to agree, I was skeptical.  The only thing I did differently is I used mild salsa (because that's what I had) and I used natural peanut butter (because that's all I buy).  It was good! I will definately put this in my rotation.  It's not strictly Thai if you are a Thai food conniseur, but it is a really great kids-friendly recipe, especially if they are not used to the flavors.  My 2 year old loved it. I love Thai food, so it was a wonderful middle ground between something I appreciate as Thai and something she will eat.  Great!

This was wonderful! Due to my love (some might call it an obsession!) for cilantro, I chopped up a third of a bunch and threw that in with all the other ingredients, as well as using it as a garnish, along with crushed peanuts. 
I also used a whole can of reg coconut milk, upped the pb to 1/2c, and lowered the salsa to 1/2c. Served over jasmine rice, and it still had that great peanut-y taste. Perfect!
Hubby couldn't stop raving, 2 and 4 yr olds gobbled it up right away-- will definitely be making this again! Thank you!

This was good but the peanut butter flavor seemed to get cooked out of the dish in the slow cooker.  So, am going to add a little more.  This also needs a little salt added to it after cooked.  Other than that, this is a really good dish!

I admit that I was skeptical about the combination of salsa and peanut butter when I first read this recipe, but it was fantastic!  My changes were very minor: I used a whole can of regular coconut milk, 1 T. of ginger paste (I didn't have any fresh ginger), brown sugar in place white, about 1 T. dried cilantro mixed with the rest of the sauce and just before serving added peas.  We served this over white rice and it was so delicious!  My boys (4 and 6) gave it two thumbs up :)  Now that's what I like to hear at dinnertime.  This is a keeper!

Delicious and easy. Made only a few changes, creamy pb and whole coconut milk. A little spicy but even the 4 year old didn't mention it was too hot. Thanks Frank!

Yes.  But, as I am a Senior living alone, I did it my way.  Also, I might add, I was a resident of Honolulu for several years so I am very familiar with this style of cooking.  Having said that, this is what I did with your recipe to make it my own.

I pretty much doubled the recipe because I used a whole chicken, skinned.
•  I used smooth peanut butter.
•  Added 1 Tbl. of Fish Sauce
•  1 tsp. Hawaiian Sea Salt
•  I used Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce in lieu of Salsa
What I did next may surprise.  I sat the whole skinned in my Wolfgang Puck Pressure Cooker.   I filled the cavity with the sauce and poured 2 cups of Chicken Stock into the pot around the chicken.  I sat the time according to my crockpot table.
•  When the timer went off and the pressure released, I removed the chicken from the bone and shredded it.
•  I retired the chicken to the pot and set it on warm and allow the sauce to reduce
•  It was delicious!
•  When it cooled to room temperature, I made several meal-size pouches with my seal-a-meal.

For Seniors, making meals in batches is important for those days we just don't feel like cooking.

Good cooking & God Bless!

Very good....I prepared it off of night shift this morning and woke up to it ready to feed my family.  Nice and easy.  Can kick it up a notch in spices if you desire.  Will be added to my slow cooker fav list.

This was very bland...I followed the instructions to the letter but, I ended up adding a tablespoon of fish sauce, 3/4 cup more salsa and tripled the lime juice. I also shredded the chicken as soon as it was done and added it back to the crockpot. Shredding it and adding it back after doctoring the sauce made a big difference. The chicken absorbed sauce and made the chicken even more flavourful.

if you want real Thai food, this isn't it. BUT it's a wonderfully easy weeknight meal that is full of Thai flavors. It felt weird to be mixing salsa and peanut butter together, but it was great. In the end we topped it with sauted onions and garlic and I think that would have been great cooked in the sauce. Also, I do not usually cook with much salt, but I did find that a light sprinkle on the plate made the flavors pop! The man said 5 stars, which makes us both happy!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site!  I use chicken breasts and put them in frozen in the morning since I go to work at 7am.  The chicken falls apart and is shredded in the delicious sauce when I get home and stir it!  Like other reviewers, I use a full can of coconut milk.  Last night I tried stirring a bunch of baby spinach leaves about 10 minutes before serving over a brown rice/quinoa mix.  Delicious!!!

Phenomenal!!  Made it exactly as written the first time and it was delicious; the second time I sauteed together onions and red peppers, and stirred that in with a bunch of fresh spinach about 15 minutes before I wanted to serve it.  Also added about 2 tsp siracha sauce the second time; the spice cooks right out of it otherwise.  Served over rice mixed with green peas... the family couldn't stop raving (even the 10-year-old that doesn't like spices or new flavours).  This recipe is a keeper!

Easy and tasty recipe. I added some Sriracha hot sauce as others recommended. I placed all the thighs on the bottom for me and then for hubby put in a chicken breast on the top. I only had smooth peanut butter so that's what I used.  After combining these strange ingredients it was going to be a hit or miss.  I loved it! It sauce could of been a bit thicker but it sure was tasty and the meat on the thighs melted in your mouth. So good!  My hubby thought it was too bland and the sauce was too runny.  I served it over basmati rice.  I'm basing the review on my taste buds not hubbys!

The key to depth of flavor in this recipe is FRESH GINGER!   (I always keep a jar of equal parts fresh ginger and garlic that I've run through the food processor together.   It lasts for months in the fridge.   For this recipe I used two heaping T of the minced ginger/garlic.)   I didn't have time to use the slow cooker method so started this on the STOVE TOP and then tucked it into a 325 OVEN for a bit.   First I seasoned and browned the chicken, set it aside and sautéed the ginger/garlic with red pepper flakes and thin wedges of onion in the drippings for about a minute.   Then I added the sauce ingredients to the pan -- I wanted to use the whole can of coconut milk so doubled the peanut butter, lime juice and soy; used up the cup of homemade blender salsa I had on hand and added 1/4 C Sriracha.   After tasting, I decided the sugar was definitely needed, along with a bit of salt.   I returned the chicken and juices to the pan, brought it to a boil, covered and put it in the oven until the chicken was very tender.   I stirred in thinly sliced red bell pepper, torn fresh spinach and cilantro, then let rest (covered) for 10 minutes before serving over rice.   My finished dish looked nothing like the drab photo -- it was beautiful!   Even without the bell pepper and greens I added, the sauce was decadently creamy and fortified with yummy vegetables from the salsa.   I don't think chunky commercial salsa would work for this unless you briefly run it through a blender first.

Absolutely delicious, even with a couple substitutions!  Using what I had on hand, I used regular coconut milk, medium (not hot) salsa and honey instead of sugar.  Because I started a little late (noon), I cooked it on high for 3 hours, then on low for 3 hours.  It was fall apart tender.  Cooked some jasmine rice and added some shallots, red pepper, and snap peas at the end to make a very complimentary side dish.  Our guest thought I was a gourmet cook.  I will absolutely make this again!  Thank you for a thoroughly enjoyable recipe and quite simple.

My husband and I loved this recipe! The only changes I made was adding a bit more peanut butter and using more coconut milk - as stated by a couple of reviewers. Oh yeah, I did use chicken legs and breasts because that is what I had on hand. It was very tasty!

It was ok.  I used breasts and they shredded up.  Probably due to lime juice.  Next time I'll leave it till the end.  Also, for me the salsa made it less Thai flavor - more Mexican.  Next time I'll add 1/4 cup of salsa.  And like another reviewer said, it seemed the peanut taste cooked out a little.  But we ate it over jasmine rice.  It was ok, but no raves.  Good for a starter recipe to build on.

My first review because it was so yummy and easy thanks to the crockpot.  I added a little more sugar, some hot pepper flakes and basil but skipped the peanut/cilantro topping.  Kept going back to the pot for more.  Definitely will make this again.

I liked this recipe, but did make some changes. Since I mixed the sauce before adding boneless/skinless chicken thighs, I was able to adjust to taste. This is what I changed, anything not mentioned I left as in the original:
 
1 cup hot salsa
1/2 cup chunky peanut butter
1 can light coconut milk
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger - only because I bought too small of a chunk. 

I like heat, so I added a LOT of extra Sriracha. Not sure exactly how much it ended up being, as I kept adding it by the tablespoon to taste. Probably at least 6 tablespoons.

Cooked on Low for 6.5 hours. Towards the end I saw (as others have noted) that it was quite thin, so I added about 1/2 cup of Bisquik to thicken it up. 

In addition to the peanuts and cilantro, I added some toasted coconut chips as a garnish.

Turned out quite tasty over jasmine rice. The chicken did break down completely, so maybe only about 4 hours on low if you don't like that. It smelled AMAZING while cooking.

Next time I'll add even more peanut butter, and might use regular coconut milk. I love crockpot recipes, and this one is a keeper.

Amazing! Usually my attempts at slow cooking are bland failures, but this turned out incredible. The *only* problem I had was that the sauce never thickened... but that easily could have been my fault. It was still delicious over jasmine rice

Amazing. The best slow cooker chicken meal that I've made. Tastes like it came from a Thai restaurant. I added a few garlic cloves, some fish sauce and some Thai chili paste just to add a little more depth, but may not have needed it. Serve with more rice than you think you'll need, because it's almost like a curry. I also added red peppers and string beans to the pot during the last hour of cooking.

I cooked this on the stove top.  I used Siracha and creamy peanut butter, with chopped peanuts as a garnish, and actually used milk instead of coconut milk (I had run out oops!).  I did add some chicken broth and some really good fish oil.  Seemed to be missing something and I'm not convinced it was the missing coconut milk.  Will keep this recipe but will need to play around with it to get it to work.

I tried this recipe the other night to try out my new slow cooker. 
The chicken turned out very n tender which was great but the flavour of the rest of the ingredients was a little bitter. I thought about it and I think it was because I use only natural peanut butter (no salt, sugar) which has a naturally sort of bitter taste as opposed to say, Skippy. Because of this it wasn't my husband's favourite and I probably won't make it again. If it was just for myself I would because I actually liked the outcome but it's too much for just a single person.

I just got home form work, and it was so nice o come home to an already made dinner.

Usually I find slow cooker meals bland.  Not this one!
I substituted a can full fat coconut milk. It's rich and creamy and simply delicious.

I listened to some other reviewers who said that this was even better the next day.  I cooked this in the slow cooker overnight to serve for dinner the following day.  I just stored the slow cooker crock in the fridge during the day and reheated it that afternoon.  This was so easy to prepare!  Just mix a few ingredients into the slow cooker, add the chicken and then come back in eight hours.  Nice base recipe but I agreed that it needed a little more heat.  I added a teaspoon of siracha sauce while reheating the dish.  I served with brown rice and stir fried veggies.

This was delicious! I made it exactly as written and the sauce was amazing, the chicken so tender! I made it with basmati rice. Even my very picky children ate every last bite! A new family favourite - I will be making this over and over!

The flavors in this recipe were fantastic, but I devoted almost the whole day to this crock recipe, but the cook time was too long.  I followed the directions for cooking time (8 hours), and setting (low), but the chicken thighs were so over-cooked that they were virtually paste, and the sauce was thin and oily.  I'll try this again because I must have done something wrong, but I will definitely cook the dish for less time - probably 5-6 hours on low, to see if that helps the consistency.   

The flavors were really amazing, and I served it over jasmine rice with some soy and maple-marinated baked tofu bites.  So I will come back and adjust my rating if I can get the sauce and cook times adjusted.

I loved this over rice, but mine turned out soupy so my kids were put off by it. they would only eat a little bit. I do not know why mine was so runny. I followed recipe exactly.

This was delicious! The only changes (and they were minor) I made were to use boneless chicken thighs, mild salsa and creamy peanut butter since that's what I had on hand. I was skeptical of the seemingly odd combo of flavors -- salsa, peanut butter, lime juice, etc -- but the result was very tasty!

This wasn't what I expected at all. I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought the final product was bland and greasy. The dark meat chicken doesn't combine well with the coconut milk and peanut butter. I expected at least some sweetness and some heat, and neither came through. My family all didn't care for it either, and we love Thai food. I won't make this again.

I didn't have any hot salsa, so I used 2 Tbsp of Sriracha instead and a whole can of coconut milk. I also used Thai basil in place of cilantro. I served this over Asian Coconut rice.

My version was spicy and a little sweet. This was easy and I will be making again!

Have made this twice and really love it. The hot salsa is tempered by the coconut milk and peanut butter. Cilantro adds that extra zing to the tastebuds just like it’s supposed to. Great recipe!

This is a go-to crock pot meal in my house; I think my husband would eat it every week if I made it!  I usually don't bother topping it with cilantro and peanuts and sometimes I leave out the ginger if I don't have any.  I serve over basmati rice.

We really liked this with the tweaks from other reviews. Doubled the chicken, added fish sauce and sirracha (sp)  no salsa, added red and green peppers and onions during the last hour of cooking. Also took out some liquid and made a slurry to thicken the sauce.  Probably used closer to 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I had to use dried ginger as I didn't have any fresh on hand. Served with rice noodles.  I did not over cook. The thighs were still intact. The peanut butter was still prominent and did not cook out. Will make again for sure.

This was absolutely delicious!!  The only thing I omitted was the 1 tsp. of white sugar.   Also, my dish took only 4 1/2 hours on low to cook.  I had four large chicken thighs (skinless, bone-in) that weighed 2.4 lbs.  Save yourself some cleanup and use one of the slow cooker liners - it worked perfectly!   The finished taste of the sauce was superb and reminds me of the complex flavored Thai sauces at my favorite restaurant that I've always wanted to duplicate.   Now I can!

I have used Frank's recipe and liked it a lot. I have also made it stove top with some changes: 4 chicken thighs, chopped onion and celery tossed in 2 tablespoons of virgin olive oil in a dutch oven. Add 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Cover. Place in 350 oven for about 20 minutes. Put on stove - medium heat. Add a can of coconut milk, 1/2 cup of almond butter, 1/2 cup of hot salsa, and 16 (approx) ounces of chicken stock. 2 Teaspoons Penzey's Bangkok blend, 2 teaspoons Penzey's Ginger. bring to a boil. then let simmer for another 20 minutes or so. Thighs should break apart in nice chunks. (Recipe 2 is totally different by adding 1 tablespoon Penzey's NOW Curry). Recipe 3 is exchanging almond butter for 1 can of organic Pumpkin.  Salt and pepper to taste. If you have it i also add some fish sauce and sweet chili paste but these are an expense if you don't already enjoy cooking this way. Thanks Frank!

I've been married for 15 years and my husband literally said that this might be his favorite chicken dish he's ever had. If you knew how much chicken I cook, you would realize what a compliment this is! I did add a few things which I think made a difference. They are:
about 1-1/2 T green curry paste
2-3 cups chopped cauliflower
3/4 can of the coconut milk, but wish I just added the whole thing
I also used Rotel tomatoes along with some sweet salsa I had.
I KNOW I will be making this again and again and I'm so thankful for this awesome recipe! Thanks Frank!

I made this for dinner last night and followed a few other suggestions (used 2 tsp Siracha instead of salsa, 1 cup whole coconut milk, 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter and most definitely salt at the end).  It was pretty good with some reservations - I would probably use 3 tsp of Siracha next time.  My main complaint is that this is not an attractive dish to look at (we eat with our eyes),it is bland looking and somewhat of a mess since the chicken falls apart.  The cilantro and peanuts help but next time I will add some peas and carrots to make it look more appetizing.  That being said, my husband gobbled it up and I will make it again.

I followed every step in this recipe except I used 4 TBSP of Sriracha sauce instead of the salsa, and since I used a peanut better that had sugar added, I did not add any more sugar to the recipe. For me this time, it was good, but could've been better. Next time I'm going to increase all of the ingredients except the peanut butter, because the peanut butter seemed to over power everything else. Otherwise it was good, my wife loved it and wants me to make it again.

Sorry, no one in my family enjoyed this recipe, including my husband and I. I really wanted to like it but the flavors ended up just tasting off. I followed the recipe verbatim and there ended up being a gross layer of fat on the top of the crock pot when it was done cooking, maybe from the chicken? I don't know. It never smelled appetizing or looked appetizing after it was cooked.

wont try this again.  I'm always looking for good chicken recipes, especially easy make ones (doesn't everybody?)  Yes, it was easy to throw the ingredients together but chicken was rather bland.  True, I used chicken breasts and used 1/2 c hot sauce but I expected more.   I don't like spicy (hot) food.  I could feel the hot sauce on my lips, but I didn't get an upset stomach whatsoever.  I agree with other poster than p/butter flavor was cooked out of this.

This was okay. The combination of flavors is great and the chicken came out super tender. But, there was something about the consistency I just didn't care for.

This was one of the best crock pot recipes I've tried in awhile!  It was great!  Wonderful flavors and something different to try for those less adventurous cooks. I didn't use the sugar and used mild Pace salsa (would try medium next time) and used 2 tsp ground ginger because I didn't have fresh.  Wonderful!!

PB was overpowering in this dish. I made it exactly as written, without however the peanut topping as it was already over-powering. We use all natural PB, so that may have been the difference. Regular PB does not have a really strong taste because of all the oils and sugars and the like. It was a very easy dish to make. My one child liked it, but the rest of us found it bland and like eating straight up warm PB.

Good flavours but the cook time was too long, Like other reviewers mentioned it turned into a 'pulled meat' dish instead of chicken chunks. Next time I'll put it at 6 hours. We added chili, curry powder, garlic and a couple red bell peppers. We will make again with the shorter time. Thank you!

This was amazing!  I read the reviews first and made the following alterations: added a little more peanut butter (used creamy), added a little more lite coconut milk, added some fish sauce (probably 1 or 2 tablespoons), added Sriracha hot sauce (probably 1-2 tablespoons) and added an extra tablespoon or two of limes.  I also shredded the chicken and let it cook for an additional hour or so.  I mixed in peas at the end and served it over brown rice -- amazingly tasty (albeit not low fat).

I made this for a Thai themed party, and everyone raved about this dish!! It was super easy to make, and everyone was impressed. I cut the chicken thighs into smaller pieces so it could be quickly served over rice, then quadrupled the recipe, added sriracha hot sauce, and cooked on high for 4 hours. It turned out perfect!! I will definitely be making this one again!

I would be giving this 5 stars but the recipe really needed some veggies.
I sliced some onion and chopped two red/yellow peppers (green would be even better) and sauteed them in a little olive oil with pepper and garlic salt.  I added this to the slow cooker about 10 minutes before I served. This provided not only some good nutrients but a good crunch. Next time I will add celery to the saute.

This dish is surprising delicious. I use chicken breasts and usually cook this for 4-4.5 hours. That is all it needs to ensure it's not dry. I add cilantro, basil, a tsp extra of sugar (brown, not white), and a couple dashes of cayenne pepper to the sauce before cooking. When it's done, I crush peanuts and toss 
them in ginger, cilantro, and a dash more cayenne before sprinking over top!! Great with rice or noodles!

Made as written except my cook time was about 6 hrs instead of 8-9.  My sauce was a little watery but I am wondering if this could have been why.  The flavor was good and spicier than I anticipated.  Added a little extra sugar as the sauce seemed to be a little bitter, and that worked.  The chicken was tender and flavorful.

I'm a "heavy spicer" and this dish just did not have the full flavor I was looking for. It had a bit too much ginger for my taste. My husband and kids were not too thrilled with it either. It's not a bad dish and was very easy to make, it is just not for my pallet so I gave it 3 stars.

Wonderful! I did double the receipe and made it in a large crock pot. The only thing I will change next time is to add some additional spice. After cooking all day it didn't have the spice I prefer in Thai food.

This was amazing! I gave 4 stars because I removed the salsa and I don't think it would taste as good with it. Wow, the thighs were SO TENDER and delicious. Yum!

Incredibly easy and delicious. I didn't change a thing. My husband and kids loved it. It did cook much quicker than the recipe said. Mine was done in 3 1/2 hours on low. Definitely going in the favorites file.

Tender, tasty and just like takeout...without having to go out! I didn't have time for the low and slow-cook method, so pressure cooked for 15 minutes in my instant pot, then switched to slow cooking on high for a couple of hours.  The end result seemed to be the same: the sauce was well-blended and the chicken was fall-off-the-bone amazing.

This was an outstanding dish.  I didn’t get it started early enough in my crockpot so I put it on high for 3 hours.  It was perfect.  The chicken just fell apart.  I only had coconut cream so it was pretty rich.  Next time I will make it with light coconut milk.  Definitely worth a repeat.  So easy and delicious!

Trust is required for this recipe. Nothing much more gross than mixing salsa, peanut butter and coconut milk. But this recipe is solidly yummy and easy. I’ve made it twice. Once with bone -in skinless thighs, the other with boneless skinless thighs. As is most chicken in a slow cooker, bone - in provides for much, much richer flavor. With boneless thighs, it’s only a 3 star, but with bone -in, a 4.

Four stars because it was delicious. And I agree what other said… It’s even better the second day?. I would have given it five stars if the sauce consistency and texture looked more appealing. Perhaps it was from the organic peanut butter I used or because I didn’t trim the fat off my chicken breast since I put them in frozen.  I would make it again!

Disappointed. Used Crazy Richard’s natural chunky peanut butter but it didn’t dissolve with the remaining ingredients. Even using a full can of full fat coconut milk didn’t help. I won’t make it again.

This dish was good, but still felt it needed a little something. I used medium salsa, creamy peanut butter and full fat coconut milk and  left out the cilantro only because I didn't have any on hand. I think this would be better cooked on the stove top or oven rather than a slow cooker and maybe even brown the thighs first.

This was delish! Everyone loved it, especially my teenagers! I doubled the recipe. Since my cooking time needed to be shortened, I cooked it in the slow-cooker on high for an hour, omitting the coconut milk until I reduced the temp to low and cooked another five hours.

This dish was delicious but I suggest putting double the amount of chicken per the same amount of sauce. Also, my dish was done in five hours.

Made this last night.  The chicken was very tender but despite all of the flavors in the ingredients it was very blah.   I added more peanut butter as in the reviews I read that the flavor dissipated with cooking but I could barely taste it even at 2/3 of a cup.
I won't make again.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I cooked the chicken for only 4 hours on 'Low' in the crockpot, as I was afraid of overcooking the chicken.  As it turns out, 4 hours was right on the 'edge' of doneness; it probably would have been done at 3 1/2 hours on 'Low'.
My other comment is that the recipe was very bland.  It would require a lot of added spices to make it tasty.  I would not make this again, as written.

The basic recipe looked great but I didn't have the exact ingredients, however, I did have the ingredients suggested in one of the reviews (siracha instead of salsa,  creamy vs chunky peanut butter and whole fat coconut milk). I also omitted cilantro ( I can't stand the taste). I served it over plain white rice with broccoli and some sauteed mushroom slices. My spice loving family ate it all!

I was intrigued by this recipe, but the end result just didn't taste right to me.  I think it was the salsa.

OK, so this was pretty good!  I used chicken breasts because that's what I had.  I'm sure it would be great with thighs too!  I also used a can of light coconut milk.  Otherwise I made as written.  Served it over rice for my teenage son and over sauteed spinach for myself.  Could easily combine the two next time.

Wow, this was tasty, easy, and even my picky husband liked  it! He doesn’t like dark meat, so I made it with 1.5 lbs breast, 0.5 lb thighs. Otherwise, I made it just as the recipe said except I didn’t chop the peanuts for the topping, and only put the cilantro on my own serving. Very good when served over brown rice. It’s a keeper!

This recipe is fab on it's own but I prepare it differently. I marinate the thighs in sesame oil, sprinkled liberally with garage masala. I then place them into a 9 x 13 dish. I make the sauce on the stove, allowing me to tweak it. I pour the sauce on top and bake it in the oven at whatever temp that I have time for. I have used this method for other dishes and they are perfect every time! another fav is Evin's Indian apricot chicken on this site. Enjoy..you will not be disappointed!

I was very underwhelmed with the flavor.  It wasn't bad but I thought the sauce would be richer.  I even followed previous suggestions using more peanut butter and a whole can of regular coconut milk.

Love, love, love this!  I doubled the recipe and made it with boneless breasts which get done in under 4 hours.  Husband has a sesame allergy so we can't make many traditional Thai recipes, but this is a very close competitor to others with sesame.  Once I only had medium salsa so I added a 4 oz can of chopped jalapenos.  Not too hot for us, but might be too hot for some people.  This is SO fast--just stir all the ingredients together in a bowl and then poured the mixture over the breasts and let it do its magic.  The flavors are so addictive, and you can make a huge batch to take leftovers to work.

This was surprisingly good.  It is somewhat bland however.  I added some extra hot sauce and some thai spices.  My kids liked it too.  So easy to put together and versatile.  I like the idea of serving it with spinach like pictured, but I didn't try that.  Will need to try that next time I make it.

Just OK. Probably good for those with not very adventurous kids to feed. We found it lacked any depth and certainly was't Thai. I wish I had added some fish sauce.  I  we hadn't added handfuls of fresh spinach at serving time, it really would have been blah.

It tasted pretty good, but it didn't seem to have a ton of flavor. I don't know how much the choice of salsa affects the final flavor, but I would probably add more peanut butter, soy sauce, and salsa, along with some salt. If I have the ingredients on hand, I would make  it again. But, I wouldn't make a trip to the store just to make this again.

Loved this recipe!  Set out to follow the directions exactly, but being a "creative" chef... (haha) my variations ended up being: boneless skinless chicken breasts, no sugar, 1 can of reg coconut milk, 1 Tbsp fish sauce, 1 cup medium salsa, 1 tsp ground ginger, 2 Tbsp red curry paste, 3 large carrots sliced thin, 2 cups sugar snap peas and sliced green onions instead of cilantro along with the peanuts for garnish.  Served on Basmati rice... so delicious!

I definitely liked this recipe. I decided to try it because it had a long cook time; so many slow cooker recipes for chicken have a short cook time, defeating the purpose of a slow cooker. Anyway,the chicken turned out tender and tasty for all. The hot salsa doesn't make it weird or even that spicy. In fact, my husband reached for the crushed red pepper to add some kick. The extra peanuts and cilantro garnish are a must!

Served with coconut Basmati rice, stir fried veggies cooked in coconut oil... it was great!  I think I might add a little more sugar or maple syrup towards the end... maybe just another tsp. or so.

I wouldn't advise using the whole can of coconut milk. I did that based on some reviews and I wish I had followed the recipe as written. It dilutes the flavor and makes it runny. Just use the rest as part of the liquid in your rice. I also added garlic, a little fish sauce, and garlic chili paste to amp it up a bit, and because I had it handy. Also, searing the chicken first adds a layer of flavor and eye appeal. Cooked for 5 hours on high. Very good, tasty recipe!

I didn't like this recipe; the smell was terrible and I couldn't finish the dish. Not sure if i used the wrong brands for the ingredients but thinking about it, adding mild salsa, soy sauce, peanut butter, and  lime juice seems odd. Not very appetizing. If you make it listen to the suggestions others made before making it, it might help.

Made the few changes per other suggestions. 1/2 cup peanut butter, fish sauce, a whole can of coconut milk. I'll attempt it again. My husband and the baby enjoyed it. But it didn't get my twins approval ;) Oh and added Sriracha, that changed my rating to 4 stars instead of 3!

I added more coconut milk and sugar due to my family's tastes for Thai food from our neighborhood restaurant. I also added baby carrots and cut fresh spinach to get our veggies in there. I didn't have cilantro on hand.

I had high expectations for this recipe but I didn't care for it at all. I used full fat coconut milk and followed everything else and no one in my family cared for it. Not spicy enough for Thai.

I was worried about a strong coconut flavor from the coconut milk but it didn't taste coconutty at all.  

I basically doubled the recipe so I could use the whole can of coconut milk cause I don't know what I'd do with a half can of it.  I used a little more than twice as much chunky peanut butter cause I love peanut sauce and that flavor came thru wonderfully.  6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts cut into chunks and 6 cps of white rice was a perfect meal.  

I put all of it in the pressure cooker and used the pre-set button for chicken (20 min).  The chicken was tender and juicy, the sauce smooth and creamy.  We really loved it!!!

Amazing & super easy !  First time I made it with thighs and there was allot more fat to skim off. Second time with 3 large chicken breasts and cooked on low for only 3 hours so breasts were not to dry. Not enough kick the first time so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of chili flakes & a couple squirts of Sriracha !  Absolutely delicious ! Husband loves it & says it's his fave ! I serve it over jasmine rice or time noodles… Probably both! Shredded carrots, purple cabbage, and fresh sprouts with a slice of lime and it looks like it came from a restaurant :)

Made as directed and turned out great for me! I made a change and regret adding the carrots during cooking instead of on the side for added flavor. My husband doesn't like sweet meat dishes. The sugar in the carrots made it too sweet, especially the next day so he didn't eat it. I loved it.

I thought it was a really great recipe!  I made the following modifications for the sauce:  I used an entire can of coconut milk (regular, not lite), 1 tbsp of fish oil, and 2 tbsps of cilantro.  I only had Jiffy creamy peanut butter on hand so that's what I used.  I set the slow cooker for LOW for 8 hours.  

The chicken came out beautifully tender.  The sauce was a little thin so I took it out and reduced it (I put the chicken to the side as I didn't want to overcook it).  Another thing I noticed was that before and after the reduction, there were some areas where the peanut butter had not melted down all the way.  Although it was still delicious, I wish it had integrated a little bit better in the sauce.

The flavors were great.  Had a lot of depth and despite other reviews, I would say it had strong Thai flavors.  I will be making this again.

ok.. here is the trick that i found when making meals in a crockpot  that normally turn out watery and bland. i put chicken and bell peppers in the crockpot only!! i know it dosent call for bell peppers but my husband likes it. i put all the ingredients for the sauce mixture in one tubberware bowl and put it  in the fridge. I cooked the chicken for 6 hours on low. when i got home after working I  took the chicken out of the crockpot, poured out any liquid that was left  in the crockpot.  shredded the chicken, put the chicken back in the crockpot . retrieved the sauce mixture from the fridge and pour over the chicken and turn on high for about 20 minutes until hot.. the chicken turns out very tender even by cooking it by itself. you wont end up with a watery bland mess. what you get is a thick creamy sauce that retains all flavor because the sauce wasnt overcooked.  i also have a rice cooker that is programmable, so I can set it in the morning to have the rice cooker turn on at a certain time so I have hot rice ready with the meal.

Excellent dish, tried some of the optiins frim other reviews (i.e., coconut cream instead of fat free).  DO be aware of how much it thickens with that kind of change.  First time, 3 hrs on high, 30 min on low - perfect!  Second time, 7 hrs on low - overcooked but still edible.  Mix with rice and spinach...mmmmmmm.

Looked amazing, but just wasn't greater than the sum of its parts... I don't think it's the recipe's fault - this sauce is pretty good. Maybe crock pots are just not a great place to get exceptional flavor.

I thought this was very good. I doubled the sauce because we like a lot of sauce. I put in a dash of chili oil to give it a kick since I only had medium salsa. I like how easy it was to make. I served it over rice and steamed spinach and topped with green onions since I hate cilantro. I wanted to add fresh bean sprouts but I can't seem to find it in any local stores. I will make it again with the fresh sprouts when I find them.

I followed this recipe exactly. It's not bad, but if I made it again, I would add salt, less ginger, more lime, and more cilantro. I would also double the recipe to have some to freeze. This only made about 5 servings. And I didn't have any trouble with the sauce it thickened just fine.

Thank you for this recipe! And thanks to all those that commented. I followed the recipe relatively closely. However, I did use 1 cup of hot salsa instead of 3/4 cup,  and 1 cup of coconut cream instead of 3/4 cup of coconut water, and finally adding one tsp of  Sriracha sauce.  I used frozen boneless chicken thighs and at 6 1/2 hours on low. The chicken was in good shape and juicy, but after another 1 1/2 hours though, the chicken became a bit pasty. All in all, I loved it. The SO liked it too.  Aloha!

Delicious and so easy.  Perfect for a weeknight meal on a cold night.  I made some adjustments.  I always cook for 8 servings to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  I used 3.5 pounds of boneless thighs which I cut into cubes so they would absorb more of the flavors.  Since I had more meat, changed the quantities: 1 full can coconut milk (regular not lite), 1 cup medium salsa (cause that's all I had), juice from 1 lime, 1 tsp powdered ginger instead of fresh, and everything else the same.  I also added 1 tsp Thai red chili paste for a more authentic flavor and about half way through, added 4 small golden potatoes cut into 1" cubes.   Served this over rice and it was a huge hit with the whole family.  Enough for 4 meals and 4 lunches the next day.

This is a great recipe. The picture shows it served with spinach but the recipe does not call for it. I take fresh spinach and tear it up, then add it in after it is done cooking. I find that this tastes best after sitting over night.

this came out great! I wasn't super careful with measurements, used natural extra chunky peanutbutter, powdered ginger, cashew milk instead of coconut milk (it's what I happened to have in the fridge), and chicken breasts instead of thighs (i don't like bones in chicken). it came out like barbeque, we eat it on a roll with rice. it's definitely spicy, delicious, hearty home cookin'!

Delicious. I subbed chicken breasts and medium salsa with sriracha for heat. I also doubled the soy and lime, used the whole can of milk, and used 2 packets of equal for the sugar. I seasoned with garlic salt to taste at the end. Everyone love it, no leftovers.

This was absolutely fabulous!  Easy to mix together this morning and had a wonderful dinner when we got home.  The chicken wasn't dried out and the sauce thickened up nicely and wasn't runny like most crock pot sauces tend to be.  I used smooth peanut butter and honey instead of sugar, just because that's what we have use.  Definitely will be making this again & sharing the recipe!

This was really good.  I used smooth peanut butter and added some chopped peanuts (which was a nice salty addition).  I would have needed to add salt otherwise.  Used boneless thighs (about 1 1/2 lbs) but used the entire sauce mixture.  I did add the entire can of light coconut milk.  I added some steamed green beans and red pepper into the final dish and it really made it stand out - both in color and flavor.  Otherwise, its a pretty muddy brown looking dish.  Served over Jasmine rice, which was perfect.  This had a small amount of heat as is, but I added a couple squirts of sriracha to the plated dish and it was perfection.

This was a huge success. I substituted a homemade red pear and mango salsa, cutting the fruit into 1" cubes. Also used a full can of regular coconut milk, doubled the chunky peanut butter and the chicken which I cooked with the skin on, then removed the skin, shredded and added it back. Served over jasmine rice. Delightful.

I made this nearly as specified, and as it was it came out pretty bland. I only changed the time to 6 hours. As others have said, it was a great base to doctor up. At the end of the cooking time I removed the bones, shredded the chicken - it was very tender.  Then added the rest of the coconut milk, another Tbs of peanut butter, 1 tsp. salt, 2 tsp. chili/garlic sauce. I then stir fried 1 leek, 1 med tomato, 1 (mild) jalapeño, 1 red pepper in 2 tsp. olive oil. Added it to the top of the dish and served over the jasmine rice. It was excellent! Hubby loved it too!

Used mild salsa, what we had, so added sriracha hot sauce.  Used full can of coconut milk and added spinach in place of cilantro.  Served with brown rice from Ar.  Thickened with corn starch and cold water slurry .

I have made this recipe exactly as it is written, except to omit the cilantro (not a fan). I have also made it in my electric pressure cooker for 15 minutes with natural release. Both times, AMAZING! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great I substituted 2 Tbs Sriracha for the salsa and served over fresh spinach, sprouts, and jasmine rice.  It was great a full meal in one dish.

We liked it ALOT---having leftovers tonight, bet it'll be even better!  I followed the recipe as it is, can see it would be very easy to adjust it to taste--more peanut butter, more salsa, oh, I did use a peach/pineapple salsa which works for me, my husband added some chutney to the finished product:)

I love this recipe. I've made it twice with a few alterations. I have doubled the sauce both times and not really measured: used a jar medium salsa, a whole can full fat coconut milk, about half a jar of creamy pb, half a lime, about 4 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce, a dash of white sugar, a nice little chunk of fresh ginger grated, and added sriracha (about 4 tablespoons). The first time I used chicken breast cut up into bite size pieces and the second time I used boneless skinless thighs and did the same. I definitely enjoyed the thighs more. I also added half a sweet onion, a red bell pepper, and about a teaspoon of minced garlic.  Both times I cooked on high for about 4 and a half hours and served over jasmine rice with lots of chopped fresh cilantro and peanuts! This ones so easy and delicious, definitely a keeper!

This is a great combination of flavors. I added the entire can of milk and also doubled the peanut butter. I also added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and a big handful of chopped cilantro to the pot at the beginning because we love that flavor.The bag of chicken thighs that I pulled out of the freezer ended up being pork chops. I tossed them in the pot straight out of the freezer. I had gotten a late start on the meal so turned the pot to high and cooked for 4 hours. The chops were beautifully tender and the sauce was amazing. Served with a salad of fresh greens and it made a great meal.

My husband raved! I made some adjustments based on taste: added generous salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Added more peanut butter and whole can of coconut milk. Also added a ton of veggies which were great: red bell pepper, onion, broccoli, and frozen peas n carrots. Done in 3.5 hours on high! I used chicken breasts cut into strips.

This is a great kid-friendly and easy meal.  Don't expect fancy and amazing thai flavors.  Just simple, easy, and good.  I only had mild salsa on hand, and I added a bit extra peanut butter.  I served it over brown rice that I made with water and coconut milk.  I will make it again. I cooked mine on high for about 3 1/2 hours in the slow cooker.  Turned out great.

If you're looking for something different, this is it.  I find that my crock pot meals though quick and yummy are usually very similar.  This one is a nice change.  I used what I had on hand and subbed almond milk for the coconut and powdered ginger for fresh.  I also used half a bunch of cilantro and threw it in with the chicken to cook down.  I shredded the chicken when done and served over rice. I used chicken breast tenders so for my four year old, I fished one out before shredding.  She was able to eat that without it being too spicy.  My nine year old and hubby loved this dish and didn't think it was too spicy.  I loved it too!

This was just okay. It definitely needed more peanut flavor and it would have been pretty bland without the fresh cilantro. We served it over rice and it was ok. Probably won't make again but is worth a shot.

This was delicious!!!  I added a little more coconut milk and salsa and cooked it only 7 hours and it was perfect.  This recipe is a keeper. Made with jasmine rice as a side.  Next time will try with shrimp and noodles on the stove top.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was wonderful!  Has a fresh ginger taste with a hint of peanut.  The lime juice, cilantro, and chopped peanuts add a lot do don't skip them!!  I'm replacing my old crock pot Thai chicken recipe with this one.

Very tasty chicken with the deliciousness of the sweetened peanut sauce. I did not slow cook though but opted to use our grill. I made a big foil pocket and put chicken and sauce in the pocket and sealed it up securely. Indirect heat for about 30 minutes. Oh yum! Serve sauce over egg noodles.

Cooking time was WAY too long! My slow cooker was on about 6.5 hours and when I tasted the chicken it was already shamelessly soft. But the guests loved the flavor of the sauce--I added another cup of the chunky pb and some garlic, a touch of chili powder and some onion powder. Also threw in some matchstick carrots, frozen peas, potatoes and a bell pepper for more of a stew once I saw how disintegrated the chicken was. I wasn't nuts about it personally but the crowd loved it. Props.

I tried to make this as is, but had to make some minor adjustments for what I had on hand:  I used mild salsa + dash of chili pepper flakes, smooth, *real* peanut butter and full fat coconut milk, and I left off the peanut and cilantro topping.  Also, I cooked on low for only 6 hours and found that perfect for the chicken - it stayed very tenderly on the bone and was nicely moist.  Any more cooking and it would have fallen off the bone and/or dried out.  As for the finished dish:  while the depth of flavour was there with just the right amount of heat and sweetness, the peanut butter was WAY too overpowering for our taste.   Anyone using real peanut butter, I suggest you use 1/2 what the recipe calls for.  The sauce seemed to reduce nicely (something I don't often get out of a crockpot dish) so the thickness and consistency was good, but there wasn't a lot there.  If you want a saucy dish to pour over rice or noodles or to dip bread in, I suggest you double the sauce ingredients.  If I try this again I'll use 1/2 the peanut butter.  I agree with whoever said "it seems to be missing something" and definitely needs some tweaking which is beyond my skills.  Two and a half stars from me.  Would I pass this recipe along?  No.  But thanks for sharing, it was worth a try.

I loved this recipe.  I followed the one reviewer and used siracha instead of salsa, creamy peanut butter and no sugar.  The 2 TBS was a little too spicy for some members of my family so I might suggest using one and then having people add as they would like. I doubled the sauce for the chicken and we ate it kind of like a Thai curry. I also added slice onions and some sliced zucchini at the end so it was a complete meal with veggies.  It was a huge hit with the peanuts and cilantro on the top.

I thought this was a quick, delicious dinner! Super easy. I did as suggested and only used 1/2 of the salsa that it says too, and also used whole coconut milk along with creamy peanut butter. Oh and I added a couple tsps of crushed red pepper for a bit of spice. I doubled the sauce because we love extra sauce and the can was 13 ounces so it worked out perfectly. I used powdered ginger as I did not have fresh ginger. Flavor was still wonderful. I served this over rice noodles. I will be making this a regular slow cooker recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Didn't realize how much I loved this recipe until I made it multiple times- now a go-to for simplicity and flavour.  Have changed the ingredients depending on what was in the house (less lime, more lime, more salsa, milder salsa for risk adverse friends, added tabasco, added garlic, or added chili-garlic sauce)  Whatever you do it will taste good.  Have also made a vegan version with black beans instead of chicken- and have cooked it in a slow cooker, an instant pot and on the stove.

Love this easy to prepare recipe - I serve with instant rice and steamed broccoli - and whatever on hand (medium salsa, creamy pb, etc)

This is good and almost ends up tasting like a curry. For some reason, the sauce ended up burning a bit in my crock pot. Next time I'll make more sauce and I won't cook it as long.***update*** My crockpot is just hot, I think. Sauce won't burn if I stir it every now and then. Last time I didn't have 8 hours, so I put it on high for an hour and then on low for 3 more hours. Was great! I also added sliced bell peppers to the pot about half hour before eating. Carrots and broccoli are a great addition too!

We have doubled this recipe twice. The first time, we didn't have ginger, so we used curry. YUM! This time, I used part curry, part ginger, YUM! You could even do some other fun stuff here. But, as is, this recipe is a WINNER! My husband, who is kina picky, asks me to make it all the time! One thing we never have is lime, so the line juice has never been added. It doesn't matter. Serve it by itself or put it over rice or noodles. Kids will love this, too. I think if kids are involved, you might want to hold back on the spices a bit. This is one of our favs!

This was a great recipe.  I had to modify based on ingredients on-hand.  I didn't have coconut milk - I swear I did at some point.  Anyway - I used a Thai curry jarred sauce I had on hand with coconut milk in it.  I used half the ginger because I was fearful of being too spicy but I will go with recommended 2 TBL next time.  Also, I had a whole chicken which I split down the middle & flattened out and it took little more than 1/2 the time recommended.   

Served over brown rice with sauted veggies on the side & salad.

The reason I gave it a 4 star and not 5 is the sodium level is extremely high so use low sodium where you can. The fat level was a bit much - but it didn't stop me from enjoying the recipe.  Thanks for the idea!!

Bland. Sadly, *woefully* bland. I made this dish using suggestions from the most helpful reviewers and added vegetables (potato, red bell pepper, carrots, and onion).  I used 3 TBSP of Sriracha instead of the salsa, brown sugar instead of white, and 1 can of full-fat coconut milk. I cooked on high for 4 hours. The curry never thickened. The only thing that saved the dish was adding curry powder and salt to our plates.  My husband and I love Thai food, and we were very disappointed.

This was so good! The entire family enjoyed it. It was even better the next day. I used peach mango salsa because that's what I had, but didn't change anything else. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I like the taste of a Pad-Thai dish however this missed the mark for me. I followed the directions and when I got home it was burning around the edges of crock pot and I had to add more liquid. There seemed to be a missing flavor or something. The chicken did not hold up whole like the picture shows, it fell apart like pulled pork so there were no whole pieces of chicken.

This was a recipe that was a great try. My husband and I enjoyed it but the kids didn't like it. I definitely want to try it again with some changes for my kids. I appreciate the flavor :-)

This is a go to recipe for me. We love it in my family. We do add sambal olek after cooking to individual taste to spice it up.

I have to first say that none of my children liked this dish-but they are 9 and under. They couldn't get past the looks of it. That being said, I used lite coconut milk and mild salsa and i really enjoyed the flavor. The thighs were a little overcooked at 8.5 hrs on low so i would probably try to go 7.5 hrs and shred them when done cooking. Also, my husband thought that the leftover sauce could be used as the base for a soup; there was a lot of extra sauce. I thought that the sauce would be good on something crunchy like napa or savoy cabbage.

sooo yummy! I was missing some key ingredients and had to substitute them, but it turned out very good regardless, and I can't wait to try it out with all the right ingredients!
I didn't have any coconut milk so I substituted yogurt. I used mild salsa instead of hot b/c I never have the hot stuff in my house! so I put a little chili pepper flakes on top when it was in the crock pot.  I just saw now that I also had forgotten to put soy sauce in!!! :( well I just can't wait to try it out again it'll be so much better!I didn't have cilantro either. and I used lemon juice instead of lime. 
It was all very saucy, so delicious, we used the extra sauce to put over the rice. I made basmati rice with curry and also put some peas & carrots in it.

Replaced the salsa with sarachi. Very good. Husband and I love Thai and this is a great crock-pot at home substitution!

This is one of the best dishes I've come across on this site! It was absolutely wonderful, and just enough spice! As most people so, I "doctored" it up a little bit... adding the full can of coconut milk and a tad bit more peanut butter... but other than that I wouldn't have changed a thing! I will double my recipe next time because me and my boyfriend we're very upset when we ran out of leftovers!!!

I thought this recipe sounded great.  However, I used the recommended cooking time and the sauce tasted burnt and had darkened on the bottom of my crock pot.  In addition, there was a lot of fat in the sauce.  Next time I wll reduce cooking time and will also use boneless skinless.  With a little tweaking, this recipe will be a keeper for us.

I did not find a lot Thai about this recipe.  It was not as flavorable as I expected it to be.
