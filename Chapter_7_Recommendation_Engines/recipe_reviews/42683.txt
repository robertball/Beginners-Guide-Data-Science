I wasn't able to find a fresh pumpkin anywhere for Thanksgiving, so I substituted one 19 oz. can of pumpkin in this recipe. It was absolutely fantastic; spicy, rich, and not too sweet. My mom, who thought she didn't like pumpkin pie, had two pieces.

This tastes like any other pumpkin pie with the crunch of pecans.  It is good.  I recommend using a pie crust shield or tinfoil around the outer crust to prevent overbrowning.  Also, I recommend cooking the pumpkin using the microwave method as it saves over an hour of time even if you have to cook the pumpkin in batches.

i LOVED this recipe!  the time was totally worth it.  not to mention the roasted pumpkin seeds (w/tobasco soy sauce & ancho chile powder!) we snacked on all weekend.  this was the best pumpkin pie i've ever had.

VERY VERY GOOD recipe.  Made this for my mom with a wheat crust and no pecans and it was delicious.  It was even chosen by some over the regular pumpkin pie.  Very yummy.

It was okay, the honey flavor was a change from the usual pumpkin pie flavor.  We certainly ate the whole pie, but I won't be making this again.

This was just okeh. Next time, I'll double the amount of pecans and honey to improve the texture and the flavor.
