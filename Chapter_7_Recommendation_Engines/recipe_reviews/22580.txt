Very easy.  Similar to a 7 layer bar, but less involved.

I thought these were just okay, but everyone else in my family loved them.  I substituted peanut butter chips for the walnuts.  It's a nice change from the regular cookie bars, but I think the seven layer magic cookie bars beats all.

I have made these bars for two family gatherings and there is never a crumb left! Everyone raves about them and constanlty asks, "when are you gonna make more cookie bars?".

I like the ways these tasted, but were not as good as I thought. My oldest boys thought they were awful, but the younger ones loved them. I had a problem with them sticking to the pan,too.

OK, but thiner than I expected to, and way too chocolatey. Decrease the amount of chips by 1/2. Mine tended to be too browned 5 to 10 minutes before requested cooking time. Good, but not to die for.

These turned out kind of dry and our guests barely touched them.  I was disappointed.  Tasted okay, but the presentation is not appealing at all.

I have had mixed responses from this recipe. Personally I didnt really like it, but have been told by others that it was delicious. I mucked it up a bit by using baking M&M's instead of the chocolate chips and they turned the topping a strange green colour. If there is a next time I will use chocolate chips or else just sprinkle the M&M's over the top before baking instead of mixing them in.

What a wonderful recipe. So easy to bake - and the crust on the bottom added a real extra something to the final result. Just over an hour from start to finish (including baking): but leave it to cool. A moist, chewy consistency - and it actually looked like the photo! Perfect cookie bars for any occasion. 5 stars.

This is a great recipe.  My two young boys helped me whip these together.  We added some white chocolate chips because I didn't have enough chocolate chips.  I know it will be a recipe that friends will ask me for.  Very scrummy!

My 4 year old daughter helped me make these bars.  My dh who is not a cookie guy loved them!  My daughter and I will be making them again soon.  Not only are they easy to make but there was little mess in the kitchen!

VERY easy to put together - all the ingred. already on hand! I followed other suggestions and substituted some butterscotch chips (about 1/2 cup)and it was very tasty - must have milk close by! Next time I might bake it a couple minutes less to soften the crust up a little more, but that's personal preference.

I thought these were great as did my kids.  Can't imagine anyone saying they are horrible unless they goofed and put evaporated milk in instead of sweetened condensed (I did this once is why I thought of it). Anyway, tasty alternative to the normal bars I make. Will definetly make these again.

Turned out great.  I used fat free condensed milk and added a generous sprinkle of Heath almond toffee bits to the top before baking. They looked and tasted great.  Everyone really enjoyed them.

These bars are good, but way too sweet!  They were very easy to prepare.  I think if I ever made them again I would cut the amount of chocolate chips in half and use light sweetened condensed milk.

I left them in the oven for 2 minutes too long.  But you know, they're actually pretty good with a "crunchier" top, too!  However long you bake them, these are fantastic.  A great non-messy snack for work or school, and everybody always wants the recipe.

This is a good recipe to make when you are short on time, as it requires very little prep before going into the oven.  However, if given ample time I'd probably make something else.  I think that "7 Layer" or Magic Bar cookies are better.

My daughter absolutely loved these.  I don't like a whole lot of chocolate so next time I will use half the amount of chocolate chips.  This was a good recipe.
