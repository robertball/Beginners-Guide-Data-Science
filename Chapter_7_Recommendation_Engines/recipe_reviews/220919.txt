Oh my gosh is this good!  I made a couple minor tweaks to make this real-food friendly: I subbed 100% whole wheat pasta, used 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained very well) since tomatoes are not in season, and used home-made buttermilk ranch dressing in place of the mayo.  I thought it was a tad bland with just mayo.  The veggies blend together perfectly, I wouldn't leave any of them out!

Excellent!  I added celery and used only bell pepper since I didn't have the other peppers. Will make it again. Thanks!
