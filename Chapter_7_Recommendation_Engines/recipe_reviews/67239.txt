FABULOUS!  Moist and delicious!  I upped the healthiness by using 25% bean flour (the rest I used 60% w/w), cutting the sugar in half and using unsweetened orange juice instead of beer.....

This turned out great!  I didn't have that many sweet potatoes left over, so I halved the recipe and made it into cupcakes - these only take about 16 minutes to bake, depending on how gooey your batter is.  Also, I added a lot more cinnamon - yum!

This was a great recipe and just in time for the holiday leftovers. It also freezes well. A hit with the entire family.

Do it with carrots!  I had some leftover carrots that I needed to use up, and so I cooked and mashed them and used them in place of the sweet potatoes and it came out so delicious. My kids are already asking for another piece.  I did made a few changes- I used only 1 cup white sugar and I had added a 1/2 cup brown sugar to the carrots which made the cake the perfect amount of sweet.  I was out of eggs so I substituted mayo (which i have done several times with cakes and it works great) about 4TBSP, I just eyeball it.  The beer is completely  unnecessary so I omitted it and nothing tasted like it was missing. If your batter needs thinning, milk works great in place of the beer, but I only used a little- not a complete half cup. My carrots had extra moisture and my batter was perfect.  No icing necessary, but u could use it if you wanted extra sweetness.  A great versatile recipe, thanks!

Delicious! Very moist and not too sweet.  Will definitely make it again and again.  I made a few changes to make it healthier: I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Loved it!

Mmmm these are delicious! I made a huge thing of sweet potato casserole the other day and it was way too much to eat so I made this recipe into tasty little cupcakes to share with my class tomorrow :)

Mouth watering. Super easy to make. Got rave reviews from family & fiends. People are starting to think I can cook. Taste great even without beer.

I halved the recipe and made this with 3/4 cup mashed kabocha squash. I used 2 eggs, apple cider instead of beer, half whole wheat flour half all-purpose flour and half olive oil and half canola oil for the oil portion. I baked them in a mini muffin pan at 350 for 10 minutes. I came out with 48 total for just half the recipe! They came out great with soft fluffy centers and nice crispy tops. My boyfriend who hates squash even like them.

AWESOME cake.  'Nuff said.  :-)  Well, I guess I will share my modifications.  I did not have plain sweet potatoes leftover.  However, I did have some sweet potato casserole...2 cups to be exact.  And mine wasn't the marshmallow-topped kind.  It had a simple topping of butter, brown sugar, and sugar and cinnamon Ritz crackers.  So this is what I used.  I did not have beer on hand, so I used some coconut milk instead, which had been hanging around in my fridge for quite a while.  And I actually took the salt level up to 3/4 tsp.  I ALWAYS used this much salt, sometimes a full tsp., anytime there is cinnamon being used.  It enhances the flavor so much, and it helps to cut through the sugar.  Cinnamon will make sugary things taste sweeter and sometimes overbearing.  I only used about 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  I don't even really think it was necessary, but then again my casserole had vanilla and cinnamon added to it in the beginning.  I only used 1/2 C. of oil as well and subbed in 1/4 C. of applesauce, just because.  And for the sugar, I used a full cup of white and the rest brown.  The cake was so delightfully moist, and it does not need a frosting of any kind.  I did put a cinnamon glaze over it just for added pizazz.  I'm going to post this on my bundt cake blog.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous idea!

this cake was very good and moist. the only things i changed were using 1c white sugar and 3/4c brown sugar, and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. i used a chocolate stout beer, and the cake had a wonderful richness to it. i just used roasted sweet potato (no sugar or butter already added in) and the cake was plenty sweet enough. thanks so much for sharing this recipe, i will certainly use this again.

DELICIOUS! I made the following modifications: decreased the sugar to 1/2 + 1/8 cup due to the fact that my sweet potato casserole already had sugar in it and in the topping which consisted of pecans, brown sugar, butter and cornflakes. Then I used orange juice in place of the beer. When it was done baking (about 35 minutes), I made a glaze using milk and confectioner's (aka powdered) sugar and poured it on top - Oh my taste buds was it GOOD! My husband even ate it and he doesn't normally like anything with sweet potatoes in it! I will definitely be using this recipe year after year! Shared it on facebook too!

This was great and easy to make.  The house smelled incredible while it was baking. I followed the recipe but I did add a sprinkle of nutmeg. My daughter and husband would not eat a sweet potato if they were starving. So,  I called it a cinnamon/spice cake and never told them what was in it.  They raved about it and couldn't get enough. Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is DELICIOUS. I had an entire crock pot full of leftover sweet potato casserole after Thanksgiving and I used it all to make several loaves of this cake. 

The only change I made to the recipe was to cut the sugar by about 1/3 because there was already a lot of sugar in the leftover casserole I used.

This recipe is fantastic and freezes beautifully. It gets devoured every time I take it to work.

This was delicious!  I had a lot of sweet potatoes on hand so was looking for a recipe to use them in. The only change I made in the recipe was to use about a 1/2 cup of brown sugar in addition to the white sugar and I used root beer instead of beer to get the wonderful foaming action in the batter. Will definitely make this again!

OK, so I don't bake often but I always end up throwing away my sweet potato casserole leftovers (I always make too much).  SO when I saw this recipe I was intrigued.  OMG this is the best cake ever.  AND for those of you who decide to omit the beer for something else - you are missing out on the rising effect of the CO2 with the baking powder and soda.  This was the lightest, airiest, most moist cake EVER.  Thank you for the recipe - this will be a day after thanksgiving tradition from now on!!!

AMAZING and another 5 stars!! An extremely 'flexible' recipe as well - one person's review said they added some cooked carrots. I only had about 3/4 cup sweet potatoes left, but  had alot of regular mashed potatoes so figured it was worth the try and substituted the remainder w/those and mixed in some molasses to sweeten them up. I also added a little ginger and nutmeg, just cuz I like those flavors. THANK YOU MLYIN for the DELICIOUS and CREATIVE way to use up leftovers!

Oh WOW- this was incredibly good!  I had extra sweet potatoes (about 2 1/2 cups total), so I just left out the beer, which worked out fine.  Also, since my sweet potatoes were not pre-sweetened, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  Everyone LOVED this- thank you!!

My goodness these were perfect! I was skeptical about the beer that my husband happened to be drinking when I was making it, but oh my we're they delicoous! I'm sure any milk in place of beer would do just as well though.

My brother asked me to make a Sweet Potato Cake he saw on a Paula something cook show, so after reading the recipe I knew I wasn't going to like it. So I made both, hers and this one. I followed this recipe almost to the T. The only thing I changed was that I used a can of sweet potatoes instead of cooking them myself. I took both cakes to the Thanksgiving dinner party and this one was a hit. It was gone before the other one was even 1/4 eaten. It is very moist and super delicious. Next time I will make it with Splenda as I am diabetic and shouldn't be eating this (but it is so good).

I was skeptical when I saw the beer and all the Baking powder and soda, but it was delicious. It wasn't very sweet because my potatoes weren't; and since I had pecans in my potatoes, I added more to this recipe. I will add more spices next time though.

YUM! Made it with applesauce instead of oil, and like another reviewer, opted for an extra 1/2 cup of sweet potatoes in place of the beer. I did have to increase the baking time by a full ten minutes. I put a little extra vanilla and cinnamon and WOW, WOW, WOW, this was GREAT!!! I think next time I will try baking the same recipe in my largest casserole dish so it will be slightly thinner and then see how it does cutting it as bars instead of pieces of cake. Oh, I also added chopped pecans to mine. GREAT!!!!!!!!!

I used 3 cups sweet potatoes and 1.5 other ingredients plus a few pecans.  I had chopped and frozen leftover sweet potatoes at Christmas - go from freezer to the boiling water to avoid browning - so I ended up with enough batter for the bundt cake and six large muffins.

Cooked cake about 55 minutes and muffins about 25 minutes.

Yummmy!

Just made this recipe this morning. Based on previous reviews, used one cup white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. Also used half a cup of natural applesauce instead of oil. Pleasantly sweet enough. Used a half cup of whole wheat flour with the remaining amount all purpose. Not heavy at all. Did not need to add the beer or any other liquid to thin the batter. Used an ice cream scoop to fill mini bundt pans (about cupcake size). Baked them for approximately 18 minutes. Great consistency. Lacked a little in taste without icing or powdered sugar. Will add nuts and/or raisins next time.

I can't stop making this cake and people can't stop asking me to. I pride myself on making good homemade cakes. But this cake even my 14 yr.old has declared her favorite! For me this is not a "left over" sweet potato cake, as coming from the South, sweet potatoes done right never last to be "left over". Therefore starting with fresh sweet potatoes, boiled and mashed I take the sugar up to 2 cups, using 1 cup of granulated white sugar and 1 cup of firmly packed light brown sugar. This amount of sugar is typical for any homemade cake. I also use 2 tsp. of vanilla and about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. This cake is super moist and can stand on it's own. However to really take it over the moon, and make my Southern Mama proud, I make a super light and very fluffy homemade cream cheese frosting. From the first slice, even the cake plate is barely left over.

LOVED that this recipe is dairy-free without any changes!  I used light beer because I didn't want any bitter taste.  I wasn't sure about beer in a cake, but it turned out great. I did trade some of the sugar for sorghum and added some ginger, just for a little more gingerbread flavor.  I was thinking that this would be good with cream cheese or cinnamon buttercream frosting, but I've alread eaten half of the cake!  I will have to make this again and make some frosting before I eat the whole thing.

Cut all ingredients by 1/3 for a square cake pan.  I substituted spiced rum and fresh squeezed OJ for the beer, substituted 1 stick of melted butter for 1/2 cup of oil.  Elderly folks need the flavor and the calories, only eat small pieces, so no guilt!

This was an easy~ pleasy recipe for leftover sweet potatoes! Wonderful as the creative chef intended, yet allows for plenty of room to play. Short on flour, I added store bought pancake batter and lessened the baking powder/ and soda. I chose to "sacrifice" my spiced craft beer for the greater good. To brighten the sweetness (and enjoy one more fun fizz) I squeezed a splash of fresh lemon into the brew. A total hit with all of my munchers! For my frosting-fiend I whipped up some Arla cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract and confectioners sugar for her to smear at will. Thank you for your lovely share... and making me look good. :)

This cake was delicious. I used baking powder instead of baking soda, you never realize you are out of baking soda until you need it. Topped it off with a maple butter frosting.

Recipe is great not just for using up leftover mashed sweet potato but also whole sweet potatoes. I used two large sweet potatoes, poked holes with a fork and microwaved them for 10 minutes (flipping sides halfway through). Then I cut the potatoes in half and scraped out the soft part inside with a fork.  This is actually healthier without the usual extra butter or sugar in mashed potato.  I also think the beer made the cake. Ice and fluffy.  I needed to use a larger 9x13 pan though.  Came out amazing and will definitely make it again!

It turned out well took a little longer to cook because I guess because I used peanut oil instead. It is what I had on hand. Everything else was the same it rose really high. I had nuts in my sweet potatoes so that added and I had a crunch. It is a great way to use leftovers and not end up throwing them away.

Used 3/4 cup brown sugar plus 1 cup white.  1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  Sprinkle sanding sugar on top before adding vanilla glaze.

Thank you MLYIN for this recipe!  I had a bunch of sweet potatos that I needed to use before they went bad and this cake was perfect for that!  I roasted my potatos for about an hour at 350 and then mashed them up.  I only used 1 1/2 cup sugar as that was plenty and added 1/4 cup of greek yogurt too.  I totally forgot to add the beer but still turned out delicous!  I think I like sweet potato cake better than pumpkin cake!  So moist and flavorful, you will never know it's sweet potatos in it!

Amazing! Super moist! I subbed sugar for a combo of agave & stevia. I also milled 1 cup of oatmeal(i used quick oats)and used that instead of 1 cup of flour. I'm wondering if using pumpkin will work out as well too!

I made this for Christmas so that my little grandson could have some healthy cake.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour & 1 cup unbleached flour, extra spices, and orange juice instead of beer.  It tasted wonderful!  Moist and delicious & it freezes well too.  A few people were scared to try it but once I convinced them most of them enjoyed the cake.  Thanks!

I just made this last night and SOOO LOVED it. I'm going to make it for Christmas also. I had so much sweet potatoes left over. I need something to do with them. THIS was PERFECT, very moist, delicious and so easy to make. Even my boyfriend loved it and he doesn't like Sweet Potatoes.

I turned this recipe into muffins for an easy-to-eat-on-the-road snack and they came out perfectly! I used up all of our leftover sweet potato casserole and half a Newcastle Brown Ale in the batter (drank the other half). Added a cup of golden raisins and sprinkled demerara sugar on the tops for a little texture...and voila! The BF is raving about them...

I made this yesterday, and it came out very tasty. It was a little flate for some reason, but I did swap the oil for applesauce, and used egg beaters instead of eggs, plus I sweetened with splenda (my sister is diabetic) and used whole wheat white flour. Maybe one of those swaps didn't let it puff up like it should. I might use this same recipe for a sweet potato quick bread.

What a great recipe!  Used up plain leftover sweet potatoes!  It was soooo good!  Thanks!
