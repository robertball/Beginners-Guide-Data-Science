Excellent flavor, my family is Italian(calabrese) and we eat TONS of Italian food. Had this dish many times in resturants and my family said this was even better than the resturants. I really only did a couple things different. My chicken breasts are ussually big so I split them and beat them for tenderness. I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper and garlic instead of the chicken. Doubled the wine and lemon(since I had more chicken and we love sauce). At the end I thought the sauce was a little thin so I thickened it up with a teaspoon or so of cornstarch just so that it was a little bit thicker. Great recipe though, thanks Mel!

So very very good! I did change some things....I didn't have white wine or capers. As I was too lazy to go shopping, I added onions, a little jalapeño, and a dab of honey to the butter lemon sauce and puréed it a bit. I also used some of the lemon zest. Served it over rice with some steamed broccoli. Absolutely delicious! Will be making this again.

This recipe was a great addition to our 'special dinners'. I seasoned the flour with a little smoked paprika & granulated garlic & switched out the regular lemons for Meyer lemons since they are less acidic and a touch sweeter. I also doubled the white wine and added 2 tablespoons of honey. No capers in my house, either! Holy cow this turned out fantastic! The Meyer lemons really upped the flavor of this already tasty dish.

I used butter flavored olive oil & did not add the extra butter.  I also left out the capers.  My whole family really liked it.  Very lemony.  If I make it again, I may add some cream and corn starch to thicken the sauce.

Nothing super special about this one....it is essentially chicken picatta.  Good for a weekday entree imo.

I used sliced up boneless chicken breast and thighs. This meant that I ended up with less liquid in the end so I simply added more wine with the butter to make the sauce. I also used coconut oil instead of olive oil and it worked just fine. Topped with sautéd mushrooms. Yummmm

I have made chicken piccata numerous times, but it usually has chicken broth. I made this version and it was far more lemony and much less salty than the others, which we liked. I don't use flour, so to thicken the sauce, I added a bit of cornstarch at the end of the cooking time.  Served over spaghetti squash and it was excellent.

My entire family loves this chicken.  I have it with very light sauce over fresh spinach, as a salad, and my kids have it with pasta; we all love it.

Way too much lemon.  We could hardly eat it. It tasted like straight lemon. I think it would be fantastic with less lemon.

Excellent recipe that the whole family enjoyed.  I made the following changes:  1) seasoned the flour instead of the meat with Tuscan Garlic seasoning blend, 2) added lemon zest to the sauce.  I will definitely add this one to my monthly rotation.

I made this thinking it would be wonderful however, I’m not sure where I went wrong. The sauce was so tart and acidic I could hardly eat it, was like biting straight into a lemon. I even upped the wine to lemon ratio and added broth so that I’d have more sauce for pasta. Once juiced I had 1/2 c. Lemon juice, plus used 3/4 c. Wine and about 1/3 c. Broth. I don’t know if the lemons I used were extra juicy and I had too much or what but it was overpowering to say the least. I want to attempt this one again but use only a couple tablespoons of lemon juice and increase the wine and broth even more.

This was pretty good. I didn't have lemons, so used lemon juice, I may have overdone it, but it was still pretty tasty. The sauce was very good. 
Beat the chicken thin, and it cooks faster and more uniformly.

This was delicious!  Both my husband & 5yr old cleaned their plate. The only change I made is I omitted the capers (don't like).  And next time I will cut back on the butter.

This turned out great for my Dad's 47th Birthday. I did double the white wine and lemon as well as add the the caper and let them sit a little while longer than suggested. Than about a half of cup heavy whipping cream to the sauce mixture, let it thicken and  ta-da. It is a great recipe just readjusted it a little.
