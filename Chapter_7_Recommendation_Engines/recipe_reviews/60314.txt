I just wanted to say that I submited this recipe, and originally I advised the use of 'tahini' - Middle Eastern susame paste traditionally used in flavoring gyros - but it was changed by the site into plain yogurt, which I think does a disservice to this recipe. In general, the addition of tahini all over the Middle East gives that final extra kick to the otherwise rather bland taste of grilled gyros. Also, lamb gyros is much more fragrant and robust than chicken one, so its even more important for the chicken one to have a right condiment.

These were OK, but I prefer a more mediteranean taste.  Try marinating your chicken breast strips in olive oil, lemon, oregano, parsley, garlic and a dash of pepper. We prefer tzaziki sauce, tomatoes, onion and a bit of lettuce if you like.  It's also really good if you charcoal a whole chicken (or buy one from Costco!) and strip the meat - dark and white from the chicken and use it for the gyros.  We called these Chicken Souvlaki in Australia.  Try serving with Tabouli salad and hummus on the side for a nice summer meal!

This was a tasty dinner.  My husband said it reminded him of the Turkish "kebabs" he enjoyed in Germany.  I warmed the pita pockets in a grill pan on the stove top, cut 1/4 off the top, lined the inside with romaine lettuce leaves (while the pita is still warm and flexible!), added in the tasty broiled chicken and topped it with "Tzatsiki Sauce" (also from this website) instead of yogurt. It was such a wonderful blend of warm and cool flavors. Thanks ITSIE! We'll be making this again.

I was skeptical about the sauce on these gyros, because it didn't strike me as the flavors we look for in a good gyro. My experimental nature prevailed, and I'm glad it did! These were great! Really hit the spot for our patio lunch. Thanks ITSIE.

I strongly suggest that a glass baking dish NOT  be used for this recipe. Glass dishes are not made for broiling and cannot withstand the high heat.Please use a metal baking pan for safety!!! I have not yet tried this recipe but it sounds delicious!

These were deicious and very quick and easy to make.  The only recommendation I would make is to use tzatziki instead of just plain yogurt.  I prefer Alton Brown's very simple tzatziki recipe.

Made this tonite and the whole fam loved it.  I let the chicken marinade for about 1/2 hour then grilled it.  It was very moist and had a terrific flavor.  It definitely needed salt and pepper to finish the seasoning.  I served it with Tzatziki V11 from this site instead of the plain yogurt.  I made only half a recipe of tzatziki and we had plenty.  This was a great recipe as well and complemented the gyros perfectly.

This was great!  A little different than traditional gyros, but the blend of spices made this dish delicious!  The 3 chicken breasts I used were rather large, and the ratio of sauce to meat looked a little deficient, so I doubled the sauce recipe...this is definitely a "make-again" recipe in our house!

3 stars only because it was edible - but it was nothing like I think gyros taste like. It tasted more like chicken saty, but wasn't even that good. Nobody went back for seconds.

This is a really great recipe!  I made a few changes, but pretty much stayed on course.  I used chicken tenderloin instead of whole breast... just my preference. I didn't have curry powder, but I had some Knorr-Swiss aromatic seasoning which has curry in it.  I used red cider vinegar instead of white.  Instead of marinating for just a few minutes in the pan, I put the marinade and chicken into a large Ziploc bag and marinated for 3 hours.  I found that 15 minutes on the "low" broil setting was perfect.  I served with Tzatziki II sauce and a Spanokorizo recipe, both found here on Allrecipes.com.  Some grilled pita bread drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt rounded out the meal. The kids loved this and raved for an hour!  Highly recommended.

Was really surprised and pleased with these!  I was very skeptical of the idea of "chicken" gyros. But the tasted turned out great. I used chicken tenderloins, which provide the perfect size strip for a pita. Also, didn't have curry on hand, so mixed up some cumin, coriander, red/black pepper and ginger, and the taste was great. Even my picky husband loved the flavor. I used the regular lf yogurt, and while it was missing the cucumber taste of real tzitiki (sp?), the sour of the yogurt really complimented the chicken.   I grilled some red and yellow peppers, and dipped those in the extra yogurt, made up some couscous, and we had a great meal!

Have to agree with most that this does not taste like a gyros. Was pretty good, served on pita with a cucumber dressing. Don't think I'll make again unless I have a hankering for curry!

Easy great recipe.  I let the chicken marinate in some of the yogurt and added some 1/4 tsp of cardamom just 'cause I can't resist fiddling.  But will definately make this recipe again and again.

We didn't have any pita bread, so we wrapped these in flour tortillas! They were great! We will be making these again (hopefully with pitas next time!). Thanks, Itsie!

I cut my chicken too thin so it cooked fast and ended up a little dry; like the author warned.  So I'm going to try it again sometime.  My husband really liked it, especially with the taziki sauce we found at the grocery store.  I was surprised this recipe didn't have more flavor, but like I said, I'm going to try it again because I think I goofed a bit.

I made the marinade and put it on the chicken a few hours before I cooked the chicken. My "taste tester's" loved it! I made the Tzatziki Cucumber sauce to go with it. So Yummy!!

These were delish! Made according to the recipe and they were awesome. Instead of grilling the chicken on the grill outside I used a grill pan on the stove. Very nice flavor. I also grilled the onions to add a little sweetness to them.

I didn't care for it but that could be because I didn't use the ketchup.  I even made Tzatziki sauce to go over it.  It just seemed very bland.

I "cheated" and used two large cans of canned chicken chunks. Put the marinade over the top and broiled them just long enough to heat them through and start to get crispy. I also used flour tortillas rather than pitas because it's what we had. Added some yellow bell pepper strips too. They were excellent! Everyone that tried them liked them and my picky kids even ate some!

Very good! I thought about cucumber sauce, and then sour cream, but went with the yogurt and was surprised that it still tasted wonderful. I think I'll add some onions next time around.

I found this to be average. My husband thought the taste was a little off. The plain yogurt didn't add much. Maybe adding some dill to the yogurt would have helped. It was fast and easy but those are the only high points we walked away with after trying this.

I am giving this three stars only becaue my picky 5 year old liked it. My DH drowned it with the yogurt I took one bite and nearly choked. The curry is overwhelming. I won't be making this again.

the marinade was good, but I must say that in Montreal there is a plentitude of Lebanese food.  From which, Gyros are usually only called such if made w/ Lamb and this would be considered souvlaki.  Nonetheless, I added a lot of garlic powder to the yogurt and topped pitas with onions & fresh tomatoes.  As it is frequently served w/ roasted-style potatoes, I did so.  Very tasty meal, but needed some major additions!

These were pretty good but missing something in the marinade.  I even let the ckn marinate for about 4 hrs and still it didn't have much flavor to me.  Will be sure to get more sturdy pitas next time.  Try it with Greek style yogurt (thicker consistency, like sour cream).  Pretty good!

This was only okay - no wow factor. Adults liked, kids did not.

I haven't had time to do more than sample the chicken, but it tastes delicious!  I made it as the recipe calls for, but grilled the chicken strips rather than broil them...very yummy and tender.  I made cucumber sauce to serve on it with greens and rice.  I'm looking forward to dinner!

Tasty, fast, easy dinner or lunch.  Even the kids liked it!  We needed to add a little salt for our taste.  It would taste even better if it was grilled.

De-lish!!  I did follow others' advice and used a tzatziki recipe (I used Greek tzatziki from this website) instead of plain yogurt.  I also cut the yogurt a bit and replaced it with sour cream.  I set oven to broil LO and put them in for 10-15 minutes since it was small pieces.  Make sure to spoon some of the pan juices onto each sandwich and enjoy!!

I used the basis of the recipe. Used dry mustard, curry, garlic powder, red pepper flake, lemon pepper, italian seasoning blend and marinated over night with about a tablespoon of olive oil. Served on greek pita that i put on a low broil in oven to give pitas a little crunch. Garnished with lettuce, onion and taziki sauce from trader joes grocery store. Great flavor

Tasty marinade for sure! We grilled the chicken strips instead and enjoy the flavour of the chicken very much! Thank you for a very tasty chicken dish that is good for company too!

These were good, but not spectacular.  The family said I could make it again, but no one was raving.  I marinated the chicken for 8hrs

This most definately did not taste like any Gyro that we have ever eaten.  My family asked that I not make it again.  Tasted more like an imitation barbeque sauce type marinade. The only savior was adding Tzatziki sauce instead of yogurt.
