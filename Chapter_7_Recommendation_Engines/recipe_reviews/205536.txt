Not a bad cucumber salad, a bit different from what I'm used to, I feel it needed something, I did add a extra dash of hot pepper sauce, a little bit more water. There wasn't any juice to this salad, so I wasn't sure extactly if that was right. It's seasoned for sure, dressed??? I'm not so sure. But it's a decent light summery salad for sure. Do try. Will make again and play around with the flavor more. Thanks

I have made my own version of this salad for my family. The addition of fresh parley, some onion and maybe more lime juice for a tangy flavour. Grating the cucumber or leaving it till it absorbs the liquid  may also help  the flavors. Bye

As is there is not too much flavor going on. I ended up adding a LOT more hot pepper sauce but still felt it lacked something which is probably vinegar. Growing up in Kansas City I rarely every had a raw cuke without it being marinated in vinegar of some kind but not everyone likes vinegar either so my only other suggestion would be to add a fresh herb of your choice and that would definitely kick it up a notch. I will make this again but with tweaks.

Of course I added two small limes instead of juice from one. It just didn't seem like enough from one. I also put in more Hot Sauce (Louisiana Hot Sauce) and put in some pepper and a pinch of salt. Didn't have a red bell pepper, so I added a couple slices of tomato to add to the mix. Added a purple onion...and a LOT at that! It was good but I for sure want to try and mix it up a bit for the next times. A great afternoon snack for work and very easy to make!

Just not a lot of flavor.  Many other cucumber salad recipes out there that are loaded with taste.  As other reviewers suggested,  I added extra Tabasco sauce, some freshly ground pepper, and even a littlle bit of chopped cilantro, but it wasn't enough to take it beyond blandness.   Served with chicken scallopini, sesame green beans, freshly cooked apples, and strawberry shortcake for dessert.  It's a very colorful dish with nice presentation, but beyond that, I don't think there's much to recommend it.
