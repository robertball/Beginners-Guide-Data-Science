The green onions and parmesan definitely gave this halibut a very nice pleasing flavor but there really was no point to adding the dried dill. Dill has little or no flavor after being cooked for that long a period of time and especially so when using dried dill. I suggest using two or three pinches of chopped fresh dill weed instead. Also, a word of caution about placing a baking dish under a broiler and especially if it's Pyrex brand because they often cannot withstand that high of heat and will shatter even if it had already been at oven temperatures. I learned that first hand and felt like a fool when reading the bottom of my other Pyrex baking dish afterwards; "No Stove Top - No Broiler". It took not only losing a baking dish but also all the yummy food that was in it :-( ********** I am adding an answer to  RckyMtnGirl's question of how someone could have originally rated this recipe on March 3rd but she didn't see the recipe posted until March 6th. Well, it was originally posted early Saturday morning of the 3rd and I tried it that afternoon ;-)

Okay so Halibut is hard to find right now so I subbed cod.
Also after reading the reminder that Pyrex should not be broiled I decided to just add the parm right into the sauce and not broil it at all. I also added more dill.
It was amazing. So good that I am making it again tonight and will add afew scallops to try.
Thank you for sharing your friend's recipe.
I am sorry for your loss and will always make this in her honor.
Here's to Chele!

Awesome! Will make again. P.S., One reviewer said there was no point in using dried dill? You could definitely taste it. In fact, it was a definining flavor of the dish.

I was in a hurry so didn't measure anything.  Substituted plain yogurt for sour cream and only broiled until cheese was melted, not browned (because, again, I was in a hurry!).    Anyway, it had a nice flavour with the green onions and parmesan.  Our family loved it!

Love this recipe and have used a similar one for years. I use a foil lined broiler pan and then put the halibut w/sauce (I substitute plain yogurt for the sr. crm.)on the broiler rack. That way you can move under the broiler w/no fear of exploding pyrex. Ymmmmy, moist.

Just delicious. My garden club asked me for the recipe after I made a modified version for them. I used Tilapia, substituted 3/4 cup of lowfat sour cream, and added 1 rounded tablespoon of mayonnaise. I had sweet onion so I used that instead of green, and once it was cooked i sprinkled seasoned Panko breadcrumbs on top, then Parmesan after, and put it under the broiler to brown. OUTSTANDING!

This is really a great recipe. My Whole Foods Supermarket had the Halibut for 28.99 per lb. So I substituted fresh Cod for 10.99 per lb. I seasoned the cod with Penzys lemon pepper, Mrs. Dash original, onion powder, garlic powder and seasoned salt. I did put a pinch of kosher salt in the sour cream sauce as I had to cut back as I sprinkled a little seasoned salt directly on the fish. I took it to church and shared with my friends at Potluck. They loved it. It was delicious. Will be making it again tomorrow. Will definitely make it again with Cod and will try it with Halibut when I'm making it for one or two persons. By the way I used fillets. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I did some modification with the seasonings but I loved it.

For 'color' I chopped a little red pepper and yellow pepper, used sweet onion because that's what I had.  It was pretty, and delicious.

We really like this! I cut the recipe in half cuz there is just two of us but we both really liked it. Next time I will use fresh grated Parmesan I only had the jar kind, and I didn't have any dill weed so will have to get some for the next time. Easy recipe and delicious!

I have a freezer full of halibut and sockeye salmon from last summer's AK fishing trip so I'm always searching for new recipes. Glad I found this one. I was out of sour cream so I decided to substitute plain whole milk yogurt and add some minced garlic.  My wife's opinion was that it was "the best fish I've ever had". We eat lots of fish so that statement speaks volumes. Trying it tonight with sour cream. A++++

I've fixed this for a dozen different guest occasions and it's a hit every time. Don't sub anything, if you think you have to do something, I would add more of the topping than the recipe calls for. I notice people scraping the topping on their plates to get the most they can on their fish. If you add more topping, increase the cooking time a little. Thanks Barbie!

I've made halibut many different ways, and we usually prefer deep-frying it in Panko, but this was the best.  It melted in our mouths.  Next time, I'll use minced Walla Walla sweet onion instead of green onion, as I thought the green onion overpowered everything else.  I would also like to try some fresh dill; as someone else said, dried dill weed has no flavor.  I also used non-fat Greek yogurt, which I find to be interchangeable with sour cream, and I always have Greek yogurt on hand.

REALLY like it.  I didn't have dill so I used Penzey's Mural of Flavor and will make it again soon.  I added the parmesan to the sour cream/butter mix since I was using a glass pan.  It was outstanding.

1-14-2019 ~I recognized this recipe as being  very similar to another recipe from this website, "Halibut Sitka"  The difference appears to be that this recipe does not include mayonnaise in the sour cream mixture, and it tops the fish with Parmesan at the end.  I enjoyed this well enough, tho' I did use a higher temperature, 400 degrees, which I would recommend baking for 10-15 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.  I enjoyed this, but I wasn't wowed, even tho' I made sure to give it a little zip with some garlic powder.  It turns out quite pretty, especially served with fresh asparagus and rice, but it  actually would have benefited by a little zing from some mayo.  In addition, I am not terribly fond of Parmesan with fish but I have no regrets for giving it a try.

This was a really easy way to prepare Halibut and the flavors were great.  I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and it tasted fantastic.  The parmesan is an interesting twist with the first, but it works really well.

Love it!  Husband loves it!   About the third time I made this recipe.  I usually use plain yogurt, but this time I used sour cream, I used minced onion, as I didn't have green onion on hand.  I'm also pretty liberal with the Dill.  I think it really adds to the flavor.  I cooked it for 22 mins and honestly I would have been better off taking it out at 19 mins or so, so keep an eye on your fish!   It was firm, but not dried out.  Still delicious!!!

I didn’t really like the flavor. The sour cream makes this dish too bitter. And the sauce was too thick.

Have made this twice now and it is delicious - will become a regular for sure. We just added some dashes of hot sauce and lemon juice which some similar recipes also had - great flavor and an easy crowd pleaser for dinner parties. I was asked for the recipe by happy guests. Good with small fingerling roasted potatoes and asparagus or fresh green beans.

I cut down on the butter by half and the sauce was still good.  I only got to taste it the next day and thought it was fine, but husband seemed to really enjoy it.  I thought that the divine halibut recipe, which was sort of similar, tasted better.

We didn't care for this at all.  The sour cream mixture got weird and separated when it cooked and just looked unappealing.  I followed the recipe exactly and also didn't care for the flavor combinations.  I won't be making this again.

Dear Barbie-
Thank you for posting your beloved friend's recipe. What a lovely way to immortalize her memory. This is absolutely delicious! I made no changes except that I didn't have any white pepper on hand, so I simply used fresh-ground black. The blend of flavors is magnifique! I know I'll make this again and often.

I do NOT care for halibut.  BUT, this recipe is absolutely excellent and I loved the halibut.  I would recommend it to everyone, even those who don't like fish.  I'm stuffed!

My husband and I loved this!  I had 1 lb. of fresh halibut, and wanted a new recipe.  I found this, and because I don't always keep green onions in my fridge, used chopped sweet onions sauted in butter, instead. I also didn't have white pepper, but added a little cayenne pepper. Loved the dill, too. It came out deliciously!  Thanks for the recipe, Barbie!
