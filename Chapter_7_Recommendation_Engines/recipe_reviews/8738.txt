I thought this recipe was just all right but my boyfriend quite likes it so I'll rate it 4 stars. It is definitely good enough for us to eat it for lunch several days in a row. I am not sure how this turned out soupy for other reviewers as mine actually needed extra water and still came out fairly thick and stewy. The secret may be in the cooking time, I did let mine simmer for over an hour as the recipe suggests. I had to use bone-in tights as that was the only thing left in the shop but I think that actually added to the flavour. Picked the bones out once the meat was soft. I added some extra tomato puree and lots of garlic powder to compliment the spinach, and I think the lemon is a key ingredient - add plenty. Very nice on rice and loved it on mash.

Delicious and forgiving.  I didn’t sauté the spinach and parsley to reduce the fat in this recipe, instead I added it right at the end so it would be bright green when I served it.  To serve, I put it in soup bowls garnished with fresh parsley and parmesan cheese with sour dough rolls.  This was delicious and I ate way too much of it.  Absolutely a repeater!

Fantastic!  After overeating during the holidays, my husband and I were craving something green and good for us.  This was it.  I even subbed ketchup for tomato paste, cayenne pepper for turmeric, added more salt, some pepper, and sprinkled a little fresh grated parm on top when serving.  We loved it!  Comfort food at its best - and good for us too!

awesome! Such healthy comfort and really tasty and healthy!! Very easy and little cleanup.  I made changes based on the suggestions of others: -used 2 tsp paprika instead of tumeric -added garlic powder -added a bay leaf -used ketchup instead of tomato paste and added about 3T -added 2 carrots -added 1 extra cup of water  Served with brown rice, which went really well. started the rice just as I finsished browning the chicken. I just cooked the stew for however long it took to cook the rice (~40 minutes) and this was perfect!

I am giving this 5 stars but I changed it a bit.  Added a bay leaf, used left over chicken that had been seasoned with Rosemary, omitted the potato, added celery, carrots, paprika instead of tumeric, a tad more spinach, omitted the lemon because I had already cooked the chicken with lemon and lemon zest earlier, added more tomato paste and then more water and white wine.  Cooked for 20 minutes and it came out very tasty.

This recipe tasted fine but it was bland. I may make it again because it is healthy but not because it is delicious.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I never follow recipes perfectly, so my judgement reflects some adjustments as well. I used only about half or three quarters as much chicken and more spinach and parsley. I also added garlic for fragrance before frying the spinach and parsley. I chopped the chicken breast into smaller pieces after the first 10-minute boiling period. The lemon (I used the juice of an entire lime instead of measuring) gives the soup a freshness and most of its flavor. If you're worried about blandness, as one review complained, then taste the soup and adjust it for saltiness before adding the lemon juice. Besides the obvious of adding more tomato paste, turmeric, and salt, you can also add chicken bouillon powder at that point. Cut up mushrooms would be a very good addition to this soup too. Calling it a stew is a little misleading. There's very little liquid, and it's more broth-like than stew-like.

My daughter & I both drained our bowls and went back for seconds.  Very nice flavor!  I think making it as written would be fine, but I needed to make some changes, and here they are.  I used chicken thighs.  Because I cook for a crowd I used 10 thighs and doubled the other ingredients.  I could have tripled the other ingredients for a better ratio.  I used chicken broth instead of water to deglaze and added some white wine.  I didn't have tumeric so used Cayenne which added a nice subtle kick.  Loved it!! UPDATE: Next time I made it I followed the suggestion to not saute the spinach and just add it at the end.  This didn't work for us as we didn't like the texture, which was very slimy due to the spinach.  I suggest the saute step!!

This was a great, fast, easy and healthy recipe. I too substituted cayenne for turmeric (because I didn't have any). I used 2 chicken breasts but 1 whole potato and 2 teaspoons of tomato paste. Next time I will use more spinach and parsley since they do wilt a lot during the cooking process, and I may try adding carrots or celery. Lemon juice was to taste and added right before serving. I cooked for the entire two hours.

I was so surprised that this simple combination of ingredients could yield something so delicious! I made this for a week's worth of lunches, and enjoyed it everyday. To make it a little easier I used rotisserie chicken, and like others I skipped the step of frying the parsley and spinach. Also, I don't love potatoes in soup so I skipped that. I will DEFINITELY make this again! Fantastic!

This was very good and a healthy dish.  I didn't have spinach but used kale. I did use less oil.

Looking at this recipe, it struck me as a Persian-inspired stew (of which I often make). I made it according to other Persian stew recipes: saute an onion with a couple cloves of garlic and chicken - diced! Meanwhile, fry the parsley and spinach (use more of both as they both shrink considerably - I'm talking at least one large bunch parsley and even 16oz spinach). Frying herbs is an integral part of Persian stews - use low heat and it's done when you can smell the herb aroma. Increase the spices: tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 1/2 tsp tumeric. Mine did not need even the full hour. If you do not want it to be soupy, take the lid off near the end until the juice has evaporated. Preparing it like this made a delicious stew that my Persian husband will not shut up about - AND the baby ate it!

Delicious! While the first go was a bit bland, In looking at some of the other reviews, I've made some changes to make it a tasty one-pot meal! We chopped 3 potatoes, doubled the liquid (one cup water, one cup white wine) bumped up the turmeric to 1 teaspoon, 3 Tablespoons tomato paste, added 2 chopped celery stalks, a few cloves of garlic, a bay leaf, and a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper. We cooked the chicken in the oven while preparing the other ingredients, and then shredded it before adding it to the pot. Perfect comfort food that never fails to disappoint!

This one is a keeper.  Although I'm sure it's good that way, it doesn't really need to be simmered for 1-2 hours (especially if you leave out the potato.)  I usually only cook it for about half an hour and we love it!

This is awesome!  For those of you hesitant to try it...don't be!  I've made it as directed which was great.  I've also substituted for the spinach with other greens such as turnip greens and kale.  I have also used a small amount of marinara or tomato sauce when I didn't have paste.  Oh, and a couple of times I had cilantro instead of parsley...all good!  This is only my second review ever, but I had to leave one for this.  It will forever be a go-to recipe in our house.  Thanks!

This is by far my favorite recipe so far that I have made on this site.  I used paprika and cayenne, ketchup and garlic.  I used a little less chicken and a little more water.  I also used sweet potatoes and made it even more healthy.  Served it over brown rice with french bread.  Excellent!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe.  Instead of using chicken breast I cut up 2 chicken quarters into pieces and then took the meet off the bone when it was finished.

I found this recipe to be very bland. I even added garlic to it. I served it on basmati rice. I cooked the chicken stew for about an hour and a half. If I make it again, I will spice up the chicken for sure. I found this recipe to be a 2.5 star dish. If you don't like spice then this would be for you.

I am cooking this up as I write this, but I decided to substitute celery root for the potato and chicken broth for the water.  I also swapped the olive oil for chicken broth and shredded the chicken breasts.  Because I had forgotten to get an onion, but didn't realize it until after starting to make this, I wound up letting the chicken, spinach, parsley, salt, pepper, turmeric, tomato paste, and chicken broth marinate together for more than a day before adding the onion and celery root.  I can't wait to see what this tastes like!  Though this has at least another 45 minutes of cooking time left, I rated this off of a sample taste.  It is delicious!

The first sound out of my husbands mouth was Mmmm, so this get a five star from me!
I did change the recipe a little bit, I opted to not add my parsley and spinach until I put in the potato - then I just put them on the top and let them steam for 10 minutes, then I stirred them in. I put in the entire little can of tomato past and only added one cup of water so my stew was just that, a stew - not soupy. I traded out the potato for a Jicama, which is a potato substitute (its sweeter and just delicious - even raw). I added a bay leaf and put my lemon juice in near the middle of the cooking time rather then at the end.

Very good.  Each time I make it I find myself adding a lot more liquid to keep it from burning down.  I never have tomato paste on hand, so I use a bit of tomato soup.

This was slightly suprisingly excellent! Healthy for you and very tasty.  Only thing I did differently is I added carrot and baby bella mushrooms at the same time as the potatoes to make it go a little further with my family.  My youngest son is far from the biggest fan of veggies but he ate an entire big bowl of this... well after a little coaxing to actually try it but once he did, he demolished it! Yup, this is a regular in our house from now on, you can't beat healthy AND great tasting! Thanks Ladan Miller for the wonderful recipe!!!

A very tasty stew (mine turned out a bit watery and I had to thicken it with arrowroot, but I that happened because I used chopped frozen spinach instead of fresh stuff). Otherwise, I followed the recipe almost exactly, but instead of adding water to the ingredients I used beer!

Real easy to make..used garlic and other herbs and pepper instead of tumeric.  Took the advice and substituted ketchup instead of paste.  I liked it because kids ate it as well.

this tasted good but it took forever and it stained my pot yellow from the turmeric. i think if i make it again i'll buy a crappy pot from goodwill that i don't care about. it wasn't bad, though.

This was very tasty, but I added a few things. I added one chicken boullion cube, cayenne, cumin, and some extra garlic.
I also added some coconut milk to the basmati rice that I served with it. Excellent.

This was great.   My entire family enjoyed this.  My husband and I thought we should add more of the spinach, parsley and onions next time.  Mmm Mmm Mmm!

It is very tasty and worked out well with some changes I had to make because of time:  I used a small rotisserie chicken breast instead of raw chicken (almost shredded or in small pieces, no skin or bones), added it after adding the potatoes, and left it to simmer for around 30 minutes.  It is great with white rice.

This is a great recipe.  My husband really liked it. I added white wine, carrots, brocolli, green peppers to have more servings of vegetables. I also added garlic powder and pepper to my taste.  This is a lovely dish.

Great Recipe!  I used less oil than it called for.  Also added more spinach.  I used this for lunches for a week, and it never got old.

Absolutely delicious. I made this for my husband who likes spinach but I loved it too. It also saves washing up as it is effectively meat and two veg in one pan on the stove top. I used economy chicken thighs in mine.

Not sure that I'd call this a stew, but probably wouldn't label it soup either.  It was just a tasty meal.  I ate it with garlic bread to soak up the flavorful juices.  The combination of parsley, turmeric, and lemon made for a good blend.  Instead of water and tomato paste, I used a chopped fresh tomato and a small can of tomato juice.  A small grated yellow squash helped to thicken up the broth a bit.    Just added the spinach and parsley to the skillet after the onion was sauteed and the chicken was browned.  And - I precooked the potato so it wouldn't have to simmer quite as long.
