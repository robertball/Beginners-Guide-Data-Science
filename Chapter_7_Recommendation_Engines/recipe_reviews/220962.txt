Incredibly easy & tasty. Family loved it.  I only used one cup of brown sugar and added a bit of the pineapple juice along with the mustard to make that part pourable.  Definitely will use this again.

I messed up and mixed the pineapple juice with the brown sugar, mustard, and honey. I brushed it on and the end result was fantastic!

This ham was delicious. Very sweet flavor and very juicy, which is what I was hoping for. We omitted the honey (didn't have any on hand) and I think it would have been too sweet if I'd included it. Definitely a keeper!

Made as written, aside from only basting a couple times, and was very tasty.  Good glaze.

My very judgmental and picky family loved it. Seriously LOVED it. Someone even said that it looked beautiful like a picture out of mom's old cookbooks! Recipe is so easy to follow, only change I had to make was adding some hot water to break up the hard chunks of brown sugar.  Should have boiled down the mixture after adding the mustard to get rid of the water and thicken the glaze but it was still delicious!

This is the best glaze/basting sauce I've ever used on a ham! My ham was smaller than the recipe,and home-raised, so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly. AWESOME!!! Think this would also be great basting pork chops or steaks on the grill. Will let you know... Definitely a keeper.

I skipped the pineapple and just used the honey with the brown sugar/mustard paste. It was great! I worried that all that sugar would just burn but it didn’t. It made a lovely crust. I used my oven probe with my convection oven set to 325 for about an hour 45 minutes. (My ham was not quite 10 lbs.)

I made this with Smithfield everyday ham for a normal Sunday night dinner. It came out great, very tasty and simple enough for a basic nightly meal.

I needed to add more than double the quantity of mustard to make a sauce -- next time I'll start with less brown sugar.  Used fresh pineapple rings instead of canned but the recommended amount of pineapple juice was an essential ingredient for basting.   I'll never use the packaged glaze again -- this made an absolutely delicious ham.

Used this recipe for Christmas ham. The sauce was thick but really good. I really enjoyed this glaze. I did not cover in pineapple due to not having toothpicks, but it was really good. We even used the juice to dip the turkey in.

I cooked a 7 lb bone in ham(precooked) for 1&1/2 hrs.  I used this exact recipe except only l cup of brwn sugar instead of 2.  I used only 3/4 cup of honey.  It came out great!  I loved the flavor.  It was sweet and delicious!  The pineapple looked and tasted great, too!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved this! I liked it as well just a little to sweet for my taste. Still very good. I used a spiral ham and used the left over to make soup beans.

This was my first time making our Easter ham and we were a little nervous. We already had a can of diced pineapples, so we used it instead of round. I didn’t really measure anything but followed the directions eyeballing the ingredients & finding the consistency per the instructions. My husband helped with basting every 15 minutes which he enjoyed being involved. It didn’t look that great at first but tasted delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Excellent glaze for our Easter boneless ham. Since we are older and watch how much sugar we use, I cut the amount of brown sugar down to one cup. I added 1/2 t. ground cloves, and instead of using pineapple rings, I used a small can of crushed pineapple. Because the syrup was thick enough, the pineapple remained coated over the entire ham, rather than running off as many glazes do. This recipe resulted in a beautiful appearance and delicious taste. This is a keeper!

Literally the best ham I’ve ever made. I had a limited budget so had to use a bone in butt portion but this recipe made it taste like the best cut ever. So delicious so easy. My family wants it on Sundays too not just Easter.

I followed the directions and didn't change anything  but substituted pineapple chunks as I did not have the rings. It looked so good with the little chunks stuck on with toothpicks!  Everyone said they loved it!  Now this will be my preferred method of preparing hams. I served some of the drippings as a sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as written. All the ingredients and measures were as written. I put a 10 lb bone in half ham in an 18 qt nesco on a rack. I poured all ingredients listed in order over the ham. Set the nesco at 325. Roasted it for 3 to 3 1/2 hours. I inserted a meat thermometer, when it reached 135 degrees, it was done. This was the best tasting, and moistess ham I have ever made. I will make my ham this way going forward.

Delicious!  Not being able to find a ham similar to the picture, I opted for a spiral baked ham and used this recipe instead of the glaze-in-a-bag that came with it.  I spread out the slices when pouring all the deliciousness over it.  Good reviews from the family, including teenage boys!  

I needed to use a ton more mustard than listed in the recipe to make it even spreadable, let alone pour-able.  No matter - the additional mustard made the crust tangy and sweet.  Just letting others know in case you’re experiencing the same.

I made this recipe and cut down the brown sugar to about 1.25 cups and the honey to about 0.75 cups and it was still too sweet.  And I have a pretty big sweet tooth! Just not on my ham...

I'd give it 5 stars if I could come up with a way not to have to baste it every 15 minutes. I had to do this on a holiday so I was home long enough to bake and baste it. It was a good ham to have on Christmas for a small family. The second time I made this, I had a 3lb precooked ham, so I only basted twice in 45 minutes. I should have basted 3 times in 1 hour because it wasn't heated all the way through.

I am not crazy over ham very much at all, but I made this for Easter! I just used 1 cup of brown sugar, bc one thing I don't like is extremely sweet ham! Imho, this was THE BOMB - BANGIN'/FIRE!! ?? It was EXCELLENT!! Loved it!! Thank you for sharing it! I like trying different recipes, however, you nailed it! My search is over for a ham recipe!! I'll be using this one from now on!! I was skeptical of the honey, yet truly amazed, and my guests LOVED it, as well!! This truly was the best ham I have ever eaten!!  5 stars and 5 thumbs up!! ????????????????????

I'm not a great cook and holiday meals always make me anxious. But this was super easy and a hit with the whole family! I made it exactly as directed and it was perfect. We'll make it for many Easters to come!

Wonderful and simple recipe. I'm fairly new to cooking and this Easter I decided to tackle it all by myself. I didn't alter the recipe at all and it turned out amazingly! I even impressed my Mother-In-Law haha!

The ham is great. I only gave 4 stars simply because I felt one only needed half the ingredients and I felt it best to braise ham in the last 30 - 45 minutes only (personal choice). I also used cloves all over ham at the outset. But wonderful taste and a definite keeper. Thanks so much :)

Great sauce with chicken and black rice with broccoli as well.
