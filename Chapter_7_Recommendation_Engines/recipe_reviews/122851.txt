Well... mixed impressions with this recipe. I will freely admit I'm mostly used to working softball stage candy, so this might just be a learning curve. First, the syrup came to hard-crack stage at about 260 degrees. I live in Alberta, Canada, so it could be the elevation (or my thermometer) but I would suggest checking the stage manually very often. Hard crack sugar should string into threads that break when bent when dropped into cool water off of a spoon. When I got the right temperature, I poured the sugar over the nuts in a large metal saucepan and had a really hard time mixing them with the butter and vanilla, the mixture firmed up very quickly. When I transferred the nuts to the pans, they were in balls. I cooled and greased my hands to press the mixture flat (be VERY careful you don't burn yourself) I may try pouring the sugar/vanilla/butter/salt mixture over the nuts next time. I put the pans in the freezer to cool more quickly. The brittle was very easy to remove from my metal pan with just a slight twist of the pan, the glass pan I used was a total disaster. I couldn't get the darned stuff out, I tried spatulas, knives, even a meat tenderizer. I finally wound up chipping it out in small bits.. it was horrible. Don't use glass!!! The brittle itself tasted quite good. I will try this again but my kitchen is a mess. Good thing sugar cleans up fairly well :)

This recipe was very easy and super quick.  The clean up was even easier. I was going to make it for an office party so I had had a few people test.  they loved it!  The first batch came out really good..I used almonds and cashews.  Atfer I realized how easy it was I made the second batch a day later, but I tweaked it a little.  I add about a tablespoon of brown sugar and an extra splash of vanilla.  Yummy!
Thanks Mrs. James Merriman

I absolutely love this.  It is super simple, and tastes great. Made several batches last holiday season, and starting all over again tonight.

Made with cashews, almonds and macadamia nuts.  Amazing!  I think I may add some brown sugar and a tad more butter next time to shape up the flavor.  Also warming the nuts for 6 minutes made them a little too brown for my taste, so I'll keep it at 5 minutes next time.

I loved this.  Never enough nuts in store bought brittle and this had more than enough!!!  I cut it down to two cups and also added a tspn of cinnamon and used vanilla butter nut extract instead.  HUGE hit.

This recipe turned out fabulous! I loved that it had twice as many nuts as most recipes! That being said it would be easy to drop the nuts to 3 cups, 2 cups or one as you like. I added 2 TBSP brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of baking soda. I also bumped up the vanilla a tad and the butter too. I used fresh organic nuts and toasted them myself. I used salted butter so only added a pinch of salt. This is so beautiful packed in jars for Christmas gifts! I will be making several more batches!! FYI I was not super careful about the temp between 290 and 310 and got great results both batches.
