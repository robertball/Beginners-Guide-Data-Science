This is so good- If you think you don't like beets, you're wrong! Make them this way and you'll be a beetaholic! This recipe make A LOT as written- for 4 adults I use 2 beets and 1 good sized yam and it's exactly the right amount. I do it in bowls, no need to waste a bag. I cut down the oil and use just enough to coat. I use brown sugar too, but either way it's delicious and healthy! I bake beets alone 20m, add yams and seasoning and red onion, then bake add'l 40m. LOVE this dish!  FYI beets do turn your pee a bit pinkish the next day, so don't panic =)

Excellent, yummy.  Substituted fresh garlic for powder, increased sugar to 1 tablespoon and substitued brown sugar for its maple flavor.  Very Very good.  The last 20 minutes of cooking I turned the oven down to 350 degrees as to not dry out the veggies.

Great dish! I made this for both the Thanksgiving dinners we went to this year. My mom and grandmom don't like sweet potatoes but raved over this recipe. My aunt quickly called dibs on the small amount of leftovers we had. I ended up eating only a small portion because I was feeding our 18-month-old twins from my plate and they couldn't get enough! One of DH's cousins even called the next day to get the recipe. Two changes I made: (1) 1/2 the pepper -- the pepper completely overpowered the dish otherwise, and (2) I used canned beets cause that's all I had on hand. One can = 3 beets called for in recipe. I didn't cook them ahead; just threw them into pan with the rest and cooked for 45 minutes. Everything came out tender and delicious! My grandmom, the sweet-potato-hater, asked me to bring the same dish to Christmas!!

Amazingly good!  My one year old kept stealing it off my plate.  My three year old thought it was too spicy.  Next time I will make a little side dish for her with out blk pepper.  

You don't need to waste a plastic bag though.  Just put spices and oil in a bowl and toss in the beets.  Pull beets out with fork or slotted spoon and put in pan to roast.  Then toss in your sweet potatoes.  Then mix well when you add the sweets to the beets.

What a wonderful flavor & color combination!  I have beets I'm still using, found this recipe & loved it! However,  I hate the mess & aggravation of peeling raw beets, so I roasted them first (with a little olive oil); when they were almost done, I let them cool & they were much easier to peel.  I don't think they bleed quite as much either.  By roasting them before combining,  you can reduce the overall cooking time & you're guaranteed tender beets.  Thanks for a delicious dish!

YUMMY!  We really like this combination.  I'm not a fan of any kind of onion so I always leave that out, but I've made this now exactly as stated as well as a few variations, such as using pumpkin pie spice instead of the garlic, salt & pepper.  Or I use butternut squash in combination with the beets and sweet potatoes.  Any way you dice it and spice it, this recipe is a winner!  Thank you!

A couple points to make about roasted veggies.  If you roast @ 425, your veggies will carmelize and sweeten up on their own--no need to add sugar at all.  Onions carmelize into pieces of 'candy', and don't resemble taste or texture of a raw onion.  As for the garlic, I add the whole cloves, and let them roast whole, as well.  Sometimes I smash a couple cloves slightly with the flat of the knife to release garlic oil, then toss with veggies, olive oil, and salt.  I roast most my veggies now, because it's so forgiving.  I can keep them in the over until rest of dinner is ready:  asparagus, cauliflower, onion wedges, brussels sprouts, potatoes, etc.  Never had a bad roasted veggie!!

very tasty dish. I prefer to use fresh garlic over garlic powder so I minced four cloves of garlic and mixed them in.  I didn't have an onion on hand so I left that out.
When it was done cooking I put some of it on my salad with a little goat cheese.  Goat cheese and beets make such a tasty combination

Roasted the beets for 30 mins at 400F before adding sweet potatoes and a small butternut squash (peeled & cubed). Roasted for another 45 minutes. Next time I would roast the beets even longer before adding potatoes. Used 2 cloves of fresh pressed garlic and brown sugar instead of white. Delicious!

I made this for family at Thanksgiving and then for co-workers at a pot luck.  Those who tried it LOVED it and requested the recipe.  I agree with other reviewers that you have to like beets to like the recipe, though.

Thank you for this recipe!  I was looking for something to do with beets because they are so healthy, but never made them before.  This was really tasty.  I used a packet of Splenda instead of the sugar, but followed the recipe to a T and it turned out delicious.  Will definitely be making this again.

Loved it.  Melted in my mouth.  Next time I will probably cook the beets at least 5 more minutes, because they were a little less cooked than the potatoes.

My husband had to listen to me carry on and on about how much i liked this recipe all night! I recommend using several cloves of minced fresh garlic. It's sweet roasted flavor is outstanding with the veggies. Also, I like beets but I feel the sweet potatoes should be more prominent. For two people I did 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 and onion, 3 small sweet potatoes and one tennis ball sized beet. We would have eaten more but we practically licked the pan :)

I make it with only the Sea Salt and Olive oil.  No garlic, no sugar.  It is amazing.

Excellent recipe! I love both sweet potatoes and kinda like beets but the onion was really good too. Don't forget the onion if you make this recipe. I omitted the pepper, used brown instead of white sugar, and prepared minced garlic instead of powder. I cooked exactly as directed and the veggies were firm (didn't fall apart or turn to mush) yet perfectly soft cooked.  If anything, I'll either cut the beets into smaller pieces or increase the cooking time for just the beets. Delicious and beautiful side dish :)

Guard this recipe with your life, it's that great.  Have made countless times.  When serving to one or ??# of people, be prepared to be asked for the recipe.  I've already gotten to writing them on recipe cards, for the amount of people who are dining the night I serve this, so as they ask for it, I just hand them this written recipe card.  Great with regular potatoes & also adding carrots.

nothing special here - not sure what all the fuss is about - followed recipe to a tee except added br sugar instead of white and used 1/4 amt of onion (not big fans)  it was just okay - trying to find recipes that'll get my husband to eat more veggies - he tried it and couldn't eat it.  Waste of perfectly good ingredients.  I ate it, but won't be making again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Next time, I will cut the pepper in half as it was a little too peppery for my taste.  Also- it is very easy to toss the sweet potatoes/onion with the olive oil mixture in a bowl and not have to waste a ziplock bag.  I did turn my oven broiler on for about 5 minutes at the end of the cooking time to allow the veggies to caramalize a bit.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing- we will make this again.

ONLY READ THIS REVIEW.!!!!  I only make recipes from this site exactly as they are written.  If you want to make 10 changes to a recipe and reinvent the wheel, please relist the recipe as such then we can all rate yours.  I followed this one exactly as written and did not make any changes or substitutions.  It turned out perfectly and I will def be making it again and again.  The whole family loved it, and we even had it the next day cold and it was still amazing.  Please stop changing recipes and making me scroll to a review that was made as is.  Thanks everyone.

Not only this delicious warm, it was "out of sight" cold, with avocado, pistachios and goat cheese over a bed of greens. Probably the most delicious and memorable lunch I've had in a long time.

This dish just SCREAMS "cool weather is finally here!" I cut the amounts down for 2 people (easy division!) and I left out the sugar -- no need for it, really! The beets, potatoes and onions carmelized and sweetened themselves, and the seasoning was the perfect foil. This is part of my permanent reportoire. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy.  I baked the beets at 425 degrees for 15 min. and when I added the sweet potatoes, I baked it for 30 min. It saved me lots of time. Just keep an eye out as some ovens vary.  Don't think the sugar was necessary. Thanks for sharing!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!  I have made this about 5 times already....absolutely love it.  I like to sprinkle on a little more sea salt after it's done to get the sweet & salty taste.  Thanks for sharing.

tasted great, but as the last person wrote the presentation could have been made nicer if you roast the beets and sweets separately and mix only before serving. got many compliments on this dish.

DELICIOUS! I loved it, my bf loved it and will be making again. This was my first time cooking beets and only my second cooking sweet potatoes. 
Highly recommend!

Threw in some garlic cloves and omitted the sugar. Loved the roasted flavor of the veggies! Will do again.

This was excellent! I had some beets from a farm and had never made them before. I found this recipe and it sounded good. I left out the sugar and used fresh garlic.  I added some parsnips to the vegetables.  I added the salt and pepper to taste and also added rosemary. Beautiful fall color to the dish as well!

I hesitated making this dish because I’m not crazy about beets.  I’m so glad I tried it because I loved the flavor combination of these vegetables.  Not only was it delicious, but it also made a beautiful presentation.  This is a perfect fall/winter side dish that I’ll be enjoying many times this season.  Thanks for sharing!

This sounded yummy, but was not - and I like beets, onions, and sweet potatoes.  Maybe too much pepper, maybe needed more sugar ... don't know.  It just seemed quite bland overall.

Yummy!! This was my first try at cooking beets...what fun!  They are so pretty, I must explore beets further.  I opted not to waste a plastic bag so I put in a plastic bowl with lid and shook it to combine evenly.  I also used brown sugar instead of regular.  Can't wait to share with friends and family!

If you are a beet-lover, you will likely enjoy this recipe.  I like beets in spinach salad with dressing and feta cheese, but the beet flavor was too strong in this dish-- it overpowered the garlic and sweet potato flavor.

Everybody loved it! I used yams instead of sweet potatoes. I cooked the beets for 1 1/2 hrs, covered them to speed up the cooking and only mixed them with yams & onions at the end, to prevent the yams from turning completely red. Makes alot!

This was good but not exceptional. It was a little boring for my tastes. I would put the seasoning on the beets too and add more of it.

Turned out fantastic!! I used tennis ball sized beets and quartered them. I roasted them for 20 minutes first before adding the sweet potatoes because of their size. Both were done on time. Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

I made these for our 19-month old twins.  We've never had beets before, but sweet potatoes have been a favorite since we began solids.  The only changes I made was to substitute the sugar for dark honey (honey and real maple syrup both taste great on sweet potatoes).  I also crinkle cut the peeled beets and peeled sweet potatoes for presentation.  My daughter ate 1/2 a serving, my son picked out only the sweet potatoes.  We'll try eating the leftovers tomorrow.  Meanwhile, I think they are delicious and will be passing on the  recipe.  Thank you Drumwrite for introducing beets to my babies.

We loved this!  We love sweet potatoes, but chose to make it with just beets and sweet onions this time.  They were delicious!  I will definitely prepare them with sweet potatoes--sometimes with and sometimes without--depends how we feel.  Beet lovers will enjoy this recipe.

I made this a couple weeks ago for the first time and we have had it four times since then, we love it so much.  I even did it once with just beets and onion when I didn't have sweet potatoes in the house.  No point wasting a plastic bag, just toss the veggies in a bowl.

This was very good. Even my husband had seconds. I was in a hurry and mixed it all together and threw it in the oven before I realized you are supposed to cook the beets first.  It was OK becuase I  chopped them small.  Next time I will do the beets AND the onions first as I like the onions really browned. A minute under the broiler at the end of cooking would be good.  I made this last night and am looking forward to the leftovers that are reheating right now.

I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it turned out great! I actually boiled the beets for about 10 minutes before peeling and chopping them and still cooked them for the full hour in the oven. They were nice and tender. I also followed another reviewers suggestion and used a tbsp of brown sugar instead of the white sugar. Otherwise, I didn't stray from the recipe at all. Everyone loved it!

Suggestions: The beets need a 30 min. head start in the oven, not 15. So start by peeling the beets & cutting them into bite-sized cubes & chunks of ½" to ¾". Toss them with 1 Tbsp. olive oil & get them into the oven. Use that ½ hr. to prep the other ingredients. Peel & cut the sweet potatoes into similarly bite-sized pieces. Use 5 whole peeled garlic cloves (or more!) instead of garlic powder. (They roast beautifully & can be eaten/avoided by diners as they prefer.) Use a regular white onion (more character than sweet onions). But don't chop it. Cut it into chunks of ½" to ¾", separate the layers, & toss them with the sweet potatoes & garlic cloves in 2 Tbsp. oil & (less) salt & pepper. Omit the sugar. (Beets & sweets are naturally sweet!) After 30 min., scrape the hot beets back into the mixing bowl with the raw vegetables. Toss to mix & coat. Spread them all onto the pan & roast for 20 min. Take them out again & toss again in the bowl. Roast for 20 min. more at a higher temp. of 425 (for 70 min. total roasting time). The repeated tossing & mixing blends the flavors & evens the roasting & browning.

This tastes great!  I don't think it even needs the sugar.  (Or maybe just use half?)  I chopped the onion pretty small and some of them blackened in the oven, which turned out to be a nice added crunch to the dish.  Will make again!!

I have recently began having vegetables delivered from a local farm and chose the famrmer's choice to try new vegetables that I would never buy on my own. Having a batch of beets and not being familiar with them I found this recipe to try and really enjoyed it. I will try adding some goat cheese as others have suggested in the future. The good thing about this recipe is it was enjoyed both hot out of the oven and cold the next day.

Excellent! During the summer we bbq these. Slice they up, butter, green onions, salt & pepper. Wrap up in tin foil.  People who didn't particularly like beets LOVE them. I always have to do 2 packages. So sweet and delicious!
Thanx for this recipe!

I made this dish for dinner tonight and we just loved it! I reduced the amount if pepper and omitted the onions given that I was serving it to my kids and a few of their friends...the end result was delicious! I slapped on a pair of latex gloves to peel my beets and roasted them for 20 minutes, added the sweet potatoes and cooked for another 35-40 minutes. The end result was great and we will definitely make again.

As much as I try, I just can't get into beets.  I just don't really like them.  That said, this recipe made them actually enjoyable.  The sweet from the potatoes really cut down on the earthiness of the beats and I enjoyed this dish.

My husband found this recipe to try out some golden beets he bought.  I was bit skeptical, but OH MY GOSH, these were delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used 1tbsp brown sugar instead (though I'm not sure it needed it) and took off the skins of the potatoes.  I will definitely be making this again as I ate half the recipe myself! :)

so simple yet so delish!  I love this recipe and it does not need tweeking...but I tweek things just because I like to experiment.  I put curry and a bit of coriander in this and omit the sugar since I am diabetic and sweet potatoes have they're own natural sweetness when roasted.  

Its wonderful as a side dish with just about any meat but also good when your roll it up in phyllo dough with a sharp cheddar cheese and bake it as a main dish with a green salad or a cooked dark green veg like kale or spinach and a glass of nice Cabernet.

Very delicious!!!
Since I used canned beets, i did everything in the recipe without them first.  I baked the sweet potatoes and etc.  and when they were about half done, I added the drained canned beets, stirred them in good, and baked until it was all married beautifully!  I reckon I'm a little nervous and impatient to deal with fresh beets!  They look funny!  I'm sure this recipe will make probably MAKE ME CRY TEARS OF JOY if the beets were fresh!

I love this so much, I make it once a week! I always use yams,  sweet potatoes, red and golden beets, and just 1/4 of a red onion. I've even added baby carrots when I was short of veggies; I put them in with the beets. The first time I made it as written and it was way too peppery for me, so now I just use 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper. Try it, it's awesome!

The coating for the sweet potatoes is the perfect blend of sweet, salty and peppery-ness.  The density and sweetness of the potatoes really makes a nice contrast with the light juicy texture of the beets.

This was delicious, simple, a great addition to our holiday dinner.  We weren't able to use sheet pans once the sweet potatoes were added because of the volume of food we needed to make.  We used casserole dishes and increased the temp to 425 and it turned out perfectly.

So tasty! I baked the beets for 20 minutes instead of 15 at the beginning, and turned the heat down to 350 for the last 20 minutes of bake time.

This is a great recipe and turned out really well! It was very easy to make--you don't have to "know how" to cook to get great results! I skipped the added sugar, since all these vegetables are plenty sweet on their own, and didn't use the bag method. I just stirred everything around in a bowl and that worked fine--and saved a bag from ending up in a landfill! I also didn't have garlic powder so I skipped that too, but I'm sure it would have been great with that added kick of garlic. Maybe next time I'll throw in a few minced cloves of garlic in with the onions. The only thing I didn't understand was why the beets never got as soft as the sweet potatoes. Do they just never get that soft, or did I not cook them long enough? I cooked them about 20 minutes before adding the sweet potatoes and onions. Anyway, this was absolutely delicious--we ate it with angel hair pasta and sour cream and it was fantastic. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. We will probably be making this at Thanksgiving too!

AWESOME!  Just a little too much black pepper for my family.  Both of my kids struggled through it because of the pepper and even my husband said it was too much.  We also would have like more salt but the one substitution that I had to do was table salt since we ran out of kosher.  For that reason, I don't take points off for that.  Even with the pepper, this was REALLY good.

My mother made this and gave me a dish to take home. It never made it out of the car. My husband and I ate it with our hands. Hubby's not a fan of beets, but they added a great flavor and color to the dish. I absolutely loved it all.

I was looking for a healthy option to cook sweet potatoes. This was excellent! Much better than I imagined it would be. My only change was to cut back the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp (but that's just to suit my taste; others might like the stronger flavor). I burnt the vegetables a bit, as I forgot to stir them 20 minutes in, but it still was good. Nice flavor.

Interesting combination. The beets sure made a mess, though! My wife swears canned beets would be just as good, but I'm not so sure. If I were to make changes, I'd reduce the pepper to 1/2 t-spoon and increase the sugar to 1 T.

Had a huge beet and some sweet potatoes to use. Added some carrots to use. Amazingly good. Sugar may not be necessary if the veggies are good. Go for fresh garlic if you can.

My second time making this.  The WHOLE family LOVED this recipe.  I didn't have sweet potato on hand when I found this recipe so I substituted with butternut squash and it turned out so YUMMY!  I also added 3 fresh garlic and some parsley to give it some green color.  This will be a recipe I will make throughout the year.

I would give this a 3.5 really. This was very good, but it's no replacement for fresh pizza :) I made it with pumpkin pie spice, salt on the end. In the future I will cut the beats at half the size of the yams to balance the flavor a bit and reduce cooking time. It was definitely one of my favorite beet recipes (yams too) but it was so healthy... I can't wait to try it again with goat cheese. A great thanksgiving side for sure.

Went well with the rest of the items on my Thanksgiving menu. Do make sure to read the recipe carefully so that you bake the beets separately before adding the other vegetables because they take longer to cook. We also added carrots to the mix. I think it would be better if all the vegetables were coated with a sprinkling of sugar, namely brown sugar, in a slightly larger amount to add a maple-like flavour to the overall dish. All my favourites in this one, so no real complaints!

This was great! I took it to a party and got rave reviews even from people who don't like beets. Nice flavor. I spread it out over two baking sheets. I cut everything a little on the small side so probably should have cooked it a little less than I did. But it still came out great.

This is delicious.  Be sure to roast the beets for fifteen minutes before adding the yams as beets take a long time.  I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder (fresh always being preferable in my opinion). But the yams, beets, and onions go together excellently.

Quite a bit of kick -- seems to come from the black pepper.  I had just opened a new container, so maybe the pepper in mine was more powerful than the average cook's.

Delicious and simple. I had 3 huge beets and 2 huge yams on hand and that filled the pan. I did everything as called for except that I used fresh garlic (4 cloves minced). The yams practically melted and caramelized, the beets were enhanced by the salt and pepper and it was all just so good. My husband and I made this our main dish and it was perfect.

This recipe is also great for cookouts!  We like as a side to slow grilled thick pork chops.  Instead of baking in the oven, create a foil pack and toss on the grill. The beets from our garden are just about ready to pick and I cant wait to get them over the charcoal!  Basically the same recipe as above, we like the brown sugar as well.

This was really delicious!!! I have to add that I took the advice of other reviewrs and added butternut squash and parsnips to the beets. I used fresh garlic with some shallots along with a few leaves of fresh sage. Really turned out lovely!! My picky teenage neices and daughter said they want it again before next Christmas. Thanks for a great way to prepare beets!!!

I made this for a healthy lunch we do at work, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it.  It included 3 of the ten vegetables that Dr. Weil highlighted in an article.  I think I am just having a hard time getting past how I usually eat beets and sweets.

The recipe was easy to make and turned out very good, but I think I would sub something else for garlic powder next time, maybe cayenne?

Easy and very tasty. I didn't have onion so I used some onion powder instead, and I didn't use sugar, as I thought it wasn't necessary. I wanted some green in my side dish so I threw some frozen cut green beans into the sweet potato mixture. It all came out great!

Tested this recipe to make for the family at Thanksgiving this year. It was not only really tasty but very pretty too. Will definitely be adding it to my holiday table. Thank you! The only change I made was I added a bit of cayenne pepper (my family likes everything hot!)

I find beets revolting.  In over 60 years of trying to eat beets no sooner would a forkful enter my mouth than I spat it out.  Miracle.  I like this recipe.  When I had just a few spoonfuls of leftovers, I did not throw it out.  It was even better reheated.

I make this style of roasted veggies quite often and it always tastes great. I don’t use sugar because I enjoy the natural sugars in the vegetables. I wash and stem the beets and put them on a square of foil. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt on them. Seal the foil around them. Put parchment paper on the large baking sheet and toss the beet packet in the oven on the baking sheet for 15 minutes. Remove and add the rest of the veggies as in the recipe. Bake until caramelized and tender. Check beets for tenderness. The skin should be easy to peak off. Dice to the size of the other veggies. Serve.

Followed the recipe since this was my first time making it. I have to admit I don't have a lot of experience with beets. The flavor was earthy...not bad, just...very earthy. Next time I'll use coconut oil when roasting  as I've read this is supposed to help with that and help bring out the natural sweetness of beets.

I loved this and it presents beautifully!  Also, it warms up very well (if you have any left).  I used 4 cloves of minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Also, I used the tip from another review and tossed the sweet potatoes, garlic, and oil in a bowl with a top in an effort to not waste a plastic bag.  I brought some to a co-worker who claims to hate beets but he loved this dish.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious! I think the beets were a little too done, and so I wouldn't cook them for the extra 15 minutes at the beginning. That could have been because I chopped them too small, though.

This has been s big hit each time I made it for "crowds" big and small. This is a great recipe for those that don't like sweet potatoes; the beet and onion medley tones down the sweetest of the sweet potatoes and turns it into a sweet and savory dish.

LOVE! This quickly became a fall/winter staple as soon as I first made it.  I'll sometimes add cubed honey nut or butternut squash if I have any on hand but this recipe, as is, is truly lovely.  Thanks a million for sharing.

I must admit I did a few variations. It was the first time I tried it and it turned out wonderful. I had beets of various colours but of the same size (smallish). I also had smallish yams. I washed, peeled and sliced beets and yams 1/3 inch. I brushed some extra virgin olive oil on both sides of the vegetables. I didn't add anything to the beets (the golden are already pretty sweet). I brushed the oil on the yams as well and I sprinkled tarragon and black pepper on them. I also cut two pears in 1/2, oiled both sides and sprinkled tarragon on skin side. I put everything in the oven at 375 F until ready (30 - 35 min). I cut the pears and mixed them with the beets and the yams. I sprinkled some white jalapeno and pear balsamic vinegar. It turned out very tasty. The recipe was nice and simple and easy to make changes to. I like that a lot in a recipe.

This is a very good recipe but I can't give it 5 stars as written.  I cut the salt and pepper by 1/2 and it was still too much salt and pepper for us. Also, the beets need to roast 15-20 min. longer than stated before adding the sweet potato (or chop beets smaller so they cook faster).  My beets needed more roasting, even though I baked them 10 min. longer than the recipe calls for.  Other than that, its delicious.  I used brown sugar as per others' suggestion.  Add your favourite spices or herbs to take it to the next level.  A very colourful dish, too!

Delicious!  Made this as a change from my usual side dishes for Christmas dinner. It was a hit with my guests and I loved it. The only change I made was to use fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Baking the beets for 20 minutes before adding the other vegetables is best. Great flavour.  A definite keeper.

I roast a lot of root veggies, but never combined sweet potatoes and beets before, and it's a great combination with the onion. Used fresh garlic, and it worked just fine.

I also added about 4 carrots sliced into thick pieces which I roasted the same time as the beets. Added more olive oil by eyeing it til all were well covered and added a couple dashes red pepper flakes. Going to try adding some apple chunks and maybe even pumpkin next time as well. Great fall dish.

LOVED this recipe!  I made adjustments to suit my own taste and made this dish over the top for me.  My only disappointment was my beets were not "beet red" so the colors didn't pop as much as I wanted them to.  I added some dried sage to the garlic, salt, sugar, pepper and oil with the potatoes and onions.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper for a little heat.  Can I say this enough?  I LOVED IT!

My kids will eat it, but need some coaxing. We parents, really liked this one. I followed the recipe except that I never use plastic so I just tossed the sweet potatoes with onions and other ingredients in a bowl; no need for the bag. When it was time to add the rest to the baking sheet, I actually poured the hot beets into my pyrex bowl that had the oil, potatoes, etc, mixed it up and poured it back out onto the sheet. I found it really difficult to mix on a baking sheet - the pieces kept falling off (step 3) so I again, just poured it all into the bowl and back to the sheet - the mixing is important to redistribute the juices that form. Chunks of Vidalia onion work really well and we used white sweet potatoes. Chopping can be done the night before - which is so key for us - so you only have to plan for the 45 min of mixing/cooking before dinner.

I just made this for the second time and it was still as good as I remember it. I like onion and garlic - so added both fresh - and it was not overpowering. I also added some fresh rosemary and next time will add more. As many people have said that serving it with some goat cheese makes it even better, it's like the icing on the cake to me. Cut the potatoes and beets into smaller pieces for it to cook faster. I also lowered the heat to start and then bumped it up for the last 20 minutes. Can't go wrong with this recipe!!

I was a little nervous about making beets for the first time.  This was easy and delicious (although it did take a long time).  I peeled the sweet potatoes as well as the beets.  I might experiment with the seasonings, although my husband thought it was perfect as is.

Since beets are considered a super food, I needed a way to like them (cannot stand canned beets).  Dr. Oz says to roast them, so tried this recipe. Recommend using half the pepper & a little more sugar -- 1 tbsp? (next time).  For just my husband & I, I used 3 fresh beets and 1 large yam.  Only had a brown onion on hand, and it all worked out great. The mild sweetness makes it likeable for kids too.  Really a terrific recipe.  Now, what to do with those beet greens. . .(ha)

Mine was very spicy.. I was confused at what made them so spicy.  It is good, but some of my vegetables were undercooked.  If it is the pepper that makes it spicy, then I would recommend decreasing the pepper and using canned beets.  Some of my beets had a hard coating, like I didn't peel the beet skin enough.  That's why I would recommend canned beets, plus it's less mess.

Make this all the time now that we grow beets in the garden. In fact, we probably grow beets because of this recipe lol. I've swapped the sweet potatoes for carrots and still turns out great...just add the carrots later since they cook way faster (last 20 minutes is all that's needed).

Very good.  I never thought I would like beets, but they are really great.  I used brown sugar in place of the regular and really like that flavor it puts into the dish.  I also just used one beet and one sweet potato.  The cooking time can be cut if you make the sizes of the chunks smaller.  I don't care for onion, so I did not use.

This was very tasty.  Only next time I will cut up the beet chunks smaller than the sweet potato chunks, or pre-bake the beets longer, possibly about 30 minutes at 375 (so they don't dry out) as they were not as tender as I like them to be.  I used natural cane sugar, and 4 cloves of fresh garlic.  Then I would finish as directed, at 400 with the rest of the ingredients.

LOVE IT! All 3 of my children (4yr, 2yr and 1yr old) ate it and had seconds.  I added 4 cloves of fresh garlic b/c my husband and son love them.  But the beets were delicious. I didn't think I liked them but tried this b/c I had some and really enjoyed them in this dish.

Not only is this so yummy and a wonderful combinaton of tastes and textures, I love saying "beets and sweets" - it makes me smile.  I would have never thought of tputting these veggies together , but it is now one of our favorite side dishes.

I'd have given it 5 stars but it needed some extra seasoning.  I added rosemary & sage.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe!

I will start by saying that I've never liked beets.  They taste like dirt to me.  But they came in today's CSA box and I wasn't about to compost them.   That being said, this was the least-bad they've ever tasted to me.  The sweet potatoes and onions, however, were delicious.  So, 5 stars (didn't think it was fair to dock points due to my prejudice against the beets, next time I'll use carrots or white potatoes...)

It was with trepidation that I tried this recipe, trying to find a way to use up the fresh beets I'd purchased for xmas, only to be told by my family not to serve them.  Since I just happened to have sweet potatoes and onions on hand I decided to make this recipe and was I pleasantly surprised.  It was delicious!!!!

This was delicious! I wasn't sure what to serve it with and had some significant and varied dietary needs to consider so we made this into the main dish by tossing with brown rice, lentils, toasted walnuts, and a balsamic reduction- a GREAT combination. I think that next time I would make smaller (bite sized) chunks and roast for a shorter time, especially if I were to serve it the same way.

Love, love, love this! I use a lot of fennel seed when I roast mine.  Last night I tossed in some brussels sprouts, also.  Its good with a little chicken Italian sausage on the side.  I never add sugar, its so sweet already!

Yummy!  We'd never tried fresh beets before and this was a perfect way to start.  I used fresh garlic and some brown sugar.  Probably used more of the veggies than recipe calls for but I don't regret having plenty of leftovers!  My 14 month old loved the beets.  The adults added goat cheese to make it a meal.  We will definitely make it again!

I didn't follow this recipe closely but just checked it for the oven temp and time. I baked for 1 hour at 450 to get a nice crust on my potatoes, but I think they would have been ready at 45 minutes. I added some quartered button mushrooms for the last 15 minutes, and didn't use onions, sugar, or garlic. The flavor of the veggies is great with just some olive oil, salt, and pepper.

This would be a 9 on a 10 point scale . . . . Great mix of ingredients. Tweaked amounts to reflect personal tastes: most especially adding much more FRESH garlic & using brown sugar as others suggested. Took to a potluck & only had 10 recipe requests to bring home. Unfortunately, I'm the only one in the household who likes it, though. Still, a wonderful, creative recipe - thanks for sharing.

I used 2 beets, 2 sweet potatoes and an onion, since that's all I had on hand. It turned out really good! I would perhaps add a bit more salt...I could barely taste the seasonings, but the veggies by themselves were delicious!

Too much onion flavour. The sweet potatoes tasted more like onions than sweet potatoes and if you like onions that would be fine, but my husband and I are not real onion likers. I tired this a second time without the onions, used a little chives instead and it was fabulous.

This was great!  I was expecting it to be a bit bland since it is low on spices but wrong!  It was such a great combination of flavors.  I loved the color it brought to the thanksgiving table and the plate too.  Very autumnal.  Will definitely make again.

I love this!  I added parsnips to the mix.  It is great to leave in the hot oven while you are putting things in and out.  I have found that if the oven is at a lower temp, due to other items being in there, it works too.  Just leave them in longer.

This is fantastic. Beets are a pain to work with, but its worth it for this recipe. I used brown sugar rather than regular, but otherwise made as written. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!

This is unbelievably good.  As another user suggested, I used fresh garlic- sliced thinly.  I know many users have suggested using brown sugar for that molasses taste... I just skipped the sugar all together and added a little real maple syrup.  I'm really enthralled by this recipe.  I also cut the recipe down to about 4 servings.  I couldn't believe my 2yo LOVED it too.  Just a little warning on those beets without being gross... the next day... when you... you know... just remember that you ate beets the day before or you'll think there's something wrong with you!

A really nice way to prepare beets and sweet potatoes.  A dinner guest even commented that he really liked this even though he usually doesn't like sweet potatoes.

Wow! I thought I hated beets before I tried this :) Instead of sweet potatoes, I used yams. I had so much fun making this dish, as I've never before cooked with beets. The only thing I didn't care for was the amount of onion in it.

So good!  I only had 3 beets and one sweet potato, so I added 1/2 of a chopped up butternut squash to the mix.  Yummmm!!!!  *This recipe is great as is, but I also drizzled some sweet chili sauce on some after it was coked and it was even better!

These were very good.  I followed the recicpe exactly. I've made it 2x and the first time I used a spanish onion and liked it better than the regular onion.    remember don't think your dying when you eat beets....the toilet water can look pretty red! lol

This is a delightful dish!  The only things I changed was to increase the sugar to 1 Tbsp (used brown sugar) and used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder.  Then instead of tossing the beets separate I just mix everything together in one big bowl, spread on baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes. Comes out perfect every time!

I absolutely love this recipe!! I had gotten some beets from our organic co-op and had tried them in a couple of different recipes. I was about to conclude that I hated beets and would never try to eat them again. Then I found this recipe, followed it exactly and the results were fabulous. Not only do I LOVE the beets cooked this way but I actually crave this recipe now. I'm definitely making this for Thanksgiving and surprising everyone with how much they'll like beets. Thanks so much!!

I made 4 servings using 4 beets and 1 large sweet potato. The 3/4 tsp spices sounded way to much for my personal preference so I used 1/2 tsp of each, which still turned out way too much. Also, I thinnly sliced the sweet potatoes (sticks about 1/2 inch thick)  so they were done in about 15 minutes. Next time I'll use 4 beets, 1 large sweet potato and 1/4 tsp of garlic, salt, and pepper but use 3/4 tsp sugar. Served with "Sweet Baby Carrots" and "Pork Chops to Live For."

This was good, followed recipe exactly.  This was my first time cooking with beets.  It was a bit time consuming peeling the beets & cubing all of them plus the potatoes & chopping onions.  Colorful, healthy, filling & surprisingly tasty side!

Great recipe!  The beets weren't as soft as I'd like, even though I cooked them for 20 minutes instead of 15.  Loved the flavor of the sweet potatoes - the combo of sweet and salty was just right.

Very good and healthy for you too.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder and I didn't see the need to use a plastic bag to mix all the ingredients- can be done easily in a bowl.  I would increase the cooking time of the beets to 20 mins because they were a little bit harder than the yams at the end.  Overall- it was a hit.

This was awesome!  I wanted to add some new veggies to our dinner menu and this let me mix it with something the kids already liked.  I've made it with both onions and without, and didn't notice any major difference.  I did take others' advice and use brown sugar.  That made a big difference.  To make it easier to handle, I cook it in a cassarole dish.  You get a nice sauce which can be poured over it or your meat dish.  This will be going on our Christmas dinner menu for sure!

I LOVE this recipe! I have made it a few times and it is great every time. The best thing about it is you can throw in other vegetables and mix things up. I've added peruvian pototoes before, as well as butternut squash and apples! Always a yummy treat!

This was a big hit. Turned out even better than I thought it would. I used three red and three orange beets, but followed the recipe as directed. I wouldn't change anythng. Very good.

Just wonderful!  I was looking for a beet recipe as I've never tried to cook with them and I'm glad I chose this!  Added some parsnips to bulk it as I didn't have enough beets or sweet potato and it still came out great.  Will certainly use this in heavy rotation.  THANKS!

Very helpful recipe. It was my first time preparing raw beets. My other half does not like sweet potatoes so I used regular potatoes and followed the recipe. Everything tasted wonderful!

I just wanted to let you know that this was excellent!  I have been wanting to cook with beets, and this recipe has made me a true fan.  Everything was so tasty.  I did follow another person's advice, though and turned down the temperature to 350 for the last 20 minutes.  Terrific!

Bravo. I agree with a previous review that the beets could be  more tender. I'll precook them longer next time. I used butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes because that is what I had on hand from our CSA (community supported agriculture). I would bet some pecan halves mixed in about 15 minutes before it is done would be a great addition, especially for a vegetarian main dish.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome.  Just the right combination of savory and sweet.  I roasted the beets for a full half-hour before adding the sweet potatoes and onions--double the suggested time--and I would go even a little longer next time.  I like my beets very soft--as soft as the potatoes.  All the ingredient proportions were perfect, though--not too greasy, too sweet, or too salty.  Just right!!

Beets aren't my favorite things in the world.  Honestly I think of Dwight Schrute when I see them.  But I was given a bag full and this recipe actually made them taste...not bad.  I much preferred the sweet potatoes and onions in this recipe to the beets, but overall not bad.

My guests raved about this easy dish at Christmas. I've been trying for years to find the right replacement for candied sweet potatoes and finally found a keeper. It's also beautiful on the table. Will definitely repeat next year.

Loved the flavors! I wanted a healthier side dish for our holiday dinner. I decided to test this recipe prior to the event. I made a couple of changes, used coconut oil, and brown sugar. I didn't have quite enough beets, but now know to increase the quantity. 
this is a beautiful fall presentation side dish with lots of flavor. I served this with pork chops for this taste . Will definitely keep this in my collection.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and incorporated some minors changes suggested by other reviews. I made enough for 2 baking sheets. With 30 minutes left to cook I added to one of my pans a package of smoked sausage cut into coins. They were a great addition for a complete dinner. Next time I’m going to try add omg some thyme as well.

This was a big hit with my family. Somewhat fussy daughter and very fussy husband! I added a tablespoon of butter and about two tablespoons maple butter, maple syrup would work. I only made half the recipe. Love it and will definitely make it again

I got fresh beets from a friend's garden and wasn't sure what to do with them.  I found this recipe and it was perfect.  I had to stop or I would have eaten the whole pan myself.  I will make this again and am sorry I didn't get more beets when I had the chance.

What a great flavor combination. The recipe took a lot of time for me because of bad back and knees. I never worked with raw beets before, so that part wasn't a quick process (but now I can do it). Anyway, it's 11:30pm here and I just took the tray out of the oven. I scooped out one serving and was sitting at the table. A few minutes later, my son came home from work. Picky, Picky eater. Well guess what? He put the remaining 5 servings into a big bowl and vanished!!! I was going to put the remaining servings into individual containers for the rest of the week because the recipe meets my dietary need to lower cholesterol! Well, at least we have proof perfect that this dish is delicious.

This was really yummy! I put all the veggies in together and only cooked it for 45 minutes. Plus I added some fresh parsley and paired it with some sour cream. Who knew beets could be yummy?

As far as ingredients go I followed the recipe as written.  The only things I changed were quantities: 5 beets, 2 sweet potatoes, and technique:  I oiled and coated the onion and sweets in a bowl rather than in a bag.  Even with fewer veggies there were enough pieces to cover a half-sheet.  We enjoyed these very much!

I made this tonight and for some who do not like fresh beets...it was hands down a new fav in our home. I luv, luv, luv this recipe although I did not use sweet potatoes because I made small red potatoes with paprika and butter as a side dish and baked salmon with asparagus.  I received many compliments with this recipe. I will definitely make this more often.  So far, I have not had negative results with any of the recipes on this website. I have been using recipes from this website for years. So keep up the good work...God bless.

My husband hates beets.  He is not a vegetable fan... period!  He loved this, ate all on his plate and asked for seconds.  If you have picky eaters and are trying to put some vegetables and good nutrition into your menu then make this recipe.  You will be glad you did.

Really great side dish - we loved it. I cooked the beets for 30 minutes, added the sweet potatoes and onions then cooked for another 30 minutes. Omitted the sugar as the beets we are using are very sweet. I will definitely make this again.

This was ok. The sweet potatoes had great flavor, but didn’t really care for it all together. I like beets and sweet potatoes, but I wouldn’t make this again.

Happened to have red onions on hand, instead - loved this dish!!! Made several times and it has always turned up empty.  I'd recommend cooking this in foil, so it stays moist and nice.

my husband and I love this dish.  We do cut the beets a little smaller so that they get a little more cooked.  the other option is just cook them longer before you put on the sweet potatoes

I did it in the microwave; mainly for the reason that it's been too hot to turn on the oven. I will do it again in the oven when the weather is cooler and review better then.

I don't cook beets too often so this was the perfect recipe. Cooked exactly as written and would maybe add some fresh herbs next time to finish them off, but that would be just adding my own touch.

I used it as a vegetarian entree and it was delicious and filling. The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white sugar. Brown sugar just goes better with sweet potatoes.

This was my first time making and eating beets.  I used brown sugar and cooked the beets by themselves for 20 per one of the top suggestions then mixed the seasoning cooked beets and potatoes in the bowl until coated and cooked another 40 months.  While the veggies were roasting I sautéed the beet greens.  After everything was done I sprinkled it all with feta cheese.  This was so delicious.  I will be making this again

Used fresh Beets from the Farmers market & locally grown Sweet Potatoes.  Added Kielbasa the last 15 minutes of cook time.
Everyone loved it.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year (2017) in search of something new.  This was a huge hit.  And the leftovers were even better the next day!  It's a very forgiving recipe.  We added chunks of carrots to it, but I'm sure it's perfect without them.  I will definitely be making it again ... and again...

I used the Cuisinart to do the dicing so everything was perfect 1/2" pieces. It was absolutely the most beautifully  presented item on the table. Besides that it tasted incredible. Even my husband ate it and he doesn't like beets. He said the combination was great. NOTE: Do not over roast the potatoes as they will get mushy.

Delicious, I made it on the stove because no room in oven, the sweet potatoes got mushy but the taste was still yummy. Next time I will roast in oven.

Very colorful and very tasty.  Perfect for Thanksgiving dinner.  The sweet potatoes got a bit dry on the edges, so I'll probably tent it with foil next time, at least for the last fifteen minutes.  There will definitely be a next time.

This is an awesome dish.  I doubled it up for a luncheon and added golden beets.  Kept it warm in a slow cooker for the lunch.  I am going to try and add carrots also next time.  Really loved it's taste and texture!!

It was pretty easy to make, and a great way to eat beets. My daughter enjoyed it very much.

Just asking a question here, thus the mid-point star.  I'll be making this for the holidays for 10 people.  The recipe calls for 10 medium beets and 5 medium sweet potatoes.  Can someone give me an approximate weight for  10 M beets and 5 M sweet potatoes? I'd lik to know that I have the proportions correct. Thanks.
I'm also trying one of these options: 

Easier: roast whole vegetables.  Cool, cut and mix in spices. Omit all or most of the oil.  Serve cold, at room temp or heat in the oven for 15 -20 minutes. 

Easiest: purchase skinned and cooked beets (or canned whole beets) and cooked sweet potatoes.  Roast the onion in the oven. 
Cube beets and sweet potatoes, sprinkle with spices, add to onions. Omit all or most of the oil. Bake for about 30 minutes or until heated through. Serve.

This is delicious! I wouldn't change a thing as far as the ingredients. I baked the beets and sweet potatoes together from the start and only for 40 minutes because they started to look done.

This is pretty decent.  I had to omit the garlic, but otherwise followed instructions and it turned out pretty well.
I have found that seasoning the sweet potatoes and onions with Cajun seasoning and omitting the sugar makes this a whole lot better.

This is easy and turned out great. I substituted a spoonful of brown sugar instead of white. Ate over salad with goat cheese, pistachios and homemade balsamic dressing. Got compliments on it and would make it again.

Fantastic! Will decrease oil & just mix in bowl next time as suggested. Serves aprox 4. 
Very nice over Fried Polenta Slices as an Entree for our Vegetarian guest. 
Even my picky "anti-beet" eater loved it. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe

Very good recipe.  The only change I made was to add some garlic powder to the beets while mixing with the olive oil. And I used a packet of Stevia rather than the sugar.    I'm keeping this one in my recipe files, as it uses two of my favorite vegetables.

I am not a picky eater. (By any stretch of the imagination!) But i have hated....HATED, mind you.....beets for my entire life. Just wanted to give you an Idea about what a 5 star on this recipe means. This is a dish of delish! Yep....I LOVE it! Beets are so good for you that I really wanted a way to get them into my diet. I have had them in smoothies but I don't love them. I have tried them a few other ways and I haven't even LIKED them so far. I am happily surprised and so glad that I finally found a way to enjoy them. Thank you for posting the recipe!

I used beets, sweet potatoes & rutabaga.  Because of the sweetness of the veggies, I omitted the sugar.  Maybe some added herbs would be nice next time to make it more savory.    Carrots and/or parsnips or other root veggies would be good, too.  And I will be making this again!

Very good! My only thing was I questioned cooking the beets first and I would do it opposite the next time and cook the sweet potato first for 15 minutes and then add the beets as ours were a tad over done. I also turned the temp down to 350 for the last 20 minutes as suggested by another reviewer.

I made this and it does not really matter the ratio of sweet potatoes or beets. I did not use as much beets (I used 2 whole ones) and 4-5 sweet potatoes, along with the onion and it worked well! Will be throwing it in the rotation. My kids ate it and even my picky husband (raised to only eat white potatoes) ate all of this!

I don't like sweet potatoes so I only used one and three beets.  I messed up.... there wasn't enough.  I read it wrong and chopped the beets and potatoes together and mixed with oil and items. Roasted 10 min since I chopped small and it was nice and toasted.  New favorite.  Highly recommend this. It's amazing.

This was really yummy. I think the only thing I would change is to cut the pepper in half so that the other flavors pop more.

Well, I was excited from all the reviews, but I thought it was OK. Made it for Thanksgiving. No one really ate it, and now I have to eat the leftovers by myself. And I'm having a hard time doing it. Beet flavor was too strong, the sweet potatoes were mushy. Not much flavor.

I'll admit, I was captivated by the name of this recipe. We already love beets - and which beet-lover doesn't love roasted beets with extra sweets? This recipe was delicious and healthy: I had lots of extra garlic, so crushed some and threw it in along with some uncrushed cloves. I also bought organic beets, so I just scrubbed them really well and didn't bother peeling them. It turned out well, but didn't have the beautiful colors that are in the cover picture. Mine all became beet-tinted. I think the secret to keeping the colors separated is having a big enough pan so that when you throw it all together, you don't have to move the beets much. If I were to make it again, I would add a little more sweet potato and onion and roast it at a higher temperature next time.

Didn't quite get the cooking times right so the beets were firm while the potatoes were too soft. But it smelled wonderful and I enjoyed the flavours. Will definitely  try again.

Delicious but the sweet potato a little too soft... Maybe less 10 minutes of cook time in my oven.
I will certainly use this recipe again!

Made this exactly as the recipes states.  This is so incredibly yummy and colourful.  Enjoyed it so much that I have shared the recipe with my mom.   The only change I will make for the next time is to cook the beets for 25 minutes and then add the sweet potatoes.  This would be a great addition to any family dinner or pot luck!

This recipe couldn't be easier.  I halved the recipe for two people and it was  just right as a main course serving.  Tasty, easy to make and easy cleanup if you put down sheet of foil on the baking pan beforehand.

Great recipe! As others have said, I didn't realize I liked beets this much, aside from pickled. My only substitutions were a clove of fresh minced garlic instead of powder, and maple syrup instead of sugar. My sweet potatoes were the white kind.

What a great recipe for beets. The changes I made was to drizzle a bit of honey on top of the veggies instead of sugar.  I chopped up some zucchini, to match the amount of beets.  My husband would not eat beets before, and he loved this. Will keep this in mind for guests as well as casual nights. Thanks.

I made it as directed, except I cut everything the same size so I put it all in at once. What a simple, tasty recipe! This is my new, favorite way to cook sweet potatoes beyond the holiday dishes.  I used the top rack in the oven and forgot to turn them until I smelled them  The veggies caramalized beautifully and I turned out an elegant, quick dinner with pan seared Ahi Tuna and this. Major yum factor!

I've actually been making this dish for  years now. It is a favorite at my house. We don't add any additional sugar due to the natural sweetness of the beets and I use red garnet yams. I simply chop the veggies, coat in olive oil, sprinkle with with with sea salt and roast. This recipe makes quite a bit but the leftovers (if you have any) make a great addition to rice with some toasted walnuts or almonds on top.

Best veggie side dish ever.  Everyone loves it.  I didn't change a thing and it was great.  The beets get even sweeter when reheated the next day.  I am now making this about twice a week and always have leftovers, but then I probably make twice the amount each time.  I have stopped adding in the sugar because after leaving it out on accident last week I find it makes no difference without it.

It is OK-ish.... I love garlic, but in this dish, was a very bad idea!
I did my best to eat it (I hate wasting food!) but, nobody in my family liked it, so I had to throw half of it away :(
Will not make it again, not even without garlic.

I made this last Thanksgiving for the first time. It has now become a regular addition to my Thanksgiving table. The balance of sweet, salty and flavors of the spices and the root veggies along with the onion melds into a delicious dish! Love it!

Unbelievably delicious!  Could have sworn I hated beets but not after this!  I followed the recipe to a tee and they were superb.  Next time I may leave out the sugar just to make it slightly more healthy.Thanks so much for submitting and changing my mind on this super food:)

I love this recipe. I have made it several times. I cook the beets for a few minutes in the microwave, then toss every thing with the oil mixture and bake them all together. MMM delisious.

I will definitely cut down the salt and the pepper next time I make it, but besides that, it was quite good. It looks so pretty in a glass serving bowl.

This dish has become a staple in my repertoire.   I love the versitality and have made it exactly as written and with carrot and squash additions.  Also like fresh garlic over powder.  I've also discovered that beets that are slightly over the freshness edge work well.

I followed this recipe with the omission of sugar as I don't like things too sweet.  The beets need more of a head start, like at least a half hour.    I had to roast everything much longer so the beets would be soft enough, and by then my yams were too soft.

Easy and delicious. I added the beets into the bowl with the onion and sweet potatoes after the initial 15 minutes and tossed the mixture so the beets were also coated with the sugar + spice mixture.  Everything was lightly caramelized and delish after an additional 35 minutes. Will definitely make again.

Taste great -with a bit of sweetness.
Can eat it as is or with some rice or quinoa.

Very tasty.  I didn't measure the salt and pepper.  Just seasoned to taste.  I also omitted the sugar.  The veggies caramelize and add that hint of sweet that the sugar would bring to the dish.

Update:  I made this dish again tonight.  I substituted avocado oil for the olive oil since it can withstand higher temperature cooking and two cloves of fresh garlic for the garlic powder.  I also decided to try adding a little coconut sugar instead of white sugar and just added salt and pepper to taste.  It smells heavenly!  Perfect for this damp and chilly fall day!

This was fabulous! I mostly followed the recipe but left out the sugar (it doesn't need it). I cut the beets and sweet potatoes into 1/2" cubes and left the skins on the sweet potatoes. It is absolutely delicious!

Modified for one.  I used two beets (cubed and baked for 15 min), then added one sweet potato sub drizzled honey for sugar and half a yellow onion(additional 45 min.) Tossed in a bowl rather than using a bag. Very tasty veggie bake.

We didn't add the salt.  My fiancee put some on his once it was on his plate.  I didnt and it was delicious.  We did do the sugar, but honestly, the sweet potatoes are so sweet I don't know if its needed.  Super high five and will be making this again for sure.

Delicious!!! Normally I don't like beets, but they really compliment the sweet potatoes, I diced the beets a little bigger than a 1/2 inch and they came out super roasted and caramelized. I'm a fan now!

I love this side dish! It's perfect for autumn and winter. It has become a staple on our Thanksgiving table. My husband gets excited every time this is baking in the oven, it smells as delicious as it tastes! We opted to throw some goat cheese over top, after it had cooled a bit, and it turned out incredible! The creaminess of the cheese pairs beautifully with the roasted veggies - we will definitely be adding goat cheese from here on out!!

Will make this again for sure! Only change I made was swapping out the garlic powder for onion powder and used the bowl to mix the onions & yams with the seasoned oil instead of wasting a ziplock bag!

very bland.  not a good combo of spices for the veggies.  try cinnamon instead.  we are usually sweet potato and beet lovers so we will keep looking for a better recipe.

Delicious!!  The only things I did different was... 1. I didn't add sugar. I'm  doing a cleanse and could use all ingredients except sugar. It still turned out awesome!!  2. I put all the ingredients in the oven at the same time. Everything came out tender and perfect.

I don't like sweet potatoes so I went for cut-up butternut squash instead. I also used minced garlic, and brown sugar. So good and will definitely make again!

Tasty and Healthy. I microwaved the beets to save time and energy. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results.

Delightful.  Instead of sugar, I used Spice House's Gateway To The North Maple Garlic Seasoning. Regardless of how good that seasoning mix is, I would give this recipe five stars for it as written. You definitely need to start the beets roasting before the sweet potatoes as it says. Lovely combination.

On second time around, I "enhanced" the recipe.  After cutting the beets & sweet potatoes into chunks, I par-boiled them for 8-10 minutes to make tenderer, then drained well.  Placed beets & potatoes in large bowl and drizzled oil all over, then added onions and dry ingredients (including 1/2 t. sweet mesquite seasoning and pinch of cayenne pepper); tossed well.  Spread on sheet pan and baked per instructions -- except, cut baking time to 25 minutes.  Voilla!

I made this last night. I modified the recipe a bit; I added fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added two potatoes (cut the same size as the other vegetables) since I had them sitting around. :-) 

Next time I will cook the beets longer since they were still pretty hard whereas the sweet potatoes were soft at the end.... maybe 25 minutes alone. 

It tasted great!

This dish is amazing! I already love roasted beets and adding sweet potatoes and onions is a GREAT addition! I made it just like the recipe said. One thing I may try next time is drizzling a  balsamic vinegar on it when serving. I will certainly be making this again!!!

I added  a baking potato since I had one to use. My house smells amazing. This may have been because I used more garlic powder.  Very easy to make.

3.5 stars simply because the beets were pretty tasteless and the dish as a whole was uneventful.  Make sure the veggies are cut bigger than bite size and a tad bit firm when taking out of the oven so they don't mush together when stirring.  Next time do more yams and less beets and add brown sugar.
Stir every 20 minutes.

I thought the recipe turned out a little dry. My husband and I put Italian dressing on top after it was baked and that helped a little. Or you could try Mayo on the side too.

Why add sugar? This recipe (with minced garlic instead of powdered) and NO SUGAR is excellent. The beets are so sweet on their own. I could not give more stars to this recipe b/c of the sugar.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner today, and it was great! We didn't have all the ingredients, so I made a few substitutions (red onion instead of sweet onion and brown sugar instead of white sugar). I did not bother putting the potatoes, onions, and olive oil mixture in a Ziploc bag. I just dumped it in the same large bowl I used for the beets and mixed everything with my hands. Anyway, it complemented the turkey and other sides perfectly-- thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was delicious! I inhaled it. However, mine was done roasting after 30 minutes with the vegetables chopped about the size of grapes, so I would recommend watching them carefully so that they don't burn or overcook.

It was my first time preparing beets and I was skeptical, but roasted beets are delicious! Loved them paired with sweet potatoes and onion. Will make again.

Easy minus the chopping, beautiful in presentation and even vegetable-haters were impressed with the flavor.  I will use this recipe again and again for the holidays.  A real winner!

I've made this several times, I add a little more black pepper but other than that, I make it as written. If you have beet lovers for dinner, this is a huge hit every time. If you have people who are on the fence about beets, they'll still eat it. Plus, it is such a pretty dish, I always get comments when I put it on the table.

I found this recipe tasty but the black pepper was TOO MUCH.  I even tried rinsing some of the pepper off after cooking and couldn't.  I tried pawning it off on other people and although the recipe ingredients are all delicious, the pepper was too much for every tongue that tried it.  If you have lots of tastebuds like me and are sensitive to pepper, cut the pepper down to 1/4 of a teaspoon or none at all.  Tried it without pepper and it was much better.  Beets were sweet and earthy and, as usual, the sweet potatoes were like dessert.  Enjoy!

I made this recipe tonight for the first time. I pulled it up on my phone to remind me of the ingredients and directions. I left out the sugar by accident...but it turned out that I didn't need it cause it was sweet on its own. I absolutely loved it!!! I will be making this again for Thanksgiving or whenever I can!

I made this recipe using beets only as someone else was bringing a sweet potato dish to the Thanksgiving dinner I was going to. I used about 20-30 beets..fresh locally grown candy cane beets.These beets got rave reviews from all who tried them..even some of the kids!
would like to try the full recipe with sweet potatoes soon!

I love this recipe!  I'm always looking for new ways to prepare beets and this is a keeper.  It's the perfect blend of sweet and salty.  I also made it with Truvia instead of sugar and it was still delicious.

Fabulous recipe!  I made this last fall for a group of visitors out in a public garden where I work--we get a taste from the garden and a tip appropo from the season.  Everyone loved it! Thank you for a great (and colorful) recipe!

Wonderful! I went with the fresh garlic (just left whole, baked during the final 15min to avoid burning), also left the beets longer to bake, as other Reviewers, I found the beets needed more than 15min's head-start. I didn't do the bag mix, either. Just dashed the salt & pepper all over, having put the oil in the pan and stirred the veggies pre-cooking to ensure they were properly covered. 

Also, I skipped the sugar. The sweet potatoes were sweet enough as they were. 

So good. Can't wait to make again!!

Thank you for this recipe!! This combination is great with quinoa. Because I love experimenting with flavors, here’s my variation on it (in a round roaster in the oven):

1 large sweet potato
3 small beets from my garden
1/4 an onion
3 cloves of garlic
pumpkin seeds
juice from 1/2 an orange
splash of red wine leftover from last night
olive oil
brown sugar
salt 
pepper

Delicious!  Based on other reviews, it cut the beets & potatoes on the small side and cooked for the time noted in the recipe.  Both were firm but cooked through.  Whirled the beets up in Baby Bullet for my youngest and she gobbled them up.  Awesome recipe.

I followed some of the advice on the reviews, such as halfing the amount of pepper, increasing amount of sugar to 1 Tblsp, and substituting brown sugar.  Also, all I had were yellow onions, but still this was great.  My kids couldn't get enough of this dish!  I also reduced the heat to 350 during the last 20 minutes of baking time, and it was perfect!

I followed the other suggestions and cooked the beets a bit longer by themselves-about 30 minutes. This dish was delicious and a great sid to any meal!

I tried this tonight, to test before thanksgiving and it was excellent! I used can of Julianne cut beets, 1/2 the pepper and brown sugar instead like others suggested. It was delicious! I'm not a beet fan but this was yummy and wonderful. I'm on weight watchers so beets are free points so gave it a try. I will be adding this to my annual list. If you like sweet potatoes and are looking for something different, look no further!

I love beets and I love sweet potatoes, but this recipe is definitely less than the sum of its parts.  Very disappointing, and a waste of good ingredients.

First time trying beets. I used yellow beets. I thought this was delicious. Second time I made it I added some smoked paprika and thought it was great too.

This recipe is absolutely AMAZING!  I think I may have cut the chunks too small.  Everything was done in 35 minutes.  I did shrink the serving size down to 2.  Other than that, followed the recipe to the letter.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I bought some beets at the store trying to expand our menu options.  I wasn't sure how I wanted to cook them and then I found this recipe.  The only change I made was that I used dark maple syrup instead of sugar.  I will be making this often!  Thank you!

This was fantastic! The first time I cooked fresh beets, I roasted them with russet potatoes. Then I found this recipe, and they taste AMAZING with the sweet potato! I could eat this every day, thank you!

This was a wonderful dish, I would definitely make it again. I would go well with roasted turkey, pork tenderloin, etc., and it's a nice change from the standard roasted & seasoned potatoes.

We purchased beets at the farmers market and were looking for something new to do with them. We had a few friends over and even the ones who swore off beets said they were good! We had a few white potatoes as well and threw them in the mix. Thanks for the recipe!

Well, the verdict is still out on whether I like beets. But this was interesting, to say the least. I liked the flavor of the roasted beets, just wasn't sure about the texture. And since I wasn't sure how soft they should be, I think I overcooked them a bit. Before serving, I crumbled a little bit of fresh goat cheese on top, which made this dish awesome, with melty goat cheese, how can one go wrong?

I really liked this recipe and the fact that it is from fresh, natural ingredients - not boxed or canned! I would probably roast the beets about 10-15 minutes longer than suggested so that they are as soft as the sweet potatoes.

Very simple to make and very tasty!  I only gave it 4 starts because it was just a bit too peppery for my taste but my family gave it 2 thumbs up and requested I make it again.  Great way to get healthy root vegetables in our diet.

I would have never thought to mix beets with sweet potato's, but it was an excellent combo.  I will definitely make this again.

I liked the flavor of this dish immensely.  The first time I made it, the beets were not quite tender enough.  So the second time I added a bit of water to steam & and baked it with the lid.  Then I removed the lid for the last 15 minutes or so.  My family liked this, even the kids!

I also used fresh garlic and beets that I grew in my new garden.
This was awesome and my two young daughters ate it up with me. I will make this again & again.
Easy and yummy.

Don't cut beets too small because they shrunk a bit. Cooked beets 20 min then added potato and onion. Next time I will line the pan with foil to make cleanup easier. Thanks for a fantastic recipe. I will add this to my holiday recipe.

There is some discussion of having to like beets to like this recipe. Not so in my house. Non-beet eaters loved these.

Beets turned black, destroying the attractive look it had when raw. Family did not care for taste.

I'm looking forward to trying this recipe again.  Watch it closely towards the end, especially if you cut the veggies small.  Mine came out overdone but we still ate every bite!

Was looking for a good recipe that had fresh beets in it.  This was a tasty combination.  My husband who isn't a big veggie eater even said it was good.  Not such a great hit with my 3 younger children, but at least they tried it.  I will definately make again!  Thanks for sharing.

My husband said he'd like to eat beets so I tried out this recipe.  Yummy!  What a great combination and so easy too.  My one year old gubbled up as much as I ate which was amazing.  This will be a keeper!

I really liked this dish. Maybe I didn't cut the pieces small enough, but my beets needed to cook about ten extra minutes than the recipe said. I also will use more garlic next time.

Very good way to use up sweet potatoe and beets. The flavour of the veggies really come out. I added carrots, it was great.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I put the beet chuncks in a resealable plastic bag and added some olive oil and shook it.  I cut up the onion into chunks, to match the beets and sweet potatoes, instead of chopping.  It was a nice change to Thanksgiving dinner.

It was my first time buying beets and was not sure how  to cook them and my first thought was to go to All Recipes. Thank you, they were great, the only thing I changed was I added a little maple syrup at the end and used garlic oil (I didnt have garlic powder) they were great and they had a little Canadian twist.
