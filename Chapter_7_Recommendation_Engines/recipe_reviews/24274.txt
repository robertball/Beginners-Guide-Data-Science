I made this today for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  I used extra creamy Cool Whip with the softened cream cheese to lessen "watering" of whip cream and for ease of making ahead.  I also chopped several celery stalks to add texture as was suggested by another Reviewer.  I also used Raspberry Jello.  This Salad is fabulous.  I had to add a bit of orange juice to the fresh cranberries to get them processed.  I used heavy pulp and I have found a new BEST SALAD EVER!

This is the best cranberry salad ever!  I make it exactly how the recipe states and have gotten rave reviews from everyone, including my dad's family who is the ultimate food critic.  Try this, you won't be let down.

Oh my goodness!  This is the most delicious cranberry salad recipe I have ever had!  I have made many different cranberry recipes over the years, but this one stands a head & shoulders above the rest.  I used raspberry for the jello, & since I had about a cup of glazed pecans left in the frige, I beat 'em up in the food processor & dumped them in.  Delish!

This is wonderful. I used canned whole cranberries so I could skip the sugar/pan thing. Next time I will use a red delicious apple; I used a granny smith and it was a little too tart. My mother used to make something like this, and it really brought back good memories.

I make a cranberry salad/relish every year and this is my favorite recipe!  The only thing I do different is to keep the whip cream mixture separate so everyone can add to their own to suit their tastes.  I also add a cup of finely chopped celery to the salad...mmm

I *love* this recipe. It has been adopted as a permanent addition to our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners line-up and my family hasn't ever been big on Cranberry Salads in the past. Leftovers don't last long in our house! It's good enough to be a dessert!  It's easy to replace the sugar with Splenda and the Gelatin with the Sugar Free kind, and makes it a bit more diabetic friendly but doesn't compromise the taste.

Our entire family liked this recipe.  I used what I had which was 1 box of orange and 1 box of red jello.  I also used canned whole cranberries.  After dinner we mixed the whip cream/cream cheese into the entire salad and added marshmallows and that added a lot to it.  This was good as the recipe called or with adding extra stuff.

This was a great recipe. Everyone in my family loves it. I made and took it to last years Thanksgiving at my in-laws. Before I left I had atleast three request for the recipe. This year I was asked to make and bring it with me again. Just follow the recipe. I would recommend black cherry gelatin, but that is just a personal preference. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and am certainly planning on making it again.   It has such a beautiful presentation when served in a glass bowl so that you can see the layers.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing.  I did use only real whipping cream, a little work, but well worth it, for this beautiful salad I would not be using the frozen stuff.  For the jello I use a cherry/black cherry fusion by Jello Brand, out of this world good.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  Even my picky friends who don't care for cranberries loves this!!

I made this salad just as the recipe's written, and it was the biggest hit of our Thanksgiving dinner.  Even my husband, who jokingly calls any jello salad "a pain in the butt, and a waste of space on the Thanksgiving table" had to eat his words.  This salad has so much texture, and the creamy layer gives just the right amount of sweetness.  It was the perfect complement to all of the heavier, traditional things like turkey and stuffing.  Thank you very much for this great recipe!

This is the first review I've written.  This is not only delicious, it so pretty.  Following another cook's suggestion, I used Cool Whip instead of whipping cream and it was great.  If you are cutting calories, you could eliminate the cream cheese and just use Cool Whip.  YUM!

I gave this one 5 stars, because the salad itself is too wonderful...I could eat the whole thing by myself (and frequently do). But the cream cheese layer didn't add anything to it, at least not as written in the original recipe. I'm a lover of all things cream cheese, but this was just bland. I will always make this salad, but if I decide to add the cream cheese layer again someday, I will used sweetened whip cream, not plain whipping cream.

Wonderful.  I feel a need to put something with cranberries on my menu, and even the little ones ate this.  I was asked to share this recipe, and that is the best compliment one can receive!  Don't change this recipe.

This reminds me of the cranberry salad my mother always made, grinding everything with the hand-grinder. It is delicious!! I made this exactly as the recipe call for and took it to work for a party..everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. It is more like a desert than a salad.

Really good and easy.  I totally forgot to add the cream cheese to the whipped cream, but it still was wonderful!  I may just make it that way next time too.  I tried shredding my Red Delicious apple, but it wasn't working too well, so I diced it up real small.  I used Raspberry jello.  I think Cherry would be great too.

A hit! My family and I are not big fans of cranberries, and I only serve the obligatory dish at Thanksgiving. But this dish puts a whole new spin on the berry, and I had to print additional copies of the recipe for enthusiastic guests. I didn't have any nuts--which it needs, and I diced the apples instead of grating. I also chopped up a stalk of celery. I only had about 5 oz. of cream cheese, and I mixed that with a whole 8 oz. carton of whipped topping. Layered as directed, and served in a glass bowl. Gorgeous!

i LOVED this! my family seemed to enjoy it too, although i could have easily halved the recipe and still served 8. It is very sweet, which I liked, but when I make this again I will only use 1/2 c. sugar. So good! i had a second helping instead of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving!

If you have any relatives who don't like cranberries, this is your recipe!!!  The textures and sweetness with the creamy layer make this a go-to for family holiday gatherings.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I think the creamy part should be doubled.  It didn't make enough for my taste.  For those who suggested adding celery - I think it's totally unnecessary.  There are so many flavors and textures here, I didn't find the need.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I did not have fresh cranberries instead I used canned whole cranberry sauce and it turned out very well. I loved the creaminess of cream cheese and whipping cream. Will be making this again

Very good, the only thing that I will change for next time, just add wipping cream individually as they serve the plate. Exclude the cream cheese.

Yummy!  I added celery and used cool whip instead of whipped cream.  I doubled the recipe for a slighty larger than 13x9 pan.  It was a hit and I was asked for the recipe by many.  Thanks for a keeper!

This is a great salad and pretty presentation.  The directions weren't clear on to what level you "process the cranberries" so I left them in small pieces but not mushy.  Turned out great.  I did use cool whip with the cream cheese and added just a bit of powdered sugar to the mixture - yum!

I have been making this for several years one year by accident my mother in law used frozen blueberries instead of cranberrys.  It was wonderful so every year after that I use half cranberrys and half blueberrys.  Sweetens it up a bit.  Also instead of orange juice I grind the whole orange peel and all.  It is one of our holiday favorites.

This is the best cranberry salad there is. I actually prefer mine without the cream cheese layer. It's so cool and refreshing I thought why not have it in the summer. I bought several bags of cranberries when they were on sale during the holidays and froze them to use later. They last for months in the freezer with no preparation and believe me this salad is a welcome treat in the summer.

I  made 1/2 of this  for our  holiday meal and  put it in a glass 8 by 8 dish.  It is very  good. I also added some powdered sugar to the cream filling.It is very easy to layer the salad: the  jello layer then the cream- looks pretty-- and taste  so good!

Very good, made for Thanksgiving dinner today. I was concerned about letting it sit overnight, thought it might be too congealed to layer the next morning..it was congealed but easy to work with. The layer in the middle blends very well with the tartness of the salad. I will be making again for Christmas, everyone really liked it, even some that I thought wouldn't. Definitely a keeper. The only change I made was to add 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar to the cream/cream cheese mixture. It gave it a very slight sweetness, not too much.

Great raw cranberry recipe.  Used drained pineapple juice as part of the liquid along with the oj. Subbed whipped topping as some suggested.

Super tasty! But we had 30 for dinner and could have used only half of the recipe. And since I couldn't find cranberry jello I used black cherry and felt like it was to strong of a flavor.

I love, love this recipe!  I make this every year for the holidays at the request of my family.   I also use Raspberry Jello, glazed pecans and I add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the whipped mixture because I like it sweet.   This is hands down my favorite dish to bring to the party!

Love, Love, Love this recipe and so does everyone else!  In order to have enough and fill my glass serving dish, I doubled the cranberry portion of the recipe.  Also, Cherry  & Cherry Lemonade Jello add a nice flavor.  As for the whipped cream & cream cheese filling, I used 8 ounces of cream cheese, but, I increased the Whipping cream to 1 1/2 cups & added 2 - 3 tablespoons of Confectioners sugar.  I filled the Center with 3/4 of the whipped cream mixture then finished off the top with small dollops of the remaining 1/4.  Photo added.

Wow!  This tasted great and I was pleasantly surprised when my non cranberry eating family members had second helpings (even after claiming to be too full).  I made it with black cherry jello and stuck to the recipe.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Will definitely be making it again.  Thanks!

This is a show stopping crowd pleaser. Personally, I always said I didn't like cranberry relish. Well, that's not true anymore. I made a mistake and used 3oz jello raspberry packet instead of 6 oz the first time I made it and I'm glad I did. It just soft sets it although it will hold a slight shape. Doesn't make it seem like jello at all that way. Now that I understand how we like it I sightly cut back on the liquid too. It is good even without the cream cheese mixture, but that does make it better. ?? I found it difficult to spread the cream cheese mixture so now I put it in plastic quart zipper bag, seal, cut a snip from a corner and I pipe it in circles between layers of the relish. super fast and makes a pretty edge of layering in the glad bowl.

It was ok for me. Others at the table liked it. I think the problem was instead of whipping heavy cream I used extra creamy Cool Whip. If I made again I would whip the heavy cream

Made this for my family for Thanksgiving (2-years ago) and followed the recipe exactly. They were in love. They now request this multiple times per year and ALWAYS at Thanksgiving now. We are usually a canned cranberry sauce family but not anymore!

Made it for thanksgiving and it was wonderful!  Was going to make it again for tomarow, thought I had everything except I bought 1 - 3 Oz pk of raspberry jello.  I had a 6 Oz box of lime jello.  Anyone think this may work or should I run to town for another 3 Oz raspberry jello?

This salad is delicious with great texture and flavor.  I used raspberry Jello and about 2 cups of Cool Whip in place of the whipping cream, and finely chopped my apple (a Gala) rather than grating it.  I layered it in a vintage glass salad bowl and garnished the top with 3 whole cranberries and 3 pecan halves placed artfully in the middle.  I didn't take time to sweeten the 3 whole cranberries, so I warned everyone not to eat them unless they really wanted a tart bite.

Don’t know why this recipe ended up so watery. The flavors were very nice, used the raspberry jello and did use well drained fresh pineapple that I shredded in the food processor. Also, added a handful of celery.  Tasted nice, but was a watery mess. Not sure I would make again.

Really like this, will make again. Made it for Christmas dinner & it was a hit. Not too sweet, like the texture of cranberries chopped in food processor, crushed pineapple & grated apple. Then pared with the cream cheese mixture. I used cool whip instead of whipping cream

This was so easy and delish! I used strawberry gelatin- you could potentially serve this minus the whipped cream topping but it sure looks prettier when you layer it! Definitely a recipe we'll use year-to-year.

This was a hit - pretty and delicious!!  I doubled the recipe and added about 1 cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheese/whipping cream mixture.  This filled a large trifle bowl with seven layers.

This is so so delicious. Served it with Christmas dinner and received good reviews and requests for the recipe. I used cranberry flavored jello and I omitted the pecans in hopes my kids would eat it better. They liked it. I would however recommend the pecans as they would provide good texture. Will be adding this to my Christmas menu every year.

Have made this several times and even my family members who do not care for cranberries love it.  I have had to start freezing bags of cranberries so I can make it of season.  No need to alter the recipe, it is great as is.

Have made this several times now and it's always a hit. More like a dessert than a salad and the flavors blend perfectly.   Even the ones who dislike cranberries love this one.  When making individual servings, it's best to keep them small - this is pretty filling . Don't change a thing and watch it disappear! Thanks for a great recipe.

I put it in parfait dishes and it was pretty and Christmassy.  Froze it and it came out fine.  I would only let the jello set up about ten minutes in the refrigerator next time, and add jello when it's thick and runny still.

A few folks around the Thanksgiving table had special dietary needs so I modified it a bit. I used unflavoured gelatin in 100% juice (I used cranberry grape apple blend), I also skipped the white sugar and put some organic honey with the cranberries. 
It doesn't look red, but tasted delicious, everyone with modified diets was able to eat it and all enjoyed it! Made this way there are no dyes, artificial flavors, processed sugars or corn syrup. I think I'd make this again

I have made this for the past 5 years for Thanksgiving.  One year, I had forgotten to mix it up.  At 12:30 am, my daughter said "It's not Thanksgiving without the Cranberry Salad!!".  Needless to say, I was up for another 30 minutes getting the cranberry and fruit mixture in the refrigerator for dinner later that day.

I have made this several times for Thanksgiving and for Christmas. The family raved and teenage boys gobbled it up! They were the ones requesting I make it again. Very easy, great flavors. If people have nut allergies, just omit those but it does give it a crunchy quality.

This is the best fresh cranberry dish I have ever made! I made it for Thanksgiving and my husbands family LOVED it!! I used sugar free raspberry jello, lt cream cheese, lt cool whip, and I added some powdered sugar and a smidge of vanilla to the topping part. It had a light cheese cake flavor! I am making it again for Christmas with my family!!I serve it in a truffle bowl with 2 layers of each and sprinkle the nuts on top. Love, love, love it!

Holy delish! I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday & it was a hit! I used sugar free raspberry Jell-O & added 2 tbsp. of powdered sugar to the whipping/cream cheese mixture. Next time I will make the whipping cream mixture the night before too so that it stiffens in the fridge. I think that would probably help the layering presentation. This dish will easily become a Thanksgiving regular in my house!

I used whole cranberries canned and extra creamy cool whip. Every one loved I added celery chopped along with apple it was great. Not sad about getting stuck with the jello salad this year.

This is by far the best cranberry Jello salad ever! I have made it twice in  week if that tells you anything! I made it for Christmas dinner and got request to make it again or New Years Eve. The only think different was I added a little sugar when I whipped the heavy cream. I used Raspberry Jello like suggested! So good and very pretty! Today I am going to use Cool Whip and light cream cheese just to take away a few calories and fat. I highly recommend you make it!!!

To sweet.  I used regular jell-o and a cup of sugar.  I think using sugar free jello would have been a better option. It had a nice consistency and it was pretty.

We had this for Christmas dinner and it was my favorite thing on the table. It was great and really fruity.  I changed the top a little and used Cool Whip instead of whipping cream and it was yummy.

All gone when I went back after my dish at the covered dish dinner!  Cream cheese perfectly compliments the tangy cranberries!
