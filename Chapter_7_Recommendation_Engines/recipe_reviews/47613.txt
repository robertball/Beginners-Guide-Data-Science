I just bought some snap peas because they looked so good and I didn't know what to do with them.  This is a GREAT recipe.  To the person who gave it only three stars: you didn't follow the recipe, you didn't use the ingredients, you didn't follow the directions and said you "aren't sure if you will try it again" you gave three stars to your OWN recipe, not this one.  Post your own mediocre recipe for snap peas and don't comment on one that you didn't even follow.

This is a GREAT recipe.  The natural flavor of the sugar snaps are utmost.  One thing to remember, which I didn't do my first time making this recipe, is to remove and discard the stem end and the string from each pod.  If you don't do this you will be chewing on the stem and string and will have to spit it out which is not too appealing, other than that this is a very, very good vegetable dish.  Way to go CC!!

Great flavor, simple, quick. Thanks for the recipe. I used garlic and onions (both finely chopped) instead of shallot since i didnt have any.

used two tablespoons finely chopped onions, 2 cloves of garlic, poured olive oil on the beans, sprinkled some onion salt, shook the contaner up, stuck it in the toaster oven and voila!  Snap peas that taste like it's from a fine dining restaurant!  Husband's exact words, "These are seriously the best beans I've ever had," a couple of times.  Thank you and God bless.

I forgot to add the shallot but this was still terrific. Also used dried thyme. Served with a salmon and rice dish (also from this site). Flavors complemented each other very well. This was such a quick and easy recipe especially since I used a bag of frozen sugar snap peas. Will make this many more times.

This was delicious, a nice change from stir frying pea pods.  I used pea pods that we had frozen from our garden.  I didn't have any shallots on hand, so I sprinkled a little onion powder and garlic powder with the rest of the seasonings and olive oil in a bag, then spread out on a cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil.  Bake for the time and temperature given and they were wonderful.  Thanks for a great new side dish recipe.

Easy and tasty.  If you use fresh snap peas, trim off the ends and pull strings like another rater mentioned.  I put all the ingredients in a bowl and tossed them before putting them in the oven.  I put some some garlic powder in used regular onions since I didn't have any shallots.  Delicious.

These were awesome!  So easy and so delicious.  I made just as the recipe dictated, except used dried thyme instead of fresh.  Be sure to use fresh snap peas...so crispy!  This is a great and healthy green veggie to add to your holiday feasts, or for everyday pleasure.

I love just about any vegetable roasted in the oven, and this didn't disapoint.  I only gave 3 stars because the recipe missed a critical step:  make sure that you remove the ends and string down the side of the pea pod, or it will be really difficult to eat.

Other than that-  yum!  I added a bit of lemon zest as a garnish, and it added a nice, fresh note.

This basic recipe works for a lot of roasted vegetables including broccoli, asparagus, fresh green beans, baby potatoes,  and of course the sweat peas.

My common method to prep for roasted veggies is to mix all ingredients in a large stainless mixing bowl and spread out a single layer on a foil lined baking pan. The most common ingredient usually includes some sort of fat such as olive oil. There are countless variations to herbs that can be added or omitted based on personal preference. As often as I can, I use Freeze-Dried Herbs (Litehouse Brand) My reason is that I do not have to worry about a lot of “fresh” stuff going to waste.

Based on a pre-heated 450 oven, the 7 – 8 minute time is a good base-line time for broccoli and green vegetables. 15 – 18 minute time usually works for baby spuds (quartered)

I placed cherry tomatoes on the baking sheet with the snap peas; it was all delicious.  Be sure you pierce the tomatoes first.

Quick, easy and delicious.  The flavor of the sugar snap peas really came through and was enhanced with this recipe.  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used 1/2 tsp of dry ground.  I also mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and tossed the sugar snap peas as other have suggested.  I wouldn't add more oil.  Some have said their result was oily.  With just the one tablespoon of olive oil I found they were perfect.

Okay, did a little something different.  Had no olive oil, so used a little bit of peanut oil.  Had no shallots, used powdered onion & gran. garlic.  Used some oregano....okay shoot, I pretty much revampted this, but this recipe still gave me my creative edge.  Still baked at 450 degress for 8 minutes.  Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I roasted these in the toaster oven to avoid heating up the kitchen too much.  I added some minced garlic and tossed it in with the rest of the ingredients.  Next time I'll leave out the thyme because I didn't really think it went well with the peas.  I took these to work and ate them cold as a snack.  Very, very good.  Thanks so much, CJCOLLINS.

My family was not crazy about this recipe.  Little oily.  I did not have shallots, so I used sweet onion.  I thought it was just okay.

Too oily. I liked the roasted flavor and the herbs. Found the shallots to be unnecessary, though. Would not make again as written.

This goes excellent with steak. I am not a big fan of peas of any type but wow, these were good. They had a wonderful flavor and the seasonings didn't overpower the sweetness of the peas. My hubby and daughter loved these too. A Keeper! Thanx CC!

Fantastic!!  This is the first time I have ever made snap peas and they were great.  Like another reviewer, I didn't use shallots, but finely diced onions and a sprinkling of garlic powder.

Great way to use FRESH sugar snap or snow peas.  Just lightly coated the sugar snaps w/ olive oil in a bowl.  Then tossed with the shallots and thyme.  Cooking time was longer than 8 minutes - but came out crist/tender.  Recommend.

Excellent!  I used fresh sugar snap peas.  I didn't have a shallot on hand, so I used a small amount of finely-diced sweet onion and a little garlic.  Used fresh thyme from my garden.  Will definitely make again!

This was really good, I'm only giving 4 starts because I couldn't do it as is...I didn't have anymore shallots or thyme to add so I added onion salt and garlic powder. Very big hit. I had to basically stand guard of them till they went in the oven; my husband ate almost half before they even went in. Thank you so much for the different way of cooking the peas. Next time I will add your suggested shallots and thyme.

I don't really like sugar snap peas, so this recipe was a good way to disguise the taste of them in order to get rid of the bag that was sitting in my freezer.  Good flavoring.

I put the peas and oil in a covered bowl and tossed a few times to coat the peas before putting on the baking dish.  I didn't have shallots so used sesame seeds.  I didn't put thyme on.  I thought these were okay.  I don't know if I will make these again.

I buy fresh sugar snap peas just to have something to snack on in the fridge.  Love that I now have a recipe that will turn my snack into a great side dish!  Only modification I had to make was using dry thyme instead of fresh.  Tasted great!

Wow. Easy, delicious and elegant. I followed the recipe exactly and got rave reviews from my husband, who isn't a big veggie fan. I had fresh thyme on hand and I do think that made it even better, but I'd assume you can use dried as well and still get tasty results.

I couldnt find kosher salt at the store. I used sea salt, and the fresh thyme and shallot. I think the salt flavored the peas more than the thyme and shallot did. Pretty good anyway. Thank you.

This recipe is simply too great for words!  I am a gourmet cook, and have found very few recipes that are really delicious to be this simple.  I used the exact ingredients called for, but admittedly, didn't use perfect measurements.  I probably used a little extra olive oil, just enough to coat the peas generously by tossing them on a foil-lined cookie sheet vs using a brush. I used fresh shallots generously, and had fresh thyme on hand, which I think is key to the wonderful outcome. As for the sugar snap peas, I cannot imagine anyone using frozen in this recipe, and thinking that it could possibly be a reasonable substitution!Thanks a bunch CJCOLLINS for this amazing recipe!

These turned out tasty and I am not usually a big fan of sugar snap peas - I didn't have fresh thyme so I substituted dried.

Um, I have to disagree with everyone's rave reviews.  I used frozen sugar snap peas, shallots, and dried thyme.  The shallots were great, but the sugar snap peas tasted one-dimensional.  I also found that I don't like baking the peas.  They're much better stir-fried.

Made this tonight and everyone agreed.. best snap peas ever.. I didn't have shallots, so used chopped sweet onion..  I also added a tiny bit of chopped roasted garlic.  Put everything (except salt) in a ziplock bag..  shook it up to evenly season..  after spreading on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, I added the salt and baked for 8min..  PERFECT!

My husband loves snap peas but I had no real recipe to prepare them.  I fixed this last night adding the 2 cloves of garlic and cherry tomatoes as suggested.  I mixed it all in a bowl to coat first as other reviewers suggested.  They came out wonderful and my hubby was praising me all evening for the good meal.  They were a side dish to the Caramelized Baked Chicken by Sandy found on this site and I made Fried Wild Rice with Corn to go with them.

I did exactly as recipe said and did not like it. The shallots tasted uncooked (too raw onion-y - like). and I did not like the thyme flavor. I think I prefer the original flavor of sugar snap peas over this recipe.

These were fabulous. I put all the ingredients in a ziplock bag to really coat them and then baked them for 6 minutes. They were still crispy which is how I like them. Thanks for sharing. I served them with the Rosemary Chicken with Orange Glaze recipe on this site and jasmine rice.

This is a great nice easy way to make snap peas.  Takes ten minutes to throw together and they come out tasting really sweet and yummy.  I used dried thyme because I didn't have fresh and it worked just fine. Definitely a keeper.

I also, like another reviewer, used "plenty" of olive oil; perhaps too much, as they were a little "greasy". But, overall an excellent recipe; flavor is incredible when you use the fresh thyme, so don't substitute dried. As per another reviewer, mix all together in a bowl (perhaps the bowl you're going to serve them in to save on washing) and transfer to a baking sheet.

I tried sugar snap peas in the past and I did NOT like them. I am attempting to eat more veggies so I thought I would try them again. They were wonderful and I didn't even have any thyme. Otherwise, made as is. I had to go to the store to buy more peas because they were so good. Good and simple.

This recipe was a perfect starter on preparing sugar snap peas. It would be fantastic with a variety of flavor combinations, but the cooking method itself was simple and absolutely perfect. I didn't have any shallots, so used green onion and dried thyme and it was delicious.

These were alright.  I was warned ahead of time when i read the reviews that you get musy peas if you use frozen....well i used forzen and i got mushy peas.  They were still good though.  Definately a good change of pace from steamed.  Will make again if i can find fresh peas.

Good side dish!  Altered to use what I had on hand...dried thyme instead of fresh, minced onions and garlic instead of shallots.  I think next time I will mix in a bowl prior as per other suggestions.

I didnt have shallots , kosher salt or fresh thyme.  So I used sweet onions cut small, regular salt and dried thyme.  I used olive oil cooking spray.  I had to cook them longer than 8 minutes.  Over all this was very easy and came out tasty.

Excellent!  Used shallot salt with the olive oil.  Definitely don't need a lot of either.  I will try the sesame seeds next time.  A great way to add more green to one's diet.

I made these sugar snap peas last night for a dinner party I had along with Curry Chicken.  They were delicious and very easy to make.   Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Excellent! Of course, the snap peas themselves do not need much to make a delicious roasting veggie. I had eaten these raw and they are delicious! Roasting them brings them to a whole new level. I used some lemon thyme and added about a tablespoon of chopped onion chives. Other than that, followed the recipe to a tee. Roasted for 9 minutes at 450. My husband was more impressed with them than the main dish, which was homemade chicken tarragon crepes. That's OK. I loved them too! Will definitely make these again and again,

Rated this a five star because it is an easy recipe and I love the fact that I don't have to use the stove!  Unfortunately, we did not like the Thyme.  That is just our preference.  The second time I made these I did not use thyme and added chopped fresh garlic.  Yummy.

YUM! Don't forget to clean the pea pods first and to take that fiber string out of the middle before you cook them.  I got a bag of them from Costco and the were washed but not de-strung.  Hubby told me a nice story about how one time they hadn't been De strung and everyone that had eaten them had a stomach ache.  I asked him if he had told the person who had cooked them, that's when he kindly told me it had been me! He is so sweet to not have blamed me for it back then, but to warn me this time! Anyway, these were very good and I cant wait to make them again!

I had never thought of baking sugar snap peas! This is great and sooooo easy! I used dry shallots and thym because it's what I had on hand. The only detour apart from that was a squeeze of fresh lemon juice which added a nice note. I'll remember this one! Thank you! : )

Really delicious and easy! I used half the olive oil and next time would use even less. I also added the shallots, 2-3 cloves of fresh garlic crushed, and the fresh thyme. Nice change from the stir fry with mushrooms. Will definitely make it again this way. My husband also loved it too!

Very good! Used red onion diced fine and put it all in a ziplock to coat the peas. Much easier than brushing. Dumped it all in an aluminum coated pan. Great dish and easy clean up!

I thought these tasted pretty good. It was handy that they happen to be packaged in 8oz bags in the produce section. I subtituted 1/4 tsp. of dried thyme for the 1 Tblsp. of fresh thyme. I also subtituted 1 Tblsp. of finely minced onion for the shallots. The sugar snap peas had a nice flavor. I think I would prefer a more mild or lightly sweet flavoring, but they are good anyway.

I fixed these for dinner tonight.  I LOVED them!!  The recipe was easy and quick.  I didn't have any shallots, so I sprinkled some onion powder on the peas and it worked out great.

Thank You for sharing this recipe!!

What a great way to fix snap peas!  I roast almost any kind of veggie, but never thought to try it with this one.  This would be great to serve as a snack with drinks.

This is like the definition of quick, delicious and easy! Eat it with rice for a simple yet healthy and delicious meal that's cheap too :))

I used onions and dried thyme instead of shallots and fresh thyme, but it was still yummy! I would suggest a good couple shakes of salt.

Ye gods, these were wonderful.  Made exactly as directed - only difference was on spur of the moment we threw in some onion slices and baby carrots to roast along with peas.  After we'd eaten half (grin), hubby said "these would be good with a little grated parm regano on top".  We immediately dusted top with cheese and threw back in the oven for a quick warmup.  YUM!  Thanks so much for recipe!

That 7,606 people have saved this recipe should tell you everything you need to know.  I hate almost all veggies so I struggle to find a way to make them palatable.  This is it!  Substitutions that work? Dried thyme leaves, spray cooking oil, and other veggies such as a mix of bell peppers (all colors), snow peas, onions, tomatos, zucchini, baby carrots, etc.

To me this seemed just like regular peas in a pod. I thought it could use more seasoning and maybe some bell pepper. I'm really sorry but I just was not feeling it.

Pretty tasty. I only had a handful of sugar snap peas so I decreased to 2 servings. Served with "Chicken on a Stick," "Dill, Feta and Garlic Cream Cheese Spread" with Italian bread,  and "Country Green Beans." *UPDATE* Also served with Rosemary Braised Lamb Shanks, Cheesy Polenta, mashed potatoes, and broccoli with lemon, pine nuts, and butter.

I like sugar snap peas, and I like roasted vegetables, so I loved this quick and easy way of preparing them.  Tossed all the ingredients together in a bowl before spreading them on the baking sheet.  Would suggest roasting them about 10-12 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking time.

This is a great recipe. I used onion salt and garlic salt, chopped onions and olive oil. Followed other viewers advice and mixed all together and then put it in the oven. Will make this again.

This was good but not outstanding.  I used dried thyme and it tasted a bit powdery.  I will definitely use fresh if I try this recipe again.  Overall, it was an interesting and tasty blend of flavors. I think adding garlic would have made this a lot better.

For something so simple to prepare, these are wonderful. I used fresh peas, green onion, and dried thyme. Thanks so much!

I agree that this WAS very tasty.  However, I warn against using frozen snap peas!!!  I used them and the dish seemed overcooked (mushy, as my picky hubby put it).  I happen to like my veggies well cooked so I liked it alot.  Definitely use fresh and you'll really like it. Also I would use double the shallots next time.

Ok but I think I prefer them steamed or sauted. Good recipe to try for variety but I don't think I'll make them again like this.

This was a very easy and good recipie.  I had some sugar snap peas that I got in my organic veggie box that I had to use up.  This recipie was perfect.  I served them with pork chops and rice.

Excellent dish and super easy.  Will definitely make this again.  I did use snap peas but I am sure it would also be great with other veggies (asparagus, broccolini, edamame.)

This was so simple!  I thawed a frozen bag in water, semi-dried it, tossed them in a bowl with the other ingredients, and baked them on a cookie sheet for 8 minutes.  I'll do this again.  The shallots really make the flavor, so I wouldn't skip them.

Great tasting, easy, and doesn't make a mess!  I added some grape tomatoes to the recipe (whole grape tomatoes or cherry tomatoes are fine) to add a little more color to things.

This was tasty and easy.  I loved the blend of shallots, thyme, and salt.  I didn't have fresh thyme, but dried worked well.  The shallots carmelized into crunchy sweetness.  I have a convection oven, and 450 degrees would be too hot. I set my oven at 400, and used a spatula to flip them a little, about halfway through (3 to 4 minutes).  I'm lazy, so I bought fresh sugar snap peas that had been cleaned and washed.

As my husband said "very fresh tasting".  I did as other suggested and substituted onion and garlic powder for the shallots, and used dried thyme.  Cooked exactly as directed and the peas were the perfect texture.  I will definitely make these again!!

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  Easy to make and easy to modify.  As others suggested, I mixed everything in a bowl before spreading on a cookie sheet.  I subbed Italian seasoning that contained thyme for the fresh thyme.  Nice change from stir frying the snap peas.

Yummy! I loved this recipe. I did some slight adjustments to it (added minced garlic and omitted the thyme) but think it works well as written too. Only thing I found not quite as I expected was the time-it took about 15 minutes to get them as tender as I like my peas. Still, great recipe. Thanks!

I tried this recipe and didn't remember how long to leave in oven, took them out at 7 min...too soon, used chopped green onions.  We loved them and will definitely have them again, will probably add garlic. Tks for this recipe, a nice change.

I realized after I started making this recipe that I didn't have thyme... So a quick Google search said basil was something I could use instead. These had an awesome sizzling sound when they were cooking in the oven, and tasted great!

I omitted the shallots (we do not like them) and had to use dried thyme instead of fresh.  Because I was using dried, I used half the amount called for.  I really liked that these were oven roasted.  We thought they could use a little less thyme to allow more of the pea flavor to come through.  I will make these again, maybe try adding some garlic.

If I prepare this recipe again, I'd roast for only 4 minutes.  At 6 minutes, the peas had lost that sweet, crispiness I love so much.  The shallots and thyme were good... but I want my sugar snap peas sweet!

I picked up some fresh sugar snap peas and wanted to do more than simply steam them.  This recipe is delicious and super easy to do!  The only thing I changed, as others said, was use some garlic because I love garlic and didn't have shallots.  Will definitely make again!

My hubby brought home some delicious sugar snap peas from the farmer's market and, other than eat them raw, I didn't know what to do with them. This was delicious! I had to use a sprinkling of ground thyme instead of sprigs of fresh, so I can't wait to taste this recipe with fresh thyme. Thank you so much for posting!

This was surprisingly exceptional.  I say that because only a few simple ingredients made the flavors of this dish fabulous.  I used fresh shallots and thyme, which I would highly recommend, and had it in the oven at about 390 degrees.  I used a brush and dabbed brushed each snap pea with a little olive oil.  I frequently roast vegetables at 450 and didn't want those burt edges on the snap peas.  They cooked up nicely with a crunch.  This will definitely be a "go to" side dish.  Thank you for this keeper!

Excellent!  Made with  Asian Grilled Chicken and these stole the show!  Yummy!  Only sub I made was dried thyme instead of fresh but I'm sure the fresh would make this even better!  (the dried worked great since I didn't have fresh)  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I love sugar snap peas and loved the idea of roasting them with shallots, salt & thyme.  I used white onions because that is what I had.  I also minced a clove of garlic.  I mixed all with some olive oil in a bowl first as some other reviewers suggest.  They were really good, though I think I used a little too much oil, next time I will be more sparing but this is a terrific side for almost any meal.

Fabulous recipe! I have these growing in my garden, and had no idea what to do with them. Baking the snap peas really brings out the natural sweetness.

I used minced garlic, ground thyme and a few finely chopped green onions from the garden. I served them not so much as a side dish, but rather a finger food/snack. My family loved them.

YUM! I wish I'd had fresh snaps on hand so I could have removed the strings. That's such a pain with frozen ones like I had. I love the combination of flavors! I added some parsley, too. :)

Great!  I put the peas and cut up onion (white one, as it was all I had) and put on oil and spice and tossed.  Then put on a piece of foil on a baking sheet.  Yum! And easy!

Very tasty! I should have baked them a little bit longer, they were slightly too crunchy for me, but I will just remember that next time. (I probably took them out to soon anyways!)

The flavors in this dish are perfect! I did not feel like using my oven today, so I started out sauteeing the diced shallots in a tablespoon of smart balance spread with a chopped piece of leftover bacon I had around. When the shallots were lightly carmelized I added the snap peas and thyme(dried equivalent because I did not have fresh).  We put salt on when served, and it was amazing! Thanks for this recipe- will be making again very soon!

I was surprised at how quickly these cooked.  Used our toaster oven since our main oven had something baking in it.  They turned out really well and we ended up adding toasted almonds for a little extra flavor.  Served these with the Cherry Chicken Lettuce Wraps from this site.

Very good and simple recipe. I cooked for 6 minutes at 425 in a convection oven. I also mixed everthing together in a bowl like someone else said. The shallots are a great touch. My only comment is that I would use a little less olive oil next time.

Very Very Good!!! Used onion flakes because I didn't have shallots and also substituted fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Cooked for about 10 minutes at 450 so they were slightly browned on one side... but so delicious. My dad doesn't typically eat "different" vegetables and he ate half of the bowl! Will be making again and again!

I've starting roasting lots of vegetables, but not snap peas - so these were a treat. I liked this recipe - I left out the olive oil, just used a cooking spray to lightly coat the peas. The shallots and fresh thyme added a tasty flavour. A make again for sure,

Fantastic!  I made these with the Autumn Spice Ham steaks.  Cooked both in the oven at the same time.  I also, made mashed sweet potatoes with butter and the juice and zest of  a lemon...those didn't go over well though.

So good! I just made these tonight. I don't have shallots, so I used 1/2tsp of garlic. I cut back on the oil just a bit. And like others, I just tossed all the ingredients in a bowl and put them on the baking dish. The cooking time is perfect for still crisp peas. Thank you!

Nice dish! I wanted a light lunch using the multitude of sugar snap peas I had, and this did the trick. I didn't have shallots, so I cut up the bulbs of some green onions I had in the fridge. I also added some carrot sticks to the mix, which were quite tasty. The thyme/onion combo is fantastic!

I'd never thought of roasting snap peas!  I did use thyme, but had to sub garlic for the shallot.  8 minutes did the peas perfectly...a little browned, and was also just long enough to brown, but not burn, the garlic.  I think that tossing the oil and seasonings with the peas is a lot easier than trying to brush them evenly.

This is a wonderful, quick recipe! Like other reviewers, I added minced garlic and omitted the thyme. I used snow peas and stir-fried them instead of baking.  Everything turned out perfect.  I'll be making these again soon.

I used fresh sugar snap peas, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme and a bit of salt.  I stir-fried in olive oil instead of baked. Very nutricious and delicious.  I served mine with salmon patties on this site.  Will make again.

Forgot the thyme, added fresh garlic with shallots. still delicious, different from how I normally make these and so easy.  Also, forgot actualy recipe so I cooked them at 350 for about 15-20.  Also instead of brushing with oil, I tossed all ingredients into a bowl to coat and then spread on baking sheet.

very easy, simple, healthy and delicious. I have used it with snow peas and sugar snap peas and it works well with both of them. I sprinkle just a tiny bit of sugar on them just for that next level of yum, but not to be sweet, just a tiny bit. some stores sell stem less seeds, those are nice so you are not eating the stem and the string that attaches to it, too much work to take it all out and not very attractive at the dinner table when you have to spit it out

Just made it.  I didn't have a shallot or thyme, so I substituted with onion powder and garlic powder.  I sprinkled a little lemon after cooking.  They are crisp and have a nice flavor.

Very delicious and simple. To Andoras, the reason yours didn't come out delicious is because you didn't follow recipe and used FROZEN....

My teens were so so with this.  It was easy and good, but not delicious.  I changed servings to 6 and was glad I had.  My fresh Thyme was not the best, so that might have had something to do with the flavor.  I will try this again and switch up some things.

Great recipe! I didn't have shallots, so I used two cloves of garlic thinly sliced and a tablespoon or so of chopped onions. I tossed everything in a bowl and spread it out on a baking sheet. We've already made it a couple times and will definitely be making it again!

I made this as written, except I also had to sub in dried thyme for fresh. I don't know if I added too much or what, because the thyme flavor was overpowering, and far too "woodsy" tasting for us (tho we were able to eat it, it wasn't too pleasant). Perhaps it's too close to Rosemary, which neither of us can abide. I guess we've tolerated it before because I've generally used it in tomato sauces and such, but when I try this dish again (which I'm sure I will), I think I'll add half the amount of herbs, and sub Italian seasoning for the thyme, or maybe I'll just add garlic. It's hard to beat a good roasted spring vegetable with EVOO, salt and pepper.

This is a great way to prepare snap peas!  These went very well with a dinner that I prepared last evening!  In the past I've stir-fried the peas in a similar method, but this cleared the way for me to finish plating a dinner and still have the veggies warm!  Thanks, CJCOLLINS!

We had never had snap peas before and was not sure how to cook them.  When I found this recipe worked out well as we were also using the oven.  Even my husband loved them, I had made an addition to this by adding a spinkle of minced garlic.  We will have this again and again.  Thank you.

Nice, simple healthy way to prepare peapods.  Thanks for the recipe!  I had fresh, local peapods, and it was easy to pop them in the oven while grilling and preparing the rest of dinner.  I didn't have fresh thyme, but I look forward to adding it next time.  I cut back on the olive oil -- only brushed on as much as needed to cover.

I was sorry that I found this disappointing, as I had high hopes based on reviews.  It simply wasn't anything spectacular and the kids didn't care for them at all, and they like veggies pretty much as well as anybody.  Perhaps because I only had dried thyme?  Probably won't make again.

Quick, easy and really good. I was out of shallots, so I used some minced onions and garlic and it worked really well. My husband and kids both really liked it, and my son is kind of picky about veggies!

Simple and elegant!  I wasn't sure what to expect because it seemed so basic and I sure was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't have shallots on hand so used chopped sweet yellow onion and it worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good & super easy. I used finely diced onion & a clove of minced garlic in place of the shallot and about 1/4t dried sage (not the powder). I'm not really even a fan of snap peas, but will definitely make these again.

OMG.. surprised any of them made it to the plates. I took them from the oven and they were set next to me while I made the chicken, I couldn't help but snack on them!! I love sweet potatoes done this way too! 
Thanks for a great recipe!!

I'm not a fan of thyme, but this is a great recipe.  I love to use whatever I have on hand. Tonight I tried minced garlic and cayenne pepper.

These were ok, but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out a little bitter.  I'm not sure if I just didn't like the thyme or what it was.  I would try this recipe one more time before giving up but I would cook a few more minutes.  At 8 minutes they were still a little crisper than my liking.

Way better than I thought they would be. I don't like sugar snap peas so I was looking for a way to make them appealing to me, this totally worked. A former review said it's like eating candy, they were right! You can add different seasonings too, just as long as you stick to the oil and bake method it's great. But the thyme does something special. Awesome recipe!

The roasted shallots and tasty salt granules elevate an already sublime fresh food. Thanks for sharing!

Would definitely make this again.  Took twice as long to roast as instructions indicate.

This was awesome!  I added red onion instead of shallots because that is what I had on hand.  I also added a little left over asparagus that I had...thank you for sharing this recipe.  Exactly what I was looking for.

Very nice use of sugar snap peas.  I did not use thyme.  I substituted the shallots for garlic.  Will make again.

These were really good.  I didn't have shallots, so I substituted with garlic.  I also left out the thyme (personal preference).  They were starting to brown on the bottom, yet still crisp after 8 minutes in the oven.  Really good!

These were just ok, I think I would have liked them better without the thyme and just some kosher salt and pepper.  I did like the cooking method though - quick and easy!
