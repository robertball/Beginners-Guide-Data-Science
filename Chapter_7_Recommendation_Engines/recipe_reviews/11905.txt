I have been making this recipe for years!  I have not found a person yet who doesn't like it.  DO NOT CHANGE A THING!  (Except seasoning it to your liking, i.e., garlic powder, oregano, italian seasoning...)  This is not your typical "spaghetti casserole" and it's not meant to be.  If you want regular spaghetti then make regular spaghetti. It kills me when people alter everything about the recipe in their reviews.  Then it becomes something totally different. Do not substitute the tomatoes for ready-made sauce.  You'll lose the whole idea of the recipe!  Yes, cream of mushroom soup!  It will not be the same with out it.  It kind of acts as a sealer to keep the noodles from drying out.  Great with garlic bread and even better the next day!

Due to others' reviews, i made some significant additions to the recipe, and it turned out great!  With alterations as follows, everyone raved about the dish:  I upped the green pepper (used a whole large pepper), used two cans of italian diced tomatoes, added one 8 oz can tomato sauce, almost doubled the mushrooms by using over 1/2 a lb of fresh, added 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper; I reduced the cheddar to one cup and added two cups of mozzarella, mixing them together; to the bottom layer of pasta I mixed in 1 jumbo raw egg, 1/2 cup parmasan cheese, and salt and pepper (to form a better "crust"); I had to up the water in the soup a bit (maybe to 1/3-1/2 c) and sprinkled basil, s & p over all.  With these complicated sounding but really easy alterations, it was awesome!  Served with crusty french bread, cesear salad, and the chocolate pudding pie off this site (see reviews).

Very yummy recipe, but needed some help.  Here are the changes I made:  Used jarred sauce, mozzarella instead of cheddar and added sliced italian sausage (this was the best addition!).  The cream of mushroom soup was a surprise but it really enhanced the flavor.  Using the jarred sauce saved a lot of prep time and made this a relatively quick meal.

Pretty good.  I added garlic and salt to the meat.  Next time I will not layer the food.  I will mix everything together and slap it in the pan, top with parmesan then cook. Got too many spoonfuls of plain noodles.  Hope these suggestion help.

I wanted a new recipe that I could make for a potluck at work and use my crockpot as well.  This one was great.  I added 1 cup of spaghetti sauce to the meat, and precooked my noodles.  I followed the recipe and layered it into my crockpot and let it cook all morning.  By lunch time it was ready and by the end of lunch, there was none left.  This was a great recipe and I will definalty use it again.

My family loved this recipe. I did what others suggested and went very heavy on the seasonings.  Next time I will use more cheese and more cream of mushroom soup then the recipe calls for.  The soup makes the spaghetti have a nice cream sauce to it.  I just wanted it to have more sauce.  I will make this one again soon!!

This was really good! I didn't have a lot of the ingredients so I had to substitue or leave out, but the idea was the same. I used spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes, left out the canned mushrooms, and instead of Cheddar Cheese, I had a shredded Italian mixture on hand (Asiago, Mozzarella, etc.). The family loved it, even my 5 yr. old who claims she doesn't like spaghetti!

This was great! We used a spicy pasta sauce instead of the tomatoes, and added two cloves of garlic, plus salt. A great recipe, and very easy to make. No complaints, it's wonderful, thanks for the recipe! We'll definitely be using it again soon!

Time consuming dish. I added extra mushrooms for more taste - still, not a memorable meal. A weekday family meal, but definitely not company fare.

We love this!!!  Add a couple of cloves of garlic but otherwise awesome!  Freezes great.  My standard for potlucks.  I sometimes use wheat pasta, the healthy request soup etc.  Still awesome!  It's not traditional spaghetti, but that's the point.  Try it this way and you won't regret it

This. Is. Delicious.  - I used whole grain pasta, 98% fat free cream of mushroom, and 1/3 cup of milk (instead of the water)...  those are the only modifications I made.   So good.... I thought it would be dry, but it wasn't!  Yum. Yum. YUM!

I know this received so many great reviews, but oh my goodness was this a strange meal! The spaghetti, cheese, meat, garlic and onion was great...it got weird when the cream of mushroom soup was added to the equation. I could not get past tasting canned soup on top of my meal!!! It was a great concept (or so I thought) but very disappointing meal.

i use a shortcut and a bit of a change on this recipe....i use already made sauce, store bought is fine, add my mushrooms, black olives and sauteed onions...taste just as good and no mess. i also layer the soup instead of adding it all on top, makes it much more creamier. everytime i make it, everyone comes back for seconds and the recipe!! try it!!

I made this with ziti instead because it's easier for the kids to eat.  I also cooked the meat separately and then drained the fat off.  I had some fresh mushrooms in the fridge so I used them instead, cooking them towards the end of sauteing the other vegetables so they wouldn't turn black and mushy. Didn't have mild cheddar so used sharp instead.  Tasted great and everyone absolutely LOVED it!  Planning on making this on a weekly basis. Great reheated the next day for the kids' lunch.

This has been a favorite in our family for years! I did find a way to cheat and get a similar flavor easier - i use canned spaghetti sauce with mushroom and green pepper (Ragu is our fave), and I mix the cream of mushroom soup in with the beef/sauce mixture. Mix the cooked spaghetti in, and layer spaghetti, cheese, spaghetti cheese. That's just for nights when I'm in a hurry - otherwise, I'd follow the recipe for 'the real McCoy'. Every time I've served this it's gotten rave reviews.

I have made this twice. The 2nd time I didn't alter the basic recipe but I did add chopped celery & chopped red peppers with the onions & green pepper, also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. The 2nd time I used mozerella instead of cheddar. I prefer the ingredients in the 2nd time I made this. Generally speaking this is a very excellent recipe & is even tastier the next day .... heats up very nicely. I also agree to not leave out the cream of mushroom soup it really would make a difference not using it. I thought I'd mention this .. the last time I made this recipe I put 1/2 of it in a casserole dish & froze it. I partially thawed it in the microwave then put it in the oven til it was done. It was delicious & my verdict is that it freezes well.

VERY good!! Only thing that I did different was added some more spices to taste like garlic powder and onion powder. The meat/sauce mixture definitely needed some salt added to it, but that was to taste as well. I added fresh garlic among the vegetables and I added shredded mozzarella after the cheddar also. Overall the dish was very very good.

this was pretty yummy. I also made some minor tweeks-- I added fresh basil and parsley, minced garlic all to the meat mixture. I also used the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup. I layered the meat, noodles and cheese in a big mixing bowl then poured the soup and mixed it all together- liked it better this way, because you get a taste for everything in every bite! enjoy!

HUSBAND LOVED IT!!! I did a few modifications---

1 tablespoon dried parsley--- 
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese---
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder---  
2 cloves garlic, minced--- 
1/2 teaspoon salt--- 
1 tablespoon white sugar--- 
1 bay leaf--- 
3/4 teaspoon dried basil--- 
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper--- 

Oh ya, my husband came home starving so I didn't even bother baking it.

***UPDATE*** Second time around, I actually baked it and it was wonderful.

I followed the recipe exactly. I think it's delicious as is. It has a creamy consistency and is not like a typical tomato sauce based spaghetti.  This recipe has a mild, cheesy flavor like a creamy white sauce. I used a whole dry oregano. If I make the recipe again, I will definitely crush the oregano first or grind it a little in an electric coffee grinder. I think many people would enjoy this as a change from the ordinary tomato based sauce recipes.  This also makes quite a lot so it would be ideal for taking to a potluck. I will definitely make this again. The recipe was easy to follow, does not require any unusual ingredients, is inexpensive to make, and turns out great.

Even though I had my doubts - we absolutely loved this!  I only altered the recipe slightly...I didn't add 12 oz of pasta - I used about 10 oz or so.  I increased the cheese to about 2.5 cups (1 cup mozzarella and 1.5 cups medium cheddar).  I decreased the amount of green pepper to about 1/2 cup and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned (about 1/2 lb, but could have used more).  This makes a massive amount...so DH and I will be eating this for lunch for quite awhile!
**EDIT** I just wanted to add that this dish also freezes very well if you have leftovers!

This was good but would've been better had I not cut corners to save on calories.  Will tinker with my low fat version to increase flavor.

I was looking for something different to try with my leftover spaghetti noodles. I came across this one and decided to try this for a change. I cooked the onions, added one green bell pepper, i garlic clove, diced, fresh mushrooms, not canned. I also had some fresh roasted roma tomatoes which I added in place of the canned diced tomatoes. Instead of water I replaced it with chicken stock and mixed it with the cream of mushroom soup. I layered the ingredients in the casserole dish per the submitter's directions and baked at 350 for 40 minutes until bubbly and cheese melted. Served this along with garlic bread, from this website.

I was a little nervous about using the cream of mushroom soup...but it turned out GREAT!!! I did change it up a bit I didn't have any mushrooms so I omitted those, I also added a can of tomato sauce ...I used milk with the soup instead of water and put pepperonis on top....I will definitely try it again

Cream of mushroom soup in Baked Spaghetti?  I don't think so.  Followed the recipe with the exception of the mushroom soup.  I used 1/4 c. mayo, 1/4 c. sour cream instead and mixed them in with the sauce, ground beef, parmesan cheese, green peppers, and onions, bringing everything to a simmer.  It made for a very creamy sauce.  Layered spaghetti, sauce, cheddar cheese, repeat.  Make sure you top with shredded cheddar cheese so it gets nice and brown after baking.  We are looking forward to the leftovers tonight!

Pretty good, though the noodles were more mushy/soggy after baking. I think between boiling them to cook and then putting it in the oven with the juices, made them a bit soggy.

My children (8,3,1) all made faces when I told them what we were having for dinner but all cleaned their plates AND had seconds... so did my husband.  Made it exactly as the recipe states, except instead of layering I mixed it all together (including cheese) and put it in the baking dish and topped it with the soup and Parmesan cheese.  Very yummy! Will definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe.  A few suggestions to make it taste more like spaghetti -- add 1 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tbsp. of dried or fresh basil, 3 cloves minced garlic.  This is a good comfort meal and should be well received by kids.

I have made this recipe for years.  It is my go to recipe for potlucks, or to take to a family that needs a meal.  I know the cream of mushroom soup sounds strange, but you don't really taste it, it just makes the casserole creamy. I always add some fresh garlic and use sharp cheddar for more flavor.  I always get people asking me for this recipe after tasting it!

This turned out to be a very happy accident for my husband and I. I started out planning to make chili this afternoon, but shortly after I had the ground beef, onions, peppers, and celery cooked up, I found out I didn't have any beans in the pantry, and I wasn't in the mood to run to the grocery store. So, I had to get to work to find something to use that meat mixture for and this was it. I looked at a couple of other Baked Spaghetti recipes, but I had ALL the ingredients for for this one and I loved the number of reviews it had received. Because I had read a few reviews stating that the recipe was bland, I decided to give the meat/tomato mixture a taste before starting the layering process. Score! It was perfect! My husband and I could hardly wait the 35 minutes while the casserole baked and melted all that yummy cheese. We were blown away at how good this was. Since it was just the two of us for dinner this evening, we will be enjoying it again tomorrow! :) I will make this again and again. I'm already planning to bring this the next time I need a nice big main dish casserole for Church or a family gathering. Thanks LaDonna, for this recipe, it's a real winner!!!

I made this dish twice. Once I tried to "healthy" it up a bit and substituted ground turkey for hamburger, low sodium diced tomatoes with herbs, lots of veggies and less cheese. It was an awesome healthy dish. I made it today using hamburger and went all out for the unhealthy version :) I really only made a few changes. I used milk and sour cream to thin out the soup ( i used 1 cream of chicken and 1 mushroom) I still used lots of veggies and low sodium tomatoes. This was sooooo amazingly good. I still have leftovers and can't wait to make it again. Both ways turned out great and remain pretty true to the original.  Easy assembling tip: pour all the noodles on the bottom. Pour the veggies and meat all over it. Pour the soup mixture over that. Simple and the flavor pours into every bite.

This was really good, a perfect dish for a cold night. I loved the cream of mushroom soup in this, I never would have thought of that. I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the meat while browning, which added great flavor. We really love chunks of tomatoes in spaghetti, so I threw in a can of stewed tomatoes along with the diced tomatoes. Doubled the mushrooms, used plenty of italian seasoning, and used mozzarella and cheddar. I made this a little differently because I was feeling lazy... after simmering the meat mixture and cooking the pasta I just threw it all together and mixed it well. Then I put about a 1/3 of it in a casserole dish, topped with a layer of cheese, and repeated twice. Topped w/ the soup and parmesan as written and it was just perfect. My fiancee DEVOURED this! Thank you :)

I followed this recipe almost exactly the way it was written.  The only variation I did was I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes.  Even my picky daughter ate this up.  I think this is an excellent recipe.

UPDATE: AFTER MANY YEARS OF AVOIDING ANYTHING THAT REMOTELY RESEMBLED THIS, I DECIDED EVERYONE (OR RECIPE) DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE. TO MY SURPRISE, I NOT ONLY ENJOYED THIS, BUT DIDN'T REMEMBER IT BEING AS "BAD" AS IT WAS THE FIRST TIME AROUND.... ADMITTEDLY, I FOLLOWED LADONNA'S DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER THIS TIME (I MIXED EVERYTHING TOGETHER ON MY FIRST ATTEMPT). WHILE NOT GOURMET, THIS WAS DECENT NONETHELESS. BECAUSE MY HUSBAND HATES CREAM OF A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G, I ADDED A THIRD LAYER OF CHEESE (TO COVER IT UP AS BEST I COULD). I KNEW THE SCANT AMOUNT OF PARM CALLED FOR WOULDN'T CUT IT. :) MY ONLY OTHER CHANGES WERE SUBBING ITALIAN SEASONING FOR OREGANO (HABIT) AND OMITTING THE MUSHROOMS ALTOGETHER (WE HATE MUSHROOMS). ADD A LOAF OF GARLIC BREAD AND YOU'LL HAVE DINNER ON THE TABLE IN NO TIME FLAT. GIVE THIS A TRY. IF NOT A CONVERT, YOU MIGHT JUST BECOME ONE! I didn't like this at all!!! I have to admit I was a bit skeptical to try this to begin with.... The thought of adding mushroom soup to spaghetti seemed odd and downright unappetizing. My mom always said "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all." I wish I could hold back - but I can't. :( Trust your gut. This is as awful as it sounds. Thanks anyways, LaDonna.

I made this dish for a potluck in class, and everyone was raving!  Thanks for the recipe!  I've been making this dish ever since I found it online, and it's definitely a keeper.  The only things I changed about the recipe were: Prego traditional sauce (the 10oz one), omitting tomatoes, and using a package of real white button mushrooms.  Very tasty!  Mmmm!

My husband and I made this recipe a while ago and totally loved it! We did change up the recipe to suit our tastes more as follows: no mushrooms, added an 8 oz block of cream cheese, omitted the cream of mushroom soup, added in 8 oz Ricotta cheese, and 8 oz cottage cheese. It was delicious! We layered the casserole like a lasagna - cottage cheese first, noodles, ricotta cheese, meat sauce, noodles, cream cheese, meat sauce, Parmesan cheese on top, bake until melty and bubbly. OUT OF THIS WORLD!

First time making a baked speghetti and it was delicious. What I did different: 1 heaping tsp chopped garlic and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I under cooked spaghetti serveral minutes so it wouldnt turn into mush in the over. I added the cream of mushroom soup to meat mixture then added the spaghetti and mixed well together. Once in casserole dish topped with mixture of provalone and mozzerella d/t didnt have any cheddar.

This is delicious! I made a few omissions (green peppers, mushrooms) just because we don't like them. I added a little garlic, used sharp cheddar, and used milk instead of water. No major changes. I understood the recipe used spaghetti noodles but it is not, and isn't supposed to be, "spaghetti". I forgot to put the second layer of cheese on before I put on the mushroom soup and parmesan cheese, so I just put in on top of everything and threw it in the oven. We loved it. Can't wait to try it again made correctly!

Pretty darn good! I did make a few changes due to other reviews and taste preference. When browning the hamburger I added about 2 tbs minced garlic. After adding the tomato (I used a 28 oz can) and mushrooms, I used about 2 tsp Italian seasoning, a few dashes of garlic salt, little bit of salt and pepper. I mixed everything together besides the soup and parm cheese that I put on top. 
People complained of it being bland. I think the garlic and extra spices really helped cause I didn't find the dish bland at all. I did use a half cup less cheddar cheese. The boyfriend and I liked it...will make again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was good...and easy. If you are looking for a nice safe dish that everyone would enjoy - this woudl be nice. Total personal preference -  I think it could have used a little kick/zip ... maybe a little garlic..not sure. But overall, we enjoyed it..I'll save the recipe and may make it again. I did use an extra can of mushrooms and tomatoes (personal taste) and ground turkey instead of beef. Hubby said he enjoyed the parm cheese!

I used this recipe mainly as a guideline.  Instead of meat, I used more vegetables (zucchini, yellow squash, carrots, fresh mushrooms) because I was serving a vegetarian.  I also used less cheese and sprinkled feta on top along with the Parmesan.  Overall, this dish may be a bit too much effort considering that I didn't just love it tons more than normal spaghetti, but it was very good.

This was a nice twist from our usual spaghetti dinner.  I took some advice from the other reviews and added more flavor by adding fresh garlic. I omitted the green pepper, tomatoes and mushrooms and used Classico Tomato & Basil. I used 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup Italian blend cheese and  I added some crushed red pepper flakes, whole leaf basil and marjoram.  I was hesitant about the cream of mushroom soup, but it turned out great.  Hubby and kids liked it so I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

This one is a keeper! Made garlic bread to go with it. The flavors are really good! I only added 1 can of tomato sauce to the meat, and 1 tsp of Italian seasonings. We all make our own little tweeks, but it doesn't change the fact that this is a great recipe! Thank you for sharing!

This turned out perfect! I followed the directions exactly except I added 1/4 cup milk to the Cream of Mush soup instead of water and used 1 c of shredded cheddar and 1 c of mozzorella.  I also used diced tomatos that were seasoned with basil, garlic, and oregeno.  The turkey meat I used was also mildley seasoned and everything came out incredible. Once I started layering I thought it was going to be a ton of food, and it was, but it was so tasty, my boyfriend and I both had seconds and ate it for lunch the next day.  Super yummy! Will definitely make again!

I did not layer it, rather mixed it all together with half the cheese in the mixture and added half the cheese on the top in the last 10-15 minutes.  I much preferred using Rotinni noodles as well.

This recipe was ok.  When I try a recipe for the first time I follow it exactly as written....and then make adjustments the next time.  This dish was good but needs way more sauce.  Instead of a small can of diced tomatoes, next time I'll add a large can of San Marzano diced tomatoes.  Skip the canned mushrooms and add fresh mushrooms (just saute them with the onions and peppers to release the liquid).  I used ground goat instead of ground beef because it is healthier and delicious.  I would also mix in some mozarella cheese next time....and perhaps leave out the cheddar altogether....I associate Cheddar with Mexican dishes....and this is Italian.....didn't like the taste.

I love cooking this meal.  It is soo simple yet it is always great.  I normally do both cheddar and pepper jack cheeses.  This gives it an extra kick.  I also change the pasta to corkscrew.  This makes it easiers to pick up with a fork.  Other than than.  This is by far, must most successful dish

In reading the other reviews I changed the ingredients as follows: 10oz spaghetti, 11/2cups of grn pepper, 8oz of fresh mushrooms, 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning (instead of oregano), 3 cups of cheese (2 cups of cheddar, 1 cup mozzarella. The recipe didn't state, but I did not drain the diced tomatoes. I cooked the fresh mushrooms during step two.  After the noodles were cooked I added 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 1 beaten egg and 1 teaspoon of steak seasoning and this gave the noodles a little favor kick. I thought this was tasty after a few modifications. Overall, this is a  versatile recipe where ingredients can be omitted or added according to personal taste.

This is a great dish!  I'm trying to lose weight (only 12 more lbs to go!!);  accordingly, I used ground turkey and reduced fat soup.  The result is that I was able to reduce the total calorie count down to 3125 and 99 grams of fat for the whole pan. (Only 260 cals and 8 grams of fat for a piece that's 1/12 th of the pan!!)  
The whole family thought it tasted wonderful, even with the lower fat modifications.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

This dish is excellent and is served at least monthly in our home by request.  The only thing I changed is mixing the soup in with the meat mixture instead of pouring it over the top.  It makes a smoother end product with a juicier all around taste.  Delicious!!!

Wonderful dish! It's easy to add your own ingredients according to your preference.  My five year old daughter loved it and it's a great way to "hide" the vegetables.  I added my favorite canned spaghetti sauce to the ground meat as well as the diced tomatoes with the onion and green peppers.  Followed advice of others and added more water to the soup and layered it.  Also added own Italian spices to help flavor it as some reviews claimed it was to bland.  Can't wait to try the leftovers.  Definitely will add to my favorite recipes!

Okay but I was dissapointed.  It was bland and did not taste anything like spaghetti, which my family loves. "Spaghetti" doesn't feel like spaghetti without its sauce...I don't think I'll make again.  Thanks anyways.

Very good.  Even my husband who is not a fan of hamburger liked it.  I was reluctant that the recipe didn't have a dash of salt or more spices so I added 1 tsp of salt and a dash of garlic powder.  That small amt of salt isn't going to make much of a different health-wise in such a large amount of food but it can sure help to bring out the flavor a little more.  I also like things soupy so I added 1/2 cup of V8 juice I had on hand  and added it to the meat just after I browned it.

This is a really good recipe!  I will make it again, but when I add the 
cream of mushroom soup, I will add more water, because it sat on the top instead
of filtering down to the spaghetti.  I would also either add more tomatoes or add some spaghetti sauce to give it more flavour.

This recipe was really good.  I gave it 4 stars only because I didn't make it exactly as written.  I don't eat red meat or use canned condensed cream soups, so I made it with ground turkey and homemade cream soup (butter, flour, milk, broth, onion, garlic, salt and pepper).  I omitted the mushrooms too (don't like them).  I think the homemade soup gave it better flavor...a number of people said it was bland.  I'm adding this to my regular recipes.  My daughters don't like red sauce, so it's nice to have a baked spaghetti recipe with a white sauce.

I have made this recipe, as is, at least a dozen times. No changes are needed.  My family loves it.  My husband does not like leftovers, but he will always ask if we have any left.  My father-in-law says he hates spaghetti.  In 24 years of marriage I have never seen him eat it, but I've heard him proclaim how much he dislikes it.  He stopped by one time while I was cooking this.  He thought it looked good when I took it out of the oven.  He tried it and was surprised by how much he liked it.  That was at least 10 years ago, and he still talks about it!

Why does this work?   Who cares, it's delicious!   I wasn't feeling the combination even as I was making it, but it does come together for a tasty finish.  I followed the recipe exactly (I always pay homage to the originator the first time around).   I would probably change the pasta-to-meat ratio next time since I really wanted more meat in every forkful.   Italian sauce would be a nice addition.   It definitely needs a "rest" period after baking.   The 10 minutes noted is not long enough for the flavors to blend.   I kept it warm in the oven until the kids got home and it was much better after a couple of hours and even the next day.   Nice comfort food for the family.  Not a "company coming over" kind of dish.

Having never made baked spaghetti, I was just looking for a base recipe I could adjust according to what I had in my currently limited pantry, and this delivered. I halved it, used fettuccine noodles and none of the soup or ground beef, and just threw a ton of spices in with the tomatoes and such while they were on the stove. It especially worked great because I put it in a loaf pan in the toaster oven while I was making a cheddar-onion soda bread I also got from allrecipes =]

Delicious! The only substitution i made was Cream of Chicken soup for the Mushroom soup. - the flavour was so distributed throughout the dish that I don't think this was a crucial substitution.  I love the addition of canned tomatoes to this recipe.

This turned out very good.  Reheated it was delicious too.  We had it for dinner several days, as there are only two of us, and it make a large 9x13" dish.  Will definitely make again.  If you are in a hurry, you could substitute a jar of spaghetti sauce for the sauce here and have a nice dish quickly.  I didn't think the mushroom soup mixture on the top was really necessary after making it.  I think you could just top the dish with some cheese if you didn't want the extra soup topping.

My husband who is not a pasta fan and does not like recipes with alot of cheese, really liked this dish (surprise).  I followed the recipe exactly as printed except I left out the mushrooms (don't like them).  Will certainly make this recipe again....and soon.

This is a great easy dish that can feed a lot.  I used the pasta sauce like someone suggested which saved time.  Used fresh mushrooms instead because I don't like the texture of taste of canned.  Found spaghetti noodles in the store that have been cut into pieces or you could break them yourself.  It made it easier to serve.

The only thing I changed was adding a bit of garlic. It wasn't enough. I know we are to rate the recipe for how it is written, not with a million changes. Therefore it's definitely not for me. There wasn't enough flavor; we actually thought it was very bland. I won't make it again, sorry....

I made with wheat pasta and turkey sausage and ground turkey and it added more flavor than regular ground beef I think.  Also used fresh mushrooms and only half a can of crm of mushrm soup with half a jar of mushrm Alfredo sauce.  Also added some Italian blend cheese as I didn't have a lot of cheddar.  It came out really delish with these slight changes.

I made this and followed the recipe.  I'm sorry, but I don't think it was that great and my family agreed (they're not picky eaters).  We usually LOVE recipes on this site that are 4+ stars, so we were disappointed with this one.  It was kind of dry.  There are better spaghetti bake recipes.

Loved this!  I used italian seasoned tomatoes and mozzarella (just 1 cup) because that's what I had on hand.  Also omitted the beef because I didn't have any but really wanted to try this recipe!  I cooked the onions and peppers with 3 cloves garlic, 1 t oregano, 1 t italian seasoning, 1 t garlic powder, a shake of red pepper flakes and then added the tomatoes - after simmering I mixed this in with the spaghetti and then proceeded with the layers.  I split the soup mixture between the two layers - next time I think I will use 2 cans of soup and two cans of tomatoes.  Thanks!

WINNER! This was AWESOME! We had to force ourselves to stop eating, so there would be some left for tomorrow! I made exactly as directed, except added garlic salt, basil, and marjoram to the meat mixture...AMAZING! Best new recipe I've tried in quite some time! THANK YOU!

Because I didn't have any mushrooms, green peppers, or diced tomatoe, I used Bertolli's spaghetti sauce with mushrooms.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  This was so good!!!  I will definitely make this again.

Some in my family dislike the earthy taste of mushrooms so I lefft out the cream of mushroom and canned mushrooms.I added sauteed onions  and used cream of chicken. I also left out the peppers and tomatos and used a store bought sauce with garlic and basil in it. It turned out a little different-but still good. If you like mushrooms  though don't change soup flavors.

I have been making this dish for years for the family and for company and everyone loves it. It doesn't take long to make either. The only changes I make are to remove the mushrooms and to use cream of chicken soup; sometimes I double to diced tomatoes.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated except for I used canned diced tomatoes with jalapenos. I also used whole wheat pasta. I thought this recipe was  a good everyday supper recipe... not really something I would make for company... I was worried maybe the noodles would would get dried out but they turned out just fine.

DELICIOUS!  This recipe is so versatile & forgiving, perfect for an ok cook like me!  I have made this several times & it has replaced lasagna as a family fave!  Used a variety of gluten free pastas, even mixed up partial bags left in the pantry, half the onion, no meat (vegetarian son), 16oz can of garlic basil chopped tomatoes.  Have made this with & without mushrooms, used about 1/2 cup frozen mushrooms thawed & chopped, used homemade gluten free cream of mushroom soup.  I have used homemade cream of veggie or chicken soup when out of shrooms (don't tell vegetarian son!).  Used different combos of mozz cheese, Mexican style shredded cheese, & sometimes some pepper jack cheese, depending on what I have on hand.  Its hard to mess this recipe up!

I have never been a spaghetti fan - but my husband is - so I though I'd make this and freeze portions for his work lunches. We also had it for dinner - I LOVED IT!! Oh yes - I did make a few additions from other reviews. I added extra beef - a can of diced tom. with gr. chilies - Italian seasoning - crushed red pepper - cayenne pepper and salt to taste.  I also did 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup motz. along with fresh mushrooms (had some that needed to be used). As for layering - I put the meat sauce on the bottom - spaghetti - 1/2 the cheese - more meat sauce and topped with some Parmesan and the rest of the cheese. FABOULOUS - and I'm not a casserole kinda gal!

This recipe has been in my family a long time.  My dad has always hated "casseroles" - this is one of his favourite dishes.  My opinion is, this is one recipe that you don't fiddle with the ingredients.  If its too dry, you've probably used too much spaghetti (I've done it myself).  I'm rating this 5 star because it has been made for so many people over the years and its been a hit every time.  The cream of mushroom soup might sound weird to some, but it blends in and you shouldn't be tasting soup.

No- I wouldn't have guessed that Cream of Mushroom soup would be good in this- but it is-honest! What I love best about this recipe is that it makes a lot (and now that my son has hit a growth spurt again, I am looking for recipes with volume to feed us!) Great recipe- give it a try!

Good recipe. But I HAD to change a couple things. I had my heart set on this but no noodles: used Wild Rice instead. Layered it on bottom. put meat mixture over (excluding tomatoes using tomato sauce instead)...otherwise the same and delicious!!!

Years ago, my mom got this recipe out of the Taste of Home Magazine.  The only difference is that the original recipe also adds a small can of sliced olives, 2 tsps of oregano instead on 1 tsp and uses a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I can take or leave the olives and extra oregano, but I think it needs the larger can of tomatoes.  I probably add more cheddar cheese than it calls for because I never actually measure the cheese.  Plus don’t forget to drain the grease from the ground beef mixture before adding the tomatoes.   We make this often as it is a family favorite and it is great for taking to pot lucks.

This recipe tastes great!  The cream of mushroom soup sounded really non-Italian but it actually keeps the layers moist and the mushrooms compliment it nicely.  I used 2 (16oz) cans of Italian-style diced tomatoes; 1 t. Italian seasoning instead of just oregano; added 1 egg, 1/2 c. milk, and some Parmesan to the noodles to help hold them together a little.  You don't want a whole lot of tomato sauce with this recipe since the diced tomatoes take care of that.  I also didn't have any mushrooms on hand which my kids appreciated.  My family loved this casserole!

Pretty good but not great. I followed the base recipe and also the top review's suggestions. If i made it again I would not add green pepper, it didn't seem to go well in spaghetti sauce.

YUMMMMM!!!!!! I am so glad that I found this recipie. This is one of the few meals I have prepared that my 6 year old has asked for more!!!! 
I made a few changes. I used italian turkey meat and organic veagtables. I also put a full cup of milk instead of 1/4th and I put it on the bottom layer as well. I also used a whole onion!!!
IT WAS SO AWESOME...

My husbands favorite spaghetti.  We use the large garden vegetable canned spaghetti sauce instead of the chopped mushrooms and tomatoes and add a small can of tomato sauce... its so yummy we rarely have left overs.

We really liked this. The only thing was that it is pasta heavy. Next time I will either double the meat mixture and use 16 oz. of pasta or make as recipe says with only 8 oz. And I only had 14.5 oz of diced tomatoes not 16 oz can. Is there such a thing? Dont let the soup scare you. It adds a great flavor and creaminess. There isn't any tomato sauce in this recipe so it is really needed. My husband was pleasantly surprised with this and I will make it again.

Very good! I just mixed everything in a big bowl before placing in a baking dish. It was much easier than layering everything. Everyone was pleased with how this turned out.

Everyone begged for more. 

I added 2 TBSP chopped olives, a dash of red peppers, 1 tsp. garlic, salt & pepper to the ground beef mixture as it was cooking. And a dribble of water 15 mins. before it was done.

We will have this quite often. Yum, yum!

My familky liked this recipe but I did add some spices to meat mixture as I found it too bland otherwise.  The addition of 1/2 can tomato soup, good dash tobasco sauce, basil, salt, sugar, bay leaf and dash of crushed chilies helped boost up the flavor.  Leftovers reheat well too!

I followed this recipe to a T.  It was definitely lacking something - creating the need for modification or additions.  As is, this recipe is incredibly dry, and tasteless.  If you're looking for a recipe that really makes those taste buds water, look elsewhere!  I will know to look for recipes that have more of a sauce-base.  This was not good, and my family was equally disappointed.

I made this for my wife when she came home from work. During the meal she must have commented four times about how good this was.  She said it was the best spaghetti she had ever eatten.  I agree with her that it was outstanding. It's the best meal that I have fixed yet. I did change several things that were suggested by other reviewers. I added an extra can of mushroom soup for the first layer. I used spaghetti sauce in jar from the grocery and I did add a little extra spaghetti than the 12 oz called for. I highly recomend.

My family absolutely loves this!! I use italian sausage instead of ground beef which gives it more flavor. I omit the bell peppers & use either monterey jack cheese or medium-sharp cheddar.
This dish cuts like a casserole.

I found this recipe to be extremely easy. It is rather bland for my tastes, but suits my wifes taste perfectly. I felt it could use more tomatoes and seasonings. The recipe calls for 16 oz. tomatoes, but I can only find 14.5 oz. cans in the store. I am sure that 1.5 oz. did not make that much difference though.

I made this dish a few nights ago and found it "very" easy.  The next time I make it, I'll add more
water to the mushroom soup as it was so thick, it sat on top of the dish and baked.
I'd like the mushroom taste to go further to the bottom of the dish.  Otherwise, it
is very hearty with a good taste!  Thanks LaDonna

I used elbow mac in place of spaghetti (I had some in the refrigerator already cooked up from a couple days prior, so figured it would work!), then I subbed delicious Johnsonville Italian sausage for the ground beef and added some garlic powder and minced garlic for a little flavor boost. Otherwise followed the recipe and oh my was this delicious and well received at my house! My son REALLY loved this - he ate a HUGE plateful! He cracked me up - he said "Mom, I don't know what meat this is, but I need more of it"! The sausage really kicks the flavor up and makes this creamy casserole special and perfect for a weeknight dinner! Served this with some cheesy Italian pull bread and a Caesar salad for a perfect meal.

This was great.  But I changed a bunch of stuff.  I added sliced celery to the onion, bell pepper mix.  I added cooked, sliced spicy sausage at the diced tomato step.  I also added some pasta sauce just cuz it was open and in the fridge.  I also added two shredded carrots to the meat mixture.  I don't do mushrooms so changed mushroom soup to cream of chicken soup.  This recipe needs spicing up but that's easy.  I'll def do this again.

My family completely loved it. I made a huge batch because my family are big eaters and I ended up with a lot of left overs. The servings of this dish were plenty big enough and it was so filling even my husband and my father only ate one. No one even complained of it as left-overs. Definatly making this again.

The recipe was easy to follow and tasted great. The only thing missing was the garlic, as associated with most Italian dishes. I added 2 teaspoons of garlic powder and believed it inhanced the taste.

Excellent recipe.  Even better when you start to get tired of the traditional tomato based spaghetti sauce.  The only thing different that I did was I used an orange pepper and green pepper instead of all green.  I doubled up on the gravy, then divided the gravy.  Using the suggestion of another, I mixed all the ingredients together (except the cheese).  I put first layer down, added cheese, then put the second layer down, and layered cheese on top of that.  Everything tasted wonderful, not bland at all.  Will be making again and again.

I used it as a basis for dinner one snowy night last week.  Didn't have diced tomatoes so used some homemade gravy I had instead.  Used up all the different cheeses as well.  This is my idea of a good recipe because it gives you a basic guideline and allows you to create.  Had to hide a piece for the next days lunch.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good recipe! It just needed some extra "zing" but that was fine because we seasoned it to our taste. Fun and easy to make, leftovers are even better! Husband doesn't usually say much but he said he liked this one! yay!

Awesome!  Really easy, too.  I made a couple small changes that I think may have upped the flavor a bit- used Italian seasoned ground turkey instead of ground beef, and used Basil, Garlic, and Oregano flavored diced tomatoes.  Also used a frozen pepper/onion combination and it turned out great!

Excellent!  My kids gobbled this up!  The only thing I changed was adding a small can of tomato sauce and also added a little Italian seasoning.  Was wonderful and will most certainly make again.

This was a great recipe, fast and easy. I substituted pablano peppers in place of the green peppers. This added spice and a kick.  If I make it again I will use 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup.  It was really Yummy, thanks!

10-25-11: I thought this was pretty good, but Ann reacted against the fattier than expected ground beef (85% lean).

I like easy dishes for lazy Sunday suppers.  This one fit the bill and was delicious.  I used a jar of spaghetti sauce to make it even easier and eliminated the onion, peppers, mushrooms, and oregano.  A keeper for the upcoming winter comfort food season!

This Baked Spaghetti was delicious.  My husband loved it. He even heated some up for breakfast the next morning! I must say that I was a little skeptical about the mushroom soup but it turned out to be a fabulous addition to spaghetti.  I love spaghetti sauce but sometimes find it a bit strong/acidic so by adding the mushroom soup it made the sauce creamier and gave it a really nice flavor. This recipe is a keeper.

I LOVED this. And ok, so I'm one of those reviewers who did change it a little, but everyone has different tastes right, so that's only logical. It's still a fantastic starting point! I did add sauce in addition to the can of tomatoes because I like a saucy pasta. I used diced tomatoes with onions and pepper in it, ground turkey seasoned with garlic, oregano, and rosemary, and half an onion. I omitted the can of mushrooms since my daughter isn't a big fan, I fig'd the soup would be plenty (and it was!!). I also used a very mixed blend of shredded cheeses, which I put thin layers every other layer. This was sooooo good, and I really don't think I made that many changes.

Overall good recipe.  I did add season all to the meat before cooking.  What I think I will do next time is:  Add Garlic seasoning, Use Tomato Sauce, Mustard, and drain the meat after cooking.  It was a little greasy without draining the fat.  

Enjoy!

Loved the creaminess the mushroom soup gave it. Took all the comments into consideration and I stirred it up (instead of layering) and used sliced sausage with mozzarella. Yummy!

It was good a little bland but that could have been because I used low fat mushroom soup. I did add bread crumbs to the top for a little texture and I will be making it again but probably using marinara sauce instead of tomatoe sauce for a little kick.

Really amazing.  I didn't add the green bell pepper as I didn't have any, substituted 1 pound ground Italian sausage for the ground beef, and used the diced tomatoes with Italian spices instead of just the regular diced tomatoes.  So easy, and the leftovers are just as good the next day or two, if there are any!

I can't really rate this one for taste because I didn't eat it (made it for a family that recently lost their father/husband).  However, it was easy and a nice twist on regular baked spaghetti.  I mixed jarred spaghetti sauce with the pasta because I was afraid it would dry out.

I tried this recipe for dinner for my family and everyone loved it.  I modified it only to use what I had on hand and avoid a trip to the store.  I used Italian seasoned ground turkey, and I mixed mozzarella with sharp cheddar cheese.  I also added 1/2 cup water to the cream of mushroom soup instead of 1/4 cup along with black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.

Great taste!  I used turkey ground, so needed more seasoning perhaps for that reason.  I noticed the noodles on the bottom got dry though, so I think next time I'd mix everything together instead of layering, like someone else suggested.

Very good, didn't have a green pepper so used a jar of roasted red pepper. Also added more seasonings: pepper, cayenne pepper, basil and garlic. Great make ahead meal. Next time I make this I may add a bit more water (or sub milk) to the cream of mushroom. Overall excellent recipe!

I will make this again.  My family like this and it was so easy and fast to make....perfect for a weeknight meal.  I kept the same except I used Italian sausage and fresh mushrooms(can't stand canned mushrooms) and used italian stewed tomatos for more flave....the cream of mush really adds to this dish.

Made this tonight and thought it was just okay.  I sauteed onions with a bit of minced garlic, used fresh mushrooms, added 1/2 can milk to the mushroom soup, and used a 28 oz can of italian style diced tomatoes.  It wasn't dry at all, but we found it a bit bland.  I was debating about adding a bit of tomato paste to the meat mixture, and I think I will for next time.  Not bad if you are looking for a 'comfort food' kind of dinner.

We had this tonight and it was YUMMY!  Made the same changes as other reviewers: added sausage, thinned soup with milk and a little sour cream, added some tomato sauce to the meat mixture. Loved the twist provided by the soup.  This one is a keeper! Thanks LaDonna!

Those of you who used jarred sauce in this should not even rate it.  There is no spaghetti sauce in this recipe and you are completely changing it.  This is supposed to be a creamy white sauce with some tomato chunks in it, not a creamy spaghetti sauce.

The first time I made this there was not enough flavor.  The second time I added two cans of Red Gold Italian Diced Tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning, Mozzarella Cheese, shallots and 2 small cans of mushrooms, and cream of chicken soup mixed with 1/4 cup of milk (not water).  It turned out delish!

Excellent recipe as is. I'm not sure why people review a recipe if they make so many changes to what was provided. This was a great change to your typical spaghetti. My family loved it.

Fantastic dish!!!! I loved the flavors the mushrooms and mushroom soup brought to this spaghetti, although it is quite different from traditional spaghetti, it is delicious. All of the veggies used in this recipe also make it quite good for you. The only thing I changed was that I mixed all of the spaghetti and the meat sauce together and poured that into a baking dish. I also added about two tablespoons of the mushroom soup to the spaghetti and meat. I then poured the rest over the top of the dish.  Give this recipe a try, you'll be glad you did!!

I really liked this recipe.  My husband, who likes everything, didn't like it.  I made the recipe exactly as it said with the exception of using mozzarella instead of cheddar, but next time I will add tomatoe paste/sauce to the dish to give it some sort of sauce, as there isn't much in the dish.

My family loved this recipe.  I did not make any changes except for seasonings.  I added salt, pepper, garlic and some Italian seasonings to the tomatos.  I think the bad reviews were because there was not too much about seasoning in the recipe.  You are only going to get good results if you put in good things.  Also do not be worried about  the mushroom soup on top.  It worked right in.  All togother this was a very good dish!

This turned out really really REALLY good. I followed the recipe but added the following: two handful of bacon bits while I was browning the beef. It gave the dish an awesome additional kick. I also added some smoked paprika and italian seasoning. After the spaghetti were done and drained I buttered them and put all of them in the baking dish. I put about 1 - 1 1/2 cups of shredded mexican cheese on top of the spaghetti. I then added the meat mixture. I topped that with most of the cheddar cheese, then the soup mixture and then some more cheddar cheese. Awesome. My husband loved it as well.

The only thing I would change is more cheddar cheese, maybe in the top layer.  The parmesan didn't seem to add much flavor.  ...Okay, one more thing, but it was all me: Measure your spaghetti carefully... if you get too much, you lose the tomatoey flavor.

This was pretty tasty, but I took the advice of several other reviewers and changed the recipe.  What I did was instead of diced tomatoes, added a jar of spaghetti sauce.  Instead of canned mushrooms I used fresh.  I added garlic, as well as garlic powder, onion powder, extra oregano, basil, parsley and cayenne.  I didn't have spaghetti noodles so I used fettuccine.   Instead of one can of mushroom soup I used two.  It turned out very tasty, although it was a bit hard to serve!  I will definitely use this recipe as a base of rother things I may create!  Thanks!

I've been on a kick with easy/lazy meals since my 19mo old doesn't let me cook.  This turned out delish and lasted for days!  I didn't have spaghetti on had, so I used a spiral noodle, and added lots more parmesan and some pasta sause to the diced tomatoes.  Even got some sourdough dinner rolls for garlic bread.  Loved it each time for 3 days straight!

This was great.  I made it exactly as called for in the recipe with some very minor changes.  I used the diced tomatoes that have onion and garlic added to it, and I used whole wheat spaghetti.  There is nothing major I would change about this recipe.  When I make it again I will do it the same way.  It was loved by all the adults at the table.  The kids wouldn't eat it, but they won't eat anything.

This was a good recipe. I am rating it a 4 because I did add an extra can of diced tomatoes. I also used italian cheese mix instead of cheddar just because we aren't big fans of cheddar and it still was yummy. Overall though, the family liked it.

VERY GOOD!!! If you gave this a bad review, I think you did something wrong. I used spaghetti sauce and the mushroom soup (and I don't even like mushrooms) and it was soo good. Creamy and delicious. Do not leave the soup out. Oh, I added garlic too.

OMG!! This is sooo good! I used a whole white onion & a large green bell pepper, it was a little bit more than a cup each. Also, the tomatoes I got were the Italian seasoned ones so I didnt add any extra seasonings. The parmesean cheese I used was out of the shaker can. Super easy and wonderful!

Family didn't praise this dish much--but they didn't complain about it. Following exact recipe instructions, the oregano / Italian seasoning flavors came out, but I had a sauce quantity issue;doubling the tomatoes my next try fix things-and promote this rated dish to 4 stars.

Yummmy!  Loved it!  I followed the recipe with these modifications based on previous reviews:  whole wheat spaghetti, ground turkey, 3/4 onion, seasoned the meat with some garlic, garlic powder, and black pepper.  Added 10 oz of spaghetti sauce and used 1 cup of cheddar cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese.  I mixed everything together except 2/3 of the cheese and poured it in the casserole dish then topped it with the remaining cheese and sprinkled with parsley.  Delish!

This recipe was easy to make and with a few additions it would be wonderful. I took advice from another reviewer and mixed all of the ingredients together, poured into 9X13 and topped with cheeses. The cream of mushroom soup makes it really creamy,but as others commented I did find it to be a little bland. Next time I will add salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic, oregano and a few red pepper flakes. It is definitely worth making again!

Not too bad.  I loved how soft the noodles came out and everything just melded together wonderfully.  The cream of mushroom was a great addition but I felt like it was missing something.  A little lacking in flavour.

this was good, but lacked flavor. Next time, I will make a tomato sauce seperately adding as follows: minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt and pepper and mushrooms.  AND to give the mushrooms a little kick, I will sautee them in butter and minced garlic first.  Great idea with the original recipe though!

Follow these changes from another reviewr and it's a 5:
Due to others' reviews, i made some significant additions to the recipe, and it turned out great! With alterations as follows, everyone raved about the dish: I upped the green pepper (used a whole large pepper), used two cans of italian diced tomatoes, added one 8 oz can tomato sauce, almost doubled the mushrooms by using over 1/2 a lb of fresh, added 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper; I reduced the cheddar to one cup and added two cups of mozzarella, mixing them together; to the bottom layer of pasta I mixed in 1 jumbo raw egg, 1/2 cup parmasan cheese, and salt and pepper (to form a better "crust"); I had to up the water in the soup a bit (maybe to 1/3-1/2 c) and sprinkled basil, s & p over all. With these complicated sounding but really easy alterations, it was awesome! Served with crusty french bread, cesear salad, and the chocolate pudding pie off this site (see reviews).

A little plain: needs more seasoning. I followed what the directions said except used garlic tomatoes and garlic mushroom soup.
I'm a beginner and found this an easy recipe, but messy!

This recipe was a lot of fun to make. I made it for my own family of four, plus my extended family of six. My 13-year-old cousin loved it and went back for seconds. My grandfather ate his own, some of my cousins, and he went back for seconds! (That's a great sign because he doesn't eat much in general) I added a lot of the changes recommended by other reviewers such as using fresh mushrooms (canned ones are yucky), adding Italian seasoning, etc. It came out flavorful and the preparation was completely stress-free. I only gave it 4/5 because it needs some ingredients added and should be made with as many FRESH ingredients as possible for the best results.

This is wonderful. I omited the green peppers and used stewed tomatoes and chopped them up b/c that's all I had. I loved it b/c I really dont like spaghetti sauce! I will keep this in my rotation now!

I was not to crazy about the mushroom topping, and neither was anyone else that ate it. However, under that it was pretty tasty. After reading the reviews I doubled the tomatoes, added one 8 oz jar of tomato paste, 2 cups of mozzarella and only one cup of cheddar. Overall, half the group liked it and the other half did not care for it

I tried to make it healthy by using whole wheat noodles and low fat cheese and soup.  It turned out really good!  I also added a few extra spices - Italian seasoning, cayanne pepper, and red pepper flakes.

Absolutely wonderful change from the regular spaghetti we usually eat. The entire family loved it. My husband was sad when the left overs were gone and asked to make it again soon. I didn't change anything. Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was very easy to put together with all the ingredients in my pantry. It was very good, cheesy and creamy. You really can't taste the cream of mushroom, leave it in to keep it from drying out. A keeper for make ahead weeknight meals.

This earned rave reviews from all.  I left out the ground beef and the peppers, per our tastes, and also added a larger can of mushrooms.  It was delicious and went together easily. I'll definitely be making this one again!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I was worried about it being too dry, so I added more water to the soup than the recipe called for and that seemed perfect. Even the leftovers we not too dry. This will be great to experiment with ingredients on hand.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit with husband and kids (4 & 1). I have made it as written as well as making changes/additions for what I have on hand (red pepper, garlic, basil). It's an easy recipe to change for personal taste and I usually have the ingredients (no extra grocery shopping). I would not omit the mushroom soup as it adds a nice creaminess. The tomato mixture does not drown the pasta which is our preference and the leftovers are good. An easy weekday recipe which I make on a regular basis.

I thought it was good. I thought it would be horrible because there is basically no spices in this recipe, but it really wasn't too bad. Good for a quick weeknight meal.

my family gave this recipe 3 stars, i would have given it 4 but sorry, majority rules.  this recipe sounded so interesting i just HAD to try it.  it was quite simple to prepare and the end result was nice but it really could stood to  have more flavor.  i'll probably make it again as i love the cream of mushroom element.  i think next time i make it i'll use at least 1/2 lb. more meat, add some minced garlic and garlic salt & pepper when browning the meat onions and peppers and add another can of cream of mushroom soup to the top the first layer.  thank you for sharing this recipe!  NOTE:  if your pan fills to the top - it WILL drip out so put a larger pan or cookie sheet lined with foil under it.

This is a wonderfully rich recipe.  I did not have all the ingredients so I improvised a little and made a couple of changes.  I did not have sour cream available so for the filling layer I used 1 8 oz block of cream cheese, a spoonful of whipped cream cheese, 1/4 cup evaporated milk and 1/4 cup Ranch Dressing.  I mixed this all together and added about 1/4 cup shredded mozzerella cheese.  I didn't have chedder cheese for the top so I shredded 2 cups of mozzerella and about 1/4 cup colby cheeses.  I also changed one other thing after reading the reviews about it being dry.  I used 2 full cans of spaghetti sauce and added 2 tablespoons sugar to the sauce (It ends the "canny" flavor.  I poured 2 ladle fulls of sauce onto the bottom of my 9x13 pan, added 1/2 of the spaghetti, 2 more ladle fulls of sauce, the rest of the spaghetti (I used 1 lb) and then spead the filling on top, followed by the rest of the sauce and the huge layer of cheeses.  ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!

Great recipe, I added an extra can of mushroom soup just to make it a bit creamier. Other than that I didn't change a thing and it was great. Even my very picky 6 year old cleaned her plate.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but my instincts told me anything with a can of creamed soup dumped on the top is not a good idea... they were right!  I don't use jarred sauces, but if I had a jar of spag sauce, I would've dumped it in too.  This was dry, bland and very unappealing to the eye.  I froze the leftovers, but I have a feeling they will be in there for a long time to come.    I'm sorry, just not for us I guess.

DELICIOUS and so EASY!  I did make just a couple of slight changes- I made a sauce with about a cup of premade spaghetti sauce, a can of cream of mushroom and two eggs (to help bind). I also left out the peppers (just because I didn't have any).  I then just layered the sauce among the rest of the ingrediants.  It was SO GOOD! My four year old had it for lunch and supper and would probably have it for breakfast if I had let her!

My husband did however mention that he would like it spicier, perhaps some spicy sausage added to it.  Which I think would be great for just an adult meal!

Very good, I make this all the time.  I cheat and used canned spaghetti sauce and it still turns out great.  My family and everyone I make if for loves it.  It freezes well too.  Very good with fat free cream of mush soup.

I have made this recipe 2 times.  The second time, I added more diced tomatoes and it was a little saucier.  Both times I added mozarella cheese.  My whole family ate it up quicker than I could keep up with filling their bowls!  Great recipe for kids and adults!

Loved it!  I took it to a pot luck dinner and was asked several times for the recipe.  It's a crowd pleaser - will definitely make it again.  I added a bit more cheese, and no mushrooms, as my kids don't like them.  Thanks!

This recipe is simple to assemble and bake. I will make it again with some alterations. I will add more spice to zip it up somehow. Possibly using Italian sausage and more seasonings. Family liked it but everyone felt it needed something, kinda bland.

My 10 year old loves this.  I use leftover cooked spaghetti noodles, low fat medium cheddar and a larger tin of tomatoes.  After the 10 minutes of simmering I drain off most of the excess liquid and the end product comes out fine.  Just make sure you wisk the soup and water well.  This casserole is easy to assemble in the morning and then pop in the oven when one gets home from work.  Enjoy.

This was a great recipe. I read the reviews and added spices, more cheese, some tomato sauce and an extra can of mushroom soup. My husband loved it and offered to do the dishes. I let him. Served with texas toast. I will definatly make this again.

My husband and our company loved this meal.  I added the cayenne pepper that another user suggested and it gave the dish the extra kick that made this meal standout from other "spaghetti" dishes.  I used the soup as a layer in addition the final topping.  I used the chopped vegetables as the recipie called for but also added 3/4 jar of Classico spaghetti sauce(my pan was smaller than 9x13).  This also came in handy if the leftovers were too dry.  I simply added a bit of sauce to the bottom of the plate and added the spaghetti bake on top, warmed it, and the dish was perfect again.

Yum!! A huge hit here.  Accidently mixed the soup and cheese together...but no biggie. It's a keeper.

I got a "This is good" out of the mother-in-law with this one! I replaced the diced tomato and oregano with Italian stewed tomatoes that I crushed. I will use two cans of mushroom soup for the top next time. I covered it for half of the bake time too as well. Definately a keeper. Yummo!!

This was really good and still tastes great after being frozen.  I'm a vegetarian so I used TVP instead of beef and cut down on the cheese to reduce calories and it was still very good.

This was really good.  I make several meals each month for people who are sick or recuperating from surgery.  This will be perfect to take to them.

I've made this recipe many times and it's great for company. But I suggest you use a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, not 16 oz.  I omit the ground beef and add a small can of sliced black olives, drained.  I save some of the olives and use them to make a heart on top of the casserole.  It's a different baked spaghetti, but very good!

This recipe was good however I made a few changes.  I added seasonings to my ground beef as it browned and I also added a jar of prego w/green peppers and mushrooms to the meat mixture.  I layered the spag, meat mixture, cream of mushroom, cheese and then the spag, meat etc....Served with some texas toast - It was great.  TFS.

I made this for the first time when my parents came for dinner.  They are skilled chefs themselves and raved about this dish!!  They loved it and both went home with the recipe.  My husband loved it too.  (He is Italian and knows how to cook very well.  I call the kitchen "chez Re-shez" when he cooks, cause the kitchen smells so good, like a restaurant!!)  
     I tasted the sauce part as it simmered in the pan, and thought it to be a little bland, so I added italian seasoning, seasoning salt, 2 cloves crushed garlic, garlic salt,(all sprinkled to taste), and about 2 cups of Classico Four cheeses Spaghetti Sauce).  I also added a bit more water to the soup than original recipe.  Once I poured the soup on top, I kind of poked it down through the top so it would seep down through the rest of the ingredients. This recipe is a keeper!

Love this!  I use jar pasta sauce and layer the cream of mushroom soup as well.  My husband is always excited when he finds out this is for dinner!  I always make it ahead of time when I know dinner time will be hectic.

I made this recipe last night (with some changes).  I used no green peppers, a jar of spaghetti sauce in place of the tomatoes , smoked sausage slices, an extra can of mushroom soup, and extra water.  

Even with the changes, this recipe was great!!!  My husband, the finicky eater, even loved it.  It's a really versatile recipe.  You can make any number of changes, and it still comes out great.  Thanks LaDonna.

this was good, but i would put a layer of soup and cheese over the first pasta/meat layer as well as on the top...it seemed like it didn't quite make it all the way down to the bottom and the pasta was a little plain down there.

This was a tasty dish but needs a few changes.  Next time I will use a more concentrated spaghetti sauce and use fewer noodles.  I liked the consistency of the finished dish, though.  I was also surprised that the mushroom soup didn't taste like mushroom soup.  It also browned very nicely on the top.

Awesome recipe!  I wasn't sure what the cream of mushroom soup poured over the top was going to taste like, but it all blended together as it baked in the oven and it was very tasty!  For a twist, next time I might add some black olives, or Italian sausage, or maybe bits of pepperoni.

This is a great recipe!  The only thing that I did different, was use jar spaghetti sauce.  The flavor was wonderful.. My husband was a little skeptical (because of the cream of mushroom soup), but once he tasted it he loved it!  Makes for great leftovers.  **Note**  I took the advice of some of the other reviews and used less water, about half.  Definitely a keeper!

I had my doubts about the tomatoes and mushroom soup in the same dish but this turned out ok.  The water with the soup is a must to thin it. I didn't add the green pepper as they don't like us but used all the other ingredents.  I agree that this is much tastier the 2nd day.  Will make it again but will add more seasonings next time.

My husband made this tonight.  It was very good!  He made a few substitutions.  He used whole tomatoes instead of diced, and for spices he used Italian spices and Montreal Steak spice.  Tasty!

This is absolutely the best spahetti I have ever had!  I passed it along to several friends and my mother and they all agree it is the very best!  I took a batch to work one night, needless to say, everyone raved on and on about it!  Don't forget to drain the meat or you might end up with a lot of grease!  I love this recipe!!!!

It was tasty - I used my homemade spaghetti sauce in place of the veggies & tomatoes.  The mushroom soup gave it a different tang - my kids gobbled it down.

Spaghetti lovers will enjoy this.  It's a great way to make a favored classic.  I suggest though that you add more spices and tomato sauce than what the recipe calls for.  I also used sharp cheddar instead of mild and it turned out great.

I found this recipe to be an easy way to casually entertain close friends. It is handy to put together ahead of time and "take and bake" as needed. I added a tossed salad and garlic bread. It fed 8 people and we still had leftovers!

This was VERY easy, and delicious. I added a little garlic to the meat mixture for some added flavor.

I understand why the recipe calls for the cream of mushroom soup as it does add a creaminess to it but it was WAY to think to spread on the top even with 1 cup of water. I thought it would mix in with the spaghetti more as it cooked down but it really just stayed as a thick layer on the top.  Towards the end of cooking I just mixed it all together so the mushroom soup wouldn't just be on the top.

I’ve been making this for years for gatherings and it’s always a hit!  I’ve had many people ask me for the recipe. If your a cheese lover, I’d suggest to add more cheese than what the recipe calls for.

I love this recipe and it’s on my regular rotation. I always use bulk/ground spicy Italian sausage instead of ground beef and it gives it a more complex flavor.

Many years ago this one of the first recipes I tried from Allrecipes and it is still one of the most frequent that I use. I just love this baked spaghetti a lot. 95% of the time I make it just exactly as writen. Over the years, I've tried variations to it, but I always come back to the original. One variation I tried that I would suggest at least once is to add some pepperoni slices between the meat layers and the cheeses.

As with most recipes, I didn’t follow this to the letter, I used Italian sausage, a full pound of pasta, because that’s what’s in the box, and I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, because that’s what I had in the pantry.  It was still fabulous!!

I make this exactly as written except we use 2 lb of 93% lean ground turkey.  This recipe did NOT sound good to me when I first read it, but it has become a favorite in my house, especially during the cold season here in the Northeast after soccer practice.  Make sure to use angel hair or vermicelli pasta as I think it turns out better than when using standard spaghetti.

I substituted Mozzarella cheese for the Cheddar and Sausage for the Hamburger.  I also added a small can of tomato sauce and an extra can of Cream of Mushroom Soup so I had plenty of sauce.

I agree with another reviewer who said this is a five star without changing a thing. This isn’t your typical spaghetti dish. It’s not supposed to have an overabundance of sauce. It’s different, but it’s delicious. If you make a lot of changes you’re not getting the same recipe. Do yourself a favor and make it the first time around just like it says. Then if you want to change something based on your personal taste go ahead. But I would highly suggest trying it just like it is. We’ve been making this for years. It is so so good and it reheats great in fact it’s probably better the second day around.

I've never written a review but I just wanted to say I don't understand why people change the recipe so much.  If you make so many changes then you should write a new recipe and just rate this recipe.  I nearly always make a recipe exactly how it is written the first time and then next time make my changes. I think it is a rude insult to the original  person that post the recipe. We are asked to rate the recipe not what would you change about it.  Maybe you should just be able to rate it and have another area to add your changes/suggestions.   Rant over.

Wonderful! I was skeptical at first but this turned out wonderful.
Of course, as everyone else, I made some changes due to lack of Ingredients.
I used pasta sauce instead of tomatoes. I used 1 cup of mozzarella to replace one cup of cheddar.  And lastly, I mixed everything together with the noodles before putting it in the pan, instead of layering.
I will be making this again!

I  have also been making this recipe for years and it's awesome!  The original recipe calls for 28 ounces of diced tomatoes, undrained and a 2-1/4 ounce can of sliced black olives!  I'm lazy and mix everything but the cheese together......place half of it all in 9x13; top with 1/2 the cheese , repeat...then do the mushroom soup and parmesan!  But always add the seasoning you and your family prefer!  I do, of course, season the meat a bit when cooking it up!   Good with ground turkey, also! This is truly an old recipe and if done as originally written it's great!  Do be sure to spray or grease the pan!

Great recipe. I have made something similar for years. I love this recipe with the mushroom soup. I thought my husband would eat the whole pan. Lol. I did double the sauce and added an extra can of tomatoes to the mix as I used 16 oz of spaghetti instead of 12 oz. I was worried it might be too dry. It was just right. Thank you for sharing.

We really liked this much better than expected.  I took the advice of another reviewer who didn't layer but rather just mixed it up together in a bowl after cooking the beef, pepper and onion.  Only kept out the parm cheese to sprinkle on top.  Made a little more than the recipe.  Used 1.5 lbs of ground beef, a 6 ounce jar of mushrooms, one large green pepper, one 8 oz bag of cheese, as well as a large can of plum tomatoes which I crushed up by hand, and a little more than one package of spaghetti.   My picky husband even liked it.  Made plenty!!!  Only thing I would do differently next time is to add some salt and red pepper spice to give it a little more kick.  Also might try sharp cheese instead of mild.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family lived this, well my picky 11 year old tolerated it, which to our dinner standards is saying a lot!  I made exactly as written, except I used fresh mushrooms.  This will make the monthly rotation.  Next Time I may leave ground beef out and increase vegetables.

We didn't change a thing the first time around, and I'm sure we'll be making it again.  The cream of mushroom soup makes this dish.  If we make any changes next time, it'll probably be to add a little more of it.

The family loved it! I used barilla plus spaghetti so that added protein and didn't change the taste. The only other different thing I did was use a combo of softened cream cheese (entire stick) and 8oz of sour cream mixed them together in a bowl and then mixed that with the soup rather than water. I then layered this cream sauce with the spaghetti and meat. major hit and addictive

I made this (I used pasta sauce as my son does not like tomato chunks, I added extra italian seasonings and garlic powder) and I would make this again but I would add more sauce or tomato juice as my husband and I thought it was dry.

I rarely rate recipes, and I hate rating them after changing the whole thing, but this recipe is amazing! The cream of mushroom soup really added to the dish, and I never substitute diced tomatoes for jarred sauce. I hate mushrooms so the soup is just enough for me, and I usually season the meat a bit while cooking. Of course I also added garlic, like I do to most dishes. Overall amazing recipe! Can't believe the complaints about how much time it took, wasn't too bad for me! Will make again...and again...and again..

Would have given it 5 stars, but I made a few changes! Instead of cheddar I used mozzarella cheese, and added onions powder and red pepper seasoning to the meat. Other than that, no changes! My family LOVED it, they were fighting over the remaining spaghetti!

I made this for dinner one night and everyone loved it! I added two cans of mushrooms instead of one and just used the juice from the tomatoes instead of water to mix with the mushroom soup. Everything turned out perfect! Will be making again!

This recipe is really good! Maybe needs just a little something. Possibly a little red pepper flakes. But I loved it even without it. Only added italian seasoning and basil. Used fresh mushrooms and mozzarella cheese.  Yum!

Made this tonight and it was yummy! Because I was short on time I used a jar of spaghetti sauce (probably could have used a jar and a half) instead of the tomatoes and mushrooms. I didn't use the green pepper either because I don't like them. Overall this was so good! I'll be adding it to my actual recipe box that I have in my home as soon as I write it on a recipe card!

My family loved it also. But I did make a few changes as well. No bell pepper, my family doesn't like it. I used jar sauce instead of tomatoes and I used a mixture of mozzarella & parm cheese. I also used half a cup of water for the mushroom soup. Was good. Will make again, I'm sure.

I wanted to stay true to the original recipe, so I changed only a couple of things:  I crushed fresh garlic into the beef, onion and peppers and I substituted white wine for the water with the mushroom soup. Excellent recipe and I will definitely make this again!

This is a great basic/starter recipe easy to adapt.  Personal changes/preferences:  fettucine instead of spaghetti; mexican 4cheese mix for the first layer; mozzarella for the top; 1.5lb of ground beef instead of 1lb; sauted (1) orange and (1) yellow bell pepper with red onion in EVOO, only because I didn't have green. LOL Seasoned fettucine with EVOO; Omitted the COM soup...husband doesn't like it (although I would) wonderful with green salad, garlic bread/toast.  YUM!!!! I really like some of the other reviewers ideas of extra mushrooms, extra tomatoes, etc.  But my husband doesn't like mushrooms and doesn't care for a lot of tomatoes so I will definitely try it again, with a different twist next time.

It was delightful comfort food, my whole family (including the two year old) had seconds, which is unheard of.  The only changes were that I did not have any bell peppers on hand, so I left that out, I only had fresh mushrooms, and I used a can of Progresso non-condensed cream of mushroom soup, so I skipped the water.  Oh, and I used those secret veggie noodles that had corn and squash in them for a vitamin boost.  Will make again soon!
Update: I have since made this with sometimes extra noodles, half the meat, twice the mushrooms, with peppers, without peppers, extra cheese, sharp cheddar, mixed cheese, but the basic noodles, tomatoes, and soup base just lends itself to super versatility!  I often make the meat portion ahead and freeze it, and I can make this dish super fast with little mess, and everyone loves it!

Made this for a church potluck and almost all of it was eaten! Used ground turkey instead of beef and liberally applied an Italian seasoning blend while it was browning so I did not add the teaspoon of oregano. The canned tomatoes already had basil and oregano added for more Italian flavor. The only other change I made was to use cream of celery soup since I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup. Will definitely make this again.

We loved this recipe! The next time I make it, I'll add a bit more soup and maybe a bit of water just to give it a more creamy texture.  I also added some italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Yummy!  Will make again!

I thought this was great!  I chaged it a little to use what I had on hand.  I did't have tomatoes so I used spaghetti sauce.  I also did't have cheddar cheese so I left that out.  Also, I used sweet baby peppers instead of green peppers.  As others suggested, I mixed the noodles with the rest instead of layering it.  The cream of mushroom just made a great dish better!

You just can't go wrong with this.  It's easy to make.  It's inexpensive.  It makes a lot.  It's great the next day. You can mess with it if you want, but there really is no need to change a thing.  Good stuff, for sure.

This is a great recipe! I'm always searching for different tastes and this one was a tastebud pleaser! My young daughter's devoured it without me having to ask twice! I made a couple of changes as I used ground turkey and ground chiken sausage, in addition to slices of mild cheddar cheese instead of shredded! Other than that the recipe is a new fav in my home and I will probably make it as a side dish to take to my brother's for Thanksgiving! 
Thanks

So good! It was simple and i loved that i could make it  ahead of time and then cook it. The only thing i did different was add some tomato pasta sauce to the meat mixture to give it a bit more sauce. Will make again!

Great recipe for whole family.  I added a can of tomato sauce (8oz) and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  I also added chopped veggies and 1 clove of garlic.  All these changes made it very saucy and delicious. My picky husband even told me to add this to the rotation.  Loved it as leftover and with the added tomato sauce there weren't any issues with it being too dry the next day!

I was missing a couple ingredients, so I made a few substitutions: I used canned spaghettis sauce instead of the tomatoes, and I used breakfast sausage instead of the ground beef. Instead of layering the ingredients, I mixed everything together, then spread the cream of mushroom soup on top (actually I used cream of chicken because I accidentally opened the wrong can), then topped the whole thing with colby jack cheese and parmesan. It was delicious! I made this for a crowd, and everyone came back for seconds. I'll definitely be making this again.

I was very disappointed in this recipe!  It's so bland even with added cheese and seasonings!  I probably would not make it again,

I had some sour cream that needed to be used so I added about a half-cup to the mushroom soup/water mix.  Terrific!  I could have added the whole container and it would have been even better.  Overall, very good, I will make it again, maybe next time with chicken.

After reading all of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to try this.  I was looking for a pasta dish that didn't have a lot of tomato sauce for a pre-race meal for my husband, so I decided to give this a try anyway!  I only made a couple of tiny changes:  I used a whole onion and bell pepper.  I also used two cans of mushrooms and tomatoes since I had made extra noodles.  I did add extra seasoning to taste to the meat mixture and I just mixed everything together instead of layering for ease.  It was the perfect amount of sauce for the noodles!  This recipe is awesome if you are looking for something that isn't very saucy.  If you feel that spaghetti means you have to have a lot of red sauce, then you should try another recipe!  My husband and I both loved this and will definitely make it again!!

I thought this recipe was a little bland.  Since it does not have the tomato sauce base it lacks flavor since the mushroom sauce flavor is much more subtle.  I may make it again.  I probably would omit the canned tomatoes and just add a jar of spaghetti sauce in it's place.  I also prefer mozzarella in dishes like these so I would substitute that for the cheddar.  This recipe has some good potential I just thought, as is, it is missing something.  It also would have more flavor if made with Italian Sausage rather than ground beef.

WOWZIE!  This is DEE-LISH-OUS!!!  The ONLY slight change I made was to use Italian Seasoning instead of oregano.  The mushroom soup absolutely rocks!  I will never use a different recipe for baked spaghetti!  Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

Great recipe to use up leftovers...I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup since my family likes extra sauce. I also used diced fresh tomatoes. Next time I might try leftover cooked chicken instead of the ground beef.

Great! Read the reviews, made my own adjustments - substituted yogurt and mayo for soup, had own sauce made with meat already mixed in, and went half cheddar and half mozarella. And added a little bit of kosher salt after reading reviews. It's in my saved List!

I made this last night and it was very good.  Because I tend to like lots of sauce on dishes I was tempted to reduce the amount of pasta, but I went ahead and used what was called for and it was fine.  I dont like green peppers so I used a red pepper.  And I used fresh mushrooms.  The shredded cheese I had was called Pizza Blend and was half cheddar and half mozzarella.  I had to cook it longer than the recipe said for it to brown.  It was a nice change from the more standard baked spaghetti.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I added more mushroom soup than it called for because we like a lot of sauce.

I will have say that the prep time listed is completely off...it takes much longer than 10 minutes to cook the meat and spaghetti. Definitely worth the extra time though!

This is an awesome recipe! Made it for lunch and it was a big hit. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some extra seasoning. I added salt, pepper, garlic salt and a little cayanne pepper. I did not have geen bell peppers so I used red and yellow ones. The flavor was delecious!! May add some olives next time!

This is seriously AMAZING! I did a few changes. I used spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes, no green peppers, and added a whole package of sliced fresh mushrooms. I also mixed the noodles together so each noodle would be covered with sauce. Instead of Cheddar cheese I used mozarella. Will definitely use again. YUMMY!!!

I thought it was great!  Used ground turkey, chopped yellow and red pepper (instead of green), and added some chopped carrot just for some more vegetables.  A great dish to make for someone or for having company over.

This turned out very bland. It did help when i added parmesean cheese and garlic salt to the individual servings and heated them together. I also added a clove of garlic, 1 tsp. basil, and 2 tsp. onion powder to the meat while I was cooking it.

Yummy dish... I used my leftover spaghetti that was mixed with ground turkey from the night before, and followed the rest of the recipe to a "T" and it came out great!  Nice to have a different dish for leftover spaghetti.

I made this tonight for dinner.  My husband loved it and had asked me to make this again, but for me and my daughter, it was different, but good.  I guest I am used to making spaghetti the regular way with spaghetti sauce and not soup.  The only think I did different was that I added Italian sausage to the ground beef.   I really seasoned the meat when I was browning it, so that it wouldn’t taste bland, as one review stated.  The next time I make this I will use spaghetti sauce.

Kind of a nice twist on regular spaghetti...I left out the bell pepper because I don't care for it and added some extra seasonings.  I also tossed the noodles in some pasta sauce to flavor the noodles.  I'll likely try a different recipe the next time I want to make baked spaghetti.

I boiled the noodles 8 minutes and ran them under cold water, I remember reading somewhere that will stop the cooking process??  I used ground pork opposed to beef, then I drained off the fat, then added the onions, cooked for awhile, I ommited the mushrooms, I added half a jar of spaghetti sauce to the meat and tomatoe mixture.  I also added a clove of garlic and basil.  I added more cheese then called for too.  I baked 35min and let it set for 10.  It was delish, I will make again

I made this last night, and I think if I were to follow the recipe to a "t" it would've been pretty bland and dry.  I added a can of tomato sauce, about 4 cloves of garlic, and an Italian herb blend to the recipe, as well as some salt and pepper.  I don't know that the soup added anything besides some much needed moisture.  That being said, the end results with my modifications were pretty good and the family enjoyed it.  Plus I think it will be an easily reheatable dinner!

This dish was a hit with my family!  None of my 3 kids typically eat mushrooms, so I left the canned mushrooms out, but still topped it with the cream of mushroom soup.  I used spaghetti sauce, left in the 1 tsp of oregano, substituted one poblano pepper for the green bell pepper, and it was flavored perfectly.  We will definitely be having this again!

Always a favorite at my house. Works well for dinner guests as baked spaghetti is not a usual dish in many families. Kids will eat this as well.

My hubby said that this was the best baked spaghetti he ever had. It was so delicious.  The cream of mushroom was fantastic.  I used the recommendations from RanchGirl and the dish is a definate keeper.  We will definately be adding this to our family rotation.

Pretty good, especially if you are like me, and prefer less tomato and more flavor.

This was great and easy to make.  Only a corner left for tomorrow!  Mostly followed the recipe.  Didn't have mushrooms on hand.  Added a little red pepper for an extra kick.  This recipe will be added to the dinner rotation :)

DH and I were very pleasantly surprised. It was a delicious meal. I only left out mushrooms because I was out. Great to have a use for cream of mushroom soup- I'm not usually a fan. Thankyou for sharing

It was awesome. The only thing I did extra was add pinches of black pepper, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper (for some kick) to the meat. It was a very simple recipe that I will make again very soon!

Love it!  I followed the recipe with only minor alterations: I only had a 14.5 oz can of tomatoes (I guess that's the only size I can get around here) and so I added one chopped tomato.  I also added a touch of Italian seasoning on top of the oregano. In the future, I may add extra cheese (mmm...cheese!) and possibly corn or some mixed veggies from a can, but I really enjoyed this recipe as is. It's a keeper!

This is a very good recipe. My husband said this is the best spaghetti he has ever had. I followed the recommendations from ranchgirl. They were good. However, next time I will drain the diced tomatoes and will not add cayene pepper.

I added a few spices as suggested. But overall, it's not even as exciting as my normal spaghetti recipe & it's twice the prep. time. Reminds me of something you would get from the school cafeteria. Hearty, filling, but blah..My vote..most sustaining!

This was great! Will definitely make again.  These were my alterations based on others comments.  I used a half package of linguine,  one green pepper, one red pepper, one onion, only 1/2 lb of ground beef, and 1/4 cup half & half instead of water.  The other ingredients were kept the same, except no Parmesan.  I just mixed it all together and then added the shredded cheese on  top. (wasn't two cups maybe 1 1/2,)and baked 20 minutes, right after assembling.  Excellent.  This was not dry, but may be when reheated, but that's o.k.

This is somewhat good.  I found the spaghetti noodles to be a little too dry and not enough tomatoes.  Next time, I will use more tomatoes and an extra can of soup.  Overall, pretty good.

This was an absolute hit! I only made changes based on what I had on hand, but next time I make it I will follow the recipe. It's good to know it will turn out great even if it is missing some of the fresh ingredients (mushrooms).

EXCELLENT recipe! My husband and I both loved this dish as well as our picky 4-year old...he's already asked to have it again. The only things that i did differently is that i used a large can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 a can of tomato sauce and then just let it simmer until it was thick.

Was a little unsure of this because of lack of tomato sauce, but it was great. Had turkey sausage on hand so I subbed it for the ground beef and instead of green peppers, I used chopped spinach to get a into my kids. I will be cooking this again soon.

Excellent change from regular spaghetti.  Even my picky son loves this one.  Sometimes I'll mix it up and use a large jar of pasta sauce or cream sauce instead of the cream of mushroom soup.

my husband and I loved this recipe after I made a few adjustments.  I used petite diced tomatoes and added another can because there was not enough sauce.  I did not add the green bell peppers because we do not like them. I also added garlic.  This is an excellent meal and very easy.

Much better than the traditional baked spaghetti. The cream of mushroom gives it a great flavor. Serve with garlic bread! Very easy and for sure a keeper. My husband & sister-in-law loved it!

I had baked spaghetti in my college dorm for the first time years ago. Since then I have tried different times to recreate that recipe. This recipe sounded like a good start. I really enjoyed this meal! I didn't have cream of mushroom and I wanted it to be similar to the original so I substituted the soup for a jar of spaghetti sauce. I used ground turkey and added the sauteed peppers and onions while it browned. Then I added the diced tomatoes and cooked spinach (this is a great way to get my kids to eat it--they love it added to sauces!!). Once it was cooked I added the spaghetti sauce and simmered. I put a nice layer of noodles in a greased casserole dish then added the meat mixture. I sprinkled with cheese and added more noodles on top. I layered it again with the meat mixture making sure the noodles were generously covered (to prevent drying). If you need to add more sauce do so! I poured about 1/2 cup water over the layers before I topped it with pepperoni and a final layer of cheese. I than topped it with some grated parmesan. Feel free to add or substitute ingredients to your liking. It turned out great. My kids loved it and the leftovers the next day were even better. Thanks!

My family loves this recipe. the only change I made was adding sliced beef sausage to the hamburger. I originally had doubts about putting cream of mushroom in with spaghetti but it actually turned out to be delicious. My mother even calls to ask can I make this special spaghetti dish for her and her hubby from time to time.

As written, this is a 3 star recipe. It was very dry and bland in my opinion. We made the following changes: used 1 whole green pepper, 2 jars of mushrooms, 1 & 1/2 pounds ground beef, subbed mozzarella cheese, simmered beef mixture with 1 jar of sweet basil spaghetti sauce and used a smaller dish so that it somewhat held it's shape when you cut it. The mushroom soup mixture gave it an odd flavor when reheated. With our changes, though, I would give it 4 stars. Still missing something.

I really liked this recipe. The cream of mushroom soup was a great addition. My husband wanted a little bit more sauce in the pasta. Next time I think I'll add some soup to the bottom of the pan.

Excellent recipe, I doubled the mushrooms, added some garlic salt but other than that followed exactly. I also covered with foil for the first 25 minutes so it wouldn't dry out and then uncovered for last 10 minutes. Was good that night and even better the next!

This was really good! I was pleasantly surprised, and my husband and daughter liked it as well. I left out the green pepper as I'm not a fan at all, and I did do half ground beef, half ground sausage, and added some eatra seasonings, including garlic and fennel. I was a little worried about the spaghetti being dry, so I added a little extra milk to the cream of mushroom soup, and added that to the noodles in two layers, rather than just all on top. I really liked the way the soup made it taste. I'll definately be adding this to my monthly family dinners. I think next time I'll try it with fresh mushrooms.

This is a very good recipe.  My boyfriend said last night while eating "this is the way spaghetti should be cooked."  I have made it several times, and last night when I went to get my M-room soup I didn't have, so I used celery.  It was just as good!

I normally make this with spaghetti sauce, but this way was great. I used ground turkey and added garlic powder, Italian seasoning and s&p to everything. Also, added fresh parsley and fresh parmesan after baking. Thanks for sharing!

This is one of the best recipes!!  I make 1 1/2 cans of mushroom soup mixture and I us 2 cups of motzerella and 2 cups colby/jack!  I usually cook it an extra 10 minutes or so, it holds together better.  :)

I thought this recipe was very good.  I used 99% fat free turkey, low fat cheese, and fat free cream of mushroom to cut calories a little bit.  I think next time I will definitely use some more sauce because it was a little dry.  But that's the only thing I would change... the mushroom soup was delish!

This recipe is okay. Its just basic spaghetti popped in the oven. I did not like the cream of mushroom at all. I knew from my grandmother to add some to spaghetti but have never liked it though. So next time I will add only a tablespoon at the most. As it was, I only put in half the can of soup and it was way too much. I didn't have green pepper and that didn't affect it. But I took it out of the oven early as the noodles were starting to dry out. We just ate it like spaghetti. I'm not even sure the family realized it was anything different.

I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and also added 8 oz of tomato sauce. It was very moist and we loved the leftovers.

It was good.  My family enjoyed it.  Didn't have mushrooms.  Substituted red pepper for green pepper.  It still turned out good!

This was just ok. It seemed kind of dry to me, and the flavor just wasn't worth the work. My husband liked it, but my daughter who LOVES regular spaghetti didn't. The mushroom soup just kind of sat on top - I would recommend more water. I won't be making this again.

Excellent!  I did not add tomatoes since I didn't have any on hand and I added a little extra water to soup.  Also baked with foil on top to keep moisture in!  Very very good!

It may be unfair to rate this 4 stars, and not 5, as I didn't realize until the very end that I only had Parmesan left. Still, the recipe turned out reasonably well.

Bachelor friendly.

I found this recipe in my first issue of Taste of Home (1990's)and have loved it ever since.  I make it a lot and it wouldn't be the same without the mushroom soup. When my son makes it, he mixes it all up together and bakes it.

Really tasty simple recipe. Great way to stuff a bunch of vegetables into pasta for the toddler. I didn't even have spaghetti, just used egg noodles and some rotini I had leftover, worked fine. Could have used a bit more liquid somewhere, next time I'll follow other's suggestions and add an addtl can of tomatoes.

I made this for dinner tonight....delicious.  I also took the advice of others here and added 2 cans of dice tomatoes and 1 can of tomato paste.  I also added extra green pepper and mushrooms.  My family loved this...I plan on keeping this on file and will certainly make it again. Thanks so much for sharing!!

Loved it! My fiance thought it tasted very good. It is a different twist on baked spaghetti. The next time I bake this though I will add an extra can of cream os mushroom soup and some garlic in the meat mixture for some extra flavor. It is definitely a dish that I will be making again!

This was a big hit at my house. I didn't have mushrooms so I left them out and I also added another can of cream of mushroom soup. I mixed all the ingredients together like some suggested and it turned out perfect. Leftovers were not a problem, because there were none:) Will certainly use this recipe again!

Not fancy schmancy but a nice, filling, quick and easy weeknight meal.  Everyone (husband, 8, 6, 4 year olds) ate it willingly so that's always a plus.  I made it almost just as written (minus the green pepper - didn't have one, and substituted 1/4 cups mayo and sour cream for the cream of mush soup).  It wasn't dinner party quality but a definate keeper for the "have-ground-beef-but-don't-know-what-to-do-with-it" night.

This wasn't very good to me. A lot of the ingredients are what I've been using for regular spaghetti for years, so I thought I would try it. For the longest I stood in the kitchen debating on whether or not to use the cream of mushroom soup. I decided what the heck and try it out. It was not very good. Also this recipe did not have very much flavor at all. Don't think I will try this again.

This was good.  I can't give it five stars because I did change some things.  I really wanted more of a tomato sauce so I added a 19 oz. can of italian stewed tomatoes and a 14 oz. can of tomato sauce.  I added fresh mushrooms and a little of my own seasonings.  I mixed the mushroom soup with skim milk instead of water.  I also left the last layer of cheese for the very top so that it would be a nice golden brown crust.  I would definitely make this again.

This was really good. Even my picky mom was impressed. I did make some changes though. No green peppers or mushrooms since my kids hate them. I added a 1/2 cup of sauce to the meat mixture and I put half cheddar and half mozzeralla for the cheese.

This is a good recipe, but with a few changes it's a GREAT recipe.  I make it this way frequently and my husband asks for it all the time!  Also a hit at a potluck.  I leave out the green peppers, substitute lean italian turkey sausage for the groung beef; 1 fresh  tomato + a can of tomato sauce in place of the canned diced tomatoes; and substitute mozzarella or an italian blend of cheeses instead of the cheddar.  I also add basil liberally to the meat/tomato mixture when it's cooking.  But the cream of mushroom soup is a must!  You can also dress it up by adding fresh mushrooms and chopped basil on top.

My husband and I really liked this dish.  I loved the mushroom sauce, so much in fact next time instead of just putting it on the top I will put two layers of the suace and parmesian cheese, one in the middle and one on top.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It's one I will be making again.

Pretty good, but I had to make a few changes. I left out the bellpepper, b/c I hate it. I added minced garlic instead. I put in whole jar of Ragu chuncky Garden style spaghetti sauce to make it more saucy. I also used a little less cheddar cheese and fat free cream of mushroom soup. This recipe would not be half as good without the soup. No one belives me when I tell them it isn't mozzerella cheese on the top!

I definitely will not be making this again!  No one in our house would eat it.  After one bite, everyone pitched it.  The mushroom soup ruins the dish.  It tastes nothing like baked spaghetti, more like a really messed up tuna casserole.  UGH!

Yum! My first time making baked spaghetti and my husband and I loved it. I added extra sauce based off of tips from other reviewers and I think it was a good move. Next time, I will add some fresh chopped garlic to the meat sauce to give it an extra kick. All in all, really good.

Made this last evening and it was excellent. The only slight change I made was using sharp cheddar for mild. It is a very tasty, filling dish and I highly recommend it. Would be fine for potluck dinners.

I really liked this recipe.  I did add about 1 Cup of jarred sauce because I felt that it needed it.   My 6 year old daughter loved this also.

I really like this recipe because it was both creamy and hearty. Hearty from the tomato based meat sauce and creamy from the mushroom sauce topping. The best of both worlds! I snuck more veggies in though.

It was very good however I would add another can of soup or something to make it a little more creamy.  It was a bit dry and very dry the next day! The flavor was outstanding

Delicious!  I hate to tamper with a recipe that apparently is great "as is", cause it did make the cookbook. However, I did add a 12 ounce can of tomato paste to the meat mixture which made it saucier.

This was ok.  I also felt like it was missing something and we thought it needed more sauce to make it a little creamier.  Would probably not make again.  Thanks for letting us try.

I was not at all impressed with this recipe.  For us, it definatly needed more meat and some marinara sauce.  If I do make this again, I will change it up.  Thank you for the recipe though.

I left out the green pepper and mushrooms since my husband doesn't care for them. It still turned out tasty. It wasn't as saucy as I was expecting, however.

This was an easy, easy dish that my family really loved!  The cream of mushroom soup really added flavor, and the cheddar cheese thats inbetween the layers was bold, too.  The only things that I changed about the recipe were that I added more parmesan cheese and I also used diced tomatoes with some sort of spicy peppers in them.  I didn't really notice that the spice was there though, I think it was because of the soup.  I will make this again and again!

This was wonderful!  I also used fresh mushrooms and drained the fat out of the meat after cooking.  I added 1/2 C spaghetti sauce, salt and pepper... this was a winner and I will make it again!

This recipe did not go-over well with my family.  It was very bland to the point where I could not even pay my four-year old to eat it.  I guess we will stick to our traditional spaghetti.

Ok, I made a version of this with a few changes for a quick dinner.  It turned out great!  I made my own spaghetti sauce without meat.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added a small can of spaghetti sauce.  (It would still work well with meat, I just didn't have any on hand.  I may also try chicken.)  I seasoned the sauce with Italian seasoning, salt, a little cayenne pepper and dash or sugar.  Instead of Cheddar cheese, I used mozzarella.  Then I layered noodles, sauce, and cream of mushroom and repeated.  Finally topping with the cheese.  It had great flavor and texture.  Definately a keeper!

I used crumbled bacon instead of ground beef and didn't use green bell pepper. Also added tomato sauce and topped it bit mozarella. It was good but not something I'd go crazy for...

Our family really enjoyed this recipe.  Like previous reviewers, I added tomato sauce (Bravo) to my meat/vegetable mixture.  I also put the mushroom soup on both layers, rather than just on top.  All in all, a nice, hearty meal.

Yummy! My 3 year old really loved it, too.  We don't eat hydrogenated oil or MSG, so I subbed Imagine Portabello Mushroom soup for the cream soup, and it came out great.  I used about 12 oz. of soup total and left out the water.  I also used red instead of green peppers, mozarella instead of Cheddar, and a can of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes. I added garlic powder and fresh basil to round out the spices.

Very cheezy.  I used a combo of ground beef and pork sausage which made it especially good.

I tried this recipe tonight.  We loved it.  It was a great variation of spaghetti.  I too used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and a little extra ground beef.  Instead of mixing the cream of mushroom soup with water and pouring over the casserole, I mixed the can of soup with the sauce mix while it simmered. Next time I will add a little sausage to spice it up.  Great recipe!!!  Thanks LaDonna

Excellent recipe! Everyone in my family liked it, even my husband who is not a pasta eater at all.  Here's my own variation: sauteed garlic, onions, fresh tomatoes and fresh mushrooms. Added 1 sm can of tomato sauce & tomato paste. I also used diced tomatoes with jalapeno (bought it by mistake) but turned out to be really good because it gave the sauce a little bit of a kick. I layered the meat sauce, mushroom soup and sharp cheddar cheese. I used mozzarella cheese on top. I also added more ground pepper and dried oregano.  The only thing I would change next time is to brown and drain the ground beef separately before adding to the red sauce. One last thing, I used penne pasta instead. I also had some leftover sauce and mixed it with macaroni pasta, then topped with moz cheese, microwaved it and it turned out very good.  Definitely a keeper, thanks LaDonna.

This recipe was pretty good.  I found the meat kinda bland though so I added some worcestershire sauce, some ketchup, lots of pepper, and some salt.  I also omitted mushrooms because I didn't have any.  The over-all taste was good though, so thanks.

I'm giving this the highest rating because my picky two year old asked for seconds.  That was a first!  Actually it was very good.  The only thing I did different was season the meat with a little garlic salt and added a small can of tomato sauce to the meat mixture.

Very good.  I added a little bit more oregeno and was very generous with some seasoned salt.  I only used a 14 ounce can of tomatoes - and there was still plenty.  Also used Colby Jack cheese - will definately make again, a big hit with the BF.  Although he did suggest using Rotini pasta next time.

I'm sorry to give this recipe such a low rating but I honestly think that is what it deserved.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added jarred pasta sauce along with italian seasoning and garlic salt.  I even used diced tomatoes that were flavored with garlic and oregano and we still thought it was incredibly bland.  I will probably make this recipe again and just completely skip the diced tomatoes using a spicy jarred spaghetti sauce instead.  I will also use sharp cheddar instead of mild.  The consistency was good it just totally lacked flavor.

I have been making this recipe for about eight months (with a few variations at times) and it still turns out excellent. I especially like it with ground turkey instead of the ground beef.  I use 1/2 cup of water with the cream of mushroom soup and spread half on each layer, as someone else had suggested. I usually omit the chopped green bell peppers and can mushrooms and use a jar of Ragu or Prego with mushroom and green peppers.  I still use the can of diced tomatoes... I find the extra sauce gives it a nicer consistency.  This is a wonderful recipe and my husband can't get enough of it.  We just took a pan over to my brother-in-law's house in August after the birth of their daughter and it was a big hit!:)

Preparation for this dish was not difficult at all, although the final result was just a tad bit bland. I used 1 cup of tomatoe sauce for each layer as well. I used Campbells condensed Cream of Mushroom with Garlic Cloves instead of just regular. However, this dish was a huge success between me & my boyfriend. Extremely feeling as well. Definatly enough to last a few days, & taste better left over. I will be using this again!

This recipe has been in my family for years.  My mother used to make it on a regular basis, and I took the recipe with me when I moved out, then began to make it for friends and now for my family as well.  It tastes great and re-heats well; my only complaint is the amount of dishes you use in making it!  Kitchen clean-up after preparing this dish is lengthy, but it is worth it.  YUM!

This was pretty good, but needed something, so next time I will make more meat to layer with and possibly top it with spaghetti sauce instead of cream of mushroom soup.

We liked it.  I added salt and pepper when I cooked the meat.  Next time I'll add garlic and more water with the mushroom soup.  I used fresh oregano from my garden rather than dried.

quick and easy to prepare. I didn't use green peppers. I added a few shakes of fennel seed, a shake of orange zest, and a teeny bit less oregano no Parmesan on top. I also used cream of chicken/mushroom (Campbell's) because that's what I had on hand. My husband doesn't much care for spaghetti sauce so this was perfect, more of a pasta dish than traditional spaghetti. Definitely not bland....I plan to try it with precooked chicken chunks next. I'll be sure to post the results!

Yum yum yum! Very tasty "comfort food". I followed the lead of some previous reviewers and used canned pasta sauce in about double the amount called for, with good results.

This recipe was a little bland for my taste.  I think if I ever make it again, I'll add some more spices.

My husband and I loved this recipe. My daughter didn't like it but she could live on buttered macaroni.  I used ground turkey breast & reduced fat cheese and soup. Still tasted rich and delicous and I saved some fat and calories.

Yes,needed more sauce..combined Ladonna's and Wendy's.Both a baked tomato sauce frma jar and a can of mushroom soup for richness w/exta 1/2 can water. Added button mushrms, blk olives,2 lg. cloves garlic minces and onion. Husband loved this one! Rich & deep flavor, thick enough to cut into squares to serve w/o it falling apart.  Kudos!

Great taste, and wonderful idea!!  Next time I am going to add an extra can of soup to the first layer.  I also used a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes MIXED WITH 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce in the meat mixture.  Even after that, it still needs the second can of soup... The taste was awesome, it just needs a bit more sauce for our liking.  Oh, I pureed this for my 8 month old daughter, and she ate TWO BOWLFULS!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was really great!  I used a whole pound of spaghetti (because I couldn't 
find a 3/4 pound box) and a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes.

Very easy recipe and quite tasty too.  You can substitute ground turkey or chicken very easily for the beef for non red meat eaters without losing any flavor.  Add 2 cloves of minced garlic when sauteeing the onion and bell pepper to add extra zip.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years and everybody loves it!  I use a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes in tomato puree instead of the tomatoes specified in the recipe. I find that the tomatoes I use are sweeter than the others. This recipe is definitely a "keeper".

I used ground turkey rather than ground beef to reduce the fat.  The Cream of Mushroom soup gave it an "odd" flavor, but still good.  I took the suggestion of many others and added a can of tomato sauce and extra spices (a few cloves of garlic).  Might try again.

Loved this recipe!  Very tasty. Perfect for family potluck.  I used 8 oz. mushrooms.  Will try fresh mushrooms next time, more spices, maybe cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic.

It was a BIG hit in my house. Very easy,
used sharpe cheddar chesse and more sauce.
The boys loved it. Tasted even better the 
next day. Thanks for sharing it.

Tried this recipe and loved it.  Not only was it easy to prepare but after several days it was even better.  I did add salt and pepper to taste but other than this I made no changes.

Even though the family said it isn't as good as my normal spaghetti recipe, they thoroughly enjoyed it.  I added fresh mushrooms and chopped olives to it.  Tasted even better today for lunch!

I'm always scared to try new recipes on my husband but he really loved this one. I made it ahead of time and reheated it when he came home, it turned out great!

This is a very tasty meal--my only teeny complaint was that I found the texture to be a little bit 'gummy'.  That may be due to the different brand of pasta I used for the first time.  I used a combination of mozzarella and medium cheddar cheeses and threw in about half a cup of sliced black olives.  It only took two meals for just my husband and I to finish off the whole thing--delicious!

My husband and I loved this dish! It is great when you have all the stuff for speghetti, but want something with a little variety. Goes great with garlic breadsticks.

This was such a fun, new and easy way to prepare a simple pasta dish.  My college-age son thought it must have taken hours to prepare! This is probably the first time a "new" recipe was liked by everyone in the house.

I thought this was very good.  I added some garlic salt and I used diced italian style tomatoes to give it more flavor.

This recipe is really, really good.  I have made it twice in two weeks.  My husband raves about it!  I recommend serving with a salad and warm garlic bread.
