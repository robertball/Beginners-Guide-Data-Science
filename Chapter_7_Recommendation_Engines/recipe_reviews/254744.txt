We have been buying more zucchini lately, so I've been looking for more recipes that include it. I absolutely love this recipe the zucchini gives it a really light flavor, compared to other energy ball recipes that were always too thick. I would definitely make again!!!

These are good, but neither of my kids liked them. I used peanut butter in place of almond butter and regular instead of mini chocolate chips. I think coconut would be a great addition or good in place of the chips.

Delicious! My 5 year old daughter and I made these together. She preferred them without the zucchini, which we added last. We added a tablespoon of  cocoa powder, which made it even more yummy! We also tried some with shreddded coconut, also tasty!
