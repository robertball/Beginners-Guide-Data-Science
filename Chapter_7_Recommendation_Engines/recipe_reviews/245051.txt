Because I was the first one to try this recipe, I made it exactly as written, including not doing a water bath which is what I normally do when baking a cheesecake.  This cake cracked, so I recommend doing a water bath.  Also, I did not toast the pecans as is my norm, so for the ultimate pecan flavor I would toast the pecans, just be sure they are cooled before you add them to the mixture.  The sour cream gives it a tangy flavor which my husband loved.  It is a nice, creamy dessert.

This was outstanding! 
I did make some modifications. I doubled the crust recipe and saved half of it for the top. I used brown sugar instead of white for both the crust and the cake. I used closer to two cups of pecans (because pecans are yummy!) in the cake. Once it cooled, I added a sour cream topping (1 cup sour cream mixed with 1/2 cup powdered sugar and a tsp vanilla) and then spread the remaining crust over the top. It tuned out wonderful!

I added 1 cup of sugar to the filling instead of 1/2 cup. I've never added sour cream to a cheesecake before but it was a nice touch. Although the cheesecake filling was really good, I found myself picking out the pecans. The pecans in the pie crust was amazing, I just wasn't too fond of them in the filling like I thought I would be. I will make the crust and cheesecake again just without the pecans in the filling. Oh, and the water bath is really needed for this recipe. My whole family loved this cheesecake so it could just be my tastebuds.

First time in a long time cooking from a recipe! I used soft brown sugar instead of white, and added a little extra to cut through the sour cream taste as recommended by previous reviews. I only used maybe ten pecans broken up in the creamy part. It turned out fantastic and the taste is devine. Going to add a little pecan brittle to the top when serving.

The pecans got soft and almost slimy inside, which ruined it. I also thought it had too much sour cream and was too tangy.

This is a terrific cheesecake. I used the suggestions of brown sugar replacing white...and doubling the crust and doing the sour cream sugar topping.
I do not do a water bath for my cheesecakes..... I have found that if I put a pan with about an inch of water on the shelf under the cheesecake while baking it does not split. I can't remember where I learned this but it does work for me and is much easier than a water bath.

I used a few recommendations from other reviewers, I used brown sugar instead of white, I doubled the pecans for the cake (almost, used about 1 3/4cups) I doubled the crust to use half as a topping & I made the Sour Cream/Powdered Sugar/Vanilla mix for a frosting under the "crust" topping. I wrapped the springform pan with foil and placed in a water bath (first time to use a water bath. I had to Google the instructions) The cake turned out EXCELLENT and was a big hit with the family! Even my sister who is not a cheesecake fan loved it!

It was easy to make and I was looking for something that wasn't too sweet, too rich, or too heavy.  This definitely fit the bill but I did find it a bit on the bland side.  I did add a drizzle of caramel and chocolate sauces to it to give it a bit more pizazz.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving dinner and it was amazing. I followed the directions to the letter and it came out beautifully.  Did not sink in the middle like some cheesecakes tend to do and there wasn't one crack in it.  The top was perfectly level.  My stove has regular bake or convection bake and I used the convection bake.  I recommend this recipe to everyone.  It was beautiful and scrumptious!

Very good.  I used 1.5 times the crust recipe and about 1.3 times the amount of toasted pecans.  It was lighter than my normal cheesecake and less sweet tasting.

Definitely will make again I made the slight changes that many people suggested. I toasted the pecans before chopping them up and used more. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I topped it off with a caramel drizzle and a cinnamon whipped cream. I also used a water bath .. again so yummy!

I made it exactly as stated!  After my first bite I thought it was a little tangy, as my usual recipe for New York Cheesecake (Chantal's recipe from Allrecipes) is sweeter and doesn't use as much sour cream.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the 2nd bite and how well it paired with the sugar in the crust! Texture was perfect!  Will definitely make again.  I also added a drizzle of caramel topping!

I made this cheesecake 2 days ago.  I toasted the pecans before adding them into the recipe.  Neither my husband or myself liked it.  It wasnâ€™t creamy or sweet.  I think it may have been too much sour cream.  Itâ€™s in the trash.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. The pecans  gave it a bitter flavor. Maybe by cutting back on the amount of  chopped pecans would  be the answer.

Made it exactly as per the recipe! I took a chance and even used, what seemed to me as, the crazy baking method. It turned out wonderfully and was such a big hit with guests, that I almost didn't get a piece! Flavour, texture, everything, utterly fantastic and I would make it again in a heartbeat!!

I make cheesecakes often and my family said that this is the best one EVER! I subbed plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and I toasted the pecans for a few minutes.  I also made the crust with pecan sandies and butter (I omitted the sugar). The cheesecake was smooth, creamy, and cooked with no cracks (thanks to the cooking method on the recipe and a water bath that I always use). A GREAT cheesecake. Thanks for the share

It turned out really well. I did use a water bath to be safe. Sour cream topping (SC, sugar and vanilla) with extra crust crumbled on top as was suggested in another review. My family did request that I make caramel sauce to drizzle on next time.

This baked up nice and light and fluffy.  It tastes a lot like sour cream, but that is to be expected with a sour cream cheesecake recipe.  When I make it next time, I think I'll use butter flavored extract instead of vanilla and toast the pecans.

Great flavor, but I would have preferred crunchier nuts.  Also, I had never used a springform pan before, and no instructions were given regarding its preparation/use.

Followed the recipe except I did toast the pecans. I also think it could use a little more sugar/sweetness as I found the flavor rather bland. I didn't use a water bath and it baked perfectly. Not sure, but if you add more sugar, that might affect the bake.
