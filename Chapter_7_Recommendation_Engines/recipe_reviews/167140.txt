I used fresh whip cream instead of the cool whip. I found the pie easy to prepare and a refreshing dessert for the summer, just a tad bit boring though...

Good recipe. The picture doesn't match it though; there should be a layer of pudding underneath the raspberries along with the pudding-whipped cream mix on top of them. I used "Lite" whipped cream and you would not know the difference.
