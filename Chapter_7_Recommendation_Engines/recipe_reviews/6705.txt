Nothing special, just a sweet bread that takes time to make (chop nuts, chop cherries, etc) even using a food processor.

Great bread.  I used less nuts.  I used fat free eggs.  I used some apple sauce in lieu of butter.

This recipe is great.  One thing I would suggest is that you cook it in a metal pan and stay away from glass for an even texture all the way through.

I made this bread over Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I thought the recipe was quite simple and it stayed quite moist.  Try it for something a little different and sweet.

Between my imagination and some reviewers’ comments, I figured if this was prepared as written with a full jar of maraschino cherries it would be very sweet; too sweet for me. Dried cherries, on the other hand, sounded like an appealing alternative. I plumped the cherries in boiling water for about 15 minutes and I liked how that turned out.  The bread rose well and came out nicely rounded.  It was moist and certainly not short on either cherries or nuts.  But it kind of reminded me of what a golf teacher remarked to me many years ago.  “Your swing is beautiful,” he said.  “I can’t figure out why you’re not hitting the ball.”  Similarly, in this case, everything was right.  I just can’t figure out why it was so lacking in flavor.  It was more nutty tasting than anything else, the batter itself fairly tasteless.  A little cinnamon maybe, or some almond extract would probably help. So…yawn.  Three stars.  And had I made it with the full jar of maraschino cherries?  Too sweet.  Too maraschino cherry-y.  Still three stars.

This is a great bread recipe.  I did have to make one small alteration as i did not have buttermilk on hand.  I soured milk by using vinegar and it worked just as good as the buttermilk.  I think next time i would add even more cherries as my family loves them. I did nopt chop the cherries into small pieces but just halved them instead. Made for nice chunks of fruit, and looked very pretty.  Oh yeah, i had to cook this for almost 70 minutes and it was a large sized loaf.  Still came out very moist.  Great recipe!!

This recipe was good, but didn't think to flour the cut up cherries, and they all sank to the bottom.  I omitted the pecans because 2 family members don't like nuts.  We had tried cherry bread at Bob Evans, and that was awesome, so I was trying to find something close.  This was good, but not awesome.

I didn't have a full jar of mar. cherries, and I had 3 really brown bananas so I added the bananas to the mix. Also did 1/2 tsp. almond ex. and 1/2 vanilla. I ground everything up really small in my magic bullet (cherries and pecans) so my picky 8yo would eat it. It was like a Christmas bread, I thought. I guess the cherries in it made me think of the holidays! Anyway, it was really yummy & thanks for the post, we enjoyed!

This bread is packed with pecans and they are the predominant flavor.  I was hoping to taste more cherry, but it was subtle.  I used sour cherries from my tree and also used half vanilla extract and half almond extract to try and have a strong cherry flavor.  Next time I will decrease the amount of nuts and increase the cherries for my liking.  UPDATE:  I defrosted 3 cups of cherries, used 1/2 cup of pecans and subbed almond extract for vanilla.  That is how I will continue to make this recipe.

I made this bread especially for my fiance and he loved it, said it was better than he remembered as a child.  He had me use almonds instead of pecans.  My loaf pan was too small so with the leftover batter I was able to make 6 donuts. I have a donut pan that bakes the donuts instead of frying them.  I made up a frosting of powdered sugar, butter, milk, almond extract and a little leftover cherry juice and they too were awesome! Thank you so much, its a keeper!

I used fresh cherries because I had some that needed to be used. I was a little dissappointed with the lack of flavor in the recipe. I added a little almond extract, but it was still lacking. I probably won't make it again.

This is the best cherry bread I have ever had. Everyone loved it, I even made care packages for Christmas with the bread and cherry butter and everyone raved. Very, very good. I changed the pecans to slivered almonds. I have been asked to make it for next Christmas and I have even been asked to make it just for a morning treat. Great!!!!!!!! Thanks Nick!

I usually make Cranberry Walnut bread, but saw this and thought I'd give it a try.  It is wonderful.  My family loved it.  Sweet, but not too much.  Perfect texture.  It will become a holiday tradition.  Thank you for sharing!

I liked this bread. The pecans added extra flavor. I used almond extract instead of vanilla and butter instead of margarine. After I halved my cherries, I rolled them in flour to prevent them from settling to the bottom. It didn't work. This made enough batter to exceed my loaf pan, so I made 4 muffins (which became hard after an hour). Next time, I will make all muffins for half the baking time.

I thought this bread would be sweeter with a stronger cherry flavor but it simply tastes like nut bread. I will try making it again but I will add some cherry extract.

If you like banana but bread you'll like this recipe. I didn't have pecans, merichino cherries or buttermilk. I used chopped almonds. Then scooped cherries out of a whole can of pie filling. I used one tbsp of white vinegar mixed with a cup of milk to replace buttermilk. I mixed the sugar in slowly with softened butter. I also added 4 tbsp flour to ensure it wasn't too thin. It had the consistency of cake batter. Making this again.. Very good!!

Read comments and added 1 teas almond extract and 3/4 teas cinnamon. Good flavor. nice addition to my quick bread platters that I take for treats for coworkers. The red cherry color adds to presentation.

If you like sweet homemade breads with a little pazaz this is the recipe for that.  The Cherries give it an extra twang.

Resembles fruit cake in a way.  It's very moist and chock full of cherries and nuts.  The only problem I had with it was that it got really brown around the edges but I couldn't take it out of the oven earlier because it needed the whole 55 minutes to be done in the middle...I used polish stoneware; maybe a different bread pan would be better.

*EDIT* Also was going to add some coconut, but forgot. Very good bread. I added some lemon zest, didn't have buttermilk, so I soured milk using juice from 1/2 a lemon and letting it set for 10 mins. Also didn't use bread pan, instead used mini pans, some that are teddy bears and others that are mini bundt pans. Made 7 mini breads, that I will add to my gift baskets for Christmas. Very good bread, moist and tastey! Recipe is a keeper, everyone loves it.

This recipe is a keeper!  It was very moist and tasty. I used sliced almonds instead of pecans and it turned out great.  Next time I might experiment and add some almond extract to give it a little more flavor.  Also, I didn't add a glaze on top but that would really be great too.  Thanks!

Very nice bread. I didnot have cherries so I used fresh blueberries. I reduced the amount of nuts by half and replaced the other half with white chocolate chips.
