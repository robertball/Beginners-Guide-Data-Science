Great recipe! We like things spicy so I added a little extra crushed red pepper.  Served it to guests along with grilled veggies and rice.  (We bought an extra pkg of marinade for our veggies so the flavors would tie in nicely.) The meal looked like we spent a lot of time on it, but didn't.  Will definately make again and again.

Though this is a McCormick(r) submitted recipe, we tried it with a different Caribbean spice, more garlic, and a lemon "Pam" spray before grilling.   We also added Mango to the salsa recipe........ GREAT

Mixed review from two opposite tastes: husband thought it was too spicy. I thought it was perfect. If you like spicy and sweet, you will like this. The cool pineapple salsa offsets the heat of the marinade. If you like it less spicy, you can omit the red pepper flakes, as they do add more kick. It really has a nice tropical flavor.

This was really tasty. I was unable to find this Grill mates mix in my local markets, so I had to improvise with marinade ingredients. I let this sit in the marinade overnite and then grilled on my George Foreman grill. This tasted very good with the salsa. I'll keep looking for the grill mix, but I'll make it again my way if I can't find it.

Very good grilled chicken! It is spicy but as others have mentioned, the pineapple salsa really cools this off and the blend of the two different flavors is wonderful! It looked and tasted tropical and exotic. I marinated for 4 hours and used diced pineapple...but really, didn't change a thing and wouldn't in the future. This would be great dining for two on your patio in the summer...hmmm, I can't wait! Thanks McCormick!

Big hit even with my picky eater!! We served over rice and to make more kid friendly we grilled pinapple slices and put over the rice with chicken over it instead of the red onion. They loved it. Very filling though.

Like others, I couldn't find the seasoning packet for making the marinade, so I used A1 Jamaican Jerk marinade instead. It was pretty good but I'm sure not quite as good as the recipe as it's meant to be. Pineapple was a great flavor. I'll add extra for more sweetness next time. After pouring the salsa over the chicken, I put a few small wedges of fresh pineapple on top. Came out super pretty and yummy!

This was delicious! I couldn't find the Caribbean marinade so I used the Mexican marinade instead. I made it for my hubby, who owns a gourmet restaurant, who does not like chicken, and HE loved it.  So that's saying a lot.  I used only two chicken breast pounded to 1/3 inch so there was a lot of salsa.  However, there was none left at the end of the meal.  This one is definetely a "keeper" and such a low fat, healthy meal!  I can't wait to make it at my next BBQ. FIVE BIG STARS!

I made this recipe along with the Marinated Grilled Shrimp from this site for the men in my family (Dad, brother, and my honey) to take with them on a deep sea fishing trip. Everyone came back raving about it. Some of the other guys on the boat (who had grinders) even ended up eating it and ditching the grinders! I had to tell my boyfriend that I'd made it multiple times. He kept insisting I'd gotten it from some gourmet place around the way. It's become a regular at my home and guarantees that we'll have company for dinner.

I couldn't find the Grill Mates Spicy Caribbean Marinade either, so I looked online for the ingredients, and added a little cinnamon to the equivalent amount of McCormick Caribbean Jerk Seasoning. I have no idea if it tasted like it should, but we absolutely loved this nonetheless! The salsa is awesome too, and compliments the chicken so well. I made this on the Foreman grill contraption, and it couldn't have turned out better. Thanks!

I can't find the Caribbean Marinade anywhere.  I looked in the Grill Mates section and the seasoning/spices section.  Anyone else having trouble?

Excellent recipie!  Each time I prepare this dish I get rave reviews.  As a hint, I've started adding a little lime juice to the marinade to reduce the spiciness just a little.  Made it more "kid friendly".

This recipe is very easy to prepare and delicious. I couldn't find the Spicy Caribbean Marinade in my store; so I used the store brand already made Caribbean Marinade. That's the only change I made.

THIS RECIPE IS SOOO GOOD! I would give it 10 stars if possible! I've used McCormick's Caribbean marinade as well as other Caribbean marinade - both worked perfect! I added add'l lime juice to chicken while grilling. SOOO good!

This was really good and a nice change of flavor for dinner. There aren't so many recipes like this in my collection. So much flavor just plain rice was all the side it could handle, anything from a box with a flavor would have been overwhelming.

This was fabulous.  I couldn't find the McCormick spice mix so in a pinch I just substituted Lawry's Caribbean Jerk marinade and left the chicken breasts in it all day.   

The salsa was wonderful.  I didn't change a thing.   I did make Basmati rice and after it was cooked I added 1/4 cup fresh lime juice, and some salt.

Totally delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

I couldn't find the carribean seasoning, so I used the Baja Citrus like another reviewer recommended...it was ok.  I love Paul Newman's pineapple salsa, so that's what I had in mind when I thought of pineapple salsa, but this is much different.  I'm not a cilantro fan, but I gave it a shot since I have recently come to love many foods that I once thought I hated--but cilantro is just not one of those foods for me.  I'll go with parsley next time.  Prolly even toss in a can of diced tomatoes.  My boyfriend loved it, I thought it was just ok.  Nothing special.

Family loved it, I doubled everything (large family) I also included red and yellow bell peppers. 1 and 1/2 cans of chunk pineapple.  I too could not find the Caribbean marinade packet.  I used Durkee Jamaican Jerk spice in the same way.  It turned out wonderfully.
I also used brown/wild rice for an extra texture.  Very good recipe, light.

The only change I made to the salsa was using sweet vidalia onions rather than red, to suit my taste.  Turned out great!  Thanks, this is a simple and delicious topping for chicken.

My husband gave it a "pretty good" and stated he would want it again.  I enjoyed it, but the salsa needs something--maybe some mango?

I like to think i'm a decent cook, but when we served this at a dinner party nobody was all that fond of it. The flavors didn't jive quite as well as I'd expected after all of the rave reviews.

This dish was WAY to spicy for us.  It is a really good idea, but the spices for the chicken turned out to be too much for my family.  The pineapple salsa was excellent, and I will surely use the recipe for that again.  The chicken, for us, needs a little work.

For the most part this was fabulous!  I didn't have the carribean spice packet by mccormick either, i think it must be out of production but mccormick does make an actual carribean spice that i found with the spices at my store.  It worked just fine!  The chkn was moist and tender and very flavorful.  I made a few changes to the pineapple salsa, adding more pineapple.  It made the taste last longer.  Our guests loved it, and it will most likely become a regular at my house!  Good Luck,enjoy the meal!

OMG...I woke up this morning in the cooking mood and decided to make this.  It was so easy!!!  My husband loved it.  I'm not a big fan of cilantro so I subbed a little basil instead.  Wonderful!!  I paired it with the twice baked potato recipe from this site.  Can't beat it.  Definitely a keeper

Very good, my only complaint is that it is a tad salty because of using a spice packet.  Will make again.

Most of the party ***** 1-2 people ****  mainly because it is a little hot (spicey). I don't think it was hot at all but all agreed it you have iced tea it will put out the fire easily :)  BTW salsa is great idea we made two versions one with red peppers and one without. equally great

My husband and I went on a Caribbean cruise for our honeymoon and hosted a themed party when we returned to show our pictures. Everyone raved about this recipe, and the extra pineapple salsa was gobbled up on tortilla chips!

I was really impressed with this.  I made this for my husband the night before we left for our honeymoon.  The salsa was the best!  It sounds like a strange combination, but was nice and cool with the spicey-ness of the chicken.  Definitely a repeat recipe...

Didn't try the chicken (not a big fan of paying for too much for spice packages when I have all the stuff that's in them in my pantry) . . . but the pineapple salsa is REALLY GOOD.  We had it with Jay's Jerked Chicken.

I used the Salsa part of this recipe for a side dish to go with another recipe I have for Caribbean Jerk Chicken, for a party of 100.  Lots of compliments and people asking for the recipe.

EXCELLENT. next time i will split the salsa and make one with fewer onions for the kids. also, i did a few of the chicken breasts with far less marinade. the kick in this recipe is too much for my little ones.

Most excellent! I served the entire dinner over a bed of brown rice, which soaked up the juice of the salsa. I highly recommend this recipe.  Takes a little time to do the salsa, think about preparing it ahead of time--even the night before.

This was good but not great....Could NOT find the seasoning anywhere and am still looking a few weeks later...Made my own blend after searching the net for something similar.  We liked it but the leftovers just didn't make the grade.  My husband who usually takes everything to work the next day, left it.  Oh, I might try it again but only if I can find the seasoning mix.  The onions were yummy and made it look terrific!

We loved this receipe.  We also could not find the marinade mix so we used the lawerys Caribbean marinades and touched it up a bit.  It was wonderful.  The salsa was to die for.  My kids loved this reipe also.  It is very colorful.  A great entertaingin meal if your guests like different and spicy.  Yum!

The pineapple salsa was delicious in this recipe.  The sweet flavor of the fruit mixed with the cilantro and red peppers was delicious!  However, I wasn't that impressed with the flavor of the chicken.  I didn't really care for the marinade, but my boyfriend really liked it.  Next time I will probably put together my own marinade instead of using the McCormick one.

Very forgiving recipe - I cooked the chicken in a skillet and finished on broil in the oven.  Received many requests for the recipe.  Good for adults; salsa too much for kids.
