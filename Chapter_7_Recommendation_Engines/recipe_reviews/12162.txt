I give this 5 stars for the taste, loved it, though it could come off as cloying to some. However, this pie was pretty hard for me to make. The yolk mixture was too thick to be in a ribbon stage and my custard didn't thicken much, and it was quite foamy. Mine was done baking after 20 minutes, but I had to drain a lot of fluid out that had gathered between the custard and meringue. But I would definitely suggest this recipe, it is interesting and very sweet :) Don't be deterred by the raisins!
