Sorry, but we didn't care for this. I did like that it was very easy and came together quickly with items that I usually have in my pantry. It's a great base recipe, but it definitely needs some seasonings as it was quite bland - in the very least, some salt and pepper. Garlic would also add a nice touch. Thankfully I had made some gravy, so it added some flavor to the dish.  The oatmeal flavor was quite prominent (not in a good way), so I would suggest cutting it back to 3/4 cup. For one pound of meat, 1.5 cups of oats is a lot, but I wanted to follow the recipe as written.  This could be a four to five star recipe with some tweaks. It's very moist! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband says this is the best meatloaf I've ever made.  It really does taste great the second day too.  I had a slice for lunch the next day in a salad with green leaf lettuce, shredded carrots, diced tomato, and thousand island dressing.  It was delicious.  And so easy!  I used quick cooking oats and egg beaters.  The mixture was very watery, but the oatmeal soaked it all up in the baking process.

After reading the other reviews with complaints of dryness and lack of flavor I made this meatloaf following the recipe but added 1 tsp garlic salt and an 8oz can of tomato sauce and baked one hour . PERFECT !!

I give this 4 stars because it's a nice, EASY base recipe.  I never make meatloaf but wanted a new ground beef recipe, so with a few tweaks, I think this came out pretty good!  I reduced the oats to 3/4 cup like other reviewers said, and I omitted the French onion soup mix (to reduce the sodium content, and well, because I don't own that!).  Then I added several dashes of pepper, garlic salt, and garlic, and sprinkled in a few teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce.  The first time I made this, I added cayenne pepper for some spice, but it turned out way too spicy, so I left it out the second time.  Also, the first time I baked it for the 1 hour, and it came out WAY dry (not sure if it was my oven or the fact I used a dark pan).  I baked for 45 minutes instead this time around, and it was perfect!  Like I said, good, easy base recipe!

I didn't have French Onion Soup and would have been willing to try it to moisten the meatloaf but I have always used Lipton Soup Mix with eggs and milk to moisten.  The reason I was looking at this recipe at all was because I wanted to make meatloaf but was out of breadcrumbs and needed a substitute.  I tried the oatmeal in the lesser amount that was suggested by other reviewers with my regular recipe plus I add about 1/4C ketchup to the mix as well.  They I take about 3/4 C ketchup 4 T of brown sugar and a splash or two of Worchestershire sauce and mix for the topping.  I put this on about 15 minutes before taking the meatloaf out and I cook at 350 so it doesn't dry out.  My kids and their friends (who don't like meatloaf) rave about it and the oatmeal was a great substitute.

We will try it again but it needs !!!! more seasoning. Next time I will add chopped onion, garlic etc. to give it more flavor.  The texture was fine. It's bland the way it is right now

This was easy and I used 3/4 cup of oats like one reviewer suggested and that was just right. But added seasonings, just too bland as is. Garlic powder, black pepper, salt and some chili powder added a perfect blend. Used top ground sirloin and it baked for an hour. will make again.

Added 1 lb ground turkey to 1 1/3 lb ground beef, changed oats with wheat germ, substituted onion soup with bar-b-cue rub and added two tablespoons of salsa. Cooked in a 12”X 7” cooking pan and glazed with a mixture of catsup and brown sugar in the last 20 minutes. Cut cooking time by 20 minutes.

Finally! A meatloaf recipe like my mom used to make. No ketchup or tomato sauce. Just yummy beef and onion flavor. And not too "watery". Thank you.

It was way to dry. I added assorted seasonings. So it tasted good but was dry as a brick. Will not make again.

This was most likely my lack of cooking abiltiy. The liquid made this very soupy. I double and triple checked the amounts, 1 pound of hamburger and a whole can of french onion soup. Wonder what I did wrong...
