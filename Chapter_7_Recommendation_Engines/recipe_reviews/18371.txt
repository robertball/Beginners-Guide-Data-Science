This was so easy to fix, and my husband and I thought the scallops were just great!  Every mouthful seemed to get better! And the juices jazzed up our rice.  Kid rating: one kid wouldn't eat scallops no matter what you did to them and the other kid liked these just fine. Really, though, the scallop dinner was for the adults anyway.

WONDERFUL!  I did add a little something!   diped the scallops in breadcrumbs than prepared as directed.  Excellant.  I served with Baked Zucchinni with Lemon Pepper also on this site.  Great way to use up the Lemmon Pepper!

Excellent dish!  And totally lowfat with only 3 grams of fat.  I used the leftover scallops in a pasta dish with diced tomatoes, olives, chopped spinach and a little olive oil.  It was delicious the 2nd time around too!

I thought this was great. My boyfriend was iffy on it, but said it was okay.
Dad, who is the "number one" scallop fan of my household, loved it.

This recipe was nice and light.  After baking the scallops for a few minutes, I drained them.  Then I added the ingredients.  As some of the reviewers found it to be too lemony, I used regular salt and pepper instead of lemon pepper and squeezed in a little less lemon juice.

Pretty good recipe. It was somthing different as far as scallops go. I had to add white wine to cut down on the lemon taste.I will use again in the future.

this was a quick, easy, and very tasty dish - my husband and I enjoyed it very much.  I used frozen scallops, and I found the cooking times to be perfect. I served white rice and caesar salad with the scallops. I will definitely make this again!

I enjoyed this recipe and it's QUICK AND EASY, just the way I like it.  I would suggest only using sea scallops, never bay. If you like a little extra zest, use roasted garlic.

These were delicious. I used sea scallops and expected my cooking time to be longer. I ended up increasing the oven temperature to 425 and that worked well. I'm not sure what one reviewer means that 2 TBSP of lemon pepper is way too much - the recipe calls for "lemon pepper to taste". The flavor of the finished dish is delicate - but these are scallops. I used Meyer Lemons for my juice as that was all I had on hand. I will definitely make these again. Thanks, Ambor!

I wanted a scallop recipe that is super diet conscious (no breading, butter, wine, etc), and this was absolutely perfect.  I used about 10 sea scallops.  In addition to the lemon juice and fresh garlic, I added some Italian seasoning to it.  And because I am into sprinking everything with a touch of vinegar right now with my diet, I decided to add a little bit to the small casserole dish rather than butter or canola spray.  I will make this often -- my husband and I both loved it, and it cannot get any easier to prepare.  Highly recommended.  P.S.  I think this would work well with extra large shrimp as well, but with less cooking time.

Although I love lemon pepper and use it in many recipes, 2 Tbl is a bit overpowering for the delicate tast of scallops.  Further, whenever I've seen or ordered "Angels on Horseback" when dining out, they are scallops wrapped in bacon, lightly seasoned and sometimes served with a side of bernaise sauce.
this recipe should be relabeled "garlic/lemon scallops".

I found this recipe a nice change from the often heavier recipes that use scallops.  My husband thought it was a bit "too lemony" and next time I will substitute white wine for the lemon juice.  I served it with wild rice and peas.

This was okay. I loved how healthy it was, but it was very lemony and not much else. I think maybe they would be better with some panko breadcrumbs. Some wasabi mayo helped add some flavor. I also wasn't sure what to serve with it.

I made these, omiiting the additional lemon pepper and replacing with salt and pepper (per the other reviews). I used sea scallops, had to increase my cooking time. The end result were bland, bitter scallops.

I did not like this recipe due to its sharp lemon taste which was overwhelming. I would cut down on the lemon juice significantly.

I found this recipe tasteless and unappealing. I wouldn't choose to make it again. Instead I reccommend a buerre blanc sauce which truly compliments the scallops, although it is higher in calories.

I found I did not need 2 tablespoons of lemon pepper- slightly over 1 tbsp gave enough kick. This is SO easy and fast to prepare. Also ,the fat content is neglible- a change from my other scallop recipes with butter and cream. My husband liked this- usually he finds scallops bland.

This a great recipe. I did dip them in bread crumbs, the second time I tried this and continued with the recipe. Both the kids really enjoyed them as much as I.

Very very good simple scallop recipe.  I halved it and served with brown rice and broccoli.  I didn't find the sauce overpowering and even enjoyed it drizzled on the broccoli.
