This was a very good recipe.  The only thing I recommend is to first cook the mushrooms and onions in the butter for a while.  Then add the rest of the ingredients.  We found we liked it this way a lot more.

I cannot see at all why this recipe is rated so highly. It turned out to be a flavorless flour-based gravy instead of a mushroom sauce. It was way too thick--I ended up using 50% more stock than what it called for. 

I also carmelized some shallots instead of green onions, and I cooked both the shallots and the mushrooms in butter before, as the previous folks have said.

To give it more flavor, I added a 1/2 cup of red wine, 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar, and a couple of tablespoons of Dijon mustard. Oh, and salt and pepper. (It didn't even call for salt and pepper!) I also used some shitake mushrooms instead of all whitecaps; thank goodness I did--I can't imagine how it would have tasted without them.

Next time I'll cook the four and a bit of the butter together to make a roux, so there won't be so many lumps in the sauce, too.

I really think it was inedible, the way the directions have it here (and I'll eat just about anything), but with my modifications it ended up being tasty--like a stroganoff. Without the modifications it would have been a tasteless, white, lumpy paste.

Excellent topper for grilled pork chops!!  I too sauteed the onions in the butter first, then added the shrooms for a minute or so, then added the other ingredients.  MMMM-MMM GOOD.  Thanks Sara!

Very easy and good.  I used sliced white onion instead of green, and chicken broth instead of beef, based on what I had last minute.  It went very well with baked chicken and pasta.  Thank you for a good simple recipe.

This is a super simple good basic recipe.  Since it is not a gourmet recipe, it should not be reviewed as such.  In keeping with the super simple & easy theme, I used canned mushrooms & onion flakes.  I needed something quick (from the pantry) for a beef dinner.  It turned out great for my quick dinner!  I will make it again.

Very good!  I also cooked the mushrooms first (and added some garlic and salt) then added everything else.

I thought this was too floury. It definately needs salt and pepper and unless you like your sauce extremely thick you may want to thin it down alittle with some extra broth.

I made this last night for the first time for company.  I don't like mushrooms so I didn't taste it, but everyone else really enjoyed it, particularly my husband.  I used veggie broth as another reviewer suggested since I was serving it with a chicken dish.  I also had some leftover white wine that I used in place of some of the broth.  The sauce came out much thicker than I thought it would, but it was still a very nice sauce.  I used the entire 1 pound container of mushrooms chopped in a relatively large dice.  I also used 4 or 5 green onions (didn't measure those).  I made the sauce in advance and then reheated it, adding more veggie broth as it heated to try to thin it out a bit more.  It never got very thin, but it was a nice consistency.  My husband suggested that it would be a great mushroom soup.  There are some leftovers that I'm going to play with tonight, maybe adding some sour cream or heavy cream or milk to try to make it more like soup.  I would definitely make this again.  It's extremely easy and dummy-proof for those of us slightly intimidated by making a sauce.  I can see a lot of variation possibilities with this recipe, and I plan on trying some of them.

Very good. I agree with other reviewers that it was heavy on the butter, so I'll probably cut back next time. I sauteed the mushrooms and onions first, then pureed 1/2 the mixture with the broth (I used vegetable) in the blender and returned it to the pan. Made a nice creamy sauce. Thanks!

I loved this!  So did my 6 yr. old!  I used the idea of cooking the 'shrooms and onions first in the butter (I used a lite margerine).  I also used a few dashes of red wine vinegar!  Yummy!

This is easy, and tasty.  I made it ahead of time for dinner and put it in the crockette.  I thickened it a little more with some cornstarch to serve over bacon swiss burgers.

After reading all the reviews I decided to modify the recipe. I first carmelized the onions and mushrooms along with 2 cloves minced garlic in butter, then added chicken broth instead of beef broth, about a 1/4 cup white wine and salt and pepper. In the end, I thickened with cornstarch instead of flour (based on other reviews, I don't like a floury taste). Turned out great! Served over baked chicken.

I first melted the broth and butter. Then gradually wisked in the flour. Then stirred in the mushrooms and green onions. The gravy comes out very thick. I added water to thin it out. Next time I will only use 1/4 cup of flour. I will now make this gravy ofen. It has lots of mushroom flavor.

I made it with chicken and linguine and this sauce was great.  I added garlic (because I love garlic) and some white pepper for added flavor.

I sauteed the mushrooms in the butter and then browned the flour, before adding to the broth.  I used chicken broth and added a few drops of worchestershire sauce... very nice!

It was very bland as is. I still gave it 3 stars because it's a handy base if you want an easy gravy. I didn't throw it all together at once, so I'm not sure if the consistency would work out okay that way or not. It's still pretty easy though with some of the recommended modifications. I think next time I'll use a yellow onion or shallots instead of green for more flavor. I thought the ratios of butter/flour/broth were perfect as is.

The directions are pretty vague, so I also cooked the mushroom and onion a little first in half of the butter, removed them and then cooked the flour and remaining butter then stirred in the all ingredients. Mine came out great!

really good.. i prepared it differently though. first fried the mushrooms, dumped them out of the pan, cooked the flour and butter together until it was combined, added the stock, stirred like crazy, then added the mushrooms again and heated for a few minutes. added quite a bit of salt and pepper as well. put it on top of wiener schnitzel and mashed potatoes and it was delicious!

I made the mistake of dumping the full 1/2 cup of flour into the broth, and it got all clumpy.  My fault...but other than that it was good.  I would prefer more spicing.  May be thyme or oregano?

I thought it was good, but a tad on the bland side.  (A few dashes of Worchestershire helped perk it up a lot.)  I also suggest cutting back on the flour so it isn't quite as pastey.  But it is easy for sure.

This was very good! Cut the recipe in half, but did not deviate away from the ingredients. We poured the sauce over two baked potatoes and we ate it all. Very tasty, quick and easy.

Fabulous.  I fried pork chops in the pan 1st and then added the butter onions and mushrooms and scraped all of the bits off the bottom of the pan.  When the onions were tender I added the flour and cooked that for a couple of minutes before slowly adding the broth.

This was good , but a little too thick.me   Think next time I'll add a little more beef broth or some  red wine. My husband thought it was great as is.  Needs a little salt and pepper, but thanks  for a great, easy recipe.

Like another reviewer I changed the servings to 8 so that I needed only a 8oz package of mushrooms.  I diced them as suggested and sauteed them in the sauce pot with the green onions in the butter first to soften them and then added one can of beef broth.  Once the broth started to boil I added the amount of Wondra (not regular flour)suggested, a little at a time, continuously stirring. I added just a few dashes of salt and pepper.  The sauce turned out DELICIOUS!  The ONLY thing I'd do differently next time is to either cut the mushrooms smaller (maybe use the food processor) OR cook them even softer before adding the broth.  Nevertheless the taste was great and this was a super-easy sauce which tasted like I had cooked it for hours!  YAY.

I agree with KLCROOKS. This is not a good recipe. It was a bland, pasty goo of flour that became only tolerable when a fair amount of wine, salt, pepper, and thyme was added. It is easy, but it is not good.

First try at mushroom sauce/gravy, and this was a piece of cake! For ease, I changed the servings to 8... used an 8 oz. pkg mushrooms, and 1 can beef broth, as well as other altered quantities. Yummy over roasted green beans (GB's tossed with a splash of olive oil, S & P, and oven roasted till shriveled and brown) and turkey!

I found this sauce very good. Easy to make and tasty. I added salt and pepper to sauce as it was cooking.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

This is the best mushroom sauce I've had, not to mention the easiest. It seems as though nothing is made from scratch, real ingredients, any longer... here is a recipe that is.

Good and easy sauce on pasta.  A little heavy on the butter, maybe adding a little white wine...

I recommend that you allow the mushrooms to simmer gently for a good 15 minutes to really get the mushroom flavour throughout. I also added a splash of my favourite Maggie seasoning. Yummy.

Added cooking sherry, which enhanced the flavor of the mushrooms, as well as cut the thickness.  Came out perfect!

I’m not sure if there is a typo but I make a lot of gravy and this as written is way too thick. I used 1/4 cup flour and 2 cups broth which was perfect. I sautéd the onions until transparent then added the mushrooms and sautéd them a bit. I set them aside and made the gravy then added the mushrooms and onions.  With the adjustment it’s a very good gravy.

After a 16 hour work day i was able to come home and bang this out in 15 minutes with ease! I topped it onto a chicken roast I had made early in the week and it just gave the roast that little extra something. I also used thyme instead of green onion.  
I would also say, keep adding water/broth slowly till you reach your desired thickness. This recipe came out very thick at first.

I thought this recipe was as delicious as it was easy to make. I tagged this so I may refer back to it for future recipes. This is so simple to make that it almost surprises you how little time was involved in making it. *****

I made this using canned mushrooms. I added 2 small cans of mushrooms with it's liquid I can of beef broth. The I added 1 tbl spoon of soy sauce 1 tbl spoon of   Worcestershire sauce 2 tbl spoons of the oil that is inside the jar of minced garlic and oil not the garlic itself.  I did add the amount of butter called for in this recipe. also I added a tbl spoon of sesame oil. I chopped fresh green onions from the garden. I then Added all the  Ingredients into a small pot and brought it to a boil. Reduced heat and allowed it to gently boil for 5-6 mins stirring occasionally I pulled it from the heat and let it rest 2 mins I drained the liquid catching it in a pot underneather my strainer. This may seem odd however I picked the green onions out and discarded them. Once everything was drained. I took the mushrooms and added them to a sauce pot on low heat. 1/2 cup of my broth to 1 teaspoon of flour until i reach my liking on thickness. This turned out extremely tasty!!!

I made this. Very simple recipe. But the thing is, 1/2 cup of flour is too much. It turned my gravy too thick. And i end ul adding 3 more cups of beef broth. Next time i will start with sauteing the mushrooms in butter. Add the green onions and then 1/4 cup of flour, melt it there. And add 2 cups of beef broth. Season with black pepper and salt.

Made this tonight with grilled pork chops and wild rice.  Hubby liked it!  I read reviews and stir fried the mushrooms and onions in the butte first.  Only used 1/3 cup flour: mixed that and the broth (low sodium) and added it to the mushrooms.  Simmered a little bit.  Hubby suggested next time adding a little wine when stir frying the mushrooms, maybe in place of some of the broth?  Will try, but I am not a wine fan, so we will see!!

This is the BEST and it is the EASIEST!!! I read the reviews first for tips... I followed the recipe with very little change, using canned sliced mushrooms, as they do not shrink up into nothing...  I used 1/4 cup of the all purpose flour instead of 1/2 cup... The reason I used 1/4 cup was based on a review by MONICA:

"I first melted the broth and butter. Then gradually whisked in the flour. Then stirred in the mushrooms and green onions. The gravy comes out very thick. I added water to thin it out. Next time I will only use 1/4 cup of flour. I will now make this gravy often. It has lots of mushroom flavor."

I followed MONICA'S lead, and put the ingredients in the sauce pot like she did, except I added only 1/4 cup flour, so I did not have to add extra broth ... You can use beef, chicken, seafood and vegetable BROTHS, based on what you are cooking... It was not necessary to season; however, you could put your own spin on it, and kick it up a notch, because it is a five star foundation...

It was delicious... Next time I will double the recipe... I put the mushroom sauce over salmon, and intend to use it for other recipes,  as sauces are important... 

I am going to pin this mushroom sauce on Pinterest and share it on Facebook... YUM!!!

We really enjoyed this gravy over turkey loin. I ended up adding balsamic vinegar to the dish , about 3 Tbs, mixing it well, before putting it over the turkey loin.

Very good and easy sauce. 
I used veg broth - will try the beef next time for more flavour.
