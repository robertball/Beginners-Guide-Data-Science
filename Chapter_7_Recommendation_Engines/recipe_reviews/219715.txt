I am the original submitter of this recipe ~  These dog biscuits require the use of Wheat flour which some dogs are sensitive to, if so its so easy to modify this recipe, simply substitute one cup of wheat flour for 1-1/4 cup of rye or oat flour or Â¾ cup, rice, barley or potato flour.

Very good!  My dog loves these.  I used 1/2 cup of homemade cranberry sauce instead of dried cranberries.  I also tossed in 1/2 cup of left over peas.  Made an adorable red and green treat.  (And great way to give your pet holiday leftovers!)

Perfect! My dogs love these. I also packaged them up for the holidays to give away and got lots of rave reviews from other dog owners. I'll make again. Thanks :)

I changed enough about this recipe that I was hesitating to give a review but these treats are great! I didn't have turkey, so I used chicken and since I am making these for training treats and wanted them to be small I ran the chicken and the cranberries through my food processor.  I also added 3/4 tsp garlic powder. Once I rolled the dough out, I used a knife to cut the cookies into very small squares and baked them for only about 5 min.  All three of our dogs love them!

Made these last week- my dogs LOVED them. (BTW- "Gracie" gives you 15 stars !) Thank you so much for posting the recipe, now I will never have "leftovers" to use up, and I won't be giving the babies just "table scraps". Such a good idea to use the turkey as a healthy ingredient, and not waste it.

Great recipe! But definitely substitute the wheat flour with rice flour. Dogs should not eat wheat as well of rye, corn, or soy flours. Besides allergy issues, they are rough on their digestive system.

My dog Jackson loved these. He is an older mini Daschund and despite having few teeth, he was able to eat these just fine. He is so bummed the jar is empty! Be sure to flour the dough well when rolling out and go crazy with the packaging! If you have kids, make these with them and bring the kids down to the local animal shelter to donate them. Shelters loved to be remembered this time of year and your kids will remember the act of kindness for years to come!

a great recipe i used rice flour but i had a hard time finding any chicken broth without onion powder .onion powder in any form is toxic to dogs! the only one i could find was campbells but it wasn't low sodium so i added water instead .read your ingredients on your chicken broth so your dogs don't get sick!!!

My lab loves most all treats but he will do ANYTHING for one of these! Including get in the shower for a bath, which he hates! I used apples instead of cranberries and cut them into winter shapes with my cookie cutters. Got lots of likes by pups and peeps alike!
