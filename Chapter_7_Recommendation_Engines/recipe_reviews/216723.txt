The only thing I did differently was to use a box carrot cake mix instead of a spice cake mix. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Next time I think I'd try adding a little coconut.

This was a nice cake--with my additions a four star recipe!  I added an extra 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  It definitely could have used more carrot--I increased it to 1 cup shredded carrot.  I didn't use the icing, the cake was moist enough as is.  Thanks!

WOW I was shocked to see the tomato soup in the ingredient list, but made them anyway. WOW!!!! these are great! i also added a full cup of shredded carrot. I made cupcakes instead of cake. My husband ate 3 right out of the oven! I had to guard the rest. You can't go wrong with this fast super moist recipe!

This was a delicious cake. I tried it with the spice cake mix and with a regular carrot cake mix and they both came out wonderful. I probably liked the spice just a bit more because of the different flavors.

For another delicious carrot cake recipe, visit my website at http://showercakedesigns.com/delicious-carrot-cake-recipe

That recipe made by far the most succulent and moist carrot cake I have ever eaten.

Enjoy!

At first I thought the tomato soup was a weird ingredient but this was delicious. I also sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Now everyone asks for this cake
