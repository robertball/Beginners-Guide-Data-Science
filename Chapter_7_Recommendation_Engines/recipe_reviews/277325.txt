These are really good!

Unless it's been edited in the last couple days, the recipe calls for 1 cup milk.  

For the person who gave it low stars, because of something the poster has no control over (how it prints),  that's not fair.

Would milk + vinegar not just be buttermilk?  Can I use that instead?

Japanese island mayo contains MSG as a flavor enhancer.  That sold in United States doesn't.  And, it doesn't taste as good.  The company removed MSG in 2017 for marketing purposes. It’s worth noting that the change was only for U.S. bottles; Japanese Kewpie mayo maintains the original recipe which includes MSG. So what does this tell us? Does Kewpie want to convey that they somehow “care” more about their U.S. customers than their Japanese ones?

Monosodium glutamate, the easy-to-add flavor enhancer that is the purest form of umami taste, was actually discovered in Japan. MSG has been a staple in Japanese cuisine for well over a century. As an article from The Guardian so aptly asked, “If MSG is so bad for you, why doesn’t everyone in Asia have a headache?” Most Asians have no hesitation about MSG. It’s used in restaurants, it’s added to street food and they even sell little shakers that sit next to salt and black pepper on the dining table.
Only Americans get hysterical over MSG.  Therefore Kewpie took it out of their mayo sold in America.
I own a set of egg molds to make eggs to fit onto English Muffins  is that the same thing?  I have not made it but needed to rate the recipe to comment.

I haven't made them yet and was looking for pancake molds and found where you could use parchment paper made into rounds.  Going to try that since I really don't want to buy rounds to use one time.  Will let you know how it worked out.

I made these this morning while the gkids were here. These are delicious! I used Best Foods mayo and I didn’t use the pancake molds ( I gently poured onto the heated pan so the mix wouldn’t spread rapidly).
They fluffed nicely and had  a wonderful flavor!  Definitely a keeper recipe! The gkids even commented on how tasty they were!

Great recipe. I did use buttermilk instead of the milk and vinegar as I happened to have it on hand. It does require purchasing the Japanese pancake molds as they get quite high. I found them on Amazon. The pancakes were very light and fluffy with great flavor.  A bit hit in my house. Now I need to buy more molds!

Very pleasant tasting pancake (we call them crumpets) I don't have the rings so decided to 'wing it' and make as I would normal crumpets. These don't bubble on top like regular crumpets, so you have to guess when to turn.  The mixture tends to liquify a bit while standing. But, aside from that, they worked out well. I certainly will make them again.

These were awesome - I used the suggestion from Heather Van Gorder's Review - pineapple cans!  Used spray Pam on the inside, removed the paper on the outside and they came out great!!  Thanks for the great idea and thank you for such a great recipe Diana71!!

These are delicious! Next time I will try with a metal pancake mold as I used an adjustable silicone and it was a bit too tall. When flipping time came the mold had to come off??!

I liked the pancakes but wondered why I couldn't use buttermilk instead of souring regular milk? 
Problem I had was getting the pancakes out of the mold.

I really liked the taste and texture. I only had two moulds so it took awhile to get 4 people fed. And it was a lot more effort than regular pancakes. I will make it again but not as often because of that

Fun recipe for Sunday brunch with family.  I did not have the pancake molds so I also used parchment paper.  Next time I'll make my molds not so high. That caused my pancakes to sink and I'll cook then on lower heat.

Used pineapple can as ring. Took a few tries to figure out how to flip them - used two spatulas & that did the trick!!

Was thinking , couldn’t you use metal cookie cutters As molds, would be great for kids pancakes. 
And yes, wondering about buttermilk to sub for vinegar and milk combo, haven’t tried it yet but looking forward to trying it out

I made it without the mayonnaise and used kefir instead of milk/vinegar. It turned out well.
