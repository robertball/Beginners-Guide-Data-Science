Given that dates can come in all sizes, 12 dates can range a lot in volume!  So I eyeballed the amount of chopped dates & added what I thought gave a good consistency - it turned out to be just over a  cup.  
I also followed the original cook's suggestions of making these with peanut butter and adding cocoa.    The end result is delicious!  A very quick and easy recipe, even without a blender.

I follow the cook's alternate suggestions of using peanut butter and cocoa, and I used the food processor. Easy and yummy!

I didn't find these very sweet at all. I did use sweetened shredded coconut from Trader Joes, as that was what I had. I tasted the mixture and decided to add a little unsweetened cocoa, a pinch of salt, and a bit more almond butter. I found they tasted better after being in the fridge over night. If looking for a subtitute for a Lara bar or other commercial bar that sweetens using dried dates this may be a money saving option. I wouldn't suggest this if a lover of sweets that typically uses refined sugar.  This is more for someone that avoid sugars.

So surprised how much my kids (ages 8, 6, 4, 1) liked this! I did add some cocoa (1tsp) as others in the reviews have said, and I honestly couldn't taste it, but these tasted exactly like almond joys. I should say that they taste the way the almond joy's of my childhood (when I actually ate that kind of stuff) tasted.

Super easy. I also cut up the shredded coconut so the pieces were smaller. We doubled the recipe and then added more dates, better ratio. I will add cocoa the next time, per other suggestions, but these taste great and are easy to make into balls. Surprisingly, after putting them in the freezer on a tray I realized the balls were not sticking to the other balls when touching, so I transferred into a baggie to transport to a party.

I suggest doubling or tripling the recipe if you are making for a party. This is great to make with kids.

So delicious especially after chilling overnight. I added cocoa and also rolled in unsweetened coconut in addition to adding to recipe. Thank you for sharing this!

Pretty good. I used sweetened coconut instead of unsweetened, but I think unsweetened would have been just fine as both the almond butter I used and the dates are already sweet. A perfect, filling post-workout snack.

Watch out for too much peanut/almond butter....I'll add the cocoa option next time - one person at the event I made these for loved them (she's vegan) but others passed them over.  Points for easy and quick, but get the measurements correct and add the cocoa....

I made these for my husband who is vegan.  He absolutely loved them.  They didn't necessarily stay in a ball, so I made small heapings and put in the fridge for a while.  This recipe is a keeper!!!!

Love them! I was so skeptical but since my snack options on the Daniel Fast are limited, I gave it a try. So glad, will keep them in regular rotation.
