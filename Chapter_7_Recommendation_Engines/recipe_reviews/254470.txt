I am the submitter of this recipe and I use 1 cup coffee ice cubes (which is 7-8 ice cubes)  not 1 cup coffee frozen into ice cubes. I found that my ice cube tray makes about 11 ice cubes from 1 cup of coffee. The drink will have a stronger coffee taste and will be thicker if too many ice cubes are used which is fine and just a matter of personal preference.

I love coffee drinks, and this one is no exception. I failed to read the submitter's review and used 1 cup of coffee which makes 7 ice cubes for me. I love strong coffee, so no problem. I found that none of the flavors competed for attention, but the peanut butter and chocolate and coffee could all be tasted quite well. I have discovered that these frappuccino type drinks are best when the coffee is made into ice cubes first. Takes a little planning, but it is SO worth it not to have the drink watered down by regular ice.

This was great! As another reviewer said, just enough coffee, chocolate and peanut butter flavor. Instead of soy milk, I used an almond/cashew milk that was caramel flavored. Since my milk was sweet, I skipped the extra sweetner. I put some whipped cream and chocolate syrup on top--perfecto!

This recipe is a keeper! I used 2% milk, since that's what I had, and it was delicious, almost like a peanut butter cup. My husband and daughter loved it also.
