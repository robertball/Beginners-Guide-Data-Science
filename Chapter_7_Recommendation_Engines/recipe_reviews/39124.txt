Tho it did not taste alot like Butterscotch It was really good.  I did make some changes to this recipe.  Instead of Evaporated milk and water I added all whole milk.  My 12yr old agreed that it did not taste like Butterscotch as well but he also said it was the best pudding he ever had.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This pudding is very sweet; it has a smooth texture and a subtle butterscoth flavor. We liked it a lot.
