This was so good!  I made it for Mother's Day brunch and it was a hit.  I chose to use a DH box white cake in place of the scratch cake, but followed the recipe for the swirl and glaze.  I also chose to bake it in a bundt pan (about 38 minutes; you know cake is done when you press on the top and it bounces back). for nicer presentation.  This will see repeat action at the LTH house.  THANKS, for the recipe!

There was nearly a cup of flour unaccounted for in this recipe. Unlike the other reviews I didn't use a box mix and actually made the recipe from scratch. I assumed the measurements would be correct but I now I have a giant pan filled with cinnamon soup. This recipe needs to be fixed.

I too used a yellow box mix. The reason was that in the ingredients this calls for 3 C. flour and in the actual directions it says use 2 C., I wasn't sure so used the box mix. I made the cinnamon/ butter mixture exactly as recipe and the confectioners sugar mixture exactly as well. It turned out awesome. Super moist and lots of cinnamon flavor. I will make it again.

The taste to this was incredible - My whole family loved it!  I used a 13 x 9 pan (not a bundt) The butter, cinnamon mix you swirl into the cake made a lot, probably could cut back on the butter as some stated but It was really good - not pretty, it was a brown crunchy messy looking cake, if frosted could be nice looking.  I'll make it again!

Ladies!  If you read step No. 2, it says "use 3 cups all purpose flour . . . "  I don't know where you feel that 1 cup of flour was not accounted for as it says to use 3 cups of flour in the directions.  Anyway, I used two 9x5 loaf pans for this and it was awesome.

I made the cake exactly by the recipe, but I made a knock-off Cinnabon cream cheese icing. It was the best cake ever. My 17 year old son has vowed off all other cakes. My partner is in diabetic ketosis. FIVE STARS!

Not bad. Family liked it. Definitely tastes like a cinnamon roll. If you're a big fan of the glaze you may want to double the recipe. When you’re making the cake make sure to evenly distribute the cinnamon mixture. Pretty good recipe overall.

The BEST cinnamon coffee cake I’ve ever made. Not sure what the question is about flour. Use 3 cups and batter is great. For the cinnamon filling, make sure your butter is super soft, just starting to melt but still and you won’t need to thin it out. There’s a lot of it but it’s wonderful. Swirl quite a few times without mixing it all in. Made in 13x9 and spread 1/2 can cream cheese frosting after the cake cooled about 15 mins.

Taste is awesome, however the cinnamon filling was too heavy to "swirl" into the mix.  Next time I'll add a touch of cream or milk to liquify. Other than that a family hit!

Oh my...so good! I also used a yellow cake mix and bundt pan, baking for 36 minutes,  but followed the rest exactly.  I did find it made too much glaze for our taste so will probably cut that part in half next time. Topping is exceptional. If you like cinnamon you will love this cake. Thanks for the recipe :)

This is so good!!! This was my first attempt at making a cake from scratch and it was so worth it! The only change I made was I added a little cinnamon to the regular cake batter. It was so yummy!! Definitely a keeper recipe.

Simple recipe overall. swirling cinnamon is hardest part. I needed to go a bit deeper. Delicious because it resembles a cinnabon. I made it night before and used a hot plate to warm for brunch. I can vision warmed up brown sugar apples with it. Sweet maddness. But just a touch of butter was wonderful. Good size recipe.

I used Duncan Hines French Vanilla for the base cake and OH MY GOSH YOU GUYS...it was phenomenal! I made it for my office Christmas party and it was the biggest hit! I used a bundt cake pan to cook it. The mixture of gooey, crunchy cinnamon was absolutely delightful. I want to go home and make another one for just us! It was THAT good. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe CJ!

There is a a lot of comments about the filling. Here's what I found. I made it in a bundt cake pan. The amount of filling was way too much for a bundt pan, but could also be too much for a 9x13" cake pan in my opinion. In the future I'll be making only half of the filling. And 1/4 of the filling if I want it to be a coffee cake instead of a gooey cake. One person said they melted the butter for the filling and I agree. There was no way to swirl it into the batter even with softened butter. The review from friends was raving it was so good. I'll be making this again.

This such a good cake. Perfect for coffee, or brunch. Sweet but not too sweet. Next time I think I’ll add walnuts or pecans to the batter, but it’s great just as written. Mine took 40 minutes to bake, not 30.

So Originally my cake turned out awesome, but this last time I made it it didn't rise leaving my cake to be about 3 inches tall on both.....I'm not sure what the difference was between before and now but it made me extra sad to see $30 sort of ingredients go down the drain....I bought a store mix instead and store icing and remade the cakes..Those cake out Perfect

This was delicious BUT 4 stars because the directions were  not same as ingredient list! The fact the main photo is a bundt cake but directions are for a 13 x9 pan was weird. The owner of this recipe must read the reviews  & see it needs to be edited for corrections.  Because I'm handicap I went with the cake mix as several people mentioned. (also not knowing which is correct ingredient list or directions) The cinnamon/sugar  part made this delicious. My coffee gang loved it.

I got great reviews of the cake, but like the others, I had a discrepancy in how much flour to use and I only used the 2 cups.  I didn't notice the missing cup right away because I was food prepping for a sick relative and was making several things at once. This gave the cake a quite spongy consistency that I wasn't a big fan of but everyone else seemed to like it.  Next time I will use 3 cups to get better cake-like consistency.  I thought the flavor was good, but I took off one star because of the recipe discrepancy.

Loved this recipe! IT makes a great bundt cake. You use 2 cups flour as directions state not hard its same amount of box dry cake mix. Make as directed put in oven at 300 degrees for 40 minutes put on bottom rack for another 30 minutes then check with a butter knife if needs a little more time check every five minutes. MY FAMILY AND I HAVE A NEW BREAKFAST FAVORITE.   THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE. Sorry your typo in list of ingredients confused so many

I made it from scratch and agree with the other reviewer regarding the extra flour.  It lists 3 cups in the ingredients, but you only use 2 cups for the base of the cake and 2 tablespoons for the cinnamon mix.  Also, the photo accompanying this recipe clearly shows the cake in a bundt pan.  However, the instructions state a 9 x 13 pan.  I made it first with a bundt pan, but the time listed to cook isn't long enough for a bundt pan.  The part where the toothpick went through was cooked, but not entirely through.  When I used a 9 x 13 pan, it was perfect.
