This receipe is  another reason to never buy store bought hummus again !  Very flavorful and easy to put together. I guess I didn't read the directions carefully because I just put everything together in the food processor and gave it a whirl .
I used juice from 1/2 lemon and didn't have tahini but I learned a long time agao that peanut butter is a good substitute for tahini. This recipe also seems like it will lend itself to additions i.e., roasted red peppers or sun dried tomoates. It will be on my list of "go to" appetizers !

My name is Violet, and I am a hummus addict. Now that that's out of the way, this was great! My brother says it's the best hummus recipe yet (and I've made about fifty types - so many hummus variations, so little time). I only used 1 can of beans, 1 tsp dried basil, and 1/8 tsp salt, otherwise I kept everything else the same.

Just made this for the first time ever, and it is WONDERFUL! Used the reserved leftover juice from the beans instead of water- I can't believe how flavorful it is! Thank you!

yum!  why buy hummus when you have this recipe?  I only made 1/2 batch as I had 1/2 jar artichoke hearts to use up - which is how I found this recipe on ingredient search - wish I had a whole batch!  I will be making this regularly.  thank you!

I made this just as instructed.  This recipe is a winner! I think the artichokes make it amazing. I plan to bring it to a family dinner this weekend and can hardly wait to get their reaction. Thank you for  a great recipe!

I added just a touch of chili powder to this recipe -- just enough to give it a barely perceptible heat.  Other than that, followed recipe verbatim.  Turned out awesome.  I'm a novice hummus maker so I was mildly surprised at the recipe.  Yum!!

I did not make any changes to this recipe and it was absolutely delicious! I did remove as much water from of the artichokes as possible.  If I needed to add more moisture, I did what the other reviewers recommended, I saved the liquid from the beans to add if needed, but didn't end up needing it.  I've made maybe half a dozen different hummus recipes with garbanzo beans, this one is the first one that I've made that has called for cannellini beans.  I was skeptical about trying this recipe, but I was not disappointed, it is the best batch of hummus I've made yet.  Roasting the garlic made a big difference and I'll always do this from now on,  I've had hummus turn out too bitter because of raw garlic.  If you like hummus try this recipe!

Very good recipe, used 5 cloves of garlic which was a bit overpowering, next time I would just stick to the three. It could also use another half can of artichoke hearts just for more of an artichoke flavor.

Made this for dinner with sliced carrots and radishes. I doubled the garlic but did not roast it. This was sooo yummy. Didn't have fresh basil so I used dry basil. I'll definitely be making this again!  Thanks!

I made this late at night.  Started with a half batch and froze the other half.  I was excited to have a use for my Costco size jar of artichoke hearts.   It was yummy.   I had a large tray of cut veggies in the fridge for kids to snack on.  I pulled it out in the morning for my son. A couple hours later, the hummus bowl was empty on the counter. He told me it was so good he couldn't stop getting it out.   He ate the freeze jar the next day.   Big win!!

This is strange, because I usually hate hummus and artichokes, but I liked this. I ate it with a little spoon and no pitas. Although the reason why I only gave it three stars is because my wife and her best friend hated it and they eat hummus all the time. Practically on a daily basis. They requested that I don't make it for them again. Go figure?

YUM!!! I've never made hummus myself, but our family goes through a lot of store bought varieties. This recipe beats them all. I only used 1 can of beans and a 6 oz jar of marinated artichokes, but kept all the other ingredients the same. I love it.

I made my own tahini and added the sun dried tomatoes as suggested, which allowed me to omit the additional olive oil. I also used chick peas to keep the recipe a little more traditional, as my hummus will be used for other dishes I'm preparing this week. I also let it sit overnight as suggested. I have kids who enjoy a lot of hummus. It's worth pre-roasting your sesame seeds (for homemade tahini) in the oven or toasting them in a nonstick skillet gives it a more robust flavor. Best hummus recipe ever!

YUM and unique!  I used chickpeas instead of white beans and peanut butter instead of tahini because that is what I had in my pantry.  Definitely good, but looking forward to trying with original ingredients.
