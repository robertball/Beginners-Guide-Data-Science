I was unsure about this recipe at first but figured I would give it a try.  It turned out really good and my husband even liked it.  It was so easy.  My only tip is to make sure you don't use to much soy sauce.  I accidently poured a little more soy sause(low sodium) than the recipe says and it was a bit salty. I will be making this again for sure.

First, leave out the soy sauce.  Use a whole head and cut into 1/8's.  Wrap each portion in tin foil with butter and light salt and pepper.  Then put bacon along the sides and bottom for the final touch.  Wrap up tight and let cook off the fire at 350 degrees for about an hour or whenever you feel it's tender enough for your liking.

Very good, I would have never thought to use soy sauce with grilled cabbage. I used the whole cabbage cut into 4 squares removing the core and putting it into packets sprayed with a little Pam so nothing stuck. I used low sodium soy sauce and added a little mincd garlic.

I had never heard of the idea of BBQ'ing cabbage and was intrigued. I opted out of the butter and soy and substituted olive oil to be healthier. I simply drizzled olive oil over the quartered pieces and sprinkled with salt, pepper, and granulated garlic and it was delicious! The cabbage edges got a nice char on them while the rest of the cabbage was soft and succulent but not soggy! Needless to say I will be making this all summer long!

This was very good and my family enjoyed it.  However, I did use low sodium soy sauce and I did not add the extra salt, just a little pepper.  I also added chopped onions to the cabbage.  It was good!

This is a wonderful recipe. I didn't even bother to measure - I just chopped cabbage threw it onto some greased foil, dumped on the soy sauce and pepper, dotted with some butter and it was good to go. And it tasted delicious!

First time trying a cabbage on the grill and it turned out great!! Used onion powder, since I didn't  have any onions, bell pepper, soy sauce, minced garlic, cajun seasoning, and bacon bits and put it on the grill in the foil packets.  WONDERFUL!!

This would have been wonderful had Hubs not overcooked it.  In his defense, we've never done cabbage this way before (we used baby bok choy - so pretty!) so he was not familiar with cooking time.  Loved the soy sauce and butter flavors. We're ready to give this another go!

I was also skeptical about this, but I randomly bought some cabbage recently and wanted to use part of it.

I have to say, it came out a whole lot better than I thought it would. Definitely don't over-do the soy sauce though. I opened the foil and moved the cabbage around a little in the middle of cooking because the pieces on the top didn't soften like the pieces at the bottom in the soy sauce. (If you do the same, remember all the hot air is going to rush towards the opening, so be careful to avoid burning yourself)

First time made exactly as written and absolutely loved it.  Being the creative "chef" that I am, tried the second time with added peppers [red, yellow & orange], a chopped onion, used healthy oil rather than butter, and cooked all on the stove in a covered pan.  Again, absolutely loved it!!  Next time am thinking will add some type of vinegar for something different.  GREAT recipe because is so flexible!!

I am a cabbage lover and this was VERY GOOD!  I made a mistake when making it.  I didn't see that the cabbage should be cut into thick shreds.  I can only imagine how much better that would be for the leaves would really absorb the flavor even better.  I served this as a side dish with teriyaki marinated chicken thighs.  It was a good combination.  Thank you ericasalad for sharing your recipe!

I couldn't agree more with what you said.  LOVED IT!  Course I did it in the stove, that's the only variation I made here.

This was wonderful!  I didnt have enough soy sauce so I added in some teriyaki sauce.  he cabbage had a kind of nutty flavor.  I also used a little less butter.

This was quite good.  Next time I will use less soy and substitute olive oil for the butter, just to make it healthier.

This is very good... but I must admit I added 1 strip of bacon and only sprinkled the soy sauce over the cabbage before sealing the packet... (maybe a teaspoon per packet)... cooked them in the oven at 350 for approx 40 minutes.. AND YUMMY!!!

Didn't taste strongly of soy as I feared. Delicious, and super easy! I might make a few packets extra and throw them in the freezer next time, then bake to heat.

I cooked it in the stove instead.  I can't believe it would make such a difference....but I wasn't too impressed.  I expected more and it was just okay.

This was a huge surprise to me as well as the others eating it. Because I have had such good luck with recipes from this site I thought I would give it a try, it did not disappoint, who would have thought that this combination would work so well together. I'll make this again but I'll also try different ways as well.

I somehow managed to forget about the butter, but this still turned out amazing!  I could see how the butter would add a little something extra, but the soy sauce added a delicious crisp to the grilled side of the cabbage.  Will be making again!

I know this said to cut into thick shreds but I wanted that smoky charred flavor and I thought the wedges would photo better before I cut them into thick shreds. I grilled the cabbage wedges until slightly charred prior to cooking as outlined in the recipe and topped with crumbled bacon. This turned out great. Thank you ericasalad.

Quick and good...made as directed. If I make this again, I am going to add garlic or onions or both. It seemed to lack something. I also think it would be just as easy to put it in and iron skillet on the grill. The foil thing would be great for throwing on the camp fire though.

I did not care for this recipe.  I usually am a huge fan of cabbage but doing it this way made it taste weird.  I won't do this again.

Being German, I was raised on cabbage, however having it served to me "steamed" for the majority of my life turned me off to it.  I gave this recipe a shot as a sub-out for the boiled cabbage for St Patrick's Day and my wife and I FELL IN LOVE.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the 'T' and it worked out very well.  

My only advice would be to either to use heavy-duty foil or do a double layer on each packet as when the soy sauce and leached liquids from the cabbage begins to boil on the grill they will find every pin hole in the foil and push the butter out which will cause flair ups.  

Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!

I followed the recipe, and it turned into soggy cabbage. If I do this again, I will not use foil packets but will use a foil-lined grill bowl so that it gets nice and crispy instead.

Use a small amount of olive oil instead of butter. Add an onion for more flavor.

Great idea!  I can't leave a good recipe alone, so of course I altered it a bit. No butter, but a drizzle of both olive oil and sesame oil instead.  It was a hit at dinner!

THis was so good!   I cooked mine a bit longer because I prefer softer cabbage.   I was skeptical about the soy sauce but it is just perfect!  I ate a wedge for lunch and it was very satisfying.  Just added a few cloves of garlic and a piece of onion to the pouch.   Thanks for sharing!

AWESOME recipe.  We've been getting a lot of cabbage (every week!) in our vegetable box and you can only stew and make cole slaw so many times.  Its been a rainy season, and my husband hadn't been able to use his grill in a while - so this was the perfect dinner job for him!  Made some coconut rice and salmon along with it - we've made it three times in two weeks already!

Easy and tasty. Ours came out really wet, so cutting the soy sauce would probably fix that.

I had part of a leftover head of purple cabbage, so I made a couple of packets per the recipe and threw them on the grill.  It was so quick and easy, and the hubby and I both thought it was great.  The 5 y.o. wasn't a fan, but that's no surprise.

If you like cabbage, like I do, then you may like these. Unfortunately I thought they were just so-so. The flavor was bland. The only change I made was to add onion. I checked them after 15 minutes on the grill and the cabbage was still pretty crisp so I gave it another 10 minutes and this time the cabbage was charred and burnt on the edges. I cut off the burnt sides and still ate it. It basically just tasted like cabbage. It was fine I guess but not worth the trouble. I probably won't make this again.

I added four slices of sweet potatoes, two slices of tomato, green beans and instead of the soy sauce I used a homemade tomato sauce... tasted great and everybody loved it. even my cousin who doesn't like cabbage at all said, in her words-"it tastes great" so three stars. but only because i made my own additions.

Awesome! I tweaked the recipe. Omitted the Soy sauce, quartered a small head of cabbage, sprinkled with salt and black pepper, squashed in butter after placing the quarters on aluminum foil, sprinkled with fresh minced garlic and after wrapping to where foil could be flipped, grilled for approx. 35 to 40 min. Best oh my goodness! Best stuff I have eaten! Loved love love!

I made this and added onions and garlic.I also pan fried it and found that the cabbage gave off a lot of water.  I did not add the salt because I did not have low sodium soy sauce. I expected a lot of flavor and was disappointed with the taste. I may try again but this time I would put it on the grill and see if that makes a differences.

it was really good. I should have used a higher heat so it would brown more, but it was still tasty. I also used olive oil instead of butter to cut back on calories
