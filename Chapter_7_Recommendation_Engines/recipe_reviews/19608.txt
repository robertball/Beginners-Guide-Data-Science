Nice take on tuna salad and great for a low-carb light meal!  I loved the concept, but I did change this up as I thought the amounts of the ingredients listed might be a bit much. For a 6 oz. can of tuna I used about 2 Tbsp. of Hellman's light mayo, 1 Tbsp. of chopped celery, 2 tsp. of chopped red onion, a little garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a splash of red wine vinegar.  I let that chill while I hollowed out a large tomato and made a bed of lettuce on a plate.  I then spooned the chilled tuna salad inside the tomato and served it with a couple slices of melba toast. This turned out to be a really good low fat lunch that I didn't have to feel guilty about!

Great tuna salad. I also added some eggs and used low fat sour cream instead of mayo. Very easy to make. Thank you.

Excellent.  To make it a day ahead, I add all ingredients except the lettuce.  When we're ready to eat, I add the lettuce.

This is my favorite tuna salad recipe from here.  I don't eat onions, so I left those out, and used fat-free mayo, but other than that, this recipe is perfect.  Quick, easy, simple, and tastes great.  Spoon some into a hollowed out tomato and it's a perfect meal for dieters and those who just like a good tuna salad.

I gave it 5 stars in all categories.  Since I started making this and taking it to work on our pot-luck events, it's a solid hit with everyone!

This is a salad that you want to serve right away so lettuce doesn't get soggy.  It is very delicious.  Will make again.

Easy and tasty, but a bit bland. A good shake of garlic powder gave it the flavor it needed.

I like this recipe and it's SO easy!  I added fresh ground pepper when I made it.  The next time I make it, I will reduce the mayo a bit and maybe add egg, celery, or chick peas.

Can it get any simpler?!  I used a Dole iceberg salad out of the bag, grape tomatoes, salt, pepper, mayo and omitted the onion.  Wonderful!  What a quick and tasty way to make tuna salad...

I made this in hopes that it would be a pleasent twist to the traditional tuna salad. The recipe as is however has far too much lettuce in it for me to consider it a tuna salad , it is more of a garden salad with tuna. I made it a second time using less then a half a head of lettuce and substituted the salt for garlic powder to taste and it went over much better with the family.

This a great one if you are in a hurry. I'm watching calories so I changed the cup of mayo for about 1/4 cup of fat free sour cream. I also added 2 boiled eggs to get some more protien! Yum good.

What a great idea!! It's low carb heaven!  My 4 year old pizza because she wants more of my salad. I used garlic salt in the mayo and next time I may try other spices too.

I cored a tomato and hollowed it out using a tomato shark; then I filled it with the tuna salad.  I only used 1 Tablespoon mayo and a little onion as I wasn't mixing in a whole head of lettuce.  This made for a very delicious dish.   The recipe was lacking seasoning but it's very easy to just add what you like.  Thank you Venia for sharing!

So delicious! Made this tonight as a quick dinner. I didn't have tomatoes, but it was still great. Just added a little garlic powder, hot sauce, and a little bread a butter pickle juice along with the salt and pepper to the mayo. Definately added to the tuna rotation! Will also try with bacon and chicken.

This is my favorite tuna salad, my husband makes it several times a month. He omits the onion and adds cucumber, garlic powder, pepper, avocado and shredded cheddar cheese. It is best served right away, it does get watery if you let it sit for awhile.

I don't really like mayo so I replaced it with some ranch dressing. I also used less lettuce and added some cucumber instead. Served it inside pita bread. It turned out great.

It was okay, but it lacked the crunch of a sweet pickle.

This one has too much mayo. Just reduce it to a 1/4 cup and I added a little dill to add some zip. The dill is a must in my opinion.
