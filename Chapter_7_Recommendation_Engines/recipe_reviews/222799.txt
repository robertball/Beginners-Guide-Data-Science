I was looking for something light, healthy and refreshing after last  night's gut bomb NFL Playoffs Smorgasbord.  This was exactly what I was after and what I thought we really needed but I must say I never expected to enjoy it as much as I did.  Truth be told, if health and poundage  weren't issues  I'd much prefer gut bombs - I'm not a big fan of "cold and crunchy" as a rule, nor does the idea of fruit in my salad, particularly with meat, appeal to me.  But I was willing to give it a try - for the sake of doing our bodies good.  Surprise!  We liked it!  What a perfectly compatible array of ingredients!  Not only was this light, healthy and refreshing, it was delicious, something I'd expect from an upscale restaurant here in SW Florida.  I made no changes except to use Romaine and to add some cucumber, which fit in with this salad well. I was tempted to omit the basil and I'm glad I didn't - it was surprisingly good with the pineapple and shrimp.   As for the fruit/savory combo, at least given this salad anyway, I am a convert.

We ended up pan grilling the shrimp and pineapple and it was still exceptional. The dressing is very simple to make and worked well with the pineapple and shrimp. I added a little Cajun seasoning to the shrimp and pineapple before adding it to my salad and I think it worked well. My wonderful amazingly special sweet p girlfriend had it without the Cajun seasoning and liked it too.

Very good. The flavors complemented each other quite well, and the prep was minimal.

I added bow tie pasta, cucumber, sweet peppers and it was awesome!  Would make this again, easily.  With crusty bread and some wine, a nice summer meal for entertaining.

For me, the dressing was too mustard and kind of ordinary.  I think the shrimp needed some zing also.  The pineapple was juicy and delicious.
