If you want to smother your brats with barbeque sauce, mustard, and sauerkraut to kill the taste, this recipe is o.k.  
I'm 100% German, eat brats once a week - but I like the natural flavor of fresh brats.  
It's actually the poking of the brats with a fork that wrecks this recipe.  It dries out the brats and lets the natural flavors seep out.  You may want to try this recipe without poking holes in the brats to keep the flavor sealed in.

Hubby would probably only rate this as 3-star as he is a bratwurst purist and prefers his brats slow-grilled without parboiling. Occasionally he'll agree to having this brats and beer method, which I just love. As Wisconsinites we know it's a continued debate as to which way is best. No matter which method, we also know brats to be included in nearly everyone's backyard cook-outs or Green Bay Packers or Milwaukee Brewers tailgates. You can smell it in the air! That said, don't poke the brats! Why would you do that?  Also, as for keeping them on hold in a slow cooker, I see this done frequently, particularly at large gatherings, but be forewarned that the beer taste intensifies this way, kind of killing that good bratwurst flavor and softens them, taking away that juicy crunch (from the browned casing) when you bite into them. For those of you living in regions of the country where brats are not available, our Usinger's brand is WONDERFUL and can be ordered online at www.usingers.com. Good, sturdy brat buns, if you can find them in your area, are a must!

I was having a Christmas party and wanted to do something with some frozen Johnsville Brats that were in the freezer for 4 months, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  I also did not poke holes in them, other than that I followed the recipe.  After cooking the brats in the beer mixture I strained the onions and saut√©ed them further and then added them to a cola sauerkraut recipe found on this site.  That evening my husband grilled the brats and could not stop eating them, I was afraid I would not have any left for the party the next day. He kept on saying that I must have used some very good brats!   After they were grilled I cut them in half and mixed them in the cola sauerkraut.  The night of the party I warmed the mixture in the microwave and the kept it warm in a chafing dish. I served fresh Italian bread cut to the size of the mini brats for those wanting to eat it on a bun.   The moral of my story is the 4-month-old brats that I wanted to get rid of, turned out to be the hit of the party.  I was asked over and over who made the brats.  Thanks for a good recipe, I am sure I will make this many times over, I might even buy some high quality fresh brats!

this was the other dish I made http://sidedish.allrecipes.com/az/ClSrkrt.asp

Prick the brats? PRICK THE BRATS???  Are you kidding me? You must be a Vikings fan trying to sabotage the parties of young rookie tailgaters! No true Wisconsin brat professional would ever prick a brat for any reason except when they bite into it!  Slowly simmer (NEVER BOIL) in beer, pepper and onions for 20 minutes.  A couple tablespoons of butter is optional and acceptable. Finish on a medium hot charcoal grill just before serving...with Silver Springs Beer and Brat Horseradish Mustard.  Sauerkraut with caraway is also acceptable.  Catsup?  Catsup is only used on Chicago hot dogs when you want to make Bears fans angry.

Awesome brats.  I made them for the Super Bowl game.  After they were cooked, I put them back in the beer brine to simmer until everyone was ready to eat.  I also added more onions than was called for.  These were just great.

this recipe is very good but i found out that if you prick your brats and soak them over night in the beer they are much better.

These were wonderful.  We had a big end of the year party this past Friday at a Boys & Girls Club where I work.  Since some of the kids requested brats instead of hamburgers and hot dogs I decided to try this recipe.  We had 177 kids attend ranging from age 6 to 14 years show up for the party and the brats were gone in 15 minutes. I wasn't sure how many would be ate so I only made 50, I wish I had made more.  I threw them in my electric roaster with one pound of butter and eight finely sliced onions and a 12 pack of Milwaukees Best beer.  I DID NOT POKE HOLES IN THE BRATS.  I cooked on 300 for two hours.  Then we grilled them and the kids, many who hadn't had brats loved them along with our volunteer parents.  The grilled onions were also great but many of the kids wouldn't try them but the ones who did along with the parents loved them.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.  I will use this one for now on.

We are not "bratwurst" people, but these were surprisingly good!  Took a tip from another reviewer and made a curry ketchup (6 tbsp of curry + 1 tsp of curry), which I'm going to keep in the "spice it up" file!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great!  I add yellow and green bell peppers with the onions and beer.  The best way to cook these prior to grilling is in the crock pot.  Just cook on high for a couple of hours prior to grilling.

These are great.  I love Bratwurst, but always burn mine making sure they are completely cooked on the gril.  This way all you are doing is browning them as they are pre-cooked.  The extra flavor is great too.

Being born and raised in Wisconsin,this recipe is very close to being right, however, the key is to grill the brats first, then put them in the beer, onions, and butter and let them simmer.  The longer they simmer, the better they are and you can actually taste the beer and onions instead of grilling off all the flavors!!!

A Brat in Wisconsin is always good, but I have to agree with those against par-boiling. You wouldn't do that with anything else, why a brat?  Slow cook on the grill and then place in a heated pot of beer and onions if you wish. That's especially handy if you want people to eat when they want to. They can stay on the stove for many hours in hot beer and onions and be just as good as right off the grill.

Sausage and beer - what's better than that? I used six brats, 2 bottles of Newcastle Brown Ale, one sweet yellow onion and an 1/8th of a cup of butter. DO NOT POKE THE BRATS - that lets out all the good flavor. After cooking in the beer mixture, I moved them to a nonstick pan to brown - we're under a burn ban in Texas. In any case, we served them on whole wheat hoagies with the cooked onions, curry ketchup (1 tsp. yellow curry and 6 T. ketchup mixed) and brown deli mustard. Yummy!

A great-tasting, classic Wisconsin recipe.  It seems the secrets here are the butter and mild heat.  I usually see the best-tasting brats floating in a pan of gently simmering (not boiling) beer, sliced onion, and butter right on a hot grate for a half hour to an hour before grilling.  BTW, grilling is only for lightly carmelizing the skins - and for locking in the juice from simmering - not additional cooking.  Do not overdo either!  Skins should literally burst when bitten through.  And, yes... serve on hoagie or hard rolls, or something substantial.  Add a sliced apple and a few caraway seeds to warming sauerkraut for a more mild, sweet flavor.

We have always cooked out brats this way. However, we leave out the butter and do not poke them. I gave this 4 stars because I think poking them lets out the flavor and the butter didn't do anything to them.

First time I made Brats, and they were delicious! I served them on toasted hoagie rolls (toast them right on the grill). On the side; fresh chopped onions and warmed (or cold) saurkraut. I also drained the onions from the boiling beer and served them along with the toppings. That and a nice dijon...very yummy. Next time I might add some spices to the beer mixture, like red pepper flakes, garlic powder or a little Old Bay seasoning. Also, maybe I'll try a darker beer. Don't forget to enjoy these with your favorite beer.

I'm from the capitol of bratwurst, city of 'Sheboygan WI. This is the only way to cook and eat brats.  I have many memories of bratwurst days in our town where the town was filled with smoke from grilling the brats and boy what a sight.  Thanks for putting this recipe up Bob. We always used Kaiser rolls and cut the brats in half for a full sandwich.  But either way is great... enjoy one thing i would like to add, we never pricked the brats as it takes away the flavor.  always use tongs on them while grilling also so the juices stay in.  they really don't explode on you unless you par boil them too long,  just a FYI and my viewpoint

These are very good.  I made half of the recipe, but should have made the full recipe.  They disappeared very fast.

I used kaiser rolls which were browned on the BBQ grill and then used regular dijon (good, but spicy mustard would be better).

I also used Old Milwaukee Beer (large bottle 32 oz for under $2).

I'll remember this recipe for Oktoberfest!

As a German in Wisconsin, this is the only way to cook brats.  Have been grilling them this way since I learned how to grill, and they're absolutely delicious.  I have to say, though, that I don't prick my brats--the flavor of the beer is absorbed anyway and I've never had a brat explode.

Awesome recipe, I added hot sauce to the butter/beer for a little kick and cooked the onions after removing the brats for another half hour or so, they were fall apart tender and delicious.

My father is from Wisconsin and my Mother is German, so I grew up on brats. I always cook my brats in beer before grilling(my father hates that) but wondered if adding the onions and butter would add to the taste and it did. The only reason I gave this only 3 stars is the poking of the bratwurst. If someone trying this recipe did this they would be robbed of the juicy explosion you get when you bite into a properly cooked bratwust! And ketchup?...never should it touch a bratwurst!

with the glowing reviews, we had to try last year (I forgot to review!!) for our Octoberfest party.  A lot of people wondered what the secret was, as they had only used beer in the past.  The addition of butter and onions was incredible!  Couldn't be easier or tastier.  We loved it, thanks!

A brilliant recipe, which I've only just got around to reviewing after a couple of years because I have been too busy making it!  Here in Australia "sausage sizzles" are a very common event either at home or out (there's a barbeque plate everywhere you go), and apart from the superb flavour, it's just so convenient to just brown the sausages and onions and serve!  The only changes I make are waaaaay less butter (but I do keep a tablespoon or two because it adds to the flavour) and waaaaaaay more onions because lots and lots of browned onions are The Law in my family.

Thanks, Bob!!  My dad made these all the time...I grew up in WI.  Unfortunately, I never asked him how he did this and he has now passed away.  I will remember him fondly every time I make these.  They are AWESOME, and my entire family loves them.  Thanks again.

Decided to have an impromptu Oktoberfest last month and served these. Everybody loved them including myself. This was the first time I had ever had bratwurst (and my mother hails from Germany). I made a huge batch -- 36 bratwurst and put them in a big pot, cooking in two different batches. Quick, easy and delicious.

Smoky & moist. The butter created a lot of smoke on the grill, which gave the brats a fantastic smokey flavor. The prior simmering kept the brats moist inside & out, preventing a crisp skin - moistness & smokiness was preferable to crispness in the case of WholeFoods' store-made brats. I know because I tested 3 brats on the grill without simmering - dry! Also, I found that 1/4 c butter & 2 beers was fine for 3-1/2 lbs brats.

We grill the "hot and spicy" ones then simmer them in the beer and onions.  Then serve with the onions and mustard.  You can even use sauerkraut. Yummy!

Always a wisconsin favorite!  I like to boil the brats with sourkraut in it too.  Now that is being a true Wisconsinite.  It gives the kraut a little bit of flavor. And you have to have kraut on the bun with the brat!

Don't poke your brats--it dries the them out and you lose flavor.  Also--the butter is optional-it tends to soften the texture.  If you like a firmer texture--less or no butter. If the brat casing is breaking open before you grill you are probably boiling too vigorously--turn down the heat and cook them more slowly at a low simmer instead of a full boil.   In Wisconsin, some people grill the brats and then put then in the beer mixture in a Nesco or slow-cooker.  This is great for a party where you have to feed a lot of people and don't want to man the grill all day.  We prefer the flavor of boiling (carefully) first and then grilling--but on the 4th of July when we have 100 hungry people over who show up at all different times--grilling first and throwing the brats in the beer mixture in a Nesco works perfectly--they still taste great. If your grocery store carries Johnsonville brats they are very good and seem to be spreading around the country as my sister in California is able to buy them at her local grocery.  My very favorite, however, are Usingers in Milwaukee.  They are available on the web at Usingers.com.

While these brats were good, I feel that I can only rate  the recipe as 3 stars because I did not prick the bratwurst until they were on the grill.  You will lose flavoring in the brats if you prick them in the boiling process.  I also, melted the butter in the stock pot, added and sauteed the thinly sliced onion until the onions were tender.  Then, added the links, and poured in 3 bottles of Leinenkugel Red Lager.  Simmered for 20 minutes and finished them off on the grill.  Note: After removing the brats from the liquid, I continued to simmer the onion/beer and after putting the brat in the brat/sausage bun, put some of the onions on top, and topped off the sausage with some spicy brown mustard.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe. been using this for years except for the butter.  I make mine in a slow cooker, then take out the ones for the children then add the beer. I would never give anyone under 15 anything that is slow cooked in beer, not all the alcohol evaperates, People that are senitive to alcohol can have a bad reaction. I always inform they are cooked in beer by placing a sign in front of them. My friend who has this problem warned me years ago that this has caused her problems in the past, she said it is mainly things that are cooked for a long time.

Once I was at a festival... and they had Brats and saurkraut on a bun, that was very different than than I had ever eaten before. Instead of being juicy...(love those juicy Brats) the meat was lean and *meatier* instead of juicy/greasy. I found out later that by doing exactly what this recipe says to do, (poke and boil cook with onion &  butter and then grill) it tasted just like that festival's. I have made Brats this way, hundreds of times (esp. for company)and will continue MOST of the time, to do so. Sometimes, I will however want a juicy (greasier)Brat instead. Anyway. Great recipe Bob Cody. Thanks for sharing... I am sure lots of people feel the same as I do: that this is a very delicious way to make Bratwurst!

Simple and fast!!  Excellent taste!!  Followed recipe to a "T" except DID NOT poke holes.  Professional cooks'll tell ya don't poke holes in ya meat cause you allow the juices to run out which may dry your meat out. Also you may wanna allow it to simmer uncovered so brats won't split too much.  Quick, great tasting recipe!!!

Great recipe, I changed it a bit by cooking 3 large onions with it. Then I took all of the onions and Saut√©ed then with olive oil and 1/4 cup of brown sugar until carmalized. Makes a great topping for the Bratwurst.

These were very good.  The beer taste wasn't too overpowering...and I am not a beer fan.  My only complaint is that because of poking the brats they split on the grill.  I thank you for the post...delicious.

Oh, my my,you have a fantastic recipe here Bob!! I have to admit I was leary because I don't like beer but this was wonderful! I only used 5 sausages, so I used 1/2 cup butter and 1 bottle of beer, and 1 onion.If you get a good bratwurst, you don't need to add any other flavorings, I was going to add other things and decided not to add anything else and make as is and I'm glad I did! I let onion mix cook down a bit so they were caramelized. I think I would make the full mixture with the 5 links next time because I ate almost all of the onions all by myself! I also warmed my rolls in the oven so outside was crispy. I just realized I forgot to add the pepper and it wasn't missed at all. I also used regular mustard. I think I will try this with other sausages too! It was great! Thanks Bob!

Your recipes are gonna make me fat!  My family loves brats this way.  I will only cook them like this from now on.  I down sized for 5 brats, 1/2 cup butter, 1 beer, but still used 2 huge onions because I saute them and they condense quite a bit.  I also added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and garlic pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Not real heart healthy, but certainly palate pleasing and hey, life is short anyway, enjoy it!  Cook your brats Bob Cody's way!

I tried this recipe last night.  I have prepared bratwurst for 20 years, and these were the best.  I will definitely prepare them again.

The only change I would make is add about 1/4 brown sugar, it rounds out the beer flavor. Cook the onions until just soft in butter add the beer and sugar. Grill brats first, then add to heated marinage. These were my favorite made by my Grandmother that ran a bar and restaruant for years. It was the one thing that people would ask her to make for picnics. She would serve it from a nesco.

YUM! My husband raved about these for days after we had them! Only thing I changed was to add some green pepper to the onion and once the brats went off to the grill, I cooked the onion and green pepper to serve on top of the brats. Great flavor! Will definitely make again.

These were pretty good. I didn't have any dark beer so I used miller lite, it's what we had. Next time I will use a darker ale in hopes of getting a more flavorful brat.

I don't eat brats but got some for my family and they said it was too much butter, so next time I will leave it out or not use as much.  Good recipe overall!

Maybe it was just us or because we aren't from Wisconsin but this was just no big deal. I followed the recipe with the exception of poking the brats but I didn't think there was much flavor.

These are so very good and easy to make.  We don't poked holes in the brats.   We do simmer on the stove in the beer (& water to cover) with onions & red +/or green peppers for a few hours until grilling time;  then on to a medium hot grill.   We prefer crusty Italian bread cut to the length of the brat in lieu of hotdog rolls.  Serve with onions and peppers.   To die for.

These were great!  I had only one bottle of beer, but I was able to make half a recipe and the one bottle just barely covered the sausage and onions (so for a full batch I'll probably just use 3 bottles and then drink the rest!).  Also, I didn't prick the sausages.  All that would have done is make them dry out quicker.  If you want to make sure they don't burst, just make sure to simmer rather than boil the sausages, and then make sure your fire's not too hot.  While the brats were grilling, I sauteed the onions, which taste a lot better than just simmered ones.

We really liked this recipe!! I didn't have 2 lbs of bratwurst so I used 1 pound of it and 2 beers and 1 stick of margerine. It was awesome!! My husband's family is from Wisconsin and told me that after grilling I should put it back into the beer to keep them warm. Good stuff!!!!!!!!!!

This is NOT a crockpot commuter dish, if you expect to have firm, crisp bratwurst.  The exact words from my husband were "bratwurst is not supposed to be like this."  It was very, very soft, even after browning.  That said, the flavor was INCREDIBLE, and had I done this correctly, it might have had 5 stars.  I used 1 bottle of Pyramid Hefeweizen (beer of choice lately), 1 cube of butter, and 2 onions.  Maybe I can put the leftovers in mac & cheese?  I will revisit this when we get our bbq...

Very nice recipe. On our lake is between Sheboygan and Fond du lac, we simmer the brats in water, grill them for a half hour(they almost look over done) then throw them into the beer sauce with a few cloves of garlic. If money is no problem, I have found that Guines Stout makes the best beer sauce. P.S. Please don't poke the holes in the brats.P.P.S. In our house we take some of the  cooked onions,garlic and the sauce itself and fold it into our baked bean recipe.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years.  The brat is always juicy and so tasty.  As with the last reviewer, I too add peppers and onions.  I preheat the BBQ to 350 degrees or medium and prepare long skinny strips of orange and yellow peppers, sweet onions, fresh ground pepper, coarse sea salt, 3 Tbs of butter and 3 diced cloves of fresh garlic.  Wrapping them carefully in high-heat tin-foil, I place them on the top shelf of my BBQ at the same time the brats are placed into the beer mixture to boil.  Be sure to turn the foil at least four times to ensure that no burning takes place.  As the brats cook about 20 minutes in the beer and another 10 on the grill, this 30 minute "steaming" of the peppers and onions has never failed me and is so tasty.  Lastly, I too would recommend fresh bratwurst.  But, like most of you, can't seem to find it.  A great alternative is the Johnsonville Beer Brat.  Ask your grocer for it by name.  This product is hard to find, but once you do, it makes these brats even better as they are already infused with beer.

This recipe was great for my 4th of July barbecue.  You can serve the onions from the marinade with the brats; just throw the onions on the grill for a minute first so they get browned.  Also, sprinkle some water on the brats while they're on the grill to make them nice and crispy.

WI man here. 2 things ruin this recipe: 1.) don't pierce the skin of your brats. That causes all of the flavor to leak out. This is ALSO why you NEVER want to boil them. Which brings me to point 2:

2.) If you REALLY want to get that beer flavor, don't use a stock pot, and don't use a stove. Use a crock pot. Fill it with beer, onions, some fresh garlic, maybe some Worcestershire sauce, and whatever else you have sitting around the house that you care to experiment with (I like to use a couple tablespoons of sriracha, personally). Cook on high for 4-6 hours, and then grill on low-medium heat for all of a minute to just crisp the outside.

If you want even MORE beer  flavor, then before you throw them on the grill, stick them in a skillet and caramelize them in a little bit of butter and a VERY shallow pool of beer. The sugars from the beer will produce a brown coating that is simply delectable. REMEMBER: be careful NOT to break the skins!

Recommended beers: A milk stout, an amber ale, a nut brown, or a porter.

Beers to avoid: Anything hoppy (e.g. pale ales). Yes, it will make your brats bitter; not bad for beer in itself, but for brats it's friggin' disgusting.

I had a few brats in the freezer that needed to be used, so I made a scaled-down version. To the beer, I also added some chopped red and green peppers and garlic powder. It seems natural to want to poke the brats, but after reading reviews, I DID NOT POKE. I then pan-fried brats to brown (along with the onions and peppers). Brats were delicious, good texture and juicy. (Was that the fat that didn't come out? Whatever, they were great!)

Perfect with the Guinness Black Lager DH brought home.  Hoagie rolls and brown mustard is the only way to go with a brat! UPDATE:  I added liquid smoke to the pot, wonderful addition!

Wowzers! These were fantastic!  Followed the directions to a T!  At the end we drained the onions and used them as a topping!  Super!  This will be my go-to recipe for brats!  Thanks.  I did have to use the broiler and they turned out great!  I just kept truning them and broiled them for probalby 15- 20 minutes.

Delicious, fun, easy recipe for a large and casual group!  Add a few extra Brats--it is surprising how many eat more than one!  I served this with the German potato salad and sauerkraut relish I made ahead of time--no leftovers!

Taste was excellent, I was bummed that I used 4 bottles of beer and 1 stick of butter then didn't have anything else to do with it except throw it out.

These were pretty good. I had 1.25 lbs of sausage and used 1 tall can of beer and a large onion. I did not poke the bratwurst. I thought they were pretty good, but my hubby loved them. I would have rated 3 stars, but since my hubby loved them so much, I gave an additional star. I think I prefer the pre cooked bratwurst myself, but then, I'm a californian...lol! No offense to you wisconsinites out there.

We grill our brats first - then simmer in beer and onions - no butter.  Then a nice hot mustard to top!

We LOVE our brats cooked this way! I boil mine a little longer, and reserve the beer-soaked onions from the pot to serve with the brats along with spicy brown mustard~YUM! :)

All my life I've made Brats with sauerkrat.  I was looking for something different and saw this recipe doubted the amount of beer but once I started it was the right amount and I agree dont poke the brats!  THE BEST brat recipe I have ever made.  I have 3 grown boys and a little girl...ten was just enough but might 1 1/2 it for more since it was soooo yummy.  We did NOT have left overs and if I had more in the pot..I'm sure we would still have no left overs!  Thanks again for the wonderful recipe and as well as all the good pointers!

We didn't poke holes, and we only made six rather than ten.  We've been cooking a meal every day this week, and today was one of the best dinners we've ever made.

NEVER Prick or Poke the sausages! That is one and only bad suggestion from this recipe. Leave them in the skin untouched or they will dry out. I've been doing this recipe for 2 years now. A great hit with everyone who eats my brats. Just beer, butter, onions, etc. So easy and so delicious. :) But don't pick the skin. If they explode then the heat is way too high. Never had that happen yet. Just boil the in the broth then grill for a few minutes, thats all.

I've been using this recipe for several years.  Brats just don't taste right anymore, unless they're made with onions and beer!  And I also prefer Johnsonville.  :-)  We got some handmade brats from our meat market, but they can't compare.    *I don't use any butter . . . just can't get myself to do it (I think brats are greasy/fatty enough -- but they taste great!).  Just a little touch of oil in my non-stick pan works fine.   Thanks for the excellent recipe.  We don't have this often, but it's a very special treat when we do!

These were incredible!  We made them for a bbq with friends and also had ribs and chicken kabobs.  These were definitely the best part.  We topped them with the onions and mustard and they were amazing.  We'll definitely make these again!

My husband was in a one pot cookoff and we cooked sausages just as an added bonus to serve when they came to the booth to taste his cookoff entry.  Everyone...and I do mean everyone was falling all over themselves after they tasted the sausage.  His changes: no sauerkraut since we were giving away the sausage like an appetizer, he tripled the recipe, used 1/3 less butter, did not poke holes in the sausage, used St. Arnold's brown ale, added a little more onions. He followed the recipe after that.  One side note:  since it was for a cookoff after he lightly grilled he cut up the sausage into bite size, put in plastic bag and added Virginia BBQ sauce (I know, but this was for a BBQ cookoff in Texas!)and froze for a week. During the cookoff we had a portable grill where we warmed the sausage.  We had to chase some people off because they kept coming back and taking handfuls and sending everyone over to get this "OMG" sausage!  We are planning on making again...for a german party for 20ish age group and this time we will stick to the recipe with the sauerkrat, brats and NO BBQ sauce.

We've made this several times - both with and without the butter.  I didn't notice much of a difference, so I'll leave that out in the future and save on fat and calories.  Easy and tasty recipe.  Thanks!

Amazing! I used Henry Weinhard's Belgian Style Wheat Beer (can't say no to great beer on sale!) and Inglehoffer stone ground mustard, expensive but worth it! I didn't use an outdoor grill because I'm inner city and don't have one so I used my cast iron skillet, which worked perfectly. I don't know if I should say this, but yes i polked holes in them so they wouldn't burst and so it could marinade in its juices as well as absorb the beer, and it didn't ruin the flavor at all. Topped with the mustard and onion and it didn't need anything else. I actually bought kraut but didn't use it because it would have masked the deliciousness of the brats. Drink with the remaining beer. Oh my goodness I have never had a better bratwurst! UPDATE: Okay so I made these again w/o polking holes in the Brats and they were much juicier and flavorful. Don't polk the holes:) Everything else I did was the same as the aforementioned.

Yep, this is how I make brats, except it's important to never, ever poke a brat, not even on the grill! You want to bite into that crisp casing and have all the hot flavorful juices of the brat in your mouth, not the pot. I always top mine with onions from the simmering pot and stone ground mustard! Yummm!!!!

As a Wisconsinite, if you want the classic flavor of a good old fashioned wisconsin brat, this is the way to do it.  You can grill brats straight from the package or meat market, but it just is not the same. This adds so much to the flavor.

This is a huge request for my to bring to any party that i go to adn i do give credit to you!! thank you again

DO NOT POKE THE BRATS!!!  In your Nesco (the boiling liquid) also add crushed garlic cloves.  It is also yummy to put the brats back in the Nesco after grilling for about 10 minutes, keeps them real moist!

My husband liked these, but I thought they were just OK. I think I'm just not that crazy about Johnsonville brats. Like others, I didn't pierce the brats and didn't use any butter, either. I had a couple cans of Guiness that were left over from a party, so that's what I used. I also couldn't grill them outdoors because of the nasty snowstorm we had that night, so I cooked them on my indoor grill. I know, I didn't follow the recipe very well, but the flavour of the meat was what bothered me. The next time I try these, I will buy my brats from a butcher.

I done stuffed my face on these.  We make brats like this all of the time, and the only thing I have to say is that they do not need as much time on the grill as the recipe states.  I agree with the others in that you should not pierce the brats, either.  Perfect with some kraut and spicy mustard.  Ohhhhh yea!

This is by far the best brats we've ever had, and this is a German household.(My wife is actually Irish, but very German in the kitchen.) We skipped the buns, just served with the cooked onions piled on high,along with yellow mustard. Served along with Allrecipes "Authentic German Potato Salad" and Aunt Nellie's red cabbage. I got rave reviews from spouse and guests. They said this was more authentic than at German restaurants.

Pretty good but I always saute the onions in butter before adding the beer. But I would never add catsup!!!! This is from a cheesehead from Kenosha.

This recipe is fabulous and I'm not even a bratwurst fan. I followed it to a "T" except I didn't poke the brats. I grilled them on a gas grill to a beautiful golden brown. I drained and browned the onions then kept all warm in a crock pot. I crumpled up foil in the bottom and put some of the beer onion liquid in the bottom so they would stay moist and not wrinkle. These were enjoyed by all at Super Bowl - but my Seahawks didn't win :( ...watch out next year!

There were the perfect football and Oktoberfest food.  I simmered the sausages in a nice dark German beer and topped with a spicy brown mustard.   Very tasty.

Simply delicious.  I used 6 brats, 1 can of beer, 1 sliced red onion, garlic powder and black pepper, 1/4 C. butter and homemade wheat hot dog buns.  The brats did not have an overwhelming beer flavor and were really juicy and flavorful.  I always used to just grill my brats plain but this recipe makes them taste so much better.

I wasn't prepared for the overwhelming beer taste.  I think you have to be a beer lover to like these; I couldn't taste the brat at all.

I fiddled with this quite a bit using bits and pieces from the reviews but basically still using the beer, onion, pepper brine idea. I really didn't care for the flavor of the beer soaked brats after all was said a done. Do use the hogie rolls instead of hot dog buns. I surely will next time I make brats. But I think I'll make my plain next time.

This recipe was awesome!! I don't care for sauerkraut so when I threw the brats on the grill I fished the onions out of the pot and put them in a skillet to carmelize.  I put the brats on a toasted hinge with spicy-horseradish mustard and topped them with the onions. YUM!! You gotta try this one!

After trying this recipe I decided that a good ole'fashioned brat on the grill with raw onions and mustard is best.  No need to add the extra calories for flavor, i.e. the butter.

I took this camping and it turned out great!  I simmered the brats the night before, then left them soaking in the beer until I got to the campsite, and then I grilled them and everybody went ga-ga over it.  Awesome!

I think the recipe was rather easy, however, I was unable to locate "fresh" bratwurst so I used the Hill Shire Farms brand (which I dont recommend). I will give this recipe another try when I locate the "real thing" in bratwurst. The HillShire Brand tasted too much like a breakfast sausage. It just didn't taste good. Get the real one's Im sure it will taste great then. Thanks for the recipe.

I gave this three stars because even I know how ridiculous it is to prick your brats. And they don't explode if you don't either. I'm guessing that I'm like a lot of people that don't have a sausage monger around the corner and are using Johnsonville or other readily available brat from the grocers. This recipe is a good start as is, sans the pricking. Made it as written (again, no poking) the first time. I think if you want to elevate this, change your choice of beer, buy artisan brats, etc. The beer and onion broth is great. Tonight we're going to simmer the brats in that liquid first, then grill, then place back in the pot until everyone is ready to eat. Just whatever you do, DON'T PIERCE YOUR BRATS. :)

Don't forget, you save the beer broth and toss em back in on low heat to keep them nice n warm, that way you can go back for seconds, and thirds, and...well you get the idea. I usually do it with red onions though.

Did mine crock-pot style: about 8 brats, 2 big cans of sauerkraut (drained), 1 onion chopped, 1 large bottle beer (we used Fat Tire) - Let it go for about 3-4 hours on High and then brown at the end (if desired for appearance) - made for a great sandwich!!

Delish!  Didn't add as much butter as called for (cut it to 1/4 c) and it was still fabulous.  I also added a little bit of red pepper flakes, some ground pepper and a some thin slices of red and yellow mini peppers for some color.  Boiled and then cooked on my grill pan on the stovetop.  Will definitely make it again.  Oh, yes, also - for sure serve the onions and beer sauce with the meal - my mouth is watering again just writing this!

I liked it as a fast dinner. I did boil down the beer, onions, and butter to make a topping. Next time, I would like to boil/grill the bratwurst, discard the remaining beer, and lightly fry the onions.

Oh yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Piercing the brats allowed the flavors of the beer and onion in.  Unfortunately it was late at night when I made this, so I brown the brats in a cast iron skillet instead of on the grill.  The onions from the beer bath were just AWESOME.  My husband said they were the best brats he's ever had!!!  He's not a picky eater, but he can be stingy with his complements.  I'm gluten intolerant, so skipped the bun, but I was impressed as well.  I can't wait to try this again with the grill.

I never poke a brat before cooking on the grill. When you boil in beer you will draw out a lot of the fat. Cover over indirect heat and they won't pop when you cook them.
 For a large pack of brats I use 2 cans of beer.

My family loved this recipe. I cooked another batch and because of my high cholestrol I had to modify the recipe for me. I used beer brats reduced the beer to 2 cans and the butter to 2 tablespoons. I added 2 cloves of garlic they were still very delicious.

NEVER EVER prick the bratwurst. Recipe is fine as long as you dont do that. Been cooking them for years and never had one explode. Other than that, this method gives great flavor and allows for perfect grill time before eating. Poking holes in the brat is the mother of bad ideas.

Wisconsinite all my life & raised on brats. Grandfather was a butcher & made them. Never parboiled them. May have put them in a bit of butter after cooking. Standard Sat supper. If you are from WI you ALWAYS put them in a hard roll. Sheboygan hard rolls the very best. Best hot off the grill straight to the roll, mustard, onions or whatever on top. My dad taught my husband how to grill them. Soaked in a bit of water, then on the charcoal, flareups doused with the water. Then it was all in the feel of the brat to know when they were done. Never overcooked, like we've seen some do.

The bratwurst were good, but I really do not think simmering them in beer, butter and onion added any flavor or changed them in any way.  We will go back to putting them directly on the grill and saving the time and ingredients of this recipe.

These were great, the beer added the perfect touch.  Good with any grade of brats.

I live here in Green Bay.. born and raised and this recipe supports how we are brought up making brats.. However do not poke the brats!  U want to keep all of those flavors in!  Beer and onions make the brat.  Best for all Wisconsin get togethers or tailgating!  Go Pack Go

Yum! I've always parboiled my brats in beer.  And I've always sauted onions to top.  But I've never thrown it all together with the butter.  I'll never do it any other way again... This truly is the only way to go!  The onions were so much better this way and it really "upped" the flavor in the brats. This is the perfect, simple brat recipe.

I must have used the wrong style of beer. The house smelt horrible, even a friend stopped by and right away said, "what stinks." The taste was pretty good if you could get around the smell of the stinky hot beer.

This is THE Wisconsin brat recipe EXCEPT do NOT prick your brats! They will not explode. You must keep the flavor in. Don't even use a fork on the grill - use tongs so you don't pierce the skin. Tasty, brown perfection. Don't forget the horseradish.

I definately will be making this a regular during grill nights in my family!!! The brats came out juice and nicely browned!!! The only thing is make sure to saute the onions with the butter in the beginning...once you add the beer/pepper..let that simmer a bit..the smell is amazing!!! Those brats were so good!!! Thanks!!!

This is how I always make my brats!! I got the recipe from some friends that are from Wisconsin.  However, if you can, I sautee the onion in the butter before I add the beer and brats.  They work well with a nice horseradish mustard, too!!

These are fantastic! Used fresh brats from the meat case at our grocery store. Did use about twice as much onion as recipe called for, and added green pepper slices and 2-3 cloves of garlic. Did not prick holes in the brats and simmered more like 40 minutes, before putting on the grill. Served on fresh bakery hoagie buns with mustard and onion/pepper veggie mix. YUM YUM !!

I couldn't find fresh bratwurst, so I used the packaged cooked ones, and boiling them in the marinade before grilling made them so tender and added so much flavor. I cooked the liquid down and the onions were AWESOME! Great recipe for brat lovers!

This is our standard Brat recipe with a few alterations.  Don't poke the brats.  We bring 2 cans of bear about 2 sliced onion and about 1/2 jar stoneground mustard to a slight simmer.  Put the brats in for about 15 or so minutes.  Then out to the grill until they are a nice color brown.  I have also been known to bast them with the bear mustard broth.  YUMMY!

Hubby LOVED these. He loves brats and this was the perfect MAN recipe, brats, grilling, and beer. Hubby insisted these be done opposite of directions here though... he grilled first then into the beer/onion sauce. (maybe that's a german/texan thing) I don't eat brats though so I am going on hubby's word on this review. Served these with pickle relish and sauerkraut. I don't think my DH poked holes in the bratwursts though. I only used half the butter because that is all I had on hand. We used a Texas brewed beer, Shiner Bock Blonde.

We had these tonight and they were a hit with the in-laws.  Don't poke them- just don't boil them and they shouldn't burst.  I simmered them for about 15 min. or until they turned lighter in color, then my hubby and his dad threw them on the grill for another 10 min. or so.  They were juicy and flavorful.  Oh, and I left out the butter completely, and used 2 cans of beer and 1/2 an onion for 8 brats.  I ended up adding a little water as the beer evaporated during simmering.

I cut this recipe in half for two of us.  Boiling the brats in the beer really enhances their flavor and makes them so much easier to cook.  I served these with the reserved onions from the pot on hoagie rolls with dijon mustard.  Potato salad was a great side with these.

I'm originally from the Chicago area but am now in Boston, where you don't find too many brats. I had to try it for myself. I didn't exactly follow the recipe- I fried the onions and a red pepper in butter, then cooked 5 brats (unpoked) in one bottle of Sam and put the veggies back in at the end. We loved it.

I loved bratwurst.  Or I thought I did
until I prepared it this way.  I don't
love it any more, I'm obsessed with it.
I'm a southerner.  I know catfish, fried
okra and BBQ.  Mr. Wisconsin,you
absoutely know bratwurst.  Thank you for
sharing with me a "Startrek" method...
"Where no southerner has ever gone before..."

Excellent...I made these camping.  I hadn't planned on making brats this way, but remembered the recipe and thought I'd give it a try.  I just happened to have the ingredients on hand but didn't know exact amounts.  We then grilled them on a hotdog stick over the fire.  My husband loved them.  Next time I am going to try turkey brats (our usual choice at 8 grams of fat) instead of Johnsonville, which rings in at 22 grams a fat per brat.

Excellent!  I made this for my husband.  We both loved it and even my 6 year old daughter loved it.  I cooked it in my crockpot and planned to cook it on the grill afterwards.  Unfortunately, we were out of propane.  Still excellent!!  Easy cooking with only a few ingredients.  Thanks for an easy fabulous meal.

Excellent! As an extra topping I like to fry a few hot peppers in butter on the side so that those who want can add these to their sandwich.

I don't even like brats but these were awesome... don't poke holes in them though, let them simmer so they don't explode.

I have made this recipe for my Wisconsin native husband many times and it is awesome. DON'T poke holes though.It will dry it out. Sometimes for a bit of a twist, I add Jalapeno's and some of it's juice from a jar with the beer and onions for a bit of a punch.

My family is German so I grew up on this stuff and although it's not necessarily something I enjoy eating, my husband goes nuts over it. He loved these babies and topped his roll with sauerkraut. If you happen to have a local German butcher shop around, go for it. Thanks Bob for making my hubby a happy boy!

I guess I expected too much from this recipe.  Granted, I did not have Wisconsin brats, and I used Miller Lite in lieu of real beer, baguette bread instead of hoagie rolls, and did not poke the brats (as several reviewers had suggested).  I did soak the brats several hours in the beer.  My onions disintegrated while I simmered the brats.  The brats turned out quite bland.  I think that the way I have made sausages for years is easier: Saut√© some onions in butter and set them aside.  Poke the sausages (or brats) and put them in a single layer in a shallow glass dish.  Add beer 1/2-3/4 way up the brats, and sprinkle them with pepper.  Cover and nuke them (turning once) until a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the brats registers that they are done.(about 160 degrees F.)  Then quickly flash them on a VERY HOT pre-heated grill, turning them until they are browned on all sides.  Use the mustard, onions, and sauerkraut (that was a new twist for me) on the sandwiches.  Served this with "BAKED BASIL FRIES", also on this site, and it was a very good dinner.

So tasty!! Made these this weekend for an Octoberfest party. We used 2 onions, 1 stick of butter(1/2 c.) and 3-4 cans of beer. We tried simmering in the liquid and then grilling till browned and we tried grilling till browned and then simmering in the liquid.....both ways were great...they all ended up in this delish bath of beer, butter and onions! Will make again!!

I just love these!! I used Kayem fresh Original Boston Brats (which you can get here in New England)-they are the best! I only use 5 brats as there are only 2 of us. I saute a large sweet onion (cut into wedges) in 3-4 tbls of butter till just golden, then add  2 cans of beer and transfer this to my crockpot. I put in the brats and simmer for 2-3 hours on low ( I DO NOT POKE HOLES IN THEM)! Then we grill them in our kettle grill till they are browned this takes  about 5-7 minutes (charcoal-medium to high heat) be prepared for flare-ups they must constantly be moved so they don't burn. You can also make a fresh beer and onion holding bath to put them in after they have been grilled. I serve them on sub rolls with dijon mustard and onions from the fresh holding bath. I am making these this Sunday for the Pats game.

We tried this with an uncooked Brat made here in Michigan. We cooked them in a closed kettle type grill using "Maple Smoking Chips".
Warning to all-These become addictive when you slather them with a good Honey Mustard& serve them on a whle grain roll.ENJOY !

I was tired of brats on the grill because I always cook them to long, only to have a tough skin and dry.  This recipe made me look like a hero, my husband was prepared to politely eat his dried brats and when he tasted these he had a smile ear to ear.  These are bar none, the best brats I have ever tasted. I added a green & red bell pepper, no bun and served with a mayo/horseradish dip

Since I am from Germany and now live in WI, I thought I would try this recipe.  I am so glad I did.  I made 10 brats with 3 bottles of beer and a half a cup of butter.  Added one onion  and 1 tsp. pepper and let it simmer and then cooked them up.  My kids had two brats each (one child always swore that he hated brats but not this recipe)and they both raved how good they were.  I think this is the only way I will ever grill brats again.  Thanks Bob!

I cut the ingredients on this recipe quiet a bit, and it still turned out really good.  I only used 1 lb of brats, 1 beer, 1/4 c margarine, and added enough water to cover the brats.  It turned out great, and ended up a lot cheaper than using all that beer!

These were wonderful!  Lots of compliments from my guests.  Now they're requested all the time!  After boiling the brats and onions for 20 minutes, I remove from the pot and add strips of green and red peppers to the liquid and boil them until soft. Top the brats with the onion and peppers.  Mmmm.

This was wonderful.  I have never made brats before and am not at all fond of beer.  I was so surprised.  I used 3 beers and 1/2 a cup of butter.  And I also used prepacked bratz but I couldn't get over how wonderful this was!! Even my picky 2 year old ate almost a whole one by herself!  THANKS!!!!!!

excellent recipe -- easy and very tasty!  my husband was late coming home from work and the brats simmered 45 minutes instead of the recommended 15-20.  they were still wonderful!  adds great flavor to the brats.

This was very good.  I took others advice and had bought fresh brats at the butcher.  We were serving a crowd and so I multiplied the recipe by four.  I learned that you don't need to multiply the beer by four and we ended up with extra beer. That normally wouldn't have been a problem except that my husband had homebrewed his own beer to serve at the party.  Very good!

This is very similar to how I usually make brats but I hadn't previously added the butter.  I also occasionally add garlic and like to use dark beer if possible.  Sehr gut!!

This is an excellent way to make brats.  Very easy and everyone liked the end result.  The beer mixture puts out a foul odor but it is worth it.

I needed a quick recipe for bratwurst and one that called for common ingredients. This one worked great. The brats were very flavorful and juicy.

I just use one stick butter and four beers for ten brawts. Have noticed if I let the brawts cool after beer bath, then put on grill, they really snap when biting into them! I do not poke holes in brawts. They are favorite in my family!

Good one. I have access to "DD Meats" in Mountlake Terrace WA and got seriously fresh PORK 'vurst'. I'm w/ the DO NOT PRICK camp. They swell to about 3'...give or take 2 plus feet. Then you grill them. Glad I had access to fresh. Make sure you have stone ground mustard. Tradition is NO ketchup or yellow mustard. However...do what you want and use what you have.

This is an excellent recipe with a few very minor tweaks.  I do agree with one reviewer who said do not poke the brats with a fork.  Their goes all the juices!   And ketchup is a huge no-no!  I use half beer/half water - still good results.   Something I tried recently from multiple suggestions  was grill the brats first, THEN put in the water and simmer.  They plump up nicely that way and still retain quite a bit of the grilled flavor.   The worcesteshire sauce is a great addition that I will always use from now on.  Thanks for posting this!

You gotta drink the oniony brat-licious beer after the boiling. Once it cools skim the cooled grease off, strain out the onions, and you've got liquid heaven. Just kidding. Don't do that. It'd be so gross.

Since one of our church members served us her beer brats at a church BBQ, I've been looking for the recipe because she passed away before I could ask her the recipe. This was not her beer brat recipe but it was tasty and so much better than the other recipes with dark beer. The dark beer flavor was just too strong and I couldn't even eat the onions, but this one was so delicious and I wished I put more onions. It seems like people are divided whether they should grill the brats before or after and I never had a beer brat before the church BBQ, so I did both. I grilled first, put in the beer mixture and grilled again right before I put it on a hot dog bun. My remote town did not have any fancy bread except a regular‚Ä¶ And no, I did not break the brats. I will definitely make this again.

These brats were excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out so juicy and tasty. I served them at a casual supper for friends and family - everyone commented on how good they were.  I just wish I'd made more!

I was born and raised in Wisconsin, and this is definitely how I remember brats as a kid! I used Johnsonville brats (as they are a WI company, and know their stuff when it comes to brats). I paired these with some Ore-Ida Zesties fries and a ramekin of baked beans. #notsohomesickanymore

I'm not a huge brat fan (my shameful secret, since I'm from Wisconsin), but my parents love them.  I've tried it this way and it works well - I agree with the other comments that said not to poke them though.  If you cook them slowly they won't explode, poking them dries them out and loses a lot of flavor.  (Same thing with italian sausages - just like a steak, you want to cook them with the juices in and then let them cool before cutting them).

We don't pre-cook the brat or poke with a fork - we want the juices in, not out! We ciook them slow so they don't "explode."  We also put our brats on brat buns, not hoagie or hotdog buns.

This is darn near the same recipe that the Columbus (WI) firemen use, which was introduced to our family 29 years ago by a true cheddarhead.  The only difference is that one NEVER pokes the brat,and that they are put on hold back in the beer which does two things.  1) keeps them from drying out 2)infused more beer/onion flavor much like the famous chefs always tell you to season when the food is hot because it sucks in the flavor.  I have never know the Brat to loose flavor this way as they never hang around that long! I think the main thing is a fresh Brat, not those nasty white things, not pre cooked!  and perhaps some chopped raw onion & cheese for the top, what Wisconsinite forgets the cheese?

Oh - YUM!!! These were FANTASTIC! Living in the Chicagoland area, my hubs and I often frequent our northerly neighbor. :) If you've gone to any Wisconsin festivity, you know that beer brats are ALWAYS on the menu. And NO one makes a better brat than a Wisconsinite lol! As simple as these sound, you'll be AMAZED just how delicious they are. The key is tow-fold. First and foremost, use FRESH brats (if you can't find fresh ones, purchase a quality brand such as Johnsonville, etc.). Second, use GERMAN beer. I chose Beck's and was very pleased with it. Other than not knowing what to do with the ground pepper (it wasn't mentioned in the directions so I added it to my beer mixture...), this is a flawless recipe as long as you follow one simple rule. DO NOT POKE YOUR BRATS!!! If you do, they will EXPLODE on the grill! Use a little common sense and you'll be just fine. :) Grab a STURDY bun and pile on a little sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard for one SUPER delicious brat! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Bob! I'll be making these many times during the summer months and for several tailgating get-togethers this coming fall! :-)

In the past I have merely grilled the brats, then sauteed some onions and peppers to serve w/the sausages. Always turned out delicious.

The technique described in this recipe raises the bar! The sausages come off the grill with a better char - must be the sugars in the beer. Whatever the reason, this is the way I'll do brats from now on.

Thanks allrecipes.com!

Only reason I give this a 3 star is because I too grill them first then put the brats in beer, onions and butter. I think it holds the flavor of the brat in by grilling first.

I'm a Wisconsinite - and this is the best brat recipe!  Definitely need to use Johnsonville Brats.  I also simmered on the stove for a lot longer, usually about an hour or so.  Definitely a must on a game day!  Made for a superbowl party, and also on July 4th.  Huge hit with friends and family.

This got rave reviews from my guests and was gone before I could try it so I had to make it again for just my husband and me. We thought it was good but not great -- hey but you can't argue with success!!

Made these for a tailgate and they were a hit.  The key is to get the from a butcher.  Store bought brats just won't cut it.

I am German, I'm also from Wisconsin. This is the best way to make bratwurst. Gotta be fresh, my personal choice is Johnsonville (can I say that?). Thanks for sharing Cody!

easy and tasty...three things I did based on other comments:  did NOT fork the brats, added green peppers, and placed brats back into pot after grilling to keep moist.  Thanks for sharing !

This was not great. I browned the onions & brats. I added a lot of carroway seed + pepper + a jar of drained sauerkraut. The brats broke, so I couldn't/wouldn't grill them.
I think it would be better with a kielbasa or linguesa.

I did not prick the sausage, and used only 2 cans of beer (24 0unces). 6 cans seems like way to much. Than followed the directions exactly. They were excellent.

I must agree with the one that said this really dries them out. I did not have good luck with this at all. The brats were VERY dry. I think it would be better if the brats just soaked overnight in this mixture without being pierced open. It seems others have had good luck with this so it's worth a try!

This is the only way we eat brats.  We don't poke/pierce them though and we haven't tried them with the butter, yet.  We do, on occasion, add sliced peppers with the onions to the brats after they have simmered a little first.

I don't like beer so I grilled one without the beer and one with the beer. The one that simmered in the beer tasted much better. It gave it so much flavor. Thanks for the good idea.

These were really good and easy.  I did not prick the brats before cooking.  I used half the beer and used chicken broth for the rest of the liquid b/c I didn't want them to taste to much like beer (for the non-drinking people at the party).  In the future, I will make the recipe with the beer it calls for.  I made this with knockwurst also- it's a keeper.

I have NO clue what that person was talking about smoothering in BBQ sauce, since the recipe doesn't call for it, we follwed the directions & they came out great! However, I would also like to recommend not poking too many holes as they will dry out in grilling process. He was right about that one. We love brats, I am German! Thanks!!

I'm torn on this recipe. I will give it 4 stars, as my husband loved it...although he loves beer. I on the other hand didn't care for that beer taste...I'm obviously not a beer drinker. I thought the beer taste would "cook" off when the brats were grilled. Not the case. I think next time, I will use chicken broth instead of beer.

This makes the best brats I've ever ate!  They were so juicy (due to NOT piercing them before cooking!) and flavorful!  The family gobbled them up, and we're not huge brat fans, that's how good they are!

These are true Wisconsin brats. This is almost the exact recipe that my mom used as I was growing up and she doesn't know where she got it from. Its just Wisconsin tradition at this point. Great add. I do agree though that you should not poke the brats- it does seal in the flavor and keep them nice and juicy!

From tradition German family this recipe is delicious.  However, don't prick the sausage, it allows juices from sausage to escape, and this is not what you want.  Definetely add more onions two to three times as much.

Winner!!  My family loves this.  I use lots of onions but only two cans of beer with my one pound of butter.  I also added whole peeled cloves of garlic, and my family "fought" over who got the cooked cloves.  While the brats are on the BBQ, I turn up the sauce and reduce it as much as I have time for.  I serve these with the Allrecipes "Tasty Buns."  Yummm.

Delicious!  This is now the only way I prepare brats after finding this recipe.  I have never poked holes in the brats, however.  I also continue to cook the onions in the pan as the brats are on the grill.  The onions are great on the brats, esp. if you are not a fan of sauerkraut.

Loved it!  I didn't prick the brats before cooking, that would just let out all the wonderful juices.  After grilling we cut lengthwise and covered with fresh roasted green chilies (or frozen Bueno chili) and Monterey jack cheese, then put on the grill until the cheese melted.  We grilled the onions on the stove and added those too.  My husband LOVED them!  He's willing to put up with a little indigestion for these tasty porkers.

These were great.  After reading the reviews, I seem to be the only one who poked the brats!  It was my first time making them though, so I had no idea.  They were still excellent, but next time I won't poke em.

I love brats, and this recipe simply elevated the taste. I'm visiting my Dad right now, and his grill is in a highly questionable state, so I browned the brats in a skillet after simmering them in the beer. Don't do that, finish the brats on the grill!

Yum, Served these on po-boy buns with mustard, ketchup and onions. Very good, only wish we had sauerkraut to go with them. Best brats I've had and DH said to save this recipe.

Super way to cook brats! Cut the butter by half and it was fine, hubby would only spare 2 beers for this so I used chicken broth to cover. Soooo good, grilled red and green peppers and more onions to go with. This was good on a plate even without the roll! Thanks for posting this one!

Delightful - I used half the amount of butter to try and be a little healthy. And I did only have one tin of Stella - but none-the-less delighful. Hubby liked them too. The onions are to die for.

Really good. I also added a little celery seed (seed, not salt). I found that 2 beers plus a little water was enough for 5 brats. I will make them this way from now on. Only having them on the grill for a short time helped me. I used to always burn them when I grilled them because I worried that they weren't done. I followed another reviewer's tip and returned them to the pan to keep warm, and it worked very well. Sometimes, with regional food, people assume we all know how to cook it as well as they do.  I love simple and yummy recipes. Thanks!

Definitely do NOT poke the brats before cooking.  The juices and flavors need to be sealed in.  I wouldn't use butter, either.  But the rest of the recipe looks about right.  For best results, you can take the finished bratwurst and coat it with some Secret Stadium Sauce (available at Miller Park).

Delicious.  Especially when washed down with a nice Oktoberfest brew.  Using the same beer for both marinade and drinking works well, but spring for the good stuff (not Bud Light).

Yum.  I used only two bottles of beer for a half recipe and that was enough to keep the brats covered as they cooked.  Ran out of propane (would't you know?) so had to use the indoor Foreman style grill but they still were great.  Delicious!  Will make again and again.

I don't really like bratwurst but these were very good.  We had relatives in from Wisconsin and they really enjoyed them too.  They said the bratwurst was just like at home.  After grilling them, we served them on rolls with the onions and juice on top.

Ok, so I was skeptical about the butter, but this made the best brats I had ever cooked and I always simmered them in beer first!

Very simple, and very good. The brats were very juicy. I grilled them on an indoor grill, I can imagine they would be even better outside :)

I love pork but for some reason just could not bring myself to try Bratwurst - we were at a steet fair during the summer and my partner coaxed me into taking a bite.  I'm addicted.  We live in an area with a large Polish population and am fortunate to be able to buy them freshly made!  I used this receipe except that I did not pierce the brats - the polish butcher said not to - and when I went on the internet most receipes said not to.  I ended up broiling them instead of using a grill. Thanks submitter.

Very good recipe that can be easily modified to individual tastes.  I tried to cut on fat and calories, so I cut the butter in half and used Turkey Brats instead of regular Brats.  They turned out great!  My only concern was that the onions turned out to be a bit bland, but still good.  Next time I will probably add some salt and more pepper to add some kick.  And I am using this recipe NEXT TIME.  Thanks!

Okay---these are so yummy!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about them again. I used Johnsonville Brats, any kind would be good. Also i doubled the onions and added 3 green peppers sliced thinly & an can of beer and butter. As we like the peppers marinated in the beer and butter sauce also these are just like the Brat fest serves them. After fixing Brats just put the relish part in a crock pot w/juice to keep hot to serve. Excellent. I did leave out the polka music though!

Thanks for this great recipe.  I made it this weekend for an outdoor neighborhood Halloween get-together, and everyone loved them.  I used both fresh brats and cheddar brats, more onions, less butter.  Cooked them ahead of time, then everyone put them on a poker and roasted over an open fire pit.  The onions were great for topping along with a brat mustard on a big old hoagie...Yum!!

Amateur cook, always wanted Brat recipe. This was easy and perfect. Used 6 Brats, 4 TBSP Butter, Vidalia onion, 2 bottles of Yuengling, 1 tsp pepper. Wife said sliced  Vidalia was too strong waiting for me to start so I sauteed it. Definitely a keeper. Brats taken from freezer, no problem, dropped them in the beer/onion mixture.

After all of the rave reviews, I couldn't wait to try this recipe; but I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in it - I didn't think the brats were particularly better than any others I have had.  Unfortunately, nothing special.

This was "ok". I guess I felt I could accomplish a 'deeper' flavor by poking these and just covering them in Jack Daniels Marinade overnight... though the onions had a good flavor -- sorry but hubby asked me not to make brats like this again...

Loved these brats. Very easy too. I let mine set in the beer overnight, yes it had a beery taste but that's how it's supposed to be. My whole family gobbled these up, my husband says these were the best brats ever. I purchased them fresh not packaged. I used dried onions because I can't tolerate slicing real ones.

*******!!! (Five stars isn't enough) I am not a huge fan of bratwurst, but these were absolutely awesome!!  I simmered them on low in my crock pot for several hours.  We browned them on the grill and slapped them on a bun, added a little brown mustard, and gobbled them up....YUMMY!!

I had never had bratwurst before, and I can't imagine doing it any other way now. I only used 4 beers,plus one can of water, 1/2 cup of butter and one onion for 10 bratwursts. I have never tasted anything like it. They were perfect! I am now a huge fan. I even used pre-packaged bratwurst because I am down South and fresh ones are hard to come by.

This is the greatest bratwurst recipe. I don't understand the comment that it's too "beery". It's like flank steak that sits in a red-wine marinade for a few hours - it benefits from the flavor but that's not all you taste when eating the meat. It is wonderful.  Mustard, pickles & sauerkraut (I beg to differ about the ketchup) make it the BEST!

This was great! I did mine indoors on my George Foreman grill.  The onions had a nice, sweet flavor to them.  I'm from a big German family, so I grew up eating lots of brats-- and this is how I'll fix mine from now on!

I have never eaten bratwurst before, so I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking for.  I had to use a store brand (hey, this is Alabama!)  I thought the sandwiches were good and might make them again.  Perhaps they would have been better if my husband hadn't "browned" them quite so much on the grill.  They are certainly easy enough to make.

Oh My Gosh!!! I never realized what we were missing until we tried this recipe! We have made this 10+ times for just our immediate family, plus more times for large family gatherings, groups & work meetings! Always a huge hit & have to take copies of the recipe to hand out! Wouldn't change a thing!

Was OK, I guess.... Simmered my brats in beer and onion in the slow cooker for several hours, then grilled.  Pretty good, but not sure all that much better than just grilled.  Used some of the beer in a beer batter for onion rings to go with it and that was good!

This is my favorite way of preparing brats!   I have on occasions saut√©ed onions, green and red bell peppers then added brown sugar and brown mustard along with drained sauerkraut.  Makes an excellent topping for the brats!

I am not a bratwurst lover.  In fact, the last few times I've tried it, I really did not like it.  My son requested brats tonight for dinner and pulled the, "my leg is in a cast, please make me something special so I feel better" card.   :-)   Sooooo, I decided to try this recipe, hoping it would make the brats a little more palatable.  YUM!  This recipe has changed my mind completely!  They were so good!!!  I will make them again for sure.   I did not have enough beer on hand, so I looked up substitutions & used a little bit of cola and chicken broth.  (Weird I know, but that's what it said.).   Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Made 4th of July for a crowd.  The best ever!  This is definitely my go to for grilled brats from now on.  Simmered with the beer and onions 15-20 minutes, then grilled.  Delish!!

I gave this 5 starts for simplicity but did make changes.  I didn't use any butter and I added a full, thinly sliced red pepper.  I first browned the brats in olive oil (using a cast iron dutch oven) for about 10 minutes, then added the onion, red pepper and beer and let that simmer for a good 20-25 minutes.  Then I put them on the grill for about 5 minutes.  Came out perfect.

I had never made anything like it before, made it for a big crowd at a Octoberfest lunch. Most people loved them, I used a nice German style beer that gave the brats a great taste. 
I will definitely make this again.

I am a native Wisconsin girl. This is how you cook brats, minus pricking the sausage. Make sure you use good brats, like Usinger's, and not the hot dog-like imitation found in other parts of the country. Serve with brat buns, brown mustard, fresh chopped onions, and icy cold beer to drink.

Good base recipe but we had to make some substantial changes. First, never poke your brats. They'll loose moisture and get really dry. We added fresh cabbage, cut into wedges, rather than topping with sauerkraut. I also added whole carrots, trimmed & peeled, fresh onions, cut into wedges & added some beef broth to the beer during the simmering process. After we simmered these, we wrapped it all in foil  & grilled it. I served it on sesame hoagie buns. Rather than topping them with sauerkraut & catsup, we topped them with the cabbage, onions & carrots. we did still use stone ground spicy brown mustard. The fresh veggies made it brighter. We thought it was really good.

Cooking the brats in the beer and butter first gives them a delicious caramel flavor. Way better than just sticking them on the grill

Yum! I usually use a combo of beer and beef boullion, rather than 6 beers. I use a dark beer so thinning it out with the stock helps stretch it. Delicious!

I would agree that this is the only way to cook brats.  The beer, butter and onions give it great flavor, while reducing the amount of time they have to be on the grill.

Pretty good.  very easy, as well.  I had already smoked (read:  cooked) sausage but did the recipe relatively the same.  I decided I wanted peppers with this so in a separate pan browned the peppers until cooked, then added a little bit of the beer mixture along with the sausage and cooked it down with garlic until caramelized.  Then I served on hoagie rolls with our respective preferred spreads (Dijon mustard for me, mayo for hubby).  I really liked this with some salad for a filling meal.  thanks for the recipe!

I have cooked my brats using this method and they are wonderful.  However, I live in MT and the brats available here do not taste like Wisconsin Brats.  There is a certain spice and grind that are missing and frankly they suck.  For those that don't know any better, they think they are grand.  Thanks for one of the reviewer who recommended a website for ordering WI brats.  Mmmmm, slurp!  I can just taste them.

Excellent! Made this many times and just now rating it. When I don't want to waste too much beer I use half chicken stock or even water and it still comes out great. Have also forgot to add the butter a couple times and still was great. Thanks!

I used a very similar recipe from food.com, it only uses 2 cans of beer (more for us to drink!) have made it a couple of times with spicy turkey brats and everyone enjoys it. A nice Portuguese or sturdy bun lightly toasted and sour kraut is a must!

I have used a variation of this recipe for years. This was the first time I used the butter, it was great.
I will not enter the debate on boiling the brats then grilling or just grilling them or poking them or not. I love them all.

Excellent recipe.  I did not poke the bratwurst as other reviewers said not to and we did have 1 bratwurst burst on the grill. Still, the rest did fine and all tasted great!

Tried this, it was OK.  Thought it was a sin in WI to prick your brats? Different from how I normally do it (grill then float in simmering beer), but not every one has the same tastes.  If you're having a gathering, why not try several ways?

I've been using this recipe for many years.  The only difference is that I add some mustard to the boiling liquid and add beer with water to cover if needed and butter.  Puncturing isn't necessary and  doesn't appear to change the taste.  After the grill add what you like but no bbq sauce.   Thanks Jeff Smith.
