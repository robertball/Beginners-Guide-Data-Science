I "cheat" when making this--I use my slow-cooker!! I follow this recipe though and even now that I live in Memphis where BBQ is famous, people always want my secret and think mine is better than some of the highest rated restaurants!! You can't go wrong with this!!!!!!

I am a culinary student.  I recently made this recipe for 48 people in a production.  I used apple wood to smoke the pork buts.  I basted by dipping the buts into the sauce every hour and placing back into the smoker.  I used a commercial smoker with a sheet pan at the bottom to catch the drips.  I took those dripping and poured them into the sauce when I had finished smoking.  (After wrapping in foil and adding sauce.)  I then cooked the meat overnight at 165 (about 15 hours).  The sauce was chilled over night so I could remove the fat.  In the morning I shredded the pork with forks and added it back to the sauce.  I held it this way for 24 hours.  Next I simmered it to warm the pork and served it.  Many people, chefs, other students commented on how good the pork was and how much they enjoyed the flavors.  Excellent recipe.

This is it!!!!  This creates the tender pulled pork that I have searched for!  I have tried numerous smoked BBQ recipes - and while they all tasted good - they weren't perfect.  This blows away them all and my guests agreed it was better than any they have ever tasted.  I had to make extra sauce for the final simmering.

No butter. No water.  2X the rest.  Cooked an 11 lb butt in the crock pot on low for 12 hours.  Drained it reserving 5 cups of juice.  Stripped the fat and bones & pulled the meat apart.  Put meat back in the pot for another 2 hrs adding the juice back with 4 T liquid smoke.  My husband said it was the BEST he's ever tasted and wants me to make it again so he can serve it to his poker buddies.  Easy breezy and SO uber delish because of the twang & zip!  This is my go to pulled pork recipe from here on out.  UPDATE: It's Feb 7, 2012 and I'm STILL making this recipe.  Had a Super Bowl party just last weekend and this is STILL a winner!  Thanks, Robert, for sharing it.  XOXO

This recipe is too good not to rate, I tried this recipe for my uncle's 50th birthday, and it was a hit. Everyone loved it, the smoked taste and flavor was out of this world. I smoked two boston butts at one time, at the end of the party there was not any left. I have request to make this at Thanksgiving but I will make it before then. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I am new at smoking meat so this was my first experience smoking a pork butt but as an Alabama resident, it is not my first time eating BBQ.  It was awesome!!! It was a little tiring to baste the meat every hour but it was so worth it!  I smoked my 9lb pork butt overnight @ 225 using Mesquite wood chips (11 hours). I basted and added new chips every hour or so. After 11 hours I took the pork out of the smoker and placed it in layers of tin foil and poured the 1c sauce over it, as recommended, and then covered it tightly. I then cooked it for an additional 4 hours without rebasting. Removed from smoker and let it cool for 30min before shredding the meat. I put the shredded meat it in the crockpot and added the additional 1c sauce and mixed.  It was absolutely fantastic!!! Can't wait to make it again.  Even my picky kids loved it and they never like anything!

This is an excellent recipe that we will use over and over again!  My husband is from north Alabama and we loved it!  We followed the recipe to the letter until the very end - I did not simmer the pork in the sauce.  It had a nice flavor straight from the oven and I was afraid the simmering would make it too spicy for our 3 year old.  Without the simmering, it was a huge hit with everyone!

This was fantastic, when we took the pork out of the oven and the foil all of the meat fell right off the bone leaving clean bones.  This is a must if you own a smoker

We tried this recipe but didn't get the results we expected. Smoked it for ever but the roast never got tender like we wanted it to. Was unable to pull it apart. Overall, this is a good recipe. We may have got a bad roast which is entirely possible.  The sauce is very hot.

I followed the ingredients exactly except I put it into my crock pot for 10 hours on low.  It was EXCELLENT.  All my family gave it rave reviews.  So moist and great flavor.  You need to try this on a roll with some slaw on top.  YUM!

Fantastic.  I've never made pulled pork before, but first time trying this recipe, it tasted like we've been doing it all our lives.  Used an electric smoker and finished off in the oven. Also cut down the butter in half, which made the marinade a little less saucy.

Skipped the butter. Roast provided plenty of its own moistness. Topped sandwiches with cole slaw. Delish !

This was my first boston butt recipe and it turned out great!  I cooked it for my wife's birthday party and everyone loved it.  I smoked the butt at 200 degrees for 10 hours with mesquite chips using half apple juice and water in the water bowl.  I then removed the butt from the smoker, placed it in a foil pan and added the cup of sauce and wrapped it in foil.  I cooked the butt an additional 17 hours (overnight) in my oven at 170 degrees.  I allowed the butt to cool for 2 hours (remaining wrapped in the foil) and then shredded the pork.  This turned out to be extremely tender with a wonderful flavor. I didn't add the sauce, but allowed individuals to add it if they desired. Great recipe!

I used a 3.5 lb. butt roast and put it in the crockpot since I don't have a smoker. I turned it over in the liquids every couple hours. It was done at 8 hours on low. It pulled right off the bone and shredded easily. I drained off the fat from the liquids and added the shredded meat back in to simmer 30 minutes more. I added a couple teaspoons liquid smoke and a couple tablespoons Pampered Chef Smoky barbecue rub then. It is soooo yummy! Great recipe!

I went the slow cooker route.  It left my whole apartment smelling like vinegar instead of smoke, but it was super moist and tender.  Flavor wise it was pretty good with a bit of a kick.

This recipe was excellent. I have only made bbq a few times now and i never would have thought to use most of these ingredients. My husband was also a little skeptical but, it turned out great. We made it for a family get together and EVERYONE loved it!!! We will be definitely using this again within a short time.

This is the BEST BBQ I have ever tasted.  I have not made it myself yet, but a co-worker made this for a retirement party and its wonderful. The meat is very very tender and the flavor is out of this world.  HOPE MINE TURNS OUT JUST AS GOOD!!

Wonderful recipe.  I used apple wood in the smoker and basted the butt once every hour from about 12:00 pm to 9:00 pm.  After that, I wrapped in foil and lightly smoked but kept the heat until about 3:00pm the next afternoon.  Turned out great!  Wonderfully sweet and spicy all at once.  I didn't return the pulled pork to the sauce and simmer like suggested, but it tasted great right out of the smoker with some sauce on the side...

This is almost exactly the recipe I was given by a true Alabamian, who makes the most amazing smoked boston butt I have ever tasted.  However, when we attempted to recreate it with this recipe in our smoker, the taste just wasn't quite there.  I think we probably didn't smoke and baste our roast long enough.  We will definitely try again, tho, as this sauce is delicious.  Thanks for sharing, Robert!

This is how I cook all my grilled pork roasts now!  I don't smoke it, but I put in on the grill at low heat for a couple to three hours.  At the end, I throw the meat right on the grill rack to get the outside brown and crispy.  My whole family loves it flavored with this vinegar mixture!  Thanks Ron!

Wow, this is awesome! This was a lot of work but it is absolutely delicious! We used a 10 lb butt roast and used 1 and 1/2 times this recipe and it was plenty. If you have the time and interest this is a fabulous recipe. Thank you for sharing Robert.

Used a slow cooker since we did not have a smoker. Cooked a 3 lb. Boston butt roast on high for 5-1/2 hrs. Went straight from the slow cooker to pulling it apart . . . no additional simmering in an oven.  The pork pulled apart so easily, and was moist and flavorful. I rated this a 5* as I have no doubt it would be if cooked according to the directions using a smoker . . . deviating by using a slow cooker doesn’t capture the full potential of this recipe but still produces pork bursting with flavor. Great recipe, Robert.

Really good and super simple.  Made it overnight in the crockpot.  Used a pork shoulder with single recipe, no butter or water in the crock for 10+ hours.  Easy on the peppers when multiplying recipe as everyone thought it was too peppery.

Delicious! If you are cooking this in a show cooker, I recommend potting a little less spices on the roast.

Wonderful pulled pork! This was our first time smoking a butt (actually 2 - each was 3.5lbs). Smoked at 200-250 until meat reached 160 degrees. Then wrapped in foil with the additional liquid and baked about 3 hours. When it was ready to pull I just added the liquid from the foil then covered and returned to oven at 250 until we were ready to eat. The pan was completely cleaned out! Thanks, Robert - we will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe.  I read the reviews and since I had two pork shoulders I cooked one on a charcoal grill and the other in a crockpot.  The former was far superior to the latter.  If you have access to a charcoal bbq, I would highly recommend this option.  You do need to keep a much closer eye on things and you need to tend to things more but it is significantly better then the crockpot version.  When cooking this on a charcoal grill you'll need a water pan to place below the roast and I would only use 1/2 a chimney full of charcoal to get this started, otherwise your temperatures will get far too high (350+) and it will cook much faster and you'll miss out on some of that slow smoked taste.  I'd also soak your apple wood chunks for ~2.5-3 hrs as 2hrs was not enough.  They were big chunks but after an hour or so they started on fire.  Thank you Robert for this fantastic recipe.  BTW the crockpot roast was nice for a sweet bbq version of the pulled pork.

This recipe is amazing!!  I cooked a pork roast in a slow cooker for 5 hours and then shredded it and grilled it in a grilling basket on a gas grill for about 20 minutes (occasionally spooning some of the broth on it while grilling).  The first time I followed the recipe exactly but it was too peppery.  I did it a second time and cut the black and red pepper in half and it was perfect!!  I also added some liquid smoke as another reviewer suggested.

Fixed this as written except marinated it first with a Mexican marinade from a bottle I had in the fridge. Based it with the sauce Crome here while it was smoking, then wrapped it in foil with the remainder of the marinade and cooked for another 1 1/2 hours in the oven. The bark was outstanding, but the spicy flavor won't get inside unless you shred and cook, following the recipe. I think I will try injecting the meat with the sauce, then smoke/ baste and see what happens. Will let you know

I used a 6 pound bone-in pork shoulder and halved the rest of the ingredients to make this in my slow cooker, set on high, for 7.5 hours.  While maybe not the same as smoked, it was delicious!  I made the "Burger and Hot Dog Buns" recipe by Sally (from Allrecipes.com) to make wonderful rolls, and my KFC coleslaw copycat recipe (it has been submitted but not kitchen approved yet, so you can see it if you look in my recipe box).  The pulled pork, topped with KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and coleslaw, on the home-made rolls, was great!

I originally reviewed this in summer 2012.  When Allrecipes went to their new format somehow it disappeared.  I'm still using this recipe and love it.  However, I don't have a smoker.  The butt is too big for either of my slow cookers, so I put it in my Staub in a 270-degree oven and cook it overnight.  I halve the recipe no matter how much the butt weighs.  Just pour it over and let it cook all night.  Delish!

This is my first time reviewing a recipe, because this is absolutely amazing! The closest to my beloved BBQ joint in VA that shut down I've tried! I am a HUGE vinegar sauce fan, and this does not disappoint. I made the suggested serving size for 9 people for the 4th of July, each person was able to have AT LEAST 2 sandwiches, some people even had 3! There was enough leftover for an additional 4 for lunch the next day. Make more that you think you need, because people will LOVE it and you'll be sad when there are no leftovers! 
Along with some other reviews I altered this to my situation. There was no smoker or grill of access to me, so for a just shy of 5pnd butt it took about 6 hours at 275 (thanks to the other reviewers who suggested this oven only method, they were lifesavers!) I also decreased the cayenne to 1tbs, but will use the suggested amount next time as I like more spice than I thought I did! I couldn't find liquid smoke as some suggested in Lieu of smoking, and it was absolutely amazing regardless. Your house will absolutely smell like vinegar, if you find that completely offensive wait for a day you can have the windows open to make this. I also did marinate it in the sauce after shredded for some extra flavor for around 30min on the stovetop. 
If you love vinegar based BBQ, you HAVE to try this!

The flavor and tenderness of this is amazing!  I also cheated because I do not have a smoker.  After reading the reviews, the charcoal grill is something I would have never thought of....next time!  I used a boneless 4 1/2 lbs pork butt & cooked in the oven tightly covered with foil at 275 for 6 hours. Removed the foil and cooked at 350 for an additional hour basting it a few times. Then allowed it to rest and then shredded it.  I used less cayenne & about a tbs. of liquid smoke, it was still pretty spicy, but really good!  I had to put BBQ sauce on the kids to counter the heat. This dish was amazing!

I was concerned about the cayenne in this recipe as my family usually complains I make spicy dishes too hot, so I cut the cayenne in half. I was not afraid of the vinegar though as I love ACV and pork together. I did do the oven step (4) but skipped the final step of immersing the meat in the sauce (6). We have a Traeger smoker and I used apple wood for smoking. This was FANTASTIC! It will be my go-to smoked pork recipe from now on! It was not too hot for the kids at all as long as you skip the final step, and I may make it with the full cayenne next time. Thank you for such a great recipe!!!

I've tried many of bastes and rubs. I have  very picky clients and went out on a limb and tried this without trying this myself in house. Not one complaint was heard!!!!  Many said it was the best they have had!!! I did cut the cayenne pepper in half and let it cook for over 18 hours. Not just me but over 50 folks rated it 5 stars!!!

Well, I had to improvise again, but it worked so I'm passing on....  I didn't have apple cider vinegar, so I used white vinegar, and then I substituted Berry Juicy Juice instead of water. (apple juice would probably work, but I didn't have it on hand at time either.)  Added a splash of seasoning sauce because I didn't have a smoker, and cooked on low in my slow cooker. Fantabulous, so I know the original must be Uber Fantabulous.

yum! i had to adapt the recipe for my circumstances, and it STILL came out great. used a big cast iron pot in the oven, halved the vinegar and cayenne, and used about 1/4 cup liquid smoke (in place of smoking), and only used half of the sauce (saving the other half for adding after). cooked at 275 for about 7 hours, was nervous when the house began to smell of baking vinegar, but the taste was worth it! the hubs and SUPER picky kids devoured it, dribbling the sauce over their sandwiches. i got lots of "mmmm, can we have this again one day?" and "thanks! this is gooooood!" comments, as well as having 2 more meals worth now tucked away in the freezer. this is a great alternative to the soaked-in-sticky-sweet-bbq-sauce-til-ya-can't-even-taste-the-meat issue that often occurs in BBQ recipes. thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This is an excellent recipe.  We are from Texas where the extra kick from the cayenne pepper is appreciated. We do not add the butter.  We use a green egg for the first half, using mesquite wood.  We baste with apple juice during this phase. We put it in the oven for the second half.  Finally, we do put it back in the oven after it has been pulled and drench it in sauce so that the flavors all come together.  Great every time.

This was fantastic!  Like a few people, I prepared everything like the recipe says and put it in the crock pot.  No left overs on this one!  Be warned though, the house smells like vinegar after it cooks all day, so if you are planning a party, cook it the day before and warm it up in the crockpot for a couple of hours in the juice.  It was delicious!

This is my go-to for pulled pork.  I usually start to marinate the meat a day before putting it on the smoker, then slightly crisp it up after shredding.  I love the spice of the cayenne, but I'll typically throw in some onion powder and garlic powder for extra flavor.  Apple wood gives it a bit more sweet smokiness, than just the brown sugar alone.

I have made this recipe for the past 4 years and now and not once has it turned out badly.  Every time I've made it people have loved it with the exception of those that don't like spicy/hot foods.  However, the vast majority of people love it and sadly, there is seldom any left to take home after an event for which I made it.

Holy Moly! This is the BEST BBQ I have ever made. So easy. Will definitely be making again. I am not a hot/spicy person so I reduced the Cheyenne to 1 teaspoon instead.

Too much salt and vinegar for most tastes that ate it, and some said too much pepper (which I don't think there is such a thing. I have since made it cutting back on the salt and vinegar and it came out perfect. When done right, you won't need any bbq sauce!

This was SO GOOD! Fork tender and shredded apart perfectly for sandwiches. I used a sweet baby ray's bbq sauce to finish it and my family loved it. I found the recipe on a list of 101 recipes here - https://bbqonmain.com/101-smoker-recipes/

The best pulled pork I have ever had.  Everyone LOVED it.  Followed the recipe exactly.  It does have some heat so you might want to cut back on the cayenne if that is an issue.

This has the potential  to be delicious.  Only reason I'm rating 4 stars is because I had trouble keeping the smoker temp at 225 so the flavor was not good as it could've been.

I made this in my slow cooker using an 8lb. bone-in shouler picnic roast. I brushed the roast with browning sauce first, then added about a teaspoon of liquid smoke to the sauce. Poured it all over the top and cooked on low for about 8 hrs. It was amazing! No additional sauce needed!

EXCELLENT! Made this recipie for my daughters 1st birthday and everyone raved! It starts out seeming spicy and could continue on this path if you use a spicy bbq sauce in finish. I used standard Sweet Baby Rays and WOW!!!!
