Very nice.  I used rasins rather than currents since that is what i had.  I would also recommened toasting the pine nuts, it brings out their taste and gives a nice crunch.  I also added 1/2 t of allspice which gives a nice wintery flavor.  I will certainly make it again.

Very interesting and unusual flavor, however I added 1/4 cup sugar to sweeten it a bit, as it seemed a bit in limbo between a sweet dish and non-sweet dish.  Do NOT overdo the thyme as I did.  It gives the dish the signature flavor, but overdone, it will overpower.  The prep time seemed to take a bit longer than 10 minutes, but I have little experience paring apples and that took more time, and I chose to cut the chicken breasts into bite-size chunks rather than use the whole breasts.  The overall flavor is not spectacular, but it is nice over rice and very different.  Definitely worth a shake!

We enjoy all the ingredients in this dish, so I thought we might like it. Unfortunately it wasn't well received at the table. Not wanting to waste the chicken breasts, I coated them with a thin marinade of dijon and a touch of garlic flavored olive oil then cut them in strips over a big leafy romaine and spinach salad. I suppose the fact that they had chilled and combined nicely with the greens made this a better luncheon salad than it did a dinner. Thanks Isadore.

My 21 month old LOVED this dish (as did my husband and I).  I have prepared similar dishes from this site - chicken with peaches, chicken with apricots, and they both went over well, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Very easy to put together - and I think we'll be making it a LOT this fall when our apples are ready for picking.  I would recommend seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking it - I have found that helps a lot of recipes (I think some writers think seasoning the meat is just a given and don't include it as a step, but as a novice cook - I can tell you it wasn't something I had ever thought of doing w/o instruction until I met my husband who always does it at the start of a recipe)  Great dish for fall - although just as tasty served with sweet peas and mashed potatoes in the spring too!

This was so good!  I loved the thyme with it, really gave it something special.  I doubled the amount of apple juice, reserving some and adding a bit of cornstarch to it, to thicken the sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

I used only 1/2 jalapeno, concerned it might be too spicy for my mother in law, and she loved it, as did my husband and guests. Clean, warm taste, not "hot". Next time, I will add an additional clove garlic, as we like garlic, in this household.

Very nice dish.  I found I needed more oil (about 3T) and in the future I would reduce the thyme to 1t - that flavor was too strong for me.  The pine nut & jalapeno were a very nice touch.  I will definitely be making this again.

I served this for guests and it was a hit.  I used raisins instead of currants and walnuts instead of pine nuts.  Next time  I would chop the nuts!

This was very good. I made it as written except I omitted the thyme and I subbed walnuts and cranraisins for the pine nuts and currants. I think the pine nuts would of been better especially if they were toasted and chopped. I also chopped the cranraisins. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before sauteing. I thickened the pan juices with a little water and cornstarch. My apples of choice were 2 golden delicious and 1 red delicious. I served this over white rice. Keep the salt shaker handy. I had to salt it while eating. This recipe is a nice combo of sweet and spicy.

I didn't use any pine nuts or jalapenos for different people's tastes/allergies and, since i didn't have any apple juice on hand, I used a hard apple cider. Everything else was exactly as the recipe said and I thought it turned out wonderfully. It was warm and unique and gave a nice fruity spice to chicken. I would definitely make it again.

It's actually more like 3.5 stars...but since that wasn't an option...3 it is.  Not a bad summer dish- refreshing and light-just not amazing.

I prepared this as directed but after cooking the recommended time in a covered skillet it was still so soupy.  So I kept the lid off, turned up the heat a bit to brown the chicken and let the juices reduce...  Then it was really yummy.

This sounded good but in my opinion the finished product was not worth all of the work.  It was a little bland.  The jalepenos definitely helped, but it was not up to my expectations.  The apples blended in a bit and it was difficult to taste them.  It was not bad but just not flavorful enough.  I agree that it might be better cold and in a salad.

I think we would have liked this recipe better without jalapeno (which completely overpowered all of the other flavors) and less thyme.  I only tasted those two flavors.  I doubt I'll try it again.

I had a bag of apples in the fridge I was trying to use and found this recipe.  As I had all the ingredients, I thought I'd give it a try.  The flavors went together well.  The thyme especially gave the dish a great flavor.  The next time I think I will add a little chicken stock/broth to give a more saucy consistancy to spoon over some rice.  Will make again.

the chicken was really very moist and tasty.  However, the apples, currants (I used craisins) and jalepeno (again, substitute green chilis) mixture was horrible.  I ended up cutting the chicken and adding it to sald.  I won't make this one again!

This recipe did not turn out well.  The flavor is bland with a hint of odd.  I left out the currants since I didn't have any.  Not sure that would have made a differece, I doubt it.  I will not make this again.

My boyfriend and I loved this. I left out the currants because I didn't have any, and I used boneless, skinless turkey breast instead of chicken. I thought the jalapeno peppers were a nice touch.

I'd never had an apple/chicken combination before so without having anything to compare it to this wasn't bad.  I used 4 chicken breasts and 2 apples.  The apples ended up turning to mush, will using baking apples next time.  Also cut way down on the garlic salt as suggested.  I added about 1 1/2 cups of apple juice to keep it from drying out.  Not bad at all, will try again for sure.

All of the ingredients sounded good, but it just didn't taste good

This is a definite keeper, and will be in our rotation for dinners.  I did not make any modifications.  I didn't add the pine nuts, due to one of my kids having allergies....but of course then he informed me he wouldn't try it.  So, next time, they're getting added.  Toasted pine nuts make everything better.  Those would kick it up to a 5.

It wasn't inedible but it was bland for me. It has a very unique flavor but there was just something missing for me. I probably won't make this again.
