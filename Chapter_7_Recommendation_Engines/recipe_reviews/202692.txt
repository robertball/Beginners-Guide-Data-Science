A great way to use ground turkey! I made just a few modifications: I swapped rigatoni for the elbow mac because that's what I had in the cupboard. I added about half a tablespoon of red pepper flakes to help kick up the flavor a bit and I used a tablespoon of Italian Seasoning instead of the dried parsley, oregano, and basil because I didn't have those ingredients.  I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes along with a 14.5oz can of the diced tomatoes and was really glad I did, I think the pasta might have been too dry otherwise.    After mixing the sauce, pasta, and cheese pour the whole thing into a large baking dish, cover with foil, and bake in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling around the edges.  Uncover and top with parmesan and bake for another 5 minutes until the cheese bubbles and browns.  SO TASTY!  My husband (who is usually not a fan of ground turkey) said he didn't even know it was turkey until he was about halfway through his meal and I told him!

I made only one adjustment in this sauce--instead of using three cloves plain garlic, I used a whole bulb roasted garlic. I did go easy on the salt but that's really up to taste, not a recipe issue. The kids know this as "goulash" as I make a version of it once a month. This recipe was quite good, the fontina was a nice touch. Honestly there were no leftovers, the boys ate every bite.

GREAT-This is a wonderful cheesey casserole.  I cut it in half and put it in an 8X8 baking dish and baked it a few minutes.I did add some add some red pepper flakes to give it a little bit of kick - it would be fairly bland otherwise.  P.S.  I used the full cup of Fontina for my half recipe.  Soooooo good and cheesey.

Ground turkey was buy 1 get 1 free this week and so I needed to find a recipe that I could use it. I made this and was really glad. I used parmigano instead as that was all I had and it worked fine! I love this recipe because it was easy and very healthy.

This actually turned out really good!!!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I added crushed red peppers to give it more spice for my husband and I but served it without them for the kiddos!  Everyone ate it really well.  FYI- this recipe makes 8 really big servings!  I had enough for a family of 4 plus lunch for my husband and I for 2 days!

I sort of found this recipe to lack flavor.  I ended up adding a little extra salt & pepper.  Maybe fresh basil would be better than dried?  This is also the first time I used ground turkey, so that could have something to do with it.

Yummy.  I used two cans of stewed tomatoes because that is what I had on hand.  My two year old and husband loved it too.

Mmm, mmm, tasty! The sweetness of the Vidalia onion contrasted nicely with the strong Fontina cheese. I used ground turkey breast and no one could even tell it wasn't beef! Next time I make it I'm going to substitute a prepared marinara sauce for the crushed tomatoes and maybe use more than called for, as I like things a little saucy! This was very easy and fun to make, and everyone liked it. Thanks!

Great sauce for this recipe. Much better flavor with lean ground beef, will try that next time. Suggest heat be at least medium for step 2. Low takes too long to brown turkey, makes it tough.

This is one of the best pasta dishes I've done. My family loves it. I know it's hard to find the fontina cheese but it is well worth it. I've dont it both ways, with and without it and love it more with it. I can only speak for myself cause I did see there are bad review about it, but I'm sure its because they didn't do it as instructed

I love this recipe! I like it to be a bit saucier, so I used a large (29 oz.) can of crushed tomatoes instead and increased the seasonings a little. It turned out to be pretty delish! Also, I snuck 1 Tbsp. of sugar in there to balance out the seasonings. I will be using this recipe many times to come, everyone loves it!

This recipe caught my eye because I am always looking for recipes to use ground turkey and I love Fontina! This was delicious! My son said it was the best dinner ever. It's going into the regular rotation. I cooked the ground turkey , onion and garlic all together at once, as I didn't see the reason for cooking the onions for 10 minutes first. I added some Emeril's Essence, pepper and Worcestershire sauce to the meat while cooking. I used the diced tomatoes (Italian Seasoned, 14-1/2 ounces) , but instead of the crushed tomatoes I used a 26 ounce jar of Prego heart smart pasta sauce. I added a little red wine to the sauce and used fresh parsley instead of the dried.I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for some zip. I used large elbow macaroni for the noodles. I followed the directions the rest of the way. I don't see the need for baking it in the oven, like some others did-it was perfect on top of the stove. Creamy, cheesy, tasty and yummy! The bonus is that it's very easy and comes together quickly. Thanks for a keeper recipe! Oh, and I had leftovers for lunch and that was great too!

Made this last night. Family loved it. Really good and easy. I added 1 can diced tomatoes, can of tomato paste (oregano, basil and garlic flavored) and 1/2 jar of pizza sauce. It wasn't dry. I couldn't  find fontina cheese so I bought mascarpone cheese. Used 4 oz. Very tasty!  I used Bowtie pasta instesd of elbow macaroni since I had it on hand.  I wouldn't do that again. It was too much pasta in this dish for my taste. Will definately make again.

So good. I did cut the recipe in half and we had lots of leftovers. Didn't have the fontina cheese, so used italian shredded cheese. You probably could use any cheese you want and it would still come out good. Having leftovers tonight and can hardly wait. Served this with a tossed lettuce salad.

This was so quick and easy to make, family loved it, didn't even tell them it was whole wheat penne pasta and ground turkey (I used Italian seasoned turkey to give it a bit more flavor). Didn't have Fontina cheese so used the Italian Blend Cheese and it was turned out great.

I don't add reviews much, even though I read them lots!  But this one was really special.  Absolutely loved it.  I also don't like it when people change up the recipe and review it, but I had to use what was available so by necessity made some changes.  I added diced green peppers in with the onion saute at beginning.  I also used penne pasta in cabinet instead of macaroni.  I do not like lots of tomato sauce so this was just the perfect cheesy, meaty blend.  Great job.  Now I need to figure out a way to make a healthier version . . . .

A great, simple recipe.  It was delicious.  Even the little kids liked it. This one is a keeper.  I did substitute crushed tomatoes for whole peeled tomatoes because that is what I had available.  Came out great.

Made this tonight, And it went over well with the kids, one of whom is extremely picky eater. I didn't have Fontina cheese, so I subbed mozzarella, augmented with a couple of slices of swiss and Colby jack that I chopped up, since it was all I had in the fridge.  I also find that ground turkey tends to be bland, so I kicked up the Italian spices, and sprinkled on some red pepper flakes, which added a tiny but of heat.   Per another reviewers suggestion, I  baked it for 20minutes in (two) casserole dishes covered with foil, and then 5 more minutes after sprinkling with fresh parmesan. This made more than I anticipated, so I recommend cutting the recipe in half if you're only cooking for two and don't want a ton of leftovers.

My husband LOVED this! I used ground chicken (it was on sale) and whole wheat pasta. I didn't have fontina so I used mozzarella. Would be great with some red pepper flakes for a kick.

Delicious!!  I used larger noodles, just because I feel like I'm eating Hamburger Helper when I use elbow macaroni. :)  I didn't have any Fontina cheese, so I used Mozzarella and it was still very tasty!  When everything was bubbling on the stove, I threw in a pinch of fennel, a tsp. of sugar, and a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  The whole family really enjoyed this dish, and I will definitely be making it again!

I played with the recipe and added some ground Italian-flavored chicken sausage meat, tossed in red pepper flakes, and a handful of frozen peas for color. I cut down on the amount of cheese; used feta and romano. The dished passed our taste test.

This was pretty good for a weeknight dinner. Not something I would serve for company though as it was a little bland. It was easy to get the kids to eat so I will probably make it again.

This is going into our family's regular menu! My picky 3 year old and my picky husband both ate second helpings. I was worried that the cheese might be gooey but the Fontina (which I had definitely tasted before but never cooked with) melted right into the hot pasta and sauce leaving it creamy and delicious! I also subbed in prepared tomato sauce but used the herbs indicated in the recipe along with the fresh onion & garlic, added a can of Italian stewed tomatoes which I crushed up with a potato masher in the pot with the ground turkey. Awesome recipe, paired with a dry red wine and I am blissed out! Thanks Jessica!

Followed directions, except for split half spinach/ half ground turkey. It was great, and will make again.

LOVED IT! I used romano and mozarella instead of the fontina. Used only crushed tomatoes, my boyfriend doesn't like the diced tomatoes. Also used fresh parsley and basil. Let it simmer for at least 20 minutes and it was AMAZING. Already made it a second time.

Delicious!  I took what other people suggested and added a 29oz can of crushed tomatoes and a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes. I combined all of the ingredients together and cooked in the oven for 20 minutes. Even halving this recipe, it mad an entire 8x8 pan.
My husband suggested adding tomato paste to make it thicker and some red pepper flakes to give it some kick.

My family loved this in fact my son-in-law had 3rds and my husband would have loved to have had 2nds but with his health risks he was limited to only 1 serving. I changed it up a bit, I used .. ground chicken, fresh herbs, low sugar canned tomatos, and substituted the Parmesean for the real thing and used  Parmigiano Reggianno ... also decided to change up the Pasta a bit to make it more interesting for our granddaughters and used campanella pasta ... plus I added in a ladle full of the pasta water to bind it all together at the end ... will definitely be making this a regular as requested!

Very good for an easy to prepare weeknight meal.  Didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used a 28 oz can of diced instead.  Will add a little sauce next time to make it more moist.

This was delicious. I only had diced tomatoes, so I put one jar in the blender for a few seconds.  Also added red pepper flakes.  Not sure the fontina was necessary (since it adds unnecessary fat).

Yummy!!!  Used one 28 oz can diced tomatoes instead of the 2 14-oz cans called for of diced tomatoes and crushed tomatoes.  Didn't seem to make much of a difference.

The fontina adds a nice twist on the usual pasta bake.  Will make again!
