It's a novel idea, however in order to be successful, you really need 3 blenders. Trying to do one at a time, even quickly, results in melted drinks.

It's true what MRSMORTON said but maybe if you made the whole batch without the food coloring...Pour some in each glass let the guests add the blue coloring to their own glasses then add more drink to each glass then with the leftover in the blender mix the red coloring in and top off the glasses...Just an option if you'd like to serve this drink..I think the guests would have fun adding the color to their glasses...

great flavors... to keep from melting what I did was pourd each mix as I finished it into a plastic pitcher and popped it into the freezer till I was ready to make the drinks... you can get cheap plastic pitchers for $1.00 at walmart my guests loved these
