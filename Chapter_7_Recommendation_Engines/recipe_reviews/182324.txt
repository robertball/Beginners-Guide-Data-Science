There is an easier way to do this.  We Italians place the green beans, water to barely cover, add chopped garlic, chopped onion, olive oil, sauce or tomatoes, chopped parsley, seasoning -- and let simmer uncovered until beans are tender. It's all in one pot.

I love green beans! I love these even more!! They had a wonderful sweet and sour flavor,with the sugar and vinegar.The cumin really didn't come through too much.I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used garlic powder and let it meld with the oil.It was still really good! Thank you very much!!Patti, These Rocked!!

Very tasty recipe. I wish it didn't dirty so many pans. The next time I may try making this differently. Nice flavor combo, though.

I'm so sorry, but we really didn't like this. I'm not sure what happened, since other reviews seem so positive, but there was just way too much vinegar; it actually made my husband feel ill after eating, and I double-checked the amount again after making the beans and I did put in what was called for.  I myself couldn't eat more than two bites because it was so heavy on the vinegar and I just didn't like the flavors.  So I don't know how, but I feel like I must have made a mistake somewhere given the numerous positive reviews.  Therefore I'm giving this two stars even though what I made turned out almost inedible.  I really did want to like this, and again, I'm sorry to give it a low rating.  But I guess I eat plenty of things other people find unappealing, so to each his own!

Sounds awesome, going into my recipe box! I do plan however to use olive oil spray rather than olive oil, to cut down on fat and counts.

I used an extra clove of garlic (I love garlic). These had subtle but wonderful flavor. Couldn't really taste the cumin but I'm sure it still added the flavor. Sprinkled mine with some grated parmesan as well.

Thank you for posting this recipe, but these beans didn't really have the flavor I was looking for. I followed everything to a "T", but there was something missing and I couldn't put my finger on it. We ate these, but I wont make them again. Hubby and me both agreed this was 3 stars.

This was WONDERFUL!  Per another review, I amped up the cumin a bit.  We only had rice wine vinegar on hand, but that totally worked.  Due to an interrupted cooking schedule, I did the first two parts and had them waiting.  At last, after sauteeing the garlic and adding the green beans, I was tempted to just throw in the sauce and heat all together, but instead I reheated the sauce in the microwave.  Glad I did, because I like those little bits of garlic clinging cleverly to the green beans.  My BF snarfed these up completely before even taking a bite of his wonderfully grilled fillet mignon! Nice recipe, Patti!  Thanks so much for sharing!
