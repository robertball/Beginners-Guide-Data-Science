My grocery store didn't have any chipotles so I had to make do with that new Kraft Chipotle mayo.  Sandwich was very good, it's a BLT with shrimp added.  Super-messy to eat and keep together in sandwich form but everyone enjoyed it.

Yum! Don't be like me and not read the recipe carefully... I dumped the whole can of chipotle peppers into the mayo when it should have been only one individual pepper (I've never used this ingredient before)! My mouth was on fire, lol. I did scrape off most of it from the sandwich because of this unfortunately. The tiny bit I left on really gave that sandwich great flavour! I did not season the shrimp or use olive oil; just cleaned and peeled them then fried in the bacon grease. Also used regular, toasted bread to make the sandwiches. For a complete meal, add a salad.

Wow -nice twist on a classic BLT! If you love grilled shrimp, love BLT's and have a taste for things with a bit of kick then this sandwich is for you. I had leftover grilled shrimp (Best BBQ Shrimp Ever from this site) so I thought I'd give this a try. This was so good - from the spicy mayo to the smoky bacon coupled with the grilled shimp to the creamy, cool avocado and the crisp fresh veggies. This definitely isn't your "run of the mill" BLT.

so many healthier options for substitutions for this. i'm opting for a chipotle guacamole with fat free sour cream instead of mayo, turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, and NOT making this a double decker! waist lines!

This was awesome! I didnt make my sandwich triple decker, just a single. It was just perfect! I only changed 2 things. I did not have avocado in the house so I used the mayo on 1 slice of bread and plain cream cheese on the other. It didn´t have the cooling effect that creamy avocado has, but it was still tasty. I also added 2 chopped chipotle peppers in while the shrimp cooked in a skillet. My mouth was on fire after I devoured the sandwich but it was so good!

Had the parents over for dinner last week and made these sandwiches.  Could not find chipotle pepper so added a little bit of a roasted green chili instead...was nervous about how spicy this would be so did not really add enough, but the lime juice helped to give the mayo a little zing.  I grilled the shrimp on skewers and brushed with EVOO and Santa Maria seasoning...Yumm just by themselves. Had fresh tomatos from the garden...yumm again.  Put everything together, as described in the recipe (had to remember the bacon, as its not included in the assembly instructions...lol)  Used the skewers from the grilled shrimp as large toothpicks to hold the sandwiches together. Served this with grilled corn on the cob.  The sandwich was well loved by all, even my sick husband came out of the bedroom and wanted the other half of my sandwich...lol.  Thanks!

Great! I think it's better than the cheesecake factory. The only thing I did differently is sautéed the shrimp in some olive oil and used chipotle flavored Tabasco sauce to make the dressing. Very messy to eat but great flavor!
