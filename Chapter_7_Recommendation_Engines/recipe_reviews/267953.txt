Great as is, but can be improved with additions of your choosing. May need a bit more enchilada sauce if you want to dip or pour it on top.

I don't make changes on the first try.  Maybe next time.  Everyone loved it.  I bought a quesadillas maker for the next time.  Taco Bell just lost a customer.

I liked this recipe. The second time I made it, I didn't have enchilada sauce, but I had a 19oz container of molé sauce. I also had 4 chicken breasts. I doubled the recipe and swapped molé sauce for enchilada sauce. Absolutely delicious. The molé quesadillas got rave reviews.

Pretty good and certainly easy! Kids liked but I gave only 4 stars bc the seasoning was a bit much even after adding another chicken breast and some extra water I thought it was quite strong! Maybe will use less than a packet next time.

I doubled the recipe and took other reviewers advice and cooked a little longer on high with the lid off after shredding the chicken to thicken the sauce. Everyone loved them and not too spicy. I ll add jalapeños next time when I m not making them for a crowd.

We enjoyed this recipe and made it as stated. The only thing I would do differently is try what one viewer mentioned - taking the lid off and letting the chicken set up a bit before making them so they won't be so runny. Will definitely make this again!

I did not do the full enchilada I just cooked the chicken and put it on tortillas like tacos but it was very good. In the future I will probably add some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to add more flavor.

1 serving is 76% of your daily sodium?     A little high, maybe?   I am not going to even try this one.   I don't need that much salt, and my wife already has high blood pressure problems

It was awesome, but instead of using a slow cooker, I made regular shredded chicken on top of the stove. I also used the mini street taco flour tortillas to make individual quesadillas for everyone!

It was quick & easy just like the recipe said. My family loved it! Instead of pan frying them though I baked them. They turned out great. I've been asked to make it again.

This was easy and yummy. I added a can of mild diced green chiles to use them up. The liquid didn’t really thicken even after cooking on high for a while after shredding, so I used a slotted spoon to scoop it out and let the liquid drain a little before I put it on the quesadilla. I followed my normal quesadilla process and baked them in the oven. I added a thin layer of refried beans because I like them.

I offered both green and red sauce and sides of onion, black olives, tomatoes and extra cheese. Kids and adults were pleased!
