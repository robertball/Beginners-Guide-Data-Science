Amy, great one! I also would like to pass on my changes to this recipe. The best recipe and steps stay intack.

* Replaced veg oil with olive oil
* Used 1 tsp of grated ginger root
* Replaced sherry with 1 1/2 cups dry white wine
* Added 5 small shallots (chopped)
* Added 4 garlic cloves (chopped)
* Added 1 tsp red crushed pepper
* Added 1/4 tsp cayanne
* Added 1 tsp course blk pepper
* Added 2 dried chili peppers
1. Cook aspargus as stated
2. heated oil as stated. add red crushed pepper, dried chili peppers, shallots, garlic, and cayanne. saute still garlic softens, 2 min. till garlic is soft.
3. Stir in soy sauce, ginger and sugar.  Add wine, bring to simmer, add shrimp and saute as stated.
4. Stir in asparagus as stated and salt to taste.
5. I served this over 2 lbs of penne pasta. This a pasta lovers dish as there isn't alot sauce but enough to coat the pasta. so if you like tons of sauce this won't be for you.

WOWWIE!  I've made this twice in the last two days and I'm still not sick of it!  I made this into a main course meal by adding linguine noodles.  What I did was boil the noodles and spears together, then I threw in all the ingredients in a skillet (minus the water since it dilutes the flavor).  I also doubled the garlic, used low sodium soysauce and added red pepper flakes for a kick. Let it simmer for about 5-10 mins and you got yourself an asian inspired meal!

This recipe was FABULOUS, but I did alter it just a bit:
first, 2 cloves of garlic are a must, and adding a couple teaspoons or so of sesame oil with the vegetable oil adds great flavor.  And finally, it makes a great dinner if on the side you cook a pot of Chinese noodles or udon noodles.  Just add finished dish to the noodles! The family loves it!

This was a great start to what could become a stellar Asian dish! I agree with other reviewers, skip the added water, it only minimizes the flavor. We automatically added 2-3 cloves of garlic and 1 cup of mushrooms (YUM!). After taste-testing, would add 2 tsp. of hosin sauce & 1/2 tsp chili-garlic paste before serving. Those additions make this dish out-of-this-world!!

This was excellent.  The ginger gives it just the right flavor.  I made a simple linguini with butter and parm. cheese side dish to compliment.

As other viewers noted, it needed a bit of spice. But I gave it 3 stars because of the combination of flavors and a good foundation.  The first time I made this I followed the recipe (except that I STEAMED the asparagus)  The next time, I tweaked it quite a bit and it turned out great -- plus I like to make things easier.  I added 1 Tbsp butter to the olive oil, added minced garlic, then the fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut (not pre-cooked), then took a shortcut and added 1/3c of Kikoman Roasted Garlic Teryaki sauce, threw in the shrimp & covered for a couple minutes until they turned pink.  Sprinkled cornstarch right into the liquid in the pan for a sauce.  Then making it even easier, popped in Uncle Ben's Roasted Garlic Wild Rice pouch in the microwave and Voila!

This was good; I think next time I'll double the sauce ingredients and/or cook the asparagus in some chicken broth to see if it increases the flavor. Also, I'll probably add some garlic like another reviewer suggested, but it was very easy and tasty over jasmine rice. Thank you!

This was okay and easy to make but didn't really wow.  I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  I think it could have used some heat.

Great easy dinner.  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I also dissolved 1 Tbs of corn starch in the 2 Tbs of reserved asparagus water so the sauce would be thicker (kind of like what you would get in a Chinese restaurant).  I usually serve it with soba noodles (Japanese buckwheat noodles) or brown or white rice.  The sauce works for almost any stir-fry veggie/meat combination.

Like most, I changed the recipe slightly.  I began with cooking 2 strips of turkey bacon until crisp.  I removed the bacon and set aside.  I added 2 TBS butter to the grease in the pan.  Added 3 thinly sliced green onions and browned with the garlic. Then I put in about 1/2 c. chicken broth, juice from one lemon, a couple TBS of olive oil and followed the recipe after that.  It was quick and easy to make.  My family enjoyed it very much.

Very tasty. Used all ingredients recipe called for but grated my ginger and eye balled instead of measuring. I recommend leaving the shrimps whole. I started splitting my shrimp but thought it to be tedious so left most whole. Didnt like the way the split ones curled up . Overall very good.

This was delicious!  After reading the other reviews I noted that some others found the sherry a little off tasting, so I substituted the sherry with a little rice vinegar and the flavor was perfect for this asian inspired dish.  It would have been great over rice but I put it over some buttered fettuccine noodles and that was excellent too!

We added broccoli to the mix, steamed them with the asparagus. We also sauteed shiitake mushrooms in sesame oil, then added the shrimp, then all the other ingredients ( replaced sugar with honey, added fish sauce) and topped with green onions and sesames

This was stupendous!!!! I had some super-size shrimp (10/lb) and just split them. Cooked the asparagus in the microwave, 3 min, and had just enough liquid, and saved nutritional value. Used olive oil, and refrigerated ginger, also lite soy sauce - simple and delicious, served it with brown rice.  Am making it again this week -

As recommended by others, I added 2 gloves of garlic . Thought I had some sherry in the cupboard, but I didn't, so I  substituted Marsala for the sherry. I served this over linguine pasta and both my husband and I loved this. Will make this again soon. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I am rating this recipe as it is written; I am sure there are things that could be done to make it more interesting.  I did not cut the shrimp because I used large and not jumbo.  My asparagus was thin, so I blanched it for about a minute and then added it to the shrimp toward the end of cooking.  Even though I cut back on it, the ginger taste was too strong for us.   Because we don't like chewy pieces of ginger,however, instead of chopping it I grated it, which I think may make the flavor stronger.  Although I couldn't resist adding some garlic, the predominant taste was salty soy.  I found out after we ate that I had inadvertently purchased soy sauce that was not low sodium, which we always use because we don't think that regular soy sauce has the flavor that the low salt does. I wouldn't make it again, but it might be perfect for those who love the taste of soy or for those who want to revamp it for their own tastes.

This recipe was delicious.  I followed advice from other reviews and sauteed the shrimp and asparagus in garlic and olive oil.  Afterward, i added angel hair pasta  and had a complete meal.  I have already made this dish twice in two weeks.

I stir-fried the asparagus (about 3 minutes) with a clove of minced garlic, rather than blanching it; then added the shrimp to the wok. I added a dash of dried crushed red pepper flakes for more bite, when adding the soy sauce, sherry and ginger. We had it with garlic bread, but it would also be good with rice to soak up the sauce.

This was good, with the additions of lots of minced garlic and a pinch of red pepper flake as others have suggested. I too stir fried the asparaguswith the garlic, then added the shrimp for about 5 min. with the other ingredients. The asparagus was especially good, the shrimp needed a little something more.

I loved it but learned this evening that my husband doesn't like ginger.  Who knew after 10 years?  I thought it was great and pretty easy to make.

I found this dish to be bland.  I didn't have sherry but that was all I changed and I don't think 1 tsp would have made much of a difference.  I might try it again and add some spices to it.

This recipe was really easy and really, really tasty.  The only things I did different was using ginger paste as my store did not have fresh ginger(paste available in the produce section and has s decent shelf life.) I also added some diced white onions. This was better than any shrimp dish I have had in a restaurant!  Will make again and again.

I was worried about this, but it turned out great.  My daughter didn't like this---I think that was because of the asparagus. I used ginger paste and it worked well.

Well, with the odd ingredients we didn't know what to expect, but the flavor of this dish was surprisingly good.  I didn't use fresh ginger, I used what I had on hand which was grated ginger/garlic paste.  I cooked all in one skillet (I loathe using too many pots/pans).  I served over pasta.  I'll make this again.

I made this last night - hubby loved it!  I substituted ground ginger because I did not have fresh - I used 3 teaspoons but would probably use 2 or fresh next time.  I served it over steamed rice - excellent, quick meal!

We really, really enjoyed this.  It was a great quick and easy weeknight dinner.  The only things that I will probably do differently next time will be to mix up the other ingredients and let the shrimp and asparagus marinate for maybe half an hour?  Just something to pick up a little more of the flavor, and possibly thicken up what's left in the pan, to make a little thicker sauce, and serve the whole shebang over rice or pasta.

Made this as described and served over fettuccine. I found it relatively easy to make and the results were very good. I think that the sauce to shrimp/asparagus is a little low.  I will definitely make this again trying some of the modifications from other raters.

This is a teriffic recipe! I made a few changes as well though. I used chicken strips instead of shrimp & sauteed them along with some sliced shitake mushrooms. I sauteed several diced cloves of garlic in sesame oil, cooked the asparagus in chicken broth and saved the broth. When every ingredient was combined I added a tiny bit of cornstarch and served it all over glass noodles.

I have to re-review this dish.  It sat overnight in the fridge.  I tried a little of it cold at lunch today and it was actually GOOD.  Grumpy had it warmed up for dinner and he said it's a definite keeper!  I guess some things just need to sit a bit for the flavor to really be there!

I made this tonight for my husband and I and served it over Israeli Porcini Mushroom Couscous. One word describes the meal: fantastic! I followed the recipe as written except after removing the shrimp/asparagus from the pan, I let the remaining sauce cook a little longer to thicken up then poured it over the shrimp/asparagus/couscous.

I used coconut oil with a splash of sesame oil to saute the shrimp, added lemongrass and thai basil to seasonings, and chopped mandarin orange for sweetness instead of sugar. Served over rice noodles. Excellent.

So much like other reviews I also added 4 cloves of garlic, I switched the veggie oil for olive, added hot pepper flakes and for a twist orange juice and peels , with a drizzle of honey. The recipe as is, is a good base.

This was a good basic recipe. I added extra hoisin sauce for the first try. Agree with other reviewers it needs heat, so will tweak the next time. I used soba noodles as a base, which we really liked.

This was a great, quick and low-calorie meal for my husband and I.  I didn't have jumbo shrimp but did have a pound of medium shrimp and a bunch of asparagus, so that's what I used.  I thought it looked and sounded like it should serve 4 but it was so good, it only served two that night.  I'll definitely do this one again.

Other than adding red pepper flake and using olive oil instead of vegetable oil as recommended by another reviewer I made this recipe as written. The pepper flake added a little kick and flavor. Thanks for sharing.

Love this. I doubled the sauce and also used a garlic clove and mushrooms. I also used sesame oil with the vegetable oil.

Super easy, don't overcook the shrimp (lean towards the three mins)

The dish is really good. I used white cooking wine with the recipe. The white wine kicks the ginger flavor. I would make this again.

My daughter made this for me for my birthday dinner.  Our entire family loved this recipe.  She changed a few of the ingredients.  These were her comments to me.  "There were a few changes...I used white wine, instead of buying a whole bottle of sherry; added some of the refrigerated garlic (minced); used olive oil instead of vegetable oil;  used ginger paste rather than fresh; and skipped the "reserved water" from the asparagus in step 2."

This is a very good recipe. We ate it over rice and left the sauce a bit thin to add flavor to the rice. I doubled the shrimp because they were 24-26 count. (It was a bit much, but who complains about extra shrimp!)

Excellent. Followed exactly, but added 1 clove of minced garlic during the last few seconds of frying the shrimp.  Served over brown rice.  My family does not like asparagus, but we decided to try this since the farm stand had asparagus. The sauce made it tasty.  Even my 3.5yr old carnivore ate it (and asked for more shrimp)

I made this exactly as it says to and it came out great, I wouldn't change a thing. My very picky 2 yr old even ate it (except the asparagus) he even had multible helpings of rice with the sauce mixed in.

This was really good and extremely quick! I happen to love ginger so I loved this recipe. I didn't have any shrimp so I used chicken breasts instead and it was still very good. I also didn't have any fresh ginger root so I used two tsp of ground ginger. I also thickened the sauce with a tbl of cornstarch mixed with a little water and served over white rice.

this was ok, but not great.  I made it pretty much according to the recipe with the exception that I used ginger paste instead of fresh ginger because I didn't have it available.

Eh.  It was just ok.  I used steamed broccoli, and 2 tsp ginger powder instead of what was listed, but otherwise kept everything the same.  A lot of ginger flavor but not much else.  Maybe it needed to be thickened with cornstarch - maybe some sesame oil - maybe some garlic?  Not sure - but needs a little tweaking.

I just made this dish, and must admit, it is REALLY good! I'm usually not a big fan of shrimp, but wow! It is very flavorful and a great accompaniment to a bowl of rice. I didn't want to count 24 shrimp, so I just used 1lb. and it came out just perfectly.

I omitted the sherry (since we didn't have any in the house) and it came out wonderful!  I loved how the asparagus came out.
