LIke other reviewers have stated this is a basic start up. If its too bland here's a solution....add more salt!!! Jeeze it isn't rocket science. Personally i would cook down the onion, add the garlic, stir in a little "white" wine, simmer for 5 min, add 6 chopped Roma tomatoes, 2 tbsp. of chopped capers, simmer another 5 min, add roughly chopped fresh spinach (about a cup) and cook for another 3-4 min. Then add some finishing salt to taste. Simple, easy and yummy.

I tried this recipe and it was super easy!  It was a hit with the family.  I tried to use ingredients that I had on hand  with scallops, clams, shrimp, and mussels.  I usually eyeball my measurements, but stuck to the main ingredients for the sauce.  I didn't have diced tomatoes, but I did have a can of crushed stewed tomatoes that also had italian seasonings in it.  Will definitely make it again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

I made it with spaghetti squash for a low carb option and it was FABULOUS. Stuck to the recipe but I added a little bit of garlic powder, simply because I love garlic. This is definitely a new fav.

Meh. Kinda bland for my taste, though it's a good base of a recipe to start from.

IT WAS A BIT BLAND AND SALT DID HELP AND OF COURSE RED PEPPER FLAKES. I ALSO FELT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH LIQUID GENERATED BY THE TOMATOES AND I USED A 28 OZ. CAN OF CHOPPED TOMATOES AND ABOUT 5 OZ. OF CLAM JUICE.NEXT TIME I WILL ADD EITHER TOMATO SAUCE OR JUICE!

I made this for the first time for Ash Wednesday/Valentine's Day of 2018.  I followed the recipe exactly and even added the red wine ( I had dry red wine).  The flavors were all there and I truly enjoyed it, even my wife said how delicious it was.  She rated it five stars because in her words "my husband made it for me." (awe) It took me about an hour and a half to make, but if I make it more often I know it will be less time.  This I would definitely print out and put in my recipe binder.  I highly recommend it.

Based on other reviews we doubled the spices, added about 1 teaspoon of Italian spices.  Also added fresh basil on top.  I could still use more spice.  Also cut down on the pasta to 10 oz for 4 servings.  Will try again with more spices.

We had high hopes, but we were surprised that it didn't have very much flavor.   My 7 year old liked it.  The rest of us thought it wasn't worth the effort.

Made this for my Dad & family for his Fathers Day dinner-what a hit! I did add zucchini to the mix & just a dash of crushed red pepper, otherwise pretty much stayed with the recipe. It was so good!  Will definitely be making this one again! Thanks for sharing!

I added in some black olives also, put the mushrooms in with the tomatoes and tossed the olives in with the shrimp at the end, more garlic too since we love it. It didn't need any cheese, we enjoyed the simplicity of the recipe, really great with fresh garden tomatoes and basil.

This was really bland and dry. Too much onion and way too much pasta. Not enough garlic, basil, flavor, or sauce.
