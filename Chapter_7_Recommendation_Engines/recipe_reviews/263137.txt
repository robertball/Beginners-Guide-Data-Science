After looking at the reviews about chewy chicken, we reduced the time to 16 minutes using frozen chicken breasts and didn’t have the trouble reported by others. Even my picky four year old ate it! Wasn’t too spicy as written so could add more chili paste or red pepper flakes if looking for a kick. Next time we’re going to add cauliflower, red peppers, and mushroom. Could be good with pad Thai noodles too.

the coconut cream curdled and the chicken chunks were hard. The broth lacked nice flavor also

I made this pretty much as the recipe calls (I omitted the cilantro as my spouse dislikes the flavor).  While the broth flavor was outstanding, the chicken came out rubbery (overcooked).  Next time (and there will be a next time), I will used cooked chicken and toss it in at the end and press the warm button. Overall, I really enjoyed the spicy-ness.  BTW, this is my first ever rating and review, even though I've been seeking out recipes on this site for years.

It is pretty spicy.  Just right for me but too much for my wife.  I would add the chili after i pulled her serving out.  Thought it was pretty good reminds me a hot and sour soup with out the thick consistency

Amazing recipe!!!! Thank you for sharing this. I don’t have an Instant pot so I just made it on the stove.  Instead of Thai garlic chili paste I used my favorite curry powder blend. I also used two cans of coconut milk instead of the one can of coconut cream and water. It gave it a really rich flavor and wasn’t watered down. I added cooked chicken breast at the end and served it over a bowl of sushi rice. I served it with a squirt of lime juice and fresh herbs on top. My new favorite dish! :)
