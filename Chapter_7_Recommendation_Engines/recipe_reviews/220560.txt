Really, really good. It tastes very rich, yet doesn't feel heavy. I started prepping the ginger and garlic, then thought to myself, "Those onions are going to take awhile; I should get those going." So, while the onions were caramelizing, I finished the spice puree and cubed the lamb. I also added the saffron threads to the yogurt and let them soften for about 20 minutes. I had just about a pound and a half of lamb, but I made the full amount of sauce—just reducing the chiles slightly. Oh, and I didn't have blanched almonds, so just used regular raw almonds. I think the leftovers are going to be even better than the original meal!

Great recipe, but the sauce broke for me even though I followed the instructions to a tee.  Next time I will try adding the greek yogurt closer to the end and removing it from the heat.  Very good flavor even with the broke sauce.

This recipe is fantastic - it has the perfect amount of heat, and the almonds added a nice crunchy texture. This one is definitely going to get repeated in my house.

I have made this once and will be making it again in two night's time.  It is restaurant-style, but high-end restaurant style.  The sauce was creamy and full of wonderful flavors.  I plan on making it with some onion kulchas and ginger basmati this time.  Truly a wonderful dish.

I made this for a middle eastern themed dinner with my gourmet club, and it was absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was that I halved the heat -- it was still kickin'!  This dish got rave reviews and I'll definitely make it again.  I served over lentils and rice, with a side of roasted squashes.  Awesome recipe and thanks for sharing!!!

My husband and I made this for dinner tonight and we LOVED it! I used ground lamb instead of cubed because it was on sale and the substitution was fantastic. Be sure and add enough salt to bring out all of the beautiful Indian spices. This is going in my recipe box... and I am a very discriminating recipe box collector!!!

Excellent curry. It was so flavorful and rich. The tumeric needs adding in step one (I didn't see it mentioned in the recipe directions) As Doughgirl8 suggested, I put the saffron into the yoghurt to allow it to fully mix through. I followed the recipe through step 4 and put it in the slow cooker for 6 hours on medium. The family loved it! We had never tried curry from this region before...A+! Thank you to "The Gnome"

Excellent dish! Rich gravy with perfect balance of meat to sauce. Highly recommend! Added turmeric to spice purée although where to add it was not in instructions. Used cubed  veal and ground beef instead of lamb so it could only get better!!! Kiddos wouldn't be able to handle the heat, so I left out chiles and it was still fragrant and flavorful! A must try!

I made this with venison instead of lamb.  I cubed a bottom round and marinated overnight in apple cider vinegar, olive oil, and Garam Masala.  I browned the venison in coconut oil before resuming with the recipe as written.  It was absolutely amazing!  I don't eat rice, so I served it over cauli-rice that was roasted in a Chat Masala infused coconut oil.  Paired nicely.  Served with fresh lime wedges, and chopped cilantro.  Dinner guests were absolutely blown away.

EDIT - I have now made this recipe with venison more times than I can count.  There is a lot of room for substitution/addition.  However I would say that the yogurt is key.  I've tried using coconut milk instead, and it's just not the same jaw-dropping dish.  Adding preserved lemon rind to the spice mixture is a lovey touch though.  Do it if you have it!

I have tried hundreds of different curry recipes, and I have to say that this is one of the very best, if not the VERY best.  This is an AMAZING recipe!  I discovered it a few weeks ago and have already made it a dozen times.  I never thought I would be able to duplicate the flavor of restaurant style dishes, but this one is definitely very close!  Absolutely delicious!

This was wonderful!  We had a guest over for dinner, and she raved about it too.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I used sour cream, so it was a little less healthy than it should have been.  Oh, and I used goat instead of lamb and made it in the crock pot.  It took a little more prep time than I would have preferred, but it was worth it.  Will definitely make again!

This is an excellent recipe. I made it yesterday- simply loved it.  I make plenty of curries but this far exceeded all my recipes. I did make slight changes. I pressure cooked the meat after browning it in a little oil and added a small amount of turmeric, salt and ginger & garlic paste. After the meat was well cooked I added it to the ground mixture after the oil had separated. In the end I added some ground almond paste which I had. Next time I would reduce the yoghurt to less than a tablespoon. The curry tasted good even without the yogurt. Thankyou very much for a fantastic recipe!

Really liked this recipe. I thought that the saffron flavor would be overwhelmingly strong, but it wasn't. Very unique flavor - simply delicious, and fairly easy to make. I would make the following minor changes:

1. I would cut the lamb to smaller pieces so that they are bite sized. Cooking lamb for that long makes it slightly tough, and so it's just easier to not have to cut it further.

2. We like things a bit spicier, so we would suggest adding a bit more Black Pepper or Garam Masala.

Great recipe! As someone mentioned, this is very "restaurant-styled" dish - perfect for an evening with guests!

This was a tasty recipe.  I wouldn't say "5 stars" because I am not crazy-blown-away, but it was enjoyable and a nice, elegant dinner for my hubby, who very much enjoys this type of cuisine.  Thank you!

I loved it and would love to try it with the lamb but I am trying to eat vegan for a little while.  I have made it with tofu and also chickpeas and peas and really enjoyed it both ways.  I do leave out the yogurt.

This was absolutely delicious! Even my fussy 14 year old son asked for seconds.  I substituted the fresh tomatoes for a can of chopped ones and I threw in a few small button mushrooms mindful that this could compromise the creaminess of the sauce,  however, it wasn't a problem. The subtleness of the blanched almonds gives it  a very delicate touch. Next time I will try not to omit the turmeric.

My husband kept raving about how delicious this meal was.  He insisted on having lamb for Easter dinner, and since I'm not a big lamb fan, I decided on a recipe where the lamb flavor wouldn't be overly obvious.  I'll probably make this every Easter now.  I used serrano peppers as jwala peppers aren't sold here, and I substituted safflower for saffron, because of the cost.   Also, my blender wouldn't cooperate in creating the paste of step 1, so I had to add a little oil for the blender to form the paste.  Made as written otherwise.  Yummy recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe. I prepare a lot of different Indian dishes and this was a huge hit with my family and dinner guests. I served with Spicey Eggplant from this site, some Naan bread and a tomato,cucumber, onion salad.  Huge hit!  Thank you for the recipe. I used the slow cooker directions provided in the editor's notes. I didn't brown the lamb, just threw it in the slow cooker with the sauce. Will prepare again and again!  Loved it.

I used leftover lamb, which cut the cooking time by an hour:  I just added all the ingredients in steps 4 and 5 together and only cooked 10 minutes to heat through before serving. I left out the fresh chili peppers because I didn’t have any, and I added some yellow bell peppers instead, and I didn’t add the cilantro because my husband hates it.  It was plenty thick enough even with the reduced cooking time. Served it over Jasmine rice. Nicely spicy and yummy.

My husband and I loved this curry, I'll definitely be making it again. The spices in the sauce meld beautifully with the lamb, and I think this recipe would be delicious with venison or any "gamey" meat. I used shoulder blade steaks, and I was a little concerned about the fat and the gristle in the meat, but it all melted nicely after the hour of simmering and the lamb was very tender. I followed the advice of other reviewers and let the saffron sit in the yogurt at room temperature while I prepared the other ingredients. I also added the turmeric to it because they are all together in the ingredients list and it looks like that is where it was meant to be. I think next time I will actually let the dish cool a bit before adding the yogurt because it coagulated a little bit. I used canned tomatoes because that is what I had on hand, and I couldn't find blanched whole almonds so I used slivered almonds, which I think was actually better because they were nice small crunchy bits that played well with the rest of the dish. I couldn't find dried red peppers, so I tried to substitute with 1/2 tsp cayenne, next time I think I would actually double that amount because the curry was very mild. It had a nice flavor though, and I think I may try it in the slow cooker next time.

I made this. It was the wurst dish I ever made. It was so bad that I don't know when I will eat Lamb again. This recipe has turned me off from Lamb for a very long time if not ever.

I didn't bother with the saphron threads. I've made this recipe a few times using lamb, chicken, and am currently cooking it with beef.  I love it.

just a small change, first no Garlic to be added here instead ground fennel as this is the key to enhance the Kashmiri cuisine.

Halved the chili peppers but then it turned out really bland and so it was disappointing given that I used all these nice/pricey ingredients to get a "meh" dish.  Had to add more cinnamon, cloves, cumin and garlic to make it palatable

Based on all of the other reviews something must have gone wrong but there was an odd taste. I threw the whole thing out! The UK recipe called for 6 tbs oil (didn't specify veg) so I used coconut oil. I figured since there was coconut in it, this would be good. This might have been the problem but I'm not sure.  I also did it in the slow cooker (also recommended on the UK site).  A costly dish to throw away :-(

Saffron is expensive and difficult to find. I didn't use it. Next time I'm going to add some potatoes. Great taste and flavor. Perfect with white rice and Nan Bread.

It was hot.  Didn't have dried red chilies so I substituted 1 tsp red chili flakes.  Somehow I added 1 tsp Tandoori Masala.  Since I used a slow cooker I didn't add the yogurt until the last hour.  Wish I knew what type of green chilies that they used.  Mine was hot.
