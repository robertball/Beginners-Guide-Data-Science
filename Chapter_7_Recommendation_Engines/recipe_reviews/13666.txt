Great recipe! 
Like others suggested, I pre-cooked the rice before combining it with the liquids and used oven instead of microwave. Half an hour on 375 degrees without a cover and I had delicious rice with almost no work from me! Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make this again.

Too easy!  So simple and very good.  I did not have a can of onion soup so I substituted a can of beef broth and minced 1/4 of an onion.  I also seasoned with a sprinkle of garlic powder, seasoned salt, and black pepper.  After making the dish, I then thought instead of adding the dry seasonings, one could dash the recipe with a little worcestershire.  Whatever way you choose to make this recipe, keep in mind that it's very good on it's own so it does not need more than a sprinkle of seasonings.  We will definitely make this again!!

Wow! My hubby, myself and my 3 year old LOVED this! I used just a 10 oz can of french onion soup and two cans of the cream of mushroom.  Only 2 ozs butter and cooked it the 10 mins, stirred, cooked another 15 and it was WONDERFUL!  Thanks!

My boyfriend's sister gave me this recipe a few months back and now we make it all the time at home. It is so easy because there is not a lot of work to put into it and it can cook in the microwave while you are preparing other dishes.  However we use a different variation of this recipe.. 1.) Melt the butter in the microwave by itself.  2.) Then add the rice.  3.) Pour 1 can of french onion soup & 1 can of beef consomme on top of rice- Do not stir!  4.) Cook for 20 minutes.  Then stir it up and put it back in the microwave for 5-10 more minutes to make sure the rice is fully cooked.  You will LOVE this recipe!

This was really excellent!  I substituted water and one packet of onion soup mix for the can of soup and also precooked regular rice as many others did.  It turned out great in the microwave.  The only thing I didn't care for was the butter - there was entirely too much.  Decreasing 1 stick of butter by 1/4 would most likely be fine.  The casserole was literally swimming in butter.

Followed the recipe, my daughter liked it but it had way........ to much butter. It was almost floating in it, had to had some whole wheat bread crumbs to soak it up.  Don't know if I will try it again or not.

This was fantastic!  I didn't have 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, so I used a can full of 2% milk instead.  We also used brown rice because that's what we buy.  The nuttiness of the brown rice paired really well with the mushroom flavor.  I think I will stick with my variations because we liked it so well.  Great recipe!

This recipe was really good! I made it for my boyfriend and myself, and he really loved it since he doesn't like french onion. I decided to make a few modifications though. I cooked the rice in chicken broth until the rice was half way done, then baked it in the oven on 350 since I'm not big on making dishes in the microwave. But I will definitely be making this again.

Very good dish!  Only issue was not having/finding a 15 oz can of the French Onion soup, so I added water to the 10 oz can.

Great and easy rice dish. I made this for my 12 year old birthday party (Asian themed) Well short and sweet the kiddos loved it. I did a different version as well on Sunday and it was even better. I used 1 pack of instant browm rice and 1 pack of instant white rice. 1 can of condensed mushroom soup and 1 can of milk, 2 tsp butter about 1 cup of veggie broth in stead of oinon soup.  After I baked it I topped it with parmesean cheese.

This casserole was very easy, and because it was cooked in the microwave I was able to use the oven to bake the meat and bread.  
Usually rice is light, but this side is very hearty.

I really liked this recipe.  It was very quick and easy.  I didn't have any regular instant rice so I used Jasmine rice and I didn't have any canned french onion soup so I used the dry mix and added one cup of water to it.  I had to microwave it a little longer, but it turned out great!!

I made a few changes because I did not have French onion soup and I was a little shy on the rice.  I used a can of beef broth instead of the French onion soup.  I had 1.5 cups of rice.  I then added a 10 oz. package of thawed chopped broccoli.  It turned out wonderful.  I did have to watch it closely in the microwave because it did not take as long to cook as the recipe called before.  The only additional change I would make is less butter.  It was a bit too much for my liking.  Overall this was a great dish.

The fact that this is so easy to prepare and my super-picky 3-year-old will eat it gets this recipe 5 stars. It makes a great side dish.

I made this for The Woman I Love, as a side dish to the Filet Mignon with Merlot Sauce (also on this website).
I was very easy to make, and was very tasty. We enjoyed it a lot. The recipe also made a good amount.
One minor quibble is that it was a little bit mushy, but I don't know if that's avoidable, or past of the goal. But we ate it all anyway!

Five stars for speed and taste!  I made this up about two hours ahead of time so that I could come home and just pop it in the microwave as part of a dinner I was making for a friend.  Of course, the rice soaked up most of the liquid so I cooked it for 10 minutes on 80% and it was done and tasted great!  I love when mistakes work out!!

I don't know if it was just because my microwave is weird or something, but I did as the recipe said and it ran out of liquid after about 15 minutes and the rice on top started burning and getting all hard so I had to stop, and the rest of the rice was still undercooked. It was also much too salty, I think I will cut the soups and add extra water next time. The flavor was nice though, I think I just need to adjust the cooking time and amount of liquid.

I think this was a good starter recipe.  I made this on the stovetop. Mixed one can cream of mushroom, one can cream of chicken with about 1 1/2 cups rice. Let it simmer together, mixing occasionally.  It probably took 20 minutes.  My microwave is old and this would have taken forever to do.

Good change up from plain old rice-my hubby and I loved it, kids did not eat much of it.

This was very good! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers to cut the salt, I used 1/2 pack of the soup mix, cut the butter, added cheese, a little water and cooked in the microwave for 10 minutes and it came out great! This is a quick tasty side dish so preparation for an entire meal was like 45minutes, including frying chicken and making vegetables. This rice will stay in rotation.

My son loves anything with rice so we tried it and I followed the recipe exactly. We ate a little bit, but didn't care for it. The French Onion soup was way to over-powering in this dish. I usually love French Onion soup too. My suggestion is to either leave out the onion soup or use less than what the recipe calls for. It would be good with sauteed mushrooms and mushroom soup or add a little beef to it. We tossed the left overs we had, but you might like it.

I really don't like leaving bad reviews and seldom do, but this was not good. At all. It turned out really gummy, and the flavor of the two soups was pretty much unbearable. Maybe if made with water and french onion soup, but not like this. Sorry.

Descent simple side dish.  Reminded me of Risotto.  Needs seasoning though and I'm not 100% sure what spices.

I've made versions of this before without the onion soup, but just adding milk for liquid. When I found this I had to try it. Since it was spur of moment I didn't have onion soup so i used beef brooth (2 bullion cubes) and dried minced onions. I also added an additional can of mushroom pieces. Since I'm not a huge onion fan it was perfect. Creamy and delicous. I will definatly try again, possibly using french onion soup mix.

This was a great basic start. I changed & added a few things:I don't do instant rice I do regular long grain rice, so since I did that I added 1 cup veggie broth (buy in cartons). Also, I added top ramen noodles only not the spice pkg (I don know in funcky mood I guess). I did not microwave, I covered w/foil & baked for about an hour or so. IT WORKED & TOTALLY AWESOME!! Husband loved it! Thanks Sarah for the basics. Shows to go ya..always play with your food.

The taste was good, but mine needed more liquid and a longer cooking time. It was a little chewy even after those adjustments. Better than just plain rice though!

KEEPER!! This rice was a big hit with my 6 year old who is a VERY picky eater.  She ate 3 BIG servings. WOW!  I also loved it.  Very creamy and flavorful.  I did follow the recipe exactly but I think it would also taste good with 1 can of the cream of mushroom. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

THis was good, fast and easy! The only thing I did differently as include 1 can of cream of mushroom as opposed to 2. It just seemed like plenty of liquid with that and the 1 can of french onion. Overall great and easy!

I was looking for something quick and easy - this was quick and easy, but nothing like my Grandma's Rice with mushroom and french onion soup.  I doubt that I will make this again!

Loved it!  Quick and fast - I used a can of Chicken Broth rather than French Onion Soup.  Added a little chopped dry onion and only used 1/2 stick of butter.  Remember to stir during cooking.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a wonderful recipe. A great change from plain rice, I also used only 2ounces of butter and it was perfect. Thanks.
