Absolutely Fabulous!  I have a bumper cabbage crop this year and was exploring my options when I ran across this offering.

Here are my revisions:  I cut the sugar in half as recommended by others, two cans of diced tomatoes as 1 other reviewer recommended, about a pint less water, a pinch more salt and pepper and one additional beef bouillon cube.  I also added a few extra veggies, cleaning out the fridge of all the little extra bits and pieces.

This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe.  Followed other reviewer's suggestions and added 1/4 cup white vinegar for extra tang, used brown sugar instead of white, added 1 extra bouillon cube, and instead of adding another can of diced tomatoes as some suggested, added a few fresh diced tomatoes from the garden as well as the called for canned tomato sauce and canned diced tomatoes.  I had to cook the cabbage longer than 25 minutes before it was tender - more like 35 min.  Otherwise, I would not change this recipe.

This was just delicious.  I used ground pork sausage instead of ground beef and that added a lot of flavor.  We liked the sweetness, but I think I would cut the sugar back just a little bit.  A delicious and hearty stew that tastes good and freezes well.

When a bunch of kids like it - you know it's good!  Took some of the other suggestions and added 2 cans of diced tomatoes (instead of 1 can) and changed to white sugar to brown with equal ratios -  1/4 cup vinegar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Also, chopped the cabbage and added 1/2 cup instant rice last 25 minutes.  And, used a combo of ground beef and sausage (meat loaf mix).  Add a loaf of crusty warm bread and YUMMY!

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and decreased sugar (used unrefined brown sugar)to 1/4 cup; increased the vinegar to 1/4 cup; added some cayenne pepper for heat; browned the ground beef and drained fat before adding the other ingredients.  The soup was very satisfying.  Hey, it's cheap, easy, goes a long way, and tastes good.  What more could you ask for?

Update 7/08:  Made this using 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup white wine vinegar (that's what I had), and the soup was way too sweet with a weird flavor.  I highly recommend sticking with white vinegar and sparingly using an unrefined sugar.

This is a great soup. Easy, yummy and freezes well.  I use Lipton onion soup instead of beef bouillon and onion to speed up the prep time without loosing any flavor.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Absolutely wonderful!  Nobody could get enough of it.  I used Splenda instead of sugar but don't make any other changes.  It is great as it is.

After placing the meat in the skillet to brown (1st step), I began to question if browning was indeed part of the directions. Upon rereading; It isn't. I see from the reviews, some people chose to brown anyway. A little too late in preparation for me to change, I just carried on. At first taste I found my error to have no negative effect because the resulting soup was delicious. I tend to prefer savory/salty rather than sweet so I took advice from a few reviewers and upped the vinegar and trimmed the sugar. It was interesting to taste the the effect the added vinegar made. I now understand what many reviewers mean by the tang. A whole head of cabbage was a little much. I will cut this amount if I have another go. I added a small amount of fresh spinach in the last 10 minutes. Might as well get some extra nutrients the easy way.  This soup is a great example of how a few personalized changes do not deter a simple, solid recipe. Thanks for posting.

Perfect! This is the recipe I have been searching for and salivating over since I had the sweet and sour cabbage soup from Ella's Deli in Madison Wisconsin 13 years ago! Had my inlaws over for dinner tonight and my FIL had 5 big bowls of this stuff!  Said it reminded him of his mom's soup from Siberia!!! Darn, now there will be less for lunch tomorrow!

FANTASTIC!  I cut the sugar in half, and added more vinegar than was called for to suit our tastes.  It tasted like stuffed cabbage without all the work.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This is a very mellow soup my whole family enjoyed.  I also browned the ground beef and drained it before adding it.  I added one cup of uncooked white rice to the last half hour of simmering.It was even better the next day, Thank-you for the good recipe.

I made this recipe tonight, just to test it out. I've never had ground beef in any of my soups before. I definately did not enjoy the taste of the ground beef. If I changed it with a different type of meat, I would of enjoyed it more, I think. :)

Okay, deducted a star because this is way more than 4 servings. Do the math…. 1 ½ lbs. of meat, a whole head of cabbage 2 quarts of water etc…!!!! I only had ½ a head of cabbage and 3 carrots and about a pint of grape tomatoes (I quartered) instead of canned. Used browned, lean, stew meat instead of hamburg. I used apple cider vinegar (about 1/8 cup like other reviewers suggested). It seemed like a lot of sugar but it wasn’t too sweet. Chopped up the cabbage to distribute it more evenly and shredding the carrots was different from the usual carrot slices or cubes in veggie soups, but nice. Be prepared for a unique international (Russian I guess) flavor. Not standard American comfort soup. Pretty tasty if it is to be just everyday nourishment food for the health or weight conscious folks. Probably would be shunned if compared and pitted against creamier, cheesier, yummier soups or foods…so definitely serve this as a stand-alone dish with only bread or something. It’s very peppery, go easy if you aren’t a fan. All the flavors, including the pepper, mingle well with nothing too overpowering, and in my opinion, that’s what a good soup is all about. Nice alternative to coleslaw when you have leftover cabbage and carrots around. Looking forward to the second day leftovers though and I will probably make this again. Oh..hate me if you will..I always add about a tsp. of Accent (MSG) to soups to give it a little kick.

This is pretty good stuff! Make sure you have big pot or make the serving sizes smaller. Our largest pot didn't quite cut it. It was overflowing by the end.

This soup is one that is easy to put together.  I made it as submitted. I used shredded bagged carrots and a savoy cabbage. One could start off with less sugar and add to get to their desired taste. If you keep it in the fridge till the next day you can take off the fat. Thank you for the recipe. A savory bread might be a nice addition to the sweet soup.

I'll admit, I didn't want to like this soup.  I only made it to use up a head of cabbage.  It is the perfect soup to use up those last veggies or raid the pantry.  In this case, I was also trying to use up some meat in the freezer as well.  And, wow, was this delicious.  The only variations I made was halving the sugar, threw in a couple of sweet sausages because I didn't have enough beef, and at the last minute I threw in a Pho spice packet.  If you like Pho, you must try this.  It gives it so much depth to the flavor and compliments the sweetness of the soup.  Not only is this soup a keeper, but it is a great base to experiment with different spice/veggie/meat variations.  5 stars!  (ps. the recipe says it makes 4 servings - it makes waaaay more than that!  At LEAST doubled.)

This is an excellent soup! I use absolutely no sugar, it's not needed (did it once and ruined the soup). I also cook the beef first and strain the grease out. I've probably made this 10 times, and don't plan on stopping any time soon.

This is a classic Russian soup.  Family prepared it with beef ribs and potatoes, made in the soup- no ground beef.  The meat and potatoes ladeled into the soup bowl, topped with soup and eaten after the soup was enjoyed.  Rye bread doesn't hurt either.

I used 1# hot italian sausage and 1# sweet turkey sausage.  As others suggested, I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup brown sugar, increased the vinegar to 1/4 cup, chopped the cabbage to a more manageable size and sliced the carrots.  I browned the sausage and onions and used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  I added the remaining ingredients including the garlic & cabbage, brought to a boil and simmered 45 minutes.  This was unbelievable!  Probably the best soup I have ever made and everyone LOVES it!  Unfortunately, that meant no leftovers so I have to make it again!

Wonderful, interesting flavor!  This easy-to-make, full-bodied soup became an instant favorite.  Followed recommended changes from other reviewers: 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of one; 5 tsps. beef Better than Bouillon instead of 4 cubes regular bouillon; 1/4 cup white vinegar instead of 2 tbls.; reduce 1/2 cup white sugar to 1/4 cup; and add 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Also chopped cabbage into 1 inch pieces instead of wedges.  I used an 8-qt pot as this definitely makes more than 4 servings which is great since everybody clamored for seconds.  This soup recipe is a 5 star keeper!  Thanks Ron and all of you reviewers before me who shared their ideas.

This is a great recipe and reminds me of a delicious soup that I've found at an out of town Jewish deli.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding a little additional sugar and vinegar.  You can also use sugar and sour salt to replicate the tangy taste.

Made this way based on reviews: 1lb lean gr beef, 5 cubes beef buillon, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/2 cup brown sugar (instead of white) and I used 1 qt plus 1 pt water, and only 1/2 tsp salt.  Everything else was as written. That said, this was a fantastic soup!

Excellent soup.  As I don't eat sugar, and because I didn't have everything to hand, I modified the recipe to use 1 lb ground beef, two cans of diced tomatoes (one was fire roasted with green chile peppers), one tbsp of Better Than Bouillon beef flavor, and half a bag of a coleslaw kit (just the veggies).  After browning the beef and sauteing the onions, I cooked it in my pressure cooker (high) for 10-12 minutes.  Came out fabulously.

I have made this with meat and without, and both versions work wonderfully! I make this all in one step and add all of the ingredients at one time. I took others' suggestions and doubled the vinegar while halving the sugar, and I also added dill and cut up potatoes. Delicious!

This was a good soup.  I used half the amount of sugar and doubled the tomato sauce.  It had a great flavor, thanks

Wow, what a great tasting soup!  Really hearty and satisfying.  As recommended by others,  I reduced the sugar and increased the vinegar – used apple cider vinegar.  Also added couple of bay leaves, Italian seasoning, and two small zucchinis that needed to be used.  Will definitely make it again.

Great soup. I cooked the meat first and used ground Italian sausage. I also used 1/4 cup cider vinegar and 1/4 cup sugar.  Otherwise I kept to the recipe. I make this all winter long and my family loves it. Thanks!

Really, really good meal. I doubled the diced tomatoes, used only 1/8 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 cup brown rice, an extra bouillon cube, and only 1/2 tsp salt.  I also used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb pork sausage which I browned and drained first.  I am going to have to try this with venison, as other reviewers have.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!  The changes I make to it are I brown the hamburg meat before adding, Add 1-2 more cloves of garlic, you can't taste the garlic trust me. I also use apple cider vinegar, which I think gives it a better taste. I use a little more vinegar than called for, I just keep adding tablespoons until I like the taste, usually about 4 tblsp. I use chicken bouillon instead of beef. Also with the cabbage I just chop it up into small pieces, this makes a big difference. Especially if you have young children like me, it is way easier to eat this way. My family just goes crazy over this recipe.Pair it will some crusty bread and you will just be in heaven!

I'm still in the process of cooking this one and I can already tell that it's going to taste really good!!!! I also followed what other reviewers suggested and that's to decrease the amount of sugar. I think I only used a couple of teaspoons of brown sugar. I also upped the amount of vinegar and added a little cayenne because I love spicy food. I may add some more spices to this but I'm not sure yet. I used chopped up pork sausages for this instead of ground beef. I wanted a change. This soup looks quite tasty and smells terrific! It's finished and we just tried it and it's just awesome!!!!!! This is the best soup I've ever made. Thank you for this great recipe!!

This was wonderful and froze very well.  I threw in some leftover pork and some veggies I had in the fridge (green beans).  My husband and mother were both impressed - and my husband doesn't normally eat cabbage!

This was delicious!  I have made it twice now and my husband loves it.  I used two cans of diced tomatoes and no tomato sauce because I didn't have any.  The first time I had some leftover spaghetti sauce and I used that instead of tomato sauce.  Wow,did it taste good!  I also used Jimmy Dean all natural sausage instead of ground beef and I left out the sugar.  The sausage added some sweet spiciness that was perfect.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Everyone looked at me weird when I put it on the table, but  my teens, my husband and even my 7 year old ate 2nds! Instead of 1/2 cup white sugar, I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar; I also chunked up the carrots instead of grating them, and I had leftover pork roast along with 1/2 cup dry white rice that I used. They all declared it a keeper!

Turned out terrible for me. Way to sweet, even though I cut the sugar in half, I guess I should of used even less. But I didn't want to take away the "Sweet" out of the title. I also would of browned the meat first and drained the fat, and also would of cut the cabbage into smaller peices.

Loved this soup. Even better the next day. Changes made: cut the water in half; 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 (and it was still sweet); and 2 cans of tomatoes instead of one.

Yum. This is so good! And easy. I kept it pretty close to the original recipe, subbing brown sugar and cutting it down, also. I didn't have cloves, so I used a little garlic powder. Also, I couldn't believe the calorie and fat content quoted for the original.....I sauteed up ground turkey separately from the soup and used that. I think putting the ground beef in the soup raw is a mistake. Absolutely delicious and the cabbage-hating husband even liked it! Go figure...

Don't often review but I love this recipe. Made some modifications, such as halving the sugar, extra boullion cube, doubled tone diced tomato, used red cabbage (rather than green), used ox tail and stew meat (rather than ground beef), added potatoes (great for making the soup a tad more starchy). I actually use more water than most users suggest and over time just keep adding water, a dash of vinegar, some diced tomatoes, and just keep reusing the soup base until I don't have much meat left. I also typically have a cup of rice on the side to go with it and it's a great meal. Really easy to make and leftovers are always welcome.

Not sure how to rate cause i made a lot of changes..i added half a green pepper, chopped. I used double tomato sauce, and about 3 cups of water, instead of 4. I was afraid of it ending up too sweet or tart, so i added only 2 teasp cider vinegar and 3 tablespoons brown sugar. With these changes, it turned out pretty great!

I made exactly as the recipe stated but my husband, kids and I just did NOT like it. Too sweet and too sour. I wish I would have left out the sugar and vinegar and added some other seasonings and it would have been great. Sorry poster, just want to be honest. Seems that a LOT of other people liked it though :/

I did as many and cut the sugar in half. I also added some cayenne and red pepper flakes(it's a compulsion), and a bit of extra vinegar. And I used all beef broth for liquid. Yummy and filling and a nice addition to our soup repertoire.

I love this soup, but because I'm making soup at a community soup kitchen and some of my people are diabetic I had to make a change. I swapped the 1/2 cup of sugar for a couple cans of beets, it was also quite tasty! In fact my hubby likes it better.

Since hubby and I don't do sugar, I just left that ingredient out. Instead of beef bouillon cubes and water, I used vegetable broth (2quarts). Also, instead of ground beef, I used vegetable crumbles (you can find them in the frozen food aisles).

I've currently got a pot of this simmering on my stove. I LOVE this recipe! Easy to follow, smells delish, and is a wonderful hearty soup for a dreary day. I have modified it slightly: I brown the beef in a TBS or so of olive oil before I add the other ingredients, and I add some caraway seeds and a good shake of celery seeds to it. DElish!

I cooked this as the recipe stated.  Different from the normal american style soups but very good. Taste wise I would change nothing however the next time I fix this I will probably shred or chop the cabbage.  I could definitely see this being a good recipe for someone wanting to eat healthy or diet by browning then draining the beef or by using ground turkey.

This is a very good recipe, it reminded me of a soup my grandfather used to make, only without the sugar. The great part about it is, you can adjust the sweetness without destroying the taste. Also, I browned my hamburger first and drained most of the grease from it before adding it to the rest of the soup.

Everyone loved this, it was a great meal for a windy rainy night. I did halve the sugar and increase the vinegar, used extra lean beef, Better Than Bouillon in place of cubes (better flavor imo) and a very small cabbage which was sliced instead of wedged. I really loved the quick prep for this recipe.

Awesome recipe!  The only changes I've made are using ground turkey instead of beef, and as others have said, 1-2 Tbsp more vinegar and only half the sugar.  YUM!

This was the soup I've been looking for! I did cut the sugar, add more vinegar and tomatoes, but other than that made as written.

Absolutely love this soup! Like other reviewers suggested I used 1/4 cup vinegar, brown sugar instead of white, an extra can of diced tomatoes and 1 extra bouillon cube. I didnt have tomato sauce so I used a can of tomato soup instead and the soup tastes amazing. The only thing I find is that a whole head of cabbage is too much so I would only use about 1/2 a head next time unless I can find a really small head of cabbage

I love this!  The only thing I changed was instead of the white sugar, I used 1/4 of brown sugar (loosely measured) and one extra clove of garlic.   I also browned the meat and rinsed it before I added it into the soup.   I am tasting it now before dinner and I think I might eat too much!  Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG I have been looking for this recipe for 30 yrs!  A high school friend made it one day and it reminded me of my mother's stuffed cabbage except in soup form. (and who swaps recipes in High School lol)  The only thing different is she made very tiny meatballs instead of just adding the ground beef.  I took the ground beef, added an egg and some dry bread crumbs mixed together and rolled them into tiny balls little smaller than a walnut and just dropped into the simmering soup.  I follow the others suggestions and cut the sugar in half.  I think next time I will also chop or shred the cabbage smaller, just a personal taste.  Thank you Ron for finally ending my search.  I will be making this soup again and again.

4 stars from a Polish chef! This recipe is pretty authentic and close to home. I did not find it too sweet or too greasy, like many other reviewers. (Hello, it's called "Sweet" soup!) However, I only use ground chuck which is not as fatty as supermarket chop meat. I used only 3 bouillon cubes to cut down on salt, and it was just right. The next time I make this I will use chunks of meat instead of ground, as another reviewer suggested. My only advice is BIG pot!!! Thanks for sharing.

I have been eating this soup for 6 months at least. The only thing I have changed in all that time is less sugar since the reason I picked up this recipe was to find a good fat burner. Not only is it delicious but also good for you.

Not only is this soup delicious, but it's even more healthy than it seems!  This recipe actually makes SIX two-cup servings that by my calculations clock in at 253 calories each--the only changes I made being the reduction in sugar by half and using 97% ground beef (didn't even drain it)!

I modified this recipe based on reviews and personal taste. Instead of ground beef I used turkey/chicken Italian sausage and sirloin tip cut into small cubes. This was not only lower in fat, but also added extra flavor. I cut back on the sugar (brown instead of white) and used cider vinegar. Didn't have tomato sauce on hand, so I used stewed tomatoes only. Used restaurant beef soup base instead of bouillon and chopped the cabbage as others suggested. The end result was excellent.

Wow.  This is a great soup.  My husband, who is usually a more harsh critic, said he'd like to make it again and rated it 4 stars (rare for him to offer more than a 3).  I think I'd try the suggestion of another rater next time and half the sugar and increase the vinegar although it is very good this way too.  Also, I used fresh tomatoes from the garden rather than the canned and doubled the garlic.

Wow, this is good! I used sausage instead of beef. I also cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup, only used 2 bouillon cubes, and a can of beef broth in place of 2 cups of the water.(so I used a total of 6 cups of water and 1 can of broth) I know it is a soup and not a thicker chowder, but next time I won't add as much water for personal taste. I also added a drained can of corn at the end. It smelled SO good too. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is phenomenal! It is now a family favorite. I used ground venison in the recipe instead of ground beef or pork. I wouldn't recommend the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. Instead, only use 2 about tablespoons of sugar.

I love cabbage soup and I've been searching for a recipe for some time.  Although I did make a couple of changes, this recipe hits the spot.  Since ground beef did not sound very appealing, I substituted beef short ribs instead.  (shred the beef and add to soup before serving).  I also followed the advice of couple of reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar and increased the amount of vinegar.  I used equal parts of sugar to vinegar.  (3 Tbsp. of each)  I think this gave the soup the perfect ratio of sweet/tartness.  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

I love cabbage and loved this soup.  I did change the recipe a bit.  I didn't add any meat and the only can of diced tomatoes I had was with green chiles.  This made the soup a little spicy.  It was sooooo good.  So far, everyone who has tried it likes it.

I needed a soup to take to a church function and wanted to use cabbage because it is on sale.  I found this and made it exactly as listed.  I had 4 ladies ask me for the recipe and my soup was the first to go.  Everyone was commenting on how good it was.  I left the listed amount of sugar and we all liked the sweetness of the soup.  This recipe is definately  a keeper!

This is good, I used stew meat because hamburger did not appeal to me in a soup. I also cooked it longer before adding the extra water and cabbage  to make sure the meat was tender, 1 hour and a half, also only used 2 tblsps. sugar, and vinegar equal amounts of those usually work the best. Yummy that way, but next time I might add celery and some rice and up the sugar and vinegar by one tblspn. thanks godd one.

This was a very good soup and I will make it again. I gave it four stars because my wife thought it was too sweet. Although I suppose being quite sweet is why it's called sweet cabbage soup. Also, I will cut the cabbage into smaller pieces next time. Simply cutting the cabbage into wedges resulted in rather large and not very manageable pieces in the soup.

If you like soups with lots of vegetables and meat (and a little less broth) this is recipe is for you.  I didn’t have a small can of tomato sauce so I used 8-10 ounces of tomato juice.  I only used 2T of sugar because we like a more savory soup & the ½ c recipe recommendation sounded high.  I also upped the white vinegar to 3T & omitted the salt completely.  I thinly sliced the cabbage & added it directly to the pot.  In other words, I only used one pot.  I simmered everything for approx. 90 minutes.  Like others have written, this soup is even better the 2nd day.

I used slightly more than 1/4 cup sugar, otherwise left everything else the same.
Delicious! My husband is not a huge soup fan, but he raved over the flavor of this one.

Very good soup!  We like it more tomatoey so added an extra can of tomatoes.  Next time I will cut back the sugar maybe to 1/4 cup and add more vinegar - it was quite sweet.  But still a keeper.

Made as directed but incorporated a few of my own ideas.
Used two cans of diced tomatoes, brown sugar and more vinegar. I used cider vinegar because I like the taste in soups better. I added a bay leaf and some smoked paprika to give it more of a smoky savory flavor. I only used one quart of beef broth as I did not want to dilute the rich flavors. I prefer the deep red, rich color that the extra can of tomatoes and the paprika add. I did not add the whole cabbage but rather just enough for our dinner, saving the rest of the uncooked for another meal so it wont be mushy the second time around. I have made my Polish mother’s cabbage soup many times but I have never added meat. This is a nice, rich addition that probably wasn’t available when my Babchi was making it for 12 children. Great, easy, fast and delicious!y

I made and served this delicious soup last night, with a couple of changes recommended by others. I doubled the amount of white vinegar and tomatoes, decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup, using brown sugar, and browned the hamburger prior to adding the other ingredients. I did add a little cayenne pepper to give a bit more zing, as well as some spinach. I cut the cabbage into smaller chunks than called for. Next time, I will cut the cabbage into chunks no larger than bite size, as the pieces near the core were  tougher. The flavor was wonderful! I will definitely make this soup again.

SO YUMMY! Disclaimer: I did make modifications based on our taste preferences and food stock, but there is no doubt the original recipe is delicious as is. I browned lean ground beef and did not drain (will skim fat later). Added all veggies in to brown as well before adding liquids. As many others have suggested, I also did 1/4 cup sugar (golden) and 1/4 cup vinegar (50/50 white and red wine vinegar). Veggies included 1/3 head of cabbage, 5 roma tomatoes,3 large carrots, 3 small white potatoes, 1 large leek, 1.5 small onion, 5 cloves finely chopped garlic (we love this stuff). All veggies were diced except for the cabbage (shredded) and leek (finely sliced). I always try to maximize the use of fresh veggies. I used 1 can of tomato paste to thicken the soup and add more flavour. Used 1L of beef stock and no water. For savouriness, I used 1tbsp of soy sauce and 1 cube of mushroom bouillon (all I had), which eliminated the need for additional salt. This is definitely a recipe that will be repeated many times in our household. I probably would be using stewing meat or beef ribs from now on. In terms of texture, it seemed a bit odd to me to use ground beef, but it tasted fine. My husband requested the addition of celery next time.

Made just a few changes, but have some suggestions. The biggest disappointment was that the ground beef disintegrated into the soup. It said to break it up and it was completely broken up!!! I am going to try to cook the beef with the onion before adding any water to see if I get meat chunks next time. I tasted it with no sugar and ended up adding the full 1/2 cup of white sugar. Vinegar used was apple cider vinegar. Used 3 Tbsp. so that's 1 Tbsp. extra. I added more black pepper (about 1+ tsp.). Make sure you chop the cabbage ahead of time because otherwise you will have to add it in spurts (it takes a bit of time to chop). Once you add the second quart of water, you will have to turn up the heat a little bit in order to boil the increased volume. I wasn't sure whether to cover the second boil, but I did end up covering it. I decided to turn off the heat at the end and let it cool down while still cooking the cabbage. I used half of a large white onion and 1 full medium purple onion. I used 4 pounds of green cabbage, 85/15 grass-fed beef, 6 small cloves of Monviso variety garlic from Gilroy, and just 4 of the beef bouillon cubes.

I've made this several times and it's a family favorite. Once I found I was out of beef bouillon cubes, but did have a jar of of Better Than Bouillon beef paste, so I tried that. The difference was something to savor. The flavor was so much deeper than when I'd made it with bouillon cubes, and the paste is lower in sodium and fat. I am a "taste it" kind of cook and found I used  about double the paste equivalent to the cubes to get the rich base flavor. You can do it without turning it into a salty mess. Try this little tip and taste for yourself!  ?????? It's been  several years since I gave that review, and I know fall is here when my daughter 1st asks me to make this for her. We love it  still, and I make it many times thru winter. It really takes care of the  effects of our Wisconsin winters

Couple of notes. Yes, definitely use brown sugar and cut in half (use a 1/4 cup). Double the salt to 1 teaspoon. I also added 1 teaspoon of smoked sweet paprika. DO NOT decrease the water if you are adding rice. I added a cup of dry rice to the pot and used the same amount of water and really, I should have increased it, it's a thick stew instead of a soup which some may like, but not me. Next time I will decrease the dry rice to a half cup. 

I like others I also browned the beef. Excellent diet soup with no added oil.

Good a written but can handle no end of tweaking based on what's in the fridge. I read all the reviews and made some changes off the bat like cutting the sugar. Added carrots and onions and some leeks I had in the freezer. Used some pork sausage cooked and crumbled added to the burger. Used a Penzeys spice blend called Tsar dust for a splash of flavor...

We loved this recipe but I did do a couple of things different based on others comments.....instead of ground beef I used beef chuck that I 1/2" cubed and browned....next time I think I would bump it to 2 lbs beef.  I also reduced the sugar to 2T Splenda Brown Sugar so it was sweet but not too sweet......it was the perfect comfort food and relatively healthy.

I'm not a big cabbage person but I really liked this soup.  I cut the sugar to about half due to a diabetic in the family and it tasted great.  And I used about half a large head of cabbage.  This freezes perfectly.

My husband loved this soup. I altered slightly. I used one carton of beef stock (unsalted) in place of bullion.I did not have bullion on hand.  I also increased vinegar to 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup sugar. Thanks for the recipe.Have made several times now.

This soup was absolutely WONDERFUL!!  I made a couple of little changes, first of all, cut WAY back on the sugar.  I only used 2 TB.  Second, used 3/4 head of cabbage and shredded it.  Also upped the vinegar and used red wine mixed with apple cider as I ran out of the red wine vinegar.  I upped it to 1/2 cup, as I like a bit of a sour twang.  Leftovers were even better!!!

Excellent recipe! I followed the advice of other people and cut the amount of water in half, and added a second can of tomatoes, and 5 beef bullion cubes. My kids loved it, and it makes tons that I had to freeze the left overs! Thanks for sharing!

I did not use butter or cream or flour. I used 2 cups almond milk to replace the cream and put half the soup in the blender to thicken it. It came out to 73 calories per cup and tasted awesome.

Took the advise of others and doubled the tomatoes, used 1/4 cup vinegar and brown sugar. I also added fresh thyme and oregano because I happened to have them on hand and I really think they added to the flavor. This is a really good recipe...hubby is on his third bowl and requesting that next time I add kielbasa too.

We have been trying to find a recipe to approximate the Russian Cabbage Soup at a favorite restaurant. This one pleased us and it was yummy! My husband thought it was better than the restaurant's. My only changes were that I used beef stew meat and a quarter cup of Splenda instead of the sugar. I also added the garlic earlier with the veggies. I thin-sliced the cabbage after quartering it too. I will most definitely make this recipe again. Was really tasty on a cool fall evening!

Awesome soup for a picky pregnant woman.  I made it with 1 pound of beef, one extra beef bullion, 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of white vinegar.  I also used organic cabbage because you can taste the difference but it's a smaller head. Fantastic!

My husband asked me to make him cabbage soup (which I have never made or tasted), so made him this recipe. He thought it was excellent. I followed others' suggestions and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup (might reduce it further next time) and added a little more vinegar, and a bit of siracha for some heat. Next time I will add another can of tomatoes. I will no doubt be making this for him again.

Wonderful recipe. I do want to know if anyone has made it with the ground beef browned and drained first so you can cut out that fat.. If anyone did, how was the flavor?

Very good!  I took the advice of others and added more vinegar and less sugar.  I also used brown sugar.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato soup.  I also added a can of cut green beans and a little less then a cup of rice.  Delicious!!

I scrambled and drained the fat from the ground beef, then added to soup. Was very tasty. My husband was pleasantly surprised. He was not excited when he heard it was for dinner, but had seconds and ate left overs for lunch next day. I will make it again.

We liked this even without sugar.  The cabbage took longer to cook, though. Be sure it is cut small enough.  make a big pot to freeze!  Good and hearty.

This was nothing like I expected but Absolutely WONDERFUL! I added the extra vinegar, as recommended. I also added some onion grass, and used 1/2 spicy Italian sausage and 1/2 meatless ground beef. The meatless ground dominated the smell at first, but did not affect the flavor negatively. It was so tasty I burned my chin trying to eat it before it was finished cooking :)

I was craving cabbage and tomato and found this. I only had a 1/2 head of cabbage so I cubed 3 potatoes and added a can of corn. It was great I think the vinegar and sugar really makes this dish.

AMAZING soup! I did add more vinegar and seasoning, as some suggested, and I sliced the cabbage rather than leave it in wedges. Really delicious! It got rave reviews at our party.

It's not Goldie's but it is close! My husband worked with an older woman when he was young that use to bring him in cabbage soup he loved. I have tried my reciepes and this is the closest I have found. The whole family loves it. I make it in the morning and heat and serve it in the evening as we discovered we like it even more after it has set and been reheated.

Fantastic!!  I changed nothing and was pleased to find the final dish tasted EXACTLY like the Cabbage soup from Izzy's, a local Jewish Deli.   I can think of NOTHING that could possibly improve this recipe.

I could eat this once a week from Fall to Spring.  I followed some reccommendations but here is a list of the changes I made.  I used ground turkey & browned it with the onion and 4 cloves of garlic.  Doubled the tomato sauce, used 4T "Better than boullion" base instead of cubes, 1/8c ea brown & white sugar, 1/8c white vinegar, 3 fresh tomatoes w/1 can tomatoes & chilis & after it began to boil added 1/2 cup uncooked L.G. brown rice.  Sliced the cabbage into 16 thin wedges, added 4 more cloves of chopped garlic, 1/8c more of Apple cider vinegar (gave it a better flavor) & cut the water by about 2 cups (because it wouldn't all fit in the pot).  The result was amazing and a complete shock to my family.  They had guessed that I would be the only one to eat it.....guess again.

Delicious! I added more beef bouillon cubes and fresh tomatoes. Next time I want to try italian sausage instead of ground beef. Great soup!

Tried it with italian sausage, won't go back. This soup is even better with it!

This was very good.  I followed others advice by adding 2 cans of diced tomatoes,  1/4 cup of white vinegar and 1/4 brown sugar.  I also added 3 stalks of celery, oregano, pepper flakes and about 8 oz of tomato juice.  I started the recipe directions until after the first boil.  I then through everything into a crock pot (had to leave for awhile) and let that cook on low for 4 hours.  I then added the cabbage (2/3 of big head) and the remaining water, 2 cups of cooked rice and cooked on high for 1 hour.  It was great, crunchy cabbage, veggies were done.  Next time I will add tomato juice instead of water.  I like the tomatoey taste.

It was good.  We prebrowned the beef and it was still good.  You should chop the cabbage up a little smaller than the 4 wedges.  We had huge cabbage leaves in our mouthes.

This soup was awesome.  I changed a few things due to what I had on hand.  I used 1 packet of onion soup mix instead of beef broth, 1/2 of prepared, jarred pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce, added a little bit of garlic powder and canned chopped beets and used less sugar than the recipe called for.  This made way more than 4 servings too.  Wicked good.

Made this today for the first time.  Enjoyed it very much.  Used quart of Kitchen Basics Beef Stock instead of bouillon cubes.  Used Meatball mix (part ground beef, part ground pork) Added a bit of leeks and green pepper because I had them to use up. Increased vinegar to 1/4 cup, but left sugar at 1/2. Might cut cabbage smaller or even shred the next time. Makes much more than 4 servings, which is no problem.  Love leftovers and am sure it will freeze well.

Just fantastic.  I browned the ground beef and onion before adding other ingredients.  Adjusted the sweet sour to 1/4 c vinegar and 1/4 c brown sugar.  Next time I'll sub a can of tomato soup for the 8 oz of tomato sauce which will give it a little more oomph.  Also threw in 1 can of beef broth for good measure.  Added some instant brown rice at the end (not my fav, but holds up really well in the soup)which was a great complement.  The flavor was fantastic -- this is the def of comfort food.  Immediately a classic.

Yum! I was very impressed with the outcome, of this recipe. It smelled so good and tasted even better. Next time I will more diligently crumble the beef, and simmer a little longer.  I used beef stock (vs.water) and a couple of cubes, also a little extra vinegar.

Ground beef is just not good in a soup. The flavor was rather bland to me and I always ended up adding lots of extras to make this soup more palatable. I think the soup might work if stew meat or chicken was used instead of ground beef, also my guess is stock would be a lot better than bouillon. I don't know why this is so highly rated.

This recipe was much better than expected.  I'm wasn't a big cabbage eater but this soup is delicious and very interesting to eat and I kept finding myself going back for more.  I had a few others try it and the loved it and I passed the recipe along.  Already looking forward to the next time I fix it.  This dish will be a regular meal for me and my family. Yumm!

Love this soup!  I used to make cabbage soup for the famous diet.  This is much better! I followed some suggestions and used brown sugar, a little extra vinegar.   I added 1 cup of red wine and a little crushed red pepper. I used 1/3 sausage and 2/3 ground beef. I LOVE THIS SOUP! I make a cabbage soup with beans and ground beef that we like, so I might try adding a few kidney beans next time.  But maybe not, since this is the best cabbage soup I've ever had!

It was ok, but not bursting with tang and flavor as some reviews suggested, even though I upped the vinegar and used less sugar.  A nice use of cabbage but I dont know if I would make it again.

My update:  Had leftovers in the freezer and just ate a bowl for lunch. Wow -- so good.  original review: This is great soup. Full of flavor.   Delicious. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but didn't veer far. Just minor changes based on what I had on hand. Added a little thyme and marjoram.  I did dice a large sweet potato and added it with the cabbage. After reading that some people found it too sweet, I started with about 1/8 of a cup of sugar.  I ended up using almost 1/2 cup.  My soup was not sweet.  The sugar and vinegar just brightened the flavors.

I added less sugar. I think 1/4 cup would be sweet enough. Depends on how much water you add though. My version had less water and added chicken broth and chicken instead of the bouillon cubes and ground beef. My next attempt will be a sausage version. Scrumptious! 

I LOVE this recipe and have recommended it to my friends.

i should have known I wouldn't be crazy about this since I don't like sweet in my soup- even after cutting the sugar down, I didn't care for it- it tasted fine, I just am not into sweet tinges in my food- those who are will like it.  I just wanted to give it a shot.  Not the recipe's fault.

This is the greatest soup! My husband and I have had it for 3 meals in the last two days and I froze enough for 9 meals for the two us.  I'd give it more stars if I could.  A friend made it for us when we had bad colds.  We liked it so much I made a huge batch of it yesterday.  I had no ground beef, so I put a cheap cut of lean meat in my food processor, chopped it up with onions and garlic; browned it all in a small bit of olive oil. Then added all the other ingredients at the same time, including the cabbage.    The addition of sugar looked a little scary to me so I started in increments of 1/8 cups but ended up adding the entire amount indicated.   The soup was just a little too thick, so I added more liquid - at least two cups - didn't dilute the flavor at all.  It makes a huge amount of soup as I noted above in that I was able to freeze so much but it's so great to have on hand.  Freezes well.  Absolutely a wonderful recipe.  Cheap to make, and I will make it many times over.  Thanks to the poster.

I enjoyed this simple recipe.  The proportions and timing are great.  It is true peasant food so it doesn't get the five stars of, say, elegant oyster soup, but it's a great way to get your cabbage.

This was delicious! I used half the sugar, and used brown sugar, used apple cidar vinegar and used 3 cans beef broth instead of bullion. Cooked it in the crockpot all day on low. Turned out wonderful! Will definitely make again.

Very good soup but a little greasy for me.  I would make again but would brown the beef and drain fat.  I would also use a little bit less sugar.

I took the advice of some others and used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of vinegar, and I added some chopped bell peppers and chopped jalepeno peppers.  A nice mix of flavors.

I have made this twice now. The first time I didn't alter the original recipe at all, except for cutting the sugar in half, as some have recommended. It turned out very, very good, and I was excited to make it again.

The second time, though, I changed the recipe a bit to suit my own tastes: I still cut the sugar in half, but I added a bit more vinegar (about 50% more), plus I added two teaspoons of caraway seeds and two bay leaves. I also browned the beef beforehand, and drained off most of the fat (retaining about three tablespoons or so for flavor). And it was a knockout! It's so awesomely good, this is going to become one of my stand-bys for sure. Thanks, Ron!

Husband's grandmother was from Russia and always made this with pork - never with ground beef. My family and friends like it much better that way.

Great way to use up cabbage! Definitely reduce the sugar or eliminate altogether. I also increased the vinegar to suite our taste. Also a great way to use up misc. veggies in the fridge.

This was very good!  Even my hubby liked it and he isn't fond of cabbage.  I used 2 cans tomatoes, added just a little bit of diced celery, and used brown sugar instead of white.  I also browned the beef prior to adding the rest of the ingredients.  Next time, I will add a little bit of rice towards the end of cooking time.  Thanks Ron for a great addition to my recipe box!

What a great recipe! I loved this soup and had to get seconds. The flavor is great. I used diced beef instead of ground beef simply because I had a big chunk of beef in the fridge and don't have a meat grinder, so I just cut it up and fried it separately; worked out very well since I had pieces of meat in the soup at the end which was delicious. Also I used homemade stock (made out of pork ribs) instead of beef bouillon cubes (1/2 water, 1/2 stock)--a lot less sodium this way.

This recipe is a keeper!

This is exactly what I was looking for!
I'm a vegetarian, so I used TVP instead of the meat with 3 cubes of vegetable bullion and some meat-free beef bullion. Cut the sugar in half and put another can of diced tomatoes, like suggested before. Added a tad bit more vinegar and some garlic powder. Wonderful!

For years I have been trying to recreate the cabbage soups of my favorite Greater Chicagoland restaurants (Melrose & Omega House).. this is by leaps and bounds the closest I've come.  My family is vegetarian so we left out the beef and beef buillion and went with vegetarian buillion.  I also dumped (not a culinary word) two cans of diced tomatoes in because they're so good. To start I followed other user's recommendation of 3tbs sugar + 3 tbs vinegar but then added even more vinegar (probably another tbs) and I love the sour taste.

Fabulous recipe! My husband and I love cabbage soup and I have to say this is one of the best we've had! However, I did leave out the meat bc we do not normally eat it in cabbage soup. Even without it, we thought it was great. I did think it was a bit too sweet for me so next time I will not add as much sugar, just personal preference. Will make again!

This was awesome! The only thing I did different was use italian sausage/ground sirloin (1/2 and 1/2).  Wonderful flavor.  My husband is a super picky eater and I thought he would run for the hills..but he requested it 3 times already.

The broth was tasty enough.  I found there to be way too much cabbage but maybe I used too big of a head?  My husband also didn't like the texture of the beef cooked in liquid.  Maybe it would be better if the beef was sauted first?

Following the advise of others I cut the sugar in half. I, as some one else suggested, used kielbalsa for the meat. I replaced some of the water with 2 cans of chicken stock.  Wow!! It was fantastic.

Wow!  This was good the first night, and still yummy for leftovers.  I only changed the meat, using stew beef instead of ground beef, leaving the other ingredients intact!  We loved the sweetness...

Wonderful! I did only add about a 1/8 of a cup of sugar, which was plenty for me. I also browned the hamburger first. Once it was almost cooked through, I added all the veggies (including celery and mushrooms) but the cabbage. Sauteed those for a bit, which helps speed up the cooking process. I then added the liquid and cabbage, simmered for about a half an hour. It is very satisfying. Perfect for a cold winters day!

I used twice the tomatos, fresh from the garden, but otherwise followed the original recipe.  Neither hubby nor I are fond of cooked cabbage but this is great.  Will make it again!

This recipe was very good with no changes made to the recipe...however we had trouble with the appearance.  Not too appetizing with the ground meat thoroughly broken up as the recipe calls for.  It looked like large grains of sand uniformly spread through the soup..  I probably won't make it again, but it tasted good!

This was fantastic, but I thought there was way too much vinegar.  Probably will depend on your tastes and the strength of the vinegar.  Will definately try it again!

I want to make a remark to your website, so not knowing how, am doing it here.   .  .  I HATE YOUR NEW WAY OF COUNTING THE CALORIES!!!  Why did you start putting the calories for the entire meal instead of each portion.?

This is wonderful!  I had a container of vegetable stock to use, instead of water.  Added a few more veggies to clean out the fridge.  Cut the sugar a bit, increased the vinegar and added a couple shakes of red pepper flakes to cut the sweetness.  Bagged coleslaw mix at the end.  This is just Yummo!  Thank you for sharing this one!

It is surprisingly bland.  My husband ate it once and asked me not to put it on the menu again. My adult boys would not eat it at all.  This recipe had great ingredients but together it was a flop for my family.

i'll definitely make this again, but with less sugar.  it had natural sweetness and the 1/2 cup of sugar wasn't necessary.  probably 1/4 cup is plenty.

This was the perfect soup for these rainy cold winter nights. It was even better the next day for lunch. We added peas to it in place of the carrots. A family hit with some cornbread.

If I could give this soup 100 stars I would.  I have made this so many times I have lost count.  The recipe is wonderful exactly as written however it is pretty high on the calorie scale!  This is a very forgiving recipe and it will turn out great even with adjustments, one major adjustment I do is to always precook the ground beef and drain it well...right there you have cut the calories significantly and if I need to lose a few pounds but still want my favorite soup, I switch out the sugar for Splenda, generally I will start with 4 packets and add more to taste. Personally I think the soup tastes better when the fat is drained off the ground beef and I cannot tell the difference in taste in the end product when I switch out the sugar for splenda, so this can easily be a go to hearty but low calorie staple soup and it is so good and so easy to throw together.  Oh, one more thing, I am lazy, I don't shred the carrots, I just toss in a bag of frozen sliced carrots or fresh baby carrots (or a combo of both if I need to use up one or the other).

I browned a mix of ground beef, veal and pork before adding it to the soup. I had a very large head of cabbage so I doubled the ingredients. Ended up with enough soup to feed the neighborhood.

This was very good, but next time I think I will cut way back on the sugar as it was a bit too sweet. I ended up adding more salt and vinegar to cut the sweetness.

I added some chopped bacon and fresh corn from the cob to use up leftovers from the fridge. Otherwise I made it just like the recipe. I provide dinner for my parents and aunt who are in their 90"s, We all liked it very much.  I liked the corn kernels because they added a little burst of sweetness and crunch.  Different from our usual soup flavors.

I followed the recipe exactly. I will make this again but possibly add more vinegar. It was more sweet than sour.

The first time I made this, my husband did not care for it. With a few changes it is absolutely delicious. Half the sugar, quadruple the vinegar and half Italian sausage, half ground beef. We love it this way.

I've made this several times and have changed it up each time. My kids demand it at least once a week now and bug me to make it every day until I do. I brown the beef first, double the diced tomatoes and tomatoe sauce, use organic beef broth 2/ 32 ounce  cartons insted of water and 1 tbs. of Knorr beef bouillon, 1 lbs bag of  organic carrots .I've used  use red wine vinegar and brown sugar and switched up with  red cabbage a few times.  It's the bomb any way  you try it as long as you stick to the general idea.

This is a delicious soup!  We doubled the recipe since there were 10 people to serve. However we didn’t need to. Now we have a whole other batch to eat for lunch tomorrow and probably some left over to freeze.

Loved the taste of this soup. Like some other reviewers suggested I reduced the sugar by half and also doubled up on the tomatoes. This really makes a lot of soup. Yummy will definitely make again.

My family loved this recipe!  I did make a few substitutions because I was low on or didn't have all the ingredients.   Added kale with the cabbage because I didn't have enough cabbage on hand.  Added fresh green beans, broken into 1 inch long pieces, just because I had them.  Added yellow bell pepper for color since I was out of carrots.  Instead of the tomato sauce, I added a can of Rotel.  The whole family loved this soup.  They've requested an encore as soon as possible!   This recipe has been added to our "favorites"!

I used 2lbs of ground turkey instead of beef.  I first sautéed the onions, garlic and added mushrooms.  Then blended in the ground turkey to cook.  After all was combined, I moved it to the pot and added all the other ingredients- except the cabbage.  
It was a bit too sweet for me so I added some Worcestershire sauce and a few drops of Tapatio.  When I added the cabbage wedges it seemed too bulky so I cut them into more edible bites.  
My husband, mom and father-in-law loved it and my friend asked me for the recipe.  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks!

I will make this again.  I read reviews and used only 1/4 cup sugar and increased vinegar to 3 tablespoons. I also used two cans of diced tomatoes. I decreased water to just 1 quart so my broth was thicker.  Still enough liquid once cabbage cooked down.  I did brown my meat as video showed, but did not drain fat since fat = flavor.  Wonderful soup supper.

Delicious and easy to make! My modifications mirrored many others. I used a large can of diced tomatoes and put in a whole can (15 oz) of tomato sauce. I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 5 bouillon cubes, and an extra tablespoon of vinegar. I also used white wine vinegar instead of just plain white. One of the best soups I’ve made, and I make a lot of soup!! Looking forward to making it again soon. May try some lean sausage for the meat.

Been making this cabbage soup for years, but added beef broth instead of cubes and one bag Success rice; also added a couple squirts of ketchup.  Freezes well and easier to make then cabbage rolls.

I cooked the ground beef partially, by itself, then drained the grease.  It sounded a little to sweet for me, so I cut the sugar in half to 1/4 cup.  I did cook it 10-15 minutes longer because I like the cabbage really soft.   Otherwise I followed the recipe.  We loved it.

Absolutely delicious! I cut back a bit on salt and sugar for our family's taste. DH didn't like the larger cabbage pieces, so I will cut all the cabbage into smaller pieces next time.  Also,  I  misread the recipe and sliced the carrots instead of shredding.  Turns out we enjoyed it that way.

Like everything else there are twist and a little different here and there but if im gonna try a new recipe im gonna pretty much stick to the new ..why not... this recipe was pretty different than one i had made several times and this one wins easily.. the exception was the vinegar which I used more and the sugar i cut almost in half.. preference of taste was my judgement  .. heck yes its good stuff so great for the season but anytime is good for a good sweet Russian cabbage soup and this one gets my vote to make over and over again...

Yummy soup.  The things I did different were to first brown the hamburger and drain it, added about 3 tablespoons of vinegar, cut the cabbage up smaller, and don't forget the sour cream.

Reduced the portion size by half and used leftover roast beef, then added tomato soup, shredded cabbage mix for coleslaw and frozen leaf spinach. Quite tasty!

I've made homemade vegetable soup for years using my mother's recipe and this made a nice alternative. I added store bought meatballs and a package of frozen mixed vegetables to flesh it out. We found it a bit sweet so I would cut down on the sugar next time around but will definitely make this again.

It was ok.   I cut the sugar in 1/2 and added more vinegar  and an additional can of tomatoes as recommended by others.   I thought it was still too sweet.

Great soup!  I have eaten this type of soup while traveling in Russia and Ukraine and this recipe compares favorably with the soups I had abroad.  Like many of the other reviews, I found this recipe lends itself well to modifications based on personal preferences.  I'm health conscious and so I used 1/4 cup of honey rather than 1/2 cup of white sugar.  I used lean grass-fed beef, which I browned prior to adding to the soup.  I added 1 cup of dry white wine and used diced fresh tomatoes rather than canned.  My last substitution was instead of bouillon, I used 12 oz pork stock that I had in my freezer (made previously from a slow-cooked shoulder roast).
I've saved half of this soup in the freezer and I'm looking forward to having it again and again!

Great soup! I followed the suggestion of 5 bullion, more vinegar and less sugar (brown sugar). I also mixed ground venison w/ the beef, threw in fresh green beans and cannelloni beans toward the end of cooking. My family won’t eat cabbage so I have a hole pot to myself!

Superb soup for year round eating!!!  Just tastes like home and is easy soup to make and loses nothing in reheating  the next day!!  Is Really good if use ground sausage instead of beef or mix the  two half and half!!  Can also cut back some of the sugar if you would like, after eating  it  a few times you will get what you and your family likes!!  Spaghetti sauce also works well in exchange  for plain tomato sauce or use diced tomatos.

I love Russian soup especially when I'm getting over being sick.  It's my next step after Chicken Noodle.  I just don't love the $4.xx per quart price.

I modified this to be a little more like the soup that I buy.  I replaced the ground beef with beef cubes.  I increased the sugar to 1.5 cups and added a cup of cider vinegar.

I made it in my 6 qt slow cooker.  When it was done, I turned it down to warm and had a little bit throughout the day.

Excellent and authentic!  My husband spent a month in Siberia on a missions trip and was fed national food while there. He said this soup is VERY authentic and tasty!  I have added it to my favorite "Go-to" soups!  Thanks for submitting it!

Oh,  this soup is AWESOME! Since finding it, we've had it four times in two months...it's been chilly out there and this is a great warmer-upper!  It's so easy to put together; makes a lot and we have more the next day.  The name 'Sweet Russian Cabbage Soup' sounded so interesting and different that I just had to give it a try and it was a huge hit with my son, visiting from Ukraine where he teaches English to school children. The one change I made was to take some canned beets, cut them into thin strips like the carrots and toss them in when the soup was done. Gave a little salute to Borsch! I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed in this soup...unless they just don't like cabbage. It is now a staple around here and quick to make! Enjoy!

I tweaked it a bit by making meatballs with lean pork and lean beat. Also used two tins of diced tomatoes and beef stock, no tomato sauce. Cut the sugar in half and added a bit of heat.. Used the center cabbage left over from cabbage rolls. Great for a frosty day!

This soup is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I used red wine vinegar, added 3 stalks of diced celery, about a cup of diced green bell pepper, and about a pint less water. I also browned the beef because  I had 80%, which is not lean enough to boil in the soup.

Have been making this soup in various ways for 35 years, using beef, pork, or chicken.  My most recent adaptation 3 weeks ago was using pork shoulder meat cut up into stew meat (about 2 lbs).  Reduced the sugar to 3 TBS, did not add vinegar, added about 2 tbs of caraway that was ground by mortar and pestle. For that extra tang,  2 cups of well drained sauerkraut (In the jar, not the can) did the job.  Oh yeah, used Better than Boullion chicken low sodium for the stock.  My crock only holds 5 quarts, so could only fit about 3/4 of the fresh cabbage in.  Crock pot cooking on low for about 7-8  hours.  Really yummy, even my son's friend had 3 helpings!
 We usually serve this over mashed potatoes or rice, with a dollop of sour cream.

We loved this soup.  I accidentally added the chopped garlic in the beginning and I used about a Tbls of lemon pepper instead of salt and pepper,  Then (oops!) I misread the white vinegar and used white cooking wine instead of white vinegar but we still loved it,  I used 1 quarter cup brown sugar and one quarter cup cooking wine.  We are not big fans of lots of tomato sauce so I added another can of diced tomatoes and did not add the tomato sauce.  Seems to me this is an excellent recipe for  adapting to personal preferences and for those of us who don't always follow instructions diligently.

I replaced the sugar with granulated Splenda and cut the cabbage into bite size pieces instead of wedges. It came out perfect, the hubby and I both ate 2 bowls. It made enough to fill soup bowls as a lunch meal prep for the week as well. My husband added Tabasco however I thought it was good without it. Will definitely be making this again!

Great flavor and easy to make.  Will definitely make it again.   I decreased sugar to 1/4 cup and increased vinegar to a 1/4 cup.  Also only used 6 cups of water total which makes a thicker soup which we really like.

I made this recipe as it was written, but perhaps for the fact I had another 1/2 of lean ground beef extra and added the garlic in the beginning and not at the time the cabbage is added. I also used Savoy cabbage. 

My husband really enjoyed the soup and had a second bowl - he had told me ahead of time he wasn't thrilled with the concept, but was proven wrong. Ha! :)

Next time I make this I will definitely add more carrots and another can of tomato sauce and diced tomatoes because I think they would have made the soup heartier. The Savoy was the right choice. I'd also opt to switch to brown sugar and add a tiny bit more vinegar. All said, this recipe is a keeper.

Delicious and hearty soup. I had this at a restaurant and attempted to replicate, and this recipe was a perfect starting point. I used 1/2 lb. of chopped pastrami instead of ground beef (added towards the end), and used 1/3 cup of both white vinegar and white sugar for a more tangy flavor. This is going to be a new winter favorite :)

I doubled the tomato sauce, increased the vinegar, used diced tomatoes with chilis. I will reduce the sugar a little next time - personal preference. I did vegetarian and did it all in a crockpot overnight.

This was a wonderful addition to my soup repertoire!  I added two cans of red kidney beans to give it even more fullness! The flavor is exceptional and my family and friends loved it.  I served some Krusteaz Southern cornbread from my iron skillet.... A super meal!!!

I have made this soup so many times now that I have the recipe memorized! My Russian husband eats this up, and says it's some of the best soup he's ever had! And my picky three year old can't get enough of it, either. Hands down, one of the best recipes I've ever found.

I’ve made this numerous times and it always turns out delicious.  I’ve made substitutions, added various veggies, frozen it, reheated it and it still turns out wonderful.  I decrease the salt by less than half what is called for and added a tablespoon of vinegar and don’t miss the salt at all.  This is my “go to” soup for winter.  Usually double up the recipe and freeze several pints.

WE LOVED IT!  I basically followed the recipe with just a few changes.
- I used about half of the water called for but I prefer thicker soups. 
- Used an extra beef cube.
- Added extra vinegar based on tasting it.
- I cooked it a bit longer so the cabbage would completely cook.
Also, whenever I cook cabbage I remove the first 15 or so outer layers and rinse them well to remove any sandy grit that is often on it.
I would make this again!!

WONDERFUL soup.  I've never had such yummy cabbage soup. The flavor was very rich.  The sweetness was well balanced by the vinegar.  I will certainly make again.  The only thing I would do differently is cut the cabbage into smaller pieces. Great job to the author!

The first time a made this, I was lacking several ingredients. I had a large head of cabbage that was getting old, a pound of 80/20 ground beef, less than 1 quart of beef broth, 2 envelopes of dried onion soup mix, no bullion, no tomato sauce and no carrots. I added 1/4 C each brown sugar & white vinegar as others had suggested and my soup was really good. I could taste the sweet/sour and it froze beautifully. I made it a second time tonight using 2 quarts of beef broth, a package of shredded  carrots and had 1 1/2 lbs. of pork sausage along with the rest of the ingredients called for. This time I used white sugar. I was astonished at how much better it was! This is the best soup I have ever made, except for the taco soup from this website. This is going in my rotation. Thank you for this recipe!

I took everyone's advice and cut down the sugar and vinegar. I used beef broth and a can of beef consomme for a bit more than half the liquid, and water for the rest. If I do it again I'll use a bit more salt, as I didn't salt it because of the broth and consomme. I also doubled the diced tomatoes, but didn't use the tomato sauce. I will add the tomato sauce next time, as it needed a bit more flavor. I used a piece of beef chuck that was on sale, and it was quite good. Definitely use an 8 quart pot with this recipe!

This was delicious!  I did a couple things differently.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and I browned it first with the boullion.  I also used half the sugar.  The first time I made it I used the full amount of sugar and even though it was absolutely delicious, my husband and I both agreed it would be just as good with less sugar.  Makes a large pot and tastes even better on day 2.

This recipe is delightful!  I did make some changes after reading several reviews.  Instead of tomato sauce I used tomato soup.  Added 1 package of beefy onion soup mix, 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes and 2 pinches of red pepper flakes.  Will definitely make this again.

I've made a similar recipe many times since I first saw this recipe a few years back.  This is my husband's favorite soup.  Since he is diabetic, I use Splenda instead of sugar and it works just fine.  I always sauté beef, onions and garlic together before adding to the soup and I cook the cabbage in chicken broth before adding to the soup.   I usually throw in leftover brown rice too.  It is even better when made with fresh summer tomatoes or those you canned last winter.  I also use low sodium liquid broths instead of bouillion cubes to reduce the sodium.  Try this recipe and adapt as needed and make it your own.    The only "rule" I've found is to keep the sweetener and vinegar equal amounts for best flavor.  I use white vinegar.  Thanks for  a fantastic recipe.

Just made this I wasn't sure about the sugar based on other reviews so I decided to just add about four tablespoons of brown sugar. I am very happy with the taste. I will be a favorite at my house now.

My healthier version of this tasted great.  I used just 1/4 pound of beef plus 1/4 pound crumbled veggie beef.  1/8 cup sugar, no bullion, 1 tbsp vinegar, and 1/2 tsp salt.

4.5 stars! This is wonderful as is. I prefer to use kielbasa instead of ground beef, omit the tomato sauce, and add 2tsp SWEET smoked paprika.

I've made this several times - we love it.  I did take the advice of others and cut the sugar in half and added vinegar for tang.  I also only use beef broth (or chicken if I don't have beef).  We always eat this until it's gone. It's a family favorite.

This was a nice new soup to try. I browned the beef separately first and also reduced the sugar by at least half. I divided the recipe in half since it was just for me.

This is the closest I have come for a good recipe for a cabbage soup similar to that at Ella's Deli in Madison, Wisconsin.  I used a different beef and beef stock, plus cooked it a LOT longer than the recipe called for, but it will be my go-to cabbage soup recipe.  I didn't feel the carrots added much, so I might delete them next time.

This is a very delicious, hearty soup.  I used ground turkey and chicken broth instead of the beef and beef bouillon  base, scaled back the sugar a bit, added more carrots and some celery as well.  This made a LOT of soup, but it should freeze well.  Will definitely make again!

I make a double batch of this every fall and keep some on hand for quick meals throughout the winter.  Love it.  Especially good with garden fresh cabbage.  I agree with halving the sugar.  I use a good bit of maple syrup instead of white sugar and cider vinegar instead of white.  I also spice it up a bit more than the recipe calls for.  Delicious!

So so so good! I made it last week and savored the leftovers for a few days. My husband wasn't a huge fan, so more for me! The only adjustment I made was using fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned.

Love this soup!  I started with the basic recipe.  I used brown sugar rather than white , added a can of beans and used vegetable broth rather than beef.  The sweetness and tang are perfect.  This soup freezes well .  The soup goes well with crust bread and cheese .  A perfect meal anytime

A delightful meal.  Did as others recommended with 1/4 cup brown sugar and apple cider vinegar.  Had rice wine vinegar available if anyone wanted more sour.  This is easy and yummy.   A keeper.

I just made this and ate the first bowl, and everything was really good except the amount of sugar. It was way too sweet. I think 1/4 cup should suffice. And maybe a little extra vinegar.

Aside from being sweet, I could find no other flavor in this soup. I'm very confused about what I just ate. I love flavor, so maybe it is just not my cup of tea. I won't be making it again.

This recipe was so tasty! I can't wait to make it again. It was perfect for my husband, but I plan on putting a little less sugar in it for next time. Other than that, and that is just a personal thing, it was the best.

My daughter found this recipe first and we cooked it together exactly as written. I have now used the recipe about four/five times and, of course, made some changes (that's the reason for the four stars). Use four cups of beef stock (preferrably homemade or beef concentrate base to four cups of water), very finely sliced carrots instead of shredded and add onions, carrots and garlic to saute with beef. We don't care to struggle with wedges of cabbage so coarsely chopped itinto bitesize pieces. And replaced the salt and pepper with 1 teaspoon of homemade seasoned salt. I don't have a pot large enough to accommodate that second quart of water and thought it made the soup too watery. You can always add more water to taste when reheating.

This recipe has become a staple of my home. I always have it either in my fridge or my freezer. I have tried others comments on adjusting the sugar/vinegar and/or adding tomatoes/rice...and it doesn't matter what you do, this recipe tastes great!! I personally substitute Splenda for sugar and ground Turkey for the ground beef. So good for you!

my family, church , and friends love this recipe!! i have made it exactly as it is and it was great. I like many others usually add my own twist. I love the health benefits of wild game, i make this with venison. I use to quart jars of fresh canned tomatoes from our garden, 1/4 cup of white vinegar,I also put 2 cubes of Knorr smoked jalapeno cubes in it with 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I like some spice to the sweet.Now no event is good without it, if I show up without it I get fussed at. wonderful!!!!!  I know some of you will fuss because I changed it but even without my changes its awsome!

I kinda liked this but it was just a bit to sweet for me . My wife didnt like it at all, she said next time to leave out the sugar and it would be a lot better. Maybe next time I'll try using half the sugar.

Great recipe !  Didn't change too much except a little more vinegar.  I've made this several times and my grandpa would be proud.  He was from Lithuania and made a cabbage soup similar to this.  He used to serve it with a boiled potato and sometimes a slice of rye bread with butter.  A whole meal in itself especially in cold, nasty winter weather.

This recipe is now a family favorite. It warmed my whole family up on this cold winter day. I made a few changes, but this recipe is a great place to start from. My DH is allergic to garlic and onions so I left those out. I used 1/4 cup white vinegar and 1/4 of light brown sugar instead of the white. I also added 1/4 of Merlot. Next time I would cut the cabbage into smaller wedges. Enjoy!

I added about three times the amount of vinegar because I like it quite tangy. Was really really good!

Amazingly delicious and easy!  I followed the recipe and it was very easy to make and tasted like you had toiled over the stove all day.  I have made this twice already and plan to make it at least once a month.  My daughter loved it and she is a very fussy eater :)

I have made this soup four times now and it is a huge hit.  Each time I make it I have slightly varied the ingredients, I use pork pan sausage because we butchered hogs and I have so much ground pork.  I use lots of garlic and onions and cabbage, and some potatoes, carrots, celery and chicken bullion.  The key is the vinegar and the sugar to give this soup that saurkraut taste.  I have also made a batch with caroway seeds added but they look a bit much like insects so I would reserve that for family members who are aware.  I love this soup!

Good... We aren't huge meat eaters, so I only added a lb of pork sausage. Also, I messed up on the amount of sugar (put too much in), so I added some water, threw in some more veges, and added more onions. It smells delish.

This soup is absolutely wonderful.  I had way too much cabbage on hand, and to be honest I'm not a huge fan, but this soup changed all that.  I put all the veggies in the food processor to make it easier to chop.  I also put brown/white rice on the bottom of the bowl and ladled the soup on top- beautiful.  Thank you for this recipe.

We used .25 c. sugar & .25 c. vinegar like the previous reviewers recommended.  It was good.  It was actually still a little sweet for my taste.  I will probably use less sugar next time I make this.  I will be making it again.  Good with some crusty bread and butter.

Good base recipe or a family taste well remembered just as it is.  I influenced this recipe based on my own taste.  Make sure you have rye bread or your favorite bread to dip and eat along side.  I added a bay leaf and fresh parsley.  I used chicken stock instead of water and added a pound of ground pork.  Since we are not baking...just taste and work your dish off of the recipe.  Also, the liquid measurements are way off.  Use less and add if you need to.

OMG this is one of the best soups I have ever made! It had just the right amount of sweetness to it. And since I am vegan/vegetarian, I used Boca "meat" crumbles, and vegetable broth in place of beef boullion and water. Fabulous!!!

Great recipie! I was going to make my mom's cabbage soup but  wanted to jazz it up some so I looked and this seemed perfect. I looked at the reviews and took sum suggestions I added what was a total of 7 (yes seven) boullion cubes (I like my food flavorful!!) used green onion instead reduced brown sugar to little less than 1/4c and 1/4c of white vinegar maybe next time will only use the 2 tblsp. also used very small amount of the salt (because of the 7 boullion cubes)I also left out the tomato sauce due to my husbands diet. overall really good served with warm buttery sourdough bread.

I have made this two ways, one with 1lb ground round beef and 1lb sausage and one with about 2 lbs of original style sausage from a local meat market named Hoffman's meats. Both ways are good, but I think the beef helps bulk the flavor up more than just sausage. Also just used a jar of not-too-chunky spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce since I didn't have any. I also add a few cubed waxy potatoes sometimes. I start with 1/4 Cup sugar and taste from there to see how sweet I want it. And I use apple cider vinegar instead of white, I think it's a nice flavor. It was delish. As the cabbage began to dissappear I added swiss chard to it to bulk it up. I also made the broth from water I had cooked the swiss chard in, instead of plain water which made it even more hearty. I have added cooked cork screw noodles toward the end as well to keep stretching it and it's as tasty as ever. Don't forget to salt your pasta water for your noodles or they'll make the soup seem bland, and over cook them just a touch so they don't suck up too much broth.

Very good.  I like adding 1 lb of hamburger and 1 lb of pork.  I can't stop eating this once I make it.  Either way I like to add at least 2 lb of meat.  I thought original was a little short for my taste as a meat lover.  Plus I felt funny chopping two frozen Costco hamburger patties to get it to the 1.5 lb.

My Russian friend makes this soup, but with chicken. When she didn't have tomatoe sauce she used katchup and didn't put sugar in it. Sooo good! And like like another rater said, you crave it after you finish just a bit. I don't think she put bulion in hers, but then again, she did cook the chicken in it. I am going to try the recipe myself and will update my review then.

Used brown sugar like others had recommended but I think it turned out a little too sweet for me. Substituted a can rotel for the canned tomatoes to spice it up. Also added a coupole extra tablespoons of vinegar per suggestions. after modifications this turned out pretty good, I will use less sugar next time though.

This soup was really delicious.  We follow a South Beach diet life style, so we used one quarter cup Splenda and omitted the carrots to make it phase 1.  Also added extra boullion cube,one quarter cup vinegar, some cayenne and some tomato sauce.

I can't believe this recipe got such rave reviews!  I followed the directions aside from reducing the sugar to 1/3 cup and it was still so sweet I couldn't stand it.  Nobody in my family liked it aside from my husband and he'll eat anything.  I suppose it's my mistake since "sweet" is in the title, but be prepared.

This was good but I didn't think it was great.  It was a bit too sweet for me.  It made WAY more than 4 servings, which is good.  We are a family of 6 and we have enough leftovers for dinner tonight.  My husband loved it, which is strange because I usually have more of a sweet tooth than he does.

MMMMM.  I liked this - a bit too sweet.  I would cut back on the sugar next time.  I 1.5 x the recipe, descreased the onions, and it turned out fine.  I would also add more cabbage and less beef.  VERY flavorful.

Great simple, filling soup - perfect for cold autumn evenings. The only change from the recipe I made was to use garlic powder instead of garlic cloves because I was out of fresh garlic.

I love the flavor of this soup.  The change I would make next time is to shred the cabbage or cut smaller pieces of cabbage instead of wedges. Other vegetables could be added, but a delicious recipe as is.

This soup was really good and easy to make.  I only used half the amount of cabbage suggested and it was plenty.  I also browned the beef and onions before making the soup.

It is so hard for me to give a negative review...but this soup didn't do it for us.  It actually made us fill ill after eating it.  I will say I followed the reviews and added extra vinager so maybe we would have liked it if we would have followed the recipe.  The tastes did remind me of cabbage rolls (which I like) but it was lacking the heartiness of cabbage rolls.  If I ever make it again I will use less vinegar and add rice to try to balance it out.

Excellent flavor.  My entire family loves stuffed cabbage but I rarely make it because its too time consuming.  This is a perfect substitution and the whole family agrees.  I used 6 bouillon cubes for more flavor, 2 cans of diced tomatoes and extra vinegar.  Left out the sugar and instead added a few jalapenos for a slight kick.

I make this recipe so often I know it by heart.  For a less filling meal, omit the ground beef.  Still has plenty of flavor. I substitute balsamic vinegar for the white vinegar, and omit the suagar and salt.

Delicious!  I made it with pork because I didn't have ground beef.  I also cut the cabbage into chunks instead of quarters.  It was very yummy!

Excellent recipe !  There's a Chinese restaurant (not Russian) that I frequent, and they serve this same soup and I just love it. They just call it tomato cabbage soup. I've tried to make it by trial and error, and something always missing. Came across this recipe and its on-spot and even better.  I did have to get the right combination of sugar and vinegar to my liking because I like it more tangy, but after three times making it, got it to my preference. Added some cubed potatoes once and had it with some rye bread w/butter and it was a great supper meal. Thanks for sharing !

So delicious! Now I can enjoy the tangy sweetest of stuffed cabbage in an easier fashion. I added more tomatoes and sauce like others and I suggest chopping the cabbage before throwing it into the soup.

Use only 1/2 of the sugar it calls for and it will be perfect. 

Reminds me of the soup my mom made when I was younger.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  Hubby loves, loves it!

This is an excellent recipe. I reduced the sugar slightly, and chopped the cabbage coarsely. Wedges are way too difficult to eat with a spoon.

This is really good.  I substituted the sugar for splenda and left out the salt, but it still tasted great.  I also used turkey sausage as the meat.  I served it over rice and I will definately make this again!

Really great flavor. I also halved the sugar and I added a bit of chili because I like a little heat. The sweet and spicy went well together but don't put in too much chili or you will loose the fabulous flavors this soup already has. Also, if you have the time, allow the flavors to permeate through the dish over night and serve it the next day. I also tried it cold, and it was actually really nice too.

This soup was a big hit with my big family.  Great taste! The only suggestion I have is to brown the ground beef in a separate pan, DRAIN GREASE, then add to the soup.  Cooking the beef directly in the soup made it really greasy. I will definately keep this recipe.

Very good with minor changes to our taste - added 2 lbs of beef and would add more next time and cut the sugar in half.  This would be a great soup even without the sugar.  We enjoyed it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good.  Used 2 cans of tomatoe sauce and a large can of crushed tomatoes.  Used beef broth instead of cubes.  Used about 1/3 cup sugar and about 1/8 cup splenda.  Great winter soup - thanks for sharing!

I thought this soup was great!  I'm counting calories, so like some of the others, I halved the sugar and it was perfect.  I also: browned and drained the meat first, used 2 cans Delmonte diced tomatoes with oregano, garlic & basil, omitted the 2nd quart of water (I like my soups a little thicker), and added 1 small packet of "Sazon Goya" (found in the spanish aisle, foil packets of seasoning you can add to any dish).  It was delicious!  For ease, I used 1/2 bag of the pre-shredded cole slaw mix, added during the last 20-30 mins.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I cut the sugar in half, doubled the tomato sauce, and added a little stew beef.  A cabbage soup never tasted so good.  It's a winner.

I miss my Mom's Sweet & Sour Stuffed cabbage. This receipe sound pretty close to what I remembered as a child except the beef was rolled into the cabbage. She also used sour salt which I have not idea if they still make. I did cut the sugar to 1/4 or so and added an extra teaspoon of vinager. This came out pretty good. Not like Mom's but pretty close. I will make again but will tweek and make thicker. I rate this as 4.5 stars and simple.

I was looking for a recipe similar to the soup I get at a local family restaurant - and this comes really close!!  I had no ground beef on hand, so I made it vegetarian style - meatless.  To make up for the space I just used extra carrots, onions and cabbage.  Simply wonderful.  Though the restaurants version is a tad on the thicker side, this worked just as well for me.  A definate keeper!!!
