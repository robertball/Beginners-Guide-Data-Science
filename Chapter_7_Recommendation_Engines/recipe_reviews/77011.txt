if you want added spicyness, use a can of diced tomatoes with green chillies. the white beans & broth compliment this nicely i used italian spices, and a pince of turmeric & garam masala insttead of rosemary.  I also used tortelini instead of small pasta. delicious!

This was surprisingly delicious and very authentic tasting.  I just changed a couple of things.  I started with chicken broth in a box, used 'Italian' tomatoes with garlic, basil and onions and tossed in a can of chunk chicken white meat.  Also added some garlic.  A great emergency meal from the cupboard.

This is a great recipe.  I did not use the Fast Chicken Stock recipe -- used Better Than Boullion brand chicken base, cooked two skinless chicken breasts in the pressure cooker with the tomatoes and herbs (used fresh rosemary and dried thyme) and added two cloves of fresh garlic.  Added the white beans, pasta and a little salt/pepper when the chicken was cooked.  It was really good -- especially on a chilly night!  I made this a second time today and doubled the recipe.  This time did not put chicken in it.  It was declicious.  Again, used fresh garlic sauteed in olive oil.  This time added some white wine and a little bit of oregano as well.  Wonderful!

I used orzo pasta in my homemade chicken broth, and instead of using canned tomatoes I diced some plum tomatoes from the garden.  This is very simple and very good.

It was pretty fabulous. I switched out chicken broth for the soup base used a different kind of pasta.   But other than that followed the recipe and use the ton of Parmesan on top & it was out of this world!
