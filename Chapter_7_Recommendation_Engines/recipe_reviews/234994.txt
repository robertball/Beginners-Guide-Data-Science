This has officially become our favorite holiday dessert.  No more plain ol Pumpkin Pie for this family!  The crust is a little too sweet for my taste, so I think I'll cut down the sugar a bit next time we make it.  Other than that, it was easy to make and simply delicious.

I have made slush cake with chocolate pudding-originally named for the huge blizzard of 1972 in Buffalo, NY. Thus one uses more sugar. I would cut down the amounts and eliminate it in the crust altogether. It was very good but too sweet for me.

Easy to make and it was a big hit at our thanks giving dinner. I was glad that others had suggested reducing the amount of sugars .  I did but still found it plenty sweet.

Absolutely amazing!! I didn't use any of the white or brown sugar because I'm trying to watch my sugar intake. But was sweet enough without it. My new go to dessert!

I have never made nor heard of this deliciousness before and obviously haven't eaten whipped cream in a very long time because I had NO idea they had different flavors...... 
Everybody loves it for our thanksgiving 2018 dessert!

Delicious dessert but the recipe called for a 9x13 dish but I couldn't get the crust to fill a pan that large.  Ended up making it in a 9x9 pan and had leftover. Maybe it was me.  The dessert was great.
