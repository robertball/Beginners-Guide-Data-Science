This recipe is fabulous.  I increased the orange juice by 1/2 tablespoon, and used Splenda instead of honey, but no other changes.  The sesame oil with the orange juice and onion makes a fabulous flavor!

Recipe Group Selection:  16, June 2012 ~  Thought the ingredients sounded good for this salad, but we did not care for the mixture.  The sesame oil took over the taste of everything.  Not sorry that I tried it as we love trying new things.  This one was just not a winner in our house.  Sorry

I made this for the recipe group selection this week. This makes just enough dressing for two dinner size salads. I didn't feel comfortable with two teaspoons of sesame oil and started with one...and that was plenty, and maybe too much. I ended up adding a bit more of the orange and honey to even the taste out. Unless you really like strong sesame flavor, I would suggest adding drops of that until it reaches your desired taste.

I did not care for this dressing. It tasted like creamy orange juice with some sesame oil in it. It was missing the 'snap' most salad dressings have. I guess it would be something to try for people who need a very neutral dressing. Sorry. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)

Recipe Group selection 6/17/12.  I made this but had reservations about it being too sweet for out taste so I served it with sharper greens and it worked.  The balance of flavors is perfect, albeit on the sweet side, but not cloying.  My only reason for the 4 star review is this is not enough to dress 4 average salads.  Thanks, John!

I made this for the Recipe Group. The dressing itself is delicious and interesting, but it lost its flavor in a salad. Maybe I made too much salad for this amount of the dressing, but that is. The salad had a delicate orange flavor, a little sweet, with a hint of sesame. Basically we liked the salad, but I wish the flavor were more intense.

Made for Recipe Group, followed directions.  There was three of us for lunch and we all agreed that the sesame oil was very over powering  for all of our tastes.  So Sorry, but thanks for sharing as I do like to try new things.

Made this for Recipe Group...We did not care for this dressing at all. I felt that the sesame oil flavor overpowered everything else (and I am a lover of sesame oil), and I also thought it needed more in the seasoning department b/c, to me, w/o the sesame oil, this would've been pretty bland. The orange flavor was nice though.  Maybe this would be good as a dipping sauce or w/ tweaks, but as is, this was not a winner at our house.

I used *toasted* sesame oil which is a favorite with me. It does make only 2 servings, but since I live alone, that's ok. Howver, it doesn't keep very well. It lost something after 2 or 3 days in the frig.
