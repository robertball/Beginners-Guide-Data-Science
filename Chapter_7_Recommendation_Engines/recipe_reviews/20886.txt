At last a coleslaw recipe without sugar! I can't stand the idea of a sweet vegetable salad so this is a good recipe for me. I also added sliced cucumber and only had yellow mustard which I used sparingly. A crunchy lunch! It's a good base to play with...you could add curry powder or raisins or peanuts or chopped hard boiled eggs, parsley, you name it....

We didn't like the mustard in this.  Also, it just seems that the addition of sugar and spices is a must for us when it comes to coleslaw.

My family loved this slaw. The mustard just added a little difference, although I decreased the amount to 1 Tbsp.  It helps to have a good dijon instead of an off brand. I will definitely make it again!!

Simply loved it !  I added a little less mayonnaise and more dijon.  It took 20 minutes to chop up the cabbage and around 2 minutes to combine the engredients for the dressing.  The dijon mustard made it different from other coleslaws.  I added salt and ground pepper also.

This turned out great! It was a big hit with everyone in the house. I used Veganaise instead of mayo for a tangier flavor. If you usually enjoy really heavy coleslaw with sugar in it, this isn't the right recipe for you. I find this to be much better tasting and nutritious.

Used a pre-packaged slaw mix, so review is dressing only.  The dijon gives it a little bit of a unique tang.  Subbed apple cider vinegar and added about 1T honey.

Thanks for the recipe! It was great! I hadn't tried making coleslaw before.  The second time I made it, I just sliced some of the ingredients finely instead of grating because I was doing it by hand.

As someone who tries to avoid sugar and sugar substitutes - I was so excited to find this recipe.  I actually just halved the "dressing" portion and used with a regular sized bag of cabbage mix (cole slaw mix) that you find in the store.  It was fabulous!

Excellent sauce.  I chose this because there is no sugar, no salt and no pepper - so am happy with the tangy dressing.  The amounts seem right on, proportions of dressing to vegetables is enough to coat but not swimming.  I left had to leave out the bell pepper and celery but made up for the amounts by adding extra cabbage and carrot.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

Really nice crunchy coleslaw!! I chopped it all by hand rather than shredding, and used a strong dijon mustard.. will only use 1 spoon next time :) I wouldnt use sugar as some others have suggested, It was a lovely healthy side to my sweet potatoes and will be making it again tomorrow :) thanks for the recipe :)

I raised an eyebrow at the addition of mustard to a coleslaw dressing but it was so good! Only a couple changes, we used 1 tbsp yellow mustard (don’t have Dijon right now) and added a teaspoon of sugar to give it a little bit of sweetness without being a sugar bomb like a lot of coleslaw dressings. Turned out amazing!

It was really good. I like sweet and my fiance likes the vinegar. I made it according to the recipe, split it, and added sugar and pepper to my half. Both were scrumptious

This is now my go-to cole slaw. Family loves it. Sometimes I use different vinegars, either apple cider or red wine, and always add 1-2 minced jalapeños for an extra kick!

I was glad to see a coleslaw dressing recipe without sugar (I'm eating "LowCarb; HiFat" so this definitely fits those parameters.) I already had some broccoli/carrot/red cabbage shredded, and was looking for a coleslaw dressing for it. I used less Dijon mustard (one Tbsp.). I'll make this again (and get some red bell peppers to add too). Might try apple cider vinegar next time as well.

I used half mayo and half sour cream. Added celery seed and a tab of raw sugar.
