Really enjoyed this.  For those of you that can not find Vanilla Powder, try looking for Vanilla Sugar made by Oetker in the baking aisle.  It's the same thing.

I've been looking for an instant chai recipe and was glad to find this one.  It's very good.  I doubled the confectioner's sugar.  Since I couldn't find vanilla powder, I used French Vanilla flavor powdered non-dairy creamer. I prefer mine fairly strong, so I used 6 heaping tsp. mix in a mug. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!!

I am very anxious to try this recipe but am wondering if someone could tell me what type of "instant tea powder" they used?  I am not sure what this is?  Thanks

A tip to find some less expensive cardamom:  look in the bulk section of health food stores.  I found some for $20.49 per POUND, instead of $7 or $8 an ounce in the grocery.

I bought chai tea from a home party which was rather expensive.  This recipe is GREAT and costs much less.  Note:  I did add a 1/2 cup more confectioners sugar as I preferred a sweeter tea.

This tastes super!  I did have a few problems, like don't do this in a blender (I don't have a food processor)  It made a huge mess, BUT, it was well worth it!  YUMMMMMM.  And I can't find vanilla powder locally, so I have ordered some, but for now, I add a drop of vanilla to the hot water and it tastes great.  This was great.  Thanks for the recipe.  Even my husband loves it.  He was amazed that it was not the home/show tea and that I had made it myself.

Great recipe.  I have made this many times.   I was unable to obtain vanilla powder so I substituted with Carnation french vanilla non-dairy creamer. I add two 8 oz bottles and also cut the tea back to one cup.

I am totally addicted to Chai, but supporting my habit was getting too expensive!  This is a great mix!  I doubled the sugar, and increased the amount of mix to 6 teaspoons.  I did not have vanilla powder, so I just add a drop of vanilla in!  Glad those suggestions were in the reviews!  YUMMY!!!!

Excellent!  I too bought 8 oz. at a home show and it was $10, I made 48 servings for less than $5.  It's too delicious!!!  Although I doubled the powdered sugar.

I also bought a commercial brand of this tea and paid quite a bit.  I am so glad I found this recipe when I did, because I wanted more.  This is almost identical to the one I bought.  Great!

I really like this recipe.  I know there are people out there who think "Instant- yuck!" but my guess would be they wouldn't even be looking here.  I was making "fresh" chai every day because I was hooked and it was a hassle- I like that I can take this to work.  I did make some changes to this, but it deserves a 5 anyway because the recipe is a great starting point to adjust for your own tastes and some of the changes I made were for convenience alone.

I do not have cardamom, unfortunately, so I left it out. I also left out the dry milk powder- the first time I made this, I thought it gave it a bad aftertaste, which most instant dry milk powders have, and since it is petty hard to get non-instant dry milk anymore, you might want to taste it before you add it to all your other ingredients. I just added a little more creamer.  I also substituted 1 cup vanilla creamer for 1 cup regular and left out the vanilla powder, which can also be hard to find.  Lastly, I ADDED 1/2 t salt and about 1/4 t ground white pepper to give it some kick. Yum!

This mix is pretty good.  I let it sit for a couple of days and the smell is awesome (almost good enough to wrap and use as a sachel!).  My only complaint is that some of the spices don't disolve which can make some swallows somewhat gritty.  I gave this away as part of a Christmas gift and it was well received. Will make again.

Now I went into this blindly, never having Chai Tea before... Well I loved it! I would however increase it to 6 tsp. and I also added more conf. sugar. Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I can't wait to share it with my family!!

Chai is my preferred drink, even over coffee which I have quite a palate for. I was so excited to find a good instant mix recipe to give a go.  I was unable to find vanilla powder so I switched out the powdered milk for french vanilla creamer, omitted the cardamon after seeing the price ($15 a 2oz jar) and added some black pepper (which is the trademark of a good chai). This will be going as gifts this hliday season. And once my husband tries it there will probably be a BIG jar going to work. He hates most drinks, but adores chai as well. Working in security he doesn't usually get to steep his tea and drink it hot, but this will fix that problem and have enough kick to keep him happy.

This is fantastic, and I never like "Instant" anything!!!  But after reading the reviews, decided to give it a try.  I did cut the cloves and ginger to half of what it called for and doubled the sugars added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp Black Pepper.  ALWAYS USE CARDAMON, the flavor is amazing.  This will be available at my house from now on, think I may even give up coffee.  Also makes a great gift! THANKS FOR SHARING SUCH A GRAT RECIPE!

Great recipe.  I tried this one and the other one, and I prefer this one better.  Probably the confectioners sugar in this one.  The changes I made:  I used French Vanilla Creamer instead of regular, no vanilla powder.  I used all the suggested spices, but I'm going to omit the ginger, and the cloves, was a bit too spicy for me.  I think this is because my instant tea is flavored with all the spices mentioned in this recipe.  Don't want to go for overkill.  I did double the confectioners sugar, and I added a titich of nutmeg.  I'm also gonna add some cocoa powder next time around.  Great base.  Thanks for posting!!!!

This is a really good chai tea and a great alternative to paying $10 for the "home party" mix.  I used fat free french vanilla coffee-mate and decafinated instant tea.  I have had numerous requests for the recipe!

Great recipe. I used french vanilla creamer instead of vanilla powder and corriander instead of cardamon. Messy to make but great taste. Can't wait to make as a holiday gift. Thanks for all the ratings before - great ideas =)

So wonderful, thank you for sharing! My processor must be tiring out or something, because I had to grind for quite some time with frequent stirrings to get a light enough powder.  But now it is fantastic and such a bargain!

This was quite good. After reading the reviews I used vanilla non-dairy creamer too. Mixed it up and gave it a try then decided I like mine stronger and sweeter so doubled the brown sugar and put 3 tablespoons mix in 8 oz water. Gave that a taste and decided I like it creamier so added another cup of creamer. It's a great all around recipe that can be changed for personal taste. Mix it up then tweak it like you like it.OH MY! I won't be buying the expensive home party version any more.

I've been buying $8 bags of the chai tea mix from the grocery store and was so glad to find recipes on this Web site.  I tried another chai tea recipe first and it was good, but not quite the same as the store-bought.  I tried this recipe to see if it was any closer.  AMAZING!!  I'm very impressed with Nancy for coming up with this concoction.  I used French vanilla powdered non-dairy creamer and omitted the vanilla powder.  It tastes just like the mix I USED to buy - from now on, I'll make my own using your recipe.  THANKS!!

I wish I would have read the reviews before making.  I too, think the dry milk powder has an after taste.  I made my own vanilla powder by putting the inside of a vanilla bean in powdered sugar.  Interesting to add 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 nutmeg.

Wasn't what I expected I made this to give as x-mas gifts but tried before giving and was glad I did it wasn't creamy like I would have wanted and the spices didn't really dissolve into the mixture when mixed with a water/ milk mixture.

Great recipe.  I doubled all of the spices as well as the brown sugar and I make the tea using half water and half milk.  Overall great recipe.

I am a Chai Tea addict! I couldn't find vanilla powder so I used French vanilla non dairy creamer. I couldn't find instant tea powder so I used the granules. I liked this recipe almost as good as the other on this site. This needs to be a tad more sweet for my taste. Thank you.

I think instant tea powder is also known as Tea Masala which you can buy in Indian stores.

I added 1 T pepper to the mix, which I thought made it taste more authentic...but try it to your taste.

This is a great recipe and super easy.  I used 1 1/2 cups of powdered non-dairy creamer and 1/2 cups of vanilla flavored powdered non-cairy creamer as I could not find powdered vanilla.  It turned out great!

For a change of pace, I try mango or raspberry flavored instant tea. (have used jello too and cut back on the sugar)  The flavored creamers add extra flavor too!!

I love Chai Tea and this mix is wonderful.  I sub'd a full 11 oz.  of "Creamy original coffee creamer" for the creamer and milk powder- it measured about 3 1/2 c. but I like my chai tea creamier and 1 tsp of liquid pure vanilla for the vanilla powder (I didn't like the idea of vanilla flavoring from the vanilla creamer as others suggested) but otherwise followed it exactly.  Some of the spices didn't dissolve well in the hot water so next time I will start the processor with just the spices so that they can "powdered" before the rest is mixed in.  I am so excited to have this.  I will be looking for some decaf instant tea so I can get some rest.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I made this for the holidays for our family gift exchange it's become a staple in our house.  We have given up coffee and drink this instead.  I use decaf instant tea and nobody is the wiser.  I don't use a food processor or blender because of the mess, I just use a whisk in a deep bowl, no mess and easy clean up. Fabulous recipe and worth the time!

This is amazing and simple recipe . I will no long go to coffee shops for this. I did adapt it ..
I didn't have instant tea and didn't want to you nestle tea so I just made a cup of oolong tea (tea bag) .
Mixed all the spices with a sifter , no blender or grinder. 
I left out the powdered milk and vanilla . And used a liquid vanilla syrup instead .it came out perfect . 3 scoops powder into my. Tea plus a spoon of vanilla syrup and bam ! I'm in love .

This is great! Just like others said, I had some at a party and liked it very much.  Finding this recipe for homemade is lucky for me.  I added cayenne pepper and black pepper to suit my taste.  The summer weather is coming and I'm going to try it iced!  Thank you, Nancy for developing this recipe and sharing.
