I made this exactly as written.  The real secret to this sauce is to cook your hot dogs and then put them in the sauce in a crock pot or simmering on the stove for about an hour.  Then when you put the dog in your bun add some sauce.  Nothing else needed.  Yummy!!  This is in my "Keeper" folder.

this was really delish! I was sort of skeptical about putting sugar and vinegar in this. But quickly changed my mind after I got to tasting it. I saute'd my onions in the oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. And used a No Corn Syrup ketchup and relacing the sugar with an alternative(Splenda). Worked out great. But stayed true to the recipe. Just modified to suit. I'd make this again in a heartbeat. Nice mild zing to it. You could easily add a few jalapenos to kick this up if you like it spicy. It would work very well. TY sal.

Yum!  I made this with a jar of chili sauce that had been in my pantry.  It had the vinegar in it's ingredient list, so I omitted the vinegar.  Otherwise, used all the same ingredients.

I made this to serve with pot roast...had to substitute hot dog relish for the sweet relish, and rice vinegar for the white vinegar, but all in all, loved the result!

This was good, pretty much what I expected. My husband didn't care for it, but I will probably make again. Made exactly as written.

I halved this recipe but added about 1/2 cup of vinegar and it turned out great.  Good on burgers as well!!

This was easy to make in our classroom cooking class. It tasted sweet and sour and went well with a grilled hot dog. A lot like a fancy ketchup.
