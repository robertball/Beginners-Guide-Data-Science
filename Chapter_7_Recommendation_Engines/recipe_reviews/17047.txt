Hi! This is Betsy, who submitted this recipe that I've enjoyed my entire life.  To my surprise, Mom informed me the other night that the recipe needs only HALF OF A CAN OF EVAPORATED MILK!!!  Apparently, you all seem to get good results with a whole can, and I have, too, but try it next time with half a can for a denser texture.  If you double the recipe, make sure to use only ONE CAN!!!! Enjoy! Oh, and it IS great for breakfast!  I agree!!!

This recipe turned out great! My father was in heaven. It was so rich and delicious, didn't miss the traditional calorie laden crust at all. I am a vegetarian and substituted the eggs with Egg Replacer and it still came out perfectly. I also experimented with a variation on this recipe. Instead of using evaporated milk I used an 8 oz block of light cream cheese. To make the cream cheese easier to blend in I used just enough evaporated milk to make it a bit more fluid, about a 1/4 cup. This substitution made for a denser pie, but the "crust" was more evident and it tasted like a pumpkin cheesecake. It was one of my better experiments.

GLUTEN FREE!!! I made this yesterday substituting the 1/2 c all-purpose flour with 1/4 c rice flour and 1/4 c tapioca flour as well as increasing the baking powder to 1 tsp so that my gf family could have a fall treat. (My kids love pumpkin pie but I hate making and rolling out crusts.) Also, following suggestions made by others, I did use the entire 12 oz can of evaporated milk (rather than half), pumpkin pie spice for all the others and threw it all together in the blender and blended for 1 minute. It could NOT get easier than this and it turned out delicious!

I used 1/2 can of evaporated milk like the submitter had suggested.  I'm not sure why people think this is cakey.  Mine turned out with the exact smooth pumpkin pie texture.  I agree with another reviewer who said the "crust" is more like a breadcrust.  I had no problem baking this in an 8" springform pan and the whole thing keeping its shape when inverted.  Actually, the outside looked kind of dry and it did worry me, but the taste was heavenly (and low fat)!!!

I baked this pie and it turned out more "cake-like" in texture, just as others had mentioned. However, when we ate the leftovers the next day, it had much more of a pie consistency, pretty much like regular pumpkin pie without the crust. If I made this again, I would definitely prepare it a day ahead of time.

I did catch Betsy's review so I only used half a can of milk but all the other impossible pumpkin pie recipes call for a full can of milk...I guess it'll work either way. Next time, I will use the full can & see which is best for us. I used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie mix for the other spices. After it cooked, my first thought was, "Dang! They were right... it is much more like  cake than a pie." But that was in appearance only. The "crust" (don't expect much...it is really only a thin cakey layer) forms on the top but underneath, it is very much like pumpkin pie filling. Hubby & I both preferred it over a traditional pumpkin pie w/ crust. Served it w/ a dollop of whipped cream. Thanks Betsy!

what an easy pie to make.. this was delicious and fun to watch bake.. everyone loved the fact that there was no crust.. after adding the whipped cream who needed the extra crust to make you fuller... I will make this pie again for sure, it had the right taste and texture.. I used 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and it was perfect..

I tried this pie because my husband loves pumpkin pie and did not want to make a pastry shell for lack of patience that day...absolutly loved it...I only used half a can of condensed milk and it came out perfect. I took it to work for a potluck and it was a rave! but of course i put a little twist on it...cant share the secret though its to good and must keep to myself!

A really good pie, easy to follow recipe and went over well with the carb-cutter crowd since there was no crust to feel guilty over.  Consistency was a little different (not bad, just different) and I would have liked a more spiced flavor so I'll experiment next time with more cinnamon, ginger, etc. but I believe the recipe will make a repeat appearance at next year's holiday celebrations.

Didn't work for me, even though I followed the recipe to the letter. Turned out rather cake-like in texture, not at all like the custard-y filling of a traditional pumpkin pie. And where was the crust everyone talks about? All I had was what I get on the outside of a loaf of pumpkin bread. Very disappointing. I'd rather go to a little more trouble and make a traditional pumpkin pie.

Wonderful recipe. I adjusted the spices to taste, but kept everything else as is. (ended up using the full can of evaporated milk - didn't seem to hurt the recipe at all)

When baking, I put them in a well greased muffin tin and baked them for 15-18 minutes. I probably should have put a circle of parchment at the bottom of the pan, but they unmolded relatively easily. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream for father's day. My DH loved the "pumpkin pie cupcakes". It seems like the texture of the cake depends on how long you bake it for.

Anyways, I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

We love this recipe. I use the full can of evaporated milk and bake it in an 8 inch square pan. I have also cooked it in the slow cooker for 3 hours on low, and that is fantastic as well. It isn't as easy to cut...we serve it more like a pudding, but the flavor is there, and we love it. We will definitely make this again and again.

Great recipe!  I used the full can of evaporated milk, and the consistency was silky and firm, not too puddingy.  I also lowered the oven to just above 330F (165C) to prevent the pie cracking, although it was still  cooked after 50mins.  I think it would've become more 'cakey' if I had cooked longer/at higher temperature.  
Because you can't buy canned pumpkin in my neck of the woods, I used the real thing, and being a naturally sweet pumpkin, I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup - it was just bordering on being too sweet, so bear it in mind if you're using a real pumpkin!  Wonderful pie, with a very subtle 'crust'... After all, the best thing about a pumpkin pie is the filling!  :)

I wanted to rate the tip from betsy, to try using only 1/2 can of milk .. It was perfect. I use a slightly different recipe so i can't really rate this one. I used fresh pumpkin ( make sure you strain it in a sieve gets rid of alot of excess water) I all used splenda, 1/2 cup of baking mix (which i made from this site) and 2tbs of melted margerine. 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of salt, ginger, nutmeg, and 1/4tsp cloves. 2tsp vanilla (opt) I beat the pumpkin and sugar then add the eggs and vanilla, spices. mix in the baking mix and slowly added the milk till i get the right consistency. baked as directed.

Very easy and tasty.  I refrigerated it overnight after cooking and the next day it had a very similar texture to pumpkin pie. Since I never eat the crust on pies anyway, this will be something I'll make again.  Next time, I think I'll cut back on the butter and use egg beaters instead of whole eggs, to cut back even more on the calories.

It was a good recipe.  I enjoyed it.  Not the best ever, I'll probably use suggestions to enhance it, but definitely worth using.  I am not a crust fan, so this was ideal for me.

Really quick, good if you don't like crust.  I followed the recipe exactly and the texture was perfect, not too sweet or spicy-just right.  Tastes best after cooling in the fridge for a couple of hours.

We love this recipe!  It's so easy! I'm bad at pie crusts so this is perfect for me!  I made it once with the full can of evaporated milk and it was basically a pumpkin pie without the crust.  Then I saw that it was supposed to be only a 1/2 of the can so I tried that.  It came out with much better texture and had more substance to it.  I see why some described it as "cakey" because it does have some density to it - but its more creamy and smooth than actual cake.

Love this recipe. You don't get that flour taste and it has the texture of real pumpkin pie. Next time I will try pumpkin pie spice just because this one doesn't have exactly the same flavor I am used to.

I caught the first review that said to use only half a can of milk. This had good flavor, but the consistency was almost a little dry (cakelike). Next time I will use the full can of evaporated milk like the recipe originally said and see if it makes a difference. Did not really make a crust like I expected, but it was easy and tasted good, which was important to me since I was making Thanksgiving dinner for the first time!

I am quite disappointed in how this turned out.  The result was more of a pumpkin cake than anything else.  I was really looking forward to the excellent taste and texture of traditional pumpkin pie filling, but the entire inside is very much cakelike and not at all smooth the way pumpkin pie is supposed to be.  Also, I find the "crust" is more like the crust on a loaf of bread than a pie crust.  Next time I will either use a pre-made pie crust and a different recipe for the filling, or just go the Mrs. Smith's route.

Really good!  I forgot to reduce the evaporated milk, I added the full can...so I added more pumpkin - ended up using a large can.  It was really really good!  I used my spring form pan and it was firm and beautiful when served on a platter with whipped cream on the side.

I'm sorry but I really did not care for this recipe. I used a whole can of milk. I was very excited to try it because the calories/fat is so much less than traditional pie recipes; however the consistency was weird and I didn't care for the flavor. I am a traditional pumpkin pie freak so maybe that is why I didnt like it. I miss the creamy texture and even my son who loves pumpkin pie didnt like it. We ended up throwing most of it away. :(

Turned out really quite well.  Excellent with Vanilla ice cream because its not sweet enough by itself and the vanilla ice cream just brings out its flavour.  Yummy

This has been a family favorite since the first time I printed this recipe in November 2001 - I still have the original page I printed and our holiday dinners wouldn't be complete without it!  I have always used the full can of evaporated milk and we all LOVE IT!  Crustless - I wish every pie could be converted to a crustless version!

This was great. I doubled the recipe to make 2 pies, but I only used 1 cup of sugar for both of them.  I unintentionally had to use shortening instead of butter, and it was still good.  It was simple to make without fussing with a crust, and it tastes great without it too.  I will definitely make this one again.

I accidentally made the pie with a whole can (14 oz) of condensed milk by mistake, but it turned out tasting great!  As is my habit, I reduced the sugar (about 1/4 cup less, I don't like things too sweet) and also used half whole wheat and half white flour.  I don't know what the texture of the original recipe is like, but this version had a thin cakey texture on top, bottom and sides, and the filling was just delicious, a hint of gooeyness, as if there was a little brown sugar in there.  My hub and my reaction was "this is really good!"  I'd definitely add this to my repertoire, maybe reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup, or adding none at all.  Highly recommend!

I found this recipe about 5 years ago and I have used it ever since. I tried the version with the half can of milk too, and they have both worked perfectly ...easily....and tastily! I am a Brit (living in Canada) and always feed this to very skeptical Brits who visit....they always take the recipe away with them! Although, canned pumpkin puree is rather hard to find in the stores back home :o)

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe I use now. It is dark and spicy ...just how I like it! Don't expect a big doughy crust...the crust is very thin...great for low carb diets !!

Although this recipe is easy enough to follow, the eye appeal before and after the pie is cooked, just is not there. It tastes fine, but being that most people eat with their eyes, I had to think fast and through some spiced whipped cream on top of the pie, and that made it look super yummy. Thanks for the recipe, Betsy.

A disappointment.  The yummy traditional pumpkin taste is lost in the semi-cakeyness.  I made it in a basic aluminum baking dish and the presentation is not so appealing.  It is not, however, a bad desert, just not what I wanted.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving.  My pie did not develop any sort of crust at all.  The custard was not silky, but not cakelike either.  It was sort of a stiffer, crustless pumpkin pie.  It was not at all offensive and the flavor was fine.  I think I would just make a regular pumpkin pie next time since I did not find this pie to be special.  All that having been said, my nine year old tried his darndest to eat this pie single handedly.

Great recipe--and so easy--and no need to make crust!!  I like that it makes a firm, yet very moist filling (often pumpkin pie fillings are too soft and mushy).  I made a few changes.  First, I used 1/2 cup Bisquick in place of the flour, salt and baking soda.  Used brown sugar instead of white.  Used 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of adding the cinnamon, allspice, ginger and nutmeg separately.  Finally, I added a topping of 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup quick cooking oatmeal and 2 tablespoons softened butter--sprinkled this on the pie just before baking.  Yum!!!!  I will be making this pie again-I would use this recipe even with a regular crust--texture of filling is just right with the added Bisquick.

This was very easy and tasted good--excellent for those times when you don't have time to make crust but would like to enjoy a piece of pumpkin pie.  It tasted just like a typical pumpkin pie sans crust.

This recipe is sooo awesome.  The fact that you don't have to have a crust makes it so easy and it tastes wonderful.  Its the best pumpkin pie I've ever had.  Even better if you're watching what you eat.  You don't have that extra 5-6 grams of fat from the crust.

This recipe is almost exactly like the Bisquik recipe. I've been making that one for years. That recipe calls for 1/2 c. of Bisquik instead of the flour and baking powder, all the other ingredients and amounts are the same. I can't make a pie crust to save my soul, so the Bisquik impossible pie recipes were perfect for me. (I do use the frozen, ready made crusts if I really have to have a crust.... )

I used gluten free flour instead of regular flour because I'm gluten intolerant. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used vanilla almond milk that I had for my granddaughter. It received rave reviews.

I needed a pie i could make a couple days ahead & would travel well, this recipe was perfect! As recomended in another review, i put all of the ingredients in the he blender, blended then poured in greased pie pan to bake. I exchanged the sugar for splenda & the ap flour for almond flour/meal to make this more diabetic friendly. I really was crwamy & delicious, will always make my pies with this recipe now!

As suggested by the author, I halved the amount of evaporated milk. I acutally just used a small 5 oz can of evaporated milk. To save on fat and cholesterol, I used 3 egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs. Interesting that you can reduce the amount of evaporated milk by half an it doesn't really change the recipe that much.  I also used the I Can't Believe it's not Butter baking sticks. 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices.  Easy and quick to throw together. But I like the one that is cooked in the slow cooker better, Pumpkin Pie Pudding. It is basically the same ingredients but something about the slow cooker makes it so good. I didn't have time to wait on the slow cooker, so I thought I would try this version.

I have made Impossible Pumpkin Pie for years but this is the best recipe I've ever used!  I normally use my blender to make it but this batter is very thick--next time I'll use the food processor.  The only changes I made was to use stick margarine, 2 t. pumpkin pie spice with the 1 t. cinnamon.  I used a 10" pie plate--next time I may use a 9" pie plate as the pie was a bit low although perfect slices after a heavy meal.

I baked several times and it was very good and delicious although I could not like the unique taste and smell from nutmeg.  Since I do not like nutmeg, I added a little more of cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  It turns out great every time I bake.

Super easy and super yummy! I used 3/4 can of evaporated milk - I had intended on using only half, but poured too much before  I remembered. It did have a bit of a bread texture except for the very center. Delicious nonetheless!

I used sugar substitute (Splenda) to make this pie for my diabetic husband, making it a mere 14 carbs per serving. Since there seems to be some debate about whether to use 1/2 cup or a full cup of evap. milk, I split the difference and used 3/4 cup!  We both enjoyed it very much.  And with no crust and no sugar, it's a great low-carb treat.

Good, but nothing to rave about.  The texture was pretty much between a cake and pie filling, so it just seemed a bit odd and certainly didn't win any points for aesthetics.  Flavor was pretty good though, I'd say still a good choice if you're in the mood for pumpkin pie and don't have a pie crust on hand or don't want to make one.

I loved it but my DH missed the crust.  Still I used less sugar and butter and subbed whole wheat for the white flour and half & half for the milk.  I also added the grated rind and juice of one orange.  I doubled the recipe and made 2 pies and one is already gone!  Next time I'll add more orange rind and some fresh ginger too.

This is the best tasting pie I've ever made! I usually cant make a pie and this one's easy! There is no crust on the bottom, but it stays together and my family eats all of it!

My boys wanted pumpkin pie, but I didn't feel like making a crust and had no frozen ones.  This turned out very good, nice and creamy.  I read Betsy's review about the evaporated milk and only used a half can.  Yum...thanks Betsy.

The texture is fine and the flavor "OK"; personally I prefer
a good crust and a little more spice.

Me and Hubby LOVE this, we are eating it for breakfast. The filling is soo good that it doesn't need a crust. Last year I baked leftover pumpkin filling in a ramikin and Father in law said that he liked it better that way. I'll be making this recipe for him!

This is my first time writing a less than glowing review. The texture was so unappealing that I threw the entire pie away. Fortunately,  made two traditional pumpkin pies so I didn't have to serve this to my guests.

This was fun to make and tastes good too! Update 12/24/06: I have continued to make this recipe for the last several years from this site and I have successfully converted the family and friends to a "no crust" type of pumpkin pie! 11/24/11 Update: This converts easily to Gluten Free by adding 1/2 cup gluten free baking mix (leaving off the baking powder, and salt); Yes, you too can make a pumpkin pie!!

I Loved this recipe.  I liked the firmness of the pie however, it was difficult to get out of the pie plate. There didn't seem to be any crust. I followed another users suggestions by using the pumpkin pie spice and I topped it with  a mixture of brown sugar, oatmeal, butter and pecans. Next time I am going to try it in a crust.

this recipe was very easy and had a wonderful flavor.  be careful you don't cook it too long, the "crust" gets tough.  otherwise, it was really nice, especially for those people who don't like pie crust!

This recipe was excellent!  I love the texture of the pie - it's not soggy and swiggly, but more dense and YES, there's a crust-like exterior! :)  It's a keeper for anyone who simply loves the pumpkin pie filling as much as I do!

Sooo easy and so flavorful. With just a dollop of whipcream it's a perfect fall dessert. I'll take this over pumpin pie with the crust any day.

OK,  mostly followed the recipe.  Added 4 oz of softened cream cheese and extra spices plus 1/2 cup brown sugar with the white.  I did catch the notice about using 6 oz milk so used 6 oz milk.  Very delish ! Oh, forgot to mention I used a ten inch springform pan, the pie came out the consistency of pumpkin pie.

As a side note, I think I know Deb_the_Baker's secret.  I used Spiced Rum in place of vanilla and some of the milk.  My husband said it was tasty but couldn't put his finger on what it was.  LOL

I do gluten-free and dairy free.  I added an addition1/2 cup brown sugar.
Exchange original smart balance for butter.  12 oz of coconut milk exchange for canned milk  - 2 egg whites exchanged for 2 whole eggs.  I exchanged Bob’s Red Mill 1 to 1 G-F flour for the all purpose.  It looks and smells wonderful.... and tastes amazing..... thanks for the original recipe

I’ve tried similar “impossible” pumpkin recipes (all the same ingredients but slightly different measurements etc) - and this one is the winner by far. I did see the note, and used only 1/2 a can of evaporated milk. HUGE hit - and calorie wise it’s just under 200cals for a 1/6 slice and just under 150cals for a 1/8 slice - whipped topping not included. I don’t even like pumpkin pie, and I LOVE this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing!!

(Once I only had a 10in ceramic pie/quiche pan, that worked fine but I cut the cook time down by about 10 minutes)

We like this pie.  A lot like "impossible pie".  I was out of Bisquick and this worked nicely.  Family love pumpkin pie without the crust.  I did use half brown sugar, half white sugar and a whole can of evap milk.

The I really enjoyed this pie and used brown rather than white sugar for a richer flavour. I also added more spice including cloves to the mix. I was thinking of topping it with a cinnamon allspice glaze to put it over the top.  Will definitely enjoy this one again as I don't care for pastry.

This recipe is delicious for those of us looking to eliminate calories and still have an enjoyable dessert.  I did make some changes because I did not have either evaporated milk nor did I have any butter.  I used buttermilk; 1 cup or so.  This came up beautifully consistent and I topped with canned whip cream and fresh pecans.

I didn't have allspice but added 1/8 teas. of ground cloves.  I also used 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup.  I have a sweet-tooth.  Loved the texture and the flavor.  It was super-easy!  I'll be making this again.

Mine turned out like a custard, with no crust. Maybe because I used fresh instead of canned pumpkin?

From Grandma Jan. I used 1/2 the milk, and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also used coconut butter instead.( My favorite for pretty well everything instead of oil or other fats. )
The easiest way to get this done is to put all the liquids and eggs in the blender then add the mixture of flour etc. You can do this with a lot of other recipes too. Definitely a pass it on dish.
Totally delicious.

This turned out great. Since I had fresh pumpkin which has more water in it than the canned, I used only half a can of milk. I did sub brown sugar for the white, but otherwise followed the recipe. I used this recipe because I wanted to make an impossible pie without using Bisquik. We like impossible pies because you get all the good filling without the extra calories from the crust. The pumpkin may not be quite as custardy, but I don't think it was "Cakey" as some have said.

I've never ever uttered the sentence "the crust is the best part" about any pie, pizza, or any other crust-bearing food, so this recipe seemed ideal. The "crust" it formed seemed limited to just the edge at the very top and a thin 'crusty' layer across the entire top of the pie - the sides and bottom of the pie didn't have any sort of crust. Strange! I would not serve this or bring it to a potluck, but it's the kind of thing I'd make again if I just want a pumpkin pie in the fridge to munch on all week.

Yum!!  I made this for Thanksgiving and the store-bought pumpkin pie never got touched.  :)  I used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin, sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated, and was a little generous with the spices.  The texture is perfect, with just a tiny bit of "crust" on the top.  It was even better the next day - this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This came out great!  I did make some slight alterations (some on purpose and some not): 1/2 can evaporated milk, 3/4c flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 & 3/4 cups roasted and mashed acorn squash (instead of a can of pumpkin).  It comes out looking like pumpkin bread, but once you slice into it, it's heaven.  The texture is a cross between mousse and pumpkin pie, but that might be from all the changes I mentioned.  I love it the way it is, but I can't wait to see what a night in the refrigerator does.

Awesome recipe! I did use half a can of milk and it worked perfectly. Mine wasn't cakelike at all, and it did form a slight crust which was yummy! My whole family loved it and I loved that it didn't have the super fattening crust!

This is my new pumpkin pie recipe and the kids loved it!!!  It is healthier, too, minus all the extra butter that is usually found in a crust.

I came across this recipe idea when looking for an egg free option for another family member.  I had noticed that my kids were eating out the filling of my pies and leaving the crust.  It seemed a waste of my time and resources to keep making crust with the pie.  I made this yesterday and we only have 1/2 the pie left!  It is wonderful.  It is a little firmer than the traditional recipe.  I think it has excellent flavor and texture.  I plan on making it again but reducing the butter by a tablespoon, just to reduce calories.  I only changed the spice mixture, I used the traditional amounts of cinn, ginger and cloves.  My kids ate it all and there was nothing but clean plates all around.  I placed this recipe over the tradtional recipe in my book!

I really liked this, though I think calling what it makes a "crust" is a bit of a stretch. It makes a very thin, almost-crustlike layer on top. You can't tell it's there by looking and it's only crustlike if it's completely cooled. However, it is delicious (pumpkin pie made with butter? Why didn't I think of that!) and very fast to make. I baked mine in a 8x12 baking dish so it was easier to serve it to a larger group. I'll make it again, but only when it's a circumstance when I don't really need that traditional composition of a pie with a true crust which is what I'd prefer for a traditional holiday meal.

If you can make this the day before and refrigerate it overnight, this is a pretty great recipe, however, if you are eating it the day you make it, it has a strange texture. The crust is like the eggy breadlike skin of a low-fat muffin, and it wasn't just on the bottom, but on the top of the pie. The top "crust" disappears with overnight refrigeration -- the moisture probably just softens it away. I've also tried mixing this same recipe and cooking it on the stovetop like a pudding, and it makes a very thick pumpkin pie pudding without the funny crust. If you don't want your pudding to be as thick as a pumpkin pie, reduce the flour.

Don't know if I did anything wrong, but I did not get anything even remotely resembling crust or cake, more custardy.  It also went off really quickly (after 3 days) in the fridge compared to other pumpkin pie recipes.

I'm sorry, but I didn't love this pie, but some of my family members did, thus the 4 stars.  I found the texture and the flavor strange or I guess not what I expected.  I really like the idea of the pie making it's own crust, but I didn't see this happen here.  I would not make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing though.

Very good for a pumpkin fix.  More of a crustless pie than anything.  I used half the can of milk and lowfat margarine because I didn't have any butter.  My very picky daughter loved it so I will definitely make this again.

My family and I really liked this pie. The crust is very thin and the filling is just right. It was very easy to make. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices and it tasted very good. I will definitely make this pie again and again thank you Betsy for sharing this recipe with allrecipes.com

I have to say that this is the easiest pie that I have ever made.  I did alter it by using pumpkin pie spice in place of all the others.  Great dessert!

This recipe is extremely easy to make. It is also very tasty. I double the recipe and use a 10" pan. Each time I make it i get rave reviews and asked for the recipe. Thanks

It's nice to not have to worry about a crust for pumpkin pie.  Tastes as good as other pumpkin pie recipes I've had only this one is easier and it comes with its own built in crust!

I think this pie is easier than most because I dont have to use fresh pumpkin.
