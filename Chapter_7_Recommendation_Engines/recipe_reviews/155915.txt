A really good cookie! It is my experience with gingerbread cookies, that the dough will be sticky, there is nothing wrong with this recipe. I had to add a minimal amount of flour as I was rolling the cookies out and the they stuck to the glass I was using to cut out round cookies. With the last of the dough I tried rolling (about a spoonful) per cookie, into small balls and then flattening them a bit with a spatula. These turned out great and were so much easier than trying to roll out the dough. The cookies were a little thicker and very good that way.

As written, this recipe was way too sticky and the dough had already been chilling for an hour before I tried to work with it.  I think I've ended up putting about two cups of flour or more into it just from lining the work surface and recovering but it doesn't seem to have helped much.  The dough was delicious, however.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used Granny Smith applesauce, which gave a much more potent apple flavor.  I didn't make the icing, though.  I like them just fine without it!

I LOVE this recipe!! Yes the dough is sticky, but isn't that the way all gingerbread cookie dough is? When I rolled them out I made sure to use plenty of flour--- no longer sticky! I give it 5 stars because it was easy to make, didn't make hard crunchy cookies, perfect consistency inside, and tasted great!! Thanks BallerinaBaker!!

yes. alert to high altitude cooks (7000ft) you should add 1-1/2 to 2 cups flour to achieve not so sticky mix.

Delicious cookies. The dough was too sticky to roll out so I used a scoop and made drop cookies.  They flattened well but had to bake 13-15 minutes.

Perfect is definitely an over statement. I followed this receipe to a T and the dough was so sticky, I had to add more flour and more flour just to roll them out. Then when I tried to use the cookie cutters, the dough would completely fall apart in my hands transferring them to the cookie sheet. My kids and I were so frustrated and will never use this recipe again.
