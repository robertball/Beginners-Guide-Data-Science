This is excellent...super easy, I wouldn't change a thing! I would suggest cutting up the veggies one day & cooking the next. It freezes well. I love to mix it w/ sour cream or cream cheese & eat w/ tortilla chips. Yummy!!!

I love this recipe. It always is a hit and so easy to make.  To make it even easier, I use 4 cans of white shoepeg sweet corn rather than fresh husked corn - just as good and often better.  I also add more cucumber than recipe calls for. Great with Thanksgiving turkey and you can make it a day ahead.

Oops, I forgot to add the tomato, but it still was good, and I'm sure it would be even better with the tomatoes.  Tastes like good, old fashioned, freshly-made corn relish and has the right balance of sweet-sour.  We had it last night served over grilled chicken, and my husband raved about it.

Yummy!  I used grape tomatoes and did not remove the seeds since they are so tiny.  Great relish on a roast beef and cheese sandwich!  I use my favorite corn on the cob from our local farm produce which is so fresh and sweet!

I made it for hubby who likes it on cottage cheese.  He tried it and continued to add more  between bites.   I used our garden tomatoes and peppers.   Also adjusted recipe to 28 servings since I had only two ears of corn.

use frozen corn in microwave packages...and don't cook the ingredients together...all are raw and super crunchy except the cooked corn...anyone who tastes some always wants more or some to take home with them, even my 79nyr old crotchety husband loves the stuff

Better than store bought for sure!  Served with sour cream and chips...I halved the recipe and it was almost all gone in one day!  Didn't have the celery seeds on hand so I threw in a little celery salt. Thank you for the recipe!
