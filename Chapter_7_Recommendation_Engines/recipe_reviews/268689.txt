Delicious. Couldn’t find the right sauce so I just used Chile sauce and added some hot sauce.

My husband is raving about this dish and even proposed making it for Christmas dinner.  It has a great combination of the sweet and creamy sweet potatoes paired with the mildly spicy beef.  We will definitely do this again.  The only change I made was cooking it ina slow cooker about 4 hours instead of on the stove.

My family loves this recipe. I have used the sauce suggested and I have also substituted another brand. I love the mashed sweet potatoes, but my son and grandson prefer it with rice. I’ve made this at least 5 times this last year. It works great cooking on the stovetop, roasting in the oven or in a crockpot.

It’s so great as recipe says but has so many uses as leftovers. I really love it in burritos.  It’s quick to make for a fast to go meal.

This recipe will definitely be in heavy rotation! Soo good. The shops near me didn’t have the Herdez sauce so I made my own based on the sauce ingredients listed on the Herdez website (guajillo peppers, tomato paste, water, vinegar, garlic, onion, salt, pepper, and added cayenne for an extra kick). I made this for my work lunches for the week, so I portioned the sweet potatoes in separate containers from the stew until I reheated them. 10/10 will make again.
