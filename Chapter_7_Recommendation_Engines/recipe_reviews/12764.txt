I made this over the weekend for fathers' day dinner. It was a big hit. I added the juice of 1 lemon and added 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper instead of the hot pepper sauce. Everyone wanted the recipe!

I made this for a Christmas party and used it to stuff mushrooms.  It was excellent.
Very tasty.  Will definitely make this again.

This was very tasty with a bit of a kick and came together quickly.  I added the juice of 1 lemon, about 8 oz. of sauteed mushrooms (just because I wanted to use them up before going bad)and substituted 1/2 tsp. cayenne for the hot pepper sauce. Also, I did not have a bell pepper so I used diced roasted red peppers in it's place.  I will make this again. Thanks for the post.

I found this recipes very easy and very tasty.  My husband is allergic, so I substituted imitation crab.  I served it when we had out of town company.  Everyone enjoyed it.

This is a fantastic recipe that has also been in my family for years. I use Old Bay Seasoning instead of cayenne or hot sauce, to taste, and I add the juice of 1 lemon. I saute my green bell pepper and onion in olive oil until tender, before adding to the other ingredients. You'll find that gives the dish a blast of flavor.

This was delicious and easy to put into mushroom caps too.
