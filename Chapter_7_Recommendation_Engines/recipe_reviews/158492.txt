I skipped the onions, just because I don't like them, and doubled the dijon mustard, just because I like it. I served it on top of sourdough toast--it was great! Easy and tasty.

This recipe sounded unusual, but the flavors surprisingly worked!  I think next time I'll try with rotisserie chicken.

I thought this dish was suprisingly good. And it looked pretty as well. I liked the unexpected combo of cherries and beans together.
