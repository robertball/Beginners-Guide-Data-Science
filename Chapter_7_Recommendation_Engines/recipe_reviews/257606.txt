this is really good! The only thing I changed is the sweetener. I use 1/4 tsp stevia extract powder instead of honey.

I really dislike giving a bad review but this didn't appeal to me. All of my ingredients were fresh and I used Mexican vanilla. My first instinct was to dust the chocolate chips with some of the flour and I should have gone with that as the chips sunk to the bottom of the cup. The top portion was cooked but the bottom wasn't. I did put it back in the microwave but it just made the portion that was cooked really dry. Sorry, I won't make this again.

Yum! I didn't have coconut flour, so used almond flour for all the flour. Really easy and yummy!

this came out so good and totally helped with my cravings for sweet. i had to modify this a bit based on what i had on hand.  i used three tbsp of almond meal bc i had no coconut flour and subbed truvia for the honey. i need to work on the amount bc i felt it was lacking sweetness. i added some sugar free syrup on top to compensate. i subbed 1 tbsp of butter for the coconut oil. i think bc of that i didn't have any issues with it being dry. i omitted the chocolate chips and didn't miss them at all. i look forward to adding some cinnamon next time to make it taste like mexican hot chocolate. ty for the recipe!

I double recipe. I also added a little more oil to avoid the dryness still not enough, very dry like corn bread. I love the coconut flavor it has and the texture is different than regular but all in all nice cake. You need ice cream or milk or coffee to put with it to soften it up. I cooked mine in a pottery pan and had to microwave it for a least four minutes to cook all the way through.
