I've tried a number of granola bar recipes on this site, and hands down, this is my favorite.  Moist, chewy, and just loaded with flavor.  Followed the recipe to the letter and wouldn't change a thing!!

These are so good and easy to make! I was disappointed that my chocolate chips melted when I poured the hot honey peanut butter mixture over it, but it still tasted so good that it didn't really matter:)

This recipe is a great starting point for ratios. I substituted the rice cereal for extra oats, granola for chopped pecans and sliced almonds, and the dried fruit for seeds (flax, hemp, chia, unsalted sunflower). I used old fashions whole grain oats. Rice cereal goes stale quickly and adds empty carbs. I donâ€™t mind the chocolate melting and mixing more evenly. Not too sweet. I will be making this often way better than any store bought.

Totally stuffed this recipe, because I didn't read the recipe I just added all the ingredients together and didn't melt the liquids first. Also I didn't have granola so I added extra oats and rice puffs instead. Also my son doesn't like much fruit used some currants and added pepitas and sunflower seeds. Also I don't like to use sugar so I used a heaped tblspn of organic peanut and cocoa spread. So after I realized I mucked it up I decided to bake it for about 10min. All in all my son (who is celiac) absolutely loved them and I now have to make them again and remember what I did!

Like making healthy rice crispy treats. I used a cup of trail mix instead of the fruit and chocolate. I also added more dried fruit and chocolate chips. 

Note: keep chocolate in the freezer to keep it from melting as much when mixed in

We love this recipe.  I've tried it twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe.  The next time I added wheat bran to add fiber.  Loved it both times.  Great recipe.  Putting it in my recipe box now.

I use the mini chocolate chips and put them in the freezer for a half hour before adding to the dry ingredients. I also wait about ten or fifteen minutes before adding the hot ingredients to the dry. I've made these five times now, and they come out great!

Super easy! I  didn't have dried fruit or rice cereal or granola, but I added pretzels. I also added vanilla to the peanut butter-honey-brown sugar sauce.

I used homemade granola and added Craisins.  Used Rice Krispies instead of puffed rice.  Added chocolate chips after stirring other ingredients in to minimize melting.  Next time I will just sprinkle on top and press in at the end.  Parchment paper in a jelly roll pan made for easy removal after cooling.  Very tasty with just the right amount of chewiness.  Thanks for an easy and adaptable recipe!

Simple but very good. I added abouy a handful more of chocolate chips. Be careful if you adjust the amounts of ingrediants: too much rice cereal can make the texture gross.

Definitely a keeper.  I added a layer of sugar free chocolate on the bottom and added nuts for crunch.  Big hit with the hubby!

Very good. Made a lot of changes. Did not use granola or rice cereal and it turned out very good. It was a little bit crumbly but over all very good

Added 1 cup of coconut.
Changed the peanut butter to almond butter.
Omitted the granola.
Used dried cherries instead of dried mixed fruit.
Great recipe and sooooo easy.

Really tasty, just made for the second time! First time added toasted pecans (chopped), pepitas and Craisins - this time adding toasted chopped hazelnuts and sunflower seeds. Lining the pan with parchment makes for easy removal (buttered open sides) and pressed hard with the back of a buttered spoon.

Quick, easy recipe, & delicious. I added & substituted a few things. I used organic agave nectar instead of honey. I love fruit snacks so I went all out crazy; I added thinly sliced coconut chips, dried raisins, dried cranberries, dried dates, dried guava fruit. The servings came out to a lot more than I expected (pleasantly so). The  one thing that I can say on a not so positive note is that the chocolate chips melted when I poured the peanut butter mixture.  Not a deal breaker, still gave it a five. Oh, I forgot to butter the pan but it caused no problem.  Eat, enjoy, & be merry!

So yummy!  Found them to be chewy and very flavorful!  We added flax seed to bump up the healthy factor.  Might reduce the brown sugar a bit... but really yummy!  Also added some cinnamon and vanilla! Thanks for sharing!
