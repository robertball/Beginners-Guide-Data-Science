I reviewed this recipe back when it was a personal recipe. I used Yoplait Lemon Burst yogurt and cinnamon grahams. My whole family LOVES this parfait. It's absolutely wonderful, especially in the summertime for a quick, cool dessert.

This definitely is an easy and delicious treat for breakfast that not only tastes good, but is good for you too! I love berries and yogurt so this was right up my alley and the lemon and blueberry flavors complimented each other nicely. I used a low fat lemon flavored greek yogurt and added a little lemon zest to pretty it up a bit. You could easily sub wheat germ or granola for the graham crackers. This is a light and refreshing treat for any time of day that you don't have to feel guillty about!  Thanks for a great recipe Linda (LMT)!

Note: I make this with varying combinations of fruit, yogurt flavor and grahams. Try strawberries, vanilla yogurt and chocolate grahams. Kids love when you make these with Teddy Grahams which you can leave whole. Be creative and enjoy!

This was tasty but very sweet.  If you don't like very sweet things stay away - otherwise you may like it.

Made this tonight for dessert.  Was very good for the calories.
I used lemon burst low fat Yoplait and all liked it.  I will make again.  Will try with different flavors of yogurt and fruit.  It satisfied my craving for something sweet.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is absolutely delicious!  I  have always had a hard time liking yogurt but I started making this a few months ago and literally have it for breakfast almost every morning. I use the graham sticks for more crunch factor.  THANKS for sharing this recipe!

I was looking for a new idea for breakfast - getting tired of the vanilla yogurt with strawberries - so I decided to give this recipe a try.  I was skeptical of the lemon yogurt, but it was awesome!  I used Yoplait Lemon Burst, a handful of blueberries, and some Honey Maid cinnamon graham crackers.  The flavors complement one another extremely well.  I think it would also be good with pecans to add a little protein, but I haven't tried this yet.  Thank you for posting this great idea!
