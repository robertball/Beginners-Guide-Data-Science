... that should be 1/2 tsp. of dry mustard not 1/2 cup. With half a cup of dry mustard it could change the cook into a 'lifer' after all of the guests have died.

Just finishing up eating my first batch. I halved the recipe for the two of us. I left out the peppers since neither of us like them. I will cut down on the bread crumbs next time and maybe add some Parmesan to the topping. Other than that, pretty easy and tasty.

12-24-15 ~ The kids were here for Christmas, so we had this for Christmas Eve breakfast.  It was a big hit with the 4 of us.  I realized, after the casserole had almost finished baking that I didn't add the bread crumb layer.  No worries, it is great with out it.  I halved the recipe as I didn't want any leftovers.  Delicious - and I would make it again.

I used cornflakes or special K on the top instead of the breadcrumbs.
