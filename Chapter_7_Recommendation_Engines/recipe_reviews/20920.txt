I have made this recipe two times. The first - per the instructions. It was way to wet, but good flavor. The second time I grated the zucchini and lightly salted it and put it in a collander for about an hour. I squeezed the zucchini at the end of that time before adding it to the recipe. (I had over a cup of liquid!) I also added all the cheese to the mix instead of using half for the top. Now it was great!!

The first time I made this it tasted like a zucchini
pound cake! I never knew packaged cornbread mix
had sugar in it. Why would anybody do that? The
next time I made it using a mix that didn't have
sugar in it (Shawnee Mills) and it was great! Added
a teaspoon of dried basil and a teaspoon of minced
garlic. I also covered the dish with aluminum foil,
baked for 45 minutes, then removed the foil and
baked for 15 minutes more. A 5 star recipe that is
highly recommended once you get rid of the sugar!

Great recipe and good use of zucchini!  Light, fluffy, excellent cornbread!  Company loved it!!! Update:  You must drain the zucchini...  lightly salt the zucchini and let sit for 15 min minimally to weep the zucchini.  Press out any remaining water before adding it to your mix.  Additions you can add to enhance the flavor: grilled corn off the cob, diced sweet red pepper, green ortega chili's, onion, or any type of spicy cheese.

This was a really tasty and useful recipe for the zucchini windfall of the summer garden.  Has anyone tried to freeze it?  It's a great side, but I liked it as a breakfast item.

I followed the recipe except for two things.  I added 1 clove of garlic - chopped fine, and I didn't ust a bag of muffin mix.  I used 1/2c cornmeal + 1/2c of AP flour + 1tsp baking powder.  It was really good & no preservatives.

Next time, I'm going to add 1/2c corn kernels.

This recipe was very good, similar to a quiche in flavor and texture.  Next time I will try addding bacon and spinach to  the mix. It would also be good with Monterey Jack cheese. My suggestions would be: use 1/2-3/4 cup diced onion; be sure to squeeze the water from the grated zucchini before adding (perhaps this is why people are getting gooey results?); add all the cheese except 3/4 cup for topping; and finally wait until the last 15 minutes to add the cheese.  I also covered this with tin foil until the end so it would not scorch the top.  Will make again, it was very easy.

5/31 made it again. This time subbed SHARP cheddar, 3 green onions and yellow squash 3 cups only, no zuke nor salt nor pepper. Added 1/3 cup heavy cream. Family raved about the changes. Otherwise first time: Good zucchini spoonbread. omitted the basil and it tasted great. Maybe could shorten the baking time because the cheese was so done it created a crust. UPDATE: make a day ahead with changes, heat oven to 350 to warm, cut into squares, arrange in bigger pan uncovered, heat for 30 minutes. Tastes like they have been FRIED!!! omg! Wedding reception guests fought over them.

Awesome with a few modifications.  Sliced the squash, and salted it, then laid it out on paper towels to dry out. I used half an onion (and will probably use less next time as I'm not a big onion person), doubled the cheese and mixed in with the rest of the ingredients, added 8oz of sour cream. Baked covered at 350 for an hour, and then broiled for about 10 minutes to make it a little more crisp. Next time I will try a ritz cracker topping.

Strictly for my own notes.  Did not have the package of dry mix so made my own, 1 1/2 c cornmeal, 1/2 c flour, 1 t salt, 1 T baking powder, 2 eggs beaten in measuring cup and then added in enough heavy cream to make 1 cup. Added in the cheese to the corn meal and flour mix and the zucchini shreds.  Mixed it all together with about 1/4 cup oil and then put in 425* oven in a hot, oiled cast iron skillet and let bake for 30-40 minutes. Served with grilled pork chops, mac and cheese, salad, spinach. Awesome! (We don't care for sweet corn bread)

This recipe came out great! Easy and tasty. Using a combination of yellow squash and zucchini made it prettier, and next time I will add in some red bell pepper as well. I agree that it didn't take 60 minutes, and I would recommend waiting to add the cheese on top until it is almost done baking.

Very good...think it could be a great alternative to stuffing during the holidays.  A few alterations:
-add a bit of garlic powder
-add 1/2 of a diced red pepper (yummy addition while adding come color)
-use a sweet vidalia onion instead of regular white...I feel like it complements the sweetness of the cornbread.
-I put probably 6 of the 8 oz of cheese into the mixture (definitely more than half)  
-I cooked it in a 2 1/2 quart baking dish, which I think allowed it to cook more evently (no mush).

Unique and very good...I'll definitely make again.  Thank you!  :-)

Delicious! I shredded 3 good sized zucchinis with the skin on, put into a colendar, and sprinkled lightly w salt. After 15 minutes, I squeezed out the excess water. I used 1/2 very large sweet yellow onion, Jiffy conrbread mix (in my opinion, the best), and sharp cheddar cheese.  I covered the dish with foil for the 1st 30 mins. Total cooking time 55 minutes. I made this a couple of weeks ago and my mouth is watering just writing this.

Wow this came out soooo great - unexpectedly!  Very much like a quiche with a lightly sweet taste to it if you use the jiffy corn bread mix.

I'm hesitant to review the recipe since I made so many modifications to it, but I wanted to share how I cooked it in case others want to try it. I'm rating it 4 stars because I think it would be a little bland as written, but with my modifications it was delicious! I browned and crumbled a pound of sausage in a hot skillet, then removed it from the pan with a slotted spoon. In the same pan, I sauteed the onion, along with a chopped red pepper and the kernels from two ears of grilled corn on the cob. Other than that my only changes were to add 3/4 of the cheese to the mix and cook for 45 minutes, then sprinkle the remaining cheese on top and cook until melted - about 5 minutes longer. Oh, and I cooked it in a greased 9x13 dish instead of the 2-qt casserole. If I make it again (and I probably will!) I may add a can of chopped green chiles and serve it with salsa on the side. Very tasty, and a great way to use up zucchini!

This tasted a heck of a lot better than what I thought is was going to!!!  I read some reviews and put a little salt on shredded zucchini then put in a colander for an hour.  Afterwards, I followed what seemed to be the most important step according to the reviews:  YOU MUST SQUEEZE AS MUCH WATER OUT AS POSSIBLE!!!  I couldn't BELIEVE how watery fresh zucchini was.  Since I read reviews first, I had none of that gooey issue.  I decided to put all the cheese in at the same time.  May try the original way next time.  Either way, it exceeded my expectations.

Intended this to be a side dish but hubby dug in early and this wound up as the main course! Chopped the zucchini instead of shredding and added a cup of frozen corn. Delicious!

My rating is for the recipe exactly as given.  The first time I took the advice of another reviewer, lightly salted the zucchini and squeezed out the excess water (big mistake) but didn't change anything else.  Well it was way too dry and lacked flavor.  There’s not a lot of liquid in the recipe to begin with.  I made this for the second time yesterday with these changes:  1. DID NOT squeeze out the water from the zucchini.  2. Added a half cup of sour cream.  3. Added a third egg.  I took this with the above changes to a church potluck and was inundated with requests for the recipe.  It was fabulous – moist and very savory.  It seems the recipe author intended for it to be moist hence the last part of the name “casserole”.

This casserole was delicious.  I used my homegrown zucchini which was not watery at all.  I did, however, add a small can of diced "hot" green chile peppers and also grilled two ears of corn, sliced off the kernels and added this to my recipe. I also added about 1 c. of cheese to the mix and an addition 1 c. on top.

This was GREAT! So much better than I anticipated! I did follow some of the other suggestions. This is what I did: I love Jiffy cornbread mix, so I used it, yes a lil sweeter, but great! You don't really taste the cornbread as much as you think you might. I added about 1/2 c sour cream, 1/4(ish) tsp basil, I only had about 3c of shredded zucchini, I got about 50%+ of the water out. I put it all in a clean dishtowel and squeezed out the excess water. I used sharp cheddar cheese and about 1/2 cup of the 3 cheese, cheese crumbles on the top. I added all but the cheese crumbles and 1/2 (ish) cup of the sharp cheddar cheese to the mix then added what I reserved on top. I used a small/med sized vidalia onion, and 3 eggs. I would like to add frozen corn to it next time. I covered it for the first 30 mins, then uncovered for the last 30 mins. This was YUMMMMMY! I really enjoyed it. Looks pretty much like the pic posted as well. If you like cornbread and zucchini, this is for you! Thanks for the recipe!!

I've been making this recipe for months- it's a standard in our house now. My only change is to sautee the onions in a little butter or olive oil first. We've also tried adding a can of corn (drained) to the mix. My boyfriend likes it better with extra corn. I like it both ways. This is an excellent side dish.

I loved this dish!  I used the 50% fat cheddar and only used 4 oz.  Skipped the cheese topping and did not miss it.  3 large zucchinis = 4C shredded for me.  Would make a wonderful appetizer cut into 1" squares.  I baked mine in a 2 quart rectangular dish and got 12 average servings.  Highly recommend that you try this one!  Thanks for the recipe.

Outstanding recipe! The only thing I did diffrently was dice, not grate the zucchini & add a dash of garlic powder because I love it. The recipe came out perfect...not too wet at all. Thanks, Diana!

I love this recipe. I have now made it 3 times and each time it has been a hit. I did add some garlic and Italian seasoning to the recipe, but basically there was no need to make any changes.

This is soooo delicious.  It is like a cornbread with zucchini flakes in it.  I made it just as the recipe called for.  I used an Old Glory Cornbread mix with 3g of sugar.  Another poster had complained of it being too sweet.  This was perfect.  Another said it needed something so I have a little grinder with Italian seasoning in it and I ground a bit of that in there.

Mine looks just like the picture #1.  I did use my food processer and finly chopped the Zucchini and onion.  I salted it and drained it for about an hour and then squeezed it dry.

It is wonderful.

Great way to use Zucchini.  I hand grated or shred the Zucchini - did not use a food processor.  Used Jiffy Cornbread mix.  Left out the salt - did not need it.  Stirred in the cheese - only needed to bake for approx. 40 minutes.  Added some sausage - would be great with a bit of bacon and a handful of corn.  Good on its own.  Kids liked it, too!

This was amazing ... the first poster must not have done something right, because it  came out perfectly for me ... light and fluffy and eggy and cheesy ... it was very easy to make, too! And I definitely didn't need to cook it for an hour, I think it might have been in there for 25 minutes.

This dish is a family favorite. We do it a little differently though. Instead of corn muffin mix we use Bisquick and we use fresh parmiggiano cheese.

Great and yummy!! Yes, I did tweak it but I do all recipes that I try. I added an extra egg. I would agree draining the zucchini and I just didn't have the energy to do that. I thought the consistency was fine but can imagine it being better if the zucchini had less moisture. I also added a cup of corn which adds a nice crunch.

I devoured this. Somewhere between quiche and cornbread, this has the potential for many more creative applications. I added some cream to the eggs and beat them with a handmixer to emphasize the quiche-like side of this dish. Then I simply mixed that with half flour, half cornmeal and some baking powder. I plan to try all sorts of veggies, meats, and cheeses in this base.

Needs a little crunch, perhaps bacon and the red pepper sounds great.   We are also thinking of using green onions instead of the yellow onions and adding a topping to make it crunchy perhaps crushed butter crackers.

This was really good!  I sauteed the onion in butter for a few minutes before mixing it with the rest of the ingredients.  I didn't use a whole onion becuase it was a large one.  I grated the zucchini on a box grater, and there was no excess liquid.  The corn muffin mix that I bought (Martha White) was only 7.5 ounces, so I added a little of the bagged buttermilk cornmeal mix that I had on hand.  I mixed in all of the cheese instead of saving some for the top.  The consistency was just right.  I baked it in a 10" square Corningware dish.  I covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes, then uncovered it and baked it for 20 more minutes.  An hour would have been too long.  It got golden brown on top.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is delicious!  I read the reviews and used some Italian seasoning. I also poured 1/2 the zuchinni cornbread mix into the pan, then layered with sliced tomatoes.  Then topped with the reamining mixture and more sliced tomatoes, sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

This is amazing!  I followed another reviewer's tip and subbed 1/2 c. flour and 1/2 c. corn meal (I used polenta as this is what I had) and 1 t. baking powder.  I was craving a savory side dish! I also allowed zucchini to drain and squeezed out excess liquid.  I cooked 45 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered.  Perfectly delectable!  Thanks for sharing recipe!  And thank you reviewers for your helpful tips!

The flavor is fantastic, presentation not so much.  I would suggest putting all the cheese inside or waiting to add to the top, it was very hard to cut through.  It also didn't have a "bread" texture at all, mine turned out very wet, but like I said, it did have great flavor.

Added chopped pickled jalapenos and it was very good.  I should have taken the time to squeeze dry the zucchini for it seemed to have a little too much liquid.

Recipe is very good. Reading the reviews gave me several ideas. I added a roll of spicy sausage(sauteed the sausage with onion and chopped fresh jalapeno peppers)and I also use the corn muffin mix without sugar. My hubby does not like his cornbread sweet. Recipe is another great way to use up the fresh zucchini.

Excellent!!  What a great way to get my family to eat (and enjoy) zucchini!  I had no issues at all with this getting soggy, but I hand-grated it rather than using a food processor, which I'm guessing is why some people had issues with sogginess.  I also grated it coarsely instead of finely.  My 10yo daughter even liked it!  And it was a nice lunch of leftovers the following day.  :)  I will definitely be making this one again.

This a very easy and tasty casserole. I only made three small changes, I added another egg, a 1/2 can of corn kernels and I used scalloped squash and zucchini. Yummmy!

This was delicious.  I did drain  some of the liquid from the zucchini but left some in.  Also,
sauteed 1/2 small onion and added 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic.  I  cut back a couple ounces of the cheddar cheese.   I added  the cheese into the mixture but didn't add it to the top.  Left it in the oven covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for the next 30 minutes, as someone else suggested.  Perfect results.   I was wondering how this recipe would be with drained frozen spinach.  Has anyone tried it?

I make this recipes several times each year during zucchini season, it's one of my favorites due to the ease of preparation and the simple list of ingredients.  I love the moist texture, I always use the "too big" zucchini for this recipe, they tend to be dry so excess moisture hasn't been a problem.  I haven't made any changes to the original recipe, I think it's a keeper as is.

I have made the recipe 3x this summer.  It is pretty yummy.  I cut back on the cheese after the first time.  I am not a huge fan of Cheddar(it has its places).  I just didn't think the recipe needed all of it.  I also added cooked and crumbled bacon in it once also.  That was real yummy.

Drain the zucchini!!!  I didn't and regret it.  I baked it for an hour and twenty minutes and it still wasn't firm.  I may try again with drained zucchini instead.   The flavor is good. It smells amazing while baking.

This recipe is so dang good. I actually did not grate the zucchini because I was worried about it being too watery. I actually sliced the zucchini super thin. It looks cool this way and it has a less mushy texture. Try it!

This is a great and simple recipe.  The only changes I made was adding half cheddar and half mozzarella cheese and about a half cup of frozen corn.  I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder and about a table spoon of red pepper flakes for a slight spiciness!

Made these tonight (night before thanksgiving) in a MUFFIN PAN! so incredibly delicious. Drained the zucchini for an hour, added corn, used trader Joe's cornbread mix (3/4 of the box). Family can't wait to devour all of them tomorrow.

Have used this recipe twice now and both times it came out perfect.  I used zucchini the first time and yellow squash the second (because that's what I had).  I am not a fan of zucchini/squash, this is a way to use those veggies and have a great experience with the taste.

This casserole is super easy to prepare and the hour that it takes to bake is well worth the wait. It keeps well in the frige or freezer, microwaves well. I am a diabetic and this dish doesn't raise my blood sugars. Real comfort food.

This is very good.  I added diced yellow pepper, a little diced pickled jalapenos, some cooked and diced bacon, and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.   I salted, drained and squeezed the zucchini.  I used mexican shredded cheese (1/2 cheddar and 1/2 jack).  Will definitely keep this recipe and continue tweaking until I get it just how I like it.   This is a keeper, I think anyone would like this.

This was pretty good.  As per others suggestions, I salted the zucchini and let it sit for about 15 minutes and then removed as much liquid as I could.  Used mont-jack cheese because it's what i had on hand.  Will def make again.

This was very good - I forgot to put in the salt and pepper and it definitely needs it. But I will make this again. I especially enjoyed the cheese in the recipe.

Yummy and easy! I made it exactly as the recipe states, but I made sure to DRAIN the zucchini first. I just shredded it, lightly salted, and let it sit in a colander and then wrung out after about 15 minutes. I will add a bit less onion next time, about 1/2 an onion should be good.

I made this last night to go with steaks that we cooked on the grill.  It was wonderful.  Used the food processor to shred the zucchini and I did let it sit salted in the strainer for an hour to drain the excess water.  This will go into the regular side dish rotation.

I loved the consistency of this, very moist.  I, like others, added some chopped, pickled jalapenos.  Since I baked mine in a 9X13 inch pan, it only went for about 35 minutes.  Yum.

I salted the shredded zucchini and let it sit in a colandar in the sink while I prepared the other ingredients.  I squeezed A LOT of liquid from the zucchini with my hands.  The mixture was really dry when I tried mixing it with a spoon so I used my KitchenAid to mix all the ingredients together and came out really wet.  I added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic too.  I baked it for 1 hour and it was REALLY mushy and not very good.  So, I put it back in the oven for another 20 minutes and it came out way better - a little chewy and crispy around the edges.  Not bad...needed salt and something else.

Loved this!  The consistency was almost like quiche - with surprisingly few eggs.  I didn't have quite enough zucchini, so I used shredded carrots instead, which turned out great and added nice color!  Didn't have boxed corn muffin mix, so we followed another reviewer's instructions (1/2c cornmeal + 1/2c of AP flour + 1tsp baking powder).

Yum!  I made very few changes, and it turned out great.  I hand-grated my zucchini and did not need to drain it as others suggested.  I did use BaconSalt instead of regular salt to give a bit bacon flavor that some suggested- it would have been great with plain salt, too.  It did not take a full 60 minutes to bake.

I agree with most of the reviews that say this was a very moist dish. I would try to get as much water out of the zucchini as you can. But also remember that is this a casserole, not a cornbread, so it's okay if it's falling apart some. My family enjoyed it very much.

I chose to alter this recipe and have it more like cornbread than a casserole so instead of 1 box of Corn muffin mix I used 2. I also added 1/4 cup of milk and sliced up two slices of bacon and added to the mix. I also added all the cheese to the mix and didn't put any on top. This came out fabulous! Couldn't even tell there was zucchini in there so the kids gobbled it up! Great idea!

Delish! I made to accompany dinner last night and to use up a very large zucchini that I received from my neighbors garden. I used a clean towel to squeeze out the excess liquid.

Decide to give this a try tonight.  It's not too bad... kids even liked it.  It definitely does not taste like quiche (which I read in one review), but also not a sweet cornbread.  An interesting blend of flavor.  I did cut back on the onion (added about 1/2 cup) and I'm glad I did.  And it only needed to cook for 40 minutes.

This was very good. I added some browned mild Italian sausage then sprinkled on the cheese. Also added a can of corn. I really couldn't imagine it without the meat- would be very bland. Once prepared, it was topped off with garden fresh salsa. Made it for breakfast the other day and everyone really enjoyed it.

Was pleasantly surpised at how good this was.  After reading reviews; I did microwave the onion for about 25 seconds to soften it.  I usually prefer to do a recipe as written once and then change for our taste.  But wouldn't change a thing about this one.  This is a real keeper for that bumper crop of zucchini.

I normally don't take the time to rate the recipes I find here, but this was too good not to rate.  I have made it as stated above, and I have varied it using ricotta or parmesan cheese (which I mix in with everything else instead of holding some back to put on the top).  I also tried it using half shredded carrots/half zucchini. I always use red onion, though, and the combination of the 2-3 three colors makes a very pretty presentation (which you don't get if you sprinkle the top with cheese.)

This is my favorite way to use Zucchini! I love any type of squash but my family usually won't even try it. This is the exception! I made this exactly as written except I squeezed the water out of zucchini as others suggested. I also cut back on the amount on onions and slightly sauteed them before adding to the rest of mixture. Turned out beautifully! I will make this again and again! Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a brunch and made a few changes. I used 3 eggs instead of 2, and I diced and cooked 10 strips of bacon and sprinkled over top with the cheese  during the last 20 minutes of baking time. Delicious. Guests thought it was made with shredded hash browns, not zucchini. A definite keeper.

Great recipe, vey similar to one we use that uses alot more fat, i.e. canned soup and sour cream.  I have added canned corn or leftover corn on the cob to this casserole for extra sweetness and crunch.  Try it you will love it!

I used about half the amount of zucchini and cheese and added corn and jalapeños. I also found it useful to salt the zucchini in a colander and then squeeze the water out.  Even the corn bread haters enjoyed.

This was delicious. After reading others'reviews, I also cut the shredded zucchini to 3 cups, about 1/4 cup shredded onion and accidently added the whole 8 oz. of Sharp Cheddar cheese to the mixture. I went ahead and sprinkled another cup of cheese on top. I baked the dish covered for 30 miutes and then uncovered for the last 30 minutes. It turned out perfectly. I am going to make this for my church's frozen food fundraiser event.

As a cornbread lover I found this recipe to taste great. I cooked it slightly longer than listed, I cooked until a knife cam out clean after inserted into the middle of the dish. I cooked at 350° for 1 hour and 18 minutes. The casserole came out moist and firm, easy to serve, tasted wonderful.

Wow!  We're trying to work a greater variety of veggies into our diet.  Hubby and I are NOT big fans of zucchini but this was really, really good!  I baked for 35 minutes, then added the cheese on top and baked for an additional 15 minutes and it seemed perfect.  We're definitely making this again and again.  Thanks!

I discovered this recipe today and made it tonight.  I preheated a (slightly oiled) cast-iron skillet and then baked it in that for 60 minutes as directed.  I did wait until it had cooked for 30 minutes before adding the cheese topping.  I thought the taste was delicious and the texture perfect. (I did only add about 1/3 of an onion because my husband will not eat anything with more onion than that.  It still was very tasty, but I believe it would be even a bit more so with more onion.) We ate it as a main dish with a large salad and were very satisfied.  I will definitely make it again!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This was easy to make and delicious! Reminds me of stuffing. Make sure you drain the zucchini and pat the water out before using it.

I loved this recipe.  It was a great dish which pleased everyone. I made it just as the recipe stated and it turned out moist and delicious. I was picturing more of a traditional cornbread consistency when I was making the dish but the product is creamy and moist.  It makes a great side dish for summer meals.

There were a dizzying number of reviews that suggested either draining or not draining the zucchini prior to baking this dish, so I made it just as instructed - no changes - and did not drain the the zucchini. It turned out perfectly, like cornbread that has zucchini in it. Served as a side with casseroles etc and it was great. I have made it since with corn (a must have addition in my opinion), red peppers, hot peppers, etc and all have been great. You can really play around with this.

I love zucchini and corn bread so this combo was delicious! I may have baked this one a little too long so next time I would start checking to see if its set after 25 minutes.

This won great reviews by my guests and I will definitely serve it again. I added some shredded carrots for color and drained the zucc like previous reviewers suggested. I used a sharp vermont white cheddar which gave the dish great flavor. It was still really moist so I would probably work at draining more of the water out next time.

i was NOT impressed. i salted the zucchini and "weeped" them like the reviews suggested. Other than that, I followed the recipe- it was dry, the cornbread didn't fluff or hold the veggies together. The cheese way beyond chewy- and it was sweet in some parts and salty in others. I will not be making this again.

This was a great way to use up my extra summer zucchinni. After reading the recipe through, I knew my family would love this even more with some cooked crumbled bacon and sliced smoked sausage layered on top of the mixture and then covered with the remaining cheese. My husband said, "this is a keeper"!

Great Recipe! Defintely "sweat out" the zucchini a bit by adding some salt and letting it sit in a colander. Then, squeeze out the excess with a paper towel. Dont worry if you dont get every ounce of fluid out...just reduce the amount of liquid(usually milk or water) in your corn muffin mix recipe a bit. I followed the recipe except I added some diced jalapeno and did not top with cheese (only on the inside). Turned out great and disappeared quickly.

This was pretty delicious, however I can't seem to convince myself this belongs in a "casserole" category. It's more of a side because it really is just cornbread with little additions. Would be awesome with a veggie chili or something similar. Overall, yummy.

Absolutely a delicious dish and easy, too!  Great use of some extra zucchini from the garden, turned out exactly like the picture.  The only kind of cheese I had was lowfat, but it didn't make one bit of difference, this casserole looked and tasted so good.  I do recommend using the Jiffy cornbread mix.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent way to use up some of the zucchini in the garden! I used Jiffy cornbread mix and I did lightly salt and drain the zucchini but otherwise followed the recipe rxactly and it was a hit even with my hubby who is already sick of zucchini this year!

Good, but confused if you need to squeeze the moisture out of the zucchini before adding it.  I did not, so it was a moist casserole and needed more cooking, but we still enjoyed it.  5star flavor, 4star on instructions.

Yum Yum!  I only had one zucchini on hand, so I shredded the zucchini, half a sweet onion, and two small potatoes together to make a full 2 cups combined.  Everything else, I did as directed.  There are tons of ways you could play around with this and it still be awesome........I'm thinking some shredded eggplant, maybe some carrots!!!!  This is for sure a keeper!!!!

I was looking for a way to use up some frozen, shredded zucchini and came across this recipe.  I made this as directed but I did salt and drain the liquid off of the zucchini.  Two other small changes - I didn't use a full onion and I didn't have enough cheddar, so I used a mixture of cheddar, mozzarella and a little bit of colby.  Will defintely make this again.

Delicious!!!! Great way to use zucchini! All I did diff was strain the shredded zucchini in a collander using my hands to squeeze the juice out( about a cup). Kids LOVED it and hub (who doesn't eat cornbread) said it's a new fav and "has lots of flavor"!!! Thank u for this!!!

I have made this recipe twice and have loved it both times.  The only changes that I made was to add jalepeno peppers to recipe.   My family likes a little spice.  I cut up three whole fresh jalepeno peppers very fine and added to batter.  Cooked as normal, although I agree that it doesn't take quite an hour, about 50 minutes.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks

This recipe is sooo good. You can pretty much add any other veggies you want to it. I made it exactly like the recipe, and the next time I made it, I added mushrooms & spinach & onions. Either way, it is delicious! (but yes, drain the zucchini)

Excellent - I had tried another version of this recipe on this site before that had too much breading - this was just right (much more zucch than breading, but still stayed together).  Great way to get your zucch fix :)

My son begs me to make this all the time.  I add all of the cheese to the batter instead of saving some for topping, but otherwise I make it as directed.

Absolutely delicious! I have made this recipe several times and I think it gets better each time. I hand-graded the zucchini and blotted out some of the liquid (not all), added about a cup of fresh or frozen corn, a dash or two of garlic powder, 1tbs of an Indian seasoning called Sabja (Sabje), a dash of cayenne pepper, dusted the top cheesy layer with paprika, and covered the casserole for the 1st 1/2 hr of baking as others had suggested. I also blended in 2tbs skim milk when I beat the eggs. It was gobbled up for Thanksgiving at my parent's house, was a hit at a dinner party, was quickly devoured at a morning pot-luck breakfast, and I have been asked the recipe several times. Definitely a new, easy-to-make favorite. THANK YOU!! :)

my family LOVED this, including my pickiest 7-yr old. it's a great recipe that you can add to, i made it as is, next time i omitted the onion, added 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp italian seasoning, 1/4 c parm cheese and used a mozzarella/provolone mixed grated cheese. delicious both ways!

Followed to a tee and it was absolutely delicious and so, so easy.  I put it all together a day ahead and just cooked it before dinner.  I used my food processor with the shredding blade which helped a lot and made a nice even consistency w/ the zucchini.  I will make this forever and especially for pot lucks - everybody devoured it!!!!

I love this recipe.  The only change I made is that I used my cornbread recipe.  I hate jiffy mix-it's not real cornbread and the real stuff is SO easy to make!  I also didn't add the shredded cheese on top until there was only about 20-25 min left of baking time.  It even taste great leftover and cold!  This is a keeper-I will definitely make it again.  We ate it with beef stew.

This was great!  I added a titch more salt to counteract the sweetness of the cornbread and used dried minced onion, which may have cut down on the sogginess some reviewers mentioned as the onions would rehydrate, taking up some of the moisture).  It reminded me of hush puppies, yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

Tried this recipe 2 nights ago.  Would recommend using ingredients as originally given.  I used 2 6oz. pkgs of betty crocker corn bread mix, and 4 eggs, 2tbsp.water, 4C. zucchini chopped up, 2C. frozen corn, 1 med.sz.onion, 1tsp chili flakes and 4 oz. shredded cheddar cheese, no salt added--all ingred. added into the mix.  Baked on 350 for 50 min. and was sl. overdone--dry. Would cut bake time bake 10min. Used a 9x13 pan which seemed fine.  If your recipe turned out too moist, try chopping the zucchini instead, and use a dark pan such as bakers secret.  Nxt time will add browned crumbled italian sausage, and more zucchini, or less cornbread mix. Will bake this again. Thanks to everybody for their good ideas, which I used!

I made this exactly as listed. It was wonderful! I served it as a side to Pork chops. My husband and I loved the slightly sweet taste from the cornbread mix. This is a winner that I will take to my next potluck.

This recipe is a winner!  We are big corn casserole fans and this recipe uses lots of zucchini and is a bit lighter than corn casserole which calls for lots of butter and sour cream.  My son complained about too many onions, but he ate every bite and took seconds.  You might want to be aware of this with the kids.  I used sharp cheddar cheese which made this extra flavorful.  Adding this to our favorites!

Very good and a good way to use zucchini, I didn’t change a thing, but next time I will omit the salt, there is a lot of salt in cheese. Will defiantly make this again. I didn't have any trouble with it being to moist, I would rather have it moist then too dry.

This recipe is incredibly bland. I would say it needs twice the amount of salt and some pepper. I would also suggest sauteing the onions with garlic before adding it to the casserole.

Delicious!  I only used about 3 cups of zucchini and 1/2 an onion, added  about 1/2 cup of milk and some chopped jalapeno peppers.  I also mixed all of the cheese into the batter instead of putting some on top.  I only had to bake mine 40 - 45 minutes.  Turned out great.

I read the other reviews and made a few changes:  added one lb. of browned sausage, diced red pepper, and for a crunchy topping, I added about 3/4 cup of Panko bread crumbs tossed with a little evoo.  This turned out terrific.  Family said this is definitely a keeper.

This was great and it used lots of zucchini.  I wrung out my shredded zucchini in a tea towel just like I do with frozen spinach.  I also added a diced up jalapeno.  I had many requests for the recipe.  Hint - I grated the zucchini in the food processor then did my onion and jalapeno in the processor too.

Very tasty! I was looking for something different from my usual zucchini casserole recipe and decided to try this. It couldn't be easier to prepare and boy is it good. I had no problem with too much water from the zucchini - it came out perfect following the recipe to a "T" and the cooking time of 1 hr. is right on. I couldn't wait for lunch today to have some of the leftovers!

I thought this was very good.  I roasted the onion along with some red bell pepper, used about 3/4 cup of mozzarella and 1/4 parmesan instead of the cheddar and used 1/2 cup egg substitute.  Also added the basil as someone else suggested.

Needs a little extra something.  I'll take reviewers' advice next time and add some diced red pepper and maybe some bacon.  Not a bad way to use up some zucchini.

Wonderful! I, too, squeezed salted zucchini out for about 45 mins - I got about 1-1.5 cups! I also use a larger dish cause its what I found. I substituted/changed: 3 egg whites instead of two eggs, used a little under 1/4 cup of onion instead of one whole, added a chopped jalapeño pepper, used 2% cheese, added 1/2 cup of steamed broccoli, oregano, fresh basil, chives, garlic salt, and a tomato which I added later. I baked the mix minus the tomato for 30 mins. I added a sliced de-seeded tomato to the top and then sprinkled with salt, little bit of bread crumbs, cheese, and a little more bread crumbs and broiled until crispy. Gonna put this into my casserole collection.

What a great starter recipe.  I used 3 cups of zucchini, 1 cup of frozen corn.  I also added 1 clove of garlic (I softened the garlic and onion in a little butter before adding to the mix), I added 8 oz of sour cream, cubed 1/2 a smoked sausage link and browned it in a skillet to cook out some of the grease, and to get a good carmalization, and added that to the mix also, used 16 oz of cheese, half in the mix and half on top (I topped it with the cheese after it cooked for about 20 minutes).  After all those changes, it was a little thick (imagine that!!), so I added a little milk (not sure how much, just to get it to loosen a bit).  I cooked it for the recommended amount of time, and it came out fabulous.  With the meat inside, this was definetly the main course.  Served with salad.  Wonderful!!

Great easy & quick recipe.  Thought it would be a little on the bland side, so I added some garlic. I also softened the onions in the microwave first. Everyone loved it and requested it many more times.

I simply added two boxes of cornbread (and doubled the eggs, etc. also), but left the amount of zucchini the same.  It was delicious.

Came out perfect and solid not too wet at all but I did squeeze some of the excess water out of the zucchini and had shredded it a day before I made this. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe, SO EASY!

I loved this.  It was a nice mix of cornbread, cheese, and zucchini all rolled into one.  I combined cheddar and monterey jack cheeses for flavor.  Didn't even notice the zucchini, a great way to sneak in a veggie for kids!  Also, great the next day warmed up in the microwave.

The zucchini is abundant right now so this was a nice way to use some of it.  I didn't have 8 ounces of any one cheese so I put cheddar in the mix and a 4 cheese blend on top after I had baked it for 45 minutes.  I used a 9x9 glass cake pan which worked very well.  I had fried cabbage II also from this site and grilled pork chops which made a nice combo.  I would make both recipes again.

The recipe as-is was a little too bland, so I used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar and added a little bit of seasoning other than salt/pepper. The end result was awesome tasting! However, I found the consistency to be odd - browned on the top and bottom, but mushy in the middle. I'll definitely make it again, but will squeeze the liquid out of the zucchini to help the overall consistency of the dish.

We ate this for dinner, but I think it would be excellent for brunch as well! This is a great main dish if you  prefer to keep meat out of your diet, but next time I think I would like to try adding some diced ham.   I prefer to bake it for 45-55 minutes then add the extra cheese topping and an additional 15 minutes to bake time. I also scaled back the onion to about 1/2c. Yummy!

I made this last night and it was good!  I added some ground up spicy italian chicken sausage to it and I'm glad I did!  It needed a little something extra for flavor.  This would make a nice side dish for a brunch.  It's good!

I really liked this recipe. So did my family, except for my little sister, but she's a picky eater. This is a great zucchini recipe and one that I've been using a lot. My only problem with it is that it tends to be "gooey" in the middle and dark around the edges.

I did not like this recipe at all!  My husband couldn't even finish it!  It reminded me of mushy Thanksgiving stuffing.  But then, we're dry stuffing people.  If you're a mushy stuffing lover you may like this too.  I feel that the sweetness from the muffin mix didn't go with the onions.

Shredded, chopped , or sliced this is a great way to use those zucchini in the summer. Tweak it the way u like .  I made with chunked zucchini  n tomatoes so it was less work n i didnt have to sweat my zucchini ! My personal preference  is to use an unsweetened cornbread  mix n I can go as savory as I like!

Loved it! Made a few changes: made cornbread mix from scratch, added some frozen sweetcorn, and some light sour cream dip. Also drained and squeezed liquid out of zucchini before using.Put all the cheese in the casserole, and topped with some cornmeal mixed with butter. Made 1/2 recipe, and baked in a pie plate.FANTASTIC!

My family loved it.  I didn't have a shredder, so I just sliced and chopped the zucchini into really thin pieces.  I didn't find it to be wet like in a previous post.  And I loved having the sweetness of the cornbread!

I've made this a few times, and it's always good, and enjoyed by all. I put it in a 13x9 pan, and usually end up baking it for more time than the recipe states to firm it up enough. I also mix all of the cheese into the batter, because I like the way the cornbread mix browns on top. It is kind of wet, like the texture of corn pudding recipes that use cornbread mix and creamed corn.

Hands down the best corn bread I've ever had. Based on the reviews, I cut the zuccini in half and added a can of corn in it's place. Also added some green onion & minced garlic. I put the 2nd half of cheese on top the last 10 minutes of baking. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wow this was really yummy. I used a generic corn bread mix that was only 6 oz in total and next time I will use either double the corn bread mix or one that is 8.2 oz like this recipe calls for.  I used my slap chop to chop/dice 5 zucchinis and one large onion.  I also added few dashes of hot sauce and garlic powder.  Next time I will use 3 eggs instead of two so it binds more.  To avoid extra wet zucchini after chopping, I put all of the zucchini on a double layer of paper towels and spread it out and patted it as dry as I could and added salt.  I did notice that the paper towels were soaked through and my casserole was still very moist but not runny.  I think next time I will use extra   muffin mix to have it come out more like a muffin vs. a casserole but it was still really flavorable and smelled so good while baking.  I am sure this can also be done with yellow squash too.

This recipe was very good. I am always looking for recipes that pack in plenty of vegetable goodness, but still adds other flavors to balance the dish.  This dish could easily be a main dish on a night when I am trying to prepare a meatless dinner.  When I made it, I used a rectangular dish and it was not very deep.  When I served it, it was reminiscent of a quiche.  My husband and I packed the left-overs for lunch over the next two days.  It reheated well in the microwave.  I also did not have the full 8 ounces of cheese.  I used about 4 ounces when I made it and it was still plenty of cheese.  I would like to experiment with this recipe to see if I could increase the amount of zucchini and also play with the depth of the dish.

Awesome!  I followed the directions exactly and this came out delicious.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it immensely and I will definitely make it again.  My only feedback is that it was done a bit sooner than an hour; mine was pretty thin, as I used a large glass casserole dish.  Thanks so much!

I have made this 3 times. Great flavor and an easy side dish. Made as is. Don't use too much shredded zucchini as it will be watery.

this was delicious! and it was even better a day old and warmed in the oven. you could use any kind of cheese. it makes a wonderful crispy crust on top. i will only use 1 egg next time because i normally use only 1 in my cornbread and the dish is larger than this. may even try to use my own cornbread mix next time...just to cut down on sugar.  its so good to me, but not very good for me.  i used jiffy mix because i love it so!  this was a very good recipe and easily tailored to your specific taste.

It turned out a little dry but was good. Next time I will try NOT draining off the water, and will add another egg as one reviewer suggested.

Made this for dinner last night, and there was not a bite left! It was so good! Thank you for a great recipe.I used half Zuchinni and half Yellow Squash, salted and drained in collander first to get excess water out.

I used more zucchini (5 cups) and baked it a little longer; we didn't mind that it was a bit mushy in the center. This was a hit with both the husband and the in-laws. I included 2 tablespoons Panko mixed with 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil as a topper before baking. I will include this with the easy-to-make items for family dinners.

Oh my goodness this was SO good!  My 13 year old stepdaughter proclaimed she could eat the whole thing herself.  I did not drain the shredded zucchini as others did and did not find it to "wet"  To me it was perfect.

This turned out great for me! not mushy at all. I used more than 8oz of cornbread mix and mine did not have sugar in it. I used about 11 oz. Also like others said, i shredded the zucchini then wrapped it in paper towel and squeezed the excess water out of it I also used a mixure of cheese. 1 handful of Kraft Habanero shredded cheese and another handful of the Italian blend. The first 30 minutes i covered with foil and poked holes in it to vent. I added more cheese on top during the last 5 minutes of cooking.

This recipe was awesome.  My husband and son (who are not zucchini lovers) both raved about it.  And, we all liked that little bit of sweetness.  Cannot wait to make it again!!

This was ok - we think it could use a little more zip...but, that might just be personal preference as we like things a little zingy. A good way to dress up a zucchini. 
If I make this again, I'll have to think of how to give it some pep to suit our taste :)

I could probably eat the whole pan by myself!  A drained can of corn adds a nice bite, but it's great as it's written.

Outstanding!  I used closer to 6 cups of zucchini and added an extra egg but kept everything else the same.  This is a new favorite to use with our garden zucchini.

LOVED this recipe, as did everyone at the dinner table tonight (had Husband's parents  over and they loved it). I did let the zucchini sit in a strainer for about an hour, then wrung out each fistful of zucchini before putting it in the mixture. It came out perfect. I emailed the recipe to MIL as the FIL loved it. Thanks :)

This was way too sweet for our tastes when made according to the recipe. I used organic corn muffin mix and I should have known that the result would be too sweet. It looked beautiful, though, and has potential, so I may make it again, but with the dry ingredients for a nonsweet cornbread added instead. Thanks!

I was looking for something to do with an abudance of zucchini when I found this.  It's really nice as a side dish, make sure you use a corn muffin mix of appropriate size as I didn't notice when I purchased mine it was a bit less than this calls for.  Family ate it but wasn't something that has been requested again.

Delicious! I added a red bell pepper for some additional color and flavor. I took to heart the reviews that indicated the extreme importance of draining the zucchini well. I drained the zuchhini, pepper and onion. I also decided to go for a more of a quiche consistency rather that the dryer bread consistency. I used Krusteaz fat free honey cornbread mix and used slightly less (about 7 oz.). Perfect quiche consistency!  Next time I might try baking or even dry sauteeing the veggies to cut back on the effort it took to drain everything. Very tasty! Great side dish! (I served with the German Pork Chops and Sauerkraut allrecipes.com recipe.)

I had to put my own twist on it.  I add 1 small can of Ortega diced fire roasted chilis (NOT jalapenos); frozen corn; diced red bell peppers, 1/4 to 1/2 cup coarse cornmeal.  I have made this about 8 times in the last month and can't tell you how many people have requested and received the recipe. Also, this freezes great.

This is only my second review on this site since as I am a cook few recipes really knock me out.  This one did for sure.  I made it as written leaving out the onion and adding frozen corn.  I served it at a luncheon and not a crumb was left.  I was soundly admonished and told that I better make double the recipe the next time.

Great recipe. I used what I had at home. I used yellow squash instead of zucchini and low moisture mozzarella instead of cheddar cheese. I had a large bag of corn meal mix and 1.5 cups is the equivalent to the 8.5 oz bag. I also added some hot peppers as well. It turned out great. Will make again soon.

Wow this was so incredibly good!!  I just made this tonight and I followed the instructions almost exactly, I may have used a bit more cheese (I don't measure much) and it was freshly grated (don't know if that matters).  I also put it in a 9x9 baking dish well oiled as I would if I was making regular cornbread.  Maybe next time I'll add some corn too.  YUM!!  Oh and I used Jiffy Cornbread mix and a very small grate on the zucchini.

The first time I made this, I took reviewers' advice & drained the zucchini. It came out very dry and oniony. The next time, I didn't drain the zucchini, sauted the onion in a little butter before adding it, and only used 1 cup cheese which I mixed in (I didn't put any cheese on top). I baked it in a souffle dish for 1 hour uncovered, and it came out great! My daughter keeps asking me when I'm going to make this again.

My company really like this one...I doubled the recipe but still only used one onion. I also added about 1/4 c. of milk because I thought the mixture was way to dry. Really good cornbread with the zucchini and cheese. Will make again!

I would have given it a 3 1/2 star if I could, but 4 will do. It was good, but a bit to sweet. Next time I'll opt for a cornbread mix that isn't so sweet. Would have been better as a savory dish. The family was split 50/50 on this dish.

We didn't like this, but we didn't hate it either.  It was a little dry.  It wasn't what I expected.

Great dish for brunch.  I made it the night before and heated it prior to eating.  It tasted even better the next day!  I have made the recipe as written and it was good but have also added garlic and italian seasoning for an extra touch of flavor!

I used half yellow squash and half zucchini just because it's what I had.  It came out great.  I really liked it, but my family is not a big fan of cornbread.

I tried this recipe.  I followed the instructions and used exact measurements of ingredients.  Instead of shredding the zucchini, I chopped it because I did not have a hand grater.  My bread was just right.  It had a moist cornbread texture.  I would make this dish again except I would put ground Italian sausage in it and cut back on the onions; they dominated the taste of the dish. Next time I will try another cornbread mix.  Jiffy was too sweet.  All in all, this dish is a good stuffing that have limitless options to suit your taste.

Great recipe! I'm not a fan of cornbread, but this recipe looked tempting. Also a good recipe for using different veggies. I skipped the zucchini and used frozen broccoli and cauliflower (2 cups cut up into smaller pieces) and about 1/2 cup frozen spinach. I did saute 1/2 chopped vidalia onion with 1/2 chopped green pepper. Mixed the cornbread according to the boxed directions and added all the other ingredients (allowing the onion and green pepper to cool and veggies to defrost before adding). Used 1/2 cheddar cheese and 1/2 colby jack. Kept about 1/3 of the cheese for the top during last 15 minutes of baking. I used my convection oven and baked at 300 degrees for one hour. Came out Perfect! Even ate some 'cold' in the morning and thought it taste just as good or even better 'cold'! Might try adding some ham or Polish kielbasi next time. GREAT recipe as posted and for hiding those 'veggies' from the kids (and the man who doesn't like that 'green' stuff)!

Zucchini is notoriously inconsistent in moisture content, depending on size and ripeness, so some adjustments may need to be made for this ingredient.  I do like the sweetness of the Jiffy mix in here, but would probably use more cheese, or perhaps add the sour cream or bacon suggested by others.  We did like it very much.

Wonderful and easy! I used cheddar and mozzarella (because I could) and mixed in most of the cheese, leaving only 1/5 for the top. I followed the advice of others and covered it, removing the cover for the last 20 minutes. Very tasty - It was a big hit at a friend's barbeque last night! We even got a 2 year old to 'eat her zucchini' because she thought it was cake! I think I'll try adding mild anaheim chilis for the next batch. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is so good!  I used rather a large zucchini as that was all I had.  Had to make my own cornmeal mix as it doesn't seem to be available in Canada and used egg substitute.  Baked it in a large cast iron skillet.  Didn't seem too moist at all, maybe due to the large zucchini. Can't wait to serve it for supper and see if everyone else likes it.

Very good. Made as written its fab.   For my taste I also added some leftover chopped pork tenderloin and mixed the cheese in along with going on top. I liked the cheesy crust on top. Next time if I use zucchini from my garden I will really, really squeeze the moisture out. It was a little on the moist side but still good. Tasted like stuffing. Yum.

Great recipe. Followed it almost exactly (added diced garlic). One thing that I will do differently next time though: change the amount of sugar in it. The cornbread mixture was a little too sweet for me. Otherwise, you can do all sorts of great stuff with this recipe: different kinds of cheeses, throw in some spinach, etc. I do prefer it without meat though - the zucchini can definitely stand on it's own. Thanks!

Wow, wow, wow!  This is one of the best ways to use up fresh, summer zucchini - second only to zucchini cupcakes ;)  I made this exactly as written (except I did drain my shredded zucchini by placing it in a clean kitchen towel and squeezing it) and it was fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe... will definitely use as a go-to side dish!

Was pretty good.  Used the Jiffy brand corn bread mix and my family thought it was too sweet.  Will definitely make again but use regular corn meal.

This is wonderful.  I followed other suggestions and salted and squeezed the zucchini, added red pepper, didn't put cheese on the top at all, but did cover with foil for the first half hour.  Also, I baked this in a muffin tin so I could freeze easily - we'll see how that turns out.  But they are delicious. Moist, nicely peppered, red pepper gives it good color.  I used Trader Joe's cornbread mix - 1/2 of it.

I just made this tonight.This is what I did: used 2 additional eggs, used (self rising) corn meal meal mix- Martha White brand. 1 Cup corn meal, 1.5 cups buttermilk, 1/4 cup olive oil. Stirred it up and dropped by spoonfuls on top of zucchini/egg/onion in the caserole dish. I only put cheese on top of corn meal batter. My husband LOVED the crust-it may improve the recipe. Plus  I have A LOT of corn meal mix left still.

I did not care for this recipe. I made it exactly as said and mine came out all soggy and wet.  It was like a zucchini and corn bread slop. I even drained my zucchini after shredding it, so I dont know what went wrong. I wont be mking this again. Too bad because the idea was great.

This was delicious.  I tweaked the recipe before I started and added diced, cooked bacon and minced garlic to the mix. Instead of muffin mix, I made my own by using just the dry ingredients of a corn muffin recipe. I couldn't find ready made muffin mix in the store, and now I have extra ready for the next time. I agree that one hour is much too long, and the cheese should be only the last few minutes.  As for wetness, I found it was just fine.  It's a keeper!

This was so-so. The cheese on top ended up being hard when it was done baking. If I make it again I'll cover it during baking. I was hoping it'd be better though.

I did this exactly as it said but it came out with not quite enough flavor for us and a little dry. I did grate the zucchini the night before and stored it in the fridge so maybe they lost moisture and that is why...I would add some more spices next time. My guests loved it though so I may try again with freshly grated zucchini.

Made exactly as the recipe is listed except I mixed the cheese into the casserole and did not put any on top.  Even my zucchini hating kids ate it. Simple and very good!

This was good, but not so good as left overs.  I would make this with chili during the winter, but zucchini season is during the summer months.

This is a great recipe!  I agree with other reviews that it is almost like a quiche.  I am going to make it again but add some jalepinos and bacon for a little kick and serve for breakfast!

Wow, I got this recipe from someone's comment on another recipe and it is great!  I followed the helpful hints of squeezing the zucchini and yellow squash, plus added minced garlic and basil.  Mine cooked in a 2 qt dish for 50 minutes and turned out great!  My red meat loving husband even loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I added a good amount of minced garlic and used finely chopped zucchini instead of shredded, but otherwise I followed this as described, and it was a little dry for me.  I would probably add something like stewed tomatoes next time to give it more moisture.

I improviced this recipe quite a bit. I had left over corn mush that was rejected by my husband for being too bland. I mixed it with eggs, cheese, and extra seasonings. I used late season vegetables from my garden such as zucchini,  broccoli, leek, and collards. I topped it all with cheese and bread crumbs. It came out pretty good. I bet tomorrow it will be delicious. A great way to use left over corn mush instead of throwing it away, never thought of it in a casserole. I think the whole dish cost me $2.00.

What a great new way to use cornbread mix! I didn't have zucchini so I used 2 cups yellow squash (squeezed dry) and 2 cups carrots. Used a small onion and minced a dried basil leaf. To cut back on calories I only used 2 ounces of cheddar cheese. Used foil for the first 45 minutes. It looked so pretty I couldn't wait to try it. It is moist and tasty.  Addicting!

I used Trader Joe's cornbread mix, which is pretty sweet.  I left out the salt, drained the zucchini dry of most of its moisture, and made it in a 13x9 pan.  I added the second batch of cheese the last 15 minutes of baking.  Baked it for about 40-45 minutes.  This was a great recipe.  Definitely will make again.
(The second time I made it I added cooked, crumbled bacon.  Yum-o!)

This tasted great.  I didn't have time to drain the zucchini so I added a little more cornbread mix.  This only needed to be baked for about 45 minutes.

Made some changes/additions: Sauteed red onion, garlic and bell pepper beforehand.  Used one fresh tomato in the mix and a bunch of fresh basil.  Mixed half the cheese in while cooking and browned the other half with 10 minutes left to cook.  The additional veggies made it yummy.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I don't usually have cornbread mix laying around, so I just used half of the dry ingredients listed on the back of the cornmeal bag. I leave the sugar out however and turn this into a more savory dish. I like to use pepper jack and spices like cumin, coriander, red pepper and garlic to give it a Mexican flare. Serve with sour cream and it's delish! I use a 2 & 1/2 quart casserole dish and make a double batch. I also grate the onion while I have my food processor out and squeeze a bit of the water from it so things aren't too too wet. Also cooks very well in a 9x13 glass dish if done carefully.

My girlfriend and I loved this recipe.  I made a few changes that others recommened, such as draining the zucchini in a collander and adding all the cheese to the mixture instead of using it for topping.  I also used some cajun seasoning for some more flavor.  Very good and a very good way to use up our zucchini.

I used 4 eggs and an extra 1/2c. corn meal miffin mix.  I baked it at 375 for about 40 mins.  Very moist.  Very good.  It kind of tastes like Long John Silver's hush puppies.  Next time I might deep fry the dough to make fritters.

Let's start off with saying I CANNOT COOK.  However, even I was able to cook this... and it came out really well!!! I took others' advice and sauteed 1/2c onion w/garlic to soften it all up and I used sharp cheddar cheese, sprinkling only 1/4th of it on top (mixing the rest in) before cooking it.  THIS RECIPE IS FAIL-PROOF!!!!

Very good recipe! Changes I made: I finely chopped my zucchini and had it lay out on paper towels for an hour, I added Rosemary, and also added 6 slices of chopped bacon on top of the casserole with the cheese topping. My husband loved this and was excited thinking it would be an amazing side dish on Thanksgiving.

AWESOME!!! this casserole/quiche is great!!  I only had two zuccini's on hand (a little over 2 cups when shredded) so i halfed the recipe and it came out amazing.  I cooked it for 45 minutes covered in foil and then added the top layer of cheese and baked for the remaining 15 minutes as reviewers suggested.  Great recipe!

This was very good as is and my wife loved it.  I basically stuck to the original recipe, but added 1 small hot pepper diced into 1/8 inch squ peices to add some spice to it.  Every 2nd or 3rd bite had a small surprize in it.  We loved it.  The second time, we also added ham to make a meal out of it.  That was also very good. Thanks!

I grated the zucchini and lightly salted it and put it in a colander to drain, I got quite a bit of liquid out of it.I also squeezed the zucchini before adding it to the recipe. I also added   half pepper jack cheese and half cheddar and put all the cheese in the mix instead of using half for the top. Wonderful!!! I will make this again as it was a big hit with my family.

Great recipe!  We really enjoyed it.  I halved the recipe and strained the zucchini a little.  As a personal preference I used a shallot instead of an onion and added minced garlic and a chopped red bell pepper (I find an excuse to use them as much as possible because we love them!)  I also added a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes since my husband likes things spicy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night and it was a hit with my husband who is a very picky eater. I used half Pepper Jack and half cheddar cheese in the mix and on top.  I loved the added "kick" of the Pepper Jack.

This is EXCELLENT.  I have also tried it with adding a can of corn and it's good that way too.  I make it frequently and it's equally good hot or cold.  Sort of like a quiche.

I won't make this again.  I made a mistake and mixed in all the cheese instead of reserving 1/2 for a topping.  Maybe it would have improved the dish? As it was prepared, it was not impressive, but edible.  I ended up throwing half away as nobody was interested in the left overs.

This was excellent!! I had some left over frozen spinach that I squeezed dry and added.  My husband and I ate half the casserole.

One whole white onion was way, way too much for this.  It was basically like onion casserole.  It would help if the recipe specified an amount because onion size can vary so much (I would say no more than 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion).  I loved the texture though, and an hour cooking time seemed perfect.  I added the cheese on top for the last 20 minutes of baking.  I would try making this again but with less onion.

Just got done making this casserole. I made it exactly EXCEPT I HAD to add garlic! It isn't what I expected so that is the reason for the 4 stars other wise would have given it a 5 stars.  Other reviewers were not as happy with the gooeyness (is that a real word?) but I really liked the crusty top and gooey inside--truely more casserole than spoon bread like I thought it would be.  Very good flavor despite the simplicity--would be excellent with a dollop of sour cream and sliced tomatoe! I imagine it would freeze quite well to enjoy that zucchini during the cold, harsh winter...will have to let you know! :-)

This was pretty good, if I was to make this again, I would add more cheese, and bake in a dish that was not as deep, turned out to gooey, cooked as specified.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe!  I didn’t drain the zucchini as others suggested, but I did remove the seeds and pulp before grating.  Next time I’ll bake it only 45-50 minutes.

I love most anything zucchini, and this did not disappoint me. I should have read the reviews first and put the cheese topping on during the last 20 minutes of backing, and used less onion. The whole white onion I used put me off a bit from the tastiness of the cornbread and the zucchini. I do plan to make this again one day.

Delicious side dish. When I made it it stayed semi-soft like a spoon bread.  I assume this is the way it is supposed to be becuse if I had cooked it much longer it would have been burned.  I, personally do not object to the "not quite done texture".  It will be among the frequently used recipies of the summer and maybe even the winter using frozen zucchini.

This was really good!  I did as some others had done and after shredding the zucchini I added about 1/4t salt and let it sit over a colander for about an hour, stirring it every 15 mins or so.  I got a good 1/4 of water off of it.  Didn't add anymore salt to the recipe and added all of the cheese inside rather than some on top.  It was done in about 45 mins - probably less than the 60 stated because I had gotten rid of the zucchini moisture.  It came out great - would definitely make again.

This recipe is great! If you use a sugar-free corn bread, you could use this recipe exactly as written. I knew up front that my corn bread mix was VERY sweet, so I made a few tiny adjustments. I took the advice of others and salted my shredded zucchini and let it sit in the strainer for about 15 minutes; just as long as it took for me to get everything else ready. The salt was more than what is called for, and honestly it could stand a little more. I squeezed the excess moisture out before adding the other ingredients. I used three medium zucchini, one medium red onion, shredded Colby/cheddar cheese blend, and to offset the sweetness I decided to roast one jalapeño over my gas burner and dice it up into the batter, and I added a few shakes of dried red pepper flakes. The heat was a perfect foil for the sweetness of the cornbread. It was a big hit, the kids and hubby loved it. I will definitely make this again!

Love it!  Definitely you need to squeeze the water from the zucchini as much you can. I  add roster poblanos peppers to give a little spice flavor. I also reduce the amount of onion- to strong for the recipe .

I didn't have any cornbread mix so I did as others and used cornmeal and added some sugar and salt.
BLAND is the only words I can use and I'm pretty easy to please. I LOVE all the ingredients separate but together, NO.

Sooo good!! Made this to go with BBQ baby back ribs and it was a hit.  We love spicy so I added grilled corn off the cob, a Serrano Chile with all seeds for good heat, green bell peppers, red onion, green onion and minced garlic clove.  I added all 8oz of sharp cheddar in casserole and topped casserole with 4oz of Colby jack.  AMAZING!!   I did take recommendation from others and lightly salted zucchini to help remove water.  This worked great! My hubby thinks this would be great casserole for thanksgiving side!!

Initially, the only thing different that I did was use an 11.5 ounce cornbread mix because the 8.5 ounce mix had animal fat in it. (Really? Companies still use lard?) So I ended up adding 3/4 cup milk to the final mixture because it was so dry. Also, I added all the cheese to the mixture & didn't put any on top. I baked it in a tall 9" pan. It turned out wonderful!

I loved this but my spouse did not. I followed the recipe exactly but with 2 small changes. Used 1 medium zucchini shredded and 1 medium yellow squash peeled and shredded because it is what I had, and I put about 4 Oz cheddar in the mix. Did not put cheese on top. Personal preference. I did salt the squash, rinsed, add squeezed out as much water as I could. Texture was great. Enjoyed the mild sweetness. Will make again for a wider audience who I know will love it.

We loved it.  I did not drain the squash and the texture was perfect.  It was moist and fluffy.   Next time I will use half zucchini and half yellow squash, and not put the cheese on top.  The cheese tastes better mixed in.

Great way to use up a lot of zucchini at one time.  Delicious aroma when cooking, and tastes sensational right out of the oven, as well as  sensational when reheated, and sliced with melted butter in the middle.   BTW - it also freezes very well!

Great recipe for using a bumper crop of zucchini! Like many others, I squeezed the zucchini before adding it to the batter. I also added a can of corn and a can of diced green chilies and doubled the cheese. I will totally make this recipe again!

I added a few twists. I used organic cornmeal instead of cornbread mix. I added shredded scallions and Bermuda onion and garlic powder. It was awesome. Next time I’m trying it with cheddar.

This was super yummy! We had no problems with it being gooey as I did squeeze out the zucchini before adding it. It was a big hit with everyone.

I don’t like sweet cornbread so I used a southwest cornbread mix which had a little herb and chili kick in it. The end result was a savory, delicious side dish which was just as good reheated the next day as it was right out of the oven.

As a casserole it was just ok but way too wet. I was expecting a bread consistency so was very disappointed. If I made it again I would salt, drain and squeeze out the zucchini as dry as possible.

Only change was a bit more than the 2 cups zucchini. Took a lot longer to bake than recipe stated. Wife hated it but she doesn't like cornbread either. Rating is based on me alone though. I won't make it again.

I've made this twice (the second time I also added 1 cup of fresh blueberries with the zucchini, because we have such a surplus of both this time of year), and the recipe  turned out beautifully  both times. I did reduce the sugar to 2 cups and it was definitely still sweet enough. I especially love the thin crisp of crust on the top, similar to the thin crust on the top of a good pound cake. I got major compliments on this recipe. Highly recommend.

I probably won't make this again.  The overwhelming number of people stressed the importance of letting the zucchini drain for awhile in a colander.  Our result was very dry and had little flavor.  It was a bust with my gang.

Made this following the recipe exactly.  It was easy and delicious! Mine was ready after 50 minutes. I had two people ask me for the recipe at the pot luck. the second time I made it, I peeled the zucchini to trick the kids??. They ate it as corn bread casserole. Thank you for this recipe. It will be on our table often.

A++/ Simple and wonderful! I Added a splash of milk to the batter & only one egg [not two], and added 1/4 cup drained canned corn, 1/4 cup red pepper diced fine, and due to high altitude, 1/4 cup flour. Cooked it in preheated oiled cast iron pan and it was wonderful.   I did not top the bread with more cheese. Will definitely make this again.

I find the recipe is rather sweet due to the muffing mix so use a bit less mix and some plain cornmeal in it's place.

It's an okay recipe.  I did add corn and doubled the recipe. Not something I would eat often but to use up some garden zucchini it was a nice change of pace. Also drained the zucchini as there was a lot of liquid in them.  I used Marie Callender's organic cornbread which is really sweet. So to me the sweetness was a bit overwhelming and adding in the corn probably didn't help to tame that.

This is DELICIOUS!  Please note, if you are expecting the consistency of cornbread or corn muffins, this is NOT the recipe for you.  This is a CASSEROLE and the consistency is more like prepared stuffing.  I followed the recipe only substituting Mexican shredded cheese for the plain Cheddar Cheese.  No need to salt the zucchini and let it set;  I measured out the amount I needed, tossed it into a strainer and slightly pushed down on it a bit.  That's it!  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 13x9 glass baking dish and cooked it for the full hour.  I inserted a knife into the middle and it came out clean.  Done!  It's SO yummy and I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you!

We happened to have some leftover marinated (cooked) steak and corn on the cob, so I layered shredded steak on the bottom of the pan, stirred the corn that I cut off the cob in with the batter, and also used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  It was amazing!  I followed the tip to salt the zucchini and let it drain, squeezed it out before I added so it wasn't too wet.

Very easy to make.  Used a spicey cheddar and a 15oz box of krusteaz corn bread mix.  Also added added a 1/3 cup of milk.   Salt the zucchini and  let  sit in a colander for at least 30 min , then rinse and squeeze out excess water (someone posted this suggestion and it worked well).

This recipe is AMAZING!! It's probably my favorite that I've tried from AllRecipes thus far. My husband and I gobbled up every bit of it and my 10 month old daughter loved it as well! I agree that the zucchini should be drained as it helped to keep the moisture down. I added 2 tsp of minced garlic to our version and sautéed the onions with some sweet peppers before adding them to the mix. I baked it in a 9x9" pan and accidentally over baked it, which gave it a nice crusty top. Delicious!

Very good!  I left out the onion and substituted 4 chopped green onions.   Trust me, I've made similar recipes like this one and the green onion takes it over the top.  I also added 1 seeded and diced jalepeno pepper.  I left off the cheese topping because in my experience it just comes out hard.  Only used 3 cups of zucchini because I was running out of room in my bowl.  Mixture was very dry and I resisted the temptation to add a little milk.  I knew the moisture from the zucchini would be enough.  I never salt and/or squeeze out the moisture from the zucchini in any recipe and it always works out perfectly.  I tossed everything in a bowl and mixed it up dry and then stirred in the beaten eggs in order to mix as little as possible and prevent it from coming out tough.  Good recipe; will make again.  Mine was done in 55 minutes.  I think maybe next time I will add 1/4 c. milk or buttermilk. Mine came out a little dry and tough because of the dryness of the batter and the difficulty mixing.  Still good though.

I have made this casserole several times and loved it each and every time.....and so did my guests.  The Jiffy mix made the whole casserole.  Love anything with cornbread mix in it.

I have made this twice for our Bible Study Group and we ALL LOVE IT!  I doubled the recipe because I had a bigger box of cornbread.  Easy and SO GOOD!

We love this recipe and have it all winter. Easy prep and yummy! I do wait until the last 15 minutes of baking to put the cheese over the top. Just to make sure the casserole is done in the middle.

I made no changes when I made this except for maybe using less onion, not sure had a large sweet onion and cut it in half. Anyway this recipe is delicious! When I first saw the recipe I definitely didn't think this would be as tasty as it is but it's great! Def will make again! Oh but this recipe turns out a pretty dense product just know that it's not the texture of regular cornbread but it's delicious and I actually eat a slice for a light lunch with a salad. Delicious!

Very good!! I followed the directions the first time, and the second time I made it, I put in a cup of cooked corn. (I blotted the moisture out of the corn also) 
I froze a small  piece to see how it would do, and it seemed to have frozen nicely also.
Nice to put in the freezer for the winter..

Liked it very much but it is a little dry - take the advice of others - don't use a corn bread mix with sugar!   Next time - and I will make it again - I will add more zucchini/squash and more cheese on top...My husband loved it, which is the only radar I need.  Make this for any occasion but be careful and don't let it get dry.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I used pepper jack cheese, since it's my favorite. The flavor of the onions and zucchini were lost in the amount of cornbread, which as a casserole, was much too dry. The texture of the dry cornbread with the crunch of the bland onion was what made me toss the casserole out. 

I drained the zucchini for only 30 minutes before mixing it with the other ingredients. With that and the cheese, I wonder why it was so dry and flavorless. If I were to make it again I would cook the onion and zucchini first in olive oil with the salt and pepper, and the olive oil may have given it the moisture it needed.

Ok, I made this almost exactly per the recipe, except I used just a pinch of savory herbs and usd summer squash as the zucchini was not available. I forgot to salt the squash as others suggested, but it turned out just great. - not too wet. I wonder if the pan makes a difference? I used a glass casserole dish.  Is the yellow squash drier than the zucchini? I used the Jiffy corn muffin mix, and am sure it would taste quite different without the added sugar, and am going to use a different mix next time I make this.



2nd time making it: The addition of basil, sage, thyme and garlic powder made it savory. Still haven't  found a sugar-free cornbread mix. Used Martha White, but it's even sweeter than the Jiffy. It's   also ground more, like flour and not cornmeal, so I'm  a little disappointed. I think the key to not having a mushy casserole is, don't  shred the squash. I've  been dicing it and it's   not as watery as shredding.

I doubled this recipe because of our large Thanksgiving crowd. It's very flavorful but I had put it in a deep pan without adjusting the time. It was watery unfortunately. Next time I'll use a shallow pan and make sure it is set in the center.

I love this stuff! I make it just about every week during zucchini season-- and never get tired of it. It does really help if you salt the zucchini and let it drain for a while. Otherwise the dish can turn out too moist. Also, I like sharp cheddar for this. I bake mine in a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes, then cover it with foil (so the cheese on top doesn't get over done) and bake for another 10 minutes. Perfect. Every time.

Followed directions exactly as written (except I cooked for 35 mins at 400 F) and it turned out well. I think if you strain the zucs as recommended by other reviewers, you'll end up with more of a cornbread, rather than the current pudding consistency.  Next time I may add some more seasonings...

Made it for the first time, and for a little kick, I sprinkled a little chili powder on top before adding the top layer of cheese.  It turned out fantastic, and it was gone in about 10 minutes!

We make this recipe once a week when our zucchini comes on strong in the garden.  I have followed the ingredients exactly, but also find that it is very forgiving and can easily be modified.  Once when I ran out of dry corn muffin mix, I replaced that ingredient with this combination (2/3 c. flour, 1/2 c. cornmeal, 3 T. sugar, 1 T. baking powder, 1/4 t. salt, and 2 T. oil).  It always comes out great no matter what we do to it!   Wonderful way to use up lots of zucchini.

I love this recipe! It was easy to make and I originally made it as a main dish for supper but have been eating the leftovers for breakfast. I am not a huge onion fan and only used 1/3 of an onion. I also added 2 cups of sweet corn and 1 egg white in addition to the 2 eggs. I whipped the eggs and then stired the cornbread mix into the eggs before adding to the vegetables. Overall this was a great dish that I will definitely be making again. Depending on your preference I think that some chopped bacon would also be a great addition to this dish!

a real winner!!. Salt the zucchini as someone suggested about an hour. Absorb as much moisture as possible in a towel. This also removes the excess salt.

LOVE THIS. I especially like it reheated for breakfast as a side to eggs, just warm in the microwave and top with a pat of butter. Pairs well with tomatoes.

Definite keeper.  I used my new "As Seen on TV" Veggie "spaghetti" tool instead of shredding my squash.  We had for dinner Sunday and I have it for lunch Monday & Tuesday.  Next time I will experiment by adding other veggies or some sausage.  
I would also put more of the the cheese into it vs. on top. 
Prepared in 9x9 pan and cooked for the exact time.  I may take it out 5 minutes earlier next time.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated. The first thing my husband said was "there's too much onion". Same thing I was thinking, and I used a very small onion. The onion flavor is overwhelming and not in a good way. It also stayed firm and strong after cooking. Will not make again.

I made this recipe for dinner last night but I made a lot of changes! I used a mix of green and yellow zucchini and added sausage, canned corn, a red pepper, green onion in place of the regular onion, sour cream, garlic powder, and I crumbled bacon on top. It was great! And it was a great way to hide a ton of veggies from my husband who hates to eat them! Husband and our company loved it. Will make again.

Main Dish hit!  My kids aren't fans of zucchini but this was a hit!  I accidentally mixed in all of the cheese so didn't put any on top.  I shredded the zucchini lengthwise so had long shreds.  I divided the mixture into two brie bakers instead of a 2-qt. baker and baked them for 40-45 minutes.  It was a bit difficult mixing with the longer shreds but it turned out GREAT!  without the cheese it was lightly browned on the top and we all enjoyed it as our main entree.  Kids have asked for this to be on the regular list.  NOTE:  I did not add any salt or pepper to the mix and it was perfect for us.

Salted and drained the zucchini.  Used jalapeno and habanero pepperjack cheese.  Mixed in most of the cheese, sprinkled what was left about 10 before it finished cooking.  The cornbread mix had sugar in it, so this was sweet and spicy.  I'd prefer less sweet, but it's still awesome.

This was very moist and seemed more like cake than  cornbread. I added 1/2 frozen corn (thawed). It tasted good, but I really wanted cornbread.

The only thing I did differently, was I didn't add salt. I really liked this and I believe it would have been better had I not put it in the "wrong" dish. I did as others said and that was to salt the grated zucchini and put in a colander. There was a lot of liquid when I squeezed it out. The directions said to put it in a 2 qt. baking dish and bake for an hour, which I did except I used an oblong dish, not round, and that made it too dry. I had it timed for 50 min. to coincide with another dish and I think it would have been done in 30. Next time, I will use a round dish

I tried a similar recipe but did not use but 3 cups of zucchini instead of 4 and it was moist but not like spoonbread.  I am going to try letting getting out the liquid from the zucchini.  I also did not use as much cheddar cheese but the recipe I saw said to use low-fat sharp cheddar.  There was a review from a gentleman who was surprised by the commercial cornbread mix--good for him that he has only used cornmeal--I've seen the other cornmeal for over 40 years and it is sweet.  Also, the recipe I had said to bake it for one hour.  I can't imagine that length of time unless you put the mix in an 8 or 9 inch baking pan. This is really a good side dish.

I made this with ingredients as written except with yellow squash- as far as pocess I benefited from many of your suggestions ie I salted and allowed it to drain and incorporated 2/3 of cheese into mix and reserved last bit for the last 30 min of baking. I liked this much more than anticipated- (BF swears he hates squash and ate two helpings)but next time I will make some changes 1) saute onions prior to adding to squash 2)make in rectangle baking dish or muffin tin as some of the best bits were the crunchy areas around the edge. and 3) experiment with some additions like red pepper as it needs a bit of color. Thanks for the unique dish and all the suggestions!

Followed the recipe exactly as I do the first time with the exception that I did salt and drain the zucchini.  It turned out terrific.  It could be the main focus of a meatless meal.  Or it could be changed up by adding things like bacon, green chilis or sausage. Definitely a keeper

I followed recipe except I only used 5 ounces of cheese, all in the mixture. I squeezed out the zucchini after shredding. This came out lovely. I cut into 16 squares as I was serving at a BBQ. Easy Peasy and reheated well too.

I made this to the recipe and cant believe how good it came out.  I used Mexican blend shredded cheese.  This is could be awesome with Chili as suggested by a coworker who tasted it.  The kids didn't even realize that there was zucchini in it.

I was terrified I'd be serving a bunch of people green slime after reading reviews- I  had already put my dish in the oven.  But it turned out excellent, maybe you need to let it rest a bit longer?  Mine sat for a good 45 minutes through a car ride.  I also added one small red pepper and 1/4th minced jalapeno for freshness, color and heat.  So good no one wanted to be responsible for taking the last piece- there was a 2-inch triangle left at the end.

Good, but I added 1/2 egg to the already two and to me the casserole came out a little dry.  Next time I will stick with the two eggs. I also added 4 dashes of red pepper, 1/4 a red bell pepper and I squeezed as much water as possible out of the zucchini. In the future, I won't squeeze out as much water.  I also added one chopped jalapeno pepper, 1/2 cup of sour cream and cooked bacon. If I make again, I think I will try sausage and I might leave out the cheese and only place on the top. 4 stars because of all the additions.

Wonderful flavor!  Very good, the only issue I ran into on Thanksgiving with the recipe is with people who are weird about textures of their food.  It has a little mushy texture.  But if your not weird about the texture, it is great!

Very yummy, tastes just like corn casserole with zucchini. I doubled it and thought it looked like way too much zucchini for the cornbread batter. However, when it cooked the zucchini shrank and the cornbread expanded, turning out perfect. I did cook it for an extra 30 min or so. I took other's advice and added the cheese on top at the end. I used one onion and one leek, plus added a diced red pepper. I also cut the zucchini into small pieces instead of shredding it. For the cheese I used half extra sharp cheddar and half smoked fontina.

I was excited about this idea, but no! I baked it for over an hour and it never turned into a bread. More like spoon bread or something mushy. Might have worked with two boxes of corn bread...I'll keep looking. Good idea though!

A good use for excess zucchini. I really only tasted the onion and cornbread. My mom said it tasted like a Spoon Bread.  I rated 4 stars because it didn't need 60 minutes cook time. It was done in 30 minutes.

I made this for my family for 4th of July and it was a hit. I used three small zucchini.  Any more and you might have a soggy casserole.  I added extra cheese, and used an 11 x 7 inch casserole dish.  It was puffy and nicely browned.

this was a great way to use up my garden zucchini!  thanks!  only change i made was to use 1/2 c cornmeal, 1/2c AP flower, and 1 t. baking powder rather than the corn muffin mix (didn't have that on hand).  however - it came out pretty flat.  next time i would use self rising flour!

We all loved this recipe! I shredded one zucchini and one squash, left out the onion and added the whole 8 oz. of sharp cheddar cheese to the mixture. Baked it in an 11x7 baking dish for 40 minutes. It was delicious!

I had to remove the skin on my zucchini this time and it was way too mushy, but last time I made it with skins it was delicious. Just be careful not to overcook it. I also served with a little cheese melted on top.

Good, simple recipe.  Nice way to use up too much zucchini.  I have a very similar recipe that utilizes corn with the corn muffin mix.  Mixed all of the cheese in with the other ingredients and baked in a 9x13 greased pan.  Worked out well to slice squares and serve at a bbq with friends.

Incredibly delicious!  When it mixes up it doesn't look like the cornbread will hold the zucchini together.  It does and this dish is wonderful!!  Simple to prepare if you have a food processor.

I am trying to serve one meal a week that is vegitarian and this was my choice for last week.  I should have realized that it is more of a side/bread dish.  I followed the comments and dried out the zuchinni, it almost was too dry.  The dish was good but not as a main corse.  I am going to try it on the side with some soup next time.

I believe the casserole came out as it was supposed to. Followed the recipe, except I cooked it covered it for 30 minutes and uncovered 30 minutes. Texture was fine, but the taste was very bland. I don't think I'll make it again, although my 6 year old chef daughter loved it.

This was really good.  I did not use corn muffin mix - made my own - other than that I made as written.  Only baked for about 40 minutes.  Which was plenty.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

surprised at all the rave reviews. This was edible but nothing i would make again. Didnt like the texture at all. perhaps it would have been better if i squeezed some of the liquid out of the zucchini but because it didnt call for any liquid in the batter, i didnt . I found the casserole to be a lil to wet and a lil on the bland side.wont be making again.

Definitely a keeper! Mine turned out looking just like the picture. I did lightly salt the zucchini and placed in a colander for an hour, then squeezed the water out. Next time I'll skip that step, since it was a bit dry, but that's my fault for not following directions :). It was ready in 50 minutes. I'll try covering for 30 minutes and bake uncovered for another 30 minutes like other reviewers. Thanks for sharing!!

Fabulous way to use extra zucchini, and that cornbread mix in your cupboard.  Great flavor, too.  Not too heavy. Excellent side dish!  I've made this several times already and it's made it into my "fave allrecipes.com recipes" collection.  =)

This is so yummy & light.  Like a fluffy stuffing. Because I didn't have cornbread mix on hand, I used my cornbread recipe  without the liquid (Just added a large serving spoon of plain yogurt for moistness) I also dried out the zuchini before mixing. We will have this often.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This was delicious and a great way to use zucchini.  I would have liked even more zucchini, and think it was a little gooey - might bake it longer next time.  Kids liked it too.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was fabulous. Be sure not to sqeeze the moisture out of the zucchini. Those who complained of dryness may have done that. I might try pepper jack cheese next time.

This was quite good although I would say using the Jiffy cornbread mix it was a little sweet which made it a bit of an odd mix of flavors.  It was a good way to use zucchini so that the kids would eat it!  I might try a diff. bread mix next time and like other reviews add some seasoning.

Mine was too dry, though I did add more zucchini. I added all the cheese with none on top. Maybe I cooked it too long--exactly 55 min. I think I would like to add herbs, such as thyme, savory, whatever.  Priscilla

This was tasty, but it seemed kind of wet/mushy. I did squeeze the zucchini before adding it, but maybe not quite enough. It probably could have done with another 15 minutes of cooking. I recommend covering with foil for at least half the cooking time, and adding the cheese topping during the last 15 minutes. I would also use a little less onion (like maybe 1/2 an onion). I added a red bell pepper, which added some nice color and flavor.

Made this for a BBQ at a friends and it was a very big hit...everyone loved it!!  I made it just as the recipe said and it was great.  I did however cover it with foil for the first 30 mins and then uncovered for the last 30.  Soooo easy and tasy!!  I am at my MIL for the weekend and am planning on making it for the family tomorrow!!

I just thought this recipe was OK. It is a great way to use up extra zucchini. I didn't like how the cheese browned on the top. It was borderline burnt. I did take it to work and everyone ate it up, however, my husband had a very similar opinion to mine in thinking this dish was just OK. I think I will stick with good ole plain cornbread.

Looking for ways to use up zucchini from the garden, so tried this based on earlier reviews. Definitely squeeze the water from the zucchini, messy but worth the extra step, gave the casserole a nice firm texture. Used Jiffy corn bread mix, as that's what I had on hand, and added a couple of teaspoons of seasoned salt. Put 3/4 of the cheese in the mix and added the last 1/4 to the top only during the last 10 minutes. My husband and kids LOVED it, and it made a nice big amount to last two meals. I found it a bit sweet and will try it with a  non-sugar corn bread mix next time, maybe even add some fresh dill.

This is now my husbands favorite zucchini recipe! I also salted and drained the zucchini in a colander before mixing it with the other ingredients.  With zucchini season in full swing at our house, we will definitely be making this one again!

Delicious just the way it was in the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was used 4 oz of Mexican shredded cheese and 4 oz of regular cause that was all I had.  That might ahve taken some of the sweetness out of the cornbread.  The smell of this cooking is unbelievable.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. I grated 3 zucchinis and it was a little more than called for but I used it all. I tried to "drain" the excess water out but there was none. I followed the recipe as writtn and didn't have any problems with it being gooey, it came out perfectly as written! Next time, I may add cooked sausage or bacon and see how it turns out.  Thanks for a new twist on zucchini casserole!

I thought this dish was bland and a bit mushy (even after squeezing excess water from the zucchini). The texture was better the next day, as was the taste with extra seasonings and cheese.

3 1/2 stars actually. It is good not great. I followed the recipe exactly. The first helping was pretty good, but then it gets to be a bit much. Do only have this as a side dish. I am a vegetarian so I made it as a meal and it lost it pizzazz after the fifth bite. So I say if you are looking for a different side dish go for it. I also don't see any need for alteration. (BTW- I used 4cups of shredded frozen zucchini that I had from the fall harvest. I worked out perfect.)

I made this with a few alterations: I substituted the cheddar for part-skim mozzarella and I used a smaller cornbread mix. I cooked it for 45 minutes instead of one hour and it came out PERFECT. I will be making this again for sure. Got my husband to eat vegetables!

Great recipe! I decided to dice rather than shred the zucchini/yellow squash mix, and mixed mexican blend of cheese in completely with batter, but otherwise left this easy side the same.  Also used a zesty no-salt mix to cut back on salt, and will add more spice next time to bring out flavors... Great late summer, early fall treat!!  Thanks...!!

This is my husband's rating, as I don't really like cornbread. The only changes I made was to use egg substitute, add 1/2 jar roasted red peppers, and added extra cheddar at the end because the cheese on top got very brown and I wanted a more melted cheese texture on top.  I also squeezed the moisture out of the shredded zucchini, which might have made the casserole a little dry, so I would still do that next time but would add an extra egg to compensate and make it a little eggier.

Mine came out good, but I followed the suggestions made by the raters - drain water off zucchini, add basil and garlic, cover 45 minutes, mix all cheese in, 1/2 onion.

This recipe was very good.  I used three cups of zucchini and one cup of mushrooms, 1 1/2 cups of fat free cornbread mix, 1/2 cup egg substitute and 1/2 cup reduced fat cheddar cheese (I'm very weight conscious).  The only thing is I would only bake it for 50 minutes, adding the cheese on the last 5 minutes.  Will definitely make it again!

Really good, my husband raved about it. I added 1/2 orange pepper.  I also used 1 whole egg + one egg white, instead of the 2. My 3 yr old loved squeezing the water out of the zucchini. I would leave out the cheese that goes on top next time.

Great recipe. I followed some of the suggestions of other users such as browning the onions/garlic to soften them up, and added a bit more cheese and added one shredded carrot for color. The casserole was initially runny when I took it out of the oven after 60 minutes, however, once it cooled off it firmed up very nicely and turned out delicious!

I made this dish a few months back for a buffet style military luncheon (we sure love to eat!) and the casserole dish was empty before I made my way through the line! Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was a lot more rich than i expected.  I followed some reviewers' suggestions and let the zucchini sit w/ a little salt for about an hour and then squeezed the extra water out.  I also decided to add shredded carrot in place of half the zucchini - this turned out GREAT!  I used sharp cheddar and the flavor complemented the cornbread nicely.

This was too bland for my taste.  Perhaps my measurments were off, or I didn't use a decent corn muffin mix... (i used the jiffy, yuk)  I just think the recipe needs more flavor.

I tried this recipe based on my daughter's recommendation, but I was skeptical about its appeal.  It was wonderful!  I made it twice last week--once for a big dinner party and the response was unanimous--even my picky, 26-year-old son thought it was yummy.

I thought this was yummy.  I love onions but I thin he next time I make this I won't be adding them.  Somehow they clash with the texture and sweetness of the bread.

Boring. I added a can of corn, and there was nothing really to this at all. I dried the zucchini after I shredded them, and used Monty Jack on top and mixed in. Did not have much flavor at all.

I chose this recipe for our cooking club and everyone loved it.  I've made it twice since then - once for my family and once for a neighbor.  It goes with anything and a great recipe to use in "zucchini" season or with frozen, shredded zucchini later on.

Very good side dish and great way to use up all those summer zucchini. My family really liked this recipe.  I did not use as much cheese as called for but probably should have. I will try it again with the stated amount of cheese. Definately a recipe worth hanging on to.

My kids loved this but my husband and I didn't care for it.  It was very bland.  You have to definitely add some spicier cheeses, spices, or hot sauce to the mix.  I gave it 5 stars because my 2 and 5 year old ate most of it.

This turned out to be a soupy mess for me.  Make sure you bake it long enough!  It was crispy on top but once I cut into it it was not fully cooked!  I also added chicken to it to make an entire meal.

This recipe made a good starting point, but this is definitely too plain on its own.  I ended up using the leftover casserole as an addition to a homemade tomato soup.  I cut it into chunks and threw it in right before serving. A good way to add texture, heartiness, and veggies!

I really did like this recipe. We're always looking for ways to use zucchini. I also used yellow squash (kids don't notice it as much). I could only give it 4 stars though. I'm from the south and not used to such sweet cornbread. I will make it again but will probably just make my own cornbread mix.

This was wonderful!  I added the cheese on top during the last 20 minutes of baking so it wouldn't get too brown.  Made this for a family dinner and they all loved it!  This recipe is a keeper.

This dish was a nice use of summer fresh zucchini.  Though we thought that the boxed cornbread mix was a bit too sweet, it was still an overall good recipe.  Next time I might try to add ingredients for a homemade (non-sweet) cornbread base.
