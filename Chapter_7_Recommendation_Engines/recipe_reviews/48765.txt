We do NOT make them like this in New Orleans!  This was horrible!  We use Italian bread crumbs, olive oil and grated parm.  THAT'S IT!  Avoid this recipe!

I love this recipe - I use this though for four not ten artichokes and I really didn't change anything except for the anchovies I used one 2.oz can with  capers and I take the choke out after boiling but before stuffing. I am very generous in stuffing, I make sure and stuff every leaf. very delicious

I can tell you before making this recipe that there is no way the stuffing can stuff 10 artichokes. I am a NOLA native and maker of stuffed artichokes from way back, and the proportions for this recipes are off. I cannot comment on the flavor of this recipe as I use a much simpler recipe, but I just wanted to warn folks who might want to try this recipe, you should plan on stuffing about two artichokes with this amount of stuffing.

Really good!!! This recipe really surprised me; the flavors all come together very nicely and make for a very tasty dish! I did skip the anchovies. After reading through the ingredient amounts and the previous reviews, I figured that the amount of stuffing was going to be a little off. I used 2 artichokes, but only cut the stuffing down by 1/3 and had just enough. If you're going to make the whole ten artichokes, you should probably at least triple everything else. Really, really tasty and different. Thanks!! :)

Very similar to my sicilian grandmother's recipe, which omits olives, onion and bell peppers. I would like to encourage everyone to INCLUDE the anchovy in the bread crumb mixture. Use your own proportions because a little goes a long way, but the anchovy adds a depth of flavor that makes this recipe great.  If you, or your guests can taste "anchovy", you used too much! The little filets really do dissolve easily in the mix, but if that disturbs you you can always buy a tube of anchovy paste.
