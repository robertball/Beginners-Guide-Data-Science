Really good twist on a classic dish. I ran out of grapes and improvised with plums, worked just as good.

I adore guacamole so I've tried it with mangoes in the past.  But I never thought of adding peaches, plums, or pomegranate.  This is one of my new favorites!

Loved the grapes! They added a lot to the normal guacamole.

Delicious! I used mango in place of the peaches and added a bit more onion than called for (didn't measure). The combo of the creamy, spicy, salty and sweet is one that I love! I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I added crumbled mild goat cheese and used more grapes. It is a keeper!
