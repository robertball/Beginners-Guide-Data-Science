They were delicious!  This is now my go-to cheese blintz recipe.  My first crepe fell apart because I added too much melted butter to the pan and I didn't let it cook long enough.  After I fixed my mistakes the crepes came out great.  There are several tricks to keep the crepes in one piece. I used a long fish spatula to turn the crepes over.  It gives the crepes more support. I used a 10 inch non-stick fry pan but a crepe pan is better to use.  I used a small amount of melted butter in the pan for each crepe.  I let my crepes cook on the first side long enough that parts of the cooking side of the crepe was browned.  I loosened all the edges of the crepe with the spatula, gently shook the pan to loosen the crepe, then I put my spatula under the edge of the crepe and gently shook the pan a little so I could move my fish spatula under the crepe and gently flip it over to cook the other side of it and when it was done I used my fish spatula to help ease it off the fry pan and onto the plate.

Also I meant to say--a crepe pan is a must or the blintz sticks and falls apart. Thankfully we have one and it worked great.

Left each side longer than recommended and then it wasnâ€™t to hard to flip using a copper pan. Tasted great.

I did not like this recipe. whenever I flipped the blintz, It got destroyed. I only got 1 or 2 correct ones. But for those who don't care about looks, it was scrumptious!
