I made this dish for the grey cup and the men loved this dip. I used a little bit of canned jalapeño and bannana pepper and one fresh jalapeño. This dish was the first one gone.

Easy to throw together and delicious!  I have been looking for this recipe as our local butcher sells something just like this.  I have made it as written and I have made it with slight variations.  I make it with finely grated cheddar (mixes in better) liquid uber hot sauce and put in Christopholofigus infamous jalapeño relish (recipe on this site).   My kids like it with celery sticks!    Thanks again for posting this!   YUM!

A new Superbowl favorite! Addicting and delicious! My audience recommends adding bacon, but it is delicious with or without this addition.

I made the recipe as directed but it did need to seem like it needed more so I added sour cream and cream cheese.  I did add more smoke flavoring and cayenne. I didn't use as much mayo since I added sour cream and cream cheese.  I added green chilies and it just made it. My husband and I loved it!!!!!!!

Sorry,  I followed the recipe exactly but this did not taste good. It seemed to need something else like sour cream or cream cheese in it.

This recipe was very simple and quick to make, however, I felt like it was missing something so I added salad shrimp. My family loved it!!!
