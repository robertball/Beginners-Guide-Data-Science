A soft, moist cookie! The texture is the same as a "whoopie pie" style cookie- they do not spread while baking.  We toasted our walnuts on the stovetop with butter and salt before chopping, and added raisins to the batter.  The kids also shook in some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Each cookie is like a mini carrot cake!

I used butter instead of shortening--it was what I had on hand and added 1/2 tsp of orange extract to the glaze frosting.  These turned out pretty good.  Took them to work--they did not last long!

My grandmother made these all the time at Christmas too!  They are definitely cake-like cookies, and I firmly believe the recipe is not to be messed with :)  I have never heard of putting nuts in them, and prefer them without, but the rest of the measurements/ingredients in this recipe is identical to her recipe.

I thought the recipe was missing a bit in the flavor dept, and I'm so glad I followed my instinct, because the flavor is light enough as I made them...without the changes I think they'd be quite bland. I added orange zest and juice to the batter, plus about 4.5 tsps of spices: allspice, ginger, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice.  The batter looks very wet, so the cookies are very cake like.  I made cream cheese frosting and added another orange worth of zest plus half an orange's juice to that.

Without the walnuts, these are exactly as I remember the ones my grandmother would send to me in Vietnam.

I steamed my carrots in the microwave and then pureed them in the food processor. As was suggested by others, I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp. ginger to the cookie dough. They are a moist and tasty cookie. i did not have time to zest my orange so my glaze was not very "orangey". May use orange juice concentrate next time. Everyone at work liked these cookies.I thought they were very quick to mix up and bake. Will definitely make these again.

These are FANTASTIC cookies. I don't like nuts so I leave them out but otherwise I make as is. For the pureed carrots I use babyfood . Makes my life easier that way. They are super good without the glaze as well. For the shortening I use spectrum organic palm oil shortening.

I have made these cookies since I was in middle school, and like to make them for Easter, but couldn't find my recipe, so used this one.  They were good.  I used half whole wheat flour and used a  plastic cup of cinnamon applesauce in place of 1/2 cup of the shortening.  (I also had to use butter instead of shortening for another 1/2 cup; that's all I had.)  They were good.  I did have some dried orange zest and I think that added a lot to the icing.  So while I would have thought the whole orange and zest thing could be skipped, I think it adds a lot to the icing.  (I added a touch of zest to the dough also.)  I could not seem to get the icing right.  I added 1 tablespoon oj to 1/2 cup powdered sugar and it was way too thin, so start out with very small amounts of juice.  They had icing dripped down the sides even after I tried to thicken it.  I will make these again, but will look for my old recipe to see if there were any differences that made for an improvement on taste.  They were good, but I don't think everyone loved them at the Easter dinner I attended.  Cheesecake and brownies with ice cream seemed a bit more popular.  GREAT way to add beta carotene to a veggie hater's diet.  I gave them without icing to my 1 year old who has decided she doesn't like carrots anymore, and she loved them.  :)

Okay, I'm a ditz so I added grated raw carrots (I'd been reading a ton of other carrot recipes.) I saw my error so I added one cup of cooked carrots to make up for it. Believe it or not, they still came out very tasty. They were a bit cakey though so I wonder if I should cut down on the baking powder--or are they meant to be cake-like? I told my daughter they were carrot cake cookies! She loves them, especially the glaze but I used orange juice concentrate, melted, and blended it into the sugar for extra flavor. My friends wanted the recipe so it must be good! I prefer cookies with more crisp edges, but these have great flavor. A novel way to use carrots!

My family does not care for nuts, so those were omitted.  The recipe as written had a typo in it:  Had 1 cup of chopped nuts written twice.  I also doubled the amount of glaze and let it more like a frosting, putting it on after the cookies cooled on the pan for 5 minutes, which allowed the "glaze" to melt slightly covering the cookie.
These were absolutely amazing cookies, I made them twice in one week.  Those that I gave cookies to ask for the recipe so they could also enjoy them

Added zest of one orange and juice of half an orange to the batter, along with a tsp of cinnamon and some nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice. Added about a cup of raisin's to batter as per other reviews. Loved it!

We were given a 50lb bag of carrots so my daughters and I have been looking for creative ways to use them! This is a really good recipe! It is light and that makes it addictive! In fact, by the time my family was done taste-testing the cookies from the oven, there weren't very many left to frost! 
The first cookie sheet was left as-is and we decided it needed a little more flavor, so I added some orange essential oil, cinnamon and clove to the dough. For the icing, I didn't have any oranges so I used orange essential oil and orange Gatorade! (Sometimes you just use what you have!) LOL!
This is so good, that while my daughter was icing what cookies were left, I was preparing more carrots for another batch! Definitely a keeper!

I like the taste, but they turn out very cake-like. Something needs to be done about the baking soda/powder mix.
