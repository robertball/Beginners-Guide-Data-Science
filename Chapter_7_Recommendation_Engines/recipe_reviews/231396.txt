But with tweaks...I cooked 3 chicken breasts in the crockpot with one can of chicken broth until done.  Shredded the chicken, and then added the veggies and one package of Jennie-O Turkey Smoked Sausage and another can of chicken broth.  Thickened it up with a bit of heated olive oil and flour to make a roux and one can of tomato paste to give it flavor.  The finishing touch was cajun spice and it was served over rice.  I will definitely make this again.  Healthy (we left out the bacon) and great for leftovers!

I loved the spice in this Cajun Chicken Ragu however, I felt it needed some flavor on the front end, not sure what though.  I just heated up the leftovers for lunch and it was almost better the 2nd time around.  Definitely a keeper for me!

My husband devoured this.  I made it for him as it is really not my thing.  It was definitely tasty for me but he thought it was the cats meow.  He told me that he loved being married to me because there is always something new and exciting.  Can't beat that compliment.  It was begging for some crawfish ...definitely will add that next time and maybe some shrimp!

I do love ChefJohn's recipes. That said I made one change.  I didn't have any cooked chicken so I roasted a couple leg quarters seasoned with some homemade creole seasoning. Once it was cool, I stripped the bones and made a quick chicken stock with them and the skin. I think that gave it a more complex flavor. Ya, it took some extra time, but I think it was worth it!

This was really good but like another reviewer mentioned it seemed that it needed something.  I added a little extra spice, oregano, and about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.  Just seemed as if it needed some acid.  I loved those changes.

Stayed true to recipe, served it over brown rice and loved it.
It did take me longer to make as I'm slow at prep work, but worth the time, will make this often.

Made this for friends who are foodies and they loved it! I enjoyed it, but just not in my wheelhouse. It seemed like it was just a thrown together thing no matter how much I tried to up the ante. I put noodles in it as it was entirely the wrong consistency for rice or grits in my opinion.

Loved it! I used half a store bought rotisserie chicken for the recipe.  I added a teaspoon of cajun seasoning like some suggested, and next time will do the same but omit the cayenne pepper since it was a lot of heat.

Very good.  I recommend serving with hot sauce on the side so people can spice it up to their own taste.

This was an absolute amazing dish! Tonight was the FIRST time I have ever made this dish but you can bet your boots that I will again. Believe me, the stars in the Louisiana sky must be dancing every time this dish is made, the sauce dances in your mouth as you eat, I made it exactly as written, I did top it with Tony C seasoning at the end but oh, heaven! You need to try making this dish.

Based upon other reviews that stated that there was not enough seasoning I subbed smoked paprika for regular. I doubled oregano and garlic and also seasoned with garlic powder and onion powder. Deglazed the pan with red wine.

Well, as with every other Chef John recipe I have made, this one was fun to make and the flavor combo was over the top. My only complaint to the chef, we eat too much.  Thank you sir for another taste experience. Perfecto.

My family is not fond of spicy food, so I left out the cayenne pepper.  The spiciness of the the sausage and black pepper was enough to give it the little bit of heat without being overly spicy which Cajun food is known for.  I did not think this recipe would go over well, but my family really enjoyed it!  Definitely a keeper!

I enjoyed it more than my wife did.  Stuck to the recipe other than using  kielbasa instead of andouille.  Served it on mashed Yukon Gold spuds; may try rice next time.

I followed the script, our little family liked it. My husband and I both agree, something is missing but we can't put our "tongue" on it. I will make it again and do some experimenting but very hearty altogether.

I made this tonight.  It was excellent.  The only changes I made were adding Cajun seasoning at the end with the other spices and using turkey sausage instead of the Andouille sausage.  It is time consuming to make, though, and I even used pre-cooked chicken.  I served it over quinoa, which went well with it.

I cooked this in a slow cooker and then shredded the chicken when done. Like other reviewers, I thought this needed much more flavour. I used a Cajun spice mix to help with the flavour and tomato paste, as others suggested, more oregano, smoked paprika, thyme. In Australia we don't have andouille sausage that I am aware of, so I used a chorizo instead. After the changes, my family did enjoy this. However, even though it tasted nice with my changes, it was a long list of ingredients for only a reasonable flavour.

This dinner was so good, my family all devoured it! I did not use the worcestershire sauce (because I forgot) and not a big fan of green peppers, so I only used a half of an orange pepper.  I could literally eat this every day!!!

my picky family really liked this but I am giving it 4 stars because i found it lacking seasoning and had to make adjustments.  I must add that i didn't have any bacon on hand or celery so possibly these omissions were the reason why . I added two extra tbsp. of worchestchire sauce and doubled all the dry seasonings. I also added a 2 tbsp of tomato paste and this provided a more complex gravy.  I however didnt care for the dark color of the sauce after my added worchestchire sauce  so I added some additional green onion and jarred sweet and spicy cherry peppers  to liven up the plated dish.  After all this, the dish was really good and my family kept complementing it.

I loved this recipe. I made it as is, except I didn't have any bacon so I just omitted it. I can't rave about this enough. This will be a new favorite recipe in my house.

This was fantastic! Didn't have to change a thing. The whole family enjoyed it so much. If you have smaller children I would suggest taking it easy on the spicy seasonings though. Ill be making it again tonight for my church group...

This was such a good meal. I made it on my night to cook. I like to make something different each night and this was a really good choice! Great prep and total cook 
time.  I made the recipe for two; there was just enough with a small salad and bread. Really good meal for just a regular ol weeknight!

So Delicious!!! I'm from TX and my grandmother makes the best gumbo but my Husband doesn't eat seafood or okra so this is a great alternative. We eat ours over white rice, Nummy!
