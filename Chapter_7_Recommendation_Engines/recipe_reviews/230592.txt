I loved this recipe! I have never roasted peppers before but I will definitely do them again. I enjoyed the whole grain linguine... my family did not even notice it! Great way to sneak in something a little healthier for them!

I really liked this simple dish. The sweetness of the peppers combined with the linguine was a hit for me. Will make this dish again!

We really liked this dish, although all of us thought it needed a protein element to really make it great.  Grilled chicken or sautéed shrimp would be fantastic.  I was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the pasta.  I usually shy away from whole grain pasta because it's sticky and chewy, but the Barilla  Whole Grain Linguine was perfect!  I will probably make this dish again with some meat added, but I will definitely be using Barilla Whole Grain pastas frequently in the future!

This was ok but will not be a repeat. I had no issues with roasting the peppers or putting the recipe together in general. I did use gf spaghetti instead of linguine. My issue is the flavor or more so lack of flavor. It was hints of garlic and roasted pepper but the primary flavor was the pasta. With some tweaking this could be perfect but as is it needs some help.

I thought this tasted okay. It did really feel like it was missing something. This is definitely a recipe that is all about the pasta. I actually ended up boiling the whole box but only used 1/2 of what I cooked, because it would have been way too much pasta. I picked the recipe, because for some reason it looked like a quick week night meal. Honestly, it is somewhat time consuming though. The peppers alone take over 30 minutes. I broiled them on high, on a foil lined sheet in the middle of the oven. They did take the full 15 minutes, another 15 minutes to rest, and even more time to cool. I also had plenty of dishes, with this recipe, a pot for boiling, a sheet pan, tongs, and a large saute pan, on top of cutting boards and knives. Although, the brown paper bag for the peppers was a time saver. I decided to add the optional vegetables and I can't imagine not doing that. I couldn't find frozen cauliflower so I did a Normandy mix I microwaved from frozen state in the microwave, then followed through with the sauté description. When done, I just ended up eating it for lunch. I didn't think it would fill up bigger eaters for dinner. Better than my typical lunch, though, anyway. ty
